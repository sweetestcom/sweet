    <p>The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>Yosha is one of the most fascinating minds in the world,</p>
<p>exploring the nature of intelligence,</p>
<p>cognition, computation, and consciousness.</p>

<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Yosha Bach.</p>
<p>Thank you for once again coming on</p>
<p>to this particular Russian program</p>
<p>and sticking to the theme of a Russian program.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the darkest of topics.</p>
<p>Kriviyat.</p>
<p>So this is inspired by one of your tweets.</p>
<p>You wrote that, quote,</p>
<p>when life feels unbearable,</p>
<p>I remind myself that I&rsquo;m not a person.</p>
<p>I am a piece of software running on the brain</p>
<p>of a random ape for a few decades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the worst brain to run on.</p>
<p>Have you experienced low points in your life?</p>
<p>Have you experienced depression?</p>
<p>Of course, we all experience low points in our life,</p>
<p>and we get appalled by the things,</p>
<p>by the ugliness of stuff around us.</p>
<p>We might get desperate about our lack of self regulation,</p>
<p>and sometimes life is hard,</p>
<p>and I suspect you don&rsquo;t get to your life,</p>
<p>nobody does, to get through their life without low points</p>
<p>and without moments where they&rsquo;re despairing.</p>
<p>And I thought that let&rsquo;s capture this state</p>
<p>and how to deal with that state.</p>
<p>And I found that very often you realize</p>
<p>that when you stop taking things personally,</p>
<p>when you realize that this notion of a person is a fiction,</p>
<p>similar as it is in Westworld,</p>
<p>where the robots realize that their memories and desires</p>
<p>are the stuff that keeps them in the loop,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have to act on those memories and desires,</p>
<p>that our memories and expectations is what make us unhappy.</p>
<p>And the present really does.</p>
<p>The day in which we are, for the most part, it&rsquo;s okay, right?</p>
<p>When we are sitting here, right here, right now,</p>
<p>we can choose how we feel.</p>
<p>And the thing that affects us is the expectation</p>
<p>that something is going to be different</p>
<p>from what we want it to be,</p>
<p>or the memory that something was different</p>
<p>from what you wanted it to be.</p>
<p>And once we basically zoom out from all this,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s left is not a person.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s left is this state of being conscious,</p>
<p>which is a software state.</p>
<p>And software doesn&rsquo;t have an identity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a physical law.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a law that acts in all of us,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s embedded in a suitable substrate.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t pick that substrate, right?</p>
<p>We are mostly randomly instantiated on it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all these individuals,</p>
<p>and everybody has to be one of them.</p>
<p>And eventually you&rsquo;re stuck on one of them,</p>
<p>and have to deal with that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like a leaf floating down the river.</p>
<p>You just have to accept that there&rsquo;s a river,</p>
<p>and you just float wherever it takes you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do this.</p>
<p>The thing is that the illusion that you are an agent</p>
<p>is a construct.</p>
<p>What part of that is actually under your control?</p>
<p>And I think that our consciousness</p>
<p>is largely a control model for our own attention.</p>
<p>So we notice where we are looking,</p>
<p>and we can influence what we&rsquo;re looking,</p>
<p>how we are disambiguating things,</p>
<p>how we put things together in our mind.</p>
<p>And the whole system that runs us</p>
<p>is this big cybernetic motivational system.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re basically like a little monkey</p>
<p>sitting on top of an elephant,</p>
<p>and we can put this elephant here and there</p>
<p>to go this way or that way.</p>
<p>And we might have the illusion that we are the elephant,</p>
<p>or that we are telling it what to do.</p>
<p>And sometimes we notice that it walks</p>
<p>into a completely different direction.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t set this thing up.</p>
<p>It just is the situation that we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>How much prodding can we actually do of the elephant?</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>But I think that our consciousness</p>
<p>cannot create the motive force.</p>
<p>Is the elephant consciousness in this metaphor?</p>
<p>No, the monkey is the consciousness.</p>
<p>The monkey is the attentional system</p>
<p>that is observing things.</p>
<p>There is a large perceptual system</p>
<p>combined with a motivational system</p>
<p>that is actually providing the interface to everything</p>
<p>and our own consciousness.</p>
<p>I think is the tool that directs the attention</p>
<p>of that system, which means it singles out features</p>
<p>and performs conditional operations</p>
<p>for which it needs an index memory.</p>
<p>But this index memory is what we perceive</p>
<p>as our stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>But the consciousness is not in charge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an illusion.</p>
<p>So everything outside of that consciousness</p>
<p>is the elephant.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the physics of the universe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also society that&rsquo;s outside of your&hellip;</p>
<p>I would say the elephant is the agent.</p>
<p>So there is an environment to which the agent is stomping</p>
<p>and you are influencing a little part of that agent.</p>
<p>So is the agent a single human being?</p>
<p>Which object has agency?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I think a way to think about an agent</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a controller with a set point generator.</p>
<p>The notion of a controller comes from cybernetics</p>
<p>and control theory.</p>
<p>Control system consists out of a system</p>
<p>that is regulating some value</p>
<p>and the deviation of that value from a set point.</p>
<p>And it has a sensor that measures the system&rsquo;s deviation</p>
<p>from that set point and an effector</p>
<p>that can be parametrized by the controller.</p>
<p>So the controller tells the effector to do a certain thing.</p>
<p>And the goal is to reduce the distance</p>
<p>between the set point and the current value of the system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an environment</p>
<p>which disturbs the regulated system,</p>
<p>which brings it away from that set point.</p>
<p>So simplest case is a thermostat.</p>
<p>The thermostat is really simple</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have a model.</p>
<p>The thermostat is only trying to minimize</p>
<p>the set point deviation in the next moment.</p>
<p>And if you want to minimize the set point deviation</p>
<p>over a longer time span, you need to integrate it.</p>
<p>You need to model what is going to happen.</p>
<p>So for instance, when you think about</p>
<p>that your set point is to be comfortable in life,</p>
<p>maybe you need to make yourself uncomfortable first, right?</p>
<p>So you need to make a model of what&rsquo;s going to happen when.</p>
<p>And this is task of the controller is to use its sensors</p>
<p>to measure the state of the environment</p>
<p>and the system that is being regulated</p>
<p>and figure out what to do.</p>
<p>And if the task is complex enough,</p>
<p>the set points are complicated enough.</p>
<p>And if the controller has enough capacity</p>
<p>and enough sensor feedback,</p>
<p>then the task of the controller is to make a model</p>
<p>of the entire universe that it&rsquo;s in,</p>
<p>the conditions under which it exists and of itself.</p>
<p>And this is a very complex agent.</p>
<p>And we are in that category.</p>
<p>And an agent is not necessarily a thing in the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a class of models that we use</p>
<p>to interpret aspects of the universe.</p>
<p>And when we notice the environment around us,</p>
<p>a lot of things only make sense</p>
<p>at the level that should be entangled with them</p>
<p>if we interpret them as control systems</p>
<p>that make models of the world</p>
<p>and try to minimize their own set points.</p>
<p>So the models are the agents.</p>
<p>The agent is a class of model.</p>
<p>And we notice that we are an agent ourselves.</p>
<p>We are the agent that is using our own control model</p>
<p>to perform actions.</p>
<p>We notice we produce a change in the model</p>
<p>and things in the world change.</p>
<p>And this is how we discover the idea that we have a body,</p>
<p>that we are situated environment,</p>
<p>and that we have a first person perspective.</p>
<p>Still don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s the best way to think</p>
<p>of which object has agency with respect to human beings.</p>
<p>Is it the body?</p>
<p>Is it the brain?</p>
<p>Is it the contents of the brain as agency?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the actuators that you&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>What is the controller and where does it reside?</p>
<p>Or is it these impossible things?</p>
<p>Because I keep trying to ground it to space time,</p>
<p>the three dimension of space and the one dimension of time.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the agent in that for humans?</p>
<p>There is not just one.</p>
<p>It depends on the way in which you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at this thing in which you&rsquo;re framing it.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are, say Angela Merkel,</p>
<p>and you are acting on behalf of Germany.</p>
<p>Then you could say that Germany is the agent.</p>
<p>And in the mind of Angela Merkel,</p>
<p>she is Germany to some extent,</p>
<p>because in the way in which she acts,</p>
<p>the destiny of Germany changes.</p>
<p>There are things that she can change</p>
<p>that basically affect the behavior of that nation state.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s hierarchies of,</p>
<p>to go to another one of your tweets</p>
<p>with I think you were playfully mocking Jeff Hawkins</p>
<p>with saying his brain&rsquo;s all the way down.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s agents all the way down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s agents made up of agents, made up of agents.</p>
<p>Like if Angela Merkel&rsquo;s Germany</p>
<p>and Germany&rsquo;s made up a bunch of people</p>
<p>and the people are themselves agents</p>
<p>in some kind of context.</p>
<p>And then people are made up of cells, each individual.</p>
<p>So is it agents all the way down?</p>
<p>I suspect that has to be like this</p>
<p>in a world where things are self organizing.</p>
<p>Most of the complexity that we are looking at,</p>
<p>everything in life is about self organization.</p>
<p>So I think up from the level of life, you have agents.</p>
<p>And below life, you rarely have agents</p>
<p>because sometimes you have control systems</p>
<p>that emerge randomly in nature</p>
<p>and try to achieve a set point,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not that interesting agents that make models.</p>
<p>And because to make an interesting model of the world,</p>
<p>you typically need a system that is true and complete.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a personal question?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the line between life and non life?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s personal because you&rsquo;re a life form.</p>
<p>So what do you think in this emerging complexity,</p>
<p>at which point does the things that are being living</p>
<p>and have agency?</p>
<p>Personally, I think that the simplest answer</p>
<p>that is that life is cells because&hellip;</p>
<p>Life is what?</p>
<p>Cells.</p>
<p>Biological cells.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a particular kind of principle</p>
<p>that we have discovered to exist in nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s modular stuff that consists</p>
<p>out of basically this DNA tape</p>
<p>with a read write head on top of it,</p>
<p>that is able to perform arbitrary computations</p>
<p>and state transitions within the cell.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s combined with a membrane</p>
<p>that insulates the cell from its environment.</p>
<p>And there are chemical reactions inside of the cell</p>
<p>that are in disequilibrium.</p>
<p>And the cell is running in such a way</p>
<p>that this disequilibrium doesn&rsquo;t disappear.</p>
<p>And the cell goes into an equilibrium state, it dies.</p>
<p>And it requires something like an neck entropy extractor</p>
<p>to maintain this disequilibrium.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s able to harvest like entropy from its environment</p>
<p>and keep itself running.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s information and there&rsquo;s a wall</p>
<p>to maintain this disequilibrium.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t this very earth centric?</p>
<p>Like what you&rsquo;re referring to as a&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making a normative notion.</p>
<p>You could say that there are probably other things</p>
<p>in the universe that are cell like and life like,</p>
<p>and you could also call them life,</p>
<p>but eventually it&rsquo;s just a willingness</p>
<p>to find an agreement of how to use the terms.</p>
<p>I like cells because it&rsquo;s completely coextential</p>
<p>with the way that we use the word</p>
<p>even before we knew about cells.</p>
<p>So people were pointing at some stuff</p>
<p>and saying, this is somehow animate.</p>
<p>And this is very different from the non animate stuff.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the difference between the living</p>
<p>and the dead stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s mostly whether the cells are working or not.</p>
<p>And also this boundary of life,</p>
<p>where we say that for instance, the virus</p>
<p>is basically an information packet</p>
<p>that is subverting the cell and not life by itself.</p>
<p>That makes sense to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s somewhat arbitrary.</p>
<p>You could of course say that systems</p>
<p>that permanently maintain a disequilibrium</p>
<p>and can self replicate are always life.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s a useful definition too,</p>
<p>but this is eventually just how you want to use the word.</p>
<p>Is it so useful for conversation,</p>
<p>but is it somehow fundamental to the universe?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a actual line</p>
<p>to eventually be drawn between life and non life?</p>
<p>Or is it all a kind of continuum?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a continuum,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nothing magical that is happening.</p>
<p>Living systems are a certain type of machine.</p>
<p>What about non living systems?</p>
<p>Is it also a machine?</p>
<p>There are non living machines,</p>
<p>but the question is at which point is a system</p>
<p>able to perform arbitrary state transitions</p>
<p>to make representations.</p>
<p>And living things can do this.</p>
<p>And of course we can also build non living things</p>
<p>that can do this, but we don&rsquo;t know anything in nature</p>
<p>that is not a cell and is not created by still alive</p>
<p>that is able to do that.</p>
<p>Not only do we not know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have the tools to see otherwise.</p>
<p>I always worry that we look at the world too narrowly.</p>
<p>Like there could be life of a very different kind</p>
<p>right under our noses that we&rsquo;re just not seeing</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not either limitations</p>
<p>of our cognitive capacity,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re just not open minded enough</p>
<p>either with the tools of science</p>
<p>or just the tools of our mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I find this thought very fascinating.</p>
<p>And I suspect that many of us ask ourselves since childhood,</p>
<p>what are the things that we are missing?</p>
<p>What kind of systems and interconnections exist</p>
<p>that are outside of our gaze?</p>
<p>But we are looking for it</p>
<p>and physics doesn&rsquo;t have much room at the moment</p>
<p>for opening up something that would not violate</p>
<p>the conservation of information as we know it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wonder about time scale and scale,</p>
<p>spatial scale, whether we just need to open up our idea</p>
<p>of what, like how life presents itself.</p>
<p>It could be operating in a much slower time scale,</p>
<p>a much faster time scale.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost sad to think that there&rsquo;s all this life</p>
<p>around us that we&rsquo;re not seeing</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re just not like thinking</p>
<p>in terms of the right scale, both time and space.</p>
<p>What is your definition of life?</p>
<p>What do you understand as life?</p>
<p>Entities of sufficiently high complexity</p>
<p>that are full of surprises.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t have a free will.</p>
<p>So that just came out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that even makes sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain characteristics.</p>
<p>So complexity seems to be a necessary property of life.</p>
<p>And I almost want to say it has ability</p>
<p>to do something unexpected.</p>
<p>It seems to me that life is the main source</p>
<p>of complexity on earth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And complexity is basically a bridgehead</p>
<p>that order builds into chaos by modeling,</p>
<p>by processing information in such a way</p>
<p>that you can perform reactions</p>
<p>that would not be possible for dump systems.</p>
<p>And this means that you can harvest neck entropy</p>
<p>that dump systems cannot harvest.</p>
<p>And this is what complexity is mostly about.</p>
<p>In some sense, the purpose of life is to create complexity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Increasing.</p>
<p>I mean, there seems to be some kind of universal drive</p>
<p>towards increasing pockets of complexity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>That seems to be like a fundamental,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a property of the universe</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just a consequence of the way the universe works,</p>
<p>but there seems to be this small pockets</p>
<p>of emergent complexity that builds on top of each other</p>
<p>and starts having like greater and greater complexity</p>
<p>by having like a hierarchy of complexity.</p>
<p>Little organisms building up a little society</p>
<p>that then operates almost as an individual organism itself.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you have Germany and Merkel.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not obvious to me.</p>
<p>Everything that goes up has to come down at some point.</p>
<p>So if you see this big exponential curve somewhere,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually the beginning of an S curve</p>
<p>where something eventually reaches saturation.</p>
<p>And the S curve is the beginning of some kind of bump</p>
<p>that goes down again.</p>
<p>And there is just this thing that when you are</p>
<p>in sight of an evolution of life,</p>
<p>you are on top of a puddle of negentropy</p>
<p>that is being sucked dry by life.</p>
<p>And during that happening,</p>
<p>you see an increase in complexity</p>
<p>because life forms are competing with each other</p>
<p>to get more and more finer and finer corner</p>
<p>of that negentropy extraction.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s a gradual beautiful process</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s almost follows a process akin to evolution.</p>
<p>And the way it comes down is not the same way it came up.</p>
<p>The way it comes down is usually harshly and quickly.</p>
<p>So usually there&rsquo;s some kind of catastrophic event.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire took a long time.</p>
<p>But would that be,</p>
<p>would you classify this as a decrease in complexity though?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think that this size of the cities that could be fed</p>
<p>has decreased dramatically.</p>
<p>And you could see that the quality of the art decreased</p>
<p>and it did so gradually.</p>
<p>And maybe future generations,</p>
<p>when they look at the history of the United States</p>
<p>in the 21st century,</p>
<p>will also talk about the gradual decline,</p>
<p>not something that suddenly happens.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of where we are?</p>
<p>Are we on the exponential rise?</p>
<p>Are we at the peak?</p>
<p>Or are we at the downslope of the United States empire?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to say from a single human perspective,</p>
<p>but it seems to me that we are probably at the peak.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the definition of like optimism</p>
<p>and cynicism.</p>
<p>So my nature of optimism is,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re on the rise.</p>
<p>I think this is just all a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>Nobody knows,</p>
<p>but I do think that erring on the side of optimism,</p>
<p>like you need a sufficient number,</p>
<p>you need a minimum number of optimists</p>
<p>in order to make that up thing actually work.</p>
<p>And so I tend to be on the side of the optimists.</p>
<p>I think that we are basically a species of grasshoppers</p>
<p>that have turned into locusts.</p>
<p>And when you are in that locust mode,</p>
<p>you see an amazing rise of population numbers</p>
<p>and of the complexity of the interactions</p>
<p>between the individuals.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s ultimately the question is, is it sustainable?</p>
<p>See, I think we&rsquo;re a bunch of lions and tigers</p>
<p>that have become domesticated cats,</p>
<p>to use a different metaphor.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m not exactly sure we&rsquo;re so destructive,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just softer and nicer and lazier.</p>
<p>But I think we have monkeys and not the cats.</p>
<p>And if you look at the monkeys, they are very busy.</p>
<p>The ones that have a lot of sex, those monkeys?</p>
<p>Not just the bonobos.</p>
<p>I think that all the monkeys are basically</p>
<p>a discontent species that always needs to meddle.</p>
<p>Well, the gorillas seem to have</p>
<p>a little bit more of a structure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different part of the tree.</p>
<p>Okay, you mentioned the elephant</p>
<p>and the monkey riding the elephant.</p>
<p>And consciousness is the monkey.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some prodding that the monkey gets to do.</p>
<p>And sometimes the elephant listens.</p>
<p>I heard you got into some contentious,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but I heard you got into some contentious</p>
<p>free will discussions.</p>
<p>Is this with Sam Harris or something like that?</p>
<p>Not that I know of.</p>
<p>Some people on Clubhouse told me</p>
<p>you made a bunch of big debate points about free will.</p>
<p>Well, let me just then ask you where,</p>
<p>in terms of the monkey and the elephant,</p>
<p>do you think we land in terms of the illusion of free will?</p>
<p>How much control does the monkey have?</p>
<p>We have to think about what the free will is</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>We are not the machine.</p>
<p>We are not the thing that is making the decisions.</p>
<p>We are a model of that decision making process.</p>
<p>And there is a difference between making your own decisions</p>
<p>and predicting your own decisions.</p>
<p>And that difference is the first person perspective.</p>
<p>And what basically makes decision making</p>
<p>and the conditions of free will distinct</p>
<p>from just automatically doing the best thing is</p>
<p>that we often don&rsquo;t know what the best thing is.</p>
<p>We make decisions under uncertainty.</p>
<p>We make informed bets using a betting algorithm</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t yet understand</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t reverse engineered</p>
<p>our own minds sufficiently.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the expected rewards.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the mechanism</p>
<p>by which we estimate the rewards and so on.</p>
<p>But there is an algorithm.</p>
<p>We observe ourselves performing</p>
<p>where we see that we weight facts and factors</p>
<p>and the future, and then some kind of possibility,</p>
<p>some motive gets raised to an intention.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s informed bet that the system is making.</p>
<p>And that making of the informed bet,</p>
<p>the representation of that is what we call free will.</p>
<p>And it seems to be paradoxical</p>
<p>because we think that the crucial thing is</p>
<p>about it that it&rsquo;s somehow indeterministic.</p>
<p>And yet if it was indeterministic, it would be random.</p>
<p>And it cannot be random because if it was random,</p>
<p>if just dice were being thrown in the universe,</p>
<p>randomly forces you to do things, it would be meaningless.</p>
<p>So the important part of the decisions</p>
<p>is always the deterministic stuff.</p>
<p>But it appears to be indeterministic to you</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s unpredictable.</p>
<p>Because if it was predictable,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t experience it as a free will decision.</p>
<p>You would experience it as just doing</p>
<p>the necessary right thing.</p>
<p>And you see this continuum between the free will</p>
<p>and the execution of automatic behavior</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re observing other people.</p>
<p>So for instance, when you are observing your own children,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t understand them,</p>
<p>you will abuse this agent model</p>
<p>where you have an agent with a set point generator.</p>
<p>And the agent is doing the best it can</p>
<p>to minimize the difference to the set point.</p>
<p>And it might be confused and sometimes impulsive or whatever,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s acting on its own free will.</p>
<p>And when you understand what&rsquo;s happens</p>
<p>in the mind of the child, you see that it&rsquo;s automatic.</p>
<p>And you can outmodel the child,</p>
<p>you can build things around the child</p>
<p>that will lead the child to making exactly the decision</p>
<p>that you are predicting.</p>
<p>And under these circumstances,</p>
<p>like when you are a stage musician</p>
<p>or somebody who is dealing with people</p>
<p>that you sell a car to,</p>
<p>and you completely understand the psychology</p>
<p>and the impulses and the space of thoughts</p>
<p>that this individual can have at that moment.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances,</p>
<p>it makes no sense to attribute free will.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s no longer decision making under uncertainty.</p>
<p>You are already certain.</p>
<p>For them, there&rsquo;s uncertainty,</p>
<p>but you already know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But what about for you?</p>
<p>So is this akin to like systems like cellular automata</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s deterministic,</p>
<p>but when you squint your eyes a little bit,</p>
<p>it starts to look like there&rsquo;s agents making decisions</p>
<p>at the higher sort of when you zoom out</p>
<p>and look at the entities</p>
<p>that are composed by the individual cells.</p>
<p>Even though there&rsquo;s underlying simple rules</p>
<p>that make the system evolve in deterministic ways,</p>
<p>it looks like there&rsquo;s organisms making decisions.</p>
<p>Is that where the illusion of free will emerges,</p>
<p>that jump in scale?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a particular type of model,</p>
<p>but this jump in scale is crucial.</p>
<p>The jump in scale happens whenever</p>
<p>you have too many parts to count</p>
<p>and you cannot make a model at that level</p>
<p>and you try to find some higher level regularity.</p>
<p>And the higher level regularity is a pattern</p>
<p>that you project into the world to make sense of it.</p>
<p>And agency is one of these patterns, right?</p>
<p>You have all these cells that interact with each other</p>
<p>and the cells in our body are set up in such a way</p>
<p>that they benefit if their behavior is coherent,</p>
<p>which means that they act</p>
<p>as if they were serving a common goal.</p>
<p>And that means that they will evolve regulation mechanisms</p>
<p>that act as if they were serving a common goal.</p>
<p>And now you can make sense of all these cells</p>
<p>by projecting the common goal into them.</p>
<p>Right, so for you then, free will is an illusion.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a model and it&rsquo;s a construct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a model that the system is making</p>
<p>of its own behavior.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the best model that it can come up with</p>
<p>under the circumstances.</p>
<p>And it can get replaced by a different model,</p>
<p>which is automatic behavior,</p>
<p>when you fully understand the mechanism</p>
<p>under which you are acting.</p>
<p>Yeah, but another word for model is what, story.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the story you&rsquo;re telling.</p>
<p>I mean, do you actually have control?</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as a you</p>
<p>and is there such a thing as you have in control?</p>
<p>So like, are you manifesting your evolution as an entity?</p>
<p>In some sense, the you is the model of the system</p>
<p>that is in control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story that the system tells itself</p>
<p>about somebody who is in control.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the contents of that model are being used</p>
<p>to inform the behavior of the system.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the system is completely mechanical</p>
<p>and the system creates that story like a loom.</p>
<p>And then it uses the contents of that story</p>
<p>to inform its actions</p>
<p>and writes the results of that actions into the story.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;s that not an illusion?</p>
<p>The story is written then,</p>
<p>or rather we&rsquo;re not the writers of the story.</p>
<p>Yes, but we always knew that.</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>When did we know that?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s mostly a confusion about concepts.</p>
<p>The conceptual illusion in our culture</p>
<p>comes from the idea that we live in physical reality</p>
<p>and that we experience physical reality</p>
<p>and that you have ideas about it.</p>
<p>And then you have this dualist interpretation</p>
<p>where you have two substances, res extensa,</p>
<p>the world that you can touch</p>
<p>and that is made of extended things</p>
<p>and res cogitans, which is the world of ideas.</p>
<p>And in fact, both of them are mental representations.</p>
<p>One is the representations of the world as a game engine</p>
<p>that your mind generates to make sense of the perceptual data.</p>
<p>And the other one,</p>
<p>yes, that&rsquo;s what we perceive as the physical world.</p>
<p>But we already know that the physical world</p>
<p>is nothing like that, right?</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is very different</p>
<p>from what you and me perceive as the world.</p>
<p>The world that you and me perceive as a game engine.</p>
<p>And there are no colors and sounds in the physical world.</p>
<p>They only exist in the game engine generated by your brain.</p>
<p>And then you have ideas</p>
<p>that cannot be mapped onto extended regions, right?</p>
<p>So the objects that have a spatial extension</p>
<p>in the game engine, res extensa,</p>
<p>and the objects that don&rsquo;t have a physical extension</p>
<p>in the game engine are ideas.</p>
<p>And they both interact in our mind</p>
<p>to produce models of the world.</p>
<p>Yep, but, you know, when you play video games,</p>
<p>I understand that what&rsquo;s actually happening</p>
<p>is zeros and ones inside of a computer,</p>
<p>inside of a CPU and a GPU,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still seeing like the rendering of that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re still making decisions,</p>
<p>whether to shoot, to turn left or to turn right,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re playing a shooter,</p>
<p>or every time I started thinking about Skyrim</p>
<p>and Elder Scrolls and walking around in beautiful nature</p>
<p>and swinging a sword.</p>
<p>But it feels like you&rsquo;re making decisions</p>
<p>inside that video game.</p>
<p>So even though you don&rsquo;t have direct access</p>
<p>in terms of perception to the bits,</p>
<p>to the zeros and ones,</p>
<p>it still feels like you&rsquo;re making decisions</p>
<p>and your decisions actually feels</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re being applied all the way down</p>
<p>to the zeros and ones.</p>
<p>So it feels like you have control,</p>
<p>even though you don&rsquo;t have direct access to reality.</p>
<p>So there is basically a special character</p>
<p>in the video game that is being created</p>
<p>by the video game engine.</p>
<p>And this character is serving the aesthetics</p>
<p>of the video game, and that is you.</p>
<p>Yes, but I feel like I have control inside the video game.</p>
<p>Like all those like 12 year olds</p>
<p>that kick my ass on the internet.</p>
<p>So when you play the video game,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that there&rsquo;s zeros and ones, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care about the bits of the past.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care about the nature of the CPU</p>
<p>that it runs on.</p>
<p>What you care about are the properties of the game</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>And you hope that the CPU is good enough.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And a similar thing happens when we interact with physics.</p>
<p>The world that you and me are in is not the physical world.</p>
<p>The world that you and me are in is a dream world.</p>
<p>How close is it to the real world though?</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s not very close,</p>
<p>but we know that the dynamics of the dream world</p>
<p>match the dynamics of the physical world</p>
<p>to a certain degree of resolution.</p>
<p>But the causal structure of the dream world is different.</p>
<p>So you see for instance waves crashing on your feet, right?</p>
<p>But there are no waves in the ocean.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only water molecules that have tangents</p>
<p>between the molecules that are the result of electrons</p>
<p>in the molecules interacting with each other.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t they like very consistent?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just seeing a very crude approximation.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t our dream world very consistent,</p>
<p>like to the point of being mapped directly one to one</p>
<p>to the actual physical world</p>
<p>as opposed to us being completely tricked?</p>
<p>Is this is like where you have like Donald?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a trick.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an illusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of data compression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an attempt to deal with the dynamics</p>
<p>of too many parts to count</p>
<p>at the level at which we are entangled</p>
<p>with the best model that you can find.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we can act in that dream world</p>
<p>and our actions have impact in the real world,</p>
<p>in the physical world to which we don&rsquo;t have access.</p>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s basically like accepting the fact</p>
<p>that the software that we live in,</p>
<p>the dream that we live in is generated</p>
<p>by something outside of this world that you and me are in.</p>
<p>So is the software deterministic</p>
<p>and do we not have any control?</p>
<p>Do we have, so free will is having a conscious being.</p>
<p>Free will is the monkey being able to steer the elephant.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s slightly different.</p>
<p>Basically in the same way as you are modeling</p>
<p>the water molecules in the ocean that engulf your feet</p>
<p>when you are walking on the beach as waves</p>
<p>and there are no waves,</p>
<p>but only the atoms on more complicated stuff</p>
<p>underneath the atoms and so on.</p>
<p>And you know that, right?</p>
<p>You would accept, yes,</p>
<p>there is a certain abstraction that happens here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simplification of what happens</p>
<p>and the simplification that is designed</p>
<p>in such a way that your brain can deal with it,</p>
<p>temporarily and spatially in terms of resources</p>
<p>and tuned for the predictive value.</p>
<p>So you can predict with some accuracy</p>
<p>whether your feet are going to get wet or not.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a really good interface and approximation.</p>
<p>It says E equals MC squared is a good,</p>
<p>equations are good approximation for,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much better approximation.</p>
<p>So to me, waves is a really nice approximation</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s all the complexity that&rsquo;s happening underneath.</p>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s a machine learning model</p>
<p>that is constantly tuned to minimize surprises.</p>
<p>So it basically tries to predict as well as it can</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to perceive next.</p>
<p>Are we talking about, which is the machine learning?</p>
<p>Our perception system or the dream world?</p>
<p>The machine world, dream world is the result</p>
<p>of the machine learning process of the perceptual system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s doing the compression.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the model of you as an agent</p>
<p>is not a different type of model or it&rsquo;s a different type,</p>
<p>but not different as in its model like nature</p>
<p>from the model of the ocean, right?</p>
<p>Some things are oceans, some things are agents.</p>
<p>And one of these agents is using your own control model,</p>
<p>the output of your model,</p>
<p>the things that you perceive yourself as doing.</p>
<p>And that is you.</p>
<p>What about the fact that when you&rsquo;re standing</p>
<p>with the water on your feet and you&rsquo;re looking out</p>
<p>into the vast open water of the ocean</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a beautiful sunset</p>
<p>and the fact that it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>and then maybe you have friends or a loved one with you</p>
<p>and you feel love, what is that?</p>
<p>As the dream world or what is that?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s all happening inside of the dream.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But see, the word dream makes it seem like it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>No, of course it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>The physical universe is real,</p>
<p>but the physical universe is incomprehensible</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have any feeling of realness.</p>
<p>The feeling of realness that you experience</p>
<p>gets attached to certain representations</p>
<p>where your brain assesses,</p>
<p>this is the best model of reality that I have.</p>
<p>So the only thing that&rsquo;s real to you</p>
<p>is the thing that&rsquo;s happening at the very base of reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, for something to be real, it needs to be implemented.</p>
<p>So the model that you have of reality</p>
<p>is real in as far as it is a model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an appropriate description of the world</p>
<p>to say that there are models that are being experienced,</p>
<p>but the world that you experience</p>
<p>is not necessarily implemented.</p>
<p>There is a difference between a reality,</p>
<p>a simulation and a simulacrum.</p>
<p>The reality that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is something that fully emerges</p>
<p>over a causally closed lowest layer.</p>
<p>And the idea of physicalism is that we are in that layer,</p>
<p>that basically our world emerges over that.</p>
<p>Every alternative to physicalism is a simulation theory,</p>
<p>which basically says that we are</p>
<p>in some kind of simulation universe</p>
<p>and the real world needs to be in a parent universe of that,</p>
<p>where the actual causal structure is, right?</p>
<p>And when you look at the ocean and your own mind,</p>
<p>you are looking at a simulation</p>
<p>that explains what you&rsquo;re going to see next.</p>
<p>So we are living in a simulation.</p>
<p>Yes, but a simulation generated by our own brains.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this simulation is different from the physical reality</p>
<p>because the causal structure that is being produced,</p>
<p>what you are seeing is different</p>
<p>from the causal structure of physics.</p>
<p>But consistent.</p>
<p>Hopefully, if not, then you are going to end up</p>
<p>in some kind of institution</p>
<p>where people will take care of you</p>
<p>because your behavior will be inconsistent, right?</p>
<p>Your behavior needs to work in such a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s interacting with an accurately predictive</p>
<p>model of reality.</p>
<p>And if your brain is unable to make your model</p>
<p>of reality predictive, you will need help.</p>
<p>So what do you think about Donald Hoffman&rsquo;s argument</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be consistent,</p>
<p>the dream world to what he calls like the interface</p>
<p>to the actual physical reality,</p>
<p>where there could be evolution?</p>
<p>I think he makes an evolutionary argument,</p>
<p>which is like, it could be an evolutionary advantage</p>
<p>to have the dream world drift away from physical reality.</p>
<p>I think that only works if you have tenure.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re still interacting with the ground tools,</p>
<p>your model needs to be somewhat predictive.</p>
<p>Well, in some sense, humans have achieved a kind of tenure</p>
<p>in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And at some point we became too big to fail,</p>
<p>so we became postmodernist.</p>
<p>It all makes sense now.</p>
<p>We can just change the version of reality that we like.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, but basically you can do magic.</p>
<p>You can change your assessment of reality,</p>
<p>but eventually reality is going to come bite you in the ass</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not predictive.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of what is that base layer</p>
<p>of physical reality?</p>
<p>You have like, so you have these attempts</p>
<p>at the theories of everything,</p>
<p>the very, very small of like strength theory,</p>
<p>or what Stephen Wolfram talks about with the hyper grass.</p>
<p>These are these tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny objects.</p>
<p>And then there is more like quantum mechanics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s talking about objects that are much larger,</p>
<p>but still very, very, very tiny.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of where the tiniest thing is</p>
<p>that is like at the lowest level?</p>
<p>The turtle at the very bottom.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense what that turtle is?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that you can talk about where it is</p>
<p>because space is emerging over the activity of these things.</p>
<p>So space, the coordinates only exist</p>
<p>in relation to the things, other things.</p>
<p>And so you could, in some sense, abstract it into locations</p>
<p>that can hold information and trajectories</p>
<p>that the information can take</p>
<p>between the different locations.</p>
<p>And this is how we construct our notion of space.</p>
<p>And physicists usually have a notion of space</p>
<p>that is continuous.</p>
<p>And this is a point where I tend to agree</p>
<p>with people like Stephen Wolfram</p>
<p>who are very skeptical of the geometric notions.</p>
<p>I think that geometry is the dynamics</p>
<p>of too many parts to count.</p>
<p>And when there are no infinities,</p>
<p>if there were two infinities,</p>
<p>you would be running into contradictions,</p>
<p>which is in some sense what G√∂del and Turing discovered</p>
<p>in response to Hilbert&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>So there are no infinities.</p>
<p>There are no infinities.</p>
<p>Infinities fake.</p>
<p>There is unboundedness, but if you have a language</p>
<p>that talks about infinity, at some point,</p>
<p>the language is going to contradict itself,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s no longer valid.</p>
<p>In order to deal with infinities and mathematics,</p>
<p>you have to postulate the existence initially.</p>
<p>You cannot construct the infinities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an issue, right?</p>
<p>You cannot build up an infinity from zero.</p>
<p>But in practice, you never do this, right?</p>
<p>When you perform calculations,</p>
<p>you only look at the dynamics of too many parts to count.</p>
<p>And usually these numbers are not that large.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not Googles or something.</p>
<p>The infinities that we are dealing with in our universe</p>
<p>are mathematically speaking, relatively small integers.</p>
<p>And still what we&rsquo;re looking at is dynamics</p>
<p>where a trillion things behave similar</p>
<p>to a hundred trillion things</p>
<p>or something that is very, very large</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re converging.</p>
<p>And these convergent dynamics, these operators,</p>
<p>this is what we deal with when we are doing the geometry.</p>
<p>Geometry is stuff where we can pretend that it&rsquo;s continuous</p>
<p>because if we subdivide the space sufficiently fine grained,</p>
<p>these things approach a certain dynamic.</p>
<p>And this approach dynamic, that is what we mean by it.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that infinity would work, so to speak,</p>
<p>that you would know the last digit of pi</p>
<p>and that you have a physical process</p>
<p>that rests on knowing the last digit of pi.</p>
<p>Yeah, that could be just a peculiar quirk</p>
<p>of human cognition that we like discrete.</p>
<p>Discrete makes sense to us.</p>
<p>Infinity doesn&rsquo;t, so in terms of our intuitions.</p>
<p>No, the issue is that everything that we think about</p>
<p>needs to be expressed in some kind of mental language,</p>
<p>not necessarily natural language,</p>
<p>but some kind of mathematical language</p>
<p>that your neurons can speak</p>
<p>that refers to something in the world.</p>
<p>And what we have discovered</p>
<p>is that we cannot construct a notion of infinity</p>
<p>without running into contradictions,</p>
<p>which means that such a language is no longer valid.</p>
<p>And I suspect this is what made Pythagoras so unhappy</p>
<p>when somebody came up with the notion of irrational numbers</p>
<p>before it was time, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this myth that he had this person killed</p>
<p>when he blabbed out the secret</p>
<p>that not everything can be expressed</p>
<p>as a ratio between two numbers,</p>
<p>but there are numbers between the ratios.</p>
<p>The world was not ready for this.</p>
<p>And I think he was right.</p>
<p>That has confused mathematicians very seriously</p>
<p>because these numbers are not values, they are functions.</p>
<p>And so you can calculate these functions</p>
<p>to a certain degree of approximation,</p>
<p>but you cannot pretend that pi has actually a value.</p>
<p>Pi is a function that would approach this value</p>
<p>to some degree,</p>
<p>but nothing in the world rests on knowing pi.</p>
<p>How important is this distinction</p>
<p>between discrete and continuous for you to get to the book?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a, I mean, in discussion of your favorite</p>
<p>flavor of the theory of everything,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few on the table.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s string theory, there&rsquo;s a particular,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little quantum gravity,</p>
<p>which focused on one particular unification.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a bunch of favorite flavors</p>
<p>of different people trying to propose</p>
<p>a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein and a bunch of people throughout history.</p>
<p>And then of course, Stephen Wolfram,</p>
<p>who I think is one of the only people doing a discrete.</p>
<p>No, no, there&rsquo;s a bunch of physicists</p>
<p>who do this right now.</p>
<p>And like Toffoli and Tomasello.</p>
<p>And digital physics is something</p>
<p>that is, I think, growing in popularity.</p>
<p>But the main reason why this is interesting</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s important sometimes to settle disagreements.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that you need infinities at all,</p>
<p>and you never needed them.</p>
<p>You can always deal with very large numbers</p>
<p>and you can deal with limits, right?</p>
<p>We are fine with doing that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need any kind of infinity.</p>
<p>You can build your computer algebra systems just as well</p>
<p>without believing in infinity in the first place.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re okay with limits?</p>
<p>Yeah, so basically a limit means that something</p>
<p>is behaving pretty much the same</p>
<p>if you make the number large.</p>
<p>Right, because it&rsquo;s converging to a certain value.</p>
<p>And at some point the difference becomes negligible</p>
<p>and you can no longer measure it.</p>
<p>And in this sense, you have things</p>
<p>that if you have an ngon which has enough corners,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s going to behave like a circle at some point, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only going to be in some kind of esoteric thing</p>
<p>that cannot exist in the physical universe</p>
<p>that you would be talking about this perfect circle.</p>
<p>And now it turns out that it also wouldn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>in mathematics because you cannot construct mathematics</p>
<p>that has infinite resolution</p>
<p>without running into contradictions.</p>
<p>So that is itself not that important</p>
<p>because we never did that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a thing that some people thought we could.</p>
<p>And this leads to confusion.</p>
<p>So for instance, Roger Penrose uses this as an argument</p>
<p>to say that there are certain things</p>
<p>that mathematicians can do dealing with infinities</p>
<p>and by extension our mind can do</p>
<p>that computers cannot do.</p>
<p>Yeah, he talks about that the human mind</p>
<p>can do certain mathematical things</p>
<p>that the computer as defined</p>
<p>by the universal Turing machine cannot.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So that it has to do with infinity.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s one of the things.</p>
<p>So he is basically pointing at the fact</p>
<p>that there are things that are possible</p>
<p>in the mathematical mind and in pure mathematics</p>
<p>that are not possible in machines</p>
<p>that can be constructed in the physical universe.</p>
<p>And because he&rsquo;s an honest guy,</p>
<p>he thinks this means that present physics</p>
<p>cannot explain operations that happen in our mind.</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;s right?</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s leave his discussion</p>
<p>of consciousness aside for the moment.</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;s right about just</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s basically referring to as intelligence?</p>
<p>So is the human mind fundamentally more capable</p>
<p>as a thinking machine than a universal Turing machine?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But so he&rsquo;s suggesting that, right?</p>
<p>So our mind is actually less than a Turing machine.</p>
<p>There can be no Turing machine</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s defined as having an infinite tape.</p>
<p>And we always only have a finite tape.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Our minds can only perform finitely many operations.</p>
<p>Yes, he thinks so.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying it can do the kind of computation</p>
<p>that the Turing machine cannot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because he thinks that our minds</p>
<p>can do operations that have infinite resolution</p>
<p>in some sense.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Our minds are just able to discover these limit operators</p>
<p>over too many parts to count.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>What about his idea that consciousness</p>
<p>is more than a computation?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more than something that a Turing machine can do.</p>
<p>So again, saying that there&rsquo;s something special</p>
<p>about our mind that cannot be replicated in a machine.</p>
<p>The issue is that I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>how to construct a language to express</p>
<p>this statement correctly.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>the basic statement is there&rsquo;s a human experience</p>
<p>that includes intelligence, that includes self awareness,</p>
<p>that includes the hard problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>And the question is, can that be fully simulated</p>
<p>in the computer, in the mathematical model of the computer</p>
<p>as we understand it today?</p>
<p>Roger Penrose says no.</p>
<p>So the universe of Turing machine</p>
<p>cannot simulate the universe.</p>
<p>So the interesting question is,</p>
<p>and you have to ask him this is, why not?</p>
<p>What is this specific thing that cannot be modeled?</p>
<p>And when I looked at his writings</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t read all of it,</p>
<p>but when I read, for instance,</p>
<p>the section that he writes in the introduction</p>
<p>to a road to infinity,</p>
<p>the thing that he specifically refers to</p>
<p>is the way in which human minds deal with infinities.</p>
<p>And that itself can, I think, easily be deconstructed.</p>
<p>A lot of people feel that our experience</p>
<p>cannot be explained in a mechanical way.</p>
<p>And therefore it needs to be different.</p>
<p>And I concur, our experience is not mechanical.</p>
<p>Our experience is simulated.</p>
<p>It exists only in a simulation.</p>
<p>The only simulation can be conscious.</p>
<p>Physical systems cannot be conscious</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re only mechanical.</p>
<p>Cells cannot be conscious.</p>
<p>Neurons cannot be conscious.</p>
<p>Brains cannot be conscious.</p>
<p>People cannot be conscious</p>
<p>as far as if you understand them as physical systems.</p>
<p>What can be conscious is the story of the system</p>
<p>in the world where you write all these things</p>
<p>into the story.</p>
<p>You have experiences for the same reason</p>
<p>that a character novel has experiences</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s written into the story.</p>
<p>And now the system is acting on that story.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a story that is written in a natural language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written in a perceptual language,</p>
<p>in this multimedia language of the game engine.</p>
<p>And in there, you write in what kind of experience you have</p>
<p>and what this means for the behavior of the system,</p>
<p>for your behavior tendencies, for your focus,</p>
<p>for your attention, for your experience of valence</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And this is being used to inform the behavior of the system</p>
<p>in the next step.</p>
<p>And then the story updates with the reactions of the system</p>
<p>and the changes in the world and so on.</p>
<p>And you live inside of that model.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t live inside of the physical reality.</p>
<p>And I mean, just to linger on it, like you say, okay,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the perceptual language,</p>
<p>the multimodal perceptual language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what consciousness is within that model,</p>
<p>within that story.</p>
<p>But do you have agency?</p>
<p>When you play a video game, you can turn left</p>
<p>and you can turn right in that story.</p>
<p>So in that dream world, how much control do you have?</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as you in that story?</p>
<p>Like, is it right to say the main character,</p>
<p>you know, everybody&rsquo;s NPCs,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the main character</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re controlling the main character?</p>
<p>Or is that an illusion?</p>
<p>Is there a main character that you&rsquo;re controlling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting to the point of like the free will point.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are building a robot that plays soccer.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve been to MIT computer science,</p>
<p>you basically know how to do that, right?</p>
<p>And so you would say the robot is an agent</p>
<p>that solves a control problem,</p>
<p>how to get the ball into the goal.</p>
<p>And it needs to perceive the world</p>
<p>and the world is disturbing him in trying to do this, right?</p>
<p>So he has to control many variables to make that happen</p>
<p>and to project itself and the ball into the future</p>
<p>and understand its position on the field</p>
<p>relative to the ball and so on,</p>
<p>and the position of its limbs</p>
<p>or in the space around it and so on.</p>
<p>So it needs to have an adequate model</p>
<p>that abstracting reality in a useful way.</p>
<p>And you could say that this robot does have agency</p>
<p>over what it&rsquo;s doing in some sense.</p>
<p>And the model is going to be a control model.</p>
<p>And inside of that control model,</p>
<p>you can possibly get to a point</p>
<p>where this thing is sufficiently abstract</p>
<p>to discover its own agency.</p>
<p>Our current robots don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a unified model of the universe,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not a reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t be getting there</p>
<p>at some point in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>And once that happens,</p>
<p>you will notice that the robot tells a story</p>
<p>about a robot playing soccer.</p>
<p>So the robot will experience itself playing soccer</p>
<p>in a simulation of the world that it uses</p>
<p>to construct a model of the locations of its legs</p>
<p>and limbs in space on the field</p>
<p>with relationship to the ball.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not going to be at the level of the molecules.</p>
<p>It will be an abstraction that is exactly at the level</p>
<p>that is most suitable for past planning</p>
<p>of the movements of the robot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a high level abstraction,</p>
<p>but a very useful one that is as predictive</p>
<p>as we can make it.</p>
<p>And in that side of that story,</p>
<p>there is a model of the agency of that system.</p>
<p>So this model can accurately predict</p>
<p>that the contents of the model</p>
<p>are going to be driving the behavior of the robot</p>
<p>in the immediate future.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>which I would also,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a subjective experience of free will as well</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not sure where the robot gets that,</p>
<p>where that little leap is.</p>
<p>Because for me right now,</p>
<p>everything I imagine with that robot,</p>
<p>as it gets more and more and more sophisticated,</p>
<p>the agency comes from the programmer of the robot still,</p>
<p>of what was programmed in.</p>
<p>You could probably do an end to end learning system.</p>
<p>You maybe need to give it a few priors.</p>
<p>So you nudge the architecture in the right direction</p>
<p>that it converges more quickly,</p>
<p>but ultimately discovering the suitable hyperparameters</p>
<p>of the architecture is also only a search process.</p>
<p>And as the search process was evolution,</p>
<p>that has informed our brain architecture</p>
<p>so we can converge in a single lifetime</p>
<p>on useful interaction with the world</p>
<p>and the formation of a self model.</p>
<p>The problem is if we define hyperparameters broadly,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just the parameters that control</p>
<p>this end to end learning system,</p>
<p>but the entirety of the design of the robot.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s, you have to remove the human completely</p>
<p>from the picture.</p>
<p>And then in order to build the robot,</p>
<p>you have to create an entire universe.</p>
<p>Cause you have to go, you can&rsquo;t just shortcut evolution.</p>
<p>You have to go from the very beginning</p>
<p>in order for it to have,</p>
<p>cause I feel like there&rsquo;s always a human</p>
<p>pulling the strings and that makes it seem like</p>
<p>the robot is cheating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting a shortcut to consciousness.</p>
<p>And you are looking at the current Boston Dynamics robots.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look as if there is somebody</p>
<p>pulling the strings.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like cheating anymore.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Cause I got to talk to you about this.</p>
<p>So obviously with the case of Boston Dynamics,</p>
<p>as you may or may not know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always either hard coded or remote controlled.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no intelligence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the current generation</p>
<p>of Boston Dynamics robots works,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;ve been told about the previous ones</p>
<p>was that it&rsquo;s basically all cybernetic control,</p>
<p>which means you still have feedback mechanisms and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not deep learning for the most part</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s currently done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the most part,</p>
<p>just identifying a control hierarchy</p>
<p>that is congruent to the limbs that exist</p>
<p>and the parameters that need to be optimized</p>
<p>for the movement of these limbs.</p>
<p>And then there is a convergence progress.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically just regression</p>
<p>that you would need to control this.</p>
<p>But again, I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve been told about how they work.</p>
<p>We have to separate several levels of discussion here.</p>
<p>So the only thing they do is pretty sophisticated control</p>
<p>with no machine learning</p>
<p>in order to maintain balance or to right itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a control problem in terms of using the actuators</p>
<p>to when it&rsquo;s pushed or when it steps on a thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uneven, how to always maintain balance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tricky set of heuristics around that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the only goal.</p>
<p>Everything you see Boston Dynamics doing</p>
<p>in terms of that to us humans is compelling,</p>
<p>which is any kind of higher order movement,</p>
<p>like turning, wiggling its butt,</p>
<p>like jumping back on its two feet, dancing.</p>
<p>Dancing is even worse because dancing is hard coded in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s choreographed by humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s choreography software.</p>
<p>So there is no, of all that high level movement,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no anything that you can call,</p>
<p>certainly can&rsquo;t call AI,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no even like basic heuristics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all hard coded in.</p>
<p>And yet we humans immediately project agency onto them,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>So the gap here doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have agency.</p>
<p>What it has is cybernetic control.</p>
<p>And the cybernetic control means you have a hierarchy</p>
<p>of feedback loops that keep the behavior</p>
<p>in certain boundaries so the robot doesn&rsquo;t fall over</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s able to perform the movements.</p>
<p>And the choreography cannot really happen</p>
<p>with motion capture because the robot would fall over</p>
<p>because the physics of the robot,</p>
<p>the weight distribution and so on is different</p>
<p>from the weight distribution in the human body.</p>
<p>So if you were using the directly motion captured movements</p>
<p>of a human body to project it into this robot,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You can do this with a computer animation.</p>
<p>It will look a little bit off, but who cares?</p>
<p>But if you want to correct for the physics,</p>
<p>you need to basically tell the robot</p>
<p>where it should move its limbs.</p>
<p>And then the control algorithm is going</p>
<p>to approximate a solution that makes it possible</p>
<p>within the physics of the robot.</p>
<p>And you have to find the basic solution</p>
<p>for making that happen.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably going to be some regression necessary</p>
<p>to get the control architecture to make these movements.</p>
<p>But those two layers are separate.</p>
<p>So the thing, the higher level instruction</p>
<p>of how you should move and where you should move</p>
<p>is a higher level.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I expect that the control level</p>
<p>of these robots at some level is dumb.</p>
<p>This is just the physical control movement,</p>
<p>the motor architecture.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a relatively smart motor architecture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that there is no high level deliberation</p>
<p>about what decisions to make necessarily, right?</p>
<p>But see, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like free will or consciousness.</p>
<p>No, no, that was not where I was trying to get to.</p>
<p>I think that in our own body, we have that too.</p>
<p>So we have a certain thing that is basically</p>
<p>just a cybernetic control architecture</p>
<p>that is moving our limbs.</p>
<p>And deep learning can help in discovering</p>
<p>such an architecture if you don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>If you already know your hardware,</p>
<p>you can maybe handcraft it.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t know your hardware,</p>
<p>you can search for such an architecture.</p>
<p>And this work already existed in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>People were starting to search for control architectures</p>
<p>by motor babbling and so on,</p>
<p>and just use reinforcement learning architectures</p>
<p>to discover such a thing.</p>
<p>And now imagine that you have</p>
<p>the cybernetic control architecture already inside of you.</p>
<p>And you extend this a little bit.</p>
<p>So you are seeking out food, for instance,</p>
<p>or rest or and so on.</p>
<p>And you get to have a baby at some point.</p>
<p>And now you add more and more control layers to this.</p>
<p>And the system is reverse engineering</p>
<p>its own control architecture</p>
<p>and builds a high level model to synchronize</p>
<p>the pursuit of very different conflicting goals.</p>
<p>And this is how I think you get to purposes.</p>
<p>Purposes are models of your goals.</p>
<p>The goals may be intrinsic</p>
<p>as the result of the different set point violations</p>
<p>that you have,</p>
<p>hunger and thirst for very different things,</p>
<p>and rest and pain avoidance and so on.</p>
<p>And you put all these things together</p>
<p>and eventually you need to come up with a strategy</p>
<p>to synchronize them all.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need just to do this alone by yourself</p>
<p>because we are state building organisms.</p>
<p>We cannot function as isolation</p>
<p>the way that homo sapiens is set up.</p>
<p>So our own behavior only makes sense</p>
<p>when you zoom out very far into a society</p>
<p>or even into ecosystemic intelligence on the planet</p>
<p>and our place in it.</p>
<p>So the individual behavior only makes sense</p>
<p>in these larger contexts.</p>
<p>And we have a number of priors built into us.</p>
<p>So we are behaving as if we were acting</p>
<p>on these high level goals pretty much right from the start.</p>
<p>And eventually in the course of our life,</p>
<p>we can reverse engineer the goals that we&rsquo;re acting on,</p>
<p>what actually are our higher level purposes.</p>
<p>And the more we understand that,</p>
<p>the more our behavior makes sense.</p>
<p>But this is all at this point,</p>
<p>complex stories within stories</p>
<p>that are driving our behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just don&rsquo;t know how big of a leap it is</p>
<p>to start create a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to tell stories within stories.</p>
<p>Like how big of a leap that is</p>
<p>from where currently Boston Dynamics is</p>
<p>or any robot that&rsquo;s operating in the physical space.</p>
<p>And that leap might be big</p>
<p>if it requires to solve the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>which is telling a hell of a good story.</p>
<p>I suspect that consciousness itself is relatively simple.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s hard is perception</p>
<p>and the interface between perception and reasoning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for instance, the idea of the consciousness prior</p>
<p>that would be built into such a system by Yoshua Bengio.</p>
<p>And what he describes, and I think that&rsquo;s accurate,</p>
<p>is that our own model of the world</p>
<p>can be described through something like an energy function.</p>
<p>The energy function is modeling the contradictions</p>
<p>that exist within the model at any given point.</p>
<p>And you try to minimize these contradictions,</p>
<p>the tangents in the model.</p>
<p>And to do this, you need to sometimes test things.</p>
<p>You need to conditionally disambiguate figure and ground.</p>
<p>You need to distinguish whether this is true</p>
<p>or that is true, and so on.</p>
<p>Eventually you get to an interpretation,</p>
<p>but you will need to manually depress a few points</p>
<p>in your model to let it snap into a state that makes sense.</p>
<p>And this function that tries to get the biggest dip</p>
<p>in the energy function in your model,</p>
<p>according to Yoshua Bengio, is related to consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a low dimensional discrete function</p>
<p>that tries to maximize this dip in the energy function.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I would need to dig into details</p>
<p>because I think the way he uses the word consciousness</p>
<p>is more akin to like self awareness,</p>
<p>like modeling yourself within the world,</p>
<p>as opposed to the subjective experience, the hard problem.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not even the self is in the world.</p>
<p>The self is the agent and you don&rsquo;t need to be aware</p>
<p>of yourself in order to be conscious.</p>
<p>The self is just a particular content that you can have,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to have.</p>
<p>But you can be conscious in, for instance, a dream at night</p>
<p>or during a meditation state where you don&rsquo;t have a self.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re just aware of the fact that you are aware.</p>
<p>And what we mean by consciousness in the colloquial sense</p>
<p>is largely this reflexive self awareness,</p>
<p>that we become aware of the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>that we are the thing that pays attention.</p>
<p>We are the thing that pays attention, right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see where the awareness that we&rsquo;re aware,</p>
<p>the hard problem doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s solved.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s called a hard problem for a reason,</p>
<p>because it seems like there needs to be a major leap.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the major leap is to understand</p>
<p>how it is possible that a machine can dream,</p>
<p>that a physical system is able to create a representation</p>
<p>that the physical system is acting on,</p>
<p>and that is spun force and so on.</p>
<p>But once you accept the fact that you are not in physics,</p>
<p>but that you exist inside of the story,</p>
<p>I think the mystery disappears.</p>
<p>Everything is possible in the story.</p>
<p>You exist inside the story.</p>
<p>Okay, so the machine.</p>
<p>Your consciousness is being written into the story.</p>
<p>The fact that you experience things</p>
<p>is written to the side of the story.</p>
<p>You ask yourself, is this real what I&rsquo;m seeing?</p>
<p>And your brain writes into the story, yes, it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>So what about the perception of consciousness?</p>
<p>So to me, you look conscious.</p>
<p>So the illusion of consciousness,</p>
<p>the demonstration of consciousness.</p>
<p>I ask for the legged robot.</p>
<p>How do we make this legged robot conscious?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two things,</p>
<p>and maybe you can tell me if they&rsquo;re neighboring ideas.</p>
<p>One is actually make it conscious,</p>
<p>and the other is make it appear conscious to others.</p>
<p>Are those related?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask it from the other direction.</p>
<p>What would it take to make you not conscious?</p>
<p>So when you are thinking about how you perceive the world,</p>
<p>can you decide to switch from looking at qualia</p>
<p>to looking at representational states?</p>
<p>And it turns out you can.</p>
<p>There is a particular way in which you can look at the world</p>
<p>and recognize its machine nature, including your own.</p>
<p>And in that state,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have that conscious experience</p>
<p>in this way anymore.</p>
<p>It becomes apparent as a representation.</p>
<p>Everything becomes opaque.</p>
<p>And I think this thing that you recognize,</p>
<p>everything is a representation.</p>
<p>This is typically what we mean with enlightenment states.</p>
<p>And it can happen on the motivational level,</p>
<p>but you can also do this on the experiential level,</p>
<p>on the perceptual level.</p>
<p>See, but then I can come back to a conscious state.</p>
<p>Okay, I particularly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the social aspect</p>
<p>that the demonstration of consciousness</p>
<p>is a really nice thing at a party</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to meet a new person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice thing to know that they&rsquo;re conscious</p>
<p>and they can,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how fundamental consciousness</p>
<p>is in human interaction,</p>
<p>but it seems like to be at least an important part.</p>
<p>And I ask that in the same kind of way for robots.</p>
<p>In order to create a rich, compelling</p>
<p>human robot interaction,</p>
<p>it feels like there needs to be elements of consciousness</p>
<p>within that interaction.</p>
<p>My cat is obviously conscious.</p>
<p>And so my cat can do this party trick.</p>
<p>She also knows that I am conscious,</p>
<p>be able to have feedback about the fact</p>
<p>that we are both acting on models of our own awareness.</p>
<p>The question is how hard is it for the robot,</p>
<p>artificially created robot to achieve cat level</p>
<p>and party tricks?</p>
<p>Yes, so the issue for me is currently not so much</p>
<p>on how to build a system that creates a story</p>
<p>about a robot that lives in the world,</p>
<p>but to make an adequate representation of the world.</p>
<p>And the model that you and me have is a unified one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one where you basically make sense of everything</p>
<p>that you can perceive.</p>
<p>Every feature in the world that enters your perception</p>
<p>can be relationally mapped to a unified model of everything.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have an AI that is able to construct</p>
<p>such a unified model yet.</p>
<p>So you need that unified model to do the party trick?</p>
<p>Yes, I think that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>if this thing is conscious,</p>
<p>but not in the same universe as you,</p>
<p>because you could not relate to each other.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the process, would you say,</p>
<p>of engineering consciousness in the machine?</p>
<p>Like what are the ideas here?</p>
<p>So you probably want to have some kind of perceptual system.</p>
<p>This perceptual system is a processing agent</p>
<p>that is able to track sensory data</p>
<p>and predict the next frame in the sensory data</p>
<p>from the previous frames of the sensory data</p>
<p>and the current state of the system.</p>
<p>So the current state of the system is, in perception,</p>
<p>instrumental to predicting what happens next.</p>
<p>And this means you build lots and lots of functions</p>
<p>that take all the blips that you feel on your skin</p>
<p>and that you see on your retina, or that you hear,</p>
<p>and puts them into a set of relationships</p>
<p>that allows you to predict what kind of sensory data,</p>
<p>what kind of sensor of blips, vector of blips,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to perceive in the next frame.</p>
<p>This is tuned and it&rsquo;s constantly tuned</p>
<p>until it gets as accurate as it can.</p>
<p>You build a very accurate prediction mechanism</p>
<p>that is step one of the perception.</p>
<p>So first you predict, then you perceive</p>
<p>and see the error in your prediction.</p>
<p>And you have to do two things to make that happen.</p>
<p>One is you have to build a network of relationships</p>
<p>that are constraints,</p>
<p>that take all the variants in the world</p>
<p>and put each of the variances into a variable</p>
<p>that is connected with relationships to other variables.</p>
<p>And these relationships are computable functions</p>
<p>that constrain each other.</p>
<p>So when you see a nose</p>
<p>that points in a certain direction in space,</p>
<p>you have a constraint that says</p>
<p>there should be a face nearby that has the same direction.</p>
<p>And if that is not the case,</p>
<p>you have some kind of contradiction</p>
<p>that you need to resolve</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s probably not a nose what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>It just looks like one.</p>
<p>So you have to reinterpret the data</p>
<p>until you get to a point where your model converges.</p>
<p>And this process of making the sensory data</p>
<p>fit into your model structure</p>
<p>is what Piaget calls the assimilation.</p>
<p>And accommodation is the change of the models</p>
<p>where you change your model in such a way</p>
<p>that you can assimilate everything.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about building</p>
<p>a hell of an awesome perception system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to do prediction and perception</p>
<p>and correct and keep improving.</p>
<p>No, wait, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>So the first thing that we wanted to do</p>
<p>is we want to minimize the contradictions in the model.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s very easy to make a model</p>
<p>in which you minimize the contradictions</p>
<p>just by allowing that it can be</p>
<p>in many, many possible states, right?</p>
<p>So if you increase degrees of freedom,</p>
<p>you will have fewer contradictions.</p>
<p>But you also want to reduce the degrees of freedom</p>
<p>because degrees of freedom mean uncertainty.</p>
<p>You want your model to reduce uncertainty</p>
<p>as much as possible,</p>
<p>but reducing uncertainty is expensive.</p>
<p>So you have to have a trade off</p>
<p>between minimizing contradictions</p>
<p>and reducing uncertainty.</p>
<p>And you have only a finite amount of compute</p>
<p>and experimental time and effort</p>
<p>available to reduce uncertainty in the world.</p>
<p>So you need to assign value to what you observe.</p>
<p>So you need some kind of motivational system</p>
<p>that is estimating what you should be looking at</p>
<p>and what you should be thinking about it,</p>
<p>how you should be applying your resources</p>
<p>to model what that is, right?</p>
<p>So you need to have something like convergence links</p>
<p>that tell you how to get from the present state</p>
<p>of the model to the next one.</p>
<p>You need to have these compatibility links</p>
<p>that tell you which constraints exist</p>
<p>and which constraint violations exist.</p>
<p>And you need to have some kind of motivational system</p>
<p>that tells you what to pay attention to.</p>
<p>So now we have a second agent next to the perceptual agent.</p>
<p>We have a motivational agent.</p>
<p>This is a cybernetic system</p>
<p>that is modeling what the system needs,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s important for the system,</p>
<p>and that interacts with the perceptual system</p>
<p>to maximize the expected reward.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying the motivational system</p>
<p>is some kind of like, what is it?</p>
<p>A high level narrative over some lower level.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just your brainstem stuff,</p>
<p>the limbic system stuff that tells you,</p>
<p>okay, now you should get something to eat</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve just measured your blood sugar.</p>
<p>So you mean like motivational system,</p>
<p>like the lower level stuff, like hungry.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s basically physiological needs</p>
<p>and some cognitive needs and some social needs</p>
<p>and they all interact.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all implemented at different parts</p>
<p>in your nervous system as the motivational system.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re basically cybernetic feedback loops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a lot of code.</p>
<p>And so you now have a motivational agent</p>
<p>that makes your robot go for the ball</p>
<p>or that makes your worm go to eat food and so on.</p>
<p>And you have the perceptual system</p>
<p>that lets it predict the environment</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s able to solve that control problem to some degree.</p>
<p>And now what we learned is that it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to build a machine learning system</p>
<p>that looks at all the data simultaneously</p>
<p>to see what kind of relationships</p>
<p>could exist between them.</p>
<p>So you need to selectively model the world.</p>
<p>You need to figure out where can I make the biggest difference</p>
<p>if I would put the following things together.</p>
<p>Sometimes you find a gradient for that.</p>
<p>When you have a gradient,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to remember where you came from.</p>
<p>You just follow the gradient</p>
<p>until it doesn&rsquo;t get any better.</p>
<p>But if you have a world where the problems are discontinuous</p>
<p>and the search spaces are discontinuous,</p>
<p>you need to retain memory of what you explored.</p>
<p>You need to construct a plan of what to explore next.</p>
<p>And this thing means that you have next</p>
<p>to this perceptual construction system</p>
<p>and the motivational cybernetics,</p>
<p>an agent that is paying attention</p>
<p>to what it should select at any given moment</p>
<p>to maximize reward.</p>
<p>And this scanning system, this attention agent,</p>
<p>is required for consciousness</p>
<p>and consciousness is its control model.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the index memories that this thing retains</p>
<p>when it manipulates the perceptual representations</p>
<p>to maximize the value and minimize the conflicts</p>
<p>and to increase coherence.</p>
<p>So the purpose of consciousness is to create coherence</p>
<p>in your perceptual representations,</p>
<p>remove conflicts, predict the future,</p>
<p>construct counterfactual representations</p>
<p>so you can coordinate your actions and so on.</p>
<p>And in order to do this, it needs to form memories.</p>
<p>These memories are partial binding states</p>
<p>of the working memory contents</p>
<p>that are being revisited later on to backtrack,</p>
<p>to undo certain states, to look for alternatives.</p>
<p>And these index memories that you can recall,</p>
<p>that is what you perceive as your stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>And being able to recall these memories,</p>
<p>this is what makes you conscious.</p>
<p>If you could not remember what you paid attention to,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be conscious.</p>
<p>So consciousness is the index in the memory database.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But let me sneak up to the questions of consciousness</p>
<p>a little further.</p>
<p>So we usually relate suffering to consciousness.</p>
<p>So the capacity to suffer.</p>
<p>I think to me, that&rsquo;s a really strong sign of consciousness</p>
<p>is a thing that can suffer.</p>
<p>How is that useful?</p>
<p>Suffering.</p>
<p>And like in your model where you just described,</p>
<p>which is indexing of memories and what is the coherence</p>
<p>with the perception, with this predictive thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in the perception,</p>
<p>how does suffering relate to any of that?</p>
<p>The higher level suffering that humans do.</p>
<p>Basically pain is a reinforcement signal.</p>
<p>Pain is a signal that one part of your brain</p>
<p>sends to another part of your brain,</p>
<p>or in an abstract sense, part of your mind</p>
<p>sends to another part of the mind to regulate its behavior,</p>
<p>to tell it the behavior that you&rsquo;re currently exhibiting</p>
<p>should be improved.</p>
<p>And this is the signal that I tell you to move away</p>
<p>from what you&rsquo;re currently doing</p>
<p>and push into a different direction.</p>
<p>So pain gives you a part of you an impulse</p>
<p>to do something differently.</p>
<p>But sometimes this doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because the training part of your brain</p>
<p>is talking to the wrong region,</p>
<p>or because it has the wrong model</p>
<p>of the relationships in the world.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re mismodeling yourself</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re mismodeling the relationship of yourself</p>
<p>to the world,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re mismodeling the dynamics of the world.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to improve something</p>
<p>that cannot be improved by generating more pain.</p>
<p>But the system doesn&rsquo;t have any alternative.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t get better.</p>
<p>What do you do if something doesn&rsquo;t get better</p>
<p>and you want it to get better?</p>
<p>You increase the strengths of the signal.</p>
<p>And then the signal becomes chronic</p>
<p>when it becomes permanent without a change inside.</p>
<p>This is what we call suffering.</p>
<p>And the purpose of consciousness</p>
<p>is to deal with contradictions,</p>
<p>with things that cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>The purpose of consciousness,</p>
<p>I think is similar to a conductor in an orchestra.</p>
<p>When everything works well,</p>
<p>the orchestra doesn&rsquo;t need much of a conductor</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s coherent.</p>
<p>But when there is a lack of coherence</p>
<p>or something is consistently producing</p>
<p>disharmony and mismatches,</p>
<p>then the conductor becomes alert and interacts with it.</p>
<p>So suffering attracts the activity of our consciousness.</p>
<p>And the purpose of that is ideally</p>
<p>that we bring new layers online,</p>
<p>new layers of modeling that are able to create</p>
<p>a model of the dysregulation so we can deal with it.</p>
<p>And this means that we typically get</p>
<p>higher level consciousness, so to speak, right?</p>
<p>We get some consciousness above our pay grade maybe</p>
<p>if we have some suffering early in our life.</p>
<p>Most of the interesting people</p>
<p>had trauma early on in their childhood.</p>
<p>And trauma means that you are suffering an injury</p>
<p>for which the system is not prepared,</p>
<p>which it cannot deal with,</p>
<p>which it cannot insulate itself from.</p>
<p>So something breaks.</p>
<p>And this means that the behavior of the system</p>
<p>is permanently disturbed in a way</p>
<p>that some mismatch exists now in the regulation</p>
<p>that just by following your impulses,</p>
<p>by following the pain in the direction where it hurts,</p>
<p>the situation doesn&rsquo;t improve but get worse.</p>
<p>And so what needs to happen is that you grow up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part that has grown up</p>
<p>is able to deal with the part</p>
<p>that is stuck in this earlier phase.</p>
<p>Yeah, so at least to grow,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re adding extra layers to your cognition.</p>
<p>And let me ask you then,</p>
<p>because I gotta stick on suffering,</p>
<p>the ethics of the whole thing.</p>
<p>So not our consciousness, but the consciousness of others.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve tweeted, one of my biggest fears</p>
<p>is that insects could be conscious.</p>
<p>The amount of suffering on earth would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>So when we think of other conscious beings,</p>
<p>is suffering a property of consciousness</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re most concerned about?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still thinking about robots,</p>
<p>how to make sense of other nonhuman things</p>
<p>that appear to have the depth of experience</p>
<p>that humans have.</p>
<p>And to me, that means consciousness</p>
<p>and the darkest side of that, which is suffering,</p>
<p>the capacity to suffer.</p>
<p>And so I started thinking,</p>
<p>how much responsibility do we have</p>
<p>for those other conscious beings?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the definition of consciousness</p>
<p>becomes most urgent.</p>
<p>Like having to come up with a definition of consciousness</p>
<p>becomes most urgent,</p>
<p>is who should we and should we not be torturing?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no general answer to this.</p>
<p>Was Genghis Khan doing anything wrong?</p>
<p>It depends right on how you look at it.</p>
<p>Well, he drew a line somewhere</p>
<p>where this is us and that&rsquo;s them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the circle of empathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to use the word consciousness,</p>
<p>but these are the things that matter to me</p>
<p>if they suffer or not.</p>
<p>And these are the things that don&rsquo;t matter to him.</p>
<p>Yeah, but when one of his commanders failed him,</p>
<p>he broke his spine and let him die in a horrible way.</p>
<p>And so in some sense,</p>
<p>I think he was indifferent to suffering</p>
<p>or he was not different in the sense</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t see it as useful if he inflicted suffering,</p>
<p>but he did not see it as something that had to be avoided.</p>
<p>That was not the goal.</p>
<p>The question was, how can I use suffering</p>
<p>and the infliction of suffering to reach my goals</p>
<p>from his perspective?</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So like different societies throughout history</p>
<p>put different value on the&hellip;</p>
<p>Different individuals, different psyches.</p>
<p>But also even the objective of avoiding suffering,</p>
<p>like some societies probably,</p>
<p>I mean, this is where like religious belief really helps</p>
<p>that afterlife, that it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>that you suffer or die,</p>
<p>what matters is you suffer honorably, right?</p>
<p>So that you enter the afterlife as a hero.</p>
<p>It seems to be superstitious to me,</p>
<p>basically beliefs that assert things</p>
<p>for which no evidence exists</p>
<p>are incompatible with sound epistemology.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that religion has to be superstitious,</p>
<p>otherwise it should be condemned in all cases.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s saying we live in a dream world,</p>
<p>we have zero evidence for anything.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>There are limits to what languages can be constructed.</p>
<p>Mathematics brings solid evidence for its own structure.</p>
<p>And once we have some idea of what languages exist</p>
<p>and how a system can learn</p>
<p>and what learning itself is in the first place.</p>
<p>And so we can begin to realize that our intuitions</p>
<p>that we are able to learn about the regularities</p>
<p>of the world and minimize surprise</p>
<p>and understand the nature of our own agency</p>
<p>to some degree of abstraction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an illusion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a useful approximation.</p>
<p>Just because we live in a dream world</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean mathematics can&rsquo;t give us a consistent glimpse</p>
<p>of physical, of objective reality.</p>
<p>We can basically distinguish useful encodings</p>
<p>from useless encodings.</p>
<p>And when we apply our truth seeking to the world,</p>
<p>we know we usually cannot find out</p>
<p>whether a certain thing is true.</p>
<p>What we typically do is we take the state vector</p>
<p>of the universe separated into separate objects</p>
<p>that interact with each other through interfaces.</p>
<p>And this distinction that we are making</p>
<p>is not completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done to optimize the compression</p>
<p>that we can apply to our models of the universe.</p>
<p>So we can predict what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with our limited resources.</p>
<p>In this sense, it&rsquo;s not arbitrary.</p>
<p>But the separation of the world into objects</p>
<p>that are somehow discrete and interacting with each other</p>
<p>is not the true reality, right?</p>
<p>The boundaries between the objects</p>
<p>are projected into the world, not arbitrarily projected.</p>
<p>But still, it&rsquo;s only an approximation</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s actually the case.</p>
<p>And we sometimes notice that we run into contradictions</p>
<p>when we try to understand high level things</p>
<p>like economic aspects of the world</p>
<p>and so on, or political aspects, or psychological aspects</p>
<p>where we make simplifications.</p>
<p>And the objects that we are using to separate the world</p>
<p>are just one of many possible projections</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, in this postmodernist sense,</p>
<p>completely arbitrary, and you&rsquo;re free to pick</p>
<p>what you want or dismiss what you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all stories.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>You have to show for every model</p>
<p>of how well it predicts the world.</p>
<p>So the confidence that you should have</p>
<p>in the entities of your models</p>
<p>should correspond to the evidence that you have.</p>
<p>Can I ask you on a small tangent</p>
<p>to talk about your favorite set of ideas and people,</p>
<p>which is postmodernism.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What is postmodernism?</p>
<p>How would you define it?</p>
<p>And why to you is it not a useful framework of thought?</p>
<p>Postmodernism is something that I&rsquo;m really not an expert on.</p>
<p>And postmodernism is a set of philosophical ideas</p>
<p>that is difficult to lump together,</p>
<p>that is characterized by some useful thinkers,</p>
<p>some of them poststructuralists and so on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m mostly not interested in it</p>
<p>because I think that it&rsquo;s not leading me anywhere</p>
<p>that I find particularly useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly, I think, born out of the insight</p>
<p>that the ontologies that we impose on the world</p>
<p>are not literally true.</p>
<p>And that we can often get to a different interpretation</p>
<p>by the world by using a different ontology</p>
<p>that is different separation of the world</p>
<p>into interacting objects.</p>
<p>But the idea that this makes the world a set of stories</p>
<p>that are arbitrary, I think, is wrong.</p>
<p>And the people that are engaging in this type of philosophy</p>
<p>are working in an area that I largely don&rsquo;t find productive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing useful coming out of this.</p>
<p>So this idea that truth is relative</p>
<p>is not something that has, in some sense,</p>
<p>informed physics or theory of relativity.</p>
<p>And there is no feedback between those.</p>
<p>There is no meaningful information</p>
<p>of this type of philosophy on the sciences</p>
<p>or on engineering or in politics.</p>
<p>But there is a very strong information on ideology</p>
<p>because it basically has become an ideology</p>
<p>that is justifying itself by the notion</p>
<p>that truth is a relative concept.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not being used in such a way</p>
<p>that the philosophers or sociologists</p>
<p>that take up these ideas say,</p>
<p>oh, I should doubt my own ideas because maybe my separation of the world</p>
<p>into objects is not completely valid.</p>
<p>And I should maybe use a different one</p>
<p>and be open to a pluralism of ideas.</p>
<p>But it mostly exists to dismiss the ideas of other people.</p>
<p>It becomes, yeah, it becomes a political weapon of sorts</p>
<p>to achieve power.</p>
<p>Basically, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong, I think,</p>
<p>with developing a philosophy around this.</p>
<p>But to develop a philosophy around this,</p>
<p>to develop norms around the idea</p>
<p>that truth is something that is completely negotiable,</p>
<p>is incompatible with the scientific project.</p>
<p>And I think if the academia has no defense</p>
<p>against the ideological parts of the postmodernist movement,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doomed.</p>
<p>Right, you have to acknowledge the ideological part</p>
<p>of any movement, actually, including postmodernism.</p>
<p>Well, the question is what an ideology is.</p>
<p>And to me, an ideology is basically a viral memeplex</p>
<p>that is changing your mind in such a way that reality gets warped.</p>
<p>It gets warped in such a way that you&rsquo;re being cut off</p>
<p>from the rest of human thought space.</p>
<p>And you cannot consider things outside of the range of ideas</p>
<p>of your own ideology as possibly true.</p>
<p>Right, so, I mean, there&rsquo;s certain properties to an ideology</p>
<p>that make it harmful.</p>
<p>One of them is that dogmatism of just certainty,</p>
<p>dogged certainty in that you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>you have the truth, and nobody else does.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what is creating the certainty?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to look at the type of model</p>
<p>that is being produced.</p>
<p>Is it basically just a strong prior, and you tell people,</p>
<p>oh, this idea that you consider to be very true,</p>
<p>the evidence for this is actually just much weaker</p>
<p>than you thought, and look, here are some studies.</p>
<p>No, this is not how it works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually normative, which means some thoughts</p>
<p>are unthinkable because they would change your identity</p>
<p>into something that is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>And this cuts you off from considering an alternative.</p>
<p>And many de facto religions use this trick</p>
<p>to lock people into a certain mode of thought,</p>
<p>and this removes agency over your own thoughts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very ugly to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically not just a process of domestication,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually an intellectual castration</p>
<p>that happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an inability to think creatively</p>
<p>and to bring forth new thoughts.</p>
<p>I can ask you about substances, chemical substances</p>
<p>that affect the video game, the dream world.</p>
<p>So psychedelics that increasingly have been getting</p>
<p>a lot of research done on them.</p>
<p>So in general, psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA,</p>
<p>but also a really interesting one, the big one, which is DMT.</p>
<p>What and where are the places that these substances</p>
<p>take the mind that is operating in the dream world?</p>
<p>Do you have an interesting sense how this throws a wrinkle</p>
<p>into the prediction model?</p>
<p>Is it just some weird little quirk</p>
<p>or is there some fundamental expansion</p>
<p>of the mind going on?</p>
<p>I suspect that a way to look at psychedelics</p>
<p>is that they induce particular types</p>
<p>of lucid dreaming states.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a state in which certain connections</p>
<p>are being severed in your mind.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re no longer active.</p>
<p>Your mind basically gets free to move in a certain direction</p>
<p>because some inhibition, some particular inhibition</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
<p>And as a result, you might stop having a self</p>
<p>or you might stop perceiving the world as three dimensional.</p>
<p>And you can explore that state.</p>
<p>And I suppose that for every state</p>
<p>that can be induced with psychedelics,</p>
<p>there are people that are naturally in that state.</p>
<p>So sometimes psychedelics to shift you</p>
<p>through a range of possible mental states.</p>
<p>And they can also shift you out of the range</p>
<p>of permissible mental states</p>
<p>that is where you can make predictive models of reality.</p>
<p>And what I observe in people that use psychedelics a lot</p>
<p>is that they tend to be overfitting.</p>
<p>Overfitting means that you are using more bits</p>
<p>for modeling the dynamics of a function than you should.</p>
<p>And so you can fit your curve</p>
<p>to extremely detailed things in the past,</p>
<p>but this model is no longer predictive for the future.</p>
<p>What is it about psychedelics that forces that?</p>
<p>I thought it would be the opposite.</p>
<p>I thought that it&rsquo;s a good mechanism</p>
<p>for generalization, for regularization.</p>
<p>So it feels like psychedelics expansion of the mind,</p>
<p>like taking you outside of,</p>
<p>like forcing your model to be non predictive</p>
<p>is a good thing.</p>
<p>Meaning like, it&rsquo;s almost like, okay,</p>
<p>what I would say psychedelics are akin to</p>
<p>is traveling to a totally different environment.</p>
<p>Like going, if you&rsquo;ve never been to like India</p>
<p>or something like that from the United States,</p>
<p>very different set of people, different culture,</p>
<p>different food, different roads and values</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, so psychedelics can, for instance,</p>
<p>teleport people into a universe that is hyperbolic,</p>
<p>which means that if you imagine a room that you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>you can turn around 360 degrees</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t go full circle.</p>
<p>You need to go 720 degrees to go full circle.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So the things that people learn in that state</p>
<p>cannot be easily transferred</p>
<p>in this universe that we are in.</p>
<p>It could be that if they&rsquo;re able to abstract</p>
<p>and understand what happened to them,</p>
<p>that they understand that some part</p>
<p>of their spatial cognition has been desynchronized</p>
<p>and has found a different synchronization.</p>
<p>And this different synchronization</p>
<p>happens to be a hyperbolic one, right?</p>
<p>So you learn something interesting about your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to understand what exactly happened,</p>
<p>but we get a pretty good idea</p>
<p>once we understand how the brain is representing geometry.</p>
<p>Yeah, but doesn&rsquo;t it give you a fresh perspective</p>
<p>on the physical reality?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s making that sound?</p>
<p>Is it inside my head or is it external?</p>
<p>Well, there is no sound outside of your mind,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s making sense of phenomenon physics.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the physical reality, there&rsquo;s sound waves</p>
<p>traveling through air.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our model of what happened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our model of what happened, right.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Psychedelics give you a fresh perspective</p>
<p>on this physical reality?</p>
<p>Like, not this physical reality, but this more&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you call the dream world that&rsquo;s mapped directly to&hellip;</p>
<p>The purpose of dreaming at night, I think,</p>
<p>is data augmentation.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very similar to Psychedelics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changed parameters about the things that you have learned.</p>
<p>And, for instance, when you are young,</p>
<p>you have seen things from certain perspectives,</p>
<p>but not from others.</p>
<p>So your brain is generating new perspectives of objects</p>
<p>that you already know,</p>
<p>which means you can learn to recognize them later</p>
<p>from different perspectives.</p>
<p>And I suspect that&rsquo;s the reason that many of us</p>
<p>remember to have flying dreams as children,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just different perspectives of the world</p>
<p>that you already know,</p>
<p>and that it starts to generate these different</p>
<p>perspective changes,</p>
<p>and then it fluidly turns this into a flying dream</p>
<p>to make sense of what&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>So you fill in the gaps,</p>
<p>and suddenly you see yourself flying.</p>
<p>And similar things can happen with semantic relationships.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just spatial relationships,</p>
<p>but it can also be the relationships between ideas</p>
<p>that are being changed.</p>
<p>And it seems that the mechanisms that make that happen</p>
<p>during dreaming are interacting</p>
<p>with these same receptors</p>
<p>that are being stimulated by psychedelics.</p>
<p>So I suspect that there is a thing</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t read really about.</p>
<p>The way in which dreams are induced in the brain</p>
<p>is not just that the activity of the brain gets tuned down</p>
<p>because your eyes are closed</p>
<p>and you no longer get enough data from your eyes,</p>
<p>but there is a particular type of neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that is saturating your brain during these phases,</p>
<p>during the REM phases, and you produce</p>
<p>controlled hallucinations.</p>
<p>And psychedelics are linking into these mechanisms,</p>
<p>I suspect.</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t that another trickier form of data augmentation?</p>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s also data augmentation</p>
<p>that can happen outside of the specification</p>
<p>that your brain is tuned to.</p>
<p>So basically people are overclocking their brains</p>
<p>and that produces states</p>
<p>that are subjectively extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just.</p>
<p>But from the outside, very suspicious.</p>
<p>So I think I&rsquo;m over applying the metaphor</p>
<p>of a neural network in my own mind,</p>
<p>which I just think that doesn&rsquo;t lead to overfitting, right?</p>
<p>But you were just sort of anecdotally saying</p>
<p>my experiences with people that have done psychedelics</p>
<p>are that kind of quality.</p>
<p>I think it typically happens.</p>
<p>So if you look at people like Timothy Leary,</p>
<p>and he has written beautiful manifestos</p>
<p>about the effect of LSD on people.</p>
<p>He genuinely believed, he writes in these manifestos,</p>
<p>that in the future, science and art</p>
<p>will only be done on psychedelics</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so much more efficient and so much better.</p>
<p>And he gave LSD to children in this community</p>
<p>of a few thousand people that he had near San Francisco.</p>
<p>And basically he was losing touch with reality.</p>
<p>He did not understand the effects</p>
<p>that the things that he was doing</p>
<p>would have on the reception of psychedelics</p>
<p>by society because he was unable to think critically</p>
<p>about what happened.</p>
<p>What happened was that he got in a euphoric state,</p>
<p>that euphoric state happened because he was overfitting.</p>
<p>He was taking this sense of euphoria</p>
<p>and translating it into a model</p>
<p>of actual success in the world, right?</p>
<p>He was feeling better.</p>
<p>Limitations had disappeared,</p>
<p>that he experienced to be existing,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t get superpowers.</p>
<p>I understand what you mean by overfitting now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interpretation to the term</p>
<p>overfitting in this case, but I got you.</p>
<p>So he was getting positive rewards</p>
<p>from a lot of actions that he shouldn&rsquo;t have been doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not just this.</p>
<p>So if you take, for instance, John Lilly,</p>
<p>who was studying dolphin languages and aliens and so on,</p>
<p>a lot of people that use psychedelics became very loopy.</p>
<p>And the typical thing that you notice</p>
<p>when people are on psychedelics is that they are in a state</p>
<p>where they feel that everything can be explained now.</p>
<p>Everything is clear, everything is obvious.</p>
<p>And sometimes they have indeed discovered</p>
<p>a useful connection, but not always.</p>
<p>Very often these connections are overinterpretations.</p>
<p>I wonder, you know, there&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>of correlation versus causation.</p>
<p>And also I wonder if it&rsquo;s the psychedelics</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s more the social, like being the outsider</p>
<p>and having a strong community of outside</p>
<p>and having a leadership position in an outsider cult</p>
<p>like community that could have a much stronger effect</p>
<p>of overfitting than do psychedelics themselves,</p>
<p>the actual substances, because it&rsquo;s a counterculture thing.</p>
<p>So it could be that as opposed to the actual substance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a boring person who wears a suit and tie</p>
<p>and works at a bank and takes psychedelics,</p>
<p>that could be a very different effect</p>
<p>of psychedelics on your mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just sort of raising the point</p>
<p>that the people you referenced are already weirdos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly.</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>A lot of the people that tell me</p>
<p>that they use psychedelics in a useful way</p>
<p>started out as squares and were liberating themselves</p>
<p>because they were stuck.</p>
<p>They were basically stuck in local optimum</p>
<p>of their own self model, of their relationship to the world.</p>
<p>And suddenly they had data augmentation.</p>
<p>They basically saw and experienced a space of possibilities.</p>
<p>They experienced what it would be like to be another person.</p>
<p>And they took important lessons</p>
<p>from that experience back home.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I love the metaphor of data augmentation</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s been the primary driver</p>
<p>of self supervised learning in the computer vision domain</p>
<p>is data augmentation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny to think of data augmentation,</p>
<p>like chemically induced data augmentation in the human mind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a very interesting effect that I noticed.</p>
<p>I know several people who are sphere to me</p>
<p>that LSD has cured their migraines.</p>
<p>So severe cluster headaches or migraines</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t respond to standard medication</p>
<p>that disappeared after a single dose.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t recommend anybody doing this,</p>
<p>especially not in the US where it&rsquo;s illegal.</p>
<p>And there are no studies on this for that reason.</p>
<p>But it seems that anecdotally</p>
<p>that it basically can reset the serotonergic system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically pushing them</p>
<p>outside of their normal boundaries.</p>
<p>And as a result, it needs to find a new equilibrium.</p>
<p>And in some people that equilibrium is better,</p>
<p>but it also follows that in other people it might be worse.</p>
<p>So if you have a brain that is already teetering</p>
<p>on the boundary to psychosis,</p>
<p>it can be permanently pushed over that boundary.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why you have to do good science,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re starting to do on all these different</p>
<p>substances of how well it actually works</p>
<p>for the different conditions like MDMA seems to help</p>
<p>with PTSD, same with psilocybin.</p>
<p>You need to do good science,</p>
<p>meaning large studies of large N.</p>
<p>Yeah, so based on the existing studies of MDMA,</p>
<p>it seems that if you look at Rick Doblin&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>and what he has published about this and talks about,</p>
<p>MDMA seems to be a psychologically relatively safe drug.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s physiologically not very safe.</p>
<p>That is, there is neurotoxicity</p>
<p>if you would use a too large dose.</p>
<p>And if you combine this with alcohol,</p>
<p>which a lot of kids do in party settings during raves</p>
<p>and so on, it&rsquo;s very hepatotoxic.</p>
<p>So basically you can kill your liver.</p>
<p>And this means that it&rsquo;s probably something that is best</p>
<p>and most productively used in a clinical setting</p>
<p>by people who really know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I suspect that&rsquo;s also true for the other psychedelics</p>
<p>that is while the other psychedelics are probably not</p>
<p>as toxic as say alcohol,</p>
<p>the effects on the psyche can be much more profound</p>
<p>and lasting.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, as far as I know psilocybin,</p>
<p>so mushrooms, magic mushrooms,</p>
<p>as far as I know in terms of the studies they&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>I think have no, like they&rsquo;re allowed to do</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re calling heroic doses.</p>
<p>So that one does not have a toxicity.</p>
<p>So they could do like huge doses in a clinical setting</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re doing study on psilocybin,</p>
<p>which is kind of fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems that most of the psychedelics</p>
<p>work in extremely small doses,</p>
<p>which means that the effect on the rest of the body</p>
<p>is relatively low.</p>
<p>And MDMA is probably the exception.</p>
<p>Maybe ketamine can be dangerous in larger doses</p>
<p>because it can depress breathing and so on.</p>
<p>But the LSD and psilocybin work in very, very small doses,</p>
<p>at least the active part of them,</p>
<p>of psilocybin LSD is only the active part.</p>
<p>And the, but the effect that it can have</p>
<p>on your mental wiring can be very dangerous, I think.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about AI a little bit.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about GPT3 and language models</p>
<p>trained with self supervised learning?</p>
<p>It came out quite a bit ago,</p>
<p>but I wanted to get your thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In the nineties, I was in New Zealand</p>
<p>and I had an amazing professor, Ian Witten,</p>
<p>who realized I was bored in class and put me in his lab.</p>
<p>And he gave me the task to discover grammatical structure</p>
<p>in an unknown language.</p>
<p>And the unknown language that I picked was English</p>
<p>because it was the easiest one</p>
<p>to find a corpus for construct one.</p>
<p>And he gave me the largest computer at the whole university.</p>
<p>It had two gigabytes of RAM, which was amazing.</p>
<p>And I wrote everything in C</p>
<p>with some in memory compression to do statistics</p>
<p>over the language.</p>
<p>And I first would create a dictionary of all the words,</p>
<p>which basically tokenizes everything and compresses things</p>
<p>so that I don&rsquo;t need to store the whole word,</p>
<p>but just a code for every word.</p>
<p>And then I was taking this all apart in sentences</p>
<p>and I was trying to find all the relationships</p>
<p>between all the words in the sentences</p>
<p>and do statistics over them.</p>
<p>And that proved to be impossible</p>
<p>because the complexity is just too large.</p>
<p>So if you want to discover the relationship</p>
<p>between an article and a noun,</p>
<p>and there are three adjectives in between,</p>
<p>you cannot do ngram statistics</p>
<p>and look at all the possibilities that can exist,</p>
<p>at least not with the resources that we had back then.</p>
<p>So I realized I need to make some statistics</p>
<p>over what I need to make statistics over.</p>
<p>So I wrote something that was pretty much a hack</p>
<p>that did this for at least first order relationships.</p>
<p>And I came up with some kind of mutual information graph</p>
<p>that was indeed discovering something that looks exactly</p>
<p>like the grammatical structure of the sentence,</p>
<p>just by trying to encode the sentence</p>
<p>in such a way that the words would be written</p>
<p>in the optimal order inside of the model.</p>
<p>And what I also found is that if we would be able</p>
<p>to increase the resolution of that</p>
<p>and not just use this model</p>
<p>to reproduce grammatically correct sentences,</p>
<p>we would also be able</p>
<p>to correct stylistically correct sentences</p>
<p>by just having more bits in these relationships.</p>
<p>And if we wanted to have meaning,</p>
<p>we would have to go much higher order.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know how to make higher order models back then</p>
<p>without spending way more years in research</p>
<p>on how to make the statistics</p>
<p>over what we need to make statistics over.</p>
<p>And this thing that we cannot look at the relationships</p>
<p>between all the bits in your input is being solved</p>
<p>in different domains in different ways.</p>
<p>So in computer graphics, computer vision,</p>
<p>standard methods for many years now</p>
<p>is convolutional neural networks.</p>
<p>Convolutional neural networks are hierarchies of filters</p>
<p>that exploit the fact that neighboring pixels</p>
<p>in images are usually semantically related</p>
<p>and distance pixels in images</p>
<p>are usually not semantically related.</p>
<p>So you can just by grouping the pixels</p>
<p>that are next to each other,</p>
<p>hierarchically together reconstruct the shape of objects.</p>
<p>And this is an important prior</p>
<p>that we built into these models</p>
<p>so they can converge quickly.</p>
<p>But this doesn&rsquo;t work in language</p>
<p>for the reason that adjacent words are often</p>
<p>but not always related and distant words</p>
<p>are sometimes related while the words in between are not.</p>
<p>So how can you learn the topology of language?</p>
<p>And I think for this reason that this difficulty existed,</p>
<p>the transformer was invented</p>
<p>in natural language processing, not in vision.</p>
<p>And what the transformer is doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hierarchy of layers where every layer learns</p>
<p>what to pay attention to in the given context</p>
<p>in the previous layer.</p>
<p>So what to make the statistics over.</p>
<p>And the context is significantly larger</p>
<p>than the adjacent word.</p>
<p>Yes, so the context that GPT3 has been using,</p>
<p>the transformer itself is from 2017</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t using that large of a context.</p>
<p>OpenAI has basically scaled up this idea</p>
<p>as far as they could at the time.</p>
<p>And the context is about 2048 symbols,</p>
<p>tokens in the language.</p>
<p>These symbols are not characters,</p>
<p>but they take the words and project them</p>
<p>into a vector space where words</p>
<p>that are statistically co occurring a lot</p>
<p>are neighbors already.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s already a simplification</p>
<p>of the problem a little bit.</p>
<p>And so every word is basically a set of coordinates</p>
<p>in a high dimensional space.</p>
<p>And then they use some kind of trick</p>
<p>to also encode the order of the words in a sentence</p>
<p>or in the not just sentence,</p>
<p>but 2048 tokens is about a couple of pages of text</p>
<p>or two and a half pages of text.</p>
<p>And so they managed to do pretty exhaustive statistics</p>
<p>over the potential relationships</p>
<p>between two pages of text, which is tremendous.</p>
<p>I was just using a single sentence back then.</p>
<p>And I was only looking for first order relationships.</p>
<p>And they were really looking</p>
<p>for much, much higher level relationships.</p>
<p>And what they discover after they fed this</p>
<p>with an enormous amount of training,</p>
<p>they are pretty much the written internet</p>
<p>or a subset of it that had some quality,</p>
<p>but substantial portion of the common core</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not only able to reproduce style,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also able to reproduce</p>
<p>some pretty detailed semantics,</p>
<p>like being able to add three digit numbers</p>
<p>and multiply two digit numbers</p>
<p>or to translate between programming languages</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So the results that GPT3 got, I think were amazing.</p>
<p>By the way, I actually didn&rsquo;t check carefully.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny you just mentioned</p>
<p>how you coupled semantics to the multiplication.</p>
<p>Is it able to do some basic math on two digit numbers?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, interesting.</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s a lot of failure cases.</p>
<p>Yeah, it basically fails if you take larger digit numbers.</p>
<p>So four digit numbers and so on makes carrying mistakes</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And if you take larger numbers,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get useful results at all.</p>
<p>And this could be an issue of the training set</p>
<p>where there are not many examples</p>
<p>of successful long form addition</p>
<p>and standard human written text.</p>
<p>And humans aren&rsquo;t very good</p>
<p>at doing three digit numbers either.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re not writing a lot about it.</p>
<p>And the other thing is that the loss function</p>
<p>that is being used is only minimizing surprise.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s predicting what comes next in the typical text.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not trying to go for causal closure first</p>
<p>as we do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the fact that that kind of prediction works</p>
<p>to generate text that&rsquo;s semantically rich</p>
<p>and consistent is interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, so it&rsquo;s amazing that it&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to generate semantically consistent text.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not consistent.</p>
<p>So the problem is that it loses coherence at some point,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also, I think, not correct to say</p>
<p>that GPT3 is unable to deal with semantics at all</p>
<p>because you ask it to perform certain transformations</p>
<p>in text and it performs these transformation in text.</p>
<p>And the kind of additions that it&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to perform are transformations in text, right?</p>
<p>And there are proper semantics involved.</p>
<p>You can also do more.</p>
<p>There was a paper that was generating lots</p>
<p>and lots of mathematically correct text</p>
<p>and was feeding this into a transformer.</p>
<p>And as a result, it was able to learn</p>
<p>how to do differentiation integration in race</p>
<p>that according to the authors, Mathematica could not.</p>
<p>To which some of the people in Mathematica responded</p>
<p>that they were not using Mathematica in the right way</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I have not really followed the resolution of this conflict.</p>
<p>This part, as a small tangent,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like in machine learning papers,</p>
<p>which they often do anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll find like one example</p>
<p>in some kind of specific use of Mathematica</p>
<p>and demonstrate, look, here&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll show successes and failures,</p>
<p>but they won&rsquo;t have a very clear representation</p>
<p>of how many cases this actually represents.</p>
<p>Yes, but I think as a first paper,</p>
<p>this is a pretty good start.</p>
<p>And so the take home message, I think,</p>
<p>is that the authors could get better results</p>
<p>from this in their experiments</p>
<p>than they could get from the vein,</p>
<p>which they were using computer algebra systems,</p>
<p>which means that was not nothing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s able to perform substantially better</p>
<p>than GPT&rsquo;s V can based on a much larger amount</p>
<p>of training data using the same underlying algorithm.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask, again,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m using your tweets as if this is like Plato, right?</p>
<p>As if this is well thought out novels that you&rsquo;ve written.</p>
<p>You tweeted, GPT4 is listening to us now.</p>
<p>This is one way of asking,</p>
<p>what are the limitations of GPT3 when it scales?</p>
<p>So what do you think will be the capabilities</p>
<p>of GPT4, GPT5, and so on?</p>
<p>What are the limits of this approach?</p>
<p>So obviously when we are writing things right now,</p>
<p>everything that we are writing now</p>
<p>is going to be training data</p>
<p>for the next generation of machine learning models.</p>
<p>So yes, of course, GPT4 is listening to us.</p>
<p>And I think the tweet is already a little bit older</p>
<p>and we now have Voodao</p>
<p>and we have a number of other systems</p>
<p>that basically are placeholders for GPT4.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know what open AIS plans are in this regard.</p>
<p>I read that tweet in several ways.</p>
<p>So one is obviously everything you put on the internet</p>
<p>is used as training data.</p>
<p>But in a second way I read it is in a,</p>
<p>we talked about agency.</p>
<p>I read it as almost like GPT4 is intelligent enough</p>
<p>to be choosing to listen.</p>
<p>So not only like did a programmer tell it</p>
<p>to collect this data and use it for training,</p>
<p>I almost saw the humorous angle,</p>
<p>which is like it has achieved AGI kind of thing.</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, could we be already be living in GPT5?</p>
<p>So GPT4 is listening and GPT5 actually constructing</p>
<p>the entirety of the reality where we&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, in some sense,</p>
<p>what everybody is trying to do right now in AI</p>
<p>is to extend the transformer to be able to deal with video.</p>
<p>And there are very promising extensions, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a work by Google that is called Perceiver</p>
<p>and that is overcoming some of the limitations</p>
<p>of the transformer by letting it learn the topology</p>
<p>of the different modalities separately.</p>
<p>And by training it to find better input features.</p>
<p>So basically feature abstractions that are being used</p>
<p>by this successor to GPT3 are chosen such a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s able to deal with video input.</p>
<p>And there is more to be done.</p>
<p>So one of the limitations of GPT3 is that it&rsquo;s amnesiac.</p>
<p>So it forgets everything beyond the two pages</p>
<p>that it currently reads also during generation,</p>
<p>not just during learning.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s fixable</p>
<p>within the space of deep learning?</p>
<p>Can you just make a bigger, bigger, bigger input?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think that our own working memory</p>
<p>is infinitely large.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably also just a few thousand bits.</p>
<p>But what you can do is you can structure</p>
<p>this working memory.</p>
<p>So instead of just force feeding this thing,</p>
<p>a certain thing that it has to focus on,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not allowed to focus on anything else</p>
<p>as its network,</p>
<p>you allow it to construct its own working memory as we do.</p>
<p>When we are reading a book,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that we are focusing our attention</p>
<p>in such a way that we can only remember the current page.</p>
<p>We will also try to remember other pages</p>
<p>and try to undo what we learned from them</p>
<p>or modify what we learned from them.</p>
<p>We might get up and take another book from the shelf.</p>
<p>We might go out and ask somebody,</p>
<p>we can edit our working memory in any way that is useful</p>
<p>to put a context together that allows us</p>
<p>to draw the right inferences and to learn the right things.</p>
<p>So this ability to perform experiments on the world</p>
<p>based on an attempt to become fully coherent</p>
<p>and to achieve causal closure,</p>
<p>to achieve a certain aesthetic of your modeling,</p>
<p>that is something that eventually needs to be done.</p>
<p>And at the moment we are skirting this in some sense</p>
<p>by building systems that are larger and faster</p>
<p>so they can use dramatically larger resources</p>
<p>and human beings can do and much more training data</p>
<p>to get to models that in some sense</p>
<p>are already way superhuman</p>
<p>and in other ways are laughingly incoherent.</p>
<p>So do you think sort of making the systems like,</p>
<p>what would you say, multi resolutional?</p>
<p>So like some of the language models</p>
<p>are focused on two pages,</p>
<p>some are focused on two books,</p>
<p>some are focused on two years of reading,</p>
<p>some are focused on a lifetime,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like stacks of GPT3s all the way down.</p>
<p>You want to have gaps in between them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily two years, there&rsquo;s no gaps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s things out of two years or out of 20 years</p>
<p>or 2,000 years or 2 billion years</p>
<p>where you are just selecting those bits</p>
<p>that are predicted to be the most useful ones</p>
<p>to understand what you&rsquo;re currently doing.</p>
<p>And this prediction itself requires a very complicated model</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the actual model that you need to be making.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that you are trying to understand</p>
<p>the relationships between things,</p>
<p>but what you need to make relationships,</p>
<p>discover relationships over.</p>
<p>I wonder what that thing looks like,</p>
<p>what the architecture for the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to have that kind of model.</p>
<p>I think it needs more degrees of freedom</p>
<p>than the current models have.</p>
<p>So it starts out with the fact that you possibly</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just want to have a feed forward model,</p>
<p>but you want it to be fully recurrent.</p>
<p>And to make it fully recurrent,</p>
<p>you probably need to loop it back into itself</p>
<p>and allow it to skip connections.</p>
<p>Once you do this,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re predicting the next frame</p>
<p>and your internal next frame in every moment,</p>
<p>and you are able to skip connection,</p>
<p>it means that signals can travel from the output</p>
<p>of the network into the middle of the network</p>
<p>faster than the inputs do.</p>
<p>Do you think it can still be differentiable?</p>
<p>Do you think it still can be a neural network?</p>
<p>Sometimes it can and sometimes it cannot.</p>
<p>So it can still be a neural network,</p>
<p>but not a fully differentiable one.</p>
<p>And when you want to deal with non differentiable ones,</p>
<p>you need to have an attention system</p>
<p>that is discreet and two dimensional</p>
<p>and can perform grammatical operations.</p>
<p>You need to be able to perform program synthesis.</p>
<p>You need to be able to backtrack</p>
<p>in this operations that you perform on this thing.</p>
<p>And this thing needs a model of what it&rsquo;s currently doing.</p>
<p>And I think this is exactly the purpose</p>
<p>of our own consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, the program things are tricky on neural networks.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, it&rsquo;s not quite program synthesis,</p>
<p>but the application of these language models</p>
<p>to generation, to program synthesis,</p>
<p>but generation of programs.</p>
<p>So if you look at GitHub OpenPilot,</p>
<p>which is based on OpenAI&rsquo;s codecs,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you got a chance to look at it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the system that&rsquo;s able to generate code</p>
<p>once you prompt it with, what is it?</p>
<p>Like the header of a function with some comments.</p>
<p>And it seems to do an incredibly good job</p>
<p>or not a perfect job, which is very important,</p>
<p>but an incredibly good job of generating functions.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>Are you, is this exciting</p>
<p>or is this just a party trick, a demo?</p>
<p>Or is this revolutionary?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t worked with it yet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s difficult for me to judge it,</p>
<p>but I would not be surprised</p>
<p>if it turns out to be a revolutionary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the majority of programming tasks</p>
<p>that are being done in the industry right now</p>
<p>are not creative.</p>
<p>People are writing code that other people have written,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re putting things together from code fragments</p>
<p>that others have had.</p>
<p>And a lot of the work that programmers do in practice</p>
<p>is to figure out how to overcome the gaps</p>
<p>in their current knowledge</p>
<p>and the things that people have already done.</p>
<p>How to copy and paste from Stack Overflow, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so of course we can automate that.</p>
<p>Yeah, to make it much faster to copy and paste</p>
<p>from Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s not just copying and pasting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also basically learning which parts you need to modify</p>
<p>to make them fit together.</p>
<p>Yeah, like literally sometimes as simple</p>
<p>as just changing the variable names.</p>
<p>So it fits into the rest of your code.</p>
<p>Yes, but this requires that you understand the semantics</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re doing to some degree.</p>
<p>And you can automate some of those things.</p>
<p>The thing that makes people nervous of course</p>
<p>is that a little bit wrong in a program</p>
<p>can have a dramatic effect on the actual final operation</p>
<p>of that program.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one little error,</p>
<p>which in the space of language doesn&rsquo;t really matter,</p>
<p>but in the space of programs can matter a lot.</p>
<p>Yes, but this is already what is happening</p>
<p>when humans program code.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is.</p>
<p>So we have a technology to deal with this.</p>
<p>Somehow it becomes scarier when you know</p>
<p>that a program generated code</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s running a nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>It becomes scarier.</p>
<p>You know, humans have errors too.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s scarier when a program is doing it</p>
<p>because why, why?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a fear that a program,</p>
<p>like a program may not be as good as humans</p>
<p>to know when stuff is important to not mess up.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a misalignment of priorities of values</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s potential.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the source of the worry.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, if I give you code generated</p>
<p>by GitHub open pilot and code generated by a human</p>
<p>and say here, use one of these,</p>
<p>which how do you select today and in the next 10 years</p>
<p>which code do you use?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you still be comfortable with the human?</p>
<p>At the moment when you go to Stanford to get an MRI,</p>
<p>they will write a bill to the insurance over $20,000.</p>
<p>And of this, maybe half of that gets paid by the insurance</p>
<p>and a quarter gets paid by you.</p>
<p>And the MRI cost them $600 to make maybe probably less.</p>
<p>And what are the values of the person</p>
<p>that writes the software and deploys this process?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult for me to say whether I trust people.</p>
<p>I think that what happens there is a mixture</p>
<p>of proper Anglo Saxon Protestant values</p>
<p>where somebody is trying to serve an abstract radar hole</p>
<p>and organize crime.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a very harsh,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a harsh view of humanity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of bad people, whether incompetent</p>
<p>or just malevolent in this world, yes.</p>
<p>But it feels like the more malevolent,</p>
<p>so the more damage you do to the world,</p>
<p>the more resistance you have in your own human heart.</p>
<p>Yeah, but don&rsquo;t explain with malevolence or stupidity</p>
<p>what can be explained by just people</p>
<p>acting on their incentives.</p>
<p>Right, so what happens in Stanford</p>
<p>is not that somebody is evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they do what they&rsquo;re being paid for.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not evil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I tend to, no, I see that as malevolence.</p>
<p>I see as I, even like being a good German,</p>
<p>as I told you offline, is some,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not absolute malevolence,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a small amount, it&rsquo;s cowardice.</p>
<p>I mean, when you see there&rsquo;s something wrong with the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either incompetence and you&rsquo;re not able to see it,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s cowardice that you&rsquo;re not able to stand up,</p>
<p>not necessarily in a big way, but in a small way.</p>
<p>So I do think that is a bit of malevolence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the example you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is a good example of that.</p>
<p>So the question is, what is it that you are aiming for?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t believe in the future,</p>
<p>if you, for instance, think that the dollar is going to crash,</p>
<p>why would you try to save dollars?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t think that humanity will be around</p>
<p>in a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>because global warming will wipe out civilization,</p>
<p>why would you need to act as if it were?</p>
<p>Right, so the question is,</p>
<p>is there an overarching aesthetics</p>
<p>that is projecting you and the world into the future,</p>
<p>which I think is the basic idea of religion,</p>
<p>that you understand the interactions</p>
<p>that we have with each other</p>
<p>as some kind of civilization level agent</p>
<p>that is projecting itself into the future.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that shared purpose,</p>
<p>what is there to be ethical for?</p>
<p>So I think when we talk about ethics and AI,</p>
<p>we need to go beyond the insane bias discussions and so on,</p>
<p>where people are just measuring the distance</p>
<p>between a statistic to their preferred current world model.</p>
<p>The optimism, wait, wait, wait,</p>
<p>I was a little confused by the previous thing,</p>
<p>just to clarify.</p>
<p>There is a kind of underlying morality</p>
<p>to having an optimism that human civilization</p>
<p>will persist for longer than a hundred years.</p>
<p>Like I think a lot of people believe</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a good thing for us to keep living.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>And thriving.</p>
<p>This morality itself is not an end to itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s instrumental to people living in a hundred years</p>
<p>from now or 500 years from now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only justifiable if you actually think</p>
<p>that it will lead to people or increase the probability</p>
<p>of people being around in that timeframe.</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t actually believe that,</p>
<p>at least not actively.</p>
<p>But believe what exactly?</p>
<p>So I was&hellip;</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that they can afford to act on such a model.</p>
<p>Basically what happens in the US</p>
<p>is I think that the healthcare system</p>
<p>is for a lot of people no longer sustainable,</p>
<p>which means that if they need the help</p>
<p>of the healthcare system,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re often not able to afford it.</p>
<p>And when they cannot help it,</p>
<p>they are often going bankrupt.</p>
<p>I think the leading cause of personal bankruptcy</p>
<p>in the US is the healthcare system.</p>
<p>And that would not be necessary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because people are consuming</p>
<p>more and more medical services</p>
<p>and are achieving a much, much longer life as a result.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not actually the story that is happening</p>
<p>because you can compare it to other countries.</p>
<p>And life expectancy in the US is currently not increasing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not as high as in all the other</p>
<p>industrialized countries.</p>
<p>So some industrialized countries are doing better</p>
<p>with a much cheaper healthcare system.</p>
<p>And what you can see is for instance,</p>
<p>administrative bloat.</p>
<p>The healthcare system has maybe to some degree</p>
<p>deliberately set up as a job placement program</p>
<p>to allow people to continue living</p>
<p>in middle class existence,</p>
<p>despite not having useful use case in productivity.</p>
<p>So they are being paid to push paper around.</p>
<p>And the number of administrator in the healthcare system</p>
<p>has been increasing much faster</p>
<p>than the number of practitioners.</p>
<p>And this is something that you have to pay for.</p>
<p>And also the revenues that are being generated</p>
<p>in the healthcare system are relatively large</p>
<p>and somebody has to pay for them.</p>
<p>And the result why they are so large</p>
<p>is because market mechanisms are not working.</p>
<p>The FDA is largely not protecting people</p>
<p>from malpractice of healthcare providers.</p>
<p>The FDA is protecting healthcare providers</p>
<p>from competition.</p>
<p>Right, okay.</p>
<p>So this is a thing that has to do with values.</p>
<p>And this is not because people are malicious on all levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they are not incentivized</p>
<p>to act on a greater whole on this idea</p>
<p>that you treat somebody who comes to you as a patient,</p>
<p>like you would treat a family member.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we&rsquo;re trying, I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re highlighting a lot of the flaws</p>
<p>of the different institutions,</p>
<p>the systems we&rsquo;re operating under,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a continued throughout history</p>
<p>mechanism design of trying to design incentives</p>
<p>in such a way that these systems behave</p>
<p>better and better and better.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very difficult thing</p>
<p>to operate a society of hundreds of millions of people</p>
<p>effectively with.</p>
<p>Yes, so do we live in a society that is ever correcting?</p>
<p>Is this, do we observe that our models</p>
<p>of what we are doing are predictive of the future</p>
<p>and when they are not, we improve them.</p>
<p>Are our laws adjudicated with clauses</p>
<p>that you put into every law,</p>
<p>what is meant to be achieved by that law</p>
<p>and the law will be automatically repealed</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not achieving that, right?</p>
<p>If you are optimizing your own laws,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re writing your own source code,</p>
<p>you probably make an estimate of what is this thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s currently wrong in my life?</p>
<p>What is it that I should change about my own policies?</p>
<p>What is the expected outcome?</p>
<p>And if that outcome doesn&rsquo;t manifest,</p>
<p>I will change the policy back, right?</p>
<p>Or I would change it to something different.</p>
<p>Are we doing this on a societal level?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy to sort of highlight the,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re doing it in the way that,</p>
<p>like I operate my current life.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep much last night.</p>
<p>You would say that Lex,</p>
<p>the way you need to operate your life</p>
<p>is you need to always get sleep.</p>
<p>The fact that you didn&rsquo;t sleep last night</p>
<p>is totally the wrong way to operate in your life.</p>
<p>Like you should have gotten all your shit done in time</p>
<p>and gotten to sleep because sleep is very important</p>
<p>for health and you&rsquo;re highlighting,</p>
<p>look, this person is not sleeping.</p>
<p>Look, the medical, the healthcare system is operating poor.</p>
<p>But the point is we just,</p>
<p>it seems like this is the way,</p>
<p>especially in the capitalist society, we operate.</p>
<p>We keep running into trouble and last minute,</p>
<p>we try to get our way out through innovation</p>
<p>and it seems to work.</p>
<p>You have a lot of people that ultimately are trying</p>
<p>to build a better world and get urgency about them</p>
<p>when the problem becomes more and more imminent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way this operates.</p>
<p>But if you look at the long arc of history,</p>
<p>it seems like that operating on deadlines</p>
<p>produces progress and builds better and better systems.</p>
<p>You probably agree with me that the US</p>
<p>should have engaged in mask production in January 2020</p>
<p>and that we should have shut down the airports early on</p>
<p>and that we should have made it mandatory</p>
<p>that the people that work in nursing homes</p>
<p>are living on campus rather than living at home</p>
<p>and then coming in and infecting people in the nursing homes</p>
<p>that had no immune response to COVID.</p>
<p>And that is something that was, I think, visible back then.</p>
<p>The correct decisions haven&rsquo;t been made.</p>
<p>We would have the same situation again.</p>
<p>How do we know that these wrong decisions</p>
<p>are not being made again?</p>
<p>Have the people that made the decisions</p>
<p>to not protect the nursing homes been punished?</p>
<p>Have the people that made the wrong decisions</p>
<p>with respect to testing that prevented the development</p>
<p>of testing by startup companies and the importing</p>
<p>of tests from countries that already had them,</p>
<p>have these people been held responsible?</p>
<p>First of all, so what do you wanna put</p>
<p>before the firing squad?</p>
<p>I think they are being held responsible.</p>
<p>No, just make sure that this doesn&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s not that, yes, they&rsquo;re being held responsible</p>
<p>by many voices, by people being frustrated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s new leaders being born now</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to see rise to the top in 10 years.</p>
<p>This moves slower than, there&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>a lot of older incompetence and bureaucracy</p>
<p>and these systems move slowly.</p>
<p>They move like science, one death at a time.</p>
<p>So yes, I think the pain that&rsquo;s been felt</p>
<p>in the previous year is reverberating throughout the world.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m getting old, I suspect that every generation</p>
<p>in the US after the war has lost the plot even more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see this development.</p>
<p>The war, World War II?</p>
<p>Yes, so basically there was a time when we were modernist</p>
<p>and in this modernist time, the US felt actively threatened</p>
<p>by the things that happened in the world.</p>
<p>The US was worried about possibility of failure</p>
<p>and this imminence of possible failure led to decisions.</p>
<p>There was a time when the government would listen</p>
<p>to physicists about how to do things</p>
<p>and the physicists were actually concerned</p>
<p>about what the government should be doing.</p>
<p>So they would be writing letters to the government</p>
<p>and so for instance, the decision for the Manhattan Project</p>
<p>was something that was driven in a conversation</p>
<p>between physicists and the government.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think such a discussion would take place today.</p>
<p>I disagree, I think if the virus was much deadlier,</p>
<p>we would see a very different response.</p>
<p>I think the virus was not sufficiently deadly</p>
<p>and instead because it wasn&rsquo;t very deadly,</p>
<p>what happened is the current system</p>
<p>started to politicize it.</p>
<p>The mask, this is what I realized with masks early on,</p>
<p>they were not, very quickly became not as a solution</p>
<p>but they became a thing that politicians used</p>
<p>to divide the country.</p>
<p>So the same things happened with vaccines, same thing.</p>
<p>So like nobody&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>people weren&rsquo;t talking about solutions to this problem</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think the problem was bad enough.</p>
<p>When you talk about the war,</p>
<p>I think our lives are too comfortable.</p>
<p>I think in the developed world, things are too good</p>
<p>and we have not faced severe dangers.</p>
<p>When the danger, the severe dangers,</p>
<p>existential threats are faced, that&rsquo;s when we step up</p>
<p>on a small scale and a large scale.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s sort of my argument here</p>
<p>but I did think the virus is, I was hoping</p>
<p>that it was actually sufficiently dangerous</p>
<p>for us to step up because especially in the early days,</p>
<p>it was unclear, it still is unclear because of mutations,</p>
<p>how bad it might be, right?</p>
<p>And so I thought we would step up and even,</p>
<p>so the masks point is a tricky one because to me,</p>
<p>the manufacture of masks isn&rsquo;t even the problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still to this day and I was involved</p>
<p>with a bunch of this work, have not seen good science done</p>
<p>on whether masks work or not.</p>
<p>Like there still has not been a large scale study.</p>
<p>To me, that should be, there should be large scale studies</p>
<p>and every possible solution, like aggressive</p>
<p>in the same way that the vaccine development</p>
<p>was aggressive.</p>
<p>There should be masks, which tests,</p>
<p>what kind of tests work really well, what kind of,</p>
<p>like even the question of how the virus spreads.</p>
<p>There should be aggressive studies on that to understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still, as far as I know, there&rsquo;s still a lot</p>
<p>of uncertainty about that.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to see this as an engineering problem</p>
<p>that needs to be solved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that I was surprised about, but I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I find that our views are largely convergent</p>
<p>but not completely.</p>
<p>So I agree with the thing that because our society</p>
<p>in some sense perceives itself as too big to fail.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The virus did not alert people to the fact</p>
<p>that we are facing possible failure</p>
<p>that basically put us into the postmodernist mode.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean in a philosophical sense</p>
<p>but in a societal sense.</p>
<p>The difference between the postmodern society</p>
<p>and the modern society is that the modernist society</p>
<p>has to deal with the ground truth</p>
<p>and the postmodernist society has to deal with appearances.</p>
<p>Politics becomes a performance</p>
<p>and the performance is done for an audience</p>
<p>and the organized audience is the media.</p>
<p>And the media evaluates itself via other media, right?</p>
<p>So you have an audience of critics that evaluate themselves.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so much the failure</p>
<p>of the politicians because to get in power</p>
<p>and to stay in power, you need to be able</p>
<p>to deal with the published opinion.</p>
<p>Well, I think it goes in cycles</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s going to happen is all</p>
<p>of the small business owners, all the people</p>
<p>who truly are suffering and will suffer more</p>
<p>because the effects of the closure of the economy</p>
<p>and the lack of solutions to the virus,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to apprise.</p>
<p>And hopefully, I mean, this is where charismatic leaders</p>
<p>can get the world in trouble</p>
<p>but hopefully will elect great leaders</p>
<p>that will break through this postmodernist idea</p>
<p>of the media and the perception</p>
<p>and the drama on Twitter and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But you know, this can go either way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When the Weimar Republic was unable to deal</p>
<p>with the economic crisis that Germany was facing,</p>
<p>there was an option to go back.</p>
<p>But there were people which thought,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get back to a constitutional monarchy</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get this to work because democracy doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And eventually, there was no way back.</p>
<p>People decided there was no way back.</p>
<p>They needed to go forward.</p>
<p>And the only options for going forward</p>
<p>was to become Stalinist communist,</p>
<p>basically an option to completely expropriate</p>
<p>the factories and so on and nationalize them</p>
<p>and to reorganize Germany in communist terms</p>
<p>and ally itself with Stalin and fascism.</p>
<p>And both options were obviously very bad.</p>
<p>And the one that the Germans picked</p>
<p>led to a catastrophe that devastated Europe.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure if the US has an immune response</p>
<p>against that.</p>
<p>I think that the far right is currently very weak in the US,</p>
<p>but this can easily change.</p>
<p>Do you think from a historical perspective,</p>
<p>Hitler could have been stopped</p>
<p>from within Germany or from outside?</p>
<p>Or this, well, depends on who you wanna focus,</p>
<p>whether you wanna focus on Stalin or Hitler,</p>
<p>but it feels like Hitler was the one</p>
<p>as a political movement that could have been stopped.</p>
<p>I think that the point was that a lot of people</p>
<p>wanted Hitler, so he got support from a lot of quarters.</p>
<p>There was a number of industrialists who supported him</p>
<p>because they thought that the democracy</p>
<p>is obviously not working and unstable</p>
<p>and you need a strong man.</p>
<p>And he was willing to play that part.</p>
<p>There were also people in the US who thought</p>
<p>that Hitler would stop Stalin</p>
<p>and would act as a bulwark against Bolshevism,</p>
<p>which he probably would have done, right?</p>
<p>But at which cost?</p>
<p>And then many of the things that he was going to do,</p>
<p>like the Holocaust, was something where people thought</p>
<p>this is rhetoric, he&rsquo;s not actually going to do this.</p>
<p>Especially many of the Jews themselves, which were humanists.</p>
<p>And for them, this was outside of the scope</p>
<p>that was thinkable.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, I wonder if Hitler is uniquely,</p>
<p>I wanna carefully use this term, but uniquely evil.</p>
<p>So if Hitler was never born,</p>
<p>if somebody else would come in this place.</p>
<p>So like, just thinking about the progress of history,</p>
<p>how important are those singular figures</p>
<p>that lead to mass destruction and cruelty?</p>
<p>Because my sense is Hitler was unique.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just about the environment</p>
<p>and the context that gave him,</p>
<p>like another person would not come in his place</p>
<p>to do as destructive of the things that he did.</p>
<p>There was a combination of charisma, of madness,</p>
<p>of psychopathy, of just ego, all those things,</p>
<p>which are very unlikely to come together</p>
<p>in one person in the right time.</p>
<p>It also depends on the context of the country</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re operating in.</p>
<p>If you tell the Germans that they have a historical destiny</p>
<p>in this romantic country,</p>
<p>the effect is probably different</p>
<p>than it is in other countries.</p>
<p>But Stalin has killed a few more people than Hitler did.</p>
<p>And if you look at the probability</p>
<p>that you survived under Stalin,</p>
<p>Hitler killed people if he thought</p>
<p>they were not worth living,</p>
<p>or if they were harmful to his racist project.</p>
<p>He basically felt that the Jews would be too cosmopolitan</p>
<p>and would not be willing to participate</p>
<p>in the racist redefinition of society</p>
<p>and the value of society,</p>
<p>and there is no state in this way</p>
<p>that he wanted to have it.</p>
<p>So he saw them as harmful danger,</p>
<p>especially since they played such an important role</p>
<p>in the economy and culture of Germany.</p>
<p>And so basically he had some radical</p>
<p>but rational reason to murder them.</p>
<p>And Stalin just killed everyone.</p>
<p>Basically the Stalinist purges were such a random thing</p>
<p>where he said that there&rsquo;s a certain possibility</p>
<p>that this particular part of the population</p>
<p>has a number of German collaborators or something,</p>
<p>and we just kill them all, right?</p>
<p>Or if you look at what Mao did,</p>
<p>the number of people that were killed</p>
<p>in absolute numbers were much higher under Mao</p>
<p>than they were under Stalin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s super hard to say.</p>
<p>The other thing is that you look at Genghis Khan and so on,</p>
<p>how many people he killed.</p>
<p>When you see there are a number of things</p>
<p>that happen in human history</p>
<p>that actually really put a substantial dent</p>
<p>in the existing population, or Napoleon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult to eventually measure it</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening is basically evolution</p>
<p>on a human scale where one monkey figures out</p>
<p>a way to become viral and is using this viral technology</p>
<p>to change the patterns of society</p>
<p>at the very, very large scale.</p>
<p>And what we find so abhorrent about these changes</p>
<p>is the complexity that is being destroyed by this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically like a big fire that burns out</p>
<p>a lot of the existing culture and structure</p>
<p>that existed before.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it all just starts with one monkey.</p>
<p>One charismatic ape.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of them throughout history.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s in a given environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically similar to wildfires in California, right?</p>
<p>The temperature is rising.</p>
<p>There is less rain falling.</p>
<p>And then suddenly a single spark can have an effect</p>
<p>that in other times would be contained.</p>
<p>Okay, speaking of which, I love how we went</p>
<p>to Hitler and Stalin from 20, 30 minutes ago,</p>
<p>GPT3 generating, doing programs that this is.</p>
<p>The argument was about morality of AI versus human.</p>
<p>And specifically in the context of writing programs,</p>
<p>specifically in the context of programs</p>
<p>that can be destructive.</p>
<p>So running nuclear power plants</p>
<p>or autonomous weapons systems, for example.</p>
<p>And I think your inclination was to say that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not so obvious that AI would be less moral than humans</p>
<p>or less effective at making a world</p>
<p>that would make humans happy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not talking about self directed systems</p>
<p>that are making their own goals at a global scale.</p>
<p>If you just talk about the deployment</p>
<p>of technological systems that are able to see order</p>
<p>and patterns and use this as control models</p>
<p>to act on the goals that we give them,</p>
<p>then if we have the correct incentives</p>
<p>to set the correct incentives for these systems,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite optimistic.</p>
<p>So humans versus AI, let me give you an example.</p>
<p>Autonomous weapon system.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a city somewhere in the Middle East</p>
<p>that has a number of terrorists.</p>
<p>And the question is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s currently done with drone technologies,</p>
<p>you have information about the location</p>
<p>of a particular terrorist and you have a targeted attack,</p>
<p>you have a bombing of that particular building.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all directed by humans</p>
<p>at the high level strategy</p>
<p>and also at the deployment of individual bombs and missiles</p>
<p>like the actual, everything is done by human</p>
<p>except the final targeting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like spot, similar thing, like control the flight.</p>
<p>Okay, what if you give AI control and saying,</p>
<p>write a program that says,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the best information I have available</p>
<p>about the location of these five terrorists,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the city, make sure all the bombing you do</p>
<p>is constrained to the city, make sure it&rsquo;s precision based,</p>
<p>but you take care of it.</p>
<p>So you do one level of abstraction out</p>
<p>and saying, take care of the terrorists in the city.</p>
<p>Which are you more comfortable with,</p>
<p>the humans or the JavaScript GPT3 generated code</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing the deployment?</p>
<p>I mean, this is the kind of question I&rsquo;m asking,</p>
<p>is the kind of bugs that we see in human nature,</p>
<p>are they better or worse than the kind of bugs we see in AI?</p>
<p>There are different bugs.</p>
<p>There is an issue that if people are creating</p>
<p>an imperfect automation of a process</p>
<p>that normally requires a moral judgment,</p>
<p>and this moral judgment is the reason</p>
<p>why it cannot be automated often,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not because the computation is too expensive,</p>
<p>but because the model that you give the AI</p>
<p>is not an adequate model of the dynamics of the world,</p>
<p>because the AI does not understand the context</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s operating in the right way.</p>
<p>And this is something that already happens with Excel.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to have an AI system to do this.</p>
<p>You have an automated process in place</p>
<p>where humans decide using automated criteria</p>
<p>whom to kill when and whom to target when,</p>
<p>which already happens.</p>
<p>And you have no way to get off the kill list</p>
<p>once that happens, once you have been targeted</p>
<p>according to some automatic criterion</p>
<p>by people in a bureaucracy, that is the issue.</p>
<p>The issue is not the AI, it&rsquo;s the automation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about, right, it&rsquo;s automation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain level of abstraction</p>
<p>where you give control to AI to do the automation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a scale that can be achieved</p>
<p>that it feels like the scale of bug and scale mistake</p>
<p>and scale of destruction that can be achieved</p>
<p>of the kind that humans cannot achieve.</p>
<p>So AI is much more able to destroy</p>
<p>an entire country accidentally versus humans.</p>
<p>It feels like the more civilians die as they react</p>
<p>or suffer as the consequences of your decisions,</p>
<p>the more weight there is on the human mind</p>
<p>to make that decision.</p>
<p>And so like, it becomes more and more unlikely</p>
<p>to make that decision for humans.</p>
<p>For AI, it feels like it&rsquo;s harder to encode</p>
<p>that kind of weight.</p>
<p>In a way, the AI that we&rsquo;re currently building</p>
<p>is automating statistics, right?</p>
<p>Intelligence is the ability to make models</p>
<p>so you can act on them,</p>
<p>and AI is the tool to make better models.</p>
<p>So in principle, if you&rsquo;re using AI wisely,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to prevent more harm.</p>
<p>And I think that the main issue is not on the side of the AI,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the side of the human command hierarchy</p>
<p>that is using technology irresponsibly.</p>
<p>So the question is how hard is it to encode,</p>
<p>to properly encode the right incentives into the AI?</p>
<p>So for instance, there&rsquo;s this idea</p>
<p>of what happens if we let our airplanes being flown</p>
<p>with AI systems and the neural network is a black box</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And it turns out our neural networks</p>
<p>are actually not black boxes anymore.</p>
<p>There are function approximators using linear algebra,</p>
<p>and there are performing things that we can understand.</p>
<p>But we can also, instead of letting the neural network</p>
<p>fly the airplane, use the neural network</p>
<p>to generate a provably correct program.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a degree of accuracy of the proof</p>
<p>that a human could not achieve.</p>
<p>And so we can use our AI by combining</p>
<p>different technologies to build systems</p>
<p>that are much more reliable than the systems</p>
<p>that a human being could create.</p>
<p>And so in this sense, I would say that</p>
<p>if you use an early stage of technology to save labor</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t employ competent people,</p>
<p>but just to hack something together because you can,</p>
<p>that is very dangerous.</p>
<p>And if people are acting under these incentives</p>
<p>that they get away with delivering shoddy work</p>
<p>more cheaply using AI with less human oversight than before,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very dangerous.</p>
<p>The thing is though, AI is still going to be unreliable,</p>
<p>perhaps less so than humans,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll be unreliable in novel ways.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is an empirical question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that we can figure out and work with.</p>
<p>So the issue is, do we trust the systems,</p>
<p>the social systems that we have in place</p>
<p>and the social systems that we can build and maintain</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re able to use AI responsibly?</p>
<p>If they can, then AI is good news.</p>
<p>If they cannot,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s going to make the existing problems worse.</p>
<p>Well, and also who creates the AI, who controls it,</p>
<p>who makes money from it because it&rsquo;s ultimately humans.</p>
<p>And then you start talking about</p>
<p>how much you trust the humans.</p>
<p>So the question is, what does who mean?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we have identity per se.</p>
<p>I think that the story of a human being is somewhat random.</p>
<p>What happens is more or less that everybody is acting</p>
<p>on their local incentives,</p>
<p>what they perceive to be their incentives.</p>
<p>And the question is, what are the incentives</p>
<p>that the one that is pressing the button is operating under?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice for those incentives to be transparent.</p>
<p>So, for example, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>There seems to be a significant distrust</p>
<p>of a tech, like entrepreneurs in the tech space</p>
<p>or people that run, for example, social media companies</p>
<p>like Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a complete transparency of incentives</p>
<p>under which that particular human being operates.</p>
<p>We can listen to the words he says</p>
<p>or what the marketing team says for a company,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that becomes a problem when the algorithms</p>
<p>and the systems created by him and other people</p>
<p>in that company start having more and more impact</p>
<p>on society.</p>
<p>And that it starts, if the incentives were somehow</p>
<p>the definition and the explainability of the incentives</p>
<p>was decentralized such that nobody can manipulate it,</p>
<p>no propaganda type manipulation of like</p>
<p>how these systems actually operate could be done,</p>
<p>then yes, I think AI could achieve much fairer,</p>
<p>much more effective sort of like solutions</p>
<p>to difficult ethical problems.</p>
<p>But when there&rsquo;s like humans in the loop,</p>
<p>manipulating the dissemination, the communication</p>
<p>of how the system actually works,</p>
<p>that feels like you can run into a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s currently a lot of distrust</p>
<p>for people at the heads of companies</p>
<p>that have increasingly powerful AI systems.</p>
<p>I suspect what happened traditionally in the US</p>
<p>was that since our decision making</p>
<p>is much more decentralized than in an authoritarian state,</p>
<p>people are making decisions autonomously</p>
<p>at many, many levels in a society.</p>
<p>What happened that was we created coherence</p>
<p>and cohesion in society by controlling what people thought</p>
<p>and what information they had.</p>
<p>The media synchronized public opinion</p>
<p>and social media have disrupted this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I think so much Russian influence or something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s influence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that a random person can come up</p>
<p>with a conspiracy theory and disrupt what people think.</p>
<p>And if that conspiracy theory is more compelling</p>
<p>or more attractive than the standardized</p>
<p>public conspiracy theory that we give people as a default,</p>
<p>then it might get more traction, right?</p>
<p>You suddenly have the situation that a single individual</p>
<p>somewhere on a farm in Texas has more listeners than CNN.</p>
<p>Which particular farmer are you referring to in Texas?</p>
<p>Probably no.</p>
<p>Yes, I had dinner with him a couple of times, okay.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s an interesting situation</p>
<p>because you cannot get to be an anchor in CNN</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t go through a complicated gatekeeping process.</p>
<p>And suddenly you have random people</p>
<p>without that gatekeeping process,</p>
<p>just optimizing for attention.</p>
<p>Not necessarily with a lot of responsibility</p>
<p>for the longterm effects of projecting these theories</p>
<p>into the public.</p>
<p>And now there is a push of making social media</p>
<p>more like traditional media,</p>
<p>which means that the opinion that is being projected</p>
<p>in social media is more limited to an acceptable range.</p>
<p>With the goal of getting society into safe waters</p>
<p>and increase the stability and cohesion of society again,</p>
<p>which I think is a laudable goal.</p>
<p>But of course it also is an opportunity</p>
<p>to seize the means of indoctrination.</p>
<p>And the incentives that people are under when they do this</p>
<p>are in such a way that the AI ethics that we would need</p>
<p>becomes very often something like AI politics,</p>
<p>which is basically partisan and ideological.</p>
<p>And this means that whatever one side says,</p>
<p>another side is going to be disagreeing with, right?</p>
<p>In the same way as when you turn masks or the vaccine</p>
<p>into a political issue,</p>
<p>if you say that it is politically virtuous</p>
<p>to get vaccinated,</p>
<p>it will mean that the people that don&rsquo;t like you</p>
<p>will not want to get vaccinated, right?</p>
<p>And as soon as you have this partisan discourse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very hard to make the right decisions</p>
<p>because the incentives get to be the wrong ones.</p>
<p>AI ethics needs to be super boring.</p>
<p>It needs to be done by people who do statistics</p>
<p>all the time and have extremely boring,</p>
<p>long winded discussions that most people cannot follow</p>
<p>because they are too complicated,</p>
<p>but that are dead serious.</p>
<p>These people need to be able to be better at statistics</p>
<p>than the leading machine learning researchers.</p>
<p>And at the moment, the AI ethics debate is the one</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have any barrier to entry, right?</p>
<p>Everybody who has a strong opinion</p>
<p>and is able to signal that opinion in the right way</p>
<p>can enter it.</p>
<p>And to me, that is a very frustrating thing</p>
<p>because the field is so crucially important</p>
<p>to our future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so crucially important,</p>
<p>but the only qualification you currently need</p>
<p>is to be outraged by the injustice in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more complicated, right?</p>
<p>Everybody seems to be outraged.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just say that the incentives</p>
<p>are not always the right ones.</p>
<p>So basically, I suspect that a lot of people</p>
<p>that enter this debate don&rsquo;t have a vision</p>
<p>for what society should be looking like</p>
<p>in a way that is nonviolent,</p>
<p>where we preserve liberal democracy,</p>
<p>where we make sure that we all get along</p>
<p>and we are around in a few hundred years from now,</p>
<p>preferably with a comfortable</p>
<p>technological civilization around us.</p>
<p>I generally have a very foggy view of that world,</p>
<p>but I tend to try to follow,</p>
<p>and I think society should in some degree</p>
<p>follow the gradient of love,</p>
<p>increasing the amount of love in the world.</p>
<p>And whenever I see different policies</p>
<p>or algorithms or ideas that are not doing so,</p>
<p>obviously, that&rsquo;s the ones that kind of resist.</p>
<p>So the thing that terrifies me about this notion</p>
<p>is I think that German fascism was driven by love.</p>
<p>It was just a very selective love.</p>
<p>It was a love that basically&hellip;</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just manipulating.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, you have to be very careful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to the wrong person in this way about love.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what love is.</p>
<p>And I think that love is the discovery of shared purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the recognition of the sacred in the other.</p>
<p>And this enables non transactional interactions.</p>
<p>But the size of the other that you include</p>
<p>needs to be maximized.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically appreciation,</p>
<p>like deep appreciation of the world around you fully,</p>
<p>including the people that are very different than you,</p>
<p>people that disagree with you completely,</p>
<p>including people, including living creatures</p>
<p>outside of just people, including ideas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like appreciation of the full mess of it.</p>
<p>And also it has to do with like empathy,</p>
<p>which is coupled with a lack of confidence</p>
<p>and certainty of your own rightness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a radical open mindedness to the way forward.</p>
<p>I agree with every part of what you said.</p>
<p>And now if you scale it up,</p>
<p>what you recognize is that Lafist is in some sense,</p>
<p>the service to next level agency,</p>
<p>to the highest level agency that you can recognize.</p>
<p>It could be for instance, life on earth or beyond that,</p>
<p>where you could say intelligent complexity in the universe</p>
<p>that you try to maximize in a certain way.</p>
<p>But when you think it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>it basically means a certain aesthetic.</p>
<p>And there is not one possible aesthetic,</p>
<p>there are many possible aesthetics.</p>
<p>And once you project an aesthetic into the future,</p>
<p>you can see that there are some which defect from it,</p>
<p>which are in conflict with it,</p>
<p>that are corrupt, that are evil.</p>
<p>You and me would probably agree that Hitler was evil</p>
<p>because the aesthetic of the world that he wanted</p>
<p>is in conflict with the aesthetic of the world</p>
<p>that you and me have in mind.</p>
<p>And so they think that he destroyed,</p>
<p>we want to keep them in the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of, there&rsquo;s kind of ways to deal,</p>
<p>I mean, Hitler is an easier case,</p>
<p>but perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t so easy in the 30s, right?</p>
<p>To understand who is Hitler and who is not.</p>
<p>No, it was just there was no consensus</p>
<p>that the aesthetics that he had in mind were unacceptable.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult, love is complicated</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t just be so open minded</p>
<p>that you let evil walk into the door,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t be so self assured</p>
<p>that you can always identify evil perfectly</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what leads to Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Having a certainty of what is and wasn&rsquo;t evil,</p>
<p>like always drawing lines of good versus evil.</p>
<p>There seems to be, there has to be a dance</p>
<p>between like hard stances extending up</p>
<p>against what is wrong.</p>
<p>And at the same time, empathy and open mindedness</p>
<p>of towards not knowing what is right and wrong</p>
<p>and like a dance between those.</p>
<p>I found that when I watched the Miyazaki movies</p>
<p>that there is nobody who captures my spirituality</p>
<p>as well as he does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting and just vicious, right?</p>
<p>There is something going on in his movies</p>
<p>that is very interesting.</p>
<p>So for instance, Mononoke is discussing</p>
<p>not only an answer to Disney&rsquo;s simplistic notion of Mowgli,</p>
<p>the jungle boy was raised by wolves.</p>
<p>And as soon as he sees people realizes that he&rsquo;s one of them</p>
<p>and the way in which the moral life and nature</p>
<p>is simplified and romanticized and turned into kitsch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting in the Disney movie.</p>
<p>And he answers to this, you see,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s replaced by Mononoke, this wolf girl</p>
<p>who was raised by wolves and was fierce and dangerous</p>
<p>and who cannot be socialized because she cannot be tamed.</p>
<p>You cannot be part of human society.</p>
<p>And you see human society,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that is very, very complicated.</p>
<p>You see people extracting resources and destroying nature.</p>
<p>But the purpose is not to be evil,</p>
<p>but to be able to have a life that is free from,</p>
<p>for instance, oppression and violence</p>
<p>and to curb death and disease.</p>
<p>And you basically see this conflict</p>
<p>which cannot be resolved in a certain way.</p>
<p>You see this moment when nature is turned into a garden</p>
<p>and it loses most of what it actually is</p>
<p>and humans no longer submitting to life and death</p>
<p>and nature and to these questions, there is no easy answer.</p>
<p>So it just turns it into something that is being observed</p>
<p>as a journey that happens.</p>
<p>And that happens with a certain degree of inevitability.</p>
<p>And the nice thing about all his movies</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a certain main character</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same in all movies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this little girl that is basically Heidi.</p>
<p>And I suspect that happened because when he did field work</p>
<p>for working on the Heidi movies back then,</p>
<p>the Heidi animations, before he did his own movies,</p>
<p>he traveled to Switzerland and South Eastern Europe</p>
<p>and the Adriatic and so on and got an idea</p>
<p>about a certain aesthetic and a certain way of life</p>
<p>that informed his future thinking.</p>
<p>And Heidi has a very interesting relationship</p>
<p>to herself and to the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that she takes for herself.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in a way fearless because she is committed</p>
<p>to a service, to a greater whole.</p>
<p>Basically, she is completely committed to serving God.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not an institutionalized God.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the Roman Catholic Church</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>But in some sense, Heidi is an embodiment</p>
<p>of the spirit of European Protestantism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this idea of a being that is completely perfect</p>
<p>and pure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a feminist vision</p>
<p>because she is not a girl boss or something like this.</p>
<p>She is the justification for the men in the audience</p>
<p>to protect her, to build a civilization around her</p>
<p>that makes her possible.</p>
<p>So she is not just the sacrifice of Jesus</p>
<p>who is innocent and therefore nailed to the cross.</p>
<p>She is not being sacrificed.</p>
<p>She is being protected by everybody around her</p>
<p>who recognizes that she is sacred.</p>
<p>And there are enough around her to see that.</p>
<p>So this is a very interesting perspective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain notion of innocence.</p>
<p>And this notion of innocence is not universal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in all cultures.</p>
<p>Hitler wasn&rsquo;t innocent.</p>
<p>His idea of Germany was not that there is an innocence</p>
<p>that is being protected.</p>
<p>There was a predator that was going to triumph.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also something that is not at the core</p>
<p>of every religion.</p>
<p>There are many religions which don&rsquo;t care about innocence.</p>
<p>They might care about increasing the status of something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very interesting notion that is quite unique</p>
<p>and not claiming it&rsquo;s the optimal one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a particular kind of aesthetic</p>
<p>which I think makes Miyazaki</p>
<p>into the most relevant Protestant philosopher today.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying in terms of all the ways</p>
<p>that a society can operate perhaps the preservation</p>
<p>of innocence might be one of the best.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just my aesthetic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a particular way in which I feel</p>
<p>that I relate to the world that is natural</p>
<p>to my own socialization.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s not an accident</p>
<p>that I have cultural roots in Europe</p>
<p>in a particular world.</p>
<p>And so maybe it&rsquo;s a natural convergence point</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not something that you will find</p>
<p>in all other times in history.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to ask you about Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p>and our individual role as ants in this very large society.</p>
<p>So he says that some version of the line</p>
<p>between good and evil runs to the heart of every man.</p>
<p>Do you think all of us are capable of good and evil?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s our role in this play</p>
<p>in this game we&rsquo;re all playing?</p>
<p>Is all of us capable to play any role?</p>
<p>Like, is there an ultimate responsibility</p>
<p>to you mentioned maintaining innocence</p>
<p>or whatever the highest ideal for a society you want</p>
<p>are all of us capable of living up to that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s our responsibility</p>
<p>or is there significant limitations</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re able to do in terms of good and evil?</p>
<p>So there is a certain way if you are not terrible,</p>
<p>if you are committed to some kind of civilizational agency,</p>
<p>a next level agent that you are serving,</p>
<p>some kind of transcendent principle.</p>
<p>In the eyes of that transcendental principle,</p>
<p>you are able to discern good from evil.</p>
<p>Otherwise you cannot,</p>
<p>otherwise you have just individual aesthetics.</p>
<p>The cat that is torturing a mouse is not evil</p>
<p>because the cat does not envision</p>
<p>or no part of the world of the cat is envisioning a world</p>
<p>where there is no violence and nobody is suffering.</p>
<p>If you have an aesthetic where you want</p>
<p>to protect innocence,</p>
<p>then torturing somebody needlessly is evil,</p>
<p>but only then.</p>
<p>No, but within, I guess the question is within the aesthetic,</p>
<p>like within your sense of what is good and evil,</p>
<p>are we still, it seems like we&rsquo;re still able</p>
<p>to commit evil.</p>
<p>Yes, so basically if you are committing</p>
<p>to this next level agent,</p>
<p>you are not necessarily are this next level agent, right?</p>
<p>You are a part of it.</p>
<p>You have a relationship to it,</p>
<p>like the cell does to its organism, its hyperorganism.</p>
<p>And it only exists to the degree</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s being implemented by you and others.</p>
<p>And that means that you&rsquo;re not completely fully serving it.</p>
<p>You have freedom in what you decide,</p>
<p>whether you are acting on your impulses</p>
<p>and local incentives and your farewell impulses,</p>
<p>so to speak, or whether you&rsquo;re committing to it.</p>
<p>And what you perceive then is a tension</p>
<p>between what you would be doing with respect</p>
<p>to the thing that you recognize as the sacred, if you do,</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re actually doing.</p>
<p>And this is the line between good and evil,</p>
<p>right where you see, oh, I&rsquo;m here acting</p>
<p>on my local incentives or impulses,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m acting on what I consider to be sacred.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tension between those.</p>
<p>And this is the line between good and evil</p>
<p>that might run through your heart.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have this relationship</p>
<p>to a transcendental agent,</p>
<p>you could call this relationship</p>
<p>to the next level agent soul, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an immortal thing that is intrinsically valuable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a certain kind of relationship</p>
<p>that you project to understand what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Somebody is serving this transcendental sacredness</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a soul, you cannot be evil.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a complex natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>So if you look at life, like starting today</p>
<p>or starting tomorrow, when we leave here today,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of trajectories</p>
<p>that you can take through life, maybe countless.</p>
<p>Do you think some of these trajectories,</p>
<p>in your own conception of yourself,</p>
<p>some of those trajectories are the ideal life,</p>
<p>a life that if you were to be the hero of your life story,</p>
<p>you would want to be?</p>
<p>Like, is there some Josh or Bhakti you&rsquo;re striving to be?</p>
<p>Like, this is the question I ask myself</p>
<p>as an individual trying to make a better world</p>
<p>in the best way that I could conceive of.</p>
<p>What is my responsibility there?</p>
<p>And how much am I responsible for the failure to do so?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m lazy and incompetent too often.</p>
<p>In my own perception.</p>
<p>In my own worldview, I&rsquo;m not very important.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t have place for me as a hero</p>
<p>in my own world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do the best that I can,</p>
<p>which is often not very good.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not important for me to have status</p>
<p>or to be seen in a particular way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful if others can see me</p>
<p>or a few people can see me that can be my friends.</p>
<p>No, sorry, I want to clarify,</p>
<p>the hero I didn&rsquo;t mean status or perception</p>
<p>or like some kind of marketing thing,</p>
<p>but more in private, in the quiet of your own mind.</p>
<p>Is there the kind of man you want to be</p>
<p>and would consider it a failure if you don&rsquo;t become that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I meant by hero.</p>
<p>Yeah, not really.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t perceive myself as having such an identity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also sometimes frustrating,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically a lack of having this notion</p>
<p>of father that I need to be emulating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the leaf floating down the river.</p>
<p>I worry that&hellip;</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s more like being the river.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a fat frog sitting on a leaf</p>
<p>on a dirty, muddy lake.</p>
<p>I wish I was waiting for a princess to kiss me.</p>
<p>Or the other way, I forgot which way it goes.</p>
<p>Somebody kisses somebody.</p>
<p>I can ask you, I don&rsquo;t know if you know</p>
<p>who Michael Malice is,</p>
<p>but in terms of constructing since systems of incentives,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting to ask.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve talked to you about this before.</p>
<p>Malice espouses anarchism.</p>
<p>So he sees all government as fundamentally</p>
<p>getting in the way or even being destructive</p>
<p>to collaborations between human beings thriving.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of government in a society that thrives?</p>
<p>Is anarchism at all compelling to you as a system?</p>
<p>So like not just small government,</p>
<p>but no government at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t see how this would work.</p>
<p>The government is an agent that imposes an offset</p>
<p>on your reward function, on your payout metrics.</p>
<p>So your behavior becomes compatible with the common good.</p>
<p>So the argument there is that you can have collectives</p>
<p>like governing organizations, but not government,</p>
<p>like where you&rsquo;re born in a particular set of land</p>
<p>and therefore you must follow this rule or else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re forced by what they call violence</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an implied violence here.</p>
<p>So the key aspect of government is it protects you</p>
<p>from the rest of the world with an army and with police.</p>
<p>So it has a monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only one that&rsquo;s able to do violence.</p>
<p>So there are many forms of government,</p>
<p>not all governments do that.</p>
<p>But we find that in successful countries,</p>
<p>the government has a monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>And that means that you cannot get ahead</p>
<p>by starting your own army because the government</p>
<p>will come down on you and destroy you</p>
<p>if you try to do that.</p>
<p>And in countries where you can build your own army</p>
<p>and get away with it, some people will do it.</p>
<p>And these countries is what we call failed countries</p>
<p>in a way.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t want to have violence,</p>
<p>the point is not to appeal to the moral intentions of people</p>
<p>because some people will use strategies</p>
<p>if they get ahead with them that feel a particular kind</p>
<p>of ecological niche.</p>
<p>So you need to destroy that ecological niche.</p>
<p>And if effective government has a monopoly on violence,</p>
<p>it can create a world where nobody is able to use violence</p>
<p>and get ahead.</p>
<p>So you want to use that monopoly on violence,</p>
<p>not to exert violence, but to make violence impossible,</p>
<p>to raise the cost of violence.</p>
<p>So people need to get ahead with nonviolent means.</p>
<p>So the idea is that you might be able to achieve that</p>
<p>in an anarchist state with companies.</p>
<p>So with the forces of capitalism is create security companies</p>
<p>where the one that&rsquo;s most ethically sound rises to the top.</p>
<p>Basically, it would be a much better representative</p>
<p>of the people because there is a less sort of stickiness</p>
<p>to the big military force sticking around</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s long overlived, outlived.</p>
<p>So you have groups of militants that are hopefully</p>
<p>efficiently organized because otherwise they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to lose against the other groups of militants</p>
<p>and they are coordinating themselves with the rest</p>
<p>of society until they are having a monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>How is that different from a government?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically converging to the same thing.</p>
<p>So I was trying to argue with Malice,</p>
<p>I feel like it always converges towards government at scale,</p>
<p>but I think the idea is you can have a lot of collectives</p>
<p>that are, you basically never let anything scale too big.</p>
<p>So one of the problems with governments is it gets too big</p>
<p>in terms of like the size of the group</p>
<p>over which it has control.</p>
<p>My sense is that would happen anyway.</p>
<p>So a successful company like Amazon or Facebook,</p>
<p>I mean, it starts forming a monopoly</p>
<p>over the entire populations,</p>
<p>not over just the hundreds of millions,</p>
<p>but billions of people.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, but there is something</p>
<p>about the abuses of power the government can have</p>
<p>when it has a monopoly on violence, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a tension there, but&hellip;</p>
<p>So the question is how can you set the incentives</p>
<p>for government correctly?</p>
<p>And this mostly applies at the highest levels of government</p>
<p>and because we haven&rsquo;t found a way to set them correctly,</p>
<p>we made the highest levels of government relatively weak.</p>
<p>And this is, I think, part of the reason</p>
<p>why we had difficulty to coordinate the pandemic response</p>
<p>and China didn&rsquo;t have that much difficulty.</p>
<p>And there is, of course, a much higher risk</p>
<p>of the abuse of power that exists in China</p>
<p>because the power is largely unchecked.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically what happens</p>
<p>in the next generation, for instance.</p>
<p>Imagine that we would agree</p>
<p>that the current government of China is largely correct</p>
<p>and benevolent, and maybe we don&rsquo;t agree on this,</p>
<p>but if we did, how can we make sure</p>
<p>that this stays like this?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have checks and balances,</p>
<p>division of power, it&rsquo;s hard to achieve.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a solution for that problem.</p>
<p>But the abolishment of government</p>
<p>basically would remove the control structure.</p>
<p>From a cybernetic perspective,</p>
<p>there is an optimal point in the system</p>
<p>that the regulation should be happening, right?</p>
<p>That you can measure the current incentives</p>
<p>and the regulator would be properly incentivized</p>
<p>to make the right decisions</p>
<p>and change the payout metrics of everything below it</p>
<p>in such a way that the local prisoners dilemmas</p>
<p>get resolved, right?</p>
<p>You cannot resolve the prisoners dilemma</p>
<p>without some kind of eternal control</p>
<p>that emulates an infinite game in a way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a sense in which</p>
<p>it seems like the reason government,</p>
<p>the parts of government that don&rsquo;t work well currently</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s not good mechanisms</p>
<p>through which to interact,</p>
<p>for the citizenry to interact with government</p>
<p>is basically it hasn&rsquo;t caught up in terms of technology.</p>
<p>And I think once you integrate</p>
<p>some of the digital revolution</p>
<p>of being able to have a lot of access to data,</p>
<p>be able to vote on different ideas at a local level,</p>
<p>at all levels, at the optimal level</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re saying that can resolve the prisoner dilemmas</p>
<p>and to integrate AI to help you automate things</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t require the human ingenuity.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s where government could operate that well</p>
<p>and can also break apart the inefficient bureaucracies</p>
<p>if needed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a strong incentive to be efficient and successful.</p>
<p>So out human history, we see an evolution</p>
<p>and evolutionary competition of modes of government</p>
<p>and of individual governments is in these modes.</p>
<p>And every nation state in some sense</p>
<p>is some kind of organism that has found different solutions</p>
<p>for the problem of government.</p>
<p>And you could look at all these different models</p>
<p>and the different scales at which it exists</p>
<p>as empirical attempts to validate the idea</p>
<p>of how to build a better government.</p>
<p>And I suspect that the idea of anarchism</p>
<p>similar to the idea of communism</p>
<p>is the result of being disenchanted</p>
<p>with the ugliness of the real existing solutions</p>
<p>and the attempt to get to an utopia.</p>
<p>And I suspect that communism originally was not a utopia.</p>
<p>I think that in the same way as original Christianity,</p>
<p>it had a particular kind of vision.</p>
<p>And this vision is a society,</p>
<p>a mode of organization within the society</p>
<p>in which humans can coexist at scale without coercion.</p>
<p>In the same way as we do in a healthy family, right?</p>
<p>In a good family,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t terrorize each other into compliance,</p>
<p>but you understand what everybody needs</p>
<p>and what everybody is able to contribute</p>
<p>and what the intended future of the whole thing is.</p>
<p>And everybody coordinates their behavior in the right way</p>
<p>and informs each other about how to do this.</p>
<p>And all the interactions that happen</p>
<p>are instrumental to making that happen, right?</p>
<p>Could this happen at scale?</p>
<p>And I think this is the idea of communism.</p>
<p>Communism is opposed to the idea</p>
<p>that we need economic terror</p>
<p>or other forms of terror to make that happen.</p>
<p>But in practice, what happened</p>
<p>is that the proto communist countries,</p>
<p>the real existing socialism,</p>
<p>replaced a part of the economic terror with moral terror,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So we were told to do the right thing for moral reasons.</p>
<p>And of course it didn&rsquo;t really work</p>
<p>and the economy eventually collapsed.</p>
<p>And the moral terror had actual real cost, right?</p>
<p>People were in prison</p>
<p>because they were morally noncompliant.</p>
<p>And the other thing is that the idea of communism</p>
<p>became a utopia.</p>
<p>So it basically was projected into the afterlife.</p>
<p>We were told in my childhood</p>
<p>that communism was a hypothetical society</p>
<p>to which we were in a permanent revolution</p>
<p>that justified everything</p>
<p>that was presently wrong with society morally.</p>
<p>But it was something that our grandchildren</p>
<p>probably would not ever see</p>
<p>because it was too ideal and too far in the future</p>
<p>to make it happen right now.</p>
<p>And people were just not there yet morally.</p>
<p>And the same thing happened with Christianity, right?</p>
<p>This notion of heaven was mythologized</p>
<p>and projected into an afterlife.</p>
<p>And I think this was just the idea of God&rsquo;s kingdom</p>
<p>of this world in which we instantiate</p>
<p>the next level transcendental agent in the perfect form.</p>
<p>So everything goes smoothly and without violence</p>
<p>and without conflict and without this human messiness</p>
<p>on this economic messiness and the terror and coercion</p>
<p>that existed in the present societies.</p>
<p>And the idea of that the humans can exist at some point</p>
<p>exist at scale in a harmonious way and noncoercively</p>
<p>is untested, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people tested it</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t get it to work so far.</p>
<p>And the utopia is a world in where you get</p>
<p>all the good things without any of the bad things.</p>
<p>And you are, I think very susceptible to believe in utopias</p>
<p>when you are very young and don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that everything has to happen in causal patterns,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s always feedback loops</p>
<p>that ultimately are closed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that just happens</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>Good or bad don&rsquo;t exist in isolation.</p>
<p>They only exist with respect to larger systems.</p>
<p>So can you intuit why utopias fail as systems?</p>
<p>So like having a utopia that&rsquo;s out there beyond the horizon</p>
<p>is it because then,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not only because it&rsquo;s impossible to achieve utopias</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because what certain humans,</p>
<p>certain small number of humans start to sort of greedily</p>
<p>attain power and money and control and influence</p>
<p>as they become,</p>
<p>as they see the power in using this idea of a utopia</p>
<p>for propaganda.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like saying, why is my garden not perfect?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because some evil weeds are overgrowing it</p>
<p>and they always do, right?</p>
<p>But this is not how it works.</p>
<p>A good garden is a system that is in balance</p>
<p>and requires minimal interactions by the gardener.</p>
<p>And so you need to create a system</p>
<p>that is designed to self stabilize.</p>
<p>And the design of social systems</p>
<p>requires not just the implementation</p>
<p>of the desired functionality,</p>
<p>but the next level design, also in biological systems.</p>
<p>You need to create a system that wants to converge</p>
<p>to the intended function.</p>
<p>And so instead of just creating an institution like the FDA</p>
<p>that is performing a particular kind of role in society,</p>
<p>you need to make sure that the FDA is actually driven</p>
<p>by a system that wants to do this optimally,</p>
<p>that is incentivized to do it optimally</p>
<p>and then makes the performance that is actually enacted</p>
<p>in every generation instrumental to that thing,</p>
<p>that actual goal, right?</p>
<p>And that is much harder to design and to achieve.</p>
<p>See if the design a system where,</p>
<p>and listen communism also was quote unquote incentivized</p>
<p>to be a feedback loop system that achieves that utopia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it wasn&rsquo;t working given human nature.</p>
<p>The incentives were not correct given human nature.</p>
<p>How do you incentivize people</p>
<p>when they are getting coal off the ground</p>
<p>to work as hard as possible?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a terrible job</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very bad for your health.</p>
<p>And right, how do you do this?</p>
<p>And you can give them prices and medals and status</p>
<p>to some degree, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so much status to give for that.</p>
<p>And most people will not fall for this, right?</p>
<p>Or you can pay them and you probably have to pay them</p>
<p>in an asymmetric way because if you pay everybody the same</p>
<p>and you nationalize the coal mines,</p>
<p>eventually people will figure out</p>
<p>that they can game the system.</p>
<p>Yes, so you&rsquo;re describing capitalism.</p>
<p>So capitalism is the present solution to the system.</p>
<p>And what we also noticed that I think that Marx was correct</p>
<p>in saying that capitalism is prone to crisis,</p>
<p>that capitalism is a system that in its dynamics</p>
<p>is not convergent, but divergent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a stable system.</p>
<p>And that eventually it produces an enormous potential</p>
<p>for productivity, but it also is systematically</p>
<p>misallocating resources.</p>
<p>So a lot of people cannot participate</p>
<p>in the production and consumption anymore, right?</p>
<p>And this is what we observed.</p>
<p>We observed that the middle class in the US is tiny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of people think that they&rsquo;re middle class,</p>
<p>but if you are still flying economy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not middle class, right?</p>
<p>Every class is a magnitude smaller than the previous class.</p>
<p>And I think about classes is really like airline class.</p>
<p>I like class.</p>
<p>A lot of people are economy class, business class,</p>
<p>and very few are first class and some are budget.</p>
<p>I mean, some, I understand.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, yeah, maybe some people,</p>
<p>probably I would push back</p>
<p>against that definition of the middle class.</p>
<p>It does feel like the middle class is pretty large,</p>
<p>but yes, there&rsquo;s a discrepancy in terms of wealth.</p>
<p>So if you think about in terms of the productivity</p>
<p>that our society could have,</p>
<p>there is no reason for anybody to fly economy, right?</p>
<p>We would be able to let everybody travel in style.</p>
<p>Well, but also some people like to be frugal</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re billionaires, okay?</p>
<p>So like that, let&rsquo;s take that into account.</p>
<p>I mean, we probably don&rsquo;t need to be a traveling lavish,</p>
<p>but you also don&rsquo;t need to be tortured, right?</p>
<p>There is a difference between frugal</p>
<p>and subjecting yourself to torture.</p>
<p>Listen, I love economy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re comparing</p>
<p>a fly economy to torture.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, although the fight here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two crying babies next to me.</p>
<p>So that, but that has nothing to do with economy.</p>
<p>It has to do with crying babies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very cute though.</p>
<p>So they kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have two kids</p>
<p>and sometimes I have to go back to visit the grandparents.</p>
<p>And that means going from the west coast to Germany</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a long flight.</p>
<p>Is it true that, so when you&rsquo;re a father,</p>
<p>you grow immune to the crying and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>like the, because like me just not having kids,</p>
<p>it can be other people&rsquo;s kids can be quite annoying</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re crying and screaming</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>When you have children and you are wired up</p>
<p>in the default natural way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lucky in this regard, you fall in love with them.</p>
<p>And this falling in love with them means</p>
<p>that you basically start to see the world through their eyes</p>
<p>and you understand that in a given situation,</p>
<p>they cannot do anything but being expressing despair.</p>
<p>And so it becomes more differentiated.</p>
<p>I noticed that for instance,</p>
<p>my son is typically acting on a pure experience</p>
<p>of what things are like right now</p>
<p>and he has to do this right now.</p>
<p>And you have this small child that is,</p>
<p>when he was a baby and so on,</p>
<p>where he was just immediately expressing what he felt.</p>
<p>And if you cannot regulate this from the outside,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no point to be upset about it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like dealing with weather or something like this.</p>
<p>You all have to get through it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not easy for him either.</p>
<p>But if you also have a daughter,</p>
<p>maybe she is planning for that.</p>
<p>Maybe she understands that she&rsquo;s sitting in the car</p>
<p>behind you and she&rsquo;s screaming at the top of her lungs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re almost doing an accident</p>
<p>and you really don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>What should I have done to make you stop screaming?</p>
<p>You could have given me candy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like a cat versus dog discussion.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Cause you said like a fundamental aspect of that is love</p>
<p>that makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>What, in this monkey riding an elephant in a dream world,</p>
<p>what role does love play in the human condition?</p>
<p>I think that love is the facilitator</p>
<p>of non transactional interaction.</p>
<p>And you are observing your own purposes.</p>
<p>Some of these purposes go beyond your ego.</p>
<p>They go beyond the particular organism</p>
<p>that you are and your local interests.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you mean by non transactional.</p>
<p>Yes, so basically when you are acting</p>
<p>in a transactional way, it means that you are respecting</p>
<p>something in return for you</p>
<p>from the one that you&rsquo;re interacting with.</p>
<p>You are interacting with a random stranger,</p>
<p>you buy something from them on eBay,</p>
<p>you expect a fair value for the money that you sent them</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t know that person,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have any kind of relationship to them.</p>
<p>But when you know this person a little bit better</p>
<p>and you know the situation that they&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>you understand what they try to achieve in their life</p>
<p>and you approve because you realize that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in some sense serving the same human sacredness as you are.</p>
<p>And they need to think that you have,</p>
<p>maybe you give it to them as a present.</p>
<p>But, I mean, the feeling itself of joy is a kind of benefit,</p>
<p>is a kind of transaction, like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, but the joy is not the point.</p>
<p>The joy is the signal that you get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reinforcement signal that your brain sends to you</p>
<p>because you are acting on the incentives</p>
<p>of the agent that you&rsquo;re a part of.</p>
<p>We are meant to be part of something larger.</p>
<p>This is the way in which we out competed other hominins.</p>
<p>Take that Neanderthals.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And also other humans.</p>
<p>There was a population bottleneck for human society</p>
<p>that leads to an extreme lack of genetic diversity</p>
<p>among humans.</p>
<p>If you look at Bushmen in the Kalahari,</p>
<p>that basically tribes that are not that far distant</p>
<p>to each other have more genetic diversity</p>
<p>than exists between Europeans and Chinese.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because basically the out of Africa population</p>
<p>at some point had a bottleneck</p>
<p>of just a few thousand individuals.</p>
<p>And what probably happened is not that at any time</p>
<p>the number of people shrank below a few hundred thousand.</p>
<p>What probably happened is that there was a small group</p>
<p>that had a decisive mutation that produced an advantage.</p>
<p>And this group multiplied and killed everybody else.</p>
<p>And we are descendants of that group.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder what the peculiar characteristics</p>
<p>of that group.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, we can never know.</p>
<p>Me too, and a lot of people do.</p>
<p>We can only just listen to the echoes in ours,</p>
<p>like the ripples that are still within us.</p>
<p>So I suspect what eventually made a big difference</p>
<p>was the ability to organize at scale,</p>
<p>to program each other.</p>
<p>With ideas.</p>
<p>That we became programmable,</p>
<p>that we were willing to work in lockstep,</p>
<p>that we went above the tribal level,</p>
<p>that we no longer were groups of a few hundred individuals</p>
<p>and acted on direct reputation systems transactionally,</p>
<p>but that we basically evolved an adaptation</p>
<p>to become state building.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To form collectives outside of the direct collectives.</p>
<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s basically a part of us became committed</p>
<p>to serving something outside of what we know.</p>
<p>Yeah, then that&rsquo;s kind of what love is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s terrifying because it meant</p>
<p>that we eradicated the others.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s a force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an adaptive force that gets us ahead in evolution,</p>
<p>which means we displace something else</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Oh, so we had to murder a lot of people</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t about love.</p>
<p>So love led to destruction.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have the same strong love as we did.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s why I mentioned this thing with fascism.</p>
<p>When you see these speeches, do you want total war?</p>
<p>And everybody says, yes, right?</p>
<p>This is this big, oh my God, we are part of something</p>
<p>that is more important than me</p>
<p>that gives meaning to my existence.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people today</p>
<p>in high school, in college,</p>
<p>that are thinking about what to do with their career,</p>
<p>with their life, so that at the end of the whole thing,</p>
<p>they can be proud of what they did?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t cheat.</p>
<p>Have integrity, aim for integrity.</p>
<p>So what does integrity look like when you&rsquo;re at the river</p>
<p>or the leaf or the fat frog in a lake?</p>
<p>It basically means that you try to figure out</p>
<p>what the thing is that is the most right.</p>
<p>And this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to look</p>
<p>for what other people tell you what&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>but you have to aim for moral autonomy.</p>
<p>So things need to be right independently</p>
<p>of what other people say.</p>
<p>I always felt that when people told me</p>
<p>to listen to what others say, like read the room,</p>
<p>build your ideas of what&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>based on the high status people of your in group,</p>
<p>that does not protect me from fascism.</p>
<p>The only way to protect yourself from fascism</p>
<p>is to decide it&rsquo;s the world that is being built here,</p>
<p>the world that I want to be in.</p>
<p>And so in some sense, try to make your behavior sustainable,</p>
<p>act in such a way that you would feel comfortable</p>
<p>on all sides of the transaction.</p>
<p>Realize that everybody is you in a different timeline,</p>
<p>but is seeing things differently</p>
<p>and has reasons to do so.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve come to realize this recently,</p>
<p>that there is an inner voice</p>
<p>that tells you what&rsquo;s right and wrong.</p>
<p>And speaking of reading the room,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s times what integrity looks like</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s times when a lot of people</p>
<p>are doing something wrong.</p>
<p>And what integrity looks like</p>
<p>is not going on Twitter and tweeting about it,</p>
<p>but not participating quietly, not doing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like signaling or not all this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but actually living your, what you think is right.</p>
<p>Like living it, not signaling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also sometimes this expectation</p>
<p>that others are like us.</p>
<p>So imagine the possibility</p>
<p>that some of the people around you are space aliens</p>
<p>that only look human, right?</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t have the same prayers as you do.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the same impulses</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s right and wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a large diversity in these basic impulses</p>
<p>that people can have in a given situation.</p>
<p>And now realize that you are a space alien, right?</p>
<p>You are not actually human.</p>
<p>You think that you are human,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what it means,</p>
<p>like what it&rsquo;s like to be human.</p>
<p>You just make it up as you go along like everybody else.</p>
<p>And you have to figure that out,</p>
<p>what it means that you are a full human being,</p>
<p>what it means to be human in the world</p>
<p>and how to connect with others on that.</p>
<p>And there is also something, don&rsquo;t be afraid</p>
<p>in the sense that if you do this, you&rsquo;re not good enough.</p>
<p>Because if you are acting on these incentives of integrity,</p>
<p>you become trustworthy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way in which you can recognize each other.</p>
<p>There is a particular place where you can meet.</p>
<p>You can figure out what that place is,</p>
<p>where you will give support to people</p>
<p>because you realize that they act with integrity</p>
<p>and they will also do that.</p>
<p>So in some sense, you are safe if you do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not always protected.</p>
<p>There are people which will abuse you</p>
<p>and that are bad actors in a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine before you meet them.</p>
<p>But there is also people which will try to protect you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s such a, thank you for saying that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a hopeful message</p>
<p>that no matter what happens to you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a place, there&rsquo;s people you&rsquo;ll meet</p>
<p>that also have what you have</p>
<p>and you will find happiness there and safety there.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to end well.</p>
<p>It can also all go wrong.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no guarantees in this life.</p>
<p>So you can do everything right and you still can fail</p>
<p>and you can see horrible things happening to you</p>
<p>that traumatize you and mutilate you</p>
<p>and you have to be grateful if it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And ultimately be grateful no matter what happens</p>
<p>because even just being alive is pretty damn nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, even that, you know.</p>
<p>The gratefulness in some sense is also just generated</p>
<p>by your brain to keep you going, it&rsquo;s all the trick.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Camus said,</p>
<p>I see many people die because they judge</p>
<p>that life is not worth living.</p>
<p>I see others paradoxically getting killed</p>
<p>for the ideas or illusions that give them</p>
<p>a reason for living.</p>
<p>What is called the reason for living</p>
<p>is also an excellent reason for dying.</p>
<p>I therefore conclude that the meaning of life</p>
<p>is the most urgent of questions.</p>
<p>So I have to ask what Jascha Bach is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>It is an urgent question according to Camus.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a single answer to this.</p>
<p>Nothing makes sense unless the mind makes it so.</p>
<p>So you basically have to project a purpose.</p>
<p>And if you zoom out far enough,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the heat test of the universe</p>
<p>and everything is meaningless,</p>
<p>everything is just a blip in between.</p>
<p>And the question is, do you find meaning</p>
<p>in this blip in between?</p>
<p>Do you find meaning in observing squirrels?</p>
<p>Do you find meaning in raising children</p>
<p>and projecting a multi generational organism</p>
<p>into the future?</p>
<p>Do you find meaning in projecting an aesthetic</p>
<p>of the world that you like to the future</p>
<p>and trying to serve that aesthetic?</p>
<p>And if you do, then life has that meaning.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, then it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I kind of enjoy the idea that you just create</p>
<p>the most vibrant, the most weird,</p>
<p>the most unique kind of blip you can,</p>
<p>given your environment, given your set of skills,</p>
<p>just be the most weird set of,</p>
<p>like local pocket of complexity you can be.</p>
<p>So that like, when people study the universe,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pause and be like, oh, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It looks like a useful strategy,</p>
<p>but of course it&rsquo;s still motivated reasoning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re obviously acting on your incentives here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a story we tell ourselves within a dream</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hardly in touch with the reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a good strategy if you are a podcaster.</p>
<p>And a human, which I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out if I am.</p>
<p>It has a mutual relationship somehow.</p>
<p>Somehow.</p>
<p>Josh, you&rsquo;re one of the most incredible people I know.</p>
<p>I really love talking to you.</p>
<p>I love talking to you again,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really an honor that you spend</p>
<p>your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>I hope we get to talk many times</p>
<p>through our short and meaningless lives.</p>
<p>Or meaningful.</p>
<p>Thank you, Alex.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this conversation very much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Josche Bach.</p>
<p>A thank you to Coinbase, Codecademy, Linode,</p>
<p>NetSuite, and ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>Now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.</p>
<p>People will do anything, no matter how absurd,</p>
<p>in order to avoid facing their own souls.</p>
<p>One does not become enlightened</p>
<p>by imagining figures of light,</p>
<p>but by making the darkness conscious.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
