    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are talking all about the science of gratitude.</p>
<p>In part, we&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>because of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday,</p>
<p>which of course is all about giving thanks, gratitude,</p>
<p>but also because there&rsquo;s now a wealth of data</p>
<p>showing that having an effective gratitude practice</p>
<p>can impact a huge number of health variables,</p>
<p>both mental health and physical health in positive ways.</p>
<p>Things like cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>things like relationships,</p>
<p>things like mental health,</p>
<p>things like physical and cognitive performance,</p>
<p>and these are not small effects.</p>
<p>These are very large positive effects.</p>
<p>However, in researching this episode,</p>
<p>I was completely surprised as to what constitutes</p>
<p>an effective gratitude practice.</p>
<p>I, I think like many of you,</p>
<p>would have thought that an effective gratitude practice</p>
<p>simply involves writing down a few things</p>
<p>or many things that we&rsquo;re grateful for,</p>
<p>or thinking about those,</p>
<p>or really making an effort to somaticize</p>
<p>or feel some of the elements of gratitude</p>
<p>while writing out that list or thinking about that list.</p>
<p>It turns out that an effective gratitude practice</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t resemble that at all.</p>
<p>The neuroimaging data, the physiological data,</p>
<p>looking at things like inflammatory markers,</p>
<p>other studies purely looking at the psychology</p>
<p>and the long and short-term effects</p>
<p>of an effective gratitude practice</p>
<p>point to a completely different approach</p>
<p>to using gratitude to positively impact health metrics.</p>
<p>Fortunately, these are things that we can all do very easily.</p>
<p>Some of them are actually fun.</p>
<p>You can do them in a variety of contexts.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>the science of effective gratitude practices,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to describe what those are</p>
<p>and how you can incorporate them into your life.</p>
<p>Before we dive into today&rsquo;s topic,</p>
<p>I just want to highlight</p>
<p>a particularly interesting set of findings</p>
<p>from the literature.</p>
<p>This is a study that came out in the journal Cell Report,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very relevant to today&rsquo;s topic.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re going to spend more time with this paper</p>
<p>a little bit later in the episode.</p>
<p>The study involved having subjects listen to a story.</p>
<p>The subjects are all listening to the same story,</p>
<p>but those subjects are not listening to it together.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not rounded up in a circle or all in a room.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in separate rooms</p>
<p>or entirely separate locations on the planet,</p>
<p>or they are actually brought into the laboratory</p>
<p>on separate days.</p>
<p>What this study found is that different subjects</p>
<p>listening to the same story</p>
<p>undergo the same variation in heart rate.</p>
<p>In other words, the gaps between their heartbeats</p>
<p>start to resemble one another</p>
<p>in response to the same story.</p>
<p>Now, this is very interesting.</p>
<p>This is a coordination of the physiology of the body</p>
<p>in response to a narrative, a story.</p>
<p>In different people,</p>
<p>and yet when they line up the heart rates</p>
<p>of these different people</p>
<p>who listen to the story at completely different times,</p>
<p>they find that those heart rates map onto one another</p>
<p>almost identically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really remarkable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about what this means</p>
<p>in terms of coordination of neural circuits in the brain</p>
<p>and neural circuits in the body</p>
<p>and the organs such as the heart,</p>
<p>but also the lungs and other organs of the body,</p>
<p>and what this means for changing one&rsquo;s overall state.</p>
<p>A key theme that&rsquo;s going to come up today again and again</p>
<p>is the distinction between traits,</p>
<p>which are pervasive aspects of who we are</p>
<p>and how we tend to react</p>
<p>to different types of circumstances,</p>
<p>and states, which are more transient.</p>
<p>They tend to, you can invoke a state in somebody,</p>
<p>a state of fear or a state of relaxation,</p>
<p>but what this study really starts to point to</p>
<p>is that there are specific approaches</p>
<p>that any of us can take</p>
<p>in order to really rewire our nervous system</p>
<p>such that we are calmer,</p>
<p>if we want to be calmer in certain circumstances,</p>
<p>that we are more responsive in certain circumstances,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s our goal.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll return to how one would go about doing that.</p>
<p>I think these results are just beautiful</p>
<p>in the sense that they really show</p>
<p>that our brain and our body are highly coordinated</p>
<p>because people are listening to the story</p>
<p>and the heart rate is changing in response to the story,</p>
<p>but that there is a, what we call a stereotypy,</p>
<p>a sort of stereotyped response to a given story.</p>
<p>In my mind, there was no reason</p>
<p>why the results had to be this way.</p>
<p>Two people listen to the same story,</p>
<p>why should their heart rates</p>
<p>be almost identical to the same story?</p>
<p>Very, very interesting</p>
<p>and points to the power of narrative and story</p>
<p>in coordinating our physiology.</p>
<p>And this is something powerful that we can leverage.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about gratitude.</p>
<p>And to begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize the various aspects</p>
<p>of mental and physical health that have been shown</p>
<p>to benefit from a regular gratitude practice.</p>
<p>There are studies showing</p>
<p>that performing a gratitude practice twice or three times,</p>
<p>or even just once a week, can lead to a pervasive,</p>
<p>a long-lasting impact on subjective wellbeing.</p>
<p>People report feeling happier, more meaning, joy,</p>
<p>even awe for their life experience,</p>
<p>simply in response to adding a gratitude practice.</p>
<p>The key thing is it has to be the right gratitude practice,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>what the right gratitude practice looks like</p>
<p>in just a little bit.</p>
<p>But there are additional benefits of a gratitude practice.</p>
<p>There are studies showing</p>
<p>that a regular gratitude practice</p>
<p>can provide resilience to trauma in two ways.</p>
<p>It can provide a reframing and resilience</p>
<p>to prior traumatic experiences,</p>
<p>so buffering people against the negative physiological</p>
<p>effects and psychological effects of earlier trauma,</p>
<p>but also inoculating them in many ways</p>
<p>to any traumas that might arrive later in life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a powerful thing.</p>
<p>And today, we will talk about</p>
<p>how that&rsquo;s actually accomplished.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually accomplished by shifting the way</p>
<p>that the fear and defense networks</p>
<p>in the brain actually function.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get right down into the details of that.</p>
<p>The other thing that a gratitude practice does</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s been shown to benefit social relationships,</p>
<p>but not just for the relationship</p>
<p>in which you express gratitude, right?</p>
<p>So on the face of it, you might think,</p>
<p>okay, if I express gratitude for somebody over and over,</p>
<p>over and over, over and over,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m going to feel better about that person.</p>
<p>And indeed, that is one effect of a gratitude practice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called a prosocial or intersocial gratitude practice.</p>
<p>But there are now several studies,</p>
<p>recent studies in good journals,</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that a regular gratitude practice</p>
<p>can also enhance one&rsquo;s social relationships</p>
<p>across the board, in the workplace, at school,</p>
<p>with family, in romantic relationships,</p>
<p>and even one&rsquo;s relationship to themselves,</p>
<p>which is really what the subjective feelings</p>
<p>of wellbeing are.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear to me that an effective gratitude practice</p>
<p>has an outsized effect on many, many aspects</p>
<p>of mental and physical health.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are coming to this conversation</p>
<p>thinking gratitude practice,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s kind of wishy-washy or woo,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to involve putting your hand on your heart</p>
<p>and feeling into all the amazing things</p>
<p>that you happen to have,</p>
<p>even when things are really terrible,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not where we&rsquo;re going at all.</p>
<p>And equally important is to understand</p>
<p>that the neurochemical, the anti-inflammatory,</p>
<p>and the neural circuit mechanisms</p>
<p>that gratitude can invoke are equally on par</p>
<p>with some of the effects of pharmacology,</p>
<p>of things like high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>and exercise, and other things that we think of</p>
<p>as kind of more potent forms of self-intervention.</p>
<p>So if you are of the mindset that a gratitude practice</p>
<p>is kind of weak sauce, buckle up,</p>
<p>because the data actually point to the fact</p>
<p>that a gratitude practice is a very, very potent way</p>
<p>in which you can steer your mental and physical health</p>
<p>in positive directions,</p>
<p>and that those effects are very long lasting.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the tools and mechanisms</p>
<p>and scientific studies around gratitude,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just set the framework for the discussion.</p>
<p>Gratitude is what we call a pro-social behavior</p>
<p>or a pro-social mindset.</p>
<p>Now, you can be grateful for something</p>
<p>without it involving anybody else.</p>
<p>So the social part isn&rsquo;t meant to convey anything</p>
<p>about interpersonal relations, although it can.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to talk a lot</p>
<p>about how interpersonal relations can be incorporated</p>
<p>into a gratitude practice in really powerful ways.</p>
<p>But pro-social behaviors are basically any behavior</p>
<p>or mode of thinking that allow us to be more effective</p>
<p>in interactions with other people, including ourselves.</p>
<p>Now, pro-social is not just a name</p>
<p>that we give these different tools</p>
<p>and practices and mindsets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually neural circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that are specifically wired</p>
<p>for pro-social thoughts and behaviors.</p>
<p>And these are distinctly different</p>
<p>from the circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in defensive behaviors.</p>
<p>So without getting into too much detail just yet,</p>
<p>we will later, we have circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that are what we call appetitive.</p>
<p>They are designed to bring us closer to things</p>
<p>and to bring us into closer relation</p>
<p>to the details of that sensory experience.</p>
<p>Now, that could be a delicious food that you&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>It could be interacting with a loved one.</p>
<p>It could be interacting with a friend</p>
<p>or anyone that you happen to like.</p>
<p>It could even be in relation to yourself.</p>
<p>These circuits that we&rsquo;re calling pro-social circuits</p>
<p>light up in the brain in neuroimaging,</p>
<p>meaning the neurons are firing more actively,</p>
<p>more electrically, robustly,</p>
<p>sort of like turning up the volume</p>
<p>on these neural circuits in the brain.</p>
<p>And the neural circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with aversive or defensive behaviors,</p>
<p>things like backing up,</p>
<p>things like covering up the vital organs of the body,</p>
<p>things like a quaking of the voice,</p>
<p>all of the things that are associated</p>
<p>with defensive behaviors are actually antagonized,</p>
<p>meaning they are reduced</p>
<p>when the pro-social circuits are more active.</p>
<p>So the framework here that I&rsquo;d like to set</p>
<p>is that we have this kind of seesaw</p>
<p>of neural circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>one set that are pro-social</p>
<p>and are designed to bring us closer to others,</p>
<p>including ourselves,</p>
<p>closer to certain sensory experiences, right?</p>
<p>Because a lot of pro-social behaviors</p>
<p>can also be geared towards things like pets or food</p>
<p>or anything that we find we want to be closer to</p>
<p>and want more of.</p>
<p>Whereas the defensive circuits involve areas of the brain,</p>
<p>yes, such as areas that are involved in fear,</p>
<p>but also areas of the brain and body</p>
<p>that are literally associated with freezing</p>
<p>or with backing up.</p>
<p>So the way to think about gratitude</p>
<p>is that it falls under this category of pro-social behaviors</p>
<p>which are designed to bring us closer</p>
<p>to different types of things</p>
<p>and to enhance the level of detail</p>
<p>that we extract from those experiences.</p>
<p>Now, the existence of these two neural circuits</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve placed on this sort of metaphorical seesaw,</p>
<p>if you will,</p>
<p>runs counter to a lot of the messaging</p>
<p>or the ideas that were put forth in the last century</p>
<p>about the psychology of happiness and gratitude</p>
<p>versus the psychology of depression and struggle</p>
<p>and concern about the future.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d like to read a quote from the great,</p>
<p>and we really should call him the great Sigmund Freud</p>
<p>because despite having certain traits</p>
<p>that people criticize him of,</p>
<p>Freud was indeed a genius about many aspects of psychology.</p>
<p>But I just want to read you Freud&rsquo;s stance on happiness</p>
<p>and this invokes elements of gratitude as well.</p>
<p>And then you can gauge for yourself.</p>
<p>Quote, our possibilities of happiness</p>
<p>are already restricted by our constitution.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s saying that we&rsquo;re basically wired</p>
<p>to not have happiness easily.</p>
<p>Unhappiness is much less difficult to experience.</p>
<p>We are threatened with suffering from three directions.</p>
<p>One, from our own body,</p>
<p>which is doomed to decay and disillusion</p>
<p>and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety</p>
<p>as warning signals.</p>
<p>Two, from the external world,</p>
<p>which may rage against us with overwhelming</p>
<p>and merciless forces of destruction.</p>
<p>And three, and finally, from our relations with others,</p>
<p>the suffering of which from this last source</p>
<p>is perhaps more painful to us than any other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Sigmund Freud.</p>
<p>And not all of his writings were that pessimistic,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>What Freud is referring to there</p>
<p>are those defensive circuits.</p>
<p>And of course he talked about psychological defensives.</p>
<p>And in full disclosure,</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of much of the psychological literature</p>
<p>and psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud</p>
<p>and his descendants, Jung and others.</p>
<p>I think there are strong elements of truth there.</p>
<p>But it gives you a sense of the kind of mindset</p>
<p>of psychology early in the last century.</p>
<p>And then of course was the emergence</p>
<p>of the positive psychology movement,</p>
<p>which was really about invoking the understanding</p>
<p>and eventually the elucidation of the neural circuits</p>
<p>for things like happiness and awe and affiliation</p>
<p>and things that we are calling pro-social circuits.</p>
<p>So the field of psychology has a darkened light,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>And the field of neuroscience has a darkened light.</p>
<p>You have these, what we call parallel pathways in the brain.</p>
<p>And we have parallel pathways in the mind</p>
<p>that set us up for feeling good about things</p>
<p>or for feeling less good about things.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s really salient from the quote from Freud</p>
<p>is that what he&rsquo;s saying is our default</p>
<p>is to be concerned about the future,</p>
<p>to be wrapped in our defenses.</p>
<p>And to some extent that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And the reason we can say that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>is because most of us need a gratitude practice.</p>
<p>We need to do certain things</p>
<p>in order to feel good and to feel happy.</p>
<p>We actually have to put work into it.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that there&rsquo;s an asymmetry</p>
<p>in the way that these pro-social</p>
<p>versus defensive circuits are set up,</p>
<p>such that because defensive circuits</p>
<p>are designed to keep us safe,</p>
<p>psychologically and physically safe,</p>
<p>that they have more robustness</p>
<p>or they can actually drive our behavior more easily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an analogy in the system</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m most familiar with as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>which is the visual system.</p>
<p>In the visual system, we have parallel pathways.</p>
<p>We have neurons in our eye that respond</p>
<p>when things in our environment get brighter.</p>
<p>Literally, when the lights go up,</p>
<p>these neurons start firing like crazy.</p>
<p>And we have neurons in our eye</p>
<p>that respond when things get darker,</p>
<p>when things start dimming or go from white to black.</p>
<p>The circuits for detecting darkening</p>
<p>are much more robust and much more numerous</p>
<p>than are the circuits for brightness.</p>
<p>And that is probably related, probably,</p>
<p>to the fact that dark objects</p>
<p>or experiencing looming, meaning incoming objects,</p>
<p>and being able to perceive them</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s vital to our survival.</p>
<p>Whereas being able to perceive the brightening of things</p>
<p>might be important to survival in certain contexts,</p>
<p>you know, car lights coming at you at night</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>but not as often in a kind of a evolutionary</p>
<p>or ethological context as the darkening of things.</p>
<p>So I think Freud&rsquo;s quote and the field of psychology</p>
<p>now point to the fact that,</p>
<p>indeed, we have the capacity for happiness</p>
<p>and we have the capacity for great worry and concern</p>
<p>and depression and unhappiness.</p>
<p>And the neural circuit literature also supports that.</p>
<p>The key thing for today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>is that gratitude turns out to be</p>
<p>one of the most potent wedges</p>
<p>by which we can insert our thinking,</p>
<p>and as you also see the physiology of our body,</p>
<p>between these two circuits</p>
<p>and give a little more levity, if you will,</p>
<p>to the side of the seesaw that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with positive pro-social feelings.</p>
<p>And if you keep imagining this seesaw imagery,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really beautiful about gratitude practices</p>
<p>is that if they&rsquo;re performed repeatedly,</p>
<p>and not even that often, but repeatedly,</p>
<p>then one can actually shift their neural circuits</p>
<p>such that the seesaw that I&rsquo;m calling</p>
<p>pro-social versus defensive behaviors</p>
<p>can actually start to tilt,</p>
<p>and the little hinge, if you will,</p>
<p>on the seesaw in the middle</p>
<p>can be adjusted in a little tighter</p>
<p>when the side for gratitude and for wellbeing</p>
<p>and for feelings of happiness is a little bit higher.</p>
<p>What this means is that</p>
<p>whether or not Freud was right or wrong,</p>
<p>whether or not the neuroscientists in one camp</p>
<p>or another are right or wrong,</p>
<p>we now know with certainty</p>
<p>that a regular gratitude practice</p>
<p>can shift the pro-social circuit</p>
<p>so that they dominate our physiology and our mindset</p>
<p>in ways that can enhance many, many aspects</p>
<p>of our physical and mental health by default.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t always have to constantly be in practice</p>
<p>trying to be happy.</p>
<p>So the succinct way of saying all this is,</p>
<p>yes, indeed, we might be wired</p>
<p>or in such that we have a greater propensity</p>
<p>for unhappiness than happiness,</p>
<p>but gratitude practices,</p>
<p>provided they are the effective ones</p>
<p>and they are performed regularly,</p>
<p>can shift those circuits</p>
<p>such that we are happier on average</p>
<p>even when we are not performing those practices.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the neurochemistry</p>
<p>and neural circuits associated with gratitude</p>
<p>and pro-social behaviors.</p>
<p>Numerous times on this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about so-called neuromodulators.</p>
<p>Those of you that might&rsquo;ve forgotten</p>
<p>or have never heard of neuromodulators before,</p>
<p>neuromodulators are chemicals</p>
<p>that are released in the brain and body</p>
<p>that change the activity of other neural circuits.</p>
<p>They make certain brain areas more likely to be active</p>
<p>and other brain areas less likely to be active.</p>
<p>These neuromodulators have names like dopamine, serotonin,</p>
<p>acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so on.</p>
<p>The main neuromodulators associated with gratitude</p>
<p>and pro-social behaviors tends to be serotonin.</p>
<p>Serotonin is released from a very small collection</p>
<p>of neurons in the brainstem called the raphe,</p>
<p>R-A-P-H-E, the raphe nucleus,</p>
<p>and a few other places in the brain.</p>
<p>And the raphe neurons send these little wires</p>
<p>that we call axons out to numerous places in the brain.</p>
<p>And they tend to increase the activity</p>
<p>of particular neural circuits</p>
<p>that lend themselves to more approach</p>
<p>to particular types of experiences.</p>
<p>That makes total sense if you think about it.</p>
<p>Have a chemical that under certain circumstances</p>
<p>is released in the brain</p>
<p>that triggers the activity of neural circuits</p>
<p>that makes the organism, you,</p>
<p>more likely to stay in an interaction with something</p>
<p>or even lean in and seek a more detailed interaction</p>
<p>with that person, place, or thing.</p>
<p>Beautiful work from a cognitive neuropsychologist.</p>
<p>His name is Antonio Damasio.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a world-class neuroscientist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been in the game a very long time,</p>
<p>has explored the so-called neural correlates of gratitude.</p>
<p>And two main brain areas are activated</p>
<p>by these serotonergic systems.</p>
<p>And when people experience something</p>
<p>that makes them feel gratitude,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s shallow gratitude or deep,</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s all the way to deep gratitude,</p>
<p>they see activation of these particular brain circuits</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mention in a moment.</p>
<p>And the amount of activation scales</p>
<p>with how intensely the person experienced</p>
<p>the feeling of gratitude.</p>
<p>And those two areas have particular names.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know the names,</p>
<p>but for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>they are the anterior cingulate cortex</p>
<p>and the medial prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And of course, these brain areas are connected</p>
<p>to a number of other networks in the brain.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s how they get you or others</p>
<p>to lean into certain experiences,</p>
<p>because when these areas are active,</p>
<p>certain thought processes get invoked.</p>
<p>Those thought processes probably resemble something like,</p>
<p>hmm, I&rsquo;d like to experience more of this,</p>
<p>or hmm, this feels really good.</p>
<p>And then they literally feed onto your muscles</p>
<p>via the neurons, making you happy to stay stationary</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re experiencing something you like,</p>
<p>or to move closer to something</p>
<p>that you find attractive to you, literally.</p>
<p>So these are powerful circuits.</p>
<p>Of these two brain areas,</p>
<p>the one I&rsquo;d like to focus on the most</p>
<p>is the medial prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard</p>
<p>of the medial prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>because this is the area of the brain</p>
<p>that is involved in planning and in deep thinking</p>
<p>and evaluation of different types of experiences,</p>
<p>past, present, or future.</p>
<p>It seems actually that pretty much every study</p>
<p>of a human anything seems to involve</p>
<p>the medial prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>or at least one could get that impression</p>
<p>just by looking at scientific abstracts</p>
<p>and papers these days.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s worth us taking a step back</p>
<p>and asking what does the medial prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>really do, right?</p>
<p>How could this one piece of neural real estate</p>
<p>that we all have right behind our forehead,</p>
<p>how could that be involved in so many different things?</p>
<p>And the reason it can be involved</p>
<p>in so many different things,</p>
<p>and the reason it&rsquo;s especially important for gratitude</p>
<p>is that medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay?</p>
<p>It sets context,</p>
<p>and it literally defines the meaning of your experience.</p>
<p>Now, this is not at all an abstract phenomenon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give a very physiological example of this,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to translate it to gratitude.</p>
<p>But I really want everyone to understand</p>
<p>how is it that medial prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>sets the context of everything in your life?</p>
<p>Well, it does it the following way.</p>
<p>You have a number of circuits deeper in your brain</p>
<p>that simply create some sensations,</p>
<p>or they allow you, I should say,</p>
<p>to perceive certain sensations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the example of cold exposure,</p>
<p>something that we&rsquo;d sometimes talk about in this podcast</p>
<p>for other reasons.</p>
<p>If you were to deliberately place yourself into an ice bath,</p>
<p>it would be uncomfortable,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re adapted to cold and so forth.</p>
<p>The discomfort is non-negotiable.</p>
<p>However, if you are doing it because you want to,</p>
<p>or because you have knowledge</p>
<p>that there are particular health benefits,</p>
<p>the medial prefrontal cortex can then control areas</p>
<p>of your deeper brain, like the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>to positively impact the neurochemicals</p>
<p>that are released into your system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll still get a lot of adrenaline</p>
<p>by getting into the ice bath,</p>
<p>but the fact that you are doing this deliberately</p>
<p>and your knowledge that you are making the choice,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s deciding</p>
<p>to put yourself through this discomfort,</p>
<p>has been shown to create a very different</p>
<p>and positive effect on things like dopamine,</p>
<p>on things like anti-inflammatory markers</p>
<p>in your immune system, et cetera,</p>
<p>compared to if someone pushes you into an ice bath,</p>
<p>or if you are doing it because someone insists</p>
<p>that you do it and you really, really don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very subtle distinction here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the distinction of motivation and desire</p>
<p>or lack of motivation and being forced into something.</p>
<p>And there are a number of other effects</p>
<p>of this that have been described.</p>
<p>In the episode with Robert Sapolsky</p>
<p>that I did earlier this last year,</p>
<p>he talked about a study in animals,</p>
<p>which has also been shown in humans.</p>
<p>If you take a mouse, for instance,</p>
<p>and it runs on a running wheel,</p>
<p>which mice really like to do,</p>
<p>there are many positive effects on reducing blood pressure,</p>
<p>improvements in neurochemistry, et cetera, in that mouse.</p>
<p>However, if there&rsquo;s a mouse in the cage right next to it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trapped in the running wheel</p>
<p>and it has to run every time the other mouse runs</p>
<p>because the wheels are linked,</p>
<p>well then the second mouse that&rsquo;s forced</p>
<p>to do the exact same running</p>
<p>experiences negative shifts in their overall health metrics.</p>
<p>Blood pressure goes up, stress hormones go up, et cetera,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not actually making the choice.</p>
<p>Medial prefrontal cortex is the knob,</p>
<p>or the switch rather, that can take one experience</p>
<p>and allow us to frame it</p>
<p>such that it creates positive health effects.</p>
<p>And the exact same experience framed</p>
<p>as something we don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>or that we are forced to do</p>
<p>can create negative health effects.</p>
<p>Now, how exactly the neurons</p>
<p>in medial prefrontal cortex do that is rather complicated</p>
<p>and frankly, not completely understood.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s somehow able to adjust the activity</p>
<p>of other neural circuits that are purely reflexive.</p>
<p>As we say in neuroscience,</p>
<p>like really dumb neural circuits</p>
<p>that are just like switches and place a context onto it.</p>
<p>So gratitude is a mindset</p>
<p>that activates prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and in doing so sets the context of your experience</p>
<p>such that you can derive tremendous health benefits,</p>
<p>which leads us to the question,</p>
<p>what kind of gratitude practice</p>
<p>is going to accomplish this, right?</p>
<p>Because it is not simply the case</p>
<p>that I could take a knife,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, please don&rsquo;t do this experiment,</p>
<p>and cut my hand and say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, I&rsquo;m going to enjoy this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this because this is good for me</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;ll hurt just like the ice bath is cold</p>
<p>no matter what.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t lie to myself, right?</p>
<p>If I have some knowledge</p>
<p>that cutting myself is bad for me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very hard to override.</p>
<p>And so the medial prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>has a tremendous capacity to set context</p>
<p>and it does that beautifully with respect to gratitude,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t simply lie to yourself.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simply say,</p>
<p>oh, well, every experience is a learning experience</p>
<p>or, you know, a terrible thing that happens,</p>
<p>oh, good, I&rsquo;m just going to say good,</p>
<p>and that your body will react as if it&rsquo;s good for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a myth.</p>
<p>And frankly, it&rsquo;s a myth that&rsquo;s fairly pervasive</p>
<p>in the self-help and self-actualization literature.</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to reframe</p>
<p>and set context on our experiences,</p>
<p>but that requires a very specific set of practices.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t simply lie to ourselves</p>
<p>or quote unquote fake it until we make it.</p>
<p>Neural circuitry is very powerful and very plastic.</p>
<p>It can be modified and it&rsquo;s very context dependent,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not stupid.</p>
<p>And when you lie to yourself</p>
<p>about whether or not an experience</p>
<p>is actually good for you or not,</p>
<p>your brain knows.</p>
<p>So what does an effective gratitude practice look like?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s examine what an ineffective,</p>
<p>what a poor gratitude practice looks like,</p>
<p>because therein lies some really important information,</p>
<p>including the fact that I,</p>
<p>and I think millions of other people out there</p>
<p>are doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Most gratitude practices that you see online</p>
<p>and that people talk about in various talks and so forth</p>
<p>involve something like writing down or reciting</p>
<p>or thinking about five or 10 or three or 20 things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re especially grateful for.</p>
<p>And then really trying to feel into some of those,</p>
<p>really try and think deeply about the emotions,</p>
<p>the sensations, the perceptions that are associated</p>
<p>with those particular people, places,</p>
<p>and things on your list.</p>
<p>Most studies actually point to the fact</p>
<p>that that style of gratitude practice</p>
<p>is not particularly effective</p>
<p>in shifting your neural circuitry,</p>
<p>your neural chemistry or your somatic circuitry,</p>
<p>the circuits in your body,</p>
<p>because you literally have organs and neural circuits</p>
<p>that are connected,</p>
<p>the circuits of your brain and body</p>
<p>toward enhanced activation of prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>enhanced activation of these prosocial neural networks</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>Now that may come as a surprise to many of you</p>
<p>and certainly came as a surprise to me.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that if there&rsquo;s a shift</p>
<p>in so-called autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>during these gratitude practices,</p>
<p>these ones that I&rsquo;m calling ineffective,</p>
<p>that they can be made slightly more effective.</p>
<p>So what do I mean by a shift in autonomic arousal?</p>
<p>Well, very briefly, we have a aspect to our nervous system,</p>
<p>both within our brain and body</p>
<p>that we call the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of a misnomer</p>
<p>because autonomic means automatic.</p>
<p>And in fact, we can take control</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>It has one branch,</p>
<p>meaning one set of connections and circuits</p>
<p>that are associated with making us more alert,</p>
<p>the so-called sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>or I should say sympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really a mouthful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really associated with enhanced alertness</p>
<p>of any kind for excitement or fear.</p>
<p>And it has nothing to do with sympathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about enhanced alertness.</p>
<p>And then the other arm of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is the so-called parasympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s also a mouthful.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s the calming aspect</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s associated with decreased heart rate,</p>
<p>decreased breathing rate, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we have these two aspects to our autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and it has been shown that if people are brought</p>
<p>into a state of heightened sympathetic tone,</p>
<p>meaning more alertness,</p>
<p>then the intensity of the emotions that they experience</p>
<p>in their gratitude practice is enhanced</p>
<p>and the effectiveness of that gratitude practice</p>
<p>can be enhanced.</p>
<p>This is seen nowadays somewhat commonly</p>
<p>as having people, for instance,</p>
<p>cyclic hyperventilated breathing,</p>
<p>as we call it in my laboratory.</p>
<p>Breathing that&rsquo;s very intense of the inhale, exhale,</p>
<p>inhale, exhale very deeply for 25 or 30 breaths.</p>
<p>Then people will sit in a meditative stance</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll focus on their notepad and paper</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll write out the things that they&rsquo;re grateful for.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll really try and feel into those things</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll think about those things.</p>
<p>And it makes perfect sense</p>
<p>as to why enhancing autonomic arousal</p>
<p>toward more alertness would create more robust feelings</p>
<p>or more robust impact of these gratitude practices.</p>
<p>Because in that state, you are more alert</p>
<p>and therefore you are able to bring more detail,</p>
<p>more richness to the perception and the understanding</p>
<p>of what those things on your list happen to be.</p>
<p>But, and I should say that there are numerous</p>
<p>other approaches to this,</p>
<p>sort of self-help type stuff</p>
<p>and self-help actualization seminars,</p>
<p>people will do things like cold baths</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll do chanting</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll have any number of different experiences,</p>
<p>all of which are mainly geared</p>
<p>towards increased autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>You know, there are even practices out there</p>
<p>using pharmacology to create increased autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and then drop into gratitude.</p>
<p>Across the board, those increase the potency</p>
<p>of the gratitude practice of listing things out on paper</p>
<p>or in one&rsquo;s mind or saying them out loud.</p>
<p>But somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,</p>
<p>that form of just expressing thanks, expressing gratitude</p>
<p>is not the most effective way</p>
<p>to shift these pro-social circuits in positive ways</p>
<p>for one&rsquo;s physiology and anatomy and psychology.</p>
<p>Turns out that the most potent form of gratitude practice</p>
<p>is not a gratitude practice where you give gratitude</p>
<p>or express gratitude, but rather where you receive gratitude,</p>
<p>where you receive thanks.</p>
<p>And this, to me, was very surprising.</p>
<p>There are a number of studies about this now.</p>
<p>One in particular that I think is interesting</p>
<p>is called prefrontal activation</p>
<p>while listening to a letter of gratitude</p>
<p>read aloud by a coworker face-to-face, a NIRS study, N-I-R-S.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what all this means.</p>
<p>You now know what the prefrontal activation part is.</p>
<p>This is activation of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>The NIRS, N-I-R-S study, that&rsquo;s just a technical term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of imaging brain activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s non-invasive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a skull cap.</p>
<p>It looks like a hoodie with a bunch of wires</p>
<p>coming out of it, basically,</p>
<p>that can measure neural activity</p>
<p>without having to remove any parts of the skull</p>
<p>or put a person into one of these tube-like fMRI machines,</p>
<p>which is very invasive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a wonderful tool</p>
<p>because it allows human subjects in the laboratory</p>
<p>to move around and to engage with one another.</p>
<p>So in this particular experiment,</p>
<p>what they did is they had coworkers</p>
<p>write a letter of gratitude, of thanks,</p>
<p>to another coworker, unbeknownst to the other coworker.</p>
<p>And then they sat down together</p>
<p>and then they imaged brain activity</p>
<p>as this letter was being read</p>
<p>and as the letter was being heard, received.</p>
<p>And it showed very robust effects</p>
<p>on these prefrontal networks</p>
<p>that pointed to the fact that receiving gratitude</p>
<p>is actually much more potent</p>
<p>in terms of the positive shifts that it can create</p>
<p>than giving gratitude.</p>
<p>So this raises a couple of important points.</p>
<p>First of all, if you are somebody</p>
<p>who is prone to write letters of gratitude,</p>
<p>ideally, I think it&rsquo;s requisite</p>
<p>that these be genuine letters of gratitude</p>
<p>or saying things that are genuine expressions of gratitude.</p>
<p>This could be by text or in person or by phone.</p>
<p>You have within you a very potent form</p>
<p>of shifting somebody else&rsquo;s neurology.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>And I think there are many people like that out there.</p>
<p>But for many people who want to experience</p>
<p>the positive effects of gratitude,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not the most advantageous approach</p>
<p>to just sit around waiting,</p>
<p>hoping that someone&rsquo;s going to deliver</p>
<p>all these letters or words of gratitude.</p>
<p>How is it that you can create that sense</p>
<p>of receiving gratitude for yourself</p>
<p>and thereby derive the effects of gratitude</p>
<p>as outlined in this particular study?</p>
<p>And there we go back to the important work</p>
<p>of the great Antonio Damasio,</p>
<p>who explored these neural correlates of gratitude</p>
<p>to define the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with prosocial behaviors</p>
<p>like the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really interesting about the work</p>
<p>that Damasio and colleagues did is,</p>
<p>first of all, they used functional</p>
<p>magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
<p>So this is a very high resolution approach</p>
<p>to exploring what areas of the brain are active</p>
<p>and it has very high, what we call temporal resolution,</p>
<p>meaning you can see things in time at very fine scales.</p>
<p>So a lot of mechanistic detail</p>
<p>can emerge from these sorts of studies.</p>
<p>What they did was interesting,</p>
<p>rather than have people express gratitude,</p>
<p>they had the subjects go into the scanner,</p>
<p>so their brains are being imaged,</p>
<p>and they watched narratives, stories about other people</p>
<p>experiencing positive things in their life.</p>
<p>And in this case, these were powerful stories.</p>
<p>These were stories about survivors of genocide.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>The subjects were subjects</p>
<p>that were not survivors of genocide.</p>
<p>So they were watching these videotapes</p>
<p>of people that had survived genocide</p>
<p>and had people help them along the way</p>
<p>as part of their story of survival,</p>
<p>either psychological and, or obviously they survived</p>
<p>long enough to make the video, or physical survival.</p>
<p>So within these stories,</p>
<p>there was a conveyance of a lot of struggle.</p>
<p>These people talked about the horrible situations</p>
<p>they were in, but also small,</p>
<p>but highly significant features of their history</p>
<p>that had led to their own feelings of gratitude.</p>
<p>So for instance, you know, it says a woman at the,</p>
<p>this is literally from the scientific paper,</p>
<p>you know, somebody had been sick for weeks.</p>
<p>So the woman&rsquo;s describing how she&rsquo;d been sick for weeks.</p>
<p>And then another prisoner who was a doctor</p>
<p>finds a particular medicine somehow,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t describe how, and literally saves her life.</p>
<p>Or an ally who was also in a stricken circumstance</p>
<p>gave this person a pair of glasses</p>
<p>when their eyesight started to falter.</p>
<p>So these sorts of stories.</p>
<p>Now, just hearing this in the context</p>
<p>of nothing but a scientific paper and discussion,</p>
<p>these probably don&rsquo;t, aren&rsquo;t that impactful.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really important about this study</p>
<p>and is really important for all of us to know</p>
<p>is that these stories of other people receiving things</p>
<p>that were powerful for them in their life trajectory</p>
<p>is embedded in story.</p>
<p>And the human brain especially</p>
<p>is so oriented towards story.</p>
<p>We have neural circuits that like to link together</p>
<p>past, present, future, have different characters,</p>
<p>protagonists and antagonists.</p>
<p>From the time we&rsquo;re very young</p>
<p>until the time we&rsquo;re very old,</p>
<p>story is one of the major ways</p>
<p>that we organize information in the brain.</p>
<p>There does seem to be storytelling</p>
<p>and story listening circuits in the brain.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s important is not simply</p>
<p>that these people survived genocide,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s obviously important and wonderful,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just that they were helped along the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that the description of their help</p>
<p>is embedded in a larger story.</p>
<p>So the human subject in this scientific study</p>
<p>is watching these powerful stories.</p>
<p>And the neural circuits associated with pro-social behaviors</p>
<p>and with gratitude become robustly active</p>
<p>when they start to feel some affiliation</p>
<p>with the person telling the story.</p>
<p>They start to feel some resonance.</p>
<p>We might call that empathy,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be empathy.</p>
<p>Empathy is a somewhat complicated thing to define</p>
<p>because it involves literally a setting aside</p>
<p>of one&rsquo;s own emotions and really focusing almost entirely</p>
<p>or experiencing almost entirely the emotions of another.</p>
<p>It could be sympathy, it could be empathy.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the stories themselves</p>
<p>were able to shift the physiology of the subjects</p>
<p>in this study and activate these,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re calling gratitude circuitry</p>
<p>that involves the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>So if you think about the earlier study</p>
<p>that receiving gratitude is the most powerful way</p>
<p>to activate these circuits for gratitude,</p>
<p>the subjects in this study in many ways</p>
<p>are receiving a sense of gratitude,</p>
<p>but through the narrative of one of these other subjects,</p>
<p>which I find fascinating.</p>
<p>I would have thought a great gratitude practice</p>
<p>would be to sit down and list out</p>
<p>all the things you&rsquo;re grateful for.</p>
<p>That just seems so logical to me,</p>
<p>but it turns out that these neural circuits</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>That to really activate these circuits for gratitude</p>
<p>and the serotonin and probably the oxytocin system as well,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s prefrontal networks,</p>
<p>one has to powerfully associate</p>
<p>with the idea of receiving help.</p>
<p>Okay, the subjects are associating</p>
<p>or experiencing empathy or sympathy</p>
<p>for somebody else who received help.</p>
<p>In the other study we described a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>the person hearing the letter was receiving gratitude</p>
<p>and that would amplify the activity of these circuits.</p>
<p>And that takes us to a larger theme</p>
<p>of what are these pro-social circuits?</p>
<p>And an important concept to emerge from this</p>
<p>is one that&rsquo;s most often associated</p>
<p>with the autism literature, frankly,</p>
<p>which is this idea of theory of mind.</p>
<p>So just very briefly, theory of mind</p>
<p>is the ability to attribute</p>
<p>or to understand the experience of another</p>
<p>without actually experiencing</p>
<p>the thing that they&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>Again, it kind of sounds like empathy,</p>
<p>but this was actually a term</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now been demonstrated</p>
<p>in the psychology and neuroscience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been linked to some very robust findings</p>
<p>associated with brain areas and so forth</p>
<p>that was looking at autistic kids and non-autistic kids.</p>
<p>The person largely responsible</p>
<p>for developing theory of mind is Simon Baron-Cohen.</p>
<p>I believe he&rsquo;s either the brother or the cousin.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recall which, to the comedian, Sasha Baron-Cohen.</p>
<p>Simon Baron-Cohen is a professor at Oxford University,</p>
<p>or at least he was the last time I checked.</p>
<p>And the theory of mind test</p>
<p>can be done on adults or on children.</p>
<p>And we can sort of do that experiment right now if you like,</p>
<p>and you can think about how you would behave</p>
<p>if you were a subject in a theory of mind test.</p>
<p>Theory of mind test involves you or a child</p>
<p>or some other adult sitting down</p>
<p>and watching a video of a child going into a room</p>
<p>or a person going into a room,</p>
<p>opening up a desk or dresser, a drawer, for instance,</p>
<p>or a desk drawer, and placing something in it,</p>
<p>like a pen or a toy, and then leaving.</p>
<p>And then another person walking into the room</p>
<p>and clearly looking for something in the room.</p>
<p>And one presumes it&rsquo;s the toy or the pen,</p>
<p>depending on the context.</p>
<p>People who have strong theory of mind</p>
<p>make the obvious conclusion</p>
<p>that the person looking around for the pen or the toy</p>
<p>is confused or they&rsquo;re perplexed.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know where the toy is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for the toy.</p>
<p>Someone who is fairly far to one side of the autism</p>
<p>or Asperger&rsquo;s spectrum</p>
<p>will simply focus on the location of the object,</p>
<p>on the location of the pen or the toy.</p>
<p>And this is especially true in children.</p>
<p>They will say, well, it&rsquo;s in the second drawer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the second drawer.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, well,</p>
<p>how does the person who comes into the room feel?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, well, it&rsquo;s in the drawer.</p>
<p>So they tend to focus on the specific factual elements</p>
<p>of the scenario rather than place their mind</p>
<p>into the mind of the other person,</p>
<p>so-called theory of mind.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that people with autism</p>
<p>and Asperger&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have empathy.</p>
<p>In some cases they can.</p>
<p>It sort of depends on where they are</p>
<p>on the spectrum and so forth.</p>
<p>But theory of mind has very strong basis</p>
<p>in these prefrontal cortex neural circuits</p>
<p>that we were talking about,</p>
<p>because as you now know,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex sets context</p>
<p>on what we see and experience.</p>
<p>And the theory of mind task that I just described</p>
<p>very briefly is a pure example of context setting, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the fact,</p>
<p>just the factual elements about the location of the objects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the context.</p>
<p>Someone is looking for something</p>
<p>that someone else put someplace that makes it such</p>
<p>that that object is hidden.</p>
<p>So basically theory of mind is your ability</p>
<p>to put yourself into the mindset of another.</p>
<p>And in order to get activation of these gratitude circuits,</p>
<p>one needs to put themselves into the mindset of another</p>
<p>or to directly receive gratitude.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just take a moment and start to think about</p>
<p>how we are going to build out</p>
<p>the ultimate gratitude practice,</p>
<p>meaning the most effective gratitude practice</p>
<p>for us to do because of all the many positive effects</p>
<p>that an effective gratitude practice can have</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the proper one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that receiving gratitude is powerful,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also very clear that waiting around</p>
<p>to receive that gratitude is an impractical approach.</p>
<p>Now, there are methods that have been developed</p>
<p>by my colleague at Stanford, Kelly McGonigal and others</p>
<p>that actually have developed things for the workplace,</p>
<p>for school, for coworkers,</p>
<p>and students to write out particular worksheets</p>
<p>related to what they&rsquo;re thankful for from others</p>
<p>and exchange them.</p>
<p>And so those are very useful practices.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to take anything away from the important work</p>
<p>that Kelly and others have done.</p>
<p>But in the absence of having other people</p>
<p>to do these practices with,</p>
<p>what we know for sure is that there has to be</p>
<p>a real experience of somebody else&rsquo;s experience</p>
<p>and that the best way to do that is story.</p>
<p>So in thinking about how to build out</p>
<p>an effective gratitude practice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very worthwhile, I believe,</p>
<p>to find someone&rsquo;s narrative that&rsquo;s powerful for you.</p>
<p>In many ways to think about this</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s got to be a story that inspires you</p>
<p>because of the, for lack of a better phrase,</p>
<p>the beauty of the human spirit</p>
<p>or the ability of humans to help other humans.</p>
<p>And I find this remarkable</p>
<p>because what this really means</p>
<p>is that the circuits for gratitude</p>
<p>are such that we can exchange gratitude.</p>
<p>We can actually observe someone else getting help,</p>
<p>someone else giving help.</p>
<p>And that observation of our species</p>
<p>doing that for one another</p>
<p>allows us to experience the feeling of a genuine chemical</p>
<p>and neural circuit activation lift, if you will.</p>
<p>Very, very different than simply writing out the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re thankful for, right?</p>
<p>And so how would you do this?</p>
<p>Well, people digest story in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>People watch movies, people listen to podcasts,</p>
<p>people read books.</p>
<p>There are tremendous number of stories out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that an effective gratitude practice</p>
<p>has to be repeated from time to time.</p>
<p>So what I would not suggest is that we build a protocol</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re constantly foraging</p>
<p>for inspirational stories over and over again.</p>
<p>You know, social media and the internet</p>
<p>are replete with those.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to be a very potent protocol or tool</p>
<p>because the most potent protocol or tool for gratitude</p>
<p>is going to be one that you repeat over and over again.</p>
<p>Rather, the most effective protocol or tool</p>
<p>is going to be either to think into,</p>
<p>and you could write this out if you like,</p>
<p>but think into when somebody was thankful</p>
<p>for something that you did</p>
<p>and really start to think about how you felt</p>
<p>in receiving that gratitude,</p>
<p>or, and or, I should say,</p>
<p>imagining or thinking about deeply</p>
<p>the emotional experience of somebody else receiving help.</p>
<p>Now, what narrative you select</p>
<p>is going to be very dependent on you and your taste.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be very dependent on what resonates with you.</p>
<p>But again, I want to emphasize that</p>
<p>the story that you select does not have to have</p>
<p>any semblance to your own life experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about what happens to move you.</p>
<p>And so the way that one could do this,</p>
<p>and actually I&rsquo;ve started this practice for myself</p>
<p>on the basis of the learnings I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>in the last few weeks around preparing for this episode,</p>
<p>is to find a story that&rsquo;s particularly meaningful for you,</p>
<p>and then to just take some short notes,</p>
<p>bullet point notes about maybe list out, for instance,</p>
<p>on a just a small sheet of paper or in your phone,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your preference,</p>
<p>just list out, for instance, you know,</p>
<p>what the struggle was, what the help was,</p>
<p>and something about how that impacts you emotionally.</p>
<p>This is something just for you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to share it with anybody.</p>
<p>That kind of shorthand list of bullet point notes</p>
<p>serves as your shorthand for getting into this mode</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re calling gratitude,</p>
<p>and actually closely mimics a lot of what was done</p>
<p>in these various studies.</p>
<p>Because even though the studies I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>up until now were really focused on</p>
<p>what we call acute imaging studies,</p>
<p>where someone watched a story or received gratitude</p>
<p>while the experiment was done,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s it, one and done,</p>
<p>there are other studies looking at gratitude</p>
<p>in this context over many weeks, up to six weeks.</p>
<p>And what one observes is that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so-called neuroplasticity of these circuits.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to change in response to experience,</p>
<p>and that these neural circuits start developing</p>
<p>a familiarity with the narrative,</p>
<p>so that, for instance, let&rsquo;s say you sit down</p>
<p>the first time you&rsquo;ve found a story</p>
<p>that you find particularly compelling,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written down a few notes about what that story is,</p>
<p>just to remind you, and then you read those out</p>
<p>and you think into the richness of that experience,</p>
<p>that receiving of gratitude,</p>
<p>or if you prefer, you&rsquo;re doing the protocol</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re thinking about when someone was deeply grateful</p>
<p>or was genuinely grateful to you,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re thinking about that,</p>
<p>the neural circuits become activated more easily</p>
<p>with each subsequent repeat of the practice.</p>
<p>Now, this could be done literally for one minute,</p>
<p>or two minutes, or three minutes.</p>
<p>This is not an extensively long practice.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another beauty of gratitude practices,</p>
<p>is that they have these outsized positive effects</p>
<p>on so many aspects of our physiology,</p>
<p>but these are very short practices.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the kind of thing that you can do</p>
<p>walking to your car,</p>
<p>the kind of thing you can just sit down for a minute</p>
<p>and set a timer and do,</p>
<p>because they are really about changing</p>
<p>your state of mind and body,</p>
<p>and if you have an experience of receiving gratitude</p>
<p>or a story that&rsquo;s very potent for you,</p>
<p>it becomes a sort of shortcut into the gratitude network,</p>
<p>these prosocial networks,</p>
<p>meaning the activation of these circuits</p>
<p>becomes almost instantaneous.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>than a lot of other practices out there.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not aware of any meditation practices,</p>
<p>for instance, that you can do only a few times,</p>
<p>and then within a week or so,</p>
<p>you just have to do them for one minute,</p>
<p>you immediately drop into the kind of optimal state</p>
<p>that that meditation practice is designed to create.</p>
<p>There are some shorter meditation practices</p>
<p>that are very potent and very effective like that,</p>
<p>but gratitude and the circuits associated with it</p>
<p>appear to be especially plastic,</p>
<p>meaning especially prone to being able to be triggered</p>
<p>in the good sense of the word triggered,</p>
<p>just by simply reminding yourself</p>
<p>of this particular narrative.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another very clear and positive effect</p>
<p>of using this narrative or story-based approach</p>
<p>to a gratitude practice,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what story does for our physiology.</p>
<p>Now, earlier in the episode,</p>
<p>I mentioned this really incredible study</p>
<p>in which listening to a story</p>
<p>coordinated the heart rate of different individuals</p>
<p>and literally changed the way that their heart was beating.</p>
<p>The title of this study</p>
<p>is Conscious Processing of Narrative Stimuli</p>
<p>Synchronizes Heart Rate Between Individuals.</p>
<p>The first author is Perez,</p>
<p>again, published in Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal,</p>
<p>excellent journal, and it&rsquo;s a really elegant study.</p>
<p>They looked at instantaneous heart rate.</p>
<p>They use electrocardiogram to do that,</p>
<p>which is simply a way to look at heart beats</p>
<p>with very fine precision.</p>
<p>They also looked at the breathing of subjects</p>
<p>as they listened to these stories.</p>
<p>Some of you may know that breathing and heart rate</p>
<p>are actually linked to one another</p>
<p>in a really interesting way.</p>
<p>The simple way to put it is that when you inhale,</p>
<p>your heart rate speeds up a little bit,</p>
<p>and when you exhale, your heart rate slows down,</p>
<p>and this is because of the movement of the diaphragm</p>
<p>in your thoracic cavity,</p>
<p>and the physicians and medical types</p>
<p>call this respiratory sinus arrhythmia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mechanism there we could get into,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to distract us from the main theme here,</p>
<p>so just remember when you inhale,</p>
<p>your heart rate speeds up,</p>
<p>and when you exhale, your heart rate slows down.</p>
<p>They looked at breathing,</p>
<p>they looked at heart rate in different individuals,</p>
<p>and listening to a story</p>
<p>produced very consistent gaps</p>
<p>between the heart rates of the people who are listening.</p>
<p>Different individuals in the study</p>
<p>who were not located in the same place</p>
<p>when they listened to the story,</p>
<p>listening to the story in different times,</p>
<p>different days entirely,</p>
<p>had very similar heartbeat patterns</p>
<p>listening to this story.</p>
<p>What this means for your gratitude practice</p>
<p>is that having a story that you can return to</p>
<p>over and over again,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not the entire story,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just using the shorthand bullet point</p>
<p>version of your story,</p>
<p>will create a perceptible and real shift</p>
<p>in your heartbeat and in your breathing.</p>
<p>And actually that&rsquo;s been demonstrated over and over now</p>
<p>that an effective gratitude practice</p>
<p>is one that can rapidly shift</p>
<p>not just the activation of these circuits in your brain</p>
<p>for pro-social behaviors,</p>
<p>but also activation of particular circuits in your heart</p>
<p>and in your lungs and the other organs of your body</p>
<p>such that you can get into a reproducible state</p>
<p>of gratitude each time.</p>
<p>So an important component here</p>
<p>is that there be some element of story.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t have to listen to or read</p>
<p>or think about the entire story start to finish</p>
<p>in order to extract these benefits</p>
<p>and that it be the same story over and over.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to shift your physiology</p>
<p>into presumably a more relaxed state</p>
<p>because typically that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with gratitude.</p>
<p>Although activation of these gratitude circuits</p>
<p>has also been shown to create sense of awe or sense of joy.</p>
<p>There are a few studies looking at</p>
<p>and kind of parsing the difference</p>
<p>between gratitude and joy.</p>
<p>I was able to find a few studies about that,</p>
<p>but in general,</p>
<p>the neural circuits that are activated</p>
<p>tend to overlap quite a lot with those</p>
<p>that create a sense of gratitude.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t want to split hairs unnecessarily there.</p>
<p>The key thing is that you want to use the same story,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s your own experience or somebody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and keep coming back to it over and over again.</p>
<p>That makes it a very potent tool</p>
<p>that you can get a tremendous amount of benefit</p>
<p>from with even as short as 60 seconds of practice.</p>
<p>Earlier, I talked about how you can&rsquo;t lie to yourself</p>
<p>and say, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so grateful for this thing that I actually hate.</p>
<p>And in a moment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you about some scientific data</p>
<p>that proves the statement I made is true</p>
<p>and that you can&rsquo;t just lie to yourself</p>
<p>and derive the benefits of a gratitude practice.</p>
<p>The data are also going to point to the fact</p>
<p>that if you are giving gratitude,</p>
<p>not just receiving it, but giving gratitude,</p>
<p>that too has to be genuine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really interesting studies</p>
<p>published in Scientific Reports,</p>
<p>which is a nature research journal.</p>
<p>The title of it is,</p>
<p>Neural Responses to Intention and Benefit Appraisal</p>
<p>are Critical in Distinguishing Gratitude and Joy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a somewhat complicated study,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just going to hit on some of the high points,</p>
<p>but basically what they did</p>
<p>is they use functional magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
<p>So they could look at brain circuitry activation</p>
<p>with very high precision.</p>
<p>And they had people receiving money</p>
<p>in the context of this experiment.</p>
<p>And they had some knowledge as to whether or not</p>
<p>the money that they were receiving</p>
<p>was given to them wholeheartedly or reluctantly.</p>
<p>And there were a number of different variables in the study,</p>
<p>including how much money was given.</p>
<p>So in some cases it was very little,</p>
<p>in other cases it was modest,</p>
<p>in other cases it was a lot more.</p>
<p>And they also varied the extent to which the giver</p>
<p>of the money that they called the benefactor</p>
<p>was doing it wholeheartedly</p>
<p>or seemed to be doing it somewhat reluctantly.</p>
<p>And they looked at whether or not the sense of gratitude</p>
<p>scaled with the amount of money received</p>
<p>and or the intention of the benefactor,</p>
<p>whether or not the person giving the money</p>
<p>was doing it wholeheartedly or reluctantly.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s remarkable is that</p>
<p>while the amount of money given</p>
<p>was a strong component in whether or not</p>
<p>somebody felt that they had received gratitude,</p>
<p>which makes sense,</p>
<p>the amount of money is some metric</p>
<p>of whether or not somebody feels thanked.</p>
<p>The stronger variable, the bigger impact</p>
<p>came from whether or not the person giving the money</p>
<p>was giving it with a wholehearted intention</p>
<p>and not a reluctant intention.</p>
<p>And of course, there was an interaction</p>
<p>where the best circumstance, of course,</p>
<p>is where the person received a lot of money</p>
<p>from somebody who wholeheartedly</p>
<p>wanted to give them a lot of money.</p>
<p>And they did every derivation of this,</p>
<p>but this is important.</p>
<p>This tells us many things</p>
<p>that extend way beyond gratitude practices,</p>
<p>which is that genuine thanks are what count, okay?</p>
<p>We could probably presume that,</p>
<p>but receiving genuine thanks is also a strong variable</p>
<p>in determining whether or not we experience real gratitude</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s empty,</p>
<p>regardless of the size of a gift.</p>
<p>So this constrains our gratitude practices somewhat,</p>
<p>but I think in an interesting and important way,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell yourself that an experience was great</p>
<p>or that I got a lot of money</p>
<p>and therefore it justified it,</p>
<p>even though I think that they gave it to me reluctantly</p>
<p>or my boss hates me, but they gave me a raise.</p>
<p>That stuff stings for all the right reasons</p>
<p>because there are circuits in our brain and body</p>
<p>that are oriented towards these pro-social interactions.</p>
<p>And in some sense, what we are looking for as a species,</p>
<p>what these circuits want, if you will,</p>
<p>is to receive things from people</p>
<p>that are giving them wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>And that tells us that if we are the giver,</p>
<p>that we better be giving wholeheartedly</p>
<p>or we are undermining the sense of gratitude</p>
<p>that someone is going to receive from us.</p>
<p>So we are gradually building up</p>
<p>the ultimate gratitude practice</p>
<p>based on the variety of scientific literature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>And I know that many people are probably interested</p>
<p>in developing a gratitude practice that has long-lasting,</p>
<p>maybe even permanent positive effects</p>
<p>on their neural circuitry.</p>
<p>So with that in mind,</p>
<p>I want to turn our attention to a really interesting study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entitled Effects of Gratitude Meditation</p>
<p>on Neural Network Functional Connectivity</p>
<p>and Brain-Heart Coupling.</p>
<p>And to make a long story short</p>
<p>and a lot simpler than that title,</p>
<p>repeated gratitude practice changes the way</p>
<p>that your brain circuits work.</p>
<p>And it also changes the way in which your heart</p>
<p>and your brain interact.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that your brain controls your heart</p>
<p>because you can be stressed about something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s perceived with your brain,</p>
<p>and then your heart rate will speed up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably also familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that if your heart rate speeds up for some reason</p>
<p>or no reason, you&rsquo;re probably thinking,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s making my heart rate speed up?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the brain and the heart</p>
<p>are reciprocally innervated, as we say.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking to one another in both directions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a two-way highway.</p>
<p>This study looked at changes</p>
<p>in so-called functional connectivity within the brain</p>
<p>and between the brain and the heart</p>
<p>in response to gratitude practices.</p>
<p>And as a control, they used what I think</p>
<p>is very interesting, a resentment intervention.</p>
<p>I think resentment is an apt control</p>
<p>and quite different than gratitude.</p>
<p>To make a long story short,</p>
<p>what they found is that a repeated gratitude practice</p>
<p>could change the resting state functional connectivity</p>
<p>in emotion and motivation-related brain regions.</p>
<p>If I haven&rsquo;t mentioned a strong enough incentive</p>
<p>for doing a regular gratitude practice until now,</p>
<p>this is definitely the one to pay attention to</p>
<p>because what they found was a regular gratitude practice</p>
<p>could shift the functional connectivity of emotion pathways</p>
<p>in ways that made anxiety and fear circuits</p>
<p>less likely to be active</p>
<p>and circuits for feelings of wellbeing,</p>
<p>but also motivation to be much more active.</p>
<p>I find that remarkable and important</p>
<p>because a number of people</p>
<p>struggle with issues of motivation.</p>
<p>A lot of people who are highly motivated</p>
<p>also have issues with anxiety and fear.</p>
<p>And so this study really points to the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a twofer.</p>
<p>If you have a good gratitude practice</p>
<p>and you repeat it regularly,</p>
<p>you reduce the fear anxiety circuits,</p>
<p>you increase the efficacy of the positive emotion</p>
<p>feel-good circuits,</p>
<p>and the circuits associated with motivation and pursuit</p>
<p>are actually enhanced as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very strong incentive</p>
<p>to have a gratitude practice and one that you use regularly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about how regularly in just a moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into too many details of this study,</p>
<p>although we will put a reference to it if you like.</p>
<p>It includes a lot of fMRI data,</p>
<p>imaging data of different brain areas,</p>
<p>many, many tables and examples of matrices</p>
<p>of before and after gratitude, after resentment, et cetera.</p>
<p>You do indeed have circuits in your brain for resentment,</p>
<p>whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>We all do.</p>
<p>And some people just,</p>
<p>those circuits are more robust than others.</p>
<p>But the remarkable thing is one can shift</p>
<p>these circuits in the direction</p>
<p>that I think most people would like,</p>
<p>which is more sense of wellbeing and motivation</p>
<p>and less resentment and fear, literally.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool about this study also</p>
<p>is that the interventions are only five minutes long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible, five minutes long.</p>
<p>And so as we start to build out our ideal gratitude practice,</p>
<p>we know that it has to have certain features.</p>
<p>First of all, it has to be grounded in a story,</p>
<p>probably a story that you&rsquo;ve heard in its entirety</p>
<p>at least once, but then you can have a shorthand version,</p>
<p>the so-called bullet points that I talked about before</p>
<p>that allow you to drop into that story</p>
<p>or the emotional associations with that story.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to listen to the whole story each time.</p>
<p>That story should be one in which you are genuinely</p>
<p>being thanked for something and it made you feel good,</p>
<p>or it could be a story about someone else</p>
<p>genuinely expressing thanks, okay?</p>
<p>Based on the description of the gratitude practices</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Your gratitude practice can be very brief.</p>
<p>I mean, it can be as brief as one minute, 60 seconds</p>
<p>or five minutes, which still seems very brief to me.</p>
<p>Although in these studies, they were getting</p>
<p>these really major effects just from five minutes</p>
<p>of gratitude practice.</p>
<p>Some of these papers involve people doing some focusing</p>
<p>on their breathing and calming themselves</p>
<p>as they go into the gratitude practice,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s within the five minute block.</p>
<p>So if you decide that you&rsquo;re going to do a gratitude practice</p>
<p>that involves first, you know, doing some calming breathing,</p>
<p>exhale, emphasize breathing, for instance,</p>
<p>or physiological size, things I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>on this podcast that can help calm you down</p>
<p>because they have a lot of exhales,</p>
<p>which you now know slows your heart rate down,</p>
<p>and then doing your gratitude practice, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not necessary,</p>
<p>but a lot of these studies use that.</p>
<p>I think once a narrative has been set,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve heard the story and it has meaning for you,</p>
<p>or you have a recollection of a story</p>
<p>where you were genuinely thanked,</p>
<p>then I think just 60 seconds or maybe 120 seconds</p>
<p>should be sufficient.</p>
<p>Then the question becomes how often</p>
<p>to repeat this gratitude practice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not exactly clear from the existing literature.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t point to any one study that says five times a week</p>
<p>or four times a week.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to throw out a number,</p>
<p>which is three times a week.</p>
<p>And then people will ask, well,</p>
<p>when should I do that gratitude practice?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you what I tell most everybody</p>
<p>about most every practice with a few exceptions,</p>
<p>which is the best time of day to do this practice</p>
<p>is when you first wake up in the morning</p>
<p>or before you go to sleep at night or any time of day.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about some of the neural circuitry changes</p>
<p>associated with a regular gratitude practice.</p>
<p>And I should mention that there&rsquo;s an additional</p>
<p>neural circuitry shift that occurs.</p>
<p>It relates to a structure that I mentioned</p>
<p>just briefly earlier, which is the so-called ACC</p>
<p>or anterior cingulate cortex.</p>
<p>This is an area of the brain that has several functions,</p>
<p>but more and more data are pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that the ACC is actually involved in empathy</p>
<p>and is involved in understanding the emotional states</p>
<p>of others in general,</p>
<p>even if it doesn&rsquo;t invoke a sense of empathy.</p>
<p>And there are several studies that point to the fact</p>
<p>that in humans who have a regular gratitude practice,</p>
<p>the ACC becomes more robustly engaged,</p>
<p>even with these very brief gratitude practices.</p>
<p>We actually have a project in our lab.</p>
<p>This is actually done in animal models</p>
<p>with where animals observe other animals</p>
<p>experiencing certain emotional states.</p>
<p>And one of the brain areas that we&rsquo;ve identified</p>
<p>as important for this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a primordial form of empathy</p>
<p>because we really don&rsquo;t know what these mice are thinking.</p>
<p>We work on humans in the case where we work on humans.</p>
<p>Of course, we ask them and they tell us</p>
<p>what they think they&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>With the mice, we ask them,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t tell us much of anything interesting.</p>
<p>Instead, we measure a number of physiological signals.</p>
<p>But the important point is that the ACC,</p>
<p>the anterior cingulate cortex,</p>
<p>seems to be an important hub for the generation</p>
<p>and execution of empathy as it relates to feelings</p>
<p>and empathic behaviors, altruistic behaviors</p>
<p>of animals helping animals and humans helping other humans.</p>
<p>We see this in animal models.</p>
<p>We see this in humans.</p>
<p>So if you want to be a more empathic person,</p>
<p>a gratitude practice is also going to be</p>
<p>very effective for that, it appears,</p>
<p>especially using this narrative type approach</p>
<p>where you are using someone else&rsquo;s narrative</p>
<p>of receiving gratitude as a way to tap</p>
<p>into your own sense of gratitude.</p>
<p>Thus far, we&rsquo;ve mainly talked about the effects</p>
<p>of gratitude on neural circuit activation and changes,</p>
<p>a little bit about some of the changes that are happening</p>
<p>in terms of the body, heart rate and breathing and so forth.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t talked a lot yet about the changes</p>
<p>in health metrics, in things like inflammation</p>
<p>or reductions in inflammation and immunity</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I&rsquo;d like to describe the results</p>
<p>of a really interesting recent study that was published</p>
<p>in the journal Brain Behavior and Immunity.</p>
<p>This was published 2021.</p>
<p>The title of the study is Exploring Neural Mechanisms</p>
<p>of the Health Benefits of Gratitude in Women,</p>
<p>a Randomized Controlled Trial.</p>
<p>The first author is Hazlitt.</p>
<p>And basically what this paper showed was that women</p>
<p>who had a regular gratitude practice of the sort</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about up until now</p>
<p>showed reductions in amygdala activity,</p>
<p>a brain area associated with threat detection,</p>
<p>a intimate part of the fear network in the brain.</p>
<p>So reductions in amygdala activation</p>
<p>and large reductions in the production</p>
<p>of something called TNF-alpha,</p>
<p>tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6, interleukin-6.</p>
<p>Now, if you happen to have listened to the episode</p>
<p>that I did on activating your immune system</p>
<p>and immune function, you heard about TNF-alpha and IL-6.</p>
<p>TNF-alpha and IL-6 are inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>These are chemicals that exist in your body</p>
<p>and that are released from cells when there is damage</p>
<p>or kind of a systemic stress, when your system is in duress.</p>
<p>And in the short term, they can be beneficial.</p>
<p>They can call in signals for wound healing</p>
<p>and repair of cells, et cetera.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t want TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels to be too high.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want those levels to be up for too long.</p>
<p>And so this study is really nice</p>
<p>because they showed significant effects</p>
<p>in reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6</p>
<p>in response to a gratitude practice.</p>
<p>And because they also observed reductions</p>
<p>in amygdala activation,</p>
<p>this area associated with threat detection and fear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely, and I should emphasize likely</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know, that the direction of the effect</p>
<p>is that there are neural circuit changes</p>
<p>which in turn shift the degree</p>
<p>to which these inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>are released in the body.</p>
<p>Although for all I know, it could be the other way too.</p>
<p>It could be that having a gratitude practice</p>
<p>shifts something about heart rate and breathing,</p>
<p>which in turn shifts or lowers the amount</p>
<p>of TNF-alpha and IL-6,</p>
<p>and that in turn reduces activation of the amygdala.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know the direction of the effect,</p>
<p>excuse me, but if I had to speculate,</p>
<p>I would speculate that it was a shift in neural circuitry</p>
<p>that led to a change in the circuits of the body.</p>
<p>And another interesting aspect of this study</p>
<p>is that the reductions in amygdala activation</p>
<p>and the reductions in TNF-alpha and IL-6 were very rapid.</p>
<p>They occurred almost immediately</p>
<p>after the gratitude practice was completed.</p>
<p>And even though that study was performed exclusively</p>
<p>on female subjects, based on the biology</p>
<p>and circuitry of the amygdala</p>
<p>and the biology of TNF-alpha and IL-6</p>
<p>performing this inflammatory role in both men and women,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason why the results of that study</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t pertain to both men and women.</p>
<p>So what about the chemistry associated with gratitude?</p>
<p>Are there certain chemicals in our brain</p>
<p>or that we could enhance in our brain</p>
<p>that would enhance our gratitude practice?</p>
<p>Indeed, there are.</p>
<p>And earlier I mentioned the chemical,</p>
<p>the neuromodulator serotonin,</p>
<p>as having a powerful influence</p>
<p>on the activation of neural circuits</p>
<p>associated with pro-social behaviors and gratitude</p>
<p>and other sort of feel-good behaviors.</p>
<p>To make a long story short,</p>
<p>neuromodulators like dopamine and epinephrine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine tend to place us</p>
<p>into a state of exteroception,</p>
<p>meaning a state of observing things</p>
<p>and focusing on things outside the immediate reach</p>
<p>of our body and confines of our skin.</p>
<p>They tend to put us in pursuit</p>
<p>or in thinking about things out in the future</p>
<p>or out away from our physical body.</p>
<p>Whereas the neuromodulator serotonin</p>
<p>and some of the associated pathways like oxytocin</p>
<p>and other neurochemicals tend to,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize, tend to be associated</p>
<p>with states that are about contentment</p>
<p>with what we have within the confines of our body</p>
<p>and our immediate experience.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not so much about pursuit,</p>
<p>but about gratitude and about appreciation</p>
<p>for what we already have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t therefore point out</p>
<p>that if one were to shift their chemistry</p>
<p>toward having higher levels of serotonin,</p>
<p>you would, by all logic,</p>
<p>experience heightened levels of gratitude.</p>
<p>And indeed, some people do this.</p>
<p>They will take compounds that increase serotonin.</p>
<p>There are a number of compounds out there.</p>
<p>As you know, I&rsquo;m certainly not suggesting people do that.</p>
<p>A couple of the supplement-based</p>
<p>legal over-the-counter approaches to this</p>
<p>are things like 5-HTP, which is a precursor to serotonin.</p>
<p>Some people will take 5-HTP to try and enhance their sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of doing that personally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this in the sleep episodes,</p>
<p>but the state that we call sleep has a very complex</p>
<p>and important architecture as it relates to neurochemicals.</p>
<p>And by taking serotonin by supplement</p>
<p>or by stimulating serotonin release by supplement</p>
<p>with 5-HTP or with tryptophan,</p>
<p>which is an amino acid precursor to serotonin,</p>
<p>one can run into the problem</p>
<p>of disrupting the normal architecture</p>
<p>of sleep cycles throughout the night.</p>
<p>I experienced that as if I&rsquo;ve taken 5-HTP or tryptophan,</p>
<p>I fall asleep very deeply,</p>
<p>but then I wake up three hours later</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t fall asleep at all.</p>
<p>And actually it sometimes even messes up my sleep</p>
<p>the subsequent night.</p>
<p>Some people are not so sensitive to 5-HTP and tryptophan</p>
<p>and they actually really like it.</p>
<p>So again, you have to talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>decide what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for your health, not me.</p>
<p>And you have to determine what works for you.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s slightly individual,</p>
<p>but one could imagine enhancing their amount of serotonin</p>
<p>in their brain and body by taking 5-HTP or tryptophan</p>
<p>before gratitude practice.</p>
<p>That seems a little bit extreme</p>
<p>given that the gratitude practice</p>
<p>is only about a minute to five minutes long</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But there may be instances</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re really trying to amplify the circuitry</p>
<p>in the brain and body that are associated with gratitude.</p>
<p>And therefore that might be something</p>
<p>that you want to explore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new compound that&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>a legal over-the-counter compound.</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s legal in the United States,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about overseas.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a compound called KANA, K-A-N-N-A.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting compound.</p>
<p>It goes by another name as well, which is,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to mispronounce this and I apologize.</p>
<p>This is Celesium Tortosium.</p>
<p>Please see our timestamps</p>
<p>if you want to see the spelling of that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll just call it KANA by its other name for short.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an herb that is traditionally chewed</p>
<p>prior to stressing endeavors</p>
<p>is how it&rsquo;s described on an examine.com.</p>
<p>But I looked at some of the studies on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>It very likely increases the amount of serotonin</p>
<p>in the body and pretty potently.</p>
<p>It is generally taken in dosages</p>
<p>of anywhere from 25 to 50 milligrams.</p>
<p>And it creates a kind of a pro-social gratitude enhancing,</p>
<p>or I should say gratitude circuitry,</p>
<p>pro-social neural circuitry enhancing effect</p>
<p>because of the ways that it interacts</p>
<p>with the serotonergic pathways of the brain.</p>
<p>So it also has another name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes called Zembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not suggesting that people run out</p>
<p>and take this stuff,</p>
<p>but there is an emerging practice</p>
<p>of people using Zembrin, Celesium Tortosium,</p>
<p>also called KANA, K-A-N-N-A,</p>
<p>in order to enhance the states that are about comfort</p>
<p>and pleasure with what one has</p>
<p>in their immediate sphere of experience.</p>
<p>And so one could imagine if it&rsquo;s safe for you</p>
<p>and right for you and legal where you live</p>
<p>in enhancing serotonin by taking KANA</p>
<p>and then doing your gratitude practice.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the logic behind that?</p>
<p>Well, oftentimes we hear about supplements and pharmacology</p>
<p>for quote-unquote increasing plasticity</p>
<p>or opening plasticity.</p>
<p>If I had a dollar for every time someone said,</p>
<p>I hear that such and such opens plasticity.</p>
<p>Well, indeed there are molecules associated</p>
<p>with the thing that we call neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>but neuroplasticity is not an event, it&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<p>Meaning it has many, many steps.</p>
<p>It occurs during wakefulness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s consolidated during sleep and so forth.</p>
<p>Taking a substance that increases a neurochemical</p>
<p>in your brain will likely,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s the right substance</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the right practice,</p>
<p>will likely enhance the amplitude</p>
<p>or the intensity of that practice</p>
<p>and make it a more potent form of inducing neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Meaning it will create longer lasting</p>
<p>or more robust brain changes</p>
<p>than if one hadn&rsquo;t increased their chemistry</p>
<p>in this way, this way of taking something.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t get to the very same place without it</p>
<p>by simply doing a slightly longer gratitude practice</p>
<p>or putting a little bit more mental effort into it.</p>
<p>That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>really resides in not just one approach,</p>
<p>not just neurochemistry and taking substances</p>
<p>to increase neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>not just behavioral practices</p>
<p>to try and increase neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>not just brain machine interfaces</p>
<p>or devices to increase neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>but rather the convergence of multiple tools.</p>
<p>So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission,</p>
<p>as we say in the brain, using something like KANA</p>
<p>combined with a gratitude practice</p>
<p>in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>This will probably also be combined</p>
<p>with some sort of non-invasive device</p>
<p>to stimulate the prefrontal cortex at the same time.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do that recreationally.</p>
<p>Those devices are for clinical use only currently.</p>
<p>But I think you start to get the idea.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are a little bit more exploratory</p>
<p>and you want to go and do some reading on this,</p>
<p>I thought you might find KANA interesting.</p>
<p>I certainly did.</p>
<p>There are a number of studies that will pop up on PubMed.</p>
<p>I recommend using examine.com as your jumping off point.</p>
<p>There are some decent studies that they describe</p>
<p>in their so-called human effect matrix.</p>
<p>So those are studies done on humans.</p>
<p>And the main effects that have been documented</p>
<p>in the scientific literature are minor,</p>
<p>but significant increases in cognition,</p>
<p>executive function.</p>
<p>Executive function is something that&rsquo;s also associated</p>
<p>with prefrontal cortex and reductions in anxiety.</p>
<p>And that seems to be a common theme</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re seeing again and again.</p>
<p>You saw this in the study,</p>
<p>the trial where we saw reductions in TNF-alpha</p>
<p>and reductions in amygdala activation,</p>
<p>which would ostensibly lead to reductions in anxiety.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing increases in activity in brain networks</p>
<p>that are associated with feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>So again, back to that kind of push-pull</p>
<p>of defensive anxiety and fear-like circuitry in the brain</p>
<p>being antagonistic, as we say,</p>
<p>to the circuits that are associated with pro-social,</p>
<p>feeling good, receiving good feelings,</p>
<p>type circuitry and events in life.</p>
<p>So as you now know, there is a lot of science</p>
<p>about how gratitude can positively impact neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain, anti-inflammatory markers in the body,</p>
<p>brain-heart breathing coordination, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just highlight the key elements</p>
<p>of the most effective, at least to my knowledge,</p>
<p>gratitude practice.</p>
<p>And when I say the most effective,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m gleaning from the scientific studies</p>
<p>I was able to find and combining the various findings</p>
<p>of those studies into what I think is a very practical</p>
<p>and what should certainly be a very effective</p>
<p>gratitude practice for all the positive effects</p>
<p>that we described.</p>
<p>First of all, that gratitude practice has to be grounded</p>
<p>in a narrative, meaning a story.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to recite or hear that story</p>
<p>every single time you do the gratitude practice,</p>
<p>but you have to know what that story was</p>
<p>and what the gratitude practice references back to.</p>
<p>Second of all, that story can be one of you</p>
<p>receiving genuine thanks.</p>
<p>And the key elements there are that you are the one</p>
<p>receiving the thanks, the gratitude,</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s being given to you genuinely, wholeheartedly,</p>
<p>or it can be a story of you observing someone else</p>
<p>receiving thanks or expressing thanks.</p>
<p>And that has to be a genuine interaction as well,</p>
<p>both between the giver and the receiver.</p>
<p>So those are the first three elements.</p>
<p>What I recommend would be after you&rsquo;ve established</p>
<p>the story that you want to use for your gratitude practice,</p>
<p>that you write down three or four simple bullet points</p>
<p>that can serve as salient reminders of that story for you.</p>
<p>It will serve as kind of a cue for that story</p>
<p>without having to listen to or talk out the entire story.</p>
<p>I would recommend writing down something about the state</p>
<p>that you or the other person were in</p>
<p>before they received the gratitude,</p>
<p>the state that you were in or that the person was in</p>
<p>after they received the gratitude,</p>
<p>and any other elements that lend some sort of emotional</p>
<p>weight or tone to the story.</p>
<p>This could be three pages of text if you like,</p>
<p>or it could just be a couple of bullet points.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it really matters.</p>
<p>The important thing is that it&rsquo;s embedded in your memory</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s really associated with this genuine exchange</p>
<p>of thanks and the receival of thanks.</p>
<p>I think those are the key elements.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>The entire practice involves reading off these bullet points</p>
<p>as a cue to your nervous system of the sense of gratitude.</p>
<p>And then for about one minute,</p>
<p>which is a trivial amount of time</p>
<p>if you really think about it, or maybe two minutes,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re really ambitious, up to five minutes</p>
<p>of just really feeling into that genuine experience</p>
<p>of having received gratitude</p>
<p>or observed someone else receiving gratitude.</p>
<p>And then in terms of frequency,</p>
<p>I think a good rule of thumb would be to do that</p>
<p>about three times a week.</p>
<p>And the time of day doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see why there would be</p>
<p>any so-called circadian effects of this.</p>
<p>I know some people like to do a gratitude practice</p>
<p>before they go to sleep at night.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any problem with doing this</p>
<p>before you go to sleep at night.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t see any problem with you doing this</p>
<p>on your lunch break or mid morning</p>
<p>or first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see any logic for placing it</p>
<p>any one time of day and not another.</p>
<p>So I think the most important thing is that you do it</p>
<p>at least three times a week.</p>
<p>And as mentioned before, it&rsquo;s very, very brief.</p>
<p>So there are very few barriers to entry for doing this.</p>
<p>So if we just take a step back from this protocol</p>
<p>and compare it to what&rsquo;s typically out there</p>
<p>in the literature, which is, you know,</p>
<p>make a list of all the things you&rsquo;re thankful for,</p>
<p>recite in your mind all the things you&rsquo;re thankful for,</p>
<p>count your blessings.</p>
<p>So I think everybody should be counting their blessings</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always something to be thankful for.</p>
<p>But in terms of a scientifically grounded gratitude practice</p>
<p>that is also scientifically demonstrated</p>
<p>to shift your physiology at the level of your immune system</p>
<p>and your neural circuitry, reducing anxiety,</p>
<p>increasing motivation, all these wonderful things</p>
<p>that so many of us are chasing all the time as goals.</p>
<p>I think a gratitude practice reveals itself</p>
<p>to be an immensely powerful tool</p>
<p>for any and all of us to use.</p>
<p>And that should come as no surprise</p>
<p>because these pro-social circuits,</p>
<p>these circuits for gratitude are not a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>Discussions about gratitude date back hundreds,</p>
<p>if not thousands of years.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve done today is to take the modern science</p>
<p>right up until 2021 and to really distill from that,</p>
<p>the neuroimaging data, the neurochemistry,</p>
<p>the various aspects of brain-body connectivity,</p>
<p>look at the protocols, take various subject groups.</p>
<p>Some were done in women, some were done</p>
<p>in between two individuals,</p>
<p>some were done with brain imaging,</p>
<p>all the various changes on a theme</p>
<p>that allow us to point to a simple</p>
<p>but very effective protocol</p>
<p>that certainly we could all use around Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>But Thanksgiving is just but one day</p>
<p>throughout the entire year, of course.</p>
<p>I personally have been using a gratitude protocol</p>
<p>for the last several years,</p>
<p>but that protocol was based on my ignorance really</p>
<p>about the scientific literature</p>
<p>and was mainly based on what I&rsquo;d heard out there</p>
<p>on the internet, which is that I should list out</p>
<p>or think about or verbally recite</p>
<p>the things that I&rsquo;m grateful for.</p>
<p>The sort of protocol that we arrived at today</p>
<p>based on the scientific literature</p>
<p>is distinctly different from that.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, I&rsquo;ve started to script out</p>
<p>a protocol identical to the one I just described.</p>
<p>And I intend to use that going forward.</p>
