    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Peter Atiyah,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Atiyah is a medical doctor</p>
<p>who did his training at Stanford School of Medicine,</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,</p>
<p>and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>He is a world expert in all things related to healthspan,</p>
<p>vitality, and longevity.</p>
<p>In this episode, we focused on many topics,</p>
<p>focusing mainly, however,</p>
<p>on healthspan and longevity and mental health.</p>
<p>Healthspan and longevity, of course,</p>
<p>relate to how long one lives,</p>
<p>and Dr. Atiyah goes systematically</p>
<p>through the seven major causes of death worldwide,</p>
<p>beginning with cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>and cerebrovascular disease,</p>
<p>also cancer, also accident-related deaths,</p>
<p>dementia, deaths of despair,</p>
<p>and in every case, explains the three or four major levers</p>
<p>that one can employ in order to offset,</p>
<p>that is to prevent those major causes of death.</p>
<p>What follows is an incredibly informative</p>
<p>and actionable set of tools for anyone,</p>
<p>male, female, young, or old.</p>
<p>He explains the behavioral, nutritional,</p>
<p>supplementation-based, and prescription drug-based approaches</p>
<p>that one can use in order to extend healthspan</p>
<p>and longevity.</p>
<p>Dr. Atiyah explains the key tests and markers</p>
<p>that we should all pay attention to</p>
<p>if our goal is to extend our healthspan</p>
<p>and how to do so while maximizing our vitality.</p>
<p>This is something that not a lot of people think about</p>
<p>when they think about healthspan and longevity,</p>
<p>but as Dr. Atiyah illustrates for us,</p>
<p>emotional health has everything to do</p>
<p>with our physical health and vice versa,</p>
<p>and he shares quite openly about his own experiences</p>
<p>in pursuing ways to improve emotional health</p>
<p>and thereby healthspan, lifespan, and vitality.</p>
<p>Dr. Atiyah is quite open about his own experiences,</p>
<p>exploring different practices to improve emotional health</p>
<p>as ways not just to improve healthspan, longevity,</p>
<p>and vitality, but of course,</p>
<p>also to derive the most meaning and satisfaction from life.</p>
<p>Throughout today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we also discussed Dr. Atiyah&rsquo;s newly released book,</p>
<p>which is entitled,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Outlive, the Science and Art of Longevity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a phenomenal book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read it cover to cover now three times.</p>
<p>I have extensive notes written throughout,</p>
<p>and the book of course focuses on longevity and healthspan,</p>
<p>and also has an extensive section on emotional health.</p>
<p>It gets quite detailed into Dr. Atiyah&rsquo;s personal experiences</p>
<p>with emotional health and tools to improve emotional health</p>
<p>that are very actionable for anybody to use.</p>
<p>I think the best way for me to summarize my feelings</p>
<p>about the book would simply be to read the back jacket quote</p>
<p>which I provided.</p>
<p>So I read, quote,</p>
<p>Finally, there is a modern, thorough, clear,</p>
<p>and actionable manual for how to maximize our immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health.</p>
<p>Firmly grounded in data and real life conditions,</p>
<p>this is the most accurate</p>
<p>and comprehensive health guide published to date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Outlive&rsquo; is not just informative, it is important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed, &ldquo;&lsquo;Outlive&rsquo; is an important book,</p>
<p>as is the discussion that Dr. Atiyah</p>
<p>so graciously provided us in today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Outlive&rsquo; is released on March 28th, 2023,</p>
<p>and is available for pre-order prior to that date.</p>
<p>You can find a link to where it&rsquo;s sold</p>
<p>in the show note captions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers</p>
<p>with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve talked about before on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>there is a critical relationship</p>
<p>between sleep and body temperature.</p>
<p>That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep,</p>
<p>your body temperature needs to drop</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>And in order to wake up in the morning and feel alert,</p>
<p>your body temperature needs to increase</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>The problem with most people&rsquo;s sleeping environment</p>
<p>is that even if you make the room cool,</p>
<p>the actual environment that you sleep on,</p>
<p>that is your mattress and underneath your covers,</p>
<p>is hard to regulate in terms of temperature.</p>
<p>With Eight Sleep, regulating the temperature</p>
<p>of that sleeping environment becomes incredibly easy.</p>
<p>In fact, you can change the temperature</p>
<p>of that environment across the night,</p>
<p>making it a little bit cool at the beginning of the night,</p>
<p>even cooler still a few hours into your sleep,</p>
<p>which really helps getting into very deep sleep,</p>
<p>and then warming it as you approach morning</p>
<p>so that you wake up feeling most alert.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>for over a year now,</p>
<p>and it has completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Eight Sleep,</p>
<p>you can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to save up to $150 off their Pod 3 cover.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,</p>
<p>select countries in the EU, and Australia.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s eightsleep.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium,</p>
<p>and potassium, and no sugar.</p>
<p>The electrolytes, salt, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>are critical for the function of all cells,</p>
<p>in particular neurons or nerve cells.</p>
<p>And of course, proper hydration is critical</p>
<p>for mental functioning and physical performance.</p>
<p>To ensure that I stay hydrated,</p>
<p>I consume one packet of Element</p>
<p>in approximately 20 to 30 ounces of water every morning</p>
<p>when I first wake up.</p>
<p>And I will also consume one Element packet</p>
<p>in about the same amount of water when I exercise</p>
<p>or when I&rsquo;m doing any kind of mental work,</p>
<p>you know, preparing for a podcast,</p>
<p>writing grants, working on papers, and so forth.</p>
<p>I find that allows me to maintain my focus</p>
<p>and physical performance at levels</p>
<p>that I just simply can&rsquo;t otherwise.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.</p>
<p>HVMN Ketone IQ is a supplement that increases blood ketones.</p>
<p>I want to be clear</p>
<p>that I am not following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Most people fall into this category.</p>
<p>They are not following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>They are omnivores and they do eat carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So their standard fuel source for the brain and body</p>
<p>is not ketones.</p>
<p>However, I found that by taking ketone IQ,</p>
<p>which we know increases blood ketones,</p>
<p>I can achieve much better focus for longer periods of time</p>
<p>for any kind of cognitive work</p>
<p>and much greater energy levels for exercise,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;m going into that exercise fasted</p>
<p>and find myself a little bit hungry</p>
<p>when I start that exercise.</p>
<p>And this is no surprise.</p>
<p>We know that ketones are the brain&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and body&rsquo;s preferred fuel source,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>So in other words, I and many other people</p>
<p>are now starting to leverage endogenous ketones</p>
<p>as a fuel source for the brain and body,</p>
<p>and yet we are not following a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>And of course, if you are following a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>ketone IQ will further allow you</p>
<p>to increase your blood ketones</p>
<p>as a source of brain and body fuel.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try ketone IQ,</p>
<p>you can go to hvmn.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to save 20% off your order.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s hvmn.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>To find the supplements we discuss</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that the library</p>
<p>of those supplements is constantly expanding.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Peter Atiyah.</p>
<p>Dr. Atiyah, Peter, welcome back.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Good to be back and sounding better this time.</p>
<p>Looking forward to talking about a number</p>
<p>of important topics with you that you cover in your book.</p>
<p>Maybe we could start off by trying to set the frame</p>
<p>for what people should be thinking about</p>
<p>in terms of vitality and especially longevity.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think you have to be mindful</p>
<p>of how you define these terms.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna suggest that the way I define them</p>
<p>is the only way or necessarily the best way,</p>
<p>but I think from a clinical perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way that makes the most sense to me,</p>
<p>having thought about this for the better part of a decade.</p>
<p>So it involves some bifurcation</p>
<p>between lifespan and healthspan.</p>
<p>Lifespan is very easy for people to understand.</p>
<p>It is binary.</p>
<p>You are alive or you are not alive.</p>
<p>And clearly part of longevity is about how long you live.</p>
<p>Now, I think for a lot of people,</p>
<p>that tends to be where the discussion ends.</p>
<p>That tends to be the focus of it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like, you know,</p>
<p>longevity somehow implies living for 100 years,</p>
<p>120 years, something like to that extent.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about maximum lifespan.</p>
<p>Even in laboratory experiments with mice,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of one of the metrics that&rsquo;s discussed</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s maximal lifespan of the animals.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an equally, if not slightly,</p>
<p>I think potentially more important part of longevity,</p>
<p>which is healthspan.</p>
<p>And healthspan is squishier,</p>
<p>and I think it requires some definition.</p>
<p>Now, the medical definition of healthspan</p>
<p>is the period of time by which you are free</p>
<p>from disability and disease.</p>
<p>I find that to be a not particularly helpful definition.</p>
<p>Because by that definition,</p>
<p>you and I have the same healthspan today</p>
<p>that we did 30 years ago.</p>
<p>But I know you pretty well, you know me pretty well.</p>
<p>30 years ago, we were twice the men we are now</p>
<p>based on what we believe our healthspan is, right?</p>
<p>In terms of our cognitive function,</p>
<p>our physical performance and things like that.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;ve clearly experienced the deterioration</p>
<p>of my physical function, as I&rsquo;m sure you have,</p>
<p>going back to when you were a teenager,</p>
<p>late teenager, early 20s.</p>
<p>And I think that needs to be captured somehow</p>
<p>in healthspan.</p>
<p>So, the way I think of healthspan</p>
<p>really is along these three dimensions,</p>
<p>physical, cognitive and emotional.</p>
<p>Again, not necessarily suggesting</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the only way to do it,</p>
<p>but I do think that clinically it makes the most sense.</p>
<p>And so therefore, anything that really becomes a question</p>
<p>of longevity has to address all of these issues.</p>
<p>Lifespan, physical health beyond that</p>
<p>of just straight up disability and disease,</p>
<p>cognitive health, independent of</p>
<p>and separate from pathology such as dementia</p>
<p>and emotional health, which of course is by far</p>
<p>the most complicated of all of these</p>
<p>because we have no biomarkers for it.</p>
<p>We have no, you know, it&rsquo;s not like you can get a scan</p>
<p>on somebody and determine the state of this,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, it&rsquo;s important, right?</p>
<p>And it dramatically factors into quality of life.</p>
<p>So, with all of that in mind,</p>
<p>what are the major exit points</p>
<p>for people along the lifespan route?</p>
<p>So, start with the binary one, dead or alive, right?</p>
<p>I think most everyone who&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>would like to be alive rather than dead.</p>
<p>So, what are the typical ways that people exit</p>
<p>from alive to dead and how can people stay</p>
<p>on the freeway of life, so to speak?</p>
<p>So, this is again, a great analysis.</p>
<p>We internally in our practice</p>
<p>call this the death bar analysis</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a surprisingly trivial analysis</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just surprised the death bars</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t plastered front and center on every doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>So, if you simply just look at actuarial data,</p>
<p>which are readily available through the CDC</p>
<p>and do a little bit of data, you know,</p>
<p>manipulation and analysis,</p>
<p>you can pretty quickly realize</p>
<p>what the horsemen of death are</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s largely speaking</p>
<p>kind of four horsemen of death.</p>
<p>The first and most consequential in terms of the numbers</p>
<p>is the diseases of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>being the lion&rsquo;s share of that,</p>
<p>but also cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<p>So, anything that has to do with atherosclerosis</p>
<p>rises to the top.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s true in the United States,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s even more true outside of the United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even more true globally.</p>
<p>So, in other words, when you look at the relative difference</p>
<p>between the number one cause of death in the U.S.</p>
<p>and number two, which is cancer,</p>
<p>the gap is actually smaller in the U.S. than globally.</p>
<p>Globally, it&rsquo;s enormous.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about 18 to 19 million people a year</p>
<p>that are dying of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>in the world,</p>
<p>whereas number two is cancer at about 11 million.</p>
<p>How does the number change</p>
<p>when you include cerebrovascular disease?</p>
<p>Yeah, it adds a bit to it.</p>
<p>Cerebrovascular disease has, largely speaking,</p>
<p>you can die sort of through embolic events,</p>
<p>which are the majority of them.</p>
<p>Can you explain for people what embolic events are?</p>
<p>Yeah, so taking a step back,</p>
<p>what does the brain need more than anything?</p>
<p>It needs blood flow.</p>
<p>Anything that interrupts blood flow to the brain</p>
<p>that results in ischemia is devastating,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s devastating in a more readily apparent fashion</p>
<p>than virtually any other organ.</p>
<p>So, one way that that can happen</p>
<p>is if a clot or disruption of blood flow</p>
<p>occurs through obstruction of blood flow.</p>
<p>So, that can occur through a clot.</p>
<p>So, for example, if a person has atrial fibrillation</p>
<p>and a blood clot gets festering in the right atrium</p>
<p>and they happen to have a hole</p>
<p>between the atria of their hearts,</p>
<p>called a patent foramen ovale,</p>
<p>and a clot goes from right to left,</p>
<p>it can make its way up into the arterial circulation</p>
<p>and happen that way, where you include blood flow.</p>
<p>The much more common way it occurs</p>
<p>is the same way it occurs in the heart,</p>
<p>which is you have plaque buildup,</p>
<p>and that plaque becomes unstable, that plaque ruptures,</p>
<p>and the rupture of that plaque</p>
<p>results in an immediate attempt by the body</p>
<p>to fix the problem.</p>
<p>But in doing so, it walls off the artery,</p>
<p>meaning the blood flow distal to that point,</p>
<p>so that now blood is acutely being robbed of that.</p>
<p>However, there are other ways</p>
<p>that people can have this problem.</p>
<p>So you have the whole hemorrhagic side of this.</p>
<p>So you can have blood vessels,</p>
<p>small blood vessels in the brain</p>
<p>that will rupture as a result of high blood pressure,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>So hypertension factors into both sides of this equation,</p>
<p>both in the heart and in the brain.</p>
<p>The majority of these are embolic, however.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t quote me on this exactly,</p>
<p>but call it four or five to one strokes</p>
<p>result from an embolic phenomenon</p>
<p>as opposed to a hemorrhagic phenomenon,</p>
<p>a bleeding phenomenon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to take us too far off on a tangent,</p>
<p>but as long as we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>talking about bleeds versus clots,</p>
<p>what are some of the major risks for bleeds?</p>
<p>I mean, I know some people out there</p>
<p>have genetic predispositions for being bleeders,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re sometimes called, or clotters.</p>
<p>So things like factor V Leiden mutations,</p>
<p>which can be exacerbated in women, for instance,</p>
<p>by taking certain oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>I mean, and there&rsquo;s a huge list.</p>
<p>If people are interested in them, they can look up,</p>
<p>what are the factors controlling bleeding</p>
<p>and predispose people to being clotter.</p>
<p>But for the typical person out there who feels healthy,</p>
<p>but might do well to know whether or not</p>
<p>they are predisposed to be a bleeder or a clotter,</p>
<p>what sorts of things rise to the top of that list</p>
<p>and that people might want to check into?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there might be sort of two different things</p>
<p>going on in that question.</p>
<p>But I think if your question is,</p>
<p>when we look at the subset of people</p>
<p>who are at highest risk for hemorrhagic strokes,</p>
<p>the far more germane question</p>
<p>is not underlying coagulopathy.</p>
<p>The far more germane question</p>
<p>really comes down to blood pressure.</p>
<p>Blood pressure would be the first, second,</p>
<p>and third driver of that.</p>
<p>So hypertension is hands down the leading driver</p>
<p>of hemorrhagic stroke phenomenon.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ll just briefly interrupt and ask,</p>
<p>since sometimes your recommendations deviate</p>
<p>from the standards that one would find online</p>
<p>or in the typical doctor&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>at what point do you get concerned?</p>
<p>Well, I actually find myself quite in line</p>
<p>with the most recent available data on blood pressure.</p>
<p>And this has been, obviously,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a topic that&rsquo;s of high concern</p>
<p>to any doctor who&rsquo;s taking care of patients</p>
<p>who even pays a fraction of attention</p>
<p>to the available literature,</p>
<p>which is that basically</p>
<p>with each subsequent blood pressure trial,</p>
<p>the data are becoming clearer and clearer</p>
<p>that the more aggressively you manage blood pressure</p>
<p>to be within the 120 over 80 range, the better.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s a recent study</p>
<p>that even looked at going</p>
<p>from what used to be considered acceptable,</p>
<p>which was 130 to 135 over 80 to 85.</p>
<p>We used to basically say,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of the first level of hypertension.</p>
<p>And we would say, well,</p>
<p>do you really need to be better than that?</p>
<p>And the answer turns out to be, yes, you do.</p>
<p>If you want to reduce heart attacks and strokes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to be 120 over 80 than 135 over 85.</p>
<p>Now, this is a whole other rabbit hole</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t need to go down,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a total obsession of mine,</p>
<p>which is how do you measure a person&rsquo;s blood pressure?</p>
<p>I think this is potentially,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to give it thought,</p>
<p>but honestly, I could say top three</p>
<p>under-diagnosed fixable problems</p>
<p>in the United States today, and probably globally.</p>
<p>In other words, there are too many people walking around</p>
<p>with high blood pressure who don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>And I think part of the problem is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that is mostly done in the doctor&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>and the readings that you get in the doctor&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>can be often misleading.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of this phenomenon of white coat hypertension.</p>
<p>So you go to the doctor,</p>
<p>your blood pressure is virtually never measured correctly</p>
<p>in the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>That cuff they put on and that squeeze bulb,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not accurate.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you look at the rigor</p>
<p>with which you need to measure a person&rsquo;s blood pressure,</p>
<p>the right way to do it</p>
<p>is the person has to be sitting like this</p>
<p>for five minutes doing nothing.</p>
<p>Okay, folks, so when you go to the doctors now,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t let them take your blood pressure</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;ve been sitting for five minutes.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t include in the waiting room,</p>
<p>because if you walk from the waiting room.</p>
<p>Right, because then you get up and walk over, right.</p>
<p>Okay, so make them stand there.</p>
<p>Right, so you wanna be sitting there like this.</p>
<p>A manual cuff is better than an automated cuff,</p>
<p>but not enough people use manual blood pressure.</p>
<p>So a manual blood pressure means they put a cuff on you</p>
<p>and they actually put a stethoscope on the brachial artery</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re using the human ear to listen,</p>
<p>which believe it or not,</p>
<p>you would think a machine is better, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The machine can be misled by different sounds.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t wanna suggest that automated cuffs are useless.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But when an automated cuff gives you an answer</p>
<p>that is potentially suspect,</p>
<p>always back it up with a manual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty relentless about checking my blood pressure.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll do side to side manual</p>
<p>versus automated every day.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s easily a 10 to 15 point difference between them.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a silly question,</p>
<p>but can people check their own blood pressure?</p>
<p>Meaning manually?</p>
<p>Yeah, just could I get a cuff and a bulb</p>
<p>and learn how to do it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I can do it, but honestly,</p>
<p>I usually have my wife do it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a nurse, but it&rsquo;s not rocket science</p>
<p>to check blood pressure.</p>
<p>I guarantee you there&rsquo;s a great video on YouTube</p>
<p>that explains the physiology of it.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re willing to splurge</p>
<p>on a good enough stethoscope and cuff,</p>
<p>like the cuff I have is really easy to use.</p>
<p>Once you put it on, it&rsquo;s in a single thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m squeezing the bulb and looking at the pressure gauge</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;ve got the stethoscope on my artery.</p>
<p>I mean, given the importance of blood pressure</p>
<p>and this arteriosclerosis being at the top of the list</p>
<p>of risks for dying,</p>
<p>it seems to me it might be worth the expense.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a typical range of costs for the quality?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not inordinate.</p>
<p>I feel like my blood pressure cuff is 40 bucks.</p>
<p>And the stethoscope is a couple hundred bucks</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting a good one.</p>
<p>And, you know, a good automated cuff,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, I have no affiliation with any of these companies.</p>
<p>I use two automated cuffs.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s called Withings.</p>
<p>The other one&rsquo;s made by a company called Omron, O-M-R-O-N.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re both decent, but again, they tend to run high.</p>
<p>And I have yet to find a credible explanation</p>
<p>from cardiologists as to why.</p>
<p>Everybody acknowledges that the manual one,</p>
<p>when done correctly, is the answer.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve heard wonky answers</p>
<p>about why automated ones are sometimes incorrect.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s just made me realize</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not checking blood pressure often enough on people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re overly relying on blood pressures</p>
<p>in the doctor&rsquo;s office, which are not being done correctly.</p>
<p>So we basically have our patients do this relentlessly.</p>
<p>So how often, let&rsquo;s say someone buys this,</p>
<p>because I think for $240,</p>
<p>I mean, I realize that&rsquo;s prohibitive for some people,</p>
<p>but given the cost of some of the other things</p>
<p>that are discussed on this and many other podcasts.</p>
<p>First of all, I would just have people start</p>
<p>with an automated cuff to begin with</p>
<p>and just start with there.</p>
<p>We generally have people do it for two weeks.</p>
<p>You know, we give our patients a little spreadsheet</p>
<p>that automatically calculates averages</p>
<p>and stuff like that, tells them what to record and where.</p>
<p>And we just say, look, for two weeks,</p>
<p>we want to see two recordings a day.</p>
<p>And, you know, do a morning and an afternoon</p>
<p>slash PM recording twice a day for two weeks</p>
<p>and let us see those numbers</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll scrutinize them further.</p>
<p>And if those numbers come in fine, let&rsquo;s revisit in a year.</p>
<p>Will a day ever come when a watch</p>
<p>or a wristband can do this really well?</p>
<p>So I hope so.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m investigating it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually going to be trying one out</p>
<p>in a couple of weeks with a company</p>
<p>that I tried two years ago.</p>
<p>Two years ago when I tried it, I was not impressed.</p>
<p>So I kind of punted on it.</p>
<p>The company, which I guess I&rsquo;ll not share</p>
<p>the name of the company just yet,</p>
<p>but they claim that it&rsquo;s significantly better.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to put it to the test again.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically a continuous monitor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a wrist device that about every 15 minutes</p>
<p>throughout the course of the day</p>
<p>will check your blood pressure.</p>
<p>To me, this would be, honestly, probably more important.</p>
<p>You know, you know how much emphasis I place on CGM</p>
<p>as a great thing to be able to test.</p>
<p>Right, I would argue this would be more important.</p>
<p>When the day comes that we can continuously</p>
<p>assess people&rsquo;s blood pressure,</p>
<p>it would be an integral part of a person&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>health checkup once a year is do two weeks</p>
<p>of continuous blood pressure monitoring.</p>
<p>Right now to do that, which I&rsquo;ve done as well,</p>
<p>is so cumbersome that it borders on absurd.</p>
<p>You actually have to wear a blood pressure cuff</p>
<p>that is attached to a clumsy device</p>
<p>that goes through the whole insufflation exercise</p>
<p>every 15 minutes, including while you&rsquo;re sleeping.</p>
<p>You know, it provides some insight,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so disruptive that it&rsquo;s not what we really want.</p>
<p>What we, the dream would be like a patch</p>
<p>that you could put, I don&rsquo;t know, over your chest</p>
<p>that can somehow impute changes in blood flow</p>
<p>or something like that and regulate.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll see, you know, between optical sensors</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>I hope that we&rsquo;re getting closer to having something.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want a stroke.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to bleed in the brain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to clot.</p>
<p>As long as we&rsquo;re at this number one on the list,</p>
<p>arteriosclerosis being the number one killer,</p>
<p>what are the major ways to prevent it?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s three big ones that stand out,</p>
<p>you know, top and center.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s kind of a fourth one</p>
<p>that I think is the foundational piece.</p>
<p>So the three big ones, we&rsquo;ve talked about one,</p>
<p>blood pressure.</p>
<p>So if your blood pressure is 120 over 80 or better,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>The second is not smoking.</p>
<p>So it turns out that smoking and blood pressure</p>
<p>are both devastating for arteries,</p>
<p>but for different reasons, right?</p>
<p>So smoking is devastating from a chemical perspective.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s completely irritating to the endothelium.</p>
<p>So the endothelium, as you know,</p>
<p>is the single cell lining that is the innermost part</p>
<p>of the arterial and arterial wall.</p>
<p>So this is a pretty special organ.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a bit naive,</p>
<p>but understandable that people just think</p>
<p>of arteries as tubes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>They have many layers to them,</p>
<p>but this particular layer is unusually important.</p>
<p>It has an outsized importance</p>
<p>because it is the one that&rsquo;s in contact</p>
<p>with the luminal side, right?</p>
<p>Where the blood is flowing in the tube</p>
<p>and anything that injures that</p>
<p>has significant consequences.</p>
<p>So smoking is irritating to that in a chemical way</p>
<p>and blood pressure is irritating to that</p>
<p>in a mechanical way.</p>
<p>So those two things basically,</p>
<p>you just wanna,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the low hanging fruit in my world, right?</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t wanna have those things</p>
<p>causing irritation to the endothelium</p>
<p>because that renders you now susceptible</p>
<p>to the third factor,</p>
<p>which is ApoB bearing lipoproteins.</p>
<p>I wanna talk about ApoB in depth,</p>
<p>but as long as don&rsquo;t smoke</p>
<p>is the second recommendation on the list,</p>
<p>can we better define smoking and what&rsquo;s being smoked?</p>
<p>So assume nicotine for,</p>
<p>what about cannabis and what about vaping</p>
<p>of nicotine and cannabis?</p>
<p>Because vaping has become so much more common.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sadly something we don&rsquo;t have a great answer for.</p>
<p>So I can certainly tell you</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no reason to believe</p>
<p>that smoking cannabis is somehow better</p>
<p>than smoking cigarettes,</p>
<p>but the dose seems to be significantly lower.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s consider a person who smokes a pack a day for 20 years.</p>
<p>We call that a 20 pack year smoker.</p>
<p>Someone who smokes two packs a day for 15 years</p>
<p>is a 30 pack year smoker.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a person who&rsquo;s dramatically increased</p>
<p>their risk of many cancers, including lung cancer,</p>
<p>and also their risk of cardiovascular</p>
<p>and cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not a THC guy,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t necessarily speak for the habits</p>
<p>of people that are smoking marijuana.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine they&rsquo;re smoking that much.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Yeah, so while on a joint to cigarette basis,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably equivalent in terms of harm.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a person smokes a joint a day,</p>
<p>that would be like smoking a cigarette a day.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a 20th of a pack.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t wanna say that there&rsquo;s no downside to that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably significantly less.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think the risk fully tracks.</p>
<p>I think the same is probably true for vaping,</p>
<p>and I wanna be clear, like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think vaping&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>The last time I looked at the data on this,</p>
<p>it was surprisingly sparse,</p>
<p>but to me, the only advantage I could see to vaping</p>
<p>was if it was the only way a person would stop smoking.</p>
<p>So there was, you know, I sort of looked at it as,</p>
<p>it was definitely the lesser of two evils,</p>
<p>but by far the better scenario</p>
<p>was not to do any of these things.</p>
<p>If nicotine is what you&rsquo;re after,</p>
<p>there are better ways to get nicotine, for example,</p>
<p>through lozenges and gum and things like that.</p>
<p>So you shouldn&rsquo;t be turning to those things to do it,</p>
<p>but if it was like, if gum is here and cigarettes are here,</p>
<p>you know, vaping was probably here, but boy, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>For those listening, Peter spaced his hands</p>
<p>far apart for gum and smoking</p>
<p>and put vaping about a third of the way</p>
<p>from gum toward smoking.</p>
<p>In other words, vaping isn&rsquo;t good for you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as bad as smoking.</p>
<p>That would be my, I mean, do you have a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve probably looked into this as well.</p>
<p>What are your views on this? Yeah, we did an episode</p>
<p>on nicotine, I did an episode on cannabis,</p>
<p>and, you know, the discussion around cannabis</p>
<p>gets a little contentious for reasons that aren&rsquo;t important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny, people, the moment someone starts</p>
<p>to confront cannabis as a potential health harm,</p>
<p>people say it&rsquo;s not nearly as bad as alcohol,</p>
<p>which is a crazy argument, right?</p>
<p>Getting hit by a bus isn&rsquo;t nearly as bad</p>
<p>as getting hit by a motorcycle in most cases,</p>
<p>but sometimes, you know, so that&rsquo;s just kind of silly.</p>
<p>And clearly cannabis has medical applications, clearly.</p>
<p>And then it becomes an issue of the ratio of THC to CBD,</p>
<p>pure CBD forms actually being quite effective</p>
<p>for the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy,</p>
<p>so-called Charlotte&rsquo;s Web, that&rsquo;s actually what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>Very high THC-containing cannabis clearly predisposes,</p>
<p>especially young males, to later-onset psychosis.</p>
<p>Those data are starting to become clear,</p>
<p>clear enough to me anyway that people ought to be aware</p>
<p>of them at least, and maybe make decisions</p>
<p>on the basis of those.</p>
<p>When it comes to the smoking versus vaping,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just very, very apparent</p>
<p>that the chemical constituents of the vape</p>
<p>and what people are inhaling are terrible for people</p>
<p>and are loaded with carcinogens and a bunch of other stuff,</p>
<p>many of which cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what worries me the most.</p>
<p>Now, obviously I&rsquo;m not a clinician,</p>
<p>but anytime I hear about small molecules, you know,</p>
<p>these small inorganic molecules getting</p>
<p>across the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>and then being maintained in neurons for many, many years,</p>
<p>I worry because the experiment is ongoing</p>
<p>mostly in young people.</p>
<p>So anyway, without going too far down that track,</p>
<p>I think if people can avoid smoking and vaping, they should.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned, there are other delivery devices</p>
<p>for nicotine and cannabis, tinctures and patches</p>
<p>and gums and things that, edibles that,</p>
<p>if people choose to use those substances, they can offset.</p>
<p>I think sometimes people would benefit to imagine</p>
<p>what the surface area of the lung is, right?</p>
<p>If you took the alveolar air sacs of the lungs</p>
<p>and spread them out, you would easily cover a tennis court.</p>
<p>Remarkable.</p>
<p>So just think about anytime you inhale something,</p>
<p>you are exposing, your body is so adept at absorbing it.</p>
<p>I mean, we have this unbelievable system for gas exchange</p>
<p>that was designed for gas exchange.</p>
<p>And anytime you&rsquo;re putting something else in that wake,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a really good job of getting it into your body.</p>
<p>So be mindful of what that is.</p>
<p>And that, look, that applies to pollution too.</p>
<p>I mean, the PM 2.5 data is pretty good.</p>
<p>I think once you,</p>
<p>so particulates that are less than 2.5 microns</p>
<p>are getting straight into the body,</p>
<p>which is like a great argument for avoiding air pollution.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, I always find it funny,</p>
<p>not to get off on this tangent,</p>
<p>but to me, the most compelling arguments</p>
<p>around cleaner energy</p>
<p>have nothing to do with greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>They have to do with air pollution.</p>
<p>I promise you more people are dying</p>
<p>from the particulate matters in air</p>
<p>that result from burning coal</p>
<p>than are ever going to die</p>
<p>from the CO2 emissions that result from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, and I would argue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be two orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even in the same zip code.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>During the fires, which seemed to follow me,</p>
<p>because when I was in Northern California,</p>
<p>there were a bunch of fires</p>
<p>and we were constantly looking.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>everything was covered with ash.</p>
<p>My dog was having trouble breathing.</p>
<p>I was having trouble breathing.</p>
<p>Everyone was suffering.</p>
<p>But there are websites that one can go.</p>
<p>You can just look at air pollution.</p>
<p>And we tend to only do this during fires.</p>
<p>And then when I&rsquo;m in Southern California,</p>
<p>there tend to be fires here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s correlation, not causation,</p>
<p>but for sure, I didn&rsquo;t set those fires, folks.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s clear that it disrupts your breathing</p>
<p>for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the long tail of that</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really talking about here.</p>
<p>The very small particulate that,</p>
<p>we know firefighters, for instance,</p>
<p>and certain industrial workers</p>
<p>can end up with that stuff embedded</p>
<p>in their brain tissue for extremely long periods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not good.</p>
<p>You make a really interesting point</p>
<p>about the call for cleaner energy.</p>
<p>Can we run that one up to Washington</p>
<p>or settle some of the debates about climate change</p>
<p>just by getting straight to that?</p>
<p>Right, right, I feel like-</p>
<p>To help me just bypass all the garbage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being spewed back and forth</p>
<p>and basically get to the issue at hand, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, just make it better for people</p>
<p>to not die from the direct consequence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics</p>
<p>that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains</p>
<p>a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals</p>
<p>that make sure that all of my foundational</p>
<p>nutritional needs are met.</p>
<p>And it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>So trying to avoid, such a difficult word to say,</p>
<p>especially for a neuroscientist, arteriosclerosis.</p>
<p>Did I get it right?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s athero, which is easier, because yeah.</p>
<p>Atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Oh, there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been making life more complicated for myself.</p>
<p>Typical of me.</p>
<p>Okay, so blood pressure, keeping it 120 over 80 or better.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t smoke.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just throw in don&rsquo;t vape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just plant my flag on it.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t vape.</p>
<p>There are other ways to get those things in your system</p>
<p>if you really want to get nicotine or cannabis</p>
<p>into your system.</p>
<p>ApoB, what&rsquo;s the story with ApoB?</p>
<p>Okay, so to explain this,</p>
<p>you have to tolerate a little bit of chemistry.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s heard of cholesterol.</p>
<p>And I certainly devote quite a bit of time in the book</p>
<p>to explaining this because it is so important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s definitely one of those areas</p>
<p>where I initially received a lot of pushback from the editor</p>
<p>and there was a thought that,</p>
<p>hey, this is a bit more technical than it needs to be.</p>
<p>But I think that sometimes you do need to resort</p>
<p>to longer dissertations to dispel mythology.</p>
<p>So cholesterol is a lipid.</p>
<p>It is a molecule that the body synthesizes.</p>
<p>It is a molecule that is essential for life.</p>
<p>So if you cannot synthesize cholesterol, you can&rsquo;t live.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll die in utero.</p>
<p>So there are rare genetic conditions</p>
<p>that prevent the successful synthesis of cholesterol.</p>
<p>Embryos that have those mutations do not survive.</p>
<p>Okay, so why do we need this stuff?</p>
<p>So we need this stuff primarily for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, it makes up a very important structural component</p>
<p>of cell membranes.</p>
<p>So as you know, a cell is a sphere.</p>
<p>We look at them and think they&rsquo;re circles,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re spheres and they&rsquo;re fluid, right?</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t just like little perfect,</p>
<p>big bowling balls or balloons.</p>
<p>They actually morph and shape and move in these paths.</p>
<p>And this is what allows cells to be next to each other</p>
<p>and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>They also have channels across all of them.</p>
<p>And those channels are held in place by,</p>
<p>among other things, cholesterol and phospholipids.</p>
<p>The second thing that makes cholesterol so important,</p>
<p>it is the precursor</p>
<p>to some of the most important hormones in our body.</p>
<p>So our sex hormones, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone,</p>
<p>in addition to glucocorticoids.</p>
<p>If you look at them, it&rsquo;s really funny.</p>
<p>People, if you&rsquo;re looking at, if you Google,</p>
<p>like give me the structure of these things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of like, wow, they&rsquo;re all basically the same.</p>
<p>They all look really similar.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all pretty much just templates of cholesterol.</p>
<p>So understandably, when it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that important,</p>
<p>the body would leave nothing to chance.</p>
<p>We make all of our own cholesterol.</p>
<p>The cholesterol that you eat in food, largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s esterified cholesterol.</p>
<p>So it means it has an ester side chain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bulky to absorb in the gut.</p>
<p>So most cholesterol that you eat in food</p>
<p>just goes out your GI tract.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have this super important molecule</p>
<p>that every cell in the body makes,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a bit of a problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually two problems.</p>
<p>The first problem is,</p>
<p>not every cell can make as much as it needs all the time.</p>
<p>So you have this demand problem.</p>
<p>So for example, if you&rsquo;re sick,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need to make far more glucocorticoids.</p>
<p>Your body&rsquo;s response is going to be</p>
<p>to ramp up cortisol production,</p>
<p>to mobilize fuel and do a whole bunch of other things.</p>
<p>And certain cells like the adrenal glands</p>
<p>are gonna be called on to rise</p>
<p>to a higher level of performance.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to make enough cortisol.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to have to borrow</p>
<p>or take cholesterol from other cells in the body.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the things we used to notice in the ICU,</p>
<p>I never knew why it was happening.</p>
<p>I now know is the few times I would accidentally</p>
<p>order the wrong set of labs on a patient in the ICU</p>
<p>and also order like a lipid test or something,</p>
<p>you would always notice their cholesterol levels</p>
<p>were dropping, serum cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>And I now realize why,</p>
<p>because they were basically just funneling cholesterol</p>
<p>to the adrenals to make more of the cortisol</p>
<p>that they needed to combat whatever</p>
<p>they were in the ICU for,</p>
<p>which is usually the most severe form of stress</p>
<p>the body is under.</p>
<p>So you have to be able to transport this stuff.</p>
<p>And then the second problem is, as you know,</p>
<p>cholesterol being a lipid is not water soluble.</p>
<p>So the most dominant highway in the body</p>
<p>is the circulatory system.</p>
<p>We can use the lymphatic system and things like that.</p>
<p>But for the most part, we use our circulatory system</p>
<p>as the highway to move stuff around.</p>
<p>And the highway is made up of water.</p>
<p>Plasma, which is the liquid component of your blood,</p>
<p>is water.</p>
<p>And therefore things that are water soluble move easily.</p>
<p>So glucose, sodium, electrolytes,</p>
<p>all of those things are dissolvable in water.</p>
<p>And therefore they don&rsquo;t need a carrier.</p>
<p>You just dissolve them in the water and they can go.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why your liver can make glucose</p>
<p>that your brain can easily get.</p>
<p>And there doesn&rsquo;t need to be a carrier or an intermediary</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>But unfortunately with cholesterol being a lipid,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Just as water and oil don&rsquo;t mix,</p>
<p>cholesterol and plasma don&rsquo;t mix.</p>
<p>So the body had to come up with a trick.</p>
<p>And the trick was designing a vehicle</p>
<p>that was water soluble on the outside</p>
<p>and fat soluble on the inside,</p>
<p>that you could bury the cholesterol inside</p>
<p>along with triglycerides.</p>
<p>And on the outside, it was covered in protein,</p>
<p>which is water soluble.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that moves around.</p>
<p>And that thing is called a lipoprotein.</p>
<p>And as its name suggests, it&rsquo;s part lipid, part protein.</p>
<p>Lipid on the inside, protein on the outside.</p>
<p>And those lipoproteins come largely</p>
<p>in two different families.</p>
<p>So one family comes from a lineage called ApoB.</p>
<p>So the ApoB family,</p>
<p>which is short for apolipoprotein B100,</p>
<p>is a family that is derived from the liver.</p>
<p>And each of those lipoproteins</p>
<p>has one and only one apolipoprotein B100 on it.</p>
<p>We shorten it and just call it ApoB</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t really worry about apolipoprotein B48,</p>
<p>which is attached to chylomicrons</p>
<p>that are responsible for fat absorption in the gut.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very short-lived.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really factor into atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna just, for the purists out there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an ApoB48, we&rsquo;re not gonna talk about it.</p>
<p>So when I say ApoB, what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>is a protein that wraps around</p>
<p>a subset of these lipoproteins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another family of lipoproteins called ApoA</p>
<p>or apolipoprotein A.</p>
<p>This is a much more complicated family.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about it here</p>
<p>because we would take an hour to just explain</p>
<p>how the apolipoprotein A family works.</p>
<p>But again, the punchline is</p>
<p>there are many apolipoprotein A&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s variable numbers of ApoA&rsquo;s on those proteins,</p>
<p>and they are all part of a family</p>
<p>called high-density lipoproteins.</p>
<p>Back to the ApoB guys,</p>
<p>they are of the low-density lipoprotein lineage.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve heard the term LDL and HDL.</p>
<p>What is it referring to?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically referring to the relative concentrations</p>
<p>of protein and lipids in the lipoproteins.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, based on their names,</p>
<p>the HDLs are higher density, more protein, less lipid.</p>
<p>The LDLs, low-density lipoproteins,</p>
<p>and VLDLs, very low-density lipoproteins,</p>
<p>and IDLs, intermediate-density lipoproteins,</p>
<p>are all lower density, which means more lipid to protein.</p>
<p>There are different sizes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of other things going on.</p>
<p>Most important fact in all of this</p>
<p>is that the ApoB&rsquo;s are atherogenic.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re about to talk about next</p>
<p>is perpetuated by lipoproteins that have an ApoB on them.</p>
<p>So everything in the story right now</p>
<p>is just about how do you get cholesterol around the body.</p>
<p>And these proteins that have lipid in the middle,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s just take ApoB, for example,</p>
<p>many, many billions of them floating around in our body,</p>
<p>even in the healthiest of people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re being shuttled to tissues that need them,</p>
<p>like the adrenals, muscle, heart, et cetera.</p>
<p>What sets the demand for these things?</p>
<p>So for instance, could somebody have relatively high LDL,</p>
<p>maybe even higher than sort of high end of chart</p>
<p>or even above high end ApoB,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some sort of demand, metabolic demand,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re weight training a lot,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re running marathons,</p>
<p>and so they need a lot of LDL.</p>
<p>The reason I ask this is because it&rsquo;s so easy</p>
<p>for the uninformed person,</p>
<p>which I include myself in that group,</p>
<p>to just hear, oh, LDL, bad, cholesterol, bad, ApoB, bad,</p>
<p>when in fact, you very graciously spelled out the fact</p>
<p>that these things actually perform a functional role</p>
<p>in the healthy body.</p>
<p>So before we get into why they are or can be bad,</p>
<p>why would you want a low-density lipoprotein?</p>
<p>What is that doing for somebody?</p>
<p>And is there any circumstance</p>
<p>where the way people are exercising or thinking</p>
<p>or not sleeping or sleeping too much,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that a higher level actually reflects</p>
<p>a healthy metabolic need?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any evidence of that to date.</p>
<p>All of the functions that I described</p>
<p>can be done by the HDL.</p>
<p>So the high-density lipoproteins, the ApoAs,</p>
<p>can do all of it.</p>
<p>So ApoB and low-density lipoproteins</p>
<p>are just the necessary, the waste?</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t understand why we have them, Andrew.</p>
<p>This is the part that&rsquo;s really interesting to me.</p>
<p>Most species do not even have ApoB.</p>
<p>And as a result of that,</p>
<p>most species are chemically incapable of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>So if someone could zero out their ApoB and their LDL,</p>
<p>we assume they would function just fine.</p>
<p>We know they would because we have certain people</p>
<p>who walk around with genetic mutations</p>
<p>that render them that way.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also know that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bit of a myth out there that cholesterol,</p>
<p>the cholesterol you measure in your blood</p>
<p>is essential for brain health, for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an understandable thing, right?</p>
<p>You can speak to this very eloquently,</p>
<p>the role of cholesterol in the brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wrote down when I was a postdoc at Stanford.</p>
<p>So I always point out, I was born at Stanford,</p>
<p>trained at Stanford, worried I&rsquo;d probably die at Stanford</p>
<p>hopefully a long time from now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll tell me how long from now by the end of the episode.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do the Charlie Munger thing</p>
<p>and make sure that you never go back to Stanford</p>
<p>so that you can&rsquo;t die there.</p>
<p>There, exactly.</p>
<p>We cured already.</p>
<p>When I was a postdoc, I worked with a guy named Ben Barris,</p>
<p>who I know you know probably as a different person then</p>
<p>for reasons that people can look up Ben&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Anyway, incredible scientist.</p>
<p>But there was someone in his lab that discovered</p>
<p>that cholesterol is a critical component</p>
<p>of the synaptogenesis process,</p>
<p>the formation of connections between neurons</p>
<p>in the developing brain.</p>
<p>And then that went on to lead to the discovery</p>
<p>of things like thrombospondins being important</p>
<p>for synaptogenesis, et cetera.</p>
<p>But cholesterol sits central</p>
<p>in the brain development mechanisms.</p>
<p>Like you want cholesterol around for brain development.</p>
<p>In fact, I think very low fat diets</p>
<p>and very low cholesterol diets during early development</p>
<p>can really impair brain development as I understand.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not entirely clear why,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what we know.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re born,</p>
<p>your serum cholesterol levels are very low.</p>
<p>So children, infants and children,</p>
<p>have very low levels of cholesterol.</p>
<p>They would have,</p>
<p>and I should explain one thing that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not myelinated yet, right?</p>
<p>I mean, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but myelin of course,</p>
<p>the sheathing around neuronal axons,</p>
<p>which accelerates the propagation of nerve signals</p>
<p>and which is deficient in things like multiple sclerosis</p>
<p>is essentially fat made up of phospholipids</p>
<p>and requires cholesterol for synthesis.</p>
<p>But young children are not very well myelinated.</p>
<p>I mean, the spinal cord is myelinated.</p>
<p>Right, so this is what&rsquo;s interesting, right?</p>
<p>We would all agree that cholesterol is more important</p>
<p>to infants and children than to anybody else, right?</p>
<p>It would be the most important substrate</p>
<p>for CNS development.</p>
<p>And yet infants and children</p>
<p>have virtually unmeasurable levels of cholesterol.</p>
<p>It really starts to take off in your teenage years, right?</p>
<p>So cholesterol basically,</p>
<p>serum cholesterol levels rise</p>
<p>basically monotonically throughout life.</p>
<p>Women get a big bump at menopause.</p>
<p>So it really goes up for them.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is how is it,</p>
<p>how do we reconcile the fact that infants and children</p>
<p>have really low levels of serum cholesterol</p>
<p>yet clearly undergo CNS maturation without any problems?</p>
<p>And it basically comes down to the following.</p>
<p>What you measure in the serum</p>
<p>is but a fraction of the total body pool of cholesterol.</p>
<p>So we get a little bit of the light under the,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the street lamp under the-</p>
<p>The drunk under a lamppost, yeah, yeah, right.</p>
<p>Just because we&rsquo;re looking there,</p>
<p>we tend to think that that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>But if you took the entire circulatory pool of cholesterol,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about 10% of your total body cholesterol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tiny fraction of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s what we measure,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s all we have access to,</p>
<p>but it really represents virtually none of it.</p>
<p>I do wanna say something,</p>
<p>because you mentioned LDL.</p>
<p>I wanna tie this back to the reader, right?</p>
<p>Or the listener, rather.</p>
<p>ApoB refers to the lipoprotein,</p>
<p>the singular lipoprotein wrapped around an LDL particle.</p>
<p>So if you happen to be lucky enough</p>
<p>that your doctor measures an ApoB level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a blood test.</p>
<p>It says ApoB, X number of milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s measuring the concentration of that protein.</p>
<p>It is a direct measurement of the concentration</p>
<p>of LDL and VLDL particles.</p>
<p>When you have a blood test that says LDL,</p>
<p>it usually doesn&rsquo;t say LDL.</p>
<p>It usually says LDL-C or LDL-cholesterol,</p>
<p>because LDL is not a laboratory measurement.</p>
<p>LDL-cholesterol is a laboratory measurement,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just taking the total number of LDL particles,</p>
<p>breaking them apart,</p>
<p>and measuring how much cholesterol is in them.</p>
<p>So LDL-C measures the total concentration</p>
<p>of cholesterol in the LDLs.</p>
<p>ApoB measures the number of them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re different,</p>
<p>but one of them is far superior at predicting risk,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s ApoB.</p>
<p>The number of particles is much more predictive of risk</p>
<p>than the amount of cholesterol contained within them.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>First time I&rsquo;ve understood HCL, LDL,</p>
<p>and these lipoproteins in a way that makes sense.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure others feel the same way.</p>
<p>What ApoB level is your red flag cutoff, right?</p>
<p>I actually had my ApoB measured recently,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m definitely above the high end.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be discussing this over dinner on Saturday night.</p>
<p>And just to tie this back,</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s a steak dinner,</p>
<p>and that should be fine,</p>
<p>given the fact that dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>has no direct link to ApoB and LDL.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but dietary saturated fat does.</p>
<p>Okay, so-</p>
<p>Which is not to say we&rsquo;re not gonna have a steak, we will,</p>
<p>but-</p>
<p>Not necessarily one of the fattier cuts,</p>
<p>although probably will be for me.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the high end that you, high end flag?</p>
<p>Yeah, what point do you start saying,</p>
<p>we need to do something,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll talk about what people can do.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is a complicated question</p>
<p>because it depends on so many factors.</p>
<p>The first factor it depends on is what is your objective?</p>
<p>And I do pose this question directly to a patient, right?</p>
<p>So I say, look, we&rsquo;ve got this disease</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the number one cause of death.</p>
<p>Now, you can die with it, or you can die from it.</p>
<p>Those are your choices.</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, more people will die from it</p>
<p>than anything else.</p>
<p>But if you live long enough,</p>
<p>we will all die with it to some extent.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re me, and I come from a family history,</p>
<p>as you know, I write about this in the book,</p>
<p>where basically every man in my family except one</p>
<p>has died of atherosclerosis,</p>
<p>and they have all done so very prematurely.</p>
<p>My dad lost brothers in their 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>By some miracle, my dad is still alive at 86,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s in large part</p>
<p>because he at least had the good sense</p>
<p>to listen to doctors and take medication</p>
<p>to lower his cholesterol and blood pressure.</p>
<p>If your objective is to not die from heart disease</p>
<p>and only to die with it,</p>
<p>then you want ApoB as low as possible.</p>
<p>Now, how low you go depends on when you start,</p>
<p>because one way to think about this</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s an area under the curve problem.</p>
<p>The longer you wait to start doing something about this,</p>
<p>the more aggressively you need to do something about it.</p>
<p>I think a better way to think about this, though,</p>
<p>is to go back to what we talked about with smoking.</p>
<p>So would you agree that smoking</p>
<p>is causally related to lung cancer?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So just to be clear, Andrew,</p>
<p>you do not think that it&rsquo;s just an association</p>
<p>that smokers get more lung cancer?</p>
<p>No, I do not.</p>
<p>In other words, you believe</p>
<p>that smoking causes lung cancer, then?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a number of mechanistic steps in between.</p>
<p>I mean, if somebody was really wanting to get to,</p>
<p>you know, drill into the logic,</p>
<p>they could say, okay, it&rsquo;s not actually the smoking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, you know, some disruption</p>
<p>of the endothelial cell lining that, you know,</p>
<p>But smoking triggers that, that triggers that.</p>
<p>I assume so.</p>
<p>And I agree with you, by the way.</p>
<p>I think the data are very clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very relieved to hear that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going someplace very important here</p>
<p>because if there&rsquo;s one topic</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t get enough attention in medicine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s causality.</p>
<p>And causality is an obsession of mine.</p>
<p>Like most of the day on some level,</p>
<p>I sit around thinking about causality.</p>
<p>And I think the hardest part about studying medicine</p>
<p>with respect to human beings</p>
<p>is how difficult it is to infer causality</p>
<p>for most things that we do.</p>
<p>So if you believe that smoking</p>
<p>is causally related to lung cancer,</p>
<p>then smoking cessation reduces</p>
<p>the probability of lung cancer.</p>
<p>That is a logical equivalency.</p>
<p>There can be no debate about that.</p>
<p>What if I said to you, Andrew,</p>
<p>this is going to be our new philosophy</p>
<p>around smoking cessation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna anoint you the czar of smoking cessation.</p>
<p>So if people pick up smoking, no problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna let them smoke.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going to assess their risk for lung cancer</p>
<p>using a model that predicts</p>
<p>when their 10 year risk of lung cancer</p>
<p>gets above a certain level,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna recommend that they stop smoking.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna look at their age,</p>
<p>their sex, their family history,</p>
<p>some biomarkers that might help us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna even do scans of their lungs.</p>
<p>And once we think they cross a threshold</p>
<p>where their risk of lung cancer is high enough,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s 25%, boom.</p>
<p>You make them stop.</p>
<p>You tell them it&rsquo;s time to stop.</p>
<p>Is that a logical approach</p>
<p>to treating smoking and lung cancer?</p>
<p>Or would it be better to say,</p>
<p>given that we know cigarettes are causally related to this,</p>
<p>how about you never start smoking</p>
<p>and the minute you do,</p>
<p>we pull the cigarette out of your mouth</p>
<p>and explain to you that you&rsquo;re doing something</p>
<p>that is causally related.</p>
<p>Of course it would be the latter, not the former.</p>
<p>It would be idiotic to suggest that we endorse smoking</p>
<p>until you cross a certain threshold.</p>
<p>Well, this now becomes the germane question.</p>
<p>There is no ambiguity that ApoB</p>
<p>is causally related to atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>You know, how can I tell you that?</p>
<p>I can tell you that looking at</p>
<p>all of the clinical trial literature,</p>
<p>all of the epidemiologic literature,</p>
<p>and perhaps even most importantly,</p>
<p>the Mendelian randomizations.</p>
<p>All of these things tell us, because by the way-</p>
<p>Mendelian randomizations, meaning genetic mutants,</p>
<p>humans out there that make very little ApoB</p>
<p>or excessive ApoB. And very much, exactly.</p>
<p>So we have the whole gradient.</p>
<p>So you can say, if you make very little,</p>
<p>you aren&rsquo;t gonna die as quickly in your life</p>
<p>as if you make too much.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So Mendelian randomization is such an elegant tool</p>
<p>where you basically let genes do the randomization.</p>
<p>And as you said, there is a gradation of LDL concentration</p>
<p>or ApoB concentration that occurs from insanely low</p>
<p>to insanely high.</p>
<p>And this is a wildly polygenic polymorphic</p>
<p>set of conditions.</p>
<p>And we can look at the outcomes of those people</p>
<p>based on the random sorting of those genes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no ambiguity.</p>
<p>LDL is causally related.</p>
<p>LDL cholesterol or ApoB,</p>
<p>causally related to atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Well, if that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t seen a credible argument that it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>there are people who argue that it&rsquo;s not by the way,</p>
<p>but they just don&rsquo;t have credibility in their arguments.</p>
<p>Then you have to say that what we&rsquo;re doing in medicine today</p>
<p>is very backwards.</p>
<p>Because what we&rsquo;re doing in medicine today is the following.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying, I&rsquo;m coming at this</p>
<p>in a long way, but your question is so important</p>
<p>that I want to answer it this way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re answering your question today as follows.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying, Andrew, let&rsquo;s do a 10 year risk calculation</p>
<p>of your risk of MACE.</p>
<p>MACE stands for Major Adverse Cardiac Event.</p>
<p>It is the metric we use in medicine.</p>
<p>So a Major Adverse Cardiac Event is a heart attack,</p>
<p>stroke, or death basically resulting from these things.</p>
<p>So, and we have calculators that are pretty good</p>
<p>at predicting your 10 year event risk.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll look at your cholesterol levels,</p>
<p>your blood pressure, they&rsquo;ll ask if you smoke,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll ask some family history questions,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll spit out a number.</p>
<p>Now we should do yours after the fact.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, if we did it for a person who&rsquo;s is,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re in your mid forties,</p>
<p>like it would probably spit out less than 5% risk</p>
<p>for a Major Adverse Cardiac Event in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>In fact, the models don&rsquo;t even work if age is below 40.</p>
<p>So the first time I went to do one of these tests</p>
<p>when I was in my mid thirties, I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Like the algorithm breaks.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like, you know, just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So the implication there is if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>if your MACE risk is less than 5%,</p>
<p>the thinking is you do not need to treat LDL or ApoB.</p>
<p>I argue that that makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just as idiotic as the analogy I used around smoking.</p>
<p>If a risk is causal and it is modifiable,</p>
<p>it should be modified regardless of the risk tail in duration.</p>
<p>So then the question becomes to what level?</p>
<p>And again, the earlier you start,</p>
<p>the less aggressive you need to be,</p>
<p>the less damage that&rsquo;s there already.</p>
<p>So for example, we do CT angiograms on our patients.</p>
<p>If the CT angiogram shows no evidence of calcification,</p>
<p>no evidence of soft plaque,</p>
<p>that means grossly their coronary arteries are still normal.</p>
<p>Histologically, they&rsquo;re probably not</p>
<p>because nobody probably makes it to our age</p>
<p>with histologically perfect coronary arteries.</p>
<p>You know, we might be satisfied with a person&rsquo;s ApoB</p>
<p>being at the fifth percentile of the population,</p>
<p>which would be about 60 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>But if we have any other factors,</p>
<p>meaning we&rsquo;re starting later in life,</p>
<p>or a person already has gross evidence of disease,</p>
<p>calcification, soft plaque, family history is significant,</p>
<p>any other risk factors are present,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll treat ApoB to 30 to 40 milligrams</p>
<p>per deciliter, which is probably the first percentile.</p>
<p>And if somebody&rsquo;s sitting up in the, say, low 130s,</p>
<p>where does that, what kind of flag does that raise for you?</p>
<p>And I realize it&rsquo;s highly contextual, age, et cetera.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s a huge red flag.</p>
<p>Again, just because something is causal</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re guaranteed to get it.</p>
<p>There are smokers who don&rsquo;t get lung cancer.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s gonna be somebody listening to this</p>
<p>who says, my grandmother&rsquo;s 95 years old,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s, her cholesterol is sky high,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s alive and well.</p>
<p>And I will say, absolutely.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people walking around that way,</p>
<p>just as there are a lot of smokers walking around</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t get lung cancer.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t impute these things</p>
<p>on an individual basis.</p>
<p>You basically have to ask the question,</p>
<p>how do I make the best judgment about an individual</p>
<p>from heterogeneous population data,</p>
<p>and based on what are causal</p>
<p>and non-causal inferences around risk?</p>
<p>So, you know, to me,</p>
<p>if a person has very high ApoB</p>
<p>and they do not want to be treated for it,</p>
<p>then the best we would do is say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s at least establish</p>
<p>that there are no other risk factors present,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s at least do the most investigation we can</p>
<p>around the existing damage.</p>
<p>And if that person has a perfect CT angiogram,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna push less hard</p>
<p>than if they have a devastating angiogram.</p>
<p>And by the way, devastating in my book</p>
<p>is just any amount of calcification or soft plaque.</p>
<p>Anything that shows up grossly that you can see on a CT scan</p>
<p>means that you&rsquo;ve got a decade plus</p>
<p>of really bad histology building up to it.</p>
<p>This issue of causality,</p>
<p>I think now becomes very clear as to why that is so crucial,</p>
<p>and really appreciate the way you spelled that out.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say somebody&rsquo;s ApoB is, you know, 80, 100,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 130, for example,</p>
<p>what sorts of things can they do to reduce that number?</p>
<p>Is this always gonna be prescription medication?</p>
<p>And if so, what are the more common forms</p>
<p>of prescription medication that work best?</p>
<p>What are their side effect profiles and so on?</p>
<p>So, yeah, usually once you wanna start getting down</p>
<p>into the 30 to 60 range,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna require pharmacotherapy.</p>
<p>But, you know, usually we wanna see</p>
<p>how far we can get with nutrition.</p>
<p>So fixing insulin resistance in an insulin resistant person</p>
<p>will bring this down, right?</p>
<p>So one of the hallmarks of insulin resistance</p>
<p>is elevated triglycerides.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t, we haven&rsquo;t talked about triglycerides,</p>
<p>but they warrant some attention</p>
<p>because I mentioned it earlier,</p>
<p>but one of the other things that the lipoproteins carry</p>
<p>is triglycerides.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re carrying fat and cholesterol.</p>
<p>And if you recall, ApoB represents the number of particles.</p>
<p>So the purpose of them is to be carrying around</p>
<p>mostly cholesterol,</p>
<p>but if you have a high amount of triglyceride,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically using up cargo space on the ships.</p>
<p>And so you need more ships.</p>
<p>So if a person has elevated triglycerides,</p>
<p>and I consider anything over 100 to be elevated,</p>
<p>even though most laboratory tests would consider normal</p>
<p>to be up to 150 milligrams per deciliter,</p>
<p>we would want to fix their insulin resistance,</p>
<p>bring the trigs way down.</p>
<p>I would wanna see trigs no more than two times</p>
<p>the HDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>So if their HDL cholesterol is, you know,</p>
<p>60 milligrams per deciliter,</p>
<p>I consider 120 to be through the roof high.</p>
<p>And ideally we want trigs at or below HDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>Trigs being triglycerides.</p>
<p>Does that mean lowering dietary fat?</p>
<p>No, actually it&rsquo;s most easily accomplished</p>
<p>through carbohydrate restriction.</p>
<p>Triglycerides in some ways are kind of an integral</p>
<p>of carbohydrate consumption.</p>
<p>Any energy restriction will get it for you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s most sensitive to restriction of,</p>
<p>even under eukaloric conditions,</p>
<p>carbohydrate restriction will lower triglycerides.</p>
<p>So again, energy restriction would be</p>
<p>kind of first order of business,</p>
<p>but within that carbohydrate restriction</p>
<p>will probably get you there quicker.</p>
<p>So, you know, you sort of take the low hanging fruit</p>
<p>off the table.</p>
<p>And where does exercise come play a role?</p>
<p>Minimal role.</p>
<p>For improving insulin sensitivity?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>For improving lipids in general.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it can improve insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>Especially combinations of resistance training</p>
<p>and cardiovascular exercise, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So once it comes down to pharmacotherapy,</p>
<p>you basically have several classes of drugs.</p>
<p>So the most obvious and the one that most people</p>
<p>are aware of are called statins.</p>
<p>So statins work both directly and indirectly</p>
<p>on the problem.</p>
<p>So directly they work by targeting an enzyme</p>
<p>very high in the synthetic pathway</p>
<p>of cholesterol production.</p>
<p>Enzyme is called HMG-CoA reductase.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the second committed step.</p>
<p>I might, I could be wrong on that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the first committed step,</p>
<p>but that enzyme gets targeted kind of ubiquitously</p>
<p>throughout the body.</p>
<p>And in response to that, the liver senses a reduction</p>
<p>in the body&rsquo;s pool of cholesterol.</p>
<p>And the liver really tries to regulate this.</p>
<p>So the liver in response to that increases its expression</p>
<p>of LDL receptors.</p>
<p>So the liver itself has LDL receptors on its surface.</p>
<p>And as the body&rsquo;s pool of cholesterol goes down,</p>
<p>the liver senses this reduction and says,</p>
<p>I want to bring more cholesterol in.</p>
<p>More LDL receptors go up and more ApoB particles</p>
<p>are coming out of circulation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really the dominant way that they work.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s kind of the dominant way</p>
<p>that all of these drugs work.</p>
<p>So another class of drug is called ezetimibe.</p>
<p>It works by blocking,</p>
<p>we could get as technical as you want on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Niemann-Pixie one-like-one transporter</p>
<p>in the enterocyte.</p>
<p>I like to explain this.</p>
<p>I borrow this explanation from Tom Dayspring,</p>
<p>but the enterocyte is obviously the luminal gut side cell</p>
<p>that is responsible for absorption of cholesterol.</p>
<p>Remember I said earlier,</p>
<p>most of the cholesterol you eat, you don&rsquo;t absorb.</p>
<p>The reason you can&rsquo;t absorb it</p>
<p>is an esterified cholesterol molecule</p>
<p>cannot come in the Niemann-Pixie one-like-one transporter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s physically too large.</p>
<p>But the cholesterol that you synthesize,</p>
<p>which once it makes its way back to the liver,</p>
<p>gets secreted in bile down the intestine</p>
<p>that is unesterified and readily fits into that transporter.</p>
<p>So I kind of described that guy</p>
<p>as the ticket taker at the bar.</p>
<p>He lets everybody in as long as they fit through the door.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a checkpoint inside the bar</p>
<p>that basically says, do we have too much cholesterol?</p>
<p>If so, spit it out.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another door that acts more like the bouncer</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s called the ATP binding cassette G5, G8,</p>
<p>and he spits excess cholesterol out.</p>
<p>And if that system&rsquo;s working fine,</p>
<p>everything is great.</p>
<p>But in a lot of people,</p>
<p>that ATP binding cassette doesn&rsquo;t work very well</p>
<p>and it can&rsquo;t properly regulate</p>
<p>the total body pool of cholesterol.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a drug called ezetimibe</p>
<p>that simply blocks the ticket taker.</p>
<p>Are there side effects to statins and ezetimibe?</p>
<p>Ezetimibe has virtually no side effects.</p>
<p>You can think of it as a drug</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s acting outside the body, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of acting on a turnstile door in your gut.</p>
<p>I have seen one patient get sort of loose stools from it</p>
<p>that became enough of an issue that we discontinued it.</p>
<p>I would say that when ezetimibe is combined with a statin,</p>
<p>which is very commonly done,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not unheard of, I can&rsquo;t give you a number,</p>
<p>but it could be as high as 10%</p>
<p>that you see an elevation in transaminases,</p>
<p>which are enzymes that are made by the liver</p>
<p>in response to some irritation.</p>
<p>So this is where I think it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>what the clinical significance of that is.</p>
<p>We tend to abort the strategy</p>
<p>in the presence of elevated transaminases.</p>
<p>Even though the literature says you don&rsquo;t need to,</p>
<p>our view is we have other options.</p>
<p>Why would we tolerate any inflammation</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t need to?</p>
<p>Statins do have side effects.</p>
<p>So 5% of people genuinely and legitimately</p>
<p>get a muscle soreness that can be debilitating.</p>
<p>It could feel like kind of the worst workout</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever had that, you know,</p>
<p>like the day after you&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>like imagine you hadn&rsquo;t lifted weights in six months</p>
<p>and then you came over</p>
<p>and I made you do the most brutal workout of your life.</p>
<p>You know how you would feel the next day?</p>
<p>That happens every time I come over to you.</p>
<p>Well, I work out often,</p>
<p>but every time I come over to your house,</p>
<p>you put me through the most brutal workout</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever been through.</p>
<p>I think you and Cam Haines are the two people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve managed to put me through workouts</p>
<p>that kept me sore for at least two weeks after each visit.</p>
<p>So that soreness,</p>
<p>that imagine you would have that persisting,</p>
<p>5% of people get that response from a statin.</p>
<p>And obviously that&rsquo;s just non,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a non do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a narrower subset of people</p>
<p>that do get brain fog</p>
<p>and do experience brain fog from statins.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really understand the why there.</p>
<p>We have some theories as to why,</p>
<p>you know, maybe they&rsquo;re getting too much</p>
<p>of a reduction in central cholesterol.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re getting too much of a reduction</p>
<p>in blood synthesis.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a subjective finding,</p>
<p>but given that we have so many tools in the toolkit,</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t have to tolerate side effects</p>
<p>with these drugs anymore.</p>
<p>There was a day when, you know,</p>
<p>you had somebody who just had a heart attack</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re basically looking down the barrel</p>
<p>of being on a statin for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>And there were like two of them</p>
<p>and they, you know, had tons of side effects</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Today, while there were probably nine statins out there,</p>
<p>there were really only four that we even use.</p>
<p>And at least two of them have such a low</p>
<p>side effect profile.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not as potent, but they have a,</p>
<p>I mean, potent&rsquo;s a bit of the,</p>
<p>potent&rsquo;s the wrong word.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the same effect,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re very potent because you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>at least one of them you&rsquo;re taking at such a low dose,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve got lots of statin options.</p>
<p>The third side effect of statins,</p>
<p>which again, not common,</p>
<p>but can&rsquo;t be ignored is insulin resistance.</p>
<p>So it really, and this is one of the,</p>
<p>I think one of the benefits of at least having</p>
<p>periodic CGM tracking is, we&rsquo;ll see this, you know,</p>
<p>we had a patient who happened to be wearing CGM in general.</p>
<p>And then we started him on, you know,</p>
<p>10 milligrams of Resuvastatin,</p>
<p>which is probably the workhorse statin right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a generic name for Crestor.</p>
<p>And he pings us like a couple of weeks later</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, man, my glucose is like 10 points up</p>
<p>consistently from where it has normally been.</p>
<p>Kind of hummed and hawed.</p>
<p>We troubleshooted a few things.</p>
<p>After two months, we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just stop the Crestor and see if that fixes it.</p>
<p>And it immediately fixed it.</p>
<p>So there was, you know,</p>
<p>we reintroduced the Crestor and it happened again.</p>
<p>So there was no doubt in my mind that, you know,</p>
<p>or low doubt in my mind that Crestor</p>
<p>was responsible for that.</p>
<p>And again, you could say,</p>
<p>well, maybe that&rsquo;s not that clinically significant,</p>
<p>but I would argue, why bother?</p>
<p>I have other choices.</p>
<p>So those are your two big ones.</p>
<p>The next one that is really the big one</p>
<p>are PCSK9 inhibitors.</p>
<p>So, you know, gosh,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re coming up to about 20 years ago,</p>
<p>maybe a woman named Helen Hobbs</p>
<p>made a discovery of a group of people</p>
<p>that had a disease called familial hypercholesterolemia.</p>
<p>So FH or familial hypercholesterolemia</p>
<p>is a very genetic heterogeneous condition.</p>
<p>Going back to that Mendelian randomization study,</p>
<p>these are the people on the far end</p>
<p>that show us how high lipid levels cause atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>So these people have very high cholesterol levels,</p>
<p>typically north of 300 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>Their LDL cholesterol alone is by definition</p>
<p>at least 190 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>Very high incidence of atherosclerosis in these people,</p>
<p>along with other sort of injuries.</p>
<p>Like they have so much cholesterol,</p>
<p>they accumulate it in their tendons, in their eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really devastating condition</p>
<p>if not managed correctly.</p>
<p>And she discovered this mutation in a gene for PCSK9.</p>
<p>A gene that codes for a protein that degrades LDL receptors.</p>
<p>So these people had hyperfunctioning PCSK9 genes.</p>
<p>So their genes were just chopping down</p>
<p>all the LDL receptors in the liver.</p>
<p>So these people weren&rsquo;t clearing LDL.</p>
<p>About five years later, another subset of the population</p>
<p>were discovered that were the exact opposite.</p>
<p>These people had hypofunctioning PCSK9.</p>
<p>They had virtually unmeasurable&hellip;</p>
<p>These people had LDL cholesterol levels</p>
<p>up to 20 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, they had no heart disease.</p>
<p>So that led to the development of a couple of amazing drugs</p>
<p>that are now used.</p>
<p>So I take one of these drugs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking one of these drugs for,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I probably started in 2015.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an injectable drug.</p>
<p>I take it every two weeks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called a PCSK9 inhibitor.</p>
<p>So the drug blocks the protein</p>
<p>and therefore gives me more LDL receptors,</p>
<p>yanks more apobiotic circulation.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>When we were talking about side effects,</p>
<p>I was thinking, are there any short-term benefits?</p>
<p>So I guess we&rsquo;d call this positive side effects,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s think of it more directly in line</p>
<p>with the underlying biology.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say my apob is high, mid-range to high,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s say 100, you know, 80 to 100.</p>
<p>And I improve my insulin resistance through nutrition,</p>
<p>but we decide, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t go down so much.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna continue to try and knock this number down.</p>
<p>And I take any number of different drugs to reduce it.</p>
<p>Do I immediately start to feel better?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no-</p>
<p>You feel nothing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an important point</p>
<p>because of the causality issue</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people are walking around out there,</p>
<p>feeling fine, their apob might be a bit high.</p>
<p>They either know it or don&rsquo;t know it,</p>
<p>but they think, well, I&rsquo;m feeling fine.</p>
<p>And you gave a very rational argument earlier</p>
<p>as to why, because of the causality involved,</p>
<p>it makes far more sense to intervene.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t wanna rely on feeling</p>
<p>when it comes to atherosclerosis,</p>
<p>just to put some perspective on this.</p>
<p>When I was in medical school,</p>
<p>we had a, and I think I even write about this in the book,</p>
<p>we had a pathology lecture</p>
<p>where the professor stands up there and he says,</p>
<p>what is the most common presentation of a heart attack?</p>
<p>And us keener first-year med students,</p>
<p>hands shoot straight up.</p>
<p>Chest pain.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not the most common.</p>
<p>Oh, shoulder pain.</p>
<p>Arm radiating down the left arm.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Nausea.</p>
<p>Shortness of breath.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>We rattled this off for a few minutes.</p>
<p>And he goes, death.</p>
<p>The single most common presentation</p>
<p>for a myocardial infarction is death.</p>
<p>More people, now, I would say today,</p>
<p>that was 25 years ago.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s probably not the most common</p>
<p>because advanced cardiac life support is so much better,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still strikingly common.</p>
<p>Well, you could say that the best predictor</p>
<p>of a heart attack is still a heart attack.</p>
<p>I mean, not saying that the best underlying predictor,</p>
<p>and actually, this hits home.</p>
<p>When I was a postdoc, I was living in San Francisco,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll never forget this,</p>
<p>taking my coffee out on my porch in the morning.</p>
<p>This was right near the UCSF Parnassus campus.</p>
<p>And this guy&rsquo;s walking down the street.</p>
<p>He was probably about my age.</p>
<p>And I said, hello.</p>
<p>And he said, hello.</p>
<p>He walked a few more steps, and boom,</p>
<p>he just hit the concrete and died right in front of me.</p>
<p>It took a minute or two to know that he was truly dead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget it because that&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>for a non-surgeon, it&rsquo;s an event, right?</p>
<p>And I followed up on this,</p>
<p>because his family, you know, the whole thing,</p>
<p>because they wanted a report and no cocaine in his system,</p>
<p>no prior history of any kind of health issues.</p>
<p>And, but he was just strolling along and just boom,</p>
<p>as if he&rsquo;d been hit by a bus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I mean, again,</p>
<p>this is just one of those things where we&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s spent a lot of time talking about things</p>
<p>that feel good and feel bad when you change them, right?</p>
<p>Like if you take a person who&rsquo;s not sleeping well,</p>
<p>but who thinks they&rsquo;re sleeping well,</p>
<p>and you ask them for a leap of faith,</p>
<p>which is, hey, give me a month</p>
<p>to help you sleep really well.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna feel better.</p>
<p>You might not know it now</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know how bad you&rsquo;re sleeping now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve become acclimated to this,</p>
<p>but this is not one of those domains.</p>
<p>You know, exercise, nutrition, sleep, all those things.</p>
<p>When you do those things better, you feel better.</p>
<p>But, you know, I don&rsquo;t wanna over-promise on this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna feel better in the moment</p>
<p>when you fix your lipids,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll feel better when you don&rsquo;t have a heart attack.</p>
<p>So by all this logic,</p>
<p>everybody should get their ApoB measured.</p>
<p>How early in life should people do that,</p>
<p>starting in their 20s, in their 30s?</p>
<p>Certainly, if you have a family history</p>
<p>that is of any concern,</p>
<p>like if I could live my life over again,</p>
<p>knowing, if I knew everything, you know,</p>
<p>then that I know today,</p>
<p>yeah, I would have had mine measured in my 20s.</p>
<p>You know, I didn&rsquo;t get my ApoB measured for the first time,</p>
<p>probably till I was in my 40s because, you know, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>well, yeah, maybe late 30s, early 40s, right?</p>
<p>I had my first calcium scan when I was 35</p>
<p>and I had to beg, borrow, steal to get it done</p>
<p>because everyone was like,</p>
<p>why does a 35-year-old wanna do this?</p>
<p>But I, something,</p>
<p>I just felt something was wrong given my family history.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I did that because I learned something</p>
<p>that completely changed the direction of my life.</p>
<p>Okay, I know my ApoB numbers</p>
<p>and that I might be that guy who&rsquo;s up in the,</p>
<p>you know, above a hundred,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna get this treated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a promise to myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just take a brief moment</p>
<p>and thank one of our podcast sponsors,</p>
<p>which is InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that blood work</p>
<p>is the only way that you can monitor the markers,</p>
<p>such as hormone markers, lipids, metabolic factors,</p>
<p>et cetera, that impact your immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>One major challenge with blood work, however,</p>
<p>is that most of the time,</p>
<p>it does not come back with any information</p>
<p>about what to do in order to move the values</p>
<p>for hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,</p>
<p>into the ranges that you want.</p>
<p>With InsideTracker, changing those values</p>
<p>becomes very straightforward</p>
<p>because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use</p>
<p>to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,</p>
<p>supplement-based approaches that you can use</p>
<p>in order to move those values into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you, your vitality,</p>
<p>and your longevity.</p>
<p>InsideTracker now includes a measurement</p>
<p>of apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB, in their ultimate plan.</p>
<p>ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>and therefore, there&rsquo;s extreme value</p>
<p>to knowing your ApoB levels.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try InsideTracker,</p>
<p>you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get 20% off any of InsideTracker&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s insidetracker.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get 20% off.</p>
<p>We covered the three major risk factors,</p>
<p>which were blood pressure, keeping that in check,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t smoke, and ApoB.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve now talked about the things to adjust ApoB levels.</p>
<p>We did not really talk about things to adjust blood pressure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming exercise sits as one of the foremost.</p>
<p>Exercise and nutrition, yeah.</p>
<p>Weight management is a huge one here.</p>
<p>So, you know, you take a person who&rsquo;s blood,</p>
<p>and this is one of those things where we don&rsquo;t immediately jump</p>
<p>on the pharmacotherapy train with blood pressure</p>
<p>because here there are side effects sometimes.</p>
<p>And you do have to worry about overshooting.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really have to worry</p>
<p>about overshooting a person&rsquo;s lipids.</p>
<p>We do back off if we overshoot,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t cause a symptom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a short-term immediate risk from doing that.</p>
<p>If you overshoot somebody&rsquo;s blood pressure medication,</p>
<p>you trade one problem for another problem.</p>
<p>They become lightheaded when they get up to pee at night.</p>
<p>They fall and bang their head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a devastating consequence, totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>So our goal is to see how much we can lower blood pressure</p>
<p>without medication before we turn to medication.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be clear,</p>
<p>the meds today are so much better than they used to be.</p>
<p>Again, there was a day when the side effects</p>
<p>of these medicines were miserable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply not the case today.</p>
<p>I mean, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,</p>
<p>I mean, these things are very well tolerated,</p>
<p>especially the ARBs.</p>
<p>So again, almost anybody can be on these things,</p>
<p>but if we could get a person to lose 10 pounds</p>
<p>and exercise every day,</p>
<p>we see great effects with zone two stuff, right?</p>
<p>So kind of the low intensity cardio.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your recommendation there?</p>
<p>I know you talk about this in the book,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve thrown out numbers about 150 to 180 minutes</p>
<p>per week, you go a bit higher.</p>
<p>Yeah, we go 180 to 250, 240.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d like to see three to four hours a week of zone two.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important piece and sleep is an important piece.</p>
<p>So get the sleep right, get the exercise right.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re overnourished, let&rsquo;s correct that problem.</p>
<p>And if all of that doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>and by the way, that works a lot of the time,</p>
<p>that works most of the time.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work, then we&rsquo;ve got pharmacotherapy.</p>
<p>There is still a true phenomenon of essential hypertension,</p>
<p>which is in individuals for whom</p>
<p>all the fixable stuff has been fixed</p>
<p>and they still have high blood pressure,</p>
<p>we still have to medicate those folks.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s something that I wanna mention here</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t get much attention, but it&rsquo;s so important,</p>
<p>which is the effect of high blood pressure on the kidney</p>
<p>and also the brain itself.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the brain, we&rsquo;ve talked about the heart,</p>
<p>but the kidney doesn&rsquo;t get enough attention.</p>
<p>The kidney is a remarkable organ.</p>
<p>And I think if you&rsquo;re really in this game</p>
<p>of trying to live longer, right?</p>
<p>If you think, hey, maybe we&rsquo;ll live 80, 85 years,</p>
<p>but if we kind of start doing all of these other things</p>
<p>and really optimizing our behaviors, that could be 95.</p>
<p>Well, you have to start thinking</p>
<p>about the capacity of the kidney.</p>
<p>And once the glomerular filtration rate</p>
<p>falls below a certain level,</p>
<p>you have to be very careful with how you live your life.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, this is one of those things</p>
<p>that is another sort of mistake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s made in kind of modern medicine,</p>
<p>which is we don&rsquo;t pay enough attention</p>
<p>to how to measure kidney function correctly.</p>
<p>We rely very heavily on something called creatinine,</p>
<p>as opposed to looking at another biomarker</p>
<p>called cystatin C, which is far more accurate.</p>
<p>And we also tolerate too low of a kidney function</p>
<p>for a person&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>So we might look at someone who&rsquo;s 50,</p>
<p>whose kidney function is at 65% and say, you&rsquo;re totally fine.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s true that at 65%, there is no problem.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not thinking,</p>
<p>well, if this person has to live another 40 years</p>
<p>and this continues to go down,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to potentially be staring down the barrel</p>
<p>of needing dialysis the last five years of their life.</p>
<p>Again, you want to die with compromised kidney function,</p>
<p>but never from compromised kidney function.</p>
<p>In fact, the hazard ratio of all-cause mortality</p>
<p>associated with compromised kidney function</p>
<p>is even greater than that of heart disease.</p>
<p>Once you cross that threshold, I mean, lights out.</p>
<p>Once you are needing dialysis,</p>
<p>I mean, your risk of death is higher</p>
<p>than that of someone with high blood pressure, smoking,</p>
<p>even someone who has cancer.</p>
<p>You have a higher risk of death</p>
<p>having end-stage renal disease than you do having cancer.</p>
<p>So the kidney is so sensitive to blood pressure.</p>
<p>This is a tiny organ that on every pump of your heart</p>
<p>is getting 20 to 25% of your blood.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So just imagine how sensitive and susceptible it is</p>
<p>to elevated blood pressure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered quite a few corners</p>
<p>of avoiding the major killer, arthrosclerosis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about cancer.</p>
<p>Nobody wants cancer.</p>
<p>Everybody seems to know somebody who has had</p>
<p>or has died of cancer and probably no surprise</p>
<p>given that it&rsquo;s number two on the list.</p>
<p>What are the numbers and what can people do to offset cancer?</p>
<p>And of course, there are a huge number</p>
<p>of different types of cancer.</p>
<p>And inside of this conversation, I just want to earmark</p>
<p>that it might be good to have a conversation about alcohol,</p>
<p>which we didn&rsquo;t talk about in the last discussion.</p>
<p>But if alcohol is involved or is a risk factor rather</p>
<p>for cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease,</p>
<p>now would probably be the time to mention it.</p>
<p>Yeah, this has been looked at in a number of ways.</p>
<p>And so if you look at sort of top-line epidemiology</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve heard of these things called the French paradox,</p>
<p>which is, oh, come on, like they eat all of this fatty stuff</p>
<p>and drink all this wine and they have a slightly lower risk</p>
<p>of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>You just have to kind of throw that stuff out the window</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many confounders there</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s kind of useless epidemiology.</p>
<p>If you really look at the data clearly,</p>
<p>and there was actually a really elegant analysis</p>
<p>that included some genetic studies</p>
<p>that came out in JAMA about a year ago,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually pretty clear that there is no dose</p>
<p>of ethanol that is healthy.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s no J curve.</p>
<p>So it used to be kind of this literature that said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a J curve associated with ethanol.</p>
<p>So meaning at total abstinence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a slightly higher risk of death</p>
<p>than if you&rsquo;re drinking one drink a day.</p>
<p>And then if you go beyond one drink a day,</p>
<p>the rate of death starts to climb.</p>
<p>The problem with that analysis,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s just been a lot of consternation around that.</p>
<p>But the problem with those analyses are multiple,</p>
<p>but the most important of these are that the abstainers</p>
<p>have a reason for abstaining typically.</p>
<p>And those reasons can&rsquo;t be extracted statistically</p>
<p>from these analyses.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll leave it at that without,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve written many blog posts about this.</p>
<p>If people are really interested,</p>
<p>they can go and talk about that.</p>
<p>I also do talk about this a little bit in the book,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>But the short answer is there is no dose of ethanol</p>
<p>that is healthy.</p>
<p>I would argue that it&rsquo;s not a straight line of risk,</p>
<p>but it probably goes,</p>
<p>I think from zero to one,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably no measurable harm for most people.</p>
<p>One per day or one per week?</p>
<p>Probably one per day, up to one per day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably very difficult to discern the harm,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna put a caveat on that that I&rsquo;ll come back to.</p>
<p>And then I think the risk starts to climb</p>
<p>pretty steeply after that.</p>
<p>And I think it climbs non-linearly after that.</p>
<p>That is my reading of the literature.</p>
<p>Okay, so then how do you decide</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna have up to one drink a day?</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s not the same as seven a week,</p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t mean seven in a day.</p>
<p>Right, which we know is really detrimental.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Especially for the brain,</p>
<p>but also the cascades that result from disrupted sleep,</p>
<p>not just for that one night, but multiple nights.</p>
<p>Yeah, the literature I&rsquo;ve seen on alcohol,</p>
<p>that the most, now again, this is an emerging literature</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re describing is exactly right.</p>
<p>But people are now, some more conservative folks</p>
<p>are starting to place it at two drinks per week total,</p>
<p>beyond which you start running into issues,</p>
<p>especially for women in terms of breast cancer risk,</p>
<p>which is something maybe we can circle back.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, my view is if you can not drink at all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better off not drinking at all.</p>
<p>And people always say to me,</p>
<p>well, Peter, what&rsquo;s your view on this?</p>
<p>And my view is I do drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go weeks at a time without having a drink.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a drink, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had one drink since I saw you last a couple of weeks ago</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been sick.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking, well, gosh,</p>
<p>like the deck is stacked against me right now.</p>
<p>Why would I do anything to stack in more?</p>
<p>But my philosophy, which is half tongue in cheek,</p>
<p>but is true is like, I just don&rsquo;t drink bad alcohol.</p>
<p>You know, I sort of, my wife saw me do this the other day.</p>
<p>We opened up a bottle of wine</p>
<p>and it was a very expensive bottle of wine.</p>
<p>And I took a sip and I was like, yeah,</p>
<p>I just dumped my glass.</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t know, just doesn&rsquo;t taste right to me.</p>
<p>And it tasted fine to her.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it was that the wine had spoiled.</p>
<p>It was just, I didn&rsquo;t like the taste of it enough</p>
<p>to justify drinking it.</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t feel like drinking it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate.</p>
<p>There were times in life, you know,</p>
<p>certainly college and portions of graduate school</p>
<p>when I drank, but I&rsquo;ve never really enjoyed</p>
<p>the taste or experience of alcohol.</p>
<p>So all the alcohol in the planet could disappear.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even notice,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll have one every once in a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of of that mindset,</p>
<p>but great to hear that zero is better than any.</p>
<p>Because I think everyone agrees on that.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t appear that alcohol can be directly linked</p>
<p>to cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<p>Although, well, these indirect effects through insulin,</p>
<p>altering insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>And through sleep.</p>
<p>And through sleep.</p>
<p>I think the impact of sleep on cardiovascular</p>
<p>and cerebrovascular disease is profound.</p>
<p>And I do think that the impact of ethanol</p>
<p>on sleep is underappreciated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think we should do a little nod to Matt Walker,</p>
<p>the great Matt Walker.</p>
<p>Because, you know, 10 years ago,</p>
<p>if someone had a conversation about sleep</p>
<p>and how critical it is</p>
<p>and how not getting enough quality sleep is dangerous,</p>
<p>people would have just kind of shake their heads</p>
<p>and say, what&rsquo;s the evidence for that?</p>
<p>I think Matt really deserves most of the credit</p>
<p>for alerting people to these issues</p>
<p>around not getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just remarkable what&rsquo;s happened in the last decade.</p>
<p>Thanks to Matt.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re on that topic,</p>
<p>we have the other next horseman of death,</p>
<p>the neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>I think those are also heavily impacted,</p>
<p>especially on the dementia side by ethanol.</p>
<p>So again, I wanna be careful when I say this stuff, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in fear mongering, okay?</p>
<p>I just said a moment ago, I&rsquo;ll say it again.</p>
<p>I drink alcohol and I&rsquo;m gonna continue to drink alcohol.</p>
<p>But I think that one has to make the trade-offs,</p>
<p>which is like, if I really do love the taste</p>
<p>of certain Spanish wines,</p>
<p>I really do love the taste of certain tequilas,</p>
<p>certain mezcals, and I really do love the taste</p>
<p>of certain weird esoteric Belgian beers.</p>
<p>And it really does give me pleasure to consume those things</p>
<p>in the same way it gives me pleasure</p>
<p>to consume certain foods that are quite vapid, right?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s no upside in consuming a brownie</p>
<p>that my kid just made,</p>
<p>except for the fact that my kid just made it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fun to eat the brownie with them, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, we come back to this thing about like,</p>
<p>longevity is also about healthspan.</p>
<p>And part of healthspan is quality of life.</p>
<p>And, you know, I write about this in the book</p>
<p>that I think there was a day when my approach to this</p>
<p>was purely an engineering approach,</p>
<p>which was we are going to optimize</p>
<p>every molecule of my being for this.</p>
<p>And if you go so far down that rabbit hole</p>
<p>that the quality of your life deteriorates,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think for somebody like you,</p>
<p>who says like, you could take all the alcohol</p>
<p>off the face of the earth, I wouldn&rsquo;t even notice,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a great reason not to bother drinking.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put myself at the opposite end of that spectrum,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m probably further to the spectrum, you know,</p>
<p>where, yeah, if you told me</p>
<p>I could never drink alcohol again,</p>
<p>I would be fine with it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be giving something up that I enjoy.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I know if I have two drinks</p>
<p>with dinner, my sleep sucks.</p>
<p>And therefore, that&rsquo;s just a threshold I rarely,</p>
<p>rarely cross.</p>
<p>I certainly have my vices.</p>
<p>Alcohol just doesn&rsquo;t happen to be one of them.</p>
<p>What about cancer?</p>
<p>Again, nobody wants cancer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all known people who&rsquo;ve died of cancer</p>
<p>or have had cancer.</p>
<p>What can be done to reduce one&rsquo;s risk of cancer?</p>
<p>Well, you asked earlier about the numbers,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s throw some numbers out there, right?</p>
<p>So globally, we&rsquo;re talking about 11,</p>
<p>12 million deaths per year,</p>
<p>about half the number of ASCVD,</p>
<p>still a staggering number.</p>
<p>At the individual level, put it this way,</p>
<p>somewhere between one in three and one in four chance,</p>
<p>anyone listening to this or watching this</p>
<p>is gonna get cancer in their lifetime.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the probability they will die from that cancer?</p>
<p>Half of that, about a one in six chance of dying.</p>
<p>Okay, so is it true that every male gets prostate cancer?</p>
<p>In other words, on their deathbed-</p>
<p>Every man will die with prostate cancer</p>
<p>and some will die from it.</p>
<p>You and I have prostate cancer right now.</p>
<p>Thank you for informing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will not die of it.</p>
<p>We should not die of it.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer, colon cancer are cancers</p>
<p>that no one should ever die from</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so easy to screen for.</p>
<p>They are so easy to treat when they are in their infancy</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s totally unacceptable</p>
<p>that people are dying from this.</p>
<p>There are other cancers for which I can&rsquo;t really say that.</p>
<p>Breast cancer, much more complicated.</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer, much more complicated.</p>
<p>Glioblastomae multiforme, much more complicated.</p>
<p>So as you said a second ago, cancer is not a disease.</p>
<p>It is a category of diseases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that each organ is different</p>
<p>and breast differs from pancreatic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that within breast cancer, ERPR positive,</p>
<p>HER2-neu positive is a totally different disease</p>
<p>from the triple negative breast cancers.</p>
<p>Those with BRCA mutations or non-BRCA mutations.</p>
<p>Well, even putting that aside,</p>
<p>just looking at the hormone profile</p>
<p>of the individual breast cancers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re totally different diseases.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that breast cancer</p>
<p>is different from prostate cancer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that all breast cancers are quite different.</p>
<p>Maybe I should frame the question a little differently</p>
<p>than given the vast number of different types of cancers</p>
<p>and categories within those.</p>
<p>Your question is still a fair one.</p>
<p>I just wanted to throw that caveat out there.</p>
<p>So now to your question.</p>
<p>Okay, so what do we know?</p>
<p>It turns out that we can very comfortably speak</p>
<p>to several things.</p>
<p>One is the role that genes play.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;ll just spend one second</p>
<p>on a gene 101 thing for the viewer.</p>
<p>We wanna differentiate between</p>
<p>what are called germline mutations and somatic mutations.</p>
<p>So your germline and my germline are set.</p>
<p>When we were born, our germline mutations,</p>
<p>any mutations we have in germline genes</p>
<p>are inherited from our parents.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re non-negotiable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re non-negotiable.</p>
<p>You got those things.</p>
<p>So question one is how much of cancer results</p>
<p>from those types of genetic mutations?</p>
<p>And the answer is very little, less than 5%.</p>
<p>So very, you know, you mentioned one a moment ago, BRCA.</p>
<p>Okay, so mutations in BRCA are germline mutations.</p>
<p>A woman will get a BRCA mutation from one of her parents.</p>
<p>And we will often have a sense of that</p>
<p>just from the family history.</p>
<p>You know, when mom and sister and aunt and grandmother</p>
<p>had breast cancer, you&rsquo;ve got a breast cancer gene.</p>
<p>Now it might be BRCA.</p>
<p>It might be another gene that&rsquo;s not BRCA,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no ambiguity.</p>
<p>And we test for these genes</p>
<p>mostly just for insurance purposes, frankly,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no ambiguity</p>
<p>that that was a germline transmission of a gene</p>
<p>that is driving cancer.</p>
<p>But 95 plus percent of cancers</p>
<p>are not arising from germline mutations.</p>
<p>They are arising from somatic mutations</p>
<p>or acquired mutations.</p>
<p>So the question then becomes</p>
<p>what is driving somatic mutation?</p>
<p>And the two clearest indications</p>
<p>of drivers of somatic mutation</p>
<p>are smoking and obesity.</p>
<p>Smoking we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put that aside for a moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so surprised about obesity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m surprised,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never heard this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably just naive to the literature.</p>
<p>Yeah, so obesity is now the second</p>
<p>most prevalent environmental driver of cancer.</p>
<p>Now, I will argue,</p>
<p>and I think I argue this in the book,</p>
<p>hopefully pretty convincingly,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s obesity per se.</p>
<p>Obesity is just a masquerading proxy.</p>
<p>What is obesity?</p>
<p>Obesity simply is defined by body mass index.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m obese,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m way overweight on BMI.</p>
<p>You probably are too.</p>
<p>So, you know, let&rsquo;s just ignore it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m clinically diagnosable as obese.</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>Oh, no, well, not, well, clinically, maybe as-</p>
<p>That would be BMI over 30.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re probably there.</p>
<p>No, but if I measure my weight by height-</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like my BMI is probably 27 or 28.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s been a little while since I&rsquo;ve checked.</p>
<p>I only know body fat percentages and things like that.</p>
<p>So, basically, like BMI is a far from perfect proxy,</p>
<p>but at the population level, it&rsquo;s what we use.</p>
<p>I wish we would get off it, by the way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really crap.</p>
<p>Because it doesn&rsquo;t take into account</p>
<p>lean versus non-lean tissue.</p>
<p>I think we could get better data</p>
<p>if we looked at waist to height ratio.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a way better metric.</p>
<p>So, this is just a quick test for everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna argue your BMI is less relevant to me</p>
<p>than your eye color.</p>
<p>But if your waist circumference</p>
<p>is more than 50% of your height, you should be concerned.</p>
<p>Okay, well, then I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re fine by that metric, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re six feet tall,</p>
<p>your waist better be under 36 inches.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s over, I would argue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the definition of obesity,</p>
<p>not your BMI being over 30.</p>
<p>So, back to this issue,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re using such a crude measurement,</p>
<p>it basically is catching a whole bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>But the question is, what&rsquo;s driving it?</p>
<p>And I think if you really look at the physiology of cancer,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s obesity.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s two things that come with obesity.</p>
<p>Insulin resistance, which is, you know,</p>
<p>two thirds to three quarters of obese individuals</p>
<p>are insulin resistant, and inflammation.</p>
<p>And I think those two things,</p>
<p>with the inflammation and the immune dysfunction,</p>
<p>with the insulin resistance,</p>
<p>and the hyper, basically,</p>
<p>tonic growth stimulus that&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving cancer.</p>
<p>So again, is it because a person is storing extra fat,</p>
<p>you know, and their love handles,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s driving the risk of cancer?</p>
<p>No, those are just two things</p>
<p>that are coming along for the ride.</p>
<p>So, beyond those two things,</p>
<p>and along with certain,</p>
<p>there are also certain environmental toxins</p>
<p>we absolutely know are doing this, right?</p>
<p>So we understand that people who, you know,</p>
<p>have exposure to asbestos have a much higher risk</p>
<p>of certain types of lung cancers and things like that.</p>
<p>But for the most part, those are our big risks.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we talk about alcohol in certain cases,</p>
<p>absolutely, alcohol is a carcinogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the dose part still isn&rsquo;t clear to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, is one drink a day</p>
<p>moving the needle much on cancer risk per se?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p>And it might depend on those genetic predispositions.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, yeah, if step one is don&rsquo;t get cancer,</p>
<p>you have no control over your genes,</p>
<p>you have control over smoking,</p>
<p>you have control over insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>I wish I could sit here and tell you</p>
<p>that there is a proven anti-cancer diet,</p>
<p>or that if you do X amount of exercise per week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna not get cancer.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t have a fraction of the control</p>
<p>over cancer that we have with cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand the disease well enough.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t understand kind of the initiation process</p>
<p>and the propagation process.</p>
<p>And we have to rely much more on screening.</p>
<p>Are there good whole body screens for cancer?</p>
<p>In other words, can I walk into a tube</p>
<p>and or a cylinder rather,</p>
<p>and get screened for the presence of tumors</p>
<p>any and everywhere in the body outside the brain?</p>
<p>Because the brain is a little harder to get to, right?</p>
<p>Believe it or not,</p>
<p>the brain is actually pretty easy to screen for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fatty and floating in water.</p>
<p>Well, and also the head,</p>
<p>when you put the head into an MRI scanner,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the least motion artifact is in the brain.</p>
<p>So when you use something called diffusion-weighted imaging</p>
<p>with background subtraction in an MRI,</p>
<p>a technology that was actually pioneered in the brain</p>
<p>for stroke identification,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also really good at looking for tumors as well.</p>
<p>So let me make the argument for why screening matters.</p>
<p>Because this is again,</p>
<p>kind of an area where I go far down a rabbit hole</p>
<p>in a way that I think traditional medicine</p>
<p>would argue against.</p>
<p>So my argument for screening</p>
<p>is an argument at the individual level.</p>
<p>And it goes as follows.</p>
<p>To my knowledge,</p>
<p>there is not a single example of a cancer</p>
<p>that is more effectively treated</p>
<p>when the burden of cancer cells in the body</p>
<p>is higher than when it is lower.</p>
<p>So the two examples I think I talk about in the book</p>
<p>are colon cancer and breast cancer.</p>
<p>So when you take an individual with stage four colon cancer,</p>
<p>that means that the cancer has left the colon</p>
<p>and is now outside of the colon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s usually in the liver at a minimum,</p>
<p>potentially in the lungs or in the brain.</p>
<p>That person&rsquo;s five-year survival is very low.</p>
<p>Their 10-year survival is zero.</p>
<p>We will treat them with a very aggressive regimen</p>
<p>of multiple drugs.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;ll get a five-year survival</p>
<p>of maybe 10 to 20%.</p>
<p>And by 10 years, nobody&rsquo;s alive.</p>
<p>If you take a person with stage three colon cancer,</p>
<p>so the colon cancer is big</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s even in the lymph nodes around the colon,</p>
<p>but at least grossly,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see colon cancer cell,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see those cells in the liver.</p>
<p>Microscopically, of course, we know they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t treat those patients,</p>
<p>they still die of colon cancer,</p>
<p>but you whack them with the same chemo regimen</p>
<p>that you were gonna give the metastatic patients,</p>
<p>80% of those people are alive in five years.</p>
<p>So night and day difference in survival.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>In the person with metastatic cancer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re treating a person with hundreds of billions of cells</p>
<p>in the adjuvant setting,</p>
<p>which is what we call it adjuvant</p>
<p>when you treat people who have only microscopic disease,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re treating billions of cells.</p>
<p>The same is true with breast cancer.</p>
<p>So we have the clinical trial data to put them side by side.</p>
<p>So rule number one is don&rsquo;t get cancer.</p>
<p>Rule number two is catch cancer as early as possible</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna get it,</p>
<p>which brings us to your question of how do you screen for it?</p>
<p>The first line of screening is imaging,</p>
<p>is a sort of visualization.</p>
<p>So you have cancers that occur outside the body</p>
<p>that you can look at directly.</p>
<p>So skin cancer, you can look directly at the skin.</p>
<p>Esophageal, gastric, colon cancer,</p>
<p>those are outside the body, right?</p>
<p>Mouth to anus embryologically is outside the body.</p>
<p>So you can put a scope in</p>
<p>and you can look directly at the cancer.</p>
<p>But for all other cancers that are inside the body,</p>
<p>yeah, you have to rely on some sort of imaging modality.</p>
<p>Although now we&rsquo;re starting to look at things,</p>
<p>things called liquid biopsies.</p>
<p>So blood tests that are looking for cell-free DNA.</p>
<p>And the cell-free DNA gives us a sense of,</p>
<p>based on the epigenetic signature</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>hey, is there a cancer in the body?</p>
<p>And if so, what tissue is it potentially coming from</p>
<p>based on these epigenetic signatures?</p>
<p>So the problem with relying on any one modality</p>
<p>is a problem of sensitivity and specificity optimization.</p>
<p>Now with MRI scanners,</p>
<p>which are in some ways the best way to do this</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have radiation.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t wanna be incurring damage as you do this.</p>
<p>The irony of doing a whole body CT scan</p>
<p>to screen for cancer is your whole body CT scan</p>
<p>would be close to 30 to 50 millisieverts of radiation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a staggering sum of radiation.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Does that mean that people should,</p>
<p>sorry to pull you off this,</p>
<p>but I was going to ask about this anyway,</p>
<p>avoiding going through the whole body scanner</p>
<p>at the airport.</p>
<p>Noise, so low, so low.</p>
<p>Yeah, going through a whole body scanner at the airport</p>
<p>or even getting a DEXA scan.</p>
<p>I mean, these are trivial amounts of radiation.</p>
<p>What about flying?</p>
<p>You hear that pilots get more cancer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a pilot who&rsquo;s flying over the North Pole</p>
<p>back and forth and back and forth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably getting five to 10 millisieverts a year.</p>
<p>The NRC suggests that nobody should get</p>
<p>more than 50 millisieverts a year.</p>
<p>So you and I both travel a fair amount,</p>
<p>but typical travel for the busy person,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say two round trip flights</p>
<p>of more than two hours per month</p>
<p>and an international trip every three months.</p>
<p>Probably still less than a millisievert a year.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Living at sea level, one millisievert a year.</p>
<p>Living at a mile elevation,</p>
<p>if you lived in Denver,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at two millisieverts a year basically.</p>
<p>I have to ask, standing in front of the microwave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, we&rsquo;ve got friends.</p>
<p>They ask.</p>
<p>With or without testes on the counter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an inside joke that unfortunately,</p>
<p>and fortunately deserves no description.</p>
<p>And Peter&rsquo;s not referring to me.</p>
<p>But people worry about other sources of radiation.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t sound like the microwave is a concern.</p>
<p>What are the other major sources of radiation?</p>
<p>I mean, outside of sort of nuclear stuff</p>
<p>where things go sadly wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you live near a plant</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s been a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s been a&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly at the hands of medical professionals, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the CT scanner and the PET scanner</p>
<p>are hands down the biggest source of radiation.</p>
<p>What about the x-rays at the dentist</p>
<p>when they go&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very low.</p>
<p>When they scurry behind the wall</p>
<p>under the lead blanket.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very low, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>Fluoroscopy is very high.</p>
<p>They tend to try to cover up all of you that&hellip;</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>if they were doing a fluoroscopic study of your kidney</p>
<p>because you had a stone</p>
<p>or if you were getting an injection into&hellip;</p>
<p>If they were doing a fluoroscopic guided injection</p>
<p>of one of your discs in your neck,</p>
<p>that would be a locally pretty high dose,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re gonna cover the hell out of you elsewhere.</p>
<p>And again, if you get one of these things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the end of the world,</p>
<p>but boy, I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna be getting one a month.</p>
<p>And back to the point about screening,</p>
<p>a chest, abdomen, pelvis CT scan is probably&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, look, there&rsquo;s probably a scanner out there now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s moving fast enough that it&rsquo;s much lower,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>Okay, remember how I talked about we do CT angiograms</p>
<p>on all of our patients for coronary artery disease?</p>
<p>An off-the-shelf scanner for this</p>
<p>is 20 millisieverts of radiation.</p>
<p>Okay, so calibrate me because-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 40% of your annual allotment.</p>
<p>Oh wow, so the medical practitioners</p>
<p>really are the major culprits here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, so what we say is,</p>
<p>and I think most doctors are now realizing this,</p>
<p>is no, no, it behooves you to pay a little bit more</p>
<p>to go to a really good place</p>
<p>that can do that scan for two millisieverts,</p>
<p>meaning they have a much faster CT scanner,</p>
<p>much better software, and they&rsquo;re better engineers.</p>
<p>So they have better engineering</p>
<p>that they can do on the scanner to get that done.</p>
<p>So if someone listening to this, here&rsquo;s my take.</p>
<p>Do not get a CT scan or any imaging study</p>
<p>without asking, how much radiation am I seeing?</p>
<p>And if a person can&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>how many millisieverts of radiation you&rsquo;re being exposed to,</p>
<p>then just say, I&rsquo;m gonna wait a minute</p>
<p>until somebody can tell me that.</p>
<p>I realize-</p>
<p>And keep in mind, if 50 is the most</p>
<p>you should ever be exposed to in a year,</p>
<p>there better be a damn good reason</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m gonna get 25 in a day.</p>
<p>Now, there are some people who have to do this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a cancer patient</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re scanning you as a part of your treatment,</p>
<p>I mean, you have to pick and choose</p>
<p>between those two opportunities.</p>
<p>So I also don&rsquo;t wanna create some fear-mongering</p>
<p>where, oh my God, if you hit 50 in a year, you&rsquo;re hosed.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just, I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna hit 50 a year</p>
<p>every year for my whole life.</p>
<p>And I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t wanna be hitting hundreds a year</p>
<p>for any period of time.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re just trying to raise awareness</p>
<p>and also calibrate people to what the sources are</p>
<p>and so they can make good choices,</p>
<p>not to place them into a chronic state of fear</p>
<p>or even an acute state of fear.</p>
<p>So for that reason, we prefer MRI scanners</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no radiation.</p>
<p>I realize this might sound like a specialized circumstance,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just start off with my own,</p>
<p>which is when I was a graduate student,</p>
<p>I worked with fixatives, so paraformaldehyde.</p>
<p>Paraformaldehyde, excuse me.</p>
<p>Glutaraldehyde, we know that these are mutagens.</p>
<p>They mutate cells, not good.</p>
<p>You do some molecular biology in the lab,</p>
<p>you use DNA intercalating dye,</p>
<p>those little bands and gels,</p>
<p>the reason they label is because they get between the DNA,</p>
<p>not good to get into your own DNA.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very specialized circumstance.</p>
<p>I also injected tritiate radioactive proline</p>
<p>into the animals and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Again, very specialized.</p>
<p>And yet, most people, I think,</p>
<p>will be exposed to pesticides.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll put stuff on their lawn</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll have paint thinners and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Is there any sense of what the average, if one can,</p>
<p>average risk is incurred in terms of carcinogens</p>
<p>just through this interaction with weed killers,</p>
<p>paint thinner, detergents around the house</p>
<p>that we now know, there&rsquo;s some major lawsuits</p>
<p>that have been successful</p>
<p>against the manufacturers of these things.</p>
<p>And what is the real cancer risk created</p>
<p>by having those kinds of solvents</p>
<p>and pesticides and things around?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I know, truthfully.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very complicated to calculate such things</p>
<p>when their ubiquity is so high.</p>
<p>So one argument is, look, it&rsquo;s kind of baked</p>
<p>into the baseline prevalence of cancer today</p>
<p>because these things are so ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Yeah, asbestos, in California, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>it seems that there&rsquo;s an asbestos warning</p>
<p>on pretty much every building, if you look carefully enough,</p>
<p>except maybe the ones built in the last five years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever worked in a building</p>
<p>where the elevator was updated in terms of the inspection.</p>
<p>It was almost like 10 years back.</p>
<p>You always see it while you&rsquo;re in the elevator.</p>
<p>No one seems to worry about those.</p>
<p>Or where there was not an asbestos warning</p>
<p>or a lead warning.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s just kind of everywhere</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re noting it in these little flags.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t walk around worried about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t lose sleep over it.</p>
<p>But it sounds like a real risk</p>
<p>or else they wouldn&rsquo;t bother, right?</p>
<p>Clearly, they&rsquo;re just trying to cover their legal backs.</p>
<p>Yeah, it might be more CYA than anything at this point.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how much of a risk asbestos poses</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not being agitated.</p>
<p>In other words, I don&rsquo;t know that the asbestos</p>
<p>in the ceiling, four layers up, is really a problem.</p>
<p>But if they had to come in here and rip this ceiling apart,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d want to be in here either.</p>
<p>Right, it was like post 9-11,</p>
<p>a lot of the workers on the World Trade Center pits,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what was left, sadly,</p>
<p>were developed cancers, right?</p>
<p>Probably from exposure to those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I would argue it&rsquo;s also just the unbelievable</p>
<p>amount of pollution, micropollution,</p>
<p>that was in the air following those things.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s devastating stuff.</p>
<p>So yeah, those are fortunately the outlier events</p>
<p>that are dramatic.</p>
<p>But again, my focus is basically,</p>
<p>look, I could hermetically seal myself</p>
<p>somewhere in the world, maybe,</p>
<p>and maybe that would reduce my risk by 1%.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna focus my energy on what I control,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really hard for me to control.</p>
<p>I like focusing my things on,</p>
<p>I like focusing my energy on things I can control.</p>
<p>What I can control is the timing</p>
<p>and frequency of my screening.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t control my genes anymore.</p>
<p>They are what they are.</p>
<p>I got whatever predisposing cancer genes I&rsquo;m gonna get.</p>
<p>I might be lucky in this regard,</p>
<p>in that I seem to get all these horrible heart disease genes,</p>
<p>and maybe not as much.</p>
<p>But you can also argue,</p>
<p>there are cancer bad genes in me</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t really know about,</p>
<p>because everybody was dying of heart disease so young.</p>
<p>But boy, am I gonna control the screening thing.</p>
<p>What source of genetic screening</p>
<p>do you recommend to your patients?</p>
<p>Because there are a lot of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 23andMe, there&rsquo;s whole genome sequencing,</p>
<p>plays, you know, available now in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>This is actually one of the questions</p>
<p>our research team is working on as we speak.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to decide,</p>
<p>so we do genetic screening for certain things,</p>
<p>like ApoE is a gene we wanna know in everybody.</p>
<p>For its role in neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>Correct, specifically in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>We are selectively using cancer screening in some patients,</p>
<p>but in our practice, it&rsquo;s less important</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re generally so aggressive anyway</p>
<p>that it turns out to be a little bit moot.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t learn a lot in the genetic screening</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s changing our screening practices,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so thorough in our family history,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re so aggressive in everybody,</p>
<p>regardless of family history.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a place for these things.</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re looking for reimbursement</p>
<p>on certain tests, you know, I&rsquo;ll give you an example, right?</p>
<p>So colon cancer historically was not covered by,</p>
<p>colonoscopy screening for colon cancer</p>
<p>was not covered until you were 50.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been bumped to 45.</p>
<p>We still think everybody should be screened</p>
<p>no later than 40.</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t had one, so I suppose I should.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I&rsquo;m 50 and I&rsquo;ve had three already.</p>
<p>So again, why?</p>
<p>Because colon cancer is not just the third leading cause</p>
<p>of cancer death, it&rsquo;s 100% preventable.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because every colon cancer comes from a polyp,</p>
<p>and every polyp can be seen on a colonoscopy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s simply no reason to not know that.</p>
<p>And that has to be weighed against the cost</p>
<p>of the colonoscopy, both the financial cost and the risks,</p>
<p>which are very low, but not zero.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a risk that comes from electrolyte abnormalities</p>
<p>and hypotension from the bowel prep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a risk from the sedation,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s obviously a risk of bleeding or perforation</p>
<p>that comes from the colonoscopy itself.</p>
<p>Again, in a generally healthy person,</p>
<p>those risks are so low that they&rsquo;re almost difficult</p>
<p>to quantify, as evidenced by a recent</p>
<p>New England Journal of Medicine paper</p>
<p>that was a very anti-colonoscopy paper,</p>
<p>which I won&rsquo;t get into</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s probably a little bit of a tangent.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is,</p>
<p>despite being a very anti-colonoscopy paper,</p>
<p>this paper does a better job demonstrating</p>
<p>the safety of colonoscopy than anything else.</p>
<p>It just was an oddly designed experiment.</p>
<p>So the biggest challenge with aggressive screening posture</p>
<p>is the specificity problem,</p>
<p>which is when you stack more and more modalities</p>
<p>around these things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna start finding things that aren&rsquo;t cancer.</p>
<p>So MRI has a very high sensitivity.</p>
<p>In English, that just means if a cancer is present,</p>
<p>an MRI is very likely to see it.</p>
<p>But it has a very low specificity,</p>
<p>which means in English, it will see a bunch of things</p>
<p>and think they are cancer when they are not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s most troubled by glandular tissue.</p>
<p>So glandular tissue is the Achilles heel of MRI.</p>
<p>And therefore, when you use, as we do,</p>
<p>whole body MRI for cancer screening,</p>
<p>we tell our patients going in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a 25% chance we&rsquo;re gonna find something</p>
<p>that is not cancer,</p>
<p>but will require us to do further investigation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not cool with that, which is totally fine,</p>
<p>we probably shouldn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>And again, most people are okay with that,</p>
<p>but it helps to set that expectation going in,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna probably be chasing your tail,</p>
<p>looking at some stupid thyroid nodule</p>
<p>that is absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t tell you how many useless thyroid nodules</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had to get ultrasounds on</p>
<p>that proved to be absolutely nothing,</p>
<p>but you have to follow them for a couple of years</p>
<p>to make sure they&rsquo;re nothing.</p>
<p>What is the typical cost of a whole body MRI?</p>
<p>And so for people who are not your patients,</p>
<p>how would they go about getting those?</p>
<p>Because I think most people&rsquo;s general practitioner</p>
<p>is not going to script that out for them.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the short answer</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know how many different places are doing it.</p>
<p>I can tell you that we use a couple of different facilities</p>
<p>and I should disclose that I&rsquo;m a founder of one of them,</p>
<p>but we use a scanner that probably,</p>
<p>we send our patients to anywhere they wanna go,</p>
<p>but within a certain company that we like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a company I have an affiliation with,</p>
<p>and I believe they&rsquo;re charging about $2,500.</p>
<p>Since you don&rsquo;t have an affiliation, can you mention that?</p>
<p>Because for instance, you are not my physician,</p>
<p>sadly for me, and luckily for you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to get a whole body MRI.</p>
<p>So what is this company?</p>
<p>So the company that makes the MRI</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re using right now is called Prenuvo.</p>
<p>I interviewed the chief technology officer</p>
<p>and the head radiologist of that company</p>
<p>on one of my podcasts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a super interesting technology based out of Vancouver.</p>
<p>And for a long time, that was the only scanner in the world.</p>
<p>So I had my first scan back in 2015.</p>
<p>I went up to Vancouver to get it done.</p>
<p>Probably had my first two up there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve now opened locations all over the country.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got one in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve probably got one here in LA.</p>
<p>I know they have one in Dallas.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got them all over the place.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And then the company that I&rsquo;m affiliated with</p>
<p>is a different type of company</p>
<p>that does all sorts of diagnostics,</p>
<p>but among them is we have a Prenuvo scanner in that company.</p>
<p>That company is called Biograph, and that&rsquo;s in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Biograph. Biograph, yeah.</p>
<p>Spelled as one would expect.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s very helpful in terms of understanding</p>
<p>the general risk and ways to offset cancer</p>
<p>to the extent that one can.</p>
<p>And certainly what the consideration should be.</p>
<p>Number three on the list of ways to die.</p>
<p>We should just title this ways to die,</p>
<p>or we should title this how not to die.</p>
<p>Too early.</p>
<p>Neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>This is an area I&rsquo;m somewhat familiar with.</p>
<p>Not because of my own experience, thankfully,</p>
<p>but because of my relationship</p>
<p>to the neuroscience community.</p>
<p>And last time I checked,</p>
<p>I was told that everyone experiences</p>
<p>some age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>So we all get less proficient at focus, memory,</p>
<p>complex context-dependent task switching,</p>
<p>all that stuff as we get older.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the slope of that line</p>
<p>that really can be controlled to some extent.</p>
<p>And that Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia represents</p>
<p>just a steep acceleration,</p>
<p>downward acceleration of all of that.</p>
<p>That was what I was told.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that even though I reside in the,</p>
<p>not kind of, but I reside in that community,</p>
<p>that some of that is being revised,</p>
<p>especially with respect to the underlying causes</p>
<p>of Alzheimer&rsquo;s, because there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy,</p>
<p>even scandal around this whole APP, APOB,</p>
<p>amyloid, plaque, tangle stuff,</p>
<p>which is the stuff of textbooks for medical students</p>
<p>and neuroscience students.</p>
<p>What is the story with neurodegenerative disease,</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s in particular?</p>
<p>How can we offset it?</p>
<p>And perhaps as importantly,</p>
<p>how can we all slow our own cognitive decline</p>
<p>irrespective of whether or not we get</p>
<p>what is called Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia?</p>
<p>So Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is both the most prevalent</p>
<p>form of dementia</p>
<p>and the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>So it occupies that unique spot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about roughly 6 million people</p>
<p>in the United States have Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one in, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t checked it out.</p>
<p>About 2% of the total population.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t include those</p>
<p>with mild cognitive impairment or pre-dementia</p>
<p>or other forms of dementia.</p>
<p>And of course the right metric is not what percent</p>
<p>of the population, which of course includes children,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, so-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a function of age.</p>
<p>Yeah, so-</p>
<p>But is age the major risk factor</p>
<p>for getting Alzheimer&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Let me say with glaucoma,</p>
<p>a disease I&rsquo;m much more familiar with</p>
<p>because my lab worked on it for many years.</p>
<p>The biggest risk factor for getting glaucoma is age.</p>
<p>Yeah, the greatest risk factor</p>
<p>for cardiovascular disease is age.</p>
<p>The greatest risk factor for cancer is age.</p>
<p>We tend to not spend a lot of time talking about that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not a modifiable risk.</p>
<p>So, you know, we tend to focus on modifiable risk factors.</p>
<p>So what else can we tell you</p>
<p>just to give you kind of lay of the land?</p>
<p>So the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease</p>
<p>would probably be Lewy body dementia</p>
<p>followed by Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>Although the rate of growth</p>
<p>of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is the highest.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;d probably be most, you know,</p>
<p>those three diseases</p>
<p>we wanna really be paying a lot of attention to.</p>
<p>As you know,</p>
<p>there are a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Every one of these things is devastating, like-</p>
<p>Multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Yeah, multiple sclerosis, ALS, Huntington&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>These are awful, awful diseases.</p>
<p>There are also other kinds of dementia.</p>
<p>Vascular dementia is not Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia,</p>
<p>but it produces comparable symptoms.</p>
<p>Each of these things, by the way, are slightly different.</p>
<p>Lewy body is a dementia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dementing disease,</p>
<p>but it also has a movement component.</p>
<p>So it sort of sits on a spectrum that&rsquo;s sort of, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, loosely halfway between Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>We talked obviously about age</p>
<p>being the number one risk factor,</p>
<p>kind of not that interesting</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>So the real goal is as we age,</p>
<p>what are we doing to reduce risk?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start with an important gene.</p>
<p>The gene that everybody&rsquo;s heard of,</p>
<p>certainly came up a lot on the Limitless special</p>
<p>where Chris Hemsworth was, you know,</p>
<p>made the decision to reveal something</p>
<p>that none of us expected when we started that whole series,</p>
<p>which was that he ended up being homozygous</p>
<p>for the APOE4 isoform.</p>
<p>So maybe folks understand we have two copies of every gene.</p>
<p>So for gene X, you have copy that you got from your mom</p>
<p>and copy that you got from your dad.</p>
<p>And the APOE gene is kind of a unique gene</p>
<p>in that it has three different isoforms</p>
<p>that are all considered normal.</p>
<p>None of them are mutations.</p>
<p>So you have the E2 isoform, the E3 isoform,</p>
<p>and the E4 isoform.</p>
<p>The E4 isoform is the OG isoform.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that we have historically had</p>
<p>as far back as we can go.</p>
<p>We actually think the E4 isoform</p>
<p>offered a lot of advantages back in the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a pro-inflammatory isoform</p>
<p>and it certainly offered protection against infections,</p>
<p>especially parasitic infections in the CNS,</p>
<p>which would have been a really important thing</p>
<p>to select for 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>How do parasites get into the CNS?</p>
<p>I mean, you got a blood-brain barrier, you got a thick skull.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>Trauma.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling you you have a thick skull,</p>
<p>but I mean, it just seems like parasites</p>
<p>in other tissues would be an issue</p>
<p>because what we&rsquo;re talking about here is brain disease.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to take us off course.</p>
<p>But it also could have protected them.</p>
<p>It probably offered some protection</p>
<p>outside of the brain as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, the E3 isoform, I think, showed up,</p>
<p>God, I think 50,000 years ago,</p>
<p>and the E2 isoform showed up very recently,</p>
<p>about 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Now, today, we realize that there&rsquo;s a clear stratification</p>
<p>of risk when it comes to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>that tracks with those isoforms.</p>
<p>So because you have two copies,</p>
<p>you basically have six combinations</p>
<p>of how you can combine those genes.</p>
<p>You could be 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, 3-4, 4-4.</p>
<p>The prevalence of them is basically as follows.</p>
<p>3-3 is now the most common, 3 is the most common.</p>
<p>So double 3 is 55-ish percent of the population.</p>
<p>The next most common is the 3-4,</p>
<p>which is about 25% of the population.</p>
<p>And then after that,</p>
<p>most things are kind of a rounding error.</p>
<p>So 2-3s and 2-4s would be the next most common.</p>
<p>4-4s are very rare.</p>
<p>And 2-2s are the rarest of them all.</p>
<p>2-2s are less than 1%.</p>
<p>4-4s are about one to two percent.</p>
<p>Very important point here</p>
<p>is that the E4 genes are not deterministic.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re highly associated with the risk,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not deterministic.</p>
<p>There are at least three deterministic genes</p>
<p>in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>One is called PSEN1, another one is called PSEN2,</p>
<p>and another one is called APP.</p>
<p>Those genes collectively make up about 1% of cases</p>
<p>of people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re fortunately very rare genes,</p>
<p>but sadly they are deterministic.</p>
<p>Meaning if you have those genes,</p>
<p>you do get Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s perhaps most devastating about those genes</p>
<p>is how early the onset is of the disease.</p>
<p>These are people that are usually getting</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in their 50s.</p>
<p>So we do have a patient in our practice,</p>
<p>actually she&rsquo;s spoken about this very openly,</p>
<p>whose mom had one of these genes.</p>
<p>And she got Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in her early 50s.</p>
<p>I think she might&rsquo;ve made it into her 60s before she died,</p>
<p>but absolutely devastating consequences here.</p>
<p>Why do people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s die?</p>
<p>Because I know about the hippocampal degeneration,</p>
<p>hippocampus of course being an area of the brain</p>
<p>important for learning and memory,</p>
<p>but is there brainstem degeneration?</p>
<p>Do they lose breathing centers or cardiovascular control?</p>
<p>Usually what happens is it&rsquo;s sort of failure to thrive,</p>
<p>aspiration, things like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s usually they just stop eating</p>
<p>or they can&rsquo;t control secretions,</p>
<p>they aspirate, they get a pneumonia</p>
<p>or they really lose the ability to even sense</p>
<p>like pain in their body.</p>
<p>And therefore like they&rsquo;ll get an ulcer</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t realize it and it&rsquo;ll become cellulitic</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll develop a horrible infection</p>
<p>in response to it.</p>
<p>I see, so it&rsquo;s a body vulnerability.</p>
<p>The reason I ask is every once in a while</p>
<p>a news report will come out based on a legitimate</p>
<p>case study where they&rsquo;ll do a scan on some person</p>
<p>and discover that they&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>literally half their cerebral cortex,</p>
<p>like huge chunks of brain</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re functioning relatively normally.</p>
<p>And so here we&rsquo;re talking about a neurodegenerative disease</p>
<p>of relatively, it&rsquo;s widespread,</p>
<p>but there are a few hotspots, of course,</p>
<p>in the brain that degenerate more profoundly than others</p>
<p>and the people dying.</p>
<p>So that makes sense.</p>
<p>It extends to lack of peripheral awareness or control</p>
<p>and then some acute injury or infection.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>You mentioned earlier some of the controversy, right?</p>
<p>So what are we talking about here?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, and I do write about this at length</p>
<p>in the chapter on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>because I think this is a very important point, right?</p>
<p>Which is the index case for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always an index case, right?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s the quote unquote patient zero.</p>
<p>The index case was a woman who, you know,</p>
<p>a hundred years later we realized had an APP mutation.</p>
<p>Obviously these are APP or PSEN1,</p>
<p>but she had one of these deterministic genes</p>
<p>that led to a very early onset of disease,</p>
<p>which by the way,</p>
<p>without which we may not have come up with the diagnosis</p>
<p>because had she just got Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in her 70s,</p>
<p>it would have just been referred to as senility,</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>was not interesting enough to pay attention to.</p>
<p>But I think it probably set the field on the path</p>
<p>towards an overemphasis on amyloid beta.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really clear how important amyloid is,</p>
<p>which is not to say it&rsquo;s not important.</p>
<p>It is important.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no ambiguity that amyloid is responsible</p>
<p>for the changes that we see in the brain,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not crystal clear</p>
<p>because there are lots of autopsies that are done</p>
<p>on people that are completely healthy</p>
<p>and have died with no cognitive impairment</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re chock full of amyloid.</p>
<p>So what we don&rsquo;t fully understand</p>
<p>is exactly what does removing amyloid do.</p>
<p>The other thing that complicates the story</p>
<p>is there has been no shortage of drugs that target amyloid</p>
<p>that have seemed unsuccessful.</p>
<p>And just to clarify, when you say amyloid,</p>
<p>you mean people have died with their brains examined</p>
<p>in autopsy and see that there are tons</p>
<p>of so-called amyloid plaques?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Different than arterial plaques, of course,</p>
<p>but within the brain.</p>
<p>So the two hallmarks of Alzheimer&rsquo;s histopathologically</p>
<p>would be plaques and tangles.</p>
<p>And even that now is, of course, coming under question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s what we teach every neuroscience graduate student.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we teach every undergraduate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also what we teach every medical student,</p>
<p>and not just at Stanford, but everywhere.</p>
<p>So I have heard that the link between APP</p>
<p>and whether or not one develops genes related to APP</p>
<p>and whether or not it&rsquo;s cleaved at one site or another,</p>
<p>which is what you were describing,</p>
<p>and risk for Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s basically a cleavage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cleavage question, right?</p>
<p>So people with the APP mutation,</p>
<p>I think have one extra cleavage site.</p>
<p>They result in one extra cleavage of amyloid,</p>
<p>and then it misfolds.</p>
<p>And the misfolding is what the plaque is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being created.</p>
<p>That also then predisposes them</p>
<p>to the neurofibrillary tangles.</p>
<p>And again-</p>
<p>But all this is under question now, right?</p>
<p>Well-</p>
<p>I mean, this is what I was told.</p>
<p>And when I look, it sounds like there were some early,</p>
<p>there were some papers early in the chain of discovery,</p>
<p>in the research in Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that were either wrong because they were falsified,</p>
<p>intentionally falsified.</p>
<p>There was an intentionally falsified paper</p>
<p>on one particular amyloid variant.</p>
<p>And that clearly set the field back a decade</p>
<p>because a lot of people went down that rabbit hole</p>
<p>based on deliberately falsified data.</p>
<p>So what happened to that guy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I assume it was a guy,</p>
<p>but what happened to that guy?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I think I wrote one piece about it</p>
<p>when it happened.</p>
<p>I actually reached out to the person who broke the story</p>
<p>because I wanted to have them on my podcast.</p>
<p>And I forget why he didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I forget why he wouldn&rsquo;t commit to it</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But I thought it was a little odd</p>
<p>because I thought this would be a great way</p>
<p>to talk about this.</p>
<p>I do not know what came of that scandal.</p>
<p>In other words, I haven&rsquo;t paid attention to it</p>
<p>for probably nine months.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, you know,</p>
<p>obviously the paper has probably been recalled,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what disciplinary action was taken.</p>
<p>The field is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna speak like I&rsquo;m in the field because I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>So I wanna be careful what I say,</p>
<p>but I think the field is probably in a bit of a crisis</p>
<p>because there have been so many bets placed</p>
<p>on anti-amyloid therapies and amyloid biomarkers</p>
<p>and amyloid everything.</p>
<p>And we just haven&rsquo;t seen efficacy, right?</p>
<p>So contrast that with cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>where, you know, you have this ApoB biomarker.</p>
<p>You understand the pathophysiology of how it works.</p>
<p>You have drugs that target it.</p>
<p>So you have a biomarker.</p>
<p>So you give somebody a drug that lowers ApoB,</p>
<p>you can measure ApoB.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really important and obvious thing</p>
<p>to be able to do.</p>
<p>And then you have clinical outcomes,</p>
<p>which is, oh, when you take a bunch of people</p>
<p>in primary prevention,</p>
<p>it takes this long before you see an effect.</p>
<p>In secondary prevention,</p>
<p>it only takes this long to see an effect, right?</p>
<p>Different risk stratifications, all these different things.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any of that for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>So we do use,</p>
<p>there are now serum amyloid biomarkers that we use.</p>
<p>And we do track these in our highest risk patients,</p>
<p>but only because we believe,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re right by the way,</p>
<p>that lower is better.</p>
<p>And therefore, if we make these changes to you</p>
<p>and your serum amyloid levels come down,</p>
<p>that that tells us something</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in your brain that&rsquo;s favorable.</p>
<p>But I mean, I would hate to represent</p>
<p>that we are practicing nearly the level</p>
<p>of precision medicine there</p>
<p>that we are in cardiovascular medicine.</p>
<p>When it comes to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>maybe take a step back.</p>
<p>When it comes to brain health,</p>
<p>I think there are a handful of things</p>
<p>that seem unequivocally true.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p>that is signal to noise ratio that&rsquo;s really low.</p>
<p>So the unequivocally true things</p>
<p>for brain health are sleep matters.</p>
<p>Another unequivocally true thing for brain health</p>
<p>is that lower LDL cholesterol and ApoB is better than higher.</p>
<p>Another thing that is unequivocally true</p>
<p>is not having type two diabetes matters.</p>
<p>So having really good&hellip;</p>
<p>Being insulin sensitive matters,</p>
<p>sleeping adequately matters,</p>
<p>having lower lipids matters.</p>
<p>Those three things are clear.</p>
<p>And the fourth one that is unequivocally clear</p>
<p>is exercise matters.</p>
<p>More specific form of exercise.</p>
<p>Very, so I tried to answer this question</p>
<p>on a recent AMA that I did,</p>
<p>because the answer is more is always better.</p>
<p>But if you, if I tried to have one of our analysts</p>
<p>look at it through the lens of</p>
<p>if you could only exercise three hours a week,</p>
<p>what would be the highest use case?</p>
<p>And our interpretation of the literature</p>
<p>was if you could only spend three hours a week exercising,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be best off doing one hour of low intensity cardio,</p>
<p>one hour of strength and one hour of interval training.</p>
<p>So if someone who said like,</p>
<p>I only want the minimum effective dose,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get a pretty good bang</p>
<p>for your buck doing that.</p>
<p>But I would argue if your brain really matters to you,</p>
<p>do more.</p>
<p>One hour of interval training is no joke.</p>
<p>No, because you&rsquo;re going to spread that out</p>
<p>over probably at least two workouts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But Andrew, those four things are basically the only thing</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no ambiguity about the benefit.</p>
<p>What about head hits?</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t get, don&rsquo;t hit your head.</p>
<p>Seems almost assuredly true</p>
<p>in a susceptible individual for sure.</p>
<p>So I put that, yeah, maybe we could include that as well.</p>
<p>Well, I just mentioned,</p>
<p>one of the things I&rsquo;ve been learning recently</p>
<p>is I know you boxed for a number of years</p>
<p>when you were younger.</p>
<p>I boxed a little bit,</p>
<p>hit my head a number of times skateboarding,</p>
<p>but we think about sport injuries</p>
<p>as the major cause of head injuries,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;ve got colleagues at Stanford</p>
<p>that say car accidents, bike accidents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got so many colleagues and children of colleagues</p>
<p>growing up in and around campus that were hit by cars</p>
<p>on Woodside Road or a mere small object</p>
<p>surrounded by three, was it car weight?</p>
<p>3,000 pounds or something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, more, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable that the number of head injuries</p>
<p>and then construction sites</p>
<p>because those ridiculous little hard hats</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t protect against anything,</p>
<p>except, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe windblown hair,</p>
<p>that they basically predispose,</p>
<p>the whole situation predispose people to head injuries.</p>
<p>Very common on construction sites</p>
<p>and then say nothing of military, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I think that I was told that the best thing to do</p>
<p>if you get a head injury is to not get another one.</p>
<p>In other words, if you can stop doing the activity</p>
<p>that leads to more head injury.</p>
<p>Yeah, the other thing that I think is emerging</p>
<p>and I hope it is studied rigorously</p>
<p>is the use of hyperbaric oxygen</p>
<p>immediately following a TBI, a traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>I reached out to Dom D&rsquo;Agostino a little while ago</p>
<p>to kind of, because he knows a lot about this lit,</p>
<p>to say, hey, is there anything out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really kind of turnkey convincing?</p>
<p>And he said, not yet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still doing it, right?</p>
<p>So I would do this.</p>
<p>If I was in a car accident tomorrow</p>
<p>and sustained a concussion,</p>
<p>and by the way, I&rsquo;m not a proponent of hyperbaric oxygen.</p>
<p>So we have an internal white paper</p>
<p>that we wrote inside quite recently</p>
<p>where I examined, when I say I examined,</p>
<p>the analyst team examined and I pushed back and reviewed.</p>
<p>And I came away very kind of bearish on hyperbaric oxygen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s harmful,</p>
<p>but I think all of the claims are nonsense.</p>
<p>You know, telomere extension is totally irrelevant.</p>
<p>And if you actually look at the studies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the worst done studies I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen some of these where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you put these people in a hyperbaric chamber</p>
<p>and then watch them do cognitive tasks</p>
<p>act after and they&rsquo;re so much better.</p>
<p>Well, the fine print is</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even have placebo groups here.</p>
<p>Like, can you imagine doing a study</p>
<p>without a placebo group?</p>
<p>Or your placebo group doesn&rsquo;t go into a sham chamber.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, one of the big problems of the proliferation</p>
<p>of all these pay-to-play journals,</p>
<p>meaning journals that will basically publish a paper</p>
<p>with minimal or poor peer review</p>
<p>because they charge in order to publish</p>
<p>and then offer free access.</p>
<p>You know, free access sounds great,</p>
<p>but when it&rsquo;s pay-to-play type journals,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a huge proliferation of papers,</p>
<p>most of which you find on Twitter,</p>
<p>in which the study design is beyond that.</p>
<p>Like a ninth grader who woke up late for school</p>
<p>and was partying all weekend</p>
<p>could design a better study than most of these studies.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some excellent studies out there as well,</p>
<p>of course, but presumably</p>
<p>and eventually on hyperbaric chamber too.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not picking on hyperbaric chamber per se,</p>
<p>but the proliferation of truly terrible science</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s published in peer reviewed journals</p>
<p>is just overwhelming.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>And all of that is to say,</p>
<p>I think there are places where hyperbaric oxygen</p>
<p>makes sense, clearly in wound healing, it does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a miracle treatment for wound healing.</p>
<p>And I would absolutely use hyperbaric oxygen</p>
<p>if I suffered a concussion.</p>
<p>But, you know, beyond that,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty tough to make the case.</p>
<p>Where do people go for that?</p>
<p>I mean, there are clinics.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are clinics you basically go to.</p>
<p>The protocols have to be very precise.</p>
<p>I mean, this isn&rsquo;t something to cowboy at home.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, you have to go into a real chamber.</p>
<p>I think the TBI protocol that&rsquo;s most commonly used is,</p>
<p>God, I wanna say it&rsquo;s pretty intense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like five 60 minute sessions a week</p>
<p>at two atmospheres.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s no joke.</p>
<p>So from a cost and time perspective, it&rsquo;s enormous.</p>
<p>And the time and cost are reasons why I think</p>
<p>when I see people doing hyperbaric oxygen,</p>
<p>just because they think it&rsquo;s gonna help them live longer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, dude, you know what you could do</p>
<p>with five hours a week plus the commuting time</p>
<p>that you put into that, like put that into exercise</p>
<p>and I promise you, you&rsquo;ll get a bigger benefit</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;re getting out of hyperbaric oxygen.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of other stuff</p>
<p>that I just think is maybe helpful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of supplements that I think about</p>
<p>when it comes to brain health.</p>
<p>What about theracumin?</p>
<p>What about magnesium with L3 and eight, the transporter?</p>
<p>What about methylated vitamins that lower homocysteine?</p>
<p>What about EPA and DHA?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve gone through all of the literature on that stuff.</p>
<p>And many of these things we still are recommending</p>
<p>through a kind of basically like the potential benefits</p>
<p>outweigh the potential costs,</p>
<p>but the evidence is really unimpressive</p>
<p>for most of those other interventions.</p>
<p>So when you think about the big four or big five,</p>
<p>if you include not getting head injury,</p>
<p>everything else is probably a rounding error</p>
<p>compared to those big ones.</p>
<p>Maybe just for sake of thoroughness,</p>
<p>we can just list off those four again, exercise.</p>
<p>Exercise, sleep, insulin sensitivity, and lipid management.</p>
<p>Well, along the lines of head injuries,</p>
<p>we should probably move to the next category</p>
<p>of how not to die as to avoid accidental death.</p>
<p>How common is accidental death</p>
<p>and what are these accidental deaths?</p>
<p>Because we are separating this out from automotive death.</p>
<p>So is this people falling while hiking,</p>
<p>selfies gone bad, what are we talking about here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not chuckling because I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I mean,</p>
<p>it seems like there&rsquo;s a near infinite ways</p>
<p>to die accidentally.</p>
<p>And when you-</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s two ways to kind of look at this.</p>
<p>And so here I kind of merge two categories.</p>
<p>So I would call it that overlap</p>
<p>in the way that they&rsquo;re characterized by the CDC,</p>
<p>but I would sort of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about them separately and bring them together.</p>
<p>So if you talk about true accidental deaths,</p>
<p>automotive and falls and overdoses are the three.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what it comes down to.</p>
<p>So, you know, in our death bar analysis,</p>
<p>we kind of list all this stuff out.</p>
<p>In fact, I think that&rsquo;s actually one of the figures</p>
<p>in the book is I have the accidental death figure</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve put together where we&rsquo;ve adjusted by population.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see a couple of things.</p>
<p>If you look at it in absolute terms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a pretty constant.</p>
<p>So regardless of what decade of life you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re above, you know, 20,</p>
<p>accidental deaths are a pretty sizable number of deaths.</p>
<p>Now, car accidents seem to be pretty constant</p>
<p>throughout life.</p>
<p>Little more common if you&rsquo;re under 60 than over 60,</p>
<p>but they never go away.</p>
<p>I was told that in teenage and boys in their early 20s,</p>
<p>alcohol induced automotive fatalities</p>
<p>would place them at an astronomic risk.</p>
<p>Is that just not true?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true anymore compared to overdoses.</p>
<p>Is that because young people now</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t getting their driver&rsquo;s licenses?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think it&rsquo;s also because we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>such an uptick in the deaths that come from fentanyl.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Fentanyl related deaths have basically squashed</p>
<p>all other deaths below 65 on the accidental front.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>Because of the number of different substances</p>
<p>that fentanyl is being woven into.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s winding its way into everything, right?</p>
<p>So all counterfeit drugs, all illicit drugs.</p>
<p>And look, most of the time you&rsquo;re not getting a lethal dose.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re getting lethal doses so often now that,</p>
<p>um, well, you know, I did a little analysis actually</p>
<p>the other day when I looked at how are deaths of despair</p>
<p>increasing over the last five years?</p>
<p>So what did I define as a death of despair?</p>
<p>Suicide, alcohol-related death, or overdose?</p>
<p>Accidental overdose.</p>
<p>So we differentiate that from suicide</p>
<p>where suicide is obviously deliberate and accidental is not.</p>
<p>So if you just looked at those three things,</p>
<p>so accidental overdoses, suicides, and alcohol use,</p>
<p>or alcohol-related death,</p>
<p>not including driving, by the way,</p>
<p>this is like cirrhosis of the liver that comes from,</p>
<p>that number is going up at almost 20% per year since 2019.</p>
<p>So I couldn&rsquo;t get 2022 numbers yet.</p>
<p>So at the time of the time I did this analysis,</p>
<p>which was last week,</p>
<p>um,</p>
<p>the 2021 numbers was about 210,000 Americans.</p>
<p>Goodness.</p>
<p>Up from 180,000 in 2020,</p>
<p>up from like 150,000 in 2019.</p>
<p>So is this, um.</p>
<p>And that is driven almost entirely by fentanyl use.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to get a sense of how this would happen.</p>
<p>A while back, there was an article in the New York Times</p>
<p>that some photographs of people</p>
<p>that died of fentanyl overdose,</p>
<p>and said they went out to buy cocaine and died of fentanyl.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself,</p>
<p>this is a really kind of odd socio-biological phenomenon,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because, I mean, here they&rsquo;re not demonizing</p>
<p>these cocaine users.</p>
<p>I mean, they went out to buy cocaine, right?</p>
<p>This is not a,</p>
<p>I know cocaine has one narrow clinical use</p>
<p>as a prescription drug,</p>
<p>but in general, when people buy cocaine,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re quote, unquote, partying with it,</p>
<p>or using it to work longer hours or something like that.</p>
<p>Um, so the whole nature of the article</p>
<p>was a bit strange to me,</p>
<p>but it clearly pointed to the fact</p>
<p>that people are using cocaine.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s no surprise,</p>
<p>but people are going out and buying cocaine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re presumably buying Valium.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re presumably buying.</p>
<p>This is where it&rsquo;s really killing kids.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s online.</p>
<p>This is in person.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason I&rsquo;m so,</p>
<p>so baffled by this is,</p>
<p>let me contextualize what I&rsquo;ve said so far</p>
<p>about this question.</p>
<p>I was surprised that the Times would write a paper</p>
<p>about the tragedy of cocaine users dying of fentanyl.</p>
<p>And I think they did it to highlight this fentanyl problem,</p>
<p>because people have been using cocaine for a long time.</p>
<p>And typically those are not the members of the population</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really focused on,</p>
<p>since the mid eighties,</p>
<p>the so-called cocaine and crack epidemic.</p>
<p>So basically it tells me that people,</p>
<p>like you said, illicit drugs, so cocaine,</p>
<p>but also, you know, what other sorts of drugs</p>
<p>are people buying?</p>
<p>The majority of people are dying from fentanyl poisoning.</p>
<p>And I had a guy on my podcast recently</p>
<p>named Anthony Hippolito.</p>
<p>And if anybody&rsquo;s interested in this topic,</p>
<p>they really need to go listen to that.</p>
<p>So Anthony-</p>
<p>I watched the YouTube version of this</p>
<p>and your podcasts are excellent.</p>
<p>So people, if you&rsquo;re interested in this,</p>
<p>and I think everyone should be interested in this.</p>
<p>If you have a child or know somebody who has a child,</p>
<p>you just got to get this podcast into their hands</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the most important public service announcement</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably ever do</p>
<p>in terms of saving more lives potentially.</p>
<p>Where the majority of this is making its way</p>
<p>into the accidental poisonings</p>
<p>is through illicit counterfeit pills.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s when kids are out there buying,</p>
<p>you know, Oxy, they want Oxy.</p>
<p>Well, they can&rsquo;t get real Oxy, right?</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re not going to go to a doctor</p>
<p>and get real Oxy.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to buy it through, you know,</p>
<p>Snapchat, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to buy it through some drug dealer</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re finding on social media.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re buying sleeping pills.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re buying all sorts of counterfeit stuff like Adderall.</p>
<p>Any of these things are being laced with fentanyl.</p>
<p>Adderall?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, I assumed that fentanyl-</p>
<p>And again, the reasons are it&rsquo;s insanely cheap</p>
<p>to use synthetic fentanyl.</p>
<p>And secondly, and again-</p>
<p>But the effects of fentanyl are nothing like</p>
<p>the effects of Adderall.</p>
<p>So cocaine doesn&rsquo;t make sense for that reason either.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t make sense either.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s still showing up in cocaine.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the dominant place</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s showing up.</p>
<p>I would guess that the dominant place it&rsquo;s showing up</p>
<p>is in counterfeit opioids.</p>
<p>So any opioid, barbiturate, any sedative, depressant-</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I&rsquo;m telling my daughter, right?</p>
<p>Cause this is, to me, it&rsquo;s a frontline problem.</p>
<p>I have a 14 year old daughter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, listen, I don&rsquo;t care which friend of yours it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how much she&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>If she tells you to try this sleeping pill</p>
<p>because she took it the night before</p>
<p>and it was really helpful,</p>
<p>or this will help you study better,</p>
<p>or this will help you do anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, just come to us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a better pill for you.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like in other words, you can&rsquo;t trust anything</p>
<p>cause you don&rsquo;t know where she got it.</p>
<p>She has the best of intentions, I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s given it to you.</p>
<p>And by the way, she probably took it the night before</p>
<p>and was just fine.</p>
<p>But the people who are making these pills</p>
<p>are not exactly up to GMP standards.</p>
<p>So you just have no idea which pill is getting</p>
<p>what dose of fentanyl.</p>
<p>One thing that Anthony Hippolito told me</p>
<p>that I simply couldn&rsquo;t believe,</p>
<p>I had to ask him six times,</p>
<p>was that some of these pills</p>
<p>have like one milligram of fentanyl in them.</p>
<p>Now, I made the point on the podcast</p>
<p>that a hundred milligrams of fentanyl</p>
<p>for most people is a hit.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve had fentanyl before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the hospital and I&rsquo;ve had fentanyl.</p>
<p>A hundred milligrams is like, wow, that is such a trip.</p>
<p>Why are people dying from one milligram intake?</p>
<p>Respiratory inhibition.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>That shuts the brainstem off.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think we can highlight this enough.</p>
<p>Adults are dying, kids are dying.</p>
<p>I met someone earlier this week</p>
<p>who told me her 35 year old son</p>
<p>died of an accidental fentanyl overdose.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t, at least by her description,</p>
<p>a drug addict or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re talking about a different game now, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, these are kids that have anxiety.</p>
<p>These are kids that are sort of addressing another issue</p>
<p>with these pills.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think this whole concept</p>
<p>of deaths of despair is a really important one.</p>
<p>But back to your question,</p>
<p>what do accidental deaths primarily amount to</p>
<p>for the aging population?</p>
<p>Again, it is so clear that it is fall related.</p>
<p>This is where once you hit 60, 65,</p>
<p>the risk of a fall that results</p>
<p>either immediately in death,</p>
<p>you know, you hit your head and die,</p>
<p>going back to like cerebral hemorrhage,</p>
<p>or it is the straw that basically leads you down the path</p>
<p>to death within the next 12 months is astonishingly high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so high that it&rsquo;s sort of hard to wrap your head around</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re over 65 and you fall</p>
<p>and break your femur or hip,</p>
<p>so you either crack the femoral neck</p>
<p>or the femur itself,</p>
<p>your 12 month mortality,</p>
<p>the probability you will be dead in 12 months</p>
<p>after that break, if you&rsquo;re 65 or older,</p>
<p>depending on the study is about 15 to 30%.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So in terms of offsetting the probability of falls,</p>
<p>you talked a little bit about this before,</p>
<p>but you and I have talked a little bit about this before,</p>
<p>but maybe we could go a little bit deeper.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s ability to jump and land</p>
<p>seems to be highly correlated with one&rsquo;s ability to not fall</p>
<p>or at least fall and control the fall</p>
<p>in a way that leads to no or less severe injury.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Andy Galpin talked about this on your podcast,</p>
<p>he talked about it on my podcast.</p>
<p>What is the hallmark of aging on the muscle?</p>
<p>It is atrophy of the type two muscle fiber.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hallmark.</p>
<p>Fast twitch.</p>
<p>Fast twitch muscle fiber.</p>
<p>So if you wanna understand what looks different</p>
<p>in 50 year old Peter versus 18 year old Peter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not my type one fibers, it&rsquo;s my type two fibers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my fast twitch fibers, it&rsquo;s my explosive fibers.</p>
<p>I mean, when I was 18 years old,</p>
<p>I could vertical jump over 30 inches.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m lucky if I can vertical jump 24 inches.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m 60, boy, it&rsquo;s like my goal</p>
<p>is to be able to vertical jump 20 inches when I&rsquo;m 60,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m gonna be able to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some videos of some 80 year old sprinters</p>
<p>that are pretty impressive,</p>
<p>and certainly 80 year old gymnasts that are impressive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not seen very many videos</p>
<p>of 80 year olds dunking basketballs, for instance.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Who are not taller than six feet, five inches.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So when we lose, so again,</p>
<p>if you just think about size, strength, speed,</p>
<p>we lose speed first.</p>
<p>We lose speed, then strength,</p>
<p>and the last thing you lose is size.</p>
<p>So again, size is agnostic to fiber, right?</p>
<p>You could have big type one fibers</p>
<p>and still have lots of size.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be that strong,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re certainly not gonna be fast.</p>
<p>So what, I mean, we could go through,</p>
<p>we could spend hours on this particular topic,</p>
<p>but I think the most important thing</p>
<p>that people need to understand is you cannot age well</p>
<p>if you are not doing the type of training</p>
<p>that is there to strengthen and delay</p>
<p>or minimize the hypertrophy of your type two fibers.</p>
<p>So everything matters, right?</p>
<p>You have to be doing your zone two.</p>
<p>You have to be doing all of these other things,</p>
<p>but some component of your training</p>
<p>needs to be stressing the type two fibers.</p>
<p>You have to be doing strength training</p>
<p>that taxes those fibers.</p>
<p>You have to be doing reactivity training.</p>
<p>You have to be doing explosive training.</p>
<p>And ideally some training that involves jumping and landing.</p>
<p>Well, jumping is a very big part of it.</p>
<p>And landing is a very big part of another one</p>
<p>of what I kind of think of as my four pillars</p>
<p>of strength training.</p>
<p>So one of the pillars of strength training</p>
<p>is eccentric strength, which is breaks.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna hurt yourself 10 times more likely,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making that number up by the way,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s 10 times,</p>
<p>but experientially it seems to be,</p>
<p>you are 10 times more likely to hurt yourself</p>
<p>stepping off something than stepping onto something, right?</p>
<p>Stepping down versus stepping up.</p>
<p>Because when you step up onto something,</p>
<p>you are concentrically controlling muscle.</p>
<p>When you step down, you have to apply the breaks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where most people falter.</p>
<p>Much harder to walk downhill than uphill.</p>
<p>Uphill is taxing your cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>But if you slow down enough, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>But a lot of people don&rsquo;t have the ability</p>
<p>to slow themselves down when they&rsquo;re walking downhill.</p>
<p>And so when an older person steps off a curb</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t fully stop themselves, and that results in a fall.</p>
<p>So, you know, I like doing things like a broad jump.</p>
<p>Broad jump&rsquo;s a fun little test set</p>
<p>I like to do every once in a while.</p>
<p>I always wanna make sure I can broad jump six feet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of my arbitrary number that I&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>
<p>And the reason is on the takeoff,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very explosive movement.</p>
<p>But the landing is just as important.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t stick that landing,</p>
<p>it means I don&rsquo;t have the breaks.</p>
<p>So those are kind of some of the tests</p>
<p>I wanna be able to do to make sure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m utilizing that system.</p>
<p>Because I do think, you know, look, I&rsquo;ve watched my mom.</p>
<p>My mom fell, gosh, probably been about four months ago.</p>
<p>Just fell in a typical way that people fall.</p>
<p>By the way, it could have happened to anybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, you know, my mom walks around</p>
<p>and moves around just fine.</p>
<p>But on this particular day,</p>
<p>she just tripped on a uneven stone and fell</p>
<p>and landed and broke her hand.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s really lucky she didn&rsquo;t break her hip.</p>
<p>And I told her that because my mom was, you know,</p>
<p>probably in her mid seventies.</p>
<p>And I said, look, you know, if that was your femur,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give you a 30% chance of dying in the next year.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just an,</p>
<p>those are such difficult to recover from injuries.</p>
<p>Because first of all, you&rsquo;re dealing with the immobility</p>
<p>of, you know, the hospitalization</p>
<p>and immobility that follows that.</p>
<p>And the amount of muscle loss that occurs</p>
<p>could easily be, you know,</p>
<p>four or five pounds of lean tissue lost</p>
<p>that for most people that age</p>
<p>becomes almost impossible to get back.</p>
<p>And that says nothing about sort of the acute causes of death</p>
<p>like a fat embolism that results from a broken femur,</p>
<p>a blood clot from laying in bed.</p>
<p>Those things are also catastrophic.</p>
<p>But what happens is a lot of these patients</p>
<p>just never get back to the same level of mobility.</p>
<p>And, you know, now I think in many ways</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of pivoting from what kills you</p>
<p>to what ruins your quality of life.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve spent so much time talking about what kills you,</p>
<p>but I think you might as well be dead in some ways</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t do the things you wanna do.</p>
<p>And if playing with your grandkids or gardening</p>
<p>or playing golf or going for a walk with your spouse</p>
<p>or think of any of the things that we all do today</p>
<p>and take for granted, if you can&rsquo;t do those things,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you sort of lose the reason to be around.</p>
<p>And oftentimes the inability to do those things</p>
<p>is associated with pain,</p>
<p>which is psychologically and obviously physiologically</p>
<p>so distressing.</p>
<p>You mentioned the four pillars of health.</p>
<p>Maybe just list those off for people.</p>
<p>Of lifting?</p>
<p>Well, the four pillars of longevity through physical.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Sort of the exercise pieces of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, so strength, stability, aerobic efficiency</p>
<p>and aerobic peak output.</p>
<p>Okay, so aerobic peak would be, so VO2 max.</p>
<p>And zone two, that&rsquo;s in my analogy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your zone two is how wide the base of your pyramid is</p>
<p>and your VO2 max is how tall the peak of the pyramid is.</p>
<p>So the best pyramid has a wide base and a high peak.</p>
<p>So you could have a reasonably wide base and a shallow peak.</p>
<p>If you just did zone two training,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get a reasonable peak,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna be that high.</p>
<p>You have to do some of that specific training.</p>
<p>If you just focus on high intensity,</p>
<p>you might drive up that VO2 max,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re actually gonna have a relatively wide,</p>
<p>a narrow aerobic base.</p>
<p>So you think about just maximizing the area</p>
<p>of that triangle, widest, tallest.</p>
<p>Stability and strength.</p>
<p>Stability, of course,</p>
<p>encompasses everything we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in terms of reactivity.</p>
<p>You know, I dedicate a chapter in the book to this concept</p>
<p>because it is so foreign to most people.</p>
<p>And for understandable reasons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not sexy, it&rsquo;s the hardest one to train,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the hardest one to understand,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so important because it&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that I think differentiates people who age well</p>
<p>and people who don&rsquo;t age well.</p>
<p>And I should perhaps throw in there,</p>
<p>please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but also most of the machines</p>
<p>that are in typical commercial gyms</p>
<p>that allow people who are not very experienced</p>
<p>to start doing some resistance training</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really tap into the stability factor terribly much.</p>
<p>So while there&rsquo;s value to leg extensions and leg curls</p>
<p>and chest presses and shoulder presses</p>
<p>that are done with machines,</p>
<p>certainly for a number of reasons</p>
<p>and can often be safer than free weights,</p>
<p>especially for people who are approaching it at a later time</p>
<p>or new to the whole thing,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really lend themselves to real life stability,</p>
<p>walking down, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>walking down stairs in the absence of a handrail</p>
<p>or movements in kind of odd planes,</p>
<p>having to step aside to avoid a bicycle at an angle</p>
<p>as opposed to just moving linearly.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the way,</p>
<p>a lot of things that don&rsquo;t involve machines</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t give you that, right?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, doing a deadlift,</p>
<p>you have to be stable to lift a heavy weight</p>
<p>like you would a deadlift without hurting yourself.</p>
<p>That requires an unbelievable capacity</p>
<p>to harness intra-abdominal pressure and to be connected.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna lift 500 pounds off the ground,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stable.</p>
<p>But that still doesn&rsquo;t prepare you</p>
<p>for what you just described.</p>
<p>So stability is multifaceted</p>
<p>and it involves doing a lot of things.</p>
<p>You know, today, for example, I finished my,</p>
<p>today was a cardio zone two day.</p>
<p>So I did my cardio zone two</p>
<p>and I had an extra 10 minutes</p>
<p>before I needed to kind of get moving.</p>
<p>And so all I did was step ups for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I just did single leg, very slow step up</p>
<p>and insanely slow step downs off a box in a gym.</p>
<p>So two second up, four second down,</p>
<p>two second up, four second down with, you know,</p>
<p>and I would do them with ipsilateral loads,</p>
<p>contralateral loads, all sorts of different things.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>basically that&rsquo;s just a stability game for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m building that concentric strength</p>
<p>in a movement where it&rsquo;s easy to cheat,</p>
<p>but can I do it without cheating?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s terrific that you covered all of that</p>
<p>in the book, in addition to these other topics.</p>
<p>So several times during our conversation today,</p>
<p>you alluded to quality of life.</p>
<p>And one of my favorite segments in your book,</p>
<p>indeed, the segment in your book</p>
<p>that I believe could be its own entire book</p>
<p>of tremendous value is the section on emotional health.</p>
<p>If you could just share with us a bit</p>
<p>of what inspired you to include that section.</p>
<p>Was this, for instance,</p>
<p>based on communication with your patients?</p>
<p>To what extent it was based on your own life experience?</p>
<p>And then maybe we can drill a little bit deeper</p>
<p>into what&rsquo;s contained in those chapters</p>
<p>and what really constitutes emotional health.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think that chapter of the book,</p>
<p>which is a pretty long chapter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the final chapter as well,</p>
<p>is certainly different from all of the others</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s no confusion about expertise, right?</p>
<p>I think in the other chapters,</p>
<p>I at least try to come across as having some knowledge</p>
<p>on the subject matter.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m writing them most often as,</p>
<p>quote unquote, the doctor, right?</p>
<p>Whereas I think that last chapter</p>
<p>is much more about an experiential side</p>
<p>of my knowledge acquisition.</p>
<p>And therefore really it comes across more as a patient.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a chapter that initially was resisted</p>
<p>by all other parties involved in the book.</p>
<p>So my co-author, my editor,</p>
<p>everybody else sort of felt like this is interesting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a separate topic.</p>
<p>If you want to write about this,</p>
<p>you should write another book about it.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t really belong in this book.</p>
<p>I disagreed for two reasons</p>
<p>and ultimately, I guess my opinion prevailed.</p>
<p>The first is I didn&rsquo;t want to write another book.</p>
<p>So it just that, you know,</p>
<p>not including this in this book</p>
<p>to then write about it in another book</p>
<p>was not something I was interested in doing.</p>
<p>But I think more importantly,</p>
<p>I do think that this book is about much more</p>
<p>than how long you live.</p>
<p>And while we have talked about,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about in the book that is, you know,</p>
<p>how cognitive and physical health</p>
<p>are just as germane to quality of life</p>
<p>as they are to length of life.</p>
<p>This other piece of emotional health,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s potentially the most important of them all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the hardest to define,</p>
<p>but without it, none of this other stuff matters, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, you know, infinite lifespan.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re miserable, means nothing.</p>
<p>Maybe worse.</p>
<p>That would be a curse, right?</p>
<p>You could argue, how could you punish somebody the most,</p>
<p>allow them to live forever and be miserable?</p>
<p>Is there a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a Greek god, Tithonus.</p>
<p>Tithonus?</p>
<p>Yeah, he was granted immortality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit different.</p>
<p>He was granted immortality,</p>
<p>but without a healthspan, basically.</p>
<p>So he aged forever.</p>
<p>Dreadful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this would be dreadful too, right?</p>
<p>And I feel like, why did I need to write about this?</p>
<p>Well, I think that, you know,</p>
<p>this is probably my greatest struggle, I think.</p>
<p>You know, way at the outset of the podcast,</p>
<p>you asked me kind of like,</p>
<p>what are the obstacles to longevity?</p>
<p>And that got us down a path</p>
<p>of some very black and white things.</p>
<p>But when I look at a patient,</p>
<p>I create a dashboard.</p>
<p>And the dashboard is,</p>
<p>what are all the things that are a threat</p>
<p>to every component of your longevity,</p>
<p>both lifespan and healthspan?</p>
<p>We talked about a bunch of those things.</p>
<p>So what is your risk for atherosclerosis</p>
<p>and what are we doing about it?</p>
<p>What is your risk for cancer?</p>
<p>What are we doing about it?</p>
<p>What is your risk for neurodegeneration?</p>
<p>What are we doing about it?</p>
<p>What is your risk for accidental death?</p>
<p>What are we doing about it?</p>
<p>What is your risk for physical decline?</p>
<p>What are we doing about it?</p>
<p>And one of those things is,</p>
<p>what is your risk of emotional health</p>
<p>or poor emotional health,</p>
<p>and what are we doing about it?</p>
<p>So when I do that exercise for me,</p>
<p>which I do, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I have that spreadsheet laid out for me</p>
<p>and I know where my factors line up.</p>
<p>And interestingly, despite my family history</p>
<p>being horrible for atherosclerosis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like sixth on my list.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, basically I intervened early.</p>
<p>I have a clear understanding of the pathophysiology</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing everything to the maximum.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually very confident I will die with</p>
<p>and not from atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>But the top thing on my list is actually emotional health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that is the hardest for me to manage.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the easiest to get out of balance</p>
<p>and it creates the most pain in my life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a long answer to why I felt</p>
<p>this needed to be in here.</p>
<p>Well, in the book, you go into very honest detail</p>
<p>about some of your journeys through</p>
<p>and challenges with emotional health</p>
<p>and paths to overcoming those.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll get into those a bit,</p>
<p>but before we do, how should we define emotional health?</p>
<p>This to me seems like one of the most difficult areas</p>
<p>to calibrate oneself.</p>
<p>Like even just measuring emotion is tricky.</p>
<p>Language is the dissection tool</p>
<p>for psychologists, psychiatrists, and indeed for all of us.</p>
<p>You know, how are you doing today?</p>
<p>Great, or I&rsquo;m miserable, or I&rsquo;m depressed.</p>
<p>I mean, it means such different things to different people.</p>
<p>Obviously, suicide being the far end of, we presume, misery.</p>
<p>There are instances of manic suicide,</p>
<p>but, you know, depressive misery.</p>
<p>But setting that aside, I mean, how should we evaluate,</p>
<p>think about, and communicate emotional health to ourselves</p>
<p>and to the relevant people that could potentially</p>
<p>help us.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult, right?</p>
<p>And so much of what goes into this book</p>
<p>is about things that are much easier to quantify.</p>
<p>I could sit here and talk for days</p>
<p>about all the ways we quantify from the histologic</p>
<p>to the gross of each of these diseases,</p>
<p>genetically, all of these other things.</p>
<p>With emotional health, it&rsquo;s far more vague.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even attempt to come up with a definition.</p>
<p>I can tell you things that make up components of it.</p>
<p>So, connectivity with others</p>
<p>just seems to be an inescapable part of this.</p>
<p>So the ability to maintain healthy relationships</p>
<p>and attachments to other people, having,</p>
<p>and by the way, these are no particular order,</p>
<p>having a sense of purpose,</p>
<p>being able to regulate your emotions,</p>
<p>experiencing fulfillment, experiencing satisfaction.</p>
<p>All of these things matter.</p>
<p>And I think that for many of us,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re taking an honest appraisal of ourselves,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll notice that we have deficits in these areas.</p>
<p>Being present.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s something that may have been</p>
<p>less of an issue 100 years ago than it is today.</p>
<p>So I think, certainly for me,</p>
<p>being present is very difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my default state.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s the default state</p>
<p>for most people, truthfully,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very often predisposed</p>
<p>with thoughts about the future,</p>
<p>occasionally thoughts about the past,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more often kind of thoughts about the future</p>
<p>and planning and thinking about what I need to do</p>
<p>and what do I wanna do next</p>
<p>and never really being satisfied</p>
<p>with anything that&rsquo;s happening in the moment.</p>
<p>So I have to work hard to kind of overcome those things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure you can appreciate this,</p>
<p>but when you are present,</p>
<p>you generally are in a much better frame of mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an interesting study.</p>
<p>I think it was initially published by Dan Gilbert&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>one of these long-term happiness studies</p>
<p>that was published in Science Magazine</p>
<p>that pinged people for their level of happiness,</p>
<p>unhappiness, presence, or lack of presence</p>
<p>multiple times throughout the day.</p>
<p>This was in the early years of smartphones.</p>
<p>So this is around 2010, 2011.</p>
<p>So the technology wasn&rsquo;t as good as it is now,</p>
<p>but it was good enough to do this</p>
<p>in a very large number of people.</p>
<p>I forget how many, but it&rsquo;s certainly more than 10,000.</p>
<p>That number is, I&rsquo;m stating it intentionally low.</p>
<p>And what they found was regardless</p>
<p>of whether or not people were doing something</p>
<p>they enjoyed or not, boring to them or not,</p>
<p>the degree of presence to what they were doing</p>
<p>was a stronger predictor of their happiness</p>
<p>in that moment and overall than was anything else.</p>
<p>And also a pretty fairly rare feature for most people.</p>
<p>So it seems like it&rsquo;s something that we do need to work at</p>
<p>perhaps nowadays, as you point out,</p>
<p>more than we perhaps had to in our ancestral past.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit surprised that you say</p>
<p>that you find it hard to be present</p>
<p>because you strike me as somebody that is not just willing,</p>
<p>but has a strong, almost reflex toward drilling in,</p>
<p>observing the contour or something,</p>
<p>and then really drilling into it</p>
<p>and really getting to the guts of most everything</p>
<p>that interests you.</p>
<p>So you strike me as somebody who&rsquo;s very present.</p>
<p>And I guess maybe this gets back to this.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not mutually exclusive, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think, so for example,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll notice that sometimes if I&rsquo;m playing with my kids,</p>
<p>especially my boys, because they&rsquo;re younger, right?</p>
<p>And playing with them is really being in their world.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m with my daughter,</p>
<p>we can be doing things that are kind of mutually,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ll do things together</p>
<p>that I would probably do by myself</p>
<p>or she would do by herself.</p>
<p>But with my boys, it&rsquo;s generally doing something</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be doing.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m paying attention to it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly amazed at how after five minutes</p>
<p>of searching through a bin for just the right Lego piece</p>
<p>that we wanna do to build this one little thing,</p>
<p>like my mind will start thinking about something else.</p>
<p>Like, oh my God, like I gotta go,</p>
<p>oh, I didn&rsquo;t email that dude back.</p>
<p>And I gotta do this and I gotta do this</p>
<p>and I gotta do this and I gotta do this.</p>
<p>And I just get into the, I gotta do, I gotta do,</p>
<p>I gotta do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, dude, you&rsquo;ve only been here for five minutes.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just find the Lego piece</p>
<p>that you need to finish building that thing over there</p>
<p>that is this beautiful moment</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not gonna have many of, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very finite number of these moments</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have.</p>
<p>So you wanna savor every one of them.</p>
<p>So again, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone in that.</p>
<p>I think a lot of parents, for example, can relate to that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s literally just one of many different things.</p>
<p>And by the way, I wouldn&rsquo;t have said</p>
<p>that that was my greatest challenge either,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that requires,</p>
<p>I think, deliberate attention.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re alluding to is a challenge</p>
<p>with holding a single time perception</p>
<p>or perception of time.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable things to me</p>
<p>about the human brain is our ability to be present</p>
<p>or think about the past or the future</p>
<p>or the present and the future.</p>
<p>And we can occupy different time bins.</p>
<p>And in a recent non-recorded conversation of ours,</p>
<p>you showed me something that I&rsquo;ve seen before,</p>
<p>but for some reason this time</p>
<p>it had a profound impact on me,</p>
<p>which is that you have a chart of the number of weeks</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to live</p>
<p>and you mark them off one week at a time.</p>
<p>We were talking about this</p>
<p>in the context of major life decisions.</p>
<p>And it illustrates the fact that we need such a chart</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t really move through our day being present</p>
<p>to the beauty of working on a Lego with our kid</p>
<p>while also paying attention to the fact that,</p>
<p>wow, this is week number, whatever,</p>
<p>600 in the X number of weeks of one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>So that ability to contract and dilate</p>
<p>our time perception is marvelous,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a double-edged sword</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what takes us out</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s meaningful in the moment.</p>
<p>One sort of has to wonder then</p>
<p>whether or not our challenges in being present,</p>
<p>I guess the psychoanalyst, maybe we need to,</p>
<p>or a psychiatrist, maybe we need to ask Paul Conti,</p>
<p>who you know and I know and respect greatly,</p>
<p>whether or not this is some subconscious refusal</p>
<p>of our own mortality or something, right?</p>
<p>That if we were to really contemplate our mortality</p>
<p>on a regular basis,</p>
<p>not just when we&rsquo;re marking off the weeks of the poster,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to be present</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of overwhelming, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I feel like the literature says</p>
<p>that people who spend more time</p>
<p>contemplating their own mortality</p>
<p>are actually more at peace.</p>
<p>Kind of a little bit of the exposure therapy idea.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s an unhealthy thing</p>
<p>to be aware of your mortality.</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s helpful in as much as you accept it, right?</p>
<p>And you feel like you have some agency</p>
<p>over parts of it, right?</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t think I have nearly enough agency</p>
<p>over the length of my life.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve got five to 10 years of wiggle room</p>
<p>that I can extract.</p>
<p>If I do all of the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve written about in that book,</p>
<p>I bet I can stretch my life out 10 to 15 years</p>
<p>at the maximum, call it 10,</p>
<p>over what would have happened if I didn&rsquo;t do those things.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>but it depends on what we&rsquo;re comparing it to, right?</p>
<p>From being reasonable</p>
<p>to maybe being a little bit hyper-functioning.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s 10 years.</p>
<p>But where I know I have a much greater agency</p>
<p>is on quality.</p>
<p>And for me now,</p>
<p>a big part of that is in terms of quality of relationships.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big thing.</p>
<p>And I think for most people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I hope this chapter does,</p>
<p>is it sort of allows more people</p>
<p>to kind of take an appraisal of that</p>
<p>and ask that question,</p>
<p>which is before it&rsquo;s too late,</p>
<p>am I living my life more for my resume virtues</p>
<p>or for my eulogy virtues</p>
<p>to borrow from David Brooks&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>The Road to Character,</p>
<p>which I talk about as being kind of</p>
<p>one of the many aha moments that I had during this journey.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there again, thank you.</p>
<p>You recommended The Road to Character to me.</p>
<p>I do an annual solo wilderness trip</p>
<p>and I listened to it during the drive to that trip</p>
<p>and on that trip.</p>
<p>And I would just say it&rsquo;s a truly important book</p>
<p>for everyone to listen to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite impressive.</p>
<p>What are the things that you do on a regular,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say on a daily basis,</p>
<p>to try and enforce, forgive the word,</p>
<p>but enforce emotional wellbeing and health</p>
<p>in terms of relationships?</p>
<p>Because as you point out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not reflexive for everybody</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t make them bad people.</p>
<p>I think it does have to do with this challenge</p>
<p>in balancing expectations of work and other things.</p>
<p>And for some people, a more inherent selfishness.</p>
<p>And for some people, they aren&rsquo;t selfish enough, right?</p>
<p>I know plenty of people that are running around</p>
<p>trying to serve everybody</p>
<p>and then their health is crashing</p>
<p>or their mental health is crashing.</p>
<p>So it can cut any which way or all ways.</p>
<p>What sorts of practices do you incorporate</p>
<p>or just even thoughts within your own mind?</p>
<p>Do you use charts and lists?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re very regimented about your workouts,</p>
<p>building grip strength,</p>
<p>eccentric training zone two, et cetera.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t we also script out the things</p>
<p>to pay attention to each morning and day</p>
<p>as a list of to-dos?</p>
<p>Well, I have done those things, right?</p>
<p>So certainly, and I write about it in the book,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone away a couple of times, right?</p>
<p>So in 2017, I spent two weeks at a facility in Kentucky.</p>
<p>In 2020, I spent three weeks at a facility in Arizona.</p>
<p>And on the back end of that facility three years ago</p>
<p>when I got out, I mean,</p>
<p>I had a very clear list of daily things I needed to do.</p>
<p>And so at that point for about six months</p>
<p>following getting out of that stint of rehab,</p>
<p>I mean, I was,</p>
<p>I mean, God, the list of behaviors I was doing</p>
<p>every single day.</p>
<p>I mean, twice a day, standing in front of the mirror,</p>
<p>reading my list of affirmations,</p>
<p>writing in my journal every single day.</p>
<p>I had therapy every single day.</p>
<p>I mean, all of that stuff was highly regimented.</p>
<p>You know, today I would say there&rsquo;s no one single behavior</p>
<p>that is quote unquote mandated as part of my recovery.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most important thing</p>
<p>that does come up every day is</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>being mindful of and acting on as quickly as possible</p>
<p>every time I do something damaging to a relationship.</p>
<p>So I would say that like,</p>
<p>if you compare Formula One,</p>
<p>one of my favorites work by far,</p>
<p>if you compare Formula One 40 years ago</p>
<p>to Formula One today,</p>
<p>the difference is not in the number of accidents</p>
<p>that takes place.</p>
<p>The difference is in the fatality of those accidents.</p>
<p>There are just as many if not more accidents</p>
<p>in Formula One today.</p>
<p>The difference is nobody dies in those accidents.</p>
<p>The cars are so much safer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re engineered first for safety, second for performance.</p>
<p>It used to be the reverse.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why there was a day</p>
<p>when every second or third weekend a driver was killed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s catastrophic to imagine what took place</p>
<p>between the mid 60s and about the mid 80s in Formula One.</p>
<p>And similarly, I would say that the frequency</p>
<p>with which I have an interaction</p>
<p>with a person who matters to me</p>
<p>that is not the best interaction it could be</p>
<p>is only slightly less than what it was five years ago.</p>
<p>The difference is the severity of that is much lower</p>
<p>and more importantly, and most importantly,</p>
<p>the length of time between when I screw up</p>
<p>and when I make amends is infinitely shorter, right?</p>
<p>It went from being, I would never make amends</p>
<p>to if I&rsquo;m a dick to my wife,</p>
<p>I usually am trying to rectify it within a few minutes</p>
<p>or at most a couple of hours.</p>
<p>And that, and so it&rsquo;s really, you know,</p>
<p>one thing I learned throughout this journey was</p>
<p>if you hold yourself up to this goal of,</p>
<p>I have to be perfect, I have to be the perfect dad,</p>
<p>I have to be the perfect husband,</p>
<p>I have to be the perfect friend,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna set yourself up for failure</p>
<p>because you know, you&rsquo;re just not gonna be perfect.</p>
<p>But if instead you can say,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m gonna be perfect about</p>
<p>is repairing damage when I cause it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>
<p>You know, the other day,</p>
<p>I yelled at my son for something.</p>
<p>It was a while ago actually</p>
<p>because it was before I lost my voice.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>he was just doing something and he was wrong.</p>
<p>You know, like it was like,</p>
<p>he did something I told him 150 times not to do</p>
<p>and I yelled at him and punished him.</p>
<p>Like, you know, but I was way too harsh.</p>
<p>Like, cause basically I basically,</p>
<p>the first 27 times he did it, I didn&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>And then when I finally did,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I blew a gasket, right?</p>
<p>But what I realized is, yeah,</p>
<p>you could say, well, maybe it hurts a child to do that,</p>
<p>but I think it hurts them way less</p>
<p>if you can immediately go and repair and say,</p>
<p>hey buddy, daddy was a little harsh in that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to yell at you like that,</p>
<p>but what you did is wrong</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna get to go out and play right now</p>
<p>as a result of it, but I love you very much</p>
<p>and I want us to do better.</p>
<p>I want you to do better and not doing this thing</p>
<p>and I wanna do better and not yelling at you</p>
<p>when you do this thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not rocket science, right?</p>
<p>But I just think I used to live my life in a way</p>
<p>where all I did was break shit and never fix it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re living in a house where everything is broken.</p>
<p>Whereas now I still break things,</p>
<p>but now I clean up the mess</p>
<p>and oh, like all of a sudden the house is better.</p>
<p>What is your process for when there&rsquo;s a need for repair,</p>
<p>but you feel that it wasn&rsquo;t you,</p>
<p>it was somebody else&rsquo;s error or potential error.</p>
<p>So you very humbly express how you go</p>
<p>about repairing your errors,</p>
<p>but what about situations where a loved one, a coworker,</p>
<p>you feel screwed up or wronged you, right?</p>
<p>As many people do, we all do from time to time</p>
<p>feel this way.</p>
<p>Do you approach them and try and repair the situation</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a little bit less or far less control</p>
<p>when you know, than the situation you described.</p>
<p>And by the way, the situation you described,</p>
<p>I think is a perfect one</p>
<p>because I think we all screw up.</p>
<p>And so the answer to the second question</p>
<p>is sort of the answer to the first,</p>
<p>which is if everyone did what you were doing,</p>
<p>the world would be truly a far better place,</p>
<p>but not everyone&rsquo;s doing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So if you feel wronged,</p>
<p>assuming that wrong wasn&rsquo;t sociopathically motivated,</p>
<p>what is your process for going about repairing</p>
<p>a relationship fracture like that?</p>
<p>Again, this assumes that this is a relationship</p>
<p>that matters, right?</p>
<p>So in every interaction,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only really able to optimize around one thing</p>
<p>and you have to decide,</p>
<p>is this one thing that I&rsquo;m optimizing around</p>
<p>the relationship or is it the outcome?</p>
<p>I mean, there are other things to optimize around,</p>
<p>but you understand that those are different, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit.</p>
<p>I think I get it, but flesh that out a bit.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m at the market and I&rsquo;m trying to buy a new car</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sitting there talking to the car salesman,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a relationship, that&rsquo;s an interaction.</p>
<p>Now I want to buy this car for as little as possible</p>
<p>and he wants to sell the car for as much as possible.</p>
<p>Well, in that interaction,</p>
<p>my relationship with him means nothing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume I don&rsquo;t know this guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not like my best friend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimizing everything around the outcome.</p>
<p>So everything I do in negotiating</p>
<p>and in interacting with him personally</p>
<p>is based on getting the best outcome for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very selfish, right?</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, by the way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s doing the same, right, exactly.</p>
<p>But now, for example, pretend that you are the car salesman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re one of my closest friends</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s your dealership, it&rsquo;s your money.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t sell this thing to me at a loss.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to do that</p>
<p>because I want you to be able to make money.</p>
<p>And similarly, you care about me</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want me to overpay for this.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re negotiating</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re both trying to optimize for an outcome,</p>
<p>but our relationship also matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very different negotiation at that point.</p>
<p>And so I think I always try to ask myself this question</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m having some interpersonal conflict,</p>
<p>which is what am I optimizing for?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m having a quarrel with my wife,</p>
<p>I have to remind myself that the outcome is,</p>
<p>the objective or outcome is not necessarily</p>
<p>the top priority.</p>
<p>You know, being right all the time,</p>
<p>which is my default state,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just to be a bull in a China shop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to be authoritarian instead of authoritative.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t work if the relationship matters.</p>
<p>So to answer your question,</p>
<p>the first thing I&rsquo;m gonna ask myself if I feel slighted</p>
<p>is what is the nature of the relationship?</p>
<p>Is it even worth trying to do something about this?</p>
<p>And presumably you&rsquo;re asking the question</p>
<p>because the lens is yes.</p>
<p>This is someone who you care about more</p>
<p>than in just a transactional way.</p>
<p>You know, usually what I&rsquo;ve realized</p>
<p>is I can&rsquo;t try to approach the situation</p>
<p>without fully understanding myself.</p>
<p>And that takes a while.</p>
<p>So generally, and this is where, you know,</p>
<p>I still one to two times a week,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working with a therapist.</p>
<p>I have to kind of try to figure it out on my own</p>
<p>and then usually bounce it off a therapist and say,</p>
<p>well, I think this is why I&rsquo;m upset about this.</p>
<p>I think that when this person did this or said this,</p>
<p>I felt this.</p>
<p>First of all, am I correcting what I felt?</p>
<p>Because remember, sometimes you might,</p>
<p>at least for me, this was the case.</p>
<p>I would just feel anger in response to every interaction.</p>
<p>But what I didn&rsquo;t realize was that anger</p>
<p>was really just another emotion</p>
<p>that was superimposed on top of hurt</p>
<p>or superimposed on top of fear</p>
<p>or superimposed on top of shame</p>
<p>or superimposed on top of something else.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know how to articulate</p>
<p>any of those other emotions.</p>
<p>So the only thing I could really articulate was anger.</p>
<p>So if anger is the only thing I know</p>
<p>and anger is the only response I see,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very helpful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very insightful.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big part of it</p>
<p>is being able to deconstruct what I&rsquo;m feeling.</p>
<p>Oh, what I really feel is loss</p>
<p>or what I really feel is abandonment right now.</p>
<p>And that sometimes takes a while to figure out,</p>
<p>at least for me.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m still, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only a few years into this journey</p>
<p>and maybe other people figured these things out</p>
<p>when they were in their 20s.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re veterans,</p>
<p>they can do this more naturally.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s step one.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t really understand what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to try to approach this person</p>
<p>to say, this is how I feel.</p>
<p>This is, you know, how do you feel</p>
<p>and what are we optimizing for in this interaction?</p>
<p>Well, I certainly know you are not alone</p>
<p>in this sense that it&rsquo;s a process</p>
<p>and it takes a lot of time.</p>
<p>And on a case by case basis</p>
<p>can take a lot of time to figure out,</p>
<p>you know, exactly what one is feeling.</p>
<p>I think it really goes back to the coarseness of language</p>
<p>as a way to sort one&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>It was actually your other,</p>
<p>like, as we mentioned, Paul Conti,</p>
<p>who was one of your Stanford Medical School classmates,</p>
<p>but another previous guest on this podcast</p>
<p>who was also one of your medical school classmates,</p>
<p>Dr. Karl Deisseroth, right?</p>
<p>Psychiatrist and bioengineer of phenomenal stature</p>
<p>and doing amazing things in the world who said,</p>
<p>most of the time we have no idea how other people feel,</p>
<p>even though we think we do.</p>
<p>And most of the time we don&rsquo;t even know how we feel.</p>
<p>I mean, our ability to really know</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really feeling is terrible.</p>
<p>And yet we recognize the broad bins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pissed off, I&rsquo;m super happy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m relaxed, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>I mean, just think about how coarse that language is</p>
<p>for all the nuance and all the underlying things,</p>
<p>conscious and subconscious,</p>
<p>that could be driving an emotional state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite unbelievable.</p>
<p>Yeah, beyond the valence, positive versus negative,</p>
<p>that was about the extent of my emotional language</p>
<p>until somewhat recently.</p>
<p>Well, it strikes me you&rsquo;ve come a very long way.</p>
<p>Maybe you could share with us a little bit</p>
<p>about what you learned on these,</p>
<p>what you called retreats or,</p>
<p>I mean, in the book chapter you describe</p>
<p>deliberately going off to a treatment center,</p>
<p>multiple treatment centers over time</p>
<p>to really drill into this process</p>
<p>of understanding oneself better</p>
<p>and how one&rsquo;s current state of emotional processing</p>
<p>and emotional stability are influencing relationships</p>
<p>and the key importance of that.</p>
<p>Was there any kind of overriding theme for you?</p>
<p>For instance, could you trace back to specific events</p>
<p>or themes of childhood that made a lot of it make sense</p>
<p>or is it far more nuanced than that?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing I would say is</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that this was a very deliberate</p>
<p>and wonderful choice that I just decided</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go on a little self-healing journey,</p>
<p>but unfortunately that was not the case.</p>
<p>In both cases, in 2017 and in 2020,</p>
<p>I was as close to having no choice in the matter</p>
<p>as one can have.</p>
<p>So both of these experiences represented</p>
<p>total rock bottom moments in my life.</p>
<p>So these would have been the two lowest points in my life</p>
<p>for different reasons, but they were nevertheless</p>
<p>the two absolute low points in my life.</p>
<p>And I would say, you know, in the first instance,</p>
<p>I guess I could have chosen not to go,</p>
<p>but I would have lost everything that mattered</p>
<p>in my life at that point.</p>
<p>And I had, you know, our good friend, Paul Conti,</p>
<p>basically telling me that I needed to do this,</p>
<p>that I really needed to do this.</p>
<p>And in the second situation,</p>
<p>though completely different circumstances,</p>
<p>you might think how can one person</p>
<p>in just a span of three years find themselves</p>
<p>in a situation where they almost</p>
<p>without having any choice in the matter have to go away</p>
<p>to a place where you&rsquo;re basically locked up</p>
<p>without a phone for, you know, three weeks</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing 12 to 13 hours of therapy a day.</p>
<p>So nothing about this was something I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Nothing about this was pleasant.</p>
<p>I would describe these as the most difficult things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life, bar none.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done some difficult things in my life,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve always been physically difficult.</p>
<p>I love doing physically difficult things,</p>
<p>but this was emotionally the equivalent of, for me,</p>
<p>you know, climbing K2</p>
<p>and swimming the English Channel in the same month.</p>
<p>You know, something that just, I could, you couldn&rsquo;t fathom.</p>
<p>So with that said, yes, I learned a lot.</p>
<p>And I learned that people like me can be overly analytical</p>
<p>and that hyper analytical nature can lead you astray</p>
<p>when you think that your intellect</p>
<p>is giving you a fact-based explanation</p>
<p>for a set of circumstances and you rationalize them away.</p>
<p>Well, this happened to me when I was a kid,</p>
<p>but, you know, like I get it and it&rsquo;s not really a problem.</p>
<p>And as a result of that, you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>these are actually some positive things</p>
<p>that came out of that experience.</p>
<p>And I think the real aha moment in my journey,</p>
<p>which occurred on a day that I remember very well</p>
<p>was the day I finally dropped that.</p>
<p>I dropped that rationalization</p>
<p>and I allowed myself to experience</p>
<p>what a child would experience in that moment</p>
<p>and then understood</p>
<p>what the implications are for a child</p>
<p>going through these things.</p>
<p>And I think that was really the first time in my life</p>
<p>I ever accepted emotionally</p>
<p>something that I had intellectually always said,</p>
<p>yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, you know, that&rsquo;s just life</p>
<p>and those things happen and lots of worse things happen</p>
<p>to lots of people and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s not that once I emotionally accepted this,</p>
<p>I became a victim, it wasn&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>It just finally allowed me to realize,</p>
<p>oh, I can let that go now.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t have to, I don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to be a slave to the adaptations</p>
<p>that came from that.</p>
<p>I can surrender.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful and inspiring to me.</p>
<p>I think that, yeah, there&rsquo;s this incredible ability</p>
<p>that the human brain has to script a story</p>
<p>and to compare it to other people&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>
<p>And as you said, you know,</p>
<p>rationalize what are essentially emotional traumas</p>
<p>or physical traumas from the perspective of the adult.</p>
<p>But if I know one thing for sure,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll make it very clear, I&rsquo;m not a clinician,</p>
<p>but is that the brain doesn&rsquo;t discard of any circuitry.</p>
<p>We repurpose the same circuitry</p>
<p>we used as children, as adults.</p>
<p>And so the ability to go back to that and to parse it,</p>
<p>but as you point out,</p>
<p>not from an intellectual standpoint,</p>
<p>but from an emotional standpoint,</p>
<p>seems to be the really hard work.</p>
<p>Do you do that on a regular basis?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been done a handful of times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been exhausting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is the right word.</p>
<p>I would almost describe it as emotionally violent.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not something I need to revisit often truthfully.</p>
<p>I think that, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been done a finite number of times</p>
<p>and I think I&rsquo;ve captured so much value from it</p>
<p>that there are lots of other things I continue to do.</p>
<p>I mean, I use a system called dialectical behavioral therapy</p>
<p>that is a regular part of the therapy that I do,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have to go back to my childhood.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to go back to uncovering</p>
<p>and re-exploring a lot of that stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned the lessons</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s really about practicing the skills.</p>
<p>I know what I want now.</p>
<p>And I know, you know, you talk about plasticity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share one example,</p>
<p>which I know I wrote about in the book,</p>
<p>but just for folks listening that you&rsquo;ll appreciate.</p>
<p>So I, you know, just one of the,</p>
<p>one of the hallmarks of my existence has always been, you know,</p>
<p>just an insane amount of anger and rage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been there as long as I&rsquo;ve known.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have a conscious memory of not having rage, right?</p>
<p>So earliest memories of life when I&rsquo;m five years old,</p>
<p>I have rage like you can&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a problem all my life.</p>
<p>So as a teenager,</p>
<p>if I go more than two weeks without punching a hole</p>
<p>in the wall of our house, it&rsquo;s a miracle.</p>
<p>I mean, I am so good at drywall.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t believe how good I am</p>
<p>for all the stuff I have to repair around our house.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m breaking windows.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m breaking, it just doesn&rsquo;t, like I just,</p>
<p>and so in a way, and of course I rationalized</p>
<p>how much boxing saved my life</p>
<p>because I had this amazing outlet for my rage, right?</p>
<p>If you, I got to basically exercise six hours a day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hitting punching bags in people all day long,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a beautiful outlet that keeps me out of jail.</p>
<p>And a big part of that rage was inward, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not rocket science to understand</p>
<p>that a person who has that much hatred for everyone</p>
<p>has an enormous amount for themselves.</p>
<p>And so one of the things I didn&rsquo;t realize was happening</p>
<p>was what my inner monologue was,</p>
<p>because as you can appreciate,</p>
<p>your inner monologue is so frequent</p>
<p>and ubiquitous and present</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s easy to almost forget that it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the sort of dangerous part about it, right?</p>
<p>Is kind of the David Foster Wallace, this is water thing.</p>
<p>If fish are swimming through water,</p>
<p>the water&rsquo;s everywhere,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even realize they&rsquo;re in water.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize the subconscious stream of thoughts</p>
<p>that constantly flow.</p>
<p>But eventually I became aware of just</p>
<p>what that self-talk was.</p>
<p>And it is, it was no longer the case.</p>
<p>It was the angriest, the most violent</p>
<p>self-talk you can imagine.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like,</p>
<p>there is no mistake that I could make</p>
<p>that was anything other than my perfect, perfect standard</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t result in what I would call</p>
<p>my inner Bobby Knight going ballistic.</p>
<p>So it just didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Like it sounds silly under, it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t perfectly cook a steak,</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t perfectly nail something I was doing,</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t do anything that was perfect</p>
<p>at what I described as match grade perfect,</p>
<p>I mean, I would want to beat myself to a pulp</p>
<p>and I would scream at myself.</p>
<p>I mean, it just, again, it&rsquo;s hard to describe</p>
<p>and I hope that most people listening to this</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand what that feels like.</p>
<p>Well, it became very clear that that had to change</p>
<p>because when you are that,</p>
<p>when you hate yourself that much,</p>
<p>by definition you are going to be</p>
<p>an insufferable prick to everybody else.</p>
<p>Like, because you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to spill into how you interact with the world.</p>
<p>So I was working with a therapist</p>
<p>who was one of the people who was sending me</p>
<p>to this place in Arizona.</p>
<p>And basically it became clear that,</p>
<p>you know, they proposed that I could shed this trait</p>
<p>if I was willing to do a certain amount of work.</p>
<p>And I was like, there&rsquo;s no chance.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m 47 years old.</p>
<p>This is the only way I&rsquo;ve ever interacted with myself.</p>
<p>How in the world could this be undone?</p>
<p>It would take another 40 years to undo this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, no, no, here&rsquo;s this exercise</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>So the exercise was every single time I did something</p>
<p>where I would have that self-talk,</p>
<p>I would have to immediately stop myself</p>
<p>and pretend that it wasn&rsquo;t me that just did that,</p>
<p>but it was one of my closest friends.</p>
<p>And instead I would audibly speak to that person.</p>
<p>There was nobody else there,</p>
<p>but speak to that person as though</p>
<p>they are the one that made the mistake.</p>
<p>And I was to record that on my phone.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m out there shooting my bow and arrow</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t get a bullseye,</p>
<p>instead of screaming at myself,</p>
<p>I have to say, oh, imagine it&rsquo;s my buddy JR</p>
<p>who just missed that shot.</p>
<p>What would I say to him?</p>
<p>Pick up the phone or pull out the phone</p>
<p>and say, of course, something different.</p>
<p>And of course, what I would say in that situation</p>
<p>was much kinder.</p>
<p>I mean, infinitely kinder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if I&rsquo;m saying it to my closest friend,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say it in a very kind way.</p>
<p>And I had to take a copy of that audio</p>
<p>and text it to my therapist.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Talk about vulnerability.</p>
<p>I was all on board this practice</p>
<p>until you mentioned that at which point.</p>
<p>And I trust my therapist to a very deep level,</p>
<p>but I thought, wow, that&rsquo;s a mountain.</p>
<p>Well, this poor person got a lot of text messages,</p>
<p>a lot of audio files.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the part that just blows my mind.</p>
<p>It only took, I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t remember exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to go back to look at my journals.</p>
<p>It only took about four months to get rid of Bobby Knight.</p>
<p>Like, you know, again, we had kind of a mental model</p>
<p>for what this looked like,</p>
<p>which was Bobby Knight was the chairman of the board.</p>
<p>He sat in the boardroom and nobody else got to talk.</p>
<p>And for those that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Bobby Knight had a terrible temper.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>The worst. Right.</p>
<p>This is the guy that was throwing chairs</p>
<p>across the basketball court.</p>
<p>Level 11. Yep.</p>
<p>Out of 10.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, like we got to the point</p>
<p>where Bobby Knight is not even in the boardroom anymore.</p>
<p>In fact, as I say this today,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really remember what he sounded like.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s amazing to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had some really amazing opportunities</p>
<p>to bring him back.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m making fewer mistakes, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m better today than I was three years ago</p>
<p>at all the things that I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m actually probably worse in many regards.</p>
<p>But the difference is, you know,</p>
<p>I can communicate with myself.</p>
<p>I think I can say this.</p>
<p>I think I can say lovingly, right?</p>
<p>And maybe not as lovingly as some people can.</p>
<p>I still think I&rsquo;m probably</p>
<p>maybe just a little higher standard with myself</p>
<p>than maybe I need to be at times.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just not beating myself up like I used to.</p>
<p>And I think by extension,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beating other people up a lot less.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know the extent</p>
<p>to which your internal narrative</p>
<p>reflects the narrative that others have about you.</p>
<p>But first of all, I want to thank you</p>
<p>for sharing what you just shared.</p>
<p>I think as a practical step it,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve never heard of before,</p>
<p>but certainly represents this incredible phenomenon</p>
<p>of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Because four months sounds like a bit of time</p>
<p>and yet you were 47 years old.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 47 years of accumulated,</p>
<p>just absolutely berating self-talk is what it sounds like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that people can think about</p>
<p>for their own purposes and their own challenges.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve read the book twice now and love it.</p>
<p>As I put in my endorsement of it,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not just informative,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s indeed important</p>
<p>because it centers on so many of the key actionable items</p>
<p>related to healthspan and lifespan,</p>
<p>vitality, longevity,</p>
<p>whatever people want to call these things</p>
<p>that are essential.</p>
<p>But also the section on emotional health</p>
<p>was absolutely profound for me.</p>
<p>It inspired a huge number of changes.</p>
<p>And the book as a whole</p>
<p>represents a very important contribution to everybody.</p>
<p>There are numerous points</p>
<p>and I would say every chapter is applicable to everybody.</p>
<p>And there are very few books out there</p>
<p>that are really like that.</p>
<p>So I want to thank you for that</p>
<p>and especially for including the section on emotional health</p>
<p>and especially for sharing what you did today</p>
<p>because I think it doesn&rsquo;t just take a bit of vulnerability</p>
<p>but a ton of vulnerability and humility</p>
<p>to be able to share what you just shared.</p>
<p>And my only request or wish is that you also</p>
<p>hopefully internalize it,</p>
<p>the tremendous gift that you&rsquo;re giving everybody</p>
<p>through coming on podcasts like this,</p>
<p>doing your own podcasts, writing the book.</p>
<p>I look out on the landscape of front-facing,</p>
<p>public-facing health out there</p>
<p>and you sit not alone,</p>
<p>but in a unique stance as the medical doctor</p>
<p>that I do believe that people trust the very most</p>
<p>because of the fact that you have that intense rigor,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even say your desire,</p>
<p>your absolute obsession with measurement and precision.</p>
<p>Many of the things that a moment ago you were pointing to</p>
<p>as potentially hazards for your emotional life,</p>
<p>but that serve all of us, the general public,</p>
<p>so preciously and with just incalculable value.</p>
<p>So I hope that internalizes as well.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll even weave into your self-talk.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;d need to send you a script every day,</p>
<p>but in all seriousness,</p>
<p>I also want to thank you for taking the time today.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s a personal thing,</p>
<p>I really want to thank you</p>
<p>for being an amazing colleague to me in the podcast space,</p>
<p>in the health and medicine space, whatever that is,</p>
<p>and also just an incredible friend.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a tremendous source of support and guidance</p>
<p>in every one of the domains that we talked about today</p>
<p>and many more.</p>
<p>And again, I just want to say</p>
<p>that this emotional health component, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not just vital.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the most vital of all of them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve just made numerous important contributions</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just want to thank you for sharing</p>
<p>that you clearly put everything you have</p>
<p>into everything you do.</p>
<p>Thank you, Peter.</p>
<p>Andrew, thank you.</p>
