    <p>The following is a conversation with Chris Sampson.</p>
<p>He was a CTO of the Google self driving car team,</p>
<p>a key engineer and leader behind the Carnegie Mellon</p>
<p>University autonomous vehicle entries in the DARPA Grand</p>
<p>Challenges and the winner of the DARPA Urban Challenge.</p>
<p>Today, he&rsquo;s the CEO of Aurora Innovation, an autonomous</p>
<p>vehicle software company.</p>
<p>He started with Sterling Anderson,</p>
<p>who was the former director of Tesla Autopilot,</p>
<p>and drew back now, Uber&rsquo;s former autonomy and perception lead.</p>
<p>Chris is one of the top roboticists and autonomous</p>
<p>vehicle experts in the world, and a longtime voice</p>
<p>of reason in a space that is shrouded</p>
<p>in both mystery and hype.</p>
<p>He both acknowledges the incredible challenges</p>
<p>involved in solving the problem of autonomous driving</p>
<p>and is working hard to solve it.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Chris Sampson.</p>
<p>You were part of both the DARPA Grand Challenge</p>
<p>and the DARPA Urban Challenge teams</p>
<p>at CMU with Red Whitaker.</p>
<p>What technical or philosophical things</p>
<p>have you learned from these races?</p>
<p>I think the high order bit was that it could be done.</p>
<p>I think that was the thing that was</p>
<p>incredible about the first of the Grand Challenges,</p>
<p>that I remember I was a grad student at Carnegie Mellon,</p>
<p>and there was kind of this dichotomy of it</p>
<p>seemed really hard, so that would</p>
<p>be cool and interesting.</p>
<p>But at the time, we were the only robotics institute around,</p>
<p>and so if we went into it and fell on our faces,</p>
<p>that would be embarrassing.</p>
<p>So I think just having the will to go do it,</p>
<p>to try to do this thing that at the time</p>
<p>was marked as darn near impossible,</p>
<p>and then after a couple of tries,</p>
<p>be able to actually make it happen,</p>
<p>I think that was really exciting.</p>
<p>But at which point did you believe it was possible?</p>
<p>Did you from the very beginning?</p>
<p>Did you personally?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re one of the lead engineers.</p>
<p>You actually had to do a lot of the work.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was the technical director there,</p>
<p>and did a lot of the work, along with a bunch</p>
<p>of other really good people.</p>
<p>Did I believe it could be done?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Why would you go do something you thought</p>
<p>was completely impossible?</p>
<p>We thought it was going to be hard.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know how we were going to be able to do it.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;d be able to do it the first time.</p>
<p>Turns out we couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That, yeah, I guess you have to.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a certain benefit to naivete, right?</p>
<p>That if you don&rsquo;t know how hard something really is,</p>
<p>you try different things, and it gives you an opportunity</p>
<p>that others who are wiser maybe don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>What were the biggest pain points?</p>
<p>Mechanical, sensors, hardware, software,</p>
<p>algorithms for mapping, localization,</p>
<p>just general perception, control?</p>
<p>Like hardware, software, first of all?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the joy of this field, is that it&rsquo;s all hard</p>
<p>and that you have to be good at each part of it.</p>
<p>So for the urban challenges, if I look back at it from today,</p>
<p>it should be easy today, that it was a static world.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t other actors moving through it,</p>
<p>is what that means.</p>
<p>It was out in the desert, so you get really good GPS.</p>
<p>So that went, and we could map it roughly.</p>
<p>And so in retrospect now, it&rsquo;s within the realm of things</p>
<p>we could do back then.</p>
<p>Just actually getting the vehicle and the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of engineering work</p>
<p>to get the vehicle so that we could control it and drive it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still a pain today, but it was even more so back then.</p>
<p>And then the uncertainty of exactly what they wanted us to do</p>
<p>was part of the challenge as well.</p>
<p>Right, you didn&rsquo;t actually know the track heading in here.</p>
<p>You knew approximately, but you didn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>know the route that was going to be taken.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, we didn&rsquo;t know the route.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even really, the way the rules had been described,</p>
<p>you had to kind of guess.</p>
<p>So if you think back to that challenge,</p>
<p>the idea was that the government would give us,</p>
<p>the DARPA would give us a set of waypoints</p>
<p>and kind of the width that you had to stay within</p>
<p>between the line that went between each of those waypoints.</p>
<p>And so the most devious thing they could have done</p>
<p>is set a kilometer wide corridor across a field</p>
<p>of scrub brush and rocks and said, go figure it out.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it really, it turned into basically driving</p>
<p>along a set of trails, which is much more relevant</p>
<p>to the application they were looking for.</p>
<p>But no, it was a hell of a thing back in the day.</p>
<p>So the legend, Red, was kind of leading that effort</p>
<p>in terms of just broadly speaking.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a leader now.</p>
<p>What have you learned from Red about leadership?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a couple things.</p>
<p>One is go and try those really hard things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where there is an incredible opportunity.</p>
<p>I think the other big one, though,</p>
<p>is to see people for who they can be, not who they are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that I actually,</p>
<p>one of the deepest lessons I learned from Red</p>
<p>was that he would look at undergraduates</p>
<p>or graduate students and empower them to be leaders,</p>
<p>to have responsibility, to do great things</p>
<p>that I think another person might look at them</p>
<p>and think, oh, well, that&rsquo;s just an undergraduate student.</p>
<p>What could they know?</p>
<p>And so I think that kind of trust but verify,</p>
<p>have confidence in what people can become,</p>
<p>I think is a really powerful thing.</p>
<p>So through that, let&rsquo;s just fast forward through the history.</p>
<p>Can you maybe talk through the technical evolution</p>
<p>of autonomous vehicle systems</p>
<p>from the first two Grand Challenges to the Urban Challenge</p>
<p>to today, are there major shifts in your mind</p>
<p>or is it the same kind of technology just made more robust?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s been some big, big steps.</p>
<p>So for the Grand Challenge,</p>
<p>the real technology that unlocked that was HD mapping.</p>
<p>Prior to that, a lot of the off road robotics work</p>
<p>had been done without any real prior model</p>
<p>of what the vehicle was going to encounter.</p>
<p>And so that innovation that the fact that we could get</p>
<p>decimeter resolution models was really a big deal.</p>
<p>And that allowed us to kind of bound the complexity</p>
<p>of the driving problem the vehicle had</p>
<p>and allowed it to operate at speed</p>
<p>because we could assume things about the environment</p>
<p>that it was going to encounter.</p>
<p>So that was the big step there.</p>
<p>For the Urban Challenge,</p>
<p>one of the big technological innovations there</p>
<p>was the multi beam LIDAR</p>
<p>and being able to generate high resolution,</p>
<p>mid to long range 3D models of the world</p>
<p>and use that for understanding the world around the vehicle.</p>
<p>And that was really kind of a game changing technology.</p>
<p>In parallel with that,</p>
<p>we saw a bunch of other technologies</p>
<p>that had been kind of converging</p>
<p>half their day in the sun.</p>
<p>So Bayesian estimation had been,</p>
<p>SLAM had been a big field in robotics.</p>
<p>You would go to a conference a couple of years before that</p>
<p>and every paper would effectively have SLAM somewhere in it.</p>
<p>And so seeing that the Bayesian estimation techniques</p>
<p>play out on a very visible stage,</p>
<p>I thought that was pretty exciting to see.</p>
<p>And mostly SLAM was done based on LIDAR at that time.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in fact, we weren&rsquo;t really doing SLAM per se</p>
<p>in real time because we had a model ahead of time,</p>
<p>we had a roadmap, but we were doing localization.</p>
<p>And we were using the LIDAR or the cameras</p>
<p>depending on who exactly was doing it</p>
<p>to localize to a model of the world.</p>
<p>And I thought that was a big step</p>
<p>from kind of naively trusting GPS, INS before that.</p>
<p>And again, lots of work had been going on in this field.</p>
<p>Certainly this was not doing anything</p>
<p>particularly innovative in SLAM or in localization,</p>
<p>but it was seeing that technology necessary</p>
<p>in a real application on a big stage,</p>
<p>I thought was very cool.</p>
<p>So for the urban challenge,</p>
<p>those are already maps constructed offline in general.</p>
<p>And did people do that individually,</p>
<p>did individual teams do it individually</p>
<p>so they had their own different approaches there</p>
<p>or did everybody kind of share that information</p>
<p>at least intuitively?</p>
<p>So DARPA gave all the teams a model of the world, a map.</p>
<p>And then one of the things that we had to figure out</p>
<p>back then was, and it&rsquo;s still one of these things</p>
<p>that trips people up today</p>
<p>is actually the coordinate system.</p>
<p>So you get a latitude longitude</p>
<p>and to so many decimal places,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really care about kind of the ellipsoid</p>
<p>of the earth that&rsquo;s being used.</p>
<p>But when you want to get to 10 centimeter</p>
<p>or centimeter resolution,</p>
<p>you care whether the coordinate system is NADS 83</p>
<p>or WGS 84 or these are different ways to describe</p>
<p>both the kind of non sphericalness of the earth,</p>
<p>but also kind of the, I think,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember which one,</p>
<p>the tectonic shifts that are happening</p>
<p>and how to transform the global datum as a function of that.</p>
<p>So getting a map and then actually matching it to reality</p>
<p>to centimeter resolution, that was kind of interesting</p>
<p>and fun back then.</p>
<p>So how much work was the perception doing there?</p>
<p>So how much were you relying on localization based on maps</p>
<p>without using perception to register to the maps?</p>
<p>And I guess the question is how advanced</p>
<p>was perception at that point?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly behind where we are today, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more than a decade since the urban challenge.</p>
<p>But the core of it was there.</p>
<p>That we were tracking vehicles.</p>
<p>We had to do that at 100 plus meter range</p>
<p>because we had to merge with other traffic.</p>
<p>We were using, again, Bayesian estimates</p>
<p>for state of these vehicles.</p>
<p>We had to deal with a bunch of the problems</p>
<p>that you think of today,</p>
<p>of predicting where that vehicle&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a few seconds into the future.</p>
<p>We had to deal with the fact</p>
<p>that there were multiple hypotheses for that</p>
<p>because a vehicle at an intersection might be going right</p>
<p>or it might be going straight</p>
<p>or it might be making a left turn.</p>
<p>And we had to deal with the challenge of the fact</p>
<p>that our behavior was going to impact the behavior</p>
<p>of that other operator.</p>
<p>And we did a lot of that in relatively naive ways,</p>
<p>but it kind of worked.</p>
<p>Still had to have some kind of solution.</p>
<p>And so where does that, 10 years later,</p>
<p>where does that take us today</p>
<p>from that artificial city construction</p>
<p>to real cities to the urban environment?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the biggest thing</p>
<p>is that the actors are truly unpredictable.</p>
<p>That most of the time, the drivers on the road,</p>
<p>the other road users are out there behaving well,</p>
<p>but every once in a while they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>The variety of other vehicles is, you have all of them.</p>
<p>In terms of behavior, in terms of perception, or both?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>Back then we didn&rsquo;t have to deal with cyclists,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have to deal with pedestrians,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to deal with traffic lights.</p>
<p>The scale over which that you have to operate is now</p>
<p>is much larger than the air base</p>
<p>that we were thinking about back then.</p>
<p>So what, easy question,</p>
<p>what do you think is the hardest part about driving?</p>
<p>Easy question.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure nothing really jumps out at you as one thing,</p>
<p>but in the jump from the urban challenge to the real world,</p>
<p>is there something that&rsquo;s a particular,</p>
<p>you foresee as very serious, difficult challenge?</p>
<p>I think the most fundamental difference</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re doing it for real.</p>
<p>That in that environment,</p>
<p>it was both a limited complexity environment</p>
<p>because certain actors weren&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>because the roads were maintained,</p>
<p>there were barriers keeping people separate</p>
<p>from robots at the time,</p>
<p>and it only had to work for 60 miles.</p>
<p>Which, looking at it from 2006,</p>
<p>it had to work for 60 miles, right?</p>
<p>Looking at it from now,</p>
<p>we want things that will go and drive</p>
<p>for half a million miles,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a different game.</p>
<p>So how important,</p>
<p>you said LiDAR came into the game early on,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really the primary driver</p>
<p>of autonomous vehicles today as a sensor.</p>
<p>So how important is the role of LiDAR</p>
<p>in the sensor suite in the near term?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>I believe, but I also believe that cameras are essential,</p>
<p>and I believe the radar is essential.</p>
<p>I think that you really need to use</p>
<p>the composition of data from these different sensors</p>
<p>if you want the thing to really be robust.</p>
<p>The question I wanna ask,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see if we can untangle it,</p>
<p>is what are your thoughts on the Elon Musk</p>
<p>provocative statement that LiDAR is a crutch,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a kind of, I guess, growing pains,</p>
<p>and that much of the perception task</p>
<p>can be done with cameras?</p>
<p>So I think it is undeniable</p>
<p>that people walk around without lasers in their foreheads,</p>
<p>and they can get into vehicles and drive them,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s an existence proof</p>
<p>that you can drive using passive vision.</p>
<p>No doubt, can&rsquo;t argue with that.</p>
<p>In terms of sensors, yeah, so there&rsquo;s proof.</p>
<p>Yeah, in terms of sensors, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an example that we all go do it,</p>
<p>many of us every day.</p>
<p>In terms of LiDAR being a crutch, sure.</p>
<p>But in the same way that the combustion engine</p>
<p>was a crutch on the path to an electric vehicle,</p>
<p>in the same way that any technology ultimately gets</p>
<p>replaced by some superior technology in the future,</p>
<p>and really the way that I look at this</p>
<p>is that the way we get around on the ground,</p>
<p>the way that we use transportation is broken,</p>
<p>and that we have this, I think the number I saw this morning,</p>
<p>37,000 Americans killed last year on our roads,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just not acceptable.</p>
<p>And so any technology that we can bring to bear</p>
<p>that accelerates this self driving technology</p>
<p>coming to market and saving lives</p>
<p>is technology we should be using.</p>
<p>And it feels just arbitrary to say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m not okay with using lasers</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s whatever,</p>
<p>but I am okay with using an eight megapixel camera</p>
<p>or a 16 megapixel camera.</p>
<p>These are just bits of technology,</p>
<p>and we should be taking the best technology</p>
<p>from the tool bin that allows us to go and solve a problem.</p>
<p>The question I often talk to, well, obviously you do as well,</p>
<p>to sort of automotive companies,</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s one word that comes up more often</p>
<p>than anything, it&rsquo;s cost, and trying to drive costs down.</p>
<p>So while it&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s a tragic number, the 37,000,</p>
<p>the question is, and I&rsquo;m not the one asking this question</p>
<p>because I hate this question,</p>
<p>but we want to find the cheapest sensor suite</p>
<p>that creates a safe vehicle.</p>
<p>So in that uncomfortable trade off,</p>
<p>do you foresee LiDAR coming down in cost in the future,</p>
<p>or do you see a day where level four autonomy</p>
<p>is possible without LiDAR?</p>
<p>I see both of those, but it&rsquo;s really a matter of time.</p>
<p>And I think really, maybe I would talk to the question</p>
<p>you asked about the cheapest sensor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s actually what you want.</p>
<p>What you want is a sensor suite that is economically viable.</p>
<p>And then after that, everything is about margin</p>
<p>and driving costs out of the system.</p>
<p>What you also want is a sensor suite that works.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s great to tell a story about</p>
<p>how it would be better to have a self driving system</p>
<p>with a $50 sensor instead of a $500 sensor.</p>
<p>But if the $500 sensor makes it work</p>
<p>and the $50 sensor doesn&rsquo;t work, who cares?</p>
<p>So long as you can actually have an economic opportunity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an economic opportunity there.</p>
<p>And the economic opportunity is important</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you actually have a sustainable business</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how you can actually see this come to scale</p>
<p>and be out in the world.</p>
<p>And so when I look at LiDAR,</p>
<p>I see a technology that has no underlying</p>
<p>fundamentally expense to it, fundamental expense to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be more expensive than an imager</p>
<p>because CMOS processes or FAP processes</p>
<p>are dramatically more scalable than mechanical processes.</p>
<p>But we still should be able to drive costs down</p>
<p>substantially on that side.</p>
<p>And then I also do think that with the right business model</p>
<p>you can absorb more,</p>
<p>certainly more cost on the bill of materials.</p>
<p>Yeah, if the sensor suite works, extra value is provided,</p>
<p>thereby you don&rsquo;t need to drive costs down to zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the basic economics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about your intuition</p>
<p>that level two autonomy is problematic</p>
<p>because of the human factor of vigilance,</p>
<p>decrement, complacency, over trust and so on,</p>
<p>just us being human.</p>
<p>We over trust the system,</p>
<p>we start doing even more so partaking</p>
<p>in the secondary activities like smartphones and so on.</p>
<p>Have your views evolved on this point in either direction?</p>
<p>Can you speak to it?</p>
<p>So, and I want to be really careful</p>
<p>because sometimes this gets twisted in a way</p>
<p>that I certainly didn&rsquo;t intend.</p>
<p>So active safety systems are a really important technology</p>
<p>that we should be pursuing and integrating into vehicles.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an opportunity in the near term</p>
<p>to reduce accidents, reduce fatalities,</p>
<p>and we should be pushing on that.</p>
<p>Level two systems are systems</p>
<p>where the vehicle is controlling two axes.</p>
<p>So braking and throttle slash steering.</p>
<p>And I think there are variants of level two systems</p>
<p>that are supporting the driver.</p>
<p>That absolutely we should encourage to be out there.</p>
<p>Where I think there&rsquo;s a real challenge</p>
<p>is in the human factors part around this</p>
<p>and the misconception from the public</p>
<p>around the capability set that that enables</p>
<p>and the trust that they should have in it.</p>
<p>And that is where I kind of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually incrementally more concerned</p>
<p>around level three systems</p>
<p>and how exactly a level two system is marketed and delivered</p>
<p>and how much effort people have put into those human factors.</p>
<p>So I still believe several things around this.</p>
<p>One is people will overtrust the technology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen over the last few weeks</p>
<p>a spate of people sleeping in their Tesla.</p>
<p>I watched an episode last night of Trevor Noah</p>
<p>talking about this and him,</p>
<p>this is a smart guy who has a lot of resources</p>
<p>at his disposal describing a Tesla as a self driving car</p>
<p>and that why shouldn&rsquo;t people be sleeping in their Tesla?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, because it&rsquo;s not a self driving car</p>
<p>and it is not intended to be</p>
<p>and these people will almost certainly die at some point</p>
<p>or hurt other people.</p>
<p>And so we need to really be thoughtful</p>
<p>about how that technology is described</p>
<p>and brought to market.</p>
<p>I also think that because of the economic challenges</p>
<p>we were just talking about,</p>
<p>that these level two driver assistance systems,</p>
<p>that technology path will diverge</p>
<p>from the technology path that we need to be on</p>
<p>to actually deliver truly self driving vehicles,</p>
<p>ones where you can get in it and drive it.</p>
<p>Can get in it and sleep and have the equivalent</p>
<p>or better safety than a human driver behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Because again, the economics are very different</p>
<p>in those two worlds and so that leads</p>
<p>to divergent technology.</p>
<p>So you just don&rsquo;t see the economics</p>
<p>of gradually increasing from level two</p>
<p>and doing so quickly enough</p>
<p>to where it doesn&rsquo;t cause safety, critical safety concerns.</p>
<p>You believe that it needs to diverge at this point</p>
<p>into basically different routes.</p>
<p>And really that comes back to what are those L2</p>
<p>and L1 systems doing?</p>
<p>And they are driver assistance functions</p>
<p>where the people that are marketing that responsibly</p>
<p>are being very clear and putting human factors in place</p>
<p>such that the driver is actually responsible for the vehicle</p>
<p>and that the technology is there to support the driver.</p>
<p>And the safety cases that are built around those</p>
<p>are dependent on that driver attention and attentiveness.</p>
<p>And at that point, you can kind of give up</p>
<p>to some degree for economic reasons,</p>
<p>you can give up on say false negatives.</p>
<p>And the way to think about this</p>
<p>is for a four collision mitigation braking system,</p>
<p>if it half the times the driver missed a vehicle</p>
<p>in front of it, it hit the brakes</p>
<p>and brought the vehicle to a stop,</p>
<p>that would be an incredible, incredible advance</p>
<p>in safety on our roads, right?</p>
<p>That would be equivalent to seat belts.</p>
<p>But it would mean that if that vehicle</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t being monitored, it would hit one out of two cars.</p>
<p>And so economically, that&rsquo;s a perfectly good solution</p>
<p>for a driver assistance system.</p>
<p>What you should do at that point,</p>
<p>if you can get it to work 50% of the time,</p>
<p>is drive the cost out of that</p>
<p>so you can get it on as many vehicles as possible.</p>
<p>But driving the cost out of it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t drive up performance on the false negative case.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll continue to not have a technology</p>
<p>that could really be available for a self driven vehicle.</p>
<p>So clearly the communication,</p>
<p>and this probably applies to all four vehicles as well,</p>
<p>the marketing and communication</p>
<p>of what the technology is actually capable of,</p>
<p>how hard it is, how easy it is,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff is highly problematic.</p>
<p>So say everybody in the world was perfectly communicated</p>
<p>and were made to be completely aware</p>
<p>of every single technology out there,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s able to do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re maybe getting into philosophical ground.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have a level two vehicle</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t over trust it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>If people truly understood the risks and internalized it,</p>
<p>then sure, you could do that safely.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a world that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>The people are going to,</p>
<p>if the facts are put in front of them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna then combine that with their experience.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re using an L2 system</p>
<p>and they go up and down the 101 every day</p>
<p>and they do that for a month.</p>
<p>And it just worked every day for a month.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s pretty compelling at that point,</p>
<p>just even if you know the statistics,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, well, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s something funny about those.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re driving in difficult places.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve seen it with my own eyes, it works.</p>
<p>And the problem is that that sample size that they have,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s 30 miles up and down,</p>
<p>so 60 miles times 30 days,</p>
<p>so 60, 180, 1,800 miles.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a drop in the bucket</p>
<p>compared to the, what, 85 million miles between fatalities.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t really have a true estimate</p>
<p>based on their personal experience of the real risks,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re gonna trust it anyway,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard not to.</p>
<p>It worked for a month, what&rsquo;s gonna change?</p>
<p>So even if you start a perfect understanding of the system,</p>
<p>your own experience will make it drift.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a big concern.</p>
<p>Over a year, over two years even,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be months.</p>
<p>And I think that as this technology moves</p>
<p>from what I would say is kind of the more technology savvy</p>
<p>ownership group to the mass market,</p>
<p>you may be able to have some of those folks</p>
<p>who are really familiar with technology,</p>
<p>they may be able to internalize it better.</p>
<p>And your kind of immunization</p>
<p>against this kind of false risk assessment</p>
<p>might last longer,</p>
<p>but as folks who aren&rsquo;t as savvy about that</p>
<p>read the material and they compare that</p>
<p>to their personal experience,</p>
<p>I think there it&rsquo;s going to move more quickly.</p>
<p>So your work, the program that you&rsquo;ve created at Google</p>
<p>and now at Aurora is focused more on the second path</p>
<p>of creating full autonomy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s such a fascinating,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the most interesting AI problems</p>
<p>of the century, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I just talked to a lot of people,</p>
<p>just regular people, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>my mom, about autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>and you begin to grapple with ideas</p>
<p>of giving your life control over to a machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s philosophically interesting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s practically interesting.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about safety.</p>
<p>How do you think we demonstrate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve spoken about metrics in the past,</p>
<p>how do you think we demonstrate to the world</p>
<p>that an autonomous vehicle, an Aurora system is safe?</p>
<p>This is one where it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>because there isn&rsquo;t a soundbite answer.</p>
<p>That we have to show a combination of work</p>
<p>that was done diligently and thoughtfully,</p>
<p>and this is where something like a functional safety process</p>
<p>is part of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like here&rsquo;s the way we did the work,</p>
<p>that means that we were very thorough.</p>
<p>So if you believe that what we said</p>
<p>about this is the way we did it,</p>
<p>then you can have some confidence</p>
<p>that we were thorough in the engineering work</p>
<p>we put into the system.</p>
<p>And then on top of that,</p>
<p>to kind of demonstrate that we weren&rsquo;t just thorough,</p>
<p>we were actually good at what we did,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a kind of a collection of evidence</p>
<p>in terms of demonstrating that the capabilities</p>
<p>worked the way we thought they did,</p>
<p>statistically and to whatever degree</p>
<p>we can demonstrate that,</p>
<p>both in some combination of simulations,</p>
<p>some combination of unit testing</p>
<p>and decomposition testing,</p>
<p>and then some part of it will be on road data.</p>
<p>And I think the way we&rsquo;ll ultimately</p>
<p>convey this to the public</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;ll be clearly some conversation</p>
<p>with the public about it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll kind of invoke the kind of the trusted nodes</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ll spend more time</p>
<p>being able to go into more depth with folks like NHTSA</p>
<p>and other federal and state regulatory bodies</p>
<p>and kind of given that they are</p>
<p>operating in the public interest and they&rsquo;re trusted,</p>
<p>that if we can show enough work to them</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re convinced,</p>
<p>then I think we&rsquo;re in a pretty good place.</p>
<p>That means you work with people</p>
<p>that are essentially experts at safety</p>
<p>to try to discuss and show.</p>
<p>Do you think, the answer&rsquo;s probably no,</p>
<p>but just in case,</p>
<p>do you think there exists a metric?</p>
<p>So currently people have been using</p>
<p>number of disengagements.</p>
<p>And it quickly turns into a marketing scheme</p>
<p>to sort of you alter the experiments you run to adjust.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve spoken that you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t love it.</p>
<p>No, in fact, I was on the record telling DMV</p>
<p>that I thought this was not a great metric.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to create a metric,</p>
<p>a number that could demonstrate safety</p>
<p>outside of fatalities?</p>
<p>So I do.</p>
<p>And I think that it won&rsquo;t be just one number.</p>
<p>So as we are internally grappling with this,</p>
<p>and at some point we&rsquo;ll be able to talk</p>
<p>more publicly about it,</p>
<p>is how do we think about human performance</p>
<p>in different tasks,</p>
<p>say detecting traffic lights</p>
<p>or safely making a left turn across traffic?</p>
<p>And what do we think the failure rates are</p>
<p>for those different capabilities for people?</p>
<p>And then demonstrating to ourselves</p>
<p>and then ultimately folks in the regulatory role</p>
<p>and then ultimately the public</p>
<p>that we have confidence that our system</p>
<p>will work better than that.</p>
<p>And so these individual metrics</p>
<p>will kind of tell a compelling story ultimately.</p>
<p>I do think at the end of the day</p>
<p>what we care about in terms of safety</p>
<p>is life saved and injuries reduced.</p>
<p>And then ultimately kind of casualty dollars</p>
<p>that people aren&rsquo;t having to pay to get their car fixed.</p>
<p>And I do think that in aviation</p>
<p>they look at a kind of an event pyramid</p>
<p>where a crash is at the top of that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the worst event obviously</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s injuries and near miss events and whatnot</p>
<p>and violation of operating procedures</p>
<p>and you kind of build a statistical model</p>
<p>of the relevance of the low severity things</p>
<p>or the high severity things.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ll be able to look at as well</p>
<p>because an event per 85 million miles</p>
<p>is statistically a difficult thing</p>
<p>even at the scale of the U.S.</p>
<p>to kind of compare directly.</p>
<p>And that event fatality that&rsquo;s connected</p>
<p>to an autonomous vehicle is significantly</p>
<p>at least currently magnified</p>
<p>in the amount of attention it gets.</p>
<p>So that speaks to public perception.</p>
<p>I think the most popular topic</p>
<p>about autonomous vehicles in the public</p>
<p>is the trolley problem formulation, right?</p>
<p>Which has, let&rsquo;s not get into that too much</p>
<p>but is misguided in many ways.</p>
<p>But it speaks to the fact that people are grappling</p>
<p>with this idea of giving control over to a machine.</p>
<p>So how do you win the hearts and minds of the people</p>
<p>that autonomy is something that could be a part</p>
<p>of their lives?</p>
<p>I think you let them experience it, right?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think people should be skeptical.</p>
<p>I think people should ask questions.</p>
<p>I think they should doubt</p>
<p>because this is something new and different.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t touched it yet.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>And, but at the same time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s an opportunity to make the road safer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that we can improve access to mobility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that we can reduce the cost of mobility.</p>
<p>And that once people try that</p>
<p>and understand that it&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>and are able to use in their daily lives,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of these things</p>
<p>that will just be obvious.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen this practically in demonstrations</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve given where I&rsquo;ve had people come in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very skeptical.</p>
<p>Again, in a vehicle, my favorite one</p>
<p>is taking somebody out on the freeway</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re on the 101 driving at 65 miles an hour.</p>
<p>And after 10 minutes, they kind of turn and ask,</p>
<p>is that all it does?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s a self driving car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what you thought it would do, right?</p>
<p>But it becomes mundane,</p>
<p>which is exactly what you want a technology</p>
<p>like this to be, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really, when I turn the light switch on in here,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about the complexity of those electrons</p>
<p>being pushed down a wire from wherever it was</p>
<p>and being generated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I just get annoyed if it doesn&rsquo;t work, right?</p>
<p>And what I value is the fact</p>
<p>that I can do other things in this space.</p>
<p>I can see my colleagues.</p>
<p>I can read stuff on a paper.</p>
<p>I can not be afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what we want this technology to be like</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s in the background</p>
<p>and people get to have those life experiences</p>
<p>and do so safely.</p>
<p>So putting this technology in the hands of people</p>
<p>speaks to scale of deployment, right?</p>
<p>So what do you think the dreaded question about the future</p>
<p>because nobody can predict the future,</p>
<p>but just maybe speak poetically</p>
<p>about when do you think we&rsquo;ll see a large scale deployment</p>
<p>of autonomous vehicles, 10,000, those kinds of numbers?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see that within 10 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty confident.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an impressive scale?</p>
<p>What moment, so you&rsquo;ve done the DARPA challenge</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s one vehicle.</p>
<p>At which moment does it become, wow, this is serious scale?</p>
<p>So I think the moment it gets serious</p>
<p>is when we really do have a driverless vehicle</p>
<p>operating on public roads</p>
<p>and that we can do that kind of continuously.</p>
<p>Without a safety driver.</p>
<p>Without a safety driver in the vehicle.</p>
<p>I think at that moment,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve kind of crossed the zero to one threshold.</p>
<p>And then it is about how do we continue to scale that?</p>
<p>How do we build the right business models?</p>
<p>How do we build the right customer experience around it</p>
<p>so that it is actually a useful product out in the world?</p>
<p>And I think that is really,</p>
<p>at that point it moves from</p>
<p>what is this kind of mixed science engineering project</p>
<p>into engineering and commercialization</p>
<p>and really starting to deliver on the value</p>
<p>that we all see here and actually making that real in the world.</p>
<p>What do you think that deployment looks like?</p>
<p>Where do we first see the inkling of no safety driver,</p>
<p>one or two cars here and there?</p>
<p>Is it on the highway?</p>
<p>Is it in specific routes in the urban environment?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be urban, suburban type environments.</p>
<p>Yeah, with Aurora, when we thought about how to tackle this,</p>
<p>it was kind of in vogue to think about trucking</p>
<p>as opposed to urban driving.</p>
<p>And again, the human intuition around this</p>
<p>is that freeways are easier to drive on</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s kind of going in the same direction</p>
<p>and lanes are a little wider, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I think that that intuition is pretty good,</p>
<p>except we don&rsquo;t really care about most of the time.</p>
<p>We care about all of the time.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re driving on a freeway with a truck,</p>
<p>say 70 miles an hour,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got 70,000 pound load with you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just an incredible amount of kinetic energy.</p>
<p>And so when that goes wrong, it goes really wrong.</p>
<p>And those challenges that you see occur more rarely,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t get to learn as quickly.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re incrementally more difficult than urban driving,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not easier than urban driving.</p>
<p>And so I think this happens in moderate speed</p>
<p>urban environments because if two vehicles crash</p>
<p>at 25 miles per hour, it&rsquo;s not good,</p>
<p>but probably everybody walks away.</p>
<p>And those events where there&rsquo;s the possibility</p>
<p>for that occurring happen frequently.</p>
<p>So we get to learn more rapidly.</p>
<p>We get to do that with lower risk for everyone.</p>
<p>And then we can deliver value to people</p>
<p>that need to get from one place to another.</p>
<p>And once we&rsquo;ve got that solved,</p>
<p>then the freeway driving part of this just falls out.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re able to learn more safely,</p>
<p>more quickly in the urban environment.</p>
<p>So 10 years and then scale 20, 30 year,</p>
<p>who knows if a sufficiently compelling experience</p>
<p>is created, it could be faster and slower.</p>
<p>Do you think there could be breakthroughs</p>
<p>and what kind of breakthroughs might there be</p>
<p>that completely change that timeline?</p>
<p>Again, not only am I asking you to predict the future,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking you to predict breakthroughs</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the, I think another way to ask that</p>
<p>would be if I could wave a magic wand,</p>
<p>what part of the system would I make work today</p>
<p>to accelerate it as quickly as possible?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say infrastructure, please don&rsquo;t say infrastructure.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s definitely not infrastructure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that perception forecasting capability.</p>
<p>So if tomorrow you could give me a perfect model</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happened, what is happening</p>
<p>and what will happen for the next five seconds</p>
<p>around a vehicle on the roadway,</p>
<p>that would accelerate things pretty dramatically.</p>
<p>Are you, in terms of staying up at night,</p>
<p>are you mostly bothered by cars, pedestrians or cyclists?</p>
<p>So I worry most about the vulnerable road users</p>
<p>about the combination of cyclists and cars, right?</p>
<p>Or cyclists and pedestrians because they&rsquo;re not in armor.</p>
<p>The cars, they&rsquo;re bigger, they&rsquo;ve got protection</p>
<p>for the people and so the ultimate risk is lower there.</p>
<p>Whereas a pedestrian or a cyclist,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out on the road and they don&rsquo;t have any protection</p>
<p>and so we need to pay extra attention to that.</p>
<p>Do you think about a very difficult technical challenge</p>
<p>of the fact that pedestrians,</p>
<p>if you try to protect pedestrians</p>
<p>by being careful and slow, they&rsquo;ll take advantage of that.</p>
<p>So the game theoretic dance, does that worry you</p>
<p>of how, from a technical perspective, how we solve that?</p>
<p>Because as humans, the way we solve that</p>
<p>is kind of nudge our way through the pedestrians</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t feel, from a technical perspective,</p>
<p>as a appropriate algorithm.</p>
<p>But do you think about how we solve that problem?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s two different concepts there.</p>
<p>So one is, am I worried that because these vehicles</p>
<p>are self driving, people will kind of step in the road</p>
<p>and take advantage of them?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard this and I don&rsquo;t really believe it</p>
<p>because if I&rsquo;m driving down the road</p>
<p>and somebody steps in front of me, I&rsquo;m going to stop.</p>
<p>Even if I&rsquo;m annoyed, I&rsquo;m not gonna just drive</p>
<p>through a person stood in the road.</p>
<p>And so I think today people can take advantage of this</p>
<p>and you do see some people do it.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s an incremental risk</p>
<p>because maybe they have lower confidence</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna see them than they might have</p>
<p>for an automated vehicle and so maybe that shifts</p>
<p>it a little bit.</p>
<p>But I think people don&rsquo;t wanna get hit by cars.</p>
<p>And so I think that I&rsquo;m not that worried</p>
<p>about people walking out of the 101</p>
<p>and creating chaos more than they would today.</p>
<p>Regarding kind of the nudging through a big stream</p>
<p>of pedestrians leaving a concert or something,</p>
<p>I think that is further down the technology pipeline.</p>
<p>I think that you&rsquo;re right, that&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily,</p>
<p>I think the algorithm people use for this is pretty simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of just move forward slowly</p>
<p>and if somebody&rsquo;s really close then stop.</p>
<p>And I think that that probably can be replicated</p>
<p>pretty easily and particularly given that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do this at 30 miles an hour,</p>
<p>you do it at one, that even in those situations</p>
<p>the risk is relatively minimal.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not something we&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>in any serious way.</p>
<p>And probably that&rsquo;s less an algorithm problem</p>
<p>and more creating a human experience.</p>
<p>So the HCI people that create a visual display</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re pleasantly as a pedestrian</p>
<p>nudged out of the way, that&rsquo;s an experience problem,</p>
<p>not an algorithm problem.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the main competitor to Aurora today?</p>
<p>And how do you outcompete them in the long run?</p>
<p>So we really focus a lot on what we&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>I think that, I&rsquo;ve said this a few times,</p>
<p>that this is a huge difficult problem</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s great that a bunch of companies are tackling it</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s so important for society</p>
<p>that somebody gets there.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t spend a whole lot of time</p>
<p>thinking tactically about who&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>and how do we beat that person individually.</p>
<p>What are we trying to do to go faster ultimately?</p>
<p>Well part of it is the leadership team we have</p>
<p>has got pretty tremendous experience.</p>
<p>And so we kind of understand the landscape</p>
<p>and understand where the cul de sacs are to some degree</p>
<p>and we try and avoid those.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a part of it,</p>
<p>just this great team we&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>People, this is a technology and a company</p>
<p>that people believe in the mission of</p>
<p>and so it allows us to attract</p>
<p>just awesome people to go work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a culture I think that people appreciate</p>
<p>that allows them to focus,</p>
<p>allows them to really spend time solving problems.</p>
<p>And I think that keeps them energized.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ve invested hard,</p>
<p>invested heavily in the infrastructure</p>
<p>and architectures that we think will ultimately accelerate us.</p>
<p>So because of the folks we&rsquo;re able to bring in early on,</p>
<p>because of the great investors we have,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t spend all of our time doing demos</p>
<p>and kind of leaping from one demo to the next.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been given the freedom to invest in</p>
<p>infrastructure to do machine learning,</p>
<p>infrastructure to pull data from our on road testing,</p>
<p>infrastructure to use that to accelerate engineering.</p>
<p>And I think that early investment</p>
<p>and continuing investment in those kind of tools</p>
<p>will ultimately allow us to accelerate</p>
<p>and do something pretty incredible.</p>
<p>Chris, beautifully put.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good place to end.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. Really enjoyed it.</p>
