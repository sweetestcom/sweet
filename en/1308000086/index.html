    <p>Next up is my good friend Tim Urban from wait, but why I asked him to do this as a favor</p>
<p>He gets a huge speaking fee. I said we have no budget</p>
<p>He said Jake. I think it&rsquo;s 7,500 taken. I said I have no budget. I stole it all and</p>
<p>He has the number one talk in the history of Ted on YouTube my pal Tim Urban</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in</p>
<p>And instead we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it</p>
<p>Love you guys</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in</p>
<p>He said something yesterday to Nate Silver when after about when ate one poker and he was like, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna take away your speaking fee and I was like the fuck speaking fee</p>
<p>All right, so</p>
<p>The title of my talk is Tim talks about politics and other things that are probably a bad idea to talk about in front of</p>
<p>all these people</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>I want to start with why am I even writing about politics? I don&rsquo;t like politics</p>
<p>I like writing about the science and tech in the future and procrastination and things that interest me</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;m thinking about the future and all this awesome stuff that we could have I started to have a bad feeling</p>
<p>I would think of society kind of like a giant organism</p>
<p>And this is how I always grew up assuming that society was like it&rsquo;s like a big grown-up, but when I looked around</p>
<p>It looked more like a poopy pants</p>
<p>Six-year-old who dropped its ice cream</p>
<p>And I feel like this is what a lot of people are kind of getting at in these talks, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>Kind of all this crazy polarization and you know mobs and all in and to me I just look out and I see this</p>
<p>I see I see kind of reverting and then people are acting like they&rsquo;re in middle school and like, you know</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t communicate and and what&rsquo;s going on? So I I started putting my mind to this now. What was the problem and</p>
<p>The problem is very complicated and I&rsquo;m not going to try to get into the whole thing today</p>
<p>But I think that what we can do is have a better framework to talk about the problem</p>
<p>I think that we are very constrained to this one-dimensional axis</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a straitjacket in our conversations</p>
<p>You know, you hear people say the problem is, you know, the far left and the far right we need to be in the center</p>
<p>We need to be more moderate</p>
<p>What is that? The center is just a policy position, right?</p>
<p>The far left and far right aren&rsquo;t inherently bad</p>
<p>The far left is just kind of radical and questioning everything and they&rsquo;re experimental and the far right is just questioning</p>
<p>Maybe we messed up. Maybe we should go back to the way things were</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing inherently better or worse about any part of this spectrum</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re using these words to try to get at something else. We&rsquo;d say centrist moderate</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really mean in the middle of the spectrum. I think we&rsquo;re talking about a different axis. I call it the ladder</p>
<p>So I think bringing our political discussions into two dimensions can be hugely helpful now</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll see like the political compass you&rsquo;ll see, you know politics in 2d, but that&rsquo;s still all what you think</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you know different ways to look at what you think about politics. The ladder is a how you think axis</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s you know, there&rsquo;s some nuance to it there. It&rsquo;s a spectrum</p>
<p>But for our purposes, let&rsquo;s just focus on the two kind of core ideas here</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s high-rung political thinking and high-rung politics and low-rung politics</p>
<p>so the high-rungs</p>
<p>You can kind of divide it to high-rung progressivism and high-rung conservatism</p>
<p>Which I kind of think like it&rsquo;s like two arguing Giants like they&rsquo;re like, you know</p>
<p>you know that the collective efforts of high-rung progressivism conservatism are</p>
<p>Are kind of like lawyers in a courtroom. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re heated. They don&rsquo;t like each other a lot of the time</p>
<p>They have very different ideas of how things should go</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, the two lawyers in a courtroom</p>
<p>This is kind of a wink that goes on where they understand ultimately they&rsquo;re on the same team</p>
<p>There are two sides of a truth kind of discovery machine, and I think this is the same thing</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like each other, but they&rsquo;re actually ultimately on the same team trying to figure out the roadmap</p>
<p>How do we move forward and the conversations in high-rung politics are complexed. They&rsquo;re nuanced, you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s different realms</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s what is right though science and history arguing about what is that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s hard to figure out</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s what should be right that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s philosophy and ethics then there&rsquo;s you know, even if they agree on those two things</p>
<p>How do we get there? Right? What are the right policy strategies experimentation testing?</p>
<p>so so there&rsquo;s a lot of nuances a lot of complexity and</p>
<p>And one of the core defining features is if this is how you form beliefs, right?</p>
<p>You know you go from I don&rsquo;t know some kind of process to I know high-rung politics is all about truth</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re geared towards truth. They start here at I don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s kind of an inherent humility</p>
<p>to this process</p>
<p>so I</p>
<p>Think of humility a little bit like trying to stay on a tightrope. It&rsquo;s not easy, right? We</p>
<p>we are</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for your confidence, you know</p>
<p>You have the Dunning-Kruger thing your confidence shoots up when you look first learn something and then it goes down</p>
<p>After you, you know realize you don&rsquo;t know as much as you know</p>
<p>And then sometimes you can go too low and so when you go too low</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the kind of the insecure zone, right? You actually know more than you think, you know</p>
<p>But you but but like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re just not you&rsquo;re even some kind of imposter syndrome</p>
<p>Above the line, you know, we&rsquo;re in the arrogant zone very common in politics</p>
<p>Obviously, you know where you you think you know more than you really actually do</p>
<p>So like, you know, you could even measure it like this is how much you&rsquo;re full of shit</p>
<p>how much above like the the amount above the line you are and</p>
<p>In hiring politics look no one is great at staying on the tightrope. It&rsquo;s very hard, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Culture of hiring politics is helpful because it can actually</p>
<p>It humbles you because people will disagree with you and it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>In kind of a hiring political culture to be humble</p>
<p>Like if you say I don&rsquo;t know or you say yeah, you know</p>
<p>I I haven&rsquo;t thought about that issue that makes you seem smart in hiring politics, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s incurred whatever the culture finds cool. We&rsquo;re gonna do more of a</p>
<p>Core thing about hiring politics. We don&rsquo;t identify with our ideas. So</p>
<p>I think you know</p>
<p>Ideas when you&rsquo;re in this zone are like a machine that you built. It&rsquo;s like a hypothesis, right?</p>
<p>You put the boxing gloves on you let your friends kick it, you know go to town</p>
<p>You know you throw it out there people try to argue with it, you know, the besties are big on this, right?</p>
<p>They love an opportunity relish opportunity to just tell the other person they&rsquo;re wrong or here&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re biased or here&rsquo;s why you have</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re being hypocritical and this is what hiring politics is about. No one takes it personally</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just kicking my machine and I&rsquo;m saying I bet my machine can stand up to it and they&rsquo;re saying I bet it can</p>
<p>And if it does man, I just got more confident because I just I just realized this thing is pretty strong</p>
<p>If they if they break it, it doesn&rsquo;t feel good. But I just got a little smarter</p>
<p>I just got a little bit less dumb because I learned something I was wrong about</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kicking it and you know, you&rsquo;re watching them box is dialectic when you watch them box together</p>
<p>Sometimes you play devil&rsquo;s advocate you take the bat to your own idea</p>
<p>This is this is you know, kind of how you move up that humility tightrope to a more knowledgeable place</p>
<p>principles wise</p>
<p>One of the things that defines hiring politics is consistency. It&rsquo;s not again. There&rsquo;s left right center. So the principles will totally</p>
<p>Vary, but there&rsquo;s consistency either way. So classic example Ilan talking about yesterday free speech doesn&rsquo;t count to value</p>
<p>The you know to fight for the free speech of people who you agree with every single person in history has had that principle</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the yellow zone</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to support for your principles when it&rsquo;s also supporting your team</p>
<p>the challenge comes when it&rsquo;s not when it&rsquo;s people you don&rsquo;t like saying things you don&rsquo;t like for example or when or when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Your team trying to shut down the free speech of others and you know, it&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>Even though you you do hate that speech</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you have to choose green zone or orange zone hiring politics is great about staying in the green zone</p>
<p>You will see them</p>
<p>Go against their own team all the time if it doesn&rsquo;t conflict if it doesn&rsquo;t jive with their principles</p>
<p>I think if you take a big step back this thing again, it gets heated</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t you know, people mistake hiring politics that you know, it&rsquo;s oh it&rsquo;s we should be all you know</p>
<p>We should be you know, kind of withdrawn and and and irrational</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s actually also it can be very passionate very emotional very heated people care deeply in hiring</p>
<p>They can form coalitions and do marches and still and stuff like that. It&rsquo;s just that they care about truth</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re consistent with their principles. They don&rsquo;t identify with their ideas</p>
<p>They like to argue and ultimately it&rsquo;s a positive some game with a positive effect on the country</p>
<p>This is what drives the country forward right in the Science Academy. This is what drives</p>
<p>Knowledge forward right this this is what drives innovation forward is people able to disagree now</p>
<p>To the other thing that is lowering politics lowering politics. I have a name for it. I call it political Disney World</p>
<p>And I call it that because it&rsquo;s a land of rainbows and unicorns and a bunch of people who will not change their mind</p>
<p>Under any circumstances. It&rsquo;s a land of good guys and bad guys</p>
<p>The good guys are angels perfectly righteous</p>
<p>the bad guys are awful in every possible way and the good guys have good ideas and the bad guys have bad ideas and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a checklist in hiring politics if someone tells me their position on guns</p>
<p>I have no idea what their position is on climate change or on abortion or on immigration in lowering politics</p>
<p>You hear one position from someone boom</p>
<p>I you can just look at their demeanor and I know every single position they&rsquo;ve got on every single issue</p>
<p>The same concept in lowering politics again, no one thinks they&rsquo;re in lowering politics</p>
<p>So people there will will think yeah, of course, I value truth, but they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re actually starting it</p>
<p>I know they start at the checklist item and now they say well I have to prove this is correct</p>
<p>So when they read an article that they put they won&rsquo;t read the article</p>
<p>But if they read the article that disagrees with them, they&rsquo;ll meet their there</p>
<p>They have a brick wall in their head about you know, this can&rsquo;t be true. This person is biased</p>
<p>This is this is you know ad hominem, whatever</p>
<p>And when they read an article that agrees with them when they hear an opinion</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all that skepticism disappears and suddenly it must be true. Yes, of course</p>
<p>So I talked about hiring politics, it&rsquo;s like the ideas are like machines, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you know, you don&rsquo;t get sensitive about it. You can&rsquo;t kick the machine right lowering politics</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a baby a very cute baby who you love so much. So people&rsquo;s ideas. They&rsquo;re sacred in lowering politics</p>
<p>And and this is why you know, you can kick a machine and no, that&rsquo;s no big deal</p>
<p>If you kick a baby, you&rsquo;re an asshole. And so on the high rungs</p>
<p>People can disagree if you have two axes here decency and agreement and they&rsquo;re totally different, right?</p>
<p>You can have people that disagree with you that are awesome and vice versa</p>
<p>You can have people that agree with you and they&rsquo;re assholes, but in lowering politics, it&rsquo;s very simple people who agree with you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good people people who don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re assholes</p>
<p>So this is you know, what it comes down to is, you know, you have a high rung discussion</p>
<p>It kind of looks like this they&rsquo;re examining things lowering discussion. It&rsquo;s like fucking shit. That&rsquo;s a cute baby. God</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a good baby. How awful are people who don&rsquo;t like the baby so awful, right?</p>
<p>This is very common. If you listen to a low-rung political discussion, this is essentially what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sitting around and they&rsquo;re talking about how right they are and how awful the people and dangerous</p>
<p>The people are who disagree with them and that&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;ll just talk about that forever and ever and ever</p>
<p>Principles same idea here. You actually stick with the left circle. You&rsquo;ll constantly a</p>
<p>You know giveaway here for low-rung politics is that when when when it&rsquo;s not convenient yellow circle territory</p>
<p>They will almost always jump over to the orange circle, you know, you&rsquo;ll have again, you know</p>
<p>So free speech you&rsquo;ll see is a perfect litmus test if you know as soon as it&rsquo;s free speech people</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like all those principles disappear</p>
<p>We can you know, how about Kovan marches? Oh, you know people are completely worked up about</p>
<p>Lockdown marches in right-wing states soon as its marches for racial justice all good all good</p>
<p>This is this is a public health crisis, right? This is that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s orange material. How about all the people who are super anti?</p>
<p>You know immigration policies and surveillance policies and foreign policy and you know debt</p>
<p>Issues and then as soon as it&rsquo;s the other president now that your president&rsquo;s in office all those same policies stay and you&rsquo;re fine with them</p>
<p>You know the classic example that the debt was the worst thing in the world during Obama&rsquo;s presidency</p>
<p>and then Trump comes in office starts doing it these tax packages that are adding to it and</p>
<p>Suddenly, it&rsquo;s no problem. So there&rsquo;s endless examples here</p>
<p>If high-rung politics is kind of this positive some game lowering politics. I see it much more like two</p>
<p>screaming Giants and and and and they&rsquo;re there if the high-rung kind of</p>
<p>Emergent property is intelligence and progress the low-rung emergent property is just strength and you know fighting for power</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a battle of good versus evil and the big the big goal is not, you know, not</p>
<p>Trying to create a more perfect Union again. They think that&rsquo;s the goal. But the big goal really is beating the bad guys</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a zero-sum game that ultimately has a negative effect</p>
<p>So I know I just threw a lot at you because I wanted to kind of cover the different bases of this to give</p>
<p>A feel for what I&rsquo;m talking about here. This is the framework that I think is very useful</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been living with it now for a few years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having conversations with it and I find that it clarifies a lot and it helps with a lot of things like</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>If you just think it&rsquo;s a horizontal axis a as I said, you know</p>
<p>You mistake that the far left and right must be the problem, but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s the low rungs that are the problem</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what people are trying to say the moderate centrist, you know think that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re actually trying to say</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to say high-rung which can expand the the the horizontal axis</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more than one tug-of-war going on we think if you just have one axis</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s left versus right and that is a tug-of-war both in the high and low rungs that is you know</p>
<p>There are fighting for what they want</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a tug-of-war going on from the north and south as well</p>
<p>The the the progressive I think I know a lot of people in here probably are thinking I&rsquo;m in that upper left guy</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my guess</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s true, and it might be true</p>
<p>You you do have a tug-of-war going on against that upper right guy</p>
<p>You also have a tug-of-war gone going on against that lower left guy</p>
<p>This is the thing that I think is important to realize is when you have this that the people who are on your team</p>
<p>You know, they also hate Trump or whatever</p>
<p>They might be actually like the biggest impediment to what you care about politically. They undermine the progress of what you care about</p>
<p>It also can enhance kind of collaboration because if you&rsquo;re in that one of those upper Giants</p>
<p>The other upper giant is a lot more on your ultimate team</p>
<p>If you take a big step back then the lower giant that wears the same color</p>
<p>so once you start to think this way</p>
<p>I think it helps to to</p>
<p>Kind of loosen some of the tribalism and give some nuance to our discussions and give some nuance to what we&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>Now the story I wanted to talk about here is that this is okay. This is normal by the way</p>
<p>This is not a problem. Every democracy in the world will have this the founders knew this would be here. The goal was not to</p>
<p>Suppress low rungness it was to contain it and actually, you know in the economy to harness it for progress</p>
<p>But in politics to contain it so it can&rsquo;t totally take over they contain it by taking away the physical cudgel</p>
<p>You know, you can&rsquo;t just conquer and become a dictator like so many low rung Giants and other countries have done</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s laws here. And and and most importantly there&rsquo;s kind of a high rung immune system, which is just vigorous defenses defense</p>
<p>Defense against low rung infringement low rungness will try to shut down the conversations in the high rungs in the high rungs</p>
<p>Resist they say no fuck off. Like we</p>
<p>We know where you can&rsquo;t enforce your echo chamber upon us. You&rsquo;re allowed to have your echo chamber. That&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t enforce it. So this is how it&rsquo;s supposed to be now</p>
<p>Part of the reason we&rsquo;re all here continually in each talk talking about man politics is awful and things are bad</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a poopy pace pants</p>
<p>Six year old with the ice cream falling is because of I think we&rsquo;ve had some big changes to the environment</p>
<p>This is the kind of simple human equation. I think about you&rsquo;ve got human nature is constant</p>
<p>The environment is what changes and that produces different behavior, right? You know the people who are really hardened during war, you know</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not different</p>
<p>Biologically than us they just were put in a very different environment and it created different kinds of people</p>
<p>So our environment has changed a lot and I think it&rsquo;s causing a lot of problems</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s causing a low-rung flare-up if you know, so here&rsquo;s one way to think about it in the 60s. You&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>intraparty factions within the parties</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you have a lot of progressive Republicans and conservative Democrats and the these these factions within the parties</p>
<p>They hate each other right which is</p>
<p>Which was a source of tribalism. Some people are just so focused on the other people in their party the other factions</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the national parties like we have that we talk about a lot today Republicans and Democrats nationally</p>
<p>That was a source of tribalism and then there was this, you know</p>
<p>USSR and also before that Hitler like there were all these, you know</p>
<p>Scary foreign enemies that created this kind of macro tribalism on the national level. So you have</p>
<p>patriotism which is</p>
<p>One kind of tribalism, but it also unifies down below and the intraparty factions might actually cause the national parties to collaborate sometime</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that people were less tribal. It&rsquo;s that tribalism was distributed</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happened is now the intraparty factions have disappeared because the conservative Democrats have all gone to the Republicans</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the progressive Republicans have all gone for lots of reasons we can get into some other talk, but</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s waned. There&rsquo;s still a little you still have Bernie and you know, Hillary not liking, you know, they&rsquo;re people not like it</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s much less of a thing</p>
<p>likewise, you still have you know, yes, so Russia, you know, but</p>
<p>Mostly that&rsquo;s not the focus. In fact</p>
<p>The focus is is it&rsquo;s so not here that when there&rsquo;s a foreign thing now</p>
<p>Usually we&rsquo;ll just use it as like political fodder for our national debate, you know, all the Russians are on their side</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re on their side, right and it there&rsquo;s no patriotism that unites anymore</p>
<p>What you have is one big old political divide and all the tribalism from all those things is concentrated into one place</p>
<p>Which is an unhealthy that&rsquo;s not great. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>So this is one environmental change. No one&rsquo;s fault</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what happened then, you know, you also have a lot of things with like the electoral map you have between gerrymandering and you know</p>
<p>Geographic sorting you have purple counties turning, you know</p>
<p>Mostly red and blue now which means primaries are actually electing the farthest right and left people as opposed to you know</p>
<p>People who can win a general election</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of other kind of little environmental changes, but one huge one that we talked about is the media</p>
<p>I think of a media. I&rsquo;d like to place them on a media matrix accuracy on the y-axis and objectivity</p>
<p>So the you want to be is the top middle right and actually for a long time there was an incentive magnet</p>
<p>To be there for ABC CBS NBC, right?</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to seem like they were inaccurate and had to cater to the whole country which kept them somewhat close to that</p>
<p>There was this incentive magnet today. You have cable TV and then eventually you have, you know, talk radio and you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>Then the internet and all these websites you have tribal media, which is a totally different set of incentives</p>
<p>You cater to one side only you it&rsquo;s more bias</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>The more clicks and accuracy is just not a concern to the audiences</p>
<p>they end up having and then you have this feedback loop like was discussed yesterday where once you</p>
<p>Cater to that now you have to keep that going right? You&rsquo;ve now lost a neutral audience and</p>
<p>And so now we have a lot of Americans super addicted to a really trashy reality show</p>
<p>real politicians of Washington</p>
<p>And then I took me a long time to make this by the way</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Think McConnell&rsquo;s my favorite anyway</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve got of course the big bomb drops in our environment. You&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>Social media. This is a real graph showing people retweet things. They agree with two people. They agree with almost entirely, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these algorithmic bubbles. It&rsquo;s insane, you know, and so if you&rsquo;re one of the people that actually I follow all kinds of people</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very rare because and and and it didn&rsquo;t again it didn&rsquo;t used to be this way</p>
<p>John Ronson talks about you know, how it used to be a radical de-shaming like Twitter, you know, you go on and be like</p>
<p>Oh, I do this embarrassing thing people would be like me too and it&rsquo;d be like oh</p>
<p>So nice and fuzzy at the very beginning and then it turned into wait a second</p>
<p>You know this bad guy is harassing women at work and now actually this woman has power for the first time</p>
<p>she can talk about on social media you can create a whole kind of</p>
<p>Coalition against it. He gets fired and it&rsquo;s exhilarating and that&rsquo;s good, right? This is speaking truth to power</p>
<p>Problem is now people are exhilarated and they&rsquo;re saying who&rsquo;s next right and you have this new source of power</p>
<p>Which again can be used for good but it&rsquo;s gotten picked up by a lot of the low-rung</p>
<p>Tribes who have started to use this cudgel</p>
<p>That started it&rsquo;s been a while now, you know creating mobs to actually enforce low-rung politics</p>
<p>And what happens is you end up with high-rung world very scared kind of caught off guard</p>
<p>The normal defenses the normal immune system is not</p>
<p>Doing its job and so what happens when the high-rung world gets scared</p>
<p>This is a very you know, it can set off a domino effect. Imagine we picture. This is the high-rung world</p>
<p>These are brains. This is what a bunch of high-rung people in the community think</p>
<p>They all think different things based on the color right now</p>
<p>If we draw a circle around them, this is imagining what they&rsquo;re saying is the circles color</p>
<p>So here is the perfect high-rung community, right?</p>
<p>Everyone is it&rsquo;s a diverse, you know thinking and they&rsquo;re saying what they&rsquo;re thinking and it connects together into this super brain</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome, right? But now maybe the social media cudgel maybe something else</p>
<p>It starts to be a little bit scary and and this one group starts to say the only opinion that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>Is the orange opinion anyone who says anything other than the orange opinions an awful person?</p>
<p>The high-rung immune system supposed to kick in and say cool fuck off if it doesn&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>Everyone starts getting scared and then cowardice starts to spread and before you know it</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s just saying the orange out loud, even if they don&rsquo;t agree with it</p>
<p>No one wants to outwardly say what they think anymore</p>
<p>And the problem is you can&rsquo;t actually see what&rsquo;s going on in the brains</p>
<p>You only know what people what people are thinking based on what they&rsquo;re saying. So all people see is this so if you&rsquo;re this guy</p>
<p>Who actually has one opinion and actually is full of diverse thinking around them. They don&rsquo;t know that they assume it must look like this</p>
<p>Everyone starts to feel like I&rsquo;m the only one who thinks this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only one who doesn&rsquo;t like this movement or this</p>
<p>politician or whatever and</p>
<p>The group intelligence that&rsquo;s so awesome about high-rung politics, it disappears</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;re seeing is if what you know, why why are things so bad?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because we move to the far right and far left. I think it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>You have a low rung flare-up</p>
<p>Generated by changes of the environment and the high rungs have been caught off guard by a really rapid environment changes</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve just disappeared. They&rsquo;ve shrunk away and the low rungs are running, you know, buck wild</p>
<p>You can see this on the right. I think mostly in Washington</p>
<p>You see the debt ceiling, you know being used as a weapon in a way that should never happen. You see</p>
<p>McConnell and the Senate not putting through a Senate candidate a</p>
<p>Supreme Court candidate because it&rsquo;s the last year totally unprecedented. That&rsquo;s not the rule then four years later</p>
<p>They go and they do they put their own candidate. This is low-rung shit. Of course Trump with the election</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>Reagan&rsquo;s big thing was you know</p>
<p>The peaceful transition of power is what makes us special and you know, Trump, of course is the exact opposite on the left</p>
<p>I think we see it less in Washington and much more in culture. I think wokeness is</p>
<p>Two things it&rsquo;s a far-left ideology and it is far left</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you know postmodern and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s Marxist and that&rsquo;s fine. You can have those things in the higher rungs the thing that makes</p>
<p>Wokeness low rung is the way they treat others</p>
<p>You can you can go and have your own but you can have your own echo chamber and do it</p>
<p>What the woke mantra is, you know</p>
<p>What a low-rung person in a liberal country supposed to say is I don&rsquo;t like these ideas</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t listen to them</p>
<p>What a what you&rsquo;re not supposed to be able to say is I don&rsquo;t like the idea</p>
<p>So no one is allowed to listen to them right with a disinvitation on campus, which has become very common, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not saying I won&rsquo;t go to that talk, which is a low-rung thing to say. It&rsquo;s much worse</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying no one on this campus is allowed to hear that talk and we see that having played out</p>
<p>We see James Bennett the editor of the New York Times op-ed section getting fired</p>
<p>Because he published an op-ed by Tom Cotton that 62% of the country agreed with</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t jive with woke</p>
<p>Orthodoxy you see Denise Young at Apple a black woman who&rsquo;s the head of diversity who says to me diversity is not you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more complicated than just about something like race when I look at a 12 blue-eyed blonde haired guys</p>
<p>I see I see diversity. I see different people diverse in different ways. She was fired for saying that</p>
<p>You can go on and on medical journals are retracting papers that have never retracted papers before because the double peer-reviewed papers</p>
<p>Because they get a rise on Twitter from the woke mob</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re seeing this in different ways</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s all one big story, which is that we&rsquo;re having a low-rung flare-up and these low-rung Giants are out of hand</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing things</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not supposed to be able to be doing and they&rsquo;re doing that because the immune system is failing and that&rsquo;s why we all look</p>
<p>Like this now the good news is I do think this can change. I don&rsquo;t think most people are like this</p>
<p>I think most people are and by the way, if you think this is all another binary divide</p>
<p>We are all high rung and low rung at different times. And that&rsquo;s one of the big differences here</p>
<p>I think that if we want to get out of this and get back to here</p>
<p>We need two things who we need</p>
<p>awareness</p>
<p>Which is the first thing we need we need to be aware of I think this this this this axis and to think about</p>
<p>Not just where am I being bullied intellectually where what&rsquo;s really the low-rung thing and what&rsquo;s not but also where are we being low-rung?</p>
<p>Because we all can do this</p>
<p>this is this is this is a huge part of our brain that wants to go and and identify with our ideas and and</p>
<p>Be hypocritical. So where am I doing it?</p>
<p>Where are the people around me doing it and and maybe realizing?</p>
<p>Okay, maybe the people that on the high rungs when I am there that disagree with me horizontally</p>
<p>Maybe those are my friends a lot more than the low-rung people that are voting for the same candidate and finally awareness</p>
<p>Without saying anything out loud is useless, right? You need awareness has to be coupled with courage</p>
<p>People have to start</p>
<p>Speaking out and actually that&rsquo;s the the high-rung immune system is built of</p>
<p>Courage, it&rsquo;s built of people actually standing up and you&rsquo;ve seen this with some companies declaring. We will not</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not a political place. That&rsquo;s courage in the face of a cudgel that&rsquo;s trying to get them to be political</p>
<p>and so I think if you can have a little bit more awareness and a little bit more courage this kind of this low-rung flare-up</p>
<p>Can be I think?</p>
<p>Controlled and I think we can end up in a better place. Thank you</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>What an amazing talk to follow</p>
<p>The talk we had earlier I think with I don&rsquo;t know if you got to witness it the Palmer lucky talk</p>
<p>I was trying to think of how to trash you because it was so popular</p>
<p>So you were gonna go low-rung? Yeah, but I mean in fact</p>
<p>You know that I think Palmer and I had some low-rung moments where you know, he was doing the anti-Hillary stuff</p>
<p>I was dunking on him for it</p>
<p>And then we saw an example of maybe adult high-rung behavior of like hey, let&rsquo;s sit here and talk about the differences</p>
<p>I want to put out there just talking about the woke movement for a second</p>
<p>One of the major challenges I had in this event was certain people attending the event</p>
<p>Made some people in that group</p>
<p>Unwilling to come to the event</p>
<p>No offense Keith</p>
<p>In other words like Keith Sachs, you know, and then even Glenn Grunwald and Greenwald. I&rsquo;m sorry and Matt Taibbi</p>
<p>Were triggers for certain people to not come speak. They were gonna kick the baby</p>
<p>They were gonna kick the baby. And so I think and then on the right</p>
<p>we have I think some pleasure in knowing you&rsquo;re triggering the libs and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exacerbated this it&rsquo;s hard for me as a conference</p>
<p>Producer or a podcast producer to get the two sides to sit and just have a reasonable discussion at time</p>
<p>how do we break that logjam of</p>
<p>The right just loves to troll and trigger the libs and the libs are like I&rsquo;m not even participating in the discussion</p>
<p>With this group of people that group of people, you know, the Sachs is the Keats the you know, whatever</p>
<p>He triggers a lot of limbs</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s start there and then Keith I&rsquo;d love to hear you respond to this dynamic which I know you are fully aware of</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think that we can get there&rsquo;s some clear definitions here</p>
<p>Not</p>
<p>Wanting to go to something be that that you know a high runger says, oh they disagree with me great</p>
<p>Let me go and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what they really want to hear because I want to learn something, right?</p>
<p>The low runger says fuck those evil awful people. I&rsquo;m not gonna go right they storm away fine</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a liberal country live and let live you these are both. Okay</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not okay is the low rungers</p>
<p>In pressuring you to kick off those speakers because otherwise they&rsquo;re going to start a movement a petition a boycott of your show that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna end up hurting you in some way, you know</p>
<p>So taking out smearing you on social media and into the pressuring this to not happen at all</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s saying no one&rsquo;s allowed to go to that conference. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s not. Okay. It&rsquo;s interesting. You bring this up. I shared with you that</p>
<p>back channel</p>
<p>There was there was back channel of you know, how beautiful a moment was with the high rung discussion</p>
<p>We just had there was also a dark moment before the event where a group of people who did not agree</p>
<p>Were doing what you&rsquo;re saying. The woke mob was saying</p>
<p>We need to get other hello on the left</p>
<p>David Sachs time there&rsquo;s just to tell me when rob boy got here. So there was literally to your point an</p>
<p>Intolerance level of not only are we not going to come to all in summit because sacks or this person and that person are there</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to start telling other people to not go and not participate</p>
<p>It literally happened and I had to stop but this is a so look this conference did happen</p>
<p>Those people did come ideas were spread. So this is a victory for high rungness. This is yeah</p>
<p>So then you keep</p>
<p>Tell us why is it so pleasurable?</p>
<p>To trigger the libs David Keith. No in all seriousness, you love to debate you take all comers. No problem</p>
<p>You want to get in the arena?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re seeing now?</p>
<p>How did I actually just interject on that? Sure. So I mean speaking for myself</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get any pleasure in triggering libs and that&rsquo;s not my objective and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily keys either</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re really doing is because we are willing to debate and we&rsquo;re not afraid to have the conversation</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now redefining that as triggering other people. No, we&rsquo;re not. We&rsquo;re just want to have a conversation</p>
<p>Now yeah</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s really easy to tell who are the people who have good points to make and are and have</p>
<p>Intellectual confidence because they&rsquo;re the ones willing to show up and have conversations</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the biggest cop-out for anybody to say well</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be your comfort big I see this name and this name on your agenda. How lame is that?</p>
<p>What and and and to be honest, you know a lot of the positions</p>
<p>I think you and Palmer probably disagree on the approach to Ukraine. He&rsquo;s probably very pro</p>
<p>Supporting that and you might be a little more dovish</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think two points first of all a I took on this fool&rsquo;s errand like ten years ago of correcting everything wrong on</p>
<p>the internet</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an insane idea</p>
<p>But the reason why I did it was I felt like wow someone in</p>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t know any better might read something that&rsquo;s wrong and they might believe it</p>
<p>And so at least if I start correcting it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s multiple perspectives and then they&rsquo;ll have to dig in as opposed to just take this for granted</p>
<p>The second thing is yeah, I have no desire to trigger the libs</p>
<p>But I do feel like I have a platform and I don&rsquo;t want to die without having used</p>
<p>Whatever influence I have to proselytize for ideas I believe in so if I have 300,000 followers</p>
<p>I feel I would be neglecting like my light like</p>
<p>Benefits of my life if I&rsquo;m not proselytizing for the few five six seven eight nine things I care about</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t want to wake up one day and say I wish I had done X Y or Z and it could have maybe</p>
<p>Changed the world</p>
<p>Can I have Tim a question around his name is Tim</p>
<p>Hey, nice to Tim David free. How are you?</p>
<p>We actually haven&rsquo;t met before</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Do you think that over time?</p>
<p>Content has gotten shorter sound bites have become kind of the primary form of content</p>
<p>You know we used to be that we&rsquo;d sit down and read books and we&rsquo;d read newspapers and we&rsquo;d watch these long-form news hour</p>
<p>Conversations and then you know things got shorter. They got faster. They got quicker and as a result</p>
<p>We ended up kind of debasing ourselves and ending up in this point where everything has to be reduced to that primal</p>
<p>instinctual reaction moment and</p>
<p>It gets even more significantly fueled by the feedback loops associated with social media</p>
<p>So the things that you see more of are the things that really do trigger that kind of primal, you know</p>
<p>emotional</p>
<p>Sense more is that a big driver. Do you think societally in terms of have we become more tribal over the last century?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think environmental changes are just it&rsquo;s like they will produce behavioral changes and</p>
<p>It can be sometimes a feedback loop where you have shorter content more emotional, you know</p>
<p>Kind of triggering content like you said, you know, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s almost like pheromones</p>
<p>Evolutionarily it wins. Yeah. Well and all you know on Twitter actually, there&rsquo;s a phenomenon where actually</p>
<p>But virality dumbs down information because</p>
<p>nuanced information doesn&rsquo;t hit as hard totally and so it&rsquo;s when you have it&rsquo;s if you it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like evolution where you see, you know that the tweet that ends up super viral</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s you know survived a hundred other competing tweets to get there and the ones that are rising to the top</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mechanism. There&rsquo;s a mechanism right now. That is that is pushing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of forming a magnet down in political Disney World that is pulling us down and I one of the questions I you know</p>
<p>Have for Elon is like what what&rsquo;s how can that somehow be?</p>
<p>you know what one idea that a friend and I were kicking around is like some kind of almost like</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>Know Wikipedia managed to somehow stay</p>
<p>Somewhat, you know nuanced and neutral in a way and and could there be some kind of like giant 10,000 pool, you know of moderators</p>
<p>That actually kind of put you know, rank things by can maybe high rung and low rung</p>
<p>And and the algorithm doesn&rsquo;t necessarily suppress the lower and stuff</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t push it which right now the algorithm in is you&rsquo;re talking about like moderation editorialization almost</p>
<p>Yeah, at least like to give it like a credit rating on maybe a high-low scale</p>
<p>I kind of view this as like a muting effect</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an institutionalization of these social networks where everyone talks about them being free to run as a network</p>
<p>Without kind of a central system of control, but sometimes that central system of control has an important role in playing</p>
<p>moderation muting</p>
<p>Editorialization that I&rsquo;ll kind of avoid some of the adverse consequences. It&rsquo;s definitely optimizing downwards right now. What do you think Keith? Yeah</p>
<p>Should Elon buy Twitter and then yeah, I started to disagree</p>
<p>I mean I grew up in the 70s and 80s and soundbite, you know was the term of art for like 30-second commercials</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we debated politics was 30-second commercials</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any evidence that suggests that tweets today in politics are worse than the 30-second commercials</p>
<p>I grew up with and if you think about polarization, I also watched used to watch Europe European politics in the 70s and 80s</p>
<p>Yeah, the most extreme ends of politics you&rsquo;ll ever see we don&rsquo;t have any of those extremes in the United States still today</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s I think a lot of people like make arguments without evidence that things have changed and I actually start</p>
<p>With like first principles like wait, where&rsquo;s the evidence like people talk about this information?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that the American voter in 2016 have less information or less accurate information than 1888 or 1894</p>
<p>1910 in fact the opposite is true by most by most serious studies</p>
<p>Yeah, this is all kind of made up in my mind</p>
<p>Yes, Elon should buy Twitter to save the world, but it&rsquo;s not gonna be a good financial investment</p>
<p>What how does it save the world do you think well we need a free speech platform where people can debate ideas and</p>
<p>The left wing of Twitter the employee base has completely suppressed ideas. For example, my husband</p>
<p>I happen to know this wrote an article in foreign policy magazine like the most prestigious</p>
<p>Publication in the entire planet for foreign policy debate about the CCP</p>
<p>Twitter refused for years to allow them to advertise that article published in foreign policy magazine</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s clearly someone at Twitter suppressing content</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s critical of the CCP and we tried appealing to everybody and they wouldn&rsquo;t change this</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s either Chinese spies there or a left-wing culture that you know suppresses debate. This is foreign policy magazine</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t get any more prestigious than that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absurd let alone the fact that I have 300,000 followers and do not have a blue check</p>
<p>I must have the largest follower of anybody who doesn&rsquo;t have a blue check and it&rsquo;s all because I&rsquo;ve used unacceptable that that seems really</p>
<p>Pretty ridiculous considering many other VCS who are meaningfully less credentialed, of course experience</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obvious and I have you know insiders at Twitter have sent me screenshots of various things</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that it&rsquo;s a left-wing monoculture</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s suppressing ideas and someone needs to fix that either the government needs to fix it</p>
<p>Which is worse than Elon fixing it, but the government if the US Congress is turned over</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of subpoenas flying over to Twitter because there are absolutely foreign governments influencing that some of those decisions at Twitter</p>
<p>Well, I mean it was in fact proven that there were Saudis</p>
<p>inside of Twitter</p>
<p>Saudi national yes the best tweet retort ever by you. Yeah. I wish I would be that good</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean what was it tweet?</p>
<p>Well, you know the the Saudi Prince was complaining and he said that please explain freedom of speech and how that works in your country</p>
<p>Oh, right. Yeah, I mean</p>
<p>to the press</p>
<p>should</p>
<p>Can you explain cancel culture in your framework? Yeah, so</p>
<p>I like to use a couple terms here. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s social bullying which is no one</p>
<p>If you disagree you can&rsquo;t be my friend</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s okay, right? I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re an awesome person if you act like that, but you&rsquo;re allowed to</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s what I would call idea supremacy</p>
<p>Which is you know, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like like I&rsquo;ve been saying, you know, no one is allowed to</p>
<p>Say this thing whether you&rsquo;re my friend or not</p>
<p>And and and you know, if you want to run something on your own property, you can make all the speech rules</p>
<p>But cancel culture is specifically going into places that are supposed to be high rung</p>
<p>You know what? You know what it says on top of Harvard College Veritas, right Veritas</p>
<p>Which is which is them that is that is them putting their stake down on the ground and saying we are a high rung place</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not say using those words</p>
<p>But that is what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>We are a place that cares about truth that cares about diversity of ideas</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re right that cares about openness and inquiry and curiosity and all of this and</p>
<p>So cancel culture it goes into places like that Google, you know, you know started off and they had their all hands meetings</p>
<p>It was all about you know, and every idea is good criticize the leadership likes, you know, you know, right?</p>
<p>So these things were specifically higher up right that they were founded on these things cancel culture goes into those places and says</p>
<p>Our preferred echo chamber now those rules apply to everyone here and it&rsquo;s a power</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a lot of things want to do that, right?</p>
<p>A lot of you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the pro-lifers would like to go into campuses and say no one can have a pro-choice position</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the power cancel culture is a product of a group</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not supposed to have the power to do that having the power to do that</p>
<p>And I think that comes from the fear of social media. It comes from this hyper charged</p>
<p>Tribalism in the environment we live in right now and a lot of things</p>
<p>So one of the solutions to many things in life is moving to Miami and I&rsquo;m serious about</p>
<p>One of the most stark things when we moved to Miami 17 months ago was in Miami you hot</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly refreshing because everybody has a different position. There&rsquo;s literally no environment socially politically</p>
<p>Culturally business wise where you won&rsquo;t run into people who voted for Biden or for Trump</p>
<p>Like you cannot go to a dinner of eight people and have people have the same views</p>
<p>You cannot work in a company where people have don&rsquo;t haven&rsquo;t voted or didn&rsquo;t abuse and if you try to caricature people</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be wrong all the time</p>
<p>Even I catch myself like assuming this person of this demographic is going to be liberal and they&rsquo;re not and so here people learn to</p>
<p>Both be polite</p>
<p>Like sort of like when you&rsquo;re growing up you were taught like you don&rsquo;t debate religion in front of people at dinner</p>
<p>People are polite</p>
<p>But also they have to engage and it&rsquo;s incredibly refreshing because people learn to partake in arguments and it would be impossible to live in</p>
<p>Miami successfully unless you do this every day</p>
<p>And so I think this is a model for America like many things in Miami, but keep over time doesn&rsquo;t that transform?</p>
<p>So like isn&rsquo;t there a concentration of ideas of memetics that ultimately kind of rule the juice and you know</p>
<p>This whole thing kind of eventually</p>
<p>You end up with with you know, two pole two poles two camps</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t this how all society start the great debate the great conversation?</p>
<p>This is a microcosm of what just happens with human behavior over time</p>
<p>Because if you understand ideas and one of the benefits for me was I grew up in like the most woke environments ever</p>
<p>I spent years at Stanford and then Harvard like pretty well places and all my professors and political science were super liberal</p>
<p>But I was conservative the whole time and every one of my you know essays if you read my final exams</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all conservative because I had to learn to master all the liberal arguments and find the weaknesses and the data points and be</p>
<p>Able to marshal evidence and that&rsquo;s a healthy thing</p>
<p>So when you encounter people who have different views like for example, you know, there&rsquo;s controversial laws in Florida</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say gay quote-unquote, you know changes in abortion policy here people here will talk about them politely and debate them</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good for everybody</p>
<p>Like I bet you for example, like, you know, if you read the media or you read Twitter</p>
<p>You think this abortion law change in Florida is radical?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually more permissive than any European country</p>
<p>But nobody knows that France actually only allows abortion up to 14 weeks. Germany is like 16. So we&rsquo;re 20 here</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re more liberal than Europe, but nobody talks about that on Twitter that way</p>
<p>But if you live in Florida, you would actually know that by the way, the campus is you just described. They&rsquo;re not here anymore</p>
<p>You the amount of testimonials from students saying if I disagree with the professor on my exam, I will get a bad grade</p>
<p>Even worse again, this is there when there&rsquo;s encroachment by a low-rung giant and there&rsquo;s no pushback. It will keep going</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve gone to some crazy places. Here&rsquo;s an example in Berkeley right now and and UCLA and about 20 other schools</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>Want to apply to be a chemistry professor</p>
<p>The first thing that you do is you have to fill out a diversity statement and there and it&rsquo;s called that sounds nice a diversity</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually you have to basically prove that you have a proven track record of social justice activism of the world variety</p>
<p>Not not more MLK style social justice very specific social justice in this and if you are not a proven</p>
<p>Activist that has the right political. It&rsquo;s more than even a political litmus test</p>
<p>You have to actually be an activist to get it to even be seen by the chemistry department</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t even show the chemistry. So there&rsquo;s stories like that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like oh my god, but that&rsquo;s what happens when the immune system is failing this the things will continue</p>
<p>So what is the what is the antidote to that if we for those of us that can&rsquo;t move to Miami?</p>
<p>Well, everybody can we welcome we welcome you</p>
<p>Yeah, the antidote is leadership because what happens is in each one of these stories, you know</p>
<p>James Bennett getting fired from New York Times, right? You read the story in detail</p>
<p>you know McNeil is another example for the New York Times for a whole long story, but</p>
<p>In each story there you the leadership often because leadership is you know</p>
<p>Most people are not insane like this almost every this is again with the orange circles almost everyone</p>
<p>Actually thinks this is insane these firings and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s scary is they&rsquo;re happening</p>
<p>Anyway, so in each of these stories you see a moment when the leadership first says well, you know here we do agree</p>
<p>even though I hate his views to</p>
<p>you know, we value a diversity of a viewpoint and</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a huge pushback and there&rsquo;s a moment of truth</p>
<p>Are they gonna stand up for the Veritas and for the for the core values?</p>
<p>Are they gonna or are they going to seed the culture to the mob and what the cancel culture is is</p>
<p>these moments of truth the leadership</p>
<p>choosing cowardice and</p>
<p>The actual cudgel of social media doesn&rsquo;t actually hit the person</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the leader</p>
<p>actually going and actually firing them the leaders the one who ends up actually being standing up to the mob as opposed to letting</p>
<p>The mob rule you yes, which is which is the hard thing in a lot of these very hard to do you think about we</p>
<p>We see it at all these companies in Silicon Valley. Well, we see it when we do the podcast</p>
<p>We had a moment and we were discussing the don&rsquo;t say gay slash</p>
<p>parents choice</p>
<p>Bill which you look at the framing of that. It&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>Hilarious that like we framed it as those two things either</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like you don&rsquo;t want parents to be able to parent their kids or you hate gay people</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like really is that what we&rsquo;re talking about here?</p>
<p>And we looked at it and a couple of besties were having a conversation</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say who and we were trying to get educated on it and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>should</p>
<p>People be able to talk about their gay parents in first grade second grade third grade. Of course, you&rsquo;re a parent. You&rsquo;re gay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming you don&rsquo;t want people to be able to tell you you can&rsquo;t be talked about at school and that was like and</p>
<p>Gender assignment and what gender you choose and now we&rsquo;re sitting there going I don&rsquo;t actually know enough about this</p>
<p>Should you introduce that you can be one of 40 genders at six years old or 12 years old?</p>
<p>When should sex education start? I actually don&rsquo;t know. I we would learned at 15. Should it be 12?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know and we&rsquo;re we were like, is this a discussion we can have on the podcast?</p>
<p>without us actually</p>
<p>Consulting with some people who know more than us and discussing it and I&rsquo;ve written about three or four tweets about the the trans</p>
<p>swimmer and</p>
<p>I have feelings on it, but I&rsquo;m like should I actually</p>
<p>Tweet that I find it&rsquo;s profoundly unfair that this person gets to win every single</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s meet and I kind of feel bad for the women who now can the best they can do a second place is am I?</p>
<p>Gonna get canceled for that because that was my initial</p>
<p>response to it and I don&rsquo;t actually know my position because I don&rsquo;t know that other person&rsquo;s story who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trans woman and</p>
<p>Maybe she does deserve to be in that. I don&rsquo;t know if anybody has an answer for that</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m curious, you know from the besties themselves, you know, what what are your thoughts on?</p>
<p>Are tackling some of those things and and not getting canceled or the low back these things happen on every dimension every day</p>
<p>Which is you have more questions than answers. I think Tim you wrote it in the slide</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like you&rsquo;re navigating between high conviction and you know high knowledge</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a path and that path happens because you can talk to other people and you can ask questions and you can figure out</p>
<p>Where you are today, you can figure out where you could be tomorrow</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s not allowed anymore right on any on any dimension. It&rsquo;s not any one specific issue</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on so many topics, right?</p>
<p>And the thing with that is that it gets people very afraid and then when you are afraid I think to your point</p>
<p>What happens is you take the most simplest reductive point of view that can be the most acceptable on any topic?</p>
<p>Whatever and this is what causes this snowball</p>
<p>Literally, I&rsquo;m scared to talk about the trans issue because I feel like I don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t want to hurt anybody&rsquo;s feelings</p>
<p>I would feel terrible if I did hurt his feelings</p>
<p>So the reason you want to talk about it is because the social costs of even taking the risk of having that conversation</p>
<p>Outweighed any potential benefit. It&rsquo;s just the conversation gets so hot</p>
<p>but I want to I want to go back to what Tim said that the moment of truth is when the leader of the</p>
<p>Organization has the choice of whether to fire the person who the mobs going after it seems self-evident that the leader shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>basically join the mob and</p>
<p>inflict mob justice on this</p>
<p>poor employee</p>
<p>but they do anyway and the question is why and I would argue that</p>
<p>The reason why is because they&rsquo;re afraid of the New York Times hippies. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s what it comes down to</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid that the woke mob will come after them next and we&rsquo;ve seen it before when Brian Armstrong</p>
<p>Implemented his policy of no politics the workplace at coinbase who then retaliated against him</p>
<p>He got a New York Times hippies</p>
<p>That was they are the enforcement wing of the woke mob when Elon said that he would restore free speech to Twitter</p>
<p>What was the response the New York Times wrote an article basically trying to?</p>
<p>Identify him with the apartheid regime in South Africa</p>
<p>Even though he was a kid the headline of the article didn&rsquo;t even match up</p>
<p>With the body of the article the body of the article had one of the stories about him as a child</p>
<p>It was also a historical account of you know</p>
<p>A bunch of oppressive things that happened in South Africa and in it when he was a child, right?</p>
<p>He was so the body of the story had nothing but anecdotes about how he even as a young</p>
<p>Adolescent basically rejected apartheid and yet the headline the story was basically painting him with this brush</p>
<p>So basically calling him a racist no and and it came from his dad and they have a super complicated relationship</p>
<p>And so it was like the it was like the one person where you couldn&rsquo;t have necessarily</p>
<p>Guaranteed what would have come out of Errol&rsquo;s mouth and it was still so supportive of Elon. Yeah, right</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re gonna overcome this problem, I think we have to have this recognition</p>
<p>That you know that these</p>
<p>Prestige outlets like the New York Times who for some reason have so much credibility in our culture</p>
<p>They have the power or they used to have the power to basically destroy people&rsquo;s careers</p>
<p>we have to realize that these are just</p>
<p>Places that have been hijacked by radicals and like their stories are meaningless. They&rsquo;re completely biased</p>
<p>We have to stop investing them with the cultural power to like destroy people</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple happens is there&rsquo;s a lag time now do Fox News</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t here&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the cultural power to destroy anyone and who have they destroyed named somebody that like what woke mob have they engineered?</p>
<p>Mike the pillow guy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they wouldn&rsquo;t if they could I&rsquo;m just saying that they can&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t have that kind of cultural power</p>
<p>Before we Tim you were gonna say something</p>
<p>I was gonna say when an institution like this gets what happens is a</p>
<p>Mob like this that they don&rsquo;t build anything, you know, they don&rsquo;t create what they do is they appropriate they hijack</p>
<p>Something they take its existing good reputation, which is real power, which is a lot of power and they spend it down</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not constructive. It&rsquo;s destructive. Yeah</p>
<p>Yes, but they&rsquo;ll actually go in like it&rsquo;s like they like they take over and they and they spend the reputation down</p>
<p>But in the lag time between when the reputation catches up it can do a ton of damage</p>
<p>So again, I would say that you know a lot</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared about what&rsquo;s going on in like Ivy League institutions that they have so much</p>
<p>Credibility, but in a lot of really bad things have kind of happened there and it&rsquo;s a yeah</p>
<p>Can I suggest we pivot to tech and investing while we&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>Keith and I were talking backstage and I was like what investments have you made?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve made no investments in 2022 and you guys have like how big your latest fund</p>
<p>5 billion 5 billion dollar latest fund and you haven&rsquo;t made any investments and you know</p>
<p>The fund as a whole has made some investments. I haven&rsquo;t let any but you have it</p>
<p>Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t let any new investments in 2022. Yeah last year</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d led the 13 or 14 in a year</p>
<p>So to go to you to go to effectively zero for half the year is like me being on vacation</p>
<p>Can you tell us what your point of view is? Well, I mean I tweeted in October</p>
<p>But you know that we were at the height of the market</p>
<p>I tweeted last January that we&rsquo;re gonna see mm all over again. And so privately internally</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been arguing this internally that this is exactly what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>And so, you know, my behavior should reflect my views. I believe in some consistency and harmonization</p>
<p>So if I believe tech stocks and tech companies aren&rsquo;t worth that much</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be investing until they reset and so I don&rsquo;t want to spend money and invest in companies that aren&rsquo;t gonna make me money</p>
<p>My job is to ultimately return billions of dollars to my LPs</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t do that, I shouldn&rsquo;t be giving anybody any money. So when do you change your mind?</p>
<p>Well, there are founders who are ahead of the curve</p>
<p>There always are who understand where the world&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>They actually understand the world where the world&rsquo;s going better than I do</p>
<p>They actually teach me about where the world&rsquo;s going more typically and if they have appropriate expectations, I&rsquo;m happy to invest</p>
<p>So the last three or four investments I did make actually were all interestingly enough about 1.5 million dollar investments</p>
<p>Where the founder walked in and said, you know, I don&rsquo;t need a lot of money. I could accomplish a lot</p>
<p>I can achieve it inflection moments for a very small amount of capital. That was the easiest thing ever to say</p>
<p>Yes at 1.5 million dollars. I don&rsquo;t need to think about the macro world</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to think about where the you know</p>
<p>Nasdaq&rsquo;s going and so the last three or four investments were all incredibly disciplined founders that I made like late last year into</p>
<p>Arguably into January now we have doubled down just to be clear about our conversation</p>
<p>We have doubled down in portfolio companies where we&rsquo;ve led new rounds</p>
<p>But as far as a new investment from scratch, I haven&rsquo;t made any new ones this year</p>
<p>So when you double down in a moment like this, how do you set valuation, especially if the last valuation was maybe</p>
<p>Felt like a top tick. If I think the founder has sort of digested where the world is then, you know</p>
<p>We have a dialogue about valuation</p>
<p>Otherwise, I actually encourage them to go shop it like I&rsquo;m saying like we will give you money</p>
<p>But will you price it at the same mark at a discount?</p>
<p>No, if they have a fair market valuation from top tier firms</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try to be like in that zone</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll often go to the market and people will be like either pass pass pass pass pass or they will give them</p>
<p>You know just reality and then we&rsquo;ll match that but we&rsquo;ve done that a few times where we&rsquo;ve encouraged founders typically we wouldn&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>Because my partner Brian Singerman loves to power money to companies that are working</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been we&rsquo;ve been a high conviction fund for about a decade</p>
<p>So typically if we like a company will lead the next round and lead the next round</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done this with ramp. For example, we&rsquo;ve led like three or four rounds</p>
<p>But now with a valuation reset going on it&rsquo;s been easier sometimes with founders</p>
<p>I really like to say why don&rsquo;t you go talk to five?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just like go talk to five other people and I&rsquo;ll match what they do if they&rsquo;re really top-tier people</p>
<p>But like I want you to get like fair market feedback, you know</p>
<p>Not just have to rely upon my judgment car. Are we at the point in the cycle where the down rounds the warrants?</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>liquidation preferences have</p>
<p>Happened or are starting to be discussed definitely seen a lot of like preferences again</p>
<p>Explain what it is and why that&rsquo;s important. Yeah, so liquidation preference basically means that</p>
<p>The investor is going to get their money back first</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens in the world and that nobody who&rsquo;s a shareholder</p>
<p>Nobody who&rsquo;s a founder is gonna get it</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s a common shareholder, which basically means founder employee is gonna get any money until</p>
<p>the investor gets all their money back times some multiple and that multiple is based on time and or just a hurdle it&rsquo;s very scary</p>
<p>But it can be arbitraged by success</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s founders sometimes can arbitrage it</p>
<p>Well, meaning they have asymmetric information about the future of the company if they really believe they can hit escape velocity in a short period</p>
<p>Of time it can be a decent gamble. I&rsquo;ve seen someone like Jack Dorsey at square did this very sophisticated</p>
<p>CEO and he knew what he was doing and knew why he was doing it and it&rsquo;s worked out pretty well actually</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re playing with a lot of fire</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not for everybody and you should get a lot of feedback and advice before</p>
<p>The flat rounds are definitely happening. The new flat is the up round kind of philosophy even in some of our better</p>
<p>Are those senior like prep for Perry? It depends</p>
<p>another round</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all over the map</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the market hasn&rsquo;t shifted to the point that every new money coming in senior to all other money</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how much leverage and what quality investors you have on your cap table</p>
<p>Like sir, for example, someone tries to put a senior like preference on top of my capital</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna yell at them a lot and if they ever want a new investment that were you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from our fund. They may not want to do that. Yeah, I think that we&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>Couple turns away. That&rsquo;s what the Godfather the discount rounds</p>
<p>Well, some companies are gonna have to try the problem is like for example, we don&rsquo;t like to do those rounds</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much brain damage in the politics of that with founders require a walk us through that</p>
<p>Why tell us about that brain down?</p>
<p>so typically if I found you think there&rsquo;s an efficient market of pricing right like I need this much capital and the markets gonna</p>
<p>float what the price of that capital is in</p>
<p>Private capital. It&rsquo;s not really true</p>
<p>like so if someone comes to me and says, you know, my last round was done at 300 million, you know nine months ago and</p>
<p>Today it probably get priced at let&rsquo;s say 120 million</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more likely to say no than to give them an offer at 120</p>
<p>because I know their prior investors and their prior employees are gonna be mad at me and furious at me and I don&rsquo;t want a</p>
<p>lot of</p>
<p>Founders and people annoyed at me and so that brain damage isn&rsquo;t worth it</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m more likely and our fund is more likely to say no then try to find whether 80 100 120 140 is the appropriate price</p>
<p>Which is very bad for the company in some ways because you they might need the capital you starve them of money</p>
<p>Yeah, no, they may be able to find somebody else</p>
<p>But we typically a founders fund really don&rsquo;t like to do those rounds</p>
<p>The only way we would consider it is pretty much of everybody on the cap table called us up the founder of CEO</p>
<p>The board members prior investors said we really want you to do this and like we&rsquo;re all collectively holding hands and want you to do</p>
<p>This then we seriously consider it. Do you at the end of q1?</p>
<p>Do you guys sit around and reset valuations and marks before you tell your LPs what these companies are worth meaning your own sense when</p>
<p>You sort of generate a sense of valuations. Like yeah, we do mark down actively mark. We do proactively mark down</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your methodology for that?</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s views</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be open to doing that if we felt like we had an objective methodology for doing it&rsquo;s very tricky</p>
<p>I think you can if you it later stage ones a little bit easier because you can apply multiples</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s public comp, you know public comps and you just adjust to that</p>
<p>I think the earlier stage stuff</p>
<p>Very difficult to do objectively and it&rsquo;s also not that set</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably not as sensitive to it in terms of what it move how it moves a needle</p>
<p>But the growth stuff we try to use public comps and be like realistic</p>
<p>What do you think about let&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;ll just throw out some firms just if you had to guess</p>
<p>The next 18 months for some of these folks SoftBank</p>
<p>Vision fund one. I mean, you know, my views on SoftBank have been obvious since I did New York Times of all things interview</p>
<p>2016 you should reread the transcript, but I was like that strategy just does not work</p>
<p>Powering money into companies and hoping that money is the key asset in a key ingredient for success has been</p>
<p>False and in the history of technology for 50 years and so that you know</p>
<p>They lost 27 billion dollars again the brand subprime they used to do well in Latin America</p>
<p>But they got rid of the person who actually knew what he was doing. So this is a catastrophic mess</p>
<p>Plus it has moral issues, you know less moral issues than before but still, you know, not not the best investor tiger. I</p>
<p>Think they have a skill set gap if they&rsquo;re going to try it from what I read publicly</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to invest in series a and series B companies the skill to be successful at investing series a and series B companies</p>
<p>Is very different than leading growth rounds or private or public growth rounds</p>
<p>I mean we look at this in our fund and we do both we have a venture fund of 1.8 billion in a growth fund</p>
<p>Of 3.2 billion and we have part the investment team is basically the same</p>
<p>most of the investment team</p>
<p>Maybe all the investment team is better at one or the other and if Tiger thinks that they&rsquo;re going to be successful series a investors</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in for a very rude awakening</p>
<p>I know about five or ten people on the planet that are successful series a investors</p>
<p>It is a very different discipline than deploying capital writ large. Yeah Sequoia</p>
<p>I think you know Sequoia is the best run fund historically</p>
<p>They are really good at what they do</p>
<p>Obviously the world is changing around them like I think like many people crypto</p>
<p>You know is kind of throwing them a little monkey wrench in their model. They have to scale explain that. What do you mean?</p>
<p>They missed the first wave of crypto and crypto, you know</p>
<p>Has returned a decent amount of money for people and so I think that&rsquo;s tarnished the brand a bit with crypto people specifically</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re working on fixing that they have a really good team</p>
<p>The team is aging still pretty well. One of the hardest things in venture is you age non gracefully in this job</p>
<p>You know by the time you&rsquo;re my age</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably to you&rsquo;re already past your prime and you know</p>
<p>I kind of compare it because I went to law school with people who are u.s</p>
<p>Senators and I had breakfast in Miami with one of the more prominent u.s</p>
<p>Senators and I said I&rsquo;m basically getting to the tail end of my career in tech and he said I&rsquo;ll be the bottom</p>
<p>20% of the youngest 20% in the US Senate and so there&rsquo;s a big contrast</p>
<p>But anyway, I think I think they&rsquo;re excellent to what they do. We&rsquo;re boy for Senate. Sorry. We&rsquo;re boy for Senate</p>
<p>You might run for Senate. Oh, I&rsquo;m not running for Senate. No, maybe my husband second career</p>
<p>Take the politics and reason</p>
<p>In crypto, they&rsquo;re excellent</p>
<p>Missing the last crypto</p>
<p>insanity if this thing does all get torched as it seems to be and</p>
<p>Nobody shipping actual products that touch customers that actually saw problems in the world</p>
<p>Sitting out, you know that crazy</p>
<p>frenetic</p>
<p>moment might actually look astute because</p>
<p>you know some of these projects I</p>
<p>Do not see them shipping products. I think that you&rsquo;re saying something that&rsquo;s practically true</p>
<p>But I think Keith is also saying something that is practically true, which is if you&rsquo;re a fund</p>
<p>That has that crypto deal flow at least my understanding of that playbook is you seed a project</p>
<p>You make sure that you get some amount of the float of tokens</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to monetize those tokens very quickly. And so as long as you&rsquo;re in the flow</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s money to be made</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made and I think what Keith is saying and this is where it&rsquo;s a quiet may have made</p>
<p>An excellent decision, which is that form of money-making is not very reliable</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of questions about that. Once there&rsquo;s a regulatory framework. Yes, and it might</p>
<p>Three points mostly I agree with that</p>
<p>I think first of all, it depends what you think your vision of what a venture fund does or what you do as a partner</p>
<p>So to me, I think I&rsquo;m in the company building mode. And so people who are not building companies</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really interested in making money. I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not in a hedge fund mode</p>
<p>So tokens without successful products and iconic companies aren&rsquo;t interesting to me, even if they return capital</p>
<p>We did think at founders fund though that all the alpha was in Bitcoin</p>
<p>So going back a decade not me</p>
<p>but my partners bought a lot of Bitcoin and we made a lot of money with Bitcoin because we thought the alpha was there not</p>
<p>In the company building a year or two ago. We started to shift and I think appropriately</p>
<p>I think there may be some alpha now. We&rsquo;re in the end of one business founders fund meaning the right founder</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth us investing the wrong founder</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not and so there are crypto projects and crypto companies where the founder is</p>
<p>Extraordinary and we would love to be the primary investor if we can and then there&rsquo;s a bunch of other companies that might be successful</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not our business</p>
<p>We are the end of one find the next Eli</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the fundamental problem that a lot of the way these crypto</p>
<p>Projects are designed is that you don&rsquo;t have protective provisions preferred shares and the operating system that venture runs on</p>
<p>Nothing and they&rsquo;re asking you to give them a donation of a hundred million dollars for a token that has some Panamanian</p>
<p>Foundation and you don&rsquo;t have a board seat. I mean this seems incredibly high-risk and undisciplined</p>
<p>They are they are high risk, but we&rsquo;re in the business of high risk in some ways like the protective provisions</p>
<p>I think we don&rsquo;t really care that much about them at founders fund is one of the theses that you know</p>
<p>Peter started the fund with which is these terms are way overrated that ultimately the companies that succeed or the really the Facebook&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>Palantir&rsquo;s, you know the SpaceX is that&rsquo;s where you make your money in this business and worrying about what goes wrong</p>
<p>Is actually words they do have boards and I actually believe in boards</p>
<p>But I believe in boards as being a mentor consigliere not in governance. Of course. Okay, great, but you&rsquo;re not buying</p>
<p>Chuckie cheese, like I never give a term sheet</p>
<p>I never give a term sheet that has a board provision for me</p>
<p>The founders requires me to join the board got it</p>
<p>But I mean that the tokens are I think are part of the problem that I can&rsquo;t get my head around</p>
<p>Yes, the issue with tokens a little more structural of when you have liquidity prior to success</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily a good incentive</p>
<p>Like I think success liquidity should follow success with product follow with users follow attraction not be in advance</p>
<p>So what happens to those teams when they get flush with a billion dollars in tokens or a hundred million in tokens?</p>
<p>They wind down the project haven&rsquo;t shipped the product. Yeah, it has misaligned miss misaligned or bad or perverse incentives all over</p>
<p>Talk about you you&rsquo;re mentioning in the back</p>
<p>in a moment like this</p>
<p>The people that it&rsquo;s hardest for right after the entrepreneur is you said the junior partners at these organizations</p>
<p>Just described the dynamic now of having to run an organization where you&rsquo;re trying to tell people just go to the beach for a year</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>I think look the way you make sure the way you become successful in venture is you give money to a founder who turns it</p>
<p>Into an iconic company. That is how you get promoted, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the job. And so if you tell your colleagues like well, don&rsquo;t make any investments right now</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking in the back of the mind. Well, how do I how do I become successful?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy for me to say this is easier for Peter to say this is easier for Brian to say this</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not so easy for people who want to make their career to say don&rsquo;t make any investments</p>
<p>Now that said if you make a lot of bad investments Semel Shah has a good blog post about this</p>
<p>Your portfolio is your career once you make five or ten investments in venture if those aren&rsquo;t good. You&rsquo;re never gonna get great</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a single example of like a VC who became successful exactly where the first five or seven exactly didn&rsquo;t show some signs of brilliance</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally the story of the people on the stage right now</p>
<p>Is that we either got lucky or we were good or some combination of the early investments actually hitting?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely worse like my first five investments three of them became public companies and stuff like</p>
<p>Definitely worse than I used to I mean I hit two unicorns in the first four. How does it happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just luck. I think I do think there&rsquo;s some luck to it or maybe your network network</p>
<p>So for me, it was easy because these were people that we worked David and I worked with at PayPal</p>
<p>And I was smart enough to at least you know</p>
<p>Follow the people that were launching companies after PayPal and give them some money</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have to know much about venture other than just follow my former colleagues</p>
<p>We have to wrap and go to lunch. We&rsquo;re gonna end with Sachs telling us</p>
<p>his most illustrative and</p>
<p>funny</p>
<p>Story about Keith Raboi. Oh my god from Stanford</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so many good ones some great moment with Keith. I</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>The two of you this is you could you could feel the friendship and all the memories coming through for Sachs right now</p>
<p>All these great I could flip it Keith and maybe since I like the work that Keith and I did at PayPal better</p>
<p>I guess yeah, whatever Stanford PayPal. Give us them. Give us the moment. What do you think of the best stories?</p>
<p>Well one good one that I think is instructive is you know, like I was kind of this opinionated person running around all the time</p>
<p>Probably half right half wrong and David was basically running the company at the time and</p>
<p>I could occasionally sabotage some projects and David had a really good way of reframing and channeling my energy</p>
<p>Which I think is applicable to most people</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like basically I don&rsquo;t mind if you send me any of this feedback</p>
<p>But you have to send it to me</p>
<p>Directly not to other people and then you would like filter it if it&rsquo;s like if you were like if it&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll act on and if not, you know, etc. I&rsquo;ll debate it with you, but it was actually constructive for the organization</p>
<p>So I felt liberalized</p>
<p>liberal liberalized to basically give the feedback and try to you know</p>
<p>Edit our course and it would be channeled in use useful, but it wasn&rsquo;t distracting people</p>
<p>And so I think that is something like a lesson</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken with me that I actually now uses a CEO. I heard I this is what&rsquo;s so crazy about this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this exact story from Reid Hoffman. Tell me that about you</p>
<p>I think it was either it was either PayPal or at LinkedIn where you would probably say</p>
<p>And it was just like lighting everybody and everything on</p>
<p>I read it like letters from the boy. I reread the emails and I&rsquo;m like shit. I can&rsquo;t write that well anymore</p>
<p>Letters from her boy a memoir. Let&rsquo;s give it up. He&rsquo;s her boy</p>
<p>Let your winners ride</p>
<p>Rainman David</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>You</p>
