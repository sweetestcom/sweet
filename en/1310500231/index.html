    <p>The following is a conversation with Sean Kelly, a philosopher at Harvard specializing</p>
<p>in existentialism and the philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Sean Kelly.</p>
<p>Your interests are in postcontinent European philosophy, especially phenomenology and existentialism.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what to you is existentialism?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a hard question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m teaching a course on existentialism right now.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>I am, yeah.</p>
<p>Existentialism in literature and film, which is fun.</p>
<p>I mean, the traditional thing to say about what existentialism is, is that it&rsquo;s a movement</p>
<p>in mid 20th century, mostly French, some German philosophy, and some of the major figures</p>
<p>associated with it are people like Jean Paul Sartre and Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, maybe</p>
<p>Martin Heidegger, but that&rsquo;s a weird thing to say about it because most of those people</p>
<p>denied that they were existentialists.</p>
<p>And in fact, I think of it as a movement that has a much longer history.</p>
<p>So when I try to describe what the core idea of existentialism is, it&rsquo;s an idea that you</p>
<p>find expressed in different ways in a bunch of these people.</p>
<p>One of the ways that it&rsquo;s expressed is that Sartre will say that existentialism is the</p>
<p>view that there is no God, at least his form of existentialism, he calls it atheistic existentialism.</p>
<p>There is no God.</p>
<p>And since there&rsquo;s no God, there must be some other being around who does something like</p>
<p>what God does, otherwise there wouldn&rsquo;t be any possibility for significance in a life.</p>
<p>And that being is us and the feature of us according to Sartre and the other existentialists</p>
<p>that puts us in the position to be able to play that role is that we&rsquo;re the beings for</p>
<p>whom as Sartre says it, existence precedes essence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the catchphrase for existentialism and then you have to try to figure out what</p>
<p>it means.</p>
<p>What is existence?</p>
<p>What is presence?</p>
<p>And what does precedes mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>What is existence?</p>
<p>What is essence?</p>
<p>And what is precedes?</p>
<p>And in fact, precedes is Sartre&rsquo;s way of talking about it and other people will talk about</p>
<p>it differently.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the way Sartre thinks about it.</p>
<p>This is not, I think, the most interesting way to think about it, but it gets you started.</p>
<p>Sartre says there&rsquo;s nothing true about what it is to be you until you start existing and</p>
<p>still use until you start living.</p>
<p>And for Sartre, the core feature of what it is to be existing the way we do is to be making</p>
<p>decisions, to be making choices in your life, to be sort of taking a stand on what it is</p>
<p>to be you by deciding to do this or that.</p>
<p>And the key feature of how to do that right for Sartre is to do it in the full recognition</p>
<p>of the fact that when you make that choice, nobody is responsible for it other than you.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t make the choice because God tells you to.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t make the choice because some utilitarian calculus about what it&rsquo;s right to do tells</p>
<p>you to do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t make the choice because some other philosophical theory tells you to do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally nothing on the basis of which you make the choice other than the fact</p>
<p>that in that moment, you are the one making it.</p>
<p>You are a conscious thinking being that made a decision.</p>
<p>So all of the questions about physics and free will are out the window.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If you were a determinist about the mind, if you were a physicalist about the mind,</p>
<p>if you thought there was nothing to your choices other than the activity of the brain that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>governed by physical laws, then there&rsquo;s some sense in which it would seem at any rate like</p>
<p>you are not the ground of that choice.</p>
<p>The ground of that choice was the physical universe and the laws that govern it, and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;d have no responsibility.</p>
<p>And so Sartre&rsquo;s view is that the thing that&rsquo;s special about us used to be special about</p>
<p>God is that we&rsquo;re responsible for becoming the being that makes the choices that we do.</p>
<p>And Sartre thinks that that&rsquo;s simultaneously empowering, I mean, it practically puts us</p>
<p>in the place of God, and also terrifying because what responsibility?</p>
<p>How can you possibly take on that responsibility?</p>
<p>And he thinks it&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>
<p>He thinks that it&rsquo;s always happening, everything that you do is the result of some choice that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve made, the posture that you sit in, the way you hold someone&rsquo;s gaze when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having a conversation with them or not, the choice to make a note when someone says something</p>
<p>or not make a note.</p>
<p>Everything that you do presents you as a being who makes decisions and you&rsquo;re responsible</p>
<p>for all of them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s constantly happening.</p>
<p>And furthermore, there&rsquo;s no fact about you independent of the choices and actions you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>performed.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get to say, Sartre&rsquo;s example, I really am a great writer, just haven&rsquo;t written</p>
<p>my great book yet.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t written your great book, you&rsquo;re not a great writer.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s terrifying, it puts a huge burden on us, and that&rsquo;s why Sartre says on his view</p>
<p>of existentialism, human beings are the beings that are condemned to be free.</p>
<p>Our freedom consists in our ability and our responsibility to make these choices and to</p>
<p>become someone through making them.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t get away from that.</p>
<p>But to him, it&rsquo;s terrifying not liberating in the positive meaning of the word liberating.</p>
<p>Well, so he thinks it should be liberating, but he thinks that it takes a very courageous</p>
<p>individual to be liberated by it.</p>
<p>Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar.</p>
<p>I think Sartre is really coming out of a Nietzschean sort of tradition.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s liberating about it, if it is, is also terrifying because it means in a certain</p>
<p>way, you&rsquo;re the ground of your own being.</p>
<p>You become what you do through existing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one form of existentialism, that&rsquo;s a stark atheistic version of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of other versions, but it&rsquo;s somehow organized around the idea that it&rsquo;s through</p>
<p>living your life that you become who you are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not facts that are sort of true about you independent of your living your life.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s no God in that view.</p>
<p>Does any of the decisions matter?</p>
<p>So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s two different ways that you&rsquo;re asking it.</p>
<p>Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second and think about mattering or is there</p>
<p>any way that you can criticize someone for living the way they do if you&rsquo;re in existentialism?</p>
<p>Including yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sartre addresses that and he says, yes, he says, there is a criticism that you can make</p>
<p>of yourself or of others and it&rsquo;s the criticism of living in such a way as to fail to take</p>
<p>responsibility for your choices.</p>
<p>He gives these two sort of amazing examples.</p>
<p>One doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it reads as well for us as it did in sort of mid 20th century Paris,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about a waiter.</p>
<p>He gives this in his big book, Being and Nothingness.</p>
<p>And he says, so waiters played, still do I think in a certain way in Paris, a big role</p>
<p>in Parisian society.</p>
<p>To be a waiter involved having a certain kind of identity, being a certain way, taking control</p>
<p>of and charge of the experience of the people that you&rsquo;re waiting on, but also really being</p>
<p>the authority, knowing that this is the way it&rsquo;s supposed to go.</p>
<p>And so Sartre imagines a waiter who does everything that a waiter is supposed to do, the perfect</p>
<p>form of the waiter, except that you can somehow see in the way he&rsquo;s doing it that he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>it because he believes that&rsquo;s the way a waiter should act.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some sense in which he&rsquo;s passing off the responsibility for his actions onto</p>
<p>some idea of what those actions should be.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not taking responsibility for it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sort of playing a role and the contours of the role are predetermined by someone other</p>
<p>than him.</p>
<p>So he starts as acting in bad faith and that&rsquo;s criticizable because it&rsquo;s acting in such a</p>
<p>way as to fail to take responsibility for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not taking responsibility.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>And I think any teenager, if you&rsquo;ve ever met a teenager, you&rsquo;ve known someone who does</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Teenagers try on roles.</p>
<p>They think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll dress like this, or if I spoke like this, or acted like this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s natural for a teenager who&rsquo;s trying to figure out what their identity is to go</p>
<p>through a phase like that.</p>
<p>But if you continue to do that, then you&rsquo;re really passing it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>And the other example he gives is an example not of passing off responsibility by pretending</p>
<p>that someone else is the ground of your choice, but passing off responsibility by pretending</p>
<p>that you might be able to get away with not making a choice at all.</p>
<p>So he says, everything you do is a result of your choices.</p>
<p>And so he gives this other example.</p>
<p>Where you are on the first date, first date.</p>
<p>And the date, the evening reaches moments when it might be appropriate for one person</p>
<p>to hold the hand of the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the moment in the date where you are.</p>
<p>And so you make a choice.</p>
<p>You decide, I think it&rsquo;s that time, and you hold the hand.</p>
<p>And what should happen is that the other person also makes a choice on Sartre&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>Either they reject the hand, not that time, and I&rsquo;m taking responsibility for that, or</p>
<p>they grasp the hand back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a choice.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a thing that sometimes happens, which is that the other person leaves the</p>
<p>hand there cold, dead, and clammy, neither rejecting it nor embracing it.</p>
<p>And Sartre says, that&rsquo;s also bad faith, that&rsquo;s also acting as if we&rsquo;re a kind of being that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not, because it pretends that it&rsquo;s possible not to make a choice.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re the beings who are always making choices.</p>
<p>That was a choice.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re pretending as if it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that you don&rsquo;t have to take responsibility</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>So both of the examples you&rsquo;ve given, there&rsquo;s some sense in which the social interactions</p>
<p>between humans is a kind of moving away from the full responsibility that you as a human</p>
<p>in the view of existentialism should take on.</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t the basic conversation, a delegation of responsibility, just holding a hand there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting some of the responsibility into the court of the other person.</p>
<p>And for the waiter, if you exist in a society, you are generally trying on a role.</p>
<p>I mean, all of us are trying on a role.</p>
<p>Me wearing clothes is me trying on a role that I was told to try, as opposed to walking</p>
<p>around naked all the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s standards of how you operate, and that&rsquo;s a decision that&rsquo;s not my own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s me seeing what everyone else is doing and copying them.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So Sartre thinks that in the ideal, you should try to resist that.</p>
<p>Other existentialists think that that&rsquo;s actually a clue to how you should live well.</p>
<p>So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people.</p>
<p>Why is hell other people for Sartre?</p>
<p>Well, because other people are making choices also.</p>
<p>And when other people make choices, they put some pressure on me to think that the choice</p>
<p>they made is one that I should copy or one that I should promote.</p>
<p>But if I do it because they did it, then I&rsquo;m in bad faith for Sartre.</p>
<p>So it is as if Sartre&rsquo;s view is like, we would be better if we were all alone.</p>
<p>I mean, this is really simplifying Sartre&rsquo;s position, and this is really just mostly Sartre</p>
<p>in a certain period of his formation.</p>
<p>But anyhow, we can imagine that view.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something to the idea that Sartre is attracted to it, at least in</p>
<p>the mid 40s.</p>
<p>Can you dig into hell as other people?</p>
<p>Is there some, obviously, it&rsquo;s kind of almost like a literary, like you push the point strongly</p>
<p>to really explore that point.</p>
<p>But is there some sense in that other people ruin the experience of what it means to be</p>
<p>human?</p>
<p>I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this, like, it&rsquo;s not just that you wear clothes</p>
<p>because people wear clothes in our society, like you have a particular style, you wear</p>
<p>a particular kind of clothes.</p>
<p>And for Sartre, like to have that style authentically, in good faith, rather than in bad faith, it</p>
<p>has to come from you, you have to make the choice.</p>
<p>But other people are making choices also, and like, you&rsquo;re looking at their choices</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking, that guy looks good, maybe I could try that one on.</p>
<p>And if you try it on because you were influenced by the fact that you thought that guy was</p>
<p>doing it well, then there&rsquo;s some important sense in which, although that&rsquo;s a resource</p>
<p>for a choice for you, it&rsquo;s also acting in bad faith.</p>
<p>And God wouldn&rsquo;t do that, right?</p>
<p>God wouldn&rsquo;t be influenced by other&rsquo;s decisions, and if that&rsquo;s the model, then I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the sense in which he thinks hell is other people.</p>
<p>What do you think parenting is then?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what, because God doesn&rsquo;t have a parent, so aren&rsquo;t we significantly influenced,</p>
<p>first of all, in the first few years of life, and even the teenager is resisting, like,</p>
<p>learning through resistance.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I think what you&rsquo;re pushing on is the intuition that the ideal that Sartre&rsquo;s</p>
<p>aiming at is a kind of inhuman ideal.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s many ways in which we&rsquo;re not like the traditional view of what God was.</p>
<p>One is that we&rsquo;re not self generating, we have parents, we were raised into traditions</p>
<p>and social norms, and we&rsquo;re raised into an understanding of what&rsquo;s appropriate and inappropriate</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a deep intuition.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Martin Heidegger, who&rsquo;s the philosopher that Sartre thinks he&rsquo;s sort of taking this from,</p>
<p>but I think Sartre&rsquo;s a kind of brilliant French misinterpretation of Heidegger&rsquo;s German phenomenological</p>
<p>view, Heidegger says, a crucial aspect of what it is to be us is our thrownness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thrown into a situation, we&rsquo;re thrown into history, we&rsquo;re thrown into our parental</p>
<p>lineage, and we don&rsquo;t choose it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s stuff that we don&rsquo;t choose, we couldn&rsquo;t choose.</p>
<p>If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe, but we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re finite in the sense that we have a beginning that we never chose.</p>
<p>We have an end that we&rsquo;re often trying to resist or put off or something, and in between</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of stuff that organizes us without our ever having made the choice</p>
<p>and without the kind of being that could make the choice to allow it to organize us.</p>
<p>We have a complicated relationship to that stuff, and I think we should talk about that</p>
<p>at a certain point.</p>
<p>But the first move is to say, Sartre&rsquo;s just got a sort of descriptive problem.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s missed this basic fact that there has to be an awful lot about us that&rsquo;s settled</p>
<p>without our having made the choice to settle it that way.</p>
<p>Right, the thrownness of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fundamental part of life, you can&rsquo;t just escape it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t escape it altogether.</p>
<p>Altogether.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t escape it altogether.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, you are riding a wave and you make a decision in the riding of the wave.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t control the wave, but you should be, as you ride it, you should be making certain</p>
<p>kinds of decisions and take responsibility for it.</p>
<p>So why does this matter at all, the chain of decisions you make?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Well, because they constitute you.</p>
<p>They make you the person that you are.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the opposite view?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this view against?</p>
<p>This view is against most of philosophy from Plato forward.</p>
<p>Plato says in the Republic, it&rsquo;s a kind of myth, but he says, people will understand</p>
<p>their condition well if we tell them this myth.</p>
<p>He says, look, when you&rsquo;re born, there&rsquo;s just a fact about you.</p>
<p>Your soul is either gold, silver, or bronze.</p>
<p>Those are the three kinds of people there are, and you&rsquo;re born that way.</p>
<p>And if your soul is gold, then we should identify that and make you a philosopher king.</p>
<p>And if your soul is silver, well, you&rsquo;re not gonna be a philosopher king.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not capable of it, but you could be a good warrior and we should make you that.</p>
<p>And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer, laborer, something like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fact about you that identifies you forever and for always, independent of</p>
<p>anything you do about it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the alternative view.</p>
<p>And you could have modern versions of it.</p>
<p>You could say the thing that identifies you is your IQ or your genetic makeup or the percentage</p>
<p>of fast switch muscle fibers you&rsquo;ve got or whatever, it could be something totally independent</p>
<p>of any choice that you&rsquo;ve made, independent of the kind of thing about which you could</p>
<p>make a choice and it categorizes you.</p>
<p>It makes you the person that you are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that Sartre and the existentialists are against.</p>
<p>So this idea that something about you is forever limiting the space of possible decisions you</p>
<p>can make.</p>
<p>Sartre says, no, the space is unlimited.</p>
<p>Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom.</p>
<p>Radical freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah, radical freedom.</p>
<p>And then you could have other existentialists who say, look, we are free, but we gotta understand</p>
<p>the way in which our freedom is limited by certain aspects of the kind of being that</p>
<p>we are.</p>
<p>If we were radically free, we really would be like God in the traditional medieval sense.</p>
<p>And sort of these folks start with the idea that whatever we are, that&rsquo;s a kind of limit</p>
<p>point that we&rsquo;re not gonna reach.</p>
<p>So what are the ways in which we&rsquo;re constrained that that being the way the medieval&rsquo;s understood</p>
<p>him wasn&rsquo;t constrained?</p>
<p>So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism and is it at all a useful other sort of group</p>
<p>of ideas that you resist against in defining existentialism?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular, although it was used before</p>
<p>him as Nietzsche, Nietzsche&rsquo;s writing in the end of the 19th century, in various places</p>
<p>where he published things, but largely in his unpublished works, he identifies the condition</p>
<p>of the modern world as nihilistic, and that&rsquo;s a descriptive claim.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking around him, trying to figure out what it&rsquo;s like to be us now, and he says</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot different from what it was like to be human in 1300 or in the 5th century</p>
<p>BCE.</p>
<p>In 1300, like what people believed, the way they lived their lives was in the understanding</p>
<p>that to be human was to be created in the image and likeness of God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way they understood themselves.</p>
<p>And also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve&rsquo;s transgression in the Garden of Eden,</p>
<p>and to have the project of trying to understand how, as a sinful being, you could nevertheless</p>
<p>live a virtuous life.</p>
<p>How could you do that?</p>
<p>And it had to do with, for them, getting in the right relation to God.</p>
<p>Nietzsche says that doesn&rsquo;t make sense to us anymore in the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p>God is dead, says Nietzsche famously.</p>
<p>And what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it means something like the role that God used to play in our understanding of ourselves</p>
<p>as a culture isn&rsquo;t a role that God can play anymore.</p>
<p>And so Nietzsche says the role that God used to play was the role of grounding our existence.</p>
<p>He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are.</p>
<p>And Nietzsche says the idea that there is a being that makes us what we are doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make sense anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Sartre&rsquo;s atheism, Sartre is taking that from Nietzsche.</p>
<p>And so the question is, what does ground our existence?</p>
<p>And the answer is Nihil, nothing.</p>
<p>And so nihilism is the idea that there&rsquo;s nothing outside of us that grounds our existence.</p>
<p>And then Nietzsche asked the question, well, what are we supposed to do about that?</p>
<p>How do we live?</p>
<p>And I think Nietzsche has a different story than Sartre about that.</p>
<p>Nietzsche doesn&rsquo;t emphasize this notion of radical freedom.</p>
<p>Nietzsche emphasizes something else.</p>
<p>He says, we&rsquo;re artists of life.</p>
<p>And artists are interesting because the natural way of thinking about artists is that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>responding to something.</p>
<p>They find themselves in a situation and they say, this is what&rsquo;s going to make sense of</p>
<p>the situation.</p>
<p>This is what I have to write.</p>
<p>This is the way I have to dance.</p>
<p>This is the way I&rsquo;ve got to play the music.</p>
<p>And Nietzsche says, we should live like that.</p>
<p>There are constraints, but understanding what they are is a complicated aspect of living</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a great story, I think, from music that maybe helps to understand this.</p>
<p>I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn&rsquo;t exist when Nietzsche was writing, but I think</p>
<p>Nietzsche really is thinking of something like jazz improvisation.</p>
<p>He talks about improvisation, there&rsquo;s classical improvisation.</p>
<p>Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician.</p>
<p>He was a composer and a pianist, not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music.</p>
<p>And Herbie Hancock, who&rsquo;s a pianist, a jazz pianist, who played with Miles Davis for quite</p>
<p>a while in the 60s, tells this kind of incredible story that I think exemplifies Nietzsche&rsquo;s</p>
<p>view about the way in which we bear some responsibility for being creative and that gives us a certain</p>
<p>kind of freedom, but we don&rsquo;t have the radical freedom that Sartre thinks.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the story?</p>
<p>Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart, he says, playing a show and things</p>
<p>were great, he says.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a young pianist and Miles Davis is the master.</p>
<p>And he says, I&rsquo;m back in the solo and I&rsquo;m playing these chords.</p>
<p>And he says, I played this chord and it was the wrong chord.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s what you got to say, it didn&rsquo;t work right there.</p>
<p>And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up, I screwed up.</p>
<p>We were tight, everything was working and I blew it for Miles, who&rsquo;s doing his solo.</p>
<p>And he said, Miles paused for a moment and then all of a sudden he went on in a way that</p>
<p>made my chord right.</p>
<p>And I think that idea that you could be an artist who responds to what&rsquo;s thrown at you</p>
<p>in such a way as to make it right, by what measure?</p>
<p>Everyone could hear it, is all you can say, right?</p>
<p>Everyone knew, wow, that really works.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s not like, there are constraints, not anything would have worked there.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t have just played anything.</p>
<p>Most of what anyone would have played would have sounded terrible.</p>
<p>But the constraints aren&rsquo;t preexisting, they&rsquo;re what&rsquo;s happening now in the moment for these</p>
<p>listeners and these performers.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what Nietzsche thinks the right response to nihilism is, we&rsquo;re involved,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not radically free to make any choice and just stand behind it the way Sartre thinks.</p>
<p>Our choices have to be responsive to our situation and they have to make the situation work.</p>
<p>They have to make it right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about music too, so you basically have to make music of all the</p>
<p>moments of life.</p>
<p>And there is something about music, why is music so compelling?</p>
<p>And when you listen to it, something about certain kinds of music, it connects with you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>But in that same way, for Nietzsche, you should be a creative force that creates a musical</p>
<p>masterpiece.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s interesting is the question, what does it mean to be a creative force there?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a traditional notion of creation that we associate with God.</p>
<p>God creates ex nihilo, out of nothing.</p>
<p>And you might think that nihilism thinks that we should do that, create ex nihilo, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about how there&rsquo;s nothing at our ground.</p>
<p>But I think the right way to read Nietzsche is to recognize that we don&rsquo;t create out of</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
<p>Miles Davis wasn&rsquo;t nothing, that situation preexisted him, it was given to him.</p>
<p>Maybe by accident, maybe it was a mistake, whatever, but he was responding to that situation</p>
<p>in a way that made it right.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t just creating out of nothing, he was creating out of what was already there.</p>
<p>So that makes that first date with the climbing hand even more complicated because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>given a climbing hand, you&rsquo;re going to have to make art and music out of that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the responsibility for both of them.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot of responsibility for a first date because you have to create.</p>
<p>The emphasis isn&rsquo;t just on making decisions, it&rsquo;s on creating.</p>
<p>But also on listening, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Miles Davis was listening.</p>
<p>He heard that.</p>
<p>He knew it was wrong.</p>
<p>And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?</p>
<p>So let me ask about Nietzsche, is God dead?</p>
<p>What did he mean by that statement?</p>
<p>In your sense, the truth behind the question and the possible set of answers that our world</p>
<p>today provides?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s something super perceptive about Nietzsche&rsquo;s diagnosis</p>
<p>of the condition at the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p>So not so far from the condition that I think we&rsquo;re currently in.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s an interesting question what we&rsquo;re supposed to do in response.</p>
<p>But what is the condition that we&rsquo;re currently in?</p>
<p>When Nietzsche says God is dead, I think, like I was saying before, he means something</p>
<p>like the role that God used to play in grounding our existence is not a role that works for</p>
<p>us anymore as a culture.</p>
<p>And when people talk about a view like that nowadays, they use a different terminology,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at.</p>
<p>They say we live in a secular age.</p>
<p>Our age is a secular age.</p>
<p>And so what do people mean when they say that?</p>
<p>I think, first of all, it&rsquo;s a descriptive claim.</p>
<p>It could be wrong.</p>
<p>The question is, does this really describe the way we experience ourselves as a culture</p>
<p>or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?</p>
<p>So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age, an age in which God is dead?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing is it doesn&rsquo;t mean there are no religious believers because there are</p>
<p>plenty.</p>
<p>There are people who go to church or synagogue or mosque every week or more, and there are</p>
<p>people who really find that to be an important aspect of the way they live their lives.</p>
<p>But it does mean that for those people, the role that their religious belief plays in</p>
<p>their life isn&rsquo;t the same as it used to be in previous ages.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that role?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go back to the high middle ages.</p>
<p>That was clearly not a secular age.</p>
<p>That was a religious age.</p>
<p>And so there we are in 1300, Dante is writing The Divine Comedy or something.</p>
<p>And what did it mean then to live in a sacred age?</p>
<p>Well, it meant not just that the default was that you were a Christian in the West, but</p>
<p>that your Christianity, your religious belief, your religious affiliation justified certain</p>
<p>assumptions about people who didn&rsquo;t share that religious belief.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a Christian in the West in 1300, and you meet someone who&rsquo;s a Muslim, and the</p>
<p>fact that they don&rsquo;t share your religious belief justifies the conclusion that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>less than human.</p>
<p>And that was the ground of the Crusades.</p>
<p>That was the religious wars of the high middle ages.</p>
<p>To say that we live in a secular age is to say that, not that there aren&rsquo;t a lot of people</p>
<p>who have religious belief, there are, but it&rsquo;s to say that their religious belief doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>justify that conclusion.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a religious believer and you meet me and suppose I&rsquo;m not a religious believer,</p>
<p>concerning that about me doesn&rsquo;t justify your concluding that I&rsquo;m less than human.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of liberalism of the modern age.</p>
<p>Most of the time we think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>We let a thousand flowers bloom.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to live a good life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some way in which that is a nice progressive kind of liberal thought.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also true that it&rsquo;s an undermining thought because it means if you&rsquo;re a religious</p>
<p>believer now, your belief can&rsquo;t ground your understanding of what you ought to be aiming</p>
<p>at in the life in the way it used to be able to.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say, as a religious believer, I know it&rsquo;s right to do this.</p>
<p>Because you also know that if you meet someone who doesn&rsquo;t share that religious belief and</p>
<p>so doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to do that necessarily or does, but for different reasons, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>conclude that they&rsquo;ve got it wrong.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this sort of unsettling aspect to it.</p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t it true that you can&rsquo;t conclude as a public statement to others, but within</p>
<p>your own mind, it&rsquo;s almost like an existentialist version of belief, which is like you create</p>
<p>the world and around you, like it doesn&rsquo;t matter what others believe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually almost like empowering thought.</p>
<p>So as opposed to the more traditional view of religion, where it&rsquo;s like a tribal idea,</p>
<p>like where you share that idea together.</p>
<p>Here you have the full, back to Sartre, full responsibility of your beliefs as well.</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re describing is not a religious believer, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re describing someone who&rsquo;s found in themselves the ground of their existence rather than</p>
<p>in something outside of themselves.</p>
<p>So the religious belief, I mean, if you go full Sartrean, then, well, you&rsquo;re not in a</p>
<p>position to criticize others for the choices that they make, but you are in a position</p>
<p>to criticize them for the way in which they make them, either taking responsibility or</p>
<p>not taking responsibility.</p>
<p>But the religious believer used to be able to say, look, the choices that I make are</p>
<p>right because God demands that I make them.</p>
<p>And nowadays, and so it would be wrong to make any others.</p>
<p>And nowadays, to say that we live in a secular age, say, well, you can&rsquo;t quite do that and</p>
<p>be a religious believer.</p>
<p>Your religious belief can&rsquo;t justify that move, and so it can&rsquo;t ground your life in the way</p>
<p>it does.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of unsettling.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the interpretations of what Nietzsche might have meant when he</p>
<p>said God is dead.</p>
<p>God can&rsquo;t play the role for religious believers in our world that he used to.</p>
<p>But we nevertheless find meaning.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t see nihilism as a prevalent set of ideas that are overtaken in modern</p>
<p>culture.</p>
<p>So a secular world is still full of meaning.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s the interesting question.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s certainly possible for a secular world to be a world in which we live meaningful</p>
<p>lives, worthwhile lives, lives that are worthy of respect and that we can be proud of aiming</p>
<p>to live.</p>
<p>But I think it is a hard question what we&rsquo;re doing when we do that.</p>
<p>And that is the question of existence.</p>
<p>What does it mean to exist in a way that brings us out at our best as the beings that we are?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question for existentialism.</p>
<p>So besides Sartre, who to you is the most important existentialist to understand for</p>
<p>others?</p>
<p>What ideas in particular of theirs do you like?</p>
<p>Maybe other existentialists, not just one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Sartre is the grounding, strong atheistic existentialism statement.</p>
<p>Who else is there?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m teaching an existentialism course now, and I think the tradition goes back at least</p>
<p>to the 17th century.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just tell you some of the figures that I&rsquo;m teaching there.</p>
<p>We can talk about any of them that you like.</p>
<p>The figure I start with is Pascal.</p>
<p>Pascal, French mathematician from 17th century.</p>
<p>He died, I&rsquo;m terrible with dates, but I think 1661 or something like that, middle of the</p>
<p>17th century.</p>
<p>Brilliant polymath, we have computer languages named after him.</p>
<p>He built the first mechanical calculating machine.</p>
<p>But he was also deeply invested in his understanding of what Christianity was.</p>
<p>And he thought that everyone before him had really misunderstood what Christianity was,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d really attempted to think about it, not as a way of living a life, but as</p>
<p>a set of beliefs that you can have and which you can justify.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the first move that&rsquo;s really pretty interesting.</p>
<p>And then figures like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky developed that move.</p>
<p>All of those take themselves to be defending an interpretation of a certain kind of Christianity,</p>
<p>an existential interpretation of Christianity.</p>
<p>And then I think there are other figures, other theistic figures, figures like Camus</p>
<p>and Fanon, who are mid 20th century figures.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll just mention the figure who I think is the most interesting is Martin</p>
<p>Heidegger.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a complicated figure because&hellip;</p>
<p>By the way, when you said, sorry to interrupt, that when you said Camus, you meant atheistic?</p>
<p>I think that Camus is an atheistic existentialist, yeah, I&rsquo;m happy to talk about that.</p>
<p>So okay, so we got, it&rsquo;s like sports cards, we have the different existentialists.</p>
<p>So maybe let&rsquo;s go to&hellip;</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>So my favorite novel of his is The Idiot.</p>
<p>First of all, I see myself as the idiot and an idiot.</p>
<p>And I love the optimism and the love the main character has for the world.</p>
<p>So that just deeply connects with me as a novel.</p>
<p>It comes from underground as well, but what ideas of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s do you think are existentialists?</p>
<p>What ideas are formative to the whole existentialist movement?</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>So let me talk about The Brothers Karamazov.</p>
<p>Partly because that&rsquo;s the last novel that Dostoevsky wrote.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s certainly one of the greatest novels of the 19th century, maybe the best.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m about to teach it in a few weeks.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m super excited about it.</p>
<p>What is The Brothers Karamazov about?</p>
<p>I mean, without spoiling the ending for anyone.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, it&rsquo;s a murder mystery, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the father gets murdered.</p>
<p>And the question is, who did it?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s responsible for it?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a notion of responsibility here, like in Sartre.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s responsibility for a murder, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of brothers, each of whom has pretty good motivation for having murdered</p>
<p>the father.</p>
<p>The father&rsquo;s a jerk.</p>
<p>I mean, if anybody is worthy of being murdered, he&rsquo;s the guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a force of chaos and he&rsquo;s nasty in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>But still, it&rsquo;s not good to murder people.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the view of Dostoevsky?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s this intense exploration of what it means to be involved in various ways with</p>
<p>an activity that everyone can recognize as atrocious.</p>
<p>And what the right way is to take responsibility for that?</p>
<p>What the right way is to relate to others in the face of it?</p>
<p>And how, even through this kind of action, you can achieve some kind of salvation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Dostoevsky&rsquo;s word for it.</p>
<p>But salvation here and now, not like you live some afterlife where you&rsquo;re paradise for eternity.</p>
<p>Who cares about that, says one of the characters.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make my life now any good and it doesn&rsquo;t justify any of the bad things that</p>
<p>happen in my life now.</p>
<p>What matters is can we live well in the face of these things that we do and have to take</p>
<p>responsibility for?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this intense exploration of notions and gradations of guilt and responsibility</p>
<p>and the possibility of love and salvation in the face of those.</p>
<p>It is incredibly human work.</p>
<p>But I think Dostoevsky is the opposite of Sartre.</p>
<p>And let me just&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anybody else who notices this.</p>
<p>But Sartre actually quotes a passage from Dostoevsky when he&rsquo;s developing his view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s close to a passage.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear quite in this way.</p>
<p>But the passage that Sartre quotes is this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the form of an argument.</p>
<p>Sartre puts it in the form of argument.</p>
<p>He says, look, there&rsquo;s a conditional statement is true.</p>
<p>If there is no God, then everything is permitted.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a second premise.</p>
<p>There is no God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Sartre&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s an atheist.</p>
<p>There is no God.</p>
<p>Conclusion, everything is permitted.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Sartre&rsquo;s radical freedom.</p>
<p>And if you think about the structure of the Brothers Karamazov, I think Dostoevsky, though</p>
<p>he never says it this way, would run the argument differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a modus tollens instead of a modus ponens.</p>
<p>The argument for Dostoevsky would go like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, conditional statement, if there is no God, then everything is permitted.</p>
<p>But look at your life.</p>
<p>Not everything is permitted.</p>
<p>You do horrible, atrocious things like be involved in the death of your father.</p>
<p>And there is a price to pay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a livable moment to have to take responsibility, to have to recognize that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at fault or you&rsquo;re somehow guilty for having been involved in whatever way you were</p>
<p>in letting that happen or bringing it about that it does happen, is to pay a price.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not beings that are constituted in such a way that everything is permitted.</p>
<p>Look at the facts of your existence.</p>
<p>So not everything is permitted.</p>
<p>Therefore there is a God.</p>
<p>And the presence of a God for Dostoevsky, I think, is just found in this fact that when</p>
<p>we do bad things, we feel guilty for them, that we find ourselves to be responsible for</p>
<p>things even when we didn&rsquo;t intend to do them, but we just allowed ourselves to be involved</p>
<p>in them.</p>
<p>And the nature of God for Dostoevsky is, I mean, unclear.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very complex exploration in itself.</p>
<p>And he basically, God speaks through several of his characters in complicated ways.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like a trivial version of God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally not trivial.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a being that exists outside of time.</p>
<p>None of that is sort of relevant for Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>For him, it&rsquo;s a question about how we live our lives.</p>
<p>Do we live our lives in the mood that Christianity says it makes available to us, which is the</p>
<p>mood of joy?</p>
<p>Is there, maybe this is a bit of a tangent, but so I&rsquo;m a Russian speaker and one of the,</p>
<p>I kind of listen to my heart and what my heart says is I need to take on this project.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a couple of famous translators of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy that live in Paris</p>
<p>currently.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to take the journey.</p>
<p>We agreed to have a full conversation about Dostoevsky, about Tolstoy and like a series</p>
<p>of conversations.</p>
<p>And the reason I fell in love with this idea is I just realized in translating from Russian</p>
<p>to English how deep philosophical, how much deep philosophical thinking is required.</p>
<p>Just like single sentences.</p>
<p>They spent like weeks debating single sentences.</p>
<p>So and all of that is part of a journey to Russia for several reasons.</p>
<p>But I just, I want to explore something in me that longs to understand and to connect</p>
<p>with the roots where I come from.</p>
<p>So maybe can you comment, whether it&rsquo;s on the Russian side or the German side or other</p>
<p>French side, is there something in your own explorations of these philosophies that you</p>
<p>find that you miss because you don&rsquo;t deeply know the language?</p>
<p>Or like how important is it to understand the language?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s super important and I&rsquo;m always embarrassed that I don&rsquo;t know more languages</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t know the languages I know as well as I would like to.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a way in.</p>
<p>So I do think different languages allow you to think in different ways and that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a sort of a mode of existence, a way of being that&rsquo;s captured by a language that it makes</p>
<p>certain ways of thinking about yourself or others more natural and it closes off other</p>
<p>ways of thinking about yourself and others.</p>
<p>And so I think languages are fascinating in that way.</p>
<p>The Heidegger who is this philosopher that I&rsquo;m interested in says at one point, language</p>
<p>is the house of being.</p>
<p>And I think that means something like it&rsquo;s by living in a language that you come to understand</p>
<p>or that possibilities for understanding what it is to be you and others and anything are</p>
<p>opened up.</p>
<p>And different languages open up different possibilities.</p>
<p>And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce, how I took a course in James Joyce</p>
<p>and how I don&rsquo;t think I understood anything besides the dead and the short stories.</p>
<p>And you suggested that it might be helpful to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin to</p>
<p>truly to help you understand, maybe fall in love with the words.</p>
<p>And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding of the actual words of the</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understanding something much deeper, the music of the language or something, music</p>
<p>of the ideas.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to say exactly what that is.</p>
<p>But when you hear an Irish person who really understands Joyce read some sentences, they</p>
<p>have a different cadence, they have a different tonality, they have different music to use</p>
<p>your word.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you think about them differently and the sentences sort of draw different thoughts</p>
<p>out of you when they&rsquo;re read in certain ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what great actors can do.</p>
<p>But I think language is rich like that.</p>
<p>And the idea which philosophers tend to have that we&rsquo;re really studying the crucial aspects</p>
<p>of language when we think about its logical form, when we think about the sort of claims</p>
<p>of philosophical logic that you can make or how do you translate this proposition into</p>
<p>some symbolic form, I think that&rsquo;s part of what goes on in language.</p>
<p>But I think that when language affects us in the deep way that it can when great poets</p>
<p>or great writers or great thinkers use it to great effect, it&rsquo;s way more than that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the interesting form of language that I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a challenge I&rsquo;m hoping to take on is I feel like some of the ideas that are</p>
<p>conveyed through language are actually can be put outside of language.</p>
<p>So one of the challenges I have to do is to have a conversation with people in Russian,</p>
<p>but for an English audience and not rely purely on translators.</p>
<p>There would of course be translators there that help me dance through this mess of language,</p>
<p>but also like my goal, my hope is to dance from Russian to English back and forth for</p>
<p>an English speaking audience and for a Russian speaking audience.</p>
<p>So not this pure, this is Russian, it&rsquo;s going to be translated to English or this is English,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be translated to Russian, but dance back and forth and try to share with</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t speak one of the languages, the music that they&rsquo;re missing and sort of</p>
<p>almost hear that music as if you&rsquo;re sitting in another room and you hear the music through</p>
<p>the wall.</p>
<p>I get a sense of it.</p>
<p>I think that would be a waste if I don&rsquo;t try to pursue this being a bilingual human being.</p>
<p>And I wonder whether it&rsquo;s possible to capture some of the magic of the ideas in a way that</p>
<p>can be conveyed to people who don&rsquo;t speak that particular language.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a super exciting project.</p>
<p>I look forward to following it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing that does happen.</p>
<p>So we read Dostoevsky in translation.</p>
<p>Occasionally I do have Russian speakers in the room, which is super helpful, but I also</p>
<p>encourage my students to, some of them will have different translations than others.</p>
<p>And that can be really helpful for the non native speaker because by paying attention</p>
<p>to the places where translators diverge in their translations of a given word or a phrase</p>
<p>or something like that, you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have</p>
<p>in English, they don&rsquo;t have the same contours as the word in Russian that&rsquo;s being translated.</p>
<p>And then you can start to ask about what those differences are.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a kind of magic to it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s astonishing how rich and affecting these languages can be for people who grew</p>
<p>up in them, especially who speak them as native speakers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really powerful thing that actually doesn&rsquo;t exist enough of is, for example, for</p>
<p>Dostoevsky, most novels have been translated by two or three famous translators.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion about who did it better and so on.</p>
<p>But I would love to, I&rsquo;m a computer science person, I would love to do a diff where you</p>
<p>automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you&rsquo;re saying and</p>
<p>use that, like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll probably do a little bit of this.</p>
<p>I heard the individual translators in interviews and in blog posts and articles discuss particular</p>
<p>phrases that they differ on, but like to do that for an entire book, that&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>exploration as an English speaker, just to read the differences in the translations.</p>
<p>You probably can get some deep understanding of ideas in those books by seeing the struggle</p>
<p>of the translators to capture that idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting idea.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And you can do that for other projects and other languages too.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the, I don&rsquo;t know, I have this weird, huge range of interests and some days</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll find myself reading about something.</p>
<p>At one point I was interested in 14th century German mysticism.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Turns out there&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s written like volumes and volumes about this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>And I was interested in reading Meister Eckhart.</p>
<p>I wanted to know what was interesting about him.</p>
<p>And the sort of move that this guy Bernard McGinn, who&rsquo;s the great scholar of this period</p>
<p>made, was to say what Eckhart did, and everybody knows this, he translated Christianity into</p>
<p>the vernacular.</p>
<p>He started giving sermons in German to the peasants, sermons used to be in Latin and</p>
<p>nobody could speak Latin.</p>
<p>Can you imagine sitting there for a two hour sermon in a language that you don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>So he translated it into German, but in doing it, the resources of the German language are</p>
<p>different from the resources of the Latin language.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a word in middle high German, Grund, which we translated as ground.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got this earthy feel to it.</p>
<p>It sort of invokes the notion of soil and what you stand on and what things grow out</p>
<p>of and sort of what you could run your fingers through that would have a kind of honesty</p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no Latin word for that.</p>
<p>But in Eckhart&rsquo;s interpretation of Christianity, Grund, that&rsquo;s like the fundamental thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand God until you understand the way in which he is our ground.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, this mysticism gets a kind of German cant that makes sense to the</p>
<p>people who speak German and that reveals something totally different about what you could think</p>
<p>that form of existence was that was covered over by the fact that it had always been done</p>
<p>in Latin.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So we talked about Dostoevsky and the use of murder to explore human nature.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder, more concerned with suicide as</p>
<p>a way to explore human nature.</p>
<p>So he is probably my favorite existentialist, probably one of the more accessible existentialists.</p>
<p>And like you said, one of the people who didn&rsquo;t like to call himself an existentialist.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts about Camus?</p>
<p>What role does he play in the story of existentialism?</p>
<p>So I find Camus totally fascinating.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>And for years, I didn&rsquo;t teach Camus because the famous thing that you&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>The Myth of Sisyphus, which is a sort of essay, it&rsquo;s published as a book, super accessible,</p>
<p>really fascinating.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great writer, really engaging.</p>
<p>The opening line is something like, there is but one truly significant philosophical</p>
<p>question, and that is the question of suicide.</p>
<p>And I thought, I can&rsquo;t teach my 18 year olds.</p>
<p>I just thought that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>How can I&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not wrong, but do I want to bring that into the classroom?</p>
<p>And so I read it, I read the essay, I avoided it for a long time just because of that line.</p>
<p>And I thought, I&rsquo;m not going to be able to make sense of this in a way that will be helpful</p>
<p>for anyone.</p>
<p>But finally, one year, maybe seven or eight years ago, I sat down to read it.</p>
<p>I thought, I&rsquo;ve got to really confront it.</p>
<p>And I read it and it&rsquo;s incredibly engaging.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really, really beautiful.</p>
<p>And Camus was against suicide, which just turns out to be good.</p>
<p>I was happy about that, but he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence</p>
<p>amounts to.</p>
<p>And so in the end, he thinks that human existence is absurd.</p>
<p>And absurd is a kind of technical term for him.</p>
<p>And it means that the episodes in your life and your life as a whole presents itself to</p>
<p>you as if it&rsquo;s got a meaning, but really it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this tension between the way things seem to be on their surface and what really</p>
<p>turns out to be true about them.</p>
<p>And he gives these great examples.</p>
<p>You probably remember these.</p>
<p>He says, there you are, you&rsquo;re walking along the street and there&rsquo;s a plate glass window</p>
<p>in a building and through the window you see somebody talking on a telephone.</p>
<p>I mean, I imagined it as a cell phone, but Camus didn&rsquo;t, but you see somebody talking</p>
<p>on a cell phone and he&rsquo;s animated.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking a lot as if things really meant something.</p>
<p>And yet Camus says, it&rsquo;s a dumb show.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not dumb just in the sense that it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dumb in the sense that it&rsquo;s silent.</p>
<p>It presents itself as if it&rsquo;s got some significance and yet its significance is withheld from</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>And he says, that&rsquo;s what our lives are like.</p>
<p>Everything in our lives presents themselves to us as if it&rsquo;s got a significance, but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>And then he says, really what our lives are like, they&rsquo;re like the lives of Sisyphus.</p>
<p>Just day after day, you do the same thing.</p>
<p>You wake up at a certain time, you get on the bus, you go to work, you take your lunch</p>
<p>break, you get off.</p>
<p>I have a colleague who once said to me something like this, it was about October or so in the</p>
<p>fall semester.</p>
<p>I said, how&rsquo;s it going, Dick?</p>
<p>He said, well, you know how it is.</p>
<p>I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester and I&rsquo;m just going through</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the way my life is.</p>
<p>And Camus thinks that experience, which you can sometimes have, reveals something true</p>
<p>about what human lives are like.</p>
<p>Our lives really just are like the life of Sisyphus who rolls this boulder up the hill</p>
<p>from morning till night.</p>
<p>And then at night he gets to the top and it rolls back down to the bottom.</p>
<p>Over the course of the night, he walks back down and then he starts it all over again.</p>
<p>And he says, Sisyphus is condemned to this life like we&rsquo;re condemned to our lives.</p>
<p>But we do have one bit of freedom and it&rsquo;s the only thing that we can hang on to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the freedom to stick it to the gods who put us in this position by embracing this</p>
<p>existence rather than giving up and committing suicide.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, it&rsquo;s kind of a happy ending.</p>
<p>But I also thought it&rsquo;s a dim view of what our existence amounts to.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s something fascinating about that.</p>
<p>But what I came to believe, and I tried to write about this once, I know you read the</p>
<p>thing about aliveness that I published once, that&rsquo;s secretly a criticism of Camus.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I mentioned Camus in there.</p>
<p>But I think Camus has got the phenomenon wrong or he&rsquo;s missed some important aspect of it.</p>
<p>Because in Camus view, when you experience your day as sort of going on in this deadening</p>
<p>way and you&rsquo;re just doing the things that you always do the way you always do them,</p>
<p>for Camus, that reveals the truth about what our lives are.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s some aspect, at least for me, and maybe he just didn&rsquo;t feel this</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t have access to it, maybe others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But for me, there&rsquo;s an extra part to it, which is somehow that, yes, that&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>things are and it&rsquo;s inadequate.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s missing from that aspect of our existence that could be</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>And it feels like our lives are not about just putting up with that and sticking it</p>
<p>to the gods by embracing it, but seeking that absence part of it, the part that&rsquo;s recognizable</p>
<p>in its absence in your experience of that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think.</p>
<p>I think we do have the experience of the presence of that in moments when you feel truly alive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you mean by the word aliveness, which is a fascinating and a powerful word.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I mean by it.</p>
<p>I think most people can recognize moments in their lives when they really felt alive.</p>
<p>And it could happen in a moment when, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment</p>
<p>when he was responding to Herbie Hancock&rsquo;s chord, or maybe you feel it in that moment</p>
<p>where you grab for the hand on the first date and the gesture is reciprocated, or maybe</p>
<p>you feel it in some moment when you are doing a kind of peak athletic thing or watching</p>
<p>somebody else do a peak athletic thing.</p>
<p>But I think there are moments when it feels like it&rsquo;s not like the way Camus is describing</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s better because of that.</p>
<p>So I think one really powerful way for me to understand aliveness is to think about</p>
<p>going to a darker territory, is to think about suicide.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve known people in my life who suffer from clinical depression.</p>
<p>And whatever the chemistry is in our brain, there is a certain kind of feeling that is</p>
<p>to be depressed, where you look in the mirror and ask, do I want to kill myself today?</p>
<p>This is the question that Camus asks, this question, this philosophical question.</p>
<p>And there is people who, when they&rsquo;re depressed, say, not only do they say, I want to kill</p>
<p>myself or I don&rsquo;t, they say, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s chemistry, that&rsquo;s whatever that is, that&rsquo;s chemistry in our mind.</p>
<p>And then on the flip side of that, for me, I&rsquo;ve had some low points, but I&rsquo;ve been very</p>
<p>fortunate to not suffer from that kind of depression.</p>
<p>I am the opposite, which is not only moments of peak performance in athletics or great</p>
<p>music or any of that, I&rsquo;m just deeply joyful often by mundane things.</p>
<p>As you were saying it, I was drinking this thing and it&rsquo;s cold, and for some reason the</p>
<p>coldness of that was like, oh, great, like refrigeration.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There was a joy in that, like, I can&rsquo;t put it into words, but it just felt great.</p>
<p>And then just so many things, you look out in nature, there&rsquo;s a nice breeze and just</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m embracing the absurd.</p>
<p>That seems like I&rsquo;m getting some nice like dopamine hits in whatever the chemistry is</p>
<p>from just the basics of life, and that is the source of aliveness.</p>
<p>However my brain is built, it&rsquo;s gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness.</p>
<p>And so one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the</p>
<p>clinical depression.</p>
<p>And so that Camus doesn&rsquo;t seem to contend with that at all in asking the question of</p>
<p>suicide because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want</p>
<p>to kill myself today, I ask that question in a different way, more like a stoic way</p>
<p>often, like basically every day is, you know, what if I die today?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like contemplating your mortality every single day.</p>
<p>You know, that excites me, the possibility that this is my last day, that, you know,</p>
<p>it just reminds me how amazing life is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s chemistry, I don&rsquo;t know what that is, but that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s certainly not some</p>
<p>kind of philosophical decision I made.</p>
<p>I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry of the genetics I&rsquo;ve been given, of the dopamine.</p>
<p>So that question of suicide, by the way, do you find that formulation of the question</p>
<p>of existentialism, I know you didn&rsquo;t want to teach it because obviously suicide is a</p>
<p>very difficult word, especially for young minds, but do you think that&rsquo;s a useful formulation</p>
<p>of the question of existentialism?</p>
<p>Like him saying, this is the most important question of suicide.</p>
<p>I think there is something to it, if you read the question as the question, what is it in</p>
<p>virtue of which it ought to be desirable to live the lives that we&rsquo;re capable of living?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a deep question.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a question that gets focused when someone asks themselves whether they</p>
<p>ought to continue to live that life.</p>
<p>The famous line, nothing focuses the mind more than one&rsquo;s impending execution.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something important about that, that recognizing the riskiness and the</p>
<p>vulnerability of one&rsquo;s existence is super important.</p>
<p>And I think that if we didn&rsquo;t have that, our lives wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of being meaningful.</p>
<p>If they weren&rsquo;t risky and vulnerable, there would be nothing to lose.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only because there are things to lose that they can come to have the significance</p>
<p>that they do.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think I&rsquo;m not against the idea that that&rsquo;s a deep way of approaching the</p>
<p>questions at the core of existentialism.</p>
<p>But as you said, I was worried for a while about how I was going to teach it.</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s a difference between suicide and not living because suicide is</p>
<p>an action.</p>
<p>So it feels like to me, like suicide doesn&rsquo;t make sense because, you know, imagine you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in like a hotel and you&rsquo;re saying the room I&rsquo;m in sucks, but like there&rsquo;s other rooms.</p>
<p>So like maybe explore those other rooms.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll find meaning in those other rooms, like basically embracing the fact that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know everything and there&rsquo;s a, you need time to explore everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like once you&rsquo;ve explored everything, then maybe you can make a full decision.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s unfair to make a decision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I would say unethical to make a decision until you&rsquo;ve explored all the rooms in the</p>
<p>hotel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this gets focused in the brothers Karamazov, of course.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one brother who is really asking that question, is asking the question of suicide.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asking the question whether the world that we live in is a world that&rsquo;s worth living</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>And I think that character is, as you say, very ill.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible and often because, as you say, of, you know, brain chemistry, physiology,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly a physical ground to that situation, to that condition.</p>
<p>But I think it is possible for someone to be in that situation.</p>
<p>I think that Ivan Karamazov, who&rsquo;s the character who&rsquo;s asking this question, is, you know,</p>
<p>maybe let&rsquo;s say chemically depressed or something like that.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s more to it too.</p>
<p>And I think that Dostoevsky&rsquo;s real view is that the brain chemistry doesn&rsquo;t exist on</p>
<p>its own.</p>
<p>Like the way we interact with one another, the way we care about or isolate ourselves</p>
<p>from others, the way we care for the lives that we lead, affects the chemistry of our</p>
<p>brain, which goes on and changes the mood that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So I think Dostoevsky does think that Ivan&rsquo;s salvation, if he&rsquo;s capable of being saved,</p>
<p>is gonna come through the love of his brother Alyosha.</p>
<p>Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you.</p>
<p>Do you ever, one of my other favorite authors is Herman Hesse.</p>
<p>Do you ever include him in our deck of sport cards that represent existentialism?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe I should.</p>
<p>What should I read?</p>
<p>What should I think about including?</p>
<p>Oh no, there&rsquo;s some kind of embrace of absurdism.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a existentialist kind of ideal pervading most of his work.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more of a, like with Siddhartha, there&rsquo;s more almost like a Buddhist sort of</p>
<p>like watch the river and like become the river.</p>
<p>Like this kind of idea that what it means to truly experience the moment.</p>
<p>So there is an experiential part of existentialism where you want to, it&rsquo;s not just about, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been talking about kind of decisions and actions, but also what it means to listen, like you</p>
<p>said from Nietzsche, like what it means to really take in the world and experience the</p>
<p>moment.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s very good at writing about what it means to experience the moment and experience</p>
<p>the full absurdity of the moment.</p>
<p>And for him, I&rsquo;m starting to forget, Steppenwolf, I think, is humor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the absurdity, which I think modern day internet explores very well with</p>
<p>memes and so on.</p>
<p>Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic that&rsquo;s able to deal with absurdity.</p>
<p>You got to like laugh at it.</p>
<p>I think there is some, let me just say something about humor because I think you&rsquo;re absolutely</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>Richard Bard, who is Danish and most people think deeply depressed and so on, is actually</p>
<p>an incredibly funny writer.</p>
<p>And someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school who left philosophy to become</p>
<p>a Hollywood comedy writer, he&rsquo;s a very successful guy.</p>
<p>And then he came back 25 years later and finished his dissertation.</p>
<p>And I was the reader on the dissertation, there may be a conflict of interest, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>quite sure.</p>
<p>But his dissertation was about, he called it Kierkegaard and the Funny, which is a kind</p>
<p>of a funny title, yeah.</p>
<p>But Kierkegaard, according to Eric Kaplan&rsquo;s reading, Kierkegaard does have this idea that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something destabilizing about humor that&rsquo;s crucial to the important possibilities</p>
<p>for us.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s the idea that there&rsquo;s a moment when a joke is being set up, when you&rsquo;re sort</p>
<p>of proceeding as if you&rsquo;re on stable ground, and then the punchline comes and the rug is</p>
<p>pulled out from under you.</p>
<p>And for a moment, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re falling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing supporting you until you&rsquo;re captured by your totally new understanding</p>
<p>of what was going on, and that humor necessarily has that kind of destabilizing feature to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the riskiness, that&rsquo;s like the riskiness that you were pointing to.</p>
<p>If there aren&rsquo;t risks in your life, if your life is totally safe, then there&rsquo;s no possibility</p>
<p>of significance.</p>
<p>And so I think on Eric&rsquo;s reading, Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up the importance of</p>
<p>the riskiness and vulnerability in your life to its having meaning with the experience</p>
<p>of destabilization that you get in jokes and comedy, which then becomes significant, right?</p>
<p>When you remember having heard a joke for the first time, it&rsquo;s got a kind of salience</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>Speaking of jokes, and speaking of, you mentioned film and literature, so existentialism in</p>
<p>film and literature.</p>
<p>I think for a lot of people, especially nihilism, was experienced in the great modern work of</p>
<p>art called Big Lebowski.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever seen that film, but there&rsquo;s a group of nihilists in that film.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like, they don&rsquo;t care about anything.</p>
<p>I think they happen to be German, at least they have German accents.</p>
<p>So maybe can you talk about notable appearances of existentialism in film, and if you at all</p>
<p>ever bring up Big Lebowski, if that ever comes into play?</p>
<p>So I know that people think about the Big Lebowski in this context, and I did actually</p>
<p>rewatch it not so long ago.</p>
<p>We have kids, and I thought, maybe it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really time for the 11 year old, so somewhat inappropriate.</p>
<p>I have never taught that film, so I&rsquo;d have to think more.</p>
<p>We could talk about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to try to think on the fly about it.</p>
<p>Okay, so I would love to, because there is a, feels like there&rsquo;s a philosophical depth</p>
<p>to that film.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a person that just, the main character.</p>
<p>The Jeff Bridges character.</p>
<p>Jeff Bridges character, yeah.</p>
<p>He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians, and he just kind of walks around in a very</p>
<p>relaxed way, and irradiates both a love for life, but also just an acceptance of like,</p>
<p>it is what it is kind of philosophy.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a bunch of characters that have very busy lives trying to do some big</p>
<p>projects that are dramatic in some way, make some huge amounts of money.</p>
<p>So it kind of actually reminds me of The Idiot by Dostoevsky in a certain kind of sense.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s these players, I mean, they&rsquo;re phrased as nihilists, but they kind of don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care to enjoy life.</p>
<p>They want to mess with life in some kind of way.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s interesting personalities that, what is it, Jesus, the bowler.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like Donnie, who is a bit clueless, and then there&rsquo;s the John Goodman</p>
<p>character that&rsquo;s talking about Vietnam and just takes life way too seriously, too intensely</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters that are operating in this world.</p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly for existentialism are thrown into absurdity and hence the humor.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, good.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Reminding me of all that.</p>
<p>And I think&hellip;</p>
<p>So one thing to say is that the nihilists, the group of nihilists who call themselves</p>
<p>nihilists, I think they&rsquo;ve got a bad misinterpretation of what nihilism is supposed to be.</p>
<p>And this happened actually in the 20s.</p>
<p>There was a famous case of a couple of German students, Leopold and Loeb, who&rsquo;d read a lot</p>
<p>of Nietzsche, Nietzsche was a kind of hero for the Nazis even, I think based on a pretty</p>
<p>bad misunderstanding of what he was up to.</p>
<p>But Leopold and Loeb had the bad understanding first and they were students, they&rsquo;d read</p>
<p>a lot of Nietzsche and they thought, okay, nothing means anything.</p>
<p>The only way that there&rsquo;s any significance in life is through our will to sort of powerfully</p>
<p>bring something about.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re gonna do that in a way that reflects the fact that nothing means anything, then</p>
<p>what we should do is take these things, these actions that people always thought were bad</p>
<p>and do them and show that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with doing them.</p>
<p>And so they decided they would murder someone.</p>
<p>Not because they were angry at them, just someone they&rsquo;d never met.</p>
<p>It was important that it was someone they&rsquo;d never met.</p>
<p>It was totally unmotivated act.</p>
<p>And they thought, we&rsquo;ll embrace nihilism by showing that we can act in such a way as to</p>
<p>do something that morality thinks is bad and through our will bring it about that we desire</p>
<p>to do it for no reason that has anything to do with its potentially being interpretable</p>
<p>as good.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a terrible misreading of what Nietzsche thinks the response to nihilism</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, read that against the Miles Davis thing.</p>
<p>Miles Davis aim is to creatively bring it about that something works well in a situation</p>
<p>where he is kind of constrained.</p>
<p>So they thought two things, one, there are no constraints at all, not even the constraints</p>
<p>of the situation that we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>And two, we only become the beings that we really are when we act against what you might</p>
<p>have thought the constraints were.</p>
<p>And I just think that&rsquo;s a bad misreading of what that kind of nihilism is up to.</p>
<p>And I think maybe that group in the Big Lebowski has got that kind of bad misreading.</p>
<p>But then the major characters are much more interesting.</p>
<p>Go ahead and say something.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some kind of apathy to that particular nihilism.</p>
<p>Could you comment on whether you see sort of apathy as a philosophy part of that nihilism?</p>
<p>Sort of like from an existentialist perspective, how important is it to care about stuff?</p>
<p>Like really take on life?</p>
<p>What does existentialism have to say about just sitting back and just not caring?</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>So apathy is like a really important word.</p>
<p>The Greek word is apathe, it means without passions.</p>
<p>And the Stoics, who you mentioned earlier, really thought that passions are what get</p>
<p>in the way if you&rsquo;re living well.</p>
<p>Because to live well, you have to think clearly about what you should do and you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let your resentments and your angers and your petty animosities direct your behavior.</p>
<p>You should release yourself from those kinds of passions.</p>
<p>So Stoicism, again, huge caricature, but it&rsquo;s an aim not to care because caring is bad.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certain forms of existentialism, certainly in Pascal and Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky</p>
<p>and Heidegger and Sartre in his own way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just a theistic or atheistic thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s crucial about us is that we do care.</p>
<p>Heidegger says, care is the being of Dasein, Dasein is his name for us.</p>
<p>What it is to be us is to be the being that already cares.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t not do that.</p>
<p>You can pretend you&rsquo;re not doing it, but you&rsquo;re just caring in a different way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Sartre saying, you can pretend you&rsquo;re not taking responsibility.</p>
<p>You can pretend that you don&rsquo;t have to make a decision, that is making a decision.</p>
<p>Not caring is a way of caring.</p>
<p>And so I think the existentialists that I&rsquo;m interested in think that we do care.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s constitutive of what it is to be us.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ll think that the Stoics got it wrong.</p>
<p>But that leaves open a huge range of moves about how we inhabit that existence well.</p>
<p>Let me ask about Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>So it just so happens that she&rsquo;s entered a few conversations in this podcast, and just</p>
<p>looking at academic philosophy or just philosophers in general, they seem to ignore Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of why that is?</p>
<p>Did she ever come into play her ideas of objectivism, come into play of discussions of a good life</p>
<p>from the perspective of existentialism in how you teach it and how you think about it?</p>
<p>Is she somebody who you find at all interesting?</p>
<p>So no, I don&rsquo;t think she is, but it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve read her stuff.</p>
<p>I read it in high school.</p>
<p>I read The Fountainhead in high school and Atlas Shrugged, but that&rsquo;s at this point a</p>
<p>very long time ago.</p>
<p>I think I read something about objective epistemology or something too.</p>
<p>So my view about her could be based on a total misunderstanding of what she&rsquo;s up to.</p>
<p>But sort of my caricature of her and tell me if I&rsquo;ve got it wrong is that she&rsquo;s sort</p>
<p>of motivated by a kind of, I think maybe sometimes you call it libertarianism, but maybe let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the context of our discussion tie it back to Sartre, a kind of view according to which</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the being who has to contend with the fact that we&rsquo;re radically free to do stuff</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just not being courageous or brave enough when we don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And the people to admire are the people who make stuff out of nothing.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s a bad caricature.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I think, no, I think that&rsquo;s pretty accurate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not again, very knowledgeable about the full depth of her philosophy, but I think</p>
<p>she takes a view of the world that&rsquo;s similar to Sartre in the conclusions, but makes stronger</p>
<p>statements about epistemology that first of all, everything is knowable and there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>you should always operate through reason.</p>
<p>Like reason is very important.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like you start with a few axioms and you build on top of that and the axioms</p>
<p>that everybody should operate on are the same.</p>
<p>Again, reality is objective, it&rsquo;s not subjective.</p>
<p>So from that you can derive the entirety of how humans should behave at the individual</p>
<p>level and at the societal level.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few conclusions, she would talk about virtue of selfishness and sort of a</p>
<p>lot of people use that to dismiss her, look, she&rsquo;s very selfish and so on.</p>
<p>She actually meant something very different is like, it&rsquo;s more like the Sartre thing,</p>
<p>take responsibility for yourself, understand what forces you&rsquo;re operating under and make</p>
<p>the best of this life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you can be the best member of societies by making the best life you can</p>
<p>and just focusing yourself, like fix your own problems first and then that will make</p>
<p>you the best member of society, of your family, of loved ones, of friends and so on.</p>
<p>I think the reason she&rsquo;s disliked, obviously on the philosophy side, she&rsquo;s disliked because</p>
<p>a little bit like Nietzsche, she&rsquo;s literary.</p>
<p>I think the reason she&rsquo;s publicly disliked in sort of public conversations is because</p>
<p>of how sure she is of herself, which is some of the philosophers have been known to do</p>
<p>like make very strong statements like hell is other people, but she was making very strong</p>
<p>statements about basically everything.</p>
<p>But the reason I bring her up is she is an influential thinker that is not for some reason</p>
<p>often brought up as such, it&rsquo;s not acknowledged how influential she is.</p>
<p>I was recently looking at like a list of the most important women of the 20th century in</p>
<p>terms of thought, not science, but like thought and she wasn&rsquo;t in that list.</p>
<p>And I see this time and time again and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me why she&rsquo;s so kind</p>
<p>of dismissed because clearly she&rsquo;s an author of some of the most read books like ever and</p>
<p>she clearly had very strong ideas that she&rsquo;d be contented with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it kind of didn&rsquo;t make sense to me because she&rsquo;s also a creature of her time</p>
<p>and an important one, she&rsquo;s a creation of the Soviet Union, somebody who left because</p>
<p>of that and so some of the strength of her ideas has to do with how much she dislikes</p>
<p>that particular philosophy and way of life.</p>
<p>But also she&rsquo;s a creature of Sartre and that whole Nietzsche and so on.</p>
<p>Now one of the other criticisms is she doesn&rsquo;t integrate herself into this history.</p>
<p>She keeps basically kind of implying that she&rsquo;s purely original in all her thoughts</p>
<p>even though she&rsquo;s kind of citing a lot of other people.</p>
<p>But again, many philosophers do this kind of thing as if they are truly original and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>It is interesting and also what&rsquo;s interesting about her is she is a woman, she is a strong</p>
<p>feminist and it feels like with Simone de Beauvoir, it seems like she&rsquo;s a very important</p>
<p>person in this moment of history that shouldn&rsquo;t be fully forgotten.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so I mean I don&rsquo;t have a lot to add.</p>
<p>I will just say this, I mean the way she and Beauvoir seem to me from your description</p>
<p>of her and remembering what I remember from 35 years ago, they seem pretty opposite from</p>
<p>one another.</p>
<p>One of the things I find interesting about Beauvoir is that she takes seriously the thing</p>
<p>that Sartre didn&rsquo;t, which is our throwness, which is the sense in which we&rsquo;re born into</p>
<p>a situation that&rsquo;s already got a significance.</p>
<p>I think it was easier for her to recognize that than Sartre because she was a woman.</p>
<p>And Sartre seems to act as if there are no constraints or at least there shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty close as privileged white males and if we could just get rid of the last bits</p>
<p>of them, we would be God like we&rsquo;re supposed to be.</p>
<p>And I think Beauvoir sort of sees things differently.</p>
<p>I think she recognizes one&rsquo;s not born but becomes a woman, she says.</p>
<p>So how does that happen?</p>
<p>Well you&rsquo;re thrown into your culture and your culture starts treating you in a certain way</p>
<p>because of your gender and that starts to form your understanding and your experience</p>
<p>of things.</p>
<p>By the time you&rsquo;re grown up, well you&rsquo;re pretty well formed by that.</p>
<p>That seems a fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact about Sartre too though, it was harder for him to notice it because he was</p>
<p>formed into his privilege.</p>
<p>But the world reminds us of our throwness for some more than others.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And for people who have to contend on a daily basis with the fact that the social position</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thrown into is one that negates them or one that oppresses them or one that sort</p>
<p>of pushes them to the side in some way or another, I mean the black experience is interesting</p>
<p>in this respect too.</p>
<p>Frantz Fanon who&rsquo;s a contemporary of Sartre and Beauvoir writes about it and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>familiar the things that he&rsquo;s saying now but he writes back in the 50s about being a black</p>
<p>man in Paris and getting on an elevator with a woman alone and how her reaction to him,</p>
<p>not knowing him, not having any views about any reason to have any views about him sort</p>
<p>of puts him in a particular social position with respect to her.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that experience, it&rsquo;s much harder to recognize the way in which</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re thrown into is something we might not have chosen.</p>
<p>So the idea that that&rsquo;s not an aspect of our existence, which as you describe Ayn Rand&rsquo;s</p>
<p>views, she sounds more like Sartre, she sounds more like either it&rsquo;s not an aspect of our</p>
<p>existence or at least we ought to sort of aim at it&rsquo;s not being an aspect of our existence.</p>
<p>Yeah, almost act as if it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Act as if it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And so I think from my point of view, I don&rsquo;t pretend that I&rsquo;m explaining the public reception</p>
<p>of her, I&rsquo;m just sort of trying to say how I understand her in this intellectual context.</p>
<p>From my point of view, that&rsquo;s something big to miss and the ambition to think that really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is that we&rsquo;re all the same, we&rsquo;re all rational beings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all beings who if we just got the axioms of our existence right and made good judgments</p>
<p>and reasoned in an appropriate way, would optimize ourselves.</p>
<p>That feels to me like a kind of natural end point of the philosophical tradition.</p>
<p>I mean, sort of Plato starts off with a view that helps us in that direction and the enlightenment</p>
<p>moves us further in that direction.</p>
<p>But from my point of view, that movement has led us astray because it&rsquo;s missed something</p>
<p>really important that&rsquo;s crucial to the kind of being that we are.</p>
<p>Yeah, it misses the music.</p>
<p>Exactly, it misses the music.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about thrownness and I think you mentioned that in the context of Heidegger.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So can we talk about Heidegger?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who is this philosopher?</p>
<p>What are some fascinating ideas that he brought to the world?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher.</p>
<p>I do know when he was born, 1889, but I know that only by accident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the same year that Wittgenstein, an Austrian philosopher, was born and the</p>
<p>same year that Hitler was born.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;ve remembered my dates right and someone will call in and correct me otherwise.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the way it sort of sits in my memory bank.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that the three of them were born at the same time.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein and Heidegger share some similarities, but then it&rsquo;s also interesting that Heidegger</p>
<p>was a Nazi.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a very disturbing fact about his personal political background.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s something that anyone who thinks that things that he said might be interesting</p>
<p>has got to contend with.</p>
<p>Heidegger was born in Germany, Hitler in Austria.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein is Austria also.</p>
<p>But so you have to, when you call Heidegger a Nazi, you have to remember, I mean, there</p>
<p>was millions of Nazis too.</p>
<p>So like there are parts of their, that&rsquo;s the history of the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of communists, Marxists and Nazis in that part of history.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And one of the discussion points is, well, was he just a kind of social Nazi?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, he went to parties with them and stuff, or was he like, did he really</p>
<p>believe in the ideology?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a choice point.</p>
<p>And we could talk about it if you want.</p>
<p>He held a political position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the relevant parts.</p>
<p>In 1933, he was made rector of the University of Freiburg.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the president of the university.</p>
<p>And that was in Germany, all the universities are state universities.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a political appointment.</p>
<p>Can we just pause on this point?</p>
<p>From an existentialist perspective, what&rsquo;s the role for standing up to evil?</p>
<p>So I mean, I think Camus probably had something to say about these things because he was a</p>
<p>bit of a political figure.</p>
<p>Like do you have a responsibility, not just for your decisions, but you know, if the world</p>
<p>you see around you is going against what you believe somewhere deep inside is ethical,</p>
<p>do you have a responsibility to stand up to that, even if it costs you your life or your</p>
<p>wellbeing?</p>
<p>Well, you ask from an existential perspective and there&rsquo;s lots of different positions that</p>
<p>you could have.</p>
<p>So let me tell you something in the area of what I think I might believe, which comes</p>
<p>out of this tradition.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this, if you live in a community where people are being dragged down by the</p>
<p>norms of the community rather than elevated, then there&rsquo;s two things that you have to recognize.</p>
<p>One is that you bear some responsibility for that.</p>
<p>Not necessarily because you chose it, maybe you reviled it, maybe you were against it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some way in which we all act in accordance with the norms of our culture.</p>
<p>We all give in to them in some way or another.</p>
<p>And if those norms are broken, then there&rsquo;s some way in which we&rsquo;ve allowed ourselves</p>
<p>to be responsible for broken norms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve become responsible for broken norms.</p>
<p>And I do think you have to face up to that.</p>
<p>I think that, let&rsquo;s just take gender norms.</p>
<p>Maybe the gender norms are broken.</p>
<p>Maybe the way men and women treat one another or the way men treat women is broken.</p>
<p>Maybe it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making a substantive claim, I&rsquo;m just saying lots of people say it is.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re in a culture where those norms take roots, you don&rsquo;t get to just isolate</p>
<p>yourself and pull yourself out of the culture and think, I don&rsquo;t have any responsibility.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already a part of the culture.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re isolating yourself from it, that&rsquo;s a way of rejecting the sort of part</p>
<p>you play in the culture, but it&rsquo;s not a way of getting behind it.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re playing that role differently.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, I don&rsquo;t want to take responsibility for what&rsquo;s going on around me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a way of taking responsibility by refusing to do it.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re implicated in whatever&rsquo;s going on around us.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re going to do anything in our lives, we ought to recognize that, recognize that</p>
<p>even in situations where you maybe didn&rsquo;t decide to do it, you could be part of bringing</p>
<p>other people down and then devote yourself to trying to figure out how to act differently</p>
<p>so that the norms update themselves.</p>
<p>And I think this is not a criticism of people.</p>
<p>Alyosha, who we mentioned in The Brothers Karamazov, he&rsquo;s a character, he&rsquo;s a kind of</p>
<p>saintly character in The Brothers Karamazov.</p>
<p>But that one crucial moment in that story is when he realizes how awful he&rsquo;s been being</p>
<p>to someone without ever even intending to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Grushenka, who&rsquo;s this sort of fascinating woman, and she&rsquo;s a very erotic woman.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s sort of sexual.</p>
<p>And Alyosha, in my reading of it, is kind of attracted to her.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s a young kid, he&rsquo;s 20 or whatever, and he&rsquo;s kind of embarrassed about it.</p>
<p>And he lives in the monastery and he&rsquo;s thinking maybe he wants to be a priest and he&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of embarrassed by it.</p>
<p>So what does he do?</p>
<p>Every time they run across one another in the street, he averts his gaze.</p>
<p>And why is he doing that?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s kind of embarrassed.</p>
<p>But how does Grushenka experience it?</p>
<p>Well, she knows she&rsquo;s a fallen woman and she knows that Alyosha has this other position</p>
<p>in society.</p>
<p>So her read on it is, he&rsquo;s passing judgment on me.</p>
<p>He can see that he doesn&rsquo;t want to be associated with me.</p>
<p>He can see that I&rsquo;m a fallen woman.</p>
<p>He knows that in order to maintain his purity, he&rsquo;s got to avoid me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what Alyosha intended to do, but that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s experienced.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this way he comes to recognize, oh my God, what I&rsquo;m supposed to do is love</p>
<p>people in Dostoevsky&rsquo;s view of things.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m doing instead is dragging this poor woman down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making her life worse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making her feel terrible about herself.</p>
<p>And if I actually came to know her, I&rsquo;d recognize her condition is difficult.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s living a difficult life.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s making hard choices.</p>
<p>And why don&rsquo;t I see that in her face instead of this other thing that&rsquo;s making me want</p>
<p>to avoid her?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a huge moment.</p>
<p>So, but the idea is that we&rsquo;re implicated in bringing other people down, whether we</p>
<p>want to be or not, and that&rsquo;s our condition.</p>
<p>The requirement to understand that is to be almost to a radical degree, be empathetic</p>
<p>and to listen to the world.</p>
<p>And I mean, you brought up sort of gender roles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so simple.</p>
<p>All of this is messy.</p>
<p>For example, this is me talking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that, for example, the woke culture has bullying built into it, has some</p>
<p>elements of the same kind of evil built into it.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re part of the wave of wokeness standing up for social rights, you also have</p>
<p>to listen and think, are we going too far?</p>
<p>Are we hurting people?</p>
<p>Are we doing the same things that others that we&rsquo;re fighting against, that others were doing</p>
<p>in the past?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not simple once you see that there&rsquo;s evil being done that is easy to fix.</p>
<p>No, in our society, there&rsquo;s something about our human nature that just too easily stops</p>
<p>listening to the world, to empathizing with the world.</p>
<p>And we label things as evil.</p>
<p>This is through human history.</p>
<p>This is evil.</p>
<p>You mentioned tribes.</p>
<p>This religious belief is evil.</p>
<p>And so we have to fight it and we become certain and dogmatic about it.</p>
<p>And then in so doing, commit evil onto the world.</p>
<p>It seems like a life that accepts and responsibility for the norms we&rsquo;re in has to constantly be</p>
<p>sort of questioning yourself and questioning, like listening to the world fully and richly</p>
<p>without being weighed down by any one sort of realization.</p>
<p>You just always constantly have to be thinking about the world.</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Am I wrong in seeing the world this way?</p>
<p>I mean, the very last thing you said, you&rsquo;ve constantly got to be thinking about the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve constantly got to be listening.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve constantly got to be attending.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not simple.</p>
<p>All that sounds exactly right to me.</p>
<p>The phrase that rings through my head is another one from the Brothers Karamazov.</p>
<p>Demetri, this passionate sort of sometimes violent brother who is also sort of deeply</p>
<p>cares.</p>
<p>I mean, because he&rsquo;s passionate, he&rsquo;s sort of got care through and through, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>breaking him apart.</p>
<p>He says at one point, God and the devil are fighting and the battlefield is the heart</p>
<p>of man.</p>
<p>And I just think, yeah, it&rsquo;s not simple.</p>
<p>And the idea that there might be a purely good way of doing things is just not our condition.</p>
<p>That everything we do is going to be sort of undermined by some aspect of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not going to be a kind of pure good in human existence.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s sort of required that we&rsquo;re going to have to be empathetic, that we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to recognize that others are dealing with that just as we are.</p>
<p>So I apologize for distracting us.</p>
<p>We were talking about Heidegger and the reason we were distracted is he happened to also</p>
<p>be a Nazi, but he nevertheless has a lot of powerful ideas.</p>
<p>What are the ideas he&rsquo;s brought to the world?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big, huge question.</p>
<p>So let me see how much of it I can get on the table.</p>
<p>I mean, the big picture is that Heidegger thinks, and he&rsquo;s not really wrong to think</p>
<p>this, that the whole history of philosophy from Plato forward, maybe even from the pre</p>
<p>Socratics forward, from like the sixth century BC to now has been grounded on a certain kind</p>
<p>of assumption that it didn&rsquo;t have the right to make and that it&rsquo;s led us astray.</p>
<p>And that until we understand the way in which it&rsquo;s led us astray, we&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>able to get to grips with the condition we now find ourselves in.</p>
<p>So let me start with what he thinks the condition we now find ourselves in is.</p>
<p>Lots of periods to Heidegger&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to sort of mush it all together for the purposes of today.</p>
<p>Heidegger thinks that one of the crucial things that we need to contend with when we think</p>
<p>about what it is to be us now is that the right name for our age is a technological</p>
<p>age.</p>
<p>And what does it mean for our age to be a technological age?</p>
<p>Well, it means that we have an understanding of what it is for anything at all to be at</p>
<p>all that we never really chose, that sort of animating the way we live our lives, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>animating our understanding of ourselves and everything else that is quite limited.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s organized around the idea that to be something is to be what&rsquo;s sitting there</p>
<p>as an infinitely flexible reserve to be optimized and made efficient.</p>
<p>And Heidegger thinks that&rsquo;s not just the way we think of silicon circuits or the river</p>
<p>when we put a hydroelectric power plant on it, we&rsquo;re optimizing the flow of the river</p>
<p>so that it makes energy which is infinitely flexible and we can use in any way at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way we understand ourselves too.</p>
<p>We think of ourselves as this reserve of potential that needs to be made efficient and optimized.</p>
<p>And when I talk with my students about it, I ask them, what&rsquo;s your calendar look like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal of your day?</p>
<p>Is it to get as many things into it as possible?</p>
<p>Is it to feel like I&rsquo;ve failed unless I&rsquo;ve made my life so efficient that I&rsquo;m doing this</p>
<p>and this and this and this and this that I can&rsquo;t let things go by?</p>
<p>The feeling that I think we all have that there&rsquo;s some pressure to do that, to relate</p>
<p>to ourselves that way is a clue to what Heidegger thinks the technological age is about.</p>
<p>And he thinks that&rsquo;s different from every other age in history.</p>
<p>We used to think of ourselves in the 17th century at the beginning of the Enlightenment</p>
<p>as subjects who represent objects, Descartes thought that a subject is something, some</p>
<p>mental sort of realm that represents the world in a certain way.</p>
<p>And we are closed in on ourselves in the sense that we have a special relation to our representations</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the realm of the subject is.</p>
<p>But others, in the Middle Ages, we were created in the image and likeness of God.</p>
<p>In the pre Socratic age, to be was to be what whooshes up and lingers for a while and fades</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>The paradigm of what is were thunderstorms and the anger of the gods, Achilles battle</p>
<p>fury and it overtakes everything and stays for a while and then leaves, the flowers blooming</p>
<p>in spring.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very different from the way we experience ourselves.</p>
<p>And so the question is, what are we supposed to do in the face of that?</p>
<p>And Heidegger thinks that the presupposition that&rsquo;s motivated everything from the pre Socratics</p>
<p>forward is that there is some entity that&rsquo;s the ground of the way we understand everything</p>
<p>to be. For the Middle Ages, it was God.</p>
<p>That was the entity that made things be the things that they are.</p>
<p>For the Enlightenment, it was us.</p>
<p>Maybe for Sartre, it&rsquo;s us.</p>
<p>And Heidegger thinks whatever it is that stands at the ground of what we are, it&rsquo;s not another</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not another entity.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re relating to it in the wrong way if we think of it like that.</p>
<p>This is partly why I was interested in Meister Eckhart.</p>
<p>He says, what there is is there&rsquo;s giving going on in the world, and we&rsquo;re the grateful recipient</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>And the giving is like whatever it is, it&rsquo;s the social norms that we&rsquo;re thrown into.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t choose them.</p>
<p>They were given to us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the ground.</p>
<p>That is what makes it possible for anything to be intelligible at all.</p>
<p>If we lived outside of communities, if we lived in a world where there were no social</p>
<p>norms at all, nothing would mean anything.</p>
<p>Nothing would have any significance.</p>
<p>Nothing would be regular in the way that things need to be regular in order for there to be</p>
<p>departures or manifestations of that regularity.</p>
<p>So community norms are crucial, but they&rsquo;re also always updating.</p>
<p>We have some responsibility for what they are and the way in which they&rsquo;re updating</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>And yet we didn&rsquo;t ever choose it to be that way.</p>
<p>So those norms are somehow giving significance to us in a way that we&rsquo;re implicated in,</p>
<p>we have some relation to, and all that gets covered over if you think of us as efficient</p>
<p>resources to be optimized.</p>
<p>Is that a conflicting view that we are resources to be optimized?</p>
<p>Is that somehow deeply conflicting with the fact that there&rsquo;s a ground that we stand on?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So what Heidegger thinks is that this is, he calls this the supreme danger of the technological</p>
<p>age is that without ever having chosen it, without ever having decided it, this is the</p>
<p>way we understand what it is to be us.</p>
<p>But he thinks that it&rsquo;s also, he says, quoting Holderlin, this 18th century German poet,</p>
<p>he says, in the supreme danger lies the saving possibility.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that this is the understanding that we&rsquo;ve been thrown into, that we&rsquo;ve been given.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the gift that was given to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supremely dangerous.</p>
<p>If we let ourselves live that way, we&rsquo;ll destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the saving possibility because if we recognize that we never chose that,</p>
<p>that it was given to us, but also we were implicated in its being given and we could</p>
<p>find a way to supersede it, that it&rsquo;s the ground, but it&rsquo;s also updatable.</p>
<p>He calls the ground, the groundless ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like an entity, which is there, solid, stable, like God, who&rsquo;s eternal and nonchanging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always updating itself and we&rsquo;re always involved in its being updated, but we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>involved in it in the right way if we listen, like Miles Davis.</p>
<p>So optimization is not a good way to live life.</p>
<p>If you thought that it was obviously clear that that was the relevant value, so obviously</p>
<p>clear that it never even occurred to you to ask whether it was right to think that, then</p>
<p>you would be in danger.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So yeah, there is some in this modern technological age, in the full meaning of the word technology,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s updated to actual modern age with a lot more technology going on.</p>
<p>It does feel like colleagues of mine in the tech space actually are somehow drawn to that</p>
<p>optimization as if that&rsquo;s going to save us, as if the thing that truly weighs us down</p>
<p>is the inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I think if you think about other contexts, like what are the moments when, I mean, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unique in this respect.</p>
<p>This period in history is unlike any previous period.</p>
<p>Nobody ever felt that way.</p>
<p>But think about, but it&rsquo;s also true that no previous period in history was nihilistic.</p>
<p>So our condition is tied up, that sort of thing is meant to be a response to the felt</p>
<p>lack of a ground.</p>
<p>And so no previous epoch in history felt that way.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have our problem.</p>
<p>So it was much more natural to them to experience moments in ways that feel unachievable for</p>
<p>us, what we were calling moments of aliveness before.</p>
<p>Think about the context in which they felt them.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t efficient, optimized contexts.</p>
<p>Think about the Greeks.</p>
<p>If you ever read Homer, it is a bizarre world back there.</p>
<p>But one of the things that&rsquo;s bizarre is that they&rsquo;re so unmotivated by efficiency and optimizing</p>
<p>that the only thing that seems to run through all of the different Greek cultures is the</p>
<p>idea that if some stranger comes by, you better take care of them because Zeus is the god</p>
<p>of strangers and Zeus will be angry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they say, right?</p>
<p>But how does it manifest itself?</p>
<p>Odysseus, he&rsquo;s trying to get home and he gets shipwrecked on an island and he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to figure out, he&rsquo;s been at sea for 10 days, he&rsquo;s starving, he&rsquo;s bedraggled and he sees</p>
<p>now Sissa, the princess who&rsquo;s beautiful and he&rsquo;s like, boy, I better, I don&rsquo;t know, get</p>
<p>some clothes or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to beat me up and kill me.</p>
<p>And so she takes him to the palace.</p>
<p>They have three days of banquets and festivals before they even ask his name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s a stranger.</p>
<p>Our job is to celebrate the presence of a stranger because this is where significance</p>
<p>lies.</p>
<p>Now we don&rsquo;t have to feel that way, but the idea that that&rsquo;s one of the places where significance</p>
<p>could lie is pretty strongly at odds with the idea that our salvation is going to come</p>
<p>from optimization and efficiency.</p>
<p>Maybe something about the way we live our lives will have that integrated into it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s at odds with other moments.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question about Hubert Burt Dreyfus.</p>
<p>He is a friend, a colleague, a mentor of yours, unfortunately no longer with us.</p>
<p>You wrote with him the book titled All Things Shining, Reading the Western Classics to Find</p>
<p>Meaning in a Secular Age.</p>
<p>First, can you maybe speak about who that man was, what you learned from him?</p>
<p>And then we can maybe ask, how do we find through the classics meaning in a secular</p>
<p>age?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, Burt Dreyfus was a very important philosopher of the late 20th, early 21st century.</p>
<p>He died in 2017, about a little over four years ago.</p>
<p>He was my teacher.</p>
<p>I met him in 1989 when I went away to graduate school in Berkeley, that&rsquo;s where he taught.</p>
<p>He plays an interesting and important role in the history of philosophy in America because</p>
<p>in a period when most philosophers in America and in the English speaking world were not</p>
<p>taking seriously 20th century French and German philosophy, he was.</p>
<p>And he was really probably the most important English speaking interpreter of Heidegger,</p>
<p>the German philosopher that we&rsquo;re talking about, we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>He was an incredible teacher, a lot of his influence came through his teaching.</p>
<p>And one of the amazing things about him as a teacher was his sort of mix of intellectual</p>
<p>humility with sort of deep insightful authority.</p>
<p>And he would stand up in front of a class of 300 students, he taught huge classes because</p>
<p>people love to go see him and I taught for him for many years and say, I&rsquo;ve been reading</p>
<p>this text for 40 years, but the question you asked is one I&rsquo;ve never asked.</p>
<p>And it would be true.</p>
<p>He would find in what people said, things that were surprising and new to him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s humility actually.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>Listening to the world.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>He was always ready to be surprised by something that someone said and there&rsquo;s something astonishing</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>So his influence was, for people who didn&rsquo;t know him through his interpretations of these</p>
<p>texts, he wrote about a huge range of stuff.</p>
<p>But for people who did know him, it was through his presence, it was through the way he carried</p>
<p>himself in his life.</p>
<p>And so in any case, that&rsquo;s who he was.</p>
<p>I graduated after many years as a graduate student.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t start in philosophy, I started in math, math and computer science, actually.</p>
<p>And then I did a lot of work in computational neuroscience for a few years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating journey.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to it through our friendly conversation about artificial intelligence, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re basically fascinated with the philosophy of mind, of the human mind, but</p>
<p>rooted in a curiosity of mind through the, it&rsquo;s artificial, through the engineering of</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So Bert, I mean, the reason I was attracted to him actually is because of his, to begin</p>
<p>with, was because of his criticisms of what was called traditional symbolic AI in the</p>
<p>70s and 80s.</p>
<p>So I came to Berkeley as a graduate student who&rsquo;d done a lot of math and a lot of computer</p>
<p>science, a lot of computational neuroscience.</p>
<p>I noticed that you interview a lot of people in this world.</p>
<p>And I had a teacher at Brown as an undergraduate, Jim Anderson, who wrote with Jeff Hinton a</p>
<p>big book on neural networks.</p>
<p>So I was interested in that, not so interested in traditional AI, like sort of Lisp programming,</p>
<p>things that went on in the 80s, because it felt sort of, when you made a system do something,</p>
<p>all of a sudden it was an interesting thing to have done.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;d solved the problem then made it clear that the problem wasn&rsquo;t an interesting</p>
<p>one to solve.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I had that experience.</p>
<p>And Bert had criticisms of symbolic AI, what he called good old fashioned AI, GoFi.</p>
<p>And I was attracted to those criticisms because it felt to me that there was something lacking</p>
<p>in that project.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know what it was.</p>
<p>I just felt its absence.</p>
<p>And then I learned that all his arguments came from his reading of this phenomenological</p>
<p>and existential tradition.</p>
<p>And so I had to try to figure out what those folks were saying.</p>
<p>And it was a long road, let me tell you.</p>
<p>It took me a long time.</p>
<p>But it was because of Bert that I was able to do that.</p>
<p>So I owe him that huge debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>And eventually we went on to write a book together, which was a great experience.</p>
<p>And yes, we published All Things Shining in 2011.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a book that I definitely would not have had the chutzpah to try to write</p>
<p>if it weren&rsquo;t for Bert because it was really about great literature in the history of the</p>
<p>West from Homer and Virgil and Dante to Melville.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge chapter on Melville, a big chapter on David Foster Wallace who Bert didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care about at all, but I was fascinated by.</p>
<p>And so learning to think that way while writing that book with him was an amazing experience.</p>
<p>So I have to admit, as one of my failings in life, one of many failings is I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>gotten through Moby Dick or any of Melville&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>So maybe can you comment on, before we talk about David Foster Wallace, who I have gotten</p>
<p>through, what are some of the sources of meaning in these classics?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So Moby Dick, I think, is the other great novel of the 19th century.</p>
<p>So the Brothers Karamazov and Moby Dick, and they&rsquo;re diametrically opposed, which is one</p>
<p>of the really interesting things.</p>
<p>So Dostoyev, the Brothers Karamazov is a kind of existential interpretation of Russian Orthodox</p>
<p>Christianity.</p>
<p>How do you live that way and find joy in your existence?</p>
<p>Moby Dick is not at all about Christianity.</p>
<p>It sort of starts with the observation that the form of Christianity that Ishmael is familiar</p>
<p>with is broken, it&rsquo;s not gonna work in his living his life.</p>
<p>He has to leave it, he has to go to sea in order to find what needs to happen.</p>
<p>And Ishmael is the boating captain, the whaling boat captain.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not the captain, that&rsquo;s Ahab.</p>
<p>Ahab is the captain.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Let me back up.</p>
<p>The famous opening line to the book is, call me Ishmael.</p>
<p>And Ishmael is the main character in the book.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a nobody.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s you and me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the everyday guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a nobody on the ship.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, not the lowest, but certainly not the highest.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right in the middle.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s named Ishmael, which is interesting, because Ishmael is the illegitimate son of</p>
<p>Abraham in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>He is the, I think if I have it right, again, someone will correct me.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s the one that Islam traces its genesis to.</p>
<p>And so Islam is an Abrahamic religion like Judaism and Christianity, but Judaism and</p>
<p>Christianity trace their lineage through Isaac, the quote, unquote, legitimate son of Abraham.</p>
<p>And Ishmael is the other son of Abraham, who he had with a girlfriend.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s clearly outside of Christianity in some way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s named after the non Christian sort of son of Abraham.</p>
<p>And the book starts out with this, what does he call it, something like a dark and misty</p>
<p>November mood.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s walking along the street and he&rsquo;s overcome by his, I can&rsquo;t remember what the word is,</p>
<p>but his hypos.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he calls them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in a mood.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s depressed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>Things are not going well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where he starts.</p>
<p>And he signs up to go on this whaling voyage with this captain Ahab, who is this incredibly</p>
<p>charismatic, deeply disturbing character, who is a captain who&rsquo;s got lots of history</p>
<p>and wants to go whaling, wants to get whales.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>They harpoon these whales and bring them back and sell the blubber and the oil and so on.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s kind of rich and he&rsquo;s famous and he&rsquo;s powerful, he&rsquo;s an authority figure.</p>
<p>And he is megalomaniacally obsessed with getting one particular whale, which is called Moby</p>
<p>Dick.</p>
<p>And Moby Dick is like the largest, the whitest, the sort of most terrifying of all the whales.</p>
<p>And Ahab wants to get him because a number of years earlier, he had an encounter with</p>
<p>Moby Dick where Moby Dick bit off his leg.</p>
<p>And he survived, but he had this deeply religious experience in the wake of it.</p>
<p>And he needed to find out what the meaning of that was.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of my suffering?</p>
<p>Who am I such that the world and Moby Dick, this leviathan at the center of it should</p>
<p>treat me this way.</p>
<p>And so his task is not just to go whaling, it&rsquo;s to figure out the meaning of the universe</p>
<p>through going whaling and having a confrontation with his tormentor, this whale, Moby Dick.</p>
<p>And the confrontation is so weird because Melville points out that whales, their faces</p>
<p>are so huge, their foreheads are so huge, and their eyes are on the side of them that</p>
<p>you can never actually look them in the eye.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of a metaphor for God, like you can&rsquo;t ever look God in the face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of traditional thing to say about God.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t find the ultimate meaning of the universe by looking God in the face.</p>
<p>But Ahab wants to.</p>
<p>He says he&rsquo;s got a pasteboard mask of a face, but I&rsquo;ll strike through the mask and find</p>
<p>out what&rsquo;s behind.</p>
<p>And so Ishmael is sort of caught up in this thing, and he&rsquo;s like going whaling because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in a bad mood, and maybe this will make things better.</p>
<p>And he makes friends with this guy Queequeg.</p>
<p>And Queequeg is a pagan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s from an island in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got tattoos all over his body, head to toe.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s party colored, like every different color, says Ishmael, is these tattoos.</p>
<p>And they are the writing on his body, he says, of the immutable mysteries of the universe</p>
<p>as understood through his culture.</p>
<p>And so somehow Queequeg is this character who is like not Christian at all.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s powerful in a very different way than Ahab is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s supposed to be the king, he&rsquo;s the son of the king, and probably his father&rsquo;s died</p>
<p>by now.</p>
<p>If he was home, he&rsquo;d be the king.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s off on a voyage too, trying to understand who he is before he goes back and leads his</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a harpooner, the bravest of the people on the ship.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got the mystery of the universe tattooed on his body, but nobody can understand it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s through his relation with Queequeg that Ishmael comes to get a different understanding</p>
<p>of what we might be about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Moby Dick in a nutshell.</p>
<p>And connected to a book I have read, which is funny, there&rsquo;s probably echoes that represent</p>
<p>the 20th century now in Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway that also has similar, I guess,</p>
<p>themes, but more personal, more focused on the, I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s less about God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost more like the existentialist version of Moby Dick.</p>
<p>And hence shorter.</p>
<p>And a lot shorter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, Hemingway was brilliant that way.</p>
<p>But do you see echoes and do you find Old Man and the Sea interesting?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been since ninth grade that I read Old Man and the Sea even longer ago than The Fountainhead.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know we were going to go there.</p>
<p>I mean, I find Hemingway interesting, but Hemingway, my general sort of picture of him</p>
<p>is that we have to confront the dangers and the difficulties of our life.</p>
<p>We have to develop in ourselves a certain kind of courage and manliness.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something interesting about that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s for risk in a certain way.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But now I don&rsquo;t have any right to say this since it&rsquo;s been so long since I read it.</p>
<p>I do feel like there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t remember a sense for quite the tragedy of it.</p>
<p>Maybe there is.</p>
<p>Is it a melancholy novel?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s, I mean, it has a sense like The Stranger by Camus.</p>
<p>It has a sense of like, this is how life is.</p>
<p>And it has more about old age and that you&rsquo;re not quite the man you used to be feeling of</p>
<p>like, this is how time passes.</p>
<p>And then the passing of time and how you get older and this is one last fish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less about this is the fish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like this is one last fish.</p>
<p>And asking, who was I as a man, as a human being in this world?</p>
<p>And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.</p>
<p>Wonderful.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s one fish, which is just sort of all the other fish too.</p>
<p>And that is a big difference because for Ahab, no other fish will do than Moby Dick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be the biggest, the most powerful, the most tormenting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be the one that you&rsquo;ve got history with that has defiled you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a raucous ride, Moby Dick.</p>
<p>What about David Foster Wallace?</p>
<p>So why is he important to you in the search of meaning in a secular age?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just, just to finish the Moby Dick thing, I think what&rsquo;s interesting about Melville</p>
<p>is that he thinks our salvation comes not if we get in the right relation to monotheism</p>
<p>or Christianity, but if we get in the right relation to polytheism, to the idea that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a unity to our existence, but there are lots of little meanings and they don&rsquo;t cohere.</p>
<p>Sometimes like in Homer, sometimes you&rsquo;re in love.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s in love with Paris and they do crazy things.</p>
<p>They go off and run away and the Trojan war begins.</p>
<p>And sometimes you&rsquo;re in a battle fury.</p>
<p>Love is Aphrodite&rsquo;s realm.</p>
<p>And the battle fury, that&rsquo;s Aries realm and that&rsquo;s a totally different world.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not even, I mean, they&rsquo;re related.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of family resemblance, but not much.</p>
<p>Mostly you&rsquo;re just in different sort of local meaningful worlds.</p>
<p>And Melville seems to think that that&rsquo;s a thing that we could aim to bring back.</p>
<p>He says we have to lure back the Merry May Day gods of old and lovingly enthrone them</p>
<p>in the now egotistical sky, the now unhaunted hill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we live in this world where hills aren&rsquo;t haunted with significance anymore.</p>
<p>And the sky is just a bunch of stuff that we&rsquo;re studying with physics and astrophysics</p>
<p>and stuff.</p>
<p>But they used to be awe inspiring and we have to figure out how to get in that relation</p>
<p>to them, but not by trying to give a unity to our existence through developing habits</p>
<p>and practices that get written on our body.</p>
<p>And so his is about the end of Judeo Christianity and the sort of Roman appropriation of it.</p>
<p>In Wallace, one of the things I think is so interesting about him is that I think he is</p>
<p>a great observer of the contemporary world.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a very funny writer, he&rsquo;s really funny.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s a great observer of the contemporary world and what he thought was at the core</p>
<p>of the contemporary world was this constant temptation to diversion through entertainment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different story than Heidegger&rsquo;s story about efficiency and optimization, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the other side of it.</p>
<p>What is this temptation sort of diverting us from?</p>
<p>The ability to be more efficient.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re tempted to go watch some stupid film or television show or something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dumb and not really very interesting, but you read that temptation as a temptation precisely</p>
<p>in virtue of it&rsquo;s taking you away from your optimizing your existence.</p>
<p>And so I think there are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s brilliant at describing it.</p>
<p>I think he thought it was a desperate position to be in, that it was something that we needed</p>
<p>to confront and find a way out of and his characters are trying to do that.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s two different David Foster Wallace&rsquo;s, one, I mean, David Foster Wallace</p>
<p>committed suicide and it&rsquo;s very sad.</p>
<p>And he clearly did have sort of, there was a physiological basis to his condition.</p>
<p>He knew it, he was treating it for decades with medication, he had electroshock therapy</p>
<p>a number of times, it&rsquo;s just very, very sad story.</p>
<p>When I decided that we were going to write about David Foster Wallace, the first thing</p>
<p>I was worried about is can you, like obviously a motivating factor, maybe the motivating</p>
<p>factor in his committing suicide was his physiological condition.</p>
<p>But there was a question, could you think, I mean, he&rsquo;s obsessed with the condition with</p>
<p>what we need to do to achieve our salvation, to live well, to make our lives worth living.</p>
<p>And he clearly in the end felt like he couldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So in addition to the physiological thing, which probably most of it, the question for</p>
<p>me was, could you find in his writing what he was identifying as the thing we needed</p>
<p>to be doing that he nevertheless felt we couldn&rsquo;t be doing?</p>
<p>And he talks as if that&rsquo;s the difficulty for him.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one side of him and I did want to find that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another side of him that&rsquo;s very different, but you were going to ask</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>No, please, what&rsquo;s the other side?</p>
<p>I mean, what I write about in the chapter mostly is what I think he&rsquo;s got as our saving</p>
<p>possibility.</p>
<p>He thinks our saving possibility, he says this in a graduation speech that he gave to</p>
<p>Kenyon, is that we have the freedom to interpret situations however we like.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the problem case for him?</p>
<p>He says, look, the problem case, we have it all the time.</p>
<p>You get pissed off at the world.</p>
<p>Some big SUV cuts you off on the highway and you&rsquo;re pissed off and you might express your</p>
<p>anger with one finger or another directed at that person.</p>
<p>And he says, but actually, you&rsquo;re being pissed off as the result of your having made an assumption.</p>
<p>And the assumption is that that action was directed at you.</p>
<p>Like the assumption is that you&rsquo;re the center of the universe and you shouldn&rsquo;t assume that.</p>
<p>And the way to talk yourself out of it, he says, is to recognize the possibility that</p>
<p>maybe that wasn&rsquo;t an action directed at you.</p>
<p>Maybe that guy is racing to the hospital to take care of his dying spouse who&rsquo;s been there</p>
<p>suffering from cancer, or maybe he&rsquo;s on the way to pick up a sick child, or maybe he&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not an action directed, that was your assumption, not something that was inherent</p>
<p>in the situation.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something interesting about that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something right about that.</p>
<p>At the same time, I don&rsquo;t think he speaks as if we can just spin out these stories and</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re true or not doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is that they free us from this assumption.</p>
<p>And I think they only free us from this assumption if they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>Like sometimes the guy really did direct it at you and that&rsquo;s part of the situation.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t pretend that it&rsquo;s not part of the situation.</p>
<p>You have to find the right way of dealing with that situation.</p>
<p>So you have to listen to what&rsquo;s actually happening and then you have to figure out how to make</p>
<p>it right.</p>
<p>And I think he thinks that we have too much freedom.</p>
<p>He thinks that you don&rsquo;t have to listen to the situation, you can just tell whatever</p>
<p>story you like about it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually too tough.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have that kind of freedom.</p>
<p>And he writes these sort of incredibly moving letters when he&rsquo;s trying to write The Pale</p>
<p>King, which is the unfinished novel that really sort of drove him to distraction.</p>
<p>At the center of the novel is this character who&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the characters at the center of the novel is a guy who&rsquo;s doing the most boring</p>
<p>thing you could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>He is an IRS tax examiner.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going over other people&rsquo;s tax returns, trying to figure out whether they followed</p>
<p>the rules or not.</p>
<p>And just the idea of doing that for eight hours a day is just terrifying.</p>
<p>And he puts this guy in a enormous warehouse that extends for miles where person after</p>
<p>person after person is in rows of desks, sort of nameless, each of them doing this task.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s in nowhere doing nothing and it&rsquo;s got to be intensely boring.</p>
<p>And now the main character is trying to teach himself to do that.</p>
<p>And the question is, how do you put up with the boredom?</p>
<p>How do you put up with this onslaught of meaninglessness?</p>
<p>And the main character is able to confront that condition with such bliss that he literally</p>
<p>levitates from happiness while he&rsquo;s going over other people&rsquo;s tax returns.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my metaphor for what I think Wallace must have imagined we have to try to aspire</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s unlivable.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not an ambition that we could achieve.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something else we could achieve.</p>
<p>And the other thing that we can achieve that I think is something that he also is onto</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t write about as often is something more like achieving peak moments of significance</p>
<p>in a situation when something great happens.</p>
<p>And he writes about this in an article about Roger Federer.</p>
<p>He loved tennis.</p>
<p>Are you a tennis lover?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a lover of tennis, but I played tennis for 15 years and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love it the way people love baseball, for example, I see the beauty in it, the artistry.</p>
<p>I just liked it as a sport.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t play much tennis, but I hit a ball around every once in a while as a kid.</p>
<p>And I always thought it was boring to watch.</p>
<p>But reading David Foster Wallace on Roger Federer, you&rsquo;re like, wow, I&rsquo;ve been missing</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>And the article which appeared in the New York Times Magazine was called Roger Federer</p>
<p>as Religious Experience.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>And he says, look, there&rsquo;s something astonishing about watching someone who&rsquo;s got a body like</p>
<p>us and having a body as a limitation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the sight of sores and pains and agony and exhaustion.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the thing that dies in the end.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s what we have to confront.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s also joys that go along with having a body.</p>
<p>Like if you didn&rsquo;t have a body, there&rsquo;d be no sex.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have a body, there&rsquo;d be no sort of physical excitement and so on.</p>
<p>But somehow having a body is essentially a limitation that when you watch someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got one and is extraordinary at the way they use it, you can recognize how that limitation</p>
<p>can be to some degree transcended.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we can get when we watch Federer or some other great athlete sort of doing</p>
<p>these things that transcend the limitations of their bodies.</p>
<p>And that that&rsquo;s the kind of peak experience that we&rsquo;re capable of that could be a kind</p>
<p>of salvation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very different story.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a livable story.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it would have saved him, but I feel like I wish he&rsquo;d developed that</p>
<p>side of the story more.</p>
<p>Can we talk about&hellip;</p>
<p>And first of all, let me just comment that I deeply appreciate that you said you were</p>
<p>going to say something.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re listening to me is amazing.</p>
<p>Like that you care about other humans and I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>We should be in this way listening to the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a meta comment about many of the things we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But you mentioned something about levitating and a task that is infinitely boring and contrasting</p>
<p>that with essentially levitating on a task that is great, like the highest achievement</p>
<p>of this physical limiting body in playing tennis.</p>
<p>Now I often say this, I don&rsquo;t know where I heard David Foster Wallace say this, but he</p>
<p>said that the key to life is to be unborable, that is the embodiment of this philosophy.</p>
<p>And when people ask me for advice, young students, I don&rsquo;t find this interesting, I don&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>this interesting, how do I find the thing I&rsquo;m passionate for?</p>
<p>This would be very interesting to explore because you kind of say that that may not</p>
<p>be a realizable thing to do, which is to be unborable.</p>
<p>So my advice usually is life is amazing, like you should be able to, you should strive to</p>
<p>discover the joy, the levitation in everything.</p>
<p>And the thing you get stuck on for a longer period of time, that might be the thing you</p>
<p>should stick to, but everything should be full of joy.</p>
<p>So that kind of cynicism of saying life is boring is a thing that will prevent you from</p>
<p>discovering the thing that will give you deep meaning and joy, but you&rsquo;re saying being unborable</p>
<p>is not actionable for a human being.</p>
<p>So okay, excellent question, deep question.</p>
<p>And you might think because of the title of the book that Bert and I wrote, All Things</p>
<p>Shining, that I think all things are shining.</p>
<p>But actually, I think it&rsquo;s an unachievable goal to be unborable.</p>
<p>I do believe that you&rsquo;re right, that a lot of times when people are bored with something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because they haven&rsquo;t tried hard enough.</p>
<p>And I do think quite a lot of what makes people bored with something is that they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>paid attention well enough and that they haven&rsquo;t listened, as you were saying.</p>
<p>So I do think there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a deep insight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the perfection of that insight is that nothing is ever anything less</p>
<p>than joyful.</p>
<p>And I actually think that Dostoevsky and Melville both agree, but in very different ways, that</p>
<p>life involves a wide range of moods and that all of them are important.</p>
<p>It involves grief.</p>
<p>I think when someone dies, it&rsquo;s appropriate to grieve.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not in the first instance joyful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to joy because it makes the joys you feel when you feel them more intense.</p>
<p>But it makes them more intense by putting you in the position of experiencing the opposite.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only because we&rsquo;re capable of a wide range of passionate responses to situations</p>
<p>that I think the significances can be as meaningful as they are.</p>
<p>So Melville, again, has this sort of interest.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say the guilt and the grief in the brothers Karamazov.</p>
<p>Alyosha loses his mentor, Father Zosima.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s grieving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super important that he&rsquo;s grieving.</p>
<p>He has a religious conversion on the basis of grieving where he sees the deep beauty</p>
<p>of everything that is, but it comes through the grief, not by avoiding the grief.</p>
<p>And Melville says something like, Ishmael says something like, he says, I&rsquo;m like a Catskill</p>
<p>mountain eagle, the Catskills mountains nearby.</p>
<p>He says, who&rsquo;s flying high above the earth, going over the peaks and down into the valleys.</p>
<p>I have these ups and these downs, but they&rsquo;re all invested with a kind of significance.</p>
<p>They all happen at an enormously high height because it&rsquo;s through the mountains that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>flying.</p>
<p>And even when I&rsquo;m down, it&rsquo;s a way of being up.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s a way of being up because it makes the ups even upper.</p>
<p>Well, I guess then the perfectionism of that can be destructive.</p>
<p>I tend to see, for example, grief, a loss of love as part of love in that it&rsquo;s a celebration</p>
<p>of the richness of feelings you had when you had the love.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all part of the same experience, but if you turn it into an optimization problem</p>
<p>where everything can be unboreable, then that can in itself be destructive.</p>
<p>I heard this interview with David Foster Wallace on the internet where it&rsquo;s a video of him</p>
<p>and there is like a foreign sounding reporter asking him questions.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an accent of some sort, German, I think, something like that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, it just painted a picture of such a human person.</p>
<p>We were talking about listening.</p>
<p>The interviewer, if I may say, wasn&rsquo;t a very good one in the beginning.</p>
<p>So she kind of walked in doing the usual journalistic things of just kind of generic questions and</p>
<p>just kind of asking very basic questions.</p>
<p>But he brought out something in her over time.</p>
<p>And he was so sensitive and so sensitive to her and also sensitive to being a thinking</p>
<p>and acting human in this world that just painted such a beautiful picture that people should</p>
<p>go definitely check out.</p>
<p>It made me really sad that we don&rsquo;t get this kind of picture of other thinkers, all of</p>
<p>the ones we&rsquo;ve been talking about, just that almost this little accidental view of this</p>
<p>human being.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful one and I guess there&rsquo;s not many like that even of him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I think he was more than his writing ability, which was extraordinary.</p>
<p>He had developed a style that was, I think, unlike anyone else&rsquo;s style, was his sensitivity</p>
<p>to other people and to sort of what he was there to pay attention to.</p>
<p>In one of his essays, I think it&rsquo;s the one called An Incredibly Fun Thing I&rsquo;ll Never</p>
<p>Do Again.</p>
<p>Do you know that one about cruise ships?</p>
<p>I think he describes himself as this sort of roving eyeball that just sort of walks</p>
<p>around the ship noticing things and he was incredibly good at that.</p>
<p>But I also worry that that reflects something that you find in Ivan in The Brothers Karamazov.</p>
<p>Ivan, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember this part, when he&rsquo;s away at school, at college as a</p>
<p>young boy, he makes money by going around town to where tragic events have occurred.</p>
<p>Someone just got run over by a carriage or something just happened.</p>
<p>Being the first one there, he always knows somehow where these things are going to happen</p>
<p>and writing about it, giving this really good description and then signing it eyewitness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if Ivan&rsquo;s understanding of his life is that he was supposed to be a witness to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>He was supposed to see others but not get involved.</p>
<p>He never is interested in trying to keep the bad things from happening.</p>
<p>He just wants to report on them when he sees them.</p>
<p>And I think that he&rsquo;s an incredibly isolated person, character, and it&rsquo;s his isolation</p>
<p>from others, from the love of others and his inability, his desire not to love others because</p>
<p>that attaches him to someone that I think is really at the ground of his condition.</p>
<p>And I think that aim to be isolated, which many people have nowadays.</p>
<p>You see it in The Underground Man too, just sort of taking yourself out of the world because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna have to take responsibility for being involved with others.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a bad move and I do worry that maybe, I mean, I never knew David Foster Wallace,</p>
<p>I have no right to comment on his life.</p>
<p>But he portrays himself in that one episode as a person who does that and I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dangerous.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some sense in which being sensitive to the world, like I find myself, the source</p>
<p>of joy for me is just being really sensitive to the world, to experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some way, it&rsquo;s quite brilliant what you&rsquo;re saying that that could be isolating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Darwin studying a new kind of species on an island you don&rsquo;t want to interfere with.</p>
<p>You find it so beautiful that you don&rsquo;t want to interfere with its beauty.</p>
<p>So there is some sense in which that isolates you and then you find yourself deeply alone,</p>
<p>away from the experiences that bring you joy.</p>
<p>And that could be destructive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating how that works and in his case, of course, some of it is just chemicals</p>
<p>in his brain, but some of it is the path, his philosophy of life let him down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the danger with Nietzsche too and gazing into the abyss.</p>
<p>Your job is a difficult one because doing philosophy changes you and you may not know</p>
<p>how it changes you until you&rsquo;re changed and you look in the mirror.</p>
<p>You wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review saying that AI can&rsquo;t be an artist.</p>
<p>Creativity is and always will be a human endeavor.</p>
<p>You mentioned BERT and criticism of symbolic AI.</p>
<p>Can you explain your view of criticizing the possible, the capacity for artistry and creativity</p>
<p>in our robot friends?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can try.</p>
<p>So to make the argument, you have to have in mind what counts as art, what counts as</p>
<p>a creative artistic act.</p>
<p>I take it that just doing something new isn&rsquo;t sufficient.</p>
<p>We say that good art is original, but not everything that&rsquo;s never been done before is</p>
<p>good art.</p>
<p>So there has to be more than just doing something new.</p>
<p>It has to be somehow doing something new in a way that speaks to the audience or speaks</p>
<p>to some portion of the audience at least.</p>
<p>It has to be doing something new in such a way that some people who see or interact with</p>
<p>it can see themselves anew in it.</p>
<p>So I think that art is inherently a creative act, sorry, a kind of communicative act that</p>
<p>it involves a relation with other people.</p>
<p>So think about the conditions for that working.</p>
<p>I talk in that article, I can&rsquo;t remember, something about new music.</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t talk about Stravinsky, but let&rsquo;s say Stravinsky.</p>
<p>Stravinsky performs the Rite of Spring and there&rsquo;s riots.</p>
<p>It is new and people hate it.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>It sounds like a cacophony.</p>
<p>It sounds awful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written according to principles that are not like the principles of music composition</p>
<p>that people are familiar with.</p>
<p>So in some ways it&rsquo;s a failed communicative act.</p>
<p>But as Nietzsche says about his own stuff, we now can recognize that it wasn&rsquo;t a failed</p>
<p>communicative act, it just hadn&rsquo;t reached its time yet.</p>
<p>And now that way of composing music is like it&rsquo;s in Disney movies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so part of our musical palette that we don&rsquo;t have that response.</p>
<p>It changed us.</p>
<p>It changed the way we understand what counts as good music.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a deep communicative act.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t perform its communication in that opening moment, but it did ultimately establish</p>
<p>a new understanding for all of us of what counts as good art.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of deep communication that I think good art can do.</p>
<p>It can change our understanding of ourselves and of what a good manifestation of something</p>
<p>of ourselves in a certain domain is.</p>
<p>And you use the term socially embedded, that art is fundamentally socially embedded.</p>
<p>And I really liked that term because I see like my love for artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>the kind of system that we can bring to the world that could make for an interesting and</p>
<p>more lively world and one that enriches human beings is one where the AI systems are deeply</p>
<p>socially embedded.</p>
<p>And that actually is in contrast to the way artificial intelligence have been talked about</p>
<p>throughout its history and certainly now, both on the robotic side and the AI side,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s especially on the tech sector where the businesses around AI, they kind of want to</p>
<p>create systems that are like servants to humans.</p>
<p>And then humans do all the beautiful human messiness of where art will be part.</p>
<p>I think that there is no reason why you can&rsquo;t integrate AI systems in the way you integrate</p>
<p>new humans to the picture.</p>
<p>There are just the full diversity and the flaws, all of that adds to the thing.</p>
<p>Some people might say that AlphaZero is this system from DeepMind that was able to solve</p>
<p>the game, it beat the best people in the world at the game of Go with no supervision from</p>
<p>humans.</p>
<p>But more interestingly to me on the side of creativity, it was able to surprise a lot</p>
<p>of grandmasters with the kind of moves that came up with.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s not the creativity, the magic that&rsquo;s socially embedded that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>That is merely revealing the limitations of humans to discover.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like to solve a particular aspect of a math problem.</p>
<p>I think creativity is not just even socially embedded, it&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re saying is part</p>
<p>of the communicative act, it&rsquo;s the interactive, it&rsquo;s the dance with the culture.</p>
<p>And so it has to be like for AlphaZero to be creative, truly creative, it would have</p>
<p>to be integrated in a way where it has a Twitter account and it becomes aware of the impact</p>
<p>it has on the other grandmasters with the moves that&rsquo;s coming up.</p>
<p>And one of the fascinating things about AlphaZero, which I just love so much is, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re familiar with chess.</p>
<p>I am, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>So it does certain things that most chess players, even at the highest level don&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>which is it sacrifices pieces, it gives pieces away and then waits like 10 moves before it</p>
<p>pays you back.</p>
<p>So it does, to me, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s art if only AlphaZero understood the artistry of that, which is I&rsquo;m going to mess</p>
<p>with you psychologically because I&rsquo;m going to do two things.</p>
<p>One make you feel overconfident that you&rsquo;re doing well, but actually also once you realize</p>
<p>you are playing AlphaZero that is much better than you, you&rsquo;re going to feel really nervous</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s on the way, like this is the calm before the storm.</p>
<p>And that creates a beautiful psychological masterpiece of this chess game.</p>
<p>If only AlphaZero was then messing with you additionally to that, like and was cognizant</p>
<p>of us doing that, then it becomes art.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s integrated into society in that way.</p>
<p>And I believe it doesn&rsquo;t have to actually have an understanding of the world in the</p>
<p>way that humans have.</p>
<p>It can have a different one.</p>
<p>It can be like a child is clueless about so many aspects of the world and it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the magic of it, just being flawed, lacking understanding in all interesting</p>
<p>kinds of ways, but interacting.</p>
<p>And so to me it&rsquo;s possible to create art for AI, but exactly as you&rsquo;re saying in a deeply</p>
<p>socially embedded way.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Well, I think we agree, but let me just highlight the thing that makes me think that we agree,</p>
<p>which is that I think for people, for a community to allow themselves to recognize in a certain</p>
<p>kind of creative act, I&rsquo;m thinking of Stravinsky here, but we could think of a chess thing,</p>
<p>to recognize in a certain kind of creative act a new and admirable worthy way of thinking</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s significant in the situation, you have to believe that it wasn&rsquo;t random.</p>
<p>You have to believe that Stravinsky wrote that way because he was receptive to what</p>
<p>needed to be said now.</p>
<p>And so you said, if only AlphaZero could do all this by virtue of recognizing that this</p>
<p>was the thing that needed to be done, then it would be socially embedded in the right</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And I think I agree with that.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s possible to do in a constrained domain, a game playing domain, go or chess,</p>
<p>go is more complicated than chess, but either one of them, because there really are only</p>
<p>a finite range of possibilities if you make the game end at a certain point, it&rsquo;s a combinatorial</p>
<p>problem in the end.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, AlphaZero doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem in a combinatorial way.</p>
<p>That would be take too much energy, you couldn&rsquo;t do it, it explodes the problem.</p>
<p>So it does it in this other way that&rsquo;s interesting, this pattern recognition way, roughly.</p>
<p>And in that context, it may well be that it can see, having had lots and lots of experience</p>
<p>in the training stuff against itself or against another version of itself, it can see that</p>
<p>the sacrifice here is gonna pay dividends down the road.</p>
<p>See, I put that in quotation marks, that&rsquo;s to say it&rsquo;s got a high weight to this move</p>
<p>here as a result of experience in the past where that move down the line led to this</p>
<p>improvement.</p>
<p>So in that finite context, I think the game players can trust it and they talk that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a kind of authority.</p>
<p>They say, I&rsquo;ve read some people who said about AlphaZero when it played Go, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>playing from the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making these moves that are just outlandish and there&rsquo;s a kind of brilliance to them that</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t really understand, we&rsquo;ll be catching up to it forever.</p>
<p>I think in that context, it&rsquo;s mapped the domain and the domain is mappable because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>combinatorial problem roughly.</p>
<p>But in something like music or art of a nonfinite form, it feels to me like it&rsquo;s a little harder</p>
<p>for me to understand what the analog of our trusting that Stravinsky has recognized something</p>
<p>about us that demands that he write this way, that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a finite thing in quite</p>
<p>the same way.</p>
<p>So now we could ask the system, why did you do it?</p>
<p>We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?</p>
<p>And maybe it will have answers, but then it&rsquo;s involved in a kind of communicative act.</p>
<p>And I think lots of times artists will often say, look, I can&rsquo;t communicate better than</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve done in the piece of work.</p>
<p>That is the statement.</p>
<p>Yeah, we humans aren&rsquo;t able to answer the why either, but I do think the question here</p>
<p>is, well, first of all, language is finite, certainly when expressed through a tweet.</p>
<p>So it is also a combinatorial problem.</p>
<p>The question is how much more difficult it is than chess.</p>
<p>And I think all the same ways that we see the solutions to chess is deeply surprising</p>
<p>when it was first addressed with IBM D Blue and then with AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero.</p>
<p>I think in that same way, language can be addressed and communication can be addressed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see, having done this podcast, many reasons why everything I&rsquo;m doing, especially</p>
<p>as a digital being on the internet, can&rsquo;t be done by an AI system eventually.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re being very human centric in thinking we&rsquo;re special.</p>
<p>I think one of the hardest things is the physical space, actually operating touch and the magic</p>
<p>of body language and the music of all of that, because it&rsquo;s so deeply integrated through</p>
<p>the long evolutionary process of what it&rsquo;s like to be on earth.</p>
<p>What is fundamentally different and AI can catch up on is the way we apply our evolutionary</p>
<p>history on the way we act on the internet, on the way we act online.</p>
<p>And as more and more of the world becomes digital, you&rsquo;re now operating in a space where</p>
<p>AI is behind much less so, like we&rsquo;re both starting at zero.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>Do you know this, do you know this author, Brian Christian, is that someone you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard of?</p>
<p>That sounds familiar.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a guy who competed in the, what is it called?</p>
<p>The Loebner Competition.</p>
<p>The Loebner Prize.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Turing Test thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just tell you the story, but I think it&rsquo;s directly related to the last thing you</p>
<p>said about where we&rsquo;re starting in the same place.</p>
<p>He competed in this competition, but not, he didn&rsquo;t enter a program that was supposed</p>
<p>to try to pass the Turing Test.</p>
<p>The Turing Test, there&rsquo;s three people, there&rsquo;s the judge, there&rsquo;s the program, and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s a human, the way they do it.</p>
<p>And the judge has got to figure out by asking questions, which is the computer and which</p>
<p>is the human.</p>
<p>So little known fact, there&rsquo;s two prizes in that competition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the most human computer prize, that&rsquo;s the computer that wins the most.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the most human human prize.</p>
<p>And he competed for the most human human prize, and he won it, he kept winning it.</p>
<p>And so he tried to think about what it is that you have to be able to do in order to</p>
<p>convince judges that you&rsquo;re human instead of a computer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting question, I think.</p>
<p>And what he came to, my takeaway from his version of this story is that it is true that</p>
<p>computers are winning these contests more and more as technology progresses.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s two possible explanations for that.</p>
<p>One is that the computers are becoming more human, and the other is that the humans are</p>
<p>becoming more like computers.</p>
<p>And he says, actually, the more we live our lives in this technological world where we</p>
<p>have to moderate our behavior so that it&rsquo;s readable by something that&rsquo;s effectively a</p>
<p>computer, the more we become like that.</p>
<p>And he says, it happens even when you&rsquo;re not interacting with a computer.</p>
<p>He says, have you ever been on the phone with a call center?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going through their script, and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve got to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to go through their script because that&rsquo;s how they keep their job.</p>
<p>And they ask you this question, you&rsquo;ve got to answer it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re no longer interacting with a person, even though it&rsquo;s a person,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve so given up everything that&rsquo;s involved normally with being able to make</p>
<p>judgments and decisions and act in situations and take responsibility.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s the other side of it.</p>
<p>It is true that technology is amazing and can solve huge ranges of problems and do fantastic</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also true that we&rsquo;re changing ourselves in response to it.</p>
<p>And the one thing I&rsquo;m worried about is that we&rsquo;re changing ourselves in such a way that</p>
<p>the norms for what we&rsquo;re aiming at are being changed to move in the direction of this sort</p>
<p>of efficiently and in an optimized way solving a problem and move away from this other kind</p>
<p>of thing that we were calling aliveness or significance.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the other side of the story.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the worry.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very possible that there is, for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs, we may not</p>
<p>see the aliveness in TikTok, the aliveness in the digital space, that you see it as us</p>
<p>being dragged into this over optimized world, but that may be this is in fact, it is a world</p>
<p>that opens up opportunities to truly experience life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s interesting to think about all the people growing up now, who their early</p>
<p>experience of life is always mediated through a digital device, not always, but more and</p>
<p>more often mediated through that device, and how we&rsquo;re both evolving, the technology is</p>
<p>evolving and the humans are evolving to then maybe open a door to a whole world where the</p>
<p>humans and the technology or AI systems are interacting as equals.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m going to agree with you.</p>
<p>You might be surprised that I&rsquo;m going to agree with you, but I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be the person who&rsquo;s saying our job is to resist all of this stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be a Luddite.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my goal.</p>
<p>The goal is to point out that in the supreme danger lies the saving power.</p>
<p>The point is to get in the right relation to that understanding of what we are.</p>
<p>That allows us to find the joy in it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a hard thing to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to understand even what we&rsquo;re supposed to be doing when we do it.</p>
<p>Maybe I, more than you, am not of the right generation to be able to do that.</p>
<p>But I do think that&rsquo;s got to be the move.</p>
<p>The move is not to resist it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a nostalgic move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an attempt to push people to get in the relation to it that&rsquo;s not the relation of</p>
<p>it controlling you and depriving you of stuff, but of your recognizing some great joy that</p>
<p>can be found in it.</p>
<p>When I interact with legged robots, I see there&rsquo;s magic there.</p>
<p>And I just feel like the person who hears the music when others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to explore that.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s almost like the future talking.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to hear what it&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>Is this a dangerous world or is this a beautiful world?</p>
<p>Well, I can certainly understand your enthusiasm for that.</p>
<p>Those used to be things that I found overwhelmingly exciting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sort of closed off from that anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not now closed off from that even though my views are changed and I don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>in that world.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s interesting to figure out what&rsquo;s at the ground of that response.</p>
<p>We talked about meaning quite a bit throughout in a secular age, but let me ask you the big</p>
<p>ridiculous question, almost too big.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this thing we got going on?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saving the softball for the end, is that it?</p>
<p>Easy one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the meaning of life is.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something that characterizes us that&rsquo;s not the thing that people normally</p>
<p>think characterizes us.</p>
<p>The traditional thing to say and the philosophical tradition, even in the AI tradition, which</p>
<p>is a kind of manifestation of philosophy from Plato forward.</p>
<p>The traditional thing to say is that what characterizes us is our rationality, that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re intelligent beings, that we&rsquo;re the ones that think.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s certainly part of what characterizes us.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s more to it too.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re capable of experiencing simultaneously the complete and utter ungroundedness of everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s meaningful in our existence and also the real significance of it.</p>
<p>And that sounds like a contradiction.</p>
<p>How could it really be significant and not be based on anything?</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s the contradiction that somehow characterizes us.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re the being that sort of has to hold that weird mystery before us</p>
<p>and live in the light of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that I think is really at our core.</p>
<p>And so how do we do that?</p>
<p>I will say this one thing.</p>
<p>And I learned it from a philosopher, from a guy named Albert Borgmann, who&rsquo;s a German</p>
<p>philosopher who lives in Montana now, taught in Montana for his whole career.</p>
<p>And I say this to my students at Harvard now.</p>
<p>He said, this is the way that I think about my life, and I hope you&rsquo;ll think about your</p>
<p>life too.</p>
<p>He said, you should think about your life hoping that there will be many moments in</p>
<p>it about which you can say, there&rsquo;s no place I&rsquo;d rather be, there&rsquo;s no thing I&rsquo;d rather</p>
<p>be doing, there&rsquo;s nobody I&rsquo;d rather be with, and this I will remember well.</p>
<p>And I think if you can aim to fill your life with moments like that, it will be a meaningful</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the meaning of life, but I think if you can hold that before you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll help to clarify this mystery and this sort of bizarre situation in which we find</p>
<p>ourselves.</p>
<p>Sean, this conversation was incredible, and those four requirements have certainly been</p>
<p>fulfilled for me.</p>
<p>This was a magical moment in that way, and I will remember it well.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>This was great.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me, Lex.</p>
<p>I really, really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Kelly.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.</p>
<p>In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
