    <p>So I was not going to bring this up. SAC said, bring it up.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You&rsquo;re already creating mischaracterizations. You</p>
<p>said you want to bring it up. I&rsquo;m like, sure, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not going to veto it.</p>
<p>I said, well, we have to bring up my COVID. Obviously, I&rsquo;m the second bestie to get COVID.</p>
<p>And I told you offline without the other two besties, I will just say I got it out of social</p>
<p>function, period, end of story. You said it&rsquo;s okay to talk about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I wanted to bring it up. You want to bring it up and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>allowing it because I&rsquo;m fine with it. So go for it.</p>
<p>We all got something at SAC&rsquo;s event. You got COVID. I got chlamydia.</p>
<p>Oh, you guys went to the downstairs rooms?</p>
<p>God damn it.</p>
<p>Chamath again. You promised.</p>
<p>It was a great party.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear Jason&rsquo;s accusation. I&rsquo;ve been hearing about it all week in the chat.</p>
<p>It was a great party.</p>
<p>Nah, you&rsquo;ve been saying it was a super spreader of COVID.</p>
<p>Jason, you were angry. You were angry. And you were,</p>
<p>yeah, you were really mad at SAC&rsquo;s because you thought he actually gave you COVID.</p>
<p>Even though SAC&rsquo;s had people test every single person tested on the way in.</p>
<p>Except you, J-Cal. J-Cal, you walked around the velvet room.</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>And you said, guess what? I&rsquo;m a bestie. I don&rsquo;t have to test.</p>
<p>And you walk right in that party.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>One person that flouted the rules got it.</p>
<p>Karma&rsquo;s a bitch, J-Cal.</p>
<p>Nothing better personifies poetic justice as what took place.</p>
<p>I do not place blame on anybody for hosting a super spreader.</p>
<p>All year round, you rant at SAC&rsquo;s. You make fun of him. You poke him.</p>
<p>You poke a bear.</p>
<p>Republican this, Republican that.</p>
<p>It was a Republican super spreader. It was a GOP super spreader.</p>
<p>And then you go to his party and you run around the velvet rope and you don&rsquo;t get your test.</p>
<p>And you go in and you walk out with COVID.</p>
<p>Why should I have to test?</p>
<p>That was amazing.</p>
<p>It was really amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wait on lines. I&rsquo;m a bestie.</p>
<p>I think he walked out with COVID because I think he walked in with COVID.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the only one not to test. So who brought it in?</p>
<p>I did test. My daughter and I came to your wonderful party.</p>
<p>It was amazing. It was delightful.</p>
<p>And we tested.</p>
<p>And no, you didn&rsquo;t. When you got to the party.</p>
<p>I 100% tested. Do not lie.</p>
<p>You told us you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Exactly. You were either lying then or you&rsquo;re lying now.</p>
<p>I 100% tested. You were either lying then or you&rsquo;re lying now.</p>
<p>Which one was it?</p>
<p>I was joking then. I 100% tested with my daughter.</p>
<p>Oh, joking, joking.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t ask Bo.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling the truth.</p>
<p>Bo was on the line testing with me. I had the bracelet. I tested 100%.</p>
<p>When I asked you, when you got into the party and I said,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;d your COVID tests go? You said, Oh, I pulled my bestie card.</p>
<p>I walked around. I pulled my bestie card.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true. That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. That&rsquo;s what you said.</p>
<p>You guys are ganging up on me and making up bullshit now.</p>
<p>No, you said that.</p>
<p>Okay. I may, I may have made a joke, but I 100% tested.</p>
<p>And then, hold on guys. And then I find out the reason why Jade wasn&rsquo;t at the party.</p>
<p>She was home taking care of two sick kids.</p>
<p>No, she wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We had one kid.</p>
<p>So how do we know that it wasn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Okay. We know because Jade told us that she brought it to the party.</p>
<p>I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart.</p>
<p>All right. Here&rsquo;s what happened. I went to the party.</p>
<p>I did test. There was a group of people that got there early,</p>
<p>had tested at another event. They told me this.</p>
<p>They tested before they got there.</p>
<p>And they told me that they had accidentally brought it with them</p>
<p>because they were the first to have a positive test result.</p>
<p>So in all likelihood, it was that group.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who brought it because Omnicron is going everywhere.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Omnicron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a character from Transformers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even understand that. What do you mean they brought it with them?</p>
<p>If they tested negative.</p>
<p>They came from another location. They tested, they claimed they tested.</p>
<p>Then they were the first to come up that next day with a positive result.</p>
<p>It takes longer than 24 hours to incubate.</p>
<p>Right. So that means they must have brought it with them.</p>
<p>They tested on Sunday and had it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying they tested negative at the door.</p>
<p>They did not test at the door, they told me.</p>
<p>They did not test inside the party?</p>
<p>They told me they tested the day before.</p>
<p>No, everybody was tested at the door, including staff, including vendors.</p>
<p>There were people who were turned around because they tested positive.</p>
<p>There was a group of f****** who didn&rsquo;t test.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re trying to blame it on f******?</p>
<p>No, I specifically have tried to not say the person&rsquo;s name and you&rsquo;re trying to include them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get bleeped out. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>They were all negative at the time of the party.</p>
<p>You hosted a super spreader.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t get it till like five days later.</p>
<p>So they were not the earliest to test.</p>
<p>You tested positive.</p>
<p>You had symptoms before they did.</p>
<p>Remember the tickle in the throat?</p>
<p>Guys, remember when he said last week he had the tickle in the throat?</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you for giving me Omicron.</p>
<p>I am now f****** super.</p>
<p>According to all results, I am now Superman.</p>
<p>Have you tested negative now?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>I did a test yesterday.</p>
<p>Nine days later, I&rsquo;m still coming up positive.</p>
<p>I had two days of symptoms.</p>
<p>Not that any of you give a s***, you rat bastards.</p>
<p>You just laugh about my COVID.</p>
<p>Nobody had no point in this conversation.</p>
<p>Did any of you say, how are you feeling?</p>
<p>Was there any chance of death?</p>
<p>Was there any chance?</p>
<p>I was triple vax.</p>
<p>I had done Moderna.</p>
<p>At any point, though, did you feel like,</p>
<p>oh, s***, I may have to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>I may need to go to ventilator.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
<p>I felt the tickle in my throat on Tuesday.</p>
<p>You want to know the symptoms?</p>
<p>He coughed three times.</p>
<p>He sneezed twice.</p>
<p>He prematurely ejaculated once.</p>
<p>Those were his symptoms.</p>
<p>This is going to be our prediction show.</p>
<p>Last week, we did, of course, our 2021 Bestie Awards.</p>
<p>How did everybody feel about last week&rsquo;s awards?</p>
<p>I think it was great.</p>
<p>I listened to the edit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done quite well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was happy.</p>
<p>It was a fun show.</p>
<p>I think we all got to kind of talk about stuff we wanted to talk about.</p>
<p>And it was pretty dynamic.</p>
<p>I thought it was a good show.</p>
<p>I liked it.</p>
<p>It was like a greatest hits.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to do some predictions for next year.</p>
<p>Are you going to do a drum roll and a little scene as well?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an opening.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s got to be like flying into the future,</p>
<p>like going through space, warp speed, warp speed.</p>
<p>Flying through the air, warp wormhole, other side of the universe.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2022.</p>
<p>Biggest political winner, 2022.</p>
<p>What did Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s former writers tell you to say?</p>
<p>Sex.</p>
<p>It never ends.</p>
<p>Sex never ends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never going to end.</p>
<p>People were intrigued about what was the second battle about?</p>
<p>That was the big debate.</p>
<p>Which battle?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the battles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many battles.</p>
<p>About the beep beep.</p>
<p>Which led to me writing the Google Doc about beep beep.</p>
<p>Oh, I know what it was.</p>
<p>Tamath and I deserve a best award for that.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s your biggest political winner?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s stop at the inside baseball.</p>
<p>My biggest political winner for 2022.</p>
<p>I predict my man Ron DeSantis will be the big winner.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s up for reelection in Florida.</p>
<p>He won in 2018 with less than 1% of the vote.</p>
<p>It was a real nail biter.</p>
<p>This time, I think he&rsquo;s going to cruise to reelection quite handily.</p>
<p>And become the national front runner on the GOP side.</p>
<p>And the reason is because he had the right approach on COVID.</p>
<p>He made the vaccine available.</p>
<p>He made the antibodies available.</p>
<p>But ultimately, he treated the population like adults.</p>
<p>He let them make their own decisions.</p>
<p>He kept businesses open, schools open.</p>
<p>And I think the rest of the country is going to come around,</p>
<p>to his point of view, because of the unstoppability of Omicron next year.</p>
<p>And so, I think that DeSantis, who is much maligned and disparaged,</p>
<p>will come out as the big winner a year from now.</p>
<p>All right, who do you got, Freeberg?</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>I think Putin&rsquo;s going to benefit from the rising conflict between the US and China.</p>
<p>The other day, there was a call between Putin and Xi.</p>
<p>And they said, and Putin called Xi his dear friend.</p>
<p>And said that relations between the two countries had reached an unprecedentedly high level.</p>
<p>And I think that his position, economically, as a trade partner with China,</p>
<p>and as a beneficiary of Chinese economic prosperity,</p>
<p>will only grow as tensions between the US and China rise.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re seeing that with some of his cavalier behavior with the Ukraine right now.</p>
<p>And I think Putin will become a stronger player on the global stage,</p>
<p>particularly as it relates to his relationship with NATO over the next year.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been a little bit quiet the last few years.</p>
<p>He was kind of, I&rsquo;d say, suppressed with sanctions and all the other nonsense that&rsquo;s gone on</p>
<p>to keep him at bay.</p>
<p>But he could kind of rise up again in 2022.</p>
<p>And he could become a real player on the geopolitical stage globally,</p>
<p>in a more meaningful way than he has in the last couple years.</p>
<p>I mean, you white guys love Putin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>The whites love Putin.</p>
<p>I love him.</p>
<p>God, I hate Putin.</p>
<p>I mean, if you ranked if you ranked Russia GDP, do you know even do you have any idea</p>
<p>where it even ranks?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s probably you guys, for the amount of time you guys give, it&rsquo;s probably probably</p>
<p>eight.</p>
<p>I mean, Nigeria is like crushes Russia.</p>
<p>Nobody ever talks about Nigeria has all the same inputs, except they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t have 2000 nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>I mean, as a big reason, it&rsquo;s a fallen empire, for sure.</p>
<p>But they still have 2000 nukes.</p>
<p>Yeah, they have the position, the energy that it provides.</p>
<p>Europe, I mean, Russia&rsquo;s geopolitically pretty significant, insignificant, economically</p>
<p>significant, because they have a madman running the country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a madman.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying that, you know, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a lot of ink that spilled about</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anybody even takes a step back and actually looks at who you got for</p>
<p>yours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ranking the world, guys.</p>
<p>My, my worldwide biggest political winner for 2022 is Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>I think this guy is he&rsquo;s firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>And he is basically ascendant.</p>
<p>So 2022 marks the first year where he&rsquo;s essentially really ruler for life.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think we really know what he&rsquo;s capable of and what he&rsquo;s going to do.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just going to play out.</p>
<p>You think he&rsquo;s the biggest political winner, really?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I think it&rsquo;s going to be a he&rsquo;s going to run roughshod, not just domestically,</p>
<p>but also internationally.</p>
<p>Because you have to remember, he controls so much of the critical supply chain that</p>
<p>the Western world needs to be I think you&rsquo;re completely right.</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;re completely wrong.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s losing his power.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s scared.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he took out all these CEOs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s consolidating power because he fears that they&rsquo;re gonna win too big and then displace</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>And he has massive real estate problems over there that could blow up at any moment in</p>
<p>time, he could face a civil war there.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s totally isolated himself.</p>
<p>Civil War, they don&rsquo;t even have a major country is removing their factories.</p>
<p>And what are you talking about?</p>
<p>What do they get a riot with?</p>
<p>Did you not see Tiananmen Square?</p>
<p>Did you not see the riots in Hong Kong?</p>
<p>Are you not paying attention to math?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been many riots in China.</p>
<p>They just happened to kill those were crushed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that he still will have massive amounts of, I believe, protests.</p>
<p>And yeah, he&rsquo;ll have to kill people.</p>
<p>I think the bigger risk is that China gets better for Xi Jinping, but worse for everybody</p>
<p>else in China.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already worse for all the billionaires over there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse for the tech industry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now got Evergrande, that whole, you know, gigantic debt implosion.</p>
<p>I think there could be contagion from China next year.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Xi&rsquo;s gonna lose his grip in any way.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure China&rsquo;s gonna have a good year next year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be terrible.</p>
<p>I went with Ron DeSantis with USACs.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s obviously a much more, he&rsquo;s a much more palatable</p>
<p>candidate than Trump.</p>
<p>And I think Trump is not going to want to run.</p>
<p>And that brings me to my biggest political loser for 2022.</p>
<p>As we segue, I believe this is going to be split between Biden and Trump, the two most</p>
<p>important people of the last four years.</p>
<p>And I think Biden is going to lose the midterms.</p>
<p>And I think Trump is going to get destroyed with this January 6 thing and bow out and</p>
<p>not run again.</p>
<p>Who do you got for your biggest loser?</p>
<p>Let me add an octogenarian to that, which is my pick for biggest political loser next</p>
<p>year is Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a red wave coming.</p>
<p>The Democrats for sure are going to lose the house that is baked into the cake.</p>
<p>And I predict she will announce her retirement shortly after that.</p>
<p>She has served, you know, a couple of pretty consequential terms as Speaker.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s never lost a vote.</p>
<p>But with this whole build back better, she forced all of her moderates to take a vote</p>
<p>on 5 trillion in new spending, which they then lost in the Senate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to cost them some seats.</p>
<p>So she contributed to, I think, her own downfall.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen next year?</p>
<p>Is Nancy going to come work at social capital and you&rsquo;re going to give her a bucket of capital</p>
<p>to come out to work with to try to play the market?</p>
<p>By the way, Jason, who&rsquo;s the excellent writer you got from Tucker?</p>
<p>Because I want to hire them.</p>
<p>I listen, I got somebody from the YouTube comments who said they would they would punch</p>
<p>me up.</p>
<p>All right, I got Biden and Trump, Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>And then who do you got?</p>
<p>Freeberg, who&rsquo;s your biggest political loser of 2022 prediction?</p>
<p>Mine&rsquo;s a little depressing, but I&rsquo;m honestly a little bit worried about the United States</p>
<p>influence on kind of a global stage, socially, politically, economically.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a number of events that could catalyze kind of a precipitous</p>
<p>series of events that could really harm the continuing influence the US has geopolitically.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t really have an individual, but I kind of have the US and its role on</p>
<p>the global geopolitical stage.</p>
<p>US influence.</p>
<p>US influence, yeah.</p>
<p>And you said you thought there was going to be this potential tipping point, perhaps,</p>
<p>you see that being Taiwan or what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple of them.</p>
<p>I think when we get into our contrarian points of view, I&rsquo;ll share some of them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Chamath, who do you got for your biggest political loser for 2022 prediction?</p>
<p>Well, look, I, I like your pick of Trump, which is not mine, but just to double down</p>
<p>on this Trump thing, it&rsquo;s incredible to see that he&rsquo;s just a bamboozler.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the same guy who&rsquo;s like, you know, telling people to not take the vaccine</p>
<p>gets boosted.</p>
<p>Then, you know, when he finally gets outed with this other scumbag.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that guy&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that other right?</p>
<p>Knob.</p>
<p>Sax, take out your phone and go to speed dial.</p>
<p>Just read it.</p>
<p>Riley, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s number four to speed dial.</p>
<p>Those two dopes on stage are like, yeah, I got boosted.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got triple faxed in.</p>
<p>And then everybody&rsquo;s booing them.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re just such</p>
<p>Watch what they do, not what they say.</p>
<p>These guys are entertainers.</p>
<p>The great thing is they are phenomenal entertainers, but you can&rsquo;t trust a single</p>
<p>word that they say.</p>
<p>So Jason, I think that that&rsquo;s a pretty good pick.</p>
<p>My pick is the progressive left as a class, because I think these guys are being exposed</p>
<p>basically for just being laughingstocks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re quickly becoming policy jokes inside of Washington and in every city state that they run.</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t seem to put one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been run amok with folks like these teachers unions who have really, really,</p>
<p>really done a number on our children, which is now finally getting exposed in the mainstream</p>
<p>media.</p>
<p>And so all of these policies are just they&rsquo;re not rooted in any sort of science or legitimacy.</p>
<p>So they are, I think, going to pay a pretty heavy political price for mainstream voters</p>
<p>in 22.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>They remind me of those two guys, like the old guys from the Muppets, Stadler and Waldorf.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what like those Trump and O&rsquo;Reilly are.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think Biden can still save save a lot of his long term reputation.</p>
<p>I think Trump&rsquo;s is what would buy didn&rsquo;t need to do in 2022 number one center.</p>
<p>He needs to disavow the progressives and basically shore up his party&rsquo;s ability to</p>
<p>win back some seats and hold the line.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re not going to be able to enter some of these places with some of this rhetoric</p>
<p>that, you know, he basically was convinced would be necessary for him to not lose the</p>
<p>progressive left.</p>
<p>There just needs to be a conversation inside the White House where they actually go through</p>
<p>the cold political calculus of, you know, my enemies, enemies, but actually my friend</p>
<p>kind of thing and actually go back to the center.</p>
<p>Yeah, he needs to pull a Bill Clinton and trying to pull a booklin.</p>
<p>Okay, and quickly too.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s way too early to conclude that the Biden presidency is over.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I think they&rsquo;re going to lose Congress next year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s baked into the cake.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s still got two years after that to pull his chest outside of the fire.</p>
<p>And if the republicans overplay their hand, and he taxed towards the center, you know,</p>
<p>he can change his fortunes.</p>
<p>He can change his fortunes quickly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s down a pawn, but he could develop the board.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I think the voice of populism is only going to swell over the next year.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be the predominant force that&rsquo;s going to drive both the alt right</p>
<p>and the progressive left.</p>
<p>And you know, you could make the case that, you know, politicians that are in seats should</p>
<p>be kind of disavowing these what we today are calling kind of extreme voices, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only getting louder.</p>
<p>And the importance of kind of populist movements, not just in the US, but you look around the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>I mean, look at what&rsquo;s happening in Brazil, various European countries.</p>
<p>I mean, it is you think populism is going to have a rebound in 2022.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all saying that we think it&rsquo;s fizzling.</p>
<p>Well, I can I just say freebird populism swelling, and I think it&rsquo;s going to get louder</p>
<p>and okay, low interest, low interest rates are simply keeping things at bay for now.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s going to shift very quickly.</p>
<p>But freebird populism just means what&rsquo;s popular.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a huge silent majority that&rsquo;s always stayed on the sidelines, because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not the ones that are tend to tend to have a tendency to complain.</p>
<p>But when things get important enough, they typically show up.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we may find that actually centrism is what&rsquo;s most popular.</p>
<p>I think populism is anti elitism.</p>
<p>And I think that there is a growing concern globally, because of globalization, that power</p>
<p>and capital has been concentrated in the hands of a few, that the voice of the majority is</p>
<p>we want to be shared, we want that to all be shared equally.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving populism around the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in the US, you know, manifesting in different ways on the left and the right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see this in other countries around the world.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see the fundamental driving forces changing there until and unless we have massive</p>
<p>taxation and redistribute wealth in a meaningful way, or some massive shift in government,</p>
<p>that that voice is going to get any quieter, I think it&rsquo;s only gonna get louder.</p>
<p>And there may be perturbations between here and there of like what it looks like,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be going away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s just to me kind of the underlying driving force.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s manifesting with different political stuff right now.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be silencing.</p>
<p>Biggest business winner for 2022.</p>
<p>Chamath, let&rsquo;s start with you.</p>
<p>Small businesses.</p>
<p>I think what we are starting to see is that these monolithic, monopolistic megacorps</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t everything that they&rsquo;re cracked up to be.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s going to be a certain amount of lock in that we will tolerate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of taxation and policy that prevents its further growth.</p>
<p>And all of that opportunity accrues to smaller companies.</p>
<p>And so in general, I think that if you were on the side of the David versus these Goliaths</p>
<p>over the next year, you&rsquo;re going to have or frankly, over the next several decades,</p>
<p>but starting really next year, you&rsquo;re going to do really well.</p>
<p>And the middle companies, so the folks that are neither huge nor are small, let&rsquo;s take a</p>
<p>an example, like a Shopify $100 billion market cap, but by no means is it a trillion dollar</p>
<p>market cap.</p>
<p>Their success comes from enabling, you know, arming the rebels.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m a huge fan of these enabling this enabling layer for small businesses,</p>
<p>both offline and online.</p>
<p>Who do you got?</p>
<p>Freeberg.</p>
<p>I am actually going to go with Stripe.</p>
<p>Stripe is a payment technology company based in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Stripe raised money earlier this year to $95 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The highest valued IPO tech IPO in history was Alibaba,</p>
<p>they were valued at $230 billion when they went public.</p>
<p>We are hearing rumors that Stripe might, you know, kind of,</p>
<p>or think that they have bankers think that they might be able to break that.</p>
<p>And so Stripe&rsquo;s IPO could be the biggest tech IPO ever.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve been talking about doing a direct listing.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t know the guys.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the investors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an investor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any information whatsoever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply an observer and talk to people in the market.</p>
<p>But it sounds like they&rsquo;re going for direct listing.</p>
<p>And we could see that become the highest valuation tech IPO ever.</p>
<p>And then they will become kind of the golden child next year.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of be part of the, you know, the top of the top.</p>
<p>What do you got?</p>
<p>Sax.</p>
<p>I got rise of the rest, meaning the parts of the United States that are not the traditional</p>
<p>California and New York centers of industry and wealth.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a trend that&rsquo;s been going on, but it&rsquo;s going to keep getting bigger next year.</p>
<p>If you guys saw the net migration numbers by state, they&rsquo;re absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>Stunning.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the zero tax states that are just booming right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s states like Florida and Texas and Tennessee and on and on it goes at the</p>
<p>huge expense of California and New York.</p>
<p>I think that trend&rsquo;s only going to pick up steam now that salt is dead.</p>
<p>I think there was a hope on the part of many people that Trump got rid of salt,</p>
<p>but, and then the Democrats were supposed to bring it back.</p>
<p>And then AOC rejected it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not coming back.</p>
<p>And what that means is that if you&rsquo;re in safe California, for example, you know,</p>
<p>with the salt deduction, your effective tax rate was around 8%, not 13.3%.</p>
<p>Now it really is 13.3%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge increase.</p>
<p>And the politicians in California don&rsquo;t even realize that the tax rate has effectively gone</p>
<p>up to the end taxpayer.</p>
<p>And, uh, and, and the quality of life isn&rsquo;t any better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not getting anything more for that.</p>
<p>And so I think this X is going to continue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s the subtle math that they actually really need to understand</p>
<p>that 500 basis points.</p>
<p>You can overcome that.</p>
<p>If your life is 5% better in enough ways where you&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And the reason why people are leaving is they feel that their life is actually</p>
<p>much less than 5% worse, right?</p>
<p>The quality of life doesn&rsquo;t justify it.</p>
<p>You know, your, your windows are getting smashed in all the time.</p>
<p>Safety kids are, you know, depressed and need counseling because of the way that the teachers</p>
<p>unions locked them out of school.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like, forget this.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do this anymore.</p>
<p>I got to add those two numbers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, that&rsquo;s what people really need to appreciate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the actual effective tax rate, but it&rsquo;s the Delta of how poor your</p>
<p>quality of life has gotten over these last few years relative to the tax you pay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I totally agree with that.</p>
<p>And then one other effect that I think plays into this is the reshoring of American industry,</p>
<p>which is not happening in places like California, New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening in places like Texas.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Samsung just announced a $17 billion investment in a new chip foundry in Texas.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ll post this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of things like this happening.</p>
<p>So as we decouple from China and bring our supply chain home,</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>That is going to be a big factor in the rise of the rest.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for America because the wealth does need to be more evenly distributed</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t just go to tech and finance elites in California, New York.</p>
<p>All right, I had two.</p>
<p>Disney was my biggest corporate winner for 2022.</p>
<p>Disney Plus crushing it.</p>
<p>Parks raised prices.</p>
<p>People want to go to the park.</p>
<p>Spider-Man just had, I think, the number two or number three all-time</p>
<p>opening in a pandemic, which is crazy.</p>
<p>That IP is going to continue to work for them.</p>
<p>Jon Favreau and David Fiolini, I think is how you pronounce his last name,</p>
<p>both crushing it with Mandalorian Boba Fett, one of the great characters from our childhood</p>
<p>now is going to have his own book of Boba Fett starting on December 29.</p>
<p>Is that today or tomorrow?</p>
<p>Tomorrow.</p>
<p>And so I think Disney is going to have a huge surge.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re undervalued.</p>
<p>But my number one for this category of biggest business winner for 2022 was Millennials and</p>
<p>Gen Z.</p>
<p>I think that they became completely empowered and independent.</p>
<p>They shook off the participation trophies and their entitlement during COVID.</p>
<p>They realized that they have skills that are valuable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sought after.</p>
<p>They learned how to make money.</p>
<p>They traded crypto.</p>
<p>They did stock trading.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing shorts, puts, whatever, on Robin Hood.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just not impressed with people in power.</p>
<p>And they increasingly want to build shit and make money.</p>
<p>I think that those two generations have woken up.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re going to be the biggest winners in 2022.</p>
<p>Because dovetailing with your SMBs, Chamath, I do think, and I&rsquo;m seeing it across my entire</p>
<p>portfolio of companies.</p>
<p>You try to hire somebody, and they&rsquo;re like, yeah, but maybe I can just start my own company.</p>
<p>You and me and Saks are actually saying a flavor of the same thing, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because all these SMBs aren&rsquo;t going to happen in New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re happening all over America.</p>
<p>And there are people that are taking empowerment into their own hands.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tooling for them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s opportunity, economic opportunity, for them to build businesses on their own.</p>
<p>And basically just say, you know, F you to corporate America.</p>
<p>And nothing will build your confidence to dovetail with you, Saks.</p>
<p>Nothing builds your confidence, like moving from one city to another,</p>
<p>and having, that&rsquo;s a very empowering thing to do when you&rsquo;re just like, you know what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just leave and go somewhere else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make it myself.</p>
<p>So I feel like they are super impressive to me.</p>
<p>I really believe in that.</p>
<p>I really believe in this, because the three of us got there in totally different ways.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s roughly all the same.</p>
<p>We might be triangulating around a trend here.</p>
<p>Biggest business loser for 2022.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give it real quick.</p>
<p>I think crypto projects that actually don&rsquo;t deliver a product in 2022 are just going to be</p>
<p>a loss.</p>
<p>I think this idea that people are going to bet on things that don&rsquo;t exist in the real world,</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t actually have applications is going to end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for crypto to put up or shut up.</p>
<p>And I think the crypto projects that do that, which a number of them are starting to are</p>
<p>going to store, but it&rsquo;s going to be a big shake out there.</p>
<p>What do you got for biggest business loser in 2022?</p>
<p>Freeberg?</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>Actually, that was mine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>I said crypto bubble will burst.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of scammy nonsense going on.</p>
<p>90% of these projects.</p>
<p>You know, are not going to yield value and fundamentals.</p>
<p>And I also think that rising interest rates are going to affect the crypto market.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of leveraged trades into the crypto assets.</p>
<p>Those will start to de-lever as these interest rates shift up.</p>
<p>And as a whole, you&rsquo;ll see a large percentage of them go away or decline in value,</p>
<p>but a small number will continue to grow in value.</p>
<p>Just like we saw when the dot com bubble blew up.</p>
<p>There was a number of companies that survived.</p>
<p>Most of them did not.</p>
<p>And the few that did survive ended up being coming worth 10 times what the current market</p>
<p>value is.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s still possible with these crypto projects.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say 90% of them are probably going to start to blow up next year.</p>
<p>What do you got, Shabath?</p>
<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;m fading you guys.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also fading implicitly Freeberg&rsquo;s pick of Stripe.</p>
<p>But my biggest business loser for 2022 is Visa and MasterCard and traditional payment</p>
<p>rails and the entire ecosystem around it.</p>
<p>So I think that this is the year you can put on what probably will be the most profitable</p>
<p>spread trade of my lifetime, which is to be short these companies and that anybody that</p>
<p>basically lives off of this two or 3% tax and be long, well thought out web three crypto</p>
<p>projects that are rebuilding payments infrastructure in a completely decentralized way.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that what you say won&rsquo;t also happen, both that Stripe</p>
<p>will have an incredible IPO and that a lot of these scammy crypto projects will go to</p>
<p>zero.</p>
<p>However, if you read the white papers of these crypto projects, and you systematically put</p>
<p>together a framework, I think you can be long those and you can be short Visa MasterCard</p>
<p>because I think this is their peak market cap.</p>
<p>And for those of you don&rsquo;t know, fading and sports betting taking the opposite side of</p>
<p>a bet, taking the opposite team, I guess,</p>
<p>man visas market cap is half a trillion dollars, huh?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely contrived duopoly that doesn&rsquo;t mean to a young person.</p>
<p>And MasterCard is almost 400 billion.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re trillion dollar combined market.</p>
<p>By the way, you have to understand that the canary in the coal mine here is pretty significant.</p>
<p>The most important thing is Amazon.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Nick, maybe you can post this decided to just shut Visa off in the</p>
<p>UK.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, Amazon is not going to do something like that, in my opinion, unless it&rsquo;s a test.</p>
<p>Of what they can do all around the world.</p>
<p>And again, going back to this idea of arming the rebels, there really is no need today</p>
<p>for all of these small businesses to sit on top of Visa, MasterCard and Amex rails, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unnecessary.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;ll probably get developed in the developing world first.</p>
<p>This is why I think, you know, focusing in markets like Nigeria, to me are way more exciting</p>
<p>than talking about, right, you know, these fading Western European countries, who cares,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>This is where this stuff will happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say that those are those other companies can&rsquo;t, you know, trundle along for</p>
<p>a while.</p>
<p>But when I say, you know, we&rsquo;ll look back in 10 years, and their market caps will be</p>
<p>materially lower.</p>
<p>Anybody in those traditional infrastructure and rails, versus anybody in this new infrastructure</p>
<p>and rails will be it will look like a no brainer.</p>
<p>Do you consider the buy now pay later companies like a firm and upstart or whatever?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if upstart fits in that category.</p>
<p>But some of these buy now pay later businesses as being the alternative to the traditional</p>
<p>payment networks?</p>
<p>Or do you think it&rsquo;s a different business?</p>
<p>No, I right now, I think what what buy now pay later is, is is a rate arbitrage, right?</p>
<p>When, as you said earlier, rates are very, very low.</p>
<p>So the cost of capital is low.</p>
<p>But it again starts to habituate the consumer experience to, I don&rsquo;t need to pay these users</p>
<p>rates to these three credit card companies to facilitate a transaction of money that</p>
<p>I already have or money that I&rsquo;m good for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big idea, right.</p>
<p>And so when you translate that into web three in a good project, or a good series of projects,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to need these companies.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s going to, I think, eviscerate trillions of dollars of market.</p>
<p>Well, not to mention, you also have in between these two Venmo and cash app, which are not</p>
<p>crypto, but they certainly as brands mean more to young people, and MasterCard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think block used to be called square is a good pair trade against Visa MasterCard</p>
<p>in this context?</p>
<p>Yeah, I like it.</p>
<p>You know, I think that that that starts to get closer to to the truth.</p>
<p>My perspective is, you can kind of short anybody who&rsquo;s public, because anybody who&rsquo;s public</p>
<p>can really only be public, or will go public, because they feast off of this artificial</p>
<p>two or 3% transaction fee.</p>
<p>Everybody does.</p>
<p>The companies you want to be long are those private companies in crypto that you can read</p>
<p>the white papers of, whose protocols have utility, and who&rsquo;s building some element of</p>
<p>infrastructure that replaces a traditional business.</p>
<p>So as long as you can kind of build those things up, apology, for example, had a bunch</p>
<p>of tweets this weekend where he was like, you know, I he has this idea for a mirror</p>
<p>table.</p>
<p>What is that that replaces, you know, cap table management?</p>
<p>Right now?</p>
<p>Why is that important?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because it touches all of these really important KYC AML investing laws across</p>
<p>all these countries in all of these places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a very simple example of where the new company that actually builds that capability</p>
<p>of these mirror tables will do so at virtually no cost.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;ll have a 50 person team.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not going to have offices all over the world, their cost basis will be,</p>
<p>you know, an order order or two orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Visa MasterCard became a tax.</p>
<p>It took decades and decades to have that power over folks.</p>
<p>But I think a firm does break that a firm breaks it because the people who are selling</p>
<p>then decide, you know what, we&rsquo;ll give a little bit of a discount here to get more people to buy.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>They were the classic network monopoly network effect monopoly business, right?</p>
<p>Like they got the small businesses, they got the credit cards, and by extension, the consumers</p>
<p>on the network.</p>
<p>And ultimately, they created these, these absolutely locked in networks.</p>
<p>But as with all networks, complacency kind of, you know, drives innovation.</p>
<p>And this field innovation that we&rsquo;re seeing is now starting to figure out ways to not just</p>
<p>crack their way into the network, but to replace them with an entirely different model.</p>
<p>Last point on this.</p>
<p>This is not one where I think this disruption happens slow.</p>
<p>I think it happens swiftly.</p>
<p>Swiftly being five to 10 years.</p>
<p>No, like in a year.</p>
<p>Yeah, to my point is really interesting, because there&rsquo;s, you know, there are several billion</p>
<p>people globally who do not have credit and who are unbanked.</p>
<p>And so if you think about where this is more likely to come from, it&rsquo;s more likely to come</p>
<p>from an innovative model in those markets that then ultimately finds its way into the</p>
<p>developed world.</p>
<p>Versus, you know, trying to break apart Visa and MasterCard and go get these small businesses</p>
<p>to switch out of them and so on today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, Saks, what do you got?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s biggest loser, but the thing I&rsquo;m most worried about is in 2022, the</p>
<p>Fed is going to stop quantitative easing or so they have said they are.</p>
<p>I guess March will be the last month in which they do this QE.</p>
<p>So starting in April, there won&rsquo;t be any of this liquidity pumped into the system.</p>
<p>And so I think the losers are going to be any of these asset classes that are heavily</p>
<p>dependent on or have benefited from all this excess liquidity sloshing through the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that the stock market, I think, has already priced in rate increases and an</p>
<p>increase in the discount rate.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if markets can fully price in a reduction in liquidity.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly what that&rsquo;s going to look like.</p>
<p>And so if liquidity is reduced next year, I think that could reverberate through a bunch</p>
<p>of markets, including everything from sports cards and collectibles, which have gone through</p>
<p>the roof, to art, to crypto, to, you know, maybe some growth stocks and on and on it</p>
<p>goes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my biggest worry is what happens when the Fed stops QE.</p>
<p>The biggest loser is markets because of quantitative easing.</p>
<p>The markets that have to get off drugs, basically.</p>
<p>Okay, most contrarian belief.</p>
<p>Sach, why don&rsquo;t you tell us your most contrarian belief, since I&rsquo;m sure that you workshop this</p>
<p>with the contrarian Peter Thiel himself.</p>
<p>It never ends.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so I have a couple of them here, actually.</p>
<p>You want to wait and go after everybody else?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if this is contrarian or just unconventional.</p>
<p>But I think that all of this pressure in on the progressive left will manifest in the</p>
<p>chosen one, AOC, deciding to step up and run against Schumer in the primary in June of</p>
<p>2022.</p>
<p>And she will lose.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good prediction.</p>
<p>I like Chamath&rsquo;s prediction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bold one.</p>
<p>Yeah, that she would lose is bold.</p>
<p>Well, sorry, just to give a little bit of color in this, like, let&rsquo;s just assume that</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, you know, she shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s think about where she&rsquo;s sitting.</p>
<p>Build back better is over.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an enormous amount of stuff happening right now where, you know, it looks like the</p>
<p>progressive left is really going to be put under pressure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost as if if she&rsquo;s really going to be the standard bearer, and she needs to</p>
<p>do something quickly.</p>
<p>Otherwise, she&rsquo;s going to have to wait until she&rsquo;s 38.</p>
<p>You know, she&rsquo;s, you know, another six years from now, because it&rsquo;s not unlikely that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to run against Kirsten, you know, Kirsten Gillibrand.</p>
<p>So this is kind of like it may be a moment where out of her sheer frustration, she steps</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>And then we will see whether Freeburg is right or I&rsquo;m right, whether the populism is really</p>
<p>around the left or the populism is really around the silent majority.</p>
<p>Where do you got sex?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very good prediction.</p>
<p>In a similar way, I predict that there will be a strange new respect for Bill Clinton</p>
<p>in the Democratic Party by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because after the red wave, there&rsquo;ll be a recognition that they need to move towards</p>
<p>the center, they need to triangulate.</p>
<p>And and Clinton was the one who provided the formula for doing this.</p>
<p>He dragged the Democratic Party back to the center after they were losing elections.</p>
<p>And the other piece of this is going to be that it&rsquo;s already the case in polling that</p>
<p>Hispanics and Asian Americans now are swing voters.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re going to see in November 2022, that they go for Republicans in big</p>
<p>numbers.</p>
<p>And so the idea that the Democratic Party can just coast to election based on demographics,</p>
<p>I think that theory is going to be imperiled.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like it.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re going to be looking to Clinton and maybe not so much Obama, as the as sort</p>
<p>of the predicate they should be, you know, aspiring to in the future.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s important about that is those groups of people, I think are offended by</p>
<p>the free money, get something for nothing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hardworking immigrant people who have pride, they don&rsquo;t want handouts.</p>
<p>And then you have this left white liberal maniac saying, No, no, you&rsquo;re poor, you need</p>
<p>handouts, you don&rsquo;t, you shouldn&rsquo;t work, you need handouts, you&rsquo;re, you know, and I just</p>
<p>think they don&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think they&rsquo;re going to go to the Republicans, because Republicans are</p>
<p>hardworking and freedom loving.</p>
<p>And what was Clinton&rsquo;s big tagline in his campaign, he said that he supports people</p>
<p>who work hard and play by the rules.</p>
<p>That was that.</p>
<p>So great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the message the Democrats got to refine right now, they seem to be on the side of</p>
<p>basically, drug addicts.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, people who junkies are contributing nothing and pitching tents in the middle of</p>
<p>public spaces and, you know, participating in open air drug markets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you got?</p>
<p>And sore losers.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget sore losers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And hysterical, freebird and hysterical people.</p>
<p>I mean, being hysterical, just never good.</p>
<p>Look, if you&rsquo;ll bear with me, I have, I have three, but I couldn&rsquo;t really pick.</p>
<p>So the first one is, I think, and I shared this on the pod the other day, I think we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see the start of great global conflict.</p>
<p>We often rationalize the series of events that that catalyze conflict after the fact,</p>
<p>rather than recognizing that there was emotional conditioning that allowed it to arise in the</p>
<p>first place.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in a state today, where the conditioning is such that we&rsquo;re more inclined</p>
<p>to engage in conflict globally than we have been in a very long time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s kind of the conflict meter or what have you.</p>
<p>But you know, you could see proxy wars and proxy conflict that arise sort of like what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing, you know, maybe something in the Ukraine, maybe something related to Taiwan.</p>
<p>But this is primarily predicated by the fact that we&rsquo;ve got kind of this inflationary</p>
<p>environment and the rise of populism will force the kind of domestic policymakers and</p>
<p>legislators to say we should do something that&rsquo;s active and something that will allow</p>
<p>us to unite our nations to go and get into a conflict somewhere, or more likely to do</p>
<p>that than not.</p>
<p>And so I would say that the conditioning is there to see something like that happen.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re not kind of thinking, hey, next year is going to be a year of war.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s contrary.</p>
<p>And I think that there may be war that we&rsquo;re not kind of paying attention to today, or</p>
<p>that will surprise us after the fact.</p>
<p>The second thing is, I&rsquo;d say China may solidify its position next year.</p>
<p>And this is going to sound a little crazy as a leader in climate change mitigation,</p>
<p>whereas it&rsquo;s historically been considered kind of the primary foe against climate change.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a couple of behaviors we&rsquo;ve seen come out of China recently that I think number</p>
<p>one, remember, China is a very rational actor.</p>
<p>They do analysis, they make decisions based on long term investments and thinking.</p>
<p>They recently announced that they&rsquo;re going to build 150 new nuclear reactors over the</p>
<p>next 15 years at a cost of roughly $450 billion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about $3 billion per nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>The US is currently spending $30 billion building two power plants in Georgia.</p>
<p>So the Chinese have figured it out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also publicly declared that they&rsquo;re going to be completely carbon neutral with</p>
<p>their economy by the year 2060.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re making the investments through these nuclear power plants to demonstrate</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actually on the road to do that.</p>
<p>And there are a number of other infrastructure initiatives that are meant to help them achieve</p>
<p>significant reductions in carbon by 2040.</p>
<p>So let me just point out why this is important.</p>
<p>Because right now, everyone thinks China is the foe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re causing climate change.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Imagine if over the next year, some of what they&rsquo;re doing pays off, and everyone says,</p>
<p>my gosh, China is leading the world in climate change mitigation, their influence socially</p>
<p>and politically will rise.</p>
<p>And this gives China a very strong kind of position, you know, on a global stage and</p>
<p>with kind of people around the world thinking, instead of China being a foe, maybe they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the leader and the US is the laggard.</p>
<p>And that creates a&hellip;</p>
<p>My third is very random, which is some sort of natural catastrophe.</p>
<p>We never account&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, all natural catastrophes are very low probability, but very high severity.</p>
<p>If you multiply the probability by the severity, you have what&rsquo;s called the expected loss.</p>
<p>We always undervalue the expected loss of massive catastrophes, natural catastrophes.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had one in a while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very low probability bet for me to say, hey, maybe we will.</p>
<p>But if we do, it&rsquo;s certainly underappreciated in markets today.</p>
<p>And so when these kind of, you know, black swan type events occur&hellip;</p>
<p>Did you, did you watch Don&rsquo;t Look Up on Netflix?</p>
<p>Is that why you&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new movie about a&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crap.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t watch it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s polarizing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s leave it out for now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll watch it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crap.</p>
<p>My most contrarian belief is, I think this is contrarian, is that American influence</p>
<p>and exceptionalism is going to soar.</p>
<p>Oh, that is contrarian.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve empowered this next generation, as I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Millennials, Gen Z, are ready to be independent, to build shit.</p>
<p>And I think Gen X is going to start taking over from boomers, as is what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in this very podcast here as we start to hit our prime years as executives.</p>
<p>And then all these boomers are retiring, as Chamath has pointed out over and over again,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to pass down their wealth, which then creates a perfect storm of a ton</p>
<p>of capital, a ton of energy, lots of new ideas, a different perspective, and the economy is</p>
<p>going to boom.</p>
<p>And we will prove once again that we&rsquo;re the greatest country and economy in the world.</p>
<p>Jekyll, you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not a contrarian.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re what we call an optimist.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll add to that.</p>
<p>Jekyll, what are we?</p>
<p>Are we Gen X?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re Gen X.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the fighting over COVID, abortion, guns, social justice, and all this stuff is so</p>
<p>exhausting, not that these are not important issues, that I think everybody is going to</p>
<p>move to, let&rsquo;s just start respecting and building and solving problems.</p>
<p>And I just think American exceptionalism will be</p>
<p>all that happens in 2022.</p>
<p>I just think that that is my contrarian belief for 2022.</p>
<p>Everybody believes it&rsquo;s a primary race.</p>
<p>I think everybody believes it&rsquo;s coming apart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anything&rsquo;s coming apart.</p>
<p>The whole arc of the next century in a year.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be a great year.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be a great year.</p>
<p>Can I give my second contrarian prediction?</p>
<p>Oh, God, here we go.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>I think the media is going to pull a total 180 on COVID.</p>
<p>After pumping out COVID fear porn for two years, they&rsquo;re going to change their tune next year.</p>
<p>Some of the things you&rsquo;re going to hear, we need to live with COVID.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be eradicated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re even going to say it&rsquo;s more like a cold or a flu.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to say that politicians can&rsquo;t be expected to stop it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to memory hole their support for lockdowns.</p>
<p>We never supported that.</p>
<p>And why is all of this?</p>
<p>Because we have an election next year, and more Americans have already died from COVID</p>
<p>under Joe Biden than Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty amazing memory hold.</p>
<p>What was your term?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never heard of the term memory hole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what the memory memory hole.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But did you guys know that that more Americans have already died from COVID under Joe Biden?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s stunning.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is stunning.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>100% now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s writers triple fact checked it.</p>
<p>Yeah, they did.</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>No, look, look it up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly it&rsquo;s going to be even more true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the info worse.com.</p>
<p>You can look it up.</p>
<p>Omicron wave.</p>
<p>No, look, I don&rsquo;t blame Joe Biden for that.</p>
<p>Sorry, wait, why is that?</p>
<p>Because Trump had no vaccine and Biden has had vaccines and everything else.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s the consistency of I mean, you guys seem to have a consistent, you know,</p>
<p>one to 2000 people die a day, 1400 a day.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s just that consistency in the US.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s because of the Republican states that refuse to do any mitigation.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t blame Biden for that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame any president United States.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Biden campaigned on the idea of he&rsquo;s quote, unquote, shutting down the virus.</p>
<p>He and the Democrats claim that they would be able to eradicate it.</p>
<p>That was the entire basis for all these COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s the case that it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s realizing that they&rsquo;re going to have to move the goalposts and memory hole</p>
<p>ever saying that.</p>
<p>And so the Democrats desperately need COVID to be over for the 2022 midterms.</p>
<p>Therefore, the media will say it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Well, you started to see it already, because the media is probably scratching their head.</p>
<p>They were the ones trying to force these lockdowns, you know, basking in the glow of whatever press</p>
<p>release the Centers for Disease Control would put out.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, the CDC just had to do a complete 180.</p>
<p>And when they used to force 10 day quarantines for these positive tests and people with COVID,</p>
<p>they just backtracked to five.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s nobody to work.</p>
<p>And Delta CEO asked for it last week.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s exactly true.</p>
<p>But the CDC ultimately really is just in the hands of big business.</p>
<p>And so when big business needs these workers to come back, you know, they and it probably</p>
<p>pissed off a lot of unions who would have loved to have just had a positive test and stay home</p>
<p>forever, the teachers unions, particularly, here we are.</p>
<p>So this is a really tough situation.</p>
<p>Well, and look, and to be clear, the message that the media is going to deliver about COVID</p>
<p>next year, it&rsquo;ll be the first time I agree with it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s completely dishonest of them to pretend like they were never in favor of lockdowns,</p>
<p>and they completely inflated the threat and created this whole hysteria.</p>
<p>And next year, they&rsquo;re gonna have to back off.</p>
<p>But also take into account sacks, that this new variant is much less deadly.</p>
<p>So it would be logical for people to take a less severe position on it.</p>
<p>Hold on, Jason.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether there are more variants to come in the future.</p>
<p>That could be much worse.</p>
<p>But we also don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s not as deadly, and it&rsquo;s a blocker.</p>
<p>The CDC made the decision, broadly speaking, about everything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not making a decision about Omicron.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t say if you have Omicron, because not as if they really even test for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking you can say for the reason they shortened this is because they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what they were doing before.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t fundamentally know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re making best guesses.</p>
<p>And the problem with these best guesses is that they&rsquo;re inaccurate.</p>
<p>And it forces enormous amounts of waves of havoc.</p>
<p>Every time they make a decision, I&rsquo;m talking about I&rsquo;m talking about sexist prediction</p>
<p>that the media will flip a logical person, including everybody on this call, because</p>
<p>of Omicron taking over for Delta and being a natural blocker, it would be the logical</p>
<p>thing to do.</p>
<p>So in defense of the media, which I&rsquo;m not apt to do, it&rsquo;s logical for everybody to take</p>
<p>a different approach right now, because Omicron is 40 times more contagious, it blocks Delta,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s become the dominant variant.</p>
<p>I think the right now the media is confused.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not sure which way to go.</p>
<p>So you know, there&rsquo;s a high probability that they tacked towards what sacks is saying.</p>
<p>But if you read the New York Times article, it was through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>They presented the fact that the CDC changed the guide.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If you read that article, it was like pulling teeth.</p>
<p>The media media can just define that a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everybody about Fox News.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the elite prestige media.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, on and on and on.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a bigger audience with the aggregate of those publications you just</p>
<p>mentioned, or the direct to the consumer publications that are happening on YouTube?</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re being disaggregated because of their dishonesty.</p>
<p>So does it matter?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, it still matters, because they still have a lot of influence.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>And no offense to everybody on YouTube.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t gotten yet to the economic viability where enough people on YouTube can</p>
<p>cover the broad spectrum of things that are important.</p>
<p>And then the mechanisms and incentives to amplify it.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>We still need CNN.</p>
<p>There was a woman on CNN, Nick, please post the clip that you could we posted in the group</p>
<p>chat, talking about the incidence of suicide rates and depression in our children.</p>
<p>And what happened when they were locked out of school for two years?</p>
<p>Okay, and I&rsquo;m not going to stop talking about this.</p>
<p>Because this is the issue of our times.</p>
<p>These are our kids.</p>
<p>Well, I want to get to underreported stories as well.</p>
<p>Jan.</p>
<p>Oh, for me, I mean, my kids hear me rant about this every day.</p>
<p>So I may as well tell you guys, it&rsquo;s the crushing impact that our COVID policies have</p>
<p>had on young kids and children, by far, you know, the least serious risk of serious illness.</p>
<p>But I mean, even teenagers, you know, a healthy teenager has a one in a million chance</p>
<p>of getting in and dying from COVID, which is way lower than, you know,</p>
<p>dying in a car wreck on a road trip.</p>
<p>But they have suffered and sacrificed the most, especially kids and underrepresented</p>
<p>at risk communities.</p>
<p>And now we have the Surgeon General saying there&rsquo;s a mental health crisis among our kids,</p>
<p>the risk of suicide, girl suicide attempts among girls, now up 51%.</p>
<p>This year, black kids, nearly twice as likely as white kids to die by suicide.</p>
<p>I mean, school closures, lockdowns, cancellation of sports, you couldn&rsquo;t even go on a playground</p>
<p>in the D.C. area without cops scurrying, getting, shooing the kids off.</p>
<p>Tremendous negative impact on kids.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been an afterthought.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s hurt their dreams, their future, learning loss, risk of abuse, their mental</p>
<p>health.</p>
<p>And now with our knowledge, our vaccines, if our policies don&rsquo;t reflect a more measured and</p>
<p>reasonable approach for our children, they will be paying for our generation&rsquo;s decisions</p>
<p>the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>And that, to me, is the greatest underreported story of the past year.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see it being talked about anywhere.</p>
<p>We talked about it first.</p>
<p>You know, I posted that link about the decrease in IQ points.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then we started to talk about it there slowly.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s trickling into the mainstream media where they&rsquo;re forced to talk.</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s impacted?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not rich kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of our kids.</p>
<p>That was a fantastic clip.</p>
<p>That CNN clip was fantastic.</p>
<p>The poor kids are the ones who are the ones who get hit the hardest.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t do supplemental.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t minimize what this is.</p>
<p>This is every child.</p>
<p>The data was that it&rsquo;s disproportionately affecting</p>
<p>minority kids.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that could be because of the sociology of the parents.</p>
<p>But Jason, you can also have rich colored parents.</p>
<p>Okay, Jay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just saying colored parents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying all poor kids, white poor kids who are in public school, poor kids, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting hit the minority kids of all kinds.</p>
<p>But frankly, the point is, it&rsquo;s all kids of all kinds.</p>
<p>Okay, so we don&rsquo;t need to sub segment this to make this issue go away.</p>
<p>And seems smaller than it is.</p>
<p>We have literally put 10s of millions of children.</p>
<p>Yes, at risk because of our behavior.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m agree with you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to minimize it or make it a smaller issue.</p>
<p>Your point is that none of the smaller audiences or smaller new media folks on YouTube or their</p>
<p>podcasting have enough breadth to really make an impact by talking about this topic.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>That the mainstream media is needed to hit the broad base?</p>
<p>No, what I&rsquo;m saying is very specific.</p>
<p>The people on YouTube cover what the people on YouTube want.</p>
<p>Okay, the people on podcasts cover what they want.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all very narrow, narrow niche.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, there is no set of incentives that then threads that together.</p>
<p>And then amplifies in the absence of those two mechanics, right?</p>
<p>Those are software mechanics and economic mechanics that need to get built in.</p>
<p>What we lose is signal, right?</p>
<p>That, in my opinion, right now, over the last two weeks, is the single most important signal.</p>
<p>And it is nowhere except for this one clip on CNN, and the discussion that we had two weeks ago,</p>
<p>because the YouTube, I just want to be really clear on this, because the YouTube is full of react</p>
<p>videos, right?</p>
<p>And video games, which is fine.</p>
<p>And the consumer is missing.</p>
<p>Yeah, is talking about this issue and actually holding people accountable.</p>
<p>And who should be held accountable in every single county, where it was basically a Board</p>
<p>of Education that was trying to shut these kids out, who stood up and who told that story?</p>
<p>Nobody did.</p>
<p>And if it was trying to be told, it wasn&rsquo;t amplified correctly enough.</p>
<p>And so what happens is, after two years of damage to all of our kids, 10s of millions of kids,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple of fissures.</p>
<p>One fissure was on this podcast, which I&rsquo;m very proud of.</p>
<p>Another fissure was this one few minutes,</p>
<p>CBS, CBS, whatever, was a Sunday show.</p>
<p>But my point is, these are the things that really matter.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying, and I think it&rsquo;s a really important point is that as a YouTuber, as a</p>
<p>podcaster, you pick your niche that you can hit home on.</p>
<p>And you hit home over and over every week.</p>
<p>But no one says I&rsquo;m going to broadly talk about the issues of our time.</p>
<p>And make sure no, no, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a small subset.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s more than a million people a week that listen to this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve we far exceeded MSNBC is average viewership, we&rsquo;re probably going to pass,</p>
<p>you know, most CNBC shows and some CNN shows by the end of next year.</p>
<p>So we will do it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not enough, there needs to be more of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re an opinion show as much, you know, we&rsquo;re not a traditional reporting show,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>In the sense that like, go out, gather data and facts and present them.</p>
<p>Or do you disagree with that?</p>
<p>Not that they do that anyway.</p>
<p>I disagree with that.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>I actually think we do a decent job of filtering for the truth.</p>
<p>And the reason we&rsquo;re able to do that is because of our friendship,</p>
<p>we can hold each other accountable and call out the bullshit when we see</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t have incentives, we don&rsquo;t have anything to lose, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s an incentive for us.</p>
<p>But I want to build on something that SAC said.</p>
<p>It is very hard for the media to hold this dissonance,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re saying everybody needs to shelter in place.</p>
<p>COVID is, you know, this huge thing, they put the death count,</p>
<p>they put the case counter up, they won&rsquo;t talk about deaths in ICU,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t talk about who&rsquo;s getting COVID,</p>
<p>because they have an incentive to get more ratings through COVID or Trump.</p>
<p>And they took that.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s a narrative violation, or it&rsquo;s cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>If they say at the same time, everybody needs to shelter in place,</p>
<p>this thing is really deadly.</p>
<p>But we should send our kids to school.</p>
<p>So they couldn&rsquo;t take that position sacks and trauma.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t take the position that Oh, well, kids could go to school,</p>
<p>because that would go against Hey, everybody needs to shelter in place.</p>
<p>And they picked, I think COVID is this super deadly thing.</p>
<p>Everybody has to shelter in place over</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re giving them way too much credit.</p>
<p>I think what happened was they had a position to re aggregate lost power.</p>
<p>And they took it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s real sense.</p>
<p>They did not think about the true consequences.</p>
<p>And it may not have happened at any one individual reporter level.</p>
<p>But when it ladders up to the editorial board,</p>
<p>and the decisions of the people who run the mastheads of these organizations,</p>
<p>they made the decision that currying and organizing power</p>
<p>was more important than shining a light to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Specifically, in this case, the thing that aggravates me the most is around our kids.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they were going for ratings.</p>
<p>But anyway, we can keep debating it.</p>
<p>Well, the one thing we can say for sure is they created a hysteria,</p>
<p>whether their motivation was ratings or a power grab or political advantage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably all the above.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is they wanted to create a hysteria.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been pumping COVID fear porn into the population for the last two years.</p>
<p>But my prediction, like I said, is that it all flips next year.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s an election and the way the media figures out</p>
<p>what its narrative is going to be is they start with the election result they want.</p>
<p>And then they reverse engineer the narrative that they think is going to</p>
<p>help achieve that election result.</p>
<p>And if it means contradicting what they said yesterday,</p>
<p>they will memory hole what they said yesterday,</p>
<p>in order to get on board with a new narrative.</p>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>I do think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But I think I just I want to I don&rsquo;t want to lose this thread because</p>
<p>this has nothing to do with COVID.</p>
<p>Meaning COVID was a symptom of this.</p>
<p>But if you really thought that the organized mainstream media</p>
<p>had the right to be, you know, has a has a purpose to be on the right side of justice,</p>
<p>where were they when when school boards were stripping out,</p>
<p>you know, advanced placement programs for kids?</p>
<p>Or where were they when they were shutting kids out?</p>
<p>Or where were they when they were engaged in eight hour</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t go against whether, you know, a male can be on a committee,</p>
<p>you know, because he&rsquo;s gay, but he&rsquo;s not, you know, black.</p>
<p>I mean, these were the issues that stopped our children</p>
<p>from literally walking into the classroom every day.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, they just stories were not told.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Just in one place.</p>
<p>They happened all across the country.</p>
<p>And this is where those folks had a responsibility because they also probably had kids.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t do a thing about it.</p>
<p>That one issue for me really drives me crazy.</p>
<p>Let me ask a probing question here.</p>
<p>We assume we&rsquo;re going to get out of this, you know, pandemic in 2022.</p>
<p>Knock on wood, no more variants.</p>
<p>What is the obligation and technique, the strategy</p>
<p>to solve what we did to these kids?</p>
<p>And I just want to put it out there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to answer it now.</p>
<p>But I think we could spend an episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very difficult question.</p>
<p>J Cal that I think you need sociologists and psychologists and educators.</p>
<p>We also need entrepreneurship and ideas.</p>
<p>And we need to have a dialogue so we can bring them on.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re going to spend all this money on build back better,</p>
<p>how about we build back the 20 lost fucking IQ points that these kids have?</p>
<p>And then we do something about the depression and anxiety they have.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Jason, we&rsquo;re never going to get there because the teachers unions</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t even acknowledge that learning loss exists.</p>
<p>The leaders need to break the teachers unions period.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, let me make a prediction in that regard.</p>
<p>Next year, there&rsquo;s going to be a ballot initiative in California</p>
<p>to the first school choice.</p>
<p>And the way it&rsquo;s going to work is that I think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>like $13,000 spent per pupil in California.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be there&rsquo;s going to be a ballot initiative that says that any</p>
<p>parent who wants to send their kid to an accredited school</p>
<p>can get a voucher for $13,000 from the state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just gonna be on the ballot.</p>
<p>I competition.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>I predict it will be the big, big election in California and maybe the nation next year.</p>
<p>And I think more than 100 million will be spent on both sides of that thing.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t predict it&rsquo;s going to win.</p>
<p>I hope it does.</p>
<p>This is a topic worth fighting over.</p>
<p>This is something important to fight over.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s school choice, because you know what?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>These guys pulled the wool over everybody&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>They slipped them the Mickey.</p>
<p>They hoodwinked them.</p>
<p>You need choice.</p>
<p>We know this as entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>If there is no competition, things do not get better.</p>
<p>These school unions are complacent.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s make a resolution.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make a New Year&rsquo;s resolution.</p>
<p>I think we all agree on this.</p>
<p>I got approached about this ballot initiative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be, like I said, a major ballot initiative next year for school choice in</p>
<p>California.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all get behind it.</p>
<p>All in summit profits will put towards this.</p>
<p>Yes, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put some money behind this.</p>
<p>I want to tell you just to more personalize this issue, because I really think a lot of</p>
<p>people listening struggle with this.</p>
<p>I entered the pandemic with rules.</p>
<p>I had rules about devices.</p>
<p>I had rules about, you know, how much time they could be online.</p>
<p>I had rules around physical fitness, right?</p>
<p>I had rules around diet.</p>
<p>And it all went out the window.</p>
<p>And it became this thing where it was like, feed them the best they can.</p>
<p>Sometimes they eat lunch with us.</p>
<p>Sometimes they have to eat lunch by themselves because I&rsquo;m stuck on some stupid Zoom, you</p>
<p>know, back to back in these dumb meetings because these kids aren&rsquo;t at school.</p>
<p>Their only way to interact with their friends became video games like Fortnite, where they</p>
<p>could at least talk to their friends.</p>
<p>But then it became an addiction where they were doing it for hours and hours.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m trying to, you know, they gained weight because they weren&rsquo;t physically active.</p>
<p>And I am trying to unwind.</p>
<p>As is not as is my ex wife, we&rsquo;re doing it together as a team.</p>
<p>It is so hard, absolutely hard, so hard.</p>
<p>And then I think, what about all these people who don&rsquo;t have the access to the resources</p>
<p>that I have to try to unwind this.</p>
<p>And then what happens is I send my kids to the school, and oh, they may have a headache.</p>
<p>Guess what, they get sent home.</p>
<p>And then their brother and sister have to get sent home to until you can test and be</p>
<p>COVID negative for a day in a row.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s yet another day of school loss.</p>
<p>Totally not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, this is supposed to be one of the best schools in the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not totally I think, what is every other school like, then if this is what if this</p>
<p>is what my children have to do, I think we should make this we should have this as a</p>
<p>major theme for 2022.</p>
<p>For the pod.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very important educators and teachers unions accountable.</p>
<p>Absolutely school boards accountable all around the country to fix this.</p>
<p>This is your responsibility.</p>
<p>You need to fix it.</p>
<p>We held police officers responsible in the last year or two, we&rsquo;ve seen this, you know,</p>
<p>policing being really like a spotlight put on it.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s put that same spotlight on teachers and administrators and schools.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll never do it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll never do it without competition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way to hold their feet.</p>
<p>And you know what, what I learned to build on what you said was, I just decided to get</p>
<p>a teacher and obviously I have the means to do it.</p>
<p>I know most people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I certainly didn&rsquo;t have it growing up.</p>
<p>We could barely, you know, afford to exist.</p>
<p>But I think homeschooling is a viable option.</p>
<p>So with that 13k I can tell you five parents who are in an underprivileged area can take</p>
<p>that five times 13 and take that what is that 65k and put it together and for 65k they can</p>
<p>hire a teacher and they can do a better job with those parents and a teacher for those</p>
<p>five kids.</p>
<p>I guarantee it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go to best performing asset of 2022.</p>
<p>What do you got your mom?</p>
<p>This is simple.</p>
<p>This will be battery metals, lithium, nickel, cobalt, okay, graphite, put them in a basket</p>
<p>like you can be along these things and rapid fire sacks.</p>
<p>What do you got best performing?</p>
<p>I just said series a venture because it&rsquo;s pretty unoriginal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>I think growth got a little bit overfunded and overheated.</p>
<p>And I think the seed stage also there&rsquo;s like so there were so many new seed investors again,</p>
<p>it might have been partially because of excess liquidity.</p>
<p>So series A is still the choke point.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s still the best area to invest in.</p>
<p>Innovation is not going to stop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be great series A investments next year.</p>
<p>I also picked early stage startups because that&rsquo;s where the magic happens.</p>
<p>I picked early stage like right before series A.</p>
<p>I think SPACing, direct listings, raising money, people coming down to do the series Bs,</p>
<p>all of that is creating a pull for more startups.</p>
<p>And the founders are getting very sophisticated in terms of</p>
<p>finding product market fit and scaling globally.</p>
<p>You know, earlier, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s creating these great big outcomes,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Uber or Facebook, both figuring out and Airbnb how to go global quickly.</p>
<p>So my choice for best performing asset of 2022 is still early stage startups.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what do you got?</p>
<p>Obviously, best performing asset in terms of a multiples basis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never going to beat seed stage investing, certainly.</p>
<p>But I tried to highlight and continue my</p>
<p>contrarian bet that we&rsquo;re going to see increased global conflict next year.</p>
<p>Again, driven by incumbents trying to hold on to political office and</p>
<p>increase inflation and fueling economic growth and the American response to China.</p>
<p>So in a world of increased global conflict, I think</p>
<p>assets that do really well are energy commodities and energy stocks.</p>
<p>I recently made a big bet on energy stocks, defense stocks.</p>
<p>And it used to be a gold, it could be the case that Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you know, sees a role as being a defensive</p>
<p>position and portfolios in a world of war and conflict.</p>
<p>So those are my kind of macro themes for asset.</p>
<p>Most anticipated trend of 2022.</p>
<p>What do you got your mouth?</p>
<p>A trend you&rsquo;re anticipating in 2022.</p>
<p>Peer to peer payments, the destruction of traditional rails, it will come out of Africa.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Saxe, what do you got?</p>
<p>This is where I had the civil war between progressives and pragmatic liberals.</p>
<p>So building on what Jamal said, you&rsquo;re already seeing this in the feud between</p>
<p>London Breed and Chesa Boudin.</p>
<p>That is really going to, I think, blossom next year.</p>
<p>We have not heard the last of that.</p>
<p>You saw it in Philadelphia where the mayor, Michael Nutter, took on Larry Krasner.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to see it in New York City between Eric Adams and these Manhattan elites.</p>
<p>And you also saw it in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>where the progressives were blaming Manchin for, you know, the losing the build back better.</p>
<p>So this is a civil war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to continue.</p>
<p>And what Jamal predicted with AOC versus Schumer would certainly play into that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s grabbed the popcorn.</p>
<p>It is the trend I&rsquo;m anticipating the most.</p>
<p>All right, there you go.</p>
<p>Do you anticipate a similar trend with like the alt-right Trumpians</p>
<p>and DeSantis and that kind of thing breaking up?</p>
<p>How do you see that playing out?</p>
<p>Not yet, because Trump isn&rsquo;t on the ballot in 2022.</p>
<p>So I actually think the Republican Party is going to be surprisingly united in 2022.</p>
<p>I think where the trouble might come in is when we have a Republican primary in 2023.</p>
<p>And especially if Trump runs, then, you know, all hell&rsquo;s going to break loose.</p>
<p>So who is it?</p>
<p>Who are the two people who would be most viable against Trump in that 2023?</p>
<p>Ron DeSantis and Ted Cruz?</p>
<p>Nikki Haley.</p>
<p>Nikki Haley.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be that&rsquo;s going to be fireworks.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what do you got?</p>
<p>Anticipated trend?</p>
<p>My biggest anticipated trend for 2022 is going to be a gold rush in biotech into</p>
<p>what I think will become the cover story on magazines throughout the year</p>
<p>that humans have discovered the fountain of youth.</p>
<p>And this will arise from these investments in what are called Yamanaka factor based</p>
<p>cell reprogramming methods.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this on the pod in the past a few years ago.</p>
<p>Scientists identified that four chemicals could trigger gene expression in cells and</p>
<p>get those cells to effectively revert to being stem cells.</p>
<p>And more recently demonstrated that using lower amounts of those chemicals and other</p>
<p>what are called kind of epigenetic factors can trigger partial cell reprogramming,</p>
<p>which causes cells in the body to act youthful.</p>
<p>As a result of those discoveries, an absolute gold rush is now underway.</p>
<p>More recently, Uri Milner, Jeff Bezos, Arch, and others put a billion dollars to seed a new</p>
<p>company called Altos Labs to pursue therapeutics in this area.</p>
<p>Google has individually funded a company called Calico, led by Art Levinson, the former founder</p>
<p>and CEO of Genentech.</p>
<p>And just recently, Blake Byers and Brian Armstrong announced their new company called</p>
<p>New Limit with $100 million, their own personal capital.</p>
<p>All of these companies are pursuing the same effort, which is basically causing cells to be</p>
<p>youthful, to regenerate in a youthful way.</p>
<p>And as a result, you see kind of organs and systems in the body act more healthily.</p>
<p>And there will be magazine covers and 60 Minutes article stories and all sorts of stuff will</p>
<p>start to happen in 2022 saying, Oh my gosh, as because the amount of money that&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>in this year is going to cause breakthroughs and discoveries to start to get published</p>
<p>about next year.</p>
<p>And when that starts to happen, and the media and the PR cycle start to kick up, you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>this become the year of Yamanaka factor based reprogramming.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s gonna be the biggest gold rush in biotech since recombinant DNA</p>
<p>was used by Genentech in the in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>All right, and I had most anticipated trend of 2022 being the accredited investor laws</p>
<p>are going to change and evolve.</p>
<p>And it might just be you take a test.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re now accredited, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you won the lottery, or you make 200,000</p>
<p>a year.</p>
<p>And a legal crypto framework is going to happen, I think, at the same time.</p>
<p>So those regulations combined are going to empower really interesting capital formation</p>
<p>on a global basis, whether it&rsquo;s running a syndicate with everybody in the world,</p>
<p>including non accredited investors, or DAOs, or those two things merging, or as Balaji</p>
<p>is talking about, you know, a cap table over here that&rsquo;s mirrored on a blockchain at the</p>
<p>same time and people being able to trade their interest in Chamath fund or Saks fund or one</p>
<p>of my syndicates with tokens on the internet.</p>
<p>And that could become a major unlock, where you know, if you were in I don&rsquo;t have a fund,</p>
<p>I run a meager family office.</p>
<p>Well, if you were in your earlier funds, and somebody and there was still stuff trickling</p>
<p>to social capital three, the people who have that could sell it back to you or sell it</p>
<p>to each other if they wanted to get liquidity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be super interesting, especially if it can happen just globally,</p>
<p>where some person in China decides they want to have access to US funds,</p>
<p>our LPs could just start selling.</p>
<p>If it was structured that way, most anticipated film, TV series, media, yada yada for 2020 22.</p>
<p>What do you got Yellowstone season nine, sex.</p>
<p>So I watched the first two episodes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>I mean, you forget what a great actor.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name is?</p>
<p>Kevin Costner.</p>
<p>Kevin Costner is a great actor.</p>
<p>Yes, Yellowstone is great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be watching next season.</p>
<p>But what I had down here is Thor Ragnarok.</p>
<p>The writer director Taika Waititi is back.</p>
<p>If you saw the last Thor movie,</p>
<p>Ragnarok, Ragnarok, Ragnarok was the last one.</p>
<p>The new one is called Thor Love and Thunder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, Thor went from being I think one of the most boring Marvel characters in</p>
<p>the first two movies to being one of the funniest and you know, most fun in his</p>
<p>last movie.</p>
<p>So I think that sequel will be really good.</p>
<p>And then the other one is they&rsquo;re doing a prequel show for Game of Thrones called House</p>
<p>of the Dragon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to watch that.</p>
<p>And then the probably the the Star Wars show I&rsquo;m looking forward to most would be the Obi</p>
<p>Wan Kenobi show with Ewan McGregor.</p>
<p>So that was Anakin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on and I had as well the Obi Wan show, the Boba Fett show and the Mandalorian</p>
<p>shows all coming back are going to be absolutely bonkers.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also this token series that&rsquo;s coming out the prequel, I think that Amazon</p>
<p>spending a billion dollars on and I think that&rsquo;s landing in 2022.</p>
<p>What do you got?</p>
<p>It is the all in summit in Miami and the the birth of all in media.</p>
<p>So I think that we by the end of 2022 will have published content, written content, not</p>
<p>necessarily by us, but other forms of media interaction that get the truth out to a large</p>
<p>swath of humanity.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Is this moving beyond just a couple of besties doing a podcast during lockdown?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Wait, so all in media.</p>
<p>Is that a new acronym?</p>
<p>AIM?</p>
<p>All in media.</p>
<p>Well, AIM.</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>Should we buy like a cable channel and just go 24 hours?</p>
<p>AIM is the truth.</p>
<p>AIM media.</p>
<p>AIM media.</p>
<p>Okay, there you go.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>This is news to the rest of us, but Chamath is building the media, bro.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Who are we going to hire?</p>
<p>Tucker.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be no shortage of folks who will want to come out of the woodwork to work with us on this.</p>
<p>And I think the goal should just be to make sure we figure out what the real North Star is so that</p>
<p>we never deviate.</p>
<p>And part of the biggest thing that we did, guys, was not trying to hustle for some few, you know,</p>
<p>shekels here or there, which was stupid.</p>
<p>Like J. Cal wanted to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>J. Cal, we&rsquo;re going to talk in a minute about the plan for the summer.</p>
<p>The purity of not wrapping this thing with crappy ads and all kinds of nonsense is we&rsquo;ve never lost</p>
<p>our way.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need some stupid deal for some crappy media company.</p>
<p>We all have independent ways in which we can monetize our lives and our hard work.</p>
<p>And so, we should come to this to always tell the truth.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s one of the, I will say one of the great innovations and decisions</p>
<p>that you championed was not putting ads on it.</p>
<p>I hear it all the time for people.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re seeing you from yourself, J. Cal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting idea where you use advertising basis.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if you have a media business that&rsquo;s not driven by advertising dollars and</p>
<p>not driven by greater, by trying to maximize page views and clicks and visits, then it</p>
<p>completely changes the equation of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I think this was part of the idea of what publicly funded media was supposed to be,</p>
<p>but it obviously got, you know, maybe a little bit too far to the left.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was just too, yeah, it was just too&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, then they started adding ads.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember that.</p>
<p>They lost some funding and they&rsquo;re like, okay, we&rsquo;re going to go for sponsorships.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not ads, they&rsquo;re sponsorships.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;re the new PBS.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s something different.</p>
<p>I mean, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>We do this without any expectation of financial reward.</p>
<p>We do it because we enjoy it.</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up for you, J. Cal?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I mean, I have other things that make money.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>J. Cal&rsquo;s doing pretty fucking good right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>Hey, poke the bear!</p>
<p>Poke the bear!</p>
<p>J. Cal&rsquo;s doing okay right now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re clubbing the baby seal club.</p>
<p>Boop, plug, boop.</p>
<p>Sass Syndicate just did our first deal, boop.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know we were doing this category.</p>
<p>I will tell you that.</p>
<p>I will promise you.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t watch TV.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>I would like to watch reruns of Doctor Who.</p>
<p>Nobody watches. Are you going to recommend?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter. I mean, come on.</p>
<p>What show from Finland with subtitles?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. You know, I spent a lot of time watching</p>
<p>esoteric videos</p>
<p>and stuff I find on YouTube.</p>
<p>I really think it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a different way of consuming media.</p>
<p>Just tell us what video game you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>Wes Anderson is putting out a porno.</p>
<p>Oh, I got you. I was watching this Paul Thomas Anderson</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so similar to Target.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like looking at a painting.</p>
<p>It will be of a vernacular going up and down a mountain.</p>
<p>I was in the Louvre watching this movie.</p>
<p>What video game are you playing?</p>
<p>I called Friedberg on the phone to talk about</p>
<p>The Ledge when he was going crazy on the group chat.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t talk about a video game.</p>
<p>What video game is that? I was actually playing a video game</p>
<p>by Annapurna Interactive,</p>
<p>which is Larry Ellison&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>media production company. Apparently, I didn&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>They had a video game arm.</p>
<p>The video games are&hellip;</p>
<p>The game I was playing was called Maquette.</p>
<p>You kind of have this</p>
<p>interesting movie-like poetic</p>
<p>experience as you play the game, so it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>just designed to be action-packed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I thought it was a very interesting new way</p>
<p>of entertaining oneself.</p>
<p>Okay, we can move on.</p>
<p>It was highly stimulating.</p>
<p>She made a simulation of a biology lab</p>
<p>and you actually get different beaker sizes</p>
<p>and you have different sub-proteins to start with.</p>
<p>You get to buy all of the</p>
<p>lab equipment you want, but it needs a</p>
<p>virtual currency. It&rsquo;s kind of like a simulation.</p>
<p>In order to get that virtual currency, you must</p>
<p>first mine it.</p>
<p>And the way that you mine is by solving mathematical</p>
<p>equations. I made a cruelty-free fish</p>
<p>device dish in my laboratory</p>
<p>because of the genocide of fish.</p>
<p>That was a little</p>
<p>controversial take last week. I got</p>
<p>DMs from people.</p>
<p>That was a spicy take, Freeberg.</p>
<p>Did you get any blowback from that spicy take</p>
<p>last week? I did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually going to respond to everyone that sent me a note</p>
<p>directly.</p>
<p>Was it really? Because people were like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re equating&hellip; Well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>The comment I made that I think really triggered</p>
<p>people was I said that animal agriculture</p>
<p>is worse than human slavery.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>address it now real quick. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think the point of</p>
<p>view that people took away from that was that I diminished</p>
<p>the pain</p>
<p>and the resonance</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>socioeconomic context of</p>
<p>human slavery, particularly</p>
<p>recently in America.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t my intention at all.</p>
<p>Not your intention, yeah. What I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to highlight is, first of all, human slavery</p>
<p>has been around as long as humans have been around, right?</p>
<p>For 10,000 years, back to ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>The enslavement of humans,</p>
<p>the removal of</p>
<p>opportunity and freedom granted</p>
<p>to every living being</p>
<p>is certainly manifest in the form of</p>
<p>human slavery, and we kind of take it as a very</p>
<p>acute pain point. What I was highlighting is</p>
<p>every year, over 100 billion</p>
<p>land-based animals are killed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>and put in chains and put</p>
<p>in jails and then murdered</p>
<p>and eaten by humans</p>
<p>as routine.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t lift our head up and recognize</p>
<p>just how serious and how skilled</p>
<p>this behavior</p>
<p>is. The industrialization</p>
<p>of this process is really</p>
<p>abhorrent, and there&rsquo;s videos you can watch, and I think</p>
<p>when you watch them, you&rsquo;ll recognize it&rsquo;s not made for this. Because it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>I knew it was coming.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it, Chamath.</p>
<p>I do think that Chamath&rsquo;s</p>
<p>voice in this is really the voice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kept this from ever becoming an issue. Because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not human, we don&rsquo;t pay attention to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to highlight that there</p>
<p>is something that is at such an extraordinary scale</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t pay attention to that one day</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll wake up and we&rsquo;ll be like, oh my god, how did we miss that?</p>
<p>I am in complete agreement with you, Friedberg. If you look at</p>
<p>all life being precious</p>
<p>and you say, the life of</p>
<p>a cow, the life of a dog,</p>
<p>the life of a human, these are all lives,</p>
<p>the scale of suffering</p>
<p>is greater</p>
<p>than what humans</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>These animals can problem solve, they can feel</p>
<p>emotion, they can recognize</p>
<p>things happening</p>
<p>to them and to their loved ones and their family</p>
<p>members, and I think that in the context</p>
<p>of that, to cause pain and suffering on those</p>
<p>animals and on those creatures, at the</p>
<p>scale that we do, is something that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>mind-blowing to me. I think that&rsquo;s fair enough. And I expect</p>
<p>that one day we will wake up and be like, I cannot</p>
<p>believe we let our society do that. But I</p>
<p>do think that we need to solve Chamath&rsquo;s problem,</p>
<p>which is how do you make something that&rsquo;s friggin delicious?</p>
<p>And how do you make it cheaper?</p>
<p>Hold on a second, it&rsquo;s not a problem. My</p>
<p>perspective is, I understand where you&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>I respect your point of view, but here&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>point of view, which is, we</p>
<p>evolved to superiority</p>
<p>in an evolutionary</p>
<p>process that was not preordained,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>we are now in a position where we</p>
<p>are allowed to consume things that we choose.</p>
<p>Now, there</p>
<p>is also a claim that you could make that, you know what,</p>
<p>a tiger or</p>
<p>a lion should not be attacking and killing a gazelle</p>
<p>because you know what, that&rsquo;s causing suffering</p>
<p>to the gazelle or blah, blah, blah. At the end</p>
<p>of the day, how we choose to go and consume</p>
<p>the things that we need for sustenance</p>
<p>is a choice that we can make, and there are</p>
<p>probably better choices we can make over time.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I think</p>
<p>that this was a reasonable</p>
<p>evolution of humanity and human</p>
<p>ingenuity and intellect. And I don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>guilty about that. I don&rsquo;t weigh</p>
<p>the suffering of animals the same way</p>
<p>I weigh the suffering of human beings. I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I would argue that when we were apes in the jungle</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t have the choice,</p>
<p>I would wholeheartedly agree with you.</p>
<p>But today, we are a people</p>
<p>that do have the choice. What choice do we have?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because we have the choice to not</p>
<p>eat meat and still survive and still be happy</p>
<p>that we can make a better choice. But it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taste good. Like, there&rsquo;s a part of my soul,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just be very honest with you. And that&rsquo;s why, and I agree,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I think we need to solve that problem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I believe&hellip; It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a problem. If you made</p>
<p>an alternative for you that tasted good</p>
<p>and was as affordable as the alternative,</p>
<p>which is actually killing an animal,</p>
<p>you would choose it. And we haven&rsquo;t given you that solution</p>
<p>yet. And when I say we, I mean</p>
<p>call it the techno food people.</p>
<p>But there is a tremendous amount of money going</p>
<p>into this area. And we will devise</p>
<p>artificially produced meat</p>
<p>that will not be made by killing an animal,</p>
<p>but will be made in a lab that looks and tastes identical.</p>
<p>When will we have a steak or a piece of sushi? Just give us a year.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a piece of sushi</p>
<p>in three years. You will have&hellip;</p>
<p>You will be able to go</p>
<p>taste chicken next year. It&rsquo;ll be very,</p>
<p>very expensive. Okay. But</p>
<p>cell-based meat will be available</p>
<p>at a commercial scale within</p>
<p>the next five to 10 years. When are we going to get our</p>
<p>steak? That&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>David, my commitment to you is I will do a taste test</p>
<p>whenever you say&hellip;</p>
<p>You pick the place, the time. Totally.</p>
<p>I will show up. And if it&rsquo;s better,</p>
<p>I will never eat meat again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not ready for that. And that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>commitment. All right.</p>
<p>I am similar in the commitment.</p>
<p>But in the meantime&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t troll him.</p>
<p>But I will say,</p>
<p>Friedberg, if you&rsquo;re going to have a party</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only vegan,</p>
<p>you need to put that on the invite.</p>
<p>Because I came thinking you were going to feed me.</p>
<p>There was no meat. He was really upset.</p>
<p>He was going around my party being like,</p>
<p>what the hell is this? There&rsquo;s no meat in this party.</p>
<p>Can you make me a hamburger?</p>
<p>The woman from wherever&hellip;</p>
<p>Napa was like, I&rsquo;ve never touched meat</p>
<p>in 30 years. I made the most incredible ribeye</p>
<p>on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>All right, everybody. For the dictator himself,</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya with great</p>
<p>hair, a touch of gray,</p>
<p>never looked better. And the</p>
<p>sultan of science, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>And Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bestie, GOP frontrunner,</p>
<p>David Sachs, super spreading</p>
<p>COVID. Super spreading</p>
<p>the truth. Super spreading the truth.</p>
<p>David Sachs</p>
<p>from an undisclosed</p>
<p>bestie hideaway,</p>
<p>which we all know, but we won&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jake Al, and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see you in 2022.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a great year. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a piss in your driveway, Sachs.</p>
<p>This is like</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release</p>
<p>somehow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a beeeep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a beep.</p>
<p>We need to get merged.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
