    <p>In true Leo fashion, I&rsquo;m gonna start off the first episode of my podcast with a</p>
<p>motherfucking trigger warning, okay? I&rsquo;m making this podcast to talk about real</p>
<p>life, real shit, the real struggles and what everyone&rsquo;s actually dealing with</p>
<p>and what no one talks about, okay? So if you like the fake bullshit you see</p>
<p>online, you&rsquo;re not gonna like this. Go live in your fake reality and stay in</p>
<p>your little bubble over there because I&rsquo;m gonna pop that motherfucker, alright?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not playing that. I don&rsquo;t like the fake shit. So all you little trigger</p>
<p>warning weirdos have been warned. No future episode will come with one, so get</p>
<p>the fuck gone now, okay? And for all the people that are staying, love you. Okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get into this because I want to start off my first episode. I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna dive right into it. I want to talk about one of the main reasons people are</p>
<p>dissatisfied with their lives and it&rsquo;s because social media paints a narrative</p>
<p>of how things are meant to go or be or look, okay? So no one posts what is really</p>
<p>going on in their life. They post the highlight reel, okay? We know this. People</p>
<p>have talked about this before, but no one talks about and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going on long enough for people to study the effects of it and how it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>people up. But when people are posting a false reality online, you are</p>
<p>subconsciously and even consciously sometimes comparing yourself to it and</p>
<p>your life. Like you&rsquo;re comparing everything you do and everything you are</p>
<p>and how you look to this narrative that is being shoved in your face every time</p>
<p>you get on your phone. And there&rsquo;s a lot of bad effects to it, but the</p>
<p>dissatisfaction with your own life is like one of them because the like the</p>
<p>subconscious part of this like we don&rsquo;t realize how bad and how strong that is.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna give you a couple examples and they&rsquo;re gonna get a little</p>
<p>bit more intense as we go. So let&rsquo;s start out with like examples of eating and</p>
<p>dieting because we all see fitness influencers with their fucking assholes</p>
<p>out. They all look great and we want to look like them. Yeah, sure, fine. They post</p>
<p>their little what I eat in a days and they&rsquo;re eating all this healthy bullshit</p>
<p>and they make it it just looks so easy. Like you have your little berries in</p>
<p>your fucking oatmeal then you have a little protein shake and I know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not satisfied, but they pretend to be. Okay, they pretend that they&rsquo;re full. They</p>
<p>pretend that they&rsquo;re happy eating like this. Sure, the long-term benefits of</p>
<p>being happy, taking care of yourself. Yeah, sure, fine. But nobody talks about the</p>
<p>struggles of when you&rsquo;re doing it. So what I mean by that is like no one talks</p>
<p>about when you&rsquo;re starving or when you&rsquo;re fighting off the urge to binge or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re depressed as fuck and the last thing you want to do is eat a goddamn</p>
<p>bowl of oatmeal. Bitch, you want a cheesecake. Like no one shows that they</p>
<p>even have the urges or the feelings that are not pleasant. The narrative that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being pushed online is not human. Like the people online that we see don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>feelings. They don&rsquo;t want to binge. They don&rsquo;t get hungry. They are satisfied with</p>
<p>the way that they eat in the same fucking thing every single day. They have</p>
<p>no issue with it. So that I just realized that right now like my fucking problem</p>
<p>with what online is like portraying is that you&rsquo;re not meant to be human or</p>
<p>like the human side is left out of it because everything is just perfect and</p>
<p>pretty all the time. But yes, like with working out, do you think these</p>
<p>motherfuckers want to go to the gym every day? No! I hate going to the gym.</p>
<p>Okay? No, I love it. I do, but like no one shows the days when they&rsquo;re in their car</p>
<p>having a fucking mental breakdown and they have to pick their self up, dust</p>
<p>their self off, make their self go into the gym and work out. And then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>days that no one shows. Well, I have them. I don&rsquo;t know if these fucking fitness</p>
<p>freaks do, but I do. Where I don&rsquo;t know what kind of fucking asshole said</p>
<p>getting to the gym is the hard part. Bitch, that&rsquo;s the easiest fucking part</p>
<p>because I show up to the gym all the time and leave. Working out is the hard</p>
<p>part. So whoever tells you getting to the gym is the hardest part, they&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>liar. Tell them to eat a dick. Actually, don&rsquo;t. Just swipe away. Don&rsquo;t comment any</p>
<p>hate. But yeah, none of these hot influencer people, none of these people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking up to and trying to take advice from are real. No one expresses or</p>
<p>shares or vlogs those fucking day in my life&rsquo;s. A day in my life where everything</p>
<p>is going fucking wrong. A day in my life where I&rsquo;m human. A day in my life where I</p>
<p>feel like dog shit and I don&rsquo;t want to work out and I ate a full cheesecake to</p>
<p>myself. Like no one shows that. And then now I feel guilt because I ate the</p>
<p>cheesecake but now I feel like an imposter because I have to get online</p>
<p>and post how hot I am but I can&rsquo;t post the picture that I take today because I</p>
<p>look bloated because I ate the fucking cheesecake. So I&rsquo;m gonna lie and post a</p>
<p>picture from a month ago so everybody thinks I&rsquo;m still hot. Okay, like as you</p>
<p>become aware you&rsquo;re gonna start being able to read through shit so easy and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so frustrated. So let&rsquo;s move on to the next topic because this is this one</p>
<p>hits a little home to me with the eating and the working out. Alright, that</p>
<p>one pisses me off because it does make you feel lonely. Like I feel like I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>only one that struggles this fucking hard with eating clean and working out</p>
<p>and being strict and having discipline with myself. Like it&rsquo;s not fucking easy.</p>
<p>It is one of the hardest things you&rsquo;ll do. I swear. Like breaking that habit</p>
<p>that you eat in and like counting calories like I fucking dread it. I hate</p>
<p>counting calories. Like I just want to go back to the days where I could just sit</p>
<p>down and just binge whatever the fuck I wanted to binge okay and not even think</p>
<p>about the goddamn calorie count. But now I can&rsquo;t not think about the calorie count.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like yeah if I sit down to eat a whole cheesecake I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still my example for everything but I love a cheesecake and I cannot have one</p>
<p>as you can tell I&rsquo;m fiending. Like if I sit down with a whole cheesecake I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like bitch that&rsquo;s like 3,000 calories and I can&rsquo;t get that out of my brain and</p>
<p>it makes me not want to eat it. So blessing in disguise short but like the</p>
<p>whole being responsible thing not being able to leave my brain pisses me off.</p>
<p>Okay next topic because I&rsquo;m over that one. Starting a business. Okay everybody</p>
<p>online is always on about fucking Amazon FBA. Fucking start a business. Start this</p>
<p>start that. Sell t-shirts on Amazon. Fucking twiddle your dick on fucking</p>
<p>OnlyFans. Like everybody talks about starting businesses. Crypto. I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know what the fuck crypto and the stock market is. I have no interest. But</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s pushing that shit. No one explains how actually difficult and how</p>
<p>many roadblocks there are from when you have an idea to start something. To start</p>
<p>taking your first steps and then getting that thing made to completion. No one has</p>
<p>made. I&rsquo;m gonna fucking do it. But no one has made that I&rsquo;ve found that has like</p>
<p>completely revealed everything about starting their business. From how they</p>
<p>got the funding. From how they got the idea. All the struggles they went through.</p>
<p>How they got through certain things. Did you have the permits? Did you have did</p>
<p>you get sued? Did someone steal something from you? Like I want to know everything.</p>
<p>How many companies tried to fuck you? Because when I was making my app I</p>
<p>almost got fucked like three times. Like you have to be paranoid. You can&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>anyone. Like my hand. I have tattooed on my hand. Trust no one. For a reason. Because</p>
<p>every time I look down I&rsquo;m fucking reminded. People have their own best</p>
<p>interests at heart. Okay? I need to remember that. I&rsquo;m someone with like a</p>
<p>genuine heart and I care about other human beings just because they&rsquo;re human</p>
<p>beings. Okay? But other people don&rsquo;t. I want to hear your stories where you</p>
<p>interact with these fucking people that try and fuck you in business. That try</p>
<p>and ruin you. That will copy your ideas and then pay they have more money so</p>
<p>they can advertise more and it will beat yours. That&rsquo;s what they do to me with my</p>
<p>app because there&rsquo;s bigger apps that have more money. I want to know how you</p>
<p>handle all that shit. I want to know all your fucking the doubt you had in your</p>
<p>mind. I want to know how you second-guess yourself. I want to know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking human. You know? Like I want to be able to relate. I&rsquo;m done with social</p>
<p>media with like trying to look up to people and shit. Nah. I want someone I can</p>
<p>relate to. I want something that&rsquo;s some real-life shit. I&rsquo;m tired of like getting</p>
<p>on my phone and entering a whole different reality. I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>leave my reality anymore. I want to be in it so I can fucking change it and love</p>
<p>it and enjoy it. You know what I mean? And social media is just taking me out of it</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m fucking sick of it. Okay so moving on to the next thing. Just another</p>
<p>example. Drugs. Everybody glorifies the fuck out of doing some drugs. Okay? Even</p>
<p>just drinking alcohol. Like no one talks about the next day how you wake up with</p>
<p>the goddamn Sunday scaries and you&rsquo;re anxious and you&rsquo;re texting all your</p>
<p>friends. Do you hate me? Are we okay? Like you don&rsquo;t know. Like you just feel</p>
<p>like everyone&rsquo;s mad at you. I&rsquo;ve not seen one person fucking talk about that. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m sitting here. I&rsquo;m like am I crazy? Because I&rsquo;m the only one that</p>
<p>feels this because no one seems to talk about it. So I&rsquo;m sitting here left like</p>
<p>am I fucking nuts or is this normal? So if more people would fucking talk about</p>
<p>it we could all relate and we would all feel better because we know it&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fucking after-effect of drinking alcohol. Anyway drugs. Okay? No</p>
<p>one posts the come down. No one posts wanting to fucking kill</p>
<p>their self for three days after they do drugs. I just I wish more people were</p>
<p>open and honest about the way that they feel but I understand it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like people don&rsquo;t want to post shit that&rsquo;s not happy. Positive positive</p>
<p>positive. Like yeah I have positive focus but I talk about real shit too. Like I</p>
<p>talk about all of life not just the positive aspects and I think people are</p>
<p>afraid if they post what they&rsquo;re feeling and it&rsquo;s not happy happy like chipper</p>
<p>happy dick. Like they&rsquo;re gonna they&rsquo;re scared they&rsquo;re gonna lose followers and</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t gonna like it or whatever. Because I feel like that sometimes too</p>
<p>like when I&rsquo;m in a really long negative headspace like it lasts for a long time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like alright slow it down with the fucking sad posts. Like I get them not</p>
<p>wanting to post it but people need to know like what&rsquo;s up like what&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>up and what&rsquo;s actually going on. But my whole point with that was not like</p>
<p>telling people to post that they&rsquo;re doing drugs. Post about how you feel. Post</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re sad. You know what I mean? Like it&rsquo;s okay to be sad but not these</p>
<p>fucking tik-tok bitches where they make that their only personality trait. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about genuinely express your feelings. Oh speaking of feelings I gotta</p>
<p>bounce back to that. But genuinely expressing your feelings. Like these</p>
<p>little fucking girls I mean it&rsquo;s mostly girls there&rsquo;s a couple gays that do it</p>
<p>too piss me the fuck off. But they make like being sad and depressed and like</p>
<p>having a hard life like that&rsquo;s their fucking personality trait. Like and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like I don&rsquo;t want I don&rsquo;t do this I don&rsquo;t say this often but bitch your</p>
<p>life ain&rsquo;t that fucking bad shut up. I don&rsquo;t like I know you&rsquo;re just I can see</p>
<p>when people are doing it for attention or someone is just being genuine and</p>
<p>expressing their authentic feelings. But circling back to the feelings thing. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>expecting a lot of people because in order to be able to express how you</p>
<p>actually feel you need to be in touch with how you feel and a lot of people</p>
<p>are cut off from their emotions. They don&rsquo;t understand what the fuck they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling. Like I used to be one of these people before I had my whole like</p>
<p>awakening and whatnot but I would only feel anger. Like that was my only emotion</p>
<p>I could feel. It was anger and happiness. I could not feel sad. I literally went to</p>
<p>therapy because I was like I haven&rsquo;t cried since I&rsquo;m like 12. I want to cry. I</p>
<p>have sad things happen like devastating things happen to me and not a single</p>
<p>fucking tear. Goddamn desert in my eyes. Like I want to be able to tap into these</p>
<p>emotions and then I had to go to therapy and wake up and you have to like get in</p>
<p>touch with how you feel. My point in that is it&rsquo;s a very complex process for what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking of people by sharing their authentic feelings. You need to be in</p>
<p>touch with the way that you feel. Okay great. And then you need to be able to</p>
<p>articulate that. So you need to be able to put it into words which is very hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a skill. And then you have to have the fucking courage and the balls and</p>
<p>not be wrapped up in your ego and the image you&rsquo;re trying to portray online to</p>
<p>express it. So you need to feel it. It&rsquo;s like step one you need to feel it. Step</p>
<p>two you need to recognize it. Okay you need to become aware that you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>it. So feel it. Become aware that you&rsquo;re feeling it. Put words to it. Understand</p>
<p>how to express it and then have the balls to express it. Like it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>complex thing and I just feel like it&rsquo;s a very basic thing for myself because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at a certain point of like my emotional development that I get that.</p>
<p>But I need to like I&rsquo;m looking back right now like damn I sound like an ass</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m expecting a lot of people but at the same time go the fuck up. Go</p>
<p>the fuck up. Get in touch with how you feel and goddamn talk about it because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of the world the way it is. Okay my next topic I want to talk about. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna rant about this shit for a while. Going out. Okay you and your friends are</p>
<p>getting ready to go out. Nobody posts the real life. These fucking bitches will</p>
<p>post a pregame. I&rsquo;ve been bitches before okay. So like I&rsquo;m guilty of it but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t like I just don&rsquo;t post shit really anymore. I just keep it to</p>
<p>myself. I save it to my memories. I like to have the memories. I don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>share it because when I get drunk I be sharing too much. I think shit is just so</p>
<p>funny and it&rsquo;s not and I wake up in the morning like mortified about what the</p>
<p>fuck I post. You know it&rsquo;s not way that bad I&rsquo;m just a hard judge of myself. But</p>
<p>anyway back to the bitches going out. I always say bitches like usually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>girls doing this but like guys do too. Like when the girl like say they like</p>
<p>getting ready with like just a bunch of group of friends guys and girls</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s getting ready to go out okay. So you&rsquo;re getting ready for the pregame.</p>
<p>Nobody shows the fucking mess that everybody makes getting ready. Nobody</p>
<p>shows the chaos of everybody trying to squeeze into the fucking mirrors and</p>
<p>everybody trying to get ready okay. You add that okay. Then you get to the</p>
<p>pregame. Everybody&rsquo;s like trying to bum off of everybody else&rsquo;s alcohol. Like I</p>
<p>always show up with alcohol because I&rsquo;ll be damned if I&rsquo;m gonna go without okay. I</p>
<p>always make sure I come prepared. Like I try to take care of myself but I bring</p>
<p>enough for everybody. That&rsquo;s just how I fucking am. I&rsquo;m Albanian alright. But</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fucking wreck. There are so many cups. There&rsquo;s so much shit that</p>
<p>people bring out and like fuck up for a pregame. There&rsquo;s shit left everywhere and</p>
<p>oh now we&rsquo;re running late. Everybody&rsquo;s running late so we don&rsquo;t have time to</p>
<p>clean the house. So we don&rsquo;t have time to pick up after our fucking self. So when</p>
<p>you get home the house is a fucking wreck. Where&rsquo;s my phone? Where&rsquo;s my keys?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my shoe? Like bitch you fucking should have cleaned up and you&rsquo;d know</p>
<p>where all your shit was. So go like the pregame okay. So everybody&rsquo;s posting they</p>
<p>look so hot at the pregame. Everybody&rsquo;s having fun. Everybody&rsquo;s cheersing and</p>
<p>then everybody wants to fight over who wants to order the uber and who wants to</p>
<p>try and squeeze 20 people like a fucking clown car into one car because</p>
<p>nobody wants to pay for the uber. Alright I&rsquo;ll pay for the fucking uber. Let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>go. I&rsquo;m sick of dealing with everybody. No one posts the actual frustration. You</p>
<p>got the one bitch that&rsquo;s running late. Got one fucking titty out. Still trying</p>
<p>to get ready. You got the other one that&rsquo;s like already too drunk at the</p>
<p>fucking pregame and then you got the other one that&rsquo;s like in the car like</p>
<p>fighting with her boyfriend. Okay so now everybody&rsquo;s in the car. We&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>the club. Everybody&rsquo;s at the club okay. The one bitch that was way too drunk</p>
<p>fucked up her outfit. She spilled shit all over. She threw up. Whatever she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing. The other one that&rsquo;s fighting with her boyfriend wants to go home early and</p>
<p>she wants to leave. This other one&rsquo;s got drunk and now she&rsquo;s sad and she wants to</p>
<p>go fuck her ex. Like it&rsquo;s just a shit show. Like nobody posts that. All you see</p>
<p>is all these people at the club looking hot, buying shots, drinking their drink,</p>
<p>taking their fucking selfies. Like all you see is everybody looking hot. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see what went into it. You don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s actually going on. You know</p>
<p>what I mean? So that sets up a narrative of like okay so when I go out it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna be hot and fine and then when you fucking go to get ready to go out and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a goddamn disaster you&rsquo;re left subconsciously comparing. This is just a</p>
<p>stupid example. But like you get what I mean? Like everything online. Like all</p>
<p>these fucking people on TikTok. I love the New Yorkers. Like the trust fund New</p>
<p>Yorker kids that go out and all they do is party. I fucking live for them. Okay?</p>
<p>But I cannot imagine how boring they are. You know what I mean? Oh my god here</p>
<p>comes Kat. She&rsquo;s lonely. You hear her? She&rsquo;s just like me. She needs attention. I have a</p>
<p>black cat and her name&rsquo;s Kat but it&rsquo;s spelled with a K. Okay back to the New</p>
<p>York kids. So watching them all party and go out it&rsquo;s like if like honestly my</p>
<p>favorite nights and the nights that I&rsquo;ve had the best time I have no footage</p>
<p>and no pictures of it. So it makes me question how much fun are y&rsquo;all actually</p>
<p>having if you have time in your night out to take your phone out and take</p>
<p>multiple clips and make a fucking collage of your night that&rsquo;s pretty cute</p>
<p>everyone looks hot everything looks fun. I just really they&rsquo;re the most boring</p>
<p>fucking people. Like they look so cool and I eat their videos up. Okay? Such a</p>
<p>vibe. Such an aesthetic. But like I would hate to be there. I would hate to party</p>
<p>with those people. You know? Like I like to get ugly. I like to have fun. I like</p>
<p>when no one has their phone out because I don&rsquo;t want to see what I looked like.</p>
<p>You know? So that&rsquo;s just my little two cents about the little party shit. Okay</p>
<p>so the next topic I want to talk about is how it&rsquo;s so forced that everyone</p>
<p>needs to make it on your own. You need to have it on your own. You need to be</p>
<p>successful. Like you need to have this image of like you got it all figured the</p>
<p>fuck out and you&rsquo;re doing fine financially and you did it all yourself</p>
<p>yourself mate. So the reality is people are living off fucking credit cards and</p>
<p>people are helping them out financially but they&rsquo;re playing that fucking role</p>
<p>online. Like they&rsquo;re having the fucking nice-ass dinners. They&rsquo;re going out and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ordering drinks non-stop. They&rsquo;re partying almost every day of the</p>
<p>fucking week. They look cool. The image is upheld. But babe how are they</p>
<p>affording it you ask? Most people are having help from their parents or</p>
<p>someone else that is funding them or they&rsquo;re living off of a credit card and</p>
<p>a credit limit. Okay? None of their shit is actually paid off. They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>actually paying for any of the shit that they&rsquo;re doing. You know? Like people</p>
<p>buying designer clothes and shit they put on a credit card because you only</p>
<p>have to pay the minimum payment before you get charged interest. But even if you</p>
<p>get charged interest you already spent the fucking money. So you have what you</p>
<p>have. Like I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know how to explain this but like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spending money that&rsquo;s not theirs that they can&rsquo;t pay back but they don&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a fuck. That has never sat right with me. I&rsquo;ve never once carried a credit card</p>
<p>like balance in my life. Like that would&hellip; I&rsquo;m a rising rogo so perfectionist. Like</p>
<p>it drives me fucking insane. Okay? I have a really bad relationship with money and</p>
<p>I have a lot of anxiety around it and I like to make sure my shit is paid off</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t owe nobody nothing. It stresses me the fuck out. Anyway these</p>
<p>people are spending out of their means. They don&rsquo;t even have means. They have a</p>
<p>fucking credit card limit and they&rsquo;re spending it. Just because you have the</p>
<p>available limit does not mean you have the funds to cover what you spend. So</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking spend it. But they have this image they need to portray that I</p>
<p>made it on my own. I&rsquo;m self-sufficient. I&rsquo;m successful. Like bitch you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking in debt. Sorry. Okay so back like let me lean off of like talking</p>
<p>shit on these people. So let me give you an example of like the comparison thing.</p>
<p>So if I see someone that&rsquo;s my age and they&rsquo;re out and they&rsquo;re spending a</p>
<p>hundred, two hundred dollars on dinner three to four times a week and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>always out having fun, drinking alcohol, doing all this shit, spending all this</p>
<p>money and I&rsquo;m sitting here like well I can&rsquo;t afford to go spend two hundred</p>
<p>dollars on dinner three to four times a fucking week. Like what? How are you</p>
<p>saving money and still doing all this? Like it makes me frustrated because I</p>
<p>assume the way that I manage my money everyone else&rsquo;s. And that&rsquo;s where I go</p>
<p>wrong is because I think that the way that I put a certain amount of money</p>
<p>towards savings and I have a certain amount that I spend, I think everyone</p>
<p>else does that. When in reality everyone is spending, not everyone, but these</p>
<p>people I am comparing myself to could possibly be spending their entire</p>
<p>paycheck and all the money that they do make on these dinners. They might not be</p>
<p>saving anything. They might not be managing their money well. They might</p>
<p>just be spending it as they make it. So the comparison shit really like fucks</p>
<p>with me sometimes and I have to catch myself and I have to like pull myself</p>
<p>out of it and make myself aware like hey I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if their parents helped them. I don&rsquo;t know if they have a sugar daddy. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what the fuck their situation is. I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>living off their paycheck but not saving anything. I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>managing their money so I&rsquo;m not gonna compare it you know but it is very</p>
<p>frustrating to see people doing shit where you&rsquo;re like how the fuck do you</p>
<p>afford that? Like at my age I&rsquo;m 23 like how the fuck are you 23 affording XYZ</p>
<p>you know because you can compare that to anything. But like it causes frustration</p>
<p>for me personally because I look at my own life and I get frustrated because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like what the fuck like it&rsquo;s like a subconscious why am I not there? How are</p>
<p>they doing that? How can I do that? Like it makes me feel less than because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not doing that sometimes. So like the people aren&rsquo;t gonna post oh yeah I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>save any money and yeah I have $20,000 of credit card debt but I go out to eat</p>
<p>four times a week. Like no one is gonna share the real life but that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>example of the narrative that I&rsquo;m talking about that everyone&rsquo;s painting.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a false ass narrative and it makes everyone feel like dog shit but we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why we can&rsquo;t stop looking. Like social media is so fucking</p>
<p>addictive like what we&rsquo;re seeing makes us feel like shit so why do we keep</p>
<p>looking at it? You know what I mean? I can&rsquo;t figure it out I&rsquo;m not a scientist</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m not running an experiment don&rsquo;t ask me somebody else can fucking do that</p>
<p>okay like I&rsquo;m just I&rsquo;m gonna sit in my lane over here and just fucking vent on</p>
<p>my podcast. Alright I think this is it for my first podcast episode so if you</p>
<p>made it this far I hope you enjoyed it thanks for listening leave it like a</p>
<p>rating if you want and you can leave in the comments like if you do a rating</p>
<p>five stars please preferably but you can leave a comment and like leave a comment</p>
<p>of a topic you&rsquo;d want me to talk about if you want me to talk about something</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna go deep into everything like how I kind of did with this like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna just scratch the surface with little bullshit and I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>paint like a false reality and I&rsquo;m gonna start sharing a lot of my own</p>
<p>experiences so people can relate and not feel like ass about their self so yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it thanks for listening</p>
