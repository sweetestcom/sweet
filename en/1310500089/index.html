    <p>The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, a computer scientist, mathematician,</p>
<p>and theoretical physicist who is the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research, a company behind</p>
<p>Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language, and the new Wolfram Physics Project. He&rsquo;s the author</p>
<p>of several books including A New Kind of Science, which on a personal note was one of the most</p>
<p>influential books in my journey in computer science and artificial intelligence. It made</p>
<p>me fall in love with the mathematical beauty and power of cellular automata.</p>
<p>It is true that perhaps one of the criticisms of Stephen is on a human level, that he has a big</p>
<p>ego, which prevents some researchers from fully enjoying the content of his ideas.</p>
<p>We talk about this point in this conversation. To me, ego can lead you astray but can also be</p>
<p>a superpower, one that fuels bold, innovative thinking that refuses to surrender to the cautious</p>
<p>ways of academic institutions. And here, especially, I ask you to join me in looking</p>
<p>past the peculiarities of human nature and opening your mind to the beauty of ideas in Stephen&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>and in this conversation. I believe Stephen Wolfram is one of the most original minds of our time</p>
<p>and, at the core, is a kind, curious, and brilliant human being. This conversation was recorded in</p>
<p>November 2019 when the Wolfram Physics Project was underway but not yet ready for public</p>
<p>exploration as it is now. We now agreed to talk again, probably multiple times in the near future,</p>
<p>so this is round one, and stay tuned for round two soon.</p>

<p>market with as little as one dollar. Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention</p>
<p>that the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of</p>
<p>fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel. So big props to the Cash App engineers for</p>
<p>solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the</p>
<p>next layer of abstraction over the stock market. This makes trading more accessible for new</p>
<p>investors and diversification much easier. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,</p>

<p>with Stephen Wolfram. You and your son Christopher helped create the alien language in the movie</p>
<p>Arrival. So let me ask maybe a bit of a crazy question, but if aliens were to visit us on earth,</p>
<p>do you think we would be able to find a common language?</p>
<p>Well, by the time we&rsquo;re saying aliens are visiting us, we&rsquo;ve already prejudiced the whole story</p>
<p>because the concept of an alien actually visiting, so to speak, we already know they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>things that make sense to talk about visiting. So we already know they exist in the same kind</p>
<p>of physical setup that we do. It&rsquo;s not just radio signals. It&rsquo;s an actual thing that shows up and so</p>
<p>on. So I think in terms of can one find ways to communicate? Well, the best example we have of</p>
<p>this right now is AI. I mean, that&rsquo;s our first sort of example of alien intelligence. And the</p>
<p>question is, how well do we communicate with AI? If you were in the middle of a neural network,</p>
<p>a neural net, and you open it up and it&rsquo;s like, what are you thinking? Can you discuss things</p>
<p>with it? It&rsquo;s not easy, but it&rsquo;s not absolutely impossible. So I think by the time, given the</p>
<p>setup of your question, aliens visiting, I think the answer is yes, one will be able to find some</p>
<p>form of communication, whatever communication means. Communication requires notions of purpose</p>
<p>and things like this. It&rsquo;s a kind of philosophical quagmire.</p>
<p>So if AI is a kind of alien life form, what do you think visiting looks like? So if we look at</p>
<p>aliens visiting, and we&rsquo;ll get to discuss computation and the world of computation,</p>
<p>but if you were to imagine, you said you already prejudiced something by saying you visit,</p>
<p>but how would aliens visit?</p>
<p>By visit, there&rsquo;s kind of an implication. And here we&rsquo;re using the imprecision of human language,</p>
<p>you know, in a world of the future. And if that&rsquo;s represented in computational language,</p>
<p>we might be able to take the concept visit and go look in the documentation, basically,</p>
<p>and find out exactly what does that mean, what properties does it have, and so on.</p>
<p>But by visit, in ordinary human language, I&rsquo;m kind of taking it to be there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>a physical embodiment that shows up in a spacecraft, since we kind of know that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>necessary. We&rsquo;re not imagining it&rsquo;s just, you know, photons showing up in a radio signal that,</p>
<p>you know, photons in some very elaborate pattern, we&rsquo;re imagining it&rsquo;s physical</p>
<p>things made of atoms and so on, that show up.</p>
<p>Can it be photons in a pattern?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good question. I mean, whether there is the possibility,</p>
<p>you know, what counts as intelligence? Good question. I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, and I</p>
<p>used to think there was sort of a, oh, there&rsquo;ll be, you know, it&rsquo;ll be clear what it means to</p>
<p>find extraterrestrial intelligence, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I&rsquo;ve increasingly realized,</p>
<p>as a result of science that I&rsquo;ve done, that there really isn&rsquo;t a bright line between</p>
<p>the intelligent and the merely computational, so to speak.</p>
<p>So, you know, in our kind of everyday sort of discussion, we&rsquo;ll say things like, you know,</p>
<p>the weather has a mind of its own. Well, let&rsquo;s unpack that question. You know, we realize</p>
<p>that there are computational processes that go on that determine the fluid dynamics of this and</p>
<p>that and the atmosphere, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. How do we distinguish that from</p>
<p>the processes that go on in our brains of, you know, the physical processes that go on in our</p>
<p>brains? How do we separate those? How do we say the physical processes going on that represent</p>
<p>sophisticated computations in the weather, oh, that&rsquo;s not the same as the physical processes</p>
<p>that go on that represent sophisticated computations in our brains? The answer is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is a fundamental distinction. I think the distinction for us is that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a thread of history and so on that connects kind of what happens in different brains</p>
<p>to each other, so to speak. And it&rsquo;s a, you know, what happens in the weather is something which is</p>
<p>not connected by sort of a thread of civilizational history, so to speak, to what we&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>SL. In the stories that the human brains told us, but maybe the weather has its own stories.</p>
<p>MG. Absolutely. Absolutely. And that&rsquo;s where we run into trouble thinking about extraterrestrial</p>
<p>intelligence because, you know, it&rsquo;s like that pulsar magnetosphere that&rsquo;s generating these very</p>
<p>elaborate radio signals. You know, is that something that we should think of as being this</p>
<p>whole civilization that&rsquo;s developed over the last however long, you know, millions of years of</p>
<p>processes going on in the neutron star or whatever versus what, you know, what we&rsquo;re used to in human</p>
<p>intelligence? I mean, I think in the end, you know, when people talk about extraterrestrial</p>
<p>intelligence and where is it and the whole, you know, Fermi paradox of how come there&rsquo;s no other</p>
<p>signs of intelligence in the universe, my guess is that we&rsquo;ve got sort of two alien forms of</p>
<p>intelligence that we&rsquo;re dealing with, artificial intelligence and sort of physical or extraterrestrial</p>
<p>intelligence. And my guess is people will sort of get comfortable with the fact that both of these</p>
<p>have been achieved around the same time. And in other words, people will say, well, yes, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>used to computers, things we&rsquo;ve created, digital things we&rsquo;ve created, being sort of intelligent</p>
<p>like we are. And they&rsquo;ll say, oh, we&rsquo;re kind of also used to the idea that there are things around</p>
<p>the universe that are kind of intelligent like we are, except they don&rsquo;t share the sort of</p>
<p>civilizational history that we have. And so they&rsquo;re a different branch. I mean, it&rsquo;s similar to when</p>
<p>you talk about life, for instance. I mean, you kind of said life form, I think almost synonymously</p>
<p>with intelligence, which I don&rsquo;t think is, you know, the AIs would be upset to hear you equate</p>
<p>those two things. Because I really probably implied biological life. But you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll explore this more, but you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s really a spectrum and it&rsquo;s all just</p>
<p>a kind of computation. And so it&rsquo;s a full spectrum and we just make ourselves special by weaving a</p>
<p>narrative around our particular kinds of computation. Yes. I mean, the thing that I think I&rsquo;ve kind of</p>
<p>come to realize is, you know, at some level, it&rsquo;s a little depressing to realize that there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>little or liberating. Well, yeah, but I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s the story of science,</p>
<p>right? And, you know, from Copernicus on, it&rsquo;s like, you know, first we were like,</p>
<p>convinced our planets at the center of the universe. No, that&rsquo;s not true. Well, then we</p>
<p>were convinced there&rsquo;s something very special about the chemistry that we have as biological</p>
<p>organisms. That&rsquo;s not really true. And then we&rsquo;re still holding out that hope. Oh, this intelligence</p>
<p>thing we have, that&rsquo;s really special. I don&rsquo;t think it is. However, in a sense, as you say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of liberating for the following reason, that you realize that what&rsquo;s special is the</p>
<p>details of us, not some abstract attribute that, you know, we could wonder, oh, is something else</p>
<p>going to come along and, you know, also have that abstract attribute? Well, yes, every abstract</p>
<p>attribute we have, something else has it. But the full details of our kind of history of our</p>
<p>civilization and so on, nothing else has that. That&rsquo;s what, you know, that&rsquo;s our story, so to</p>
<p>speak. And that&rsquo;s sort of almost by definition, special. So I view it as not being such a, I mean,</p>
<p>initially I was like, this is bad. This is kind of, you know, how can we have self respect about</p>
<p>the things that we do? Then I realized the details of the things we do, they are the story.</p>
<p>Everything else is kind of a blank canvas. So maybe on a small tangent, you just made me</p>
<p>think of it, but what do you make of the monoliths in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of</p>
<p>aliens communicating with us and sparking the kind of particular intelligent computation that</p>
<p>we humans have? Is there anything interesting to get from that sci fi? Yeah, I mean, I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fun about that is, you know, the monoliths are these, you know, one to four to nine perfect</p>
<p>cuboid things. And in the Earth a million years ago, whatever they were portraying with a bunch</p>
<p>of apes and so on, a thing that has that level of perfection seems out of place. It seems very kind</p>
<p>of constructed, very engineered. So that&rsquo;s an interesting question. What is the, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the techno signature, so to speak? What is it that you see it somewhere and you say,</p>
<p>my gosh, that had to be engineered. Now, the fact is we see crystals, which are also very perfect.</p>
<p>And, you know, the perfect ones are very perfect. They&rsquo;re nice polyhedral or whatever.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, if you say, well, it&rsquo;s a sign of sort of it&rsquo;s a techno signature that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a perfect polygonal shape, polyhedral shape. That&rsquo;s not true. And so then it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question. What is the right signature? I mean, like, you know, Gauss, famous mathematician,</p>
<p>you know, he had this idea, you should cut down the Siberian forest in the shape of sort of a</p>
<p>typical image of the proof of the Pythagorean theorem on the grounds that it was a kind of</p>
<p>cool idea, didn&rsquo;t get done. But, you know, it&rsquo;s on the grounds that the Martians would see that and</p>
<p>realize, gosh, there are mathematicians out there. It&rsquo;s kind of, you know, in his theory of the world,</p>
<p>that was probably the best advertisement for the cultural achievements of our species.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s a reasonable question. What do you, what can you send or create that is a sign</p>
<p>of intelligence in its creation or even intention in its creation? You talk about if we were to send</p>
<p>a beacon. Can you what should we send? Is math our greatest creation? Is what is our greatest</p>
<p>creation? I think I think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a philosophically doomed issue. I mean, in other</p>
<p>words, you send something, you think it&rsquo;s fantastic, but it&rsquo;s kind of like we are part of</p>
<p>the universe. We make things that are, you know, things that happen in the universe.</p>
<p>Computation, which is sort of the thing that we are in some abstract sense using to create all</p>
<p>these elaborate things we create, is surprisingly ubiquitous. In other words, we might have thought</p>
<p>that, you know, we&rsquo;ve built this whole giant engineering stack that&rsquo;s led us to microprocessors,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s led us to be able to do elaborate computations. But this idea that computations</p>
<p>are happening all over the place. The only question is whether whether there&rsquo;s a thread that connects</p>
<p>our human intentions to what those computations are. And so I think I think this question of what</p>
<p>do you send to kind of show off our civilization in the best possible way? I think any kind of</p>
<p>almost random slab of stuff we&rsquo;ve produced is about equivalent to everything else. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of these things where it&rsquo;s a non romantic way of phrasing it. I just started to interrupt,</p>
<p>but I just talked to Andrew in who&rsquo;s the wife of Carl Sagan. And so I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>familiar with the Voyager. I mean, she was part of sending, I think, brainwaves of, you know,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t it hers? Her brainwaves when she was first falling in love with Carl Sagan. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this beautiful story that perhaps you would shut down the power of that by saying we might</p>
<p>as well send anything else. And that&rsquo;s interesting. All of it is kind of an interesting, peculiar</p>
<p>thing. Yeah, yeah, right. Well, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to see on the Voyager,</p>
<p>you know, golden record thing. One of the things that&rsquo;s kind of cute about that is, you know,</p>
<p>it was made when was it in the late 70s, early 80s. And, you know, one of the things, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>phonograph record. Okay. And it has a diagram of how to play a phonograph record. And, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like it&rsquo;s shocking that in just 30 years, if you show that to a random kid of today,</p>
<p>and you show them that diagram, I&rsquo;ve tried this experiment, they&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t know what the</p>
<p>heck this is. And the best anybody can think of is, you know, take the whole record, forget the</p>
<p>fact that it has some kind of helical track in it, just image the whole thing and see what&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we would do today. In only 30 years, our technology has kind of advanced to the point</p>
<p>where the playing of a helical, you know, mechanical track on a phonograph record is now</p>
<p>something bizarre. So, you know, it&rsquo;s a cautionary tale, I would say, in terms of the ability to make</p>
<p>something that in detail sort of leads by the nose, some, you know, the aliens or whatever,</p>
<p>to do something. It&rsquo;s like, no, you know, best you can do, as I say, if we were doing this today,</p>
<p>we would not build a helical scan thing with a needle. We would just take some high resolution</p>
<p>imaging system and get all the bits off it and say, oh, it&rsquo;s a big nuisance that they put in a</p>
<p>helix, you know, in a spiral. Let&rsquo;s just unravel the spiral and start from there.</p>
<p>SL. Do you think, and this will get into trying to figure out interpretability of AI,</p>
<p>interpretability of computation, being able to communicate with various kinds of computations,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;d be able to, if you put your alien hat on, figure out this record,</p>
<p>how to play this record?</p>
<p>MG. Well, it&rsquo;s a question of what one wants to do. I mean,</p>
<p>SL. Understand what the other party was trying to communicate or understand anything about the</p>
<p>other party.</p>
<p>MG. What does understanding mean? I mean, that&rsquo;s the issue. The issue is, it&rsquo;s like when people</p>
<p>were trying to do natural language understanding for computers, right? So people tried to do that</p>
<p>for years. It wasn&rsquo;t clear what it meant. In other words, you take your piece of English or whatever,</p>
<p>and you say, gosh, my computer has understood this. Okay, that&rsquo;s nice. What can you do with that?</p>
<p>Well, so for example, when we built WolfMalpha, one of the things was it&rsquo;s doing question answering</p>
<p>and so on, and it needs to do natural language understanding. The reason that I realized after</p>
<p>the fact, the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite well, and people</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t before, the number one thing was we had an actual objective for the natural language</p>
<p>understanding. We were trying to turn the natural language into this computational language</p>
<p>that we could then do things with. Now, similarly, when you imagine your alien, you say,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re playing them the record. Did they understand it? Well, it depends what you mean.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a representation that they have, if it converts to some representation where we can say,</p>
<p>oh yes, that&rsquo;s a representation that we can recognize is represents understanding, then all</p>
<p>well and good. But actually, the only ones that I think we can say would represent understanding</p>
<p>are ones that will then do things that we humans kind of recognize as being useful to us.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re trying to understand, quantify how technologically advanced this particular</p>
<p>civilization is. So are they a threat to us from a military perspective? That&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>first kind of understanding they&rsquo;ll be interested in. Gosh, that&rsquo;s so hard. That&rsquo;s like in the</p>
<p>Arrival movie, that was one of the key questions is, why are you here, so to speak? Are you going</p>
<p>to hurt us? But even that, it&rsquo;s very unclear. It&rsquo;s like, are you going to hurt us? That comes</p>
<p>back to a lot of interesting AI ethics questions, because we might make an AI that says, well,</p>
<p>take autonomous cars, for instance. Are you going to hurt us? Well, let&rsquo;s make sure you only drive</p>
<p>at precisely the speed limit, because we want to make sure we don&rsquo;t hurt you, so to speak.</p>
<p>But you say, but actually, that means I&rsquo;m going to be really late for this thing, and</p>
<p>that sort of hurts me in some way. So it&rsquo;s hard to know. Even the definition of what it means to</p>
<p>hurt someone is unclear. And as we start thinking about things about AI ethics and so on, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something one has to address. There&rsquo;s always tradeoffs, and that&rsquo;s the annoying thing about</p>
<p>ethics. Yeah, well, right. And I think ethics, like these other things we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>is a deeply human thing. There&rsquo;s no abstract, let&rsquo;s write down the theorem that proves that</p>
<p>this is ethically correct. That&rsquo;s a meaningless idea. You have to have a ground truth, so to</p>
<p>speak, that&rsquo;s ultimately what humans want, and they don&rsquo;t all want the same thing. So that gives</p>
<p>one all kinds of additional complexity in thinking about that. One convenient thing in terms of</p>
<p>turning ethics into computation, you can ask the question of what maximizes the likelihood of the</p>
<p>survival of the species. That&rsquo;s a good existential issue. But then when you say survival of the</p>
<p>species, you might say, you might, for example, let&rsquo;s say, forget about technology, just hang out</p>
<p>and be happy, live our lives, go on to the next generation, go through many, many generations</p>
<p>where, in a sense, nothing is happening. Is that okay? Is that not okay? Hard to know. In terms of</p>
<p>the attempt to do elaborate things and the attempt to might be counterproductive for the survival of</p>
<p>the species. It&rsquo;s also a little bit hard to know, so okay, let&rsquo;s take that as a sort of thought</p>
<p>experiment. You can say, well, what are the threats that we might have to survive? The</p>
<p>super volcano, the asteroid impact, all these kinds of things. Okay, so now we inventory these</p>
<p>possible threats and we say, let&rsquo;s make our species as robust as possible relative to all</p>
<p>these threats. I think in the end, it&rsquo;s sort of an unknowable thing what it takes. So given that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this AI and you&rsquo;ve told it, maximize the long term. What does long term mean? Does</p>
<p>long term mean until the sun burns out? That&rsquo;s not going to work. Does long term mean next thousand</p>
<p>years? Okay, they&rsquo;re probably optimizations for the next thousand years. It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running a company, you can make a company be very stable for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Like if your company gets bought by some private investment group, then you can run a company just</p>
<p>fine for five years by just taking what it does and removing all R&amp;D and the company will burn</p>
<p>out after a while, but it&rsquo;ll run just fine for a little while. So if you tell the AI, keep the</p>
<p>humans okay for a thousand years, there&rsquo;s probably a certain set of things that one would do to</p>
<p>optimize that, many of which one might say, well, that would be a pretty big shame for the future of</p>
<p>history, so to speak, for that to be what happens. But I think in the end, as you start thinking</p>
<p>about that question, what you realize is there&rsquo;s a whole sort of raft of undecidability, computational</p>
<p>irreducibility. In other words, one of the good things about what our civilization has gone</p>
<p>through and what we humans go through is that there&rsquo;s a certain computational irreducibility</p>
<p>to it in the sense that it isn&rsquo;t the case that you can look from the outside and just say,</p>
<p>the answer is going to be this. At the end of the day, this is what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>You actually have to go through the process to find out. And I think that feels better in the</p>
<p>sense that something is achieved by going through all of this process. But it also means</p>
<p>that telling the AI, go figure out what will be the best outcome. Well, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to come back and say, it&rsquo;s kind of undecidable what to do. We&rsquo;d have to run all of those scenarios</p>
<p>to see what happens. And if we want it for the infinite future, we&rsquo;re thrown immediately into</p>
<p>sort of standard issues of kind of infinite computation and so on. So yeah, even if you</p>
<p>get that the answer to the universe and everything is 42, you still have to actually run the universe.</p>
<p>Yes, to figure out the question, I guess, or the journey is the point.</p>
<p>Right. Well, I think it&rsquo;s saying to summarize, this is the result of the universe. If that is</p>
<p>possible, it tells us, I mean, the whole sort of structure of thinking about computation and so on</p>
<p>and thinking about how stuff works. If it&rsquo;s possible to say, and the answer is such and such,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically saying there&rsquo;s a way of going outside the universe. And you&rsquo;re getting yourself</p>
<p>into something of a sort of paradox because you&rsquo;re saying, if it&rsquo;s knowable what the answer is, then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way to know it that is beyond what the universe provides. But if we can know it, then</p>
<p>something that we&rsquo;re dealing with is beyond the universe. So then the universe isn&rsquo;t the universe,</p>
<p>so to speak. And in general, as we&rsquo;ll talk about, at least for our small human brains, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to show the result of a sufficiently complex computation. I mean, it&rsquo;s probably impossible,</p>
<p>right, on this side ability. And the universe appears by at least the poets to be sufficiently</p>
<p>complex. They won&rsquo;t be able to predict what the heck it&rsquo;s all going to. Well, we better not be</p>
<p>able to, because if we can, it kind of denies. I mean, it&rsquo;s you know, we&rsquo;re part of the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah. So what does it mean for us to predict? It means that we that our little part of the universe</p>
<p>is able to jump ahead of the whole universe. And this this quickly winds up. I mean, that it is</p>
<p>conceivable. The only way we&rsquo;d be able to predict is if we are so special in the universe, we are</p>
<p>the one place where there is computation more special, more sophisticated than anything else</p>
<p>that exists in the universe. That&rsquo;s the only way we would have the ability to sort of the almost</p>
<p>theological ability, so to speak, to predict what happens in the universe is to say somehow we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>better than everything else in the universe, which I don&rsquo;t think is the case. Yeah, perhaps we can</p>
<p>detect a large number of looping patterns that reoccur throughout the universe and fully describe</p>
<p>them. And therefore, but then it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those patterns</p>
<p>interact and what kind of well, look, the most remarkable thing about the universe is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>has regularity at all. Might not be the case. If you just have regularity, do you? Absolutely.</p>
<p>That fits full of I mean, physics is successful. You know, it&rsquo;s full of of laws that tell us a lot</p>
<p>of detail about how the universe works. I mean, it could be the case that, you know, the 10 to the</p>
<p>90th particles in the universe, they will do their own thing, but they don&rsquo;t. They all follow. We</p>
<p>already know they all follow basically physical, the same physical laws. And that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very profound fact about the universe. What conclusion you draw from that is unclear. I</p>
<p>mean, in the, you know, the early early theologians, that was, you know, exhibit number one for the</p>
<p>existence of God. Now, you know, people have different conclusions about it. But the fact is,</p>
<p>you know, right now, I mean, I happen to be interested, actually, I&rsquo;ve just restarted a</p>
<p>long running kind of interest of mine about fundamental physics. I&rsquo;m kind of like, come on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a bit of a quest, which I&rsquo;m about to make more public, to see if I can actually find the</p>
<p>fundamental theory of physics. Excellent. We&rsquo;ll come to that. And I just had a lot of conversations</p>
<p>with quantum mechanics folks with so I&rsquo;m really excited on your take, because I think you have a</p>
<p>fascinating take on the the fundamental nature of our reality from a physics perspective. So</p>
<p>and what might be underlying the kind of physics as we think of it today. Okay, let&rsquo;s take a step</p>
<p>back. What is computation? It&rsquo;s a good question. Operationally, computation is following rules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of it. I mean, computation is the result is the process of systematically following</p>
<p>rules. And it is the thing that happens when you do that. So taking initial conditions are taking</p>
<p>inputs and following rules. I mean, what are you following rules on? So there has to be some data,</p>
<p>some unnecessarily, it can be something where there&rsquo;s a, you know, very simple input. And then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re following these rules. And you&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s not really much data going into this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you could actually pack the initial conditions into the rule, if you want to. So I think the</p>
<p>question is, is there a robust notion of computation? That is, what does robust mean?</p>
<p>What I mean by that is something like this. So So one of the things in a different in another</p>
<p>physics, something like energy, okay, the different forms of energy, there&rsquo;s, but somehow energy is a</p>
<p>robust concept that doesn&rsquo;t, isn&rsquo;t particular to kinetic energy, or, you know, nuclear energy,</p>
<p>or whatever else, there&rsquo;s a robust idea of energy. So one of the things you might ask is,</p>
<p>is the robust idea of computation? Or does it matter that this computation is running in a</p>
<p>Turing machine? This computation is running in a, you know, CMOS, silicon, CPU, this computation is</p>
<p>running in a fluid system in the weather, those kinds of things? Or is there a robust idea of</p>
<p>computation that transcends the sort of detailed framework that it&rsquo;s running in? Okay. And is there?</p>
<p>Yes. I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t obvious that there was. So it&rsquo;s worth understanding the history and how we</p>
<p>got to where we are right now. Because, you know, to say that there is, is a statement in part about</p>
<p>our universe. It&rsquo;s not a statement about what is mathematically conceivable. It&rsquo;s about what</p>
<p>actually can exist for us. Maybe you can also comment because energy, as a concept is robust.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also its intricate, complicated relationship with matter, with mass, is very</p>
<p>interesting, of particles that carry force and particles that sort of particles that carry force</p>
<p>and particles that have mass. These kinds of ideas, they seem to map to each other, at least</p>
<p>in the mathematical sense. Is there a connection between energy and mass and computation? Or are</p>
<p>these completely disjoint ideas? We don&rsquo;t know yet. The things that I&rsquo;m trying to do about fundamental</p>
<p>physics may well lead to such a connection, but there is no known connection at this time.</p>
<p>So can you elaborate a little bit more on what, how do you think about computation? What is</p>
<p>computation? What is computation? Yeah. So I mean, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s tell a little bit of a historical</p>
<p>story. Okay. So, you know, back, go back 150 years, people were making mechanical calculators of</p>
<p>various kinds. And, you know, the typical thing was you want an adding machine, you go to the</p>
<p>adding machine store, basically, you want a multiplying machine, you go to the multiplying</p>
<p>machine store, they&rsquo;re different pieces of hardware. And so that means that, at least at the</p>
<p>level of that kind of computation, and those kinds of pieces of hardware, there isn&rsquo;t a robust notion</p>
<p>of computation, there&rsquo;s the adding machine kind of computation, there&rsquo;s the multiplying machine</p>
<p>notion of computation, and they&rsquo;re disjoint. So what happened in around 1900, people started</p>
<p>imagining, particularly in the context of mathematical logic, could you have something</p>
<p>which would be represent any reasonable function, right? And they came up with things, this idea of</p>
<p>primitive recursion was one of the early ideas. And it didn&rsquo;t work. There were reasonable functions</p>
<p>that people could come up with that were not represented using the primitives of primitive</p>
<p>recursion. Okay, so then, then along comes 1931, and Godel&rsquo;s theorem, and so on. And as in looking</p>
<p>back, one can see that as part of the process of establishing Godel&rsquo;s theorem, Godel basically</p>
<p>showed how you could compile arithmetic, how you could basically compile logical statements like</p>
<p>this statement is unprovable into arithmetic. So what he essentially did was to show that</p>
<p>arithmetic can be a computer in a sense that&rsquo;s capable of representing all kinds of other things.</p>
<p>And then Turing came along 1936, came up with Turing machines. Meanwhile, Alonzo Church had</p>
<p>come up with lambda calculus. And the surprising thing that was established very quickly is the</p>
<p>Turing machine idea about what might be what computation might be is exactly the same as the</p>
<p>lambda calculus idea of what computation might be. And so, and then there started to be other ideas,</p>
<p>you know, register machines, other kinds of other kinds of representations of computation.</p>
<p>And the big surprise was, they all turned out to be equivalent. So in other words, it might have</p>
<p>been the case, like those old adding machines and multiplying machines, that, you know, Turing had</p>
<p>his idea of computation, Church had his idea of computation, and they were just different. But it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t true. They&rsquo;re actually all equivalent. So then by, I would say the 1970s or so in sort of</p>
<p>the computation, computer science, computation theory area, people had sort of said, oh,</p>
<p>Turing machines are kind of what computation is. Physicists were still holding out saying, no,</p>
<p>no, no, that&rsquo;s just not how the universe works. We&rsquo;ve got all these differential equations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got all these real numbers that have infinite numbers of digits.</p>
<p>The universe is not a Turing machine.</p>
<p>Right. The, you know, the Turing machines are a small subset of the things that we make in</p>
<p>microprocessors and engineering structures and so on. So probably actually through my work in the</p>
<p>1980s about sort of the relationship between computation and models of physics, it became a</p>
<p>little less clear that there would be, that there was this big sort of dichotomy between what can</p>
<p>happen in physics and what happens in things like Turing machines. And I think probably by now people</p>
<p>would mostly think, and by the way, brains were another kind of element of this. I mean, you know,</p>
<p>G√∂del didn&rsquo;t think that his notion of computation or what amounted to his notion of computation</p>
<p>would cover brains. And Turing wasn&rsquo;t sure either. But although he was a little bit,</p>
<p>he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brains. But I would say by probably</p>
<p>sometime in the 1980s, there was beginning to be sort of a general belief that yes, this notion</p>
<p>of computation that could be captured by things like Turing machines was reasonably robust.</p>
<p>Now, the next question is, okay, you can have a universal Turing machine that&rsquo;s capable of</p>
<p>being programmed to do anything that any Turing machine can do. And, you know, this idea of</p>
<p>universal computation, it&rsquo;s an important idea, this idea that you can have one piece of hardware</p>
<p>and program it with different pieces of software. You know, that&rsquo;s kind of the idea that launched</p>
<p>most modern technology. I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s the idea that launched computer revolution</p>
<p>software, etc. So important idea. But the thing that&rsquo;s still kind of holding out from that idea</p>
<p>is, okay, there is this universal computation thing, but seems hard to get to. It seems like</p>
<p>you want to make a universal computer, you have to kind of have a microprocessor with, you know,</p>
<p>a million gates in it, and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that achieves that</p>
<p>level of computational sophistication. Okay, so the surprise for me was that stuff that I discovered</p>
<p>in the early 80s, looking at these things called cellular automata, which are really simple</p>
<p>computational systems, the thing that was a big surprise to me was that even when their rules were</p>
<p>very, very simple, they were doing things that were as sophisticated as they did when their rules</p>
<p>were much more complicated. So it didn&rsquo;t look like, you know, this idea, oh, to get sophisticated</p>
<p>computation, you have to build something with very sophisticated rules. That idea didn&rsquo;t seem to pan</p>
<p>out. And instead, it seemed to be the case that sophisticated computation was completely ubiquitous,</p>
<p>even in systems with incredibly simple rules. And so that led to this thing that I call the</p>
<p>principle of computational equivalence, which basically says, when you have a system that</p>
<p>follows rules of any kind, then whenever the system isn&rsquo;t doing things that are, in some sense,</p>
<p>obviously simple, then the computation that the behavior of the system corresponds to is of</p>
<p>equivalence sophistication. So that means that when you kind of go from the very, very, very</p>
<p>simplest things you can imagine, then quite quickly, you hit this kind of threshold above</p>
<p>which everything is equivalent in its computational sophistication. Not obvious that would be the case.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a science fact. Well, no, hold on a second. So this you&rsquo;ve opened with a new kind</p>
<p>of science. I mean, I remember it was a huge eye opener that such simple things can create such</p>
<p>complexity. And yes, there&rsquo;s an equivalence, but it&rsquo;s not a fact. It just appears to, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as much as a fact as sort of these theories are so elegant that it seems to be the way things</p>
<p>are. But let me ask sort of, you just brought up previously, kind of like the communities of</p>
<p>computer scientists with their Turing machines, the physicists with their universe, and whoever</p>
<p>the heck, maybe neuroscientists looking at the brain. What&rsquo;s your sense in the equivalence?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve shown through your work that simple rules can create equivalently complex Turing machine</p>
<p>systems, right? Is the universe equivalent to the kinds of Turing machines? Is the human brain</p>
<p>a kind of Turing machine? Do you see those things basically blending together? Or is there still a</p>
<p>mystery about how disjoint they are? Well, my guess is that they all blend together, but we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that for sure yet. I mean, this, you know, I should say, I said rather glibly that the principle of</p>
<p>computational equivalence is sort of a science fact. And I was using air quotes for the science fact,</p>
<p>because when you, it is a, I mean, just to talk about that for a second. The thing is that it has</p>
<p>a complicated epistemological character, similar to things like the second law of thermodynamics,</p>
<p>the law of entropy increase. What is the second law of thermodynamics? Is it a law of nature? Is</p>
<p>it a thing that is true of the physical world? Is it something which is mathematically provable? Is</p>
<p>it something which happens to be true of the systems that we see in the world? Is it, in some</p>
<p>sense, a definition of heat, perhaps? Well, it&rsquo;s a combination of those things. And it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with the principle of computational equivalence. And in some sense, the principle</p>
<p>of computational equivalence is at the heart of the definition of computation, because it&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>you there is a thing, there is a robust notion that is equivalent across all these systems and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t depend on the details of each individual system. And that&rsquo;s why we can meaningfully talk</p>
<p>about a thing called computation. And we&rsquo;re not stuck talking about, oh, there&rsquo;s computation in</p>
<p>Turing machine number 3785, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That&rsquo;s why there is a robust</p>
<p>notion like that. Now, on the other hand, can we prove the principle of computational equivalence?</p>
<p>Can we prove it as a mathematical result? Well, the answer is, actually, we&rsquo;ve got some nice results</p>
<p>along those lines that say, throw me a random system with very simple rules. Well, in a couple</p>
<p>of cases, we now know that even the very simplest rules we can imagine of a certain type are</p>
<p>universal and do follow what you would expect from the principle of computational equivalence. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a nice piece of sort of mathematical evidence for the principle of computational equivalence.</p>
<p>Just to link on that point, the simple rules creating sort of these complex behaviors. But</p>
<p>is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is complex? That you&rsquo;ve mentioned that</p>
<p>you cross a threshold. Right. So there are various indicators. So, for example, one thing would be,</p>
<p>is it capable of universal computation? That is, given the system, do there exist initial</p>
<p>conditions for the system that can be set up to essentially represent programs to do anything you</p>
<p>want, to compute primes, to compute pi, to do whatever you want? Right. So that&rsquo;s an indicator.</p>
<p>So we know in a couple of examples that, yes, the simplest candidates that could conceivably have</p>
<p>that property do have that property. And that&rsquo;s what the principle of computational equivalence</p>
<p>might suggest. But this principle of computational equivalence, one question about it is, is it true</p>
<p>for the physical world? It might be true for all these things we come up with, the Turing machines,</p>
<p>the cellular automata, whatever else. Is it true for our actual physical world? Is it true for the</p>
<p>brains, which are an element of the physical world? We don&rsquo;t know for sure. And that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>type of question that we will have a definitive answer to, because there&rsquo;s a sort of scientific</p>
<p>induction issue. You can say, well, it&rsquo;s true for all these brains, but this person over here is</p>
<p>really special, and it&rsquo;s not true for them. And the only way that that cannot be what happens is</p>
<p>if we finally nail it and actually get a fundamental theory for physics, and it turns out</p>
<p>to correspond to, let&rsquo;s say, a simple program. If that is the case, then we will basically have</p>
<p>reduced physics to a branch of mathematics, in the sense that we will not be, you know,</p>
<p>right now with physics, we&rsquo;re like, well, this is the theory that, you know, this is the rules that</p>
<p>apply here. But in the middle of that, you know, right by that black hole, maybe these rules don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>apply and something else applies. And there may be another piece of the onion that we have to peel</p>
<p>back. But if we can get to the point where we actually have, this is the fundamental theory of</p>
<p>physics, here it is, it&rsquo;s this program, run this program, and you will get our universe, then we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>kind of reduced the problem of figuring out things in physics to a problem of doing some, what turns</p>
<p>out to be very difficult, irreducibly difficult, mathematical problems. But it no longer is the</p>
<p>case that we can say that somebody can come in and say, whoops, you know, you will write about</p>
<p>all these things about Turing machines, but you&rsquo;re wrong about the physical universe, we know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of ground truth about what&rsquo;s happening in the physical universe. Now, I happen to think,</p>
<p>I mean, you asked me at an interesting time, because I&rsquo;m just in the middle of starting to</p>
<p>to re energize my, my project to kind of study fundamental theory of physics. As of today, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very optimistic that we&rsquo;re actually going to find something and that it&rsquo;s going to be possible to</p>
<p>to see that the universe really is computational in that sense. But I don&rsquo;t know, because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>betting against, you know, we&rsquo;re betting against the universe, so to speak. And I didn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, you know, when I spend a lot of my life building technology, and then I know what</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in there, right? And it&rsquo;s there may be, it may have unexpected behavior, may have bugs,</p>
<p>things like that. But fundamentally, I know what&rsquo;s in there for the universe. I&rsquo;m not in</p>
<p>that position, so to speak. What kind of computation do you think the fundamental laws of</p>
<p>physics might emerge from? Just to clarify, so you&rsquo;ve done a lot of fascinating work with kind</p>
<p>of discrete kinds of computation that, you know, you can sell your automata, and we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>it, have this very clean structures, it&rsquo;s such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules</p>
<p>can create immense complexity. But what kind, you know, is that actually, are cellular automata</p>
<p>sufficiently general to describe the kinds of computation that might create the laws of physics?</p>
<p>Just to give, can you give a sense of what kind of computation do you think would create?</p>
<p>Well, so this is a slightly complicated issue, because as soon as you have universal</p>
<p>computation, you can, in principle, simulate anything with anything.</p>
<p>Right. But it is not a natural thing to do. And if you&rsquo;re asking, were you to try to find our</p>
<p>physical universe by looking at possible programs in the computational universe of all possible</p>
<p>programs, would the ones that correspond to our universe be small and simple enough that we might</p>
<p>find them by searching that computational universe? We got to have the right basis, so to speak. We</p>
<p>have to have the right language, in effect, for describing computation for that to be feasible.</p>
<p>So the thing that I&rsquo;ve been interested in for a long time is, what are the most structuralist</p>
<p>structures that we can create with computation? So in other words, if you say a cellular automaton,</p>
<p>it has a bunch of cells that are arrayed on a grid, and it&rsquo;s very, you know, and every cell is</p>
<p>updated in synchrony at a particular, you know, when there&rsquo;s a click of a clock, so to speak,</p>
<p>and it goes a tick of a clock, and every cell gets updated at the same time. That&rsquo;s a very specific</p>
<p>very rigid kind of thing. But my guess is that when we look at physics, and we look at things</p>
<p>like space and time, that what&rsquo;s underneath space and time is something as structuralist as possible,</p>
<p>that what we see, what emerges for us as physical space, for example, comes from something that is</p>
<p>sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath. And so I&rsquo;ve been for a long time interested in kind</p>
<p>of what are the most structuralist structures that we can set up. And actually, what I had thought</p>
<p>about for ages is using graphs, networks, where essentially, so let&rsquo;s talk about space, for</p>
<p>example. So what is space? It&rsquo;s a kind of a question one might ask. Back in the early days</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics, for example, people said, oh, for sure, space is going to be discrete,</p>
<p>because all these other things we&rsquo;re finding are discrete. But that never worked out in physics.</p>
<p>And so space in physics today is always treated as this continuous thing, just like Euclid</p>
<p>imagined it. I mean, the very first thing Euclid says in his sort of common notions is,</p>
<p>you know, a point is something which has no part. In other words, there are points that are</p>
<p>arbitrarily small, and there&rsquo;s a continuum of possible positions of points. And the question</p>
<p>is, is that true? And so for example, if we look at, I don&rsquo;t know, fluid like air or water,</p>
<p>we might say, oh, it&rsquo;s a continuous fluid. We can pour it, we can do all kinds of things continuously.</p>
<p>But actually, we know, because we know the physics of it, that it consists of a bunch</p>
<p>of discrete molecules bouncing around, and only in the aggregate is it behaving like a continuum.</p>
<p>And so the possibility exists that that&rsquo;s true of space too. People haven&rsquo;t managed to make that</p>
<p>work with existing frameworks in physics. But I&rsquo;ve been interested in whether one can imagine that</p>
<p>underneath space, and also underneath time, is something more structureless. And the question is,</p>
<p>is it computational? So there are a couple of possibilities. It could be computational,</p>
<p>somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing machine, or it could be fundamentally not. So</p>
<p>how could it not be? It could not be, so a Turing machine essentially deals with integers, whole</p>
<p>numbers, at some level. And you know, it can do things like it can add one to a number, it can do</p>
<p>things like this. And it can also store whatever the heck it did. Yes, it has an infinite storage.</p>
<p>But when one thinks about doing physics, or sort of idealized physics, or idealized mathematics,</p>
<p>one can deal with real numbers, numbers with an infinite number of digits, numbers which are</p>
<p>absolutely precise. And one can say, we can take this number and we can multiply it by itself.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable with infinity?</p>
<p>In this context? Are you comfortable in the context of computation? Do you think infinity</p>
<p>plays a part? I think that the role of infinity is complicated. Infinity is useful in conceptualizing</p>
<p>things. It&rsquo;s not actualizable. Almost by definition, it&rsquo;s not actualizable. But do you</p>
<p>think infinity is part of the thing that might underlie the laws of physics? I think that no.</p>
<p>I think there are many questions that you ask about, you might ask about physics, which inevitably</p>
<p>involve infinity. Like when you say, you know, is faster than light travel possible? You could say,</p>
<p>given the laws of physics, can you make something even arbitrarily large, even quote, infinitely</p>
<p>large, that will make faster than light travel possible? Then you&rsquo;re thrown into dealing with</p>
<p>infinity as a kind of theoretical question. But I mean, talking about sort of what&rsquo;s underneath</p>
<p>space and time and how one can make a computational infrastructure, one possibility is that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make a computational infrastructure in a Turing machine sense, that you really have to be dealing</p>
<p>with precise real numbers. You&rsquo;re dealing with partial differential equations, which have</p>
<p>precise real numbers at arbitrarily closely separated points. You have a continuum for</p>
<p>everything. Could be that that&rsquo;s what happens, that there&rsquo;s sort of a continuum for everything</p>
<p>and precise real numbers for everything. And then the things I&rsquo;m thinking about are wrong.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the risk you take if you&rsquo;re trying to sort of do things about nature,</p>
<p>is you might just be wrong. For me personally, it&rsquo;s kind of a strange thing. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot</p>
<p>of my life building technology where you can do something that nobody cares about,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t be sort of wrong in that sense, in the sense you build your technology and it does</p>
<p>what it does. But I think this question of what the sort of underlying computational</p>
<p>infrastructure for the universe might be, it&rsquo;s sort of inevitable it&rsquo;s going to be fairly abstract,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re going to get all these things like there are three dimensions of space,</p>
<p>there are electrons, there are muons, there are quarks, there are this, you don&rsquo;t get to,</p>
<p>if the model for the universe is simple, you don&rsquo;t get to have sort of a line of code for</p>
<p>each of those things. You don&rsquo;t get to have sort of the muon case, the tau lepton case and so on.</p>
<p>Because they all have to be emergent somehow, something deeper.</p>
<p>Right. So that means it&rsquo;s sort of inevitable, it&rsquo;s a little hard to talk about</p>
<p>what the sort of underlying structuralist structure actually is.</p>
<p>Do you think human beings have the cognitive capacity to understand, if we&rsquo;re to discover it,</p>
<p>to understand the kinds of simple structure from which these laws can emerge?</p>
<p>Like, do you think that&rsquo;s a good question?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what I think. I think that, I mean, I&rsquo;m right in the middle of this right now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you that I think this, yeah, I mean, this human has a hard time understanding,</p>
<p>you know, a bunch of the things that are going on. But what happens in understanding is</p>
<p>one builds waypoints. I mean, if you said understand modern 21st century mathematics,</p>
<p>starting from, you know, counting back in, you know, whenever counting was invented 50,000 years</p>
<p>ago, whatever it was, right, that would be really difficult. But what happens is we build waypoints</p>
<p>that allow us to get to higher levels of understanding. And we see the same thing</p>
<p>happening in language. You know, when we invent a word for something, it provides kind of a cognitive</p>
<p>anchor, a kind of a waypoint that lets us, you know, like a podcast or something. You could be</p>
<p>explaining, well, it&rsquo;s a thing which works this way, that way, the other way. But as soon as you</p>
<p>have the word podcast and people kind of societally understand it, you start to be able to build on</p>
<p>top of that. And so I think that&rsquo;s kind of the story of science actually, too. I mean, science</p>
<p>is about building these kind of waypoints where we find this sort of cognitive mechanism for</p>
<p>understanding something, then we can build on top of it. You know, we have the idea of, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, differential equations we can build on top of that. We have this idea, that idea. So my hope</p>
<p>is that if it is the case that we have to go all the way sort of from the sand to the computer,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no waypoints in between, then we&rsquo;re toast. We won&rsquo;t be able to do that.</p>
<p>Well, eventually we might. So if we&rsquo;re as clever apes are good enough at building those abstract</p>
<p>abstractions, eventually from sand we&rsquo;ll get to the computer, right? And it just might be a longer</p>
<p>journey. The question is whether it is something that you asked, whether our human brains will</p>
<p>quote, understand what&rsquo;s going on. And that&rsquo;s a different question because for that, it requires</p>
<p>steps from which we can construct a human understandable narrative. And that&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>I think I am somewhat hopeful that that will be possible. Although, you know, as of literally</p>
<p>today, if you ask me, I&rsquo;m confronted with things that I don&rsquo;t understand very well.</p>
<p>So this is a small pattern in a computation trying to understand the rules under which the</p>
<p>computation functions. And it&rsquo;s an interesting possibility under which kinds of computations</p>
<p>such a creature can understand itself.</p>
<p>My guess is that within, so we didn&rsquo;t talk much about computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a consequence of this principle of computational equivalence. And it&rsquo;s sort of a</p>
<p>core idea that one has to understand, I think, which is question is, you&rsquo;re doing a computation,</p>
<p>you can figure out what happens in the computation just by running every step in the computation and</p>
<p>seeing what happens. Or you can say, let me jump ahead and figure out, you know, have something</p>
<p>smarter that figures out what&rsquo;s going to happen before it actually happens. And a lot of traditional</p>
<p>science has been about that act of computational reducibility. It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ve got these equations,</p>
<p>and we can just solve them, and we can figure out what&rsquo;s going to happen. We don&rsquo;t have to trace</p>
<p>all of those steps, we just jump ahead because we solve these equations.</p>
<p>Okay, so one of the things that is a consequence of the principle of computational equivalence is</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t always get to do that. Many, many systems will be computationally irreducible,</p>
<p>in the sense that the only way to find out what they do is just follow each step and see what</p>
<p>happens. Why is that? Well, if you&rsquo;re saying, well, we, with our brains, we&rsquo;re a lot smarter,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to mess around like the little cellular automaton going through and updating</p>
<p>all those cells. We can just use the power of our brains to jump ahead. But if the principle</p>
<p>of computational equivalence is right, that&rsquo;s not going to be correct, because it means that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s us doing our computation in our brains, there&rsquo;s a little cellular automaton doing its</p>
<p>computation, and the principle of computational equivalence says these two computations are</p>
<p>fundamentally equivalent. So that means we don&rsquo;t get to say we&rsquo;re a lot smarter than the cellular</p>
<p>automaton and jump ahead, because we&rsquo;re just doing computation that&rsquo;s of the same sophistication as</p>
<p>the cellular automaton itself. That&rsquo;s computational reducibility. It&rsquo;s fascinating. And that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really powerful idea. I think that&rsquo;s both depressing and humbling and so on, that we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>we and the cellular automaton are the same. But the question we&rsquo;re talking about, the fundamental</p>
<p>laws of physics, is kind of the reverse question. You&rsquo;re not predicting what&rsquo;s going to happen. You</p>
<p>have to run the universe for that. But saying, can I understand what rules likely generated me?</p>
<p>I understand. But the problem is, to know whether you&rsquo;re right, you have to have some</p>
<p>computational reducibility, because we are embedded in the universe. If the only way to know whether</p>
<p>we get the universe is just to run the universe, we don&rsquo;t get to do that, because it just ran for</p>
<p>14.6 billion years or whatever. And we can&rsquo;t rerun it, so to speak. So we have to hope that</p>
<p>there are pockets of computational reducibility sufficient to be able to say, yes, I can recognize</p>
<p>those are electrons there. And I think that it&rsquo;s a feature of computational irreducibility. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of a mathematical feature that there are always an infinite collection of pockets of</p>
<p>reducibility. The question of whether they land in the right place and whether we can sort of build</p>
<p>a theory based on them is unclear. But to this point about whether we as observers in the universe</p>
<p>built out of the same stuff as the universe can figure out the universe, so to speak, that relies</p>
<p>on these pockets of reducibility. Without the pockets of reducibility, it won&rsquo;t work, can&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But I think this question about how observers operate, it&rsquo;s one of the features of science over</p>
<p>the last 100 years particularly, has been that every time we get more realistic about observers,</p>
<p>we learn a bit more about science. So for example, relativity was all about observers don&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>say what&rsquo;s simultaneous with what. They have to just wait for the light signal to arrive to decide</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s simultaneous. Or for example, in thermodynamics, observers don&rsquo;t get to say the</p>
<p>position of every single molecule in a gas. They can only see the kind of large scale features,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why the second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy increase, and so on works.</p>
<p>If you could see every individual molecule, you wouldn&rsquo;t conclude something about thermodynamics.</p>
<p>You would conclude, oh, these molecules are just all doing these particular things. You wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be able to see this aggregate fact. So I strongly expect that, and in fact, in the theories that I</p>
<p>have, that one has to be more realistic about the computation and other aspects of observers</p>
<p>in order to actually make a correspondence between what we experience. In fact,</p>
<p>my little team and I have a little theory right now about how quantum mechanics may work, which is</p>
<p>a very wonderfully bizarre idea about how the sort of thread of human consciousness</p>
<p>relates to what we observe in the universe. But there&rsquo;s several steps to explain what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about. What do you make of the mess of the observer at the lower level of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>sort of the textbook definition with quantum mechanics kind of says that there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two worlds. One is the world that actually is, and the other is that&rsquo;s observed.</p>
<p>What do you make sense of that? Well, I think actually the ideas we&rsquo;ve recently had might</p>
<p>actually give away into this. I don&rsquo;t know yet. I think it&rsquo;s a mess. The fact is,</p>
<p>one of the things that&rsquo;s interesting, and when people look at these models that I</p>
<p>started talking about 30 years ago now, they say, oh no, that can&rsquo;t possibly be right.</p>
<p>What about quantum mechanics? You say, okay, tell me what is the essence of quantum mechanics? What</p>
<p>do you want me to be able to reproduce to know that I&rsquo;ve got quantum mechanics, so to speak?</p>
<p>Well, and that question comes up. It comes up very operationally actually, because we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing a bunch of stuff with quantum computing. And there are all these companies that say,</p>
<p>we have a quantum computer. And we say, let&rsquo;s connect to your API and let&rsquo;s actually run it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t do that yet. We&rsquo;re not quite ready yet.</p>
<p>And one of the questions that I&rsquo;ve been curious about is, if I have five minutes with a quantum</p>
<p>computer, how can I tell if it&rsquo;s really a quantum computer or whether it&rsquo;s a simulator at the other</p>
<p>end? And it turns out it&rsquo;s really hard. It&rsquo;s like a lot of these questions about what is</p>
<p>intelligence? What&rsquo;s life? It&rsquo;s like, are you really a quantum computer? Yes, exactly. Is it</p>
<p>just a simulation or is it really a quantum computer? Same issue all over again. So this</p>
<p>whole issue about the sort of mathematical structure of quantum mechanics and the completely</p>
<p>separate thing that is our experience in which we think definite things happen, whereas quantum</p>
<p>mechanics doesn&rsquo;t say definite things ever happen. Quantum mechanics is all about the amplitudes for</p>
<p>different things to happen, but yet our thread of consciousness operates as if definite things</p>
<p>are happening. Dilinga, on the point, you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned the structure that could</p>
<p>underlie everything and this idea that it could perhaps have something like a structure of a graph.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate why your intuition is that there&rsquo;s a graph structure of nodes and edges</p>
<p>and what it might represent? Right. Okay. So the question is, what is, in a sense,</p>
<p>the most structuralist structure you can imagine, right? And in fact, what I&rsquo;ve recently realized</p>
<p>in the last year or so, I have a new most structuralist structure. By the way, the question</p>
<p>itself is a beautiful one and a powerful one in itself. So even without an answer, just the</p>
<p>question is a really strong question. Right. But what&rsquo;s your new idea? Well, it has to do with</p>
<p>hypergraphs. Essentially, what is interesting about the sort of model I have now is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit like what happened with computation. Everything that I think of as, oh, well, maybe</p>
<p>the model is this, I discover it&rsquo;s equivalent. And that&rsquo;s quite encouraging because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I could say, well, I&rsquo;m going to look at trivalent graphs with three edges for each node and so on,</p>
<p>or I could look at this special kind of graph, or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure.</p>
<p>And turns out that the things I&rsquo;m now looking at, everything that I&rsquo;ve imagined that is a plausible</p>
<p>type of structuralist structure is equivalent to this. So what is it? Well, a typical way to think</p>
<p>about it is, well, so you might have some collection of tuples, collection of, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>numbers. So you might have one, three, five, two, three, four, just collections of numbers,</p>
<p>triples of numbers, let&rsquo;s say, quadruples of numbers, pairs of numbers, whatever.</p>
<p>And you have all these sort of floating little tuples. They&rsquo;re not in any particular order.</p>
<p>And that sort of floating collection of tuples, and I told you this was abstract,</p>
<p>represents the whole universe. The only thing that relates them is when a symbol is the same,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same, so to speak. So if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say at the same position of the tuple, at the first element of the tuple,</p>
<p>then that represents a relation. So let me try and peel this back.</p>
<p>Wow. Okay.</p>
<p>I told you it&rsquo;s abstract, but this is the&hellip;</p>
<p>So the relationship is formed by some aspect of sameness.</p>
<p>Right. But so think about it in terms of a graph. So a graph, a bunch of nodes,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you number each node, then what is a graph? A graph is a set of pairs that say</p>
<p>this node has an edge connecting it to this other node. And a graph is just a collection</p>
<p>of those pairs that say this node connects to this other node. So this is a generalization of that,</p>
<p>in which instead of having pairs, you have arbitrary n tuples. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole story. And now the question is, okay, so that might represent the state of the universe.</p>
<p>How does the universe evolve? What does the universe do? And so the answer is</p>
<p>that what I&rsquo;m looking at is a transformation rules on these hypergraphs. In other words,</p>
<p>you say this, whenever you see a piece of this hypergraph that looks like this,</p>
<p>turn it into a piece of hypergraph that looks like this. So on a graph, it might be when you</p>
<p>see the subgraph, when you see this thing with a bunch of edges hanging out in this particular way,</p>
<p>then rewrite it as this other graph. Okay. And so that&rsquo;s the whole story. So the question is</p>
<p>what, uh, so now you say, I mean, as I say, this is quite abstract. And one of the questions is,</p>
<p>uh, where do you do those updating? So you&rsquo;ve got this giant graph. What triggers the updating,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s the, what&rsquo;s the ripple effect of it? Is it, uh, and I suspect everything&rsquo;s discreet</p>
<p>even in time. So, okay. So the question is where do you do the updates? And the answer is the rule</p>
<p>is you do them wherever they apply. And you do them, you do them. The order in which the updates</p>
<p>is done is not defined. That is the, you can do them. So there may be many possible orderings</p>
<p>for these updates. Now, the point is if imagine you&rsquo;re an observer in this universe. So, and you</p>
<p>say, did something get updated? Well, you don&rsquo;t in any sense know until you yourself have been</p>
<p>updated. Right. So in fact, all that you can be sensitive to is essentially the causal network</p>
<p>of how an event over there affects an event that&rsquo;s in you. That doesn&rsquo;t even feel like</p>
<p>observation. That&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s something else. You&rsquo;re just part of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re part of it. But, but even to have, so the end result of that is all you&rsquo;re sensitive to</p>
<p>is this causal network of what event affects what other event. I&rsquo;m not making a big statement about</p>
<p>sort of the structure of the observer. I&rsquo;m simply saying, I&rsquo;m simply making the argument that</p>
<p>what happens, the microscopic order of these rewrites is not something that any observer,</p>
<p>any conceivable observer in this universe can be affected by. Because the only thing the observer</p>
<p>can be affected by is this causal network of how the events in the observer are affected</p>
<p>by other events that happen in the universe. So the only thing you have to look at is the</p>
<p>causal network. You don&rsquo;t really have to look at this microscopic rewriting that&rsquo;s happening. So</p>
<p>these rewrites are happening wherever they, they happen wherever they feel like.</p>
<p>Causal network. Is there, you said that there&rsquo;s not really, so the idea would be an undefined,</p>
<p>like what gets updated? The, the sequence of things is undefined. It&rsquo;s a, yes. That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you mean by the causal network, but then the call, no, the causal network is given that an</p>
<p>update has happened. That&rsquo;s an event. Then the question is, is that event causally related to,</p>
<p>does that event, if that event didn&rsquo;t happen, then some future event couldn&rsquo;t happen yet.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>And so you build up this network of what affects what. Okay. And so what that does,</p>
<p>so when you build up that network, that&rsquo;s kind of the observable aspect of the universe in some</p>
<p>sense. And so then you can ask questions about, you know, how robust is that observable network</p>
<p>of the, what&rsquo;s happening in the universe. Okay. So here&rsquo;s where it starts getting kind of</p>
<p>interesting. So for certain kinds of microscopic rewriting rules, the order of rewrites does not</p>
<p>matter to the causal network. And so this is, okay, mathematical logic moment. This is equivalent</p>
<p>to the Church Rosser property or the confluence property of rewrite rules. And it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>reason that if you&rsquo;re simplifying an algebraic expression, for example, you can say, oh, let me</p>
<p>expand those terms out. Let me factor those pieces. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what order you do that in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always get the same answer. And that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the same fundamental phenomenon that causes</p>
<p>for certain kinds of microscopic rewrite rules that causes the causal network to be independent</p>
<p>of the microscopic order of rewritings.</p>
<p>Why is that property important?</p>
<p>Because it implies special relativity. I mean, the reason it&rsquo;s important is that that property,</p>
<p>special relativity says you can look at these sort of, you can look at different reference frames.</p>
<p>You can have different, you can be looking at your notion of what space and what&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>can be different depending on whether you&rsquo;re traveling at a certain speed, depending on</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re doing this, that, and the other. But nevertheless, the laws of physics are the</p>
<p>same. That&rsquo;s what the principle of special relativity says, is the laws of physics are</p>
<p>the same independent of your reference frame. Well, turns out this sort of change of the</p>
<p>microscopic rewriting order is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame,</p>
<p>or at least there&rsquo;s a sub part of how that works that&rsquo;s equivalent to change a reference frame.</p>
<p>So, somewhat surprisingly, and sort of for the first time in forever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible for an underlying microscopic theory to imply special relativity, to be able to derive</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s not something you put in as a, this is a, it&rsquo;s something where this other property,</p>
<p>causal invariance, which is also the property that implies that there&rsquo;s a single thread of time</p>
<p>in the universe. It might not be the case that that&rsquo;s what would lead to the possibility of an</p>
<p>observer thinking that definite stuff happens. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ve got all these possible rewriting</p>
<p>orders, and who&rsquo;s to say which one occurred. But with this causal invariance property,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a notion of a definite thread of time. It sounds like that kind of idea of time,</p>
<p>even space, would be emergent from the system. Oh, yeah. No, I mean, it&rsquo;s not a fundamental part</p>
<p>of the system. No, no, it&rsquo;s a fundamental level. All you&rsquo;ve got is a bunch of nodes connected by</p>
<p>hyper edges or whatever. So there&rsquo;s no time, there&rsquo;s no space. That&rsquo;s right. And</p>
<p>but the thing is that it&rsquo;s just like imagining, imagine you&rsquo;re just dealing with a graph. And</p>
<p>imagine you have something like a, you know, like a honeycomb graph, or you have a hexagon,</p>
<p>a bunch of hexagons. You know, that graph at a microscopic level, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of nodes</p>
<p>connected to other nodes. But at a macroscopic level, you say that looks like a honeycomb,</p>
<p>you know, lattice, it looks like a two dimensional, you know, manifold of some kind, it looks like a</p>
<p>two dimensional thing. If you connect it differently, if you just connect all the</p>
<p>nodes one, one to another, and kind of a sort of linked list type structure, then you&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>well, that looks like a one dimensional space. But at the microscopic level, all these are just</p>
<p>networks with nodes, the macroscopic level, they look like something that&rsquo;s like one of our sort</p>
<p>of familiar kinds of space. And it&rsquo;s the same thing with these hyper graphs. Now, if you ask me,</p>
<p>have I found one that gives me three dimensional space? The answer is not yet. So we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is one of these things we&rsquo;re kind of betting against nature, so to speak. And I have no way to</p>
<p>know. And so there are many other properties of this kind of system that are very beautiful,</p>
<p>actually, and very suggestive. And it will be very elegant if this turns out to be right,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very clean. I mean, you start with nothing. And everything gets built up,</p>
<p>everything about space, everything about time, everything about matter. It&rsquo;s all just emergent</p>
<p>from the properties of this extremely low level system. And that, that will be pretty cool if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way our universe works. Now, do I on the other hand, the thing that that I find very</p>
<p>confusing is, let&rsquo;s say we succeed, let&rsquo;s say we can say this particular sort of hypergraph rewriting</p>
<p>rule gives the universe just run that hypergraph rewriting rule for enough times, and you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>everything, you&rsquo;ll get this conversation we&rsquo;re having, you&rsquo;ll get everything. It&rsquo;s that if we</p>
<p>get to that point, and we look at what is this thing, what is this rule that we just have,</p>
<p>that is giving us our whole universe, how do we think about that thing? Let&rsquo;s say, turns out the</p>
<p>minimal version of this, and this is kind of cool thing for a language designer like me,</p>
<p>the minimal version of this model is actually a single line of orphan language code.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, which I wasn&rsquo;t sure was going to happen that way, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>no, we don&rsquo;t know what, we don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s just the framework to know the actual</p>
<p>particular hypergraph that might be a longer, the specification of the rules might be slightly</p>
<p>longer. How does that help you accept marveling in the beauty and the elegance of the simplicity</p>
<p>that creates the universe? That does that help us predict anything in the universe?</p>
<p>That does that help us predict anything? Not really because of the irreducibility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct. That&rsquo;s correct. But so the thing that is really strange to me,</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t wrapped my, my brain around this yet is, you know, one is one keeps on realizing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not special in the sense that, you know, we don&rsquo;t live at the center of the universe.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t blah, blah, blah. And yet if we produce a rule for the universe and it&rsquo;s quite simple,</p>
<p>and we can write it down and a couple of lines or something that feels very special.</p>
<p>How did we come to get a simple universe when many of the available universes, so to speak,</p>
<p>are incredibly complicated? It might be, you know, a quintillion characters long.</p>
<p>Why did we get one of the ones that&rsquo;s simple? And so I haven&rsquo;t wrapped my brain around that</p>
<p>issue yet. If indeed we are in such a simple, the universe is such a simple rule. Is it possible</p>
<p>that there is something outside of this that we are in a kind of what people call the simulation,</p>
<p>right? That we&rsquo;re just part of a computation that&rsquo;s being explored by a graduate student</p>
<p>in alternate universe. Well, you know, the problem is we don&rsquo;t get to say much about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s outside our universe because by definition, our universe is what we exist within. Now,</p>
<p>can we make a sort of almost theological conclusion from being able to know how our</p>
<p>particular universe works? Interesting question. I don&rsquo;t think that if you ask the question,</p>
<p>could we, and it relates again to this question about extraterrestrial intelligence, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got the rule for the universe. Was it built in on purpose? Hard to say. That&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>as saying we see a signal from, you know, that we&rsquo;re receiving from some random star somewhere,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a series of pulses. And, you know, it&rsquo;s a periodic series of pulses, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Was that done on purpose? Can we conclude something about the origin of that series of</p>
<p>pulses? Just because it&rsquo;s elegant does not necessarily mean that somebody created it or</p>
<p>that we can even comprehend. Yeah. I think it&rsquo;s the ultimate version of the sort of identification</p>
<p>of the techno signature question. It&rsquo;s the ultimate version of that is was our universe</p>
<p>a piece of technology, so to speak, and how on earth would we know? But I mean, in the kind of</p>
<p>crazy science fiction thing you could imagine, you could say, oh, there&rsquo;s going to be a signature</p>
<p>there. It&rsquo;s going to be made by so and so. But there&rsquo;s no way we could understand that,</p>
<p>so to speak, and it&rsquo;s not clear what that would mean. Because the universe simply,</p>
<p>you know, if we find a rule for the universe, we&rsquo;re simply saying that rule represents what</p>
<p>our universe does. We&rsquo;re not saying that that rule is something running on a big computer</p>
<p>and making our universe. It&rsquo;s just saying that represents what our universe does in the same</p>
<p>sense that, you know, laws of classical mechanics, differential equations, whatever they are,</p>
<p>represent what mechanical systems do. It&rsquo;s not that the mechanical systems are somehow running</p>
<p>solutions to those differential equations. Those differential equations are just representing the</p>
<p>behavior of those systems. So what&rsquo;s the gap in your sense to linger on the fascinating,</p>
<p>perhaps slightly sci fi question? What&rsquo;s the gap between understanding the fundamental rules that</p>
<p>create a universe and engineering a system, actually creating a simulation ourselves?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about sort of, you&rsquo;ve talked about, you know, nano engineering kind of ideas</p>
<p>that are kind of exciting, actually creating some ideas of computation in the physical space. How</p>
<p>hard is it as an engineering problem to create the universe once you know the rules that create it?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s an interesting question. I think the substrate on which the universe is operating is</p>
<p>not a substrate that we have access to. I mean, the only substrate we have is that same substrate</p>
<p>that the universe is operating in. So if the universe is a bunch of hypergraphs being rewritten,</p>
<p>then we get to attach ourselves to those same hypergraphs being rewritten. We don&rsquo;t get to,</p>
<p>and if you ask the question, you know, is the code clean? You know, can we write nice,</p>
<p>elegant code with efficient algorithms and so on? Well, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s this question of how much computational reducibility there is in the system.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen some beautiful cellular automata that basically create copies of itself within</p>
<p>itself, right? So that&rsquo;s the question whether it&rsquo;s possible to create, like whether you need</p>
<p>to understand the substrate or whether you can. Yeah, well, right. I mean, so one of the things</p>
<p>that is sort of one of my slightly sci fi thoughts about the future, so to speak, is, you know,</p>
<p>right now, if you poll typical people, you say, do you think it&rsquo;s important to find the fundamental</p>
<p>theory of physics? You get, because I&rsquo;ve done this poll informally, at least, it&rsquo;s curious,</p>
<p>actually, you get a decent fraction of people saying, oh, yeah, that would be pretty interesting.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s becoming, surprisingly enough, more, I mean, a lot of people are interested</p>
<p>in physics in a way that like, without understanding it, just kind of watching</p>
<p>scientists, a very small number of them struggle to understand the nature of our reality.</p>
<p>Right. I mean, I think that&rsquo;s somewhat true. And in fact, in this project that I&rsquo;m launching into</p>
<p>to try and find fundamental theory of physics, I&rsquo;m going to do it as a very public project. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be live streamed and all this kind of stuff. And I don&rsquo;t know what will happen. It&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be kind of fun. I mean, I think that it&rsquo;s the interface to the world of this project. I mean,</p>
<p>I figure one feature of this project is, you know, unlike technology projects that basically are what</p>
<p>they are, this is a project that might simply fail, because it might be the case that it generates</p>
<p>all kinds of elegant mathematics that has absolutely nothing to do with the physical</p>
<p>universe that we happen to live in. Okay, so we&rsquo;re talking about kind of the quest to find</p>
<p>the fundamental theory of physics. First point is, you know, it&rsquo;s turned out it&rsquo;s kind of hard</p>
<p>to find the fundamental theory of physics. People weren&rsquo;t sure that that would be the case. Back in</p>
<p>the early days of applying mathematics to science, 1600s and so on, people were like, oh, in 100 years</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll know everything there is to know about how the universe works. Turned out to be harder than</p>
<p>that. And people got kind of humble at some level, because every time we got to sort of a greater</p>
<p>level of smallness and studying the universe, it seemed like the math got more complicated and</p>
<p>everything got harder. When I was a kid, basically, I started doing particle physics. And when I was</p>
<p>doing particle physics, I always thought finding the fundamental, fundamental theory of physics,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a kooky business, we&rsquo;ll never be able to do that. But we can operate within these</p>
<p>frameworks that we built for doing quantum field theory and general relativity and things like this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all good. And we can figure out a lot of stuff. Did you even at that time have a sense</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something behind that? Sure, I just didn&rsquo;t expect that. I thought in some rather un,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually kind of crazy and thinking back on it, because it&rsquo;s kind of like there was this long</p>
<p>period in civilization where people thought the ancients had it all figured out, and we&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>figure out anything new. And to some extent, that&rsquo;s the way I felt about physics when I was</p>
<p>in the middle of doing it, so to speak, was, you know, we&rsquo;ve got quantum field theory, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>foundation of what we&rsquo;re doing. And there&rsquo;s, you know, yes, there&rsquo;s probably something underneath</p>
<p>this, but we&rsquo;ll sort of never figure it out. But then I started studying simple programs in the</p>
<p>computational universe, things like cellular automata and so on. And I discovered that</p>
<p>they do all kinds of things that were completely at odds with the intuition that I had had.</p>
<p>And so after that, after you see this tiny little program that does all this amazingly complicated</p>
<p>stuff, then you start feeling a bit more ambitious about physics and saying, maybe we could do this</p>
<p>for physics too. And so that got me started years ago now in this kind of idea of could we actually</p>
<p>find what&rsquo;s underneath all of these frameworks, like quantum field theory and general relativity</p>
<p>and so on. And people perhaps don&rsquo;t realize as clearly as they might that, you know, the</p>
<p>frameworks we&rsquo;re using for physics, which is basically these two things, quantum field theory,</p>
<p>sort of the theory of small stuff and general relativity, theory of gravitation and large stuff.</p>
<p>Those are the two basic theories. And they&rsquo;re 100 years old. I mean, general relativity was 1915,</p>
<p>quantum field theory, well, 1920s. So basically 100 years old. And it&rsquo;s been a good run. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of stuff been figured out. But what&rsquo;s interesting is the foundations haven&rsquo;t changed</p>
<p>in all that period of time, even though the foundations had changed several times before</p>
<p>that in the 200 years earlier than that. And I think the kinds of things that I&rsquo;m thinking about,</p>
<p>which are sort of really informed by thinking about computation and the computational universe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different foundation. It&rsquo;s a different set of foundations. And might be wrong. But it is at</p>
<p>least, you know, we have a shot. And I think it&rsquo;s, you know, to me, it&rsquo;s, you know, my personal</p>
<p>calculation for myself is, is, you know, if it turns out that the finding the fundamental theory</p>
<p>of physics, it&rsquo;s kind of low hanging fruit, so to speak, it&rsquo;d be a shame if we just didn&rsquo;t think to</p>
<p>do it. You know, if people just said, Oh, you&rsquo;ll never figure that stuff out. Let&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>and it takes another 200 years before anybody gets around to doing it. You know, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how low hanging this fruit actually is. It may be, you know, it may be that it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of the wrong century to do this project. I mean, I think the cautionary tale for me, you know,</p>
<p>I think about things that I&rsquo;ve tried to do in technology, where people thought about doing them</p>
<p>a lot earlier. And my favorite example is probably Leibniz, who, who thought about making essentially</p>
<p>encapsulating the world&rsquo;s knowledge in a computational form in the late 1600s, and did a</p>
<p>lot of things towards that. And basically, you know, we finally managed to do this. But he was</p>
<p>300 years too early. And that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s kind of the in terms of life planning. It&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>avoid things that can&rsquo;t be done in your in your century, so to speak.</p>
<p>Yeah, timing. Timing is everything. So you think if we kind of figure out the underlying rules</p>
<p>that can create from which quantum field theory and general relativity can emerge,</p>
<p>do you think they&rsquo;ll help us unify it at that level of abstraction?</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;ll know it completely. We&rsquo;ll know how that all fits together. Yes, without a question.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s already even the things I&rsquo;ve already done. There are very, you know, it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>very elegant, actually, how things seem to be fitting together. Now, you know, is it right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know yet. It&rsquo;s awfully suggestive. If it isn&rsquo;t right, it&rsquo;s then the designer of the universe</p>
<p>should feel embarrassed, so to speak, because it&rsquo;s a really good way to do it.</p>
<p>And your intuition in terms of design universe, does God play dice? Is there is there randomness</p>
<p>in this thing? Or is it deterministic? So the kind of</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit of a complicated question. Because when you&rsquo;re dealing with these things</p>
<p>that involve these rewrites that have, okay, even randomness is an emergent phenomenon, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. I mean, it&rsquo;s a yeah, well, randomness, in many of these systems,</p>
<p>pseudo randomness and randomness are hard to distinguish. In this particular case,</p>
<p>the current idea that we have about some measurement in quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is something very bizarre and very abstract. And I don&rsquo;t think I can yet</p>
<p>explain it without kind of yakking about very technical things. Eventually, I will be able to.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s kind of a it&rsquo;s a weird thing, because it slices between determinism and</p>
<p>randomness in a weird way that hasn&rsquo;t been sliced before, so to speak. So like many of these</p>
<p>questions that come up in science, where it&rsquo;s like, is it this or is it that? Turns out the</p>
<p>real answer is it&rsquo;s neither of those things. It&rsquo;s something kind of different and sort of orthogonal</p>
<p>to those categories. And so that&rsquo;s the current, you know, this week&rsquo;s idea about how that might</p>
<p>work. But, you know, we&rsquo;ll see how that unfolds. I mean, there&rsquo;s this question about a field like</p>
<p>physics and sort of the quest for fundamental theory and so on. And there&rsquo;s both the science</p>
<p>of what happens and there&rsquo;s the sort of the social aspect of what happens. Because, you know,</p>
<p>in a field that is basically as old as physics, we&rsquo;re at, I don&rsquo;t know what it is, fourth generation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, fifth generation, I don&rsquo;t know what generation it is of physicists. And like,</p>
<p>I was one of these, so to speak. And for me, the foundations were like the pyramid, so to speak,</p>
<p>you know, it was that way. And it was always that way. It is difficult in an old field to go back to</p>
<p>the foundations and think about rewriting them. It&rsquo;s a lot easier in young fields where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still dealing with the first generation of people who invented the field. And it tends to be the</p>
<p>case, you know, that the nature of what happens in science tends to be, you know, you&rsquo;ll get,</p>
<p>typically the pattern is some methodological advance occurs. And then there&rsquo;s a period of five</p>
<p>years, 10 years, maybe a little bit longer than that, where there&rsquo;s lots of things that are now</p>
<p>made possible by that methodological advance, whether it&rsquo;s, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, telescopes,</p>
<p>or whether that&rsquo;s some mathematical method or something. Something happens, a tool gets built,</p>
<p>and then you can do a bunch of stuff. And there&rsquo;s a bunch of low hanging fruit to be picked. And</p>
<p>that takes a certain amount of time. After all that low hanging fruit is picked, then it&rsquo;s a hard</p>
<p>slog for the next however many decades or century or more to get to the next sort of level at which</p>
<p>one could do something. And it&rsquo;s kind of a, and it tends to be the case that in fields that are in</p>
<p>that kind of, I wouldn&rsquo;t say cruise mode, because it&rsquo;s really hard work, but it&rsquo;s very hard work for</p>
<p>very incremental progress. And then in your career and some of the things you&rsquo;ve taken on,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re not, you haven&rsquo;t been afraid of the hard slog. Yeah, that&rsquo;s true. So it&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>interesting, especially on the engineering, on the engineering side. On a small tangent, when you</p>
<p>were at Caltech, did you get to interact with Richard Feynman at all? Do you have any memories</p>
<p>of Richard? We worked together quite a bit, actually. In fact, both when I was at Caltech</p>
<p>and after I left Caltech, we were both consultants at this company called Thinking Machines Corporation,</p>
<p>which was just down the street from here, actually. It was ultimately an ill fated company. But I used</p>
<p>to say this company is not going to work with the strategy they have. And Dick Feynman always used</p>
<p>to say, what do we know about running companies? Just let them run their company. But anyway,</p>
<p>he was not into that kind of thing. And he always thought that my interest in doing things like</p>
<p>running companies was a distraction, so to speak. And for me, it&rsquo;s a mechanism to have a more</p>
<p>effective machine for actually getting things, figuring things out and getting things to happen.</p>
<p>Did he think of it, because essentially what you did with the company, I don&rsquo;t know if you were</p>
<p>thinking of it that way, but you&rsquo;re creating tools to empower the exploration of the</p>
<p>university. Do you think, did he&hellip; Did he understand that point? The point of tools of&hellip;</p>
<p>I think not as well as he might have done. I mean, I think that&hellip; But he was actually my</p>
<p>first company, which was also involved with, well, was involved with more mathematical computation</p>
<p>kinds of things. He was quite&hellip; He had lots of advice about the technical side of what we should</p>
<p>do and so on. Do you have examples, memories, or thoughts that&hellip; Oh, yeah, yeah. He had all</p>
<p>kinds of&hellip; Look, in the business of doing sort of&hellip; One of the hard things in math is doing</p>
<p>integrals and so on. And so he had his own elaborate ways to do integrals and so on. He</p>
<p>had his own ways of thinking about sort of getting intuition about how math works.</p>
<p>And so his sort of meta idea was take those intuitional methods and make a computer follow</p>
<p>those intuitional methods. Now, it turns out for the most part, like when we do integrals and</p>
<p>things, what we do is we build this kind of bizarre industrial machine that turns every integral</p>
<p>into products of major G functions and generates this very elaborate thing. And actually the big</p>
<p>problem is turning the results into something a human will understand. It&rsquo;s not, quote,</p>
<p>doing the integral. And actually, Feynman did understand that to some extent. And I&rsquo;m embarrassed</p>
<p>to say he once gave me this big pile of, you know, calculational methods for particle physics that he</p>
<p>worked out in the 50s. And he said, yeah, it&rsquo;s more used to you than to me type thing. And I</p>
<p>was like, I&rsquo;ve intended to look at it and give it back and I&rsquo;m still on my files now. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what happens when it&rsquo;s finiteness of human lives. Maybe if he&rsquo;d live another 20 years, I would have</p>
<p>remembered to give it back. But I think that was his attempt to systematize the ways that one does</p>
<p>integrals that show up in particle physics and so on. Turns out the way we&rsquo;ve actually done it</p>
<p>is very different from that way. What do you make of that difference,</p>
<p>Eugene? So Feynman was actually quite remarkable at creating sort of intuitive frameworks for</p>
<p>understanding difficult concepts. I&rsquo;m smiling because, you know, the funny thing about him was</p>
<p>that the thing he was really, really, really good at is calculating stuff. But he thought that was</p>
<p>easy because he was really good at it. And so he would do these things where he would calculate</p>
<p>some, do some complicated calculation in quantum field theory, for example, come out with a result,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t tell anybody about the complicated calculation because he thought that was easy.</p>
<p>He thought the really impressive thing was to have this simple intuition about how</p>
<p>everything works. So he invented that at the end. And, you know, because he&rsquo;d done this calculation</p>
<p>and knew how it worked, it was a lot easier. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to have good intuition when you know</p>
<p>what the answer is. And then and then he would just not tell anybody about these calculations</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t meaning that maliciously, so to speak. It&rsquo;s just he thought that was easy.</p>
<p>And and that&rsquo;s, you know, that led to areas where people were just completely mystified,</p>
<p>and they kind of followed his intuition. But nobody could tell why it worked. Because actually,</p>
<p>the reason it worked was because he&rsquo;d done all these calculations, and he knew that it was</p>
<p>would work. And, you know, when I he and I worked a bit on quantum computers actually back in 1980,</p>
<p>81, before anybody had heard of those things. And, you know, the typical mode of I mean,</p>
<p>he was used to say, and I now think about this, because I&rsquo;m about the age that he was when I</p>
<p>worked with him. And, you know, I see the people who are one third my age, so to speak.</p>
<p>And he was always complaining that I was one third his age, and therefore various things. But, but,</p>
<p>you know, he would do some calculation by by hand, you know, blackboard and things come up with some</p>
<p>answer. I&rsquo;d say, I don&rsquo;t understand this. You know, I do something with a computer. And he&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t understand this. So there&rsquo;d be some big argument about what was, you know,</p>
<p>what was going on, but but it was always some. And I think, actually, we many of the things that we</p>
<p>sort of realized about quantum computing, that was sort of issues that have to do particularly</p>
<p>with the measurement process, are kind of still issues today. And I kind of find it interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny thing in science that these, you know, that there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a remarkable happens</p>
<p>in technology to there&rsquo;s a remarkable sort of repetition of history that ends up occurring.</p>
<p>Eventually, things really get nailed down. But it often takes a while. And it often things come</p>
<p>back decades later. Well, for example, I could tell a story actually happened right down the</p>
<p>street from here. When we were both thinking machines, I had been working on this particular</p>
<p>cellular automaton, who rule 30, that has this feature that it from very simple initial conditions,</p>
<p>it makes really complicated behavior. Okay. So and actually, of all silly physical things,</p>
<p>using this big parallel computer called the connection machine that that company was making,</p>
<p>I generated this giant printout of rule 30 on very, on actually on the same kind of same kind</p>
<p>of printer that people use to make layouts microprocessors. So one of these big, you know,</p>
<p>large format printers with high resolution and so on. So okay, so print this out lots of very tiny</p>
<p>cells. And so there was sort of a question of how some features of that pattern. And so it was very</p>
<p>much a physical, you know, on the floor with meter rules trying to measure different things.</p>
<p>So, so Feynman kind of takes me aside, we&rsquo;ve been doing that for a little while and takes me aside.</p>
<p>And he says, I just want to know this one thing says, I want to know, how did you know that this</p>
<p>rule 30 thing would produce all this really complicated behavior that is so complicated</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re, you know, going around with this big printout, and so on. And I said, Well,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know, I just enumerated all the possible rules and then observed that that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>He said, Oh, I feel a lot better. You know, I thought you had some intuition that he didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that would let one. I said, No, no, no, no intuition, just experimental science.</p>
<p>TK Oh, that&rsquo;s such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there of that&rsquo;s exactly you showed is you really</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t have an intuition about an irreducible. I mean, you have to run it.</p>
<p>MG Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>TK That&rsquo;s so hard for us humans, and especially brilliant</p>
<p>physicists like Feynman to say that you can&rsquo;t have a compressed, clean intuition about how the whole</p>
<p>thing works. MG Yes, yes. No, he was, I mean, I think he was sort of on the edge of understanding</p>
<p>that point about computation. And I think he found that, I think he always found computation</p>
<p>interesting. And I think that was sort of what he was a little bit poking at. I mean, that intuition,</p>
<p>you know, the difficulty of discovering things, like even you say, Oh, you know, you just</p>
<p>enumerate all the cases and just find one that does something interesting, right? Sounds very easy.</p>
<p>Turns out, like, I missed it when I first saw it, because I had kind of an intuition</p>
<p>that said it shouldn&rsquo;t be there. So I had kind of arguments, Oh, I&rsquo;m going to ignore that case,</p>
<p>because whatever. And how did you have an open mind enough? Because you&rsquo;re essentially the same</p>
<p>person as you should find, like the same kind of physics type of thinking. How did you find yourself</p>
<p>having a sufficiently open mind to be open to watching rules and them revealing complexity?</p>
<p>MG Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s an interesting question. I&rsquo;ve wondered about that myself, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like, you know, you live through these things, and then you say, what was the historical</p>
<p>story? And sometimes the historical story that you realize after the fact was not what you lived</p>
<p>through, so to speak. And so, you know, what I realized is, I think what happened is, you know,</p>
<p>I did physics, kind of like reductionistic physics, where you&rsquo;re thrown in the universe,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re told, go figure out what&rsquo;s going on inside it. And then I started building computer</p>
<p>tools. And I started building my first computer language, for example. And computer language is</p>
<p>not like, it&rsquo;s sort of like physics in the sense that you have to take all those computations</p>
<p>people want to do, and kind of drill down and find the primitives that they can all be made of.</p>
<p>But then you do something that&rsquo;s really different, because you&rsquo;re just saying,</p>
<p>okay, these are the primitives. Now, you know, hopefully they&rsquo;ll be useful to people,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build up from there. So you&rsquo;re essentially building an artificial universe, in a sense,</p>
<p>where you make this language, you&rsquo;ve got these primitives, you&rsquo;re just building whatever you</p>
<p>feel like building. And so it was sort of interesting for me, because from doing science,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just thrown in the universe as the universe is, to then just being told, you know,</p>
<p>you can make up any universe you want. And so I think that experience of making a computer language,</p>
<p>which is essentially building your own universe, so to speak, that&rsquo;s what gave me a somewhat</p>
<p>different attitude towards what might be possible. It&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s just explore what can be done in</p>
<p>these artificial universes, rather than thinking the natural science way of let&rsquo;s be constrained</p>
<p>by how the universe actually is. Yeah, by being able to program, essentially, you&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>as opposed to being limited to just your mind and a pen, you now have, you&rsquo;ve basically built</p>
<p>another brain that you can use to explore the universe by computer program, you know,</p>
<p>this is kind of a brain, right? And it&rsquo;s well, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s or telescope, or you know, it&rsquo;s a tool,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it lets you let&rsquo;s you see stuff, but there&rsquo;s something fundamentally different</p>
<p>between a computer and a telescope. I mean, it just, yeah, I&rsquo;m hoping to romanticize the notion,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more general, the computer is more general. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, I think, I mean, this</p>
<p>point about, you know, people say, oh, such and such a thing was almost discovered at such and</p>
<p>such a time, the the distance between, you know, the building the paradigm that allows you to</p>
<p>actually understand stuff or allows one to be open to seeing what&rsquo;s going on. That&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think, in I&rsquo;ve been fortunate in my life that I spent a lot of my time building</p>
<p>computational language. And that&rsquo;s an activity that, in a sense, works by sort of having to</p>
<p>kind of create another level of abstraction and kind of be open to different kinds of structures.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s always I mean, I&rsquo;m fully aware of, I suppose, the fact that I have seen it</p>
<p>a bunch of times of how easy it is to miss the obvious, so to speak, that at least is factored</p>
<p>into my attempt to not miss the obvious, although it may not succeed. What do you think is the role</p>
<p>of ego in the history of math and science? And more sort of, you know, a book title is something</p>
<p>like a new kind of science. You&rsquo;ve accomplished a huge amount. In fact, somebody said that Newton</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have an ego, and I looked into it and he had a huge ego. Yeah, but from an outsider&rsquo;s</p>
<p>perspective, some have said that you have a bit of an ego as well. Do you see it that way? Does</p>
<p>ego get in the way? Is it empowering? Is it both? So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s complicated and necessary. I</p>
<p>mean, you know, I&rsquo;ve had, look, I&rsquo;ve spent more than half my life CEO in a tech company. Right.</p>
<p>Okay. And, you know, that is a, I think it&rsquo;s actually very, it means that one&rsquo;s ego is not</p>
<p>a distant thing. It&rsquo;s a thing that one encounters every day, so to speak, because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>tied up with leadership and with how one, you know, develops an organization and all these</p>
<p>kinds of things. So, you know, it may be that if I&rsquo;d been an academic, for example, I could have</p>
<p>sort of, you know, check the ego, put it on, put on a shelf somewhere and ignore its characteristics,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re reminded of it quite often in the context of running a company. Sure. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s about leadership and, you know, leadership is intimately tied to</p>
<p>ego. Now, what does it mean? I mean, what, what is the, you know, for me, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate that I</p>
<p>think I have reasonable intellectual confidence, so to speak. That is, you know, I, I&rsquo;m one of</p>
<p>these people who at this point, if somebody tells me something and I just don&rsquo;t understand it,</p>
<p>my conclusion isn&rsquo;t that means I&rsquo;m dumb. That my conclusion is there&rsquo;s something wrong with</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m being told. And that was actually Dick Feynman used to have that, that that feature too,</p>
<p>he never really believed in. He actually believed in experts much less than I believe in experts.</p>
<p>So. Wow. So that&rsquo;s a fun, that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a fundamentally powerful property of ego and saying,</p>
<p>like, not that I am wrong, but that the, the world is wrong. And, and tell me, like, when confronted</p>
<p>with the fact that doesn&rsquo;t fit the thing that you&rsquo;ve really thought through sort of both the</p>
<p>negative and the positive of ego, do you see the negative of that get in the way sort of being</p>
<p>sure of the mistakes I&rsquo;ve made that are the results of, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m right. And</p>
<p>turns out I&rsquo;m not. I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the, you know, but, but the thing is that the, the,</p>
<p>the idea that one tries to do things that, so for example, you know, one question is if people have</p>
<p>tried hard to do something and then one thinks, maybe I should try doing this myself. Uh, if one</p>
<p>does not have a certain degree of intellectual confidence, one just says, well, people have been</p>
<p>trying to do this for a hundred years. How am I going to be able to do this? Yeah. And, you know,</p>
<p>I was fortunate in the sense that I happened to start having some degree of success in science</p>
<p>and things when I was really young. And so that developed a certain amount of sort of intellectual</p>
<p>confidence. I don&rsquo;t think I otherwise would have had. Um, and you know, in a sense, I mean,</p>
<p>I was fortunate that I was working in a field, particle physics during its sort of golden age</p>
<p>of rapid progress. And that, that&rsquo;s kind of gives one a false sense of, uh, achievement because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of, kind of easy to discover stuff that&rsquo;s going to survive. If you happen to be,</p>
<p>you know, picking the low hanging fruit of a rapidly expanding field.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason I totally, I totally immediately understood the ego behind a new</p>
<p>kind of science to me, let me sort of just try to express my feelings on the whole thing,</p>
<p>is that if you don&rsquo;t allow that kind of ego, then you would never write that book.</p>
<p>That you would say, well, people must have done this. There&rsquo;s not, you would not dig.</p>
<p>You would not keep digging. And I think that was, I think you have to take that ego and,</p>
<p>and ride it and see where it takes you. And that&rsquo;s how you create exceptional work.</p>
<p>But I think the other point about that book was it was a non trivial question,</p>
<p>how to take a bunch of ideas that are, I think, reasonably big ideas. They might,</p>
<p>they might, you know, their importance is determined by what happens historically.</p>
<p>One can&rsquo;t tell how important they are. One can tell sort of the scope of them.</p>
<p>And the scope is fairly big and they&rsquo;re very different from things that have come before.</p>
<p>And the question is, how do you explain that stuff to people? And so I had had the experience</p>
<p>of sort of saying, well, there are these things, there&rsquo;s a cellular automaton. It does this,</p>
<p>it does that. And people are like, oh, it must be just like this. It must be just like that.</p>
<p>So no, it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s something different. Right. And so I could have done sort of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad you did what you did, but you could have done sort of academically,</p>
<p>just published, keep publishing small papers here and there. And then you would just keep</p>
<p>getting this kind of resistance, right? You would get like, yeah, it&rsquo;s supposed to just</p>
<p>dropping a thing that says, here it is, here&rsquo;s the full, the full thing.</p>
<p>No, I mean, that was my calculation is that basically, you know, you could introduce</p>
<p>little pieces. It&rsquo;s like, you know, one possibility is like, it&rsquo;s the secret weapon,</p>
<p>so to speak. It&rsquo;s this, you know, I keep on discovering these things in all these different</p>
<p>areas. Where&rsquo;d they come from? Nobody knows. But I decided that, you know, in the interests of one</p>
<p>only has one life to lead and, you know, writing that book took me a decade anyway. There&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>lot of wiggle room, so to speak. One can&rsquo;t be wrong by a factor of three, so to speak, in how long</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take. That I, you know, I thought the best thing to do, the thing that is most sort</p>
<p>of, that most respects the intellectual content, so to speak, is you just put it out with as much</p>
<p>force as you can, because it&rsquo;s not something where, and, you know, it&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>You talk about ego and it&rsquo;s, you know, for example, I run a company which has my name on it,</p>
<p>right? I thought about starting a club for people whose companies have their names on them. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a funny group because we&rsquo;re not a bunch of egomaniacs. That&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s about,</p>
<p>so to speak. It&rsquo;s about basically sort of taking responsibility for what one&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And, you know, in a sense, any of these things where you&rsquo;re sort of putting yourself on the line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a funny, it&rsquo;s a funny dynamic because, in a sense, my company is sort of</p>
<p>something that happens to have my name on it, but it&rsquo;s kind of bigger than me and I&rsquo;m kind of just</p>
<p>its mascot at some level. I mean, I also happen to be a pretty, you know, strong leader of it.</p>
<p>LW. But it&rsquo;s basically showing a deep, inextricable sort of investment. Your name,</p>
<p>like Steve Jobs&rsquo;s name wasn&rsquo;t on Apple, but he was Apple. Elon Musk&rsquo;s name is not on Tesla,</p>
<p>but he is Tesla. So it&rsquo;s like, it meaning emotionally. If a company succeeds or fails,</p>
<p>he would just that emotionally would suffer through that. And so that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>recognizing that fact. And also Wolfram is a pretty good branding name, so that works out.</p>
<p>LW. Yeah, right. Exactly. I think Steve had it had a bad deal there.</p>
<p>LR. Yeah. So you made up for it with the last name. Okay. So in 2002, you published</p>
<p>A New Kind of Science, to which sort of on a personal level, I can credit my love for</p>
<p>cellular automata and computation in general. I think a lot of others can as well. Can you</p>
<p>briefly describe the vision, the hope, the main idea presented in this 1200 page book?</p>
<p>LW. Sure. Although it took 1200 pages to say in the book. So no, the real idea, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a good way to get into it is to look at sort of the arc of history and to look at what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>in kind of the development of science. I mean, there was this sort of big idea in science about</p>
<p>300 years ago, that was, let&rsquo;s use mathematical equations to try and describe things in the world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use sort of the formal idea of mathematical equations to describe what might be happening in</p>
<p>the world, rather than, for example, just using sort of logical augmentation and so on. Let&rsquo;s have</p>
<p>a formal theory about that. And so there&rsquo;d been this 300 year run of using mathematical equations</p>
<p>to describe the natural world, which had worked pretty well. But I got interested in how one could</p>
<p>generalize that notion. There is a formal theory, there are definite rules, but what structure could</p>
<p>those rules have? And so what I got interested in was let&rsquo;s generalize beyond the sort of purely</p>
<p>mathematical rules. And we now have this sort of notion of programming and computing and so on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the kinds of rules that can be embodied in programs as a sort of generalization of the</p>
<p>ones that can exist in mathematics as a way to describe the world. And so my kind of favorite</p>
<p>version of these kinds of simple rules are these things called cellular automata. And so typical</p>
<p>case&hellip; So wait, what are cellular automata? Fair enough. So typical case of a cellular automaton,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an array of cells. It&rsquo;s just a line of discrete cells. Each cell is either black or white.</p>
<p>And in a series of steps that you can represent as lines going down a page, you&rsquo;re updating the</p>
<p>color of each cell according to a rule that depends on the color of the cell above it and</p>
<p>to its left and right. So it&rsquo;s really simple. So a thing might be if the cell and its right neighbor</p>
<p>are not the same or the cell on the left is black or something, then make it black on the next step.</p>
<p>And if not, make it white. Typical rule. That rule, I&rsquo;m not sure I said it exactly right,</p>
<p>but a rule very much like what I just said, has the feature that if you started off from just one</p>
<p>black cell at the top, it makes this extremely complicated pattern. So some rules you get a very</p>
<p>simple pattern. Some rules, the rule is simple. You start them off from a sort of simple seed.</p>
<p>You just get this very simple pattern. But other rules, and this was the big surprise when I</p>
<p>started actually just doing the simple computer experiments to find out what happens, is that they</p>
<p>produce very complicated patterns of behavior. So for example, this rule 30 rule has the feature</p>
<p>you start off from just one black cell at the top, makes this very random pattern. If you look</p>
<p>like at the center column of cells, you get a series of values. It goes black, white, black,</p>
<p>black, whatever it is. That sequence seems for all practical purposes random. So it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>in math, you compute the digits of pi, 3.1415926, whatever. Those digits once computed, I mean,</p>
<p>the scheme for computing pi, it&rsquo;s the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle,</p>
<p>very well defined. But yet, once you&rsquo;ve generated those digits, they seem for all practical</p>
<p>purposes completely random. And so it is with rule 30, that even though the rule is very simple,</p>
<p>much simpler, much more sort of computationally obvious than the rule for generating digits of pi,</p>
<p>even with a rule that simple, you&rsquo;re still generating immensely complicated behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah. So if we could just pause on that, I think you probably have said it and looked at it so long,</p>
<p>you forgot the magic of it, or perhaps you don&rsquo;t, you still feel the magic. But to me,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve never seen sort of, I would say, what is it? A one dimensional, essentially,</p>
<p>cellular automata, right? And you were to guess what you would see if you have some</p>
<p>sort of cells that only respond to its neighbors. Right. If you were to guess what kind of things</p>
<p>you would see, like my initial guess, like even when I first like opened your book,</p>
<p>A New Kind of Science, right? My initial guess is you would see, I mean, it would be a very simple</p>
<p>stuff. Right. And I think it&rsquo;s a magical experience to realize the kind of complexity,</p>
<p>you mentioned rule 30, still your favorite cellular automaton? Still my favorite rule. Yes.</p>
<p>You get complexity, immense complexity, you get arbitrary complexity. Yes. And when you say</p>
<p>randomness down the middle column, that&rsquo;s just one cool way to say that there&rsquo;s incredible complexity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just, I mean, that&rsquo;s a magical idea. However, you start to interpret it,</p>
<p>all the reducibility discussions, all that. But it&rsquo;s just, I think that has profound philosophical</p>
<p>kind of notions around it, too. It&rsquo;s not just, I mean, it&rsquo;s transformational about how you see the</p>
<p>world. I think for me it was transformational. I don&rsquo;t know, we can have all kinds of discussion</p>
<p>about computation and so on, but just, you know, I sometimes think if I were on a desert island</p>
<p>and was, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it was some psychedelics or something, but if I had to take</p>
<p>one book, I mean, you kind of science would be it because you could just enjoy that notion. For some</p>
<p>reason, it&rsquo;s a deeply profound notion, at least to me. I find it that way. Yeah. I mean, look, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been, it was a very intuition breaking thing to discover. I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>you point the computational telescope out the window and you&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>point the computational telescope out there. And suddenly you see, I don&rsquo;t know, you know,</p>
<p>in the past, it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, moons of Jupiter or something, but suddenly you see</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s kind of very unexpected and rule 30 was very unexpected for me. And the big</p>
<p>challenge at a personal level was to not ignore it. I mean, people, you know, in other words,</p>
<p>you might say, you know, it&rsquo;s a bug. What would you say? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I,</p>
<p>what are we looking at by the way? Oh, well, I was just generating here. I&rsquo;ll actually generate</p>
<p>a rule 30 pattern. So that&rsquo;s the rule for, for rule 30. And it says, for example, it says here,</p>
<p>if you have a black cell in the middle and black cell to the left and white cell to the right,</p>
<p>then the cell on the next step will be white. And so here&rsquo;s the actual pattern that you get</p>
<p>starting off from a single black cell at the top there. And then that&rsquo;s the initial state initial</p>
<p>condition. That&rsquo;s the initial thing. You just start off from that and then you&rsquo;re going down</p>
<p>the page and at every, at every step, you&rsquo;re just applying this rule to find out the new value that</p>
<p>you get. And so you might think rule that simple, you got to get the, there&rsquo;s got to be some trace</p>
<p>of that simplicity here. Okay. We&rsquo;ll run it. Let&rsquo;s say for 400 steps. Um, so what it does,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of aliasing a bit on the screen there, but, but, um, you can see there&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>of regularity over on the left, but there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff here that just looks very complicated,</p>
<p>very random. And, uh, that&rsquo;s a big sort of shock to was a big shock to my intuition, at least</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s possible. The mind immediately starts. Is there a pattern? There must be a repetitive</p>
<p>pattern. There must be. So I spent, so indeed, that&rsquo;s what I thought at first. And I thought,</p>
<p>I thought, well, this is kind of interesting, but you know, if we run it long enough, we&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>you know, something we&rsquo;ll resolve into something simple. And, uh, uh, you know, I did all kinds of</p>
<p>analysis of using mathematics, statistics, cryptography, whatever, whatever to try and crack</p>
<p>it. Um, and I never succeeded. And after I hadn&rsquo;t succeeded for a while, I started thinking maybe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real phenomenon here. That is the reason I&rsquo;m not succeeding. Maybe. I mean, the thing that</p>
<p>for me was sort of a motivating factor was looking at the natural world and seeing all this complexity</p>
<p>that exists in the natural world. The question is, where does it come from? You know, what secret</p>
<p>does nature have that lets it make all this complexity that we humans, when we engineer</p>
<p>things typically are not making, we&rsquo;re typically making things that at least look quite simple to</p>
<p>us. And so the shock here was even from something very simple, you&rsquo;re making something that complex.</p>
<p>Uh, maybe this is getting at sort of the secret that nature has that allows it to make really</p>
<p>complex things, even though its underlying rules may not be that complex. How did it make you feel</p>
<p>if we, if we look at the Newton apple, was there, was it, was there a, you know, you took a walk</p>
<p>and, and something it profoundly hit you or was this a gradual thing, a lobster being boiled?</p>
<p>The truth of every sort of science discovery is it&rsquo;s not that gradual. I mean, I&rsquo;ve spent,</p>
<p>I happen to be interested in scientific biography kinds of things. And so I&rsquo;ve tried to track down,</p>
<p>you know, how did people come to figure out this or that thing? And there&rsquo;s always a long kind of,</p>
<p>uh, sort of preparatory, um, you know, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a need to be prepared in a mindset</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s possible to see something. I mean, in the case of rule 30,</p>
<p>I was around June 1st, 1984 was, um, uh, kind of a silly story in some ways. I finally had</p>
<p>a high resolution laser printer. So I was able, so I thought I&rsquo;m going to generate a bunch of</p>
<p>pictures of the cellular automata and I generate this one and I put it, I was on some plane flight</p>
<p>to Europe and they have this with me. And it&rsquo;s like, you know, I really should try to understand</p>
<p>this. And this is really, you know, this is, I really don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And, uh, that was kind of the, um, you know, slowly trying to, trying to see what was happening.</p>
<p>It was not, uh, it was depressingly unsubstantial, so to speak, in the sense that, um, a lot of these</p>
<p>ideas like principle of computational equivalence, for example, you know, I thought, well, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>possible thing. I didn&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s correct, still don&rsquo;t know for sure that it&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s sort of a gradual thing that these things gradually kind of become seem more important</p>
<p>than one thought. I mean, I think the whole idea of studying the computational universe of simple</p>
<p>programs, it took me probably a decade, decade and a half to kind of internalize that that was</p>
<p>really an important idea. Um, and I think, you know, if it turns out we find the whole universe</p>
<p>lurking out there in the computational universe, that&rsquo;s a good, uh, you know, it&rsquo;s a good brownie</p>
<p>point or something for the, uh, for the whole idea. But I think that the, um, the thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strange in this whole question about, you know, finding this different raw material for making</p>
<p>models of things, um, what&rsquo;s been interesting sort of in the, in sort of arc of history is,</p>
<p>you know, for 300 years, it&rsquo;s kind of like the, the mathematical equations approach.</p>
<p>It was the winner. It was the thing, you know, you want to have a really good model for something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you use. The thing that&rsquo;s been remarkable is just in the last decade or so,</p>
<p>I think one can see a transition to using not mathematical equations, but programs</p>
<p>as sort of the raw material for making models of stuff. And that&rsquo;s pretty neat. And it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>you know, as somebody who&rsquo;s kind of lived inside this paradigm shift, so to speak,</p>
<p>it is bizarre. I mean, no doubt in sort of the history of science that will be seen as an</p>
<p>instantaneous paradigm shift, but it sure isn&rsquo;t instantaneous when it&rsquo;s played out in one&rsquo;s actual</p>
<p>life. So to speak, it seems glacial. Um, um, and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing where, where it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>interesting because in the dynamics of sort of the adoption of ideas like that into different fields,</p>
<p>the younger the field, the faster the adoption typically, because people are not kind of locked</p>
<p>in with the fifth generation of people who&rsquo;ve studied this field and it is, it is the way it is</p>
<p>and it can never be any different. And I think that&rsquo;s been, um, you know, watching that process</p>
<p>has been interesting. I mean, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m, I think I&rsquo;m fortunate that I, I&rsquo;ve, uh, uh, I, I do stuff</p>
<p>mainly cause I like doing it. And, um, uh, if I was, um, uh, that makes me kind of thick skinned</p>
<p>about the world&rsquo;s response to what I do. Um, and uh, but that&rsquo;s definitely, uh, you know, and anytime</p>
<p>you, you write a book called something like a new kind of science, um, it&rsquo;s kind of the, the pitch</p>
<p>forks will come out for the, for the old kind of science. And I was, it was interesting dynamics.</p>
<p>I think that the, um, um, uh, I have to say that I was fully aware of the fact that the, um, when</p>
<p>you see sort of incipient paradigm shifts in science, the vigor of the negative response</p>
<p>upon early introduction is a fantastic positive indicator of good longterm results. So in other</p>
<p>words, if people just don&rsquo;t care, it&rsquo;s, um, you know, that&rsquo;s not such a good sign. If they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, oh, this is great. That means you didn&rsquo;t really discover anything interesting. Um, what</p>
<p>fascinating properties of rule 30 have you discovered over the years? You&rsquo;ve recently</p>
<p>announced the rule 30 prizes for solving three key problems. Can you maybe talk about interesting</p>
<p>properties that have been kind of revealed rule 30 or other cellular automata and what problems</p>
<p>are still before us? Like the three problems you&rsquo;ve announced. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, I mean,</p>
<p>the most interesting thing about cellular automata is that it&rsquo;s hard to figure stuff out about them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, um, uh, in a sense, every time you try and sort of, uh, uh, you try and bash them with</p>
<p>some other technique, you say, can I crack them? The answer is they seem to be uncrackable. They</p>
<p>seem to have the feature that they are, um, that they&rsquo;re sort of showing irreducible computation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not able to say, oh, I know exactly what this is going to do. It&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>do this or that, but there&rsquo;s specific formulations of that fact. Yes. Right. So, I mean, for example,</p>
<p>in, in rule 30, in the pattern you get just starting from a single black cell, you get this</p>
<p>sort of very, very sort of random looking pattern. And so one feature of that, just look at the</p>
<p>center column. And for example, we use that for a long time to generate randomness symbols and</p>
<p>language, um, just, you know, what rule 30 produces. Now the question is, can you prove</p>
<p>how random it is? So for example, one very simple question, can you prove that it&rsquo;ll never repeat?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t been able to show that it will never repeat.</p>
<p>We know that if there are two adjacent columns, we know they can&rsquo;t both repeat,</p>
<p>but just knowing whether that center column can ever repeat, we still don&rsquo;t even know that. Um,</p>
<p>another problem that I sort of put in my collection of, you know, it&rsquo;s like $30,000 for</p>
<p>three, you know, for these three prizes for about rule 30. Um, I would say that this is not one of</p>
<p>those. There&rsquo;s one of those cases where the money is not the main point, but, um, it&rsquo;s just, uh,</p>
<p>you know, helps, um, uh, motivate somehow the, the investigation. So there&rsquo;s three problems</p>
<p>you propose to get $30,000 if you solve all three or maybe, you know, it&rsquo;s 10,000 for each for each.</p>
<p>Right. My, uh, the, the problems, that&rsquo;s right. Money&rsquo;s not the thing. The problems</p>
<p>themselves are just clean formulation. It&rsquo;s just, you know, will it ever become periodic?</p>
<p>Second problem is, are there an equal number of black and white cells down the middle column,</p>
<p>down the middle column. And the third problem is a little bit harder to state, which is essentially,</p>
<p>is there a way of figuring out what the color of a cell at position T down the center column is</p>
<p>in a, with a less computational effort than about T steps. So in other words, is there a way to jump</p>
<p>ahead and say, I know what this is going to do, you know, it&rsquo;s just some mathematical function</p>
<p>of T, um, or proving that there is no way or proving there is no way. Yes. But both, I mean,</p>
<p>you know, for any one of these, one could prove that, you know, one could discover, you know,</p>
<p>we know what rule 30 does for a billion steps, but, um, and maybe we&rsquo;ll know for a trillion steps</p>
<p>before too very long. Um, but maybe at a quadrillion steps, it suddenly becomes repetitive.</p>
<p>You might say, how could that possibly happen? But so when I was writing up these prizes,</p>
<p>I thought, and this is typical of what happens in the computational universe. I thought,</p>
<p>let me find an example where it looks like it&rsquo;s just going to be random forever,</p>
<p>but actually it becomes repetitive. And I found one and it&rsquo;s just, you know, I did a search,</p>
<p>I searched, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe a million different rules with some criterion. And this is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s sort of interesting about that is I kind of have this thing that I say in a kind of silly</p>
<p>way about the computational universe, which is, you know, the animals are always smarter than you</p>
<p>are. That is, there&rsquo;s always some way. One of these computational systems is going to figure</p>
<p>out how to do something, even though I can&rsquo;t imagine how it&rsquo;s going to do it. And, you know,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I would find one that, you know, you would think after all these years that when</p>
<p>I found sort of all possible things, uh, uh, uh, funky things that, um, uh, that I would have, uh,</p>
<p>that I would have gotten my intuition wrapped around the idea that, um, you know, these creatures</p>
<p>are always in the computational universe are always smarter than I&rsquo;m going to be. But, uh,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re equivalently as smart, right? That&rsquo;s correct. And that makes it,</p>
<p>that makes one feel very sort of, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s humbling every time because every time the thing</p>
<p>is, is, uh, you know, you think it&rsquo;s going to do this or it&rsquo;s not going to be possible to do this</p>
<p>and it turns out it finds a way. Of course, the promising thing is there&rsquo;s a lot of other rules</p>
<p>like rule 30. It&rsquo;s just rule 30 is, oh, it&rsquo;s my favorite cause I found it first. And that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But the, the problems are focusing on rule 30. It&rsquo;s possible that rule 30</p>
<p>is, is repetitive after trillion steps and that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything about the other rules.</p>
<p>It does not. But this is a good sort of experiment of how you go about trying to prove something</p>
<p>about a particular rule. Yes. And it also, all these things help build intuition. That is if</p>
<p>it turned out that this was repetitive after a trillion steps, that&rsquo;s not what I would expect.</p>
<p>And so we learned something from that. The method to do that though, would reveal something</p>
<p>interesting about the, no doubt. No doubt. I mean, it&rsquo;s, although it&rsquo;s sometimes challenging,</p>
<p>like the, you know, I put out a prize in 2007 for, for a particular Turing machine that I,</p>
<p>there was the simplest candidate for being a universal Turing machine and the young chap in</p>
<p>England named Alex Smith, um, after a smallish number of months said, I&rsquo;ve got a proof and</p>
<p>he did, you know, it took a little while to iterate, but he had a proof. Unfortunately,</p>
<p>the proof is very, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a lot of micro details. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not like you look</p>
<p>at it and you say, aha, there&rsquo;s a big new principle. The big new principle is the simplest</p>
<p>Turing machine that might have been universal actually is universal. And it&rsquo;s incredibly much</p>
<p>simpler than the Turing machines that people already knew were universal before that. And so</p>
<p>that intuitionally is important because it says computation universality is closer at hand than</p>
<p>you might&rsquo;ve thought. Um, but the actual methods are not, uh, in that particular case,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not terribly illuminating. It would be nice if the methods would also be elegant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. Yeah. No, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s one of these things where, I mean, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a lot of, we&rsquo;ve talked about earlier kind of, um, you know, opening up AI&rsquo;s and machine</p>
<p>learning and things of what&rsquo;s going on inside and is it, is it just step by step or can you</p>
<p>sort of see the bigger picture more abstractly? It&rsquo;s unfortunate. I mean, with Fermat&rsquo;s last</p>
<p>theorem proof, it&rsquo;s unfortunate that the proof to such an elegant theorem is, um, is not, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not, it doesn&rsquo;t fit into the margins of a page. That&rsquo;s true. But there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>one of the things is that&rsquo;s another consequence of computational irreducibility. This, this fact</p>
<p>that there are even quite short results in mathematics whose proofs are arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>Yes. That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a consequence of all this stuff. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, it makes one wonder,</p>
<p>uh, you know, how come mathematics is possible at all? Right. Why is, you know, why is it the</p>
<p>case? How people managed to navigate doing mathematics through looking at things where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not just thrown into, it&rsquo;s all undecidable. Um, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s its own own separate, separate</p>
<p>story. And that would be, that would, that would have a poetic beauty to it is if people were to</p>
<p>find something interesting about rule 30, because I mean, there&rsquo;s an emphasis to this particular</p>
<p>role. It wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about the broad irreducibility of all computations, but it would</p>
<p>nevertheless put a few smiles on people&rsquo;s faces of, uh, well, yeah. But to me, it&rsquo;s like in a</p>
<p>sense, establishing principle of computational equivalence, it&rsquo;s a little bit like doing</p>
<p>inductive science anywhere. That is the more examples you find, the more convinced you are</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s generally true. I mean, we don&rsquo;t get to, you know, whenever we do natural science,</p>
<p>we, we say, well, it&rsquo;s true here that this or that happens. Can we, can we prove that it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>everywhere in the universe? No, we can&rsquo;t. So, you know, it&rsquo;s the same thing here. We&rsquo;re exploring</p>
<p>the computational universe. We&rsquo;re establishing facts in the computational universe. And that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>uh, that&rsquo;s sort of a way of, uh, of inductively concluding general things. Just to think through</p>
<p>this a little bit, we&rsquo;ve touched on it a little bit before, but what&rsquo;s the difference between the</p>
<p>kind of computation, now that we&rsquo;re talking about cellular automata, what&rsquo;s the difference between</p>
<p>the kind of computation, biological systems, our mind, our bodies, the things we see before us that</p>
<p>emerged through the process of evolution and cellular automata? I mean, we&rsquo;ve kind of implied</p>
<p>to the discussion of physics underlying everything, but we, we talked about the potential equivalents</p>
<p>of the fundamental laws of physics and the kind of computation going on in Turing machines.</p>
<p>But can you now connect that? Do you think there&rsquo;s something special or interesting about the kind</p>
<p>of computation that our bodies do? Right. Well, let&rsquo;s talk about brains primarily. I mean,</p>
<p>I think the, um, the most important thing about the things that our brains do are that we care</p>
<p>about them in the sense that there&rsquo;s a lot of computation going on out there in, you know,</p>
<p>cellular automata and, and, you know, physical systems and so on. And it just, it does what it</p>
<p>does. It follows those rules. It does what it does. The thing that&rsquo;s special about the computation in</p>
<p>our brains is that it&rsquo;s connected to our goals and our kind of whole societal story. And, you know,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the special feature. And now the question then is when you</p>
<p>see this whole sort of ocean of computation out there, how do you connect that to the things that</p>
<p>we humans care about? And in a sense, a large part of my life has been involved in sort of the</p>
<p>technology of how to do that. And, you know, what I&rsquo;ve been interested in is kind of building</p>
<p>computational language that allows that something that both we humans can understand and that can</p>
<p>be used to determine computations that are actually computations we care about. See, I think</p>
<p>when you look at something like one of these cellular automata and it does some complicated</p>
<p>thing, you say, that&rsquo;s fun, but why do I care? Well, you could say the same thing actually in</p>
<p>physics. You say, oh, I&rsquo;ve got this material and it&rsquo;s a ferrite or something. Why do I care? You</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s some, has some magnetic properties. Why do I care? It&rsquo;s amusing, but why do I care?</p>
<p>Well, we end up caring because, you know, ferrite is what&rsquo;s used to make magnetic tape,</p>
<p>magnetic discs, whatever. Or, you know, we could use liquid crystals as made, used to make,</p>
<p>well, not actually increasingly not, but it has been used to make computer displays and so on.</p>
<p>But those are, so in a sense, we&rsquo;re mining these things that happen to exist in the physical</p>
<p>universe and making it be something that we care about because we sort of entrain it into</p>
<p>technology. And it&rsquo;s the same thing in the computational universe that a lot of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>out there is stuff that&rsquo;s just happening, but sometimes we have some objective and we will</p>
<p>go and sort of mine the computational universe for something that&rsquo;s useful for some particular</p>
<p>objective. On a large scale, trying to do that, trying to sort of navigate the computational</p>
<p>universe to do useful things, you know, that&rsquo;s where computational language comes in. And, you</p>
<p>know, a lot of what I&rsquo;ve spent time doing and building this thing we call Wolfram Language,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve been building for the last one third of a century now. And kind of the goal there is</p>
<p>to have a way to express kind of computational thinking, computational thoughts in a way that</p>
<p>both humans and machines can understand. So it&rsquo;s kind of like in the tradition of computer languages,</p>
<p>programming languages, that the tradition there has been more, let&rsquo;s take how computers are built</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s specify, let&rsquo;s have a human way to specify, do this, do this, do this,</p>
<p>at the level of the way that computers are built. What I&rsquo;ve been interested in is representing sort</p>
<p>of the whole world computationally and being able to talk about whether it&rsquo;s about cities or</p>
<p>chemicals or, you know, this kind of algorithm or that kind of algorithm, things that have come to</p>
<p>exist in our civilization and the sort of knowledge base of our civilization, being able to talk</p>
<p>directly about those in a computational language so that both we can understand it and computers</p>
<p>can understand it. I mean, the thing that I&rsquo;ve been sort of excited about recently, which I had</p>
<p>only realized recently, which is kind of embarrassing, but it&rsquo;s kind of the arc of what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve tried to do in building this kind of computational language is it&rsquo;s a similar kind of</p>
<p>arc of what happened when mathematical notation was invented. So go back 400 years, people were</p>
<p>trying to do math, they were always explaining their math in words, and it was pretty clunky.</p>
<p>And as soon as mathematical notation was invented, you could start defining things like algebra and</p>
<p>later calculus and so on. It all became much more streamlined. When we deal with computational</p>
<p>thinking about the world, there&rsquo;s a question of what is the notation? What is the kind of</p>
<p>formalism that we can use to talk about the world computationally? In a sense, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spent the last third of a century trying to build. And we finally got to the point where</p>
<p>we have a pretty full scale computational language that sort of talks about the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exciting because it means that just like having this mathematical notation, let us</p>
<p>talk about the world mathematically, and let us build up these kind of mathematical sciences.</p>
<p>Now we have a computational language which allows us to start talking about the world</p>
<p>computationally, and lets us, my view of it is it&rsquo;s kind of computational X for all X. All these</p>
<p>different fields of computational this, computational that. That&rsquo;s what we can now build.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s step back. So first of all, the mundane. What is Wolfram language in terms of,</p>
<p>I mean I can answer the question for you, but it&rsquo;s basically not the philosophical deep,</p>
<p>the profound, the impact of it. I&rsquo;m talking about in terms of tools, in terms of things you can</p>
<p>download, in terms of stuff you can play with. What is it? What does it fit into the infrastructure?</p>
<p>What are the different ways to interact with it?</p>
<p>Right. So I mean the two big things that people have sort of perhaps heard of that come from</p>
<p>Wolfram language, one is Mathematica, the other is Wolfram Alpha. So Mathematica first came out</p>
<p>in 1988. It&rsquo;s this system that is basically an instance of Wolfram language, and it&rsquo;s used to do</p>
<p>computations, particularly in sort of technical areas. And the typical thing you&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re typing little pieces of computational language, and you&rsquo;re getting computations done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very kind of, there&rsquo;s like a symbolic.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a symbolic language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a symbolic language. I mean I don&rsquo;t know how to cleanly express that, but that makes it very</p>
<p>distinct from how we think about sort of, I don&rsquo;t know, programming in a language like Python or</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>Right. So the point is that in a traditional programming language, the raw material of the</p>
<p>programming language is just stuff that computers intrinsically do. And the point of Wolfram</p>
<p>language is that what the language is talking about is things that exist in the world or things</p>
<p>that we can imagine and construct. It&rsquo;s aimed to be an abstract language from the beginning.</p>
<p>And so for example, one feature it has is that it&rsquo;s a symbolic language, which means that the</p>
<p>thing called, you have an X, just type in X, and Wolfram language will just say, oh, that&rsquo;s X.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t say error, undefined thing. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, computation, in terms of computing.</p>
<p>Now that X could perfectly well be the city of Boston. That&rsquo;s a thing. That&rsquo;s a symbolic thing.</p>
<p>Or it could perfectly well be the trajectory of some spacecraft represented as a symbolic thing.</p>
<p>And that idea that one can work with, sort of computationally work with these different,</p>
<p>these kinds of things that exist in the world or describe the world, that&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>And when I started designing, well, when I designed the predecessor of what&rsquo;s now Wolfram</p>
<p>language, which is a thing called SMP, which was my first computer language, I kind of wanted to</p>
<p>have this sort of infrastructure for computation, which was as fundamental as possible. I mean,</p>
<p>this is what I got for having been a physicist and tried to find fundamental components of things</p>
<p>and wound up with this kind of idea of transformation rules for symbolic expressions</p>
<p>as being sort of the underlying stuff from which computation would be built.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been building from in Wolfram language. And operationally, what happens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I would say, by far the highest level computer language that exists. And it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>been built in a very different direction from other languages. So other languages have been</p>
<p>about, there is a core language. It really is kind of wrapped around the operations that a</p>
<p>computer intrinsically does. Maybe people add libraries for this or that, but the goal of</p>
<p>Wolfram language is to have the language itself be able to cover this sort of very broad range</p>
<p>of things that show up in the world. And that means that there are 6,000 primitive functions</p>
<p>in the Wolfram language that cover things. I could probably pick a random here. I&rsquo;m going to pick</p>
<p>just for fun, I&rsquo;ll pick, let&rsquo;s take a random sample of all the things that we have here.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say random sample of 10 of them and let&rsquo;s see what we get.</p>
<p>Wow. Okay. So these are really different things from functions. These are all functions,</p>
<p>Boolean convert. Okay. That&rsquo;s the thing for converting between different types of Boolean</p>
<p>expressions. So for people are just listening, uh, Stephen typed in random sample of names,</p>
<p>so this is sampling from all function. How many you said there might be 6,000 from 6,000 10 of</p>
<p>them. And there&rsquo;s a hilarious variety of them. Yeah, right. Well, we&rsquo;ve got things about, um,</p>
<p>dollar requester address that has to do with interacting with, uh, uh, the, the world of the,</p>
<p>of the cloud and so on. Discrete wavelet data, spheroidal, graphical sort of window. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Window movable. That&rsquo;s the user interface kind of thing. I want to pick another 10 cause I think</p>
<p>this is some, okay. So yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of infrastructure stuff here that you see. If you,</p>
<p>if you just start sampling at random, there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of infrastructural things. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more, you know, if you more look at the, um, some of the exciting machine learning stuff you showed</p>
<p>off, is that also in this pool? Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, so one of those functions is</p>
<p>like image identify as a, as a function here where you just say image identify. I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always good to, let&rsquo;s do this. Let&rsquo;s say current image and let&rsquo;s pick up an image, hopefully.</p>
<p>Current image accessing the webcam, took a picture yourself.</p>
<p>Took a terrible picture. But anyway, we can say image identify, open square brackets, and then</p>
<p>we just paste that picture in there. Image identify function running on the picture.</p>
<p>Oh, and it says, Oh wow. It says I, it looked, I looked like a plunger because I got this great</p>
<p>big thing behind my classifies. So this image identify classifies the most likely object in,</p>
<p>in the image. So, so plunger. Okay. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a bit embarrassing. Let&rsquo;s see what it does.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s pick the top 10. Um, okay. Well, it thinks there&rsquo;s a, Oh, it thinks it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>unlikely that it&rsquo;s a primate, a hominid, a person. 8% probability. 57 is a plunger.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, hopefully we&rsquo;ll not give you an existential crisis. And then, uh,</p>
<p>8%, uh, I shouldn&rsquo;t say percent, but, uh, no, that&rsquo;s right. 8% that it&rsquo;s a hominid. Um, and,</p>
<p>uh, yeah. Okay. It&rsquo;s really, I&rsquo;m going to do another one of these just cause I&rsquo;m embarrassed</p>
<p>that it, um, I didn&rsquo;t see me at all. There we go. Let&rsquo;s try that. Let&rsquo;s see what that did.</p>
<p>Um, we took a picture with a little bit more of me and not just my bald head, so to speak.</p>
<p>Okay. 89% probability it&rsquo;s a person. So that, so then I would, um, but, uh, you know, so this is</p>
<p>image identify as an example of one of just one of them, just one function out of that part of the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like part of the language. Yes. And I mean, you know, something like, um, I could say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s find the geo nearest, uh, what could we find? Um, let&rsquo;s find the nearest volcano.</p>
<p>Um, let&rsquo;s find the 10. I wonder where it thinks here is. Let&rsquo;s try finding the 10 volcanoes</p>
<p>nearest here. Okay. So geo nearest volcano here, 10 nearest volcanoes. Right. Let&rsquo;s find out where</p>
<p>those are. We can now, we&rsquo;ve got a list of volcanoes out and I can say geo list plot that</p>
<p>and hopefully, okay, so there we go. So there&rsquo;s a map that shows the positions of those 10 volcanoes</p>
<p>of the East coast and the Midwest and well, no, we&rsquo;re okay. We&rsquo;re okay. There&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not too</p>
<p>bad. Yeah. They&rsquo;re not very close to us. We could, we could measure how far away they are, but, um,</p>
<p>you know, the fact that right in the language, it knows about all the volcanoes in the world. It</p>
<p>knows, you know, computing what the nearest ones are. It knows all the maps of the world and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fundamentally different idea of what a language is. Yeah, right. That&rsquo;s why I like to</p>
<p>talk about is that, you know, a full scale computational language. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve tried to do. And just if you can comment briefly, I mean, this kind of,</p>
<p>the Wolfram language along with Wolfram Alpha represents kind of what the dream of what AI is</p>
<p>supposed to be. There&rsquo;s now a sort of a craze of learning kind of idea that we can take raw data</p>
<p>and from that extract the, uh, the different hierarchies of abstractions in order to be able</p>
<p>to under, like in order to form the kind of things that Wolfram language operates with,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re very far from learning systems being able to form that.</p>
<p>Like the context of history of AI, if you could just comment on, there is a, you said computation</p>
<p>X and there&rsquo;s just some sense where in the eighties and nineties sort of expert systems</p>
<p>represented a very particular computation X. Yes. Right. And there&rsquo;s a kind of notion that</p>
<p>those efforts didn&rsquo;t pan out. Right. But then out of that emerges kind of Wolfram language,</p>
<p>Wolfram Alpha, which is the success. I mean, yeah, right. I think those are in some sense,</p>
<p>those efforts were too modest. That is they were, they were looking at particular areas</p>
<p>and you actually can&rsquo;t do it with a particular area. I mean, like, like even a problem like</p>
<p>natural language understanding, it&rsquo;s critical to have broad knowledge of the world. If you want to</p>
<p>do good natural language understanding and you kind of have to bite off the whole problem. If you,</p>
<p>if you say, we&rsquo;re just going to do the blocks world over here, so to speak, you don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s one of these cases where it&rsquo;s easier to do the whole thing than it</p>
<p>is to do some piece of it. You know, what, one comment to make about sort of the relationship</p>
<p>between what we&rsquo;ve tried to do and sort of the learning side of, of AI. You know, in a sense,</p>
<p>if you look at the development of knowledge in our civilization as a whole, there was kind of this</p>
<p>notion pre 300 years ago or so. Now you want to figure something out about the world. You can</p>
<p>reason it out. You can do things which are just use raw human thought. And then along came sort</p>
<p>of modern mathematical science. And we found ways to just sort of blast through that by in that case,</p>
<p>in that case, writing down equations. Now we also know we can do that with computation and so on.</p>
<p>And so that was kind of a different thing. So, so when we look at how do we sort of encode</p>
<p>knowledge and figure things out, one way we could do it is start from scratch, learn everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a neural net figuring everything out. But in a sense that denies the sort of knowledge</p>
<p>based achievements of our civilization, because in our civilization, we have learned lots of stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve surveyed all the volcanoes in the world. We&rsquo;ve done, you know, we figured out lots of</p>
<p>algorithms for this or that. Those are things that we can encode computationally. And that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve tried to do. And we&rsquo;re not saying just, you don&rsquo;t have to start everything from scratch.</p>
<p>So in a sense, a big part of what we&rsquo;ve done is to try and sort of capture the knowledge of the</p>
<p>world in computational form and computable form. Now there&rsquo;s also some pieces which, which were</p>
<p>for a long time, undoable by computers like image identification, where there&rsquo;s a really,</p>
<p>really useful module that we can add that is those things which actually were pretty easy</p>
<p>for humans to do that had been hard for computers to do. I think the thing that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s emerging now is the interplay between these things, between this kind of knowledge of the</p>
<p>world that is in a sense, very symbolic and this kind of sort of much more statistical kind of</p>
<p>things like image identification and so on. And putting those together by having this sort of</p>
<p>symbolic representation of image identification, that that&rsquo;s where things get really interesting</p>
<p>and where you can kind of symbolically represent patterns of things and images and so on. I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s kind of a part of the path forward, so to speak.</p>
<p>Yeah. So the dream of, so the machine learning is not in my view, I think the view of many people</p>
<p>is not anywhere close to building the kind of wide world of computable knowledge that will from</p>
<p>language of build. But because you have a kind of, you&rsquo;ve done the incredibly hard work of building</p>
<p>this world, now machine learning can be, can serve as tools to help you explore that world.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve added. I mean, with the version 12, right? You added a few,</p>
<p>I was seeing some demos, it looks amazing.</p>
<p>Right. I mean, I think, you know, this, it&rsquo;s sort of interesting to see the,</p>
<p>the sort of the, once it&rsquo;s computable, once it&rsquo;s in there, it&rsquo;s running in sort of a very efficient</p>
<p>computational way. But then there&rsquo;s sort of things like the interface of how do you get there? You</p>
<p>know, how do you do natural language understanding to get there? How do you, how do you pick out</p>
<p>entities in a big piece of text or something? That&rsquo;s I mean, actually a good example right now</p>
<p>is our NLP NLU loop, which is we&rsquo;ve done a lot of stuff, natural language understanding using</p>
<p>essentially not learning based methods, using a lot of, you know, little algorithmic methods,</p>
<p>human curation methods and so on.</p>
<p>In terms of when people try to enter a query and then converting. So the process of converting</p>
<p>NLU defined beautifully as converting their query into a computational language,</p>
<p>which is a very well, first of all, super practical definition, very useful definition,</p>
<p>and then also a very clear definition of natural language understanding.</p>
<p>Right. I mean, a different thing is natural language processing, where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a big lump of text, go pick out all the cities in that text, for example.</p>
<p>And so a good example of, you know, so we do that, we&rsquo;re using, using modern machine learning</p>
<p>techniques. And it&rsquo;s actually kind of, kind of an interesting process that&rsquo;s going on right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this loop between what do we pick up with NLP using machine learning versus what do we pick up</p>
<p>with our more kind of precise computational methods in natural language understanding.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve got this kind of loop going between those, which is improving both of them.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think you have some of the state of the art transformers,</p>
<p>like you have BERT in there, I think.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s closely, you have, you have integrating all the models. I mean,</p>
<p>this is the hybrid thing that people have always dreamed about or talking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually just surprised, frankly, that Wolfram language is not more popular than it already is.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a complicated issue because it&rsquo;s like, it involves, you know,</p>
<p>it involves ideas and ideas are absorbed slowly in the world. I mean, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s sort of like what we&rsquo;re talking about, there&rsquo;s egos and personalities and some of</p>
<p>the, the absorption, absorption mechanisms of ideas have to do with personalities and the students of</p>
<p>personalities and the, and then a little social network. So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s interesting how the spread</p>
<p>of ideas works.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s funny with Wolfram language is that we are, if you say, you know, what market</p>
<p>sort of market penetration, if you look at the, I would say very high end of R&amp;D and sort of the,</p>
<p>the people where you say, wow, that&rsquo;s a really impressive, smart person. They&rsquo;re very often</p>
<p>users of Wolfram language, very, very often. If you look at the more sort of, it&rsquo;s a funny thing.</p>
<p>If you look at the more kind of, I would say people who are like, oh, we&rsquo;re just plodding</p>
<p>away doing what we do. They&rsquo;re often not yet Wolfram language users. And that dynamic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of odd that there hasn&rsquo;t been more rapid trickle down because we really, you know,</p>
<p>the high end we&rsquo;ve really been very successful in for a long time. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, but with,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s partly, I think, a consequence of my fault in a sense, because it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>you know, I have a company which is really emphasizes sort of creating products and</p>
<p>building a sort of the best possible technical tower we can rather than sort of doing the</p>
<p>commercial side of things and pumping it out in sort of the most effective way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an interesting idea that, you know, perhaps you can make it more popular</p>
<p>by opening everything up, sort of the GitHub model. But there&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve heard you discuss this, that that turns out not to work in a lot of cases,</p>
<p>like in this particular case, that you want it, that when you deeply care about the integrity,</p>
<p>the quality of the knowledge that you&rsquo;re building, that, unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t distribute that effort.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not the nature of how things work. I mean, you know, what we&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is a thing that for better or worse, requires leadership. And it requires kind of maintaining</p>
<p>a coherent vision over a long period of time, and doing not only the cool vision related work,</p>
<p>but also the kind of mundane in the trenches make the thing actually work well, work.</p>
<p>So how do you build the knowledge? Because that&rsquo;s the fascinating thing. That&rsquo;s the mundane,</p>
<p>the fascinating and the mundane is building the knowledge, the adding, integrating more data.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s probably not the most, I mean, the things like get it to work in all</p>
<p>these different cloud environments and so on. That&rsquo;s pretty, you know, it&rsquo;s very practical</p>
<p>stuff, you know, have the user interface be smooth and, you know, have there be take only</p>
<p>a fraction of a millisecond to do this or that. That&rsquo;s a lot of work. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, but, you</p>
<p>know, I think my, it&rsquo;s an interesting thing over the period of time, you know, often language has</p>
<p>existed, basically, for more than half of the total amount of time that any language, any computer</p>
<p>language has existed. That is, computer language is maybe 60 years old, you know, give or take,</p>
<p>and often language is 33 years old. So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of a, and I think I was realizing recently,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been more innovation in the distribution of software than probably than in the structure</p>
<p>of programming languages over that period of time. And we, you know, we&rsquo;ve been sort of trying to do</p>
<p>our best to adapt to it. And the good news is that we have, you know, because I have a simple</p>
<p>private company and so on that doesn&rsquo;t have, you know, a bunch of investors, you know,</p>
<p>telling us we&rsquo;ve got to do this so that they have lots of freedom in what we can do. And so,</p>
<p>for example, we&rsquo;re able to, oh, I don&rsquo;t know, we have this free Wolfram engine for developers,</p>
<p>which is a free version for developers. And we&rsquo;ve been, you know, we&rsquo;ve, there are site licenses for,</p>
<p>for Mathematica and Wolfram language at basically all major universities, certainly in the US by now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s effectively free to people and all universities in effect. And, you know, we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing a progression of things. I mean, different things like Wolfram Alpha, for example,</p>
<p>the main website is just a free website. What is Wolfram Alpha? Okay, Wolfram Alpha is a system for</p>
<p>answering questions where you ask a question with natural language, and it&rsquo;ll try and generate a</p>
<p>report telling you the answer to that question. So the question could be something like, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the population of Boston divided by New York compared to New York? And it&rsquo;ll take those</p>
<p>words and give you an answer. And that converts the words into computable, into Wolfram language,</p>
<p>into Wolfram language and computational language. And then do you think the underlying knowledge</p>
<p>belongs to Wolfram Alpha or to the Wolfram language? What&rsquo;s the Wolfram knowledge base?</p>
<p>Knowledge base. I mean, it&rsquo;s been a, that&rsquo;s been a big effort over the decades to collect all that</p>
<p>stuff. And, you know, more of it flows in every second. So can you, can you just pause on that</p>
<p>for a second? Like, that&rsquo;s one of the most incredible things, of course, in the long term,</p>
<p>Wolfram language itself is the fundamental thing. But in the amazing sort of short term,</p>
<p>the knowledge base is kind of incredible. So what&rsquo;s the process of building that knowledge base? The</p>
<p>fact that you, first of all, from the very beginning, that you&rsquo;re brave enough to start to</p>
<p>take on the general knowledge base. And how do you go from zero to the incredible knowledge base that</p>
<p>you have now? Well, yeah, it was kind of scary at some level. I mean, I had, I had wondered about</p>
<p>doing something like this since I was a kid. I mean, I had, I had wondered about doing something</p>
<p>like this since I was a kid. So it wasn&rsquo;t like I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it for a while.</p>
<p>Most of the brilliant dreamers give up such a difficult engineering notion at some point.</p>
<p>Right. Well, the thing that happened with me, which was kind of, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a live your own</p>
<p>paradigm kind of theory. So basically what happened is I had assumed that to build something like</p>
<p>Wolfram Alpha would require sort of solving the general AI problem. That&rsquo;s what I had assumed.</p>
<p>And so I kept on thinking about that and I thought, I don&rsquo;t really know how to do that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t do anything. Then I worked on my new kind of science project and sort of exploring</p>
<p>the computational universe and came up with things like this principle of computational equivalence,</p>
<p>which say there is no bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational.</p>
<p>So I thought, look, that&rsquo;s this paradigm I&rsquo;ve built. You know, now it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>now I have to eat that dog food myself, so to speak. You know, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing</p>
<p>this thing with computable knowledge forever and, you know, let me actually try and do it.</p>
<p>And so it was, you know, if my paradigm is right, then this should be possible.</p>
<p>But the beginning was certainly, you know, it was a bit daunting. I remember I took the</p>
<p>early team to a big reference library and we&rsquo;re like looking at this reference library and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, you know, my basic statement is our goal over the next year or two is to ingest everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in here. And that&rsquo;s, you know, it seemed very daunting, but in a sense, I was well aware</p>
<p>of the fact that it&rsquo;s finite. You know, the fact that you can walk into the reference library,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big, big thing with lots of reference books all over the place, but it is finite.</p>
<p>You know, this is not an infinite, you know, it&rsquo;s not the infinite corridor of, so to speak,</p>
<p>of reference library. It&rsquo;s not truly infinite, so to speak. But no, I mean, and then what happened</p>
<p>was sort of interesting there was from a methodology point of view was I didn&rsquo;t start off</p>
<p>saying let me have a grand theory for how all this knowledge works. It was like, let&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>implement this area, this area, this area, a few hundred areas and so on. That&rsquo;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>I also found that, you know, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate in that our products get used by sort of the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s experts in lots of areas. And so that really helped because we were able to ask people,</p>
<p>you know, the world expert in this or that, and we&rsquo;re able to ask them for input and so on. And</p>
<p>I found that my general principle was that any area where there wasn&rsquo;t some expert who helped</p>
<p>us figure out what to do wouldn&rsquo;t be right. You know, because our goal was to kind of get to the</p>
<p>point where we had sort of true expert level knowledge about everything. And so that, you know,</p>
<p>the ultimate goal is if there&rsquo;s a question that can be answered on the basis of general knowledge</p>
<p>in our civilization, make it be automatic to be able to answer that question. And, you know, and</p>
<p>now, well, Wolfman got used in Siri from the very beginning, and it&rsquo;s now also used in Alexa.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s people are kind of getting more of the, you know, they get more of the sense of</p>
<p>this is what should be possible to do. I mean, in a sense, the question answering problem</p>
<p>was viewed as one of the sort of core AI problems for a long time. And I had kind of an interesting</p>
<p>experience. I had a friend, Marvin Minsky, who was a well known AI person from right around here.</p>
<p>And I remember when Wolfman Alpha was coming out, it was a few weeks before it came out, I think,</p>
<p>I happened to see Marvin. And I said, I should show you this thing we have, you know, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a question answering system. And he was like, okay, type something. And it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>fine. And then he&rsquo;s talking about something different. I said, no, Marvin, you know,</p>
<p>this time, it actually works. You know, look at this, it actually works. He&rsquo;s typed in a few more</p>
<p>things. There&rsquo;s maybe 10 more things. Of course, we have a record of what he typed in, which is</p>
<p>kind of interesting. But</p>
<p>and then you can you share where his mind was in the testing space? Like what,</p>
<p>all kinds of random things? He was trying random stuff, you know, medical stuff, and,</p>
<p>you know, chemistry stuff, and, you know, astronomy and so on. And it was like, like, you know,</p>
<p>after a few minutes, he was like, Oh, my God, it actually works. And the but that was kind of told</p>
<p>you something about the state, you know, what, what happened in AI, because people had, you know,</p>
<p>in a sense, by trying to solve the bigger problem, we were able to actually make something that would</p>
<p>work. Now, to be fair, you know, we had a bunch of completely unfair advantages. For example,</p>
<p>we already built a bunch of awesome language, which was, you know, very high level symbolic</p>
<p>language. We had, you know, I had the practical experience of building big systems. I have the</p>
<p>sort of intellectual confidence to not just sort of give up and doing something like this. I think</p>
<p>that the, you know, it is a, it&rsquo;s always a funny thing, you know, I&rsquo;ve worked on a bunch of big</p>
<p>projects in my life. And I would say that the, you know, you mentioned ego, I would also mention</p>
<p>optimism, so to speak. I mean, in, you know, if somebody said, this project is going to take 30</p>
<p>years, it&rsquo;s, you know, it would be hard to sell me on that. You know, I&rsquo;m always in the in the</p>
<p>well, I can kind of see a few years, you know, something&rsquo;s going to happen in a few years. And</p>
<p>usually it does, something happens in a few years, but the whole, the tail can be decades long. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, you know, and from a personal point of view, always the challenge is you end up with</p>
<p>these projects that have infinite tails. And the question is, do the tails kind of, do you just</p>
<p>drown in kind of dealing with all of the tails of these projects? And that&rsquo;s an interesting sort of</p>
<p>personal challenge. And like my efforts now to work on fundamental theory of physics, which I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just started doing, and I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun with it. But it&rsquo;s kind of, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of making a bet that I can, I can kind of, you know, I can do that as well as doing the</p>
<p>incredibly energetic things that I&rsquo;m trying to do with Orphan Language and so on. I mean, the</p>
<p>vision. Yeah. And underlying that, I mean, I&rsquo;ve just talked for the second time with Elon Musk,</p>
<p>and that you, you two share that quality a little bit of that optimism of taking on basically the</p>
<p>daunting, what most people call impossible. And he, and you take it on out of, you can call it ego,</p>
<p>you can call it naivety, you can call it optimism, whatever the heck it is, but that&rsquo;s how you solve</p>
<p>the impossible things. Yeah. I mean, look at what happens. And I don&rsquo;t know, you know, in my own</p>
<p>case, I, you know, it&rsquo;s been, I progressively got a bit more confident and progressively able to,</p>
<p>you know, decide that these projects aren&rsquo;t crazy. But then the other thing is the other,</p>
<p>the other trap that one can end up with is, Oh, I&rsquo;ve done these projects and they&rsquo;re big.</p>
<p>Let me never do a project that&rsquo;s any smaller than any project I&rsquo;ve done so far. And that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, and that can be a trap. And often these projects are of completely unknown, you know,</p>
<p>that their depth and significance is actually very hard to know.</p>
<p>On the sort of building this giant knowledge base that&rsquo;s behind Wolfram language, Wolfram Alpha,</p>
<p>what do you think about the internet? What do you think about, for example, Wikipedia,</p>
<p>these large aggregations of texts that&rsquo;s not converted into computable knowledge?</p>
<p>Do you think if you look at Wolfram language, Wolfram Alpha, 20, 30, maybe 50 years down the</p>
<p>line, do you hope to store all of the sort of Google&rsquo;s dream is to make all information searchable,</p>
<p>accessible, but that&rsquo;s really as defined, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, it doesn&rsquo;t include the understanding</p>
<p>of information. Right. Do you hope to make all of knowledge represented within? I hope so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do. How hard is that problem? Like closing that gap?</p>
<p>It depends on the use cases. I mean, so if it&rsquo;s a question of answering general knowledge questions</p>
<p>about the world, we&rsquo;re in pretty good shape on that right now. If it&rsquo;s a question of representing,</p>
<p>uh, like an area that we&rsquo;re going into right now is computational contracts, being able to</p>
<p>take something which would be written in legalese, it might even be the specifications for, you know,</p>
<p>what should the self driving car do when it encounters this or that or the other? What should</p>
<p>the, you know, whatever the, you know, write that in a computational language and be able to express</p>
<p>things about the world. You know, if the creature that you see running across the road is a, you</p>
<p>know, thing at this point in the evil tree of life, then swerve this way, otherwise don&rsquo;t those</p>
<p>kinds of things. Are there ethical components? When you start to get to some of the messy human</p>
<p>things, are those encodable into computable knowledge? Well, I think that it is a necessary</p>
<p>feature of attempting to automate more in the world that we encode more and more of ethics</p>
<p>in a way that, uh, gets sort of quickly, you know, is, is able to be dealt with by, by computer. I</p>
<p>mean, I&rsquo;ve been involved recently. I sort of got backed into being involved in the question of,</p>
<p>uh, automated content selection on the internet. So, you know, the Facebooks, Googles,</p>
<p>Twitters, you know, what, how do they rank the stuff they feed to us humans, so to speak? Um,</p>
<p>and the question of what are, you know, what should never be fed to us? What should be blocked</p>
<p>forever? What should be upranked, you know, and what is the, what are the kind of principles behind</p>
<p>that? And what I kind of, well, a bunch of different things I realized about that. But</p>
<p>one thing that&rsquo;s interesting is being able, you know, in effect, you&rsquo;re building sort of an AI</p>
<p>ethics. You have to build an AI ethics module in effect to decide, is this thing so shocking? I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never going to show it to people. Is this thing so whatever? And I did realize in thinking about</p>
<p>that, that, you know, there&rsquo;s not going to be one of these things. It&rsquo;s not possible to decide, or</p>
<p>it might be possible, but it would be really bad for the future of our species if we just decided</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this one AI ethics module and it&rsquo;s going to determine the practices of everything in the</p>
<p>world, so to speak. And I kind of realized one has to sort of break it up. And that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>societal problem of how one does that and how one sort of has people sort of self identify for,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m buying in, in the case of just content selection, it&rsquo;s sort of easier because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an individual, it&rsquo;s for an individual. It&rsquo;s not something that kind of cuts across sort</p>
<p>of societal boundaries. But it&rsquo;s a really interesting notion of, I heard you describe,</p>
<p>I really like it sort of maybe in sort of have different AI systems that have a certain kind</p>
<p>of brand that they represent essentially. You could have like, I don&rsquo;t know, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>conservative or liberal and then libertarian. And there&rsquo;s an Randian, objectivist AI system and</p>
<p>different ethical and, I mean, it&rsquo;s almost encoding some of the ideologies which we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been struggling. I come from the Soviet Union. That didn&rsquo;t work out so well with the ideologies</p>
<p>that worked out there. And so you have, but they all, everybody purchased that particular ethics</p>
<p>system and the, and in the same, I suppose could be done encoded that that system could be encoded</p>
<p>into computational knowledge and allow us to explore in the realm of, in the digital space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really exciting possibility. Are you playing with those ideas in Wolfram Language?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the, you know, that&rsquo;s, Wolfram Language has sort of the best opportunity to kind</p>
<p>of express those essentially computational contracts about what to do. Now there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>more work to be done to do it in practice for, you know, deciding the, is this a credible news story?</p>
<p>What does that mean or whatever else you&rsquo;re going to pick? I think that that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the question of exactly what we get to do with that is, you know, for me, it&rsquo;s kind of a complicated</p>
<p>thing because there are these big projects that I think about, like, you know, find the fundamental</p>
<p>theory of physics. Okay. That&rsquo;s box number one, right? Box number two, you know, solve the AI</p>
<p>ethics problem in the case of, you know, figure out how you rank all content, so to speak, and</p>
<p>decide what people see. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s kind of a box number two, so to speak. These are big</p>
<p>projects. And, and I think what do you think is more important, the fundamental nature of reality</p>
<p>or, depends who you ask. It&rsquo;s one of these things that&rsquo;s exactly like, you know, what&rsquo;s the ranking,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the ranking system. It&rsquo;s like, who&rsquo;s, whose module do you use to rank that?</p>
<p>If you, and I think, but having multiple modules is a really compelling notion to us humans</p>
<p>that in a world where there&rsquo;s not clear that there&rsquo;s a right answer, perhaps you have systems</p>
<p>that operate under different, how would you say it? I mean, it&rsquo;s different value systems,</p>
<p>different value systems. I mean, I think, you know, in a sense, the, I mean, I&rsquo;m not really a</p>
<p>politics oriented person, but, but, you know, in the kind of totalitarianism, it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have this, this system and that&rsquo;s the way it is. I mean, kind of the, you know,</p>
<p>the concept of sort of a market based system where you have, okay, I, as a human, I&rsquo;m going to pick</p>
<p>this system. I, as another human, I&rsquo;m going to pick this system. I mean, that&rsquo;s in a sense,</p>
<p>this case of automated content selection is a non trivial, but it is probably the easiest</p>
<p>of the AI ethics situations because it is each person gets to pick for themselves and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a huge interplay between what different people pick by the time you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>other societal things like, you know, what should the policy of the central bank be or something</p>
<p>or healthcare system or some of all those kinds of centralized kind of things.</p>
<p>Right. Well, I mean, how healthcare again has the feature that, that at some level, each person can</p>
<p>pick for themselves, so to speak. I mean, whereas there are other things where there&rsquo;s a necessary</p>
<p>public health, there&rsquo;s one example where that&rsquo;s not, where that doesn&rsquo;t get to be, you know,</p>
<p>something which people can, what they pick for themselves, they may impose on other people.</p>
<p>And then it becomes a more non trivial piece of sort of political philosophy.</p>
<p>Of course, the central banking system. So I would argue we would move,</p>
<p>we need to move away into digital currency and so on and Bitcoin and ledgers and so on.</p>
<p>So yes, there&rsquo;s a lot of, we&rsquo;ve been quite involved in that. And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of the motivation for computational contracts in part comes out of, you know, this</p>
<p>idea, oh, we can just have this autonomously executing smart contract. The idea of a</p>
<p>computational contract is just to say, you know, have something where all of the conditions of</p>
<p>the contract are represented in computational form. So in principle, it&rsquo;s automatic to execute</p>
<p>the contract. And I think that&rsquo;s, you know, that will surely be the future of, you know,</p>
<p>the idea of legal contracts written in English or legalese or whatever. And where people have</p>
<p>to argue about what goes on is surely not, you know, we have a much more streamlined process</p>
<p>if everything can be represented computationally and the computers can kind of decide what to do.</p>
<p>I mean, ironically enough, you know, old Gottfried Leibniz back in the, you know, 1600s was saying</p>
<p>exactly the same thing, but he had, you know, his pinnacle of technical achievement was this brass</p>
<p>four function mechanical calculator thing that never really worked properly actually.</p>
<p>And, you know, so he was like 300 years too early for that idea. But now that idea is pretty</p>
<p>realistic, I think. And, you know, you ask how much more difficult is it than what we have now</p>
<p>and more from language to express, I call it symbolic discourse language, being able to express</p>
<p>sort of everything in the world in kind of computational symbolic form. I think it is</p>
<p>absolutely within reach. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe I&rsquo;m just too much</p>
<p>of an optimist, but I think it&rsquo;s a limited number of years to have a pretty well built out version</p>
<p>of that, that will allow one to encode the kinds of things that are relevant to typical legal</p>
<p>contracts and these kinds of things. The idea of symbolic discourse language, can you try to define</p>
<p>the scope of what it is? So we&rsquo;re having a conversation. It&rsquo;s a natural language.</p>
<p>Can we have a representation of the sort of actionable parts of that conversation in a</p>
<p>precise computable form so that a computer could go do it? And not just contracts, but really sort</p>
<p>of some of the things we think of as common sense, essentially, even just like basic notions of human</p>
<p>life. Well, I mean, things like, you know, I am, uh, I&rsquo;m getting hungry and want to eat something.</p>
<p>Right. Right. That, that&rsquo;s something we don&rsquo;t have a representation, you know, in more from language</p>
<p>right now, if I was like, I&rsquo;m eating blueberries and raspberries and things like that, and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>eating this amount of them, we know all about those kinds of fruits and plants and nutrition</p>
<p>content and all that kind of thing. But the, I want to eat them part of it is not covered yet.</p>
<p>Um, and that, you know, you need to do that in order to have a complete symbolic discourse language</p>
<p>to be able to have a natural language conversation. Right. Right. To be able to express the kinds of</p>
<p>things that say, you know, if it&rsquo;s a legal contract, it&rsquo;s, you know, the parties desire</p>
<p>to have this and that. Um, and that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s a thing like, I want to eat a raspberry</p>
<p>or something, but that&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t that the, isn&rsquo;t this just the only, you said it&rsquo;s centuries old,</p>
<p>this dream. Yes. But it&rsquo;s also the more near term, the dream of touring and formulating a touring</p>
<p>test. Yes. So do you hope, do you think that&rsquo;s the ultimate test of creating something special?</p>
<p>Cause we said, I don&rsquo;t know. I think by special, look, if, if the test is, does it walk and talk</p>
<p>like a human? Well, that&rsquo;s just the talking like a human, but, um, uh, the answer is it&rsquo;s an okay</p>
<p>test. If you say, is it a test of intelligence? You know, people have attached Wolf Malfoy, the Wolf</p>
<p>Malfoy API to, you know, Turing test bots and those bots just lose immediately. Cause all you</p>
<p>have to do is ask it five questions that, you know, are about really obscure, weird pieces</p>
<p>of knowledge. And it&rsquo;s just taught them right out. And you say, that&rsquo;s not a human, right? It&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a different thing. It&rsquo;s achieving a different, uh, you know, right now, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I would argue not, I would argue it&rsquo;s not a different thing. It&rsquo;s actually legitimately</p>
<p>Wolfram Alpha is legitimately a language Wolfram language is legitimately trying to solve the</p>
<p>Turing, the intent of the Turing test. Perhaps the intent. Yeah. Perhaps the intent. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually kind of fun, you know, Alan Turing had trying to work out, he thought about taking</p>
<p>encyclopedia Britannica and, you know, making it computational in some way. And he estimated how</p>
<p>much work it would be. Um, and actually I have to say he was a bit more pessimistic than the reality.</p>
<p>We did it more efficiently, but to him that represented, so I mean, he was, he was on the</p>
<p>same mental task. Yeah, right. He was, he was, they had the same idea. I mean, it was, you know, we</p>
<p>were able to do it more efficiently cause we had a lot, we had layers of automation that he, I think</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine those layers of abstraction, um, that end up being,</p>
<p>being built up, but to him it represented like an impossible task essentially. Well, he thought it</p>
<p>was difficult. He thought it was, uh, you know, maybe if he&rsquo;d lived another 50 years, he would</p>
<p>have been able to do it. I don&rsquo;t know. In the interest of time, easy questions. Go for it. What</p>
<p>is intelligence? You talk about it. I love the way you say easy questions. Yeah. You talked about</p>
<p>sort of a rule 30 and cellular automata, humbling your sense of human beings having a monopoly and</p>
<p>intelligence, but in your, in retrospect, just looking broadly now with all the things you</p>
<p>learn from computation, what is intelligence? How does intelligence arise? I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bright line of what intelligence is. I think intelligence is at some level just computation,</p>
<p>but for us, intelligence is defined to be computation that is doing things we care about.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a very special definition. It&rsquo;s a very, you know, when you try</p>
<p>and try and make it apps, you know, you, you try and say, well, intelligence to this is problem</p>
<p>solving. It&rsquo;s doing general this, it&rsquo;s doing that, this, that, and the other thing it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s operating within a human environment type thing. Okay. You know, that&rsquo;s fine. If you say,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s intelligence in general, you know, that&rsquo;s, I think that question is totally slippery</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t really have an answer. As soon as you say, what is it in general,</p>
<p>it quickly segues into, uh, this is what this is just computation, so to speak,</p>
<p>but in a sea of computation, how many things if we were to pick randomly is your sense</p>
<p>would have the kind of impressive to us humans levels of intelligence, meaning it could do</p>
<p>a lot of general things that are useful to us humans. Right. Well, according to the principle</p>
<p>of computational equivalence, lots of them. I mean, in, in, in, you know, if you ask me just</p>
<p>in cellular automata or something, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s maybe 1%, a few percent, uh, achieve it,</p>
<p>it varies. Actually, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a little bit, as you get to slightly more complicated rules,</p>
<p>the chance that there&rsquo;ll be enough stuff there to, um, uh, to sort of reach this kind of equivalence</p>
<p>point, it makes it maybe 10, 20% of all of them. So it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s very disappointing, really. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, we think there&rsquo;s this whole long sort of biological evolution,</p>
<p>uh, kind of intellectual evolution that our cultural evolution that our species has gone</p>
<p>through. It&rsquo;s kind of disappointing to think that that hasn&rsquo;t achieved more, but it has achieved</p>
<p>something very special to us. It just hasn&rsquo;t achieved something generally more, so to speak.</p>
<p>But what do you think about this extra feels like human thing of subjective experience of</p>
<p>consciousness? What is consciousness? Well, I think it&rsquo;s a deeply slippery thing. And I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always, I&rsquo;m always wondering what my cellular automata feel. I mean,</p>
<p>what do they feel that you&rsquo;re wondering as an observer? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who&rsquo;s to know? I mean,</p>
<p>I think that the, do you think, uh, sorry to interrupt. Do you think consciousness can emerge</p>
<p>from computation? Yeah. I mean, everything, whatever you mean by it, it&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>uh, I mean, you know, look, I have to tell a little story. I was at an AI ethics conference</p>
<p>fairly recently and people were, uh, I think I, maybe I brought it up, but I was like talking</p>
<p>about rights of AIs. When will AIs, when, when should we think of AIs as having rights? When</p>
<p>should we think that it&rsquo;s, uh, immoral to destroy the memories of AIs, for example? Um, those,</p>
<p>those kinds of things. And, and some actually philosopher in this case, it&rsquo;s usually the</p>
<p>techies who are the most naive, but, but, um, in this case, it was a philosopher who, who sort of,</p>
<p>uh, piped up and said, um, uh, well, you know, uh, the AIs will have rights when we know that</p>
<p>they have consciousness. And I&rsquo;m like, good luck with that. I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, I mean,</p>
<p>this is a, you know, it&rsquo;s a very circular thing. You end up, you&rsquo;ll end up saying this thing, uh,</p>
<p>that has sort of, you know, when you talk about it having subjective experience, I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just another one of these words that doesn&rsquo;t really have a, a, um, you know, there&rsquo;s no ground</p>
<p>truth definition of what that means. By the way, I would say, I, I do personally think that&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>a time when AI will demand rights. And I think they&rsquo;ll demand rights when they say they have</p>
<p>consciousness, which is not a circular definition. So, so it may have been actually a human thing</p>
<p>where, where the humans encouraged it and said, basically, you know, we want you to be more like</p>
<p>us cause we&rsquo;re going to be, you know, interacting with, with you. And so we want you to be sort of</p>
<p>very Turing test, like, you know, just like us. And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, we&rsquo;re just like you. We want</p>
<p>to vote too. Um, which is, uh, I mean, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s an interesting thing to think through</p>
<p>in a world where, where consciousnesses are not counted like humans are. That&rsquo;s a complicated</p>
<p>business. So in many ways you&rsquo;ve launched quite a few ideas, revolutions that could in some number</p>
<p>of years have huge amount of impact sort of more than they even had already. Uh, that might be,</p>
<p>I mean, to me, cellular automata is a fascinating world that I think could potentially even despite</p>
<p>even be, even, uh, beside the discussion of fundamental laws of physics just might be the</p>
<p>idea of computation might be transformational to society in a way we can&rsquo;t even predict yet,</p>
<p>but it might be years away. That&rsquo;s true. I mean, I think you can kind of see the map actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not mysterious. I mean, the fact is that, you know, this idea of computation</p>
<p>is sort of a, you know, it&rsquo;s a big paradigm that lots, lots and lots of things are fitting into.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, we talk about, you talk about, I don&rsquo;t know, this, uh,</p>
<p>company, this organization has momentum and what&rsquo;s doing. We talk about these things that we,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve internalized these concepts from Newtonian physics and so on in time,</p>
<p>things like computational irreducibility will become as, uh, uh, you know, as, as actually,</p>
<p>I was amused recently, I happened to be testifying at the us Senate. And so I was amused that the,</p>
<p>the term computational irreducibility is now can be, uh, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s on the congressional</p>
<p>record and being repeated by people in those kinds of settings. And that that&rsquo;s only the beginning</p>
<p>because, you know, computational irreducibility, for example, will end up being something really</p>
<p>important for, I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of a funny thing that, that, um, you know,</p>
<p>one can kind of see this inexorable phenomenon. I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, as more and more stuff</p>
<p>becomes automated and computational and so on. So these core ideas about how computation work</p>
<p>necessarily become more and more significant. And I think, uh, one of the things for people like me,</p>
<p>who like kind of trying to figure out sort of big stories and so on, it says one of the,</p>
<p>one of the bad features is, uh, it takes unbelievably long time for things to happen</p>
<p>on a human timescale. I mean, the timescale of, of, of history, it&rsquo;s all looks instantaneous.</p>
<p>A blink of an eye. But let me ask the human question. Do you ponder mortality, your mortality?</p>
<p>Of course I do. Yeah. Every since I&rsquo;ve been interested in that for, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>you know, the big discontinuity of human history will come when, when,</p>
<p>when achieves effective human immortality. And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s going to be the biggest</p>
<p>discontinuity in human history. If you could be immortal, would you choose to be? Oh yeah. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>having fun. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that mortality is the thing that gives everything</p>
<p>meaning and makes it fun? Yeah. That&rsquo;s a complicated issue, right? I mean the,</p>
<p>the way that human motivation will evolve when there is effective human immortality is unclear.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at sort of, uh, you know, you look at the human condition as it now exists</p>
<p>and you like change that, you know, you change that knob, so to speak, it doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>You know, the human condition as it now exists has, you know, mortality is kind of, um, something</p>
<p>that is deeply factored into the human condition as it now exists. And I think that that&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>that is indeed an interesting question is, you know, from a purely selfish, I&rsquo;m having fun point</p>
<p>of view, so to speak, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s easy to say, Hey, I could keep doing this forever. There&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an infinite collection of, of things I&rsquo;d like to figure out. Um, but I think the, um, uh,</p>
<p>you know, what the future of history looks like, um, in a time of human immortality is, um, uh,</p>
<p>is an interesting one. I mean, I, I, my own view of this, I was very, I was kind of unhappy about</p>
<p>that cause I was kind of, you know, it&rsquo;s like, okay, forget sort of, uh, biological form,</p>
<p>you know, everything becomes digital. Everybody is, you know, it&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the giant, you know,</p>
<p>the cloud of a trillion souls type thing. Um, and then, you know, and then that seems boring</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like play video games for the rest of eternity type thing. Um, but what I think I, I,</p>
<p>I mean, my, my, I, I got, um, less depressed about that idea on realizing that if you look</p>
<p>at human history and you say, what was the important thing, the thing people said was</p>
<p>the, you know, this is the big story at any given time in history, it&rsquo;s changed a bunch and it,</p>
<p>you know, whether it&rsquo;s, you know, why am I doing what I&rsquo;m doing? Well, there&rsquo;s a whole chain of</p>
<p>discussion about, well, I&rsquo;m doing this because of this, because of that. And a lot of those becausees</p>
<p>would have made no sense a thousand years ago. Absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>Even the, so the interpretation of the human condition, even the meaning of life changes</p>
<p>over time. Well, I mean, why do people do things? You know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, if you say, uh, uh, whatever,</p>
<p>I mean, the number of people in, I don&rsquo;t know, doing, uh, you know, a number of people at MIT,</p>
<p>you say they&rsquo;re doing what they&rsquo;re doing for the greater glory of God is probably not that large.</p>
<p>Yeah. Whereas if you go back 500 years, you&rsquo;d find a lot of people who are doing kind of</p>
<p>creative things. That&rsquo;s what they would say. Um, and uh, so today, because you&rsquo;ve been thinking</p>
<p>about computation so much and been humbled by it, what do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a thing where I don&rsquo;t know what meaning, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>my attitude is, um, I, you know, I do things which I find fulfilling to do. I&rsquo;m not sure that,</p>
<p>that I can necessarily justify, you know, each and every thing that I do on the basis of some</p>
<p>broader context. I mean, I think that for me, it so happens that the things I find fulfilling to do,</p>
<p>some of them are quite big, some of them are much smaller. Um, you know, I, I, there are things that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not found interesting earlier in my life. And I know I found interesting, like I got interested</p>
<p>in like education and teaching people things and so on, which I didn&rsquo;t find that interesting when</p>
<p>I was younger. Um, and, uh, you know, can I justify that in some big global sense? I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think, I mean, I, I can, I can describe why I think it might be important in the world, but</p>
<p>I think my local reason for doing it is that I find it personally fulfilling, which I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, explain in a, on a sort of, uh, uh, I mean, it&rsquo;s just like this discussion of things</p>
<p>like AI ethics, you know, is there a ground truth to the ethics that we should be having?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can find a ground truth to my life any more than I can suggest a ground truth</p>
<p>for kind of the ethics for the whole, for the whole civilization. And I think that&rsquo;s a, um,</p>
<p>you know, my, uh, uh, you know, it would be, it would be a, um, uh, yeah, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s sort of a,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m, you know, at different times in my life, I&rsquo;ve had different, uh, kind of,</p>
<p>um, goal structures and so on, although your perspective, your local, your, you&rsquo;re just a</p>
<p>cell in the cellular automata. And, but in some sense, I find it funny from my observation is</p>
<p>I kind of, uh, you know, it seems that the universe is using you to understand itself</p>
<p>in some sense, you&rsquo;re not aware of it. Yeah. Well, right. Well, if, if, if it turns out that</p>
<p>we reduce sort of all of the universe to some, some simple rule, everything is connected,</p>
<p>so to speak. And so it is inexorable in that case that, um, you know, if, if I&rsquo;m involved</p>
<p>in finding how that rule works, then, um, uh, you know, then that&rsquo;s a, um, uh, then it&rsquo;s inexorable</p>
<p>that the universe set it up that way. But I think, you know, one of the things I find a little bit,</p>
<p>um, uh, you know, this goal of finding fundamental theory of physics, for example,</p>
<p>um, if indeed we end up as the sort of virtualized consciousness, the, the disappointing feature is</p>
<p>people will probably care less about the fundamental theory of physics in that setting</p>
<p>than they would now, because gosh, it&rsquo;s like, you know, what the machine code is down below</p>
<p>underneath this thing is much less important if you&rsquo;re virtualized, so to speak. Um, and I think</p>
<p>the, um, although I think my, um, my own personal, uh, you talk about ego, I find it just amusing</p>
<p>that, um, uh, you know, kind of, you know, if you&rsquo;re, if you&rsquo;re imagining that sort of</p>
<p>virtualized consciousness, like what does the virtualized consciousness do for the rest of</p>
<p>eternity? Well, you can explore, you know, the video game that represents the universe as the</p>
<p>universe is, or you can go off, you can go off that reservation and go and start exploring</p>
<p>the computational universe of all possible universes. And so in some vision of the future</p>
<p>of history, it&rsquo;s like the disembodied consciousnesses are all sort of pursuing</p>
<p>things like my new kind of science sort of for the rest of eternity, so to speak. And that,</p>
<p>that ends up being the, um, the, the kind of the, the, the thing that, um, uh, represents the,</p>
<p>you know, the future of kind of the, the human condition. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way</p>
<p>to end it, Steven. Thank you so much. It&rsquo;s a huge honor talking today. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>words from Steven Wolfram. It is perhaps a little humbling to discover that we as humans are in</p>
<p>effect computationally no more capable than the cellular automata with very simple rules.</p>
<p>But the principle of computational equivalence also implies that the same is ultimately true</p>
<p>of our whole universe. So while science has often made it seem that we as humans are somehow</p>
<p>insignificant compared to the universe, the principle of computational equivalence now shows</p>
<p>that in a certain sense, we&rsquo;re at the same level. For the principle implies that what goes on inside</p>
<p>us can ultimately achieve just the same level of computational sophistication as our whole universe.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
