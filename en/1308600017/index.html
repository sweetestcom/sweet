    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a fan of getting blood work done.</p>
<p>And the simple reason for that</p>
<p>is that most of the things</p>
<p>that you want to know about your health,</p>
<p>such as hormones, metabolic factors,</p>
<p>blood sugar levels, et cetera,</p>
<p>can only be analyzed from blood.</p>
<p>And nowadays, there are also excellent DNA tests</p>
<p>that can also give you valuable information</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on at the cellular, molecular,</p>
<p>even the neural circuit level within your brain and body.</p>
<p>InsideTracker makes getting blood and DNA tests easy.</p>
<p>You can go to a testing site where they draw your blood,</p>
<p>they take your DNA sample,</p>
<p>or they can come to your home if you prefer that.</p>
<p>As well, they have a really amazing dashboard.</p>
<p>The dashboard lets you understand</p>
<p>what your levels of various hormones</p>
<p>and metabolic factors, et cetera, mean,</p>
<p>and what you should do about them.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the main things</p>
<p>that really separates InsideTracker</p>
<p>apart from other blood and DNA tests.</p>
<p>Most tests, you get the results back,</p>
<p>but there are no directives about what to do specifically</p>
<p>in order to bring the numbers into the ranges</p>
<p>that you would like for your goals.</p>
<p>InsideTracker makes all of that extremely simple</p>
<p>and extremely clear.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try InsideTracker,</p>
<p>you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And if you do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get 25% off any of InsideTracker&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>Use the code Huberman at checkout.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insidetracker.com slash Huberman</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I started taking Athletic Greens back in 2012,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve taken it ever since.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and the reason I still take it now,</p>
<p>is that Athletic Greens really lets me cover</p>
<p>all my nutritional bases</p>
<p>in terms of vitamins, minerals, and probiotics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much data now pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis</p>
<p>is important for metabolism and for endocrine health.</p>
<p>The vitamins, minerals, and probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>make me feel confident that I&rsquo;m covering all my bases.</p>
<p>I do take other supplements, but with Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>I know that I&rsquo;ve got all the foundational stuff handled.</p>
<p>It also tastes really good.</p>
<p>Tastes fine on its own.</p>
<p>You can mix it with water, which is what I do.</p>
<p>I add a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice,</p>
<p>because I like a little tartness flavor in there as well.</p>
<p>But most people just mix it with water.</p>
<p>It mixes up super easily.</p>
<p>I drink it once or twice a day,</p>
<p>usually once mid-morning and once again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And if you do that, you can claim their special offer,</p>
<p>which is a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There is now a ton of evidence that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is involved in countless metabolic processes,</p>
<p>hormonal processes that are important</p>
<p>for overall health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Vitamin D3, you can get from the sun, of course,</p>
<p>but most people are deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>So if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the year supply of vitamin D3 and K2,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get five free travel packs.</p>
<p>So once again, it&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get Athletic Greens, the vitamin D3K2,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a year supply, plus the five free travel packs.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Monk Pack.</p>
<p>Monk Pack is a company that makes keto-friendly snacks</p>
<p>that taste incredible,</p>
<p>but have just one gram of sugar or less.</p>
<p>And indeed, they taste incredible.</p>
<p>In fact, my production team here</p>
<p>at the Huberman Lab Podcast teases me</p>
<p>because I actually have to keep the boxes of Monk Pack bars</p>
<p>in my basement,</p>
<p>because otherwise I&rsquo;ll tear through all of them.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I tasted it,</p>
<p>I was like, all right, here we go, a keto bar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of bars in general.</p>
<p>Most of them don&rsquo;t taste good to me.</p>
<p>And I tasted the Monk Pack bars</p>
<p>and they are absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>They come in a lot of different flavors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m partial to the caramel sea salt one,</p>
<p>but they also have a sea salt dark chocolate,</p>
<p>peanut butter dark chocolate.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of flavors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all incredible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried them all,</p>
<p>which is why I keep them in my basement.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned previously on this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m neither keto nor carbo.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really follow a particular diet in that sense.</p>
<p>I eat in a way that maximizes my alertness</p>
<p>and my levels of focus during the day when I want to work,</p>
<p>and that maximize my transition to sleep at night.</p>
<p>So I basically eat low carb keto-ish</p>
<p>during the day.</p>
<p>And I know the ketonistas will say that I&rsquo;m not in ketosis</p>
<p>and I can manage to get into ketosis,</p>
<p>but the main idea is I keep my carbohydrates</p>
<p>low during the day.</p>
<p>And then at night I do eat carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So for me, the Monk Pack bars are a really good snack,</p>
<p>usually in the afternoon, maybe with a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;m going to train soon after that,</p>
<p>or if I just want a snack and I&rsquo;m going to continue working.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, they are absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>They also don&rsquo;t have any of the stuff that&rsquo;s bad for you.</p>
<p>No soy, trans fat, sugar, alcohols, artificial colors,</p>
<p>all that stuff that we know we should avoid.</p>
<p>If you want to try Monk Pack bars, you can go to Monk Pack,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s M-U-N-K, MonkPack.com,</p>
<p>and enter the code HuberMinuteCheckout,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get 20% off your first purchase</p>

<p>This month, we&rsquo;re talking all about hormones.</p>
<p>Hormones are incredible,</p>
<p>and they control so many processes in the brain and body.</p>
<p>Last episode, we talked about the role</p>
<p>of estrogen and testosterone.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how hormones impact feeding and hunger,</p>
<p>as well as satiety, the feeling that you don&rsquo;t want to eat</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;ve eaten enough.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that hormones don&rsquo;t work alone in this context.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to describe some hormones</p>
<p>that have powerful effects</p>
<p>on whether or not you want to eat more or less</p>
<p>or stop eating altogether.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t do that on their own,</p>
<p>they do that in cooperation with the nervous system.</p>
<p>So today, I would say as much,</p>
<p>or perhaps even more than any other episodes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to hear a lot of biology,</p>
<p>but there are multiple what I&rsquo;m going to call entry points</p>
<p>for tools that you can apply</p>
<p>in order to regulate your levels of hunger,</p>
<p>your meal timing, your levels of satiety</p>
<p>of not wanting to eat more.</p>
<p>And many of this is actionable with behaviors,</p>
<p>but of course, we&rsquo;re also going to talk about supplements,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re actually going to talk about</p>
<p>a little bit of brain-machine interface,</p>
<p>devices that can actually be involved</p>
<p>in manipulating these incredible things</p>
<p>that we think of as hunger and appetite and satiety.</p>
<p>So the first thing that you need to know</p>
<p>about the nervous system side,</p>
<p>the neural control over feeding and hunger,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s an area of your brain</p>
<p>called the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the forebrain,</p>
<p>which tells you it&rsquo;s in the front of your brain,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s at the base of the forebrain.</p>
<p>Now, the hypothalamus contains</p>
<p>lots of different kinds of neurons</p>
<p>doing lots of different kinds of things.</p>
<p>There are neurons in your hypothalamus</p>
<p>controlling sexual behavior,</p>
<p>controlling body temperature,</p>
<p>controlling circadian rhythms,</p>
<p>the desire to sleep or be awake,</p>
<p>even neurons controlling rage.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually neurons that if we were to stimulate them</p>
<p>would send you or anyone into a rage.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just powerful control centers</p>
<p>for the brain and body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular area of the hypothalamus</p>
<p>called the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that researchers have been interested</p>
<p>for a long time now in terms of its relationship</p>
<p>to hunger and feeding.</p>
<p>And the reason is it creates these paradoxical effects.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>What they found was that sometimes lesioning</p>
<p>or disrupting the neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>would make animals or people hyperphagic.</p>
<p>They would want to eat like crazy.</p>
<p>And other lesions in other individuals or animals</p>
<p>would make them anorexic.</p>
<p>It would make them not want to eat at all.</p>
<p>It would make food aversive.</p>
<p>So that means that the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>is definitely an interesting control station</p>
<p>for hunger and feeding and satiety,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t really tell you what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>at a deeper level.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a little bit confusing or paradoxical.</p>
<p>Turns out that there are multiple populations</p>
<p>of neurons in there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about those.</p>
<p>Some are promoting feeding</p>
<p>and some are promoting not feeding or not eating.</p>
<p>Now, the other neural component of all this</p>
<p>that you need to know about</p>
<p>actually has to do with your mouth.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an area of your cortex.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little bit further up in your brain</p>
<p>called the insular cortex.</p>
<p>And it processes a lot of different kinds of information,</p>
<p>mostly information about what&rsquo;s going on inside you,</p>
<p>so-called interoception.</p>
<p>The insular cortex has neurons</p>
<p>that get input from your mouth,</p>
<p>from the touch receptors in your mouth.</p>
<p>An insular cortex has powerful control</p>
<p>over whether or not you are enjoying what you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>whether or not you want to avoid what you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;ve had enough,</p>
<p>or whether or not you want to continue eating more.</p>
<p>And that has to do, believe it or not,</p>
<p>with the touch or sensation of eating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very familiar with this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of these people, I love eating so much</p>
<p>that I just like the mere act of chewing.</p>
<p>I like celery sticks enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not crazy about them, but they taste fine to me</p>
<p>and I like chewing on celery sticks,</p>
<p>but I actually just like chewing on them.</p>
<p>I could eat all day long,</p>
<p>except that it&rsquo;s not healthy to do that.</p>
<p>But the mere act of chewing for me is very pleasurable.</p>
<p>People who chew gum feel this way as well.</p>
<p>And just as a point about gum or chewing,</p>
<p>if you chew something like celery or cucumber slices</p>
<p>or chew gum, provided it doesn&rsquo;t have any sugar</p>
<p>or caloric content,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to drive increased hunger.</p>
<p>That generally isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>But if you eat something with sugar, as we&rsquo;ll find out,</p>
<p>it has a very specific action in the insular cortex</p>
<p>and in other areas of your nervous system</p>
<p>that promotes the desire to eat more.</p>
<p>But the key point right now</p>
<p>is to know that you got these two brain areas,</p>
<p>the ventromedial hypothalamus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in hunger and lack of hunger,</p>
<p>an accelerator and a brake on feeding.</p>
<p>And you have this insular cortex</p>
<p>that gets input from your mouth</p>
<p>and cares about chewing and the consistency of foods</p>
<p>and all sorts of interesting things</p>
<p>that are just very tactile.</p>
<p>And I think most people think about the touch receptors on,</p>
<p>excuse me, the taste receptors on the tongue,</p>
<p>but we often don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>the touch or tactile essence of food.</p>
<p>The thing that comes to mind just now</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve gone to sushi several times</p>
<p>and some people really like the urchin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the urchin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about it</p>
<p>that kind of creeps me out about the consistency.</p>
<p>Other people love it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s highly individual and it&rsquo;s probably learned.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some probably cultural background to this.</p>
<p>If you were raised eating urchin,</p>
<p>some people love that consistency or that touch.</p>
<p>So touch has a lot to do with</p>
<p>whether or not you want to eat or not.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get back to the ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Sometimes it makes animals or people want to eat more,</p>
<p>sometimes less.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a classic experiment that was done</p>
<p>in which researchers took two rats</p>
<p>and so-called parabiose to them to each other.</p>
<p>What that meant is that they did a little surgery</p>
<p>and they linked their blood supply</p>
<p>so that they were forever physically linked to one another</p>
<p>and could exchange factors in the blood,</p>
<p>but their brains were separate,</p>
<p>their mouths were separate,</p>
<p>and they essentially did everything separately</p>
<p>except that they were linked to one another.</p>
<p>So they had to walk together</p>
<p>and go to the same places in order to do it.</p>
<p>This parabiosis experiment</p>
<p>revealed something really important.</p>
<p>When they lesioned the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>in one of the rats that was connected to the other rat,</p>
<p>that rat got very, very fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really obese, huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.</p>
<p>The other one, however, got very thin.</p>
<p>It actually lost weight</p>
<p>despite consuming the same amount of food</p>
<p>that it had prior to the other one getting the lesion.</p>
<p>So what does this tell us?</p>
<p>This tells us that there&rsquo;s something in the blood</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being exchanged between the two animals</p>
<p>because it was their blood supply that was linked.</p>
<p>And that tells us that there&rsquo;s hormone or endocrine signals</p>
<p>that are involved in the desire to eat</p>
<p>and hunger and appetite.</p>
<p>And so next we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>what those endocrine signals are.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to immediately point</p>
<p>to some entry points that you can use.</p>
<p>And you can use these</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not parabiosed to anything.</p>
<p>And that can allow you to time your meal frequency</p>
<p>and predict when you&rsquo;re going to be hungry or not,</p>
<p>as well as a drive up appetite.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there are people out there</p>
<p>who are trying to eat more.</p>
<p>Although I think far many more people</p>
<p>are trying to eat less</p>
<p>because nowadays the data just point to the fact</p>
<p>that there is essentially an epidemic of diabetes,</p>
<p>type two diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>And most everyone agrees now</p>
<p>that maintaining a healthy body weight</p>
<p>and body weight composition</p>
<p>is one of the best paths to longevity</p>
<p>and to just feeling very good</p>
<p>and actually being able to think.</p>
<p>Cognitive functioning is actually linked</p>
<p>to levels of adipose tissue and so forth.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the endocrine factors</p>
<p>that regulate feeding hunger and satiety.</p>
<p>One of the really exciting things to emerge</p>
<p>in the science of feeding and appetite in the last 20 years</p>
<p>is the discovery of another brain area,</p>
<p>not just the ventromedial hypothalamus,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus.</p>
<p>And the arcuate nucleus</p>
<p>has some really fascinating sets of neurons</p>
<p>that release even more incredible molecules</p>
<p>and chemicals into the blood.</p>
<p>And these chemicals act as accelerators</p>
<p>on feeding and appetite or breaks.</p>
<p>And the really cool thing</p>
<p>is that you can actually control these molecules</p>
<p>through simple behaviors.</p>
<p>And once you understand what these molecules are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start to understand why that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>and the control points that you have right now</p>
<p>in order to control your appetite in either direction,</p>
<p>increase or decrease.</p>
<p>So first of all,</p>
<p>there are a set of neurons in this arcuate nucleus</p>
<p>called the PMOC neurons, okay?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into what the acronym stands for,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll do it anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the pro-opio-melanocortin system, okay?</p>
<p>So these are PMOC neurons, pro-opio-melanocortin.</p>
<p>And if you heard melano,</p>
<p>that should tell you it has something to do</p>
<p>with pigmentation in skin cells or in hair cells,</p>
<p>pigmentation of some sort because of melanin.</p>
<p>Last episode, I talked a little bit</p>
<p>about the relationship between light, dopamine, and melanin.</p>
<p>So you should already be thinking, wait,</p>
<p>melano means it probably has something to do</p>
<p>with that system, and indeed it does.</p>
<p>Now, the PMOC neurons make something called alpha-MSH,</p>
<p>melanocyte-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to remember</p>
<p>any of the other acronyms and terms</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this episode so far,</p>
<p>do try and remember MSH, okay?</p>
<p>Mouse, Sam, hamster, MSH, okay?</p>
<p>MSH reduces appetite.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a powerful molecule, all right?</p>
<p>So just put that on the shelf, MSH reduces appetite.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another population of neurons</p>
<p>in the arcuate nucleus called the AGRP neurons.</p>
<p>And there, I&rsquo;m truly not going to read you</p>
<p>what that stands for because it&rsquo;s related</p>
<p>to the mouse strain it was first identified in,</p>
<p>but humans have these cells as well, but AGRP neurons.</p>
<p>The AGRP neurons stimulate eating.</p>
<p>And anytime you are approaching food</p>
<p>or you feel some excitement about food or anxiety,</p>
<p>because some people actually experience</p>
<p>a kind of heightened anxiety,</p>
<p>some people actually get a little bit</p>
<p>of a resting tremor before they eat,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t have any sort of eating disorder,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of a ramping up of autonomic activity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s largely due to the activity of these AGRP neurons.</p>
<p>So the activity in these AGRP neurons goes way up</p>
<p>when animals or people are starved.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean starved for long periods of time,</p>
<p>but I mean, when they haven&rsquo;t eaten for a while.</p>
<p>And the activity of MSH, the release of MSH goes up</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve eaten.</p>
<p>However, there are other things that will stimulate</p>
<p>the release of things like MSH.</p>
<p>So just briefly, the experimental evidence.</p>
<p>If you kill AGRP neurons, animals and people stop eating.</p>
<p>There are people that have lesions, they just stop eating.</p>
<p>They become anorexic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually, I know you&rsquo;re familiar with anorexia</p>
<p>as a clinical term, but that&rsquo;s actually a term</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s used in the scientific literature</p>
<p>about a pattern of behavior, okay?</p>
<p>As well as a clinical term, of course.</p>
<p>If you were to stimulate the AGRP neurons,</p>
<p>animals or people eat like crazy.</p>
<p>They will eat to the point where they burst,</p>
<p>which just sounds horrible, but it just tells you</p>
<p>this is the accelerator on eating.</p>
<p>And yes, as relationship to the ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to go back there just yet.</p>
<p>We will circle back.</p>
<p>So melanocyte stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>such an interesting hormone.</p>
<p>This thing can shut down the desire to eat.</p>
<p>The melanocyte stimulating hormone</p>
<p>is released from the medial pituitary.</p>
<p>We talked about the pituitary last time.</p>
<p>This is a gland that is very closely positioned</p>
<p>to the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Actually, some of the hypothalamus neurons</p>
<p>actually project their neural connections</p>
<p>directly into the pituitary to release things</p>
<p>like gonadotropins and luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>Stuff we talked about last time</p>
<p>in reference to testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>But MSH is released from the medial portion</p>
<p>of the pituitary,</p>
<p>and it stimulates the desire to not eat, to cease eating.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>is that melanocyte stimulating hormone</p>
<p>is activated by ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not activated by ultraviolet light to the skin</p>
<p>or directly to the pituitary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s activated by ultraviolet light to the eyes.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve been watching this podcast</p>
<p>for any period of time,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve heard me on other podcasts,</p>
<p>or you follow my Instagram,</p>
<p>I am a big fan of this whole thing</p>
<p>of getting morning light</p>
<p>in order to synchronize circadian rhythms, et cetera,</p>
<p>avoiding light in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>This is yet another reason why getting ample light,</p>
<p>ideally sunlight,</p>
<p>but it could be other sources of UV light to the eyes,</p>
<p>stimulates MSH.</p>
<p>This has been shown over and over again,</p>
<p>and keeps the desire to eat or appetite in check</p>
<p>in healthy ranges.</p>
<p>This is also why in the spring and summer months,</p>
<p>animals and people eat less.</p>
<p>Now for hibernating animals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different because the bear hibernating,</p>
<p>actually bears don&rsquo;t truly hibernate technically</p>
<p>by scientific criteria, they don&rsquo;t hibernate,</p>
<p>but they go into a kind of torpor.</p>
<p>The hibernating animals,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t eat much because they&rsquo;re in burrows or dens,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just wrapped up in a little ball</p>
<p>or whatever it is that hibernating animals do.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re of course going to eat far less in the winter,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a unique scenario.</p>
<p>We are not hibernating animals,</p>
<p>but humans generally have greater appetite</p>
<p>in the cold winter months.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just because of the holidays</p>
<p>and the abundance of food</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re presenting ourselves with.</p>
<p>But when we get a lot of sun,</p>
<p>our appetite is reduced,</p>
<p>or at least it&rsquo;s easier to control.</p>
<p>And that is due in part,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re getting ample sunlight to the eyes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s converted into a signal for the MSH neurons,</p>
<p>the neurons that release MSH, excuse me,</p>
<p>these POMC neurons release MSH.</p>
<p>And then MSH can bind its receptors</p>
<p>and can keep the break on appetite in check.</p>
<p>So the takeaway tool from this</p>
<p>is make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough light,</p>
<p>not just in the morning, but throughout the day.</p>
<p>And yes, it has to be light to your eyes.</p>
<p>And blasting your eyes with sunlight or artificial light</p>
<p>to the point where it&rsquo;s damaging or painful</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t accelerate or improve this process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about getting photons,</p>
<p>ultraviolet light to the eyes</p>
<p>consistently throughout the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s best accomplished by not wearing sunglasses</p>
<p>provided you can do that safely.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have access to enough sunlight,</p>
<p>then you can do this with artificial light.</p>
<p>This also points again to our old friends, the blue blockers.</p>
<p>Many people know I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of blue blockers,</p>
<p>especially not during the daytime</p>
<p>because they block a lot of the UV</p>
<p>and shorter wavelength light that you want</p>
<p>and need to create alertness,</p>
<p>but also to create release of MSH</p>
<p>from the medial pituitary.</p>
<p>Now, there are people out there, subcultures,</p>
<p>that actually inject MSH,</p>
<p>that are taking MSH or things similar to it.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting people do that,</p>
<p>but there are three main consequences of doing that.</p>
<p>First of all, it reduces appetite.</p>
<p>No surprise there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually using it as a dieting drug.</p>
<p>This is kind of in the underground.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the legal status is.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not promoting that people do it.</p>
<p>Two, it makes them very, very tan,</p>
<p>which makes sense, right?</p>
<p>Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>And the third is it purportedly, never tried it,</p>
<p>purportedly sends libido through the roof</p>
<p>to the point where it&rsquo;s actually distracting</p>
<p>for other activities.</p>
<p>It actually can create pre-epism,</p>
<p>which is a kind of chronic erection in males</p>
<p>to the point where it actually can be physically damaging</p>
<p>to the genitalia.</p>
<p>So this is a drug of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether or not to call it a drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a substance that one can regulate with healthy levels</p>
<p>with sunlight and perhaps artificial UV light.</p>
<p>I have not heard much about treatments for obesity</p>
<p>involving getting ample sunlight or getting ample UV light.</p>
<p>But to me, the logic is just very clear.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re pursuing those avenues,</p>
<p>you might want to,</p>
<p>you certainly should talk to your physician,</p>
<p>but you might want to think about</p>
<p>how some of those logic hangs together.</p>
<p>Absolutely fascinating hormone.</p>
<p>I think most people aren&rsquo;t aware of it.</p>
<p>And the subcultures that are aware of it</p>
<p>are using it to very particular end points</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re using it at supraphysiological levels.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough about that because I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a few people in research,</p>
<p>believe it or not, for this podcast.</p>
<p>I reached out to a few people and asked whether or not</p>
<p>these side effects, in air quotes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about are true and indeed they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>But again, that&rsquo;s supraphysiological, controlling MSH.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually alpha MSH levels</p>
<p>through viewing ultraviolet light</p>
<p>seems like an interesting</p>
<p>and mechanistically logical thing to do</p>
<p>if your goal is to keep appetite in check.</p>
<p>So MSH inhibits hunger.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about a hormone peptide</p>
<p>that activates hunger.</p>
<p>And this is a really interesting one</p>
<p>because it relates to when you get hungry</p>
<p>in addition to the fact that you get hungry at all.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s called ghrelin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.</p>
<p>Ghrelin is released actually from the GI tract.</p>
<p>And its main role is to increase your desire to eat.</p>
<p>And it does that through a variety of mechanisms.</p>
<p>Part of that is to stimulate some of the brain areas,</p>
<p>the actual neurons that make you want to eat.</p>
<p>In addition, it creates food anticipatory signals</p>
<p>within your nervous system.</p>
<p>So you start thinking about the things</p>
<p>that you happen to like to eat</p>
<p>at that particular time of day.</p>
<p>This is fascinating.</p>
<p>Ghrelin is sort of like a clock,</p>
<p>a hormonal clock that makes you want to eat</p>
<p>at particular times.</p>
<p>Now, the signal for ghrelin</p>
<p>is reduced glucose levels in the blood.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a lot today about glucose and insulin,</p>
<p>ways to manage glucose and insulin.</p>
<p>But for now, the simple version of this</p>
<p>is you normally want your glucose</p>
<p>to be in a kind of modest range.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain what that range is in a little bit.</p>
<p>But if it drops too low,</p>
<p>ghrelin is secreted from your gut.</p>
<p>It activates neurons in your brain at various locations,</p>
<p>including the PMOC neurons</p>
<p>and the other neurons of the arcuate.</p>
<p>It also activates the VMH in particular ways.</p>
<p>And it might even activate some of these neurons</p>
<p>that are in the periphery in your mouth</p>
<p>that actually make you kind of salivate</p>
<p>and want to eat, right?</p>
<p>We all know about the famous Pavlovian experiments</p>
<p>of Pavlov&rsquo;s dogs.</p>
<p>You know, they start salivating to the bell</p>
<p>after the bell was presented with food.</p>
<p>You remove the food</p>
<p>and then just the bell can stimulate the salivation.</p>
<p>We become Pavlovian at times.</p>
<p>But rarely is it ever discussed</p>
<p>what the neural pathways for that are.</p>
<p>And it turns out that these hormones</p>
<p>that are secreted from the gut</p>
<p>can stimulate the neurons to create a sensation</p>
<p>and a desire for certain foods at certain times of day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done this experiment.</p>
<p>If you are somebody who eats breakfast</p>
<p>at more or less the same time each day,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 8 a.m., plus or minus 20 minutes,</p>
<p>and then you eat lunch, 12.30, plus or minus 20 minutes,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re somebody like me</p>
<p>who typically skips breakfast and just eats lunch,</p>
<p>usually around 11.30 or 12 or something like that,</p>
<p>your ghrelin secretion will start to match</p>
<p>when you typically eat.</p>
<p>And it does that, and it&rsquo;s able to override</p>
<p>the low levels of glucose in your bloodstream</p>
<p>because the ghrelin system also gets input</p>
<p>from a clock in your liver</p>
<p>that is linked to the clock in your hypothalamus</p>
<p>in your brain.</p>
<p>And what this means is if you eat at regular mealtimes,</p>
<p>you will start to get hungry a few minutes</p>
<p>before those mealtimes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered why your stomach</p>
<p>kind of starts to growl</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a particular time of day,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh, I must want to eat,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s ghrelin.</p>
<p>And for those of you that don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why your stomach growls, I&rsquo;ll also tell you that today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not at all what you expect,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just the gurgling of liquids in your stomach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a muscular phenomenon.</p>
<p>So ghrelin is secreted as a kind of food anticipatory signal</p>
<p>to get you motivated to go eat at regular times.</p>
<p>So nowadays there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of interest</p>
<p>in just what meal plans and schedules and what to eat</p>
<p>in general in order to maximize one&rsquo;s health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>And people have all sorts of cosmetic reasons</p>
<p>and brain reasons and metabolic reasons</p>
<p>for wanting to control this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make it really simple</p>
<p>by first looking at the extremes.</p>
<p>Some people need to eat every two or three hours.</p>
<p>They forget this.</p>
<p>I need to eat every two or three hours</p>
<p>or else their blood sugar drops.</p>
<p>In general, blood sugar doesn&rsquo;t drop so low</p>
<p>that they truly need to eat</p>
<p>in order to alleviate a blood sugar issue.</p>
<p>Although sometimes that can happen.</p>
<p>Some people are truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar.</p>
<p>But most people, as the blood sugar starts to head down</p>
<p>towards the low-ish ranges, ghrelin is secreted.</p>
<p>And so for those people,</p>
<p>not eating on the clock is very disruptive to them</p>
<p>because it activates these neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>For people who eat once a day or twice a day</p>
<p>or tend to shift their meals,</p>
<p>you know, they might eat a lot,</p>
<p>but during a limited so-called feeding window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting,</p>
<p>humans now eat and talk about foods</p>
<p>in ways that for years I used to hear about</p>
<p>in classes and courses and research lectures</p>
<p>about feeding animals, you know, restricted feeding windows.</p>
<p>And we owe a great deal of gratitude to Sachin Panda,</p>
<p>who was a colleague of mine when my lab was in San Diego</p>
<p>at the Salk Institute,</p>
<p>who really is one of the pioneers</p>
<p>of this restricted feeding window work</p>
<p>and has done a beautiful work.</p>
<p>He has a book that&rsquo;s excellent called</p>
<p>The Circadian Code that I highly recommend.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s done a lot of important work</p>
<p>on neurons in the retina that control circadian timing,</p>
<p>but also the relationship between feeding windows and health.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s sort of the major proponent out there,</p>
<p>among the major proponents, I should say,</p>
<p>of circadian eating.</p>
<p>That means eating during the daytime, not at night,</p>
<p>or intermittent fasting, restricting feeding windows</p>
<p>to anywhere from four to six to eight hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use myself as an example</p>
<p>of the transition from regular feeding schedule</p>
<p>to a more intermittent-ish fasting,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t really fall into true intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>So I was one of these people that just got so accustomed</p>
<p>to waking up and eating about an hour after I woke up</p>
<p>that to go from eating every three or four hours</p>
<p>to eating twice a day, lunch and dinner,</p>
<p>maybe a couple of snacks in the afternoon or something,</p>
<p>at first was excruciating.</p>
<p>I remember thinking like,</p>
<p>this is really brutal, pushing out feeding.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I could exercise unless I had eaten first.</p>
<p>We now know that during most all forms of exercise,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re really focused on optimal performance,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve got to hit key lifts</p>
<p>or you have to sprint at your maximum speed,</p>
<p>and maybe even then,</p>
<p>that you can exercise fasted just fine</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re mainly relying on sources</p>
<p>like glycogen from the liver,</p>
<p>some undigested food sometimes,</p>
<p>as gross as that might seem, it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>as well as body fat if the exercise bout is extremely long.</p>
<p>But what that means is that if you suddenly go</p>
<p>from eating on a very regular schedule to skipping a meal</p>
<p>or pushing your meal timing out or shifting at all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have ghrelin in your system.</p>
<p>And that ghrelin is going to stimulate the desire to eat</p>
<p>by acting at the level of your brain.</p>
<p>And it is indeed at that point, just mental.</p>
<p>When we hear about just mental, just physical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really kind of the same thing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all chemicals, brain and body,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the stimulation of neurons that anticipate feeding.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stimulating the arcuate nucleus neurons</p>
<p>that make you want to eat those AGRP neurons.</p>
<p>So ghrelin stimulates the AGRP neurons,</p>
<p>which makes you want to eat.</p>
<p>So what can you do with this?</p>
<p>What this means is if you want to start shifting</p>
<p>your feeding schedule to one</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not eating quite as frequently,</p>
<p>and there are some advantages to that</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t just in the biochemistry and health related,</p>
<p>cellar health related things,</p>
<p>but some of them include not having to think about</p>
<p>or buy food, right?</p>
<p>You actually don&rsquo;t have to think about food all day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not eating so often.</p>
<p>The other is it gives you</p>
<p>a far more social flexibility, right?</p>
<p>You can go to a noon meeting if you have to,</p>
<p>or you can go out to dinner at a particular time.</p>
<p>And I guess it makes it kind of tough</p>
<p>if you want to meet somebody for breakfast</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re the dork</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just like sipping black coffee</p>
<p>and like refusing everything.</p>
<p>But anyway, I&rsquo;ve been that dork.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of those things you just kind of work with.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is ghrelin secretion,</p>
<p>because of its relationship to the nervous system</p>
<p>can be shifted by about 45 minutes per day.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s going to vary.</p>
<p>Some of you have more so-called willpower, you know,</p>
<p>but if you really want to just start pushing</p>
<p>that first meal out or shifting it in any direction,</p>
<p>some people might want to eat</p>
<p>in the early part of the day and not in the evening,</p>
<p>trying to shift the meal times out,</p>
<p>the spacing by about 45 minutes</p>
<p>is what the neural circuits that link the ghrelin system</p>
<p>to the neural circuits that control feeding</p>
<p>really can handle because it&rsquo;s a form of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And so what this would look like is</p>
<p>if you normally you eat breakfast at eight o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>plus or minus 20 minutes,</p>
<p>and you want to start eating your first meal at noon,</p>
<p>you would take maybe four or five days</p>
<p>and just start pushing the meal out</p>
<p>by about 45 minutes to an hour each day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not quite as painful.</p>
<p>Or you can just take the plunge and just do it all at once.</p>
<p>I have a colleague who was a neurosurgeon at Stanford,</p>
<p>came up through my lab.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now at Neuralink and he has a great practice.</p>
<p>He keeps his ghrelin system at random.</p>
<p>What he does is he skips one meal per day</p>
<p>and he makes his external schedule dictate that.</p>
<p>So sometimes he skips breakfast.</p>
<p>Sometimes he skips lunch.</p>
<p>Sometimes he skips dinner.</p>
<p>He just skips one of the three major meals per day.</p>
<p>And in doing that,</p>
<p>the ghrelin system is always kind of kept off kilter.</p>
<p>And it probably also allows him</p>
<p>to have a lot of neural flexibility,</p>
<p>what we call top-down control.</p>
<p>Just the knowledge,</p>
<p>oh, the hunger I&rsquo;m feeling isn&rsquo;t necessarily hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>And in his case, it&rsquo;s almost certainly not.</p>
<p>And therefore what I&rsquo;m feeling here</p>
<p>is an activation of these AGRP neurons.</p>
<p>And therefore I can push my meal schedule</p>
<p>around however I want.</p>
<p>Now I should mention that top-down mechanisms are powerful.</p>
<p>Belief, motivation.</p>
<p>These things can really shift neural circuits.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk more about that a little bit later.</p>
<p>But there are also people who are genuinely hypoglycemic</p>
<p>and that need to take really good control</p>
<p>of their blood sugar levels and try and keep them stable.</p>
<p>And so of course you want to do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s medically safe for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at all recommending that people</p>
<p>that suffer from hypoglycemia</p>
<p>suddenly disrupt their blood sugar patterns</p>
<p>in any direction.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be healthy.</p>
<p>But for most people out there</p>
<p>who have reasonable blood glucose levels,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of interesting and kind of fun</p>
<p>to play with these parameters</p>
<p>in order to optimize what you want to do.</p>
<p>And sometimes that might change across the year</p>
<p>with schedules.</p>
<p>Many people find great benefit</p>
<p>in having flexibility over when they eat.</p>
<p>Regularity of eating equals regularity of ghrelin secretion</p>
<p>equals regularity of activity of these AGRP neurons,</p>
<p>meaning you will be hungry at very regular intervals.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that you can work with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s grounded in deep mechanism</p>
<p>of hormone and neural systems.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of modern research</p>
<p>to support what I just said.</p>
<p>So if MSH inhibits feeding,</p>
<p>makes us want to eat less,</p>
<p>and ghrelin makes us want to eat more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another hormone called CCK, cholecystokinin,</p>
<p>that is potent in reducing our levels of hunger.</p>
<p>Now, I learned about CCK back when I was an undergraduate,</p>
<p>so well over 20 years ago,</p>
<p>when it was first discovered.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of excitement about CCK at that point</p>
<p>as a diet drug.</p>
<p>You know, anytime there&rsquo;s a molecule</p>
<p>or a chemical discovered in the brain or body</p>
<p>that can suppress feeding,</p>
<p>the diet industry just goes wild.</p>
<p>And I think, okay, this is going to be the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to allow people to move from being obese</p>
<p>to losing all sorts of unhealthy weight, et cetera.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon was observed with leptin.</p>
<p>Leptin is a hormone that&rsquo;s made by body fat</p>
<p>that signals to the brain when there&rsquo;s a lot of body fat.</p>
<p>And in animals, injections of leptin</p>
<p>can make fat animals thin.</p>
<p>They lose a lot of adipose or fat.</p>
<p>In humans, it didn&rsquo;t work out that way.</p>
<p>It just, the studies were done</p>
<p>and leptin was successful</p>
<p>in treating a certain rare form of diabetes,</p>
<p>but it really wasn&rsquo;t very potent as an anti-obesity drug.</p>
<p>Similarly, CCK has been looked at as an obesity drug,</p>
<p>something to reduce obesity,</p>
<p>but it had some pretty unhappy side effects,</p>
<p>actually caused some pretty serious side effects.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s as a drug.</p>
<p>However, CCK, when released at normal levels by your gut,</p>
<p>has a powerful effect in suppressing appetite</p>
<p>for a period of time.</p>
<p>And there are healthy and direct ways to activate CCK.</p>
<p>Now, CCK is in the GI tract.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released from the GI tract.</p>
<p>And its release is governed by two things.</p>
<p>One is a subset of very specialized neurons</p>
<p>that detect what&rsquo;s in the gut,</p>
<p>the specific contents of the gut.</p>
<p>And by certain elements of the mucosa,</p>
<p>the mucus lining of the gut and the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s really interesting is that CCK</p>
<p>is stimulated by fatty acids</p>
<p>and particular fatty acids that we&rsquo;ll talk about,</p>
<p>amino acids and particular amino acids</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about, as well as by sugar.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s put sugar on the shelf for a moment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about sugar</p>
<p>because if CCK inhibits appetite and reduces feeding,</p>
<p>and it can be triggered by fatty acids,</p>
<p>amino acids, or sugars, then you might say,</p>
<p>well, then eating a lot of sugar</p>
<p>should make us not want to eat more.</p>
<p>But we all know that eating sugar</p>
<p>makes us want to eat far more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the role of a lot of sugars.</p>
<p>And that has to do with a separate mechanism</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about today.</p>
<p>So which fatty acids in the gut</p>
<p>stimulate the release of CCK?</p>
<p>It turns out it&rsquo;s the omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>the ones that come from algae or krill or fish oil.</p>
<p>I talked about this in the episode on nutrition</p>
<p>and some of the things related to the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to revisit that now.</p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid, CLA,</p>
<p>either from food or from supplements,</p>
<p>stimulate the release of CCK,</p>
<p>which then reduces or at least blunts appetite.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about blunting appetite</p>
<p>to anorexic levels where you don&rsquo;t want to eat at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about regulating appetite</p>
<p>to the point where animals and people don&rsquo;t over-consume.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s keeping appetite at a healthy level.</p>
<p>The other thing that stimulates CCK</p>
<p>that I mentioned are amino acids.</p>
<p>So when we eat, we have the ability</p>
<p>to break down different macronutrients,</p>
<p>you know, carbohydrates, fats, or proteins</p>
<p>into sugars and glucose that then we can convert to ATP</p>
<p>and all that stuff from the Krebs cycle from high school.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to go into that today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for a future episode.</p>
<p>But amino acids are one of the things</p>
<p>that we are eating for.</p>
<p>Amino acids both can be used as energy</p>
<p>through a process called gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>of converting proteins into energy,</p>
<p>or those amino acids can be broken down</p>
<p>and then rebuilt into things like preparing,</p>
<p>excuse me, repairing muscle tissue,</p>
<p>as well as other forms of cellular repair.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re involved in all sorts of things</p>
<p>related to protein synthesis.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>If we eat the proper amino acids at the proper levels,</p>
<p>if we ingest omega-3s and CLAs,</p>
<p>conjugated linoleic acids, at the proper levels,</p>
<p>or get them from supplements,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a blunting of appetite.</p>
<p>Appetite is kept clamped and we don&rsquo;t become hyperphagic.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t overeat.</p>
<p>We tend to eat within healthy or normal ranges.</p>
<p>So this is very important</p>
<p>because most people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that when we&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>we are basically fat foraging and amino acid foraging.</p>
<p>And there are several studies now have shown</p>
<p>that people and animals will essentially eat</p>
<p>until they feel they&rsquo;ve consumed enough omega-3s,</p>
<p>omega-6s, CLAs, and certain amino acids.</p>
<p>In other words, even if it&rsquo;s not conscious,</p>
<p>we are eating until we trigger the activation of CCK.</p>
<p>Now, there are other reasons why we shut down eating too.</p>
<p>Literally, the volume of food in our gut can be large</p>
<p>and we can feel very distended.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the physical reason, obviously.</p>
<p>There are other reasons.</p>
<p>Maybe we just have top-down control.</p>
<p>We have knowledge that this is the end of the meal</p>
<p>and we stop because we have to go back to work</p>
<p>or to a meeting or we tell ourselves we&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>
<p>But at a subconscious level,</p>
<p>the gut is informing the brain via CCK and other mechanisms</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve ingested enough of what we need.</p>
<p>And these omega-3s and CLAs and certain amino acids</p>
<p>are vital for sending out that signal</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>
<p>Now, which amino acids is actually really interesting.</p>
<p>We have essential amino acids</p>
<p>and we have non-essential amino acids.</p>
<p>Among the essential amino acids,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one in particular that can trigger the release</p>
<p>of CCK very potently, and that&rsquo;s glutamine.</p>
<p>Glutamine is a very interesting amino acid.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s been shown in a few studies</p>
<p>to play a role in bolstering the immune system.</p>
<p>It can increase the number of killer cells</p>
<p>in the immune system.</p>
<p>It is consumed in supplement form.</p>
<p>People can take it, a teaspoon of glutamine</p>
<p>or some people take glutamine throughout the day</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re really into it or for whatever reason</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re battling off an infection</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Glutamine can also, of course, be derived from foods.</p>
<p>And you can just put into the internet,</p>
<p>do an internet search</p>
<p>and find out what foods are rich with glutamine.</p>
<p>Some of the ones that I&rsquo;m aware of off the top of my head</p>
<p>are like cottage cheese and things of that sort,</p>
<p>but other foods have glutamine as well.</p>
<p>Once a threshold level of glutamine</p>
<p>and other essential amino acids are reached,</p>
<p>once the threshold level of these alpha-3, excuse me,</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids and CLAs are reached,</p>
<p>CCK is released and it helps reduce the activity</p>
<p>of those AGRP neurons that promote feeding.</p>
<p>So as you can see, feeding is an interplay</p>
<p>between brain and body,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s some of the micronutrients</p>
<p>and even the breakdown of particular nutrients</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s putting the accelerator</p>
<p>or the brake on the feeding process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one thing.</p>
<p>So from an actionable standpoint,</p>
<p>you, we should probably all be trying to get</p>
<p>our omega-3, omega-6 ratios correct anyway</p>
<p>because they are antidepressant.</p>
<p>I talked about the peer-reviewed studies on that.</p>
<p>They are healthy for the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and we should be seeking sufficient glutamine.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not you decide to supplement</p>
<p>with glutamine or not is up to you.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why one might want to do that,</p>
<p>and again, you should always check with a doctor,</p>
<p>especially if you have any predisposition to cancers</p>
<p>or you have cancer, many cancers and tumors like glutamine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something to note.</p>
<p>But one reason why you might want to supplement</p>
<p>with glutamine or consider eating foods</p>
<p>that are rich in glutamine</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just to keep your appetite in healthy ranges,</p>
<p>but as well, glutamine can actually reduce sugar cravings.</p>
<p>So this is very interesting.</p>
<p>I have a friend, he&rsquo;s an absolute chocolate sweets addict.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a grown adult, but he eats candy and chocolate</p>
<p>as if it was, you know, as if he was like a 14-year-old kid</p>
<p>hanging out at the local convenience store.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really incredible.</p>
<p>And he has probably a sugar addiction,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s very aware of this</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s managed to kick all other addictions.</p>
<p>So for whatever reason, it stimulates his brain and body</p>
<p>in the ways that make him want more, but he hates this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite frustrating for him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s somebody who cares a lot about his health.</p>
<p>He took the approach that I know many other people have</p>
<p>who know about this role of glutamine</p>
<p>of taking a teaspoon or a couple of teaspoons of glutamine</p>
<p>several times throughout the day</p>
<p>or anytime he craves sugar.</p>
<p>And indeed, glutamine will reduce sugar cravings.</p>
<p>Some people who are really on the kind of ketogenic front</p>
<p>will mix it with a little bit of half and half and down that</p>
<p>and because I guess it makes it taste better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit chalky.</p>
<p>So glutamine has some very interesting properties.</p>
<p>But I think for most people that aren&rsquo;t suffering</p>
<p>from adverse levels of craving,</p>
<p>making sure you&rsquo;re getting the right omega-3s</p>
<p>that can come from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>Check out the episode we did on nutrition</p>
<p>if you want to learn more about that and CLAs</p>
<p>and making sure that you&rsquo;re getting enough glutamine</p>
<p>is going to be important for making sure</p>
<p>that the CCK signal gets through.</p>
<p>The one thing I do want to mention about glutamine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a minor effect, but it alone can have a small increase.</p>
<p>Excuse me, it alone can increase blood sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge increase in blood glucose,</p>
<p>but because the gut takes proteins</p>
<p>and breaks them down into these amino acids</p>
<p>and essentially looking for glutamine and things like it,</p>
<p>other essential amino acids as well.</p>
<p>When you ingest glutamine or branch chain amino acids,</p>
<p>there is a small but real increase in blood glucose.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because they are essentially food.</p>
<p>And there I&rsquo;m talking about the supplemental version.</p>
<p>So just know glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly,</p>
<p>especially diabetics should know that.</p>
<p>It can reduce sugar cravings.</p>
<p>And just know that what your gut is doing at a core level</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s foraging, it&rsquo;s waiting,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s trying to assess levels of omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>conjugated linoleic acid,</p>
<p>and glutamine and other essential amino acids.</p>
<p>You are essentially trying to eat to get these nutrients.</p>
<p>And then a signal can be deployed up to your brain</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not really interested in eating that much more.</p>
<p>Whenever preparing an episode for this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always faced with a particular challenge,</p>
<p>which is how many tools should I offer</p>
<p>that involve doing something new?</p>
<p>You know, a new behavior or a new exercise,</p>
<p>supplement, something, things of that sort.</p>
<p>And how many should be related to not doing things,</p>
<p>avoiding things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never really fun to talk about all the things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re supposed to avoid,</p>
<p>but some of them are so powerful</p>
<p>in light of the mechanisms of a given topic</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention them.</p>
<p>So now you understand how hormones and peptides</p>
<p>like CCK and ghrelin impact appetite.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one particular aspect of food</p>
<p>that can powerfully impact CCK.</p>
<p>And I think most people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing 99.9% of people out there</p>
<p>are not aware of this.</p>
<p>And it has to do with highly processed foods.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons why one would want</p>
<p>to avoid highly processed foods.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&rsquo;re interested in that topic</p>
<p>and the history of whole foods</p>
<p>transitioning to highly processed foods in this country,</p>
<p>I highly recommend you listen to a YouTube video</p>
<p>by Dr. Robert Lustig.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at University of California, San Francisco.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to find.</p>
<p>Put Stanford, Robert Lustig.</p>
<p>It was a talk hosted by Stanford.</p>
<p>Gives a beautiful description of the history of this</p>
<p>and why the food industry started packing in</p>
<p>additional sugars and salts</p>
<p>and turning foods into commodities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>It has no conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just all scientific facts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a wonderful lecture.</p>
<p>Has millions of views.</p>
<p>Should be very easy to find.</p>
<p>We can provide a link to that and we will.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another reason to avoid</p>
<p>highly processed foods, however.</p>
<p>And that has to do with what&rsquo;s called emulsifiers.</p>
<p>Now, many of you are familiar with emulsifiers</p>
<p>even though you don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>When you put detergent in the laundry,</p>
<p>that contains emulsifiers.</p>
<p>The goal of that detergent is to bring together</p>
<p>fatty molecules with water molecules</p>
<p>and be able to dissociate them and break them up</p>
<p>to get the stains out of clothes and things of that sort.</p>
<p>There are a lot of emulsifiers put into processed foods.</p>
<p>And those emulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions</p>
<p>to occur that extends the shelf life of those foods.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like candy bars and cereals</p>
<p>and all sorts of things that are in processed foods.</p>
<p>The worst of which are the typical kind of pastries</p>
<p>that you see at the convenience store.</p>
<p>But this extends into chips of various kinds</p>
<p>and even some meats of various kinds.</p>
<p>They pack this stuff into meats.</p>
<p>They have names like soy lecithin and other things.</p>
<p>Why are emulsifiers bad?</p>
<p>Okay, there are a lot of reasons why they&rsquo;re bad.</p>
<p>But the reason why they&rsquo;re bad for the mechanisms</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about today</p>
<p>is that when you ingest those foods,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bringing those emulsifiers into your gut.</p>
<p>And those emulsifiers strip away</p>
<p>the mucosal lining of the gut.</p>
<p>And they actually cause the neurons that innervate the gut</p>
<p>that extend those little processes</p>
<p>we call axons into the gut to retract deeper into the gut.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, you&rsquo;re ingesting a bunch of food</p>
<p>and the signals like CCK never get deployed.</p>
<p>The signals that actually shut down hunger</p>
<p>are never actually triggered.</p>
<p>And so as a consequence, you want to eat far more</p>
<p>of these highly processed foods.</p>
<p>In addition, if you then go from eating</p>
<p>a highly processed food to non-highly processed foods,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not able to measure the amounts of amino acids,</p>
<p>sugars, and fatty acids in those foods as accurately.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve actually done structural damage at a micro level,</p>
<p>but structural level damage, excuse me,</p>
<p>to the mucosal lining of the gut.</p>
<p>Now this can all be repaired if you stay away</p>
<p>from highly processed foods for some period of time.</p>
<p>But the negative effects of these emulsifiers</p>
<p>are quite real.</p>
<p>So to make it really clean and simple,</p>
<p>emulsifiers from highly processed foods</p>
<p>are limiting your gut&rsquo;s ability to detect</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in the foods you eat</p>
<p>and therefore to deploy the satiety signals,</p>
<p>the signals that shut down hunger.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there&rsquo;s a parallel mechanism at play</p>
<p>that I talked about in a previous episode,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll remind you again that you have neurons in your gut</p>
<p>that are sensing sugar</p>
<p>and are sending a subconscious signal up to the brain</p>
<p>via the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>And those neurons trigger the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>which makes you crave more of that food.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got parallel signals</p>
<p>making you want to eat more sugar,</p>
<p>making you unaware of how much sugar you&rsquo;ve eaten</p>
<p>and that are disrupting the inputs to the nervous system</p>
<p>that signal to the rest of your brain and body</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve obtained enough fatty acids</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve obtained enough amino acids.</p>
<p>So these highly processed foods are really terrible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not out here to say,</p>
<p>never enjoy a processed food of any kind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be a hypocrite</p>
<p>because I do eat processed foods from time to time,</p>
<p>although the ones that I tend to eat,</p>
<p>I try and make of the healthier variety.</p>
<p>But eating whole foods has tremendous value</p>
<p>and eating highly processed food</p>
<p>has tremendous negative impact on the gut</p>
<p>and on the gut brain axis.</p>
<p>And so recently there was a paper that came out in Cell,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the apex of cell journals,</p>
<p>which is phenomenal.</p>
<p>This paper showed that ingesting highly processed food</p>
<p>leads to more intake of not just highly processed foods,</p>
<p>but other types of food in general.</p>
<p>There was kind of an overeating compensation</p>
<p>generally across foods</p>
<p>for people that consume these highly processed foods.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of other reasons</p>
<p>to avoid highly processed foods.</p>
<p>So again, I don&rsquo;t like to focus too much on the do nots.</p>
<p>I like to arm you with tools to do,</p>
<p>but I think this visual of certain foods</p>
<p>and these emulsifiers actually stripping away</p>
<p>some of the critical lining of your gut</p>
<p>and disrupting the hormone signaling</p>
<p>to the brain controlling feeding</p>
<p>is important enough and cryptic enough,</p>
<p>meaning it hasn&rsquo;t been talked about.</p>
<p>It works at a subconscious level</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s important that people are aware of it</p>
<p>so they can make decisions</p>
<p>about what they do want to eat</p>
<p>or not want to eat for themselves.</p>
<p>Before moving on, I just want to say one more thing</p>
<p>about highly processed foods.</p>
<p>There was an absolutely beautiful study</p>
<p>done by my colleague, Chris Garner at Stanford,</p>
<p>exploring whether or not certain diets</p>
<p>were better than others.</p>
<p>They looked at vegan, vegetarian, omnivore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they looked at all meat or not,</p>
<p>but they looked at the different forms of diets,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they essentially found that whichever diet</p>
<p>people adhered to, whichever one they followed,</p>
<p>was equivalent to the others,</p>
<p>provided that they followed it,</p>
<p>they lost the equivalent amount of weight.</p>
<p>There really wasn&rsquo;t a strong effect of the food type</p>
<p>or the pattern of eating, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, in a study like that, adherence is very high</p>
<p>because people are part of a study.</p>
<p>And for many people, the ability to adhere</p>
<p>to a certain eating plan is one of the most,</p>
<p>if not the most powerful determinants</p>
<p>of whether or not a given diet,</p>
<p>meaning nutritional plan, works.</p>
<p>Now, this thing about highly processed foods, however,</p>
<p>is really diabolical because it truly says,</p>
<p>and I think the recent data in Cell Metabolism</p>
<p>and other journals really proves</p>
<p>that a calorie is not a calorie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely absurd because of these emulsifiers</p>
<p>and the content of these highly processed foods.</p>
<p>In fact, the data in humans points to this.</p>
<p>So what they did is they took inpatient adults,</p>
<p>so they had total control over their food intake,</p>
<p>and they received either ultra-processed</p>
<p>or unprocessed diets for 14 days as a short study.</p>
<p>The diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber,</p>
<p>and macronutrients.</p>
<p>So everything else was matched.</p>
<p>Just processed or non-processed is the major variable.</p>
<p>And basically what they found is that the people</p>
<p>who were eating the processed food diet</p>
<p>happened to eat much more, right?</p>
<p>This was after this period of putting them on either diet</p>
<p>and clamping for all other variables.</p>
<p>Then they would eat much more,</p>
<p>and the body weight changes were much more.</p>
<p>And those body weight changes were such</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t be accounted for</p>
<p>by just increased calories.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is that highly processed foods</p>
<p>are just bad for you.</p>
<p>They increase weight gain.</p>
<p>They disrupt the lining of your gut</p>
<p>in a way that disrupts things like CCK</p>
<p>and proper satiety signals.</p>
<p>And they contain a bunch of things, in particular sugars,</p>
<p>but other things as well,</p>
<p>that disrupt not just the hormonal systems,</p>
<p>but also the neural systems that control the desire to eat</p>
<p>after the diet is done.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just so many reasons</p>
<p>why these highly processed foods are terrible.</p>
<p>And they can explain a lot of the ill health effects</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve seen in the last 50 years,</p>
<p>not just in the United States, but all over the world.</p>
<p>The enormous increase in diabetes, juvenile diabetes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just remarkable how far down the path of bad we&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clear it&rsquo;s almost a smoking gun</p>
<p>what the cause of this is.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about that,</p>
<p>please refer to the Lustig lecture.</p>
<p>He also spells out why non-processed foods</p>
<p>is far more economical in terms of just at the level</p>
<p>of the household or individual,</p>
<p>as well as at the societal level.</p>
<p>Really interesting stuff.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you check it out.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s move on to some other hormones</p>
<p>that regulate hunger and satiety.</p>
<p>In particular, insulin.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve probably heard of insulin before.</p>
<p>Insulin is the thing that&rsquo;s lacking in type one diabetics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they have to inject insulin whenever they eat.</p>
<p>The reason they have to do that is because when they eat,</p>
<p>their foods are broken down into glucose.</p>
<p>And in order to shuttle glucose</p>
<p>to the appropriate tissues in the body,</p>
<p>and also to keep glucose levels in check, you need insulin.</p>
<p>So the simplest way to think about insulin and glucose</p>
<p>is that when you eat, that food is broken down into sugars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true whether or not it&rsquo;s fats or it&rsquo;s sugars,</p>
<p>or eventually if it&rsquo;s proteins.</p>
<p>They are oxidized into fuels, as we say.</p>
<p>And those fuels can be used, as the name fuel implies,</p>
<p>into energy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re eventually made into ATP.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of biochemical steps</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not going to go into today,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s essentially how it works.</p>
<p>You break down food into glucose.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re ketogenic,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a little bit,</p>
<p>but in general, you eat, food is turned into glucose.</p>
<p>Your blood sugar needs to be kept in a particular range.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemic means too low.</p>
<p>Hyperglycemic means too high.</p>
<p>And what they called euglycemic, E-U, glycemic,</p>
<p>is the healthy range.</p>
<p>Now, what those healthy ranges are,</p>
<p>in general, the healthy range, the euglycemic range,</p>
<p>is about 70 to 100 nanograms per deciliter.</p>
<p>But most of you aren&rsquo;t walking around</p>
<p>with a glucose monitor.</p>
<p>Some of you are, but most of you are not.</p>
<p>The more important question for us to address right now</p>
<p>is why is it important that glucose</p>
<p>be kept at a particular level?</p>
<p>Once you understand that, keeping glucose in check</p>
<p>starts to have a rationale behind it,</p>
<p>and the ways to do that start to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>So the reason is, if glucose levels get too high</p>
<p>because of the way that our cells, in particular neurons,</p>
<p>interact with glucose,</p>
<p>high levels of glucose can damage neurons.</p>
<p>It can actually kill them.</p>
<p>You can start getting what are called peripheral,</p>
<p>excuse me, neuropathies.</p>
<p>One of the symptoms of some forms of diabetes</p>
<p>is that people start losing the sensation of touch</p>
<p>in their fingers or their hands or their feet,</p>
<p>and they can start going blind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s diabetic retinopathies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important that insulin</p>
<p>manage your glucose levels.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s also type two diabetes</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s insulin secreted from the pancreas,</p>
<p>but people are insulin insensitive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a disruption in the receptors,</p>
<p>and insulin insensitivity isn&rsquo;t quite the same</p>
<p>as having no insulin at all,</p>
<p>but it parallels some of the same mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now, type one diabetes is often picked up</p>
<p>because someone has a sudden weight loss</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not processing blood sugar</p>
<p>the same way they were before.</p>
<p>Type two diabetes is often, although not always,</p>
<p>associated with being overweight and with obesity.</p>
<p>Both of them are challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Type two diabetes almost always can be managed</p>
<p>by managing one&rsquo;s weight.</p>
<p>And of course, there are prescription drugs</p>
<p>and supplements that can help manage those.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about all of that.</p>
<p>But for most people that don&rsquo;t have diabetes,</p>
<p>the important thing is to manage glucose,</p>
<p>to keep it in that euglycemic range.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different ways to do that.</p>
<p>Some of them are behavioral, some of them are diet-based,</p>
<p>and some of them are based on supplements</p>
<p>or prescription drugs.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about those now.</p>
<p>So if you eat, and in particular,</p>
<p>if you eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up.</p>
<p>If you eat fats, blood glucose goes up to a far less degree.</p>
<p>And if you eat proteins, depending on the protein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll eventually be broken down for fuel</p>
<p>or assembled into amino acid chains for protein synthesis</p>
<p>and repair of other tissues and bodily functions.</p>
<p>But glucose goes up and then is kept in range.</p>
<p>When you are hungry, you secrete a different hormone,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called glucagon.</p>
<p>And glucagon&rsquo;s main role is to pull stores of energy</p>
<p>out of the liver and the muscles.</p>
<p>And once those are depleted,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll eventually tap into body fat, okay?</p>
<p>So, and this is for people</p>
<p>that have a typical blood glucose range,</p>
<p>so that 70 to 100 euglycemic range.</p>
<p>So the two kind of push and pull systems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to think about now to keep this simple</p>
<p>is that you have the insulin system managing glucose,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got the glucagon system pulling energy</p>
<p>out of your liver and muscles for immediate fuel.</p>
<p>And eventually you&rsquo;ll pull fuel out of body fat</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been active for a very long time</p>
<p>and all your glycogen stores are depleted</p>
<p>or close to depleted.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of important biochemistry</p>
<p>and a lot of important cellular processes involved</p>
<p>in whether or not you&rsquo;re anabolic or catabolic,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re breaking things down</p>
<p>or building things up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about feeding in a simpler way, however.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s weave the tools to manage blood glucose</p>
<p>to keep it in check as we do that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you had a meal,</p>
<p>and that meal consisted of rice, a carbohydrate,</p>
<p>some meat or fish, let&rsquo;s say a piece of salmon,</p>
<p>and some vegetable, some fibrous vegetable,</p>
<p>like asparagus or cabbage or something like that.</p>
<p>If you were to eat all of that at once,</p>
<p>you take a bite of one, a bite of the other,</p>
<p>you mix it up, one of these,</p>
<p>it all ends up in the same place kind of people,</p>
<p>mix it all up, then you will experience an increase</p>
<p>in insulin and increase in blood glucose</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s moderately fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to increase pretty quickly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable is that the order</p>
<p>that you consume each macronutrient</p>
<p>has a pretty profound influence on the rate of insulin</p>
<p>and glucose secretion into the blood</p>
<p>and how quickly those levels rise.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll make it really simple.</p>
<p>If you were to eat the rice first,</p>
<p>your glucose would rise in a sharp spike,</p>
<p>especially if it doesn&rsquo;t contain any fats</p>
<p>to slow the absorption.</p>
<p>Now, that might be good if you&rsquo;re very hungry</p>
<p>and you want to get an increase in glucose.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the reason</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re often served bread before meals</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, and sometimes it&rsquo;s bread and butter,</p>
<p>but, or chips before meals or appetizer</p>
<p>are designed to get your blood glucose going up high</p>
<p>because big, steep increases in blood glucose</p>
<p>tend to promote the desire to consume more glucose.</p>
<p>And this also relates to the dopamine system</p>
<p>and the way that something tasty in the mouth</p>
<p>and sugar in the gut and fats and sugars in the mouth</p>
<p>trigger the activation of a lot of systems</p>
<p>in the brain and body to consume more of whatever you have</p>
<p>or whatever is available to you.</p>
<p>So the basic idea is that eating carbohydrates</p>
<p>and or fats early in a meal</p>
<p>will give a steep rise in blood glucose.</p>
<p>However, if you were to eat the fibrous thing first,</p>
<p>so a lot of chewing, but not a big rise in blood glucose</p>
<p>because in general there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s laden with sugar or something,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just talking about a, you know,</p>
<p>some vegetable, fibrous vegetable,</p>
<p>that will actually blunt the release of glucose</p>
<p>until you eat the fish and the rice.</p>
<p>But believe it or not,</p>
<p>it will actually blunt the glucose increase</p>
<p>that the rice would cause.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not talking about neurotically</p>
<p>eating each macronutrient separately in sequence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to give you a picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening ordinarily.</p>
<p>So what this means is if you feel</p>
<p>a lot of food-related anxiety,</p>
<p>or you feel you&rsquo;re one of these people</p>
<p>that you can kind of sense</p>
<p>like your blood sugar increasing very quickly,</p>
<p>a lot of people can sense this, some people can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>has a lot to do with how well they manage their blood sugar</p>
<p>as well as some of the psychological factors.</p>
<p>And yes, there are family and historical reasons,</p>
<p>where, you know, I&rsquo;ve got friends who had a lot of siblings</p>
<p>and when they sit down to eat,</p>
<p>they have to really suppress the desire</p>
<p>to not, you know, beat up everyone else at the table</p>
<p>and take all the food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for them to understand</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s plenty to go around because of their upbringing.</p>
<p>So there are psychological top-down effects.</p>
<p>A lot of the psychology around food</p>
<p>is geared towards getting people to be relaxed</p>
<p>when they eat and these sorts of things.</p>
<p>But these blood sugar effects are real,</p>
<p>just cellar and basic biochemistry</p>
<p>of how the body manages sugars ingested into the blood.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean?</p>
<p>It means that if you want a steep increase in glucose,</p>
<p>you are very, very hungry,</p>
<p>then you should eat the carbohydrate-laden food first,</p>
<p>or you should eat a bunch of macronutrients combined.</p>
<p>So that would be like the hamburger or the sandwich,</p>
<p>the bread, whatever&rsquo;s in that sandwich all together.</p>
<p>Usually that&rsquo;s protein and vegetables as well.</p>
<p>If you want to have a kind of more modest</p>
<p>increase in glucose,</p>
<p>or you want to blunt the increase in glucose,</p>
<p>then have at least some of the fibrous thing first,</p>
<p>and then the protein, and then the carbohydrate.</p>
<p>You will notice that your blood glucose</p>
<p>will rise more steadily,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ll achieve satiety earlier in the meal,</p>
<p>or at least you won&rsquo;t get this huge peak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of the Thanksgiving meal effect.</p>
<p>Some of you are international,</p>
<p>so if you don&rsquo;t celebrate Thanksgiving,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a time of year where,</p>
<p>used to be the one time of year or two times a year</p>
<p>where Americans would give themselves permission</p>
<p>to eat enormous meals.</p>
<p>Now that seems to happen a lot more often,</p>
<p>but there is this effect of you&rsquo;re full,</p>
<p>and yet you&rsquo;re hungry for more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because your blood glucose has gone through the roof</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s triggered a number of other mechanisms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also usually a lot of alcohol consumption,</p>
<p>and alcohol itself, because it&rsquo;s a sugar,</p>
<p>will increase blood glucose very, very sharply.</p>
<p>It depends on the alcohol.</p>
<p>Some alcohols have more sugar than others,</p>
<p>but basically what you&rsquo;re trying to avoid</p>
<p>are steep increases in blood sugar,</p>
<p>and the order that you eat foods</p>
<p>has an enormous impact on that.</p>
<p>The other thing that has an enormous impact</p>
<p>on how long and shallow or how steep</p>
<p>that curve of glucose is</p>
<p>depends on whether or not you recently were moving,</p>
<p>are moving, or start moving after you eat.</p>
<p>So it turns out that your blood glucose levels</p>
<p>can be modulated very, very powerfully by movement.</p>
<p>If you did any kind of intense exercise,</p>
<p>or even just walking, or jogging, or cycling,</p>
<p>anything before you eat,</p>
<p>your blood glucose levels will be dampened somewhat.</p>
<p>And that has to do with the release of something called,</p>
<p>some people call it GLUT4, which sounds like glutton.</p>
<p>Other people call it GLUT4.</p>
<p>These are things that are involved</p>
<p>in shuttling glucose to particular cells in the body,</p>
<p>namely toward muscle and glycogen stores,</p>
<p>and away from body fat stores.</p>
<p>It has to do with sequestering of glucose from the blood.</p>
<p>The point is that if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who struggles with blood sugar regulation,</p>
<p>in addition to getting your body weight in a healthy range,</p>
<p>doing all the other sorts of things</p>
<p>that you should be doing,</p>
<p>the key thing is to try and get some movement,</p>
<p>sometime circa meal.</p>
<p>Now, very few people can actually eat and walk</p>
<p>at the same time, although I do it all the time.</p>
<p>Not because I&rsquo;m trying to regulate my blood sugar,</p>
<p>but just because I tend to be busy.</p>
<p>I eat and drive.</p>
<p>Basically, if I&rsquo;m not giving this podcast or sleeping,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating, except the early part of the day when I fast.</p>
<p>But the bottom line here is that if you, for instance,</p>
<p>take a 30-minute walk after a meal,</p>
<p>your blood glucose will be blunted</p>
<p>in ways that are beneficial.</p>
<p>If you have exercised in the recent hours before a meal,</p>
<p>that can be beneficial.</p>
<p>The order that you consume foods is beneficial.</p>
<p>And there are a few things that you can consume</p>
<p>that can also adjust blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about those,</p>
<p>but I thought it was important to really tamp down</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just what you eat,</p>
<p>we talked about that before,</p>
<p>but also the order that you eat those things,</p>
<p>believe it or not,</p>
<p>whether or not you combine macronutrients,</p>
<p>carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and fibrous vegetables,</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;ve moved recently,</p>
<p>the higher intensity of the movement,</p>
<p>the greater the GLUT4 increase,</p>
<p>and the more that the blood glucose will be blunted</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll shuttle more of that</p>
<p>to glycogen and muscle stores.</p>
<p>And even just moving after a meal,</p>
<p>even just a calm, easy walk,</p>
<p>can really adjust the ways</p>
<p>in which blood sugar regulated for the better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to perseverate</p>
<p>on this processed foods, hidden sugars thing too much,</p>
<p>but understanding now a little bit</p>
<p>about how insulin and glucose work,</p>
<p>you can probably imagine why hidden sugars</p>
<p>are such an attractive thing</p>
<p>from the standpoint of processed food manufacturers,</p>
<p>because if they can put sugar in that you can&rsquo;t even taste,</p>
<p>that sugar is going to amplify the amount of glucose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to increase the rate of glucose increase</p>
<p>into your bloodstream,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to promote more feeding.</p>
<p>So in that case, you&rsquo;re really being tricked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re actually reaching</p>
<p>for the additional appetizer</p>
<p>and your blood glucose is going up.</p>
<p>The food that you ate</p>
<p>is actually increasing your appetite as you eat it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t want to demonize those any more</p>
<p>than I already have,</p>
<p>but you should be aware that these things are happening</p>
<p>at the level of your bloodstream and brain.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;d like to address for a moment</p>
<p>is this notion of stable blood sugar</p>
<p>versus labile blood sugar or unstable blood sugar.</p>
<p>Some people just have stable blood sugar.</p>
<p>They can go long periods of time</p>
<p>without eating and feel fine.</p>
<p>Other people get really shaky, really jittery,</p>
<p>and or when they do eat, they feel really keyed up.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll even sweat.</p>
<p>Sometimes their vision will go blurry.</p>
<p>And some of that can actually be</p>
<p>because they become hyperglycemic.</p>
<p>And those effects that you experience</p>
<p>when you are hyperglycemic are the early warning signs</p>
<p>of the kinds of things that damage neurons</p>
<p>and lead to the really terrible stuff</p>
<p>that I talked about before, like peripheral neuropathies.</p>
<p>Now, it takes some time for those things to occur,</p>
<p>those neuropathies to occur,</p>
<p>but whether or not your blood sugar is all over the place</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s stable</p>
<p>can be impacted by a number of things.</p>
<p>One of those things is exercise.</p>
<p>So these days there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in what they call zone two cardio,</p>
<p>which is that kind of steady state cardio</p>
<p>where you can just nasal breathe,</p>
<p>even at pretty high output,</p>
<p>where you could maybe have a conversation,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m such a huge proponent</p>
<p>of nasal breathing during exercise,</p>
<p>most forms of exercise, especially zone two cardio,</p>
<p>that you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be talking</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re doing that cardio</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s absolutely essential.</p>
<p>But periods of zone two cardio</p>
<p>that last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour</p>
<p>or sometimes more for your endurance athletes</p>
<p>can create positive effects on blood sugar regulation</p>
<p>such that you, people can sit down</p>
<p>and enjoy whatever it is, the hot fudge sundae</p>
<p>or whatever the high sugar content food is,</p>
<p>and blood glucose management is so good,</p>
<p>your insulin sensitivity is so high, which is a good thing,</p>
<p>that you can manage that blood glucose</p>
<p>to the point where it doesn&rsquo;t really make you shaky,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t disrupt you,</p>
<p>and to say nothing of the weight-related issues</p>
<p>or the adipose fat gain, et cetera,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a separate issue because people vary there,</p>
<p>but basically doing zone two cardio for 30 to 60 minutes,</p>
<p>three to four times a week</p>
<p>makes your blood sugar really stable,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an attractive thing for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>On the flip side, high intensity interval training</p>
<p>or resistance training, aka weight training,</p>
<p>are very good at stimulating the various molecules</p>
<p>that promote repackaging of glycogen.</p>
<p>So sprints, heavy weightlifting,</p>
<p>circuit-type weightlifting,</p>
<p>provided there&rsquo;s some reasonable degree of resistance,</p>
<p>those are going to trigger all sorts of mechanisms</p>
<p>that are going to encourage the body</p>
<p>to shuttle glucose back into glycogen,</p>
<p>convert into glycogen into muscle tissue,</p>
<p>restock the liver, et cetera.</p>
<p>Depleting one&rsquo;s glycogen actually takes some time.</p>
<p>If you do a couple sets of tricep extensions</p>
<p>and some crunches, you&rsquo;re not depleting your glycogen.</p>
<p>Glycogen depleting workouts are very high intensity.</p>
<p>Generally, they&rsquo;re less than an hour or so,</p>
<p>but those are the sort that are going to lead</p>
<p>to big increases in the kinds of enzymes</p>
<p>and metabolic pathways that are going to repack glycogen</p>
<p>and shuttle most things towards restorage of foods,</p>
<p>not into adipose tissue, not into fat,</p>
<p>but taking glucose and making it into fuels</p>
<p>that you can access later</p>
<p>for more of that high-intensity activity.</p>
<p>And I should mention that one of the advantages</p>
<p>of high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>or weightlifting of various kinds</p>
<p>is that it also causes long standing increases</p>
<p>in basal metabolic rate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go too far down this path</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to do an entire month</p>
<p>on human performance and athletic performance,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just the increases in muscle</p>
<p>that increase metabolism</p>
<p>because muscle burns more energy</p>
<p>than other types of tissues,</p>
<p>except your brain, which truly burns the most energy</p>
<p>and is the main reason why your basal metabolic rate</p>
<p>is what it is.</p>
<p>Well, high-intensity training, so it could be sprints,</p>
<p>it could be a high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>of different kinds, it could be weight training,</p>
<p>also has an effect of increasing thermogenesis</p>
<p>even long after you&rsquo;ve completed the exercise.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a long tail,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of post-exercise metabolic effect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also beneficial.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an either or,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really that high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>and resistance training and things of that sort</p>
<p>are very good for one reason</p>
<p>and the zone two cardio is very good for other reasons.</p>
<p>And now you can see why it&rsquo;s just a healthy thing</p>
<p>and why most people should probably be doing exercise</p>
<p>most days of the week, if not every day of the week.</p>
<p>If your goal is to manage blood glucose</p>
<p>and your goal is to manage some of the metabolic factors</p>
<p>that control repackaging of glycogen</p>
<p>and encouraging excess glucose</p>
<p>to not get diverted into body fat stores.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about lipids today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because most of today&rsquo;s discussion is about hormones</p>
<p>and insulin is the dominant hormone</p>
<p>in terms of mobilizing and managing glucose in the body,</p>
<p>at least for most people.</p>
<p>But fats are very important</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just a little anecdote about fats</p>
<p>that I think will be useful in thinking about</p>
<p>why you want to manage what they call the LDL or HDL ratios.</p>
<p>This is deserving of an entire episode,</p>
<p>perhaps even several episodes,</p>
<p>but some of you may be familiar with LDLs and HDLs.</p>
<p>Some of you may not.</p>
<p>The LDL is low-density lipoprotein.</p>
<p>This is the one that you don&rsquo;t want it to be too high.</p>
<p>Costello&rsquo;s dreaming, he&rsquo;s barking.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t, he loves all forms of cholesterol,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just Costello dreaming.</p>
<p>So LDLs are the ones that you want to keep low.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want those to go excessively high.</p>
<p>HDLs, the high-density lipoproteins,</p>
<p>are the ones that are the so-called healthy lipoproteins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all fine and good,</p>
<p>but you might ask yourself, what are they doing?</p>
<p>What is the actual role of these things?</p>
<p>And why would you want healthy levels of HDL</p>
<p>and not too much LDL?</p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons is that fats don&rsquo;t like water.</p>
<p>They are hydrophobic.</p>
<p>And yet you need to move fats in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>All tissues in your body need fats.</p>
<p>They need cholesterols.</p>
<p>Last episode, we talked about how cholesterol</p>
<p>is a precursor to the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>estrogen, and testosterone, and other hormones as well.</p>
<p>Well, HDL and LDL actually coat fats</p>
<p>to allow them to be transported through the bloodstream.</p>
<p>They do a number of other things as well,</p>
<p>but HDL is a key component of the delivery system</p>
<p>that brings those fats to the liver,</p>
<p>ovaries, testes, and adrenals.</p>
<p>In other words, having adequate levels of HDL is good</p>
<p>because it allows fats to be delivered to the tissues</p>
<p>that manufacture testosterone, estrogen,</p>
<p>cortisol in healthy levels, and the liver.</p>
<p>So this is why when LDLs are too high,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re not getting fats</p>
<p>to the correct tissues,</p>
<p>and you can get buildup of fats like fatty liver disease,</p>
<p>and some of these things can happen.</p>
<p>High sugar content can even lead</p>
<p>to some of these fatty liver conditions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s starting to happen.</p>
<p>This is actually the first time in human history, perhaps,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re aware of anyway,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re starting to see liver conditions</p>
<p>that normally were associated only with severe alcoholism</p>
<p>starting to come from sugar content.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means keep your LDL and HDL ratios proper.</p>
<p>You want those HDLs in order to deliver fatty molecules</p>
<p>to the very tissues that use cholesterol</p>
<p>in order to manufacture hormones.</p>
<p>So how do you keep LDLs and HDLs in their proper ratios?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but the debate about dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>and its relationship to LDL and HDL ratios,</p>
<p>it is a barbed wire debate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into it right now.</p>
<p>There are still a lot of open questions</p>
<p>as to how much dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>impacts LDL and HDL ratios.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into that now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking a stance either way,</p>
<p>but what is very clear</p>
<p>is that having highly elevated glucose,</p>
<p>consuming too much sugar,</p>
<p>or not managing glucose in your body</p>
<p>through some of the mechanisms</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about up until now</p>
<p>can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.</p>
<p>So managing glucose goes way beyond</p>
<p>just managing blood sugar</p>
<p>and making sure that you don&rsquo;t lay down too much body fat,</p>
<p>making sure your metabolism stays high,</p>
<p>making sure you&rsquo;re not getting jittery at meals.</p>
<p>It also has to do with making sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re creating enough of the molecules, HDL,</p>
<p>and not too many of the molecules, LDL,</p>
<p>that are going to disrupt the delivery of things</p>
<p>to the organs of your body</p>
<p>that allow you to make healthy levels</p>
<p>of testosterone, estrogen, and so forth.</p>
<p>If that wasn&rsquo;t clear, let me make this ultra simple.</p>
<p>You want healthy levels of HDL</p>
<p>and you want low levels of LDL</p>
<p>because if you have ovaries,</p>
<p>it will allow the fats that need to get to the ovary</p>
<p>to produce estrogen to get there.</p>
<p>And if you have testes,</p>
<p>it will allow the fats and the cholesterol molecules</p>
<p>that you need in order to manufacture testosterone</p>
<p>to get to the testes.</p>
<p>As well, in order to have proper adrenal function</p>
<p>and proper liver function,</p>
<p>you want HDL and LDL in the healthy, correct levels.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about behavioral tools</p>
<p>and the underlying biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that justify those tools in particular circumstances.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to turn to supplements and prescription drugs</p>
<p>that regulate the hormone systems,</p>
<p>controlling feeding and satiety.</p>
<p>There are a huge number of these.</p>
<p>Some have more powerful effects than others.</p>
<p>There are two that I want to describe</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of attention recently.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s a prescription drug, Metformin,</p>
<p>which was developed as a treatment for diabetes</p>
<p>and it works potently to reduce blood glucose.</p>
<p>It has dramatic effects in lowering blood glucose.</p>
<p>Metformin involves changes to mitochondrial action</p>
<p>in the liver.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s its main way of depleting or reducing blood glucose.</p>
<p>And it does so through the so-called AMPK pathway</p>
<p>and it increases insulin sensitivity overall.</p>
<p>Metformin is a powerful drug.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m surprised that so many people</p>
<p>have sought it out given that most of the people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of that sought it out are not diabetic.</p>
<p>I think for diabetics, it seems to be a useful drug.</p>
<p>For non-diabetics, it can also, of course,</p>
<p>lower blood glucose.</p>
<p>It also has the potential to make people hypoglycemic,</p>
<p>genuinely hypoglycemic.</p>
<p>So you really need to approach Metformin with caution.</p>
<p>I get a little concerned when I hear about people</p>
<p>blasting Metformin simply because fasted states</p>
<p>or low blood sugar states are healthy.</p>
<p>Doing that pharmacologically</p>
<p>can have longstanding effects.</p>
<p>You really want to approach that with caution.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a comparable drug.</p>
<p>It really should be called a drug,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s non-prescription that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>in fairly prominent use out there called berberine.</p>
<p>B-E-R-B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct.</p>
<p>So berberine is a really interesting compound.</p>
<p>Its actions very much mimic Metformin.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about berberine for a second.</p>
<p>Berberine actually comes from various plants and tree bark.</p>
<p>It is sold in supplement stores.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sold online.</p>
<p>It is, as far as I know, unregulated.</p>
<p>It is powerful.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to experiment with berberine,</p>
<p>you definitely want to talk to your doctor</p>
<p>and you want to approach it with caution.</p>
<p>It also works to activate the so-called AMPK pathway.</p>
<p>AMPK, by the way,</p>
<p>stands for adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase,</p>
<p>AMPK, and it inhibits a protein tyrosine phosphase,</p>
<p>1B pathway.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough nomenclature.</p>
<p>It activates a certain pathway that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with fasting and low blood glucose.</p>
<p>The effects of berberine are, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>when looking at the literature,</p>
<p>are very similar, if not identical, to Metformin.</p>
<p>Now, the number of studies out there on this</p>
<p>are many, so I&rsquo;m just going to review a few of them</p>
<p>and their major effects.</p>
<p>As always, I invite you to check out examine.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful website where you can put in</p>
<p>any supplement or compound or biological goal,</p>
<p>for that matter, and it will list out the various effects</p>
<p>in the human effect matrix, so studies on humans,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re available, and it will tell you</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re strong effects or weak effects</p>
<p>or modest effects, and it will point</p>
<p>to the specific subject population, a wonderful resource.</p>
<p>So berberine, not surprisingly, has very strong effects</p>
<p>in lowering blood glucose.</p>
<p>There are four studies on this.</p>
<p>In fact, they say that berberine is one of the more,</p>
<p>if not the most effective supplements</p>
<p>for lowering blood glucose.</p>
<p>It talks about dosages there, although I&rsquo;ll just mention</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve tried berberine, and the dosages that are typical</p>
<p>on the bottle of most supplements</p>
<p>is much higher than I needed.</p>
<p>So when I took berberine, two things happened.</p>
<p>First of all, I got a pretty splitting headache.</p>
<p>It gave me pretty vicious headache.</p>
<p>So for me, it was a no almost immediately.</p>
<p>The other thing is I became so hypoglycemic</p>
<p>that in order to get my blood sugar back up,</p>
<p>I think I ate something like 10 donuts,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t feel like I had ingested all that much sugar.</p>
<p>It was really kind of weird.</p>
<p>I was hyperphagic for sugar.</p>
<p>I was craving sugar, craving sugar,</p>
<p>and I was very thirsty as well,</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t want to promote any bad behavior,</p>
<p>but I know that certain people use this</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve overeaten sugars</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re doing their cheat days,</p>
<p>something that I&rsquo;m personally just not a fan of,</p>
<p>and they want to keep their blood sugar in check</p>
<p>or they know they&rsquo;re going to consume a huge meal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll take berberine to keep blood glucose clamped,</p>
<p>and it does do that.</p>
<p>It has very strong effects, three peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>on HbA1c levels.</p>
<p>HbA1c is something that can be measured in a blood test</p>
<p>that is sort of an average readout</p>
<p>of your blood sugar levels</p>
<p>over the previous two or three months,</p>
<p>sometimes shorter period,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s mostly what HbA1c is about.</p>
<p>So it radically decreases your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>It actually lowers cholesterol.</p>
<p>It acts, remember, on the liver,</p>
<p>and the liver is involved in cholesterol metabolism,</p>
<p>and remember, it&rsquo;s both sugars, blood glucose,</p>
<p>and dietary fats, perhaps, it&rsquo;s still heavily debated,</p>
<p>in terms of how your blood total cholesterol,</p>
<p>HDL, and LDL are regulated.</p>
<p>So it seems to lower total cholesterol,</p>
<p>and it seems like it lowers HDL and LDL in parallel.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>One study showed a minor increase in HDL,</p>
<p>the so-called good cholesterol.</p>
<p>Insulin levels drop, not surprising.</p>
<p>Another study showed a slight decrease in LDL.</p>
<p>Those seem to be kind of minor.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a kind of interesting one,</p>
<p>just to help you remember berberine,</p>
<p>as if the fact that it comes from tree bark</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a trigger enough to remember it.</p>
<p>Direct contact of berberine on canker sores</p>
<p>seems to eliminate canker sores very quickly,</p>
<p>which is kind of cool.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had canker sores in a few years,</p>
<p>but when I did get them, they were extremely painful.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like those.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of interesting,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some study references there.</p>
<p>I find it amazing that these compounds exist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this prescription drug, metformin,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got berberine, the stuff from tree bark,</p>
<p>and they have effects</p>
<p>that are essentially equivalent to one another.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not promoting their use</p>
<p>or even their exploration,</p>
<p>but those compounds do exist.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out there, and check out examine.com</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to learn more.</p>
<p>Certainly do your reading,</p>
<p>do your homework before you start just popping this stuff.</p>
<p>And if you have hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia,</p>
<p>be especially careful,</p>
<p>and also do understand that dosages</p>
<p>and dose requirements vary.</p>
<p>So if you do go down this path,</p>
<p>really approach things carefully.</p>
<p>Always start with the lowest amount</p>
<p>that you could get away with.</p>
<p>For me, the headache thing just made it a no-go.</p>
<p>I do keep a bottle of it, in full disclosure,</p>
<p>in the odd chance that I feel like eating a ton of donuts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much about not ingesting the calories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t like the feeling</p>
<p>of being hyperglycemic, the blurry vision,</p>
<p>just feeling lousy.</p>
<p>I do love donuts.</p>
<p>Other things that impact blood glucose</p>
<p>in supplement form.</p>
<p>Chromium has been shown in 29 studies to have a minor,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize a minor effect</p>
<p>on reducing blood glucose.</p>
<p>Things like L-carnitine,</p>
<p>something we&rsquo;ve talked about here on the podcast before,</p>
<p>in terms of its relationship to power output</p>
<p>in ATP production for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise,</p>
<p>as well as sperm quality and egg quality.</p>
<p>We talked about that long ago.</p>
<p>Things like panache ginseng can have positive effects on,</p>
<p>I should say, can have effects</p>
<p>of reducing blood glucose slightly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give valence to,</p>
<p>or judgment to whether or not it&rsquo;s positive or negative.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>that you should know about.</p>
<p>Caffeine has very reliably been shown</p>
<p>to increase blood glucose just a little bit, okay?</p>
<p>So I always thought that caffeine would drop blood glucose,</p>
<p>but it actually can increase blood glucose just slightly.</p>
<p>Things like magnesium.</p>
<p>Talked about magnesium as a tool</p>
<p>for enhancing the passage into sleep.</p>
<p>In particular, magnesium threonate and biglycinate.</p>
<p>Magnesium can also have a modest reduction</p>
<p>in blood glucose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to get the impression</p>
<p>everything reduces blood glucose,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s certainly not the case.</p>
<p>And then a couple episodes ago,</p>
<p>when we were discussing nutrition,</p>
<p>we talked about artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>sucralose, aspartame, NutraSweet.</p>
<p>Some of those are generic names.</p>
<p>Some of those might be brand names</p>
<p>and how they have negative effects on the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s supported by a number of studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one artificial sweetener,</p>
<p>Stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A,</p>
<p>which seems to lower blood glucose just slightly.</p>
<p>And I still can&rsquo;t find data</p>
<p>on whether or not Stevia impacts the gut microbiome</p>
<p>in either direction.</p>
<p>Many of the things that I consume</p>
<p>do have small amounts of Stevia in them.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to know if anyone out there</p>
<p>is aware of quality peer-reviewed research</p>
<p>as to whether or not Stevia impacts the gut microbiome</p>
<p>similarly or differently from other artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>please let me know.</p>
<p>Please send me the references.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really appreciate it.</p>
<p>You can put it in the comment section on YouTube</p>
<p>or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Comment section on YouTube would be the best place.</p>
<p>So Stevia seems to lower blood glucose a little bit,</p>
<p>which makes it kind of an attractive artificial sweetener</p>
<p>if one is going to use artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>But remember, sweet taste itself</p>
<p>stimulates the desire to eat,</p>
<p>which will increase more blood glucose.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m guessing that they probably cancel each other out.</p>
<p>So you have to think logically about these things.</p>
<p>Vitamin B3.</p>
<p>So some of the B vitamins do indeed stimulate appetite</p>
<p>by triggering increases in blood glucose,</p>
<p>vitamin B3 in particular.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if B6 does.</p>
<p>Things like zinc seem to lower blood glucose.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ve been an enormous number of other things</p>
<p>that have been tested for their roles in blood glucose.</p>
<p>Apple cider vinegar, anything acidic.</p>
<p>This is well-known now that any kind of acidity,</p>
<p>so it could be lemon juice or lime juice</p>
<p>or apple cider vinegar lowers blood glucose slightly.</p>
<p>Some of those can also have other effects</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not talking about today.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a movement now towards creating,</p>
<p>sort of people talk about becoming more alkaline.</p>
<p>You know, I hate to break it to you,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really want your body to be too alkaline.</p>
<p>You want to stay in the right pH or else you start,</p>
<p>there are conditions that make you more alkaline.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be too acidic or too alkaline.</p>
<p>If you see a beverage or something</p>
<p>that purports that ingesting that beverage</p>
<p>is going to make you more alkaline,</p>
<p>that is absolutely false.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible biochemically, it&rsquo;s just marketing.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, ingesting foods that are acidic</p>
<p>can make some slight adjustments to the pH of the gut</p>
<p>in ways that can slow or alter the absorption of foods</p>
<p>and can blunt blood glucose.</p>
<p>You can try this sometime if you want.</p>
<p>If ever you&rsquo;re feeling kind of over-sugared out,</p>
<p>like you ate something with too much sugar,</p>
<p>you can drink a small amount of lemon juice</p>
<p>mixed with water or lime juice.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice that it will blunt</p>
<p>that kind of hyperglycemic effect just a little bit.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t want to use this as a medical tool,</p>
<p>but the effect is fairly potent.</p>
<p>And then, excuse me.</p>
<p>And then there are a number of other things</p>
<p>like capsaicin and hot chili peppers</p>
<p>that will lower blood glucose.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>The most powerful one is absolutely berberine and metformin,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really heavy caliber stuff.</p>
<p>And the other ones I mentioned have more minor effects.</p>
<p>I do want to mention,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sure some of you out there</p>
<p>are curious about the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do an entire episode</p>
<p>about ketosis and the brain and the body.</p>
<p>But the ketogenic diet has been shown in 22 studies</p>
<p>to have a notable decrease on blood glucose.</p>
<p>And that is not surprising</p>
<p>because the essence of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re consuming very little or zero</p>
<p>of the foods that promote big spikes in insulin and glucose.</p>
<p>If you consume enough protein,</p>
<p>some of that protein can be converted into glucose,</p>
<p>of course, through gluconeogenesis.</p>
<p>But the ketogenic diet has very strong support</p>
<p>for its role in regulating blood sugar, which is glucose.</p>
<p>But the specific effects of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and one particular effect that I&rsquo;ll address later,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll mention now,</p>
<p>which is the ability of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>to adjust thyroid hormone levels</p>
<p>in ways that make it such</p>
<p>that if you return to eating carbohydrates</p>
<p>after being in ketosis for too long,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t manage thyroid and carbohydrates as well.</p>
<p>That has been shown as well.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to dive deep into ketosis in a future episode.</p>
<p>So for you ketonistas out there, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>I certainly have nothing against ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t have anything for</p>
<p>or against any particular nutrition plan.</p>
<p>I know what works for me, at least at this stage of my life,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll update it if I need to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply trying to get you as much information</p>
<p>as I possibly can so that you can navigate</p>
<p>through that landscape in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in keeping with your particular goals.</p>
<p>So now you understand a lot about blood sugar</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s managed and the ways that you can manage it</p>
<p>better depending on your particular needs.</p>
<p>This is also a good opportunity for us to look back</p>
<p>at some of the medical literature,</p>
<p>because it really points to just how far we&rsquo;ve come</p>
<p>in terms of understanding these important mechanisms.</p>
<p>And it points us in the direction</p>
<p>of some actionable protocols.</p>
<p>So diabetes, which is these huge increases in blood glucose</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no insulin,</p>
<p>was known about as early as 1500 BC,</p>
<p>which is just incredible.</p>
<p>And the way physicians then understood</p>
<p>that certain people had high blood glucose</p>
<p>without actually knowing what blood glucose was</p>
<p>is that they would take the urine of particular patients</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d find that ants preferably moved toward</p>
<p>and consumed the urine of certain patients and not others.</p>
<p>And they understood that there was something in that urine</p>
<p>that was correlated with a sudden weight loss</p>
<p>and some of the other probably very unfortunate health</p>
<p>symptoms that these people were experiencing.</p>
<p>So they knew that there was something in blood</p>
<p>and urine, but you might not be asking yourself,</p>
<p>wait, that&rsquo;s urine.</p>
<p>But as I tell every kid that I meet two things,</p>
<p>I tell a kid, your brain is here.</p>
<p>I make them point to their head.</p>
<p>And then I tell them, do you know what?</p>
<p>Do you know that your urine is actually filtered blood?</p>
<p>And they usually go,</p>
<p>I get parental permission to do this first.</p>
<p>But most adults don&rsquo;t realize that your urine</p>
<p>is actually just filtered blood.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why if you see blood in your urine,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>You want to filter the blood, but urine is filtered blood.</p>
<p>Now, this business of measuring blood sugar from the urine</p>
<p>has been something that lasted way beyond</p>
<p>these early stages of 1500 BC.</p>
<p>Turns out that as late as 1674,</p>
<p>physicians at Oxford University were figuring out</p>
<p>who had pathologically high levels of blood glucose</p>
<p>by analyzing their urine.</p>
<p>And again, they were measuring the sweetness of their urine,</p>
<p>but, and this is medical fact,</p>
<p>they would do this by taking urine samples</p>
<p>from different patients and tasting them.</p>
<p>And they developed an intuitive sense</p>
<p>of what excessively sweet urine was</p>
<p>relative to the other urines that they had tasted.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are in the medical profession</p>
<p>or those of you that are seeking out the medical profession</p>
<p>do understand this is not done anymore.</p>
<p>And you can also just reflect on how far we&rsquo;ve come</p>
<p>in terms of the medical profession itself</p>
<p>in our ability to measure things from the blood</p>
<p>and measure things from urine without having to ask ants</p>
<p>which urine is sweeter or ask oneself which urine is sweeter.</p>
<p>So indeed we are making progress as a species.</p>
<p>Before we close out today,</p>
<p>I want to talk about one more tool</p>
<p>that many of you will probably find useful.</p>
<p>I certainly have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big consumer of caffeine,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t consume a ton of it.</p>
<p>I consume it very consistently.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m big on consuming mate,</p>
<p>which is a strong caffeinated tea.</p>
<p>And I generally do that early in the day.</p>
<p>Although I do delay about two hours after I wake up</p>
<p>for reasons I&rsquo;ve talked about in previous episode</p>
<p>to maintain that nice arc of alertness and focus.</p>
<p>I do drink black coffee as well, mushroom coffee as well.</p>
<p>I love that stuff.</p>
<p>But mate, also called yerba mate,</p>
<p>is an interesting compound because unlike coffee,</p>
<p>it has been shown to increase</p>
<p>something called glucagon-like peptide, GLP-1,</p>
<p>and increase leptin levels.</p>
<p>Now we didn&rsquo;t talk a lot about glucagon today.</p>
<p>Glucagon is really elevated in the fasting state.</p>
<p>I mentioned that it&rsquo;s sort of the opposite of insulin</p>
<p>in kind of rough terms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to think about it.</p>
<p>But GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide one,</p>
<p>is increased by ingesting mate,</p>
<p>and it acts as a pretty nice appetite suppressant.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not trying to suppress my appetite.</p>
<p>I like to eat, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>but it works really well to stimulate the brain</p>
<p>and to give you a level of alertness.</p>
<p>And to do a lot of the things that coffee does,</p>
<p>it also contains electrolytes.</p>
<p>So we, meaning our neurons and our brain,</p>
<p>run on a variety of factors,</p>
<p>electrical activity and chemical transmission, et cetera,</p>
<p>but they require adequate levels</p>
<p>of sodium, potassium, and magnesium.</p>
<p>Actually, if you were to learn the biology</p>
<p>or the physiology of the action potential,</p>
<p>the firing of a neuron,</p>
<p>something we teach every first-year neuroscience student,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be happy to teach you if you&rsquo;re interested,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hear about sodium rushing into cells</p>
<p>and potassium entering and leaving cells</p>
<p>in order to allow neurons to communicate.</p>
<p>Electrolytes are critically important</p>
<p>for the function of the nervous system.</p>
<p>And many things that act as diuretics</p>
<p>that promote excretion of water, like caffeine,</p>
<p>can also take electrolytes out</p>
<p>along with in particular sodium.</p>
<p>And sometimes the lightheadedness or the brain fog</p>
<p>that people experience</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just because electrolytes are low,</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re kind of out of balance.</p>
<p>So I like mate because it has electrolytes, it has caffeine,</p>
<p>it stimulates the release</p>
<p>of this glucagon-like peptide, GLP-1,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been a big help to me</p>
<p>in extending that early morning fasting window</p>
<p>out to about noon or so when I eat my first meal.</p>
<p>It also just tastes really good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drink it out of the gourd,</p>
<p>even though I have Argentine lineage.</p>
<p>The gourd to me, it&rsquo;s just kind of an inconvenience.</p>
<p>I drink it out of a mug.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no promotional here.</p>
<p>I have no relationship to any yerba mate plantations</p>
<p>or companies.</p>
<p>I just happen to really like the stuff.</p>
<p>And the fact that glucagon-like peptide one is enriched</p>
<p>or is released more when you drink mate,</p>
<p>and the fact that GLP-1 can regulate blood sugar</p>
<p>in ways that keep your blood sugar in that,</p>
<p>we called euglycemic, not too high, not too low mode,</p>
<p>is one reason why ingesting mate is attractive to me.</p>
<p>If you go to South America,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see, especially among Uruguayans,</p>
<p>but also Argentines,</p>
<p>is people actually carry a thermos of this stuff</p>
<p>with them around and bring it to meals in restaurants.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just considered cultural convention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual to see that.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t see that so much here in the States,</p>
<p>but I happen to really love this stuff.</p>
<p>I brew my own,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the most economical way to do it.</p>
<p>And I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>It can be a little bitter for some people.</p>
<p>The real key there, if you want to know the mate trick,</p>
<p>is to not use water that&rsquo;s really boiling hot.</p>
<p>You go just shy of boil,</p>
<p>and then it doesn&rsquo;t have that same kind of tobacco-like</p>
<p>or really acidic flavor to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit, just a little bit sweeter,</p>
<p>although not quite sweet.</p>
<p>So Yerba Mate, GLP-1, can manage, in healthy ways,</p>
<p>leptin levels, glucose levels, and glucagon levels</p>
<p>in ways that, if it serves you, you might want to try.</p>
<p>So once again, we covered an enormous amount of material</p>
<p>focused on how hormones regulate feeding, hunger,</p>
<p>and when one feels they don&rsquo;t need to eat,</p>
<p>so-called satiety, that you&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>
<p>As always, we covered a lot,</p>
<p>but I could not be exhaustive</p>
<p>about all the information related to this topic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so vast.</p>
<p>For instance, we did not talk about thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>an extremely important hormone and pathway</p>
<p>in the body and brain.</p>
<p>We are going to do an episode related to thyroid</p>
<p>and tools to regulate thyroid, I promise.</p>
<p>Having seen this episode,</p>
<p>you will be able to digest that material</p>
<p>with far more ease.</p>
<p>We also didn&rsquo;t talk about the fact that testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen can impact blood glucose</p>
<p>in ways that are opposite to one another,</p>
<p>that when estrogen levels are high,</p>
<p>appetite tends to be reduced.</p>
<p>When testosterone levels are high,</p>
<p>appetite tends to increase.</p>
<p>So there are all sorts of interesting interplays</p>
<p>between the various hormones,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s much too much of a deep dive for now.</p>
<p>Right now, we&rsquo;ve just focused today</p>
<p>mainly on things like ghrelin,</p>
<p>on things like melanocyte-simulating hormone,</p>
<p>incredible, powerful hormone that can suppress appetite,</p>
<p>on things like cholecystokinin that comes from the gut</p>
<p>and can suppress appetite,</p>
<p>on things like food emulsifiers,</p>
<p>on the fact that when you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>you are amino acid-seeking,</p>
<p>even though you might not realize it,</p>
<p>that you are also seeking out particular fatty acids,</p>
<p>in particular, the conjugated linoleic acids and omega-3s.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve tried to give you a number of actionable tools.</p>
<p>Many of them are behavioral.</p>
<p>Some of them are based on supplements</p>
<p>or even prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Again, always do what&rsquo;s best for your health</p>
<p>and do that in company with a healthcare professional.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physician.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor.</p>
<p>I profess a lot of things.</p>
<p>And I try and share with you</p>
<p>what I think to be the best</p>
<p>high-quality peer-reviewed literature.</p>
