<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Manolis Kellis.</p>
<p>What to you is the most beautiful aspect</p>
<p>of the human genome?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me started.</p>
<p>So. We&rsquo;ve got time.</p>
<p>The first answer is that the beauty of genomes</p>
<p>transcends humanity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about the human genome.</p>
<p>Genomes in general are amazingly beautiful.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m obviously biased.</p>
<p>So in my view, the way that I like to introduce</p>
<p>the human genome and the way that I like to introduce</p>
<p>genomics to my class is by telling them,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re not the inventors</p>
<p>of the first digital computer.</p>
<p>We are the descendants of the first digital computer.</p>
<p>Basically, life is digital.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s absolutely beautiful about life.</p>
<p>The fact that at every replication step,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t lose any information</p>
<p>because that information is digital.</p>
<p>If it was analog, if it was just sprouting concentrations,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d lose it after a few generations.</p>
<p>It would just dissolve away.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the ancients</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t understand about inheritance.</p>
<p>The first person to understand digital inheritance</p>
<p>was Mendel, of course.</p>
<p>And his theory, in fact, stayed in a bookshelf</p>
<p>for like 50 years while Darwin was getting famous</p>
<p>about natural selection.</p>
<p>But the missing component was this digital inheritance,</p>
<p>the mechanism of evolution that Mendel had discovered.</p>
<p>So that aspect in my view is the most beautiful aspect</p>
<p>but it transcends all of life.</p>
<p>And can you elaborate maybe the inheritance part?</p>
<p>What was the key thing that the ancients didn&rsquo;t understand?</p>
<p>So the very theory of inheritance as discrete units,</p>
<p>throughout the life of Mendel and well after he&rsquo;s writing,</p>
<p>people thought that his P experiments</p>
<p>were just a little fluke,</p>
<p>that they were just a little exception</p>
<p>that would normally not even apply to humans,</p>
<p>that basically what they saw</p>
<p>is this continuum of eye color,</p>
<p>this continuum of skin color,</p>
<p>this continuum of hair color,</p>
<p>this continuum of height.</p>
<p>And all of these continuums did not fit</p>
<p>with a discrete type of inheritance</p>
<p>that Mendel was describing.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s unique about genomics</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s unique about the genome</p>
<p>is really that there are two copies</p>
<p>and that you get a combination of these.</p>
<p>But for every trait,</p>
<p>there are dozens of contributing variables.</p>
<p>And it was only Ronald Fisher in the 20th century</p>
<p>that basically recognized that even five Mendelian traits</p>
<p>would add up to a continuum like inheritance pattern.</p>
<p>And he wrote a series of papers</p>
<p>that still are very relevant today</p>
<p>about sort of this Mendelian inheritance</p>
<p>of continuum like traits.</p>
<p>And I think that that was the missing step in inheritance.</p>
<p>So well before the discovery of the structure of DNA,</p>
<p>which is again, another amazingly beautiful aspect,</p>
<p>the double helix,</p>
<p>what I like to call the most noble molecule of our time,</p>
<p>holds within it the secret of that discrete inheritance,</p>
<p>but the conceptualization of discrete elements</p>
<p>is something that precedes that.</p>
<p>So even though it&rsquo;s discrete,</p>
<p>when it materializes itself into actual traits that we see,</p>
<p>it can be continuous.</p>
<p>Basically arbitrarily rich and complex.</p>
<p>So if you have five genes that contribute to human height,</p>
<p>and there aren&rsquo;t five, there&rsquo;s a thousand.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s only five genes</p>
<p>and you inherit some combination of them,</p>
<p>and every one makes you two inches taller</p>
<p>or two inches shorter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll look like a continuous trait.</p>
<p>But instead of five, there are thousands.</p>
<p>And every one of them contributes to less than one millimeter.</p>
<p>We change in height more during the day</p>
<p>than each of these genetic variants contributes.</p>
<p>So by the evening, you&rsquo;re shorter than you walk up with.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that weird then</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not more different than we are?</p>
<p>Why are we all so similar</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s so much possibility to be different?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there are selective advantages to being medium.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re extremely tall or extremely short,</p>
<p>you run into selective disadvantages.</p>
<p>So you have trouble breathing, you have trouble running,</p>
<p>you have trouble sitting if you&rsquo;re too tall.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too short, you might, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>have other selective pressures are acting against that.</p>
<p>If you look at natural history of human population,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually selection for height in Northern Europe</p>
<p>and selection against height in Southern Europe.</p>
<p>So there might actually be advantages</p>
<p>to actually being not super tall.</p>
<p>And if you look across the entire human population,</p>
<p>for many, many traits,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of push towards the middle.</p>
<p>Balancing selection is the usual term</p>
<p>for selection that sort of seeks to not be extreme</p>
<p>and to sort of have a combination of alleles</p>
<p>that sort of keep recombining.</p>
<p>And if you look at mate selection,</p>
<p>super, super tall people</p>
<p>will not tend to sort of marry super, super tall people.</p>
<p>Very often you see these couples</p>
<p>that are kind of compensating for each other.</p>
<p>And the best predictor of the kid&rsquo;s age</p>
<p>is very often just take the average of the two parents</p>
<p>and then adjust for sex and boom, you get it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely heritable.</p>
<p>Let me ask, you kind of took a step back to the genome</p>
<p>outside of just humans,</p>
<p>but is there something that you find beautiful</p>
<p>about the human genome specifically?</p>
<p>So I think the genome,</p>
<p>if more people understood the beauty of the human genome,</p>
<p>there would be so many fewer wars,</p>
<p>so much less anger in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s really beautiful about the human genome</p>
<p>is really the variation</p>
<p>that teaches us both about individuality</p>
<p>and about similarity.</p>
<p>So any two people on the planet are 99.9% identical.</p>
<p>How can you fight with someone who&rsquo;s 99.9% identical to you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just counterintuitive.</p>
<p>And yet any two siblings of the same parents</p>
<p>differ in millions of locations.</p>
<p>So every one of them is basically two to the million unique</p>
<p>from any pair of parents,</p>
<p>let alone any two random parents on the planet.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think, something that teaches us</p>
<p>about sort of the nature of humanity in many ways,</p>
<p>that every one of us is as unique as any star</p>
<p>and way more unique in actually many ways.</p>
<p>And yet we&rsquo;re all brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like stars, most of it is just fusion reactions.</p>
<p>Yeah, you only have a few parameters to describe stars.</p>
<p>Mass, size, initial size, and stage of life.</p>
<p>Whereas for humans, it&rsquo;s thousands of parameters</p>
<p>scattered across our genome.</p>
<p>So the other thing that makes humans unique,</p>
<p>the other things that makes inheritance unique in humans</p>
<p>is that most species inherit things vertically.</p>
<p>Basically instinct is a huge part of their behavior.</p>
<p>The way that, I mean, with my kids,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been watching this nest of birds</p>
<p>with two little eggs outside our window</p>
<p>for the last few months,</p>
<p>for the last few weeks as they&rsquo;ve been growing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much behavior that&rsquo;s hard coded.</p>
<p>Birds don&rsquo;t just learn as they grow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no culture.</p>
<p>Like a bird that&rsquo;s born in Boston</p>
<p>will be the same as a bird that&rsquo;s born in California.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not as much inheritance of ideas, of customs.</p>
<p>A lot of it is hard coding in their genome.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really beautiful about the human genome</p>
<p>is that if you take a person from today</p>
<p>and you place them back in ancient Egypt,</p>
<p>or if you take a person from ancient Egypt</p>
<p>and you place them here today,</p>
<p>they will grow up to be completely normal.</p>
<p>That is not genetics.</p>
<p>This is the other type of inheritance in humans.</p>
<p>So on one hand, we have the genetic inheritance,</p>
<p>which is vertical from your parents down.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have horizontal inheritance,</p>
<p>which is the ideas that are built up at every generation</p>
<p>are horizontally transmitted.</p>
<p>And the huge amount of time</p>
<p>that we spend in educating ourselves,</p>
<p>a concept known as neoteny,</p>
<p>neo for newborn and then teny for holding.</p>
<p>So if you look at humans,</p>
<p>I mean, the little birds that were eggs two weeks ago,</p>
<p>and now one of them has already flown off.</p>
<p>The other one&rsquo;s ready to fly off.</p>
<p>In two weeks, they&rsquo;re ready to just fend for themselves.</p>
<p>Humans, 16 years, 18 years, 24, getting out of college.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s so fascinating,</p>
<p>this picture of a vertical and the horizontal.</p>
<p>When you talk about the horizontal,</p>
<p>is it in the realm of ideas?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s the actual social interactions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So basically the concept of neoteny</p>
<p>is that you spend acquiring characteristics</p>
<p>from your environment</p>
<p>in an extremely malleable state of your brain</p>
<p>and the wiring of your brain for a long period of your life.</p>
<p>Compared to primates, we are useless.</p>
<p>You take any primate at seven weeks</p>
<p>and any human at seven weeks, we lose the battle.</p>
<p>But at 18 years, you know, all bets are off.</p>
<p>Like we basically, our brain continues to develop</p>
<p>in an extremely malleable form till very late.</p>
<p>And this is what allows education.</p>
<p>This is what allows the person from Egypt</p>
<p>to do extremely well now.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that the wiring of our brain</p>
<p>and the development of that wiring is actually delayed.</p>
<p>So, you know, the longer you delay that,</p>
<p>the more opportunity you have to pass on knowledge,</p>
<p>to pass on concepts, ideals, ideas</p>
<p>from the parents to the child.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really absolutely beautiful about humans today</p>
<p>is that that lateral transfer of ideas and culture</p>
<p>is not just from uncles and aunts and teachers at school,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s from Wikipedia and review articles on the web</p>
<p>and thousands of journals</p>
<p>that are sort of putting out information for free</p>
<p>and podcasts and videocasts and all of that stuff</p>
<p>where you can basically learn about any topic,</p>
<p>pretty much everything that would be in any</p>
<p>super advanced textbook in a matter of days,</p>
<p>instead of having to go to the library of Alexandria</p>
<p>and sail there to read three books</p>
<p>and then sail for another few days to get to Athens</p>
<p>and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the democratization of knowledge</p>
<p>and the spread, the speed of spread of knowledge</p>
<p>is what defines, I think, the human inheritance pattern.</p>
<p>So you sound excited about it, are you also a little bit</p>
<p>afraid or are you more excited by the power</p>
<p>of this kind of distributed spread of information?</p>
<p>So you put it very kindly that most people</p>
<p>are kind of using the internet and looking Wikipedia,</p>
<p>reading articles, reading papers and so on,</p>
<p>but if we&rsquo;re honest, most people online,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re younger,</p>
<p>probably looking at five second clips on TikTok</p>
<p>or whatever the new social network is,</p>
<p>are you, given this power of horizontal inheritance,</p>
<p>are you optimistic or a little bit pessimistic</p>
<p>about this new effect of the internet</p>
<p>and democratization of knowledge on our,</p>
<p>what would you call this, this genome,</p>
<p>would you use the term genome, by the way, for this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we use the genome to talk about DNA,</p>
<p>but very often we say, I&rsquo;m Greek,</p>
<p>so people ask me, hey, what&rsquo;s in the Greek genome?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, yeah, what&rsquo;s in the Greek genome</p>
<p>is both our genes and also our ideas</p>
<p>and our ideals and our culture.</p>
<p>So the poetic meaning of the word.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s a beauty</p>
<p>to the democratization of knowledge,</p>
<p>the fact that you can reach as many people</p>
<p>as any other person on the planet</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not who you are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really your ideas that matter,</p>
<p>is a beautiful aspect of the internet.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, of course, a danger of my ignorance</p>
<p>is as important as your expertise.</p>
<p>The fact that with this democratization</p>
<p>comes the abolishment of respecting expertise.</p>
<p>Just because you&rsquo;ve spent 10,000 hours of your life</p>
<p>studying, I don&rsquo;t know, human brain circuitry,</p>
<p>why should I trust you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna make up my own theories</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be just as good as yours,</p>
<p>is an attitude that sort of counteracts</p>
<p>the beauty of the democratization.</p>
<p>And I think that within our educational system</p>
<p>and within the upbringing of our children,</p>
<p>we have to not only teach them knowledge,</p>
<p>but we have to teach them the means to get to knowledge.</p>
<p>And that, it&rsquo;s very similar to sort of you fish,</p>
<p>you catch a fish for a man for one day,</p>
<p>you fed them for one day, you teach them how to fish,</p>
<p>you fed them for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>So instead of just gathering the knowledge</p>
<p>they need for any one task,</p>
<p>we can just tell them, all right,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how you Google it,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how you figure out what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how you check the sources,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how you form a basic opinion for yourself.</p>
<p>And I think that inquisitive nature</p>
<p>is paramount to being able to sort through</p>
<p>this huge wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>So you need a basic educational foundation</p>
<p>based on which you can then add on</p>
<p>the sort of domain specific knowledge,</p>
<p>but that basic educational foundation</p>
<p>should just not just be knowledge,</p>
<p>but it should also be epistemology,</p>
<p>the way to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure any of us know how to do that</p>
<p>in this modern day, we&rsquo;re actually learning.</p>
<p>One of the big surprising thing to me</p>
<p>about the coronavirus, for example,</p>
<p>is that Twitter has been</p>
<p>one of the best sources of information.</p>
<p>Basically like building your own network of experts,</p>
<p>as opposed to the traditional centralized expertise</p>
<p>of the WHO and the CDC,</p>
<p>or maybe any one particular respectable person</p>
<p>at the top of a department in some kind of institution,</p>
<p>you instead look at 10, 20, hundreds of people,</p>
<p>some of whom are young kids that are incredibly good</p>
<p>at aggregating data and plotting and visualizing that data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been really surprising to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that matures into something stable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have ideas.</p>
<p>If you were to just try to explain to your kids</p>
<p>of where should you go to learn about coronavirus,</p>
<p>what would you say?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a beautiful example.</p>
<p>And I think the current pandemic</p>
<p>and the speed at which the scientific community has moved</p>
<p>in the current pandemic,</p>
<p>I think exemplifies this horizontal transfer</p>
<p>and the speed of horizontal transfer of information.</p>
<p>The fact that the genome was first sequenced</p>
<p>in early January,</p>
<p>the first sample was obtained December 29, 2019,</p>
<p>a week after the publication of the first genome sequence,</p>
<p>Moderna had already finalized its vaccine design</p>
<p>and was moving to production.</p>
<p>I mean, this is phenomenal.</p>
<p>The fact that we go from not knowing</p>
<p>what the heck is killing people in Wuhan</p>
<p>to wow, it&rsquo;s SARS CoV2 and here&rsquo;s the set of genes,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the genome, here&rsquo;s the sequence,</p>
<p>here are the polymorphisms, et cetera,</p>
<p>in the matter of weeks is phenomenal.</p>
<p>In that incredible pace of transfer of knowledge,</p>
<p>there have been many mistakes.</p>
<p>So, some of those mistakes</p>
<p>may have been politically motivated</p>
<p>or other mistakes may have just been innocuous errors.</p>
<p>Others may have been misleading the public</p>
<p>for the greater good, such as don&rsquo;t wear masks</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t want the mask to run out.</p>
<p>I mean, that was very silly in my view</p>
<p>and a very big mistake.</p>
<p>But the spread of knowledge</p>
<p>from the scientific community was phenomenal.</p>
<p>And some people will point out to bogus articles</p>
<p>that snuck in and made the front page.</p>
<p>Yeah, they did.</p>
<p>But within 24 hours, they were debunked</p>
<p>and went out of the front page.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the beauty of science today.</p>
<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s not, oh, knowledge is fixed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability to embrace that nothing is permanent</p>
<p>when it comes to knowledge,</p>
<p>that everything is the current best hypothesis</p>
<p>and the current best model that best fits the current data</p>
<p>and the willingness to be wrong.</p>
<p>The expectation that we&rsquo;re gonna be wrong</p>
<p>and the celebration of success based on</p>
<p>how long was I not proven wrong for,</p>
<p>rather than, wow, I was exactly right.</p>
<p>Because no one is gonna be exactly right</p>
<p>with partial knowledge.</p>
<p>But the arc towards perfection,</p>
<p>I think is so much more important</p>
<p>than how far you are in your first step.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what sort of</p>
<p>the current pandemic has taught us.</p>
<p>The fact that, yeah, no, of course,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make mistakes,</p>
<p>but at least we&rsquo;re gonna learn from those mistakes</p>
<p>and become better and learn better</p>
<p>and spread information better.</p>
<p>So if I were to answer the question of,</p>
<p>where would you go to learn about coronavirus?</p>
<p>First textbook, it all starts with a textbook.</p>
<p>Just open up a chapter on virology</p>
<p>and how coronaviruses work.</p>
<p>Then some basic epidemiology</p>
<p>and sort of how pandemics have worked in the past.</p>
<p>What are the basic principles surrounding</p>
<p>these first wave, second wave?</p>
<p>Why do they even exist?</p>
<p>Then understanding about growth,</p>
<p>understanding about the R0 and RT</p>
<p>at various time points.</p>
<p>And then understanding the means of spread,</p>
<p>how it spreads from person to person.</p>
<p>Then how does it get into your cells?</p>
<p>From when it gets into the cells,</p>
<p>what are the paths that it takes?</p>
<p>What are the cell types that express</p>
<p>the particular ACE2 receptor?</p>
<p>How is your immune system interacting with the virus?</p>
<p>And once your immune system launches a defense,</p>
<p>how is that helping or actually hurting your health?</p>
<p>What about the cytokine storm?</p>
<p>What are most people dying from?</p>
<p>Why are the comorbidities</p>
<p>and these risk factors even applying?</p>
<p>What makes obese people respond more</p>
<p>or elderly people respond more to the virus</p>
<p>while kids are completely,</p>
<p>very often not even aware that they&rsquo;re spreading it?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s some basic questions</p>
<p>that you would start from.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m sorry to say,</p>
<p>but Wikipedia is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is. Google is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>It used to be a time,</p>
<p>it used to be a time maybe five years ago.</p>
<p>I forget when,</p>
<p>but people kind of made fun of Wikipedia</p>
<p>for being an unreliable source.</p>
<p>I never quite understood it.</p>
<p>I thought from the early days, it was pretty reliable</p>
<p>or better than a lot of the alternatives.</p>
<p>But at this point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a solid accessible survey paper</p>
<p>on every subject ever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ascertainment bias and a writing bias.</p>
<p>So I think this is related to sort of people saying,</p>
<p>oh, so many nature papers are wrong.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, why would you publish in nature?</p>
<p>So many nature papers are wrong.</p>
<p>And my answer is no, no, no.</p>
<p>So many nature papers are scrutinized.</p>
<p>And just because more of them are being proven wrong</p>
<p>than in other articles is actually evidence</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actually better papers overall</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re being scrutinized at a rate</p>
<p>much higher than any other journal.</p>
<p>So if you basically judge Wikipedia</p>
<p>by not the initial content,</p>
<p>but by the number of revisions,</p>
<p>then of course it&rsquo;s gonna be the best source</p>
<p>of knowledge eventually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still very superficial.</p>
<p>You then have to go into the review papers,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I mean, for most scientific topics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely superficial,</p>
<p>but it is quite authoritative</p>
<p>because it is the place that everybody likes to criticize</p>
<p>as being wrong.</p>
<p>You say that it&rsquo;s superficial.</p>
<p>And a lot of topics that I&rsquo;ve studied a lot of,</p>
<p>I find it, I don&rsquo;t know if superficial is the right word.</p>
<p>Because superficial kind of implies that it&rsquo;s not correct.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean any implication of it not being correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just superficial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically only scratching the surface.</p>
<p>For depth, you don&rsquo;t go to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You go to the review articles.</p>
<p>But it can be profound in the way that articles rarely,</p>
<p>one of the frustrating things to me</p>
<p>about certain computer science,</p>
<p>like in the machine learning world,</p>
<p>articles, they don&rsquo;t as often take the bigger picture view.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of data set and you show that it works</p>
<p>and you kind of show that here&rsquo;s an architecture thing</p>
<p>that creates an improvement and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t say, well, what does this mean</p>
<p>for the nature of intelligence for future data sets</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t even thought about?</p>
<p>Or if you were trying to implement this,</p>
<p>like if we took this data set of 100,000 examples</p>
<p>and scale it to 100 billion examples with this method,</p>
<p>like look at the bigger picture,</p>
<p>which is what a Wikipedia article would actually try to do,</p>
<p>which is like, what does this mean in the context</p>
<p>of the broad field of computer vision or something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I agree with you completely, but it depends</p>
<p>on the topic.</p>
<p>I mean, for some topics, there&rsquo;s been a huge amount of work.</p>
<p>For other topics, it&rsquo;s just a stub.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, actually the, which we&rsquo;ll talk on,</p>
<p>genomics was not great.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very shallow, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not wrong, it&rsquo;s just shallow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shallow.</p>
<p>Yeah, every time I criticize something,</p>
<p>I should feel partly responsible.</p>
<p>Basically, if more people from my community went there</p>
<p>and edited, it would not be shallow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that there&rsquo;s different modes of communication</p>
<p>in different fields.</p>
<p>And in some fields, the experts have embraced Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In other fields, it&rsquo;s relegated.</p>
<p>And perhaps the reason is that if it was any better</p>
<p>to start with, people would invest more time.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s not great to start with,</p>
<p>then you need a few initial pioneers who will basically</p>
<p>go in and say, ah, enough, we&rsquo;re just gonna fix that.</p>
<p>And then I think it&rsquo;ll catch on much more.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s okay, before we go on to genomics,</p>
<p>can we linger a little bit longer on the beauty</p>
<p>of the human genome?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given me a few notes.</p>
<p>What else do you find beautiful about the human genome?</p>
<p>So the last aspect of what makes the human genome unique,</p>
<p>in addition to the, you know, similarity and the differences</p>
<p>and the individuality is that, so very early on,</p>
<p>people would basically say, oh, you don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>experiment in human, you have to learn about that in fly,</p>
<p>or you have to learn about that in yeast first,</p>
<p>or in mouse first, or in a primate first.</p>
<p>And the human genome was in fact relegated to sort of,</p>
<p>oh, the last place that you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>to learn something new.</p>
<p>That has dramatically changed.</p>
<p>And the reason that changed is human genetics.</p>
<p>We are the species in the planet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most studied right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing to say that,</p>
<p>but this was not the case a few years ago.</p>
<p>It used to be, you know, first viruses, then bacteria,</p>
<p>then yeast, then the fruit fly and the worm,</p>
<p>then the mouse, and eventually human was very far last.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s embarrassing that it took us this long</p>
<p>to focus on it, or the&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing that the model organisms</p>
<p>have been taken over because of the power of human genetics.</p>
<p>That right now, it&rsquo;s actually simpler to figure out</p>
<p>the phenotype of something by mining</p>
<p>this massive amount of human data</p>
<p>than by going back to any of the other species.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that if you look</p>
<p>at the natural variation that happens</p>
<p>in a population of seven billion,</p>
<p>you basically have a mutation in almost every nucleotide.</p>
<p>So every nucleotide you wanna perturb,</p>
<p>you can go find a living, breathing human being</p>
<p>and go test the function of that nucleotide</p>
<p>by sort of searching the database and finding that person.</p>
<p>Wait, why is that embarrassing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful data set.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing for the model organism.</p>
<p>For the flies.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, do you feel on a small tangent,</p>
<p>is there something of value in the genome of a fly</p>
<p>and other of these model organisms that you miss</p>
<p>that we wish we would be looking at deeper?</p>
<p>So directed perturbation, of course.</p>
<p>So I think the place where humans are still lagging</p>
<p>is the fact that in an animal model,</p>
<p>you can go and say,</p>
<p>well, let me knock out this gene completely</p>
<p>and let me knock out these three genes completely.</p>
<p>And the moment you get into combinatorics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t do in the human</p>
<p>because there just simply aren&rsquo;t enough humans</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>And again, let me be honest,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t sequenced all seven billion people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we have every mutation,</p>
<p>but we know that there&rsquo;s a carrier out there.</p>
<p>So if you look at the trend and the speed</p>
<p>with which human genetics has progressed,</p>
<p>we can now find thousands of genes involved</p>
<p>in human cognition, in human psychology,</p>
<p>in the emotions and the feelings</p>
<p>that we used to think are uniquely learned.</p>
<p>It turns out there&rsquo;s a genetic basis to a lot of that.</p>
<p>So the human genome has continued to elucidate</p>
<p>through these studies of genetic variation,</p>
<p>so many different processes that we previously thought</p>
<p>were something like free will.</p>
<p>Free will is this beautiful concept</p>
<p>that humans have had for a long time.</p>
<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of chemical reactions</p>
<p>happening in your brain.</p>
<p>And the particular abundance of receptors</p>
<p>that you have this day based on what you ate yesterday</p>
<p>or that you have been wired with based on your parents</p>
<p>and your upbringing, et cetera,</p>
<p>determines a lot of that quote unquote free will component</p>
<p>to sort of narrow and narrow sort of slices.</p>
<p>So how much on that point, how much freedom</p>
<p>do you think we have to escape the constraints</p>
<p>of our genome?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making it sound like more and more</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re discovering that our genome is actually has the,</p>
<p>a lot of the story already encoded into it.</p>
<p>How much freedom do we have?</p>
<p>I, so let me describe what that freedom would look like.</p>
<p>That freedom would be my saying,</p>
<p>ooh, I&rsquo;m gonna resist the urge to eat that apple</p>
<p>because I choose not to.</p>
<p>But there are chemical receptors that made me</p>
<p>not resist the urge to prove my individuality</p>
<p>and my free will by resisting the apple.</p>
<p>So then the next question is,</p>
<p>well, maybe now I&rsquo;ll resist the urge to resist the apple</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go for the chocolate instead</p>
<p>to prove my individuality.</p>
<p>But then what about those other receptors that, you know?</p>
<p>That might be all encoded in there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kicking the bucket down the road</p>
<p>and basically saying, well, your choice</p>
<p>will may have actually been driven by other things</p>
<p>that you actually are not choosing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very hard to answer that question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what to do with that.</p>
<p>I mean, if the genome has,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s not much freedom, it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the butterfly effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically that in the short term,</p>
<p>you can predict something extremely well</p>
<p>by knowing the current state of the system.</p>
<p>But a few steps down, it&rsquo;s very hard to predict</p>
<p>based on the current knowledge.</p>
<p>Is that because the system is truly free?</p>
<p>When I look at weather patterns,</p>
<p>I can predict the next 10 days.</p>
<p>Is it because the weather has a lot of freedom</p>
<p>and after 10 days it chooses to do something else?</p>
<p>Or is it because in fact the system is fully deterministic</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just a slightly different magnetic field</p>
<p>of the earth, slightly more energy arriving from the sun,</p>
<p>a slightly different spin of the gravitational pull</p>
<p>of Jupiter that is now causing all kinds of tides</p>
<p>and slight deviation of the moon, et cetera.</p>
<p>Maybe all of that can be fully modeled.</p>
<p>Maybe the fact that China is emitting</p>
<p>a little more carbon today is actually gonna affect</p>
<p>the weather in Egypt in three weeks.</p>
<p>And all of that could be fully modeled.</p>
<p>In the same way, if you take a complete view</p>
<p>of a human being now, I model everything about you.</p>
<p>The question is, can I predict your next step?</p>
<p>Probably, but at how far?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a little further, is that because of stochasticity</p>
<p>and sort of chaos properties of unpredictability</p>
<p>of beyond a certain level?</p>
<p>Or was that actually true free will?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the number of variables might be so,</p>
<p>you might need to build an entire universe to be able to model.</p>
<p>To simulate a human, and then maybe that human</p>
<p>will be fully simulatable.</p>
<p>But maybe aspects of free will will exist.</p>
<p>And where&rsquo;s that free will coming from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still coming from the same neurons</p>
<p>or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these neurons.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s very difficult empirically</p>
<p>to sort of evaluate where does free will begin</p>
<p>and sort of chemical reactions and electric signals.</p>
<p>So on that topic, let me ask the most absurd question</p>
<p>that most MIT faculty rolled their eyes on.</p>
<p>But what do you think about the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>and the idea that we live in a simulation?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s complete BS.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no empirical evidence.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Not in terms of empirical evidence or not,</p>
<p>but in terms of a thought experiment,</p>
<p>does it help you think about the universe?</p>
<p>I mean, so if you look at the genome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s encoding a lot of the information</p>
<p>that is required to create some of the beautiful</p>
<p>human complexity that we see around us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment.</p>
<p>How much parameters do we need to have</p>
<p>in order to model this full human experience?</p>
<p>Like if we were to build a video game,</p>
<p>how hard it would be to build a video game</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like convincing enough and fun enough</p>
<p>and it has consistent laws of physics, all that stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not interesting to use a thought experiment.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s cute, but it&rsquo;s Occam&rsquo;s razor.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s more realistic,</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re actually a machine</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re a person?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the fact that all of my experiences exist</p>
<p>inside the chemical molecules that I have</p>
<p>or that somebody is actually simulating all that?</p>
<p>Well, you did refer to humans</p>
<p>as a digital computer earlier.</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>But that does not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of a machine, right?</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>But I think the probability of all that is nil</p>
<p>and let the machines wake me up</p>
<p>and just terminate me now if it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I challenge you machines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna wait a little bit</p>
<p>to see what you&rsquo;re gonna do next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to watch, especially the clever humans.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference to you</p>
<p>between the way a computer stores information</p>
<p>and the human genome stores information?</p>
<p>So you also have roots and your work.</p>
<p>Would you say when you introduce yourself at a bar.</p>
<p>It depends who I&rsquo;m talking to.</p>
<p>Would you say it&rsquo;s computational biology?</p>
<p>Do you reveal your expertise in computers?</p>
<p>It depends who I&rsquo;m talking to, truly.</p>
<p>I mean, basically, if I meet someone who&rsquo;s in computers,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, oh, I&rsquo;m a professor in computer science.</p>
<p>If I meet someone who&rsquo;s in engineering,</p>
<p>I say computer science and electrical engineering.</p>
<p>If I meet someone in biology,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, hey, I work in genomics.</p>
<p>If I meet someone in medicine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hey, I work on genetics.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a fun person to meet at a bar.</p>
<p>I got you, but so.</p>
<p>No, no, but what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no single attribute</p>
<p>that I will define myself as.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things I know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things I study.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things I have degrees on</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a few things that I grant degrees in.</p>
<p>And I publish papers across the whole gamut,</p>
<p>the whole spectrum of computation to biology, et cetera.</p>
<p>I mean, the complete answer is that I use computer science</p>
<p>to understand biology.</p>
<p>So I develop methods in AI and machine learning,</p>
<p>statistics and algorithms, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the ultimate goal of my career</p>
<p>is to really understand biology.</p>
<p>If these things don&rsquo;t advance our understanding</p>
<p>of biology, I&rsquo;m not as fascinated by them.</p>
<p>Although there are some beautiful computational problems</p>
<p>by themselves, I&rsquo;ve sort of made it my mission</p>
<p>to apply the power of computer science</p>
<p>to truly understand the human genome, health, disease,</p>
<p>and the whole gamut of how our brain works,</p>
<p>how our body works and all of that,</p>
<p>which is so fascinating.</p>
<p>And so the dream, there&rsquo;s not an equivalent</p>
<p>sort of complimentary dream of understanding</p>
<p>human biology in order to create an artificial life</p>
<p>or an artificial brain or artificial intelligence</p>
<p>that supersedes the intelligence</p>
<p>and the capabilities of us humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating question.</p>
<p>So understanding the human brain is undoubtedly coupled</p>
<p>to how do we make better AI?</p>
<p>Because so much of AI has in fact been inspired</p>
<p>by the brain.</p>
<p>It may have taken 50 years</p>
<p>since the early days of neural networks</p>
<p>till we have all of these amazing progress</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve seen with deep belief networks</p>
<p>and all of these advances in Go, in Chess,</p>
<p>in image synthesis, in deep fakes, in you name it.</p>
<p>But the underlying architecture is very much inspired</p>
<p>by the human brain,</p>
<p>which actually posits a very, very interesting question.</p>
<p>Why are neural networks performing so well?</p>
<p>And they perform amazingly well.</p>
<p>Is it because they can simulate any possible function?</p>
<p>And the answer is no, no.</p>
<p>They simulate a very small number of functions.</p>
<p>Is it because they can simulate every function</p>
<p>in the universe?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>The answer is actually, yeah, a little closer to that.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where it gets really fun.</p>
<p>If you look at human brain and human cognition,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t evolve in a vacuum.</p>
<p>It evolved in a world with physical constraints,</p>
<p>like the world that inhabits us.</p>
<p>It is the world that we inhabit.</p>
<p>And if you look at our senses, what do they perceive?</p>
<p>They perceive different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>The hearing is just different movements in air,</p>
<p>the touch, et cetera.</p>
<p>I mean, all of these things,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built intuitions for the physical world</p>
<p>that we inhabit.</p>
<p>And our brains and the brains of all animals evolved</p>
<p>for that world.</p>
<p>And the AI systems that we have built</p>
<p>happen to work well with images</p>
<p>of the type that we encounter</p>
<p>in the physical world that we inhabit.</p>
<p>Whereas if you just take noise and you add random signal</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t match anything in our world,</p>
<p>neural networks will not do as well.</p>
<p>And that actually basically has this whole loop around this,</p>
<p>which is this was designed by studying our own brain,</p>
<p>which was evolved for our own world.</p>
<p>And they happen to do well in our own world.</p>
<p>And they happen to make the same types of mistakes</p>
<p>that humans make many times.</p>
<p>And of course you can engineer images</p>
<p>by adding just the right amount of sort of pixel deviations</p>
<p>to make a zebra look like a bamboo and stuff like that,</p>
<p>or like a table.</p>
<p>But ultimately the undoctored images at least</p>
<p>are very often mistaken, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>between muffins and dogs, for example,</p>
<p>in the same way that humans make those mistakes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no doubt in my view</p>
<p>that the more we understand about the tricks</p>
<p>that our human brain has evolved</p>
<p>to understand the physical world around us,</p>
<p>the more we will be able to bring</p>
<p>new computational primitives in our AI systems</p>
<p>to again better understand not just the world around us,</p>
<p>but maybe even the world inside us,</p>
<p>and maybe even the computational problems that arise</p>
<p>from new types of data that we haven&rsquo;t been exposed to,</p>
<p>but are yet inhabiting the same universe that we live in</p>
<p>with a very tiny little subset of functions</p>
<p>from all possible mathematical functions.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that small subset of functions,</p>
<p>all that matters to us humans really, that&rsquo;s what makes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all that has mattered so far.</p>
<p>And even within our scientific realm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all that seems to continue to matter.</p>
<p>But I mean, I always like to think about our senses</p>
<p>and how much of the physical world around us we perceive.</p>
<p>And if you look at the LIGO experiment</p>
<p>over the last year and a half has been all over the news.</p>
<p>What did LIGO do?</p>
<p>It created a new sense for human beings,</p>
<p>a sense that has never been sensed</p>
<p>in the history of our planet.</p>
<p>Gravitational waves have been traversing the earth</p>
<p>since its creation a few billion years ago.</p>
<p>Life has evolved senses to sense things</p>
<p>that were never before sensed.</p>
<p>Light was not perceived by early life.</p>
<p>No one cared.</p>
<p>And eventually photoreceptors evolved</p>
<p>and the ability to sense colors</p>
<p>by sort of catching different parts</p>
<p>of that electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>And hearing evolved and touch evolved, et cetera.</p>
<p>But no organism evolved a way to sense neutrinos</p>
<p>floating through earth or gravitational waves</p>
<p>flowing through earth, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I find it so beautiful in the history</p>
<p>of not just humanity, but life on the planet</p>
<p>that we are now able to capture additional signals</p>
<p>from the physical world than we ever knew before.</p>
<p>And axions, for example, have been all over the news</p>
<p>in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>And the concept that we can capture and perceive</p>
<p>more of that physical world is as exciting</p>
<p>as the fact that we were blind to it</p>
<p>is traumatizing before.</p>
<p>Because that also tells us, you know, we&rsquo;re in 2020.</p>
<p>Picture yourself in 3020 or in 20, you know.</p>
<p>What new senses might we discover?</p>
<p>Is it, you know, could it be that we&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>nine tenths of physics?</p>
<p>That like, there&rsquo;s a lot of physics out there</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just blind to, completely oblivious to it.</p>
<p>And yet they&rsquo;re permeating us all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it might be right in front of us.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re thinking about premonitions,</p>
<p>yeah, a lot of that is ascertainment bias.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, you know, every now and then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, I remember my friend.</p>
<p>And then my friend doesn&rsquo;t appear</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll forget that I remembered my friend.</p>
<p>But every now and then my friend will actually appear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, I thought about you a minute ago.</p>
<p>You just called me, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So, you know, some of that is this,</p>
<p>but some of that might be that there are,</p>
<p>within our brain, sensors for waves</p>
<p>that we emit that we&rsquo;re not even aware of.</p>
<p>And this whole concept of when I hug my children,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such an emotional transfer there</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t comprehend.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, yeah, of course we&rsquo;re all like hard wire</p>
<p>for all kinds of touchy feely things</p>
<p>between parents and kids, it&rsquo;s beautiful,</p>
<p>between partners, it&rsquo;s beautiful, et cetera.</p>
<p>But then there are intangible aspects</p>
<p>of human communication</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s unfathomable</p>
<p>that our brain has actually evolved waves and sensors</p>
<p>for it that we just don&rsquo;t capture.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand the function</p>
<p>of the vast majority of our neurons.</p>
<p>And maybe our brain is already sensing it,</p>
<p>but even worse, maybe our brain is not sensing it at all.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re oblivious to this until we build a machine</p>
<p>that suddenly is able to sort of capture</p>
<p>so much more of what&rsquo;s happening in the natural world.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is physics</p>
<p>is going to discover a sensor for love.</p>
<p>And maybe dogs are off scale for that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been oblivious to it the whole time</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t have the right sensor.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re gonna have a little wrist that says,</p>
<p>oh my God, I feel all this love in the house.</p>
<p>I sense a disturbance in the forest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all around us.</p>
<p>And dogs and cats will have zero.</p>
<p>None. None.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>Oh, no signal.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s take a step back to our unfortunate place.</p>
<p>To one of the 400 topics that we had actually planned for.</p>
<p>But to our sad time in 2020</p>
<p>when we only have just a few sensors</p>
<p>and very primitive early computers.</p>
<p>So you have a foot in computer science</p>
<p>and a foot in biology.</p>
<p>In your sense, how do computers represent information</p>
<p>differently than like the genome or biological systems?</p>
<p>So first of all, let me correct</p>
<p>that no, we&rsquo;re in an amazing time in 2020.</p>
<p>Computer science is totally awesome.</p>
<p>And physics is totally awesome.</p>
<p>And we have understood so much of the natural world</p>
<p>than ever before.</p>
<p>So I am extremely grateful and feeling extremely lucky</p>
<p>to be living in the time that we are.</p>
<p>Cause you know, first of all,</p>
<p>who knows when the asteroid will hit.</p>
<p>And second, you know, of all times in humanity,</p>
<p>this is probably the best time to be a human being.</p>
<p>And this might actually be the best place</p>
<p>to be a human being.</p>
<p>So anyway, you know, for anyone who loves science,</p>
<p>this is it.</p>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<p>This is a great time.</p>
<p>At the same time, just a quick comment.</p>
<p>All I meant is that if we look several hundred years</p>
<p>from now and we end up somehow not destroying ourselves,</p>
<p>people will probably look back at this time</p>
<p>in computer science and at your work of Manos at MIT.</p>
<p>As infantile.</p>
<p>As infantile and silly and how ignorant it all was.</p>
<p>I like to joke very often with my students</p>
<p>that, you know, we&rsquo;ve written so many papers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve published so much.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been citing so much.</p>
<p>And every single time I tell my students, you know,</p>
<p>the best is ahead of us.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re working on now</p>
<p>is the most exciting thing I&rsquo;ve ever worked on.</p>
<p>So in a way, I do have this sense of, yeah,</p>
<p>even the papers I wrote 10 years ago,</p>
<p>they were awesome at the time,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m so much more excited about where we&rsquo;re heading now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean to minimize any of the stuff</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done in the past,</p>
<p>but you know, there&rsquo;s just this sense of excitement</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re working on now</p>
<p>that as soon as a paper is submitted,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, ugh, it&rsquo;s old.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t talk about that anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about it.</p>
<p>At the same time, you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you probably are not going to be able to predict</p>
<p>what are the most impactful papers and ideas</p>
<p>when people look back 200 years from now at your work,</p>
<p>what would be the most exciting papers.</p>
<p>And it may very well be not the thing that you expected.</p>
<p>Or the things you got awards for or, you know.</p>
<p>This might be true in some fields.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I feel slightly differently about it in our field.</p>
<p>I feel that I kind of know what are the important ones.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very big difference</p>
<p>between what the press picks up on</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s actually fundamentally important for the field.</p>
<p>And I think for the fundamentally important ones,</p>
<p>we kind of have a pretty good idea what they are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to sometimes get the press excited</p>
<p>about the fundamental advances,</p>
<p>but you know, we take what we get</p>
<p>and celebrate what we get.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you know, one of our papers,</p>
<p>which was in a minor journal,</p>
<p>made the front page of Reddit</p>
<p>and suddenly had like hundreds of thousands of views.</p>
<p>Even though it was in a minor journal</p>
<p>because, you know, somebody pitched it the right way</p>
<p>that it suddenly caught everybody&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Whereas other papers that are sort of truly fundamental,</p>
<p>you know, we have a hard time</p>
<p>getting the editors even excited about them</p>
<p>when so many hundreds of people</p>
<p>are already using the results and building upon them.</p>
<p>So I do appreciate that there&rsquo;s a discrepancy</p>
<p>between the perception and the perceived success</p>
<p>and the awards that you get for various papers.</p>
<p>But I think that fundamentally, I know that, you know,</p>
<p>some paper, I&rsquo;m so, so when you write.</p>
<p>So is there a paper that you&rsquo;re most proud of?</p>
<p>See, now you just, you trapped yourself.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, I mean.</p>
<p>Is there a line of work that you have a sense</p>
<p>is really powerful that you&rsquo;ve done to date?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done so much work in so many directions,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>Is there something where you think is quite special?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like asking me to say</p>
<p>which of my three children I love best.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, I mean, and it&rsquo;s such a gimme question</p>
<p>that is so, so difficult not to brag</p>
<p>about the awesome work that my team</p>
<p>and my students have done.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just mention a few off the top of my head.</p>
<p>I mean, basically there&rsquo;s a few landmark papers</p>
<p>that I think have shaped my scientific path.</p>
<p>And, you know, I like to somehow describe it</p>
<p>as a linear continuation of one thing led to another</p>
<p>and led to another led to another.</p>
<p>And, you know, it kind of all started with,</p>
<p>skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.</p>
<p>Let me try to start somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>So my first PhD paper was the first comparative analysis</p>
<p>of multiple species.</p>
<p>So multiple complete genomes.</p>
<p>So for the first time we basically developed the concept</p>
<p>of genome wide evolutionary signatures.</p>
<p>The fact that you could look across the entire genome</p>
<p>and understand how things evolve.</p>
<p>And from these signatures of evolution</p>
<p>you could go back and study any one region</p>
<p>and say, that&rsquo;s a protein coding gene.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an RNA gene.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a regulatory motif.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, you know, binding site and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, so comparing different.</p>
<p>Different species.</p>
<p>Species of the same.</p>
<p>So take human, mouse, rat and dog.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re all animals, they&rsquo;re all mammals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all performing similar functions with their heart,</p>
<p>with their brain, with their lungs, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many functional elements</p>
<p>that make us uniquely mammalian.</p>
<p>And those mammalian elements are actually conserved.</p>
<p>99% of our genome does not code for protein.</p>
<p>1% codes for protein.</p>
<p>The other 99%, we frankly didn&rsquo;t know what it does</p>
<p>until we started doing this comparative genomic studies.</p>
<p>So basically these series of papers in my career</p>
<p>have basically first developed that concept</p>
<p>of evolutionary signatures and then apply them to yeast,</p>
<p>apply them to flies, apply them to four mammals,</p>
<p>apply them to 17 fungi,</p>
<p>apply them to 12 Drosophila species,</p>
<p>apply them to then 29 mammals and now 200 mammals.</p>
<p>So sorry, so can we.</p>
<p>So the evolutionary signatures seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a fascinating idea.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re probably gonna linger on your early PhD work</p>
<p>for two hours.</p>
<p>But what is, how can you reveal something interesting</p>
<p>about the genome by looking at the multiple,</p>
<p>multiple species and looking at the evolutionary signatures?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you basically align</p>
<p>the matching regions.</p>
<p>So everything evolved from a common ancestor way, way back.</p>
<p>And mammals evolved from a common ancestor</p>
<p>about 60 million years back.</p>
<p>So after the meteor that killed off the dinosaurs landed</p>
<p>near Machu Picchu, we know the crater.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t allegedly land.</p>
<p>That was the aliens, okay.</p>
<p>No, just slightly north of Machu Picchu</p>
<p>in the Gulf of Mexico, there&rsquo;s a giant hole</p>
<p>that that meteor impact.</p>
<p>Sorry, is that definitive to people?</p>
<p>Have people conclusively figured out</p>
<p>what killed the dinosaurs?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>So it was a meteor?</p>
<p>Well, volcanic activity, all kinds of other stuff</p>
<p>is coinciding, but the meteor is pretty unique</p>
<p>and we now have. That&rsquo;s also terrifying.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t, we still have a lot of 2020 left,</p>
<p>so if anything.</p>
<p>No, no, but think about it this way.</p>
<p>So the dinosaurs ruled the earth for 175 million years.</p>
<p>We humans have been around for what?</p>
<p>Less than 1 million years.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re super generous about what you call humans</p>
<p>and you include chimps basically.</p>
<p>So we are just getting warmed up</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve ruled the planet much more ruthlessly</p>
<p>than Tyrannosaurus Rex.</p>
<p>T Rex had much less of an environmental impact</p>
<p>than we did.</p>
<p>And if you give us another 174 million years,</p>
<p>humans will look very different if we make it that far.</p>
<p>So I think dinosaurs basically are much more</p>
<p>of life history on earth than we are in all respects.</p>
<p>But look at the bright side, when they were killed off,</p>
<p>another life form emerged, mammals.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that whole evolutionary branching</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>So you kind of have,</p>
<p>when you have these evolutionary signatures,</p>
<p>is there basically a map of how the genome changed?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So now you can go back to this early mammal</p>
<p>that was hiding in caves and you can basically ask</p>
<p>what happened after the dinosaurs were wiped out.</p>
<p>A ton of evolutionary niches opened up</p>
<p>and the mammals started populating all of these niches.</p>
<p>And in that diversification,</p>
<p>there was room for expansion of new types of functions.</p>
<p>So some of them populated the air with bats flying,</p>
<p>a new evolution of flight.</p>
<p>Some populated the oceans with dolphins and whales</p>
<p>going off to swim, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we all are fundamentally mammals.</p>
<p>So you can take the genomes of all these species</p>
<p>and align them on top of each other</p>
<p>and basically create nucleotide resolution correspondences.</p>
<p>What my PhD work showed is that when you do that,</p>
<p>when you line up species on top of each other,</p>
<p>you can see that within protein coding genes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a particular pattern of evolution</p>
<p>that is dictated by the level at which</p>
<p>evolutionary selection acts.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m coding for a protein and I change</p>
<p>the third codon position of a triplet</p>
<p>that codes for that amino acid,</p>
<p>the same amino acid will be encoded.</p>
<p>So that basically means that any kind of mutation</p>
<p>that preserves that translation that is invariant</p>
<p>to that ultimate functional assessment</p>
<p>that evolution will give is tolerated.</p>
<p>So for any function that you&rsquo;re trying to achieve,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a set of sequences that encode it.</p>
<p>You can now look at the mapping,</p>
<p>the graph isomorphism, if you wish,</p>
<p>between all of the possible DNA encodings</p>
<p>of a particular function and that function.</p>
<p>And instead of having just that exact sequence</p>
<p>at the protein level, you can think of the set</p>
<p>of protein sequences that all fulfill the same function.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s evolution doing?</p>
<p>Evolution has two components.</p>
<p>One component is random, blind, and stupid mutation.</p>
<p>The other component is super smart, ruthless selection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my mom calling from Greece.</p>
<p>Yes, I might be a fully grown man, but I am a Greek.</p>
<p>Did you just cancel the call?</p>
<p>Wow, you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>I know, I&rsquo;m in trouble.</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s gonna be calling the cops.</p>
<p>Honey, are you okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna edit this clip out and send it to her.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of encoding</p>
<p>for the same kind of function.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you now have this mapping</p>
<p>between all of the set of functions</p>
<p>that could all encode the same,</p>
<p>all of the set of sequences</p>
<p>that can all encode the same function.</p>
<p>What evolutionary signatures does</p>
<p>is that it basically looks at the shape</p>
<p>of that distribution of sequences</p>
<p>that all encode the same thing.</p>
<p>And based on that shape, you can basically say,</p>
<p>ooh, proteins have a very different shape</p>
<p>than RNA structures, than regulatory motifs, et cetera.</p>
<p>So just by scanning a sequence, ignoring the sequence</p>
<p>and just looking at the patterns of change,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow, this thing is evolving like a protein</p>
<p>and that thing is evolving like a motif</p>
<p>and that thing is evolving.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s exactly what we just did for COVID.</p>
<p>So our paper that we posted in bioRxiv about coronavirus</p>
<p>basically took this concept of evolutionary signatures</p>
<p>and applied it on the SARS CoV2 genome</p>
<p>that is responsible for the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>And comparing it to?</p>
<p>To 44 serbicovirus species.</p>
<p>So this is the beta.</p>
<p>What word did you just use, serbicovirus?</p>
<p>Serbicovirus, so SARS related beta coronavirus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a portmanteau of a bunch.</p>
<p>So that whole family of viruses.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>How big is that family by the way?</p>
<p>We have 44 species that, or I mean.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 44 species in the family?</p>
<p>Yeah. Virus is a clever bunch.</p>
<p>No, no, but there&rsquo;s just 44.</p>
<p>And again, we don&rsquo;t call them species in viruses.</p>
<p>We call them strains.</p>
<p>But anyway, there&rsquo;s 44 strains.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a tiny little subset of maybe another 50 strains</p>
<p>that are just far too distantly related.</p>
<p>Most of those only infect bats as the host</p>
<p>and a subset of only four or five have ever infected humans.</p>
<p>And we basically took all of those</p>
<p>and we aligned them in the same exact way</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve aligned mammals.</p>
<p>And then we looked at what proteins are,</p>
<p>which of the currently hypothesized genes</p>
<p>for the coronavirus genome</p>
<p>are in fact evolving like proteins and which ones are not.</p>
<p>And what we found is that ORF10,</p>
<p>the last little open reading frame,</p>
<p>the last little gene in the genome is bogus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a protein at all.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an RNA structure.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t have a.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get translated into amino acids.</p>
<p>And that, so it&rsquo;s important to narrow down</p>
<p>to basically discover what&rsquo;s useful and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Basically, what is even the set of genes?</p>
<p>The other thing that these evolutionary signatures showed</p>
<p>is that within ORF3A lies a tiny little additional gene</p>
<p>encoded within the other gene.</p>
<p>So you can translate a DNA sequence</p>
<p>in three different reading frames.</p>
<p>If you start in the first one, it&rsquo;s ATG, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you start on the second one, it&rsquo;s TGC, et cetera.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a gene within a gene.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole other protein</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t know about that might be super important.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t even know the building blocks of SARS COVID 2.</p>
<p>So if we want to understand coronavirus biology</p>
<p>and eventually find it successfully,</p>
<p>we need to even have the set of genes</p>
<p>and these evolutionary signatures</p>
<p>that I developed in my PhD work.</p>
<p>Are you really useful here?</p>
<p>We just recently used.</p>
<p>You know what, let&rsquo;s run with that tangent</p>
<p>for a little bit, if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Can we talk about the COVID 19 a little bit more?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense about the genome, the proteins,</p>
<p>the functions that we understand about COVID 19?</p>
<p>Where do we stand in your sense?</p>
<p>What are the big open problems?</p>
<p>And also, you kind of said it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>what are the important proteins</p>
<p>and why is that important?</p>
<p>So what else does the comparison of these species tell us?</p>
<p>What it tells us is how fast are things evolving?</p>
<p>It tells us about at what level is the acceleration</p>
<p>or deceleration pedal set for every one of these proteins.</p>
<p>So the genome has 30 some genes.</p>
<p>Some genes evolve super, super fast.</p>
<p>Others evolve super, super slow.</p>
<p>If you look at the polymerase gene</p>
<p>that basically replicates the genome,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a super slow evolving one.</p>
<p>If you look at the nucleocapsid protein,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also super slow evolving.</p>
<p>If you look at the spike one protein,</p>
<p>this is the part of the spike protein</p>
<p>that actually touches the ACE2 receptor</p>
<p>and then enables the virus to attach to your cells.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that gives it that visual&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, the corona look basically.</p>
<p>The corona look, yeah.</p>
<p>So basically the spike protein sticks out of the virus</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a first part of the protein S1</p>
<p>which basically attaches to the ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>And then S2 is the latch that sort of pushes and channels</p>
<p>the fusion of the membranes</p>
<p>and then the incorporation of the viral RNA inside our cells</p>
<p>which then gets translated into all of these 30 proteins.</p>
<p>So the S1 protein is evolving ridiculously fast.</p>
<p>So if you look at the stop versus gas pedal,</p>
<p>the gas pedal is all the way down.</p>
<p>ORF8 is also evolving super fast</p>
<p>and ORF6 is evolving super fast.</p>
<p>We have no idea what they do.</p>
<p>We have some idea but nowhere near what S1 is.</p>
<p>So what the&hellip;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that terrifying that S1 is evolving?</p>
<p>That means that&rsquo;s a really useful function</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s evolving fast,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that mean new strains could be created</p>
<p>or it does something?</p>
<p>That means that it&rsquo;s searching for how to match,</p>
<p>how to best match the host.</p>
<p>So basically anything in general in evolution,</p>
<p>if you look at genomes,</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s contacting the environment</p>
<p>is evolving much faster than anything that&rsquo;s internal.</p>
<p>And the reason is that the environment changes.</p>
<p>So if you look at the evolution of the cervical viruses,</p>
<p>the S1 protein has evolved very rapidly</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s attaching to different hosts each time.</p>
<p>We think of them as bats,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s thousands of species of bats</p>
<p>and to go from one species of bat to another species of bat,</p>
<p>you have to adjust S1 to the new ACE2 receptor</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna be facing in that new species.</p>
<p>Sorry, quick tangent.</p>
<p>Is it fascinating to you that viruses are doing this?</p>
<p>I mean, it feels like they&rsquo;re this intelligent organism.</p>
<p>I mean, does it give you pause how incredible it is</p>
<p>that the evolutionary dynamics that you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is actually happening and they&rsquo;re freaking out,</p>
<p>figuring out how to jump from bats to humans</p>
<p>all in this distributed fashion?</p>
<p>And then most of us don&rsquo;t even say</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re alive or intelligent or whatever.</p>
<p>So intelligence is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Stupid is as stupid does, as Forrest Gump would say,</p>
<p>and intelligent is as intelligent does.</p>
<p>So basically if the virus is finding solutions</p>
<p>that we think of as intelligent,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s probably intelligent,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s again in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Do you think viruses are intelligent?</p>
<p>Oh, of course not.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so incredible.</p>
<p>So remember when I was talking about the two components</p>
<p>of evolution, one is the stupid mutation,</p>
<p>which is completely blind,</p>
<p>and the other one is the super smart selection,</p>
<p>which is ruthless.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not viruses who are smart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this component of evolution that&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s evolution that sort of appears smart.</p>
<p>And how is that happening?</p>
<p>By huge parallel search across thousands of parallel</p>
<p>of parallel infections throughout the world right now.</p>
<p>Yes, but so to push back on that,</p>
<p>so yes, so then the intelligence is in the mechanism,</p>
<p>but then by that argument,</p>
<p>viruses would be more intelligent</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just more of them.</p>
<p>So the search, they&rsquo;re basically the brute force search</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening with viruses</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many more of them than humans,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re taken as a whole are more intelligent.</p>
<p>I mean, so you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible that,</p>
<p>I mean, who runs, would we even be here if viruses weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, who runs this thing?</p>
<p>So humans or viruses?</p>
<p>So let me answer, yeah, let me answer your question.</p>
<p>So we would not be here if it wasn&rsquo;t for viruses.</p>
<p>And part of the reason is that</p>
<p>if you look at mammalian evolution early on</p>
<p>in this mammalian radiation</p>
<p>that basically happened after the death of the dinosaurs</p>
<p>is that some of the viruses that we had in our genome</p>
<p>spread throughout our genome</p>
<p>and created binding sites</p>
<p>for new classes of regulatory proteins.</p>
<p>And these binding sites that landed all over our genome</p>
<p>are now control elements that basically control our genes</p>
<p>and sort of help the complexity of the circuitry</p>
<p>of mammalian genomes.</p>
<p>So, you know, everything&rsquo;s coevolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating, we&rsquo;re working together.</p>
<p>And yet you say they&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve coopted them.</p>
<p>No, I never said they&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Another thing, oh, is the virus trying to kill us?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The virus is not trying to kill you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually actively trying to not kill you.</p>
<p>So when you get infected, if you die,</p>
<p>bomber, I killed him,</p>
<p>is what the reaction of the virus will be.</p>
<p>Why? Because that virus won&rsquo;t spread.</p>
<p>Many people have a misconception of,</p>
<p>oh, viruses are smart or oh, viruses are mean.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you have to clean yourself</p>
<p>of any kind of anthropomorphism out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense when taken as a whole that there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Stupid is as stupid does.</p>
<p>Intelligent is as intelligent does.</p>
<p>So if you want to call them intelligent, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Because the end result is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re finding amazing solutions.</p>
<p>I mean, I am in awe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so dumb about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just doing dumb.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not dumb and they&rsquo;re just don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>The care word is really interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, there could be an argument that they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just dividing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just dividing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just a little entity</p>
<p>which happens to be dividing and spreading.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t want to kill us.</p>
<p>In fact, it prefers not to kill us.</p>
<p>It just wants to spread.</p>
<p>And when I say wants, again, I&rsquo;m anthropomorphizing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just that if you have two versions of a virus,</p>
<p>one acquires a mutation that spreads more,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to spread more.</p>
<p>One acquires a mutation that spreads less,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be lost.</p>
<p>One acquires a mutation that enters faster,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be kept.</p>
<p>One acquires a mutation that kills you right away,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be lost.</p>
<p>So over evolutionary time,</p>
<p>the viruses that spread super well</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t kill the host</p>
<p>are the ones that are going to survive.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so you brilliantly described</p>
<p>the basic mechanisms of how it all happens,</p>
<p>but when you zoom out and you see the entirety of viruses,</p>
<p>maybe across different strains of viruses,</p>
<p>it seems like a living organism.</p>
<p>I am in awe of biology.</p>
<p>I find biology amazingly beautiful.</p>
<p>I find the design of the current coronavirus,</p>
<p>however lethal it is, amazingly beautiful.</p>
<p>The way that it is encoded,</p>
<p>the way that it tricks your cells</p>
<p>into making 30 proteins from a single RNA.</p>
<p>Human cells don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Human cells make one protein from each RNA molecule.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t make two, they make one.</p>
<p>We are hardwired to make only one protein</p>
<p>from every RNA molecule.</p>
<p>And yet this virus goes in,</p>
<p>throws in a single messenger RNA.</p>
<p>Just like any messenger RNA,</p>
<p>we have tens of thousands of messenger RNAs</p>
<p>in our cells in any one time.</p>
<p>In every one of our cells.</p>
<p>It throws in one RNA and that RNA is so,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna use your word here, not my word, intelligent.</p>
<p>That it hijacks the entire machinery of your human cell.</p>
<p>It basically has at the beginning,</p>
<p>a giant open reading frame.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a giant protein that gets translated.</p>
<p>Two thirds of that RNA make a single giant protein.</p>
<p>That single protein is basically</p>
<p>what a human cell would make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, here&rsquo;s a start code.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start translating here.</p>
<p>Human cells are kind of dumb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Again, this is not the words I would normally use.</p>
<p>But the human cell basically says,</p>
<p>oh, this is an RNA, must be mine.</p>
<p>Let me translate.</p>
<p>And it starts translating it.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because that one protein as it&rsquo;s growing,</p>
<p>gets cleaved into about 20 different peptides.</p>
<p>The first peptide and the second peptide start interacting</p>
<p>and the third one and the fourth one.</p>
<p>And they shut off the ribosome of the whole cell</p>
<p>to not translate human RNAs anymore.</p>
<p>So the virus basically hijacks your cells</p>
<p>and it cuts, it cleaves every one of your human RNAs</p>
<p>to basically say to the ribosome,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t translate this one, junk.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look at this one, junk.</p>
<p>And it only spares its own RNAs</p>
<p>because they have a particular mark that it spares.</p>
<p>Then all of the ribosomes that normally make protein</p>
<p>in your human cells are now only able</p>
<p>to translate viral RNAs.</p>
<p>And then more and more and more and more of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first 20 proteins.</p>
<p>In fact, halfway down about protein 11,</p>
<p>between 11 and 12,</p>
<p>you basically have a translational slippage</p>
<p>where the ribosome skips reading frame.</p>
<p>And it translates from one reading frame</p>
<p>to another reading frame.</p>
<p>That means that about half of them</p>
<p>are gonna be translated from one to 11.</p>
<p>And the other half are gonna be translated</p>
<p>from 12 to 16.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Then that mRNA will never translate the last 10 proteins</p>
<p>but spike is the one right after that one.</p>
<p>So how does spike even get translated?</p>
<p>This positive strand RNA virus has a reverse transcriptase</p>
<p>which is an RNA based reverse transcriptase.</p>
<p>So from the RNA on the positive strand,</p>
<p>it makes an RNA on the negative strand.</p>
<p>And in between every single one of these genes,</p>
<p>these open reading frames,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little signal AACGCA or something like that,</p>
<p>that basically loops over to the beginning of the RNA.</p>
<p>And basically instead of sort of having</p>
<p>a single full negative strand RNA,</p>
<p>it basically has a partial negative strand RNA</p>
<p>that ends right before the beginning of that gene.</p>
<p>And another one that ends right before</p>
<p>the beginning of that gene.</p>
<p>These negative strand RNAs now make positive strand RNAs</p>
<p>that then look to the human whole cell</p>
<p>just like any other human mRNA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ooh, great, I&rsquo;m gonna translate that one</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have the cleaving</p>
<p>that the virus has now put on all your human genes.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve lost the battle.</p>
<p>That cell is now only making proteins for the virus</p>
<p>that will then create the spike protein,</p>
<p>the envelope protein, the membrane protein,</p>
<p>the nucleocapsid protein that will package up the RNA</p>
<p>and then sort of create new viral envelopes.</p>
<p>And these will then be secreted out of that cell</p>
<p>in new little packages</p>
<p>that will then infect the rest of the cells.</p>
<p>Repeat the whole process again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mind boggling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to anthropomorphize it.</p>
<p>I know, but it&rsquo;s so gorgeous.</p>
<p>So there is a beauty to it.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Is it terrifying to you?</p>
<p>So this is something that has happened throughout history.</p>
<p>Humans have been nearly wiped out</p>
<p>over and over and over again,</p>
<p>and yet never fully wiped out.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m not concerned about the human race.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even concerned about the impact</p>
<p>on sort of our survival as a species.</p>
<p>This is absolutely something,</p>
<p>I mean, human life is so invaluable</p>
<p>and every one of us is so invaluable,</p>
<p>but if you think of it as sort of,</p>
<p>is this the end of our species?</p>
<p>By no means, basically.</p>
<p>So let me explain.</p>
<p>The Black Death killed what, 30% of Europe?</p>
<p>That has left a tremendous imprint,</p>
<p>a huge hole, a horrendous hole</p>
<p>in the genetic makeup of humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been series of wiping out of huge fractions</p>
<p>of entire species or just entire species altogether.</p>
<p>And that has a consequence on the human immune repertoire.</p>
<p>If you look at how Europe was shaped</p>
<p>and how Africa was shaped by malaria, for example,</p>
<p>all the individuals that carry a mutation</p>
<p>that protects you from malaria</p>
<p>were able to survive much more.</p>
<p>And if you look at the frequency of sickle cell disease</p>
<p>and the frequency of malaria,</p>
<p>the maps are actually showing the same pattern,</p>
<p>the same imprint on Africa.</p>
<p>And that basically led people to hypothesize</p>
<p>that the reason why sickle cell disease</p>
<p>is so much more frequent is because</p>
<p>sickle cell disease is so much more frequent</p>
<p>in Americans of African descent</p>
<p>is because there was selection in Africa against malaria</p>
<p>leading to sickle cell, because when the cells sickle,</p>
<p>malaria is not able to replicate inside your cells as well.</p>
<p>And therefore you protect against that.</p>
<p>So if you look at human disease,</p>
<p>all of the genetic associations that we do</p>
<p>with human disease,</p>
<p>you basically see the imprint</p>
<p>of these waves of selection killing off</p>
<p>gazillions of humans.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many immune processes that are coming up</p>
<p>as associated with so many different diseases.</p>
<p>The reason for that is similar</p>
<p>to what I was describing earlier,</p>
<p>where the outward facing proteins evolve much more rapidly</p>
<p>because the environment is always changing.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting in the human genome</p>
<p>is that we have coopted many of these immune genes</p>
<p>to carry out nonimmune functions.</p>
<p>For example, in our brain,</p>
<p>we use immune cells to cleave off neuronal connections</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t get used.</p>
<p>This whole use it or lose it, we know the mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s microglia that cleave off neuronal synaptic connections</p>
<p>that are just not utilized.</p>
<p>When you utilize them, you mark them in a particular way</p>
<p>that basically when the microglia come,</p>
<p>tell it, don&rsquo;t kill this one, it&rsquo;s used now.</p>
<p>And the microglia will go off</p>
<p>and kill the ones you don&rsquo;t use.</p>
<p>This is an immune function,</p>
<p>which is coopted to do nonimmune things.</p>
<p>If you look at our adipocytes,</p>
<p>M1 versus M2 macrophages inside our fat</p>
<p>will basically determine whether you&rsquo;re obese or not.</p>
<p>And these are again, immune cells that are resident</p>
<p>and living within these tissues.</p>
<p>So many disease associations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, that we coopt these kinds of things</p>
<p>for incredibly complicated functions.</p>
<p>Exactly, evolution works in so many different ways,</p>
<p>which are all beautiful and mysterious.</p>
<p>But not intelligent.</p>
<p>Not intelligent, it&rsquo;s in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>But the point that I&rsquo;m trying to make is that</p>
<p>if you look at the imprint that COVID will have,</p>
<p>hopefully it will not be big.</p>
<p>Hopefully the US will get attacked together</p>
<p>and stop the virus from spreading further.</p>
<p>But if it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s having an imprint</p>
<p>on individuals who have particular genetic repertoires.</p>
<p>So if you look at now the genetic associations</p>
<p>of blood type and immune function cells, et cetera,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually association, genetic variation</p>
<p>that basically says how much more likely am I or you to die</p>
<p>if we contact the virus.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s through these rounds of shaping the human genome</p>
<p>that humans have basically made it so far.</p>
<p>And selection is ruthless and it&rsquo;s brutal</p>
<p>and it only comes with a lot of killing.</p>
<p>But this is the way that viruses and environments</p>
<p>have shaped the human genome.</p>
<p>Basically, when you go through periods of famine,</p>
<p>you select for particular genes.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s left is not necessarily better,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just whatever survived.</p>
<p>And it might have been the surviving one back then,</p>
<p>not because it was better,</p>
<p>maybe the ones that ran slower survived.</p>
<p>I mean, again, not necessarily better,</p>
<p>but the surviving ones are basically the ones</p>
<p>that then are shaped for any kind</p>
<p>of subsequent evolutionary condition</p>
<p>and environmental condition.</p>
<p>But if you look at, for example, obesity,</p>
<p>obesity was selected for basically the genes</p>
<p>that now predisposes to obesity</p>
<p>were at 2% frequency in Africa.</p>
<p>They rose to 44% frequency in Europe.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Because you basically went through the ice ages</p>
<p>and there was a scarcity of food.</p>
<p>So there was a selection to being able to store</p>
<p>every single calorie you consume.</p>
<p>Eventually, environment changes.</p>
<p>So the better allele, which was the fat storing allele,</p>
<p>became the worst allele</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the fat storing allele.</p>
<p>It still has the same function.</p>
<p>So if you look at my genome, speaking of mom calling,</p>
<p>mom gave me a bad copy of that gene, this FTO locus.</p>
<p>Basically, makes me.</p>
<p>The one that has to do with.</p>
<p>Obesity.</p>
<p>With obesity.</p>
<p>Yeah, I basically now have a bad copy from mom</p>
<p>that makes me more likely to be obese.</p>
<p>And I also have a bad copy from dad</p>
<p>that makes me more likely to be obese.</p>
<p>So homozygous.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the allele, it&rsquo;s still the minor allele,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at 44% frequency in Southeast Asia,</p>
<p>42% frequency in Europe, even though it started at 2%.</p>
<p>It was an awesome allele to have 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s pretty terrible allele.</p>
<p>So the other concept is that diversity matters.</p>
<p>If we had 100 million nuclear physicists</p>
<p>living the earth right now, we&rsquo;d be in trouble.</p>
<p>You need diversity, you need artists</p>
<p>and you need musicians and you need mathematicians</p>
<p>and you need politicians, yes, even those.</p>
<p>And you need like.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s not get crazy.</p>
<p>But because then if a virus comes along or whatever.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So, no, there&rsquo;s two reasons.</p>
<p>Number one, you want diversity in the immune repertoire</p>
<p>and we have built in diversity.</p>
<p>So basically, they are the most diverse.</p>
<p>Basically, if you look at our immune system,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s layers and layers of diversity.</p>
<p>Like the way that you create your cells generates diversity</p>
<p>because of the selection for the VDJ recombination</p>
<p>that basically eventually leads</p>
<p>to a huge number of repertoires.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only one small component of diversity.</p>
<p>The blood type is another one.</p>
<p>The major histocompatibility complex, the HLA alleles</p>
<p>are another source of diversity.</p>
<p>So the immune system of humans is by nature,</p>
<p>incredibly diverse and that basically leads to resilience.</p>
<p>So basically what I&rsquo;m saying that I don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>for the human species because we are so diverse immunologically,</p>
<p>we are likely to be very resilient</p>
<p>against so many different attacks like this current virus.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying natural pandemics may not be something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really afraid of because of the diversity</p>
<p>in our genetic makeup.</p>
<p>What about engineered pandemics?</p>
<p>Do you have fears of us messing with the makeup of viruses</p>
<p>or well, yeah, let&rsquo;s say with the makeup of viruses</p>
<p>to create something that we can&rsquo;t control</p>
<p>and would be much more destructive</p>
<p>than it would come about naturally?</p>
<p>Remember how we were talking about how smart evolution is?</p>
<p>Humans are much dumber.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>You mean like human scientists, engineers?</p>
<p>Yeah, humans, humans just like.</p>
<p>Humans overall?</p>
<p>Yeah, humans overall.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I mean, even the sort of synthetic biologists</p>
<p>you know, basically if you were to create,</p>
<p>you know, virus like SARS that will kill a lot of people,</p>
<p>you would probably start with SARS.</p>
<p>So whoever, you know, would like to design such a thing</p>
<p>would basically start with a SARS tree</p>
<p>or at least some relative of SARS.</p>
<p>The source genome for the current virus</p>
<p>was something completely different.</p>
<p>It was something that has never infected anyone</p>
<p>and never infected humans.</p>
<p>No one in their right mind would have started there.</p>
<p>But when you say sources like the nearest.</p>
<p>The nearest relative.</p>
<p>Relative.</p>
<p>Is in a whole other branch.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>No species of which has ever infected humans</p>
<p>in that branch.</p>
<p>So, you know, let&rsquo;s put this to rest.</p>
<p>This was not designed by someone to kill off the human race.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t believe it was engineered?</p>
<p>The. Or likely.</p>
<p>Yeah, the path to engineering a deadly virus</p>
<p>did not come from this strain that was used.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&rsquo;s been various claims of,</p>
<p>ha ha, this was mixed and matched in lab</p>
<p>because the S1 protein has three different components,</p>
<p>each of which has a different evolutionary tree.</p>
<p>So, you know, a lot of popular press basically said,</p>
<p>aha, this came from pangolin</p>
<p>and this came from, you know, all kinds of other species.</p>
<p>This is what has been happening</p>
<p>throughout the coronavirus tree.</p>
<p>So basically the S1 protein has been recombining</p>
<p>across species all the time.</p>
<p>Remember when I was talking about the positive strand,</p>
<p>the negative strand, sub genomic RNAs,</p>
<p>these can actually recombine.</p>
<p>And if you have two different viruses</p>
<p>infecting the same cell,</p>
<p>they can actually mix and match</p>
<p>between the positive strand and the negative strand</p>
<p>and basically create a new hybrid virus with recombination</p>
<p>that now has the S1 from one</p>
<p>and the rest of the genome from another.</p>
<p>And this is something that happens a lot in S1,</p>
<p>in Orfet, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s true of the whole tree.</p>
<p>For the whole family of viruses.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like someone has been messing with this</p>
<p>for millions of years and, you know, changing.</p>
<p>This happens naturally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, again, beautiful that that somehow happens,</p>
<p>that they recombine.</p>
<p>So two different strands can infect the body</p>
<p>and then recombine.</p>
<p>So all of this actually magic happens inside hosts.</p>
<p>Like all, like.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why classification wise,</p>
<p>virus is not thought to be alive</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t self replicate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not autonomous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that enters a living cell</p>
<p>and then co ops it to basically make it its own.</p>
<p>But by itself, people ask me,</p>
<p>how do we kill this bastard?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you stop it from replicating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a bacterium that will just live</p>
<p>in a, you know, puddle or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a virus.</p>
<p>Viruses don&rsquo;t live without their host.</p>
<p>And they only live with their host for very little time.</p>
<p>So if you stop it from replicating,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll stop from spreading.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like HIV, which can stay dormant</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>Basically, coronaviruses just don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not integrating genomes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re RNA genomes.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s not expressed, it degrades.</p>
<p>RNA degrades.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just stick around.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask also about the immune system you mentioned.</p>
<p>A lot of people kind of ask, you know,</p>
<p>how can we strengthen the immune system</p>
<p>to respond to this particular virus,</p>
<p>but the viruses in general.</p>
<p>Do you have from a biological perspective,</p>
<p>thoughts on what we can do as humans</p>
<p>to strengthen our immune system?</p>
<p>If you look at the death rates across different countries,</p>
<p>people with less vaccination have been dying more.</p>
<p>If you look at North Italy,</p>
<p>the vaccination rates are abysmal there.</p>
<p>And a lot of people have been dying.</p>
<p>If you look at Greece, very good vaccination rates.</p>
<p>Almost no one has been dying.</p>
<p>So yes, there&rsquo;s a policy component.</p>
<p>So Italy reacted very slowly.</p>
<p>Greece reacted very fast.</p>
<p>So yeah, many fewer people died in Greece,</p>
<p>but there might actually be a component</p>
<p>of genetic immune repertoire.</p>
<p>Basically, how did people die off, you know,</p>
<p>in the history of the Greek population</p>
<p>versus the Italian population.</p>
<p>Wow. There&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting to think about.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a component</p>
<p>of what vaccinations did you have as a kid</p>
<p>and what are the off target effects of those vaccinations?</p>
<p>So basically a vaccination can have two components.</p>
<p>One is training your immune system</p>
<p>against that specific insult.</p>
<p>The second one is boosting up your immune system</p>
<p>for all kinds of other things.</p>
<p>If you look at allergies,</p>
<p>Northern Europe, super clean environments,</p>
<p>tons of allergies.</p>
<p>Southern Europe, my kids grew up eating dirt.</p>
<p>No allergies.</p>
<p>So growing up, I never had even heard of what allergies are.</p>
<p>Like, was it really allergies?</p>
<p>And the reason is that I was playing in the garden.</p>
<p>I was putting all kinds of stuff in my mouth from,</p>
<p>you know, all kinds of dirt and stuff,</p>
<p>tons of viruses there, tons of bacteria there.</p>
<p>You know, my immune system was built up.</p>
<p>So the more you protect your immune system from exposure,</p>
<p>the less opportunity it has to learn</p>
<p>about non self repertoire in a way that prepares it</p>
<p>for the next insult.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the horizontal thing too,</p>
<p>like the, so it&rsquo;s throughout your lifetime</p>
<p>and the lifetime of the people that, your ancestors,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>What about the&hellip;</p>
<p>So again, it returns against free will.</p>
<p>On the free will side of things,</p>
<p>is there something we could do</p>
<p>to strengthen our immune system in 2020?</p>
<p>Is there like, you know, exercise, diet,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cartoon that basically shows two windows</p>
<p>with a teller in each window.</p>
<p>One has a humongous line and the other one has no one.</p>
<p>The one that has no one above says health.</p>
<p>No, it says exercise and diet.</p>
<p>And the other one says pill.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge line for pill.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking basically for magic bullets</p>
<p>for sort of ways that we can, you know,</p>
<p>beat cancer and beat coronavirus and beat this</p>
<p>and beat that.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the window with like,</p>
<p>just diet and exercise is the best way</p>
<p>to boost every aspect of your health.</p>
<p>If you look at Alzheimer&rsquo;s, exercise and nutrition.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re like, really?</p>
<p>For my brain, neurodegeneration?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>If you look at cancer, exercise and nutrition.</p>
<p>If you look at coronavirus, exercise and nutrition,</p>
<p>every single aspect of human health gets improved.</p>
<p>And one of the studies we&rsquo;re doing now</p>
<p>is basically looking at what are the effects</p>
<p>of diet and exercise?</p>
<p>How similar are they to each other?</p>
<p>We basically take in diet intervention</p>
<p>and exercise intervention in human and in mice.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re basically doing single cell profiling</p>
<p>of a bunch of different tissues</p>
<p>to basically understand how are the cells,</p>
<p>both the stromal cells and the immune cells</p>
<p>of each of these tissues responding</p>
<p>to the effect of exercise.</p>
<p>What are the communication networks</p>
<p>between different cells?</p>
<p>Where the muscle that exercises sends signals</p>
<p>through the bloodstream, through the lymphatic system,</p>
<p>through all kinds of other systems</p>
<p>that give signals to other cells that I have exercised</p>
<p>and you should change in this particular way,</p>
<p>which basically reconfigure those receptor cells</p>
<p>with the effect of exercise.</p>
<p>How well understood is those reconfigurations?</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just starting now, basically.</p>
<p>Is the hope there to understand the effect on,</p>
<p>so like the effect on the immune system?</p>
<p>On the immune system, the effect on brain,</p>
<p>the effect on your liver, on your digestive system,</p>
<p>on your adipocytes?</p>
<p>Adipose, the most misunderstood organ.</p>
<p>Everybody thinks, oh, fat, terrible.</p>
<p>No, fat is awesome.</p>
<p>Your fat cells is what&rsquo;s keeping you alive</p>
<p>because if you didn&rsquo;t have your fat cells,</p>
<p>all those lipids and all those calories</p>
<p>would be floating around in your blood</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be dead by now.</p>
<p>Your adipocytes are your best friend.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically storing all these excess calories</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t hurt all of the rest of the body.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also fat burning in many ways.</p>
<p>So, again, when you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the homozygous version that I have,</p>
<p>your cells are able to burn calories much more easily</p>
<p>by sort of flipping a master metabolic switch</p>
<p>that involves this FTO locus that I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>and its target genes, RX3 and RX5,</p>
<p>that basically switch your adipocytes</p>
<p>during their three first days of differentiation</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re becoming mature adipocytes</p>
<p>to basically become either fat burning</p>
<p>or fat storing fat cells.</p>
<p>And the fat burning fat cells are your best friend.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much closer to muscle</p>
<p>than they are to white adipocytes.</p>
<p>Is there a lot of difference between people</p>
<p>that you could give, science could eventually give advice</p>
<p>that is very generalizable</p>
<p>or is our differences in our genetic makeup,</p>
<p>like you mentioned, is that going to be basically</p>
<p>something we have to be very specialized individuals,</p>
<p>any advice we give in terms of diet,</p>
<p>like what we were just talking about?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the most personalized advice</p>
<p>that you give for nutrition</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to do with your genome.</p>
<p>They have to do with your gut microbiome,</p>
<p>with the bacteria that live inside you.</p>
<p>So most of your digestion is actually happening</p>
<p>by species that are not human inside you.</p>
<p>You have more nonhuman cells than you have human cells.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically a giant bag of bacteria</p>
<p>with a few human cells along.</p>
<p>And those do not necessarily have to do</p>
<p>with your genetic makeup.</p>
<p>They interact with your genetic makeup.</p>
<p>They interact with your epigenome.</p>
<p>They interact with your nutrition.</p>
<p>They interact with your environment.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically an additional source of variation.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re thinking about sort of</p>
<p>personalized nutritional advice,</p>
<p>part of that is actually how do you match your microbiome?</p>
<p>And part of that is how do we match your genetics?</p>
<p>But again, this is a very diverse set of contributors.</p>
<p>And the effect sizes are not enormous.</p>
<p>So I think the science for that is not fully developed yet.</p>
<p>Speaking of diets,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve wrestled in combat sports,</p>
<p>but sports my whole life were weight matters.</p>
<p>So you have to cut and all that stuff.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about my body,</p>
<p>and it seems to be, I think,</p>
<p>true about other people&rsquo;s bodies,</p>
<p>is that you can adjust to a lot of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the miraculous thing about this biological system,</p>
<p>is like I fast often.</p>
<p>I used to eat like five, six times a day</p>
<p>and thought that was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>How could you not eat that often?</p>
<p>And then when I started fasting,</p>
<p>your body adjusted to that.</p>
<p>And you learn how to not eat.</p>
<p>And it was, if you just give it a chance</p>
<p>for a few weeks, actually,</p>
<p>over a period of a few weeks,</p>
<p>your body can adjust to anything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a miraculous, that&rsquo;s such a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a computer scientist,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve basically gone through periods of 24 hours</p>
<p>without eating or stopping.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, oh, must eat.</p>
<p>And I eat a ton.</p>
<p>I used to order two pizzas just with my brother.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve gone through these extremes as well,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve gone the whole intermittent fasting thing.</p>
<p>So I can sympathize with you both on the seven meals a day</p>
<p>to the zero meals a day.</p>
<p>So I think when I say everything with moderation,</p>
<p>I actually think your body responds interestingly</p>
<p>to these different changes in diet.</p>
<p>I think part of the reason why we lose weight</p>
<p>with pretty much every kind of change in behavior</p>
<p>is because our epigenome and the set of proteins</p>
<p>and enzymes that are expressed and our microbiome</p>
<p>are not well suited to that nutritional source.</p>
<p>And therefore, they will not be able</p>
<p>to sort of catch everything that you give them.</p>
<p>And then a lot of that will go undigested.</p>
<p>And that basically means that your body can then</p>
<p>lose weight in the short term,</p>
<p>but very quickly will adjust to that new normal.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll be able to sort of perhaps gain</p>
<p>a lot of weight from the diet.</p>
<p>So anyway, I mean, there&rsquo;s also studies in factories</p>
<p>where basically people dim the lights</p>
<p>and then suddenly everybody started working better.</p>
<p>It was like, wow, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, they made the lights a little brighter.</p>
<p>Everybody started working better.</p>
<p>So any kind of intervention has a placebo effect of,</p>
<p>wow, now I&rsquo;m healthier and I&rsquo;m gonna be running</p>
<p>more often, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to uncouple the placebo effect</p>
<p>of, wow, I&rsquo;m doing something to intervene on my diet</p>
<p>from the, wow, this is actually the right thing for me.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, from the perspective from a nutrition science,</p>
<p>psychology, both things I&rsquo;m interested in,</p>
<p>especially psychology, it seems that it&rsquo;s extremely difficult</p>
<p>to do good science because there&rsquo;s so many variables</p>
<p>involved, it&rsquo;s so difficult to control the variables,</p>
<p>so difficult to do sufficiently large scale experiments,</p>
<p>both sort of in terms of the number of subjects</p>
<p>and temporal, like how long you do the study for,</p>
<p>that it just seems like it&rsquo;s not even a real science</p>
<p>for now, like nutrition science.</p>
<p>I wanna jump into the whole placebo effect</p>
<p>for a little bit here.</p>
<p>And basically talk about the implications of that.</p>
<p>If I give you a sugar pill and I tell you it&rsquo;s a sugar pill,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t get any better.</p>
<p>But if I tell you a sugar pill and I tell you,</p>
<p>wow, this is an amazing drug,</p>
<p>it actually will stop your cancer,</p>
<p>your cancer will actually stop with much higher probability.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so amazing.</p>
<p>That means that if I can trick your brain</p>
<p>into thinking that I&rsquo;m healing you,</p>
<p>your brain will basically figure out a way to heal itself,</p>
<p>to heal the body.</p>
<p>And that tells us that there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t understand in the interplay</p>
<p>between our cognition and our biology,</p>
<p>that if we were able to better harvest</p>
<p>the power of our brain to sort of impact the body</p>
<p>through the placebo effect,</p>
<p>we would be so much better in so many different things.</p>
<p>Just by tricking yourself into thinking</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing better, you&rsquo;re actually doing better.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something to be said</p>
<p>about sort of positive thinking, about optimism,</p>
<p>about sort of just getting your brain</p>
<p>and your mind into the right mindset</p>
<p>that helps your body and helps your entire biology.</p>
<p>Yeah, from a science perspective, that&rsquo;s just fascinating.</p>
<p>Obviously most things about the brain</p>
<p>is a total mystery for now,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a fascinating interplay</p>
<p>that the brain can help cure cancer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what to do with that.</p>
<p>I mean, the way to think about that is the following.</p>
<p>The converse of the equation is something</p>
<p>that we are much more comfortable with.</p>
<p>Like, oh, if you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>then your heart rate might rise</p>
<p>and all kinds of sort of toxins might be released</p>
<p>and that can have a detrimental effect in your body,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s easier to understand your body</p>
<p>healing from your mind</p>
<p>by your mind is not killing your body,</p>
<p>or at least it&rsquo;s killing it less.</p>
<p>So I think that aspect of the stress equation</p>
<p>is a little easier for most of us to conceptualize,</p>
<p>but then the healing part is perhaps the same pathways,</p>
<p>perhaps different pathways,</p>
<p>but again, something that is totally untapped scientifically.</p>
<p>I think we try to bring this question up a couple of times,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s return to it again,</p>
<p>is what do you think is the difference</p>
<p>between the way a computer represents information,</p>
<p>the human genome represents and stores information?</p>
<p>And maybe broadly, what is the difference</p>
<p>between how you think about computers</p>
<p>and how you think about biological systems?</p>
<p>So I made a very provocative claim earlier</p>
<p>that we are a digital computer.</p>
<p>Like I said, at the core lies a digital code</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s true in many ways,</p>
<p>but surrounding that digital core,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge amount of analog.</p>
<p>If you look at our brain, it&rsquo;s not really digital.</p>
<p>If you look at our sort of RNA</p>
<p>and all of that stuff inside our cell,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really digital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really analog in many ways,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s start with the code</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll expand to the rest.</p>
<p>So the code itself is digital.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s genes.</p>
<p>You can think of the genes as, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the procedures, the functions inside your language.</p>
<p>And then somehow you have to turn these functions on.</p>
<p>How do you call a gene?</p>
<p>How do you call that function?</p>
<p>The way that you would do it in old programming languages</p>
<p>is go to address whatever in your memory</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d start running from there.</p>
<p>And modern programming languages</p>
<p>have encapsulated this into functions</p>
<p>and objects and all of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice and cute, but in the end, deep down,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still an assembly code</p>
<p>that says go to that instruction</p>
<p>and it runs that instruction.</p>
<p>If you look at the human genome</p>
<p>and the genome of pretty much most species out there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no go to function.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t start transcribing in position 13,000,</p>
<p>13,527 in chromosome 12.</p>
<p>You instead have content based indexing.</p>
<p>So at every location in the genome,</p>
<p>in front of the genes that need to be turned on,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, when you drink coffee,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little coffee marker in front of all of them.</p>
<p>And whenever your cells that metabolize coffee</p>
<p>need to metabolize coffee,</p>
<p>they basically see coffee and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ooh, let&rsquo;s go turn on all the coffee marked genes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s basically these small motifs,</p>
<p>these small sequences that we call regulatory motifs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like patterns of DNA.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only eight characters long or so,</p>
<p>like GAT, GCA, et cetera.</p>
<p>And these motifs work in combinations</p>
<p>and every one of them has some recruitment affinity</p>
<p>for a different protein that will then come and bind it</p>
<p>and together collections of these motifs</p>
<p>create regions that we call regulatory regions</p>
<p>that can be either promoters near the beginning of the gene</p>
<p>and that basically tells you</p>
<p>where the function actually starts, where you call it,</p>
<p>and then enhancers that are looping around of the DNA</p>
<p>that basically bring the machinery</p>
<p>that binds those enhancers</p>
<p>and then bring it onto the promoter,</p>
<p>which then recruits the right sort of the ribosome</p>
<p>and the polymerase and all of that thing,</p>
<p>which will first transcribe and then export</p>
<p>and then eventually translate in the cytoplasm,</p>
<p>you know, whatever RNA molecule.</p>
<p>So the beauty of the way</p>
<p>that the digital computer that&rsquo;s the genome works</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s extremely fault tolerant.</p>
<p>If I took your hard drive</p>
<p>and I messed with 20% of the letters in it,</p>
<p>of the zeros and ones and I flipped them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be in trouble.</p>
<p>If I take the genome and I flipped 20% of the letters,</p>
<p>you probably won&rsquo;t even notice.</p>
<p>And that resilience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating, yeah.</p>
<p>Is a key design principle.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m anthropomorphizing here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a key driving principle</p>
<p>of how biological systems work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re first resilient and then anything else.</p>
<p>And when you look at this incredible beauty of life</p>
<p>from the most, I don&rsquo;t know, beautiful,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, human genome maybe of humanity</p>
<p>and all of the ideals that should come with it</p>
<p>to the most terrifying genome,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, COVID 19, SARS COVID 2</p>
<p>and the current pandemic,</p>
<p>you basically see this elegance</p>
<p>as the epitome of clean design,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s dirty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, the way to get there is hugely messy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that we as computer scientists</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t embrace.</p>
<p>We like to have clean code.</p>
<p>You know, like in engineering,</p>
<p>they teach you about compartmentalization,</p>
<p>about sort of separating functions,</p>
<p>about modularity, about hierarchical design.</p>
<p>None of that applies in biology.</p>
<p>Testing.</p>
<p>Testing, sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, biology does plenty of that.</p>
<p>But I mean, through evolutionary exploration.</p>
<p>But if you look at biological systems,</p>
<p>first they are robust</p>
<p>and then they specialize to become anything else.</p>
<p>And if you look at viruses,</p>
<p>the reason why they&rsquo;re so elegant</p>
<p>when you look at the design of this, you know, genome,</p>
<p>it seems so elegant.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that it&rsquo;s been stripped down</p>
<p>from something much larger</p>
<p>because of the pressure to keep it compact.</p>
<p>So many compact genomes out there</p>
<p>have ancestors that were much larger.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t start small and become big.</p>
<p>You go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff,</p>
<p>increase complexity, and then, you know, slim it down.</p>
<p>And one of my early papers was in fact on genome duplication.</p>
<p>One of the things we found is that baker&rsquo;s yeast,</p>
<p>which is the, you know, yeast that you use to make bread,</p>
<p>but also the yeast that you use to make wine,</p>
<p>which is basically the dominant species</p>
<p>when you go in the fields of Tuscany</p>
<p>and you say, you know, what&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically saccharomyces cerevisiae,</p>
<p>or the way my Italian friends say,</p>
<p>saccharomyces cerevisiae.</p>
<p>So, so.</p>
<p>Oh, which means what?</p>
<p>Oh, saccharomyces, okay, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m Greek.</p>
<p>So yeah, zacharo, mikis, zacharo is sugar,</p>
<p>mikis is fungus.</p>
<p>Yes, cerevisiae, cerveza, beer.</p>
<p>So it means the sugar fungus of beer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, less, less sounding to the ear.</p>
<p>Still poetic, yeah.</p>
<p>So anyway, saccharomyces cerevisiae,</p>
<p>basically the major baker&rsquo;s yeast out there</p>
<p>is the descendant of a whole genome duplication.</p>
<p>Why would a whole gene duplication even happen?</p>
<p>When it happened is coinciding</p>
<p>with about a hundred million years ago</p>
<p>and the emergence of fruit bearing plants.</p>
<p>Why fruit bearing plants?</p>
<p>Because animals would eat the fruit</p>
<p>and would walk around and poop huge amounts of nutrients</p>
<p>along with a seed for the plants to spread.</p>
<p>Before that, plants were not spreading through animals,</p>
<p>they were spreading through wind</p>
<p>and all kinds of other ways.</p>
<p>But basically the moment you have fruit bearing plants,</p>
<p>these plants are basically creating this abundance</p>
<p>of sugar in the environment.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an evolutionary niche that gets created.</p>
<p>And in that evolutionary niche,</p>
<p>you basically have enough sugar</p>
<p>that a whole genome duplication,</p>
<p>which initially is a very messy event,</p>
<p>allows you to then, you know,</p>
<p>relieve some of that complexity.</p>
<p>So I had to pause, what does genome duplication mean?</p>
<p>That basically means that instead of having eight chromosomes,</p>
<p>you can now have 16 chromosomes.</p>
<p>So, but the duplication at first,</p>
<p>when you go to 16, you&rsquo;re not using that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, so basically from one day to the next,</p>
<p>you went from having eight chromosomes</p>
<p>to having 16 chromosomes.</p>
<p>Probably a non disjunction event during a duplication,</p>
<p>during a division.</p>
<p>So you basically divide the cell</p>
<p>instead of half the genome going this way</p>
<p>and half the genome going the other way</p>
<p>after duplication of the genome,</p>
<p>you basically have all of it going to one cell</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s sufficient messiness there</p>
<p>that you end up with slight differences</p>
<p>that make most of these chromosomes</p>
<p>be actually preserved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long story short to me.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a big upgrade, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Not necessarily,</p>
<p>because what happens immediately thereafter</p>
<p>is that you start massively losing</p>
<p>tons of those duplicated genes.</p>
<p>So 90% of those genes were actually lost</p>
<p>very rapidly after whole gene duplication.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that biology is not intelligent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just ruthless selection, random mutation.</p>
<p>So the ruthless selection basically means</p>
<p>that as soon as one of the random mutations hit one gene,</p>
<p>ruthless selection just kills off that gene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>if you have a pressure to maintain a small compact genome,</p>
<p>you will very rapidly lose the second copy</p>
<p>of most of your genes and a small number 10%</p>
<p>were kept in two copies.</p>
<p>And those had to do a lot with environment adaptation,</p>
<p>with the speed of replication,</p>
<p>with the speed of translation and with sugar processing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m making a long story short</p>
<p>to basically say that evolution is messy.</p>
<p>The only way&hellip;</p>
<p>Like, so the example that I was giving</p>
<p>of messing with 20% of your bits in your computer,</p>
<p>totally bogus.</p>
<p>Duplicating all your functions</p>
<p>and just throwing them out there in the same function,</p>
<p>just totally bogus.</p>
<p>Like this would never work in an engineer system.</p>
<p>But biological systems,</p>
<p>because of this content based indexing</p>
<p>and because of this modularity that comes</p>
<p>from the fact that the gene is controlled</p>
<p>by a series of tags.</p>
<p>And now if you need this gene in another setting,</p>
<p>you just add some more tags</p>
<p>that will basically turn it on also in those settings.</p>
<p>So this gene is now pressured to do two different functions</p>
<p>and it builds up complexity.</p>
<p>I see a whole gene duplication</p>
<p>and gene duplication in general</p>
<p>as a way to relieve that complexity.</p>
<p>So you have this gradual buildup of complexity</p>
<p>as functions get sort of added onto the existing genes.</p>
<p>And then boom, you duplicate your workforce.</p>
<p>And you now have two copies of this gene.</p>
<p>One will probably specialize to do one</p>
<p>and the other one will specialize to do the other</p>
<p>or one will maintain the ancestral function.</p>
<p>The other one will sort of be free to evolve</p>
<p>and specialize while losing the ancestral function</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how genomes evolve.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just messy things,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re extremely fault tolerant</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re extremely able to deal with mutations</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the very way that you generate new functions.</p>
<p>So new functionalization comes</p>
<p>from the very thing that breaks it.</p>
<p>So even in the current pandemic,</p>
<p>many people are asking me which mutations matter the most.</p>
<p>And what I tell them is,</p>
<p>well, we can study the evolutionary dynamics</p>
<p>of the current genome to then understand</p>
<p>which mutations have previously happened or not.</p>
<p>And which mutations happen in genes</p>
<p>that evolve rapidly or not.</p>
<p>And one of the things we found, for example,</p>
<p>is that the genes that evolved rapidly in the past</p>
<p>are still evolving rapidly now in the current pandemic.</p>
<p>The genes that evolved slowly in the past</p>
<p>are still evolving slowly.</p>
<p>Which means that they&rsquo;re useful?</p>
<p>Which means that they&rsquo;re under</p>
<p>the same evolutionary pressures.</p>
<p>But then the question is what happens in specific mutations?</p>
<p>So if you look at the D614 gene mutations,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been all over the news.</p>
<p>So in position 614, in the amino acids 614 of the S protein,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a D2 gene mutation</p>
<p>that sort of has creeped over the population.</p>
<p>That mutation, we found out through my work,</p>
<p>disrupts a perfectly conserved nucleotide position</p>
<p>that has never been changed in the history</p>
<p>of millions of years of equivalent</p>
<p>per million evolution of these viruses.</p>
<p>That basically means that it&rsquo;s a completely new adaptation</p>
<p>to human.</p>
<p>And that mutation has now gone from 1% frequency</p>
<p>to 90% frequency in almost all outbreaks.</p>
<p>So this mutation, I like how you say the 416,</p>
<p>what was it, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, 614, sorry.</p>
<p>614.</p>
<p>D614G.</p>
<p>D614, so literally, so what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is this is like a chess move.</p>
<p>So it just mutated one letter to another.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that hasn&rsquo;t happened before.</p>
<p>Yeah, never.</p>
<p>And this somehow, this mutation is really useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really useful in the current environment of the genome,</p>
<p>which is moving from human to human.</p>
<p>When it was moving from bat to bat,</p>
<p>it couldn&rsquo;t care less for that mutation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s environment specific.</p>
<p>So now that it&rsquo;s moving from human to human,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s moving way better, like by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>What do you, okay, so you&rsquo;re like tracking</p>
<p>this evolutionary dynamics, which is fascinating,</p>
<p>but what do you do with that?</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>What does this mean, what do you make,</p>
<p>what do you make of this mutation</p>
<p>in trying to anticipate, I guess,</p>
<p>is one of the things you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is anticipate where, how this unrolls into the future,</p>
<p>this evolutionary dynamics.</p>
<p>Such a great question.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>Remember when I was saying earlier,</p>
<p>mutation is the path to new things,</p>
<p>but also the path to break old things.</p>
<p>So what we know is that this position</p>
<p>was extremely preserved through gazillions of mutations.</p>
<p>That mutation was never tolerated</p>
<p>when it was moving from bats to bats.</p>
<p>So that basically means that that position</p>
<p>is extremely important in the function of that protein.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing it tells.</p>
<p>The second one is that that position</p>
<p>was very well suited to bat transmission,</p>
<p>but now is not well suited to human transmission,</p>
<p>so it got rid of it.</p>
<p>And it now has a new version of that amino acid</p>
<p>that basically makes it much easier</p>
<p>to transmit from human to human.</p>
<p>So in terms of the evolutionary history</p>
<p>teaching us about the future,</p>
<p>it basically tells us here&rsquo;s the regions</p>
<p>that are currently mutating.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the regions that are most likely</p>
<p>to mutate going forward.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re building a vaccine,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you should be focusing on</p>
<p>in terms of the most stable regions</p>
<p>that are the least likely to mutate.</p>
<p>Or here&rsquo;s the newly evolved functions</p>
<p>that are the most likely to be important</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve overcome this local maximum</p>
<p>that it had reached in the bat transmission.</p>
<p>So anyway, it&rsquo;s a tangent to basically say</p>
<p>that evolution works in messy ways.</p>
<p>And the thing that you would break</p>
<p>is the thing that actually allows you</p>
<p>to first go through a lull</p>
<p>and then reaching new local maximum.</p>
<p>And I often like to say that if engineers</p>
<p>had basically designed evolution,</p>
<p>we would still be perfectly replicating bacteria</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s my making the bacterium worse</p>
<p>that you allow evolution to reach a new optimum.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, just to pause on that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so profound.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so profound for the entirety</p>
<p>of this scientific and engineering disciplines.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We as engineers need to embrace breaking things.</p>
<p>We as engineers need to embrace robustness</p>
<p>as the first principle beyond perfection</p>
<p>because nothing&rsquo;s gonna ever be perfect.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re sending a satellite to Mars,</p>
<p>when something goes wrong, it&rsquo;ll break down.</p>
<p>As opposed to building systems that tolerate failure</p>
<p>and are resilient to that.</p>
<p>And in fact, get better through that.</p>
<p>So the SpaceX approach versus NASA for the&hellip;</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p>Is there something we can learn about the incredible,</p>
<p>take lessons from the incredible biological systems</p>
<p>in their resilience, in the mushiness, the messiness</p>
<p>to our computing systems, to our computers?</p>
<p>It would basically be starting from scratch in many ways.</p>
<p>It would basically be building new paradigms</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t try to get the right answer all the time,</p>
<p>but try to get the right answer most of the time</p>
<p>or a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Do you see deep learning systems in the whole world</p>
<p>of machine learning as kind of taking a step</p>
<p>in that direction?</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Basically by allowing this much more natural evolution</p>
<p>of these parameters, you basically&hellip;</p>
<p>And if you look at sort of deep learning systems again,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not inspired by the genome aspect of biology,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re inspired by the brain aspect of biology.</p>
<p>And again, I want you to pause for a second</p>
<p>and realize the complexity of the entire human brain</p>
<p>with trillions of connections within our neurons,</p>
<p>with millions of cells talking to each other,</p>
<p>is still encoded within that same genome.</p>
<p>That same genome encodes every single freaking cell type</p>
<p>of the entire body.</p>
<p>Every single cell is encoded by the same code.</p>
<p>And yet specialization allows you to have</p>
<p>the single viral like genome that self replicates,</p>
<p>the single module, modular automaton,</p>
<p>work with other copies of itself, it&rsquo;s mind boggling.</p>
<p>Create complex organs through which blood flows.</p>
<p>And what is that blood?</p>
<p>The same freaking genome.</p>
<p>Create organs that communicate with each other.</p>
<p>And what are these organs?</p>
<p>The exact same genome.</p>
<p>Create a brain that is innervated by massive amounts</p>
<p>of blood pumping energy to it,</p>
<p>20% of our energetic needs to the brain from the same genome.</p>
<p>And all of the neuronal connections,</p>
<p>all of the auxiliary cells, all of the immune cells,</p>
<p>the astrocytes, the ligodendrocytes, the neurons,</p>
<p>the excitatory, the inhibitory neurons,</p>
<p>all of the different classes of parasites,</p>
<p>the blood brain barrier, all of that, same genome.</p>
<p>One way to see that in a sad, this one is beautiful.</p>
<p>The sad thing is thinking about the trillions</p>
<p>of organisms that died to create that.</p>
<p>You mean on the evolutionary path to humans?</p>
<p>On the evolutionary path to humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy, there&rsquo;s two descendant of apes</p>
<p>just talking on a podcast.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s just so mind boggling.</p>
<p>Just to boggle our minds a little bit more.</p>
<p>Us talking to each other,</p>
<p>we are basically generating a series of vocal utterances</p>
<p>through our pulsating of vocal cords received through this.</p>
<p>The people who listen to this</p>
<p>are taking a completely different path</p>
<p>to that information transfer, yet through language.</p>
<p>But imagine if we could connect these brains</p>
<p>directly to each other.</p>
<p>The amount of information that I&rsquo;m condensing</p>
<p>into a small number of words is a huge funnel,</p>
<p>which then you receive and you expand</p>
<p>into a huge number of thoughts from that small funnel.</p>
<p>In many ways, engineers would love</p>
<p>to have the whole information transfer,</p>
<p>just take the whole set of neurons and throw them away.</p>
<p>I mean, throw them to the other person.</p>
<p>This might actually not be better</p>
<p>because in your misinterpretation</p>
<p>of every word that I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>you are creating new interpretation</p>
<p>that might actually be way better</p>
<p>than what I meant in the first place.</p>
<p>The ambiguity of language perhaps</p>
<p>might be the secret to creativity.</p>
<p>Every single time you work on a project by yourself,</p>
<p>you only bounce ideas with one person</p>
<p>and your neurons are basically fully cognizant</p>
<p>of what these ideas are.</p>
<p>But the moment you interact with another person,</p>
<p>the misinterpretations that happen</p>
<p>might be the most creative part of the process.</p>
<p>With my students, every time we have a research meeting,</p>
<p>I very often pause and say,</p>
<p>let me repeat what you just said in a different way.</p>
<p>And I sort of go on and brainstorm</p>
<p>with what they were saying,</p>
<p>but by the third time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not what they were saying at all.</p>
<p>And when they pick up what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, oh, well, dah, dah, dah.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;ve sort of learned something very different</p>
<p>from what I was saying.</p>
<p>And that is the same kind of messiness</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m describing in the genome itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of embracing the messiness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a feature, not a book.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And in the same way, when you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about sort of these deep learning systems</p>
<p>that will allow us to sort of be more creative perhaps</p>
<p>or learn better approximations of these complex functions,</p>
<p>again, tuned to the universe that we inhabit,</p>
<p>you have to embrace the breaking.</p>
<p>You have to embrace the,</p>
<p>how do we get out of these local optima?</p>
<p>And a lot of the design paradigms</p>
<p>that have made deep learning so successful</p>
<p>are ways to get away from that,</p>
<p>ways to get better training</p>
<p>by sort of sending long range messages,</p>
<p>these LSTM models and the sort of feed forward loops</p>
<p>that sort of jump through layers</p>
<p>of a convolutional neural network.</p>
<p>All of these things are basically ways to push you out</p>
<p>of these local maxima.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of what evolution does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what language does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what conversation and brainstorming does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what our brain does.</p>
<p>So this design paradigm is something that&rsquo;s pervasive</p>
<p>and yet not taught in schools,</p>
<p>not taught in engineering schools</p>
<p>where everything&rsquo;s minutely modularized</p>
<p>to make sure that we never deviate</p>
<p>from whatever signal we&rsquo;re trying to emit</p>
<p>as opposed to let all hell breaks loose</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the path to paradise.</p>
<p>The path to paradise.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult to know how to teach that</p>
<p>and what to do with it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult to know how to build up</p>
<p>the scientific method around messiness.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not all messiness.</p>
<p>We need some cleanness.</p>
<p>And going back to the example with Mars,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the place where I want</p>
<p>to sort of moderate error as much as possible</p>
<p>and sort of control the environment as much as possible.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re trying to repopulate Mars,</p>
<p>well, maybe messiness is a good thing then.</p>
<p>On that, you quickly mentioned this</p>
<p>in terms of us using our vocal cords</p>
<p>to speak on a podcast.</p>
<p>So Elon Musk and Neuralink are working</p>
<p>on trying to plug, as per our discussion</p>
<p>with computers and biological systems,</p>
<p>to connect the two.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to connect our brain to a computer</p>
<p>to create a brain computer interface</p>
<p>where they can communicate back and forth.</p>
<p>On this line of thinking, do you think this is possible</p>
<p>to bridge the gap between our engineered computing systems</p>
<p>and the messy biological systems?</p>
<p>My answer would be absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s no doubt that we can understand</p>
<p>more and more about what goes on in the brain</p>
<p>and we can sort of train the brain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember the Palm Pilot.</p>
<p>Yeah, Palm Pilot, yeah.</p>
<p>Remember this whole sort of alphabet that they had created?</p>
<p>Am I thinking of the same thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, you had a little pen</p>
<p>and for every character, you had a little scribble</p>
<p>that was unique that the machine could understand.</p>
<p>And that instead of trying the machine</p>
<p>and trying to teach the machine</p>
<p>to recognize human characters,</p>
<p>you had basically, they figured out</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s better and easier to train humans</p>
<p>to create human like characters</p>
<p>that the machine is better at recognizing.</p>
<p>So in the same way, I think what will happen</p>
<p>is that humans will be trained</p>
<p>to be able to create the mind pattern</p>
<p>that the machine will respond to</p>
<p>before the machine truly comprehends our thoughts.</p>
<p>So the first human brain interfaces</p>
<p>will be tricking humans to speak the machine language</p>
<p>where with the right set of electrodes,</p>
<p>I can sort of trick my brain into doing this.</p>
<p>And this is the same way that many people teach,</p>
<p>like learn to control artificial limbs.</p>
<p>You basically try a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>and eventually you figure out how your limbs work.</p>
<p>That might not be very different</p>
<p>from how humans learn to use their natural limbs</p>
<p>when they first grow up.</p>
<p>Basically, you have these, you know,</p>
<p>neoteny period of, you know,</p>
<p>this puddle of soup inside your brain,</p>
<p>trying to figure out how to even make neural connections</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re born and then learning sounds</p>
<p>in utero of, you know, all kinds of echoes</p>
<p>and, you know, eventually getting out in the real world.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen newborns,</p>
<p>but they just stare around a lot.</p>
<p>You know, one way to think about this</p>
<p>as a machine learning person is,</p>
<p>oh, they&rsquo;re just training their edge detectors.</p>
<p>And eventually they figure out</p>
<p>how to train their edge detectors.</p>
<p>They work through the second layer of the visual cortex</p>
<p>and the third layer and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And you basically have this learning</p>
<p>how to control your limbs</p>
<p>that probably comes at the same time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sort of, you know, throwing random things there</p>
<p>and you realize that, oh, wow,</p>
<p>when I do this thing, my limb moves.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do the following experiment.</p>
<p>Take a breath.</p>
<p>What muscles did you flex?</p>
<p>Now take another breath and think what muscles do I flex?</p>
<p>The first thing that you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re taking a breath</p>
<p>is the impact that it has on your lungs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, I&rsquo;m now gonna increase my lungs</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not gonna bring air in.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re actually doing</p>
<p>is just changing your diaphragm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not conscious, of course.</p>
<p>You never think of the diaphragm as a thing.</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the same reason</p>
<p>why I think of moving my finger</p>
<p>when I actually move my finger.</p>
<p>I think of the effect instead of actually thinking</p>
<p>of whatever muscle is twitching</p>
<p>that actually causes my finger to move.</p>
<p>So we basically in our first years of life</p>
<p>build up this massive lookup table</p>
<p>between whatever neuronal firing we do</p>
<p>and whatever action happens in our body that we control.</p>
<p>If you have a kid grow up with a third limb,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll figure out how to control them</p>
<p>probably at the same rate as their natural limbs.</p>
<p>And a lot of the work would be done by the&hellip;</p>
<p>If a third limb is a computer,</p>
<p>you kind of have a, not a faith, but a thought</p>
<p>that the brain might be able to figure out&hellip;</p>
<p>The plasticity would come from the brain.</p>
<p>The brain would be cleverer than the machine at first.</p>
<p>When I talk about a third limb,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m saying, an artificial limb</p>
<p>that basically just controls your mouse while you&rsquo;re typing.</p>
<p>Perfectly natural thing.</p>
<p>I mean, again, in a few hundred years.</p>
<p>Maybe sooner than that.</p>
<p>But basically, as long as the machine is consistent</p>
<p>in the way that it will respond to your brain impulses,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll figure out how to control that</p>
<p>and you could play tennis with your third limb.</p>
<p>And let me go back to consistency.</p>
<p>People who have dramatic accidents</p>
<p>that basically take out a whole chunk of their brain</p>
<p>can be taught to coopt other parts of the brain</p>
<p>to then control that part.</p>
<p>You can basically build up that tissue again</p>
<p>and eventually train your body how to walk again</p>
<p>and how to read again and how to play again</p>
<p>and how to think again, how to speak a language again,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a massive amount of malleability</p>
<p>that happens naturally in our way of controlling our body,</p>
<p>our brain, our thoughts, our vocal cords, our limbs,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>And human machine interfaces are inevitable</p>
<p>if we sort of figure out how to read these electric impulses,</p>
<p>but the resolution at which we can understand human thought</p>
<p>right now is nil, is ridiculous.</p>
<p>So how are human thoughts encoded?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically combinations of neurons that cofire</p>
<p>and these create these things called engrams</p>
<p>that eventually form memories and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>We know nothing of all that stuff.</p>
<p>So before we can actually read into your brain</p>
<p>that you wanna build a program</p>
<p>that does this and this and this and that,</p>
<p>we need a lot of neuroscience.</p>
<p>Well, so to push back on that,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible that without understanding</p>
<p>the functionally about the brain or from the neuroscience</p>
<p>or the cognitive science or psychology,</p>
<p>whichever level of the brain we&rsquo;ll look at,</p>
<p>do you think if we just connect them,</p>
<p>just like per your previous point,</p>
<p>if we just have a high enough resolution</p>
<p>between connection between a Wikipedia and your brain,</p>
<p>the brain will just figure it out with us understanding</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s one of the innovations of Neuralink</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re increasing the number of connections</p>
<p>to the brain to like several thousand,</p>
<p>which before was in the dozens or whatever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still off by a few orders of magnitude</p>
<p>on the order of seven.</p>
<p>Right, but the thing is, the hope is if you increase</p>
<p>that number more and more and more,</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t need to understand anything</p>
<p>about the actual how human thought</p>
<p>is represented in the brain.</p>
<p>You can just let it figure it out by itself.</p>
<p>Keanu Reeves waking up and saying, I know cook food.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So yeah, sure.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have faith in the plasticity of the brain</p>
<p>to that degree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about brain plasticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the input aspect.</p>
<p>Basically, I think on the output aspect,</p>
<p>being able to control a machine is something</p>
<p>that you can probably train your neural impulses</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re sending out to sort of match</p>
<p>whatever response you see in the environment.</p>
<p>If this thing moved every single time I thought</p>
<p>a particular thought, then I could figure out,</p>
<p>I could hack my way into moving this thing</p>
<p>with just a series of thoughts.</p>
<p>I could think guitar, piano, tennis ball,</p>
<p>and then this thing would be moving.</p>
<p>And then I would just have the series of thoughts</p>
<p>that would sort of result in the impulses</p>
<p>that will move this thing the way that I want it.</p>
<p>And then eventually it&rsquo;ll become natural</p>
<p>because I won&rsquo;t even think about it.</p>
<p>I mean, in the same way that we control our limbs</p>
<p>in a very natural way, but babies don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Babies have to figure it out.</p>
<p>And some of that is hard coded,</p>
<p>but some of that is actually learned</p>
<p>based on whatever soup of neurons you ended up with,</p>
<p>whatever connections you pruned them to,</p>
<p>and eventually you were born with.</p>
<p>A lot of that is coded in the genome,</p>
<p>but a huge chunk of that is stochastic.</p>
<p>And sort of the way that you sort of create</p>
<p>all these neurons, they migrate, they form connections,</p>
<p>they sort of spread out,</p>
<p>they have particular branching patterns,</p>
<p>but then the connectivity itself,</p>
<p>unique in every single new person.</p>
<p>All this to say that on the output side,</p>
<p>absolutely, I&rsquo;m very, very, you know,</p>
<p>hopeful that we can have machines</p>
<p>that read thousands of these neuronal connections</p>
<p>on the output side, but on the input side, oh boy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect any time in the near future</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to sort of send a series of impulses</p>
<p>that will tell me, oh, earth to sun distance,</p>
<p>7.5 million, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Like nowhere.</p>
<p>I mean, I think language will still be the input way</p>
<p>rather than sort of any kind of more complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting notion</p>
<p>that the ambiguity of language is a feature.</p>
<p>And we evolved for millions of years</p>
<p>to take advantage of that ambiguity.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And yet no one teaches us the subtle differences</p>
<p>between words that are near cognates,</p>
<p>and yet evoke so much more than, you know,</p>
<p>one from the other.</p>
<p>And yet, you know, when you&rsquo;re choosing words</p>
<p>from a list of 20 synonyms,</p>
<p>you know exactly the connotation</p>
<p>of every single one of them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that, you know, is there.</p>
<p>So yes, there&rsquo;s ambiguity,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s all kinds of connotations.</p>
<p>And in the way that we select our words,</p>
<p>we have so much baggage that we&rsquo;re sending along,</p>
<p>the way that we&rsquo;re emoting,</p>
<p>the way that we&rsquo;re moving our hands</p>
<p>every single time we speak,</p>
<p>the, you know, the pauses, the eye contact, et cetera.</p>
<p>So much higher baud rate than just a vocal,</p>
<p>you know, string of characters.</p>
<p>Well, let me just take a small tangent on that.</p>
<p>Oh, tangent?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done that yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a tangent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to the origin of life after.</p>
<p>So, I mean, you&rsquo;re Greek,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going on this personal journey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to Paris for the explicit purpose</p>
<p>of talking to one of the most famous,</p>
<p>a couple who&rsquo;s a famous translators of Russian literature,</p>
<p>Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and they go,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their art is the translation.</p>
<p>And everything I&rsquo;ve learned about the translation art,</p>
<p>it makes me feel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so profound in a way that&rsquo;s so much more profound</p>
<p>than the natural language processing papers</p>
<p>I read in the machine learning community,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s such depth to language</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know what to do with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve experienced that in your own life</p>
<p>with knowing multiple languages.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to make sense of it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much loss in translation</p>
<p>between Russian and English,</p>
<p>and getting a sense of that.</p>
<p>Like, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like just taking a single sentence</p>
<p>from Dostoevsky, and like, there&rsquo;s a lot of them.</p>
<p>You could talk for hours</p>
<p>about how to translate that sentence properly.</p>
<p>That captures the meaning, the period,</p>
<p>the culture, the humor, the wit,</p>
<p>the suffering that was in the context of the time,</p>
<p>all of that could be a single sentence.</p>
<p>You could talk forever about what it takes</p>
<p>to translate that correctly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>So being Greek, it&rsquo;s very hard for me</p>
<p>to think of a sentence or even a word</p>
<p>without going into the full etymology of that word,</p>
<p>breaking up every single atom of that sentence</p>
<p>and every single atom of these words</p>
<p>and rebuilding it back up.</p>
<p>I have three kids.</p>
<p>And the way that I teach them Greek</p>
<p>is the same way that, you know,</p>
<p>the documentary I was mentioning earlier</p>
<p>about sort of understanding the deep roots</p>
<p>of all of these, you know, words.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>that every single time I hear a new word</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never heard before,</p>
<p>I go and figure out the etymology of that word</p>
<p>because I will never appreciate that word</p>
<p>without understanding how it was initially formed.</p>
<p>Interesting, but how does that help?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s not the full picture.</p>
<p>No, no, of course, of course.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that knowing the components</p>
<p>teaches you about the context of the formation of that word</p>
<p>and sort of the original usage of that word.</p>
<p>And then of course the word takes new meaning</p>
<p>as you create it, you know, from its parts.</p>
<p>And that meaning then gets augmented.</p>
<p>And two synonyms that sort of have different roots</p>
<p>will actually have implications</p>
<p>that carry a lot of that baggage</p>
<p>of the historical provenance of these words.</p>
<p>So before working on genome evolution,</p>
<p>my passion was evolution of language</p>
<p>and sort of tracing cognates across different languages</p>
<p>through their etymologies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that there&rsquo;s parallels between,</p>
<p>I mean, the idea that there&rsquo;s evolutionary dynamics</p>
<p>to our language.</p>
<p>Yeah, every single word that you utter, parallels, parallels.</p>
<p>What does parallels mean?</p>
<p>Para means side by side.</p>
<p>Alleles from alleles, which means identical twins.</p>
<p>Parallels.</p>
<p>I mean, name any word and there&rsquo;s so much baggage,</p>
<p>so much beauty in how that word came to be</p>
<p>and how this word took a new meaning</p>
<p>than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s so many different words</p>
<p>that are just words.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any physical grounding.</p>
<p>And now you take these words</p>
<p>and you weave them into a sentence.</p>
<p>The emotional invocations of that weaving are fathomless.</p>
<p>And all of those emotions all live in the brains of humans.</p>
<p>In the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>No, seriously, you have to embrace this concept</p>
<p>of the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the conceptualization that nothing takes meaning</p>
<p>with one person creating it.</p>
<p>Everything takes meaning in the receiving end</p>
<p>and the emergent properties of these communication networks</p>
<p>where every single, you know,</p>
<p>if you look at the network of our cells</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re communicating with each other,</p>
<p>every cell has its own code.</p>
<p>This code is modulated by the epigenome.</p>
<p>This creates a bunch of different cell types.</p>
<p>Each cell type now has its own identity.</p>
<p>Yet they all have the common root of the stem cells</p>
<p>that sort of led to them.</p>
<p>Each of these identities is now communicating</p>
<p>with each other.</p>
<p>They take meaning in their interaction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an emergent property that comes</p>
<p>from a bunch of cells being together</p>
<p>that is not in any one of the parts.</p>
<p>If you look at neurons communicating,</p>
<p>again, these engrams don&rsquo;t exist in any one neuron.</p>
<p>They exist in the connection and the combination of neurons.</p>
<p>And the meaning of the words that I&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>is empty until it reaches you</p>
<p>and it affects you in a very different way</p>
<p>than it affects whoever&rsquo;s listening</p>
<p>to this conversation now.</p>
<p>Because of the emotional baggage that I&rsquo;ve grown up with,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve grown up with, and that they&rsquo;ve grown up with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think, the magic of translation.</p>
<p>If you start thinking of translation</p>
<p>as just simply capturing that emotional set of reactions</p>
<p>that you evoke, you need a different set of words</p>
<p>to evoke that same set of reactions to a French person</p>
<p>than to a Russian person,</p>
<p>because of the baggage of the culture that we grew up in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So basically, you shouldn&rsquo;t find the best word.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a completely different sentence structure</p>
<p>that you will need,</p>
<p>matched to the cultural context</p>
<p>of the target audience that you have.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of different words</p>
<p>in the target audience that you have.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, I mean, you&rsquo;re just&hellip;</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t think about this,</p>
<p>but right now, there&rsquo;s this feeling,</p>
<p>as a reminder, that it&rsquo;s just you and I talking,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s several hundred thousand people</p>
<p>will listen to this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some guy in Russia right now running,</p>
<p>like in Moscow, listening to us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody in India, I guarantee you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody in China and South America.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody in Texas,</p>
<p>they all have different&hellip;</p>
<p>Emotional baggage.</p>
<p>They probably got angry earlier on</p>
<p>about the whole discussion about coronavirus</p>
<p>and about some aspect of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s that network effect that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And this lateral transfer of information,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes the collective, quote unquote,</p>
<p>genome of humanity so unique from any other species.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you somehow miraculously wrapped it back</p>
<p>to the very beginning of when we were talking</p>
<p>about the beauty of the human genome.</p>
<p>So I think this is the right time,</p>
<p>unless we wanna go for a six to eight hour conversation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to talk again,</p>
<p>but I think for now, to wrap it up,</p>
<p>this is the right time to talk about</p>
<p>the biggest, most ridiculous question of all,</p>
<p>meaning of life.</p>
<p>Off mic, you mentioned to me</p>
<p>that you had your 42nd birthday.</p>
<p>42nd being a very special, absurdly special number.</p>
<p>And you had a kind of get together with friends</p>
<p>to discuss the meaning of life.</p>
<p>So let me ask you,</p>
<p>in your, as a biologist, as a computer scientist,</p>
<p>and as a human, what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asking this question for a long time,</p>
<p>ever since my 42nd birthday,</p>
<p>but well before that,</p>
<p>in even planning the meaning of life symposium.</p>
<p>And symposium, sim means together,</p>
<p>posy actually means to drink together.</p>
<p>So symposium is actually a drinking party.</p>
<p>So the meaning.</p>
<p>Can you actually elaborate about this meaning of life</p>
<p>symposium that you put together?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the most genius idea I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>So 42 is obviously the answer to life,</p>
<p>the universe and everything,</p>
<p>from the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy.</p>
<p>And as I was turning 42,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the theme for every one of my birthdays.</p>
<p>When I was turning 32, it&rsquo;s one, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero</p>
<p>in binary.</p>
<p>So I celebrated my 100,000th binary birthday,</p>
<p>and I had a theme of going back 100,000 years,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s dress something in the last 100,000 years.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was, I&rsquo;ve always had these.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting human being.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had these sort of numerology</p>
<p>related announcements for my birthday parties.</p>
<p>So what came out of that meaning of life symposium</p>
<p>is that I basically asked 42 of my colleagues,</p>
<p>42 of my friends, 42 of my collaborators,</p>
<p>to basically give seven minutes species</p>
<p>on the meaning of life, each from their perspective.</p>
<p>And I really encourage you to go there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s mind boggling</p>
<p>that every single person said a different answer.</p>
<p>Every single person started with,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the meaning of life is, but,</p>
<p>and then give this beautifully eloquently answer,</p>
<p>eloquent answer.</p>
<p>And they were all different,</p>
<p>but they all were consistent with each other</p>
<p>and mutually synergistic and together forming</p>
<p>a beautiful view of what it means to be human in many ways.</p>
<p>Some people talked about the loss of their loved one,</p>
<p>their life partner for many, many years</p>
<p>and how their life changed through that.</p>
<p>Some people talked about the origin of life.</p>
<p>Some people talked about the difference</p>
<p>between purpose and meaning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll maybe quote one of the answers,</p>
<p>which is this linguistics professor,</p>
<p>friend of mine at Harvard, who basically said,</p>
<p>that she was gonna, she&rsquo;s Greek as well.</p>
<p>And she said, I will give a very Pythian answer.</p>
<p>So Pythia was the Oracle of Delphi,</p>
<p>who would basically give these very cryptic answers,</p>
<p>very short, but interpretable in many different ways.</p>
<p>There was this whole set of priests</p>
<p>who were tasked with interpreting what Pythia had said.</p>
<p>And very often you would not get a clean interpretation,</p>
<p>but she said, I will be like Pythia</p>
<p>and give you a very short and multiply interpretable answer.</p>
<p>But unlike her, I will actually also give you</p>
<p>three interpretations.</p>
<p>And she said, the answer to the meaning of life</p>
<p>is become one.</p>
<p>And the first interpretation is like a child,</p>
<p>become one year old with the excitement</p>
<p>of discovering everything about the world.</p>
<p>Second interpretation, in whatever you take on,</p>
<p>become one, the first, the best, excel,</p>
<p>drive yourself to perfection for every one of your tasks</p>
<p>and become one when people are separate,</p>
<p>become one, come together, learn to understand each other.</p>
<p>Damn, that&rsquo;s an answer.</p>
<p>And one way to summarize</p>
<p>this whole meaning of life symposium</p>
<p>is that the very symposium was illustrating</p>
<p>the quest for meaning,</p>
<p>which might itself be the meaning of life.</p>
<p>This constant quest for something sublime,</p>
<p>something human, something intangible,</p>
<p>some aspect of what defines us as a species</p>
<p>and as an individual.</p>
<p>Both the quest of me as a person through my own life,</p>
<p>but the meaning of life could also be</p>
<p>the meaning of all of life.</p>
<p>What is the whole point of life?</p>
<p>Why life?</p>
<p>Why life itself?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve been talking about the history</p>
<p>and evolution of life,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t talked about why life in the first place?</p>
<p>Is life inevitable?</p>
<p>Is life part of physics?</p>
<p>Does life transcend physics</p>
<p>by fighting against entropy,</p>
<p>by compartmentalizing and increasing concentrations</p>
<p>rather than diluting away?</p>
<p>Is life a distinct entity in the universe</p>
<p>beyond the traditional very simple physical rules</p>
<p>that govern gravity and electromagnetism</p>
<p>and all of these forces?</p>
<p>Is life another force?</p>
<p>Is there a life force?</p>
<p>Is there a unique kind of set of principles that emerge,</p>
<p>of course, built on top of the hardware of physics,</p>
<p>but is it sort of a new layer of software</p>
<p>or a new layer of a computer system?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s at the level of big questions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another aspect of gratitude</p>
<p>of basically what I like to say is,</p>
<p>during this pandemic,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve basically worked from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m.</p>
<p>every single day, nonstop, including Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve basically broken all boundaries</p>
<p>of where life, personal life begins</p>
<p>and work life ends.</p>
<p>And that has been exhilarating for me,</p>
<p>just the intellectual pleasure that I get</p>
<p>from a day of exhaustion,</p>
<p>where at the end of the day, my brain is hurting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling my wife, wow, I was useful today.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain pleasure</p>
<p>that comes from feeling useful.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain pleasure</p>
<p>that comes from feeling grateful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve written this little sort of prayer for my kids</p>
<p>to say at bedtime every night,</p>
<p>where they basically say,</p>
<p>thank you, God, for all you have given me</p>
<p>and give me the strength to give onto others</p>
<p>with the same love that you have given onto me.</p>
<p>We as a species are so special,</p>
<p>the only ones who worry about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s what makes us human.</p>
<p>And what I like to say to my wife and to my students</p>
<p>during this pandemic work extravaganza</p>
<p>is every now and then they ask me, but how do you do this?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m a workaholic.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>This is me in the most unfiltered way.</p>
<p>The ability to do something useful,</p>
<p>to feel that my brain is being used,</p>
<p>to interact with the smartest people on the planet</p>
<p>day in, day out, and to help them discover aspects</p>
<p>of the human genome, of the human brain,</p>
<p>of human disease and the human condition</p>
<p>that no one has seen before</p>
<p>with data that we&rsquo;re capturing that has never been observed.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another aspect, which is on the personal life.</p>
<p>Many people say, oh, I&rsquo;m not gonna have kids, why bother?</p>
<p>I can tell you as a father,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re missing half the picture, if not the whole picture.</p>
<p>Teaching my kids about my view of the world</p>
<p>and watching through their eyes</p>
<p>the naivete with which they start</p>
<p>and the sophistication with which they end up,</p>
<p>the understanding that they have</p>
<p>of not just the natural world around them, but of me too.</p>
<p>The unfiltered criticism that you get from your own children</p>
<p>that knows no bounds of honesty.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve grown components of my heart</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t know I had</p>
<p>until you sense that fragility,</p>
<p>that vulnerability of the children,</p>
<p>that immense love and passion,</p>
<p>the unfiltered egoism,</p>
<p>that we as adults learn how to hide so much better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this back of emotions</p>
<p>that tell me about the raw materials that make a human being</p>
<p>and how these raw materials can be arranged</p>
<p>with more sophistication that we learn through life</p>
<p>to become truly human adults.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something so beautiful</p>
<p>about seeing that progression between them</p>
<p>and seeing that progress and that progress</p>
<p>and that progression between them,</p>
<p>the complexity of the language growing</p>
<p>as more neural connections are formed</p>
<p>to realize that the hardware is getting rearranged</p>
<p>as their software is getting implemented on that hardware,</p>
<p>that their frontal cortex continues to grow</p>
<p>for another 10 years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s neuronal connections that are continuing to form,</p>
<p>new neurons that actually get replicated and formed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just incredible that we have these,</p>
<p>not just you grow the hardware for 30 years</p>
<p>and then you feed it all of the knowledge.</p>
<p>No, no, the knowledge is fed throughout</p>
<p>and is shaping these neural connections as they&rsquo;re forming.</p>
<p>So seeing that transformation from either your own blood</p>
<p>or from an adopted child</p>
<p>is the most beautiful thing you can do as a human being.</p>
<p>And it completes you, it completes that path, that journey.</p>
<p>The create life, oh sure, that&rsquo;s at conception, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>But create human life to add the human part,</p>
<p>that takes decades of compassion, of sharing,</p>
<p>of love and of anger and of impatience and patience.</p>
<p>And as a parent,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve become a very different kind of teacher</p>
<p>because again, I&rsquo;m a professor.</p>
<p>My first role is to bring adult human beings</p>
<p>into a more mature level of adulthood</p>
<p>where they learn not just to do science,</p>
<p>but they learn the process of discovery</p>
<p>and the process of collaboration, the process of sharing,</p>
<p>the process of conveying the knowledge</p>
<p>of encapsulating something incredibly complex</p>
<p>and sort of giving it up in sort of bite sized chunks</p>
<p>that the rest of humanity can appreciate.</p>
<p>I tell my students all the time, if you, you know,</p>
<p>like when an apple fall,</p>
<p>when a tree falls in the forest</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s there to listen, has it really fallen?</p>
<p>The same way you do this awesome research,</p>
<p>if you write an impenetrable paper that no one will understand,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if you never did the awesome research.</p>
<p>So conveying of knowledge, conveying this lateral transfer</p>
<p>that I was talking about at the very beginning</p>
<p>of sort of humanity and sort of the sharing of information,</p>
<p>all of that has gotten so much more rich</p>
<p>by seeing human beings grow in my own home</p>
<p>because that makes me a better parent</p>
<p>and that makes me a better teacher and a better mentor</p>
<p>to the nurturing of my adult children,</p>
<p>which are my research group.</p>
<p>First of all, beautifully put, connects beautifully</p>
<p>to the vertical and the horizontal inheritance of ideas</p>
<p>that we talked about at the very beginning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it</p>
<p>on this poetic and powerful note.</p>
<p>Manolis, thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>It was a huge honor.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to talk again about the origin of life,</p>
<p>about epigenetics, epigenomics,</p>
<p>and some of the incredible research you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Truly an honor. Thanks so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you. Such a pleasure. It&rsquo;s such a pleasure.</p>
<p>I mean, your questions are outstanding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had such a blast here and I can&rsquo;t wait to be back.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>from Charles Darwin that I think Manolis</p>
<p>represents quite beautifully.</p>
<p>If I had my life to live over again,</p>
<p>I would have made a rule to read some poetry</p>
<p>and listen to some music at least once every week.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
