<p>Welcome Grant to the show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to have you here.</p>
<p>How are you doing today?</p>
<p>Doing awesome, Lindsay.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me hang out with you.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>So guys on the show today, I&rsquo;m excited to introduce Grant Baldwin.</p>
<p>Grant has been featured on the Inc. 5000 list, Forbes, Entrepreneur Magazine, and Huffington</p>
<p>Post.</p>
<p>He is a speaker and author, and he is on a mission to motivate leaders and entrepreneurs</p>
<p>to become better public speakers.</p>
<p>He is also the host of the Speaker Lab podcast from Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s life in Nashville, Grant?</p>
<p>Life is wonderful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m married to my high school sweetheart.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got three beautiful daughters, so it&rsquo;s me and a house full of women.</p>
<p>So no complaints.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m loving life.</p>
<p>Sounds like a great life.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re excited to have you here because our listeners, they are doing business in</p>
<p>English as their second language, and public speaking to begin with can be quite a challenge</p>
<p>for all of us, even in our native language, but for our listeners, we&rsquo;re learning how</p>
<p>to do this in English.</p>
<p>So you are the authority today on public speaking.</p>
<p>Could you start us off with a story of a time when, you know, a speech didn&rsquo;t start out</p>
<p>so great for you, and how did you turn it around?</p>
<p>Do you have any little anecdote for us?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a, you know, anytime that you&rsquo;re giving a presentation, there&rsquo;s a lot of variables</p>
<p>and factors that go into it of what makes a talk work, you know, because there&rsquo;s times</p>
<p>you may finish and you may feel like that went really well and times where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it was a disaster.</p>
<p>So I always remind speakers, there&rsquo;s actually three variables that kind of go into it that</p>
<p>we look at.</p>
<p>One is going to be you as a speaker.</p>
<p>You know, were you prepared?</p>
<p>Were you ready?</p>
<p>Did you show up?</p>
<p>Or did you just kind of wing it?</p>
<p>Did you just go through the motions?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So maybe your talk didn&rsquo;t go well, and it&rsquo;s really heavily dependent on you and your part.</p>
<p>Maybe a talk didn&rsquo;t go well, but like you showed up, you brought it, you crushed it,</p>
<p>but there were some other variables in play there.</p>
<p>So another variable and factor is going to be the audience, okay?</p>
<p>So let me give an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that you&rsquo;re getting ready to speak, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re speaking to a group</p>
<p>of sales professionals and sales leaders.</p>
<p>And so right before you speak, the VP of sales for this company gets up and says, hey, you</p>
<p>know, the recession is kind of hitting us hard.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, what we&rsquo;re going to do, we&rsquo;re going to have to lay off half of you.</p>
<p>We were going to tell you who the half are that are going to make it and who the half</p>
<p>are we&rsquo;re going to have to let go.</p>
<p>But first, we&rsquo;re going to have this speaker.</p>
<p>Please welcome Grant.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say on stage, like nobody&rsquo;s listening to you, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So for example, I remember a few years ago, I was speaking in Houston, Texas, and there</p>
<p>was a hurricane coming in, and this hurricane was supposed to make landfall the next day.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like giving my all, everybody&rsquo;s on their phone, nobody&rsquo;s paying attention,</p>
<p>like making plans and stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking like, I don&rsquo;t want to be here.</p>
<p>I want to get out of here.</p>
<p>How do I, how do I get a next flight out?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s all those things where like, it&rsquo;s not going great, but it&rsquo;s like, kind</p>
<p>of, it&rsquo;s not necessarily my, it&rsquo;s just kind of the environment, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Another, another variable and factor is going to be the actual setting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s what I mean by that is, I remember a few years ago, I spoke at an event in New</p>
<p>Jersey.</p>
<p>And I remember I gave a keynote in a room that set 2000 people, and there was about</p>
<p>2000 people in there.</p>
<p>So you have a room that seats 2000 people, and you have 2000 people in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And so right afterwards, they had me do a workshop with about 50 people in the same</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re gonna do a keynote for a talk in front of 2000 people in a room that seats</p>
<p>2000 people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>When you do, you know, a set another session for 50 people in a room that seats 2000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s empty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another variable where like, it was something that was kind of outside</p>
<p>my control.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you want to try to make the room as small as possible, but right.</p>
<p>So all that say, yeah, there&rsquo;s times where like a talk goes great in a time where talk</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go so well, a hurricane may be coming.</p>
<p>I remember one time speaking at an event and they were, it was at this hotel and they were</p>
<p>doing some construction outside of the hotel and the power got cut for the entire hotel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no lighting at all.</p>
<p>And this is kind of like between sessions and I&rsquo;m supposed to do a session coming up.</p>
<p>And so I had everyone turn on the flashlight on their phone and just hold up and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no mic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, I&rsquo;m just kind of yelling, you know, into the darkness is kind of incredible.</p>
<p>No external lighting.</p>
<p>I remember one time, like a dog came running into a room and I&rsquo;m trying to give a talk</p>
<p>and the dog just zipping around the room and nobody&rsquo;s paying attention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching.</p>
<p>So all this, I like crazy things happen as speaker, but I think also like that&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>You know, those kind of like raw, real moments, that&rsquo;s part, whether it goes well or it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go well, like that&rsquo;s also part of what makes you a better speaker and communicator.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we have to be ready for everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given us a lot of examples of storms and crazy things that happen, especially in</p>
<p>places like Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>They do get a lot of hurricanes, a lot of crazy things happen.</p>
<p>Our dogs running in or a room that&rsquo;s too small, too big.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t control these things.</p>
<p>So then let&rsquo;s get into then your three tips here, Grant, because I think that whether</p>
<p>we have the perfect conditions, no dogs, no storms, nothing like that, we&rsquo;re still going</p>
<p>to be a little bit nervous.</p>
<p>So what are three things that our listeners could do to start to overcome their fear of</p>
<p>public speaking?</p>
<p>That is, they say that most people are more afraid of public speaking than death.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s actually just a kind of a false tale, but I know we&rsquo;re all pretty</p>
<p>scared of it.</p>
<p>So what can we do to get over our fear and work through our fear?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say a couple of things.</p>
<p>One is to recognize like some of that, that fear is oftentimes mistaken for adrenaline</p>
<p>or excitement.</p>
<p>And so you think about like some of the biggest key moments in your life where you felt something</p>
<p>similar.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like when I proposed to my wife or when my daughters were born or, you know, something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just like, Ooh, like the blood is, is really pumping.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like, you know, when I, when I was getting ready to propose to my wife,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t feeling like, Oh my gosh, I&rsquo;m going to die.</p>
<p>This is going to be a disaster.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to reject me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty confident here, but there&rsquo;s still like just the excitement</p>
<p>or like right before you get on a roller coaster, you know, it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>Ooh, all right.</p>
<p>I hope this goes well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s an excitement there.</p>
<p>But oftentimes we can mistake that for the nerves and the, the feeling of just like,</p>
<p>Oh, this is horrible.</p>
<p>I, you know, I feel nervous, therefore I shouldn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>Like, no, no, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s kind of an excitement.</p>
<p>And oftentimes we, it&rsquo;s kind of like the body&rsquo;s way of reminding us like, Hey, Hey, heads</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Like, this is important.</p>
<p>Like, this is a big deal.</p>
<p>Like focusing, you know?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so like feeling that is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve given hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of presentations and I still feel</p>
<p>some of those nerves.</p>
<p>I still feel some of those butterflies and adrenaline and anxiety.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the question then is kind of number two, like how do you control it?</p>
<p>How do you make sure it&rsquo;s not debilitating and it&rsquo;s not really like crushing you?</p>
<p>So one thing I would say would be that to really spend the time to practice and prepare</p>
<p>the best speakers on the planet.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just like scribble some ideas on a napkin and like hop up and I&rsquo;m just going to wing</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I just hope it all works together.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work like that.</p>
<p>They really spend a lot of time going over their talk and thinking it through.</p>
<p>And so you think about like in other industries or fields, you know, whether you are a professional</p>
<p>athlete or a musician, you know, you think like, Oh, they&rsquo;re just, you know, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>naturally athletic and they just hop up on the, on the court or the field or whatever.</p>
<p>And they just do their thing and it all just works out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, there&rsquo;s like some level of like natural athleticism, but also they spent</p>
<p>hours and hours and literally years training and practicing and going over plays and drills</p>
<p>and in the weight room to prepare so that it looks like it&rsquo;s natural and it&rsquo;s just kind</p>
<p>of flowing out on the field or the court or wherever it may be.</p>
<p>But really it&rsquo;s so much work behind the scenes to kind of that natural feeling that this</p>
<p>starts to come across.</p>
<p>So I think like really spending the time behind the scenes practicing and preparing goes a</p>
<p>long way as well.</p>
<p>And then the third thing I would say, and then we can kind of jump off wherever you</p>
<p>want here.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because I think especially for this audience, I think it&rsquo;s really easy to overthink about</p>
<p>any accent that you may have or tone that you may have or feel self-conscious of what</p>
<p>if people, you know, what if it sounds weird to an audience and what if people don&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>understand what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I&rsquo;ll talk with someone here in the U.S. who has like a real Southern</p>
<p>accent and they just kind of got a little twang to them, you know, and they&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of just worried about like, well, you know, is that going to be off-putting to an audience?</p>
<p>And so one thing that&rsquo;s good to remember is that as a human, you are talking to a collection</p>
<p>of other humans.</p>
<p>And so act like a human, right?</p>
<p>And so I think sometimes we feel like in order to be a speaker, you have to be like overly</p>
<p>polished and overly robotic, perfect, like a God or something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The case, you know, like you&rsquo;re a person talking to other people.</p>
<p>So act like a human.</p>
<p>So when a dog comes running in the room, laugh about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the end of the world, you know, make a, make a joke about it or whatever it may</p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so if I think that the key is like, make sure if you have some type of accent or something,</p>
<p>make sure you enunciate so that people can at least understand you make sure that what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, that you&rsquo;re speaking at a pace or cadence where people can understand what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying is an accent of any kind is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s endearing.</p>
<p>As long as people can still understand what you&rsquo;re saying, where people can&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>you, then it becomes a little bit more challenging because they&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t even know what</p>
<p>the message is here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so they just start to check out.</p>
<p>So lean into the accent, lean into your own personality there.</p>
<p>Make sure you speak at a pace and with an enunciation that people can still understand</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>But again, those like characteristics of how you speak and communicate, which may sound</p>
<p>different than someone else, it&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>Those are like endearing, normal human things.</p>
<p>So certainly lean into that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And in that case, we go back to the preparation because we know there&rsquo;s a reason why we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually presenting on this topic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we are experts on this topic, whatever we&rsquo;re talking about for our listeners.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so coming back to that and remembering that what strikes me about these tips, Grant,</p>
<p>is interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of what works in public speaking.</p>
<p>It sounds like it&rsquo;s what works in one-on-one conversation as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being human.</p>
<p>And I love your first tip about raw energy.</p>
<p>You know, this idea we automatically make it a bad thing, right?</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re about to get on stage, we feel that energy and we think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong right now.</p>
<p>But what if we thought, actually, that&rsquo;s my that&rsquo;s my power, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to make this speech amazing.</p>
<p>And I love how then we take it into the preparation.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>
<p>I mean, so basically, you&rsquo;ve gone through them.</p>
<p>I mean, this is it, guys.</p>
<p>I mean, make sure that you relabel your energy in your mind as good.</p>
<p>Consider that a good sign.</p>
<p>Lean on preparation.</p>
<p>And for our listeners, we&rsquo;re going to want to spend even more time preparing than if</p>
<p>we were going to give this speech in our native language.</p>
<p>Right, Grant?</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, you want to you want to feel confident and like, let me give an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say if you think back to like high school or college or university and you remember</p>
<p>the days of like taking a quiz or an exam or a test or something like that, like you</p>
<p>have no choice.</p>
<p>You could kind of show up and like, I&rsquo;m just going to, you know, I sat in through class</p>
<p>and kind of listen to some lectures and sort of paid attention.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;m just going to kind of go through the motions and we&rsquo;ll see how the</p>
<p>test goes.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m really going to spend the time to I&rsquo;m going to go over my notes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to practice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually living this right now.</p>
<p>So this is a total random side note, but I have been I&rsquo;ve always thought it&rsquo;d be cool</p>
<p>to get my pilot&rsquo;s license for the past, like seven months I&rsquo;ve been working towards this.</p>
<p>Well, tomorrow, actually, as we record this tomorrow, I have a big exam with the FAA,</p>
<p>like a written test.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s been years since I&rsquo;ve studied for a written test.</p>
<p>Well, I got a stack of books over here and papers I&rsquo;ve been studying and reviewing.</p>
<p>So when I go tomorrow, like 24 hours from now and sit down to take this exam, like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to feel confident because like I&rsquo;ve done the work I&rsquo;ve practiced, I&rsquo;ve put it</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>And so, again, there&rsquo;s still maybe some butterflies like, all right, this is a big test.</p>
<p>This is important.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s been a lot of time getting ready for this, but kind of similar to like</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about from like a sports analogy standpoint, like you think the guys</p>
<p>that play the Super Bowl aren&rsquo;t nervous?</p>
<p>Well, of course, they&rsquo;re like that excitement, the adrenaline, like but they&rsquo;ve played hundreds</p>
<p>and hundreds of football games, you know, but this is a big deal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like, oh, my gosh, I feel butterflies.</p>
<p>I feel excitement.</p>
<p>I feel adrenaline.</p>
<p>I feel like I shouldn&rsquo;t do this or I&rsquo;m not ready.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, no, like you&rsquo;ve put in the work to be ready.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you need.</p>
<p>Show up and do the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>That is the final force of energy that you need to put your skills into action at that</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it, Grant?</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>And I think on the just to the opposite side of things, you know, the raw energy shows</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to go on stage.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a scenario where we actually don&rsquo;t know the material or haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prepared.</p>
<p>And I think in that case, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s detrimental.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we might have our mind go blank or we might get really nervous and stumble</p>
<p>and kind of mess up the speech.</p>
<p>Would you agree?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how it can go in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me give you two quick thoughts on that.</p>
<p>One is that when you when you have you just kind of like draw a blank or something like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been times I remember.</p>
<p>I remember one time I was speaking and doing like a workshop or something and I just draw</p>
<p>a blank.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what we were talking about or what the story was.</p>
<p>I just completely lose my train of thought, which, again, happens.</p>
<p>It happens.</p>
<p>So, you know, one thing is like you can panic and become nervous.</p>
<p>And but I remember like I remember just talking to a lady in the front row and I was just</p>
<p>like, what was I talking about?</p>
<p>And it just and it&rsquo;s important to remember, like the audience takes their cues from you.</p>
<p>And so something&rsquo;s not a big deal to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a big deal to them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But if all of a sudden I get uncomfortable, then they&rsquo;re just like, oh, it like it makes</p>
<p>you as an audience member feel like, oh, this is painful to watch.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s no big deal to them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I realize that they&rsquo;re like as the speaker, like you set the tone and if you forget something</p>
<p>like again, act like a human and just make a joke about it, like I totally lost my train</p>
<p>of thought.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about something different.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;d be one thought.</p>
<p>Another thought real quick is that that I think sometimes with a speech specifically</p>
<p>is that we feel like I I have to get things in the exact right order and I have to say</p>
<p>things exactly the same way.</p>
<p>But remember, it&rsquo;s not like the audience has a script where they&rsquo;re following along and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, oh, you said that wrong or you did that out of order or you miss a line.</p>
<p>Like if you are if you&rsquo;re singing the national anthem for your country and you mess up the</p>
<p>lyrics, everybody there knows because they know what the lyrics are supposed to be.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re giving a speech and, you know, you do the thing, you do points out of order</p>
<p>or you forget a story or you tell a story later or you just forget the key line.</p>
<p>Nobody knows.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Nobody has any idea.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s following along and keeping track of these things.</p>
<p>So again, you said you you you are like the the thermostat for the room and it&rsquo;s no big</p>
<p>deal to you and you just keep going on.</p>
<p>Nobody knows anything different.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then you can decide how and when or whether to tie that piece back in that you may have</p>
<p>left behind because it comes back to your connection with the audience.</p>
<p>I feel I love how this, again, ties in with one on one conversation.</p>
<p>It works for speeches, guys.</p>
<p>Giving a presentation or a speech is not a whole other world, a whole new set of skills</p>
<p>we have to learn.</p>
<p>Yes, there are some skills, but the basic principles come back to using your energy,</p>
<p>being prepared and connecting.</p>
<p>So good, Grant.</p>
<p>This is fantastic.</p>
<p>So where can our listeners find what you&rsquo;re up to online, your podcast, your website,</p>
