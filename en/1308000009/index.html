    <p>Hey everybody, hey everybody, welcome to another episode of All In, the podcast episode eight.</p>
<p>Besties are here to talk about tech, economy, politics, the election, and our lives in Silicon</p>
<p>Valley. Welcome back to the pod, David Friedberg, the Queen of Kinwai is here from an undisclosed</p>
<p>location.</p>
<p>Always a joy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Undisclosed location somewhere in the Midwest.</p>
<p>You bailed on SF after the smoke. You lasted how many days into the barbecue, into the</p>
<p>orange cloud?</p>
<p>I left on the Wednesday of the orange cloud and took, it was crazy, took my kiddos and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re waiting it out, the fires in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s beautiful the last two days here. Also from an undisclosed bestie location,</p>
<p>David Sachs back on the program. Rain Man is here.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Definitely here.</p>
<p>Good to be here.</p>
<p>All right. Well, there you go, man of many words. And speaking of the man of many words,</p>
<p>hot off of seven keynotes this week, talking about SPACs, the Prince of SPACs, Chamath</p>
<p>Palihapitiya back on the pod.</p>
<p>How are you besties?</p>
<p>Well, we had a little bestie reunion, which I think we can talk about. Chamath invited us over</p>
<p>to have an outdoor bestie reunion.</p>
<p>Yeah. And you gave one of them gonorrhea and you gave the other two.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s crazy to say, but I literally had to call Chamath two or three days after he hosted-</p>
<p>Oh, a socially, by the way, a socially distanced dinner outdoors.</p>
<p>Socially distant dinner outdoors. Wonderful. We had some great ribeye. Fantastic. Cracked</p>
<p>open a nice bottle or two of wine and the port.</p>
<p>And, but then what did you do?</p>
<p>But then what did you do?</p>
<p>Well, then a family member of mine, who shall remain nameless,</p>
<p>decided to go to a party in San Francisco and possibly got the Rona and he tested positive.</p>
<p>And then I had to get everybody in my house tested twice. Everybody came back negative,</p>
<p>but I had to call Chamath and tell him, listen, I wasn&rsquo;t exposed, but some members of my family</p>
<p>were, therefore I might have secondhand exposure. I took two tests, came back negative two times in</p>
<p>a row.</p>
<p>Can I just say though, it&rsquo;s really crazy. We have to develop all these new social norms</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not sure what to say and you&rsquo;re not sure how to react. And it&rsquo;s like, it must&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>like when you got a call and it&rsquo;s like, hey, listen, your girlfriend&rsquo;s like, I may be pregnant</p>
<p>or somebody&rsquo;s like, hey, listen, I have an STD. You&rsquo;re just like, what is going on?</p>
<p>I felt like that when I was texting the group chat. It was like three of us</p>
<p>and I had to text my tail between my legs. I think I&rsquo;ve been exposed. I&rsquo;m really sorry, guys.</p>
<p>I think Calcannus is the Greek word for a turd in the punch bowl.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. I don&rsquo;t know if we can tell the code 13 story.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m going to tell the code 13 story. I wasn&rsquo;t even there, but I</p>
<p>The code 13 story is legendary.</p>
<p>Jason Calcannus gets invited by David Sachs out of his benevolence to come to stay</p>
<p>in Hawaii at the Four Seasons. And at some point during this week-long vacation,</p>
<p>Christmas Day, you hear a shout from the pool from the lifeguard.</p>
<p>Well, no, no. It was even before that. We were sitting at the bar. So me and Jason and his</p>
<p>brother-in-law were sitting at the bar having drinks and all of a sudden there&rsquo;s a commotion</p>
<p>and the bartenders and the staff and we started hearing people on walkie-talkie saying code 13,</p>
<p>code 13.</p>
<p>People are running.</p>
<p>People are running.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what to make of that.</p>
<p>We think it&rsquo;s a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>I mean, literally the Four Seasons is on a high alert. Alarms are going off.</p>
<p>And then we hear, okay, well, we were like, we said to the bartender,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s the code 13? And he&rsquo;s like, well, it means that some kid,</p>
<p>you know, crapped in the pool.</p>
<p>Did a number two in the pool. And we&rsquo;re like, you know, and then we&rsquo;re like, okay, well, you know.</p>
<p>It was Jason&rsquo;s kid.</p>
<p>Well, then I started hearing something about like the Sachs kids and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>Sachs code 13.</p>
<p>They thought it was us.</p>
<p>And then it turns out it was, it was Jacob&rsquo;s kid.</p>
<p>And we were, we were never able to get a reservation again.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I went there at one point a few years later and it&rsquo;s a whole ordeal.</p>
<p>Cause they said, so how do you guys deal with like, you know, a code 13?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, code 13, you have to evacuate the whole hotel.</p>
<p>Half the island gets sent away.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what had to happen.</p>
<p>This is just to put the code 13 in perspective.</p>
<p>I think my 10 year old at the time was two years old.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law takes the baby in the pool without telling anybody.</p>
<p>And the baby&rsquo;s not wearing a swim diaper.</p>
<p>And so basically a Snickers bar floats out of the, and there&rsquo;s a Snickers bar in the pool.</p>
<p>And you guys have kids, you know, how big these things could get.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, how is that possible?</p>
<p>You know, like a movie theater size Snicker,</p>
<p>a king size Snicker pool is floating in the middle of the pool.</p>
<p>But this is on December 25th.</p>
<p>These poor people are spending $3,000 a night.</p>
<p>There is not a single chaise lounge by the pool that&rsquo;s not occupied.</p>
<p>It is peak capacity at the Four Seasons Hotel on the big island or wherever it was.</p>
<p>The pool has to be shut down for four hours.</p>
<p>The person has to get in with a hazmat suit, retrieve the Snickers bar.</p>
<p>King size Snickers has to get out of the pool.</p>
<p>Then they have to throw in every chemical known to man</p>
<p>so much so that the pool is ruined for Christmas day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the Code 13 story.</p>
<p>All right, getting back to our topics.</p>
<p>TikTok is on the verge of being banned from additional U.S. downloads.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department has announced that it will ban U.S. downloads</p>
<p>and business transactions with TikTok and WeChat.</p>
<p>Somehow WeChat got pulled into this on Sunday.</p>
<p>Seemingly, we&rsquo;re going to allow TikTok to operate until November 12th.</p>
<p>So they got a little bit of a stay of execution.</p>
<p>But of course, if they can&rsquo;t update in the App Store,</p>
<p>that means there could be any security vulnerabilities</p>
<p>that get found between now and then would not be able to be updated.</p>
<p>And Steve Mucin is attempting to push through a TikTok deal</p>
<p>that will enable retaining some Chinese ownership.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some sort of agreement now with Oracle</p>
<p>will have some kind of an oversight board to do continuous third party audits.</p>
<p>What does this say, Chamath, about where we&rsquo;re at?</p>
<p>And do you believe that a Democratic leader, let&rsquo;s say Obama or Biden,</p>
<p>would have taken the same approach here?</p>
<p>Does it worry you that the government&rsquo;s getting this involved?</p>
<p>Or is this inspiring that the government&rsquo;s putting their foot down</p>
<p>and saying, hey, we&rsquo;re not going to do this?</p>
<p>Is it inspiring that the government&rsquo;s putting their foot down and saying,</p>
<p>hey, listen, we&rsquo;re going to need to have some basic level of reciprocity from China</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to allow you in our App Store?</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;ve ever been driving someplace with your significant other,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, turn left.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, no, no, I&rsquo;m going to turn right.</p>
<p>And then you realize you should have turned left.</p>
<p>But then you keep turning right a few more times.</p>
<p>Then you take a couple more laps.</p>
<p>But then you end up at the same place.</p>
<p>But it was complete shit, dumb luck.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re going to end up in the same place here with TikTok,</p>
<p>which is that I think that the Trump administration probably is doing this.</p>
<p>And Donald Trump specifically probably does this more as a demonstration of power</p>
<p>and American exceptionalism, which I&rsquo;m not sure is the right reason to do it.</p>
<p>But I think the outcome is right, which is that for years,</p>
<p>China has essentially been shut out to American companies,</p>
<p>unless you effectively just kowtow to these guys.</p>
<p>And, you know, some companies have and some companies like,</p>
<p>you know, Google have not and other companies like Facebook</p>
<p>have been totally basically blocked from entering.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s completely right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfair to have the asymmetric market advantages that Chinese companies have had.</p>
<p>And so you have to play hardball to create a different set of rules.</p>
<p>And I think this probably gets us to that place.</p>
<p>The reason why it&rsquo;s happening is probably more because the TikTok people</p>
<p>played that joke on Trump at the Tulsa rally, if I had to guess.</p>
<p>Yeah. What do you think, Friedberg?</p>
<p>Is this a good sign for America and the globe that, you know,</p>
<p>and the democratic nations of the world that we&rsquo;re going to put our foot down with China and say,</p>
<p>hey, some reciprocity or you&rsquo;re not going to be able to participate in our marketplace?</p>
<p>Or is this a personal vendetta from Trump or a little bit of both?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s anything but a slippery slope forward in the escalation of,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s going to be kind of transpiring between these two nations in the</p>
<p>next couple of years and maybe decades.</p>
<p>You know, this goes back to the, you know, early 2000s when Google and others wanted</p>
<p>to enter China and China has, for those who don&rsquo;t know, China has this great firewall,</p>
<p>right? Chinese citizens can&rsquo;t openly access the rest of the Internet.</p>
<p>And China wanted to censor content and censor what their citizens are accessing.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s been a back and forth between the tech industry and China going back almost</p>
<p>20 years now to try and figure out how we can bring our services to China.</p>
<p>And then China launches a service that&rsquo;s very successful in the U.S. in TikTok.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just a, you know, a part of the reciprocity equation,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t resolve anything. It only escalates things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unfortunate, but it&rsquo;s just kind of another step in the path</p>
<p>that I think is inevitable in front of us here.</p>
<p>Sachs, we&rsquo;ll give you the final word here. Is this a good thing for humanity,</p>
<p>for international relations that China is, you know, having a little bit of a hand check here,</p>
<p>like, hey, there&rsquo;s going to be a limit to how you can operate in the West?</p>
<p>Or is this a personal vendetta from Trump? And then what do you see going forward?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that, I mean, first of all, our social networks are not allowed over there.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we need to feel bad about, you know, not allowing their social networks over here.</p>
<p>But besides reciprocity or the lack of it, I think the deeper reason for this is just around</p>
<p>data security and how the, you know, and I think that the CCP has given us adequate grounds here</p>
<p>to ban not just TikTok, but, you know, apps like that.</p>
<p>Because President Xi himself declared this policy of civil military fusion,</p>
<p>which means that any business in China, any business asset there, including data,</p>
<p>can be appropriated to serve the ends of the Chinese military or the Communist Party.</p>
<p>And, you know, the CCP has set up this vast surveillance apparatus over its own citizens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s asserted extraterritorial sovereignty over former Chinese citizens, meaning dissidents.</p>
<p>So the Chinese diaspora anywhere in the world, they&rsquo;ve asserted sovereignty over that.</p>
<p>And, you know, recently there was a pretty remarkable speech by the FBI director Christopher</p>
<p>Wray describing, you know, Operation Fox Hunt, which is the Chinese effort to track down</p>
<p>and presumably ultimately punish Chinese dissidents anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>And as part of that, the Chinese have sort of weaponized AI and social media.</p>
<p>And so he also described, I mean, this is like pretty amazing, you know, that the Equifax hack,</p>
<p>which collected data on something like, sensitive data on over 100 million Americans,</p>
<p>the Chinese were behind that. I didn&rsquo;t know that. And so, you know, it&rsquo;s true that, you know,</p>
<p>no one piece of data poses by itself a risk to the security of America or Americans, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of this systematic collection and aggregation of the data and the hacking</p>
<p>collectively that I do think pose a security threat. And, and I think.</p>
<p>You got to stop right there, Saks. Actually, an individual&rsquo;s data could absolutely be compromised</p>
<p>if they have access to your passwords, because through the clipboard, they have access to your</p>
<p>phone roll. If a young person had photos that were, say, compromising in their photo roll,</p>
<p>the phone is, you know, basically given access to that, they upload that.</p>
<p>Now you could use that as compromise against a senator&rsquo;s child or against a senator themselves.</p>
<p>And this seems like an abstract thing, but this is exactly what the Chinese and Russians have been</p>
<p>doing for a very long time. If you&rsquo;ve seen the series, The Americans, and you go back to the 80s</p>
<p>to see the weaponization of, you know, somebody who was in the closet, who was gay during that</p>
<p>time, or somebody who was having an extramarital affair, you could compromise anybody with just</p>
<p>sexual compromise. And you hear we&rsquo;re giving access to hundreds of millions of people&rsquo;s photo</p>
<p>libraries, by the way, clipboards, by the way, you just said something that&rsquo;s really scary,</p>
<p>which is like, if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re the Chinese, and you know, they have the patience to play the</p>
<p>long game. You just aggregate and collect this thing for 30 years, on the off chance that one</p>
<p>of these people becomes important. I mean, what is the real terrain candidate just you just surveil</p>
<p>300 million Americans and just say, you know what, we&rsquo;ll take our shot. I mean, it&rsquo;s going to cost</p>
<p>us a few billion dollars a year in storage, who cares? Yeah, I&rsquo;m not like, is there really a case</p>
<p>that what they&rsquo;re doing in the tick tock app? I don&rsquo;t know how much you guys have read some of</p>
<p>the studies on on what they are actually pulling. But is there really a case that what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pulling is particularly different than what would be pulled by pretty much any other social app or</p>
<p>photo sharing app on your phone. There was some, you know, kind of insight that, hey, they were</p>
<p>capturing the MAC address. But that was up until last November, after November, they the app kind</p>
<p>of refresh and stopped doing that. And it was a hack that some number of apps out there were already</p>
<p>doing. But my understanding is the way that they&rsquo;ve built the app, it&rsquo;s the same kind of</p>
<p>ad tracking type approach that a lot of apps are taking. I think it is a naive position that because</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t caught them doing something nefarious that they aren&rsquo;t actually doing something nefarious</p>
<p>right now. If you look at what MBS did to Jeff Bezos, sending that, I guess it was a movie file</p>
<p>or an image that then wound up hacking his WeChat and his phone. Like, I think they&rsquo;ve built the</p>
<p>software. I think it&rsquo;s purpose built, whether it&rsquo;s WeChat or tick tock to have these back doors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way the Chinese government is not influencing that, guys. Look, if you if you had</p>
<p>to bet David, what do you think the odds are between zero and 100 with 100 being absolute</p>
<p>certainty that there are foreign national spies that work at Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point. It&rsquo;s is it? I mean, look, I think that there are no, but do you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 100%? Oh, of course. It&rsquo;s 100. Yeah, I think at every one of them. It&rsquo;s probably 100%. Yeah,</p>
<p>at least one, you know, for national that has a connection to intelligence in China. Yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably 100%. 100%. So my point is, tick tock is 100. Chinese 100% Chinese. So you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have to guess whether it&rsquo;s my point is, like, if there is some, you know, access to</p>
<p>personal data that we&rsquo;re all concerned about being compromised at literally every other</p>
<p>fucking app company. Yeah, every app is not connected to, you know, the point that Chamath</p>
<p>just made is that they very well could be the fact is, we as individuals have exposed all of</p>
<p>our personal and private data to six or seven companies. I think you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;d be really</p>
<p>right thing. It is a this is a canary in the coal mine for a bigger issue. This is why I&rsquo;m saying I</p>
<p>think that, you know, Trump is probably acting out of an expression of power. But I think what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re realizing is actually this is about core fundamental privacy and the safety and security</p>
<p>of each of us as individuals. And it should start a bigger conversation like privacy. I really do</p>
<p>think this privacy is the killer feature of the 2020. Right. You know, what David just said about</p>
<p>like, you know, if you&rsquo;re, if you&rsquo;re a Chinese ex national, the idea that you&rsquo;re like, look, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been a citizen of three countries, the idea that the Sri Lankan government all of a sudden may not</p>
<p>like what I have to say and can spy on me or, you know, root my phone or steal my data. It really</p>
<p>disturbs me like, I&rsquo;m sorry, but no, go fuck yourself. Like I left that country for a reason.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I think I think the Republican to watch on this is, well, besides Trump, I guess,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s Senator Josh Hawley, who is crazy. Well, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s sort of a critic of big tech.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s got some interesting things to say. But, but in this particular area,</p>
<p>he is proposing legislation to regulate the types of information that can be collected by</p>
<p>applications that are based in countries that are fundamentally hostile or adversarial to the US.</p>
<p>And that, to me, seems like the right policy, because, you know, it&rsquo;s not just about TikTok,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about all the apps that collect information on Americans that can be appropriated by,</p>
<p>you know, the Chinese Communist Party or Russia or Iran, places like that. And so,</p>
<p>I think we need a more holistic policy here than just banning TikTok. And it may not be necessary</p>
<p>to ban TikTok, if you had the right limitations placed on them. But, but I do think this,</p>
<p>this whole sort of compromise solution with Larry Ellison and Oracle, that makes no sense to me,</p>
<p>this idea that, you know, Ellison will own 20% of the company, but nothing else really changes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll still be based in China, a Chinese company will still be Chinese engineers based in China,</p>
<p>who, you know, and they still own 80% of it. I mean, how does that really address the data</p>
<p>security issue?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think, David, that that&rsquo;s just basically a way of just, it&rsquo;s a wealth transfer to Larry</p>
<p>Ellison, which I think is amazing. I mean, if I could do it, I would do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s ByteDance. It&rsquo;s ByteDance paying political protection money to Larry Ellison</p>
<p>to be their bodyguard in this political process. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to fly. I mean,</p>
<p>Hawley has already said that it&rsquo;s not good enough for him. And so even if, I think,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t live up to Trump stated criteria, even though he seems to be supporting it.</p>
<p>Is this ultimately a CFIUS ruling, Sax? Is that who&rsquo;s going to make the final call on this? Or</p>
<p>does Trump have sole executive kind of authority on foreign security, on security grounds to kind</p>
<p>of block it? Does it go to CFIUS?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s a good question. I think CFIUS disapproves M&amp;A, right?</p>
<p>It has to approve it. Yeah. I mean, so you&rsquo;re right. I mean,</p>
<p>there are members of Congress that are all going to need to be convinced to get this thing done.</p>
<p>Well, but CFIUS approves M&amp;A. I didn&rsquo;t think they could like block applications.</p>
<p>As of last year, every investment triggers CFIUS. It&rsquo;s a weird new thing that happened.</p>
<p>I was involved in a company recently.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that seems secondary to the national security power that&hellip;</p>
<p>That Trump may have.</p>
<p>So this is almost like a two-tier kind of thing. One is for Trump to be cool with it,</p>
<p>national security terms. And then second is the antitrust issues.</p>
<p>If we just go back a second, talking about the broad, as Chamath called it,</p>
<p>kind of this canary in a coal mine. I don&rsquo;t know how many of you guys use an Amazon Echo,</p>
<p>or a Google Home, or Amazon Fire TV, or Nest thermostat. Every single one of them has ambient</p>
<p>audio listening on it. Every single one of them, even&hellip; And another thing people don&rsquo;t realize is</p>
<p>every speaker is actually a microphone as well as a speaker. You can actually listen on any</p>
<p>house speaker, whether it&rsquo;s a Sonos device or what have you. And so we&rsquo;ve got&hellip; Our homes</p>
<p>are already wired. Amazon Fire TV runs on fucking Android. I mean, there&rsquo;s 100 ways into your home,</p>
<p>as it is. It seems to me like there&rsquo;s a significant concern about how much data we</p>
<p>are already exposing that&rsquo;s being highlighted here. I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s sort</p>
<p>of like playing where you try and pop the hamsters in the game. It&rsquo;s like at some point,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to realize these things are here everywhere. And it&rsquo;s not just a company, but it</p>
<p>is how we are living our lives now and how technology is kind of capturing every piece</p>
<p>of information about everything we do. This is&hellip; I go back to this. Somebody will take this,</p>
<p>or many people will take this and run with it. But I think that there is an enormous amount of money</p>
<p>that consumers will pay for the assurance of anonymity and privacy. I don&rsquo;t really know how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s expressed, David, but for example, if I could get a phone that was completely locked down</p>
<p>and encrypted and- Like a burner phone is what you&rsquo;re talking about. And a lot of people are</p>
<p>now doing this. They take a second phone, they put a VP. VPNs are the first step. And you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing VPNs becoming very popular. Well, I try to use Signal. I try to</p>
<p>use FaceTime audio. I&rsquo;ll even use WhatsApp now just because these things are end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>And I have nothing particularly important or interesting to say or hide, but I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like the idea that in the open wild, I just feel very vulnerable to data breaches more than any</p>
<p>other kind of breach. I mean, I had this conversation with somebody that was sort of</p>
<p>helping me lock down my Wi-Fi network. And for a long time, I only had one endpoint. And all of a</p>
<p>sudden, he&rsquo;s like, look, let&rsquo;s have a home and a guest. But in that conversation, what he was</p>
<p>saying is the biggest form of theft isn&rsquo;t like burglaries anymore. It&rsquo;s basically people just</p>
<p>having packet sniffers outside your house because they can get access to everything and anything.</p>
<p>And- Can I ask you a question? There&rsquo;s a book by a guy named Stephen Baxter. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>science fiction book from years ago and Arthur Clarke called The Light of Other Days. And these</p>
<p>guys developed a wormhole technology. They could put it in any house, and they could see and listen</p>
<p>to everything. And suddenly, the technology became kind of ubiquitous. So everyone could create a</p>
<p>wormhole anywhere and see and hear everything. So effectively, information was completely</p>
<p>transferable and free and available to everyone. And the book kind of highlights how society</p>
<p>changed in that context. So in a world where you see where everyone is and what everyone is doing</p>
<p>and saying, there&rsquo;s no longer any notion of information asymmetry. And the way people operate</p>
<p>and behave changes because so much of our life is dependent on people not knowing things about us</p>
<p>that we know. So when you&rsquo;re good, when your employee is going to go interview for another job,</p>
<p>and they tell you they&rsquo;re going to the dentist, you can say like, hey, that&rsquo;s not true. And the</p>
<p>guy says, you know what, I&rsquo;m actually thinking about looking for another job because I hate</p>
<p>working for you. You suck. So everyone starts changing kind of how they behave. Do you think</p>
<p>that 50 years from now, that&rsquo;s where the world heads? Do you really think it&rsquo;s possible to stop</p>
<p>this train in its tracks and not end up in a world of what I would call kind of like hyper</p>
<p>transparency, where all information becomes kind of because it&rsquo;s already being collected</p>
<p>everywhere about everyone, and it&rsquo;s only I think it&rsquo;s rising exponentially, people are going to</p>
<p>start, I think that people are going to start turning their homes into like those skiffs,</p>
<p>you know, sensitive, compartmented information facilities, you always hear about like senators</p>
<p>going into the skiff kind of situation for private stuff. I think like people are going to start</p>
<p>taking this very seriously, as they get compromised, you know, time after time,</p>
<p>and embarrassing. And you can see with Apple making it their marketing strategy, Apple&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t think society changes? Oh, I think it&rsquo;s already changed already</p>
<p>with like people getting their phones hacked. And they&rsquo;re, you know, news being leaked,</p>
<p>people are now begin to normalize that. I think it makes the world a much shittier place,</p>
<p>because it basically robs us of our own independence and our fundamental right to</p>
<p>privacy. And I just think that&rsquo;s a really bad outcome. And so you know what, like, if like,</p>
<p>the need for likes, and tweets, and followers, leads me to a place where I lose privacy,</p>
<p>I would just say shut them all down now. Because I think that people&rsquo;s self worth is much bigger</p>
<p>than what they understand it to be if they&rsquo;re willing to make that trade off.</p>
<p>But yeah, most people appreciate that.</p>
<p>Well, I would also, I would also just add that just because there&rsquo;s more transparency doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean that it serves the interests of truth. Like Jason said earlier, this information can be used</p>
<p>to create, you know, ops, you know, and manipulate and, you know, it&rsquo;s, and so, yeah, I don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>know, like, like Trotsky said, just because you&rsquo;re not interested in war doesn&rsquo;t mean war</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t interested in you. I mean, this data can be collected to run operations on people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t serve, you know, the interests of greater transparency or the truth.</p>
<p>I think I think people don&rsquo;t think from first principles on this topic, this is sort of like</p>
<p>the idiotic orthodoxy of Silicon Valley, which is like they, they wrap themselves in the flag</p>
<p>of transparency, like it means something, but they have no real idea what it really means</p>
<p>at scale and at the limit. And, you know, there&rsquo;s one thing about getting access to a</p>
<p>fucking looker dashboard, who cares, you know, and, but the word transparency is used for that</p>
<p>the same way that it&rsquo;s used for David, exactly what you just said. And they&rsquo;re two completely</p>
<p>different things. They have completely different meanings and the latter&rsquo;s implications are so</p>
<p>much more important. And we need to think about this from first principles because I think people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inherent identity as human beings ultimately gets put at risk over time.</p>
<p>It should absolutely be the case that these social networks or anybody collecting data</p>
<p>gives an op, this is the way I would form the legislation. If you are running a service like</p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, Google for free, and you&rsquo;re monetizing through advertising, you must provide</p>
<p>a subscription. So for example, if Facebook makes $80 per person,</p>
<p>you lost, you lost this monetization, Jason. Sorry. I think let&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Next segment, next segment, next segment,</p>
<p>all right. Well, just as we wrap up here on this segment, Kevin Systrom, he&rsquo;s in the running,</p>
<p>apparently to take over for TikTok. Is that a good idea, Saks? I think you know Systrom.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a pretty, it&rsquo;s a dumb idea unless the company literally becomes an American company. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;ve made this point in the context of Kevin Mayer. Like if he&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>for ByteDance, he&rsquo;s working for the ByteDance board directors, which reports to the CCP.</p>
<p>Why would someone who&rsquo;s in his position want to sacrifice his independence to do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, it makes no sense. I mean, this is becoming the big test on everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>moral compass, especially Hollywood, which is changing the ending of movies to satisfy the</p>
<p>CCP. Like literally the people who are the biggest virtue signals in the world, celebrities,</p>
<p>Hollywood. China knows how to use its market access. We don&rsquo;t. We just threw open our markets</p>
<p>to their products, which caused us to lose our whole industrial manufacturing capacity.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t demand anything really in exchange for that. Whereas in order to get access to China,</p>
<p>you have to say and do the right things or certainly to not criticize them. And so they</p>
<p>know how to use, as we saw with the NBA and the whole Daryl Morey thing, they know how to use</p>
<p>their market access. All right, well, let&rsquo;s go on to the economy here. We&rsquo;ve been sheltering in place</p>
<p>essentially for six months. And now people are starting to talk about, hey, maybe we need to do</p>
<p>another lockdown. And obviously, this economic challenge is being felt very differently. In some</p>
<p>places, it&rsquo;s an opportunity. Obviously, a lot of people with SaaS software and people who work</p>
<p>behind keyboards are having a renaissance and a lot of the economy is pouring into their keyboards</p>
<p>while restaurants, retail, and anybody who has to work in the real world is part of what&rsquo;s becoming</p>
<p>essentially a permanent unemployed class that perhaps this is starting to look like a dry run</p>
<p>of UBI. What are your thoughts, Chamath, on this permanent unemployment situation?</p>
<p>I have a bunch of thoughts here. Let me just go kind of give you the stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>Jerome Powell gave a speech, I think it was two or three weeks ago, in Jackson Hole</p>
<p>and he basically said like, look, the Federal Reserve is taking a completely new posture on</p>
<p>rates. And they basically clarified that in explicit detail just a few days ago. And they</p>
<p>basically said we&rsquo;re keeping rates where they are until at least 2023. My personal views for rates</p>
<p>are going to stay basically at zero for the next half decade. And I think it&rsquo;s probably pretty</p>
<p>likely that we&rsquo;re going to see rates stay at zero probably a full decade. So what does that mean?</p>
<p>Okay, well, in a typical recession, what happens is you don&rsquo;t know where the bottom is, right?</p>
<p>Things sort of decay, they get a little bit worse, they get a little bit worse,</p>
<p>they get a little bit worse, then things bottom out and then you start to grow. And you can use</p>
<p>interest rate policy to kind of help navigate how soft the landing is as well as how fast the</p>
<p>recovery is. That&rsquo;s sort of like classic economics and how bankers and the markets and all these</p>
<p>folks used to work and it eventually would trickle into Main Street. Now, we just have none of those</p>
<p>things. We have rates zero, they&rsquo;re not going to go anywhere, they&rsquo;re not going to go up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably not going to go down, they&rsquo;re going to kind of just stay where they are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing. Second is we priced in the bottom, which was the first month of the coronavirus,</p>
<p>we took the markets basically assuming, oh, there&rsquo;s no growth. And now we&rsquo;ve priced things</p>
<p>back as if they&rsquo;ll recover. The rating agencies are out to lunch. They basically said, you know</p>
<p>what, I&rsquo;m going to look out till 2021 or 2022, give me a reason to justify not to downgrade you</p>
<p>so that you can continue to raise more debt, which by the way, is free. So you have all these dynamics</p>
<p>where I think the capital markets are in an expansive mood and an expansive mode. And in that,</p>
<p>I actually think there&rsquo;s a real bid to employment because there isn&rsquo;t really that many ways now you</p>
<p>can without just getting completely ripped apart, put money to work. And so the real earnest capital</p>
<p>allocation strategy that&rsquo;s left for most CEOs is to actually buy things, invest in things,</p>
<p>try more things, and all of those I think lead to net employment. So in general, I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>constructive and bullish. And I don&rsquo;t think that this idea that there&rsquo;s a permanent unemployment</p>
<p>class sticks around.</p>
<p>Freiburg, what are your thoughts? Obviously, a lot of Americans work in retail.</p>
<p>We obviously have all these restaurant workers who are out of work and travel is now hitting</p>
<p>the end of the furloughs at a lot of these different airlines, et cetera. What&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>thought on this unemployment, middle America catastrophe?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think happiness comes from absolute standards of living. I think happiness arises</p>
<p>from one&rsquo;s relative standard of living, whether that&rsquo;s relative to how you lived last year or</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re living relative to your neighbor. And seeing some progression over time is the</p>
<p>only thing that keeps people happy. Otherwise, society decays. So the notion of some sort of</p>
<p>flatlined or even flatlined and inflation adjusted basic income level for a large number</p>
<p>of people will inevitably result in kind of what we&rsquo;re trying to prevent, which is some sort of</p>
<p>societal decay. We have to resolve the opportunity framework for people,</p>
<p>which is how do you give people an opportunity to kind of progress in their lives</p>
<p>and earn more over time and have access to doing more with themselves while they&rsquo;re here on planet</p>
<p>earth? I mean, that&rsquo;s just what humans need. So, you know, maybe there&rsquo;s a short term fix,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;ve got some structural things to fix to kind of enable opportunities and give people</p>
<p>kind of an inherent, you know, kind of step ladder in life. I heard a really dark theory a few years</p>
<p>ago, which is if we do this, we&rsquo;re going to resolve to a world where we&rsquo;re going to have a</p>
<p>bunch of people playing video games, because then the only way you can get people to feel like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re progressing in their lives is to give them more medals on their video games and give</p>
<p>them a higher ranking and score. And that&rsquo;s where society kind of gets to, to kind of keep people</p>
<p>psychologically kind of satiated. And it&rsquo;s a pretty dark, you know, sad place if that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>we end up. It&rsquo;s like a bad episode of Black Mirror, but we&rsquo;ve had a few episodes of Black Mirror this</p>
<p>year. So, you know, we&rsquo;ll see. It sounds like Ready Player One, where the masters were playing</p>
<p>video games instead of actually going out in the real world. That&rsquo;s right. Totally. Sax, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your thought on, you know, just the next two years, let&rsquo;s say, and how this all shakes out?</p>
<p>And this will give us a good segue into the coronavirus and where we stand right now with</p>
<p>this potential second lockdown and the impact that might have psychologically on people</p>
<p>and also on the economy. There&rsquo;s not going to be a second lockdown. It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And even if there were, people aren&rsquo;t going to support it. Certainly any of the red states</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to do it. I guess the blue states may, they still haven&rsquo;t, you know, sort of unlocked</p>
<p>down. So maybe that gets more protracted in places like California, but we&rsquo;re not going to go back</p>
<p>into lockdowns and people won&rsquo;t support it. And I think the thing that we&rsquo;ve basically figured out</p>
<p>that should have been obvious months ago now is that coronavirus is really like two different</p>
<p>diseases in terms of its effects on people. So for elderly people and for people with risk factors,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very dangerous. You know, I&rsquo;m very worried about my parents. And, you know, for people in</p>
<p>that group, they have to take, you know, extreme precautions. But for young, healthy people without</p>
<p>risk factors, it&rsquo;s not been that deadly. It&rsquo;s very unpleasant. It&rsquo;s a very bad two weeks.</p>
<p>But, you know, for example, if you look at the data now on colleges coming back,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some reports that the virus is spreading like wildfire on college campuses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. But hospitalizations and deaths have not gone up. And so because it&rsquo;s just not that</p>
<p>deadly to younger people. And so I think this idea of shutting down the whole economy to protect</p>
<p>people at risk just seems like overkill. And I think if we had to do it all over again,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have done lockdowns. We just would have protected at risk people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve still consistently had a thousand deaths a day. We thought this might go</p>
<p>down. What are your thoughts on Americans just being okay with that basic death toll, Sax?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, any death is obviously bad and tragic. And, you know, and statistically,</p>
<p>there are going to be people who die even who are in the, you know, low risk group. So for sure. But,</p>
<p>you know, but we&rsquo;ve had about 200,000 deaths. The original estimates from this virus were</p>
<p>two to 3 million. So it&rsquo;s, I guess my point is not that it&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s, you know, much less deadly than I think was originally thought.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an argument that that&rsquo;s not deaths directly attributable to coronavirus,</p>
<p>right? And that the vast majority of those folks had comorbidities. And that, you know,</p>
<p>the primary driver, this is an argument many have made, I&rsquo;m not gonna take a strong point.</p>
<p>But, you know, 85% plus of folks have significant comorbidities. And, you know, this virus maybe</p>
<p>kind of has a contributing factor to their death. But if let&rsquo;s assume everyone in the United States</p>
<p>had coronavirus today, then every death that was reported today would be reported as a coronavirus</p>
<p>death. And so they&rsquo;re testing a lot of folks, you know, in the hospital finding that they have</p>
<p>coronavirus. It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s very difficult to then prove that the reason that they died or</p>
<p>the sole reason that they died was coronavirus. If you had to pick a percentage, Friedberg,</p>
<p>where would you put it? Half of all deaths? If you just had to guess?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my point is I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s one thing, right? I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s someone</p>
<p>goes into the hospital with coronavirus. And they&rsquo;ve also got severe diabetes, heart disease,</p>
<p>cancer. They&rsquo;re on chemotherapy. I mean, you could list the other things that they might have.</p>
<p>What caused their death, you know, you can&rsquo;t as a corner, it&rsquo;s very difficult to say this one thing</p>
<p>caused the death. But when they test that person, and they find that their coronavirus positive,</p>
<p>they are that number is now being counted in the statistics that say that was a coronavirus death</p>
<p>that day. And coronavirus is so prevalent in the United States right now. It&rsquo;s such a significant</p>
<p>part of the population. It&rsquo;s also very difficult to say, hey, guys, like, you know, these deaths</p>
<p>are. So I&rsquo;m not trying to belittle the fact that people are absolutely dying. And they wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have died if not for coronavirus. That is absolutely happening. But it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to say what is the net effect on life right now. We&rsquo;re still learning a lot about how this virus</p>
<p>interacts with different people based on their genetics, and based on their disease state and</p>
<p>other factors. Let me ask you one more way for you, Freeberg, and then I&rsquo;ll give it over to Chamath,</p>
<p>which is Freeberg, in your estimation, as a scientist, and somebody who&rsquo;s a, I would say,</p>
<p>a man of science on the call here. Are you optimistic about us coming out of coronavirus</p>
<p>in 2021? And what&rsquo;s your best outlook for a return to normalcy if you had to pick a time</p>
<p>when it feels like we can go to a Warriors game or play cards regularly, or go to the World Series</p>
<p>of Poker? Wendy, do you have a time period where you think that could possibly happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all politics and social behavior. It has nothing to do with science. Like after 9-11,</p>
<p>there were no more serious terrorist attacks on the United States. But our fucking lives</p>
<p>changed dramatically. We go sit in TSA lines and get our asses swabbed when we get on an airplane</p>
<p>now. And that&rsquo;s still going on 20 years later. So I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s a lot of change that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here to stay in the US because of coronavirus, and will be even after everyone gets vaccines,</p>
<p>and the deaths drop below 10 a day, and yada yada. So I&rsquo;m not convinced that this is like,</p>
<p>hey, here&rsquo;s the date, we&rsquo;re all going to be out of it, and then we&rsquo;re safe. Because people are</p>
<p>psychologically scarred. Behavior has changed, businesses have changed, the landscape of how</p>
<p>we work as a society has changed, and that&rsquo;s not going away. So it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>back. I think it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re going forward into a different world where we operate differently,</p>
<p>much as what happened after 9-11. What&rsquo;s your take on that, Shama?</p>
<p>I think that David&rsquo;s right that, you know, were it but for coronavirus, I think a lot of these</p>
<p>people that died would still be alive. And so, you know, I don&rsquo;t think it really matters how</p>
<p>much of the blame we&rsquo;re trying to ascribe to it. It&rsquo;s just that it was a meaningful,</p>
<p>non-trivial contributing factor. So these deaths are avoidable, and we have to deal with that.</p>
<p>The second is, I don&rsquo;t think what we know what the peak to trough looks like because we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really gone through a real full-blown flu season yet. You know, coronavirus came to America at the</p>
<p>tail end of the winter. And it&rsquo;s going to be, I think, tough to figure out what it&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>in October, November, December, January, or February when it&rsquo;s really cold in many parts</p>
<p>of the United States. And, you know, whatever effects, again, we still don&rsquo;t know it in</p>
<p>totality, but whatever effects the warm weather had in muting it or whatever mutation muted it</p>
<p>may change. So I tend to think it&rsquo;s another 18 to 24 months of this posture. But Friedberg is</p>
<p>really right, which is like this is what&rsquo;s so sad, which is when you could point a finger</p>
<p>and look at somebody and say, you, you&rsquo;re the cause, it was much easier to react and create</p>
<p>rules and create boundaries as uncomfortable or as inconvenient as they were and live by them.</p>
<p>And because this is more nameless and faceless, it&rsquo;s impossible. So‚Ä¶</p>
<p>All right. Well, here&rsquo;s some good news I was able to acquire. I&rsquo;ve been on a little investigative</p>
<p>journalism kick, asking people if they have access to rapid testing kits, i.e. they have</p>
<p>them in Korea. And I was able to get, and I&rsquo;m curious your thoughts on this, Friedberg,</p>
<p>the rapid response Liberty COVID-19 IgG slash IgM test cassettes. And they cost 15 to 20 bucks each,</p>
<p>and they take 10 minutes. They&rsquo;re easy to use. I mean, I&rsquo;ve had those since March,</p>
<p>and they cost 50 cents each. So‚Ä¶ So these are now officially available, though,</p>
<p>in the United States. You had those from some other country, correct?</p>
<p>I got from China, and I got from the US, and I got from Korea. And these things are just made</p>
<p>everywhere. And they&rsquo;re like, these are the antibody tests, right?</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s a paper that was published at UCSF. I got an acknowledgement because of my</p>
<p>donations to support the research. And it showed that these tests have actually very good specificity,</p>
<p>and the sensitivity is going to be, call it 85%. But these are antibody tests. And further research</p>
<p>has shown that not everyone has the same antibody response after getting infected. And there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>relationship between how severe the disease is for you and various other factors. So‚Ä¶ And these will</p>
<p>only show up typically, you know, days to weeks after you get infected. The antigen tests, which</p>
<p>are the more common kind of ones that everyone&rsquo;s looking for now, are these tests that can actually</p>
<p>find the virus itself. And so they&rsquo;ll take a swab of your nose or some saliva from your mouth and</p>
<p>see if there&rsquo;s any virus in there. And it&rsquo;s a much, much lower sensitivity than the PCR test,</p>
<p>which is the expensive, you know, lab test. But it can be done on a stick, and it&rsquo;s a good enough</p>
<p>thing for letting people into, say, a football game. And a good friend of ours just texted me</p>
<p>and told me that they&rsquo;re doing this at the UT Austin game. They&rsquo;re using this antigen test</p>
<p>to let people into the football game today, so‚Ä¶ Or this weekend. So it&rsquo;s getting kind of more</p>
<p>widespread use. And so when we have those tests at scales, what will the world look like, Freeberg?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. You&rsquo;ll‚Ä¶ Just like the TSA, you&rsquo;ll get swabbed. And, you know, these things‚Ä¶ It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great business to be in, by the way, if you guys, you know, want to SPAC a Korean antigen test</p>
<p>business. These things are going to sell like crazy. There&rsquo;s a company that I heard of through</p>
<p>a friend which had‚Ä¶ It&rsquo;s an Israeli company. I never followed up on it, which was effectively a</p>
<p>breathalyzer, which would be‚Ä¶ Could you just imagine? That would be incredible, right? You</p>
<p>just breathe in a few seconds. We&rsquo;ve talked about this in our chat group. There are startups like</p>
<p>was it Quidel, Amodius, Q, who&rsquo;ve got these little, you know, $200, $300 little handheld</p>
<p>readers and the cartridges are basically mouth swabs or lower nasal swabs, you know, cost 10</p>
<p>bucks. And I think, you know, I think they&rsquo;re going to be rolling out over the next few months.</p>
<p>And assuming we can scale the production of them, I think they will be everywhere.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be a government mandated thing. So I don&rsquo;t think the government</p>
<p>will get its act together, but it&rsquo;ll be the kind of thing where you go shopping at a store or</p>
<p>whatever, and there&rsquo;ll be early adopters or a restaurant. They&rsquo;ll start using it. People will</p>
<p>realize, well, wait, I don&rsquo;t want to get swabbed three times a day. So then they&rsquo;ll get some sort</p>
<p>of like receipt or voucher they can take with them to the next place. And so I think, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like actually like, I think I&rsquo;m more optimistic than you guys about COVID right now. I think that</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s because of these rapid tests or because of treatments coming, or just this</p>
<p>fundamental fact about comorbidities, again, not absolving, not saying that COVID isn&rsquo;t serious,</p>
<p>but the fact that we&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s, you know, that it&rsquo;s really deadly, primarily for</p>
<p>people who have comorbidities. I think for all of these reasons, I think COVID is going to be</p>
<p>a distant memory by next summer. I really do. I think-</p>
<p>Behaviorally too?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Do you think behavior changes as well, like businesses and movie theaters?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think people will largely be back to what they were doing last summer or by next summer.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to have like, you know, call it a six month period where, you know,</p>
<p>we do these rapid tests just to make sure. But I think as the case rate starts dropping off,</p>
<p>things will kind of revert back to where they were. I mean, the question to ask is kind of,</p>
<p>you know, which trends were there before COVID and have been accelerated? Like I would say</p>
<p>the move from like death of retail, the shift to e-commerce, that feels to me like it&rsquo;s here to</p>
<p>stay. But, you know, food delivery, things like that. But there was no trend of people not going</p>
<p>to sports games anymore. You know, and I think like stuff like that will just snap right back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know about you guys. I&rsquo;m still like feeling fucked up by the whole thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really realize how much your psychology has changed until you kind of reflect on</p>
<p>decisions and behaviors. Like there&rsquo;s still a fear factor that I think needs to kind of be</p>
<p>ironed out. But, you know, we&rsquo;ll see how long it takes for people. It&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so different when you&rsquo;re so used to just waking up and hopping on Zoom for work and</p>
<p>avoiding people and putting a mask on when you go walk your fucking dog. I mean, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to kind of change out of that overnight.</p>
<p>Well, I think this idea of the greater flexibility around working arrangements,</p>
<p>ability to work from home, I think offices will become a little bit more like co-working spaces</p>
<p>for a single company where people come in three days a week and work from home a couple days a</p>
<p>week. I think there&rsquo;ll be a permanent flexibility. But I also think that people want to get back to</p>
<p>back to offices and they want to interact with people. And I think everyone&rsquo;s going to be excited</p>
<p>to do that again. It&rsquo;s not like everyone&rsquo;s just going to be working from home forever.</p>
<p>So I think, again, next summer is kind of my date for when things are back to normal.</p>
<p>Well, this has been certainly driving a lot of our politics right now. You probably saw</p>
<p>the book that came out with the tapes of Trump saying that he was trying to play it down,</p>
<p>Sachs as a lifelong Republican. What were your thoughts when the Republican presidential</p>
<p>candidate, the Republican president said, hey, I&rsquo;m trying to play this down when he was at the</p>
<p>same time saying it was deadly serious? Does that make you worry about Trump as a candidate? And</p>
<p>what do you think that&rsquo;s going to, how that might play into the election? It must have been</p>
<p>disappointing for you to hear your candidate Trump say at the same time, this is deadly and</p>
<p>I want to play it down. Well, Trump&rsquo;s leadership on this has been a little bit erratic for sure.</p>
<p>And by the way, let&rsquo;s go back and remind the viewers here that in the first pods we were</p>
<p>doing back in April, I think we kind of nailed what the right policy response should be. I wrote</p>
<p>a blog on April 2nd talking about that mass should be required, that that was the right response.</p>
<p>But we also said that lockdowns, very quickly after the start of lockdown said that it was</p>
<p>excessive and that what we should do is be going all in on mass, not lockdowns.</p>
<p>I certainly would have liked to have seen Trump get that right several months earlier. That being</p>
<p>said, let&rsquo;s not forget everybody else who got this stuff wrong too. I mean, you look at CDC</p>
<p>or WHO, we had talked about this in our previous pod. I mean, WHO was also unclear about mass and</p>
<p>Fauci, I guess, now retroactively saying that he didn&rsquo;t think that mass were necessary because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to prevent a run on supplies. I mean, the whole response of the healthcare</p>
<p>establishment, they were all like really bad. And so, I have a greater degree of forgiveness</p>
<p>for people who made mistakes back in March or April. But what I think is hard to forgive now</p>
<p>are these people who are promoting the wrong policies now that we know so much more.</p>
<p>And I mean, at this point, I think that COVID policy is a net plus for Trump in this campaign</p>
<p>because the other side of it is these permanent lockdowns. There&rsquo;s just an article in foreign</p>
<p>policy saying that we need to go back to lockdowns. And I think Biden&rsquo;s said that we need to have</p>
<p>lockdowns again. And his policy would be to listen to the experts, but all these experts, again,</p>
<p>were wrong about so many things. And so, again, I think this idea of permanent lockdowns,</p>
<p>if that is the alternative to Trump, will help Trump win.</p>
<p>And so, you don&rsquo;t think that this Woodward book and that kind of stuff plays into the election</p>
<p>or the debates in the coming weeks? I think it&rsquo;s sort of priced into the stock.</p>
<p>I mean, look, if it weren&rsquo;t for COVID, I think that if you go back to like January, February,</p>
<p>when Trump gave that State of the Union speech, his ratings were the highest they had been,</p>
<p>the economy was on fire. It looked like he was on cruise control to winning re-election,</p>
<p>and then COVID happened and his ratings went down to their lowest point. And so, I think he already</p>
<p>paid the price for the, let&rsquo;s call it inconsistent leadership that Woodward described. So, I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s priced in. And now the question is if the economy gets good enough, fast enough,</p>
<p>and the other side is on the side of lockdowns and Trump is on the side of reopening,</p>
<p>again, I think COVID policy becomes a net plus for him.</p>
<p>Chamatha, 538 has in its simulation 77 wins and 100 for Biden. You think that&rsquo;s accurate?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think that until the debates, I think that this thing is basically where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been for a long time. And if Biden flubs the debate and basically comes out as</p>
<p>intellectually too inconsistent to be voted in by a plurality of Americans, he&rsquo;s done for and</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s going to win. So, he can&rsquo;t have these verbal gaffes and basically seem like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a senile octogenarian. If he does come off that way, he&rsquo;s going to lose. But if he doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>look, many of the moments you see him now, he&rsquo;s actually pretty crisp.</p>
<p>That probably gets the job done. Because like I said, I think more people just want a</p>
<p>non-Trump alternative than want the Trump alternative, even within the Republican Party.</p>
<p>And look, preference falsification can cut both ways. All the people that said they weren&rsquo;t going</p>
<p>to vote for him but then did, there&rsquo;s also probably a cohort of people that now feel</p>
<p>obligated when they came out of the woodwork as supporting him. Now, they just feel like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easier to be publicly supporting him, but then they may go the other way. So, it all works in</p>
<p>both directions. But I still think on the margin, Biden is the favorite.</p>
<p>How different will the world look, Chamath, in your estimation,</p>
<p>under a Biden presidency? We get to January 1st, how different does the country feel? Is it going</p>
<p>to be some great relief? Is it going to be some great joy like when Obama won?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>What do you think the feeling is in the country and the reality is?</p>
<p>No, all these things are emotional overreactions in both directions. The reality is that if you</p>
<p>actually graft substantive policy that affects your everyday life, the magnitude of the impact</p>
<p>of the presidency has been shrinking since the 1980s. I think the most impactful president of</p>
<p>our lifetimes, our lifetimes, so 70s onwards, was Reagan. And it&rsquo;s basically been decaying ever</p>
<p>since. And so, I think that the job of the presidency is mostly window dressing except</p>
<p>for foreign policy. That matters less and less. And I&rsquo;ll tell you why that matters less and less,</p>
<p>because all the things that the president used to really govern, like foreign policy was a byproduct</p>
<p>of a whole bunch of other things. For example, our entire posture on the Middle East, which has</p>
<p>been a fucking shit show, or our entire posture on Russia was in part because of our energy policy.</p>
<p>And in a world of sustainable energy, those entire regions are not important anymore.</p>
<p>So, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>We can let them basically fend for themselves. We do not need to be involved.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to. They&rsquo;re going to devolve because they&rsquo;re going to have to suck out all the oil out</p>
<p>of the ground to try to monetize it before wind and solar and everything else become the dominant</p>
<p>form of energy. And so, if you take energy policy off the table, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>the national security interests to care about large swaths of the world go to zero, right?</p>
<p>So, then there&rsquo;s less and less for the president to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty short, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yes. So, my point is the surface area of the impact of the president is shrinking.</p>
<p>And it shrinks as technology, like if you think about it, what is driving foreign policy and</p>
<p>national security policy changes over the last 10, 15 years, definitely over the next 40 or 50,</p>
<p>is technology, right? If we get, for example, if we get any form of like carbon sequestration</p>
<p>at scale, broadly available, you&rsquo;re going to have a complete resurgence of Western economies,</p>
<p>if that technology is invented in the United States or Western Europe.</p>
<p>Freeberg, quickly, you&rsquo;d think that Biden is going to win. And then what do you think the</p>
<p>country feels and looks like into a Biden presidency? And then let&rsquo;s move over to</p>
<p>energy and sustainable energy and carbon after that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. You know, I&rsquo;ll say the same thing I&rsquo;ve said in the past. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>the notion of a sense of relief is realistic. I don&rsquo;t think this is about,</p>
<p>people think it&rsquo;s about Trump, but Trump is the product of what it&rsquo;s all really about.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll just, you know, kind of highlight, I think, you know, Biden is a column, instead of</p>
<p>thinking about things as Democrats and Republicans and left and right, if we think about it as kind</p>
<p>of populism and free market-ism, and in the middle of centrism, you know, we&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>taking a notch towards centrism. And at the end of the day, the march towards populism seems to</p>
<p>be continuing. And, you know, whether Trump is kind of the product of that march, or maybe the</p>
<p>next one will be Elizabeth Warren or AOC, it&rsquo;s kind of the same thing, in my opinion. But I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the bigger kind of concern is, you know, how do we, again, keep, generally keep most people</p>
<p>in the United States feeling like they can progress in life, feeling like they can find</p>
<p>happiness in life, and feeling like there&rsquo;s opportunity for them to kind of, you know,</p>
<p>achieve their objectives. And if they don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re getting it, they&rsquo;re going to try and</p>
<p>wrap it all up. And unions will continue to scale and AOC will become the vice presidential</p>
<p>nominee in 2024, and yada, yada.</p>
<p>Freebird, what are your thoughts on the wildfires, global warming, and the politics of all that? And</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll go to cancel culture with you, Saxon.</p>
<p>California has 33 million acres of forest land, it&rsquo;s about 100 million acres in total land. So</p>
<p>for us to make up about a third of our land, so far, we&rsquo;re burning three and a half million,</p>
<p>so about 10% of our acres. When we burn an acre, we release about 15% of the carbon that&rsquo;s stored</p>
<p>in that acre into the atmosphere. So thus far, if you do the math on that, we&rsquo;ve released about as</p>
<p>much CO2 as we&rsquo;ve as the California cars released in a year by the wildfires, and the politics we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing play out. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a significant problem. But over the last 40 years, we&rsquo;ve added</p>
<p>about a quarter ton of carbon to each acre per year. And the reason we&rsquo;ve done that is we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>kind of, you know, lit fires and managed the forests and cut down trees. And there&rsquo;s been all</p>
<p>these restrictions in California. So there&rsquo;s an argument that some are making that this is about</p>
<p>forest management. And then there&rsquo;s an argument that others are making that this is about climate</p>
<p>change and dry weather and hot weather causing the fires. And the reality is, it&rsquo;s both. But it&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>everything else in this country right now becoming highly politicized that and you know,</p>
<p>Trump visited Newsom in a very kind of symbolic gathering this week. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys</p>
<p>saw the packet that was handed out to Trump. It was awesome. It was like 24 point font. And it</p>
<p>was like bad. Yeah. Why are good temperature weather? Fire is burning state. And it was</p>
<p>you guys got to see it. It&rsquo;s awesome. The little packet he got. And then use some sat like exactly</p>
<p>six feet from him with a mask on and Trump sitting there without the mask on. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a fucking political circus. And, you know, I think all things are true and all things</p>
<p>are false. And we can move on. Well, the debate on the fires is I mean, what it&rsquo;s the debate has</p>
<p>has become sort of climate change versus forest management. You know, that&rsquo;s sort of the debate</p>
<p>about it. And like most of these debates, you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to choose. There can be</p>
<p>an element of truth on both sides. You know, regardless of how much climate change has caused</p>
<p>these fires, we&rsquo;ve done a very, very poor job in the state managing them. And, you know, this idea</p>
<p>that we can just fix global warming and or wait, you know, not have good forest management until,</p>
<p>you know, and just kind of wait for global warming to be fixes. I mean, that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>stupid idea. So regardless of how much climate change is to the cause of this, I think we</p>
<p>need a much more competent state reaction to, you know, to the fact these fires</p>
<p>Do you believe in global warming, David Sachs? I believe in the, you know, in greenhouse,</p>
<p>the greenhouse gas theory, and that, yeah, that it&rsquo;s, you know, that manmade CO2 emissions are</p>
<p>going to have an impact on the environment. I think that, you know, what&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>hard to know is the exact timing and magnitudes of some of these things. But I agree with what</p>
<p>Elon said, which is that we&rsquo;re running a very high risk experiment here, continually putting</p>
<p>out, you know, CO2 greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Why is it so difficult for the</p>
<p>Republican Party? And I feel like you&rsquo;re almost straining and couching your words there, David,</p>
<p>that you believe in global warming, you believe in what Elon is saying, it&rsquo;s not worth doing this</p>
<p>for risk. Why do Republicans seem to have such an aversion to just saying, hey, global warming</p>
<p>is a thing, and we need to fix it? Because Democrats wrapped those words around them</p>
<p>like a flag. And so it became a political issue, like with everything else. I mean, I think,</p>
<p>so again, we have this false choice now of whether you want to save the environment or</p>
<p>save the economy. And the problem is, I think, a lot of Republicans don&rsquo;t want to concede the issue.</p>
<p>Hey, little guy. A lot of Republicans don&rsquo;t want to concede the issue, because they&rsquo;re afraid it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>lead to something like the Green New Deal. And so what we need to do is figure out some responses</p>
<p>to the problem that don&rsquo;t require us to destroy the economy. Right. And for you, if we did</p>
<p>incentives, if the country spent incentive sacks to get solar on roofs and stuff like that, you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to it, would you? You mean like taxing carbon emissions?</p>
<p>Or just giving discounts on putting solar in, subsidizing solar for people&rsquo;s houses,</p>
<p>or maybe the middle ground of creating more nuclear reactors, which seems like something</p>
<p>that neither party can agree to. Hold on, little guy. Sorry. I&rsquo;m doing a podcast, okay?</p>
<p>Sorry. No problem. Yeah. Look, I think to the extent that carbon emissions are an externality,</p>
<p>the traditional way of dealing with this is you would internalize the externality by placing</p>
<p>some sort of tax or penalty on that. But so look, would I rather tax carbon emissions than</p>
<p>something else? Yes. I mean, but the only way you&rsquo;re going to get something like that</p>
<p>through is if you agree to something like a one-for-one tax reduction in other areas,</p>
<p>right? Because there&rsquo;s this other larger debate about what else should be taxed.</p>
<p>What about you, Chamath? What are your thoughts on solving global warming and</p>
<p>this polarized sort of Republican-Democrat, if you believe in global warming, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>a Republican? I think that this is the most correlated thing with a healthy economy,</p>
<p>because I think that whoever solves climate change or the set of solutions that solve</p>
<p>climate change, first of all, they&rsquo;ll be unbelievably economically successful. They</p>
<p>will employ enormous numbers of people, and they&rsquo;ll have a really profound legacy in the world. So</p>
<p>the question is how to do it. And I think the problem is right now there&rsquo;s, as David, I think,</p>
<p>actually puts the best lens on the topic, which is right now, we don&rsquo;t even have enough canonical</p>
<p>data so that there&rsquo;s a single source of truth that we can all rely on. And not having to judge</p>
<p>it as climate change, I think, is an important step, which would just mean having a longitudinal</p>
<p>measurement of temperature. And having a longitudinal measurement of everything from</p>
<p>PM2.5 to PM10 to carbon, methane, all of the other normal sort of emissions, nitrous oxide,</p>
<p>all this stuff, so that then you can just understand what men and women as part of the</p>
<p>human race are doing to fuck with the counterfactual, because the counterfactual is if</p>
<p>we were just living normal, chill lives. And so once you understand that, then you can figure</p>
<p>out how to at least mitigate that back to what the counterfactual would have been or do it even</p>
<p>better. I think the best thing, again, we talked about this in a pod a couple of weeks ago,</p>
<p>or a couple months ago. The best thing the governments can do is introduce incentives.</p>
<p>And I think the most meaningful incentives here are not at the consumer level, but they&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>upstream. So if you take something like cement, cement, which is responsible for, I think,</p>
<p>20% of all the carbon emissions, is a really pernicious industry because they are very local.</p>
<p>They operate within 300 local kilometers of every place where you ship cement to make concrete and</p>
<p>whatnot. And when you look at sort of where the emissions are, they&rsquo;re at a very specific part</p>
<p>of the chain, which is effectively impossible to mitigate. So you have to have a level of material</p>
<p>science improvement to really move things away from cement altogether. Well, just knowing that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to have the incentives that a government creates to pull that forward. Another</p>
<p>example is when you look at manufacturing. All the shit that we all love, I don&rsquo;t care whether</p>
<p>you like fucking normal pants or hemp pants. When you go back and you look at how H&amp;M makes those</p>
<p>pants, there&rsquo;s our high temperature processes that are burning fossil fuels. They&rsquo;re emitting all</p>
<p>kinds of really terrible junk into the environment. And so it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re vegan, per</p>
<p>se. You&rsquo;re not going to go around unclothed. You&rsquo;re not going to not use spoons. So all of that,</p>
<p>the totality of all of that, we need to completely reinvent high temperature manufacturing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to happen unless the government steps in. Because for example,</p>
<p>take something as simple as steel. It&rsquo;s a tragedy of the commons, right? I mean,</p>
<p>basically, if no individual can make a major impact, maybe they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Friedberg, you think we have all the technology we need to do this, and it&rsquo;s really just a matter</p>
<p>of incentives and deployment right now in terms of global warming or stemming global warming?</p>
<p>Is that a correct statement, that we have the technology, we just haven&rsquo;t deployed it?</p>
<p>Correct. Correct. And I think it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% correct. Unpack it.</p>
<p>Well, what I will say is we have the science, the engineering, and the resourcing,</p>
<p>and then the market are the kind of unresolved, right? And so resourcing is capital. The market</p>
<p>can be created artificially by putting in place government subsidies or having the government be</p>
<p>a customer, or you just have to wait a long enough period of time. If you listen to the</p>
<p>Tim Ferriss interview with Coke, which one was it? Charles Coke. He talks about how ultimately,</p>
<p>consumers will vote with their dollars if climate change is real and global warming is starting to</p>
<p>have an effect on planet Earth. And we&rsquo;re seeing that, right? We&rsquo;re seeing people make a switch to</p>
<p>a vegetarian diet. We&rsquo;re seeing people buy Teslas. We&rsquo;re seeing people make choices for sustainability.</p>
<p>So the free market is resolving and will resolve climate change is the argument that some</p>
<p>libertarians might make. And then I think the science-</p>
<p>Is that true in your mind, Friberg? Do you buy that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s- I&rsquo;ll be honest with you. I&rsquo;ve been fucking shocked by how many people are</p>
<p>choosing to pay a premium for vegetarian meat alternatives. I was wrong on this. I bet against</p>
<p>these companies eight years ago. I didn&rsquo;t bet against them, but I chose not to bet for them</p>
<p>because I made the argument consumers will only buy stuff that&rsquo;s cheaper and taste as good. And</p>
<p>I was wrong. Millions of consumers are going to Burger King and buying a veggie burger now,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t the case. And we&rsquo;re seeing this across the world.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing this out of a crisis of consciousness, right? Like you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s a behavioral change.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Because yeah, that&rsquo;s what they want in the market. That&rsquo;s what they want to spend their</p>
<p>money on. They want to spend their money on having a nicer world. It&rsquo;s just like when people will</p>
<p>spend a premium amount of money on a nice suit, it makes them look good and feel good. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>same sort of notion. I feel good when I&rsquo;m buying a Tesla. I feel good when I&rsquo;m buying a veggie</p>
<p>burger instead of a meat burger, knowing that it is harming my people around me.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to buy a carbon-based ice engine. Recently, I was thinking about</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m in Tahoe and I need to go off-road or there&rsquo;s snow conditions, I need to have a car</p>
<p>for it. And I&rsquo;m picking up the Model Y with the dual engine and putting snow tires on it as</p>
<p>opposed to getting the new Jeep Wrangler or the new Defender.</p>
<p>But whether it&rsquo;s biomanufacturing or synthetic meats, I think we&rsquo;re not just in a point where</p>
<p>we have to create luxury markets. I think we are going to disrupt commodity markets.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re going to do that this decade. And it&rsquo;s going to blow people&rsquo;s fucking mind</p>
<p>when everything you&rsquo;re eating looks, tastes, and feels the same, and it&rsquo;s cheaper,</p>
<p>and it was just made in a more sustainable way using bioengineering, which is the ability to</p>
<p>write the physical world with software, except it&rsquo;s realized through genomics. And it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible thing that we&rsquo;re seeing now. How much of this is the generational shift?</p>
<p>I mean, Gen X seemed pretty absorbed with our own projects and a little bit of consciousness.</p>
<p>But these millennials are now getting into their 30s, and they&rsquo;re 35 years old, the oldest</p>
<p>millennials. And they seem to be incredibly focused on the environment and doing what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right. This is a generational shift in your mind, Friedberg?</p>
<p>No, I think this is just the slow march of humanity&rsquo;s ability to master our world and</p>
<p>technology. And, you know, look, let me just give you a scenario. Chamath kind of says,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to decarbonize the atmosphere. If we could build an algae or a seaweed from scratch,</p>
<p>or using some basis and use software to resolve what&rsquo;s the right sort of seaweed to create</p>
<p>that will grow like crazy in the oceans, when it gets heavy, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>And it literally just pulls carbon out of the atmosphere and drops to these 40,000 foot</p>
<p>deep or, you know, 4000 foot deep kind of wells we have already built around 70% of planet Earth.</p>
<p>We have the tools to do that, again, the engineering and the capital to do that. And</p>
<p>then the market for is there a market for that it doesn&rsquo;t, if governments are like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a crisis, let&rsquo;s put a billion dollars into this, like we did in the Apollo program,</p>
<p>we will get that done in five years. I mean, there&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s no shortage of tools and</p>
<p>science to be able to resolve that sort of a problem today, much like we&rsquo;re about to produce</p>
<p>a Coronavirus vaccine in a matter of months after discovering the virus, which is unprecedented.</p>
<p>So our ability to kind of read genomics and write genomics, and as a result, create biological</p>
<p>machines that can do things in the physical world and self propagate, gives us this incredible</p>
<p>toolkit humans never had at its disposal before. And it will be the way that will resolve climate</p>
<p>change. And it will, in the meantime, we&rsquo;re going to bridge the gap between here and there by</p>
<p>creating these nice luxury market, by the way, here&rsquo;s a and so on. Here&rsquo;s an incredible example.</p>
<p>So when you look at sort of where, you know, methane is a really problematic greenhouse gas,</p>
<p>and most of the methane emissions are from cows. But it&rsquo;s from enteric fermentation,</p>
<p>which is, you know, fancy language for burping. And what&rsquo;s incredible is there are now efforts to</p>
<p>use CRISPR to genetically engineer, you know, cows that don&rsquo;t necessarily have that same</p>
<p>gut biome, you know, dynamic so that you&rsquo;re burping methane, that there&rsquo;s also feed that</p>
<p>you can actually give a cow that will minimize methane emissions burping by 30 or 40%. All these</p>
<p>things are to your point, David, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re so fantastical, if you think about it, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>possible today. And we just need to organize and get a kind of like a center of gravity around</p>
<p>these things and they&rsquo;ll happen. Can we get can we get Jason the human version of that?</p>
<p>Does it also cover tooting? Does it work for flatulence?</p>
<p>Interestingly, Chris Saka tweeted about investing in a company called running tide,</p>
<p>which grows kelp, and will suck carbon from the atmosphere. And he just sinks it to the ocean</p>
<p>floor. And they&rsquo;re selling carbon offsets by putting seaweed on the ocean floor. So</p>
<p>such such a no brainer, right? I mean, like the ocean is so big, and it&rsquo;s this and like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not getting in the way of land where you don&rsquo;t have to go figure out licenses and rights,</p>
<p>you got it, you got to basically get carbon to go into the ocean. And so then you basically need an</p>
<p>organism that can grow and self propagate quickly and radically accumulate biomass in the ocean,</p>
<p>and then figure out how to get rid of it. So the best way to get rid of it is have it sink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be some sort of seaweed or kelp or algae. And you just put it in the open ocean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll propagate. I mean, that&rsquo;s just such a great, obvious. And there&rsquo;s 1000 scenarios like</p>
<p>that, that I think, you know, we&rsquo;re going to kind of creatively come up with and resolve.</p>
<p>Why is nuclear not even on the discussion? Freeberg? I&rsquo;m curious, like, is it just</p>
<p>too tainted? We can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do the work I&rsquo;ve done the work I&rsquo;ve done on nuclear, it used to cost something like some</p>
<p>number of dollars to get a nuclear power plant through the regulatory barriers in the United</p>
<p>States. And now it is so cost prohibitive. It&rsquo;s something like $10 billion now,</p>
<p>from maybe, you know, 100 million, you know, two decades ago, there&rsquo;s something about the</p>
<p>regulatory barriers. Yeah, well, there&rsquo;s a huge, there&rsquo;s a huge NIMBY problem, right? I mean,</p>
<p>who wants a nuclear power plant in their backyard? Nobody. I mean, nobody wants it, Jason. But I</p>
<p>agree with like the larger point here that the solution to the problem is ultimately going to be</p>
<p>all these new technologies, these innovative solutions, not making people feel bad for</p>
<p>consuming and, you know, being alive. You know, you look at Tesla, and it&rsquo;s moving the whole</p>
<p>world to electric cars, not with a government mandate, but just by creating a better car.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s ultimately going to be technology companies, you know, increasing the solution set</p>
<p>and giving people new choices. That&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to ultimately solve the problem.</p>
<p>And interestingly, in the news, NuScale is creating small nuclear reactors,</p>
<p>and they just got approval. This is a the Portland based NuScale powers, they had a small</p>
<p>modular reactor that has been approved by the US Department of Energy for a site in eastern Idaho,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see if that ever comes online. But it does seem like small nuclear reactors could solve part</p>
<p>of the NIMBY problem in that they&rsquo;re smaller. So if something were to go wrong, we would have</p>
<p>some ability to contain or have a smaller footprint in a disaster like situation. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrap with the Overton window. Chamath talked about it closing, and Sax, there was a good</p>
<p>article, A Taxonomy of Fear, that you shared with the group. Tell us a little bit about that article,</p>
<p>A Taxonomy of Fear, by Emily Youf. I think it&rsquo;s her name.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s a writer for The Atlantic who wrote this, I guess, called Taxonomy of Fear and</p>
<p>Persuasion. I think it&rsquo;s an important article. What it does is analyze cancel culture and the</p>
<p>language that&rsquo;s used to cancel people. And one of the things she diagnoses is what she calls</p>
<p>safetyism, which is anytime somebody doesn&rsquo;t like what an idea or what somebody else is saying,</p>
<p>they claim that their safety is being threatened by that idea. And it&rsquo;s kind of invoking these</p>
<p>magic words that HR has come up with where if anyone is creating an unsafe work environment,</p>
<p>or an unsafe college campus, well, the source of the problem has to be removed immediately.</p>
<p>And so, this is the language of cancel culture. And the problem with it is that it doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>matter what the intent of the person was, or intent is sort of irrelevant, or whether the</p>
<p>objection is reasonable or not, whether it actually threatens anyone&rsquo;s safety. And so,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an example of this when 50 prominent writers, intellectuals wrote a letter to</p>
<p>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine, including J.K. Rowling and Matt Iglesias, who&rsquo;s a co-founder of</p>
<p>Vox. And so, there&rsquo;s a trans writer, there&rsquo;s a writer who&rsquo;s a trans person at Vox who claims</p>
<p>that her safety was threatened because one of the co-founders had signed this letter.</p>
<p>The letter didn&rsquo;t discuss trans issues, it was simply the fact that Iglesias had signed it along</p>
<p>with J.K. Rowling. And so, J.K. Rowling apparently is- Radioactive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I missed this part of Harry Potter, but apparently the trans movement is-</p>
<p>Well, yeah, her position is that women who were born biologically female are different than women</p>
<p>who transition. But that&rsquo;s J.K. Rowling.</p>
<p>Right, and that&rsquo;s her position, but her position is being attributed to Iglesias by association,</p>
<p>yeah, exactly. And so, Yafi calls this- That would be like saying that I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>support of Trump just because I&rsquo;m on this podcast with you, Seth, to be clear.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s contamination by association is what she calls it.</p>
<p>This will be- If Trump wins in November, it&rsquo;ll be because this whole thing</p>
<p>just gets too much for too many people. There is a massive plurality of people in the middle</p>
<p>who think this over-retching sensitivity by the extreme left and the extreme right</p>
<p>are just completely out to lunch. And-</p>
<p>100% agree. 100% agree.</p>
<p>And I think that, by the way, the extreme left and the extreme right, they should all just get</p>
<p>a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless fuckwits anyways,</p>
<p>all of them, both of them, on the extreme right. When Antifa and the alt-right are fighting with</p>
<p>each other, it&rsquo;s like this sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>But- Thanks for tuning in to the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, most people are in the middle. Most people don&rsquo;t need to have this us or them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not allowed to have an opinion. I actually learn more from people that I disagree</p>
<p>with just by hearing them and not trying to judge them. And I think that most of us, as well,</p>
<p>have our views that are sort of moderately in the middle. So, for example, there was a USC</p>
<p>professor that got sanctioned because he was teaching a language class and he used the Chinese</p>
<p>word for that, which sounds like the N-word. And I think he didn&rsquo;t preface it correctly or what</p>
<p>have you, but then he apologized, he was suspended, and folks wrote a letter. Now,</p>
<p>everybody has a right. The people who felt offended have the right to write the letter.</p>
<p>The administration had the right to react. And then I think people read that article and think</p>
<p>to themselves, is this actually the ‚Äì has the pendulum swung too far or not? And mark my words,</p>
<p>if people feel that the pendulum has swung too far, they will elect Donald Trump because he is</p>
<p>the complete antithesis of giving a shit about any of this stuff. So, that will be the bellwether.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s exactly right. So, I think it&rsquo;s really important. I think there&rsquo;s a large part of the</p>
<p>country that feels that Trump is a shield, not a sword, that he is their protector against this</p>
<p>type of cancel culture. And I know Trump seems like an instigator and he&rsquo;s very threatening to</p>
<p>a lot of people on the other side. But again, to these people, he&rsquo;s more of a shield. And I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the fact that he speaks out and denounces cancel culture that makes him a hero</p>
<p>to these people. It&rsquo;s his ‚Äì his superpower is his uncancelability. It&rsquo;s this, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fact that the left has done everything they can to try and get rid of this guy to impeach</p>
<p>him, what have you. And he keeps surviving. And so, it&rsquo;s his very, you know, uncancelability that</p>
<p>makes him such a hero to these people. And I think this is the thing that the left or the media</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t quite understand is that denouncing Trump in ever more hysterical terms doesn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work because it kind of feeds into this. It actually hurts. It adds more people</p>
<p>to his cohort who say you&rsquo;re overreacting. And the hystericalness of overreacting, like I tweeted,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on this, you know, mini tweet effort to tell people, listen, there are Chromebooks</p>
<p>in the world. They&rsquo;re very cheap. 90% of the Americans are, excuse me, on the internet high</p>
<p>speed. And there are so many online resources for you to get ahead in life. Go try to be a marketer.</p>
<p>Go to Khan Academy. Go learn UX and design. These are the clearest paths into the technology</p>
<p>industry. And I get hysterical liberals who say, people don&rsquo;t have access to the internet. People</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have access to Chromebooks. And people don&rsquo;t have the free time or the motivation</p>
<p>to improve their lot in life. And it&rsquo;s like, who are you talking about? Because 90% of the</p>
<p>country has access to the internet and uses it already. And if you go and do a search for a</p>
<p>Chromebook on eBay, a used one, you can find one for 50 to 150 bucks. So we have this narrative</p>
<p>that people cannot rise up. And people cannot improve themselves. And every time I say, I</p>
<p>believe people can improve themselves, people say that I&rsquo;m like a racist, that I believe that people</p>
<p>can improve themselves. And it just makes me further away from the Democratic Party. It makes</p>
<p>me further away from the left. I think this, I&rsquo;m going to put out a crazy idea, which is that</p>
<p>I think if Donald Trump wins in a meaningful way in November, I don&rsquo;t think he will. But if he does,</p>
<p>the actual silver lining for everybody is I think the Republican Party will disintegrate</p>
<p>and the Democratic Party will disintegrate. And in its place, I think you&rsquo;ll probably have</p>
<p>three or four parties. And I think that that would be amazing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the burn it all down vote, which was Peter Thiel&rsquo;s idea in the beginning,</p>
<p>I think Sachs and Thiel, when they coordinated this Trump election, it was all burn it down,</p>
<p>right Sachs? That was your star chamber discussion with Thiel? You guys wanted to</p>
<p>burn it all down? I think what you&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>contamination by association there. Yeah, just because you went to college</p>
<p>with Peter Thiel. When&rsquo;s the last time you talked to Peter Thiel?</p>
<p>No, Peter&rsquo;s a friend of mine, but again, and I agree with him about some things. I disagree with</p>
<p>him about other things, but this idea, but this idea that we can&rsquo;t hang out with people,</p>
<p>you know, or that hanging out with people means that we must endorse every view they have.</p>
<p>Like, why is it even relevant that I&rsquo;m friends with Peter?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re like, for example, we&rsquo;re friends in our group chat with a couple guys who are</p>
<p>very far right, we&rsquo;re not going to name who they are. But I would say that I think that the group</p>
<p>chat is better off for them being able to say what they believe and push back. And just like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of us who are in the middle, and we waffle back and forth between the left and the</p>
<p>right. And then there are folks that are more on the far right or far left, or on the left. So I</p>
<p>just think that we forget that there is enormous value in the diversity of thought. And, and people</p>
<p>think that there is some sort of safety and conformity. And in fact, I will tell you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually the exact opposite, you&rsquo;re more likely to be in conflict with someone that you</p>
<p>are very similar to. Because eventually, you will always end up competing for the exact same resource</p>
<p>and that resource becomes scarce. If you&rsquo;re actually spending time with people that are</p>
<p>divergent and different from you, you actually end up not competing for the same resources,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, one second, you&rsquo;re built differently. So there&rsquo;s just less conflict.</p>
<p>So this is why multi party systems work. This is why you have less fighting when there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, in Canada, and, and Europe than you do in the United States, because the United States</p>
<p>tries to reduce things down to two choices. And so we all of a sudden, like just glom into these</p>
<p>pools that are seemingly similar, and we just we end up hating each other.</p>
<p>Freeberg, any final thoughts on cancel culture?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s just gonna be bad.</p>
<p>I totally, I totally agree with Jamath that if Trump wins the election, this will be the reason</p>
<p>that the same thing happened when the Republicans overplayed their hand with Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it was said at that time that, you know, Clinton was always very fortunate in who his</p>
<p>enemies were. Because no matter, you know, what he did wrong, or how badly he screwed up,</p>
<p>his enemies always made too big a deal of it, or they overreacted. And it played into his hands.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I have to wonder if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening right now with this whole</p>
<p>cancel culture.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. Well, we&rsquo;ll leave it at that. We&rsquo;ve gone over an hour. If you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>to the all in podcast, and you&rsquo;d like to advertise, it&rsquo;s not possible. There&rsquo;s no ads on</p>
<p>this podcast. And if you&rsquo;d like to be a guest on the podcast, that&rsquo;s also not possible. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>guests. So send your advertising and guest requests to Jamath at SPAC, SPAC, SPAC.org.</p>
<p>Breaking news right now, there is a tech crunch story that just broke while we&rsquo;re on air.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t stop, won&rsquo;t stop, social capital just followed for its fourth SPAC. If you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>SPACs&hellip;</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not the article. The article&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, no, the article is Jamath launches SPAC. SPAC and SPAC. As he SPACs,</p>
<p>the world with SPACs.</p>
<p>Yeah, we just announced three. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you just announced number three.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Three, three, D, E, and F.</p>
<p>Oh, D, E, and F got approved?</p>
<p>No, yeah, they&rsquo;re filed with the SEC now.</p>
<p>Yeah. And when would D, E, and F be available for people to buy shares in it then? Is that</p>
<p>like a 60 day, 100 day?</p>
<p>15 days.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, great. All right. Well, there you have it. And then you confirmed that the second SPAC</p>
<p>was open door, right? Is that confirmed? Or is that&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, that was announced on Tuesday. Yeah.</p>
<p>Congratulations on that.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>And then how do you feel about all these people stealing your thunder with SPACs?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Is that annoying or is it inspiring?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s great. I think it&rsquo;s growing the market. It&rsquo;s good for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing. I mean, this is going to mean that companies with 50 to</p>
<p>150 million will be able to go public on a clear path?</p>
<p>I hope so. I&rsquo;ve said this before. We&rsquo;ve gone from 8,000 public companies to 4,000 in 20 years. So</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s reverse the tide. Let&rsquo;s go back to 8,000.</p>
<p>It should be double the number of companies, right? I mean, we should have gone down,</p>
<p>we should have gone up. You would think we&rsquo;ve gone&hellip;</p>
<p>In a world with 0% interest rates, it has to.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, here we go. Please, for the love of God, somebody convince</p>
<p>Kahm, Robin Hood, Thumbtack, and David Sachs to go public because I&rsquo;ve got kids to put through school.</p>
<p>All right, everybody. For Bestie C,</p>
<p>the Rain Man himself, David Sachs, and the Queen of Quinoa,</p>
<p>Fried Burgers. This is the All In Podcast. We&rsquo;ll see you next time. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Love you, Besties.</p>
<p>I love you, Besties.</p>
