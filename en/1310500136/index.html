    <p>The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis, his third time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He is a professor at MIT and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.</p>
<p>This time we went deep on the science, biology, and genetics.</p>
<p>So this is a bit of an experiment.</p>
<p>Manolis went back and forth between the basics of biology to the latest state of the art</p>
<p>in the research.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a master at this, so I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.</p>
<p>This conversation happened at 7am, so it&rsquo;s yet another podcast episode after an all nighter</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>And once again, since the universe has a sense of humor, this one was a tough one for my</p>
<p>brain to keep up, but I did my best and I never shy away from a good challenge.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>First is SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I&rsquo;ve ever come across.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like looking at numbers, but someone probably should, it helps you make good decisions.</p>
<p>Second is Pessimist Archive, they&rsquo;re back, one of my favorite history podcasts on why</p>
<p>people resist new things from recorded music to umbrellas to cars, chess, coffee, and the</p>
<p>elevator.</p>
<p>Third is 8sleep, a mattress that cools itself, measures heart rate variability, has an app,</p>
<p>and has given me yet another reason to look forward to sleep, including the all important</p>
<p>power nap.</p>
<p>And finally, BetterHelp, online therapy when you want to face your demons with a licensed</p>
<p>professional, not just by doing the David Goggins like physical challenges like I seem</p>
<p>to do on occasion.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that biology in the brain and in the various systems of the</p>
<p>body fill me with awe every time I think about how such a chaotic mess coming from its humble</p>
<p>origins in the ocean was able to achieve such incredibly complex and robust mechanisms of</p>
<p>life that survived despite all the forces of nature that want to destroy it.</p>
<p>It is so unlike the computing systems we humans have engineered that it makes me feel that</p>
<p>in order to create artificial general intelligence and artificial consciousness, we may have</p>
<p>to completely rethink how we engineer computational systems.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Manolis Callas.</p>
<p>So your group at MIT is trying to understand the molecular basis of human disease.</p>
<p>What are some of the biggest challenges in your view?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me started.</p>
<p>I mean, understanding human disease is the most complex challenge in modern science.</p>
<p>So because human disease is as complex as the human genome, it is as complex as the</p>
<p>human brain, and it is in many ways, even more complex because the more we understand</p>
<p>disease complexity, the more we start understanding genome complexity and epigenome complexity</p>
<p>and brain circuitry complexity and immune system complexity and cancer complexity and</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So traditionally, human disease was following basic biology.</p>
<p>You would basically understand basic biology in model organisms like, you know, mouse and</p>
<p>fly and yeast.</p>
<p>You would understand sort of mammalian biology and animal biology and eukaryotic biology</p>
<p>in sort of progressive layers of complexity, getting closer to human phylogenetically.</p>
<p>And you would do perturbation experiments in those species to see if I knock out a gene,</p>
<p>what happens?</p>
<p>And based on the knocking out of these genes, you would basically then have a way to drive</p>
<p>human biology because you would sort of understand the functions of these genes.</p>
<p>And then if you find that a human gene locus, something that you&rsquo;ve mapped from human genetics</p>
<p>to that gene is related to a particular human disease, you&rsquo;d say, aha, now I know the function</p>
<p>of the gene from the model organisms.</p>
<p>I can now go and understand the function of that gene in human.</p>
<p>But this is all changing.</p>
<p>This is dramatically changed.</p>
<p>So that was the old way of doing basic biology.</p>
<p>You would start with the animal models, the eukaryotic models, the mammalian models, and</p>
<p>then you would go to human.</p>
<p>Human genetics has been so transformed in the last decade or two that human genetics</p>
<p>is now actually driving the basic biology.</p>
<p>There is more genetic mutation information in the human genome than there will ever be</p>
<p>in any other species.</p>
<p>What do you mean by mutation information?</p>
<p>So perturbations is how you understand systems.</p>
<p>So an engineer builds systems and then they know how they work from the inside out.</p>
<p>A scientist studies systems through perturbations.</p>
<p>You basically say, if I poke that balloon, what&rsquo;s going to happen?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to film it in super high resolution, understand, I don&rsquo;t know, aerodynamics or</p>
<p>fluid dynamics if it&rsquo;s filled with water, et cetera.</p>
<p>So you can then make experimentation by perturbation and then the scientific process is sort of</p>
<p>building models that best fit the data, designing new experiments that best test your models</p>
<p>and challenge your models and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>This is the same thing with science.</p>
<p>Basically if you&rsquo;re trying to understand biological science, you basically want to do perturbations</p>
<p>that then drive the models.</p>
<p>So how do these perturbations allow you to understand disease?</p>
<p>So if you know that a gene is related to disease, you don&rsquo;t want to just know that it&rsquo;s related</p>
<p>to the disease.</p>
<p>You want to know what is the disease mechanism because you want to go and intervene.</p>
<p>So the way that I like to describe it is that traditionally epidemiology, which is basically</p>
<p>the study of disease, you know, sort of the observational study of disease has been about</p>
<p>correlating one thing with another thing.</p>
<p>So if you have a lot of people with liver disease who are also alcoholics, you might</p>
<p>say, well, maybe the alcoholism is driving the liver disease or maybe those who have</p>
<p>liver disease self medicate with alcohol.</p>
<p>So the connection could be either way.</p>
<p>With genetic epidemiology, it&rsquo;s about correlating changes in genome with phenotypic differences</p>
<p>and then you know the direction of causality.</p>
<p>So if you know that a particular gene is related to the disease, you can basically say, okay,</p>
<p>perturbing that gene in mouse causes the mice to have X phenotype.</p>
<p>So perturbing that gene in human causes the humans to have the disease.</p>
<p>So I can now figure out what are the detailed molecular phenotypes in the human that are</p>
<p>related to that organismal phenotype in the disease.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about understanding disease mechanism, understanding what are the pathways, what</p>
<p>are the tissues, what are the processes that are associated with the disease so that we</p>
<p>know how to intervene.</p>
<p>You can then prescribe particular medications that also alter these processes.</p>
<p>You can prescribe lifestyle changes that also affect these processes and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a beautiful puzzle to try to solve.</p>
<p>Like what kind of perturbations eventually have this ripple effect that leads to disease</p>
<p>across the population.</p>
<p>And then you study that for animals or mice first and then see how that might possibly</p>
<p>connect to humans.</p>
<p>How hard is that puzzle of trying to figure out how little perturbations might lead to,</p>
<p>in a stable way, to a disease?</p>
<p>In animals, we make the puzzle simpler because we perturb one gene at a time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of this, the power of animal models.</p>
<p>You can basically decouple the perturbations.</p>
<p>You only do one perturbation and you only do strong perturbations at a time.</p>
<p>In human, the puzzle is incredibly complex because obviously you don&rsquo;t do human experimentation.</p>
<p>You wait for natural selection and natural genetic variation to basically do its own</p>
<p>experiments, which it has been doing for hundreds and thousands of years in the human population</p>
<p>and for hundreds of thousands of years across the history leading to the human population.</p>
<p>So you basically take this natural genetic variation that we all carry within us.</p>
<p>Every one of us carries 6 million perturbations.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve done 6 million experiments on you, 6 million experiments on me, 6 million experiments</p>
<p>on every one of 7 billion people on the planet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the 6 million correspond to?</p>
<p>6 million unique genetic variants that are segregating in the human population.</p>
<p>Every one of us carries millions of polymorphic sites, poly, many, morph, forms.</p>
<p>Polymorphic means many forms, variants.</p>
<p>That basically means that every one of us has single nucleotide alterations that we</p>
<p>have inherited from mom and from dad that basically can be thought of as tiny little</p>
<p>perturbations.</p>
<p>Most of them don&rsquo;t do anything, but some of them lead to all of the phenotypic differences</p>
<p>that we see between us.</p>
<p>The reason why two twins are identical is because these variants completely determine</p>
<p>the way that I&rsquo;m going to look at exactly 93 years of age.</p>
<p>How happy are you with this kind of data set?</p>
<p>Is it large enough of the human population of Earth?</p>
<p>Is that too big, too small?</p>
<p>Yeah, so is it large enough is a power analysis question.</p>
<p>In every one of our grants, we do a power analysis based on what is the effect size</p>
<p>that I would like to detect and what is the natural variation in the two forms.</p>
<p>Every time you do a perturbation, you&rsquo;re asking, I&rsquo;m changing form A into form B. Form A has</p>
<p>some natural phenotypic variation around it and form B has some natural phenotypic variation</p>
<p>around it.</p>
<p>If those variances are large and the differences between the mean of A and the mean of B are</p>
<p>small, then you have very little power.</p>
<p>The further the means go apart, that&rsquo;s the effect size, the more power you have, and</p>
<p>the smaller the standard deviation, the more power you have.</p>
<p>So basically when you&rsquo;re asking, is that sufficiently large, certainly not for everything, but we</p>
<p>already have enough power for many of the stronger effects in the more tight distributions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the hopeful message that there exists parts of the genome that have a strong effect</p>
<p>that has a small variance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those perturbations are the basis of disease in many cases.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a hopeful message.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a terrible message.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, well, some people are sick, but if we can figure out what are these contributors</p>
<p>to sickness, we can then help make them better and help many other people better who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>carry that exact mutation, but who carry mutations on the same pathways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we like to call the allelic series of a gene.</p>
<p>You basically have many perturbations of the same gene in different people, each with a</p>
<p>different frequency in the human population and each with a different effect on the individual</p>
<p>that carries them.</p>
<p>So you said in the past there would be these small experiments on perturbations and animal</p>
<p>models.</p>
<p>What does this puzzle solving process look like today?</p>
<p>So we basically have something like 7 billion people in the planet and every one of them</p>
<p>carries something like 6 million mutations.</p>
<p>You basically have an enormous matrix of genotype by phenotype by systematically measuring the</p>
<p>phenotype of these individuals.</p>
<p>And the traditional way of measuring this phenotype has been to look at one trait at</p>
<p>a time.</p>
<p>You would gather families and you would sort of paint the pedigrees of a strong effect,</p>
<p>what we like to call Mendelian mutation, so a mutation that gets transmitted in a dominant</p>
<p>or a recessive, but strong effect form where basically one locus plays a very big role</p>
<p>in that disease.</p>
<p>And you could then look at carriers versus non carriers in one family, carriers versus</p>
<p>non carriers in another family and do that for hundreds, sometimes thousands of families</p>
<p>and then trace these inheritance patterns and then figure out what is the gene that</p>
<p>plays that role.</p>
<p>Is this the matrix that you&rsquo;re showing in talks or lectures?</p>
<p>So that matrix is the input to those stuff that I show in talks.</p>
<p>So basically that matrix has traditionally been strong effect genes.</p>
<p>What the matrix looks like now is instead of pedigrees, instead of families, you basically</p>
<p>have thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of unrelated individuals, each with all of</p>
<p>their genetic variants and each with their phenotype, for example, height or lipids or,</p>
<p>you know, whether they&rsquo;re sick or not for a particular trait.</p>
<p>That has been the modern view instead of going to families, going to unrelated individuals</p>
<p>with one phenotype at a time.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re doing now as we&rsquo;re maturing in all of these sciences is that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>this in the context of large medical systems or enormous cohorts that are very well phenotyped</p>
<p>across hundreds of phenotypes, sometimes with our complete electronic health record.</p>
<p>So you can now start relating not just one gene segregating one family, not just thousands</p>
<p>of variants segregating with one phenotype, but now you can do millions of variants versus</p>
<p>hundreds of phenotypes.</p>
<p>And as a computer scientist, I mean, deconvolving that matrix, partitioning it into the layers</p>
<p>of biology that are associated with every one of these elements is a dream come true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the world&rsquo;s greatest puzzle.</p>
<p>And you can now solve that puzzle by throwing in more and more knowledge about the function</p>
<p>of different genomic regions and how these functions are changed across tissues and in</p>
<p>the context of disease.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what my group and many other groups are doing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to systematically relate this genetic variation with molecular variation</p>
<p>at the expression level of the genes, at the epigenomic level of the gene regulatory circuitry,</p>
<p>and at the cellular level of what are the functions that are happening in those cells,</p>
<p>at the single cell level using single cell profiling, and then relate all that vast amount</p>
<p>of knowledge computationally with the thousands of traits that each of these of thousands</p>
<p>of variants are perturbing.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something we talked about, I think last time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these effects at different levels that happen.</p>
<p>You said at a single cell level, you&rsquo;re trying to see things that happen due to certain perturbations.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not just like a puzzle of perturbation and disease.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perturbation then effect at a cellular level, then at an organ level, a body, like,</p>
<p>how do you disassemble this into like what your group is working on?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically taking a bunch of the hard problems in the space.</p>
<p>How do you break apart a difficult disease and break it apart into problems that you,</p>
<p>into puzzles that you can now start solving?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a struggle here.</p>
<p>Super scientists love hard puzzles and they&rsquo;re like, oh, I want to build a method that just</p>
<p>deconvolves the whole thing computationally.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very tempting and it&rsquo;s very appealing, but biologists just like to decouple that</p>
<p>complexity experimentally, to just like peel off layers of complexity experimentally.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what many of these modern tools that my group and others have both developed</p>
<p>and used.</p>
<p>The fact that we can now figure out tricks for peeling off these layers of complexity</p>
<p>by testing one cell type at a time or by testing one cell at a time.</p>
<p>And you could basically say, what is the effect of these genetic variants associated with</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s on human brain?</p>
<p>Human brain sounds like, oh, it&rsquo;s an organ, of course, just go one organ at a time.</p>
<p>But human brain has of course, dozens of different brain regions and within each of these brain</p>
<p>regions, dozens of different cell types and every single type of neuron, every single</p>
<p>type of glial cell between astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, between all of the neural cells</p>
<p>and the vascular cells and the immune cells that are co inhabiting the brain between the</p>
<p>different types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are sort of interacting with</p>
<p>each other between different layers of neurons in the cortical layers.</p>
<p>Every single one of these has a different type of function to play in cognition, in</p>
<p>interaction with the environment, in maintenance of the brain, in energetic needs, in feeding</p>
<p>the brain with blood, with oxygen, in clearing out the debris that are resulting from the</p>
<p>super high energy production of cognition in humans.</p>
<p>So all of these things are basically potentially deconvolvable computationally, but experimentally,</p>
<p>you can just do single cell profiling of dozens of regions of the brain across hundreds of</p>
<p>individuals across millions of cells.</p>
<p>And then now you have pieces of the puzzle that you can then put back together to understand</p>
<p>that complexity.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, the cells in the human brain are the most, maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing</p>
<p>it, but cognition seems to be very complicated.</p>
<p>So separating into the function, breaking Alzheimer&rsquo;s down to the cellular level seems</p>
<p>very challenging.</p>
<p>Is that basically you&rsquo;re trying to find a way that some perturbation in the genome results</p>
<p>in some obvious major dysfunction in the cell.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to find something like that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So what does human genetics do?</p>
<p>Human genetics basically looks at the whole path from genetic variation all the way to</p>
<p>disease.</p>
<p>So human genetics has basically taken thousands of Alzheimer&rsquo;s cases and thousands of controls</p>
<p>matched for age, for sex, for environmental backgrounds and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And then looked at that map where you&rsquo;re asking, what are the individual genetic perturbations</p>
<p>and how are they related to all the way to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease?</p>
<p>And that has actually been quite successful.</p>
<p>So we now have more than 27 different loci, these are genomic regions that are associated</p>
<p>with Alzheimer&rsquo;s at these end to end level.</p>
<p>But the moment you sort of break up that very long path into smaller levels, you can basically</p>
<p>say from genetics, what are the epigenomic alterations at the level of gene regulatory</p>
<p>elements where that genetic variant perturbs the control region nearby.</p>
<p>That effect is much larger.</p>
<p>You mean much larger in terms of this down the line impact or?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much larger in terms of the measurable effect, this A versus B variance is actually</p>
<p>so much cleanly defined when you go to the shorter branches.</p>
<p>Because for one genetic variant to affect Alzheimer&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a very long path.</p>
<p>That basically means that in the context of millions of these 6 million variants that</p>
<p>every one of us carries, that one single nucleotide has a detectable effect all the way to the</p>
<p>end.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just mind boggling that that&rsquo;s even possible, but indeed there are such effects.</p>
<p>So the hope is, or the most scientifically speaking, the most effective place where to</p>
<p>detect the alteration that results in disease is earlier on in the pipeline, as early as</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a trade off.</p>
<p>If you go very early on in the pipeline, now each of these epigenomic alterations, for</p>
<p>example, this enhancer control region is active maybe 50% less, which is a dramatic effect.</p>
<p>Now you can ask, well, how much does changing one regulatory region in the genome in one</p>
<p>cell type change disease?</p>
<p>Well, that path is now long.</p>
<p>So if you instead look at expression, the path between genetic variation and the expression</p>
<p>of one gene goes through many enhancer regions, and therefore it&rsquo;s a subtler effect at the</p>
<p>gene level.</p>
<p>But then now you&rsquo;re closer because one gene is acting in the context of only 20,000 other</p>
<p>genes as opposed to one enhancer acting in the context of 2 million other enhancers.</p>
<p>So you basically now have genetic, epigenomic, the circuitry, transcriptomic, the gene expression</p>
<p>control, and then cellular, where you can basically say, I can measure various properties</p>
<p>of those cells.</p>
<p>What is the calcium influx rate when I have this genetic variation?</p>
<p>What is the synaptic density?</p>
<p>What is the electric impulse conductivity and so on and so forth?</p>
<p>So you can measure things along this path to disease, and you can also measure endophenotypes.</p>
<p>You can basically measure your brain activity.</p>
<p>You can do imaging in the brain.</p>
<p>You can basically measure, I don&rsquo;t know, the heart rate, the pulse, the lipids, the amount</p>
<p>of blood secreted and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And then through all of that, you can basically get at the path to causality, the path to</p>
<p>disease.</p>
<p>And is there something beyond cellular?</p>
<p>So you mentioned lifestyle interventions or changes as a way to, or like be able to prescribe</p>
<p>changes in lifestyle.</p>
<p>Like what about organs?</p>
<p>What about like the function of the body as a whole?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So basically when you go to your doctor, they always measure, you know, your pulse.</p>
<p>They always measure your height.</p>
<p>They always measure your weight, you know, your BMI.</p>
<p>So basically these are just very basic variables.</p>
<p>But with digital devices nowadays, you can start measuring hundreds of variables for</p>
<p>every individual.</p>
<p>You can basically also phenotype cognitively through tests, Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients.</p>
<p>There are cognitive tests that you can measure, that you typically do for cognitive decline,</p>
<p>these mini mental observations that you have specific questions to.</p>
<p>You can think of sort of enlarging the set of cognitive tests.</p>
<p>So in the mouse, for example, you do experiments for how do they get out of mazes?</p>
<p>How do they find food?</p>
<p>Whether they recall a fear, whether they shake in a new environment and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>In the human, you can have much, much richer phenotypes where you can basically say not</p>
<p>just imaging at the organ level and all kinds of other activities at the organ level, but</p>
<p>you can also do at the organism level, you can do behavioral tests.</p>
<p>And how did they do on empathy?</p>
<p>How did they do on memory?</p>
<p>How did they do on longterm memory versus short term memory?</p>
<p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I love how you&rsquo;re calling that phenotype.</p>
<p>I guess it is.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>But like your behavior patterns that might change over a period of a life, your ability</p>
<p>to remember things, your ability to be empathetic or emotionally, your intelligence perhaps</p>
<p>even.</p>
<p>Yeah, but intelligence has hundreds of variables.</p>
<p>You can be your math intelligence, your literary intelligence, your puzzle solving intelligence,</p>
<p>your logic.</p>
<p>It could be like hundreds of things.</p>
<p>And all of that, we&rsquo;re able to measure that better and better and all that could be connected</p>
<p>to the entire pipeline somehow.</p>
<p>We used to think of each of these as a single variable like intelligence.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically dozens of different genes that are controlling every single variable.</p>
<p>You can basically think of, imagine us in a video game where every one of us has measures</p>
<p>of strength, stamina, energy left and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But you could click on each of those five bars that are just the main bars and each</p>
<p>of those will just give you then hundreds of bars and can basically say, okay, great</p>
<p>for my machine learning task, I want someone who, a human who has these particular forms</p>
<p>of intelligence.</p>
<p>I require now these 20 different things.</p>
<p>And then you can combine those things and then relate them to of course performance</p>
<p>in a particular task, but you can also relate them to genetic variation that might be affecting</p>
<p>different parts of the brain.</p>
<p>For example, your frontal cortex versus your temporal cortex versus your visual cortex</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So genetic variation that affects expression of genes in different parts of your brain</p>
<p>can basically affect your music ability, your auditory ability, your smell, just dozens</p>
<p>of different phenotypes can be broken down into hundreds of cognitive variables and then</p>
<p>relate each of those to thousands of genes that are associated with them.</p>
<p>So somebody who loves RPGs or playing games, there&rsquo;s too few variables that we can control.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited if we&rsquo;re in fact living in a simulation and this is a video game, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>excited by the quality of the video game.</p>
<p>The game designer did a hell of a good job.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re impressed.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The sunset last night was a little unrealistic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The graphics.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Come on, NVIDIA.</p>
<p>To zoom back out, we&rsquo;ve been talking about the genetic origins of diseases, but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to talk about what are the most important diseases to understand and</p>
<p>especially as it connects to the things that you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very difficult to think about important diseases to understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many metrics of importance.</p>
<p>One is lifestyle impact.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at COVID, the impact on lifestyle has been enormous.</p>
<p>So understanding COVID is important because it has impacted the wellbeing in terms of</p>
<p>ability to have a job, ability to have an apartment, ability to go to work, ability</p>
<p>to have a mental circle of support and all of that for millions of Americans, like huge,</p>
<p>huge impact.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one aspect of importance.</p>
<p>So basically mental disorders, Alzheimer&rsquo;s has a huge importance in the wellbeing of</p>
<p>Americans.</p>
<p>Whether or not it kills someone for many, many years, it has a huge impact.</p>
<p>So the first measure of importance is just wellbeing.</p>
<p>Impact on the quality of life.</p>
<p>Impact on the quality of life, absolutely.</p>
<p>The second metric, which is much easier to quantify is deaths.</p>
<p>What is the number one killer?</p>
<p>The number one killer is actually heart disease.</p>
<p>It is actually killing 650,000 Americans per year.</p>
<p>Number two is cancer with 600,000 Americans.</p>
<p>Number three, far, far down the list is accidents, every single accident combined.</p>
<p>So basically you read the news, accidents, like there was a huge car crash all over the</p>
<p>news.</p>
<p>But the number of deaths, number three by far, 167,000.</p>
<p>Core respiratory disease.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s asthma, not being able to breathe and so on and so forth, 160,000 Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>number five with 120,000 and then stroke, brain aneurysms and so on and so forth, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>147,000 diabetes and metabolic disorders, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 85,000.</p>
<p>The flu is 60,000, suicide, 50,000 and then overdose, et cetera, you know, goes further</p>
<p>down the list.</p>
<p>So of course COVID has creeped up to be the number three killer this year with, you know,</p>
<p>more than 100,000 Americans and counting.</p>
<p>And you know, but if you think about sort of what do we use, what are the most important</p>
<p>diseases, you have to understand both the quality of life and the sheer number of deaths</p>
<p>and just numbers of years lost if you wish.</p>
<p>And each of these diseases you can think of as, and also including terrorist attacks and</p>
<p>school shootings, for example, things which lead to fatalities, you can look at as problems</p>
<p>that could be solved.</p>
<p>And some problems are harder to solve than others.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of the equation.</p>
<p>So maybe if you look at these diseases, if you look at heart disease or cancer or Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or just like schizophrenia and obesity, Debbie, like not necessarily things that kill you,</p>
<p>but affect the quality of life, which problems are solvable, which aren&rsquo;t, which are harder</p>
<p>to solve, which aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I love your question because he puts it in the context of a global effort rather than</p>
<p>just the local effort.</p>
<p>So basically if you look at the global aspect, exercise and nutrition are two interventions</p>
<p>that we can as a society make a much better job at.</p>
<p>So if you think about sort of the availability of cheap food, it&rsquo;s extremely high in calories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely detrimental for you, like a lot of processed food, et cetera.</p>
<p>So if we change that equation and as a society, we made availability of healthy food much,</p>
<p>much easier and charged a burger at McDonald&rsquo;s, the price that it costs on the health system,</p>
<p>then people would actually start buying more healthy foods.</p>
<p>So basically that&rsquo;s sort of a societal intervention, if you wish.</p>
<p>In the same way, increasing empathy, increasing education, increasing the social framework</p>
<p>and support would basically lead to fewer suicides.</p>
<p>It would lead to fewer murders.</p>
<p>It would lead to fewer deaths overall.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that we as a society can do.</p>
<p>You can also think about external factors versus internal factors.</p>
<p>So the external factors are basically communicable diseases like COVID, like the flu, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the internal factors are basically things like cancer and Alzheimer&rsquo;s where basically</p>
<p>your genetics will eventually drive you there.</p>
<p>And then of course, with all of these factors, every single disease has both the genetic</p>
<p>component and environmental component.</p>
<p>So heart disease, huge genetic contribution, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like 60% plus genetic.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s like 79% heritability.</p>
<p>So that basically means that genetics alone explains 79% of Alzheimer&rsquo;s incidents.</p>
<p>And yes, there&rsquo;s a 21% environmental component where you could basically enrich your cognitive</p>
<p>environment, enrich your social interactions, read more books, learn a foreign language,</p>
<p>go running, you know, sort of have a more fulfilling life.</p>
<p>All of that will actually decrease Alzheimer&rsquo;s, but there&rsquo;s a limit to how much that can impact</p>
<p>because of the huge genetic footprint.</p>
<p>So this is fascinating.</p>
<p>So each one of these problems have a genetic component and an environment component.</p>
<p>And so like when there&rsquo;s a genetic component, what can we do about some of these diseases?</p>
<p>And have you worked on what can you say that&rsquo;s in terms of problems that are solvable here</p>
<p>or understandable?</p>
<p>So my group works on the genetic component, but I would argue that understanding the genetic</p>
<p>component can have a huge impact even on the environmental component.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because genetics gives us access to mechanism.</p>
<p>And if we can alter the mechanism, if we can impact the mechanism, we can perhaps counteract</p>
<p>some of the environmental components.</p>
<p>So understanding the biological mechanisms leading to disease is extremely important</p>
<p>in being able to intervene.</p>
<p>But when you can intervene and what, you know, the analogy that I like to give is for example,</p>
<p>for obesity, you know, think of it as a giant bathtub of fat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s basically fat coming in from your diet and there&rsquo;s fat coming out from your</p>
<p>exercise.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an in out equation and that&rsquo;s the equation that everybody&rsquo;s focusing on.</p>
<p>But your metabolism impacts that, you know, bathtub.</p>
<p>Basically your metabolism controls the rate at which you&rsquo;re burning energy.</p>
<p>It controls the rate at which you&rsquo;re storing energy.</p>
<p>And it also teaches you about the various valves that control the input and the output</p>
<p>equation.</p>
<p>So if we can learn from the genetics, the valves, we can then manipulate those valves.</p>
<p>And even if the environment is feeding you a lot of fat and getting a little that out,</p>
<p>you can just poke another hole at the bathtub and just get a lot of the fat out.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not just passive observers of our genetics.</p>
<p>The more we understand, the more we can come up with actual treatments.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an important aspect to realize when people are thinking about strong</p>
<p>effect versus weak effect variants.</p>
<p>So some variants have strong effects.</p>
<p>We talked about these Mendelian disorders where a single gene has a sufficiently large</p>
<p>effect, penetrance, expressivity, and so on and so forth, that basically you can trace</p>
<p>it in families with cases and not cases, cases, not cases, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But so these are the genes that everybody says, oh, that&rsquo;s the genes we should go after</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a strong effect gene.</p>
<p>I like to think about it slightly differently.</p>
<p>These are the genes where genetic impacts that have a strong effect were tolerated because</p>
<p>every single time we have a genetic association with disease, it depends on two things.</p>
<p>Number one, the obvious one, whether the gene has an impact on the disease.</p>
<p>Number two, the more subtle one is whether there is genetic variation standing and circulating</p>
<p>and segregating in the human population that impacts that gene.</p>
<p>Some genes are so darn important that if you mess with them, even a tiny little amount,</p>
<p>that person&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>So those genes don&rsquo;t have variation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to find a genetic association if you don&rsquo;t have variation.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the gene has no role.</p>
<p>It simply means that the gene tolerates no mutations.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually a strong signal when there&rsquo;s no variation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Genes that have very little variation are hugely important.</p>
<p>You can actually rank the importance of genes based on how little variation they have.</p>
<p>And those genes that have very little variation but no association with disease, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very good metric to say, oh, that&rsquo;s probably a developmental gene because we&rsquo;re not good</p>
<p>at measuring those phenotypes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s genes that you can tell evolution has excluded mutations from, but yet we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see them associated with anything that we can measure nowadays.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably early embryonic lethal.</p>
<p>What are all the words you just said?</p>
<p>Early embryonic what?</p>
<p>Lethal.</p>
<p>Meaning?</p>
<p>Meaning that that embryo will die.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff that is required for a stable functional organism across the</p>
<p>board for an entire species, I guess.</p>
<p>If you look at sperm, it expresses thousands of proteins.</p>
<p>Does sperm actually need thousands of proteins?</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s probably just testing them.</p>
<p>So my speculation is that misfolding of these proteins is an early test for failure.</p>
<p>So that out of the millions of sperm that are possible, you select the subset that are</p>
<p>just not grossly misfolding thousands of proteins.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of an assert that this is folded correctly.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This just because if this little thing about the folding of a protein isn&rsquo;t correct, that</p>
<p>probably means somewhere down the line, there&rsquo;s a bigger issue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So fail fast.</p>
<p>So basically if you look at the mammalian investment in a newborn, that investment is</p>
<p>enormous in terms of resources.</p>
<p>So mammals have basically evolved mechanisms for fail fast.</p>
<p>Where basically in those early months of development, I mean it&rsquo;s horrendous of course at the personal</p>
<p>level when you lose your future child, but in some ways there&rsquo;s so little hope for that</p>
<p>child to develop and sort of make it through the remaining months that sort of fail fast</p>
<p>is probably a good evolutionary principle for mammals.</p>
<p>And of course humans have a lot of medical resources that you can sort of give those</p>
<p>children a chance and we have so much more success in sort of giving folks who have these</p>
<p>strong carrier mutations a chance, but if they&rsquo;re not even making it through the first</p>
<p>three months, we&rsquo;re not going to see them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why when we say what are the most important genes to focus on, the ones that</p>
<p>have a strong effect mutation or the ones that have a weak effect mutation, well the</p>
<p>jury might be out because the ones that have a strong effect mutation are basically not</p>
<p>mattering as much.</p>
<p>The ones that only have weak effect mutations by understanding through genetics that they</p>
<p>have a weak effect mutation and understanding that they have a causal role on the disease,</p>
<p>we can then say, okay, great, evolution has only tolerated a 2% change in that gene.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutically I can go in and induce a 70% change in that gene and maybe I will poke</p>
<p>another hole at the bathtub that was not easy to control in many of the other sort of strong</p>
<p>effect genetic variants.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this beautiful map of across the population of things that you&rsquo;re saying strong</p>
<p>and weak effects, so stuff with a lot of mutations and stuff with little mutations with no mutations</p>
<p>and you have this map and it lays out the puzzle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So when I say strong effect, I mean at the level of individual mutations.</p>
<p>So basically genes where, so you have to think of first the effect of the gene on the disease.</p>
<p>Remember how I was sort of painting that map earlier from genetics all the way to phenotype.</p>
<p>That gene can have a strong effect on the disease, but the genetic variant might have</p>
<p>a weak effect on the gene.</p>
<p>So basically when you ask what is the effect of that genetic variant on the disease, it</p>
<p>could be that that genetic variant impacts the gene by a lot and then the gene impacts</p>
<p>the disease by a little, or it could be that the genetic variants impacts the gene by a</p>
<p>little and then the gene impacts the disease by a lot.</p>
<p>So what we care about is genes that impact the disease a lot, but genetics gives us the</p>
<p>full equation and what I would argue is if we couple the genetics with expression variation</p>
<p>to basically ask what genes change by a lot and which genes correlate with disease by</p>
<p>a lot, even if the genetic variants change them by a little, then those are the best</p>
<p>places to intervene.</p>
<p>Those are the best places where pharmaceutical, if I have even a modest effect, I will have</p>
<p>a strong effect on the disease, whereas those genetic variants that have a huge effect on</p>
<p>the disease, I might not be able to change that gene by this much without affecting all</p>
<p>kinds of other things.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>What have we been able to find in terms of which disease could be helped?</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t get me started.</p>
<p>We have found so much.</p>
<p>Our understanding of disease has changed so dramatically with genetics.</p>
<p>I mean places that we had no idea would be involved.</p>
<p>So one of the worst things about my genome is that I have a genetic predisposition to</p>
<p>age related macular degeneration, AMD.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a form of blindness that causes you to lose the central part of your vision progressively</p>
<p>as you grow older.</p>
<p>My increased risk is fairly small.</p>
<p>I have an 8% chance.</p>
<p>You only have a 6% chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an average.</p>
<p>By the way, when you say my, you mean literally yours.</p>
<p>You know this about you.</p>
<p>I know this about me.</p>
<p>Which is kind of, I mean philosophically speaking is a pretty powerful thing to live with.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s, so we agreed to talk again by the way for the listeners to where we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to try to focus on science today and a little bit of philosophy next time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to think about the more you&rsquo;re able to know about yourself from the</p>
<p>genetic information in terms of the diseases, how that changes your own view of life.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of impact there and there&rsquo;s something called genetics exceptionalism,</p>
<p>which basically thinks of genetics as something very, very different than everything else</p>
<p>as a type of determinism.</p>
<p>And you know, let&rsquo;s talk about that next time.</p>
<p>So basically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good preview.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to AMD.</p>
<p>So basically with AMD, we have no idea what causes AMD.</p>
<p>You know, it was, it was a mystery until the genetics were worked out.</p>
<p>And now the fact that I know that I have a predisposition allows me to sort of make some</p>
<p>life choices, number one, but number two, the genes that lead to that predisposition</p>
<p>give us insights as to how does it actually work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a place where genetics gave us something totally unexpected.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a complement pathway, which is an immune function pathway that was in, you</p>
<p>know, most of the loci associated with AMD.</p>
<p>And that basically told us that, wow, there&rsquo;s an immune basis to this eye disorder that</p>
<p>people had just not expected before.</p>
<p>If you look at complement, it was recently also implicated in schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a type of microglia that is involved in synaptic pruning.</p>
<p>So synapses are the connections between neurons.</p>
<p>And in this whole use it or lose it view of mental cognition and other capabilities, you</p>
<p>basically have microglia, which are immune cells that are sort of constantly traversing</p>
<p>your brain and then pruning neuronal connections, pruning synaptic connections that are not</p>
<p>utilized.</p>
<p>So in schizophrenia, there&rsquo;s thought to be a change in the pruning that basically if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t prune your synapses the right way, you will actually have an increased role of</p>
<p>schizophrenia.</p>
<p>This is something that was completely unexpected for schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Of course, we knew it has to do with neurons, but the role of the complement complex, which</p>
<p>is also implicated in AMD, which is now also implicated in schizophrenia, was a huge surprise.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the complement complex?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically a set of genes, the complement genes that are basically having various immune</p>
<p>roles.</p>
<p>And as I was saying earlier, our immune system has been coopted for many different roles</p>
<p>across the body.</p>
<p>So they actually play many diverse roles.</p>
<p>And somehow the immune system is connected to the synaptic pruning process, the process.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So the prune cells were coopted to prune synapses.</p>
<p>How did you figure this out?</p>
<p>How does one go about figuring this intricate connection, like pipeline of connections out?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me give you another example.</p>
<p>So Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, the first place that you would expect it to act is obviously the</p>
<p>brain.</p>
<p>So we had basically this roadmap epigenomics consortium view of the human epigenome, the</p>
<p>largest map of the human epigenome that has ever been built across 127 different tissues</p>
<p>and samples with dozens of epigenomic marks measured in hundreds of donors.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ve basically learned through that is that you basically can map what are the</p>
<p>active gene regulatory elements for every one of the tissues in the body.</p>
<p>And then we connected these gene regulatory active maps of basically what regions of the</p>
<p>human genome are turning on in every one of different tissues.</p>
<p>We then can go back and say, where are all of the genetic loci that are associated with</p>
<p>disease?</p>
<p>This is something that my group, I think was the first to do back in 2010 in this Ernst</p>
<p>Nature Biotech paper, but basically we were for the first time able to show that specific</p>
<p>chromatin states, specific epigenomic states, in that case enhancers, were in fact enriched</p>
<p>in disease associated variants.</p>
<p>We pushed that further in the Ernst Nature paper a year later.</p>
<p>And then in this roadmap epigenomics paper a few years after that, but basically that</p>
<p>matrix that you mentioned earlier was in fact the first time that we could see what genetic</p>
<p>traits have genetic variants that are enriched in what tissues in the body.</p>
<p>And a lot of that map made complete sense.</p>
<p>If you looked at a diversity of immune traits like allergies and type one diabetes and so</p>
<p>on and so forth, you basically could see that they were enriching, that the genetic variants</p>
<p>associated with those traits were enriched in enhancers in these gene regulatory elements</p>
<p>active in T cells and B cells and hematopoietic stem cells and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So that basically gave us a confirmation in many ways that those immune traits were indeed</p>
<p>enriching immune cells.</p>
<p>If you looked at type two diabetes, you basically saw an enrichment in only one type of sample</p>
<p>and it was pancreatic islets.</p>
<p>And we know that type two diabetes sort of stems from the dysregulation of insulin in</p>
<p>the beta cells of pancreatic islets.</p>
<p>And that sort of was spot on, super precise.</p>
<p>If you looked at blood pressure, where would you expect blood pressure to occur?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe in your metabolism and ways that you process coffee or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>Maybe in your brain, the way that you stress out and increases your blood pressure, et</p>
<p>cetera.</p>
<p>So the blood pressure localized specifically in the left ventricle of the heart.</p>
<p>So the enhancers of the left ventricle in the heart contained a lot of genetic variants</p>
<p>associated with blood pressure.</p>
<p>If you look at height, we found an enrichment specifically in embryonic stem cell enhancers.</p>
<p>So the genetic variants predisposing you to be taller or shorter are in fact acting in</p>
<p>developmental stem cells, makes complete sense.</p>
<p>If you looked at inflammatory bowel disease, you basically found inflammatory, which is</p>
<p>immune, and also bowel disease, which is digestive.</p>
<p>And indeed we saw a double enrichment both in the immune cells and in the digestive cells.</p>
<p>So that basically told us that this is acting in both components.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an immune component to inflammatory bowel disease and there&rsquo;s a digestive component.</p>
<p>And the big surprise was for Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We had seven different brain samples.</p>
<p>We found zero enrichment in the brain samples for genetic variants associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And this is mind boggling.</p>
<p>Our brains were literally hurting.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>And what is going on is that the brain samples are primarily neurons, oligodendrocytes, and</p>
<p>astrocytes in terms of the cell types that make them up.</p>
<p>So that basically indicated that genetic variants associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s were probably</p>
<p>not acting in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or neurons.</p>
<p>So what could they be acting in?</p>
<p>Well, the fourth major cell type is actually microglia.</p>
<p>Microglia are resident immune cells in your brain.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>They immune.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>They are CD14 plus, which is this sort of cell surface markers of those cells.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re CD14 plus cells, just like macrophages that are circulating in your blood.</p>
<p>The microglia are resident monocytes that are basically sitting in your brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tissue specific monocytes.</p>
<p>And every one of your tissues, like your fat, for example, has a lot of macrophages that</p>
<p>are resident.</p>
<p>And the M1 versus M2 macrophage ratio has a huge role to play in obesity.</p>
<p>And so basically, again, these immune cells are everywhere, but basically what we found</p>
<p>through this completely unbiased view of what are the tissues that likely underlie different</p>
<p>disorders, we found that Alzheimer&rsquo;s was humongously enriched in microglia, but not at all in the</p>
<p>other cell types.</p>
<p>So what are we supposed to make that if you look at the tissues involved, is that simply</p>
<p>useful for indication of propensity for disease, or does it give us somehow a pathway of treatment?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much the second.</p>
<p>If you look at the way to therapeutics, you have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>What are you going to do?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to basically make assays that manipulate those genes and those pathways</p>
<p>in those cell types.</p>
<p>So before we know the tissue of action, we don&rsquo;t even know where to start.</p>
<p>We basically are at a loss.</p>
<p>But if you know the tissue of action, and even better, if you know the pathway of action,</p>
<p>then you can basically screen your small molecules, not for the gene, you can screen them directly</p>
<p>for the pathway in that cell type.</p>
<p>So you can basically develop a high throughput multiplexed robotic system for testing the</p>
<p>impact of your favorite molecules that you know are safe, efficacious, and sort of hit</p>
<p>that particular gene and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>You can basically screen those molecules against either a set of genes that act in that pathway</p>
<p>or on the pathway directly by having a cellular assay.</p>
<p>And then you can basically go into mice and do experiments and basically sort of figure</p>
<p>out ways to manipulate these processes that allow you to then go back to humans and do</p>
<p>a clinical trial that basically says, okay, I was able indeed to reverse these processes</p>
<p>in mice.</p>
<p>Can I do the same thing in humans?</p>
<p>So the knowledge of the tissues gives you the pathway to treatment, but that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>only part.</p>
<p>There are many additional steps to figuring out the mechanism of disease.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really promising.</p>
<p>Maybe to take a small step back, you&rsquo;ve mentioned all these puzzles that were figured out with</p>
<p>the Nature paper for, I mean, you&rsquo;ve mentioned a ton of diseases from obesity to Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>even schizophrenia, I think you mentioned.</p>
<p>What is the actual methodology of figuring this out?</p>
<p>So indeed, I mentioned a lot of diseases and my lab works on a lot of different disorders.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that if you look at biology, it used to be zoology departments</p>
<p>and botanology departments and virology departments and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And MIT was one of the first schools to basically create a biology department, like, oh, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to study all of life suddenly.</p>
<p>Why was that even a case?</p>
<p>Because the advent of DNA and the genome and the central dogma of DNA makes RNA makes protein</p>
<p>in many ways, unified biology.</p>
<p>You could suddenly study the process of transcription in viruses or in bacteria and have a huge</p>
<p>impact on yeast and fly and maybe even mammals because of this realization of these common</p>
<p>underlying processes.</p>
<p>And in the same way that DNA unified biology, genetics is unifying disease studies.</p>
<p>So you used to have, I don&rsquo;t know, cardiovascular disease department and neurological disease</p>
<p>department and neurodegeneration department and basically immune and cancer and so on</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And all of these were studied in different labs because it made sense, because basically</p>
<p>the first step was understanding how the tissue functions and we kind of knew the tissues</p>
<p>involved in cardiovascular disease and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s happening with human genetics is that all of these walls and edifices that</p>
<p>we had built are crumbling.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that genetics is in many ways revealing unexpected connections.</p>
<p>So suddenly we now have to bring the immunologists to work on Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They were never in the room.</p>
<p>They were in another building altogether.</p>
<p>The same way for schizophrenia, we now have to sort of worry about all these interconnected</p>
<p>aspects.</p>
<p>For metabolic disorders, we&rsquo;re finding contributions from brain.</p>
<p>So suddenly we have to call the neurologist from the other building and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So in my view, it makes no sense anymore to basically say, oh, I&rsquo;m a geneticist studying</p>
<p>immune disorders.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s ridiculous because, I mean, of course in many ways you still need to sort</p>
<p>of focus.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re doing is that we&rsquo;re basically saying we&rsquo;ll go wherever the genetics takes</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>And by building these massive resources, by working on our latest map is now 833 tissues,</p>
<p>sort of the next generation of the epigenomics roadmap, which we&rsquo;re now called epimap, is</p>
<p>833 different tissues.</p>
<p>And using those, we&rsquo;ve basically found enrichments in 540 different disorders.</p>
<p>Those enrichments are not like, oh great, you guys work on that and we&rsquo;ll work on this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re intertwined amazingly.</p>
<p>So of course there&rsquo;s a lot of modularity, but there&rsquo;s these enhancers that are sort</p>
<p>of broadly active and these disorders that are broadly active.</p>
<p>So basically some enhancers are active in all tissues and some disorders are enriching</p>
<p>in all tissues.</p>
<p>So basically there&rsquo;s these multifactorial and this other class, which I like to call</p>
<p>polyfactorial diseases, which are basically lighting up everywhere.</p>
<p>And in many ways it&rsquo;s, you know, sort of cutting across these walls that were previously built</p>
<p>across these departments.</p>
<p>And the polyfactorial ones were probably the previous structural departments wasn&rsquo;t equipped</p>
<p>to deal with those.</p>
<p>I mean, again, maybe it&rsquo;s a romanticized question, but you know, there&rsquo;s in physics, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to move towards an almost theory of everything of disease</p>
<p>from a genetic perspective?</p>
<p>So if this unification continues, is it possible that, like, do you think in those terms, like</p>
<p>trying to arrive at a fundamental understanding of how disease emerges, period?</p>
<p>That unification is not just foreseeable, it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>I see it as inevitable.</p>
<p>We have to go there.</p>
<p>You cannot be a specialist anymore.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a genomicist, you have to be a specialist in every single disorder.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that the fundamental understanding of the circuitry of the human</p>
<p>genome that you need to solve schizophrenia, that fundamental circuitry is hugely important</p>
<p>to solve Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And that same circuitry is hugely important to solve metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>And that same exact circuitry is hugely important for solving immune disorders and cancer and,</p>
<p>you know, every single disease.</p>
<p>So all of them have the same sub task.</p>
<p>And I teach dynamic programming in my class.</p>
<p>Dynamic programming is all about sort of not redoing the work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reusing the work that you do once.</p>
<p>So basically for us to say, oh, great, you know, you guys in the immune building go solve</p>
<p>the fundamental circuitry of everything.</p>
<p>And then you guys in the schizophrenia building go solve the fundamental circuitry of everything</p>
<p>separately, is crazy.</p>
<p>So what we need to do is come together and sort of have a circuitry group, the circuitry</p>
<p>building that sort of tries to solve the circuitry of everything.</p>
<p>And then the immune folks who will apply this knowledge to all of the disorders that are</p>
<p>associated with immune dysfunction and the schizophrenia folks will basically interacting</p>
<p>with both the immune folks and with the neuronal folks.</p>
<p>And all of them will be interacting with the circuitry folks and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of the current structure of my group, if you wish.</p>
<p>So basically what we&rsquo;re doing is focusing on the fundamental circuitry.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we&rsquo;re the users of our own tools by collaborating with many other</p>
<p>labs in every one of these disorders that we mentioned.</p>
<p>We basically have a heart focus on cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>We have an immune focus on several immune disorders.</p>
<p>We have a cancer focus on metastatic melanoma and immunotherapy response.</p>
<p>We have a psychiatric disease focus on schizophrenia, autism, PTSD, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>We have an Alzheimer&rsquo;s and neurodegeneration focus on Huntington&rsquo;s disease, ALS and, you</p>
<p>know, AD related disorders like frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia.</p>
<p>And of course, a huge focus on Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We have a metabolic focus on the role of exercise and diets and sort of how they&rsquo;re impacting</p>
<p>metabolic organs across the body and across many different tissues.</p>
<p>And all of them are interfacing with the circuitry.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is another computer science principle of eat your own dog food.</p>
<p>If everybody ate their own dog food, dog food would taste a lot better.</p>
<p>The reason why Microsoft Excel and Word and PowerPoint was so important and so successful</p>
<p>is because the employees that were working on them, were using them for their day to</p>
<p>day tasks.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just simply build a circuitry and say, here it is guys, take the circuitry,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re done without being the users of that circuitry because you then go back.</p>
<p>And because we span the whole spectrum from profiling the epigenome, using comparative</p>
<p>genomics, finding the important nucleotides in the genome, building the basic functional</p>
<p>map of what are the genes in the human genome, what are the gene regulatory elements of the</p>
<p>human genome.</p>
<p>I mean, over the years we&rsquo;ve written a series of papers on how do you find human genes in</p>
<p>the first place using comparative genomics?</p>
<p>How do you find the motifs that are the building blocks of gene regulation using comparative</p>
<p>genomics?</p>
<p>And how do you then find how these motifs come together and act in specific tissues</p>
<p>using epigenomics?</p>
<p>How do you link regulators to enhancers and enhancers to their target genes using epigenomics</p>
<p>and regulatory genomics?</p>
<p>So through the years we&rsquo;ve basically built all this infrastructure for understanding</p>
<p>what I like to say, every single nucleotide of the human genome and how it acts in every</p>
<p>one of the major cell types and tissues of the human body.</p>
<p>I mean, this is no small task.</p>
<p>This is an enormous task that takes the entire field.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that my group has taken on along with many other groups.</p>
<p>And we have also, and that sort of a thing sets my group perhaps apart, we have also</p>
<p>worked with specialists in every one of these disorders to basically further our understanding</p>
<p>all the way down to disease and in some cases collaborating with pharma to go all the way</p>
<p>down to therapeutics because of our deep, deep understanding of that basic circuitry</p>
<p>and how it allows us to now improve the circuitry.</p>
<p>Not just treat it as a black box, but basically go and say, okay, we need a better cell type</p>
<p>specific wiring that we now have at the tissue specific level.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re focusing on that because we&rsquo;re understanding the needs from the disease front.</p>
<p>So you have a sense of the entire pipeline, I mean, one, maybe you can indulge me.</p>
<p>One nice question to ask would be, how do you, from the scientific perspective, go from</p>
<p>knowing nothing about the disease to going, you said, to go into the entire pipeline and</p>
<p>actually have a drug or a treatment that cures that disease?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an enormously long path and an enormously great challenge.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m trying to argue is that it progresses in stages of understanding rather than one</p>
<p>gene at a time.</p>
<p>The traditional view of biology was you have one postdoc working on this gene and another</p>
<p>postdoc working on that gene, and they&rsquo;ll just figure out everything about that gene</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s their job.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve realized how polygenic the diseases are, so we can&rsquo;t have one postdoc per gene</p>
<p>anymore.</p>
<p>We now have to have these cross cutting needs.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to describe the path to circuitry along those needs.</p>
<p>And every single one of these paths, we are now doing in parallel across thousands of</p>
<p>genes.</p>
<p>So the first step is you have a genetic association, and we talked a little bit about sort of the</p>
<p>Mendelian path and the polygenic path to that association.</p>
<p>So the Mendelian path was looking through families to basically find gene regions and</p>
<p>ultimately genes that are underlying particular disorders.</p>
<p>The polygenic path is basically looking at unrelated individuals in this giant matrix</p>
<p>of genotype by phenotype, and then finding hits where a particular variant impacts disease</p>
<p>all the way to the end.</p>
<p>And then we now have a connection, not between a gene and a disease, but between a genetic</p>
<p>region and a disease.</p>
<p>And that distinction is not understood by most people.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to explain it a little bit more.</p>
<p>Why do we not have a connection between a gene and a disease, but we have a connection</p>
<p>between a genetic region and a disease?</p>
<p>The reason for that is that 93% of genetic variants that are associated with disease</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t impact the protein at all.</p>
<p>So if you look at the human genome, there&rsquo;s 20,000 genes, there&rsquo;s 3.2 billion nucleotides.</p>
<p>Only 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins.</p>
<p>The other 98.5% does not code for proteins.</p>
<p>If you now look at where are the disease variants located, 93% of them fall in that outside</p>
<p>the genes portion.</p>
<p>Of course, genes are enriched, but they&rsquo;re only enriched by a factor of three.</p>
<p>That means that still 93% of genetic variants fall outside the proteins.</p>
<p>Why is that difficult?</p>
<p>Why is that a problem?</p>
<p>The problem is that when a variant falls outside the gene, you don&rsquo;t know what gene is impacted</p>
<p>by that variant.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say, oh, it&rsquo;s near this gene, let&rsquo;s just connect that variant to the gene.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that the genome circuitry is very often long range.</p>
<p>So you basically have that genetic variant that could sit in the intron of one gene.</p>
<p>An intron is sort of the place between the exons that code for proteins.</p>
<p>So proteins are split up into exons and introns and every exon codes for a particular subset</p>
<p>of amino acids and together they&rsquo;re spliced together and then make the final protein.</p>
<p>So that genetic variant might be sitting in an intron of a gene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s transcribed with the gene, it&rsquo;s processed and then excised, but it might not impact</p>
<p>this gene at all.</p>
<p>It might actually impact another gene that&rsquo;s a million nucleotides away.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just riding along even though it has nothing to do with this nearby neighborhood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>The strongest genetic association with obesity was discovered in this FTO gene, fat and obesity</p>
<p>associated gene.</p>
<p>So this FTO gene was studied ad nauseum.</p>
<p>People did tons of experiments on it.</p>
<p>They figured out that FTO is in fact RNA methylation transferase.</p>
<p>It basically impacts something that we call the epitranscriptome.</p>
<p>Just like the genome can be modified, the transcriptome, the transcript of the genes</p>
<p>can be modified.</p>
<p>And we basically said, oh great, that means that epitranscriptomics is hugely involved</p>
<p>in obesity because that gene FTO is clearly where the genetic locus is at.</p>
<p>My group studied FTO in collaboration with a wonderful team led by Melina Klausnitzer.</p>
<p>And what we found is that this FTO locus, even though it is as associated with obesity,</p>
<p>does not implicate the FTO gene.</p>
<p>The genetic variance, it&rsquo;s in the first intron of the FTO gene, but it controls two genes</p>
<p>IRX3 and IRX5 that are sitting 1.2 million nucleotides away, several genes away.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to feel about that because isn&rsquo;t that like super complicated then?</p>
<p>So the way that I was introduced at a conference a few years ago was, and here&rsquo;s Manolis Kellis</p>
<p>who wrote the most depressing paper of 2015.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that the entire pharmaceutical industry was so comfortable</p>
<p>that there was a single gene in that locus.</p>
<p>Because in some loci, you basically have three dozen genes that are all sitting in the same</p>
<p>region of association and you&rsquo;re like, oh gosh, which ones of those is it?</p>
<p>But even that question of which ones of those is it is making the assumption that it is</p>
<p>one of those as opposed to some random gene just far, far away, which is what our paper</p>
<p>showed.</p>
<p>So basically what our paper showed is that you can&rsquo;t ignore the circuitry.</p>
<p>You have to first figure out the circuitry, all of those long range interactions, how</p>
<p>every genetic variant impacts the expression of every gene in every tissue imaginable across</p>
<p>hundreds of individuals.</p>
<p>And then you now have one of the building blocks, not even all of the building blocks</p>
<p>for then going and understanding disease.</p>
<p>So embrace the wholeness of the circuitry.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So back to the question of starting knowing nothing to the disease and going to the treatment.</p>
<p>So what are the next steps?</p>
<p>So you basically have to first figure out the tissue and then describe how you figure</p>
<p>out the tissue.</p>
<p>You figure out the tissue by taking all of these non coding variants that are sitting</p>
<p>outside proteins and then figuring out what are the epigenomic enrichments.</p>
<p>And the reason for that, you know, thankfully is that there is convergence, that the same</p>
<p>processes are impacted in different ways by different loci.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a saving grace for our field.</p>
<p>The fact that if I look at hundreds of genetic variants associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, they</p>
<p>localize in a small number of processes.</p>
<p>Can you clarify why that&rsquo;s hopeful?</p>
<p>So like they show up in the same exact way in the, in the specific set of processes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So basically there&rsquo;s a small number of biological processes that underlie, or at least that</p>
<p>play the biggest role in every disorder.</p>
<p>So in Alzheimer&rsquo;s you basically have, you know, maybe 10 different types of processes.</p>
<p>One of them is lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>One of them is immune cell function.</p>
<p>One of them is neuronal energetics.</p>
<p>So these are just a small number of processes, but you have multiple lesions, multiple genetic</p>
<p>perturbations that are associated with those processes.</p>
<p>So if you look at schizophrenia, it&rsquo;s excitatory neuron function, it&rsquo;s inhibitory neuron function,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s synaptic pruning, it&rsquo;s calcium signaling and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So when you look at disease genetics, you have one hit here and one hit there and one</p>
<p>hit there and one hit there, completely different parts of the genome.</p>
<p>But it turns out all of those hits are calcium signaling proteins.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, aha.</p>
<p>That means that calcium signaling is important.</p>
<p>So those people who are focusing on one doctor at a time cannot possibly see that picture.</p>
<p>You have to become a genomicist.</p>
<p>You have to look at the omics, the om, the holistic picture to understand these enrichments.</p>
<p>But you mentioned the convergence thing.</p>
<p>The whatever the thing associated with the disease shows up.</p>
<p>So let me explain convergence.</p>
<p>Convergence is such a beautiful concept.</p>
<p>So you basically have these four genes that are converging on calcium signaling.</p>
<p>So that basically means that they are acting each in their own way, but together in the</p>
<p>same process.</p>
<p>But now in every one of these loci, you have many enhancers controlling each of those genes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another type of convergence where dysregulation of seven different enhancers might all converge</p>
<p>on dysregulation of that one gene, which then converges on calcium signaling.</p>
<p>And in each one of those enhancers, you might have multiple genetic variants distributed</p>
<p>across many different people.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own different mutation.</p>
<p>But all of these mutations are impacting that enhancer.</p>
<p>And all of these enhancers are impacting that gene.</p>
<p>And all of these genes are impacting this pathway.</p>
<p>And all these pathways are acting in the same tissue.</p>
<p>And all of these tissues are converging together on the same biological process of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying the saving grace is that that conversion seems to happen for a lot</p>
<p>of these diseases.</p>
<p>For all of them.</p>
<p>Basically that for every single disease that we&rsquo;ve looked at, we have found an epigenomic</p>
<p>enrichment.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>You basically have all of the genetic variants associated with the disorder.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re asking for all of the enhancers active in a particular tissue.</p>
<p>For 540 disorders, we&rsquo;ve basically found that indeed there is an enrichment.</p>
<p>That basically means that there is commonality.</p>
<p>And from the commonality, we can just get insights.</p>
<p>So to explain in mathematical terms, we&rsquo;re basically building an empirical prior.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using a Bayesian approach to basically say, great, all of these variants are equally</p>
<p>likely in a particular locus to be important.</p>
<p>So in a genetic locus, you basically have a dozen variants that are coinherited.</p>
<p>Because the way that inheritance works in the human genome is through all of these recombination</p>
<p>events during meiosis, you basically have, you know, you inherit maybe three, chromosome</p>
<p>three, for example, in your body is inherited from four different parts.</p>
<p>One part comes from your dad, another part comes from your mom, another part comes from</p>
<p>your dad, another part comes from your mom.</p>
<p>So basically, the way that it, sorry, from your mom&rsquo;s mom.</p>
<p>So you basically have one copy that comes from your dad and one copy that comes from</p>
<p>your mom.</p>
<p>But that copy that you got from your mom is a mixture of her maternal and her paternal</p>
<p>chromosome.</p>
<p>And the copy that you got from your dad is a mixture of his maternal and his paternal</p>
<p>chromosome.</p>
<p>So these breakpoints that happen when chromosomes are lining up are basically ensuring through</p>
<p>these crossover events, they&rsquo;re ensuring that every child cell during the process of meiosis,</p>
<p>where you basically have, you know, one spermatozoid that basically couples with one ovule to basically</p>
<p>create one egg to basically create the zygote.</p>
<p>You basically have half of your genome that comes from dad and half your genome that comes</p>
<p>from mom.</p>
<p>But in order to line them up, you basically have these crossover events.</p>
<p>These crossover events are basically leading to coinheritance of that entire block coming</p>
<p>from your maternal grandmother and that entire block coming from your maternal grandfather.</p>
<p>Over many generations, these crossover events don&rsquo;t happen randomly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a protein called PRDM9 that basically guides the double stranded breaks and then</p>
<p>leads to these crossovers.</p>
<p>And that protein has a particular preference to only a small number of hotspots of recombination,</p>
<p>which then lead to a small number of breaks between these coinheritance patterns.</p>
<p>So even though there are 6 million variants, there are 6 million loci, this variation is</p>
<p>inherited in blocks and every one of these blocks has like two dozen genetic variants</p>
<p>that are all associated.</p>
<p>So in the case of FTO, it wasn&rsquo;t just one variant, it was 89 common variants that were</p>
<p>all humongously associated with obesity.</p>
<p>Which one of those is the important one?</p>
<p>Well, if you look at only one locus, you have no idea.</p>
<p>But if you look at many loci, you basically say, aha, all of them are enriching in the</p>
<p>same epigenomic map.</p>
<p>In that particular case, it was mesenchymal stem cells.</p>
<p>So these are the progenitor cells that give rise to your brown fat and your white fat.</p>
<p>Progenitor is like the early on developmental stem cells?</p>
<p>So you start from one zygote and that&rsquo;s a totipotent cell type.</p>
<p>It can do anything.</p>
<p>You then, you know, that cell divides, divides, divides, and then every cell division is leading</p>
<p>to specialization where you now have a mesodermal lineage and ectodermal lineage and endodermal</p>
<p>lineage that basically leads to different parts of your body.</p>
<p>The ectoderm will basically give rise to your skin, ecto means outside, derm is skin.</p>
<p>So ectoderm, but it also gives rise to your neurons and your whole brain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of ectoderm.</p>
<p>Mesoderm gives rise to your internal organs, including the vasculature and you know, your</p>
<p>muscle and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So you basically have this progressive differentiation and then if you look further, further down</p>
<p>that lineage, you basically have one lineage that will give rise to both your muscle and</p>
<p>your bone, but also your fat.</p>
<p>And if you go further down the lineage of your fat, you basically have your white fat</p>
<p>cells.</p>
<p>These are the cells that store energy.</p>
<p>So when you eat a lot, but you don&rsquo;t exercise too much, there&rsquo;s an excess set of calories,</p>
<p>excess energy.</p>
<p>What do you do with those?</p>
<p>You basically create, you spend a lot of that energy to create these high energy molecules,</p>
<p>lipids, which you can then burn when you need them on a rainy day.</p>
<p>So that leads to obesity if you don&rsquo;t exercise and if you overeat because your body&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh great, I have all these calories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to store them.</p>
<p>Ooh, more calories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to store them too.</p>
<p>Ooh, more calories.</p>
<p>So basically the 42% of European chromosomes have a predisposition to storing fat, which</p>
<p>was selected probably in the food scarcity periods, like basically as we were exiting</p>
<p>Africa before and during the ice ages, there was probably a selection to those individuals</p>
<p>who made it North to basically be able to store energy, a lot more energy.</p>
<p>So you basically now have this lineage that is deciding whether you want to store energy</p>
<p>in your white fat or burn energy in your beige fat.</p>
<p>It turns out that your fat is, you know, like we have such a bad view of fat.</p>
<p>Fat is your best friend.</p>
<p>Fat can both store all these excess lipids that would be otherwise circulating through</p>
<p>your body and causing damage, but it can also burn calories directly.</p>
<p>If you have too much energy, you can just choose to just burn some of that as heat.</p>
<p>So basically when you&rsquo;re cold, you&rsquo;re burning energy to basically warm your body up and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning all these lipids and you&rsquo;re burning all these calories.</p>
<p>So what we basically found is that across the board, genetic variants associated with</p>
<p>obesity across many of these regions were all enriched repeatedly in mesenchymal stem</p>
<p>cell enhancers.</p>
<p>So that gave us a hint as to which of these genetic variants was likely driving this whole</p>
<p>association.</p>
<p>And we ended up with this one genetic variant called RS1421085.</p>
<p>And that genetic variant out of the 89 was the one that we predicted to be causal for</p>
<p>the disease.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So going back to those steps, first step is figure out the relevant tissue based on the</p>
<p>global enrichment.</p>
<p>Second step is figure out the causal variant among many variants in this linkage disequilibrium</p>
<p>in this coinherited block between these recombination hotspots, these boundaries of these inherited</p>
<p>blocks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the second step.</p>
<p>The third step is once you know that causal variant, try to figure out what is the motif</p>
<p>that is disrupted by that causal variant.</p>
<p>Basically how does it act?</p>
<p>Variants don&rsquo;t just disrupt elements, they disrupt the binding of specific regulators.</p>
<p>So basically the third step there was how do you find the motif that is responsible</p>
<p>like the gene regulatory word, the building block of gene regulation that is responsible</p>
<p>for that dysregulatory event.</p>
<p>And the fourth step is finding out what regulator normally binds that motif and is now no longer</p>
<p>able to bind.</p>
<p>And then once you have the regulator, can you then try to figure out how to, what after</p>
<p>it developed, how to fix it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>You now know how to intervene.</p>
<p>You have basically a regulator, you have a gene that you can then perturb and you say,</p>
<p>well, maybe that regulator has a global role in obesity.</p>
<p>I can perturb the regulator.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, when we say perturb, like on the scale of a human life, can a human</p>
<p>being be helped?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess understanding is the first step.</p>
<p>No, no, but perturbed basically means you now develop therapeutics, pharmaceutical therapeutics</p>
<p>against that.</p>
<p>Or you develop other types of intervention that affect the expression of that gene.</p>
<p>What do pharmaceutical therapeutics look like when your understanding is on a genetic level?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry if it&rsquo;s a dumb question.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant question, but I want to save it for a little bit later when we start talking</p>
<p>about therapeutics.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the first four steps.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two more.</p>
<p>So basically the first step is figure out, I mean, the zero step, the starting point</p>
<p>is the genetics.</p>
<p>The first step after that is figure out the tissue of action.</p>
<p>The second step is figuring out the nucleotide that is responsible or set of nucleotides.</p>
<p>The third step is figuring out the motif and the upstream regulator, number four.</p>
<p>Number five and six is what are the targets?</p>
<p>So number five is great.</p>
<p>Now I know the regulator.</p>
<p>I know the motif.</p>
<p>I know the tissue and I know the variant.</p>
<p>What does it actually do?</p>
<p>So you have to now trace it to the biological process and the genes that mediate that biological</p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>So knowing all of this can now allow you to find the target genes.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>By basically doing perturbation experiments or by looking at the folding of the epigenome</p>
<p>or by looking at the genetic impact of that genetic variant on the expression of genes.</p>
<p>And we use all three.</p>
<p>So let me go through them.</p>
<p>Basically one of them is physical links.</p>
<p>This is the folding of the genome onto itself.</p>
<p>How do you even figure out the folding?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of a tangent, but it&rsquo;s a super awesome technology.</p>
<p>Think of the genome as again, this massive packaging that we talked about of taking two</p>
<p>meters worth of DNA and putting it in something that&rsquo;s a million times smaller than two meters</p>
<p>worth of DNA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a single cell.</p>
<p>You basically have this massive packaging and this packaging basically leads to the</p>
<p>chromosome being wrapped around in sort of tight, tight ways in ways, however, that are</p>
<p>functionally capable of being reopened and reclosed.</p>
<p>So I can then go in and figure out that folding by sort of chopping up the spaghetti soup,</p>
<p>putting glue and ligating the segments that were chopped up but nearby each other, and</p>
<p>then sequencing through these ligation events to figure out that this region of this chromosome,</p>
<p>that region of the chromosome were near each other.</p>
<p>That means they were interacting even though they were far away on the genome itself.</p>
<p>So that chopping up, sequencing and reglueing is basically giving you folds of the genome</p>
<p>that we call.</p>
<p>Sorry, can you backtrack?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>How does cutting it help you figure out which ones were close in the original folding?</p>
<p>So you have a bowl of noodles.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>And in that bowl of noodles, some noodles are near each other.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you throw in a bunch of glue, you basically freeze the noodles in place, throw in a cutter</p>
<p>that chops up the noodles into little pieces.</p>
<p>Now throw in some ligation enzyme that lets those pieces that were free religate near</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>In some cases, they religate what you had just cut, but that&rsquo;s very rare.</p>
<p>Most of the time they will religate in whatever was proximal.</p>
<p>You now have glued the red noodle that was crossing the blue noodle to each other.</p>
<p>You then reverse the glue, the glue goes away and you just sequence the heck out of it.</p>
<p>Most of the time you&rsquo;ll find red segment with, you know, red segment, but you can specifically</p>
<p>select for ligation events that have happened that were not from the same segment by sort</p>
<p>of marking them in a particular way and then selecting those and then you sequence and</p>
<p>you look for red with blue matches of sort of things that were glued that were not immediate</p>
<p>proximal to each other.</p>
<p>And that reveals the linking of the blue noodle and the red noodle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re with me so far?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done these experiments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the physical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s step one of the physical.</p>
<p>And what the physical revealed is topologically associated domains, basically big blocks of</p>
<p>the genome that are topologically connected together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the physical.</p>
<p>The second one is the genetic links.</p>
<p>It basically says across individuals that have different genetic variants, how are their</p>
<p>genes expressed differently?</p>
<p>Remember before I was saying that the path between genetics and disease is enormous,</p>
<p>but we can break it up to look at the path between genetics and gene expression.</p>
<p>So instead of using Alzheimer&rsquo;s as a phenotype, I can now use expression of IRX3 as the phenotype,</p>
<p>expression of gene A. And I can look at all of the humans who contain a G at that location</p>
<p>and all the humans that contain a T at that location and basically say, wow, it turns</p>
<p>out that the expression of each gene is higher for the T humans than for the G humans at</p>
<p>that location.</p>
<p>So that basically gives me a genetic link between a genetic variant, a locus, a region,</p>
<p>and the expression of nearby genes.</p>
<p>Good on the genetic link?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>The third genetic link is the activity link.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an activity link?</p>
<p>It basically says if I look across 833 different epigenomes, whenever this enhancer is active,</p>
<p>this gene is active.</p>
<p>That gives me an activity link between this region of the DNA and that gene.</p>
<p>And then the fourth one is perturbations where I can go in and blow up that region and see</p>
<p>what are the genes that change in expression, or I can go in and over activate that region</p>
<p>and see what genes change in expression.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s similar to activity?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s basically similar to activity.</p>
<p>I agree, but it&rsquo;s causal rather than correlational.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m a little weird.</p>
<p>No, no, you&rsquo;re 100% on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the same as the perturbation where I go in and intervene.</p>
<p>I basically take a bunch of cells.</p>
<p>So you know CRISPR, right?</p>
<p>CRISPR is this genome guidance and cutting mechanism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what George Church likes to call genome vandalism.</p>
<p>So you basically are able to, you can basically take a guide RNA that you put into the CRISPR</p>
<p>system, and the CRISPR system will basically use this guide RNA, scan the genome, find</p>
<p>wherever there&rsquo;s a match, and then cut the genome.</p>
<p>So I digress, but it&rsquo;s a bacterial immune defense system.</p>
<p>So basically bacteria are constantly attacked by viruses, but sometimes they win against</p>
<p>the viruses and they chop up these viruses.</p>
<p>And remember as a trophy inside their genome, they have these loci, these CRISPR loci that</p>
<p>basically stands for clustered repeats, interspersed, et cetera.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s an interspersed repeats structure where basically you have a set of</p>
<p>repetitive regions and then interspersed where these variable segments that were basically</p>
<p>matching viruses.</p>
<p>So when this was first discovered, it was basically hypothesized that this is probably</p>
<p>a bacterial immune system that remembers the trophies of the viruses that managed to kill.</p>
<p>And then the bacteria pass on, you know, they sort of do lateral transfer of DNA and they</p>
<p>pass on these memories so that the next bacterium says, Ooh, you killed that guy.</p>
<p>When that guy shows up again, I will recognize him.</p>
<p>And the CRISPR system was basically evolved as a bacterial adaptive immune response to</p>
<p>sense foreigners that should not belong and to just go and cut their genome.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an RNA guided RNA cutting enzyme or an RNA guided DNA cutting enzyme.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different systems.</p>
<p>Some of them cut DNA, some of them cut RNA, but all of them remember this sort of viral</p>
<p>attack.</p>
<p>So what we have done now as a field is, you know, through the work of, you know, Jennifer</p>
<p>Donne, Manuel Carpentier, Feng Zhang and many others is coopted that system of bacterial</p>
<p>immune defense as a way to cut genomes.</p>
<p>You basically have this guiding system that allows you to use an RNA guide to bring enzymes</p>
<p>to cut DNA at a particular locus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>So this is like already a natural mechanism, a natural tool for cutting those useful as</p>
<p>particular context.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, well, we can use that thing to actually, it&rsquo;s a nice tool that&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>in the body.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in our body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the bacterial body.</p>
<p>It was discovered by the yogurt industry.</p>
<p>They were trying to make better yogurts and they were trying to make their bacteria in</p>
<p>their yogurt cultures more resilient to viruses.</p>
<p>And they were studying bacteria and they found that, wow, this CRISPR system is awesome.</p>
<p>It allows you to defend against that.</p>
<p>And then it was coopted in mammalian systems that don&rsquo;t use anything like that as a targeting</p>
<p>way to basically bring these DNA cutting enzymes to any locus in the genome.</p>
<p>Why would you want to cut DNA to do anything?</p>
<p>The reason is that our DNA has a DNA repair mechanism where if a region of the genome</p>
<p>gets randomly cut, you will basically scan the genome for anything that matches and sort</p>
<p>of use it by homology.</p>
<p>So the reason why we&rsquo;re deployed is because we now have a spare copy.</p>
<p>As soon as my mom&rsquo;s copy is deactivated, I can use my dad&rsquo;s copy.</p>
<p>And somewhere else, if my dad&rsquo;s copy is deactivated, I can use my mom&rsquo;s copy to repair it.</p>
<p>So this is called homologous based repair.</p>
<p>So all you have to do is the cutting and you don&rsquo;t have to do the fixing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do the fixing.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s already built in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>But the fixing can be coopted by throwing in a bunch of homologous segments that instead</p>
<p>of having your dad&rsquo;s version, have whatever other version you&rsquo;d like to use.</p>
<p>So you then control the fixing by throwing in a bunch of other stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you do genome editing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what CRISPR is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what CRISPR is.</p>
<p>In popular culture, people use the term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, wow, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So CRISPR is genome vandalism followed by a bunch of band aids that have the sequence</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>And you could control the choices of band aids.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s new generations of CRISPR.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s called prime editing that was sort of very, very much in the press</p>
<p>recently that basically instead of sort of making a double stranded break, which again</p>
<p>is genome vandalism, you basically make a single stranded break.</p>
<p>You basically just nick one of the two strands, enabling you to sort of peel off without sort</p>
<p>of completely breaking it up and then repair it locally using a guide that is coupled to</p>
<p>your initial RNA that took you to that location.</p>
<p>Dumb question, but is CRISPR as awesome and cool as it sounds?</p>
<p>I mean, technically speaking, in terms of like as a tool for manipulating our genetics</p>
<p>in the positive meaning of the word manipulating, or is there downsides, drawbacks in this whole</p>
<p>context of therapeutics that we&rsquo;re talking about or understanding and so on?</p>
<p>So when I teach my students about CRISPR, I show them articles with the headline, genome</p>
<p>editing tool revolutionizes biology.</p>
<p>And then I show them the date of these articles and they&rsquo;re 2004, like five years before CRISPR</p>
<p>was invented.</p>
<p>And the reason is that they&rsquo;re not talking about CRISPR.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about zinc finger enzymes that are another way to bring these cutters</p>
<p>to the genome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very difficult way of sort of designing the right set of zinc finger proteins, the</p>
<p>right set of amino acids that will now target a particular long stretch of DNA because for</p>
<p>every location that you want to target, you need to design a particular regulator, a particular</p>
<p>protein that will match that region well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another technology called talons, which are basically just a different way of</p>
<p>using proteins to sort of guide these cutters to a particular location of the genome.</p>
<p>These require a massive team of engineers, of biological engineers to basically design</p>
<p>a set of amino acids that will target a particular sequence of your genome.</p>
<p>The reason why CRISPR is amazingly, awesomely revolutionary is because instead of having</p>
<p>this team of engineers design a new set of proteins for every locus that you want to</p>
<p>target, you just type it in your computer and you just synthesize an RNA guide.</p>
<p>The beauty of CRISPR is not the cutting, it&rsquo;s not the fixing.</p>
<p>All of that was there before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the guiding, and the only thing that changes is that it makes the guiding easier</p>
<p>by sort of just typing in the RNA sequence, which then allows the system to sort of scan</p>
<p>the DNA to find that.</p>
<p>So the coding, the engineering of the cutter is easier in terms of SP.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of similar to the story of deep learning versus old school machine learning.</p>
<p>Some of the challenging parts are automated.</p>
<p>But CRISPR is just one cutting technology, and then that&rsquo;s part of the challenges and</p>
<p>exciting opportunities of the field is to design different cutting technologies.</p>
<p>So now this was a big parenthesis on CRISPR, but now when we were talking about perturbations,</p>
<p>you basically now have the ability to not just look at correlation between enhancers</p>
<p>and genes, but actually go and either destroy that enhancer and see if the gene changes</p>
<p>in expression, or you can use the CRISPR targeting system to bring in not vandalism and cutting,</p>
<p>but you can couple the CRISPR system with, and the CRISPR system is called usually CRISPR</p>
<p>Cas9 because Cas9 is the protein that will then come and cut.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a version of that protein called dead Cas9 where the cutting part is deactivated.</p>
<p>So you basically use the dead Cas9 to bring in an activator or to bring in a repressor.</p>
<p>So you can now ask, is this enhancer changing that gene by taking this modified CRISPR,</p>
<p>which is already modified from the bacteria to be used in humans, that you can now modify</p>
<p>the Cas9 to be dead Cas9, and you can now further modify to bring in a regulator, and</p>
<p>you can basically turn on or turn off that enhancer and then see what is the impact on</p>
<p>that gene.</p>
<p>So these are the four ways of linking the locus to the target gene, and that&rsquo;s step</p>
<p>number five.</p>
<p>Step number five is find the target gene, and step number six is what the heck does</p>
<p>that gene do?</p>
<p>You basically now go and manipulate that gene to basically see what are the processes that</p>
<p>change, and you can basically ask, well, in this particular case, in the FTO locus, we</p>
<p>found mesenchymal stem cells that are the progenitors of white fat and brown fat or</p>
<p>beige fat.</p>
<p>We found the RS1421085 nucleotide variant as the causal variant.</p>
<p>We found this large enhancer, this master regulator.</p>
<p>I like to call it OB1 for obesity one, like the strongest enhancer associated with it,</p>
<p>and OB1 was kind of chubby as the actor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember him.</p>
<p>So you basically are using this Jedi mind trick to basically find out the location of</p>
<p>the genome that is responsible, the enhancer that harbors it, the motif, the upstream regulator,</p>
<p>which is ARID5B for AT rich interacting domain 5B.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a protein that sort of comes and binds normally.</p>
<p>That protein is normally a repressor.</p>
<p>It represses this super enhancer, this massive 12,000 nucleotide master regulatory control</p>
<p>gene, and it turns off IRX3, which is a gene that&rsquo;s 600,000 nucleotides away, and IRX5,</p>
<p>which is 1.2 million nucleotides away.</p>
<p>So those things.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the effect of turning them off?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the next question.</p>
<p>So step six is what do these genes actually do?</p>
<p>So we then ask, what does RX3 and RX5 do?</p>
<p>The first thing we did is look across individuals for individuals that had higher expression</p>
<p>of RX3 or lower expression RX3.</p>
<p>And then we looked at the expression of all of the other genes in the genome.</p>
<p>And we looked for simply correlation.</p>
<p>And we found that RX3 and RX5 were both correlated positively with lipid metabolism and negatively</p>
<p>with mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, what the heck does that mean?</p>
<p>Does this sound related to obesity?</p>
<p>Not at all superficially, but lipid metabolism should, because lipids is these high and</p>
<p>energy molecules that basically store fat.</p>
<p>So RX3 and RX5 are negatively correlated with lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>So that basically means that when they turn on, positively, when they turn on, they turn</p>
<p>on lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re negatively correlated with mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>
<p>What do mitochondria do in this whole process?</p>
<p>Again, small parenthesis, what are mitochondria?</p>
<p>Mitochondria are little organelles.</p>
<p>They arose, they only are found in eukaryotes.</p>
<p>U means good, karyote means nucleus.</p>
<p>So truly like a true nucleus.</p>
<p>So eukaryotes have a nucleus.</p>
<p>Prokaryotes are before the nucleus.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a nucleus.</p>
<p>So eukaryotes have a nucleus, compartmentalization.</p>
<p>Eukaryotes have also organelles.</p>
<p>Some eukaryotes have chloroplasts.</p>
<p>These are the plants, they photosynthesize.</p>
<p>Some other eukaryotes like us have another type of organelle called mitochondria.</p>
<p>These arose from an ancient species that we engulfed.</p>
<p>This is an endosymbiosis event.</p>
<p>Symbiosis bio means life, sim means together.</p>
<p>So symbiotes are things that live together.</p>
<p>Symbiosis endo means inside, so endosymbiosis means you live together holding the other</p>
<p>one inside you.</p>
<p>So the pre eukaryotes engulfed an organism that was very good at energy production and</p>
<p>that organism eventually shed most of its genome to now have only 13 genes in the mitochondrial</p>
<p>genome and those 13 genes are all involved in energy production, the electron transport</p>
<p>chain.</p>
<p>So basically electrons are these massive super energy rich molecules.</p>
<p>We basically have these organelles that produce energy and when your muscle exercises, you</p>
<p>basically multiply your mitochondria.</p>
<p>You basically sort of, you know, use more and more mitochondria and that&rsquo;s how you get</p>
<p>beefed up.</p>
<p>So basically the muscle sort of learns how to generate more energy.</p>
<p>So basically every single time your muscles will, you know, overnight regenerate and sort</p>
<p>of become stronger and amplify their mitochondria and so forth.</p>
<p>So what does mitochondria do?</p>
<p>The mitochondria use energy to sort of do any kind of task.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re thinking, you&rsquo;re using energy.</p>
<p>This energy comes from mitochondria.</p>
<p>Your neurons have mitochondria all over the place.</p>
<p>Basically this mitochondria can multiply as organelles and they can be spread along the</p>
<p>body of your muscle.</p>
<p>Some of your muscle cells have actually multiple nuclei, they&rsquo;re polynucleated, but they also</p>
<p>have multiple mitochondria to basically deal with the fact that your muscle is enormous.</p>
<p>You can sort of span these super, super long length and you need energy throughout the</p>
<p>length of your muscle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you have mitochondria throughout the length and you also need transcription</p>
<p>through the length so you have multiple nuclei as well.</p>
<p>So these two processes, lipids store energy, what do mitochondria do?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a process known as thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Thermal heat, genesis generation.</p>
<p>Thermogenesis is the generation of heat.</p>
<p>Remember that bathtub with the in and out?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the equation that everybody&rsquo;s focused on.</p>
<p>So how much energy do you consume?</p>
<p>How much energy do you burn?</p>
<p>But in every thermodynamic system, there&rsquo;s three parts to the equation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s energy in, energy out, and energy lost.</p>
<p>Any machine has loss of energy.</p>
<p>How do you lose energy?</p>
<p>You emanate heat.</p>
<p>So heat is energy loss.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Which is where the thermogenesis comes in.</p>
<p>Thermogenesis is actually a regulatory process that modulates the third component of the</p>
<p>thermodynamic equation.</p>
<p>You can basically control thermogenesis explicitly.</p>
<p>You can turn on and turn off thermogenesis.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the mitochondria comes into play.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So Irix3 and RX5 turn out to be the master regulators of a process of thermogenesis versus</p>
<p>lipogenesis generation of fat.</p>
<p>So Irix3 and RX5 in most people burn heat, burn calories as heat.</p>
<p>So when you eat too much, just burn it off in your fat cells.</p>
<p>So that bathtub has basically a sort of dissipation knob that most people are able to turn on.</p>
<p>I am unable to turn that on because I am a homozygous carrier for the mutation that changes</p>
<p>a T into a C in the RS1421085 allele and locus, a SNP.</p>
<p>I have the risk allele twice from my mom and from my dad.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m unable to thermogenize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unable to turn on thermogenesis through Irix3 and RX5 because the regulator that normally</p>
<p>binds here, Irix5b, can no longer bind because it&rsquo;s an AT rich interacting domain.</p>
<p>And as soon as I change the T into a C, it can no longer bind because it&rsquo;s no longer</p>
<p>AT rich.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t that mean that you&rsquo;re able to use the energy more efficiently?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not generating heat or is that?</p>
<p>That means I can eat less and get around just fine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a feature actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feature in a food scarce environment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re all starving, I&rsquo;m doing great.</p>
<p>If we all have access to massive amounts of food, I&rsquo;m obese basically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s taken us to the entire process of then understanding that why mitochondria and then</p>
<p>the lipids are both, even though distant, are somehow involved.</p>
<p>Different sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>And you basically choose to store energy or you can choose to burn energy.</p>
<p>And then all of that is involved in the puzzle of obesity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s fascinating, right?</p>
<p>Here we are in 2007, discovering the strongest genetic association with obesity and knowing</p>
<p>nothing about how it works for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>For 10 years, everybody focused on this FTO gene and they were like, oh, it must have</p>
<p>to do something with RNA modification.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, it has nothing to do with the function of FTO.</p>
<p>It has everything to do with all of these other processes.</p>
<p>And suddenly the moment you solve that puzzle, which is a multiyear effort by the way, a</p>
<p>tremendous effort by Melina and many, many others.</p>
<p>So this tremendous effort basically led us to recognize this circuitry.</p>
<p>You went from having some 89 common variants associated in that region of the DNA sitting</p>
<p>on top of this gene to knowing the whole circuitry.</p>
<p>When you know the circuitry, you can now go crazy.</p>
<p>You can now start intervening at every level.</p>
<p>You can start intervening at the arid 5B level.</p>
<p>You can start intervening with CRISPR Cas9 at the single SNP level.</p>
<p>You can start intervening at iRx3 and iRx5 directly there.</p>
<p>You can start intervening at the thermogenesis level because you know the pathway.</p>
<p>You can start intervening at the differentiation level where the decision to make either white</p>
<p>fat or beige fat, the energy burning beige fat is made developmentally in the first three</p>
<p>days of differentiation of your adipocytes.</p>
<p>So as they&rsquo;re differentiating, you basically can choose to make fat burning machines or</p>
<p>fat storing machines.</p>
<p>And sort of that&rsquo;s how you populate your fat.</p>
<p>You basically can now go in pharmaceutical and do all of that.</p>
<p>And in our paper, we actually did all of that.</p>
<p>We went in and manipulated every single aspect.</p>
<p>At the nucleotide level, we use CRISPR Cas9 genome editing to basically take primary adipocytes</p>
<p>from risk and non risk individuals and show that by editing that one nucleotide out of</p>
<p>3.2 billion nucleotides in the human genome, you could then flip between an obese phenotype</p>
<p>and a lean phenotype like a switch.</p>
<p>You can basically take my cells that are non thermogenizing and just flip into thermogenizing</p>
<p>cells by changing one nucleotide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mind boggling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so inspiring that this puzzle could be solved in this way and it feels within reach</p>
<p>to then be able to crack the problem of some of these diseases.</p>
<p>What are the technologies, the tools that came along that made this possible?</p>
<p>What are you excited about?</p>
<p>Maybe if we just look at the buffet of things that you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned, what&rsquo;s involved?</p>
<p>What should we be excited about?</p>
<p>What are you excited about?</p>
<p>I love that question because there&rsquo;s so much ahead of us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so, so much.</p>
<p>So basically solving that one locus required massive amounts of knowledge that we have</p>
<p>been building across the years through the epigenome, through the comparative genomics</p>
<p>to find out the causal variant and the controller regulatory motif through the conserved circuitry.</p>
<p>It required knowing these regulatory genomic wiring.</p>
<p>It required high C of these sort of topologically associated domains to basically find these</p>
<p>long range interaction.</p>
<p>It required EQTLs of these sort of genetic perturbation of these intermediate gene phenotypes.</p>
<p>It required all of the arsenal of tools that I&rsquo;ve been describing was put together for</p>
<p>one locus.</p>
<p>And this was a massive team effort, huge investment in time, energy, money, effort, intellectual,</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referring to, I&rsquo;m sorry, just for the obesity one.</p>
<p>Yeah, this one paper.</p>
<p>This one single paper.</p>
<p>This one single locus.</p>
<p>I would like to say that this is a paper about one nucleotide in the human genome, about</p>
<p>one bit of information, C versus T in the human genome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one bit of information and we have 3.2 billion nucleotides to go through.</p>
<p>So how do you do that systematically?</p>
<p>I am so excited about the next phase of research because the technologies that my group and</p>
<p>many other groups have developed allows us to now do this systematically, not just one</p>
<p>locus at a time, but thousands of loci at a time.</p>
<p>So let me describe some of these technologies.</p>
<p>The first one is automation and robotics.</p>
<p>So basically, you know, we talked about how you can take all of these molecules and see</p>
<p>which of these molecules are targeting each of these genes and what do they do?</p>
<p>So you can basically now screen through millions of molecules through thousands and thousands</p>
<p>and thousands of plates, each of which has thousands and thousands and thousands of molecules,</p>
<p>every single time testing, you know, all of these genes and asking which of these molecules</p>
<p>perturb these genes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s technology number one, automation and robotics.</p>
<p>Technology number two is parallel readouts.</p>
<p>So instead of perturbing one locus and then asking if I use CRISPR Cas9 on this enhancer</p>
<p>to basically use dCas9 to turn on or turn off the enhancer, or if I use CRISPR Cas9</p>
<p>on the SNP to basically change that one SNP at a time, then what happens?</p>
<p>But we have 120,000 disease associated SNPs that we want to test.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to spend 120,000 years doing it.</p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve basically developed this technology for massively parallel reporter assays, MPRA.</p>
<p>So in collaboration with Tarsha Mikkelsen, Eric Lander, I mean, Jason Durie&rsquo;s group has</p>
<p>done a lot of that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of groups that basically have developed technologies for testing 10,000</p>
<p>genetic variants at a time.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>You know, we talked about microarray technology, the ability to synthesize these huge microarrays</p>
<p>that allow you to do all kinds of things like measure gene expression by hybridization,</p>
<p>by measuring the genotype of a person, by looking at hybridization with one version</p>
<p>with a T versus the other version with a C, and then sort of figuring out that I am a</p>
<p>risk carrier for obesity based on these differential hybridization in my genome that says, oh,</p>
<p>you seem to only have this allele or you seem to have that allele.</p>
<p>These can also be used to systematically synthesize small fragments of DNA.</p>
<p>So you can basically synthesize these 150 nucleotide long fragments across 450,000 spots</p>
<p>at a time.</p>
<p>You can now take the result of that synthesis, which basically works through all of these</p>
<p>sort of layers of adding one nucleotide at a time.</p>
<p>You can basically just type it into your computer and order it, and you can basically order</p>
<p>10,000 or 100,000 of these small DNA segments at a time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where awesome molecular biology comes in.</p>
<p>You can basically take all these segments, have a common start and end barcode or sort</p>
<p>of like Gator, just like pieces of a puzzle.</p>
<p>You can make the same end piece and the same start piece for all of them.</p>
<p>And you can now use plasmids, which are these extra chromosomal small DNA circular segments</p>
<p>that are basically inhabiting all our, all our genomes.</p>
<p>We basically have, you know, plasmids from floating around and bacteria use plasmids</p>
<p>for transferring DNA.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where they put a lot of antibiotic resistance genes.</p>
<p>So they can easily transfer them from one bacterium to the other.</p>
<p>After one bacterium evolves a gene to be resistant to a particular antibiotic, it basically says</p>
<p>to all its friends, Hey, here&rsquo;s that sort of DNA piece.</p>
<p>We can now coopt these plasmids into human cells.</p>
<p>You can basically make a human cell culture and add plasmids to that human cell culture</p>
<p>that contain the things that you want to test.</p>
<p>You now have this library of 450,000 elements.</p>
<p>You can insert them each into the common plasmid and then test them in millions of cells in</p>
<p>parallel.</p>
<p>And the common plasmid is all the same before you add it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The rest of the plasmid is the same.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s called an epizomal reporter assay.</p>
<p>Epizome means not inside the genome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of outside the chromosomes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an epizomal assay that allows you to have a variable region where you basically</p>
<p>test 10,000 different enhancers and you have a common region which basically has the same</p>
<p>reporter gene.</p>
<p>You now can do some very cool molecular biology.</p>
<p>You can basically take the 450,000 elements that you&rsquo;ve generated and you have a piece</p>
<p>of the puzzle here, piece of the puzzle here, which is identical.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re compatible with that plasmid.</p>
<p>You can chop them up in the middle to separate a barcode reporter from the enhancer and in</p>
<p>the middle put the same gene again using the same piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>You now can have a barcode readout of what is the impact of 10,000 different versions</p>
<p>of an enhancer on gene expression.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not doing one experiment, we&rsquo;re doing 10,000 experiments.</p>
<p>And those 10,000 can be 5,000 of different loci and each of them in two versions, risk</p>
<p>or non risk.</p>
<p>I can now test tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Just a little hypothesis.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you can do 10,000 and we can test 10,000 hypothesis at once.</p>
<p>How hard is it to generate those 10,000?</p>
<p>Trivial.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s biology.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Generating the 10,000 is trivial because you basically add, it&rsquo;s biotechnology.</p>
<p>You basically have these arrays that add one nucleotide at a time at every spot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s printing and so you&rsquo;re able to, you&rsquo;re able to control.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it super costly?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>10,000 bucks.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t millions.</p>
<p>10,000 bucks for 10,000 experiments sounds like the right, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, so that&rsquo;s super, that&rsquo;s exciting because you don&rsquo;t have to do one thing at a time.</p>
<p>You can now use that technology, these massively parallel reporter assays to test 10,000 locations</p>
<p>at a time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made multiple modifications to that technology.</p>
<p>One was sharper MPRA, which stands for, you know, basically getting a higher resolution</p>
<p>view by tiling these, these elements so you can see where along the region of control</p>
<p>are they acting.</p>
<p>And we made another modification called Hydra for high, you know, definition regulatory</p>
<p>annotation or something like that, which basically allows you to test 7 million of these at a</p>
<p>time by sort of cutting them directly from the DNA.</p>
<p>So instead of synthesizing, which basically has the limit of 450,000 that you can synthesize</p>
<p>at a time, we basically said, Hey, if we want to test all accessible regions of the genome,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just do an experiment that cuts accessible regions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take those accessible regions, put them all with the same end joints of the puzzles,</p>
<p>and then now use those to create a much, much larger array of things that you can test.</p>
<p>And then tiling all of these regions, you can then pinpoint what are the driver nucleotides,</p>
<p>what are the elements, how are they acting across 7 million experiments at a time.</p>
<p>So basically this is all the same family of technology where you&rsquo;re basically using these</p>
<p>parallel readouts of the barcodes.</p>
<p>And then to do this, we used a technology called StarSeq for self transcribing reporter</p>
<p>assays, a technology developed by Alex Stark, my former postdoc, who&rsquo;s now API over in Vienna.</p>
<p>So we basically coupled the StarSeq, the self transcribing reporters where the enhancer</p>
<p>can be part of the gene itself.</p>
<p>So instead of having a separate barcode, that enhancer basically acts to turn on the gene</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s transcribed as part of the gene.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to have the two separate parts.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So you can just read them directly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a constant improvements in this whole process.</p>
<p>By the way, generating all these options, is it basically brute force?</p>
<p>How much human intuition is?</p>
<p>Oh gosh, of course it&rsquo;s human intuition and human creativity and incorporating all of</p>
<p>the input data sets.</p>
<p>Because again, the genome is enormous.</p>
<p>3.2 billion, you don&rsquo;t want to test that.</p>
<p>You basically use all of these tools that I&rsquo;ve talked about already.</p>
<p>You generate your top favorite 10,000 hypothesis, and then you go and test all 10,000.</p>
<p>And then from what comes out, you can then go to the next step.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s technology number two.</p>
<p>So technology number one is robotics, automation, where you have thousands of wells and you</p>
<p>constantly test them.</p>
<p>The second technology is instead of having wells, you have these massively parallel readouts</p>
<p>in sort of these pooled assays.</p>
<p>The third technology is coupling CRISPR perturbations with these single cell RNA readouts.</p>
<p>So let me make another parenthesis here to describe now single cell RNA sequencing.</p>
<p>So what does single cell RNA sequencing mean?</p>
<p>So RNA sequencing is what has been traditionally used, well, traditionally the last 20 years,</p>
<p>ever since the advent of next generation sequencing.</p>
<p>So basically before RNA expression profiling was based on these microarrays.</p>
<p>The next technology after that was based on sequencing.</p>
<p>So you chop up your RNA and you just sequence small molecules, just like you would sequence</p>
<p>a genome, basically reverse transcribe the small RNAs into DNA, and you sequence that</p>
<p>DNA in order to get the number of sequencing reads corresponding to the expression level</p>
<p>of every gene in the genome.</p>
<p>You now have RNA sequencing.</p>
<p>How do you go to single cell RNA sequencing?</p>
<p>That technology also went through stages of evolution.</p>
<p>The first was microfluidics.</p>
<p>You basically had these, or even chambers, you basically had these ways of isolating</p>
<p>individual cells, putting them into a well for every one of these cells.</p>
<p>So you have 384 well plates and you now do 384 parallel reactions to measure the expression</p>
<p>of 384 cells.</p>
<p>That sounds amazing and it was amazing, but we want to do a million cells.</p>
<p>How do you go from these wells to a million cells?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what the next technology was after that is instead of using a well for every reaction,</p>
<p>you now use a lipid droplet for every reaction.</p>
<p>So you use micro droplets as reaction chambers to basically amplify RNA.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>You basically have microfluidics where you basically have every single cell coming down</p>
<p>one tube in your microfluidics and you have little bubbles getting created in the other</p>
<p>way with specific primers that mark every cell with its own barcode.</p>
<p>You basically couple the two and you end up with little bubbles that have a cell and tons</p>
<p>of markers for that cell.</p>
<p>You now mark up all of the RNA for that one cell with the same exact barcode and you then</p>
<p>lyse all of the droplets and you sequence the heck out of that and you have for every</p>
<p>RNA molecule, a unique identifier that tells you what cell was it on.</p>
<p>That is such good engineering, microfluidics and using some kind of primer to put a label</p>
<p>on the thing.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re making it sound easy.</p>
<p>I assume it&rsquo;s beautiful, but it&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the next generation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the second generation.</p>
<p>Next generation is forget the microfluidics altogether.</p>
<p>Just use big bottles.</p>
<p>How can you possibly do that with big bottles?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>You dissociate all of your cells or all of your nuclei from complex cells like brain</p>
<p>cells that are very long and sticky so you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>If you have blood cells or if you have neuronal nuclei or brain nuclei, you can basically</p>
<p>dissociate let&rsquo;s say a million cells.</p>
<p>You now want to add a unique barcode, a unique barcode in each one of a million cells using</p>
<p>only big bottles.</p>
<p>How can you possibly do that?</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, but here&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>You use a hundred of these bottles, you randomly shuffle all your million cells and you throw</p>
<p>them into those hundred bottles randomly, completely randomly.</p>
<p>You add one barcode out of a hundred to every one of the cells.</p>
<p>You then you now take them all out.</p>
<p>You shuffle them again and you throw them again into the same hundred bottles.</p>
<p>But now in a different randomization and you add a second barcode.</p>
<p>So every cell now has two barcodes.</p>
<p>You take them out again, you shuffle them and you throw them back in.</p>
<p>Another third barcode is adding randomly from the same hundred barcodes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now labeled every cell probabilistically based on the unique path that he took of which</p>
<p>of a hundred bottles did he go for the first time, which of a hundred bottles the second</p>
<p>time and which of a hundred bottles the third time.</p>
<p>A hundred times a hundred times a hundred is a million unique barcodes in every single</p>
<p>one of these cells without ever using microfluidics.</p>
<p>Very clever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful, right?</p>
<p>From a computer science perspective, that&rsquo;s very clever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you now have the single cell sequence technology.</p>
<p>You can use the wells, you can use the bubbles or you can use the bottles and you have way</p>
<p>The bubbles still sound pretty damn cool.</p>
<p>The bubbles are awesome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically the main technology that we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>So the bubbles is the main technology.</p>
<p>So there are kits now that companies just sell to basically carry out single cell RNA</p>
<p>sequencing that you can basically for $2,000, you can basically get 10,000 cells from one</p>
<p>sample.</p>
<p>And for every one of those cells, you basically have the transcription of thousands of genes.</p>
<p>And you know, of course the data for any one cell is noisy, but being computer scientists,</p>
<p>we can aggregate the data from all of the cells together across thousands of individuals</p>
<p>together to basically make very robust inferences.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the third technology is basically single cell RNA sequencing that allows you to now</p>
<p>start asking not just what is the brain expression level difference of that genetic variant,</p>
<p>but what is the expression difference of that one genetic variant across every single subtype</p>
<p>of brain cell?</p>
<p>How is the variance changing?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just, you know, with a brain sample, you can just ask about the mean, what is the</p>
<p>average expression?</p>
<p>If I instead have 3000 cells that are neurons, I can ask not just what is the neuronal expression.</p>
<p>I can say for layer five excitatory neurons of which I have, I don&rsquo;t know, 300 cells,</p>
<p>what is the variance that this genetic variant has?</p>
<p>So suddenly it&rsquo;s amazingly more powerful.</p>
<p>I can basically start asking about this middle layer of gene expression at unprecedented</p>
<p>levels.</p>
<p>So when you look at the average, it washes out some potentially important signal that</p>
<p>corresponds to ultimately the disease.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that, I can do that at the RNA level, but I can also do that at the DNA level for the</p>
<p>epigenome.</p>
<p>So remember how before I was telling you about all this technology that we&rsquo;re using to probe</p>
<p>the epigenome, one of them is DNA accessibility.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re doing in my lab is that from the same dissociation of say a brain sample</p>
<p>where you now have all these tens of thousands of cells floating around, you basically take</p>
<p>half of them to do RNA profiling and the other half to do epigenome profiling, both at the</p>
<p>single cell level.</p>
<p>So that allows you to now figure out what are the millions of DNA enhancers that are</p>
<p>accessible in every one of tens of thousands of cells.</p>
<p>And computationally, we can now take the RNA and the DNA readouts and group them together</p>
<p>to basically figure out how is every enhancer related to every gene.</p>
<p>And remember these sort of enhancer gene linking that we were doing across 833 samples?</p>
<p>833 is awesome, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but 10 million is way more awesome.</p>
<p>So we can now look at correlated activity across 2.3 million enhancers and 20,000 genes</p>
<p>in each of millions of cells to basically start piecing together the regulatory circuitry</p>
<p>of every single type of neuron, every single type of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglial</p>
<p>cell inside the brains of 1,500 individuals that we sample across multiple different brain</p>
<p>regions across both DNA and RNA.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the data set that my team generated last year alone.</p>
<p>So in one year, we basically generated 10 million cells from human brain across a dozen</p>
<p>different disorders, across schizophrenia, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy</p>
<p>body dementia, ALS, Huntington&rsquo;s disease, post traumatic stress disorder, autism, bipolar</p>
<p>disorder, healthy aging, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that even just within that data set lie a lot of keys to understanding</p>
<p>these diseases and then be able to like directly leads to then treatment.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So basically we are now motivating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So our computational team is in heaven right now and we&rsquo;re looking for people.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have super smart.</p>
<p>So this is a very interesting kind of side question.</p>
<p>How much of this is biology?</p>
<p>How much of this is computation?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the head of the computational biology group, but how much of, should you be comfortable</p>
<p>with biology to be able to solve some of these problems?</p>
<p>If you just find, if you put several of the hats you were on fundamentally, are you thinking</p>
<p>like a computer scientist here?</p>
<p>You have to.</p>
<p>This is the only way.</p>
<p>As I said, we are the descendants of the first digital computer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to understand the digital computer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to understand the circuitry, the logic of this digital core computer and</p>
<p>all of these analog layers surrounding it.</p>
<p>So the case that I&rsquo;ve been making is that you cannot think one gene at a time.</p>
<p>The traditional biology is dead.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way you cannot solve disease with traditional biology.</p>
<p>You need it as a component.</p>
<p>Once you figured out RX3 and RX5, you now can then say, Hey, have you guys worked on</p>
<p>those genes with your single gene approach?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love to know everything you know.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t, we now know how important these genes are.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now launch a single gene program to dissect them and understand them.</p>
<p>But you cannot use that as a way to dissect disease.</p>
<p>You have to think genomically.</p>
<p>You have to think from the global perspective and you have to build these circuits systematically.</p>
<p>So we need numbers of computer scientists who are interested and willing to dive into</p>
<p>these data fully, fully in and extract meaning.</p>
<p>We need computer science people who can understand machine learning and inference and decouple</p>
<p>these matrices, come up with super smart ways of dissecting them.</p>
<p>But we also need computer scientists who understand biology, who are able to design the next generation</p>
<p>of experiments.</p>
<p>Because many of these experiments, no one in their right mind would design them without</p>
<p>thinking of the analytical approach that you would use to deconvolve the data afterwards.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s massive amounts of ridiculously noisy data.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have the computational pipeline in your head before you even design the experiment,</p>
<p>you would never design the experiment that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So in designing the experiment, you have to see the entirety of the computational pipeline.</p>
<p>That drives the design.</p>
<p>That even drives the necessity for that design.</p>
<p>Basically, you know, if you didn&rsquo;t have a computer scientist way of thinking, you would</p>
<p>never design these hugely combinatorial, massively parallel experiments.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you need interdisciplinary teams, you need teams.</p>
<p>And I want to sort of clarify that what do we mean by computational biology group?</p>
<p>The focus is not on computational, the focus is on the biology.</p>
<p>So we are a biology group.</p>
<p>What type of biology?</p>
<p>Computational biology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the type of biology that uses the whole genome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the type of biology that designs experiments, genomic experiments, that can only be interpreted</p>
<p>in the context of the whole genome.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s philosophically looking at biology as a computer.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So which is in the context of the history of biology is a big transformation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can think of the name as what do we do?</p>
<p>Only computation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>How do we study it?</p>
<p>Only computationally.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>So all of these single cell sequencing can now be coupled with the technology that we</p>
<p>talked about earlier for perturbation.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the crazy thing.</p>
<p>Instead of using these wells and these robotic systems for doing one drug at a time or for</p>
<p>perturbing one gene at a time in thousands of wells, you can now do this using a pool</p>
<p>of cells and single cell RNA sequencing.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>You basically can take these perturbations using CRISPR and instead of using a single</p>
<p>guide RNA, you can use a library of guide RNAs generated exactly the same way using</p>
<p>this array technology.</p>
<p>So you synthesize a thousand different guide RNAs.</p>
<p>You now take each of these guide RNAs and you insert them in a pool of cells where every</p>
<p>cell gets one perturbation.</p>
<p>And you use CRISPR editing or CRISPR, so with either CRISPR Cas9 to edit a genome with these</p>
<p>thousand perturbations or with the activation or with the repression.</p>
<p>And you now can have a single cell readout where every single cell has received one of</p>
<p>these modifications.</p>
<p>And you can now in massively parallel ways, couple the perturbation and the readout in</p>
<p>a single experiment.</p>
<p>How are you tracking which perturbations each cell received?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s ways of doing that, but basically one way is to make that perturbation an expressible</p>
<p>vector so that part of your RNA reading is actually that perturbation itself.</p>
<p>So you can basically put it in an expressible part so you can self drive it.</p>
<p>So the point that I want to get across is that the sky&rsquo;s the limit.</p>
<p>You basically have these tools, these building blocks of molecular biology.</p>
<p>We have these massive data sets of computational biology.</p>
<p>We have this huge ability to sort of use machine learning and statistical methods and, you</p>
<p>know, linear algebra to sort of reduce the dimensionality of all these massive data sets.</p>
<p>And then you end up with a series of actionable targets that you can then couple with pharma</p>
<p>and just go after systematically.</p>
<p>So the ability to sort of bring genetics to the epigenomics, to the transcriptomics, to</p>
<p>the cellular readouts using these sort of high throughput perturbation technologies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about and ultimately to the organismal through the electronic health record</p>
<p>endophenotypes and ultimately the disease battery of assays at the cognitive level,</p>
<p>at the physiological level and, you know, every other level.</p>
<p>There is no better or more exciting field, in my view, to be a computer scientist then</p>
<p>or to be a scientist in period.</p>
<p>Basically this confluence of technologies, of computation, of data, of insight and of</p>
<p>tools for manipulation is unprecedented in human history.</p>
<p>And I think this is what&rsquo;s shaping the next century to really be a transformative century</p>
<p>for our species and for our planet.</p>
<p>Do you think the 21st century will be remembered for the big leaps in understanding and alleviation</p>
<p>of biology?</p>
<p>If you look at the path between discovery and therapeutics, it&rsquo;s been on the order of</p>
<p>50 years, it&rsquo;s been shortened to 40, 30, 20, and now it&rsquo;s on the order of 10 years.</p>
<p>But the huge number of technologies that are going on right now for discovery will result</p>
<p>undoubtedly in the most dramatic manipulation of human biology that we&rsquo;ve ever seen in the</p>
<p>history of humanity in the next few years.</p>
<p>Do you think we might be able to cure some of the diseases we started this conversation</p>
<p>with?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Basically the complexity is enormous and I don&rsquo;t want to underestimate the complexity</p>
<p>but the number of insights is unprecedented and the ability to manipulate is unprecedented</p>
<p>and the ability to deliver these small molecules and other non traditional medicine perturbations,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new generation of perturbations that you can use at the DNA level, at the</p>
<p>RNA level, at the micro RNA level, at the epigenomic level, there&rsquo;s a battery of new</p>
<p>generations of perturbations.</p>
<p>If you couple that with cell type identifiers that can basically sense when you are in the</p>
<p>right cell based on the specific combination and then turn on that intervention for that</p>
<p>cell, you can now think of combinatorial interventions where you can basically sort of feed a synthetic</p>
<p>biology construct to someone that will basically do different things in different cells.</p>
<p>So basically for cancer, this is one of the therapeutics that our collaborator Ron Weiss</p>
<p>is using to basically start sort of engineering the circuits that will use micro RNA sensors</p>
<p>of the environment to sort of know if you&rsquo;re in a tumor cell or if you&rsquo;re in an immune</p>
<p>cell or if you&rsquo;re in a stromal cell and so forth and basically turn on particular interventions</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>You can sort of create constructs that are tuned to only the liver cells or only the</p>
<p>heart cells or only the brain cells and then have these new generations of therapeutics</p>
<p>coupled with this immense amount of knowledge on the sort of which targets to choose and</p>
<p>what biological processes to measure and how to intervene.</p>
<p>My view is that disease is going to be fundamentally altered and alleviated as we go forward.</p>
<p>Next time we talk, we&rsquo;ll talk about the philosophical implications of that and the effect of life,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s stick to biology for just a little longer.</p>
<p>We did pretty good today.</p>
<p>We stuck to the science.</p>
<p>What are you excited in terms of the future of this field, the technologies in your own</p>
<p>group, in your own mind, you&rsquo;re leading the world at MIT in the science and the engineering</p>
<p>of this work.</p>
<p>So what are you excited about here?</p>
<p>I could not be more excited.</p>
<p>We are one of many, many teams who are working on this.</p>
<p>In my team, the most exciting parts are, you know, many folds.</p>
<p>So basically we&rsquo;ve now assembled these battery of technologies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve assembled these massive, massive data sets and now we&rsquo;re really sort of in the stage</p>
<p>of our team&rsquo;s path of generating disease insights.</p>
<p>So we are simultaneously working on a paper on schizophrenia right now that is basically</p>
<p>using the single cell profiling technologies, using this editing and manipulation technologies</p>
<p>to basically show how the master regulators underlying changes in the brain that are sort</p>
<p>of found in schizophrenia are in fact affecting excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons</p>
<p>in pathways that are active both in synaptic pruning, but also in early development.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve basically found this set of four regulators that are connecting these two processes that</p>
<p>were previously separate in schizophrenia in sort of having a sort of more unified view</p>
<p>across those two sides.</p>
<p>The second one is in the area of metabolism.</p>
<p>We basically now have a beautiful collaboration with the Goodyear lab that&rsquo;s basically looking</p>
<p>at multi tissue perturbations in six or seven different tissues across the body in the context</p>
<p>of exercise and in the context of nutritional interventions using both mouse and human,</p>
<p>where we can basically see what are the cell to cell communications that are changing across</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re finding is this immense role of both immune cells as well as adipocyte</p>
<p>stem cells in sort of reshaping that circuitry of all of these different tissues and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of painting to a new path for therapeutical intervention there.</p>
<p>In Alzheimer&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s this huge focus on microglia and now we&rsquo;re discovering different classes</p>
<p>of microglial cells that are basically either synaptic or immune.</p>
<p>And these are playing vastly different roles in Alzheimer&rsquo;s versus in schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re finding is this immense complexity as you go further and further down of how</p>
<p>in fact there&rsquo;s 10 different types of microglia, each with their own sort of expression programs.</p>
<p>We used to think of them as, oh yeah, they&rsquo;re microglia, but in fact now we&rsquo;re realizing</p>
<p>just even in that sort of least abundant of cell types, there&rsquo;s this incredible diversity</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>The differences between brain regions is another sort of major, major insight.</p>
<p>Often one would think that, oh, astrocytes are astrocytes no matter where they are.</p>
<p>But no, there&rsquo;s incredible region specific differences in the expression patterns of</p>
<p>all of the major brain cell types across different brain regions.</p>
<p>So basically there&rsquo;s the neocortical regions that are sort of the recent innovation that</p>
<p>makes us so different from all other species.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the sort of reptilian brain sort of regions that are sort of much more very extremely</p>
<p>distinct.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Each of those basically is associated in a different way with disease.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re doing now is looking into pseudo temporal models for how disease progresses</p>
<p>across different regions of the brain.</p>
<p>If you look at Alzheimer&rsquo;s, it basically starts in this small region called the entorhinal</p>
<p>cortex and then it spreads through the brain and through the hippocampus and ultimately</p>
<p>affecting the neocortex.</p>
<p>And with every brain region that it hits, it basically has a different impact on the</p>
<p>cognitive and memory aspects, orientation, short term memory, long term memory, et cetera,</p>
<p>which is dramatically affecting the cognitive path that the individuals go through.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re doing now is creating these computational models for ordering the cells</p>
<p>and the regions and the individuals according to their ability to predict Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>So we can have a cell level predictor of pathology that allows us to now create a temporal time</p>
<p>course that tells us when every gene turns on along this pathology progression and then</p>
<p>trace that across regions and pathological measures that are region specific, but also</p>
<p>cognitive measures and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So that allows us to now sort of for the first time, look at can we actually do early intervention</p>
<p>for Alzheimer&rsquo;s where we know that the disease starts manifesting for 10 years before you</p>
<p>actually have your first cognitive loss.</p>
<p>Can we start seeing that path to build new diagnostics, new prognostics, new biomarkers</p>
<p>for this sort of early intervention in Alzheimer&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>The other aspect that we&rsquo;re looking at is mosaicism.</p>
<p>We talked about the common variants and the rare variants, but in addition to those rare</p>
<p>variants as your initial cell that forms the zygote divides and divides and divides, with</p>
<p>every cell division there are additional mutations that are happening.</p>
<p>So what you end up with is your brain being a mosaic of multiple different types of genetic</p>
<p>underpinnings.</p>
<p>Some cells contain a mutation that other cells don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So every human has the common variants that all of us carry to some degree, the rare variants</p>
<p>that your immediate tree of the human species carries, and then there&rsquo;s the somatic variant,</p>
<p>which is the tree that happened after the zygote that sort of forms your own body.</p>
<p>So these somatic alterations is something that has been previously inaccessible to study</p>
<p>in human postmortem samples.</p>
<p>But right now with the advent of single cell RNA sequencing, in this particular case, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using the well based sequencing, which is much more expensive, but gives you a lot richer</p>
<p>information about each of those transcripts.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re using now that richer information to infer mutations that have happened in each</p>
<p>of the thousands of genes that sort of are active in these cells, and then understand</p>
<p>how the genome relates to the function, this genotype phenotype relationship that we usually</p>
<p>build in GWAS between in genome wide association studies between genetic variation and disease.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now building that at the cell level, where for every cell, we can relate the unique</p>
<p>specific genome of that cell with the expression patterns of that cell, and the predicted function</p>
<p>using these predictive models that I mentioned before on this regulation for cognition for</p>
<p>pathology in Alzheimer&rsquo;s at the cell level.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re finding is that the genes that are altered and the genetic regions that are</p>
<p>altered in common variants versus rare variants versus somatic variants are actually very</p>
<p>different from each other.</p>
<p>The somatic variants are pointing to neuronal energetics and oligodendrocyte functions that</p>
<p>are not visible in the genetic legions that you find for the common variants, probably</p>
<p>because they have too strong of an effect that evolution is just not tolerating them</p>
<p>on the common side of the allele frequency spectrum.</p>
<p>So the somatic one, that&rsquo;s the variation that happens after the zygote, after you individual.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a dumb question, but there&rsquo;s mutation and variation, I guess that happens</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that they&rsquo;re through this, if we focus in on individual cells, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to detect the story that&rsquo;s interesting there, and that might be a very unique kind</p>
<p>of important variability that arises for, you said neuronal or something that would</p>
<p>sound&hellip;</p>
<p>Energetics.</p>
<p>Energetics, sounds like a cool term.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the metabolism of humans is dramatically altered from that of nearby species.</p>
<p>We talked about that last time that basically we are able to consume meat that is incredibly</p>
<p>energy rich, and that allows us to sort of have functions that are meeting this humongous</p>
<p>brain that we have.</p>
<p>So basically on one hand, every one of our brain cells is much more energy efficient</p>
<p>than our neighbors, than our relatives.</p>
<p>Number two, we have way more of these cells.</p>
<p>And number three, we have this new diet that allows us to now feed all these needs.</p>
<p>That basically creates a massive amount of damage, oxidative damage from this huge super</p>
<p>powered factory of ideas and thoughts that we carry in our skull.</p>
<p>And that factory has energetic needs, and there&rsquo;s a lot of sort of biological processes</p>
<p>underlying that, that we are finding are altered in the context of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So you have to consider all of these systems if you want to understand even something like</p>
<p>diseases that you would maybe traditionally associate with just the particular cells of</p>
<p>the brain.</p>
<p>The immune system, the metabolic system, the metabolic system.</p>
<p>And these are all the things that makes us uniquely human.</p>
<p>So our immune system is dramatically different from that of our neighbors.</p>
<p>Our societies are so much more clustered.</p>
<p>The history of infection that have plagued the human population is dramatically different</p>
<p>from every other species.</p>
<p>The way that our society and our population has sort of exploded has basically put unique</p>
<p>pressures on our immune system.</p>
<p>And our immune system has both coped with that density and also been shaped by, as I</p>
<p>mentioned, the vast amount of death that has happened in the Black Plague and other sort</p>
<p>of selective events in human history, famines, ice ages, and so forth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s number one on the sort of immune side.</p>
<p>On the metabolic side, again, we are able to sort of run marathons.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember the sort of human versus horse experiment where the horse actually</p>
<p>tires out faster than the human and the human actually wins.</p>
<p>So on the metabolic side, we&rsquo;re dramatically different.</p>
<p>On the immune side, we&rsquo;re dramatically different.</p>
<p>On the brain side, again, you know, no need to sort of, you know, it&rsquo;s a no brainer of</p>
<p>how our brain is like just enormously more capable.</p>
<p>And then, you know, in the side of cancer, so basically the cancers that humans are having,</p>
<p>the exposures, the environmental exposures is again, dramatically different.</p>
<p>And the lifespan, the expansion of human lifespan is unseen in any other species in, you know,</p>
<p>recent evolutionary history.</p>
<p>And that now leads to a lot of new disorders that are starting to, you know, manifest late</p>
<p>in life.</p>
<p>So you know, Alzheimer&rsquo;s is one example where basically, you know, these vast energetic</p>
<p>needs over a lifetime of thinking can basically lead to all of these debris and eventually</p>
<p>saturate the system and lead to, you know, Alzheimer&rsquo;s in the late life.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s just such a dramatic set of frontiers when it comes to</p>
<p>aging research that, you know, so what I often like to say is that if you want to engineer</p>
<p>a car to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles an hour, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You can basically, you know, fix a few components.</p>
<p>If you wanted to now go at 400 miles an hour, you have to completely redesign the entire</p>
<p>car because the system has just not evolved to go that far.</p>
<p>Basically our human body has only evolved to live to, I don&rsquo;t know, 120, maybe we can</p>
<p>get to 150 with minor changes.</p>
<p>But if, you know, as we start pushing these frontiers for not just living, but well living,</p>
<p>the Fzine that we talked about last time.</p>
<p>So to basically push Fzine into the 80s and 90s and a hundreds and, you know, much further</p>
<p>than that, we will face new challenges that have, you know, never been faced before in</p>
<p>terms of cancer, the number of divisions, in terms of Alzheimer&rsquo;s and brain related</p>
<p>disorders, in terms of metabolic disorders, in terms of regeneration, there&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>many different frontiers ahead of us.</p>
<p>So I am thrilled about where we&rsquo;re heading.</p>
<p>So basically I see this confluence in my lab and many other labs of AI, of, you know, sort</p>
<p>of, you know, the next frontier of AI for drug design.</p>
<p>So basically these sort of graph neural networks on specific chemical designs that allow you</p>
<p>to create new generations of therapeutics.</p>
<p>These molecular biology tricks for intervening at the system at every level, these personalized</p>
<p>medicine prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis using the electronic health records and using</p>
<p>these polygenic risk scores weighted by the burden, the number of mutations that are accumulating</p>
<p>across common rare and somatic variants, the burden converging across all of these different</p>
<p>molecular pathways, the delivery of specific drugs and specific interventions into specific</p>
<p>cell types.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;ve talked with Bob Langer about this, there&rsquo;s, you know, many giants in that</p>
<p>field.</p>
<p>And then the last concept is not intervening at the single gene level.</p>
<p>I want you to sort of conceptualize the concept of an on target side effect.</p>
<p>What is an on target side effect?</p>
<p>An off target side effect is when you design a molecule to target one gene and instead</p>
<p>it targets another gene and you have side effects because of that.</p>
<p>And on target side effect is when your molecule does exactly what you were expecting, but</p>
<p>that gene is plyotropic.</p>
<p>Plyo means many, tropos means ways, many ways, it acts in many ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a multifunctional gene.</p>
<p>So you find that this gene plays a role in this, but as we talked about the wiring of</p>
<p>genes to phenotypes is extremely dense and extremely complex.</p>
<p>So the next stage of intervention will be intervening not at the gene level, but at</p>
<p>the network level.</p>
<p>Intervening at the set of pathways and the set of genes with multi input perturbations</p>
<p>to the system, multi input modulations, pharmaceutical or other interventional, and that basically</p>
<p>allow you to now work at the sort of full level of understanding, not just in your brain,</p>
<p>but across your body, not just in one gene, but across the set of pathways and so on and</p>
<p>so forth for every one of these disorders.</p>
<p>So I think that we&rsquo;re finally at the level of systems medicine of basically instead of</p>
<p>sort of medicine being at the single gene level, medicine being at the systems level</p>
<p>where it can be personalized based on the specific set of genetic markers and genetic</p>
<p>perturbations that you are either born with or that you have developed during your lifetime.</p>
<p>Your unique set of exposures, your unique set of biomarkers, and your unique set of</p>
<p>current set of conditions through your EHR and other ways.</p>
<p>And the precision component of intervening extremely precisely in the specific pathways</p>
<p>and the specific combinations of genes that should be modulated to sort of bring you from</p>
<p>the disease state to the physiologically normal state or even to physiologically improved</p>
<p>state through this combination of interventions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in my view, the field where basically computer science comes together with artificial</p>
<p>intelligence statistics, all of these other tools, molecular biology technologies and</p>
<p>biotechnology and pharmaceutical technologies that are sort of revolutionary in the way</p>
<p>of intervention.</p>
<p>And of course, this massive amount of molecular biology and data gathering and generation</p>
<p>and perturbation in massively parallel ways.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no better way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no better time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no better place to be sort of looking at this whole confluence of ideas.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just so thrilled to be a small part of this amazing, enormous ecosystem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to imagine what humans of 100, 200 years from now, what their life experience</p>
<p>is like, because these ideas seem to have potential to transform the quality of life</p>
<p>that, when they look back at us, they probably wonder how we were put up with all the suffering</p>
<p>in the world.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Haruki Murakami.</p>
<p>Human beings are ultimately nothing but carriers, passageways for genes.</p>
<p>They ride us into the ground like racehorses from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Genes don&rsquo;t think about what constitutes good or evil.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care whether we&rsquo;re happy or unhappy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just means to an end for them.</p>
<p>The only thing they think about is what is most efficient for them.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
