    <p>The following is a conversation with Michael Mallis and Yaron Brook, Michael&rsquo;s third time</p>
<p>on this podcast and Yaron&rsquo;s second, but together for the first time.</p>
<p>Michael is an anarchist, political thinker, host of a podcast called You&rsquo;re Welcome and</p>
<p>author of Dear Reader, The New Right and two upcoming books Anarchist Handbook and The</p>
<p>White Pill.</p>
<p>Yaron is an objectivist philosopher, chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute, host of The Yaron</p>
<p>Brook Show and coauthor of The Free Market Revolution and Equal is Unfair.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Ground News, Public Goods, Athletic Greens, Brave and Four</p>
<p>Sigmatic.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that this conversation is a kind of experiment.</p>
<p>Both Michael and Yaron are thoughtful and passionate, united in part by an interest</p>
<p>in the history and philosophy of Ayn Rand, but they are also very different in style.</p>
<p>Good conversation, like good food, is often made delicious by pairing of contrasting elements.</p>
<p>For example, someone suggested I try a peanut butter, bacon and banana sandwich, which apparently</p>
<p>is very good.</p>
<p>Among the three of us, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s the peanut butter, who&rsquo;s the bacon and who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the banana, I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s probably me, I&rsquo;m the banana, but I hope the final result,</p>
<p>the final dish, if you will, is equally delicious.</p>
<p>We talk through, I think, a lot of interesting ideas, sometimes disagreeing, sometimes even</p>
<p>in rare cases saying something humorous, including dark humor, especially in Michael&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>All three of us are sensitive to the suffering in the world today and throughout human history.</p>
<p>We think about it, we talk about it, and we deal with it in different ways.</p>
<p>Be patient with us.</p>
<p>Whether you agree, disagree, enjoy or dislike the result, I hope you feel listened, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a wiser person on the other end of it, I know I was.</p>
<p>Mostly, I really enjoyed this conversation because no matter what Michael and Yaron believe,</p>
<p>underneath it all, they&rsquo;re genuine, kind human beings that I&rsquo;m lucky to be able to</p>
<p>hang out with and learn from.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Michael Malus and Yaron</p>
<p>Rook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan of the two of you for the longest time.</p>
<p>Are we recording now?</p>
<p>Is it starting?</p>
<p>Or are you just talking?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recording at all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to compliment us if it&rsquo;s not part of the show.</p>
<p>Yes, he does, all the time.</p>
<p>He speaks very highly of me.</p>
<p>You, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>He only does this to me on the show.</p>
<p>Objectivists don&rsquo;t like charity, so don&rsquo;t compliment him, he won&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sincere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an incredible honor that the both of you would show up here.</p>
<p>If we, let me just ask this sort of profound philosophical question.</p>
<p>How well do you think we would get along if we were stuck on a desert island together?</p>
<p>What would life be like?</p>
<p>I thought the original question you had, that you sent us this question, was how long would</p>
<p>it take for us to murder one another or something like that.</p>
<p>There was murder in the question, if I remember.</p>
<p>I, I, listen, he sent us homework, right?</p>
<p>All these questions.</p>
<p>I ignored it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t spend four years at Patrick Henry University to do homework.</p>
<p>To answer your question, I think it would be very easy for us to live together in a</p>
<p>desert island in terms of interpersonal.</p>
<p>I know, and I say this because I know a lot of people who have been the show&rsquo;s survivor.</p>
<p>So they, and I know a little bit about the dynamics.</p>
<p>So when you have people who are intelligent, who are going to have the same goals, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s space to go away if I&rsquo;m annoyed at you, I don&rsquo;t think it would be that hard at</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s our goals on a desert island?</p>
<p>Food, shelter.</p>
<p>Survival.</p>
<p>Survival, basically.</p>
<p>Survival and getting out of there, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to stay on the desert island.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think, I think that&rsquo;s true of any three, you know, semi rational</p>
<p>people who, you know, who basically share the goal that they want to survive.</p>
<p>They want to thrive.</p>
<p>They want to get off of the island.</p>
<p>Why would there be conflict?</p>
<p>I mean, there would be conflict, but, and there can be conflict, but they&rsquo;d find ways</p>
<p>to deal with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have this negative view of human beings, particularly not as individuals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when they get into mobs and groups and collectives that ideology can really motivate</p>
<p>them to do horrible things.</p>
<p>One of the things that really drives me crazy is how sinister an impact the book Lord of</p>
<p>the Flies has had on our culture.</p>
<p>I read it in high school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a superb book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even a question, but it&rsquo;s not accurate.</p>
<p>We see in many situations where people are trapped together under difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Obviously that book&rsquo;s about children that very quickly it is not about conflict.</p>
<p>It very quickly becomes about cooperation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work together.</p>
<p>We all have the same goal.</p>
<p>This is not a time to worry about other things.</p>
<p>It really, the human beings, the animal instinct that kicks in is the social animal and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to shut up and go over there and have a, like stomp my feet instead of arguing with</p>
<p>your own because we&rsquo;re really trapped in the situation and we need to make it work.</p>
<p>Well, and to the extent that they&rsquo;re bad people, bad people are dealt with, right?</p>
<p>So this is true of all of, you know, how did we survive as a species, right?</p>
<p>How have we survived as a species?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been on a desert island in a sense as a species forever.</p>
<p>Tribes survived.</p>
<p>They survived by cooperation.</p>
<p>They survived by dealing with bad people.</p>
<p>Civilization is created by people cooperating and working together and allowing individuals</p>
<p>to thrive within the group and when bad people arise, they deal with them, right?</p>
<p>Now sometimes these groups get captured by bad people and bad ideas and probably from</p>
<p>day one that was going on, right?</p>
<p>The whole tribe is probably a bad idea to begin with, but you know, underneath it all,</p>
<p>the fact is that to survive as a species, we need to think, we need to be rational and</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t have any respect for reason, then we would all die.</p>
<p>We would die off.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a hopeful message, but where does that go wrong?</p>
<p>So with three people we might get along, we would focus on the basics of life, we have</p>
<p>similar goals.</p>
<p>Once women are introduced, their incessant irrationalism and less of their hormones for</p>
<p>SOL.</p>
<p>Look, three of us on a desert island would be nice, but without women, it wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to edit out half the things Michael said through this broadcast.</p>
<p>As you know, I used to run the Ayn Rand Institute.</p>
<p>She was a woman last time I looked.</p>
<p>Oh, wait a minute.</p>
<p>You know, you know exactly what I&rsquo;m going to say.</p>
<p>When Ludwig von Mises or Hazlitt, I don&rsquo;t know who it was, Mises was praising Ayn Rand</p>
<p>and I think it was Hazlitt who said it to her.</p>
<p>He said, Ludwig von Mises said, you&rsquo;re the smartest man I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>And Ayn Rand said, did he say man?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>No, she viewed as a compliment.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But she wanted to be clear that he said man.</p>
<p>She was excited.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I took it as her perceiving him as seeing her as a full equal.</p>
<p>Oh, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Plus, I think the perception out there, the perception in the culture of man as being</p>
<p>rational was a compliment to her because that was affirming that he viewed her as a rational.</p>
<p>Yeah, because Mises is old school.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an older Eastern European guy, so he would definitely have these rigid views.</p>
<p>Like his wife, I read her autobiography, Margit von Mises, and basically he made her his secretary</p>
<p>to the point where if he&rsquo;s typing something or he had something handwritten, she had to</p>
<p>type it out.</p>
<p>And if she made a typo, he would tear up the page, she had to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, this is the role of the man, this is the role of the woman.</p>
<p>So for him to regard her, this was kind of a breaking through moment.</p>
<p>Not that she was secretly misogynist.</p>
<p>So I think we go wrong when people try to understand the world around them and come</p>
<p>up with wrong ideas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s natural that they would come up with wrong ideas because it&rsquo;s hard to figure out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So we start with trying to come up with mystical explanations for the existence of the things</p>
<p>around us.</p>
<p>And that I think very quickly leads to some people being able to communicate with the</p>
<p>mystical stuff out there and some people not being able to communicate and some people</p>
<p>wanting to control other people and using those pseudo explanations as a way to control.</p>
<p>So you always have, Rand called it Attila and the witch doctor.</p>
<p>You always have a witch doctor, the mystic, the philosopher, the intellectual, the philosopher</p>
<p>king, and you have an Attila, you have somebody who wants control of the people, who&rsquo;s willing</p>
<p>to use force to control other people.</p>
<p>And when those two get together, that&rsquo;s when things go bad.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, 95, 98% of human history is when those two are together.</p>
<p>And so the not having them together, having the right ideas, and the right ideas are ones</p>
<p>that are not exclusive to those guys and where we don&rsquo;t allow Attila to have that kind of</p>
<p>physical power over us, that&rsquo;s an exception and that&rsquo;s rare and that&rsquo;s what needs to be</p>
<p>defended.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Stalin&rsquo;s not personally killing people.</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s not personally killing people.</p>
<p>Charles Manson&rsquo;s not personally killing people.</p>
<p>They need their goons.</p>
<p>They need their goons, but also they don&rsquo;t have original ideas.</p>
<p>Everything Stalin says is original to him, right?</p>
<p>He needs a Marx, even Lenin, right?</p>
<p>They all need a Marx, right?</p>
<p>And Marx needs a particular line of thinkers that come before him that set him up for these</p>
<p>kind of ideas.</p>
<p>So Stalin both needs his goons, even though he&rsquo;s somewhat of a goon, particularly Stalin.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a bank robber, yeah.</p>
<p>And then, so take Lenin, Lenin I think is a better example because Lenin&rsquo;s more intellectual</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>Lenin needs his goons, he needs his Stalins, but Lenin also needs his Marx.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t want to let Marx off the hook because Marx knows, I think, implicitly that</p>
<p>his ideas have to lead to Lenin and Stalin.</p>
<p>His ideas are not neutral.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s implicit at all.</p>
<p>I think Marx very much glorified revolution, blood and terror, this is not implicit in</p>
<p>the slightest.</p>
<p>No, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, there are letters between him and Engels where they talk about which peoples</p>
<p>will have to be eliminated because they don&rsquo;t have that proletarian thing, right?</p>
<p>So I think certain peoples in Southern Europe are not appropriate for the utopia to come</p>
<p>and will have to be gone.</p>
<p>And Marx also had this concept which we still see today in garbled ways of polylogism, which</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re a capitalist and I&rsquo;m bourgeois or I&rsquo;m a worker, your logic is different than</p>
<p>mine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really going to be impossible for us to communicate.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, you&rsquo;re going to have to be liquidated.</p>
<p>And they pretend that doesn&rsquo;t mean murdered, but it means murdered.</p>
<p>And very quickly, everyone becomes a capitalist or bourgeois.</p>
<p>And then you have the Holodomor and things like this.</p>
<p>No, he knows exactly where it&rsquo;s going to lead.</p>
<p>And this is why people say, oh, Marx is not evil.</p>
<p>He just wrote books.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the people who write books who are responsible for the way history evolves.</p>
<p>And they know the bad guys certainly know the consequence of their ideas, and they need</p>
<p>to bear the moral responsibility for what happens when the ideas are implemented.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a way.</p>
<p>Can I ask a question?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I think I know more about Rand than Yaron does.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The gauntlet has been thrown down.</p>
<p>Who did Ayn Rand say is the most evil man who ever lived?</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>No, that I know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a big deal that Immanuel Kant is.</p>
<p>And most people don&rsquo;t understand why, because if you read Kant, there&rsquo;s certain passages</p>
<p>in Kant that sound pretty liberal, they sound pretty, it sounds like he&rsquo;s for the individual,</p>
<p>he sounds like he&rsquo;s for the American Revolution, things like that.</p>
<p>But when you actually read his philosophy and what he&rsquo;s trying to defend and what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to undermine, he&rsquo;s trying to undermine the foundations that make the revolution possible,</p>
<p>that make freedom and individualism possible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to destroy the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>And the Enlightenment are those ideas that make freedom, individualism feasible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to undermine reason.</p>
<p>And without reason, we&rsquo;re nothing.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t survive as a species.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why she thought he was the most evil person, because his ideas undermine the</p>
<p>very foundations of what it requires to be a human being, reason and individualism.</p>
<p>Those are the things he&rsquo;s trying to eviscerate.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve talked about Hoffman before.</p>
<p>So Hoffman is a modern day attempt to, Donald Hoffman, Donald Hoffman is the University</p>
<p>of California, Irvine, a neurologist, a neuroscientist, something like that.</p>
<p>So I met him once and we were at one of these conferences where you do a quick intro, you</p>
<p>sit and you do a quick intro.</p>
<p>His introduction was, I&rsquo;ve just written a book that proves that evolution has conditioned</p>
<p>us not to see reality.</p>
<p>That is very Kantian.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he is basically just presenting pseudoscience to defend Kant&rsquo;s position about epistemology</p>
<p>and about metaphysics.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing original there.</p>
<p>And he puts up a bunch of equations and he says, I ran a simulation and it proves I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>So Yaron is a little bit frustrated with Donald Hoffman&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Let me&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not frustrated.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s completely wrong and it&rsquo;s anti life, anti mind, anti evolution.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s an anti evolutionist at the end.</p>
<p>And I think it, you know, anytime you say, look, here&rsquo;s the important point.</p>
<p>Anytime you say reality doesn&rsquo;t exist, well, who are you?</p>
<p>What do you mean by reality?</p>
<p>What do any of your words mean?</p>
<p>What does anything you say even mean if it doesn&rsquo;t refer to something that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>out there in reality?</p>
<p>I try to defend this point of view because in a certain kind of sense, I hear it as being</p>
<p>humble in the face of the uncertainty that&rsquo;s around us.</p>
<p>Sort of, you know, when you speak with the confidence of Ayn Rand and yourself, that</p>
<p>reason can be like this weapon that cuts through all the bullshit of the world and makes us</p>
<p>like have an ethical moral life and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>You kind of assume that reason is a superpower that has no limits.</p>
<p>Wait, hold on, hold on a second.</p>
<p>But I got this one.</p>
<p>See this is already leading to a murder by words and we&rsquo;ve been only talking for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The three of us wouldn&rsquo;t get together, we wouldn&rsquo;t get along together on an island.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just make him our slave.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all going to get along.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just going to do the work.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot provide any value as a slave, so this is not going to end well</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>We could provide value as dinner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem I&rsquo;m trying to get to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a solution.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But Donald Hoffman says that there is like he makes an argument that exactly as you said,</p>
<p>that what we perceive is not, is very, very far from actual physical reality.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re not able to perceive the physical reality at all.</p>
<p>And he also makes the bigger claim that evolution prefers beings who are not attached to reality.</p>
<p>So like evolution created creatures that are basically functioning way outside of what</p>
<p>the physical reality is.</p>
<p>I got this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here and I hate all of it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, no, no, I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>First of all, when you were making that comment about how, you know, reason is a superpower</p>
<p>beyond limit, you&rsquo;re being ironic, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you one example, which is astronomy.</p>
<p>If you look at the physical size of the universe, it&rsquo;s literally in one sense incomprehensible.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s right in the sense that I do not understand and none of us understand what it means for</p>
<p>93 million miles away for the sun to be.</p>
<p>It makes no, it&rsquo;s a number on another screen, right?</p>
<p>That said, the fact that my mind, and I&rsquo;m not one of the great thinkers of all time</p>
<p>is getting there, is capable of appreciating what the sun means, what heliocentrism means.</p>
<p>The fact that we can, you know, you&rsquo;re a math person that you could look at galaxies and</p>
<p>reduce it to 10 to the 64th power in terms of distance that shows the unlimited capacity</p>
<p>of the human mind and reason.</p>
<p>Number one.</p>
<p>Number two is if he says that evolution favors those who are not in touch with reality, and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know in what context he&rsquo;s saying that because that sentence could mean a lot of</p>
<p>different things.</p>
<p>Evolution is what guides, reality is what guides evolution.</p>
<p>Evolution works because you are fitted to the reality of the situation around you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that someone is sitting down and says, well, I&rsquo;m going to add a fin to this</p>
<p>animal and that fin helps it swim.</p>
<p>I engineered a check mark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that mutations occur.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these mutations are against reality.</p>
<p>They do not further this animal&rsquo;s life or this plant&rsquo;s life or this fungus&rsquo;s life, but</p>
<p>the ones that are in touch with reality, such as, okay, it&rsquo;s really cold here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no predators here.</p>
<p>If I could figure out, and I&rsquo;m using that term very loosely, a way where I could survive</p>
<p>in the cold, I don&rsquo;t have predation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>The fact that unconsciously and mindlessly this process can force the mutation and evolution</p>
<p>of the form precisely means that they&rsquo;re in touch with reality.</p>
<p>Now, if he means the consciousness is not in touch with reality, that&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>that I really hate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referring to the reality as like the biological reality of evolution, but all of</p>
<p>that is based on many other layers of abstraction that ultimately has quantum mechanics underneath</p>
<p>it all, and he&rsquo;s saying somewhere along the layers, you start to lose more and more and</p>
<p>more attachment to the actual.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Can I add one more sentence?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>I do not, I despise the idea, I say despise, I&rsquo;m not using this, I&rsquo;m not joking, the idea</p>
<p>that the reality we don&rsquo;t live in is somehow more real than this.</p>
<p>That is a very dangerous idea to say, well, quantum works in this way, and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>correct and none of us disagree with that.</p>
<p>What we perceive, macro, works in a different way, well, that&rsquo;s the real reality and this</p>
<p>is fake.</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is the real reality.</p>
<p>That is a different type, a subset, but no one&rsquo;s living there, and humanity is the starting</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a subset that has to integrate with this world.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t two worlds, one in the quantum world and one here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re integrated.</p>
<p>Now, we might not have the scientific knowledge to know how they&rsquo;re integrated, but so what?</p>
<p>We know that there&rsquo;s only one reality and that&rsquo;s this one.</p>
<p>He has this difference.</p>
<p>He says, evolution matches up to fitness, not to reality, and he creates this dichotomy</p>
<p>between fitness and reality, but that&rsquo;s complete nonsense.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a concept of fitness outside of fitness to what?</p>
<p>To reality.</p>
<p>Fitness and reality are the same thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not separate things.</p>
<p>The whole way he sets this up intellectually is wrong, I think to some extent dishonest,</p>
<p>and certainly philosophically corrupt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Kantian.</p>
<p>Again, he&rsquo;s accepted Kant&rsquo;s ideas, and everybody pretty much has accepted Kant&rsquo;s ideas for</p>
<p>the last 200 years, and they give it a different facade.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s giving it an evolutionary facade, but it&rsquo;s just a facade for the same idea, and</p>
<p>that is that somehow because we have eyes, we cannot see, because the light waves are</p>
<p>going through a medium, and that medium necessarily distorted.</p>
<p>The medium changes the resolution at which you see.</p>
<p>If I take off my glasses, I&rsquo;m seeing it a little differently.</p>
<p>The thing is still there, and the thing is still there in the way I see it, because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>grasping the handle and lifting the cup.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an illusion.</p>
<p>That is a real cup.</p>
<p>So do you think some things are more real than others?</p>
<p>For example, money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of things that seem real.</p>
<p>This is not an Animal Farm reference.</p>
<p>Is this going to be about love?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing as real as love, right Lex?</p>
<p>Love is a fundamental part of the quantum mechanics, yes.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There are some things that have become reality because we humans, in a collective sense,</p>
<p>believe it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t believe something collectively.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t become real.</p>
<p>What does it mean to say something&rsquo;s real?</p>
<p>That is, you can, so love, for example, love&rsquo;s a good example, right?</p>
<p>Love is an abstraction, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something I can touch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something I can see, but it&rsquo;s certainly something you would feel.</p>
<p>Not something you can hit.</p>
<p>We love differently.</p>
<p>You and I.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m just too honest about it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t hit love.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, love is an abstraction.</p>
<p>So is love real?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s real because I feel it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an existent, but it&rsquo;s not an existent in the same sense as this cup is.</p>
<p>So abstractions are real, but at the end of the day, all abstractions have to be able</p>
<p>to be reduced to actual concrete so you can either see it.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like criticizing someone whose work I haven&rsquo;t read secondhand.</p>
<p>So I want to take this away from speaking about him personally, because I&rsquo;m not familiar</p>
<p>with his work.</p>
<p>He is a nice guy.</p>
<p>That makes me like him.</p>
<p>That makes him like him less.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re back talking about evolutionary fitness again.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s disingenuousness when we talk about the word real in terms of ideas are</p>
<p>real versus the cup is real, and you try to switch back between those two meanings, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of linguistic wordplay that is trying to force a point that&rsquo;s not accurate,</p>
<p>in my opinion.</p>
<p>Well, I think the issue is, and what he&rsquo;s challenging is, and what Kant is challenging</p>
<p>is, do we know reality?</p>
<p>And I think the answer is yes, we do.</p>
<p>We know reality.</p>
<p>We observe it.</p>
<p>Now, do we know everything about reality?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t, for example, sense what a bat senses as reality.</p>
<p>A bat observes reality through, what is it?</p>
<p>Sonar.</p>
<p>Sound waves, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Through sonar.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So it has a different sense, but it&rsquo;s the same reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a table.</p>
<p>The bat&rsquo;s spatial relationship to the table is different than ours, but the object is</p>
<p>still the same object.</p>
<p>But how do you know that&rsquo;s true?</p>
<p>Are you not just hoping that&rsquo;s true or assuming that&rsquo;s true?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what no means.</p>
<p>No means I have identified an aspect of reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally the definition of knowledge.</p>
<p>Now if you say, how are you certain?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a whole other question, but one of the reasons I know it was certain is because</p>
<p>this happens.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I know this is going to happen.</p>
<p>And if I tell you, if you go downstairs, you&rsquo;re going to see, you know, Mr. Jones and you</p>
<p>walk downstairs and I see Mr. Jones, at the very least, you know, something&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>So what about all the things that mess with our perception?</p>
<p>For example, we&rsquo;ve talked about psychedelics before.</p>
<p>Talked about in dreams where you&rsquo;d be detached from this, I mean, there&rsquo;s certain things</p>
<p>that happen to your brain to where you&rsquo;re not able to perceive.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not perceiving reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So your brain is creating a different reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>How do you know it&rsquo;s not real?</p>
<p>How do you know the elves will meet in the&hellip;</p>
<p>Because partially because I need to take a drug in order to do it, because I&rsquo;m asleep</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m dreaming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not reality.</p>
<p>That is clearly a creation of our mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a creed.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the psychedelics.</p>
<p>The drug is real.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to be thinking I&rsquo;m joking a lot more than I am this episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be the humorist objectivist.</p>
<p>He could be the court jester.</p>
<p>In terms of psychedelic, when people are perceiving these elves, these machine elves, these other</p>
<p>entities, whether they could either be real or not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But the point is that doesn&rsquo;t go to his broader point because if these beings exist and the</p>
<p>only way to perceive them is to take a drug, they still exist.</p>
<p>This is just&hellip;</p>
<p>For example, if I&rsquo;m walking outside in the woods at night and there&rsquo;s a deer and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see it, but if I put on night vision goggles, I can see it.</p>
<p>That deer was there the entire time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the night vision goggles caused the deer to appear.</p>
<p>You can recreate it not only using night vision goggles, but you can then use sonar.</p>
<p>You can use other mechanisms by which to prove that the deer is there.</p>
<p>The thing with psychedelics is that&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know because maybe I&rsquo;m the least experienced</p>
<p>with psychedelics here probably.</p>
<p>My guess is every time you take the psychedelic, you have exactly the same experience of the</p>
<p>deer.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Second, are there other mechanisms, other scientific mechanisms by which I can find</p>
<p>the deer out there other than the psychedelics?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>Well, but the&hellip;</p>
<p>This is Occam&rsquo;s Razor, right?</p>
<p>The simplest explanation here is the most likely, and that is that you&rsquo;ve taken something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s messing with the chemicals in the brain, something is being&hellip;that your brain can project.</p>
<p>We dream.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s arguing that the dream is real and reality is not, or if they are, I think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>nuts.</p>
<p>The dream is a dream.</p>
<p>Your brain is creating an image of telling you a story.</p>
<p>Psychedelics are simulating the same thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s going on until there&rsquo;s evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Well, hold on.</p>
<p>Let me disagree with you a little bit, because let&rsquo;s take Adderall, for example.</p>
<p>No one here disagrees.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something much more simpler and less out of this world.</p>
<p>I think what he might be speaking to, I know Joe Rogan talks about this and other people</p>
<p>in this space, is that when you take certain drugs, it changes your perception.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be otherworldly, it changes your perception of what&rsquo;s around you.</p>
<p>And as an example, what they talk about is, the three of us are talking, there&rsquo;s lots</p>
<p>of other stuff in the room, we&rsquo;re only aware of it vaguely on a personal level.</p>
<p>So it changes the&hellip;</p>
<p>Hold on, let me finish.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Israeli.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re about to start.</p>
<p>This is back to the desert island of murder.</p>
<p>No, but we just resolved it within three seconds.</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no conch.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to get us to feed on the truth.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to create murder.</p>
<p>No one has asthma.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be fine.</p>
<p>Because if the two of you murder each other, there&rsquo;s more food for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no food.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, ratings would go up.</p>
<p>You robots eat alcohol.</p>
<p>Ratings would go up.</p>
<p>Viewership would go up.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s good for the ratings.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if you take, for example, Adderall or speed, right?</p>
<p>People like you focus on things, you perceive things that aren&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean those things weren&rsquo;t there to begin with.</p>
<p>There are absolutely ways to change human perception chemically, through glasses, through</p>
<p>getting drunk.</p>
<p>None of that changes the fact that the reality underneath it is real and is causing this</p>
<p>effect.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And it has a particular nature, right?</p>
<p>And all it&rsquo;s doing is changing the focus, right?</p>
<p>So if I take off my glasses, I&rsquo;m seeing the same thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just seeing something&rsquo;s out of focus and maybe in the distance, I can&rsquo;t see something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gone.</p>
<p>And then I put it on.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>That thing was always there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the sensitivity I have to it has changed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s absolutely not sensitive to everything equally.</p>
<p>And drugs can change the relative sensitivities.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t change reality.</p>
<p>It changes our ability to focus on reality.</p>
<p>Let me give you one great example, the microscope.</p>
<p>I forget who it was.</p>
<p>His name was with an L, the scientist who discovered it.</p>
<p>He had a drop of water and he&rsquo;s seeing monsters, the protozoa in this drop of water.</p>
<p>For him, it must have been, it is like a drug experience, like, wait a minute, I&rsquo;m drinking</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s alien beings whose shapes are completely crazy in this water.</p>
<p>Those beings were always there.</p>
<p>Those beings were there before any of us were here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been there for billions of years.</p>
<p>But because he had this apparatus, now he&rsquo;s able to see protozoa.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s arguing protozoa are extradimensional, no one&rsquo;s arguing the supernatural, amoebas</p>
<p>are well studied, paramecia, all the other lots.</p>
<p>So if these elves, the machine elves are real, and the only way to perceive them is through</p>
<p>DMT or something like that, that doesn&rsquo;t contradict the broader point that they&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>there and this is the mechanism for perceiving them.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the word I was looking for, it&rsquo;s the word actually Greg taught me this, so</p>
<p>Greg Salamieri.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s resolution, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s resolution.</p>
<p>My resolution changes with the glasses.</p>
<p>My resolution gets finer with the microscope.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably some bacteria here on the table.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t use the microscope to not see them, but they&rsquo;re either there or they&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>And I have the tools to discover whether they are there or they&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s called a microscope.</p>
<p>Now there could be even smaller beings that even with a microscope, I won&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>define, but that&rsquo;s completely arbitrary to claim that, that they&rsquo;re there until I find</p>
<p>a tool to be able to discover it.</p>
<p>The same with what you see if you&rsquo;re seeing other beings when you&rsquo;re taking psychedelics.</p>
<p>Unless you find another tool to be able to see them with, the simplest assumption is</p>
<p>probably the truest assumption.</p>
<p>But even the not simplest assumption doesn&rsquo;t contradict the broader point.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Which is again, reality is what it is.</p>
<p>If it turns out that there are these creatures that you can only see with psychedelics, and</p>
<p>there are these creatures that you can only see with psychedelics, and our resolution</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re not on psychedelics is not fine enough to observe them.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that we evolved to survive in reality as it is.</p>
<p>What do you do with the possibility that our resolution as it currently stands is really,</p>
<p>really crappy?</p>
<p>That basically.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>No, but you don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>No, we know it.</p>
<p>We know it completely.</p>
<p>Compared to who?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Compared to the future possibilities like artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years.</p>
<p>It is crappy compared to the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not relevant.</p>
<p>Much, much.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or just the magnitude of crappy.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>No, but here I&rsquo;ll use the standard that Hoffman uses, evolution, right?</p>
<p>The reason I know that our resolution is phenomenal, it&rsquo;s phenomenally good, right?</p>
<p>Because look at us, we&rsquo;re sitting here comfortably in an apartment with air conditioning and</p>
<p>in warm Austin with microphones and we did all this stuff, we&rsquo;re really good at survival</p>
<p>and changing the environment.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you look at the species that we know of, there&rsquo;s not a species that come anywhere</p>
<p>close to our ability to deal with reality, to observe reality, to understand reality</p>
<p>and to shape it.</p>
<p>Now in the future, well, we&rsquo;ll come up with machines that can figure out stuff that we</p>
<p>have no clue about today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only because we&rsquo;re so well suited to reality that can we create those machines.</p>
<p>And I promise you, in the future, it&rsquo;s going to be much more what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>No, but the thing is, when the creatures from the future look back to the things we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>now, what Aydin Rand is saying, what you&rsquo;re saying with certainty, do you think they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>laugh at the level of how much confusion there was, how much inaccuracy?</p>
<p>Did you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Let me get this one.</p>
<p>You know what they&rsquo;re going to do?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to either read Aristotle or read any of these great geniuses of the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these people didn&rsquo;t have electricity.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have warm clothes or anything, and they&rsquo;re able to figure out the diameter</p>
<p>of the Earth.</p>
<p>Like the creativity to be and to get it within a few miles.</p>
<p>The creativity and to figure out the speed of light when you don&rsquo;t even have a stopwatch.</p>
<p>When you look back, a lot of it&rsquo;s nonsense, but it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re talking to a kid.</p>
<p>They would disregard the nonsense, and when they get something right, it&rsquo;s awe.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s never a numbers game, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the few that validate and justify the rest.</p>
<p>So when you look at Aristotle, he&rsquo;s talking about there was one of those causes which</p>
<p>is like time travel and it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense.</p>
<p>But you look at the rest of this stuff or even Plato or any of these greats, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh my, this is an amazing miracle.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say literally miracle, I got you, everyone.</p>
<p>But at the same time, yeah, a lot of these other people had stupid ideas.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>You care about those great, great minds and how they moved us all forward.</p>
<p>To this day, we still study Pythagoras.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even just the sciences and the math.</p>
<p>Think about the philosophy.</p>
<p>How much is there to learn from reading Aristotle or Plato or Socrates when you disagree with</p>
<p>them?</p>
<p>How many giants have there been in all of human history that have had the minds of Socrates</p>
<p>or Plato and Aristotle?</p>
<p>A thousand years where they look back at Plato and Aristotle and admire them?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, they find certain things that are wrong, yes, but certain things that Aristotle discovered</p>
<p>are absolutely right and will always be right.</p>
<p>Certain things that Ayn Rand discovered will always be right.</p>
<p>I think a lot of what she came up with, will some things be discovered to be wrong?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, that wouldn&rsquo;t shock me.</p>
<p>But the genius and the truth that we know today is amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stunning to be pessimistic about us because in the future we&rsquo;ll know more.</p>
<p>Not pessimistic, but more humble.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to be humble.</p>
<p>I mean, I really think humility is a vice, not a virtue.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s there to be humble about?</p>
<p>Look at life.</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>We should be&hellip;</p>
<p>But the word humble has different meanings.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I know what it&rsquo;s going to get.</p>
<p>I mean, humility in a sense of not appreciating the genius and the ability and the success</p>
<p>and all the stuff that we as individuals, I think, in our lives, but as a culture, as</p>
<p>a movement, if you think about movement in terms of those of us who respect reason have</p>
<p>achieved in spite of the odds, we should be proud of that and pride as the virtue.</p>
<p>Humility in the sense of, yeah, I know there&rsquo;s more to know.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot more to know and in the future we&rsquo;ll know more.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the way&hellip;</p>
<p>See, I take humility as the way the Christians use it, which is the other way.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a real vice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t think of yourself too much just because you can think that&rsquo;s no big deal or</p>
<p>just because you can create this stuff.</p>
<p>It is a big deal.</p>
<p>Your achievements are a big deal and you should take credit for them.</p>
<p>So be careful with the word humility because the real meaning is the Christian meaning,</p>
<p>which is a very, very bad meaning.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Let me be a little pedantic because there&rsquo;s no such thing as real meaning, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different meanings.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>This is semantics, but here&rsquo;s another real meaning that you&rsquo;re not going to disagree</p>
<p>with, which is the smartest person on earth is ignorant of 99.9% of knowledge, right?</p>
<p>So if I meet someone who is less intelligent than me and less informed than me, it is still</p>
<p>certain that this person has things to teach me.</p>
<p>If I go to a mechanic and maybe this guy&rsquo;s dumb as rocks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about cars.</p>
<p>What he tells me about that car is good.</p>
<p>I could take it to the bank.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to be in a position to inform me.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons humility is extremely important is very often you have people and</p>
<p>you see this very much in academia who think you know exactly where I&rsquo;m going around who</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re know what else and they think, oh, I have this degree.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a layman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never been formally educated.</p>
<p>Therefore not only you dumb and uneducated and you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like this person might be have won a great example of this.</p>
<p>And this is an example you might not like is a lot of times you have these native populations</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll have a better understanding of the animals around them, the plants, the fruits,</p>
<p>whatever.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have these scientists and be like, oh, they&rsquo;re talking about this monster in</p>
<p>the woods.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>This giant, this giant ape.</p>
<p>But it was real.</p>
<p>It was the gorilla.</p>
<p>But you know, you dismiss them because, oh, these are stupid, ignorant, whatever people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of changed to some extent.</p>
<p>But that is an aspect of humility that I think behooves especially highly intelligent people</p>
<p>because there is such a presumption to be dismissive of people who you regard as less</p>
<p>than.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re often right.</p>
<p>So I agree.</p>
<p>I agree with all of the concrete examples.</p>
<p>I just think we should come up with a better word than humility.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have one because I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not a woodsmith.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>This is not my strength.</p>
<p>But humility, humility is a is a word from the Christian ethics.</p>
<p>And it means something very specific in the field of ethics.</p>
<p>And it means the opposite of of what I think virtue requires.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s demeaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to put you down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to it&rsquo;s to it&rsquo;s to resist pride.</p>
<p>And I think pride is a very important thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>But again, you have to define your terms properly.</p>
<p>Hating myself has has been quite useful for me as well, but that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re Russian</p>
<p>and Jewish.</p>
<p>So by what this changes, you know, this is this is what happens, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re brought up to, you know, to to feel exactly that way in a good Russian boy.</p>
<p>So we got him.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Gimmat again.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Gimmat again.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What it says?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Gimmat again.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But as long as you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>But is it kosher?</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Check if it&rsquo;s kosher.</p>
<p>This is Ukrainian, my friend.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, my God.</p>
<p>That is a sin.</p>
<p>How dare you?</p>
<p>That is really simple.</p>
<p>You know, me and Sinai were born in the same town.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>My dad is Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get mad.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t think self self.</p>
<p>What did you how did you define it?</p>
<p>Self hate?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think self hate is quite destructive.</p>
<p>Speak for yourself.</p>
<p>I think that humility is quite destructive.</p>
<p>Humility in the sense of I&rsquo;m no big deal.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;ve achieved something in life, you are a big deal.</p>
<p>You are a big deal because, you know, look, you got the two of us to fly into town just</p>
<p>to sit down here and have a conversation with you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a big deal.</p>
<p>That says more about you than me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just desperate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re lonely and depraved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not lonely.</p>
<p>I might be desperate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to question your ability to reason with the decisions you&rsquo;re making on the on</p>
<p>the aspect of and I should mention that The Idiot by Dostoevsky is one of my favorite</p>
<p>novels and there is a Christian ethic that runs through that.</p>
<p>I mean, because because, yeah, I mean, particularly but I hate to bring this up, but particularly</p>
<p>Russians and particularly Russian Jews and particularly Eastern European Jews are incredibly</p>
<p>Christian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a real Christian theme in in Judaism that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s about guilt.</p>
<p>Guilt is not there&rsquo;s no guilt in Judaism.</p>
<p>King David doesn&rsquo;t feel any guilt.</p>
<p>Solomon doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no guilt in the in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Plenty of guilt.</p>
<p>Once Christianity has an impact on Judaism, we&rsquo;re raised to feel this way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re raised to be humble.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re raised not to feel special.</p>
<p>We were raised to think we&rsquo;re no big deal and to and our mothers put us down and and</p>
<p>use that against us and try to inflict guilt on us.</p>
<p>They raise us up and then they knock us down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mechanism, but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a cultural mechanism.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very destructive to self esteem and to happiness.</p>
<p>Let me and I&rsquo;ll give you a great he&rsquo;s absolutely right with what he just said.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why is he right?</p>
<p>Because like my family, for example, it still doesn&rsquo;t really understand how I could pay</p>
<p>the rent because I don&rsquo;t go into an office.</p>
<p>And like when I started out trying to be a writer, the immediate reaction isn&rsquo;t which</p>
<p>is a lot of times I talk to kids, right, and they have these aspirations.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell them, go for it while you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>If you fail, you&rsquo;ll go to your grave with like I tried my best.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make it happen.</p>
<p>Whereas if you don&rsquo;t try and never achieve, you are going to feel horrible for the rest</p>
<p>of your life.</p>
<p>And this is the example I use all the time.</p>
<p>I bring up many times I go go to any bookstore and look at all those terrible, terrible books</p>
<p>on the shelves that you wonder, how is this a book that could be you?</p>
<p>You could be that crappy writer.</p>
<p>But the thing is, in that culture that Yaron was talking about, you tell your family, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be a writer.</p>
<p>Who do you think you are?</p>
<p>Why do you think you&rsquo;re going to be?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re no Stephen King.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, why do you have to be Stephen King?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you just be a mediocre, crappy writer making the rent?</p>
<p>The best that you can be.</p>
<p>But even that is an amazing accomplishment.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t have to go to an office and I write books that not that many people read, this</p>
<p>is the story of my life, at the same time, I do have pride because I made this happen.</p>
<p>You can be the best version.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a cliche, but you can be the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a competition.</p>
<p>And yet our Jewish mothers, that&rsquo;s not what they aspire us to be.</p>
<p>They aspire us to be the best version of what they imagine, what the culture imagines, what</p>
<p>society imagined, not what, it&rsquo;s not about you in their minds.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen it, I see it all around me.</p>
<p>People putting their kids down, putting themselves down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not healthy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never told this story, I&rsquo;m going to tell it now.</p>
<p>When I graduated college, I was a temp for a while because I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re a temp, it&rsquo;s like playing roulette.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have jobs that pay well, that suck, and pay well that are great or that</p>
<p>are great that don&rsquo;t pay well and suck and pay poorly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s you and you&rsquo;re 21, you have that kind of space.</p>
<p>And my grandmother was talking to her brother, you know, he&rsquo;s talking about his kids, she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talking about me, she&rsquo;s, you know, from Odessa.</p>
<p>And she told me she lied to him about how much money I was making.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve never brought up and it still hurts me.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, your approval of me should be a function of my character, my happiness.</p>
<p>And the fact that you feel ashamed over how much money I&rsquo;m making, especially at this</p>
<p>point in my life, I thought was very, really misplaced priorities.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a huge benefit to the humility, terms aside, for believing that others can</p>
<p>teach you a lot.</p>
<p>Everybody, everybody can teach you a lot.</p>
<p>I think we all agree on that.</p>
<p>I just mentioned that, the mechanic.</p>
<p>No, you do.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly the point.</p>
<p>But for that, I do believe you have to not constantly sort of break your ego apart and</p>
<p>constantly question whether you know anything about this world and sort of there&rsquo;s a negativity</p>
<p>with it that I think is very useful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also very fulfilling, just constantly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the other way around.</p>
<p>I find that the more, the more I know, the more I know I know, the easier it is for me</p>
<p>to learn from other people.</p>
<p>The broader a context I have, the more curious I become, the more areas I know.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s true that the more you know, the more areas you know you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And the more I find myself attracted to people who can teach me something about things I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Whereas if I was ignorant, if I truly believed I didn&rsquo;t know anything, I don&rsquo;t know how I</p>
<p>would live.</p>
<p>It would really completely challenge everything, everything about life for me.</p>
<p>Where would I even start?</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t know where to start.</p>
<p>So no, I think, and if you don&rsquo;t recognize what you know, you don&rsquo;t have a full appreciation</p>
<p>of yourself.</p>
<p>So really building a recognition of what do I know, right?</p>
<p>And how much do I know is really crucial to living.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you something else that furthers my life enormously is when you reach a certain</p>
<p>point in your career in your life, and you&rsquo;re talking to people who are a lot younger, and</p>
<p>they might be smart, driven, intelligent, they lack data.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re 23, you don&rsquo;t know how to speak corporate, you don&rsquo;t know what the code words</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>So if I am in a position to sit down with this kid and be like, do X, Y, and Z, and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m coming to this conclusion.</p>
<p>This is the information that released me this conclusion.</p>
<p>And I can save them from some of the suffering I went through.</p>
<p>That is very gratifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making the world a better place.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the opposite in a sense of humility, because like, in this context, I&rsquo;m an expert,</p>
<p>or at least knowledgeable enough that I&rsquo;m comfortable giving you advice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And look, everything I do is about me knowing stuff that other people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I know a lot of stuff other people don&rsquo;t, and I do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a teacher.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a teacher at heart, always have been.</p>
<p>It turns out, I didn&rsquo;t know that early on, but I like becoming an expert and then trying</p>
<p>to teach people.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean I know everything.</p>
<p>Quite the contrary.</p>
<p>Again, the more I know, the more I know that the certain things I don&rsquo;t know and the certain</p>
<p>areas of expertise I don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>But look, pride is a broader concept than that.</p>
<p>Pride is about, and humility is the opposite of pride.</p>
<p>And Christianity has that right.</p>
<p>Pride is about taking your life seriously.</p>
<p>Pride is about wanting to be really good at living, wanting to have the knowledge.</p>
<p>And I think what you&rsquo;re describing is, you&rsquo;re describing as I&rsquo;m constantly learning.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to challenge myself, I have to question what I believe in order to gain</p>
<p>new knowledge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all good, but that is a drive that is driven by pride.</p>
<p>You want to know.</p>
<p>There are lots of people out there that don&rsquo;t want to know, because they don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>pride.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have that commitment to live, the commitment to achieving something.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to say something else that I think is crucial.</p>
<p>Humility is extremely important when it comes to politics.</p>
<p>Because if you feel comfortable telling someone you&rsquo;ve never met how to live their life, that</p>
<p>is a complete lack of humility.</p>
<p>I lack it, obviously, because I tell people how to live all the time.</p>
<p>Not through force.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>And of course, not in the concrete.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tell them, you know, move to, although I do tell them to move to Austin, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell them this is what you do as a profession.</p>
<p>But I give them the principles, because I think they&rsquo;re principles of how to live.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making the choice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>Politically, what I&rsquo;m saying is it shows a lack of humility to be like, I&rsquo;ve never met</p>
<p>this person.</p>
<p>This is how I&rsquo;m going to take money from him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to&hellip;</p>
<p>See, but I don&rsquo;t see that humility.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the lack of humility.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s not even a lack of humility, because it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Who am I to tell them how to live?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s lack of humility.</p>
<p>No, of course you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>No, who are you to tell them how to live is an issue of&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an issue of force and rights and a bunch of different things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a lack of humility there.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a lack of being a human being.</p>
<p>It can be both.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, who gives you the right to dictate to somebody else how to live their lives?</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s a lack of humility, if you think you have that right.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re using humility in a very different way.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re using the same way, because the person who feels comfortable, they think,</p>
<p>I know better than you how you should live your life to the point where I&rsquo;m a couple</p>
<p>forcing you, because I know it&rsquo;s gonna be best for you in the long run.</p>
<p>And the answer is you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Right, but that&rsquo;s a lack of humility.</p>
<p>I think in your mind, you&rsquo;re on humility somehow tied to the Christian concept, the humility,</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re kind of allergic to the word.</p>
<p>Well, absolutely, because it&rsquo;s part of&hellip;</p>
<p>If you look at the cardinal virtues, the cardinal sins in Christianity, pride is a cardinal</p>
<p>sin and humility is a cardinal virtue, but they don&rsquo;t mean it in the sense, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy to tell you how to live, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re happy to be philosopher kings over your life, and they believe that&rsquo;s being humble.</p>
<p>And you should be humble, by the way, in listening to the Pope or listening to God, because what</p>
<p>do you know?</p>
<p>You know nothing.</p>
<p>God knows everything, so you should shut up and do what you&rsquo;re told.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sense in which I don&rsquo;t think you should be humble.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a sense in which I always use the example of Abraham, right?</p>
<p>God comes to Abraham and says, go kill your oldest son, your only son, right?</p>
<p>Your only son.</p>
<p>Go kill him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>And what does Abraham do?</p>
<p>He says, yes, sir.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll follow&hellip;</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a moral hero, for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, he&rsquo;s a moral hero, because he follows</p>
<p>orders, because he&rsquo;s humble.</p>
<p>I would tell God to go to hell.</p>
<p>Screw you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not killing my son.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>But he killed&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, he killed his son, so it&rsquo;s only fair.</p>
<p>Well, this is before he killed his son, so I didn&rsquo;t know that, right?</p>
<p>No, but part of the evil, part of the evil of Christianity is that he&rsquo;s killed his son</p>
<p>in the most torturous form of death possible.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole story of Jesus is one of the most immoral, unjust stories ever told,</p>
<p>and that Christians elevate this to a position of&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to have this conversation with Jordan, right?</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>The idea of elevating&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll never happen.</p>
<p>No, it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But elevating Jesus, exactly, elevating Jesus to a superhero status for one of the most</p>
<p>immoral acts in human history is horrific.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m opposed to God sacrificing his own son, never mind my son, but let him</p>
<p>go do it to his own son.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t kill Isaac.</p>
<p>He killed the goat.</p>
<p>The story&rsquo;s about Abraham, not about God.</p>
<p>First of all, God is mean, right, to put Abraham through that.</p>
<p>But Abraham has to assume that he&rsquo;s going to kill his son, and he lifts his&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to do it, and he stopped.</p>
<p>So the whole point is obedience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what humility leads to.</p>
<p>It leads to the opposite of the story you were telling.</p>
<p>It leads to people saying, yes, I should be told what to do.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the authority who actually knows something?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>No, I know a lot, and I know a lot about my life.</p>
<p>The science&hellip;</p>
<p>So you stay away from my life because I have pride in my life.</p>
<p>The science is settled, right?</p>
<p>Look at these experts.</p>
<p>Who am I to argue with these experts?</p>
<p>They tell me to drink dog pee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to drink&hellip;</p>
<p>What am I, not drink dog pee?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the island.</p>
<p>Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on an island again?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back to the island.</p>
<p>Manhattan.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s go to the island.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I live on an island.</p>
<p>Everything is an island in some context.</p>
<p>Like Earth is an island.</p>
<p>This universe is an island in a multiverse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no multiverses.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one universe.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s invite Jordan Peterson to this island.</p>
<p>You wish.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on a sec.</p>
<p>Hey, girl.</p>
<p>Whatcha doing?</p>
<p>Lex.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman?</p>
<p>Look him up.</p>
<p>Lex who?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Lex who?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Lex says something as big of a following almost as Jordan does.</p>
<p>I know Jordan.</p>
<p>I know his family actually through Jim Keller, who&rsquo;s his relative.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an engineer.</p>
<p>And I just talked to Sam, who is perhaps a little bit aligned in some sense on your perspective</p>
<p>on religion and so on.</p>
<p>So let me ask, is there some&hellip;</p>
<p>Religion, yes.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Other things, no.</p>
<p>Sam Harris.</p>
<p>Sam Harris, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Sam Harris.</p>
<p>I thought you were talking about baseball.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just talked to Sam.</p>
<p>I thought&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about humility.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about humility, Lex.</p>
<p>My buddy Sam.</p>
<p>I was talking to Barack.</p>
<p>You might know him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I simply&hellip;</p>
<p>Humility went out the window.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a natural language processing model that I assume that once I mentioned Jordan</p>
<p>Peterson, it becomes an obvious statement what Sam means.</p>
<p>This is how neural networks think.</p>
<p>This is how robots think, Michael, you should know this.</p>
<p>I thought by now you&rsquo;d be a scholar.</p>
<p>For the sake of the audience.</p>
<p>Humility.</p>
<p>Everything can teach you something, even the robot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;s value in religion or broader?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s value in myth?</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ve been talking about the value of reason, do you think it&rsquo;s possible to argue</p>
<p>in society as we grow the population of our little island that there&rsquo;s some value of common</p>
<p>myths, of common stories, of common religion?</p>
<p>There was value.</p>
<p>There is no value today.</p>
<p>So human beings need explanations, right?</p>
<p>They need a philosophy to guide their life.</p>
<p>They need ethics.</p>
<p>They need some explanation of what&rsquo;s going on in the world, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no accident that the early religions had a river god and they had a sun god and</p>
<p>a moon god because everything they didn&rsquo;t understand, they made god, right?</p>
<p>So they had multiple gods because they didn&rsquo;t understand very much.</p>
<p>As human understanding evolved, it increased, as we knew reality more, right?</p>
<p>We came to the conclusion of, you know, this is very inefficient to have all these gods.</p>
<p>This is a genius of Judaism, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just have one bucket to put all the stuff we don&rsquo;t know in and we&rsquo;ll call it one</p>
<p>god and then we don&rsquo;t, as we gain new knowledge, we can just take it out of the bucket that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>god and put it into the bucket of science.</p>
<p>At some point, though, at some point, and that point suddenly came during the scientific</p>
<p>revolution, I think, we could come to the conclusion that, no, we don&rsquo;t need this bucket</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called god to explain the things that we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We can say we don&rsquo;t know and we&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>And slowly our knowledge is increasing and yet there&rsquo;s a lot more that we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t need to throw it into some bucket that&rsquo;s called god in order to have it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true for morality and it&rsquo;s true for everything else, right?</p>
<p>As we gain the tools to understand what morality requires, we don&rsquo;t need a set of commandments.</p>
<p>We can figure out morality from human nature and from reality.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we need religion anymore.</p>
<p>I think religion needed to die probably about 200 years ago and was dying, I think, up until</p>
<p>Kant.</p>
<p>It seemed to be dying.</p>
<p>Kant&rsquo;s missions, as he says, is to revive religion against attack of reason in the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Now mythology is a little different because it depends what you mean by mythology.</p>
<p>Certainly we need stories and certainly we need art.</p>
<p>Art is a&hellip;</p>
<p>And Rand writes about this a lot and she&rsquo;s an artist and she writes in&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the Romantic Manifesto, which I think is one of her underappreciated</p>
<p>masterpieces.</p>
<p>Oh, I hate it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I think we have a real need, right?</p>
<p>As a conceptual being, we have a need for aesthetic experiences.</p>
<p>We have a need to concretize abstractions, to concretize abstract ideas, to concretize</p>
<p>the complex nature of the world out there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what painting sculpture, to an extent music, but painting sculpture literature</p>
<p>does for us.</p>
<p>So to the extent that mythology serves that purpose, it&rsquo;s just art, right?</p>
<p>To the extent that it serves another purpose, that is that it&rsquo;s a way for the gods to communicate</p>
<p>with us or it fits some kind of preexisting mental construct that we have as, again, kind</p>
<p>of a conscientious perspective, right?</p>
<p>That we have these categorical imperatives and this mythology links up to that.</p>
<p>Then I think it&rsquo;s false, it&rsquo;s not helpful and destructive.</p>
<p>So I believe religion today is a destructive force on planet Earth.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s always been a destructive force.</p>
<p>It was just a necessary force, right?</p>
<p>You needed an explanation.</p>
<p>People needed something to believe in.</p>
<p>Once you get philosophy and once you get philosophy that starts explaining real life, real world,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need religion anymore and indeed it becomes a destructive force.</p>
<p>And you look around the world today, it&rsquo;s an unbelievably destructive force.</p>
<p>Everywhere it touches is bad for life.</p>
<p>Again, mythology depends, art is essential, very, very crucial to human existence.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think, but you don&rsquo;t see religion and philosophy and</p>
<p>mythology as just a continuous spectrum?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So religion is a primitive form of philosophy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s prephilosophical.</p>
<p>Where I thought Rand was going to go and he didn&rsquo;t go was that I think he, I agree with</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s going to say, Rand was a mythologizer.</p>
<p>In certain specific contexts Atlas Shrugged is a myth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to sit down and say, these are the people who move us forward.</p>
<p>These are the values that are important.</p>
<p>When you experience it through a story, through a movie, through a TV show, a poem or a painting,</p>
<p>it affects you in a very visceral, very different way.</p>
<p>Talk about American history.</p>
<p>You have the founding fathers, then you have the myth of the founding fathers.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately the term myth often means lie, but it could mean in a useful sense,</p>
<p>an abstraction to help you systematize and concretize ideas.</p>
<p>So you have the myth of Reagan, you have the myth of Thatcher, the reality often falls</p>
<p>very short.</p>
<p>But when you look at how these different figures are mythologized, not only is it very inspirational</p>
<p>on a personal level, very motivating on a personal level, it&rsquo;s also a great way to concretize</p>
<p>ideas because just how humans think, it&rsquo;s one thing to think about ideas, but when you</p>
<p>see someone who embodies these ideas, Miss America, I was saying earlier, I had an aster</p>
<p>on my show, these people might be jerks.</p>
<p>But when you look at them, one specific aspect of their life and you extrapolate it, that</p>
<p>could be to anyone very motivating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important for people to have the belief that happiness and achievement</p>
<p>is possible because it&rsquo;s very hard to keep that in mind, especially if you&rsquo;re depressed,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re anxious, you&rsquo;re unemployed, you don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend, you think it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be like this forever.</p>
<p>And then you look at someone&rsquo;s story and they&rsquo;re like, you know what, that astronaut interview,</p>
<p>Clayton Anderson, he applied 13 times, didn&rsquo;t get a call back, applied the 14th time, got</p>
<p>a call back, didn&rsquo;t get the job, 15th time he get the job.</p>
<p>He talks to kids and he goes, listen, apply 13 times.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t get the call back, you&rsquo;ll still feel I&rsquo;m doing something.</p>
<p>And having heard him and the myth of Clayton Anderson, this is going to tell people, yeah,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>That could be me.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just happiness, it&rsquo;s the fact that virtue works, that the integrity, I mean,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the power of the fountainhead?</p>
<p>I know you love the fountainhead.</p>
<p>Part of the power of the fountainhead is how it works, absolute commitment to integrity.</p>
<p>He is committed to integrity and he&rsquo;s happy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very rare in life to see that, to actually see a concrete of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to hold it in your mind.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m going to be stuck in the quarry or I&rsquo;m going to be stuck doing this horrible</p>
<p>job.</p>
<p>But if I stick to my principles, I&rsquo;m going to be how it works.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve got that concrete.</p>
<p>I know I can immediately relate to that success.</p>
<p>So I think art is essential.</p>
<p>And I think in a sense, what we do to Thatcher and Reagan is art.</p>
<p>You have to be careful in true stories, not to diverge too far from reality because then</p>
<p>when you discover the reality, you don&rsquo;t want to whitewash it, and particularly when it</p>
<p>has political implications and then it&rsquo;s really bad.</p>
<p>So particularly with Reagan and Thatcher, you have to be careful because they want anyone</p>
<p>near as good as people try to make them out to be.</p>
<p>But these are powerful, powerful, powerful stories and people are moved by it.</p>
<p>And the integration of emotion with reason is crucial.</p>
<p>One of the goals to be happy is to bring your emotions in line with your thinking.</p>
<p>And I think that stories and arts more broadly, and when I go and see Michelangelo&rsquo;s David,</p>
<p>it does the same thing to me.</p>
<p>I can stand up to anybody because he did.</p>
<p>And look, he succeeded.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that he could.</p>
<p>So this is a really interesting idea of bringing your emotion in line with your thinking, with</p>
<p>your reasoning.</p>
<p>So Ben Shapiro famously has this saying, how do you like that transition, Michael?</p>
<p>Give me props.</p>
<p>I know you do.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not Ben, it&rsquo;s Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Someone is not taking your calls.</p>
<p>Benny.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a daily, don&rsquo;t take the caller.</p>
<p>Back to the island with the murder.</p>
<p>I think we know.</p>
<p>Murder Island.</p>
<p>We would know who would be committing the murder.</p>
<p>I have the suit for it.</p>
<p>So he has the saying of facts don&rsquo;t care about your feelings.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always felt badly about that statement somehow, like it was incomplete.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting that you mentioned bringing your emotions in line with your thinking.</p>
<p>What do you think about that statement?</p>
<p>I got this one.</p>
<p>What Ben is doing in a loose way is attacking Kantianism because Kant, it&rsquo;s almost impossible</p>
<p>for Westerners who aren&rsquo;t schooled in this to understand the idea of philosophical idealism</p>
<p>because it sounds so crazy that you&rsquo;re like, these great minds of all time can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>be saying this.</p>
<p>I must be missing something.</p>
<p>So when we hear idealism, we think John F. Kennedy is a good example.</p>
<p>You aspire things.</p>
<p>You think life can be better than it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what it means in a philosophical sense.</p>
<p>In philosophical idealism, it means ideas are more real than reality.</p>
<p>That I have this idea, then this comes along.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reality that isn&rsquo;t correct.</p>
<p>My idea is still correct.</p>
<p>A good example of this that you see all the time on the internet is when they refer to</p>
<p>Mitt Romney and John McCain as rhinos, Republicans in name only.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, who is more a real Republican?</p>
<p>The nominee of the party, the Senator, the governor of the party, or some person in your</p>
<p>mind who has never existed and there&rsquo;s no evidence for them existing.</p>
<p>So what Kant did is he bifurcated reality into what we see around us, the phenomenal</p>
<p>world, but then it&rsquo;s inferior.</p>
<p>The real world, the noumenal world, we can&rsquo;t access it because we have eyes.</p>
<p>We only see the thing as it appears, not as it is in itself.</p>
<p>And because of this, everything we know is a shadow and is secondary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Plato, straight out of Plato.</p>
<p>And the real reality is this realm of ideas.</p>
<p>So when Ben is saying facts don&rsquo;t care about your feelings, what he is really saying is</p>
<p>reality comes first.</p>
<p>Your feelings have to be a response or a reaction to it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say, this is how I feel.</p>
<p>This table doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>You can yell at it all day long.</p>
<p>It will still be indifferent to your emotional state because it comes first.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great statement.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s cribbing it from Ayn Rand in a sense, and there&rsquo;s a sense in which he is.</p>
<p>I mean, who popularized that kind of idea?</p>
<p>And Ben has read Ayn Rand quite extensively.</p>
<p>Not enough.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Not enough to reference her.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way the army goes.</p>
<p>So yeah, obviously.</p>
<p>He may be read enough, but didn&rsquo;t understand enough.</p>
<p>But so it&rsquo;s absolutely reality.</p>
<p>Reality is unaffected by your emotional state and your feelings about it.</p>
<p>And this is a great claim against the idealism, the philosophical idealism of much of the</p>
<p>world out there, both left and right.</p>
<p>I think politically, culturally, the left and right are detached from reality.</p>
<p>They live in a different dimension, in a different space that they are creating in their own</p>
<p>minds that has nothing to do with the real world.</p>
<p>And when they fail, they make stuff up to justify their failure, right?</p>
<p>So all of really the ideas that are promulgated today on both sides are this kind of detached</p>
<p>from reality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting emotions or ideas before reality itself.</p>
<p>But I believe that emotions are responses.</p>
<p>The responses to reality conditioned by our existing concepts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to talk slowly to talk emotions to Lex because he doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>understand what that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really, you got to really taste your words.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s big on love?</p>
<p>What is love?</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s big on love?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to learn.</p>
<p>Pretty big on love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in, I&rsquo;m a love maximalist.</p>
<p>I mean, I could create, we could create an environment on this island where you would</p>
<p>really feel emotions.</p>
<p>Like fear is an emotion.</p>
<p>We could.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the metaphysical terror.</p>
<p>We could easily terrorize you to the point where you felt fear, right?</p>
<p>So we could teach him about emotion.</p>
<p>But emotions are a response to reality.</p>
<p>So some people, for example, you could take five different people and show them exactly</p>
<p>the same thing.</p>
<p>And some of them would feel fear and some of them would actually feel indifferent and</p>
<p>other people might feel love, right?</p>
<p>I think Leonard Peacock uses the example of looking through a microscope and seeing a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a virus or bacteria.</p>
<p>And for one, it&rsquo;s a scientist, he&rsquo;s made a new discovery.</p>
<p>He feels pride and love and awe.</p>
<p>The one has no clue, right, and he&rsquo;s looking at this and it means nothing to them and somebody</p>
<p>else might look at it and it&rsquo;s a bacteria and they feel fear because of what it could</p>
<p>do to them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s conditioned by what you know, what your values are and your level of knowledge</p>
<p>and what the thing is out there in reality.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that into, so your emotions respond to that.</p>
<p>So aligning your emotions with your reason is making sure that your emotions are really</p>
<p>conditioned by what you know explicitly versus what you&rsquo;ve internalized implicitly that</p>
<p>you might not agree with anymore.</p>
<p>You know, things might happen in your childhood and they probably do, right, where you get</p>
<p>a trauma.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m afraid of dogs and maybe when I was a five year old, some dogs jumped</p>
<p>at me and I don&rsquo;t even remember it, right?</p>
<p>But I came to a conclusion when I was five, dogs bad, dogs dangerous, right?</p>
<p>And now anytime I see a dog, oh my God, that bringing my emotions aligned with reality,</p>
<p>right, with my ideas is no, now I understand dogs don&rsquo;t have to be scary.</p>
<p>I can work through this and there are various techniques and hopefully if there is such</p>
<p>a science of psychology, but in psychology to get you to the point where you can get</p>
<p>rid of that fear and align your emotion now with your explicit ideas, and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I mean by that.</p>
<p>And let me build on that, talking about your friend Putin, I think I mentioned this before</p>
<p>at least maybe on the show, he was meeting with Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>Oh, Vladimir, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, Vlad, my boy Vlad.</p>
<p>He was meeting with Angela Merkel, Angela Merkel has a fear of dogs, so he brought out</p>
<p>his big Labrador Retriever, now for people who don&rsquo;t know, Labradors are very big dogs,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also like the least aggressive, it&rsquo;s like you could punch them in the face,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>That dog is not going to be more likely to attack just because she&rsquo;s scared.</p>
<p>And I know they say animals can sense fear, domesticated dogs, if they see you&rsquo;re scared,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to be aggressive, they&rsquo;re going to try to play.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a kid, there was this dog, Rex, this German Shepherd, I&rsquo;m five,</p>
<p>this dog is gigantic, and I&rsquo;m sitting on the couch, the German Shepherds have been bred</p>
<p>for intelligence, they&rsquo;re very bright dogs, they&rsquo;re very good with kids, he&rsquo;s sitting</p>
<p>next to me, this thing is three times my size.</p>
<p>He very gently puts his paw on my leg to be like, kid, he can sense my fear, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do it, I want to be your friend, I&rsquo;m still freaking out.</p>
<p>He licks my hand, it&rsquo;s just very scary, you know, animals are so bright, but that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing is, in terms of facts don&rsquo;t care about your feelings, that dog is not more likely</p>
<p>to attack someone because their emotion is so intense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I feel something very strongly, therefore, this thing is more likely to happen.</p>
<p>So my intensity of my emotion does not in any way correlate, when you&rsquo;re being irrational,</p>
<p>to the likelihood of that thing actually happening.</p>
<p>Now, you could have a dog that does respond to your emotion, right?</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s, but then it&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s part of reality, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fact of reality that certain dogs respond to certain emotions.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t this emotion a part of reality, like, okay, let me say a word.</p>
<p>So part of that, I would even say, don&rsquo;t let your emotion about your emotion, right, because</p>
<p>sometimes you have an emotion about your emotion, don&rsquo;t be repressed, and identify the emotion</p>
<p>as reality, and evaluate it, don&rsquo;t judge it, evaluate it.</p>
<p>Is it a rational emotion?</p>
<p>Is it consistent with my, like, if I&rsquo;m afraid of these dogs, if I feel that fear, is it</p>
<p>rational to be afraid of these dogs?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re speaking to your own individual trajectory as a human being as you grow through</p>
<p>the world and try to understand reality and connect yourself through reason to reality.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is a term like lived experience.</p>
<p>When you observe and analyze the, you know, conversations with other people to try to</p>
<p>understand how other people see the world, doesn&rsquo;t emotion fundamentally integrate into</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>Like, isn&rsquo;t emotion lived experience?</p>
<p>So everybody experiences the same reality, but the way they experience it might be very</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>And that has to do with what?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to do with‚Ä¶</p>
<p>With their values, with their conclusions, with their ideas, with their experiences,</p>
<p>with a million different things, right?</p>
<p>But is it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s about the conclusions that they come to, which are then</p>
<p>shaping their emotions.</p>
<p>But look, emotions are not something to be avoided or ignored.</p>
<p>That is, I can sense your emotions to some extent, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>Okay, it is Lex.</p>
<p>I can sense his emotions.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can sense Michael&rsquo;s emotions, and that&rsquo;s part of the fact of reality, right?</p>
<p>So if Michael responds to something that I view as really, really important, right?</p>
<p>If we were standing in front of Michelangelo&rsquo;s David, and Michael responds to Michelangelo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>David and goes, eh, and turned his back to it and walked away, that would be really meaningful</p>
<p>to me, right?</p>
<p>That I would respond emotionally to that, and cognitively I would say, what is it about</p>
<p>Michael that makes him, you know, respond this way?</p>
<p>That is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>That gives me a lot of information about him.</p>
<p>So emotions are information laden, right?</p>
<p>But they are not primary.</p>
<p>They are responses, responses to something.</p>
<p>So one must be very aware of one&rsquo;s own emotions, recognize them, and analyze them.</p>
<p>And one should be aware of other people&rsquo;s emotions, if they&rsquo;re important to you, if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not important to you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care about a stranger&rsquo;s emotion, you know, like a stranger walks up to Michael</p>
<p>and Michelangelo&rsquo;s David and said, eh, and walks away, and I go, okay, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a stranger.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know what Michael&rsquo;s response to Michelangelo&rsquo;s David was or is, so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a little worried about what he&rsquo;s gonna say.</p>
<p>You got candy too, that was great.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, I thought I was special.</p>
<p>Do I get Ukrainian candy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t read either.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this say, Joshua?</p>
<p>What does that say to him?</p>
<p>Is this Ukrainian candy as well?</p>
<p>I thought it was sent to me from‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Do you know that Atlas Shrugged was the bestselling book in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016?</p>
<p>Do you know Atlas Shrugged was translated to Russian by someone who&rsquo;s now a crypto like</p>
<p>billionaire and he made like six copies and I have one of them and I sent it to my great</p>
<p>grandma.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re more than six, but yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, but they were like‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Because I have a copy too.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Not I personally, the institute has a copy.</p>
<p>I sent it to my great grandma and she said, why is he sending me this, I wanna read books</p>
<p>about love.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you know what?</p>
<p>This is about love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you should have said.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that, what does that say?</p>
<p>So this says it&rsquo;s‚Ä¶</p>
<p>It has vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in Russian, I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>It just sounds really strange to read like health information in Russian, I&rsquo;m already</p>
<p>distressed.</p>
<p>But look, there&rsquo;s a Yorshik like you have.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m much, I like Kiev much more than I like Moscow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Strong words.</p>
<p>But this is, this is not, it&rsquo;s like hard candy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think this, some of my friends sent me that&rsquo;s made with blood to give the kids iron.</p>
<p>Whose blood?</p>
<p>Like cow blood.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Like with chocolate.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You can keep it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping both of these.</p>
<p>Can I take something you&rsquo;re talking about with emotion?</p>
<p>Something that is very pernicious in terms of emotion is people denying the validity</p>
<p>of their own emotions.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s one example, someone could be in an abusive relationship or have had an</p>
<p>abusive childhood and they think, well, I didn&rsquo;t have a black eye.</p>
<p>We had dinner on the table.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t abusive because you hear some other story.</p>
<p>So they feel their emotion is invalid or like, oh, he never lays hands on me.</p>
<p>He gets drunk and is mean to me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still basically a good person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re denying that emotion.</p>
<p>And that emotion is a response to something real.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an expression, I have friends who are in 12 step programs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an expression there, which I think is very profound, which is if it&rsquo;s hysterical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s historical.</p>
<p>Meaning if some minor incident is having an extreme disproportionate impact on you, think,</p>
<p>ask yourself, why am I responding in such an extreme way to some minor thing?</p>
<p>And I will tell you 10 times out of 10, you&rsquo;ll go back and you&rsquo;ll be like, oh, I&rsquo;m feeling</p>
<p>now like I felt when I was eight and my dad came home and he was a total jerk and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do anything wrong.</p>
<p>And he thought I had, and I was complete powerless.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m in the same situation, my boss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that eight year old in one sense I am, in another sense I&rsquo;m not, but I feel the</p>
<p>same way I did as a kid.</p>
<p>And this is a very useful mechanism in terms of furthering one&rsquo;s happiness because you</p>
<p>kind of deprogram all those things that you picked up as a child.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, you know, if you&rsquo;re feeling something wrong, even though you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to rationalize in a way, you know, it&rsquo;s not abusive because he&rsquo;s not hitting me.</p>
<p>No, the emotion is telling you something real about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So acknowledge it and fix the situation, right?</p>
<p>So one of the powers emotions give you is they send you signals about something that</p>
<p>might not be in cognition yet.</p>
<p>And when you examine their emotion, it brings it to cognition and now you can act on it.</p>
<p>So maybe the boss is abusive, but I didn&rsquo;t really think of it in those terms of my emotions</p>
<p>is sending me signals.</p>
<p>And now that I signal it, I&rsquo;m going to resign.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find a better, another job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to complain to his boss or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take action.</p>
<p>Why do you think Ayn Rand is such a controversial figure?</p>
<p>Last time I spoke with you on this particular podcast, the, the amount of emails I&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>positive and negative and certainly negative, I don&rsquo;t usually get negative emails.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t relate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure mine were all positive or only positive.</p>
<p>It was mostly women sending pictures for me to forward to you because you didn&rsquo;t send</p>
<p>me anything.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s the wrong email address.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I kept bouncing.</p>
<p>Oh, so this is love.</p>
<p>Love hurts.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But why do you think she&rsquo;s such a divisive figure?</p>
<p>Why do you think she provokes such emotion in both the positive and the negative side?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear both of your viewpoints on this.</p>
<p>Well, I think on the negative side and both on the positive and the negative side, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s radical.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s consistently radical.</p>
<p>She upends the, the premises, the ideas that are prevalent in the culture that were brought</p>
<p>up on the, that, that are like, you know, they&rsquo;re like milk and, and, and, you know,</p>
<p>the basic stuff that we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re growing up.</p>
<p>You have to be altruistic.</p>
<p>You have to live for other people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just basic stuff.</p>
<p>Nobody challenges that.</p>
<p>Nobody questions it.</p>
<p>And if they do question it, they usually question it from the perspective of a cynic or a bad</p>
<p>guy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You mentioned the book, the Joker, right.</p>
<p>Before we started, right.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m going to upend the world because I don&rsquo;t care about other people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, so they&rsquo;re presented with these two alternatives and it&rsquo;s real in people&rsquo;s lives, right?</p>
<p>You either live for other people or you&rsquo;re a evil SOB and you know, yeah, most people</p>
<p>in either one of those, but the ethic is right here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s living for other people.</p>
<p>And when you challenge that, they have no way cognitively to go with that.</p>
<p>And the only place they can go with that cognitively is to the Joker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the evil guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the somebody who wants to smash everything and destroy because they don&rsquo;t have this alternative</p>
<p>conception of, oh no, you can be rationally self interested and that does not involve</p>
<p>destruction and that does not involve, you know, just exploiting other people.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t conceptualize that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in their framework.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the fact that she&rsquo;s so consistently on the side of self interest, for example,</p>
<p>on the side of capitalism, on the side of freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that she dismisses faith to the extent that she does or to the extent</p>
<p>that I do, right, that alienates people because that is completely different from what they</p>
<p>brought up.</p>
<p>Now the flip side of that is it&rsquo;s also really interesting to some people.</p>
<p>So you know, a lot of, you got some positives, right?</p>
<p>And I got a lot of positives from that appearance.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people came to my podcast because I appeared on your show.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they hear something that&rsquo;s completely fresh, new, different, they&rsquo;ve never heard</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>It appeals to something in them that maybe, you know, a lot of people say I read Ayn Rand</p>
<p>and it confirmed everything I believed.</p>
<p>Now for me it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was the opposite.</p>
<p>It turned upside down everything I believed, but there are a lot of people out there that</p>
<p>do have a sense that something&rsquo;s wrong in the world, that altruism is wrong, that socialism,</p>
<p>just the stuff and religion is wrong, but they don&rsquo;t have an alternative.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t coalesced.</p>
<p>And they listen to a lot of podcasts because they&rsquo;re trying to get ideas of what is it</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sensing that&rsquo;s wrong out there?</p>
<p>And suddenly somebody comes out and gives them some clear explanation of things and</p>
<p>they go, wow, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been looking for my whole life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the positive for people.</p>
<p>You know, and I read Ayn Rand, it just all made sense.</p>
<p>It all clicked and it all, and it made clear that everything I believed to that point was</p>
<p>just wrong.</p>
<p>It just didn&rsquo;t, it didn&rsquo;t integrate.</p>
<p>And I always knew to some extent it didn&rsquo;t integrate, but there was no alternative, so</p>
<p>I believed it.</p>
<p>What else was there?</p>
<p>I remember saying to myself as a kid, probably 15, why should I, why is this, why is morality</p>
<p>all about other people?</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just the way it is, right?</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t, couldn&rsquo;t come up with an explanation.</p>
<p>She gave me the explanation and she gave me the explanation why it&rsquo;s wrong to do that.</p>
<p>And I think, so I think that&rsquo;s why people respond.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too radical.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t fit into their cognitive framework that they have been brought up on, that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been educated on, that just their whole life revolves around.</p>
<p>Michael, you don&rsquo;t bring up Ayn Rand that much in conversation, except as kind of references</p>
<p>every once in a while as part of the humor of just the general flow in the music of the</p>
<p>way you like to talk.</p>
<p>Well, why do you think you don&rsquo;t integrate her into your philosophy when you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>explaining ideas and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Like, why is she not, you know, a popular reference point for discussion of ideas?</p>
<p>Because I, I don&rsquo;t know if Yaron&rsquo;s going to agree with or can agree with me.</p>
<p>I think for a certain percentage of the population, actually I talked to someone from the Ayn</p>
<p>Rand Institute, I forgot his name, older guy with glasses and he didn&rsquo;t disagree with me.</p>
<p>He said, this is changing.</p>
<p>He said, I think for a certain percentage of the population who are uninformed about</p>
<p>her work, higher than 10%, less than 50%, you mentioned Ayn Rand, they have been trained</p>
<p>to think this is identical Scientology.</p>
<p>So as soon as her name comes up, it&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m out the door.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to have anything to do with this.</p>
<p>And everyone who follows her is a crazy person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing that has happened.</p>
<p>Another thing is Rand in her personality was very aggressive and antagonistic.</p>
<p>She was for a long time, the lone voice in the wilderness being like, this isn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>one of her big adversaries in a certain sense is Milton Friedman.</p>
<p>And she really hated how Milton Friedman was like, oh, you know, having rent control is</p>
<p>inefficient.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, inefficient?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about mass homelessness and people dying.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about this, like what color tie goes with this color shirt?</p>
<p>Are you insane?</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>There was an organization called the Foundation for Economic Education fee.</p>
<p>Leonard Reed was the head of this.</p>
<p>And there were a series of letters and she was helping him.</p>
<p>She was much more philosophically grounded in certain contexts than he was.</p>
<p>And there was an essay, a pamphlet that he published called Roofs or Ceilings.</p>
<p>It was cowritten by Milton Friedman, later Nobel prize winner and George Stigler, also</p>
<p>later Nobel prize winner.</p>
<p>And basically the argument was, well, if the government controls all housing, how&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>going to work out?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s sitting there and she&rsquo;s typing in all caps.</p>
<p>So you know, she&rsquo;s holding on the shift key and doing this on a typewriter and being like</p>
<p>how?</p>
<p>And you can imagine her with her cigarette holder, apoplectic, being like, how is an</p>
<p>organization ostensibly devoted to free enterprise discussing this Stalinist idea in the most</p>
<p>casual of terms?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, have I taught you not?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s amazing is, so at Fee, they only have her letters because she sent them to</p>
<p>Reed.</p>
<p>The Ayn Rand Institute must have Leonard Reed&rsquo;s letters.</p>
<p>I was able to, knowing Rand enough, predict exactly what the conversation would go like</p>
<p>because he also did something she didn&rsquo;t approve of, which is he asked other people for feedback</p>
<p>on her work.</p>
<p>And she goes, I gave this to you to read.</p>
<p>Who are you shopping around to some jerk that I don&rsquo;t, I need their approval.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>So it was a very interesting situation, but so that&rsquo;s one issue.</p>
<p>I remember this is Ayn Rand when she&rsquo;s young.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t that young.</p>
<p>It was in the 40s.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s relatively young, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s before Atlas Shrugged.</p>
<p>It was before Atlas Shrugged.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s before she&rsquo;s super famous.</p>
<p>And before this is, the found has been published, but you know, she&rsquo;s trying to work with others</p>
<p>and they are disappointing her left and right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also when you are a, what she takes away from bad people is you have these kids, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to sit down with them and they&rsquo;re going to be like, yeah, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to take your guns.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lock you in your house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take 60% of your income and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>And they might, up to reading Rand, they might sit down and have a discussion.</p>
<p>And Rand goes, Hey, you know what?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to give them an answer.</p>
<p>You could say, go to hell.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not having this conversation and you have no right to one second of my life.</p>
<p>And this is not a legitimate opener.</p>
<p>This is a declaration of war.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t like, it&rsquo;s not like if I sit down with you, I run like, Hey, Ron, here are my</p>
<p>plans for your wife.</p>
<p>Go to hell.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a conversation we&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m going to make you unsafe in your house.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>This is not a discussion.</p>
<p>So what happens is these people who five minutes ago were able to have a debate with this kid</p>
<p>because people read Rand when they&rsquo;re young often.</p>
<p>And now that kid is like, yeah, I&rsquo;m not even talking to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s her fault.</p>
<p>Whereas in reality, it&rsquo;s that person&rsquo;s fault because that person had no right, although</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been trained to the contrary of our culture to believe, yeah, I&rsquo;m going to sit</p>
<p>down and we&rsquo;re just going to equally have a discussion over your own life.</p>
<p>And you have one vote and I have one vote and we&rsquo;re going to know Lex has a vote and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just how it&rsquo;s going to be and Rand&rsquo;s not having it.</p>
<p>So I think those are two issues.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some other things which, which I don&rsquo;t need to get into.</p>
<p>But I, I, because one of the things that Rand said consisting of her life is that her philosophy</p>
<p>is an integrated whole, right?</p>
<p>So to be an objectivist isn&rsquo;t just like, I like Atlas shrugged.</p>
<p>It means I accept objectivism as a totality.</p>
<p>Since I do not, I don&rsquo;t, I think it is proper to be respectful to her wishes and not constantly</p>
<p>be, especially given that I&rsquo;ve somewhat of a platform to be like Ayn Rand, Ayn Rand,</p>
<p>Ayn Rand, because I don&rsquo;t think Ayn Rand would have liked it if I was talking about Ayn Rand</p>
<p>this much.</p>
<p>So how do you, how do you deprogram?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t like to bring up Ayn Rand just because I do see what, like how people</p>
<p>roll their eyes essentially.</p>
<p>So how do you, what&rsquo;s the upside, exactly.</p>
<p>But what is that pro, can we, can you speak to that programming that people have?</p>
<p>I mean, look, at the end of the day, if you talk about the ideas and the ideas make sense</p>
<p>and people are attracted to the ideas, then you say, oh, by the way, and this came from</p>
<p>Ayn Rand, that&rsquo;s how you deprogram them, right?</p>
<p>If you make the ideas prevalent in the culture, if people start viewing self interest as something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s interesting and worthwhile and something worth investigating, and they</p>
<p>said, oh, that came from Ayn Rand, then I think, I think then we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll deprogram</p>
<p>them and get them and get them changing their minds about these things.</p>
<p>And also, you know, going on shows where people are going to watch your show no matter who</p>
<p>you bring on.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, uh, even though now you do, you, if you put, you put Ayn Rand in the title that immediately</p>
<p>reduces the number of people who watch, so, so in the future you shouldn&rsquo;t, but, uh, you</p>
<p>put Michael Malice in the title and then at least the, the female population, the female</p>
<p>to, you know, absolutely, just to see, but so, so you go and you try to make them as</p>
<p>credible as possible to as many people as possible over time.</p>
<p>It takes time.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I don&rsquo;t think the culture will have this response to her.</p>
<p>They might still disagree with her, but I think over time, and already you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>it, younger people, I think today are far less, there was a generation who never read</p>
<p>Ayn Rand and was like this, bring out the garlic and the crosses.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with it then.</p>
<p>And I think today there are many more people who&rsquo;ve read her and might disagree or not</p>
<p>disagree.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then there were a lot of people who haven&rsquo;t read her, but who are not opposed to it or</p>
<p>willing to have an, to engage.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s changing already.</p>
<p>And I think in 20 years it&rsquo;ll be completely different.</p>
<p>And just two more things that she does that I think it says that I think people find very,</p>
<p>very off putting given our culture.</p>
<p>One is she will, basically you could sit down with Rand and be like, your fear is not in</p>
<p>any way a hold on my freedom.</p>
<p>Just that one sentence.</p>
<p>And for a lot of people that&rsquo;s very off putting and very harsh, it&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>But for them, it&rsquo;s just like, wait a minute, I&rsquo;m still scared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like for example, like with lockdowns and things like this, it&rsquo;s like, well, I&rsquo;m scared</p>
<p>and maybe I have a right to be scared.</p>
<p>Or like, I&rsquo;m scared that you have a gun in your house.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I respect that you&rsquo;re scared.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>At the end, as you say at the end of the day, this is my house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to live my life as I please, as long as I don&rsquo;t hurt other people.</p>
<p>Well, you are hurting me because I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>This is the feeling versus fact.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So that is one situation.</p>
<p>This is like a feeling versus freedom, essentially.</p>
<p>Yes, where Rand is, that puts a lot of people off.</p>
<p>I also think that historically, a lot of people who were drawn to her are drawn to her for</p>
<p>the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>That a lot of times, like Howard Rourke, the hero, we&rsquo;re gonna still say hero.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to say protagonist, but hero.</p>
<p>The hero of the fountainhead, he&rsquo;s extremely intelligent, but he&rsquo;s also extremely uncompromising.</p>
<p>What often ends up happening is you&rsquo;ll have a young kid who is somewhat intelligent, but</p>
<p>then they pick up the personality and now you&rsquo;re someone I can&rsquo;t work with.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not Howard Rourke, relax.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not that skilled.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not that talented.</p>
<p>But because the character has to do personification and have certain aspects together, when kids</p>
<p>read that, they might get the wrong idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not Rand&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, I completely agree with that, but it&rsquo;s even broader than that.</p>
<p>So here is, in my view, one of the geniuses of the millennium presenting a philosophy.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s got not just the questions, in my view, she&rsquo;s got the answers.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re reading them at 16 and you&rsquo;re reading the answers.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know at 16 that this is true.</p>
<p>You might have a sense that it&rsquo;s true, but you don&rsquo;t have the life experience, the learned</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the facts, you don&rsquo;t have the knowledge.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re picking up truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just being absorbed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re accepting it as true, but you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And then you go out into the world advocating for it, which we all did, or at least I did,</p>
<p>when I was 16.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re obnoxious.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t prove what you&rsquo;re arguing for because you don&rsquo;t have the experience.</p>
<p>It took me, I don&rsquo;t know, 10, 20 years, probably 20, to figure out that I really do think what</p>
<p>she said was true, but I didn&rsquo;t know when I was 16.</p>
<p>When I was 16, I just absorbed these ideas and accepted them, in a sense, with some connection</p>
<p>to reality, but in a sense, on faith, at least presented it that way.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, you come off as a detached from reality, obnoxious human being.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of young objectivists are, and it&rsquo;s hard not to be, because you are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re confronted with genius.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not a genius.</p>
<p>I certainly am not a genius.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m confronted with just genius and have all this information in my head now.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t articulate it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to deal with yourself.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an inside joke.</p>
<p>No, you said I&rsquo;m confronted with genius.</p>
<p>I pointed to us.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m confronted with you guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at an age where I know how to deal with geniuses.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>This is not why people don&rsquo;t like her, but there&rsquo;s something that the Fountainhead does,</p>
<p>which I think is very, and I don&rsquo;t blame her, but it&rsquo;s a bad consequence.</p>
<p>If you read the Fountainhead and you&rsquo;re young and you&rsquo;re intelligent and talented, the message</p>
<p>at least I got, and I know I&rsquo;m not alone, is you are going to think that you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be a pariah, that a lot of people are going to be against you, and you&rsquo;re basically doomed</p>
<p>for a short period of being isolated and alone.</p>
<p>And that may have been the case when Fountainhead was written.</p>
<p>But I think now with the internet, and in my experience, both as a youth and someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a little bit older, I didn&rsquo;t appreciate, and you&rsquo;re not going to get it from that book,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t get it through that book because it has to have a certain narrative, how many</p>
<p>people who are a little older are giddy when they find young talent, how inspiring it is,</p>
<p>how exciting it is.</p>
<p>Like when you talk to these kids who are doing things on the internet or writing or whatever</p>
<p>achievement, you want them to flourish.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not threatened by them as the antagonists of the Fountainhead are, and that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come through in the Fountainhead because it depends on your profession, right?</p>
<p>I mean, some of these parts of the world are better than others.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an artist, at least the way I conceive of art, and you want to go study art today,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be pouped and look down on and so on.</p>
<p>So yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I mean, in my generation, when I read Iron Man, there was no internet, and I was in Israel,</p>
<p>so we were isolated, and there was nobody else who had shared their ideas, and you did</p>
<p>feel that kind of isolation.</p>
<p>But Roark gave you, to me, he didn&rsquo;t teach me about you&rsquo;re going to be isolated because</p>
<p>partially because I wasn&rsquo;t, maybe I was humble, right?</p>
<p>When I read Atlas Shrugged, I identified with Eddie Willis.</p>
<p>When I read the Fountainhead, I didn&rsquo;t identify with Howard Roark.</p>
<p>How old were you when you read the Fountainhead?</p>
<p>So I read Atlas when I was 16.</p>
<p>I probably read the Fountainhead when I was 16 and a half, 17, something like that.</p>
<p>That is unfathomable crime.</p>
<p>You read the Fountainhead after Atlas Shrugged?</p>
<p>If anyone listening to this, if you read the Fountainhead after Atlas Shrugged, that is</p>
<p>a war crime.</p>
<p>No, for me, reading Atlas Shrugged was much more important.</p>
<p>It is more important, but my point is, I think the Fountainhead in many ways is redundant</p>
<p>in certain aspects if you read Atlas Shrugged first, and because the Fountainhead is such</p>
<p>a masterful book and such a personal book.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>So ideally, you would read the Fountainhead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, yes.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the other thing people don&rsquo;t appreciate, I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt you.</p>
<p>People think Rand&rsquo;s always about politics, politics, politics, politics, but the Fountainhead</p>
<p>is not a political book at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about, well, she talks about politics in Mansoul, sure.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s about ethics, how important everyone has to have a moral code.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing why people find Rand off putting.</p>
<p>If you have young people who now find it very important to live a moral life, who are like,</p>
<p>what does that mean to have morality, to have ethics, to live with integrity for people</p>
<p>who have gotten a little older, who have made these little sacrifices, who are like, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to fight at work.</p>
<p>Do I really need to look for another job?</p>
<p>Yeah, my wife&rsquo;s kind of getting annoying, but am I going to make a fight about it?</p>
<p>These little sacrifices that they make every day.</p>
<p>And big ones.</p>
<p>And big ones, absolutely.</p>
<p>So when you have someone who&rsquo;s forcing you to look in the mirror and say, those little</p>
<p>sacrifices and big sacrifices you made, you did the wrong thing and you&rsquo;re evading that you betrayed your unconscious.</p>
<p>That to many people, I think, is very threatening.</p>
<p>But this is why so many people say that Ayn Rand is for 14 year old boys.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You grow out of it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason why it appeals to 14 as a little young, but 16, 18.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because those are the ages where we&rsquo;re still open to idealism.</p>
<p>In a positive sense, to beautiful things, to ideals, to seeking perfection, to seeking</p>
<p>a great life.</p>
<p>I think as you grow older, most people become cynical.</p>
<p>They give up on their ideals.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because their ideals were wrong and their ideals failed.</p>
<p>My parents were socialists when they were young.</p>
<p>Those ideas failed.</p>
<p>So where do you go from socialism if your ideals fail?</p>
<p>Cynicism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is horrible.</p>
<p>All adults, almost all adults out there are cynical.</p>
<p>And that is failed idealism.</p>
<p>When they look at the young people, they see their idealism, oh, well, I was idealistic</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t question the idea, well, they&rsquo;re good ideals and they&rsquo;re bad ideals, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right ideals and they&rsquo;re wrong ideals.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they attribute it to youth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a threat to a lot of people, a lot of people who it&rsquo;s too late for.</p>
<p>For some people, it&rsquo;s too late to change their minds.</p>
<p>And they know it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re too invested in the job, in the wife, in the compromises.</p>
<p>In the comfort.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re too invested in the comfort.</p>
<p>Too invested in a compromise, too invested in a comfort.</p>
<p>And they know that they shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>They know they should change.</p>
<p>And these young people are challenging that.</p>
<p>And that is really, really scary for them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they reject it without too much consideration.</p>
<p>One of the things Rand, the working title for Fountainhead was Secondhand Lives.</p>
<p>And Rand had two definitions of selfishness in that book.</p>
<p>One is selfishness in the sense of my life is the most important thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only important thing.</p>
<p>My family would be number two friends.</p>
<p>They certainly are extremely high values, but you can&rsquo;t have these secondary values</p>
<p>without the first value.</p>
<p>But in the context of my life, right?</p>
<p>Because your family might not be a value, right?</p>
<p>You might hate your parents.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The point being selfishness.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other kind of selfishness, which is Peter Keating, one of the villains</p>
<p>of the book, which is he&rsquo;s selfish in that he&rsquo;s greedy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking out for number one, but he has no values.</p>
<p>He has no sense of character.</p>
<p>He just wants to be wealthy.</p>
<p>He wants to have a beautiful wife.</p>
<p>He wants to have a big house.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t tell you because other people have it and he wants to have it more than</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>His sense of reference is other people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s living secondhand.</p>
<p>The problem with that is a lot of young people read Rand and when they start arguing online,</p>
<p>they just start trying to talk like Rand.</p>
<p>Whereas Rand would be like, be original, be an innovator.</p>
<p>If you want to argue for objectivism in Rand&rsquo;s views, take her ideas, articulate them in</p>
<p>your own way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way of showing that you understand what she thinks, but what they end up doing</p>
<p>is just talking like her.</p>
<p>It sounds dated and comical and that&rsquo;s going to be off putting because it&rsquo;s like Rand wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect someone else to sound like Rand.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s her own person.</p>
<p>She of course wouldn&rsquo;t view Keating as selfish in any sense because, or even greedy, greed</p>
<p>is a tricky word.</p>
<p>Well, he was selfish in the old school sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s selfish in the old, but even there, it&rsquo;s not as if he has some passion and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going after passion no matter what, I&rsquo;m going to light, cheat, steal.</p>
<p>His passion is painting and he doesn&rsquo;t pursue his passion.</p>
<p>He pursues what his mother wants him to pursue and he pursues money and he&rsquo;s completely second</p>
<p>handed in the sense that he follows other people&rsquo;s values, not his own.</p>
<p>Can we actually just backtrack and can we define some of these ideas that Ayn Rand</p>
<p>is known for of selfishness, selfishness, egoism, egotism, greed?</p>
<p>Those all, basically all of those words are seen as negative in society and Ayn Rand has</p>
<p>been reclaiming in her work those words.</p>
<p>So can you speak to what they mean?</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s trying to, and Yaron might disagree, I think she&rsquo;s trying to be needlessly provocative</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s off putting and on one hand, maybe you want to be a provocateur because that</p>
<p>gives you people like, what does this woman mean?</p>
<p>On the other hand, many people are going to be viscerally put off.</p>
<p>When Ayn Rand was on Donahue in 1979, he asked her explicitly, define to me the virtue of</p>
<p>selfishness, which is the title of her collection of essays as well.</p>
<p>And she, this is Rand, immediately says, use a different word, self esteem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, it&rsquo;s like, why are you championing this word, which has extremely</p>
<p>negative connotations?</p>
<p>Whereas if you just say, and this is thanks to her and her work, my life matters, my values</p>
<p>matter, I&rsquo;m not going to apologize for that.</p>
<p>That is a lot less off putting than this caricature of Rand, which is I&rsquo;m for, when people hear</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for selfishness, they hear, oh, someone&rsquo;s bleeding out in the corner, but I want to</p>
<p>get a Coke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>She condemned that.</p>
<p>She says, I&rsquo;m against this kind of sociopathy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>But that word selfishness.</p>
<p>If it goes a mistake to be provocative in this one dimension, to go and to stick with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s stuck with this idea of selfishness and so on.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s stuck with this term and it&rsquo;s, I often use terms for provocative effect.</p>
<p>Yes, this is true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a master, you&rsquo;re a scholar of the trolling arts.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>But I think this is one example where the costs outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>And go ahead, Yaron.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m open to that idea, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>When you actually dig deeper into what people object to, they&rsquo;re not objecting to the word.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re objecting to the ideas.</p>
<p>And she addresses this explicitly in The Virtue of Selfishness in the, I think, the introduction.</p>
<p>Wait, hold on.</p>
<p>I got to ask for clarification.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re objecting to the ideas, but when they talk about her, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>talking about her actual ideas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about the caricature.</p>
<p>Well, sure.</p>
<p>But the caricature is a defense mechanism not to have to deal with the ideas, right?</p>
<p>So they create the caricature in order to ignore the ideas and some of them do it consciously.</p>
<p>Like when people like Krugman and others do this, they know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But Krugman is Ellsworth Tewi.</p>
<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s the perfect Ellsworth Tewi.</p>
<p>And he knows Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s read Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>And he knows she&rsquo;s the enemy in some sense.</p>
<p>He knows&hellip;</p>
<p>Check out our episode with Krugman.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s number 90.</p>
<p>It was a great conversation.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t get as many views as me, but what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Well, he got a Nobel Prize, so what you got?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a ticket to heaven.</p>
<p>Sorry, Paul.</p>
<p>Yasser Alford has a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>And Hitler was a Times Man of the Year for a few times.</p>
<p>That really bothers me when people bring that up.</p>
<p>Are you really&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, Time of the Year&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a joke, Michael.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Man of the Year is not representative of good.</p>
<p>It represents the most influential person of that year, and Hitler was.</p>
<p>Wait, what were you upset about?</p>
<p>When people like, well, look at Time Magazine.</p>
<p>They called Hitler Man of the Year.</p>
<p>They were on set.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>They said this is the guy who moved the world the most.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he was Stalin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go out there.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s who they like.</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>The Stalin guy.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even joking.</p>
<p>The attitude of people between Nazism and fascism and communism is stunning.</p>
<p>In my upcoming book, I have all the receipts how the things that they were saying about</p>
<p>Stalin at the time are, if you look back, it&rsquo;s unconscionable, and these people have</p>
<p>had no accountability in the positive direction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even at the time, and we need to get back to the selfishness stuff, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even at the time.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve told this story.</p>
<p>I was in the green room going on John Stossel&rsquo;s show, and I saw a bunch of libertarians in</p>
<p>the green room all hanging out, and this guy walks in, this young guy walks in, and somebody</p>
<p>says to me, he&rsquo;s a communist.</p>
<p>I said, what do you mean?</p>
<p>They said, no, no, he&rsquo;s a card carrying member of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a communist.</p>
<p>I said, and that&rsquo;s okay with you guys?</p>
<p>They go, yeah, yeah, he&rsquo;s a nice guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, this is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Let me quote Rand.</p>
<p>Rand said she would rather talk to a philosophical Marxist, right?</p>
<p>Did she not say this?</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is a communist in the context of 21st century, right?</p>
<p>So I said&hellip;</p>
<p>But not 20th.</p>
<p>Well, in the sense that we know exactly what, we know exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>And this guy has the blood of 100 million people on his hands.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not letting him off the hook.</p>
<p>So I engage with this guy, and literally we get into this&hellip; I&rsquo;m telling him what I think</p>
<p>of his ideas, and therefore what I think of him, and the people from the wardrobe department</p>
<p>come out, and their chairs are put aside in this little gladiator ring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the libertarians are sitting there amused, because to them it&rsquo;s just&hellip; I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to name names, but to them it&rsquo;s just like, yeah, he&rsquo;s a communist, and I said</p>
<p>at some point to them&hellip; I won&rsquo;t name names, because&hellip; I said at some point to them,</p>
<p>if somebody walks into a room and says, I&rsquo;m a Nazi, do you just treat him as, okay, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go hang out and get some drinks?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Because I wrote a book about this, the new write, and I did talk to Nazis, and I went</p>
<p>to North Korea to talk to them.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you were writing a book.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not going to hang out with a Nazi or a communist just like the regular person,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>To me, a Nazi and a communist are the same.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t under&hellip; Okay, please explain this, because first of all, any time you have a</p>
<p>lot of equivocation, I hate that, because I don&rsquo;t like equality.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a bad concept.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all sitting here as Jewish people, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>To say these two things are basically the same, it&rsquo;s a matter of life and death for</p>
<p>all of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be dead under Hitler.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing so hot under Stalin, but we&rsquo;re still alive.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some very big difference.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>One more thing.</p>
<p>So within the context, they&rsquo;re different, right?</p>
<p>Hold on, one more thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also one very big difference in that one has a lot worse of a brand name, and the</p>
<p>other does not, even though the other should.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brand.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I agree.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a context in which I would fear Stalin more than Hitler.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different context in which I would fear Hitler, but as ideologies, they are equally</p>
<p>evil.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Not the same, because the difference is between communism and fascism, but as ideologies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re equally evil.</p>
<p>They both view the individual as insignificant, unimportant, and they both basically want</p>
<p>to kill any independent minded&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re equating communism with Stalinism, so you&rsquo;re equating&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m equating communism&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what Stalinism is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Stalinism is one version of communism, I&rsquo;m sure there are others.</p>
<p>Communism is an evil ideology, no matter who practices it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s&hellip; I think that&rsquo;s too loose, because here&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>The first person who went to the Soviet Union from the left and denounced it was Emma Goldman.</p>
<p>She was an anarcho communist, right?</p>
<p>So she went there, she got deported from the United States.</p>
<p>She went to Lenin to his face.</p>
<p>Hold on, let me finish.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already dismissing what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Your body language, your emotions.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Humility, yeah.</p>
<p>Humility.</p>
<p>History doesn&rsquo;t carry your feelings either.</p>
<p>She goes to Lenin, she goes, we&rsquo;re supposed to be about free speech.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to be about the individual freedom.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>And he goes, free speech is a bourgeois extravagance.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have it during a revolution, too bad.</p>
<p>She comes back to the West.</p>
<p>Wait, he&rsquo;s right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh no, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s more consistent with the idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s more consistent.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a compromise.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Well, she comes back to the West, the big red Emma, the big hero of the left.</p>
<p>And she goes, you guys, this is a complete, not, she didn&rsquo;t say bad.</p>
<p>She was very random.</p>
<p>She goes, this is pure evil.</p>
<p>This is horrifying.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re doing to the workers, which you supposedly care about, completely oppressing.</p>
<p>And when one person described, they go, when she got up to talk, it was a standing ovation.</p>
<p>And when she was finished, you could hear a pin drop because she wasn&rsquo;t some capitalist.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t some bourgeois conservative.</p>
<p>She was as hard left for violent revolution as it gets.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think she, as a communist, is an evil person.</p>
<p>I think she is.</p>
<p>Because if she wasn&rsquo;t evading, and with Rand, and I think in reality, the essence of evil</p>
<p>is evasion, is ignoring the facts of reality, is putting your feelings ahead of your facts.</p>
<p>She would realize that what was going on in the Soviet Union was the inevitable consequence</p>
<p>of her ideas.</p>
<p>That could be just she&rsquo;s dumb.</p>
<p>So she could have changed her mind.</p>
<p>She could have, coming back to the Soviet Union, said, these ideas are wrong.</p>
<p>I now repudiate my ideas, not just of implementation, but my ideas.</p>
<p>And then I would have said, yeah, she had been mistaken before, and now she&rsquo;s confronted</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>But if she stayed a leftist, if she stayed a leftist to that extent, not just a mild leftist,</p>
<p>then I think she&rsquo;s dishonest and therefore immoral.</p>
<p>So ‚Äì</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re using three words identically.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying dishonest, immoral, and evil.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m ‚Äì</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So evil is more ‚Äì is an extreme form of immorality, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>So okay.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s immoral.</p>
<p>The ideology she holds is still evil because the ideology ‚Äì</p>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;s delusional.</p>
<p>She might be delusional.</p>
<p>But delusional and evil are the same.</p>
<p>But she can be delusional.</p>
<p>She cannot be delusional.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m willing to accept a delusion before she&rsquo;s gone to the Soviet Union and seen it.</p>
<p>Once she&rsquo;s gone to see it, I don&rsquo;t think that excuse holds anymore.</p>
<p>I think now she&rsquo;s being confronted and she&rsquo;s lying to herself about the implications of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Logically, it&rsquo;s inevitable that what happens in the Soviet Union has to happen in any communist</p>
<p>context.</p>
<p>So to play a little bit of a devil&rsquo;s advocate here, is it logically inevitable?</p>
<p>Is it ‚Äì can you imagine that there is communist systems where the consequences we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in the 20th century are not the consequences we get?</p>
<p>In future societies, under different conditions, under different ‚Äì with the internet, different</p>
<p>communication schemes, different set of resources.</p>
<p>As long as human beings are what we are.</p>
<p>Now the Borg ‚Äì you remember the Borg from Star Trek or whatever the series was?</p>
<p>Okay, nerd.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean ‚Äì</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a nerd.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The Borg ‚Äì</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the highest of compliments.</p>
<p>The Borg ‚Äì</p>
<p>In this household.</p>
<p>The Borg is the highest of lex.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>The Borg is communist, right?</p>
<p>The Borg is a different species.</p>
<p>It has a different biology.</p>
<p>It has a business ‚Äì different form of consciousness.</p>
<p>Now whether such a being could survive evolution is a question.</p>
<p>Whether such a ‚Äì</p>
<p>People are ants.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to be intelligent.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then the question is can you have free will, human cognitive cognition and be</p>
<p>a Borg?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>But maybe.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Maybe in another planet.</p>
<p>But human beings ‚Äì</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to take DMT to meet the Borg.</p>
<p>So human beings ‚Äì no, communism is anti ‚Äì the reason communism is evil is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anti reality, anti human nature, anti the individual, and therefore it is inherently</p>
<p>evil.</p>
<p>It cannot result in anything good coming out of it.</p>
<p>Only bad can come of it.</p>
<p>Do you think you could have predicted that before the 20th century?</p>
<p>Yes, and plenty of people did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ‚Äì</p>
<p>You know who did?</p>
<p>Mikhail Bakunin.</p>
<p>Mikhail Bakunin, who was an early communist Marxist rival in 18 ‚Äì this is going to be</p>
<p>in my upcoming book ‚Äì in 1860, he sat down and wrote an essay, he goes, what Marx is</p>
<p>advocating is insane.</p>
<p>This is going to be worse than the czar.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about complete totalitarian nightmare.</p>
<p>When you put this into practice, it&rsquo;s going to be something we&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pure horror.</p>
<p>Like, he was a hardcore leftist.</p>
<p>Look, Marx predicted it, right?</p>
<p>We talked about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true too.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Marx at some point says certain people cannot be part of the proletariat and they have to</p>
<p>be liquidated.</p>
<p>So this idea of mass murder and mass killing is not new to communism, it is an inherent</p>
<p>part of what it means.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either proletarian or you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re ‚Äì look, and in Marx, it&rsquo;s in Marx, right?</p>
<p>The individual doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Now he might matter in his utopia because he knows he&rsquo;s got a marketing problem.</p>
<p>See, Marx has a marketing problem because of the fact that you have individuals.</p>
<p>How do you convince individuals to give up their individualism, to give up the individuality?</p>
<p>What you say is, well, we have to go through this difficult process.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We have to get to this utopia.</p>
<p>And in this utopia, I mean, he&rsquo;s very Christian.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the other thing about Marx.</p>
<p>About the end time.</p>
<p>Marx is very Christian in everything, in his morality, in his collectivism, and in the</p>
<p>end time.</p>
<p>The end times for Marx is going back to the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>The end time for Marx is you don&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p>
<p>Food is just available.</p>
<p>Wealth is just available.</p>
<p>You can do your hobbies.</p>
<p>You can do everything.</p>
<p>You can do whatever you want, whatever feelings, whatever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going back to a Garden of Eden perspective on human.</p>
<p>So he knows what that is going to require.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to require this dictatorship of the proletarian to get there.</p>
<p>And he never tells you how we get there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no game plan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dictatorship, then there&rsquo;s utopia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the underpants.</p>
<p>Step one, dictatorship.</p>
<p>Step two, question mark.</p>
<p>Step three, utopia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the question mark is where the action is, right?</p>
<p>Annihilate.</p>
<p>Yeah, you yada yada the important part.</p>
<p>And people buy this garbage, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing of value in Marx.</p>
<p>I mean, let me be very clear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>He gets capitalism wrong.</p>
<p>He gets the proletarian wrong.</p>
<p>He gets the workers wrong.</p>
<p>He gets the labor theory of value is wrong.</p>
<p>There is nothing of value.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing of value in communism.</p>
<p>It is a wrong, unfitted to human nature ideology from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The clarity with which you speak is just not something I, I don&rsquo;t think I have that clarity</p>
<p>about anything.</p>
<p>But I mean, it has to do with that thing that where everybody has something to teach you.</p>
<p>I just feel like I&rsquo;ve been reading Mein Kampf recently, for example, for the first time.</p>
<p>Something to learn from Hitler?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot to learn from Hitler.</p>
<p>About the nature of evil, about wrong ideas, not about anything good, not about anything</p>
<p>positive.</p>
<p>Oh, so yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably a really bad example.</p>
<p>Why is Hitler different than Marx?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>No, I get that.</p>
<p>But in terms of ideas, why is Hitler different than Marx?</p>
<p>Why do we have to assume there&rsquo;s something to learn from Marx, but there&rsquo;s nothing, but</p>
<p>we acknowledge that there&rsquo;s nothing positive to learn from Hitler.</p>
<p>Because I mean, all right.</p>
<p>I can tell you something, in the sense that like, there&rsquo;s an interesting question is,</p>
<p>how did this person get from step A to being able to implement the ideas?</p>
<p>I know, everybody should read, anybody who&rsquo;s interested should read Marx, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important in the history and a lot of people were influenced by it.</p>
<p>Why was it influential?</p>
<p>What is it that he says that appeals to people?</p>
<p>I find it interesting to see all the parallels with Christianity.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why to a large extent it appeals to people because they got to give up the</p>
<p>unimportant part of religion and got to keep the fun parts of religion, the important parts</p>
<p>to them of religion, the morality, for example.</p>
<p>But no, there&rsquo;s not something positive to learn from everybody.</p>
<p>In Ayn Rand&rsquo;s view, in your view, who was worse, Stalin or Hitler?</p>
<p>I think worse is, this is something that I&rsquo;ll do a Randian sin and be evasive.</p>
<p>It really drives me crazy when people sit down and have these competitions about like,</p>
<p>if someone who&rsquo;s Jewish brings up the Holocaust and someone who&rsquo;s African American brings</p>
<p>up slavery, and this is a conversation that I think is pointless and very hurtful and</p>
<p>harmful and it is really silly and ridiculous.</p>
<p>So it might make sense in some kind of stoner context about like you&rsquo;re doing the math and</p>
<p>trying to figure out, but it&rsquo;s like, and yeah, you could be like, what would you rather have</p>
<p>like this kind of cancer or full blown AIDS?</p>
<p>In short, I mean, there&rsquo;s gotta be life expectancy, but these are such, I&rsquo;ll evade your question,</p>
<p>reframe it.</p>
<p>I think we understand, and a lot of this is a function of the propaganda at the time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not using the word propaganda in a negative sense, the horrors of Hitler and</p>
<p>Nazism.</p>
<p>I think, and one of the things I&rsquo;m trying to solve with my upcoming book, there is a</p>
<p>very poor understanding about the horrors of Stalinism and what that meant in practice.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I wrote Dear Reader, my North Korea book, and what I was shocked and</p>
<p>delighted by when I started writing Dear Reader, I thought to myself, look, I have very little</p>
<p>capacity to affect change, but I can tell stories.</p>
<p>I can write books.</p>
<p>This is my competency.</p>
<p>If I move the needle in America, we got it pretty good here.</p>
<p>If I move the needle in North Korea, this could have really profound positive consequences.</p>
<p>I set a very limited goal, and that goal is to change the conversation about North Korea,</p>
<p>to stop it being regarded as a laughing stock and start regarding it as an existential horror.</p>
<p>The metaphor I use always, and we brought up earlier, was the Joker, because people</p>
<p>look at Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il, his father, they look at a clown disguised as a buffoon,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s valid, and I said, this is what I can do.</p>
<p>I can move that camera a little bit, and now that camera, instead of looking at Kim Jong</p>
<p>Un, Kim Jong Il, you see behind him literally millions of corpses, and when you see people</p>
<p>putting on these performances in these shows, look at these fools, then you&rsquo;re like, everyone</p>
<p>those people, their kid has a gun to their head right now.</p>
<p>If someone puts a gun to your kid&rsquo;s head, you&rsquo;re going to put on clown makeup?</p>
<p>Yeah, you are.</p>
<p>What color?</p>
<p>Put on the shoes, whatever you want.</p>
<p>So in terms of, people do not appreciate the horrors of Stalinism.</p>
<p>I think this is a big fault of the right wing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect necessarily the New York Times to do this because of the blood on their</p>
<p>hands, and for a long time, I was berating conservatives, I go, this was the big right</p>
<p>wing victory, bloodless largely, the victory of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s talking about it, no one&rsquo;s informing, and let&rsquo;s be clear, there are very many people</p>
<p>who are Democrats who are on the left, who are violently opposed, literally violently</p>
<p>opposed to the Soviet Union, it&rsquo;s horrors, this is not necessarily a partisan issue.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, all right, I&rsquo;m going to do something about it.</p>
<p>So I know that&rsquo;s not really literally your question, but you know, that&rsquo;s kind of information</p>
<p>that feeds us.</p>
<p>Let me ask you that question if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So what, which do we, can we learn more from, from a historical perspective looking forward?</p>
<p>From like, which has more lessons in, in how to avoid it, how to, and just general lessons</p>
<p>about human nature.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I agree with Michael that it&rsquo;s not important who&rsquo;s more evil because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>both evil and they&rsquo;re both just so evil that the differences don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is what is the ideology?</p>
<p>What is the, what is, what are the consequences?</p>
<p>What do we understand from it?</p>
<p>What are we worried about?</p>
<p>What are we going to avoid?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not worried about Nazism qua Nazism because everybody hates Nazism.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s uniform that that&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>Even the people I think on the far right in America are staying away from the cliches</p>
<p>of Nazism, although some of them are stupid enough not to.</p>
<p>But, but in the end, if, if, if the United States goes authoritarian right, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be Nazism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be some other form of fascism because that is so obviously, you know, being understood</p>
<p>as evil and bad that there&rsquo;s almost no understanding that the evil of communism, I mean, you brought</p>
<p>it up earlier, right?</p>
<p>Almost nobody understands that communism is an evil ideology, that there&rsquo;s, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing worthwhile there, that any, any attempt to go in that direction in any sustainable</p>
<p>way is destructive.</p>
<p>They are, as you mentioned, they&rsquo;re economists out there claiming they are communists.</p>
<p>I mean, I find that despicable that anybody would claim to be a communist economist or</p>
<p>communist anything, because I think that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a ideology that has</p>
<p>no basis, but we haven&rsquo;t learned that.</p>
<p>So to me, communism is the much bigger threat because we still think it&rsquo;s some kind of beautiful</p>
<p>ideal in, in the world around us.</p>
<p>I think Nazism is out, but I think, I think fascism is a, is a massive threat out there</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve learned real lessons of, nobody knows what fascism is.</p>
<p>Everybody thinks fascism is Nazism.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t recognize that in a sense we are already fascist and that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>certainly heading in that direction.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>And again, we haven&rsquo;t studied, and the real lesson here is we haven&rsquo;t studied what unifies</p>
<p>them both because there&rsquo;s not a big difference between fascism and communism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no big difference between Nazism and communism.</p>
<p>What does unify them?</p>
<p>What unifies them is the common good, the public interest.</p>
<p>What unifies them is this idea that there is some elite group of people who can run</p>
<p>our lives for us, for the common good, for the public interest.</p>
<p>And that you don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You as an individual, you individual don&rsquo;t matter and they, they will dictate how you</p>
<p>live.</p>
<p>And you know, so these are philosopher kings.</p>
<p>It goes back to Plato&rsquo;s philosophy, but it really unifies it.</p>
<p>Think about communism, communism is about the sacrifice of the individual to the proletarian.</p>
<p>Who is the proletarian?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this collective group here.</p>
<p>Who represents a proletarian?</p>
<p>Well they have, somebody has to, somebody has to tell the proletarian what they believe</p>
<p>in because they don&rsquo;t know, because there is no collective consciousness.</p>
<p>So you need a Stalin and this is the point about Marxism.</p>
<p>Marxism needs a dictator because somebody has to represent the values, the public interest,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for the public.</p>
<p>Nazism needs the same thing.</p>
<p>Just Nazism replace proletarian with Aryans, the Aryan race.</p>
<p>And you have exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>You need a dictator to tell us what&rsquo;s good for the Aryan people so we can do what&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for the Aryan people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s impossible to have a communist system or a fascist system without a dictator naturally</p>
<p>emerging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not possible to have a George.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not naturally, it&rsquo;s ideologically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely impossible to have that on scale.</p>
<p>You can certainly have communes where people behave communistically.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not inside the ideology.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Let me talk about fascism because fascism definitionally is going to have a strong man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how it could be fascism without that.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk, what you said earlier on is about how people don&rsquo;t know what fascism is.</p>
<p>Fascists don&rsquo;t know what fascism is.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a superb book by John Diggins from the early seventies called Mussolini and Fascism,</p>
<p>the view from America.</p>
<p>So I find Mussolini to be a far more interesting figure than Hitler because he had a much more</p>
<p>nuanced career.</p>
<p>He was much more of an innovator.</p>
<p>He was an intellectual.</p>
<p>Which is shocking because he always comes across as a buffoon, but he was actually a</p>
<p>thinker.</p>
<p>Why did he not resist Hitler at all?</p>
<p>So one of the things with fascism is it comes, it&rsquo;s a direct line from Kant to Mussolini.</p>
<p>So basically there is a philosopher who I adore, who I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t, called Schopenhauer.</p>
<p>And Schopenhauer, the question became, Rand was not a particularly humorous person.</p>
<p>She had some moments of wit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great moment when she was on Tom Snyder show in 1980, I believe, and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talking about Kant and she goes, Immanuel Kant and all his illegitimate children, if</p>
<p>you catch my meaning, she mean all his bastards.</p>
<p>But the host Tom Snyder did not pick up on it.</p>
<p>If you watch it on YouTube, you could pick up on it.</p>
<p>And what happened was once Kant bifurcated reality into the phenomenal world, the pure</p>
<p>idea world and the numeral world, the question became, well, what is the nature of this world</p>
<p>of ideas?</p>
<p>And Hegel had it meant reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know even know what that means theoretically, that the world of reason is idea and this</p>
<p>is Schopenhauer who hated Hegel, who constantly attacked him by name and Hegel&rsquo;s followers</p>
<p>in his work.</p>
<p>He was a very big innovator in a malevolent way because he said the nature of reality,</p>
<p>this idea is will, meaning the universe doesn&rsquo;t care about you and it&rsquo;s constantly in this</p>
<p>reality putting urges in your mind, values.</p>
<p>And when you denounce these values and urges, that&rsquo;s the basis of morality.</p>
<p>And from there it went to Nietzsche and the will isn&rsquo;t mindless, it is a will to power.</p>
<p>Mussolini took this and basically said, because the will to power is the real reality, the</p>
<p>Kantian idea, therefore all of this is secondary.</p>
<p>So if we will it, we can make it happen.</p>
<p>When you have this concept of my willpower is stronger than reality and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, how&rsquo;s this program going to work?</p>
<p>We can make it happen.</p>
<p>That was why fascism is not a very coherent ideology because explicitly, there&rsquo;s a book</p>
<p>called from 1936 called The Philosophy of Fascism, which tried to codify this, 36, this</p>
<p>is a long time ago, where they&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re against reason and explicitly rationality.</p>
<p>We are for willpower, for strength, and if you are strong enough and united enough, you</p>
<p>can force these things to work.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot that is not taught about this ideology.</p>
<p>I highly recommend people read the books from the time.</p>
<p>And what was fascinating about Mussolini is he was regarded as the moderate.</p>
<p>Because the 1930s, you had the Great Depression, all the intellectuals said, this proves capitalism</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t work, the Great Depression, obviously, air quotes, is capitalism&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Then you have the alternative, the USSR.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not tenable for us.</p>
<p>Here comes Mussolini and Mussolini says, I&rsquo;m going to take the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>I have aspects of markets, capitalism, but I don&rsquo;t have this chaos, but I also don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have complete government control of the bureaucrats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have this combination.</p>
<p>And there was a Broadway song, You&rsquo;re the Top, you&rsquo;re Mussolini.</p>
<p>That was later edited out because that&rsquo;s when he took a bad turn.</p>
<p>But this is kind of the fascist idea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about power and it&rsquo;s about control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the essence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about will.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Fascists don&rsquo;t care who owns stuff, owns in quotes, because what&rsquo;s important is who controls</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So you can own your home, but if I get to tell you when you can sell it, for how much</p>
<p>you can sell it and what you can do on that home, then I&rsquo;m in control of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the essence of fascism.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, we live today in a much more fascist economic context than</p>
<p>anything else.</p>
<p>We pretend that corporations are private, but when everything they do is regulated,</p>
<p>who they can hire, how much they pay them, when and how they can fire them, what they</p>
<p>can do in their property, it&rsquo;s all control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way fascists start controlling everything.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not possible to have checks on power and balance of power at the top of fascism</p>
<p>or communist systems.</p>
<p>The question was whether in fascist systems or communist systems, we&rsquo;re saying the dictator</p>
<p>naturally or must emerge.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say emerge, the dictator is the one who makes the fascist system.</p>
<p>Yeah, fascism, well, it could emerge because for example, I think today in America we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>moving much more towards fascism or socialism, and at some point that&rsquo;ll manifest itself</p>
<p>in some kind of dictator.</p>
<p>And the dictator might be different than a Mussolini or Nazis, it might be couched in</p>
<p>some kind of pseudo constitutional American presence.</p>
<p>It would be a lot easier for a female to be a fascist dictator in America than a male,</p>
<p>because do you have that softness?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not gonna come off as a strong woman, people won&rsquo;t see it coming, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a nationalist, religionist, environmentalist, I think somebody who can</p>
<p>combine those three.</p>
<p>Well, Hitler did those, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And somebody who can combine those three and articulate the case for it, I think America</p>
<p>is ready for it.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s possible for fascism to arise in the world again?</p>
<p>Oh, of course, it had never went away, they just adopt the name.</p>
<p>Because the fundamental ideas, the Kantian ideas, the ideas that are behind fascism never</p>
<p>went away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still as popular, if anything, more popular than they were back then, Marx is</p>
<p>as popular.</p>
<p>I think these ideas are prevalent, they&rsquo;re out there, and absolutely, I think America</p>
<p>is ready for them.</p>
<p>Again, it won&rsquo;t be quite in the form that we&rsquo;ve experienced in the past, it&rsquo;ll be in</p>
<p>a uniquely American form, couched at a flag, and of course, it was couched at a flag before.</p>
<p>But no, yes, an authoritarian, some form of authoritarianism is necessary, because the</p>
<p>fundamental principle behind both communism and fascism is the unimportance of the individual.</p>
<p>The individual is nothing, the individual is a nobody, and the importance of the collective.</p>
<p>The collective will, the collective soul, the collective consciousness, but the collective</p>
<p>has no will, has no soul, has no consciousness.</p>
<p>So somebody has to emerge to speak for the collective, otherwise, everything falls apart.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s necessary, whether it&rsquo;s a committee or whether it&rsquo;s one person, how exactly, somebody</p>
<p>has to speak for the collective.</p>
<p>Even a committee doesn&rsquo;t function as a committee, right?</p>
<p>Most committees, particularly when the committee is about dictating how people should live,</p>
<p>somebody is going to, because now it becomes really, really important, somebody is going</p>
<p>to dominate that committee and rule over it, because you don&rsquo;t want independent sources,</p>
<p>independent voices, because the individual doesn&rsquo;t matter, the individual doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a natural hierarchical, so you have seven people that ostensibly have the same role,</p>
<p>someone is going to emerge as a leader naturally, and some people are going to follow.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the same reason you cannot have the Richard Wolff type socialism of, and this</p>
<p>is the more, if you will, innocent part of his ideas.</p>
<p>Oh, why can&rsquo;t we have corporations all be worker owned, and everybody votes on everything,</p>
<p>and we vote on who should be CEO, and no, communism, fascism, most ideas necessitate</p>
<p>ultimately authoritarians, and that&rsquo;s most of human history.</p>
<p>We forget again.</p>
<p>This idea of liberty, this idea of freedom, even the limited freedom we have today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a recent invention.</p>
<p>It happens in little pockets throughout history.</p>
<p>We had a little bit of this democracy stuff, partial, only a few, some people got to vote</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t rights respecting, because they didn&rsquo;t have the concept of rights in Athens,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You had it in a few Greek cities.</p>
<p>We maybe had a version of it in Venice, we had a version of it in city states around</p>
<p>the world, but then it was invented by the founding fathers in this country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes the founding of America so important, and so different, and such a</p>
<p>radical thing to have happened historically.</p>
<p>Freedom is rare.</p>
<p>Authoritarianism is common.</p>
<p>So I was looking at some statistics that 53% of people in the world live under authoritarian</p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>Only 53.</p>
<p>Oh, because India is democratic, so I guess they don&rsquo;t count India, but yes, it used to</p>
<p>be 100.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do we change that?</p>
<p>And even the authoritarianism in a country like China is a lot less than it used to be</p>
<p>under Mao, right?</p>
<p>So they were better off than they were under Mao.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a reality.</p>
<p>How do we change it?</p>
<p>We have to declare, we have to change the ethical views of people.</p>
<p>This brings us back to selfishness, because as long as the standard of morality is the</p>
<p>group, others, as long as the standard of value is what other people want, what other</p>
<p>people think, as long as you are alive only to be sacrificed to the group, that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you have to challenge Christianity.</p>
<p>As long as the Jesus on a cross dying for other people&rsquo;s sin is viewed as this noble,</p>
<p>wonderful act instead of one of the most unjust things to ever happen to anybody, as long</p>
<p>as the common good and the public interest are the standards by which we evaluate things,</p>
<p>we will always drift towards fascism, some form of authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Can I answer your question?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something that has to go along with what Yaron was saying, and I know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to agree with me, which is technology.</p>
<p>Because if it becomes harder technologically for the authoritarian and more expensive for</p>
<p>him to input or force his edicts, that is going to create a pocket of freedom regardless</p>
<p>of what the masses think.</p>
<p>And the masses, hold on let me finish, the masses as a rule are not going to be able</p>
<p>to think in general anyway.</p>
<p>I have a much more elitist view of mankind than Rand does.</p>
<p>And let me give you one specific example, which I mentioned in my book that you write.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose it&rsquo;s 1990, not that long ago, we all remember 1990.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re having an argument about censorship.</p>
<p>And Yaron says, I want full freedom of the press, freedom of books, publish whatever</p>
<p>you want, whatever, free speech.</p>
<p>And I say, well, what about books like Mein Kampf?</p>
<p>What about, you know, people read this the wrong idea?</p>
<p>What about child pornography, things like this?</p>
<p>Like, where are you going to draw the line?</p>
<p>And we could argue along, Lex appears from the future, and he goes, hey, guys, this conversation</p>
<p>is moot.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, Lex, you look exactly the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, of course, Robo Stone Age.</p>
<p>And you go, I&rsquo;m from the future.</p>
<p>And I go, wait a minute, black president?</p>
<p>And you go, look, this conversation is moot, because in a few years from now, you will</p>
<p>be able to send any book anywhere on earth at the speed of light.</p>
<p>You can make infinite copies in one second.</p>
<p>And you could send it to anyone such that they can only open this book if they know</p>
<p>a magic word.</p>
<p>And I go, well, how much is this going to cost?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>And I go, wait, wait, you&rsquo;re telling me I can make infinite copies of any book and teleport</p>
<p>them at the speed of light anywhere for free?</p>
<p>And you would say, yes, we would think he&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the status quo, right?</p>
<p>So technology has done far more to fight government censorship of literature and ideas than has</p>
<p>spreading the right ideas.</p>
<p>So when you have things like crypto, which makes money less accessible than a gold block</p>
<p>in your house, when you have things like people being able to travel quickly, those are also</p>
<p>necessary compliments to having the right ideas.</p>
<p>And Rand herself said that she couldn&rsquo;t have come up with her philosophy before the Industrial</p>
<p>Revolution.</p>
<p>So as time goes forward and we have more technology and we have more discourse.</p>
<p>But for very different reasons, she said that, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a lot easier to persuade people the right ideas.</p>
<p>So I kind of agree.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m more pessimistic or maybe I don&rsquo;t get the technology completely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a boomer.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Okay, boomer.</p>
<p>I get that insult a lot.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m the last year of the boomer generation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mindset.</p>
<p>I think I hit that last.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mindset.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I love you so much.</p>
<p>So the reason she said she couldn&rsquo;t have developed her, the reason she said she couldn&rsquo;t develop</p>
<p>the philosophy without the Industrial Revolution is the link between reason and wealth was not</p>
<p>obvious before the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>And that, for example, it&rsquo;s not obvious to Aristotle.</p>
<p>Aristotle doesn&rsquo;t see the link between rationality and wealth creation.</p>
<p>Business is low.</p>
<p>And money is barren, interest has no productive function, bankers don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So you had to see it existentially to be able to see reason is the source of wealth creation.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a little different.</p>
<p>Now, there is a sense in which, yes, technology makes it more difficult for authoritarians</p>
<p>to achieve their authoritarianism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced that they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At a certain point, because they can turn off the electricity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying it becomes more expensive.</p>
<p>It becomes more expensive, no question.</p>
<p>It becomes more expensive.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still beings that live in a physical reality, therefore, they can still harm us</p>
<p>in this physical reality.</p>
<p>But let me say this, it&rsquo;s going to sound as absurd.</p>
<p>If there was technology that we could teleport anywhere on Earth at the speed of light, that</p>
<p>would certainly go a long way towards hurting authoritarianism.</p>
<p>If there was some way to go, and of course, they could teleport too.</p>
<p>And this is, of course, the danger of they can use the technology too, and look at what</p>
<p>the Chinese are doing with social scores and with monitoring people and cameras everywhere.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense in which you probably had more privacy before some of this technology.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not obvious to me.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s all about ideas.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t get the ideas right, technology will be used for evil, yes, and it will allow</p>
<p>some of us maybe to escape for a little while in some realms, but others not.</p>
<p>You know, Iran and North Korea do a pretty good job shutting themselves away from technology,</p>
<p>although a lot gets through in the Iranian, at least with Iran.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about North Korea, how much gets through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really undermining them, which is wonderful.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is great.</p>
<p>So yes, but it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>And this is what leads me to be optimistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we live in a world today where 7 billion people basically have access to all</p>
<p>of human knowledge, all of human knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like in Rome.</p>
<p>When Rome fell, all of human knowledge disappeared.</p>
<p>Now some of it escaped to Byzantine, some of the Byzantines had and ultimately land</p>
<p>up with the Arabs and found its way back into Western civilization through them.</p>
<p>But a lot of knowledge disappeared, just wiped out, right?</p>
<p>How to build a dome, how to build a big dome, how to have&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, in Pompeii, they had faucets, running water and faucets.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have faucets for another thousand years, right?</p>
<p>A lot of&hellip;</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t build tall buildings once Rome came down.</p>
<p>The Great Pyramid of Egypt was the tallest building on earth till like 1840, it was crazy.</p>
<p>Rome was a city of a million people.</p>
<p>Other than China, there wasn&rsquo;t another city of a million people in the West until London</p>
<p>in the 19th century, 1500 years later.</p>
<p>So it all disappeared because all of it was concentrated basically in one place.</p>
<p>Today none of that exists because of the internet, because of universities everywhere, institutions.</p>
<p>I mean, think about how many engineers there are in the world today, right?</p>
<p>Who have basically all different&hellip;</p>
<p>Basically the same level of knowledge on how to build stuff.</p>
<p>So even if the United States went to some kind of dark ages, it&rsquo;s unlikely the whole</p>
<p>world goes into that kind of dark ages.</p>
<p>So I am optimistic in that sense that the fusion of knowledge is so broad today that</p>
<p>other than wiping out all electricity on the planet, everything electronic on the planet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not going to be possible to control us all.</p>
<p>And in that sense, technology is going to make it possible for us to survive and to</p>
<p>stay semi free, because I don&rsquo;t think full freedom, but semi free.</p>
<p>Because full freedom, you need the ideas.</p>
<p>Because full freedom means you need some political implementation.</p>
<p>No, full freedom means anarchy, but we know that.</p>
<p>So we need to get into that because we can&rsquo;t leave without pointing out that we fundamentally</p>
<p>disagree about that.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s beautiful to be continued on that one.</p>
<p>Let me ask about one particular technology that I&rsquo;ve been learning a lot about, thinking</p>
<p>a lot about, talking about, which is Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, but Bitcoin</p>
<p>specifically, which a lot of people argue that the Bitcoin, that setting ideas aside,</p>
<p>when you look at practical tools that governments use to manipulate its people is inflation</p>
<p>of the monetary system, within the monetary system.</p>
<p>And so they see Bitcoin as a way for the, for individuals to fight that, to go outside</p>
<p>those specific government control systems and thereby sort of decentralizing power.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a case to be made historically of the 20th century that you couldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>Stalin, you couldn&rsquo;t have Hitler, you couldn&rsquo;t have much of the evil that you see in the</p>
<p>world if they couldn&rsquo;t control the monetary system.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t have had the New Deal.</p>
<p>And FDR realized this very quickly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they confiscated all the gold.</p>
<p>Everybody knows FDR is going to come in to become president and confiscate the gold.</p>
<p>So one of the mythologies, the myths about the Great Depression is that there were all</p>
<p>these bank runs that, well, bank runs happened because everybody was afraid that FDR would</p>
<p>get elected to confiscate the gold.</p>
<p>So everybody ran to the bank and took the gold.</p>
<p>Little did they realize that he would confiscate their private holdings in their own backyards.</p>
<p>He would force them to dig up the gold from their own backyards.</p>
<p>But yes, one of the first things FDR did in spite of denying it throughout the campaign,</p>
<p>right, he was asked about this over and over again and denied it.</p>
<p>One of the first things was take over the gold and take the United States Federal Reserve</p>
<p>off the gold standard so that they can, in a sense, print money and that he could start</p>
<p>spending.</p>
<p>Yeah, what people don&rsquo;t realize, just to clarify what Yaron said, is FDR, this is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so crazy to us that we think, okay, I&rsquo;m misunderstanding it.</p>
<p>FDR made it illegal for people to own gold unless it&rsquo;s like a wedding ring.</p>
<p>And before that, contracts, because inflation was a concern, I make a contract with Yaron,</p>
<p>right, I said, okay, you&rsquo;re either going to pay me in $1,500 for my work or the gold</p>
<p>equivalent because if that $1,500, you know, weimar Germany and you have hyperinflation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that $1,500.</p>
<p>Just give me the gold bullion.</p>
<p>And FDR said all of those clauses, he broke every contract, they don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So now if I say, Yaron says, okay, you owe me three feet of drywall.</p>
<p>And I go, here&rsquo;s three feet of drywall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 12 inches.</p>
<p>And you go, wait, wait, wait, three feet is 36 inches.</p>
<p>I go, no, no, not anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>And because you have, when you print more money, the value of every individual dollar</p>
<p>matters less, it becomes that much harder to plan anything, either in the government</p>
<p>level or in the private level, because if I&rsquo;m managing outlays, if I&rsquo;m trying to pay</p>
<p>my workers, I&rsquo;m trying to build factories, I&rsquo;m thinking long term, and I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>this dollar is going to buy in 10 years, that puts an enormous incentive for me to spend</p>
<p>it now and not save it, because if I save it, it&rsquo;s going to be worth a lot less.</p>
<p>And the worst thing about inflation, and this is something I think people who are pro capitalism</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk about enough, they do talk about it, I would just like to see it more.</p>
<p>This by far hurts the poor, the poorest of the poor the most.</p>
<p>When we came to this country, my mom told me they would go to 86th street in Bensonhurst</p>
<p>with the fruit stands to buy Mika Chika, some grapes.</p>
<p>And you go to this fruit stand, and she&rsquo;d walk all the way to the other corner.</p>
<p>And if it was three cents more a pound, or less a pound, she&rsquo;d walk all the way back,</p>
<p>because that three cents mattered.</p>
<p>Now if I have this dollar, and it&rsquo;s 5% inflation or whatever, and next year it&rsquo;s 95 cents,</p>
<p>me and you, the three of us might not care, but if I&rsquo;m destitute hand to mouth, and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got 5% less, that is really a material consequence of my life.</p>
<p>So inflation really is evil, because it hurts the people for who those pennies matter.</p>
<p>Well, one of the ways the government gets around that, and it&rsquo;s because they get smart</p>
<p>to that, is they index everything, so they index your social security, they index welfare,</p>
<p>they try to make sure, but that only makes you more dependent on them.</p>
<p>And the people in the modern context that inflation hurts the most are savers, people</p>
<p>trying to save money.</p>
<p>And Fed policy right now is just horrific if you&rsquo;re a saver, because the Fed, the interest</p>
<p>rates are zero, you get nothing on your saving, and cost of living is going up, maybe not</p>
<p>at a huge level, but it is going up, and yet you can&rsquo;t even save to keep the value of your</p>
<p>dollars.</p>
<p>And the government controls, and this has massive perverse effects, because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just that prices go up, it&rsquo;s that prices don&rsquo;t reflect reality anymore.</p>
<p>So some prices go up, some prices might not.</p>
<p>Investments get distorted, things get produced that shouldn&rsquo;t get produced, and then people</p>
<p>like Richard Wolff turn around and blame all the distortions, and the perversions, and</p>
<p>the crashes, and the financial crisis on capitalism.</p>
<p>Not on the fact that the Fed, look at the financial crisis, financial crisis was caused,</p>
<p>you could argue by inflation, and we could get into that if you wanted, but that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>a three hour show, just that, right?</p>
<p>It was caused by the Federal Reserve, and yet who got blamed for the financial crisis?</p>
<p>Who would Richard Wolff is going to jump up and down?</p>
<p>This is a crisis of capitalism, this was caused by capitalism, but capitalism is the negation</p>
<p>of the Fed.</p>
<p>Capitalism says there should be no Fed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s item number one on the list of the things capitalists want, is to get rid of</p>
<p>the Fed, and then grant you guys your wish, have competition for currency, and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>if Bitcoin wins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>My point is under freedom.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who wins, I just want free choices, and let the best currency win.</p>
<p>I doubt that becomes Bitcoin, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wrong, great.</p>
<p>Let me add to this, and I think people appreciate, and this is a leftist, leftism at its best,</p>
<p>that the government and the banks are in bed with each other.</p>
<p>This I don&rsquo;t think is a particularly controversial statement.</p>
<p>Well I don&rsquo;t like that statement, let me just say why I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it because it assumes that they&rsquo;re equal partners, or that there&rsquo;s causality</p>
<p>goes in both directions.</p>
<p>From day one, and this is really from day one of the establishment of the United States,</p>
<p>banks have been regulated by the state, and the reason for that is primarily Jefferson</p>
<p>and others, founders, distrust of finance.</p>
<p>So from the beginning, banks have been controlled by the state.</p>
<p>Now over time, if I&rsquo;m controlling you, you won&rsquo;t have influence over me, because I get</p>
<p>to, so yes, they get into bed over time, so I don&rsquo;t like it that they&rsquo;re in bed together.</p>
<p>One is dominating over the other, and the other is participating, because what choice</p>
<p>do they have?</p>
<p>I should explain to you how things work when you get in bed, and it&rsquo;s not always equal.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about safe words, which is very Randian topic, she doesn&rsquo;t like those.</p>
<p>I had to read that scene three times in the Fountainhead, because I couldn&rsquo;t believe what</p>
<p>I was reading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you did.</p>
<p>No, because I looked at the back cover, I&rsquo;m like, a woman wrote this book in 1943, I</p>
<p>must be misunderstanding the scene.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s 43.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She sure had a lot of shades of gray.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, no, she hated that.</p>
<p>She hated that.</p>
<p>Only black and white.</p>
<p>No, but what I meant is, 2008, you have the bailout of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Whereas in 2020, we saw every medium and small business under the sun go under, there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even a pretense that these are going to be bailed out.</p>
<p>So the priorities of the politicians, in my view, are always going to be towards powerful</p>
<p>entities, powerful corporations, and they&rsquo;re not going to be about the medium guy, the</p>
<p>middle guy.</p>
<p>Let me just finish my point, because I see you champing at the bit.</p>
<p>At the very least, if you have regulation, people influencing each other.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin, and with crypto, that is not a possibility.</p>
<p>You do not have any agency who is king of Bitcoin, who is the Federal Reserve of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There is no organizing organization or management team.</p>
<p>Now, you could say this is a bad thing, but you can&rsquo;t say that this is a different thing</p>
<p>to money as opposed to Federal Reserve system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I agree with that description of Bitcoin, my problems with Bitcoin, elsewhere.</p>
<p>Let me just say about the financial crisis, I don&rsquo;t like it phrased that way again.</p>
<p>They let Lehman go under and destroyed Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>In the past, they destroyed Drexel Burnham because they didn&rsquo;t like Michael Malkin.</p>
<p>They are vindictive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an accident that the Treasury Secretary at the time was an ex chairman of Goldman</p>
<p>Sachs, not Lehman Brothers, and Goldman hates Lehman.</p>
<p>The next day, they bail out AIG.</p>
<p>What I got out of financial crisis more than anything, and by the way, there wasn&rsquo;t a bailout,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even a bailout, because they gave money to every bank, whether they had problems</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And indeed, I know several bankers, including big banks, like JP Morgan and Wes Falgo, and</p>
<p>a friend of mine, John Allison of BB&amp;T, who told them explicitly, we don&rsquo;t want your money,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need your money, and they were basically, a gun was put to their head and they said,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t take the money, we&rsquo;ll shut you down, basically, the equivalent of that.</p>
<p>So they, A, wanted a virtue signal, so there&rsquo;s a big virtue signal, we&rsquo;re taking care of</p>
<p>things, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ve got everything under control, even though they were completely</p>
<p>panicking and they had no clue what they were doing.</p>
<p>One of the things that the financial crisis really illustrated was how pathetic, ignorant,</p>
<p>and incompetent the people at the top are, and they knew it.</p>
<p>And they, you know, Sir Paulson goes to Congress, says, give me $700 billion, don&rsquo;t tell me</p>
<p>how to use it, because I have no clue, just give it to me and give me your authoritarian</p>
<p>power to do it any way I want.</p>
<p>And that was not out of a sense of grandeur, that was a sense of panic, he had no idea,</p>
<p>he had no clue, none of them did.</p>
<p>They bailed out everybody they could, everybody under their, you know, within their periphery,</p>
<p>when they thought it was appropriate, they were vindictive about some people like Lehman,</p>
<p>it was complete arbitrary use of power.</p>
<p>The bankers didn&rsquo;t benefit from this, indeed, many bankers that took their money lost from</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Bank stocks got crushed after the bailout.</p>
<p>Before the bailout, bank stocks were doing okay, and right after top was announced, bank</p>
<p>stocks crushed because this was bad for banks, it wasn&rsquo;t good for banks.</p>
<p>This is just central planning gone amok, it&rsquo;s not them bailing out elites, it&rsquo;s them, you</p>
<p>know, throwing money at a problem without knowing what they would actually do and what</p>
<p>the consequences would be.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But the point is, sorry, where we agree, the focus will always be on bailing out elites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost&hellip;</p>
<p>But little banks got money too.</p>
<p>No, I was saying that last year, there&rsquo;s no talk of saving ice and vice, saving Century</p>
<p>21, saving all these other industries.</p>
<p>But sure there were, if you look at it, it&rsquo;s just, sure there was, if you look at the,</p>
<p>if you look at what the Fed did, the Fed was bailing out third, fourth class businesses</p>
<p>in all kinds of areas that you wouldn&rsquo;t consider elitist areas, the whole PPP, the way&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking 2008.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m talking about now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about COVID last year.</p>
<p>What the Fed did was unbelievable, the kind of bonds that they were buying, even 2008,</p>
<p>even after 2008, I couldn&rsquo;t believe what they did last year.</p>
<p>PPP, the Payable Protection Program was targeted at everybody, everybody got PPP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about bailing out elites, it&rsquo;s about securing their power base.</p>
<p>And if they believe that securing their power base is Wall Street, then they&rsquo;ll bail out</p>
<p>Wall Street.</p>
<p>They believe securing their power base is writing checks to restaurant owners all over</p>
<p>the country, they&rsquo;ll write checks to restaurant owners all over the country, which is what</p>
<p>they did with PPP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about power for them and it&rsquo;s whatever will achieve power, whatever will result in</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about elites.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see elitism in the bailouts of last year.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I agree it wasn&rsquo;t last year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s one distinction between 2008 and 2020.</p>
<p>And I do think, just one more thing, I do think getting in good bed with the elites</p>
<p>is a great mechanism in general for maintaining one&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s not a dispute.</p>
<p>Depending on how we define it.</p>
<p>Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>You mentioned there&rsquo;s some criticism towards Bitcoin, there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement about</p>
<p>the technology of Bitcoin for the resistance against this kind of central state pursuit</p>
<p>of power.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part of my criticism because I don&rsquo;t think it works.</p>
<p>So yeah, I can imagine a world, I can imagine, I&rsquo;d love to see a technology evolve that where</p>
<p>money is competitive and it&rsquo;s a financial instrument that the government cannot touch.</p>
<p>You think the state is too powerful?</p>
<p>I think two things.</p>
<p>I think right now, and maybe this won&rsquo;t be true in the future, right now, I think crypto</p>
<p>is ill&hellip;</p>
<p>It cannot function as money right now.</p>
<p>It just can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But it does.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It functions as a mechanism.</p>
<p>It functions as a mechanism to transfer, it&rsquo;s a technology that allows me to transfer fiat</p>
<p>money from place to place, but it doesn&rsquo;t function, and it can&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s too volatile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sold things with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>No, I know you have, but I can sell things.</p>
<p>I can buy things and sell things with my airline model.</p>
<p>So there are lots of ways in which you can use things as money, but it doesn&rsquo;t make them</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using something as money, it&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>So let me take something you said before.</p>
<p>And it contradicts, I think, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You said one of the things about money is that it&rsquo;s stable.</p>
<p>I know what it&rsquo;s gonna buy tomorrow, right?</p>
<p>This is why we&rsquo;re against inflation, because I know what the dollar today I can plan, because</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t plan&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Bitcoin&rsquo;s gonna be worth tomorrow.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t plan with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is way too volatile to serve right now as money.</p>
<p>Now, the argument from Bitcoiners is, yes, it&rsquo;s still being adopted.</p>
<p>At some point, it&rsquo;ll reach a certain crucial mass.</p>
<p>High perfect monetization, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, and then it will become money, because at that point, it can be used as money, because</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;ll have a stable value.</p>
<p>Maybe right now, it&rsquo;s not useful as money, because I can&rsquo;t predict what&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t invest in it knowing what the value will be in five years.</p>
<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s an asset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a monetary unit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more functions as an asset.</p>
<p>Asset&rsquo;s value can go up.</p>
<p>Oh, I agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s functioning much more as an asset than as money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not in dispute.</p>
<p>I agree with that completely.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>But so I think it&rsquo;s still&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it can compete as a money with something tangible.</p>
<p>So I think in a free market, some kind of crypto backed by gold would be more successful.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin folks argue that Bitcoin has all the same fundamental properties that does</p>
<p>gold.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s backed by&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a scarcity to it, and it&rsquo;s backed by proof of work, so it&rsquo;s backed by physical</p>
<p>resources.</p>
<p>And so they say that&rsquo;s a very natural replacement of gold, so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be connected</p>
<p>to gold.</p>
<p>So there are two things that gold has that it doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>One is gold is not finite.</p>
<p>Gold supply actually grows over time.</p>
<p>Bitcoin at some point is truly finite.</p>
<p>At least unless you count the fact that you can split bitcoins and create coins, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a whole other question.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>The other one is that gold has value beyond its use as a currency, beyond its use as money.</p>
<p>For jewelry and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you minimize that.</p>
<p>But jewelry and stuff has been important for the human race for 100,000 years.</p>
<p>You can find jewelry in caves, for the cavemen designed jewelry and wore them.</p>
<p>So we obviously as human beings value jewelry a lot.</p>
<p>And almost all jewelry evolved to be made out of gold because whatever it is within</p>
<p>us is attracted to shiny gold in particular, shiny object generally.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about gold that appeals to human beings.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some value that gold has beyond its being a currency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not enough to use it as money.</p>
<p>Lots of things appeal to human beings.</p>
<p>But those are two characteristics.</p>
<p>One that it&rsquo;s not finite and second that it is a value beyond that Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think the finiteness could be framed as a feature?</p>
<p>The scarcity of Bitcoin?</p>
<p>No, because I think it creates a real problem with scarcity economically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the issue of planning.</p>
<p>There is a mechanism, there&rsquo;s a beautiful mechanism in markets that as the supply of</p>
<p>gold is in a sense the quantity of gold is&hellip;</p>
<p>Prices are going down because there&rsquo;s too little gold, right?</p>
<p>So the value of gold in a sense in dollar terms, the prices are going down.</p>
<p>What happens then is there&rsquo;s an incentive to then go mine for more gold, right?</p>
<p>Because it becomes cheaper and cheaper to mine as the price goes down.</p>
<p>So you mine for more gold, so it keeps increasing and it keeps increasing basically very correlated</p>
<p>to the rate of increasing productivity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of gold mining because prices are related to gold, gold is the dominant</p>
<p>money and it increases at about the same rate as productivity.</p>
<p>So it keeps prices relatively stable.</p>
<p>You still have bouts of inflation and deflation, but it keeps it relatively stable.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin it&rsquo;s fine at its ends, now prices will only decline.</p>
<p>What rate will they decline at?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll decline at the rate of productivity increases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to predict the rate at which productivity increases.</p>
<p>For example, technological shocks can change that dramatically.</p>
<p>You could get bouts of dramatic deflation, dramatic price drops that could be problematic</p>
<p>in terms of planning the same problem of inflation just reversed that you had before.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s a technical issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are ways to get around it.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys consider Bitcoin the end or the beginning, that is, is Bitcoin</p>
<p>it or is Bitcoin just the first example of a technology that&rsquo;s evolving?</p>
<p>I was just going to say there&rsquo;s the same technological issue with regard to gold, which is we now</p>
<p>have the technology that was very expensive to turn elements into different elements.</p>
<p>And at a certain, yeah, you could fire electrons at it or whatever.</p>
<p>You can make gold.</p>
<p>They figured out how to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not cheap and it&rsquo;s called big process.</p>
<p>If gold is the standard, a lot of resources are going to be going toward turning other</p>
<p>things into gold, making the production of gold cheaper.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to have a similar consequence that Laurence talked about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the category of security that Bitcoin has talked about, that it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to do that with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But I would argue that it&rsquo;s exceptionally difficult to do that with gold.</p>
<p>It is now.</p>
<p>But the thing is, there&rsquo;s not huge incentive.</p>
<p>If gold is the basis and if gold is worth that much, gold isn&rsquo;t worth that much.</p>
<p>Gold is worth, let&rsquo;s say, I&rsquo;m saying in this world that we&rsquo;re talking about, in the future,</p>
<p>gold is not going to be worth, let&rsquo;s say right now, gold is about 2000 bucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less than 2000.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s 2000 bucks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s its price in terms of dollars.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to, it would have to be worthwhile to create something of 2000 dollars.</p>
<p>How much would you be willing to put into it?</p>
<p>At some point, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And at that point, I think gold stops being money because it&rsquo;s useless.</p>
<p>Once I can create it like silicon, then once I can make out official gold.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just not, I don&rsquo;t think Bitcoin is the solution.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know what the solution is.</p>
<p>I wish I was that innovative, but I think you need a solution that has more of the characteristics</p>
<p>of gold than Bitcoin currently has.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, I guess I&rsquo;m surprised at a lot of the technologists who view Bitcoin as the</p>
<p>end game, where it strikes me as it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s the birth of a new tech, it represents the</p>
<p>birth of a new technology and who the winner in that technology is going to be.</p>
<p>We have no clue.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is one of the players, there are other players.</p>
<p>There might be a new technology that is even better than anything we can imagine right</p>
<p>now that, so Bitcoin doesn&rsquo;t strike me as optimal.</p>
<p>And that we should be moving towards something better.</p>
<p>Can you please stop shilling randcoin for five minutes?</p>
<p>You know where there was randcoin?</p>
<p>There was rand.</p>
<p>South Africa.</p>
<p>No, I was.</p>
<p>The agri currency is rand.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>No, I mean.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand is the South African one dollar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand coin was, I was in China in 20, I think it was 2015 or 14.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>China.</p>
<p>I was in China 20, something like that.</p>
<p>And this entrepreneur came up to me, she said she&rsquo;s bought this massive quantity of land</p>
<p>in this area in China, it&rsquo;s a little secluded.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s starting what she&rsquo;s calling Gold&rsquo;s Gulch.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s serious.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s issuing, and she issued cryptocurrency based on the land, right backed by the land</p>
<p>called rand, but Ayn Rand with a little portrait of Ayn Rand, you know, a little portrait in</p>
<p>the marketing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it went anywhere.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be a janitor?</p>
<p>A janitor in China at Gold&rsquo;s Gulch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, I do want to point out something I do enjoy about Objectivist.</p>
<p>I constantly talk about Ayn Rand and her vampire novels and that&rsquo;s the joke you&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And inevitably someone feels the need to point out that she did not write vampire novels</p>
<p>and her name is actually Ayn.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking for two hours.</p>
<p>I owed her a copy of the Fountainhead.</p>
<p>Somehow I thought her name was Ayn.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I love them.</p>
<p>So this is a really interesting way of phrasing it, which is&hellip;</p>
<p>I was kidding with the Ayn.</p>
<p>I know you knew how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know you know, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It just got confusing.</p>
<p>I think we all know and we all know that we&rsquo;re jokers here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Batman in this conversation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting way to frame it.</p>
<p>Is Bitcoin the end or the beginning of something?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve, as sort of with an open mind and seeing kind of all the possibilities of technologies</p>
<p>out there, I also kind of thought that Bitcoin is the beginning of something.</p>
<p>But what the Bitcoin community argues is that Bitcoin is the end of the base layer, meaning</p>
<p>all the different innovations will come on top of it.</p>
<p>Like for example, there&rsquo;s something called lightning network where it&rsquo;s basically just</p>
<p>like gold is the end and everything is built like the monetary systems like cash and all</p>
<p>that is built on top of gold.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the end in that other technologies are built on top of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their argument.</p>
<p>I get that and I hear that all the time and I just, I don&rsquo;t quite understand that.</p>
<p>And I think Bitcoin has limitations that potentially other cryptocurrencies might not have.</p>
<p>You know, my attitude towards something like this is to a large extent, I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>this technology.</p>
<p>My view is let it play out.</p>
<p>I think I have more fear of physical, the ability of the government to crush these things</p>
<p>than I think many in the community.</p>
<p>So for example, so I gave a talk, Bitcoin, you know, and they were hyping the acceptance</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>A lot of vendors will accept Bitcoin and this is great.</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, it&rsquo;s absolutely great.</p>
<p>More options is better than fewer options.</p>
<p>But I said, you know that that could be taken away like that.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s true that we could exchange Bitcoin and the government wouldn&rsquo;t know, I think,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t know that we do.</p>
<p>But once he&rsquo;s advertising on his website that he accepts Bitcoin or once he tries to turn</p>
<p>his Bitcoin into particular goods, once you manifest it in the physical world, now the</p>
<p>government can step in.</p>
<p>So the government could say, you can&rsquo;t sell anything to anybody using Bitcoin.</p>
<p>They can do that and you won&rsquo;t be able to sell it.</p>
<p>It will have to go into the black market.</p>
<p>But that isn&rsquo;t able to sell it, just sell it in the black market.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s where the government thrives, right?</p>
<p>The government thrives on letting you do stuff in the black market so they can decide when</p>
<p>to put you in jail or not, right?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m buying a sweatshirt from the government, sorry, if I&rsquo;m buying a sweatshirt from somebody</p>
<p>using Bitcoin, the government can&rsquo;t monitor my exchange of Bitcoin to him.</p>
<p>But they can monitor the sweatshirt being sent to me, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where they can interfere.</p>
<p>And I think that at some point, to the extent Bitcoin is successful, it will be stopped.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what will stop it from becoming money.</p>
<p>See, money can only become money.</p>
<p>It can only become money if people are using it as money, right?</p>
<p>And if the government can stop it being used, if I can&rsquo;t go to the grocery store and use</p>
<p>my ATM that charges on Bitcoin or whatever, then it&rsquo;s not money.</p>
<p>And I think that the government is going to step in and stop people from doing that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&hellip;</p>
<p>So I have more respect and fear for the power of government today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see that at all.</p>
<p>However, I could be wrong.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure Yaron hopes he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And in some sense&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope the government just give in and the Fed tomorrow says, yeah, let Bitcoin thrive.</p>
<p>But I think they&rsquo;ll want to regulate and control it.</p>
<p>And the only way to regulate and control it is to stop it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a bunch of people who argue that Bitcoin is too compelling to government</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll actually embrace it, like a Trojan horse and stuff.</p>
<p>But that assumes government has positive goals and wants to do good things.</p>
<p>You can ask&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s greedy.</p>
<p>They say government is greedy because they&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, Bitcoiners have this whole lingo.</p>
<p>They say number go up.</p>
<p>Government is not greedy.</p>
<p>Government is not greedy for money.</p>
<p>Government is greedy for power.</p>
<p>Government is greedy for control.</p>
<p>Government is much more&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, money is good too.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll take the money if they can get it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not fundamentally about money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fundamentally&hellip;</p>
<p>And this is something that many libertarians don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>This is something many of the Bitcoin community don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>They have far too benevolent a view of politicians and the people in government today.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m alive with this.</p>
<p>And I know why he&rsquo;s laughing.</p>
<p>I think I know why he&rsquo;s laughing.</p>
<p>You know exactly why I&rsquo;m laughing.</p>
<p>And we should get to that issue at some point here.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of naivete.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Speaking of naivete&hellip;</p>
<p>A lot of it, Yaron.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not naive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually providing the warning and all these Bitcoiners are saying, no, no, no, government</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t function that way.</p>
<p>No one says I&rsquo;m naive.</p>
<p>Naive people think they&rsquo;re not naive.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put this on the table.</p>
<p>Speaking of naive, I still more than the two of you by far, I think, have faith that government</p>
<p>can work.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put that on the table.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be pedantic.</p>
<p>What do you mean work?</p>
<p>Government can achieve goals.</p>
<p>That is not a dispute.</p>
<p>Government can achieve goals effectively to build a better world, a functioning society.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to take it one step further than you.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>The only way to achieve a better world is through government.</p>
<p>Michael, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>He almost dropped it.</p>
<p>I said it on purpose that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that the mask is dropping.</p>
<p>You cannot achieve, you cannot have liberty or freedom without a government.</p>
<p>Now not anything like the governments we have today.</p>
<p>So I think the idea that you can have liberty or freedom without government is the rejection</p>
<p>of the idea of liberty and freedom and the undermining of any effort, any attempt to</p>
<p>do it.</p>
<p>In that sense, you, Lex, I know, exactly.</p>
<p>On this side, I&rsquo;m in agreement with Lex, which is unusual.</p>
<p>That government is good for freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re in agreement with the guy who&rsquo;s reading Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a surprise.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s dressed in black.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bad guys.</p>
<p>But the fascism, I mean, the road to fascism is anarchy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>Anarchy.</p>
<p>Can you give me one example of an anarchy like the fascism?</p>
<p>Well, every example of a stateless society leads to authoritarianism, every single one</p>
<p>in all of human history.</p>
<p>It has to.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, you&rsquo;re saying Weimar Germany was anarchy?</p>
<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t pure anarchy, but it got close.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>It got close to anarchy?</p>
<p>I said the reverse, by the way.</p>
<p>I said the reverse.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that every form of authoritarianism started with anarchy.</p>
<p>I said that every situation in which human beings lived under anarchy led to authoritarianism.</p>
<p>So I said the flip was right.</p>
<p>Anarchism isn&rsquo;t a location.</p>
<p>Anarchism is a relationship.</p>
<p>The three of us are in an anarchist relationship.</p>
<p>Every country is in a relationship of anarchy toward each other.</p>
<p>The US and Canada have an anarchist relationship toward one another.</p>
<p>And to claim, you know, going back to Emma Goldman, who I love, in 1901, William McKinley,</p>
<p>President McKinley, was shot by this guy, Leon Salgas.</p>
<p>And it was very funny, but he was a crazy person.</p>
<p>And they arrested him.</p>
<p>He shot the president.</p>
<p>And they go, why did you shoot President McKinley?</p>
<p>And he just goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, oh, goddammit.</p>
<p>So now she&rsquo;s on the lam, she had nothing to do with this guy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s trying to flee.</p>
<p>She gets arrested.</p>
<p>They caught her.</p>
<p>And she said, and this is the hubris of this woman, which I admire as the subject to be</p>
<p>good hubris.</p>
<p>She goes, I&rsquo;d like to thank the cops for doing what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re turning far more people into anarchism than I could do on my own.</p>
<p>So given everything you&rsquo;ve said in these two hours, and then to pivot to being anti government</p>
<p>is being anti liberty, I don&rsquo;t feel I have to say anything.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>For people who are not familiar, if you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know why you would not be familiar,</p>
<p>but Michael Malice talks quite a bit about the evils of the state and government and</p>
<p>espouses ideas that anarchism is actually, what is it, the most moral system, the most</p>
<p>effective system for human relationships.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this great book called Atlas Shrugged and the author posits an anarchist private</p>
<p>society.</p>
<p>She calls it Galt&rsquo;s Gulch, where everything is privately owned and everyone is, no one</p>
<p>is in a position of authority over anyone else other than the landowner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an anarchist society.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one judge and one authority.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what everyone has voluntarily moved there and agreed to be under.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very small community, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>That is right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no problem with competing governments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of anarchism.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of anarchism.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>End the show.</p>
<p>I got him over.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Not definition of anarchy at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for competing governments.</p>
<p>Hold up.</p>
<p>You get more cookies.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>He did it.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>You brought him over.</p>
<p>Red rover, red rover.</p>
<p>More Lithuanian.</p>
<p>What is this clown stuff?</p>
<p>I was Lithuanian.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my people.</p>
<p>Yasnaya Polyana, Miodom, it&rsquo;s honey.</p>
<p>No claims of health or nutrition.</p>
<p>The other one claimed health.</p>
<p>This one no claims.</p>
<p>This makes no claims.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m for competing governments on different geographic areas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Why does it have to be over geographic?</p>
<p>Okay, let me&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really crucial that it&rsquo;s on different&hellip;</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have two judges in Galt&rsquo;s Gulch, you have one.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason why.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one authority.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one system of laws in Galt&rsquo;s Gulch that all the people under the Gulch abide</p>
<p>by.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two because they&rsquo;re in America.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>The whole point is they&rsquo;re not, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not in America, they&rsquo;re in Colorado.</p>
<p>I know, but the whole point of the novel is they&rsquo;ve left America.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t left America.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve hid themselves.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not under the authority of the Americans.</p>
<p>But they are.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get it?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re hidden.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to be&hellip;</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>The point is that they&rsquo;re hidden so they&rsquo;re not under the&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>If the three of us hide, we&rsquo;re still under the authority of Washington.</p>
<p>Not if they don&rsquo;t know that we exist.</p>
<p>But this is why they haven&rsquo;t established a state, and it&rsquo;s not a government, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not in that sense an example of really the way we form societies.</p>
<p>It is a private club that is hidden away from everybody else.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p>
<p>What happens if an American kills a Canadian in Mexico?</p>
<p>What happens in America, it depends.</p>
<p>Depends on the nature of the governments of the three places, right?</p>
<p>But usually what happens in most of human history is that America will launch a war</p>
<p>either against Mexico or Canada.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all&hellip;</p>
<p>So usually violence results in much more violence.</p>
<p>Anarchy is just a system that legalizes violence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it does.</p>
<p>And in international affairs, that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>The reality is that the way you resolve disputes that are major disputes is through violence.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand said, the definition of a government is an agency that has a monopoly of force</p>
<p>in a geographical area.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t complain that anarchism is legalizing violence when the definition of government,</p>
<p>according to Rand, is legalized violence.</p>
<p>No, but because you&rsquo;re taking the definition of violence the way she defines it, right,</p>
<p>in this context.</p>
<p>A, she talks about retaliatory force only.</p>
<p>Has that ever happened?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>That is the point.</p>
<p>Before there was Aristotle.</p>
<p>Before there was an America, there was an America.</p>
<p>The fact that something has never existed means that it will never exist before.</p>
<p>The fact that the ideas haven&rsquo;t been developed to make something exist means that it will</p>
<p>never exist before.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>Human race is a young race.</p>
<p>The ideas of freedom are very young.</p>
<p>The ideas of the enlightenment are just 250 years old.</p>
<p>The idea that you can&rsquo;t create the kind of government Ayn Rand talked about, I talk about,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s never been before means it will never happen again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a silly argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a silly argument.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being a Platonist.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain to you how you&rsquo;re being exactly a Platonist.</p>
<p>So if I was sitting in 1750 arguing with Thomas Jefferson, he was telling me what kind of</p>
<p>state he was going to create, and I said, is a state like this ever being created?</p>
<p>And he said, no.</p>
<p>Was I being a Platonist?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re being a Platonist.</p>
<p>You know, things change.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being a Platonist now.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re being a Platonist now.</p>
<p>Because one of the things that Aristotle believed in, one of the things that Ayn Rand in other</p>
<p>contexts believed in, the cover of her book, The Philosophy Who Needs It, is, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the Sistine Chapel, the cover, or wherever it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Aristotle and Plato walking.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Yeah, but&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that painting?</p>
<p>I forgot what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the School of Athens.</p>
<p>School of Athens.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Raphael.</p>
<p>So Plato&rsquo;s pointing toward the heavens while they&rsquo;re talking, and Aristotle&rsquo;s pointing</p>
<p>to the earth.</p>
<p>Reality.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So if you want, there&rsquo;s two approaches.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Descartes, Cartesian approach, which is I sit in my armchair and I deduce</p>
<p>all of reality, or if I want to study the nature of man, if I want to study the nature</p>
<p>of dogs, if I want to study the nature of the sun, I have to look around.</p>
<p>I have to open my eyes.</p>
<p>I have to look at data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>You know, when Rand was on Donahue, he asked her about, aren&rsquo;t you impressed with the order</p>
<p>in the universe?</p>
<p>And she goes, oh, now you have to give me a moment.</p>
<p>And the point she made, which was very hard for many people to grasp, it&rsquo;s hard for me</p>
<p>to grasp, is one&rsquo;s concept of order comes from the universe.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have a disorderly universe because order means describing that which exists and</p>
<p>which has existed.</p>
<p>Now, if you are looking at governments throughout history that have always existed, and when</p>
<p>you were on Lex, you said, what I&rsquo;m talking about has never existed.</p>
<p>To say that this, therefore, that that has a possibility of working in reality, I think</p>
<p>is certainly not a point in that favor, number one.</p>
<p>And number two, Jefferson was a fraud.</p>
<p>What Jefferson argued how America would look did not come true.</p>
<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s concerns about the Constitution were accurate.</p>
<p>And the fact is the federal government did become centralized, did become a civil war.</p>
<p>So if you told Mr. Jefferson the government you&rsquo;re positing can&rsquo;t work, you would have</p>
<p>been correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the issue of can it work or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the issue of can something exist that hasn&rsquo;t existed in the past?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a silly argument.</p>
<p>Now, we can argue about the fact of reality, whether such a thing can exist.</p>
<p>But to say it hasn&rsquo;t existed in the past is not an argument about whether it can exist</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the argument you made.</p>
<p>No, no, you&rsquo;re talking about history and now you&rsquo;re dancing around it.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that something different happened in the founding of America.</p>
<p>It might not have been perfect, might not have been ideal, it might have been some people</p>
<p>even think it was bad, right?</p>
<p>Sure, it was different.</p>
<p>Something different happened.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And you could have said 20 years before and said, well, that&rsquo;s never happened before,</p>
<p>so it can&rsquo;t happen in the future.</p>
<p>That is a bad argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good argument.</p>
<p>Irrelevant.</p>
<p>No, but you&rsquo;re making the argument that just because something hasn&rsquo;t happened before,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s certainly not a point to say it&rsquo;s likely to happen or possible.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, first of all, I agree that everything we know about what&rsquo;s possible or what&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>possible has to be from reality.</p>
<p>That we agree completely.</p>
<p>I think anarchists completely evade that point.</p>
<p>I think you guys live in a world of mythology, of abstraction, of Descartes, to imagine the</p>
<p>kind of anarchy that David Friedman or Rothbard describe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complete fiction and it&rsquo;s complete mysticism.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask just a few dumb questions.</p>
<p>So first of all, what do we do with violence in terms of just natural emergence of violence</p>
<p>in human societies?</p>
<p>So the idea that anarchism proposes is that we would, as the community grows, there may</p>
<p>be violence and then we together form collectives that sort of fund mechanisms that resist that</p>
<p>violence.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d love to sort of talk about violence because that seems to be the core thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between the state that was definitionally, I guess, is the thing</p>
<p>that has a monopoly on violence or controls violence in such a way that you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to worry about it.</p>
<p>And then the anarchism, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m using bad words.</p>
<p>Your definition is accurate, but the point is that being definition of the state versus</p>
<p>how states act in reality is just absurd, yeah.</p>
<p>And then the idea that anarchism will be is that it&rsquo;s more kind of a market of defenses</p>
<p>against violence.</p>
<p>So you have like security companies and then you hire different ones that are more competent.</p>
<p>You have things being made affordable, you have more accessibility to security, you have</p>
<p>accountability when people misuse their power, and you have more layers of security than</p>
<p>having a government monopoly.</p>
<p>What every objectivist understand, and they don&rsquo;t deny this, this is something they talk</p>
<p>about constantly, is anytime you have a government monopoly, it&rsquo;s going to have enormous distortions</p>
<p>as a consequence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be expensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be ineffective.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re talking about ineffectiveness in markets, that&rsquo;s not just, you know, like</p>
<p>the cup sucks.</p>
<p>It often means mass death.</p>
<p>It often means persecution.</p>
<p>So this is something that anarchism, if not entirely prevents, certainly mitigates enormously.</p>
<p>So can I just, as a thought experiment, say it was very easy to immigrate to another country,</p>
<p>like where you could just move about from government to government, would that alleviate</p>
<p>most of the problems that you have towards the state, which is like people being free</p>
<p>to choose which government they operate under?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that essentially be&hellip;</p>
<p>Last scam, yeah.</p>
<p>So like what is, I&rsquo;m trying to understand why governments aren&rsquo;t already the thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the goal of anarchism.</p>
<p>The kind of collectives that emerge under anarchism seems to be what government&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re equating two terms.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something called like private governance and there&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>So for example, if I go to Yaron&rsquo;s house and he has a rule, take off your shoes, become</p>
<p>your house, if you want to really be kind of silly about it, you could say he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>governor.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really nonsensical to say that.</p>
<p>If you go to Macy&rsquo;s, right, if you want to return your sweater, Macy&rsquo;s rules are right</p>
<p>up there.</p>
<p>You have seven days.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a receipt, you&rsquo;re going to get store credit.</p>
<p>If you do have a receipt, you get a refund.</p>
<p>So every organization, every bar, every nightclub, your house has rules of governments.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often they&rsquo;re unspoken.</p>
<p>This is unavoidable.</p>
<p>No one in America by law has to pay a tip, but it&rsquo;s just customary.</p>
<p>You go at the waiter, you give them 15, 20%, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now what anarchism does is it says, okay, security is something that is of crucial,</p>
<p>essential human need.</p>
<p>We all need to be safe in our property, safe in our purpose.</p>
<p>The organization that by far is the biggest violator of this and always has been, always</p>
<p>will be, is the government.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a monopoly, because it has no accountability.</p>
<p>And look at the rioting last year, right?</p>
<p>If you have one agency, pretend it&rsquo;s not the government, pretend it&rsquo;s Apple.</p>
<p>And Apple has in charge of security in this town.</p>
<p>People are rioting, people are looting.</p>
<p>And Apple says, yeah, we&rsquo;re not going to send people into work.</p>
<p>And if you try to defend yourself, we&rsquo;re going to put you in jail as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem of having a government monopoly and that&rsquo;s something that anarchism</p>
<p>solves for.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you, cause you said no accountability, don&rsquo;t you mean to say poor accountability?</p>
<p>No, I mean to say no accountability.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that the idea of democracies?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not for democracy.</p>
<p>No, not for democracy, but like the system of governments that we have, there is a monopoly</p>
<p>on violence, but there is a, I mean, at least in the ideal, but I think in practice as well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an accountability.</p>
<p>I do not think that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re a critic of the police force and all those kinds of things, but the military</p>
<p>is accountable to the people.</p>
<p>I do not agree.</p>
<p>The police force is accountable to the people.</p>
<p>I do not agree.</p>
<p>Perhaps imperfectly, but you&rsquo;re saying not at all.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen many examples of police officers doing horrific things on video and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even lose their pensions.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of amazing police officers or no?</p>
<p>I mean, no, there are not.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying by nature, police is like a fundamentally flawed system.</p>
<p>No, by nature, government monopoly on police is a fundamentally irredeemable system.</p>
<p>Talk about private security.</p>
<p>If I have a private security firm, you could have that under a government.</p>
<p>And as a result of my private security, my person who I&rsquo;m bodyguarding gets shot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be very bad for my company as compared to competing companies.</p>
<p>However, when you have a government monopoly and I get people shot, what are you going</p>
<p>to do?</p>
<p>So the problem is that all the examples are going to be within the context of an existing</p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>The iPhone example and all these other examples of us being here, we&rsquo;re not an anarchy.</p>
<p>That is absurd.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re under a particular system of law and the system of laws applies and we know that</p>
<p>the particular system of laws applies.</p>
<p>So the problem is when you have&hellip;</p>
<p>There are many laws that we&rsquo;re not going to be enforced, that we&rsquo;re not going to be subject</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>Violence related?</p>
<p>No, there are lots of laws that are not going to be enforced.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t make this anarchy because there are the laws out there.</p>
<p>They could be enforced, which makes it an anarchy.</p>
<p>But look, there&rsquo;s a number of issues here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an issue of the role of force in human society.</p>
<p>I got to clarify things because I think you misunderstood what I said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that America is anarchist.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is the three of us have an anarchist relationship between us because</p>
<p>none of us have authority over the others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a bad use of the word anarchy.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s the correct use of the word anarchy.</p>
<p>It makes it meaningless.</p>
<p>It makes it&hellip;</p>
<p>Every time any people get together, they have an anarchistic relationship.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We have a voluntary relationship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what anarchism means, voluntarism.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a political system.</p>
<p>You want to get a dictionary out?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking a word and it&rsquo;s accepted usage.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re saying, oh, no, it means&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean like selfishness?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>And we never finished that discussion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking a word, we&rsquo;re taking a word that you&rsquo;re defining and replacing it with</p>
<p>voluntary.</p>
<p>Now, voluntary&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not for anarchism or voluntarism.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s understand what voluntary means, right?</p>
<p>For example, going to stores and there&rsquo;s a certain relationship that we have with a store</p>
<p>that we engage in certain voluntary transactions with that store.</p>
<p>Now, I believe that that works because there is a certain system of law that both the store</p>
<p>and we have accepted that makes that possible.</p>
<p>Now, if that didn&rsquo;t, there are certain people who would like to walk into their store and</p>
<p>just take the stuff, right?</p>
<p>So there is a&hellip;</p>
<p>We might not, but there are certain people who might want it to go into their store.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain system of laws that regulates the relationship and that defines the property</p>
<p>rights and then provides protection for the property rights.</p>
<p>Now, you would like all that privatized.</p>
<p>That is, the store would have its police force and that would be privatized.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t believe that force can be privatized and there are many reasons&hellip;</p>
<p>And it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it can and I don&rsquo;t think&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting distinction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it can because I think that it&rsquo;s an unstable equilibrium, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think competing police forces can work.</p>
<p>At the end, the police force with the biggest gun always wins and always takes over and</p>
<p>becomes authoritarian.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Look at Iran and Iraq, excuse me.</p>
<p>We had the bigger guns, we didn&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Look at Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t win partially because none of that is an example of anarchy.</p>
<p>No, but you just said the guy with the biggest gun is gonna win.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The guy with the biggest gun is gonna win.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t win in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We had the bigger guns.</p>
<p>But again, you&rsquo;re taking it outside of a context.</p>
<p>That was a context in which countries are fighting, not a context in which there is</p>
<p>no country.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you, Yaron, have a rocket launcher and there&rsquo;s 100 people with handguns.</p>
<p>How are you gonna win?</p>
<p>You have the biggest gun.</p>
<p>Oh, believe me, I could win.</p>
<p>With one rocket launcher against 100 people?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it depends how many rockets I have in the rocket launcher and whether I&rsquo;m willing</p>
<p>to use them.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s&hellip; so now it&rsquo;s democracy because there are more of them that they win.</p>
<p>Look, any one of these scenarios, all it does&hellip; so let&rsquo;s go back to the store.</p>
<p>This is fascinating, by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying this.</p>
<p>I just want to say that.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Because&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you are.</p>
<p>I am enjoying the pain.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also enjoying the comments that are gonna happen.</p>
<p>Oh, the comments are gonna be overwhelmingly on your side.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely dishonest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a modern day&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the guy who is defending communism?</p>
<p>Richard Wolff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a modern day Richard Wolff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which I think anarchists are evading reality in the same sense.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got this&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you think I&rsquo;m dishonest or delusional?</p>
<p>Calling someone dishonest is a really specific&hellip;</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re delusional.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt of being delusional.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>What is love?</p>
<p>And as I said on the show, on the previous interview, I said, only smart people can be</p>
<p>anarchists because it requires a certain level of abstraction of being divorced from reality</p>
<p>that is hard for people who are actually connected to reality.</p>
<p>He makes a good point because I always talk about this with people on social media and</p>
<p>they talk about a lot of people who buy into the corporate media narrative and how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dumb.</p>
<p>I go, it&rsquo;s easier to train smart people than dumb people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to convince smart people of the systemic that&rsquo;s divorced from reality than</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s dumb.</p>
<p>You can deal in abstracts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the concretes that actually happen.</p>
<p>This is an example I gave debating another anarchist.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>She must have sucked.</p>
<p>Well, you were the best.</p>
<p>They were Hoppe fans.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Hoppe, okay.</p>
<p>Hoppe fans.</p>
<p>Not one of my least like&hellip;</p>
<p>The people I like least in the world out there.</p>
<p>You like them better than the communists, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Barely.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because I think it leads to the same place.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I think it leads to gulags.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I think anarchy leads to gulags.</p>
<p>And I think Hoppe&rsquo;s view of anarchy definitely leads to gulags.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll grant you just for the sake of argument that it leads to gulags.</p>
<p>However, surely you concede that they are against gulags whereas the commies have no</p>
<p>problem with it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big&hellip;</p>
<p>I think some do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure people like Hoppe do.</p>
<p>Because if you read some of his stuff, one wonders, right?</p>
<p>But he wants monarchies and he wants&hellip;</p>
<p>No, he said monarchies are preferable to democracy, which is true.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the problems with an anarchist is&hellip;</p>
<p>What judge?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the monarch.</p>
<p>One of the problems&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One judge, one authority.</p>
<p>This is why I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, the monarch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think&hellip;</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a Hoppean.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s authoritarians.</p>
<p>So Yaron Brooks is a Hoppean.</p>
<p>Get in the chopper.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not a Hoppean.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want one judge.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want an arbitrary judge.</p>
<p>I want an objective judge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an essay by John Hasnas, I think his name, I&rsquo;m gonna bungle it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be in my upcoming book on anarchism.</p>
<p>And he just discusses, and it&rsquo;s a very long, complicated, technical issue, that the idea</p>
<p>of objective law is incoherent.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why we disagree so much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I think objective law is the only coherent system.</p>
<p>Do you disagree that we, in effect, have competing systems of law under America?</p>
<p>Meaning there&rsquo;s different ideologies.</p>
<p>You have the Sotomayor ideology versus the Scalia ideology, and that effectively.</p>
<p>And the point being, when you and I file a lawsuit, it completely depends on who the</p>
<p>judge is.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And in theory, I don&rsquo;t think the system works this way, but in theory, the way the system</p>
<p>would work is that on new issues, there is some competition.</p>
<p>Syria wasn&rsquo;t talking to you.</p>
<p>Technology.</p>
<p>Capitalism.</p>
<p>So in theory, the system works, and this works, I think, with competing states, but also with</p>
<p>competing legal views, particularly on a new issue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, this is how common law worked, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evolution of it, and at some point, that gets codified into the law.</p>
<p>And it gets objectified in that sense.</p>
<p>That is, there&rsquo;s some conclusion that people come to.</p>
<p>This is the role, in theory, of a legislature, and the legislature would be nice if it was</p>
<p>composed of people who had some idea of legal philosophy.</p>
<p>And it gets codified.</p>
<p>Because these things are complex, and at some point, it goes through all the arguments,</p>
<p>and then a certain truth emerges, or a certain truth is identified, and that&rsquo;s what gets</p>
<p>encoded in law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the purpose of a legislature is.</p>
<p>Now, if you have competing mechanisms that don&rsquo;t converge on one authority, because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no one authority, there are multiple authorities.</p>
<p>That is, in a sense, there are multiple governments or multiple systems of enforcement, right?</p>
<p>Then you get not just something emerging out of it, what you get is competing legal systems.</p>
<p>Competing legal systems that now have competing mechanisms of enforcement, competing police</p>
<p>forces, competing militaries, however we want to define it.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s no mechanism to resolve that.</p>
<p>Now, yes, we could negotiate, and there&rsquo;s goodwill, and so on, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re talking about the law, what each view, each position views as true and</p>
<p>right, right?</p>
<p>And it might involve, for example, it might involve the fact that the legal system has</p>
<p>come to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s okay for children to have sex with adults, and this</p>
<p>legal system thinks that is evil and wrong, right?</p>
<p>And something has happened between the two, right?</p>
<p>How do you resolve that conflict?</p>
<p>There is no resolution.</p>
<p>If this adult wants to have sex with this child, this legal system thinks it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>that legal system thinks it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>The only way to resolve that system is through one system imposing itself on the other.</p>
<p>An example of countries is exactly that.</p>
<p>When you had monarchies, when you had the little states all over the place, the way</p>
<p>any kind of dispute was resolved when there were issues of territorial disputes, or issues</p>
<p>of marriage, or issues of different legal interpretations about&hellip; was war.</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yes, it was.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t marriage.</p>
<p>A lot of times people would marry a princess from another country just to feast.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Forced marriages, which was not very pleasant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather sacrifice one princess than a queen.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t want to sacrifice anybody.</p>
<p>And in addition, I don&rsquo;t want to sacrifice anybody.</p>
<p>I want to sacrifice the royals.</p>
<p>And in addition&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t want royals.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want royals.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what sacrificing means.</p>
<p>I think royals are pretty disgusting.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the baskets.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, look, those periods in history are filled with violence, much</p>
<p>more violence than we have today, much more bloody than they are today, far less freedom</p>
<p>than we have today in terms of individual freedom.</p>
<p>After the 20th&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re comparing this to 20th century.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m comparing a monarchy, right?</p>
<p>You said that&rsquo;s preferable to democracy, right?</p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comparing&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying Hoppe said that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m saying that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying Hoppe said that.</p>
<p>To some extent.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to die in that hell.</p>
<p>Hoppe said that.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>These kings and queens were fighting constantly.</p>
<p>I mean, the wars back then were violent in a way that&hellip;</p>
<p>Unlike now?</p>
<p>No, much more violent than now.</p>
<p>If you look at the actual percentage of people killed in war&hellip;</p>
<p>The Steven Pinker book.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you look at the percentage of people&hellip;</p>
<p>And not just that.</p>
<p>You can look at the other stats.</p>
<p>The percentage of people killed in war back then were far greater than the percentage</p>
<p>of people even during World War II and World War I.</p>
<p>So anarchy, and you know, David Friedman loves to quote the sagas of Iceland about how wonderful</p>
<p>the anarchy&hellip;</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s funny because a lot of people who read David Friedman never read the sagas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading.</p>
<p>The sagas of the Iceland are filled with violence.</p>
<p>Constant violence.</p>
<p>Constantly people killing each other over, you know, I stole your chickens and you slept</p>
<p>with my wife.</p>
<p>The only way to resolve disputes, the only way to resolve disputes was violence.</p>
<p>There was no authority, there was no mechanism to resolve these disputes.</p>
<p>There was a council, but the council couldn&rsquo;t enforce anything, so in the end of the day</p>
<p>we just resolved to violence.</p>
<p>And this is legalized because there is no mechanism by which to make the violence illegal.</p>
<p>So all anarchy is, is legalized violence constrained for a while and up until people stop that</p>
<p>constraint by, you know, arrangements between the security organizations.</p>
<p>But the security organizations have us by the balls, to put it figuratively, right?</p>
<p>They really do.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Unlike the state?</p>
<p>Oh, the state today has it, but I would much rather live in this state, much rather live</p>
<p>in this state, much rather live in many more authoritarian states than this, than a place</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s constant violence.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of questions, but I&rsquo;m enjoying this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why everything he said is wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, yes.</p>
<p>Well, the idea of competing legal systems is inevitable because what Rand talked about</p>
<p>is what she wanted was, and this is really kind of out of character with her broader</p>
<p>ideology is, I think this was her term and I&rsquo;m not saying this to make fun of you, when</p>
<p>she has a judge and he&rsquo;s looking at the information, she wants him to be basically, I think she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the word robot, someone without any ideology.</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re just looking at the facts, they&rsquo;re not bringing their kind of worldview to it.</p>
<p>I take it as a compliment.</p>
<p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>I think that given otherwise, her correct view that ideology is just a slur for someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>philosophy that someone, especially someone as erudite, educated and informed as a judge</p>
<p>has to, and in fact should bring their ideology to their work is in one sense a little contradiction</p>
<p>in her view, number one.</p>
<p>Number two is we have right now the DA in San Francisco, I forget his name.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the son of literal terrorists, communist terrorists, and he has made it the decree</p>
<p>unilaterally that if you shoplift for less than, I forget, $200, we&rsquo;re not prosecuting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that.</p>
<p>You know this guy, right, right, right.</p>
<p>So now you and I, and Lex I&rsquo;m sure probably, agree that his ideology is abhorrent, that</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t help poor people, it doesn&rsquo;t help shop owners, it creates a culture, an</p>
<p>area where it&rsquo;s just deleterious to human life.</p>
<p>However, he has in one sense, given that he is a state operative, a legitimate worldview.</p>
<p>Can I ask you just a quick question?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t a security force in a particular context say, yeah, if you take stuff on that</p>
<p>store, we&rsquo;re not going to have any problem with that?</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very fair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very legitimate question.</p>
<p>The point is, in the context that I&rsquo;m talking about, that firm is like, wait a minute, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hiring you for security, you&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;re not going to provide security, why am I writing</p>
<p>you a check?</p>
<p>And we have examples of this in real life.</p>
<p>If I get into a car accident with you, right?</p>
<p>You have your car insurance, I have my car insurance.</p>
<p>If your car insurance had their druthers, they wouldn&rsquo;t pay me one penny.</p>
<p>If my car insurance didn&rsquo;t have their druthers, they wouldn&rsquo;t pay you one penny.</p>
<p>We already have all, you were saying earlier that we need to have one kind of umbrella</p>
<p>mechanism of use.</p>
<p>There are already more cases than you can count where there&rsquo;s private arbitration.</p>
<p>Now the argument is that private arbitration only works because they have recourse to the</p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>But my point is, there&rsquo;s many examples where even though that recourse is theoretically</p>
<p>possible, it&rsquo;s not a realistic concern, specifically because they know that if you have recourse</p>
<p>to the state, you have no concept of what that outcome is going to look like, except</p>
<p>knowing it&rsquo;s going to be exorbitant, it&rsquo;s going to be time consuming.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t use the state, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m as critical as the state as it is right now.</p>
<p>Maybe not as critical as yours, not as critical as yours, but I&rsquo;m quite critical of the state</p>
<p>as it is right now.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say we got into a traffic accident and you have a Rolls Royce and I destroyed</p>
<p>your Rolls Royce and my insurance company now owes your insurance company a lot of money.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s imagine it&rsquo;s a lot of money just for the sake of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re clearly guilty.</p>
<p>Yeah, clearly guilty.</p>
<p>And my insurance company looks at the books and it goes, I don&rsquo;t want to pay this.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got bigger guns than his insurance company.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just going to take over their insurance company.</p>
<p>And hostile takeover takes on a whole new meaning when I can muster guns on my behalf</p>
<p>than in a hostile takeover in a capitalist context.</p>
<p>That to me is what happens.</p>
<p>That to me is inevitably what happens.</p>
<p>And I think this is where the delusion comes in.</p>
<p>The idea that when big money is involved and power is involved, remember, again, the same</p>
<p>kind of politicians who today get into politics are likely to want to run some of these security</p>
<p>agencies because they&rsquo;ll have a lot of power over people.</p>
<p>The same kind of maybe sociopaths would be the same skill set, but that&rsquo;s a separate</p>
<p>issue.</p>
<p>I think it very much is.</p>
<p>But you think people, the people in Washington, the same, the CEOs psychologically and skill</p>
<p>set wise?</p>
<p>Well, today&rsquo;s CEOs?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You might be right.</p>
<p>Because I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s rewarded for a CEO, somebody who could get along with government.</p>
<p>And I think the kind of CEO who is going to run a security company, which is not just</p>
<p>about business, it&rsquo;s about the use of force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about negotiation with other entities that are using force, you know, diplomacy.</p>
<p>And we should get back to objective law because I think it&rsquo;s essential to this whole argument.</p>
<p>I think all you get into is security agencies fighting security agencies.</p>
<p>And again, the biggest gun.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean here the guy who has the biggest literal gun, the rocket launcher versus</p>
<p>the guns.</p>
<p>I got excited for a second.</p>
<p>By the biggest gun?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The party that has the more physical force, however, that is mustered either by numbers</p>
<p>or by weapons is going to dominate and will take over everybody else.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that&rsquo;s common in a market is takeovers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s consolidation.</p>
<p>And here the consolidation can happen through force and you can rule other security companies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what will happen until you dominate the particular geographic area.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let me explain why I disagree with that.</p>
<p>You were just saying, and I agree correctly, I agree with you, that, listen, if I have</p>
<p>access to the bigger gun, why am I paying you or whoever&rsquo;s paying whatever?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to use force and not pay them.</p>
<p>We have that right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called lobbying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So instead of me, and I&rsquo;m sure in your example, you weren&rsquo;t being literal, instead of the</p>
<p>insurance company literally having the army, they could be like, hey, let me call corrupt</p>
<p>co with a mafia.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Go out and take them out.</p>
<p>By having this federal government, as you know, and certainly I&rsquo;m not a fan of, takes</p>
<p>more through asset forfeiture than burglaries combined.</p>
<p>What asset forfeiture is, people don&rsquo;t even understand this.</p>
<p>This is something crazy, which you&rsquo;re on, it&rsquo;s as opposed to me, as opposed as I am,</p>
<p>which is I&rsquo;m a cop.</p>
<p>I go to your house.</p>
<p>I think you haven&rsquo;t been charged or convicted of anything.</p>
<p>I have evidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually in a car.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like drug deals.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I go to your house, you&rsquo;re a drug dealer.</p>
<p>I say, and you can understand the reasoning, well, if someone is getting profit through</p>
<p>illegal mechanisms, their profit isn&rsquo;t really their property and they shouldn&rsquo;t be rewarded</p>
<p>that profit.</p>
<p>So basically, I go to your house, you&rsquo;re a drug dealer, I seize all your property.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really have recourse, even though you haven&rsquo;t been through deep, I&rsquo;m just explaining</p>
<p>to the audience, through the new process and SOL.</p>
<p>That combined, for people who don&rsquo;t know, is more than the total amount of burglaries</p>
<p>in America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge incentive.</p>
<p>And what happens is the police department, which seizes your car auctions, it sees your</p>
<p>house auctions, it&rsquo;s a great way to line their pockets.</p>
<p>This is a huge incentive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge incentive for police departments to do this because it&rsquo;s like, look, this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a crook.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s not a drug dealer, but he&rsquo;s clearly a pimp.</p>
<p>Let me just take all his stuff and it&rsquo;s going to go to the community.</p>
<p>Well, and the rationale originally was if I try him, in the meantime, he&rsquo;ll take that</p>
<p>money and funnel it somewhere else and hide it, and I&rsquo;ll never be able to get access to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And it was passed in the 1970s under the original Caesar Laws, what kind of RICO Act, going</p>
<p>after the mafia.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons I despise Giuliani as much as I do, and there&rsquo;s very few politicians</p>
<p>out there that I despise more, is because he was the first guy to use RICO on financiers.</p>
<p>And so it wasn&rsquo;t even a drug dealer.</p>
<p>It was you accused of a financial fraud, not you weren&rsquo;t shown to be guilty, you were accused.</p>
<p>All your assets basically were forfeiture.</p>
<p>Innocent until proven guilty went out the window.</p>
<p>If you were managing money, you were done.</p>
<p>You were finished.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying this kind of stuff naturally emerges with the state.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>So my point is what are presented as the strongest criticism of anarchism are inevitably descriptions</p>
<p>of status quo.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re describing is already the event.</p>
<p>I am a big insurance company.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pay you.</p>
<p>I call Washington.</p>
<p>Either I pay you and Washington gives me a subsidy.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re describing is an inevitable aspect of having a government.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m describing is the inevitable evolution of anarchy into a government.</p>
<p>I just think that the&hellip;</p>
<p>Markets don&rsquo;t consolidate into monopoly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a leftist propaganda myth.</p>
<p>Not markets where you have substitute products, but this is the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is force has no substitute.</p>
<p>That is force is not a product you can have.</p>
<p>So this is my fundamental issue about turning competing police forces.</p>
<p>Force is not a product.</p>
<p>Force is not a service.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a service.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a service.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a product.</p>
<p>Security is not a service?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, security in the context of a legal system is.</p>
<p>But this is the point.</p>
<p>The legal system, the laws are not a service or a product.</p>
<p>They are a different type of human institution.</p>
<p>Science is not a product or a service.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different type of human institution.</p>
<p>There are different types of human institutions.</p>
<p>Some are marketable.</p>
<p>You can create markets in, some you cannot.</p>
<p>Law is not a marketable system.</p>
<p>Can I ask a question quickly?</p>
<p>Is there any other field other than law that you think you can&rsquo;t create markets?</p>
<p>Well, science.</p>
<p>Science is not marketable.</p>
<p>The science itself is not marketable.</p>
<p>What science is true and the same ethic is in law.</p>
<p>Law is not marketable.</p>
<p>Law is the system that allows markets to happen.</p>
<p>You need a system of law, whether it&rsquo;s private law in a particular narrow context or whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s broader law.</p>
<p>Law is the context in which markets arise.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons we transact is we know that there&rsquo;s a certain contract between us,</p>
<p>explicit or implicit, that is protected by a certain law, whether it&rsquo;s protected by private</p>
<p>agency or private, the government doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a certain contract that is protectable, right?</p>
<p>By a system.</p>
<p>Theoretically.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So law is the context in which markets arise.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t create a market because there&rsquo;s nothing above it, in a sense.</p>
<p>It is the context that allows markets to be created.</p>
<p>Once you market it, markets fall apart.</p>
<p>So hold on a second.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>So you think that law could be a market?</p>
<p>And it already is a market.</p>
<p>And we see it, for example, eBay.</p>
<p>If I am buying something from Yaron, I won&rsquo;t even know his name.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s in another country.</p>
<p>And he screws me out of the money.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t sue you.</p>
<p>Or if I sue you in England, good luck with that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to argue that I&rsquo;m going to sue you.</p>
<p>What happens in this case, which has already been solved by the market, eBay and PayPal,</p>
<p>which has access to your bank account, they act as the private arbiter.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to get it wrong a lot.</p>
<p>Not even a question, just like Yaron&rsquo;s not going to argue that the government right now</p>
<p>gets it wrong a lot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even a question.</p>
<p>The point is, at the very least, I&rsquo;m going to get my resolution faster, cheaper, and</p>
<p>more effectively.</p>
<p>So the issue with having any kind of government, anything, and Yaron&rsquo;s not going to disagree</p>
<p>with this, is at the very least, it&rsquo;s going to be expensive, inefficient, and cause conflict.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think what it allows is exactly&hellip;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know what the Supreme Court&rsquo;s going to judge.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re moving us to today&rsquo;s environment, which I&rsquo;m against.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving us to reality.</p>
<p>No, but reality doesn&rsquo;t have to be what it is.</p>
<p>I mean, go ahead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most anti Iran quote.</p>
<p>No, in a sense of the politics, the political reality.</p>
<p>I know, but the quote by itself is great.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d love to&hellip;</p>
<p>He agrees with Donald Hoffman is what he said.</p>
<p>Yeah, it turns out I agree with Hoffman.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an elf.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Where were we?</p>
<p>So I believe that because we have a certain system of government, it allows for these</p>
<p>private innovations to come about that facilitates certain issues in a much more efficient way</p>
<p>than the government would deal with it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s only because we have a particular system that has defined property rights, that</p>
<p>has a clear view of what property rights are, it has a clear view of what a transaction</p>
<p>mean or what contract law is, and eBay has a bunch of stuff that you sign, whether you</p>
<p>read it or not.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>The fact is defined first, and then there are massive innovations at the level of particular</p>
<p>transactions at the level of an eBay that facilitate increased efficiency.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But the fact is none of that gets developed.</p>
<p>None of that gets created.</p>
<p>In a world in which I might be living under different definition of property rights, eBay</p>
<p>might be living under separate definition of property rights.</p>
<p>You might have a third definition of property rights, and there&rsquo;s no mechanism by which</p>
<p>we can actually operationalize that because we all have a different system.</p>
<p>There is a mechanism.</p>
<p>We already have that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change the example I just used.</p>
<p>What happens if a Chinese person who has different definition of property rights kills an American</p>
<p>in Brazil?</p>
<p>Again, in a smaller community, what happens is lots of violence.</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;m talking right now.</p>
<p>A Chinese person has&hellip;</p>
<p>Right now, the only reason that it doesn&rsquo;t lead to violence is because people are afraid</p>
<p>of even more violence, and it affects many people, large numbers of people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to go to war.</p>
<p>But if you have small&hellip;</p>
<p>In a state where the states were small, in those little states, there was war all the</p>
<p>time for exactly those reasons, because the cost was lower, because it was more personal,</p>
<p>because I knew maybe the person who was killed over there, and I went to my king and encouraged</p>
<p>him to go to war.</p>
<p>You know why there was war?</p>
<p>Violence is constant.</p>
<p>You know why there was war?</p>
<p>Because there had been no Ayn Rand, and good ideas lead to good societies, which leads</p>
<p>to good people, which leads to good behavior, good interrelationships.</p>
<p>So now that we have Ayn Rand, all this stuff in the past is irrelevant, because if they</p>
<p>studied her works, we would be&hellip;</p>
<p>Rand was on Donahue again, you could watch the clip, and he asks her, she goes&hellip;</p>
<p>He goes, you&rsquo;re saying that if we were more selfish and acted more self interest, there&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be less war, less Hitler?</p>
<p>And she said, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Well, if we were all selfish, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any Hitlers, right?</p>
<p>But who do you regard as the overweening authority if I am buying a product from you as someone</p>
<p>in England via eBay?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the governing authority?</p>
<p>The governing authority are the legal systems in England and the United States, which have</p>
<p>to be synchronized pretty well.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So why eBay doesn&rsquo;t function in certain countries, because there is no legal system.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>My point is, why do those legal systems have to be a function specifically of geography,</p>
<p>as opposed to, why can&rsquo;t I sitting here&hellip;</p>
<p>I could sit here, you&rsquo;re not going to let me finish my point.</p>
<p>I can sit here and be a British diplomat, right?</p>
<p>And as a British diplomat, I&rsquo;m going to be treated differently under American law than</p>
<p>you are as an American citizen as you are.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you have that same process, sure, we&rsquo;re geographically proximate, but I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>citizen of this company and you&rsquo;re a citizen of that company?</p>
<p>Why would that be different in your opinion?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s England and the United States, it&rsquo;s probably not going to matter that much, right?</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s Iran and the United States, then the fact that we&rsquo;re sitting next to each other</p>
<p>makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>Oh, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Massive difference.</p>
<p>The fact is that, and Ayn Rand, I think would be the first technologist and this is why</p>
<p>she was so opposed to anarchy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not why.</p>
<p>It is why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of Rothbard.</p>
<p>No, it has nothing to do with&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing?</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with Rothbard.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>How would you know?</p>
<p>Because her argument against anarchy is an intellectual one, not a personality based</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t it be both?</p>
<p>Anyway, but back to it, back to Iran.</p>
<p>No, it has nothing to do with Rothbard.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know that, you&rsquo;re not a psychic or a necromancer.</p>
<p>The only way we&rsquo;re going to resolve this is arm wrestling, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s through violence.</p>
<p>Arm wrestling is not violence.</p>
<p>Words are violence.</p>
<p>Words are violence, everyone.</p>
<p>Words are violence.</p>
<p>Emotions are violence.</p>
<p>He throws me off with this stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Even facts and truth?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very, very good.</p>
<p>Not facts and truth.</p>
<p>Distortions and arbitrary statements, because your statement about Rothbard is an arbitrary</p>
<p>statement that has no cognitive standing and therefore I can dismiss it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing like this because I want to dismiss it.</p>
<p>It has no cognitive status.</p>
<p>The fact that she disliked Rothbard doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything he said she was going</p>
<p>to dismiss because she disliked it.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is it would not be impossible.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no evidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you some evidence.</p>
<p>Human psychology.</p>
<p>It is not impossible that if you hate some&hellip; What&rsquo;s that guy&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>Richard Wolff.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not impossible that if Richard Wolff said something that you would otherwise agree</p>
<p>with, hold on, let me finish, you&rsquo;d be dismissive or less likely to give him credit for it being</p>
<p>a human being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as silly as to say Rothbard came up with this theory of anarchy because he was pissed</p>
<p>off at Ayn Rand and wanted to write something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Bring it down.</p>
<p>Bring it down so that he can speak too and let&rsquo;s keep it&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re getting agitated.</p>
<p>No, you guys aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, bring it down not in terms of give more pauses so Michael can insert himself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>See, private governance.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of that?</p>
<p>Private governance.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s private governance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for private governance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to establish this geographic law of the land.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>I do think that Michael&rsquo;s&hellip; I mean, that&rsquo;s interesting that you disagree with this.</p>
<p>I do believe that psychology has an impact on ideas and Ayn Rand, you don&rsquo;t think Ayn</p>
<p>Rand had grudges that impacted the way she saw the world?</p>
<p>We would like to think that&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of her grudges entered into her philosophical statements, at least not</p>
<p>that I can tell, and given the centrality Ayn Rand gave to the role of government, to</p>
<p>the existence of government, to the need for government, to establish real freedom, and</p>
<p>the way she defines freedom, which is very different than Rothbard, and the way she defines</p>
<p>it, to say then that her opposition and anarchy is because of, I think, is just an arbitrary</p>
<p>statement.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say because of.</p>
<p>I said followed by.</p>
<p>And not, and I don&rsquo;t see why psychology would enter it.</p>
<p>Now, maybe the tone in which you responded to an answer might have been motivated by</p>
<p>that or something like that, but given the amount of thought she gave to the role of</p>
<p>government in human society and why government was needed, and why you needed laws in order</p>
<p>to be free, that freedom didn&rsquo;t proceed, you needed the right hierarchy, I think that we</p>
<p>could say that it, give it at least a respect that she might have been wrong, but she had</p>
<p>a particular theory that rejected anarchy, and that thought anarchy was wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, hold on.</p>
<p>I really resent, and I don&rsquo;t want to say you&rsquo;re doing this, the implication that if Rand was</p>
<p>guided by her passions, that somehow is a criticism of her or lessens her.</p>
<p>I think Rand was a very passionate person.</p>
<p>I think she loved her husband enormously.</p>
<p>She despised certain people enormously, and I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s anything wrong</p>
<p>with that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she would change her philosophical position about something because she disliked</p>
<p>somebody.</p>
<p>I agree, but what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Given the amount of thought she gave to that philosophical position.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is, it is possible that if someone comes across ideas that she had not</p>
<p>considered before, if she regarded this person as a bad actor, like all of us, she would</p>
<p>be less likely to take them under consideration.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And I think other people confronted her with ideas of anarchy, I don&rsquo;t think Rothbard was</p>
<p>the only one.</p>
<p>Correct, Roy Charles as well, yeah.</p>
<p>Roy Charles certainly did.</p>
<p>And she rejected them, and she rejected them because she had, and whether you agree with</p>
<p>or not, she had a thought out position about why you needed to have this particular structure</p>
<p>in place so that markets and human freedom could exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really interesting because this is the one time, in my view, and please correct</p>
<p>me if I&rsquo;m wrong, where she invokes need as kind of a basis for political activity.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s suppose you want this federal government, whatever you want, you don&rsquo;t want it like</p>
<p>it is now, like your version of the government, I don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s an issue for you for</p>
<p>me and Lex to say, we&rsquo;re not privy to Washington, we&rsquo;re going to do our own thing, and given,</p>
<p>if we go about our lives not initiating force and being productive actors, why she would</p>
<p>have an issue with this.</p>
<p>Why would I care?</p>
<p>Well, you would care because if you&rsquo;re saying the government has a monopoly on force between</p>
<p>these two oceans.</p>
<p>So you can do that as long as you don&rsquo;t violate somebody else&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>Sure, but what I&rsquo;m saying is we just declare ourselves sovereign, we&rsquo;re not going to pay</p>
<p>any income taxes, we&rsquo;re going to be peaceful people, and when Lex and I have disputes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to call Joe, that&rsquo;s Joe Rogan, you&rsquo;re never going to get to meet him, but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good guy.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to call Joe, and Joe&rsquo;s going to resolve it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so good at like, you know, needling and getting you off topic that way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really effective at it.</p>
<p>I always say, when I debate communists, I always say to them&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean Lex?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe Lex.</p>
<p>Maybe I should&hellip;</p>
<p>Comrade, I love you.</p>
<p>That if they really believe&hellip;</p>
<p>Burgundy, not red.</p>
<p>If they really believe in what they think, then they should be advocates of capitalism,</p>
<p>because under capitalism, under my system of government, capitalist government, right,</p>
<p>they could go and start a commune, they can live with communists, they can live to each</p>
<p>according to his needs, from each according to his ability, all they want, and live their</p>
<p>pathetic miserable lives that way, and the government would never intervene, because</p>
<p>the whole view of capitalism is freedom, is we leave it alone, right?</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re not violating my rights, as long as you&rsquo;re not taking my property,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not engaging with&hellip;</p>
<p>So in that sense, yeah, you and Lex can form your own thing, I don&rsquo;t believe in compulsory</p>
<p>taxes anyway, so you and Lex can do your own thing, never pay taxes, as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not violating the laws, and the laws are very limited, right, because they&rsquo;re only there</p>
<p>to protect individual rights, so as long as you&rsquo;re not violating somebody else&rsquo;s property</p>
<p>rights or inflicting force on anybody else, you&rsquo;re peaceful, you can do what you want,</p>
<p>you know, don&rsquo;t have&hellip;</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Case placed.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have sex with kids, right?</p>
<p>I will stop immediately.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>The rest of us are just playing checkers and he&rsquo;s playing chess.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, a government that protects individual rights properly is a government</p>
<p>that leaves you alone to live your life as you see fit, even if you live your life in</p>
<p>a way that I don&rsquo;t approve of, that I don&rsquo;t think is right, I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole point,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So the only thing you can do is, you know, try to enforce arbitrary laws that you come</p>
<p>up with on me.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if we lived in a world where rights protecting laws are superfluous,</p>
<p>but the reality is usually that somebody violates them, whether by accident or intentionally,</p>
<p>and that you need some mechanism, now if you guys can resolve that dispute without getting</p>
<p>involved, fine.</p>
<p>But if you guys land up not resolving, there is another authority that will help you resolve</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Yeah, our company.</p>
<p>So can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Under anarchism, what kind of systems of laws do you think will emerge?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll have basically a similar kind of layer of universal law to where, like&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me answer this.</p>
<p>This is a great question.</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re going with this.</p>
<p>This is often presented as a criticism of anarchism, and this is actually something</p>
<p>I think Yaron would agree with as well in other contexts, which is this.</p>
<p>One of the reasons communism can&rsquo;t work, central planning can&rsquo;t work, and this was one of Mises&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great innovations, is if I could sit down, it&rsquo;s like asking, what would the fashion industry</p>
<p>look like if the government didn&rsquo;t run it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way for me to know.</p>
<p>What the fashion industry is, which all of us are in favor of it being free, is literally</p>
<p>millions of designers, of seamstresses, of people who make the fabric, also references</p>
<p>throughout history, and these creative artistic minds putting things together in every year.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of clothes.</p>
<p>In fact, we make so many clothes that we send them in landfill sizes to overseas poor countries,</p>
<p>and you have people in these destitute countries wearing Adidas shirts.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even read English, but because we don&rsquo;t know what to do with all these clothes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the glory of free enterprise is.</p>
<p>The problem is, problem using this loosely, everything comes cheap and overabundant, like</p>
<p>food.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t actually come overabundant, but it&rsquo;s done properly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>Supply meets demand.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, if 150 years ago you said, you know, one day we&rsquo;re going to have an issue</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s going to be so much food and then the kids are too fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to be like, I have four who are dead in the crib.</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>I mean, what kind of paradise is this?</p>
<p>What you would have, we have this right now in certain senses, you have the Hasidim, you</p>
<p>have Sharia, I&rsquo;m sure in the medical system, they have their own kind of private courts</p>
<p>and court marshals is another example of this, although obviously that&rsquo;s through the state.</p>
<p>So you would have innovation in law, under markets, just the same ways you&rsquo;d have it.</p>
<p>And we have this already.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not, Yaron doesn&rsquo;t like in terms of murder and rape and I can understand why,</p>
<p>but in terms of business and interactions, he would have no problem with different arbitration</p>
<p>firms, having different rules for what kind of evidence is allowed.</p>
<p>Maybe you only have 60 days to make your case and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And the market is a process of creative innovation and it would be dynamic.</p>
<p>It would be changing.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting relating to this is that one of the ways Ayn Rand proposed raising</p>
<p>revenue for the government, because she was against, was let&rsquo;s say we have a contract.</p>
<p>We could just have it arbitrated without government interfering, but if we wanted to access the</p>
<p>courts of the government as a final authority, we would pay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how governments would raise, some of the funds would be raised that way.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely a value to having this innovation and the public space.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t believe that is the case with murder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that is the case with violent crime.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny you bring up Sharia because David Friedman, when he gives, when he gives</p>
<p>Wait, I got to ask you to clarify.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to interrupt you.</p>
<p>You were talking about with murder.</p>
<p>I mean, you would agree, I think just to clarify for the audience, that there is room for innovation</p>
<p>and murder because there&rsquo;s things like matter of slaughter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s murder one, murder two.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it happens at a market level.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a market innovation for murder.</p>
<p>Somebody has to figure out what those standards are and they will evolve as we gain more knowledge.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re all in agreement that the word murder means very different things.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>And if circumstances matter and standards of proof and standards of evidence, all of</p>
<p>that, there has to be a standard.</p>
<p>All of that, there has to be a standard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think a proper government provides.</p>
<p>So David Friedman uses, in some of his talks about private law, he uses Sharia law in Somalia</p>
<p>as an example.</p>
<p>Look, legal systems evolve privately, independent, yeah, authoritarian ones, ones that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>respect the rights of women at all.</p>
<p>Are you married?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But we all want to have sex with our mother, as Freud would say.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Can we make that a clip?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where the hell did that come from?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much better than what I was just saying about the kids.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we went in a voluntary way, although sometimes for Yaron and sometimes for Michael it felt</p>
<p>involuntary, but we all got the big guns.</p>
<p>So how do we land this?</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s a disagreement about anarchism here.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a big agreement.</p>
<p>Because if Yaron was saying that if I want to have my voluntary stupid thing with you,</p>
<p>and his government is not going to tax me, and is not going to insinuate itself unless</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re murdering each other, something like that, I&rsquo;m okay with that.</p>
<p>So if you take the example of Sharia law, which was mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>So if you have a little community within this, within my world, right, that imposes Sharia</p>
<p>law, if it starts mutilating little girls, then you impose your law on it, right?</p>
<p>You impose the law on it because it&rsquo;s an issue of protecting individual rights.</p>
<p>If they want to treat women, if women have to cover up, and the women are okay with that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>If the woman wants to leave but is not allowed to leave, that&rsquo;s where my government would</p>
<p>step in and prevent them from using force against her.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>Now I think it&rsquo;s more complicated than that, right?</p>
<p>Because I think there are complex issue property rights often where it&rsquo;s not going to be easy</p>
<p>for you guys to resolve, and particularly if you interact with people outside of your</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But yeah, my view is government is there to protect individual rights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, leave you alone.</p>
<p>I think this conversation is going to continue for quite a while.</p>
<p>Israel has a new book on the topic coming out eventually, one day.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re working also on the, still called the White Pill?</p>
<p>The White Pill, yeah.</p>
<p>And the first line of the White Pill is, Ayn Rand did not laugh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not joking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally the first line.</p>
<p>I believe it.</p>
<p>Because it opens up with her, who knows what the book&rsquo;s going to look like when it&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>but as of now, that&rsquo;s the beginning, because it opens up with her testimony at the House</p>
<p>UnAmerican Activities Committee, where she&rsquo;s trying to explain to these congresspeople</p>
<p>what it was like when she left the Soviet Union, and they are just befuddled by it.</p>
<p>Can you explain she did not laugh?</p>
<p>Well, because the first line of the Fountainhead, spoiler alert, is Howard Rourke laughed.</p>
<p>So this is a little inversion of that.</p>
<p>It says Ayn Rand did not laugh, because Ayn Rand was a huge fan of America, as am I.</p>
<p>She took our political system very seriously.</p>
<p>She had enormous reverence for institutions.</p>
<p>One example of this is one of the villains of the Atlas Shrugged is based on Harry Truman.</p>
<p>I think Thompson is the character&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>And because she had such respect for the title of president, she refers to him as the chairman.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t even bring herself&hellip;</p>
<p>She had a huge respect for the presidency.</p>
<p>I wonder if she&rsquo;d still have it, given the last string of presidents we&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>So having her, which sets up the broader point of the book, which I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be back on</p>
<p>the show to discuss, assuming this bridge hasn&rsquo;t been burned, but I&rsquo;ll try my best.</p>
<p>All three of us are canceled.</p>
<p>Some are more canceled than the others.</p>
<p>Uh oh.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at you, Michael.</p>
<p>And the point being, which sets up the broader point of the book, is how ignorant many people</p>
<p>are in the West about the horrors of Stalinism and communism, but also how many people in</p>
<p>the West were complicit in saying to Americans, go home, everything&rsquo;s fine, this is great,</p>
<p>sure, you know, this is why pensions have a race, they&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;re mistakes.</p>
<p>And they really made a point to downplay really gratuitously some of the unimaginable atrocities</p>
<p>of the communism.</p>
<p>And just one more sentence, and going through the work and learning about what they actually</p>
<p>did is so jaw dropping that it&rsquo;s, and if I didn&rsquo;t know about it, many people I&rsquo;m friends</p>
<p>with who are historians who entered the space, you know, this isn&rsquo;t common knowledge to them,</p>
<p>then we can assume that almost no one knows about it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very important for people to appreciate whether Republican, Democrat,</p>
<p>liberal, whatever, how much of a danger this is.</p>
<p>And I think Americans have this, there&rsquo;s a book called It Can&rsquo;t Happen Here, I think</p>
<p>by Sinclair Lewis about a fascism coming to America.</p>
<p>American exceptionalism has a positive context, but also a negative context where you think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re invincible, all these horrible things that happen in these other countries, it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>possibly happen here, we&rsquo;re America, we&rsquo;re special, and it&rsquo;s completely an absurdity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you seen the movie, Mr. Jones?</p>
<p>My friend wrote it, no I haven&rsquo;t, but Walter Durante and his quotes, I have a thread on</p>
<p>Twitter.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, he won a Pulitzer because he was the New York Times man in Moscow.</p>
<p>And endlessly, he was talking about how great it was, how if you hear about this famine</p>
<p>in Ukraine, this is just propaganda, I went to the villages, you know, everyone&rsquo;s happy</p>
<p>and fed.</p>
<p>A lot of it was explicit lies, you know, and when you realize you&rsquo;re talking about, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>give them the absolute benefit of the doubt, an accidental genocide, it&rsquo;s still mind boggling.</p>
<p>And also, you know, Ann Applebaum, who&rsquo;s just a phenomenal, phenomenal writer, she wrote</p>
<p>a book called Red Famine, Stalin&rsquo;s War in Ukraine, and she talks about how what people</p>
<p>in America don&rsquo;t appreciate is how clever in their sadism the Soviets were.</p>
<p>And what they knew to do to Ukraine is everyone is starving, so they knew if you got some</p>
<p>meat on your bones, you&rsquo;re hiding food.</p>
<p>So they come back at night, take your hand, put in the door jam, keep slamming the door,</p>
<p>ransack your house.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to find the food, burn down your house, take all your clothes, goodbye</p>
<p>and good luck.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall saying good luck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I highly recommend the movie because it&rsquo;s very well done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very well directed, it&rsquo;s beautifully made, it&rsquo;s stunningly effective in illustrating</p>
<p>exactly that.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in Ukraine during the famine, oh, your heart goes, I mean, it&rsquo;s crushing.</p>
<p>And it shifts to black and white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very well made aesthetically, so highly recommend.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s written by Andriusha Lupa, she&rsquo;s a Ukrainian friend of mine, she introduced</p>
<p>me, Yanmi Park, who&rsquo;s a big North Korean defector.</p>
<p>And this is the kind of thing where I think more people need to&hellip;</p>
<p>When I wrote the new write, which talks a lot about the Nazis or the kind of neo Nazis,</p>
<p>on their big complaints against people who are Jewish, she&rsquo;s like, oh, we hear all about</p>
<p>the Holocaust.</p>
<p>How come you don&rsquo;t talk about the Holodomor?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m trying to do my part.</p>
<p>I agree with you that we need to be talking more about the Holodomor.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad, there are more movies that are anti Soviet, which tells you a lot about the</p>
<p>view of the intelligentsia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great idea, it just was badly implemented.</p>
<p>And no, it&rsquo;s a rotten idea, it&rsquo;s an evil idea, and it was implemented exactly how it has</p>
<p>to be implemented.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no alternative.</p>
<p>Can we talk about The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and which character do you find</p>
<p>most fascinating, ones that kind of you meet in your own mind, that you almost have conversations</p>
<p>with or has an influence on you and your life in general?</p>
<p>You know what character I like, because I know no one ever gives this answer, but this</p>
<p>is my&hellip;</p>
<p>Just aesthetically, you know how sometimes you&rsquo;re drawn to a character and if this person</p>
<p>were real, you think they&rsquo;re just horrible, but there&rsquo;s something about the resonates</p>
<p>with you.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even explain this, but I love the character in Atlas Shrugged of Lillian Reardon,</p>
<p>who is Hank Reardon&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>And what is amazing about her, so she&rsquo;s his wife, he&rsquo;s this big industrialist innovator,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s this like former beauty, but she&rsquo;s so cold and soulless that there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I joke about, you know, Ayn Rand&rsquo;s vampire novels, that character is as close</p>
<p>to a literal vampire as you&rsquo;re going to see in Rand.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just this great scene where, you know, Hank Reardon invents Reardon metal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this great metal, which is extremely strong, but extremely, it&rsquo;s like light, so</p>
<p>this creates all these innovations.</p>
<p>And he brings her a bracelet made of the first Reardon metal.</p>
<p>This is his life goal.</p>
<p>This is like Prometheus bringing fire.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what the fuck is this?</p>
<p>You brought me diamonds.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could have brought me diamonds.</p>
<p>What is this shit?</p>
<p>And then Dagny, who is another industrialist, she&rsquo;s a heroine, very strong female character</p>
<p>in Atlas Shrugged, is at a party, and she goes, I got diamonds, let&rsquo;s trade.</p>
<p>And Lillian&rsquo;s like, you want this?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, yes, because that&rsquo;s the concretization of the human mind.</p>
<p>These are rocks.</p>
<p>And Lillian&rsquo;s like, okay, whatever.</p>
<p>And that character is someone who has a lot of resonance in our culture, this kind of</p>
<p>soulless&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to write a soulless male figure, like Peter Keating in some ways a soulless,</p>
<p>but that for some reason, when it&rsquo;s like a soulless female, it seems that much more chilling</p>
<p>and effective.</p>
<p>Do you not agree though, that Lillian Reardon is an amazingly very powerful figure?</p>
<p>Powerful figure.</p>
<p>And I think Reardon is too.</p>
<p>And what I love about Reardon is his evolution, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so flawed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a hero who&rsquo;s completely flawed, and it drives me nuts when people say, her characters</p>
<p>are cartoonish, they never change, there&rsquo;s no emotion.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Did you read the same book I did?</p>
<p>Because if you take Reardon, and he&rsquo;s struggling and he&rsquo;s trying to deal with Lillian and his</p>
<p>family and all this stuff, and we know family members like this, right?</p>
<p>I mean, who are leeches and parasites, but he&rsquo;s excusing them because that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to do.</p>
<p>And then as he evolves to fully realize what&rsquo;s going on, that evolution is difficult, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard.</p>
<p>Like the scene after he has sex with Dagny, of course, he gives a speech, but the speeches</p>
<p>is such a good speech in terms of conveying his mind body split, right?</p>
<p>He thinks he really had fun, he really enjoyed the sex, right?</p>
<p>But he thinks it&rsquo;s animalistic, and he thinks it&rsquo;s a sign of his depravity, and he thinks,</p>
<p>and here he is, this woman he loves, and he adores her, and he can&rsquo;t connect the two,</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t connect the sex with the love, he can&rsquo;t connect the sex with adoration, and</p>
<p>with the values.</p>
<p>So her characters are anything I think but cardboard characters, because I think Dagny</p>
<p>and the scenes where she&rsquo;s listening to music, and gets captured by the music and the way</p>
<p>Wren describes that, I think it&rsquo;s just beautiful.</p>
<p>Or the scene, my favorite scene in Atlas is the scene where they&rsquo;re taking the first train</p>
<p>ride across the John Gold Bridge, and they&rsquo;re in the engine room, and it&rsquo;s traveling through,</p>
<p>and the way she&rsquo;s describing Dagny, it&rsquo;s almost like Dagny&rsquo;s having sex with the machine,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so powerful emotionally, their success, the fact that they did it.</p>
<p>Nobody told them it was impossible, and the train is going really fast, and that whole,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got a sexual vibe to it, it&rsquo;s all about passion, it&rsquo;s all about success, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all about the success of their minds, and nobody else matters.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really great about that scene, just in terms of constructing the novel, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to spoil anything, so the Atlas Shrugged has three acts, like three act structures</p>
<p>not uncommon, and the first act is about Hank Reardon overcoming all this adversity</p>
<p>at home in his personal life and in his business to create this great achievement.</p>
<p>So Rand really makes the reader invested in this character and his accomplishments, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unambiguously doing something good, there&rsquo;s no downside here, he&rsquo;s making it easier to</p>
<p>transport people, transport food, this is really just great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, once you read it and you look back, you&rsquo;re like, she does such a masterful</p>
<p>job of making, you have to be a fan of this person and root for them, because she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, you think things are going great, he&rsquo;s overcome?</p>
<p>Hold on a minute.</p>
<p>And then the rest of it, she&rsquo;s just real, and your sense of injustice is triggered as</p>
<p>a reader to such an nth degree, because you saw what he went through to get to this point,</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re seeing it taken away from people inferior to him.</p>
<p>And one of the quotes on Twitter I use all the time is, I&rsquo;ll see someone, politician</p>
<p>or a bureaucrat or a thinker, just advocate for something completely unconscionable.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just quote and say, my favorite criticism of Ayn Rand is that they say her villains</p>
<p>are too evil and unrealistic, because the things that people posit with a straight face</p>
<p>are so much worse than she has in her book.</p>
<p>And not just politicians, you find intellectuals today.</p>
<p>Oh, of course.</p>
<p>So yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Way, way over the top.</p>
<p>You know, even whenever Adlai Shrugged I was going, nobody really talks like this.</p>
<p>No, they do.</p>
<p>Let me give you one example.</p>
<p>There was a story she wrote, which she never published, they published her journals, the</p>
<p>Ayn Rand Institute.</p>
<p>And there was one character, and this is a prototype of Ellsworth Toohey, he was the</p>
<p>villain of one of the villains of the Fountainhead.</p>
<p>And basically, the kid had like deformed legs or broke his legs or something like that.</p>
<p>And he wants to get leg braces.</p>
<p>And the dad is like, Oh, we&rsquo;re not going to do that.</p>
<p>Why should you be better than anyone else?</p>
<p>Like you should just have like this deformity, accept your fate.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re reading this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what dad is not going to give his kid leg braces, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s not uncommon for deaf children to not get cochlear implants and not be able</p>
<p>to hear because their parents say, well, we&rsquo;re going to lose deaf culture.</p>
<p>Hearing is just information.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re sitting there, and whether you agree with this or not, this is very close</p>
<p>to what she was saying.</p>
<p>And when I read what she was saying, I&rsquo;m like, okay, crazy Ayn Rand, this is not a thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh, yeah, the craziness is that it&rsquo;s not braces, it&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yeah.</p>
<p>And what evil to deny your kid hearing.</p>
<p>I mean, God.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing, if you want deaf culture, which I would believe is a thing, sign language</p>
<p>or whatever, they could turn it off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you want, you give them the choice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tonight, I&rsquo;m sorry, one more thing.</p>
<p>You know, Rand used the word evil frequently.</p>
<p>And I think maybe I can make the argument she used it too loosely.</p>
<p>If you are denying a child the gift of music, I will say that&rsquo;s evil.</p>
<p>I agree completely.</p>
<p>Unambiguously.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>If you go online and listen, watch videos of people getting hearing aids and being able</p>
<p>to hear for the first time, I promise you, you will cry because there&rsquo;s no pure, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting teared up right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pure expression of humanity and technology at its best than seeing a two year</p>
<p>old or one and a half year old who can&rsquo;t even talk.</p>
<p>And then you see the reaction when they hear mom&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so beautiful and moving.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just moving.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s one of the, one of the ways to rethink technology, perhaps.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this, this is really funny because sometimes it&rsquo;ll be this tough dude, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been deaf all his life.</p>
<p>And then they put the hearing aid and the girl is like, can you hear me?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s trying to be tough for three seconds and you just sit there.</p>
<p>No, absolutely.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true of any sense.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Like colorblind people seeing color for the first time, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a few.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite the same, but it&rsquo;s somewhat.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re blind and suddenly can see, I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just stunning.</p>
<p>I mean, and how do we form our concepts?</p>
<p>How do we think?</p>
<p>We have to, we get information from reality, right?</p>
<p>We interact with reality through our senses and that&rsquo;s how we become conceptual beings.</p>
<p>And you deny an element of that from a human being.</p>
<p>That is horrible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a potential with that, with the Neuralink too, so further developments there.</p>
<p>So I mean on that, there&rsquo;s a powerful question of who is John Galt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we can do this without spoiler alerts.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t spoil the book.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, but you can say, you can say.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the importance of this character?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the importance of this question?</p>
<p>I mean, without the, so I want to give a talk on who is John Galt and who is John Galt in</p>
<p>a sense is anybody who takes their own life seriously.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s willing to really live fully their own life, use their mind in pursuit</p>
<p>of their rational values and pursue their happiness fully uncompromisingly with no comp,</p>
<p>with no compromise and sticking to the integrity.</p>
<p>Anybody can be John Galt in that sense.</p>
<p>I think one of the mottos I live by is all we are tasked to, maybe this is a little bit</p>
<p>religious but I think your own is going to agree with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree with it.</p>
<p>All any of us can do is leave the world a little bit of a better place than we found</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I think if you do that through hard work, being honest, being a kind, not at the expense</p>
<p>of other people, you can go to your grave patting yourself on the back.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, leaving the world a better place, yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s not what drives</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>What drives me is, I mean, what I think drives people.</p>
<p>I think just live a good life and good life means a life you&rsquo;re happy living and part</p>
<p>of that is the impact you have on the world but it&rsquo;s, so many people live wasted lives,</p>
<p>live mediocre lives, live conventional lives.</p>
<p>Maybe they even leave the world a better place but they didn&rsquo;t really, they didn&rsquo;t ‚Äì</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t leave the world a better place.</p>
<p>They left the world a better place but they didn&rsquo;t live their potential or they died</p>
<p>feeling guilty about it or they ‚Äì a million different things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many productive people.</p>
<p>I mean, think about all the innovators and the technologists and the businessmen who</p>
<p>leave the world a better place by a big shot but are never happy.</p>
<p>Never happy in their own souls, in their own life.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s what counts and if you&rsquo;re going to be happy, you&rsquo;ll leave the better</p>
<p>world a better place.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Jean Val symbolizes.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s living your life by your standards, by your values and pursuing that happiness.</p>
<p>Well, I take ‚Äì I&rsquo;m sorry, I take in a different context because I think a lot of ‚Äì and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to disagree with this.</p>
<p>I think a lot of times when you&rsquo;re young, you have unrealistic expectations about what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to accomplish and you think to yourself, well, I thought, let&rsquo;s suppose</p>
<p>someone wants to go into politics.</p>
<p>Well, if I&rsquo;m not elected president, I&rsquo;m a failure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nonsensical.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of people who are successful who haven&rsquo;t achieved literally the top position</p>
<p>in their role.</p>
<p>So if you can go to your grave having ‚Äì defending everything you&rsquo;ve done and you move the needle</p>
<p>in the ‚Äì</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Successes should not be relative.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So that goes back to second handedness.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Success is not being better than other people.</p>
<p>Success is not being the best.</p>
<p>Success is maximizing your potential, whatever that is.</p>
<p>And look, I know people ‚Äì I have a son who could be a really good engineer, a really</p>
<p>good mathematician, really good scientist, but he decided he wants to write comedy.</p>
<p>So he might have been a better mathematician than he is a comedian, but that&rsquo;s his values.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his goals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he wants to do.</p>
<p>And hopefully he&rsquo;ll be really, really good at that and he&rsquo;ll be incredibly successful</p>
<p>at it materially in every other sense, but that&rsquo;s what you pursue.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really being true to yourself in a deep sense.</p>
<p>And if you are true to yourself, yeah, you&rsquo;ll leave the world a better place, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the essence.</p>
<p>The essence is you.</p>
<p>No, focus on you.</p>
<p>Focus on making your life the best life that it can be.</p>
<p>And if you do that, you&rsquo;ll make the world a better place by ‚Äì almost by definition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll impact people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at the same thing in different ways.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So at least in my little corner of the world, it was disappointing how rare that is.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons I&rsquo;m here in Austin and one of the reasons my work gravitated</p>
<p>towards Elon Musk is because he represents that person for me in the world of technology,</p>
<p>in the world of CEO, in the world of business.</p>
<p>It was very surprising to me the more I&rsquo;ve learned about the world of tech, how few people</p>
<p>live unapologetically, fully to their potential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure people, others do that.</p>
<p>Maybe music and art.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about those worlds.</p>
<p>I do know about the technology world.</p>
<p>And it was disappointing to me how many people compromise their integrity in subtle ways</p>
<p>at first, but then it becomes a slippery slope and then you ‚Äì</p>
<p>Can I say this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this great quote and I always forget if it&rsquo;s Steinbeck or Hemingway and the quote</p>
<p>‚Äì and this applies for money, it applies for morality ‚Äì the quote was, how did you</p>
<p>go bankrupt?</p>
<p>And he says two ways, gradually and then suddenly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to one day be like, I have no integrity.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy if it&rsquo;s like, look, I stole this candy bar.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal if I steal this thing?</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re still ‚Äì</p>
<p>People say there are no slippery slopes.</p>
<p>There are and they&rsquo;re big and they&rsquo;re very slippery and people slide.</p>
<p>This is the biggest one.</p>
<p>And people violate their integrity even without stealing.</p>
<p>Just little things about how they treat other people, how they treat themselves, the values</p>
<p>they pursue.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go after the profession they really wanted to.</p>
<p>They compromise in ways that they shouldn&rsquo;t with their spouse or with their mothers or</p>
<p>whatever.</p>
<p>And then they wake up one day when they&rsquo;re 40.</p>
<p>And this is why people go through a midlife crisis.</p>
<p>Midlife crisis is a crisis where you suddenly realize, I didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t live up to my standards.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t live up to my youthful idealism.</p>
<p>I compromised and I sold out.</p>
<p>But I also would warn you about Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think at the top very few of them stick to it and partially it&rsquo;s the political</p>
<p>pressure is unbearable.</p>
<p>I mean, how would you?</p>
<p>How can you?</p>
<p>It would require to be a hero and very few of them are.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of people who do really well at all kinds of levels in technology</p>
<p>who ‚Äì little startups, people.</p>
<p>And this is the point Michael was making.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be the best.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t have to be a CEO to live to your max and to live with integrity</p>
<p>and to live a great life.</p>
<p>I know people who because they joined Amazon or whatever have just made a life for themselves,</p>
<p>an amazing life for themselves and have done great work at Amazon let&rsquo;s say and then</p>
<p>have lived a great life because of the opportunity that created for them.</p>
<p>So I think there are more good people out there but yes, one of the saddest things of</p>
<p>growing up is ‚Äì or even when you&rsquo;re a teenager and looking at adults and noticing</p>
<p>how few of them actually live, I mean really alive in a sense of living their values and</p>
<p>enjoying their life.</p>
<p>And you start with your parents and you look across the people, everybody lives such mediocre</p>
<p>lives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the other thing is they don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t appreciate.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Particularly not in the world that we live in today that&rsquo;s so wealthy and so many ‚Äì we</p>
<p>all have so many opportunities.</p>
<p>So what ‚Äì by way of advice, what advice would you give to young people to live their</p>
<p>life fully?</p>
<p>I mean Michael and I have talked about this but it bears repeating.</p>
<p>So if you look at John Galt, if you look at the highest ideals of what we ‚Äì of a life</p>
<p>we could live, what advice would you give to a 20 year old today, 18 year old?</p>
<p>Can I say ‚Äì I don&rsquo;t think ‚Äì and I think Rand would agree.</p>
<p>When Rand was writing John Galt, she says, when you have this character&rsquo;s human perfection,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to get too close.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a little bit of a vague character because she was aware that when you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with day to day, it kind of ‚Äì the shine comes off.</p>
<p>I think Rourke is a lot better character for a young person.</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>Yeah, but Rourke is all ‚Äì the entirety of the Fountainhead is Rourke.</p>
<p>So Ed Reardon is the one of several.</p>
<p>We barely know John Galt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So but Rourke is someone where you could be like, okay.</p>
<p>And what Rourke also gives young people is ‚Äì</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the Fountainhead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the Fountainhead, is the strength to persevere.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re going to have down times.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be times when you&rsquo;re lonely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be times when you don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be times when you&rsquo;re out of work and you&rsquo;re thinking, holy crap, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>falling between the cracks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to accomplish that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be a failure.</p>
<p>And he gives them the courage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even a scene in the Fountainhead, which is this amazing scene.</p>
<p>I love that it&rsquo;s not talked about enough where basically Rourke is looking at one of</p>
<p>his buildings and this little kid on a bicycle comes up to him and ‚Äì Yaron, please correct</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, who built this?</p>
<p>And Rourke said, I did.</p>
<p>And the line is, you know, Rourke didn&rsquo;t realize it, but he just gave that kid the</p>
<p>courage to face the lifetime.</p>
<p>And I think that is such a beautiful thing where you can find inspiration in this character.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t become needlessly difficult.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t start parroting his lines.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not Howard Rourke and he&rsquo;s not a real person.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s aspects of him that you can apply to your life.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one example because this happened to me.</p>
<p>When I was working at Goldman Sachs, I was doing tech support and my great grandmother</p>
<p>had passed away that year.</p>
<p>And I promised my grandmother I would have ‚Äì I&rsquo;ve told this story several times.</p>
<p>I would have Thanksgiving dinner with her.</p>
<p>I was working second shift, fort to midnight, and we were a 24 seven help desk.</p>
<p>And I got the schedule for the next week and I sold my grandmother to have lunch with</p>
<p>her at Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>And they had put me down from fort to midnight the day before Wednesday, which is my normal</p>
<p>shift, but then the day shift the next day.</p>
<p>And I go to my boss, I go ‚Äì first off, second shift, I&rsquo;m like, this Thanksgiving, I promised</p>
<p>my grandma.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, if you could find someone to fill this, we&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And I asked everyone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, no.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m not coming in.</p>
<p>And I 100%, not even a question, if I asked my grandmother, can we have dinner instead,</p>
<p>she would have said yes.</p>
<p>But this was one of those moments, maybe this is from my huge ego where I felt like I was</p>
<p>in a movie and I&rsquo;m making a choice.</p>
<p>Am I going to ask grandma?</p>
<p>Or am I going to just bend the knee?</p>
<p>And I go, I go, I couldn&rsquo;t find anyone and I go, I&rsquo;m not coming in.</p>
<p>And they go, if you&rsquo;re not coming in, you&rsquo;re fired.</p>
<p>And I go, fire me.</p>
<p>And they did fire me.</p>
<p>And I have no regrets.</p>
<p>And because if I compromised, I&rsquo;d have money in my pocket.</p>
<p>But since I didn&rsquo;t compromise, I could look at that story.</p>
<p>Rand talks about how man is a being of self made soul.</p>
<p>I could look at that story, and next time, I have a time where it&rsquo;s a tough decision,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s really pressure, I could be like, you know what, this is the kind of person</p>
<p>you are.</p>
<p>Stick to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give one more example.</p>
<p>Sorry, you&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given talks on networking.</p>
<p>And I tell people, I like to use humor, because humor is a great way to shortcut the brain</p>
<p>and get the truth to them directly.</p>
<p>I say, if you know someone is in town, it&rsquo;s their birthday, and they&rsquo;re not doing anything,</p>
<p>take them out.</p>
<p>And I say, I do this for Rand reasons.</p>
<p>I do it selfishly.</p>
<p>And the audience laughs.</p>
<p>And I go, you&rsquo;re laughing.</p>
<p>But I go, the guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.</p>
<p>That could be you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing stopping you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not thinking in these terms, what&rsquo;s it going to cost you $30?</p>
<p>But for the rest of their life, or a few years, that person will remember you and be like,</p>
<p>you know what, this person did right by me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you a concrete example, which changed my life profoundly.</p>
<p>Ted Hope, who was the producer of the film American Splendor, which starred my mentor</p>
<p>Harvey Pekar, sent an email to his firm that said Harvey&rsquo;s in town with nothing to do.</p>
<p>If you want to hang out with him, here&rsquo;s your chance.</p>
<p>They worked at a film company.</p>
<p>And I was the only one, I got the email, I wasn&rsquo;t working there from a friend who took</p>
<p>him up on it.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, Harvey wrote a graphic novel about me, Ego and Hubris, which is $250</p>
<p>on eBay now, and it moves at that, not too shabby.</p>
<p>The point being, you know what, someone had a movie made about him.</p>
<p>Someone is an interesting figure.</p>
<p>Take the lunch and stay overtime for an hour.</p>
<p>But so many people don&rsquo;t think in those terms.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many opportunities for them.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the advice I give.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s also good to give advice via anecdote.</p>
<p>So not only is the person getting the advice, they are learning why you got to that point.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but at least they&rsquo;ve thought about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I agree with all of that.</p>
<p>And I like the line, Ayn Rand&rsquo;s line about man is a self made soul, is a creature of</p>
<p>self made soul is huge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something most people don&rsquo;t realize, and it&rsquo;s something that modern intellectuals</p>
<p>undermine.</p>
<p>I mean, even somebody like Sam Harris, when you keep telling people they don&rsquo;t have free</p>
<p>will, then you don&rsquo;t have a self made soul.</p>
<p>Because what is self made, there is no self, according to Sam, right?</p>
<p>He meditates and he sees that he doesn&rsquo;t have a self.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re undermining the ability of people to take control of their own lives and make</p>
<p>the kind of choices that are necessary to create the kind of moral character that is</p>
<p>necessary for them to be successful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d encourage people to go read Foundhead and Atlas Shrugged because put aside the politics,</p>
<p>put aside even aspects of the philosophy, focus on these models.</p>
<p>How to Walk is a great model for all of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great story to have in your head, in your mind when you encounter challenging choices</p>
<p>that you might make.</p>
<p>And then spend the time, and this is, I don&rsquo;t think I ever did this when I was young, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think people do this, but spend the time thinking about what your values really</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>What do you love doing?</p>
<p>What makes, what gets you going?</p>
<p>What gets you excited?</p>
<p>And how can I make a living at this?</p>
<p>How can I do this and live through this?</p>
<p>And then, you know, think about what kind of life you want, what kind of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>what kind of people you want to hang out with.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just, don&rsquo;t let life just happen to you.</p>
<p>Think it through.</p>
<p>What kind of people, for example, if you want ambitious, excited, maybe you should move</p>
<p>to Silicon Valley, to Austin, Texas, right?</p>
<p>If you want to be around artsy people, I mean, you should go to Hollywood, maybe you should</p>
<p>go to New York, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, but figure out what kind of life you want to live,</p>
<p>what kind of people you want to hang out with, what kind of woman you want to spend your</p>
<p>life with, what kind of romantic relationship you want to have, figure that out and go and</p>
<p>do it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sit around.</p>
<p>Life is not&hellip;</p>
<p>Or try and fail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to fail.</p>
<p>Oh, failure, failure, absolutely.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And learn from that failure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>Think about what you&rsquo;re doing, why you&rsquo;re succeeding, why you&rsquo;re failing, and keep improving.</p>
<p>Keep working on it because it&rsquo;s not just going to happen like this.</p>
<p>Nobody is Francisco to take a character out of Atlas Shark, to succeed at everything,</p>
<p>first try, right?</p>
<p>We all need to fail a few times.</p>
<p>We all need to, but what have you got to lose?</p>
<p>Every second is never going to be back.</p>
<p>I mean, these are all cliches, but they&rsquo;re all true cliches.</p>
<p>So think, figure out what your values are, and try to apply your reason, your rational</p>
<p>thought on getting those values.</p>
<p>We talked about early on in the show, in the interview, we talked about integrating your</p>
<p>emotions with your cognition.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s crucial because you don&rsquo;t want to be fighting your emotions as you move towards</p>
<p>these things.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your emotions to be barriers to your own success.</p>
<p>You want them to be cheerleaders, to chew on when good things happen and to be negative</p>
<p>emotions when it&rsquo;s justified that they&rsquo;re negative.</p>
<p>So work on integrating your soul.</p>
<p>So creating your own soul, that&rsquo;s the real challenge.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give one piece of meta advice.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re going to be clueless because you&rsquo;re going to be ignorant, you know</p>
<p>the data.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask your dopey friends for advice because they want to be helpful, but the friends want</p>
<p>to be helpful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re as dopey as you.</p>
<p>They have uninformed as you.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just going to give you platitudes and you&rsquo;re going to be worse off because now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be confused, especially with social media.</p>
<p>Reach out to people who are older than you, who are accomplished.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how often that you got to send them 20 bucks, buy them dinner, buy</p>
<p>their book, whatever it takes.</p>
<p>You are getting free world class advice for very cheap and that is really a mechanism</p>
<p>for success.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s something very unpopular and not sexy.</p>
<p>This is why people probably unfollow me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not why.</p>
<p>Read.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ll tell me why after this.</p>
<p>Read, read, read.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not always going to have access to those experts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just talking about self help books.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even talking about self help books.</p>
<p>Read the words with literature.</p>
<p>I mean, literature presents you with all the different characters.</p>
<p>You know, read Dostoevsky, right?</p>
<p>Read Hugo, right?</p>
<p>Read all these authors that have taken time to really create characters and put them in</p>
<p>situations that maybe you will never face those exact situations, but you&rsquo;ll face similar</p>
<p>situations and they play it out for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see what the consequences are.</p>
<p>Great literature is a real tool for building your soul.</p>
<p>Read generally with literature and particularly because it&rsquo;s more conceptual.</p>
<p>What maybe you could speak to love and relationship in your own life, but in general, if we look</p>
<p>at Alice Shrugged, if we look at Fountainhead, and maybe this is going to become a therapy</p>
<p>session for Lex, but also just looking at your own life in a form of advice, how can</p>
<p>you be a heroic Reardon type character and live your life to the fullest in creating</p>
<p>the most amazing things that you&rsquo;re able to create and yet have others in your life that</p>
<p>you give yourself to in terms of loving them fully and having a family, having kids, but</p>
<p>just even just the love of your life kind of thing.</p>
<p>How do you balance those things together?</p>
<p>Is there any anything to say?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say one thing because then I&rsquo;ll defer to you, Ron, because he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s married</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>I think they compliment each other and feed off each other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, how do you balance having shoes and pants?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, you want both.</p>
<p>You want it all.</p>
<p>And having a great partner who thinks you&rsquo;re a badass and then sometimes they&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>stage and you&rsquo;re like, oh my, I&rsquo;m married to a badass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>
<p>No, absolutely.</p>
<p>It feeds off of each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s synergetic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely synergetic.</p>
<p>The problem that people have, I think, where they get into challenges is when they view</p>
<p>them as opposites, right?</p>
<p>Work or family.</p>
<p>Well, if you don&rsquo;t work the family, you can&rsquo;t finance the family, but more than that.</p>
<p>Why is your wife going to love you?</p>
<p>What are the virtues that you&rsquo;re bringing?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t maximize your own potential, if you don&rsquo;t live the best life that you can</p>
<p>live, what is it to love?</p>
<p>And if she doesn&rsquo;t do the same thing, why do you love her?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get this conflict between work and, you know, how do I have a balanced life?</p>
<p>Of course you have a balanced life.</p>
<p>You balance it based on your values and it&rsquo;s never going to be the same.</p>
<p>The balance is, you know, the time you spend at work and with family when you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>or when you have little kids or when they&rsquo;re grown up is all going to be different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on your priorities at the point, but it&rsquo;s all going to feed off</p>
<p>of each other.</p>
<p>So maybe another word outside of balance is sacrifice.</p>
<p>Do you think relationship involves sacrifice or no?</p>
<p>Does he know what he&rsquo;s doing?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trolling you.</p>
<p>Is he trolling me?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big troll.</p>
<p>Is he trolling me?</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Lex is the biggest troll on Twitter.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Ever sacrifice.</p>
<p>Deal with it.</p>
<p>Never sacrifice.</p>
<p>But see, he means sacrifice in the context.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to define it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sacrifice in my world.</p>
<p>Can I say one thing before we get sidebar?</p>
<p>Rand had a good example when he was talking about balance.</p>
<p>So she was married to this guy, Frank O. Connor.</p>
<p>He was not a cerebral.</p>
<p>He was not intellectual.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>She was in love with him.</p>
<p>She was a fan.</p>
<p>And a lot of times she&rsquo;d have these conversations with her acolytes till like four in the morning</p>
<p>about the most cerebral topics.</p>
<p>And I said, he would always bring them food.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d stay up and kind of sit there in a corner and I go, when this was happening, was he</p>
<p>sitting there like, oh God, here goes crazy old Ein and I just got to be bored?</p>
<p>And they go, absolutely not.</p>
<p>He was so proud of her.</p>
<p>He was so excited.</p>
<p>In fact, when she got a lot of money from, I think selling Red Pawn, which was her screenplay,</p>
<p>which never produced, he told her you can buy any kind of fur coat as long as it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Mink, he&rsquo;s like, you earn this, celebrate it, so that was a good example.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good relationship, absolutely. Now, sacrifice is the giving of a value and</p>
<p>expecting either nothing or something less in return. You don&rsquo;t do that in a love relationship.</p>
<p>Your love relationship is a sense, a trait. You&rsquo;re constantly trading. You&rsquo;re not trading</p>
<p>materially, but you&rsquo;re trading spiritually. Imagine if I only gave my wife, if I gave</p>
<p>spiritually and materially, only in one direction. I&rsquo;d get sick of it. She&rsquo;d get sick of it. It</p>
<p>would never last. It has to be in give and take constantly, in different ways, different values.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a monetary exchange, but it&rsquo;s constantly you&rsquo;re giving and you&rsquo;re receiving and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving. And that&rsquo;s got to be in balance. And I know a lot of relationships where that gets out</p>
<p>of balance. And one party feels like they&rsquo;re giving all the time, they&rsquo;re sacrificing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re giving more than they&rsquo;re receiving, in a sense. And it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Now, people use the word sacrifice, like Jordan Peterson. He uses it both ways. That&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>You know Jordan?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him personally. Jordan Peterson, I said. I didn&rsquo;t call him Jordan.</p>
<p>Just wanted to be clear.</p>
<p>Yeah. He uses it in his talks as&hellip; Sometimes he uses it just as I described it,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s supportive of that, like the sacrifice Jesus made. And sometimes he uses it as an</p>
<p>investment. But it&rsquo;s not. If you&rsquo;re giving money now, expecting a bigger return in the future,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a sacrifice. That&rsquo;s an investment. That&rsquo;s why we have two concepts for that.</p>
<p>And the same is true if my wife is ill. And I&rsquo;ve got a whole relationship built around what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>giving. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not getting anything back. What I&rsquo;m getting back is that she is</p>
<p>recovering. Is that she&rsquo;s still alive or whatever it is that I&rsquo;m keeping. That&rsquo;s the value that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting in return. If I&rsquo;m not getting that, why am I doing it? Because I signed a contract a long</p>
<p>time ago. So it&rsquo;s not a sacrifice. Children are not a sacrifice. If I don&rsquo;t go to the movies,</p>
<p>because I stay at home with my kids, it&rsquo;s because I love my kids more than I love going to the</p>
<p>movies. And if I love going to the movies more than I love staying with the kids, then get a</p>
<p>babysitter or don&rsquo;t have kids, which is the better approach. Here&rsquo;s a question. What book did Ayn Rand</p>
<p>say is the most evil book in all of serious literature? It was Anna Karenina. And the reason</p>
<p>it was that book, which I haven&rsquo;t read, please correct me if I get the plot wrong. What Rand was</p>
<p>saying is the plot is a guy who&rsquo;s a big shot, I think. He marries a stupid girl who has nothing</p>
<p>of value to offer him for at all. And she ends up killing herself. Whereas Rand&rsquo;s version, and we</p>
<p>can take this out of the romantic context. I am delighted when I could be of use to my friends.</p>
<p>It makes me feel wonderful and not in a kind of parasitic way. It&rsquo;s just like that I&rsquo;m at a</p>
<p>certain point where they call me up, they&rsquo;re having a problem and I&rsquo;ve helped them with that problem.</p>
<p>Anna Karenina, he gives up the love of his life. Oh, is that what it is? The amazing girl.</p>
<p>He has an affair with her outside of marriage, taints her, is married to the stupid, but she gives</p>
<p>him the prestige and everything. Oh, that&rsquo;s clearly very anti Rand. And the smart, the one he loves,</p>
<p>she commits suicide in there. Okay, I got it wrong. So it&rsquo;s about him choosing</p>
<p>mediocrity and nothingness over love. So pursuing your values is so crucial. So don&rsquo;t take it by</p>
<p>saying, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you want to eat Chinese and she wants to eat Italian, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>once in a while eat Italian on that day, right? That&rsquo;s silly, right? That&rsquo;s not a sacrifice,</p>
<p>not in the sense in which we&rsquo;re talking about. It doesn&rsquo;t mean don&rsquo;t compromise. It doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t compromise on the day to day stuff. It means don&rsquo;t compromise on moral values. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compromise on the big stuff and you never sacrifice. And that way you have a relationship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built as equals and as you admire each other and love at the end of the day is a response</p>
<p>to value. If you stop undermining your own value, the person who loves you will stop loving you,</p>
<p>will love you less. If you love yourself less, you have to say, in order to say I love you,</p>
<p>you have to be able to say the I, right? You have to be somebody, you have to know yourself,</p>
<p>you have to have value. And so love is a profound emotional response to value.</p>
<p>So speaking of love and the three of us being on this deserted island for a time together,</p>
<p>somehow not murdering each other, let me ask you, Yaron, Michael, what is the most beautiful thing</p>
<p>you find about the other? So let&rsquo;s go Yaron first. What do you think about Michael,</p>
<p>that you appreciate about him? What do you get these questions from? What do you love about Michael?</p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;s going to edit it. See, that makes sense to me. I just programmed him.</p>
<p>Press play. It&rsquo;s all just a prerecorded message. So I&rsquo;ve never met Michael before,</p>
<p>so this is my&hellip; That&rsquo;s not true. You have and you&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember ever meeting Michael before. You&rsquo;re the very beginning of the new right,</p>
<p>is me meeting you. I&rsquo;m in the book?</p>
<p>Yes. All right. Well, now I have to read his book</p>
<p>because I mean, am I presented positively or negatively?</p>
<p>Very. Oh, okay. Good.</p>
<p>Lex is not so sure. He&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>I like that he goes, have I presented positively or negatively? I just go, very.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh, good. I&rsquo;m like, is it?</p>
<p>So Michael Sharp, he&rsquo;s quick. He&rsquo;s funny, although some of the humor is beyond me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice way of saying he&rsquo;s very intelligent.</p>
<p>Yeah. He&rsquo;s definitely very intelligent, but also very engaging. I think that&rsquo;s very engaging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sharp dresser.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s definitely&hellip; Well, yeah. I compliment him on stuff that&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>and everybody can see by the video. The sex appeal.</p>
<p>Let me also just comment, one thing you mentioned about</p>
<p>you deriving joy from being of value to your friends.</p>
<p>People talk to me about you sometimes because you&rsquo;ll do humor about various things and things</p>
<p>like maybe you&rsquo;re some kind of a crazy person or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah. I know you enjoy this aspect of it, but I say that the reason I&rsquo;m friends with Michael</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s real love there. And the kind of kindness you give to your friends,</p>
<p>to people that are close to you, to your family is amazing, man.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of my favorite things about you. Your intellect aside, your philosophies aside,</p>
<p>your humor aside, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of love in you. That&rsquo;s what I really appreciate.</p>
<p>But enough about you. I&rsquo;m actually getting sick of saying nice things about you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always going to say it.</p>
<p>Take it all back.</p>
<p>Can I say one thing? You&rsquo;re joking, but this is something that&rsquo;s very key and this is something</p>
<p>in a random context. It is very disturbing, and this is not by accident, how in our culture it is</p>
<p>pooh poohed to show kindness, earnestness, appreciation, to tell someone. You see this</p>
<p>on Twitter where someone&rsquo;s like, you know what? I read your book. It&rsquo;s made my life a lot better.</p>
<p>Okay, simp. And there&rsquo;s a real, and this very much comes out of urban media circles,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this real disdain for showing appreciation, for showing happiness, for showing kindness.</p>
<p>And now that I&rsquo;ve called it out, you&rsquo;ll notice it. But when you see how common it is and how people</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take compliments, the effects of that are extreme and extremely negative.</p>
<p>I got to say about Texas, one of the things, so Austin especially, I mean, I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>fully know Texas, Texas, but Austin, the friendliness. There&rsquo;s a reason I&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>fatter and been drinking a lot is all the friendliness from random people who are no</p>
<p>longer random. They&rsquo;re just friends. I&rsquo;ve made more friends in one week than I have in my entire</p>
<p>stay in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Exactly. One and a half. You know what the number two means?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never counted up that high. So this is what happens when people are free.</p>
<p>No. When people are free and individualistic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exact opposite of what people believe. The more collectivist we are, the less free we are,</p>
<p>the nastier we are to one another. Individualists who are pursuing their own happiness are incredibly</p>
<p>kind, friendly, and supportive people. Okay. And now your task with doing&hellip;</p>
<p>Talk about bad juju.</p>
<p>To practice what you preach, is there in your soul that you can find one beautiful thing to</p>
<p>say about Yaron now that you guys met for the first, second, or third time, or at least in</p>
<p>book format? So that&rsquo;s an easy one. So what I like about Yaron is that I think he is taking</p>
<p>one of the problems with maybe more old school objectivism is that they would just use Rand&rsquo;s</p>
<p>arguments in Rand&rsquo;s way. And it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re a parent, you&rsquo;re not adding anything, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to be better than her. So you give this talk about, I think you can compare, was it Bill</p>
<p>Gates to who was the one who went to jail? Oh, Bernie Madoff.</p>
<p>To Bernie Madoff. And you make the point, you&rsquo;re like, does anyone here really think Bernie Madoff</p>
<p>was happy? Like, yeah, he&rsquo;s successful and he&rsquo;s wealthy, but does he go to bed being like,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m a great guy? No. And his son kills himself with all this tragedy that goes with him.</p>
<p>So I think anyone who takes an ideology or worldview that I think is of value and adds to it</p>
<p>and makes it and articulates it in a new way, I think is a great accomplishment. I like how</p>
<p>uncompromising you are in your views of putting her views forward. And I like how you illustrate</p>
<p>how silly it is to argue against anarchism. So I don&rsquo;t really have to do any of the work.</p>
<p>As for you, and this, I&rsquo;ve thought this before many times, you&rsquo;re the first person I met who</p>
<p>I come at, literally the first, other than my friend who I went to yeshiva with as a kid,</p>
<p>who I come at us, there was a line on friends where Ross and Rachel were thinking of dating,</p>
<p>right? And they go, if we start dating, it would be like the third date because they knew each</p>
<p>other well. And then she&rsquo;s like, yeah, but it&rsquo;d be like, so it&rsquo;s like a plus and a minus, like,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re fast forwarding to seriousness, but it&rsquo;s also the fact that you and I have the same</p>
<p>background. Like I can sit with your own or any of my other friends and try to explain it. The fact</p>
<p>that intuitively you and I grew up the same. And I know that we have that background in common</p>
<p>does create a bond because I feel even if I haven&rsquo;t told you certain things, you are going</p>
<p>to understand me a lot better than many of my friends who&rsquo;ve known me for a long time. I also</p>
<p>really like how I feel. This is a very new age term, but I&rsquo;m going to use it. I feel very seen</p>
<p>when I talk to you. I think you see me for who I am. You appreciate me for who I am. And I also</p>
<p>really like how, and this is increasingly common as my platform increases. So I&rsquo;m very flattered</p>
<p>by this. You understand what I&rsquo;m trying to do and you don&rsquo;t try to get in the way, even though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your show. You&rsquo;re like, okay, this guy&rsquo;s a performer. He&rsquo;s doing his thing. People appreciate</p>
<p>it. I appreciate it. I&rsquo;m not going to try to drive the car. And I think some people who are who are</p>
<p>bad and I have not encountered this because I would shoot it down. But I think a lot of times</p>
<p>people have a tendency when they&rsquo;re hosts to try to drive the car. And it&rsquo;s like these things work</p>
<p>when we come in here. None of us prepare. You prepare by me. None of us talking beforehand</p>
<p>and like make it spontaneous. And the audience really enjoys that more because they know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>real earnest and dynamic. Yeah. I enjoy having you drive the car, even though I believe you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a license. And you think we&rsquo;re going to crash. No, I think he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s an extraordinary</p>
<p>interviewer because of all those things. He makes you feel visible. And, and he does, but he also</p>
<p>comes across as really honest. The questions are really questions that you seem really interested</p>
<p>in that you really want answers to. It doesn&rsquo;t come across as canned or I prepared my three</p>
<p>book project. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. I was pretty sure that on a desert island,</p>
<p>this would end in murder, but now I believe it may. Well, given his comments on anarchy,</p>
<p>it might still. It might still. The day is young. The night is young. This is a huge honor. I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been a fan of both of you separately for a long time. I really appreciate wasting all this time</p>
<p>with me today. I love you, Michael. I love you, Yaron. We love you too. Thanks for listening to</p>
<p>this conversation with Michael Malice and Yaron Brook. And thank you to ground news, public goods,</p>
<p>athletic greens, brave and four Sigmatic. Check them out in the description to support this</p>
<p>podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx. Surround yourself with people who</p>
<p>make you happy. People who make you laugh, who help you when you&rsquo;re in need. People who genuinely</p>
<p>care. They are the ones worth keeping in your life. Everyone else is just passing through.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
