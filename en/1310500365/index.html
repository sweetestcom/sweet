    <p>The following is a conversation with Aaron Smith-Levin,</p>
<p>a former Scientologist, raised in Scientology,</p>
<p>and have worked in the organization full-time</p>
<p>for many years as a staff member and a Sea Org member,</p>
<p>including the job of training Scientology auditors.</p>
<p>Today, he educates the public about Scientology</p>
<p>on his YouTube channel called Growing Up in Scientology.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few-second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Green Chef for delicious and healthy,</p>
<p>easy-to-make meals,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>and Athletic Greens for gut health.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to work on our amazing team,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>
<p>Go to lexfriedman.com slash hiring.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This episode is brought to you by Green Chef,</p>
<p>a California-certified organics farmer company</p>
<p>that makes it easy to eat well</p>
<p>with meal plans for every lifestyle.</p>
<p>They have a number of one-meal kits for eating well</p>
<p>with options for keto, vegan, vegetarian,</p>
<p>fast and fit, Mediterranean, and gluten-free.</p>
<p>Of course, you know which one I pick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on keto.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on carnivore.</p>
<p>I jump around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not religiously any one particular diet,</p>
<p>but I just feel much better when the number of carbs</p>
<p>I consume is very low.</p>
<p>And I should also say that I don&rsquo;t do cheat meals,</p>
<p>which I think is a popular notion</p>
<p>that a bunch of people follow.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>I enjoy life so much more when I sort of cheat</p>
<p>by having just a tiny bit of carbs,</p>
<p>not like just pig out completely.</p>
<p>So I guess cheat by like a quick little detour,</p>
<p>a quick little glance, not a full-on affair,</p>
<p>if you know what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Anyway, the keto is ridiculous,</p>
<p>but the keto meals from Green Chef is really,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my go-to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>I really highly recommend it.</p>
<p>It also gives variety to my intake,</p>
<p>which makes me feel like I&rsquo;m enjoying life even more</p>
<p>than I already have been.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to greenchef.com slash lex60</p>
<p>and use code lex60 to get 60% off plus free shipping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s greenchef.com slash lex60</p>
<p>and use code lex60 for 60% off plus free shipping.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Insight Tracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track the data</p>
<p>that comes from the biological system</p>
<p>that some refer to as Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just a collection of cells.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m underneath that a collection of atoms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a collection of a lot of things,</p>
<p>billions, trillions,</p>
<p>and somehow they&rsquo;re all like in this one bag</p>
<p>that move together,</p>
<p>this meat vehicle that operates</p>
<p>with other meat vehicles in meat space</p>
<p>and does interesting things and is worried and is hopeful</p>
<p>and is ecstatic sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes is afraid.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the ride ends too quickly for that meat bag</p>
<p>that I guess others call Lex,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t even know what I call myself in my own head.</p>
<p>How am I even talking to you right now?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>A bunch of cells, neurons, a firing,</p>
<p>creating a thought,</p>
<p>creating an experience of a thought,</p>
<p>allow me in a meta way to discuss</p>
<p>the experience of a thought,</p>
<p>and here we are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m speaking in a technology build by humans</p>
<p>alone in a room,</p>
<p>but you, another human,</p>
<p>are now listening to this.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you wanna get a little data</p>
<p>on this giant mystery,</p>
<p>this beautiful mystery that is the biology</p>
<p>of our human body,</p>
<p>you should use Inside Tracker</p>
<p>and you can get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>and you go to insidetracker.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s AG1 Drink,</p>
<p>which is an all-in-one daily drink</p>
<p>to support better health and peak performance.</p>
<p>I take it twice a day.</p>
<p>I take it after a run,</p>
<p>a long run in the now warm Texas weather,</p>
<p>slowly getting ready for that Texas heat.</p>
<p>I mean, I love those long runs along the river.</p>
<p>Anywhere I go, just long runs along with my thoughts.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m listening to Brown Noise or an audio book,</p>
<p>that just takes me away.</p>
<p>Takes me away for an hour or two or three,</p>
<p>depending on how long the run is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m in a different world.</p>
<p>And when I come back, come back into this world,</p>
<p>the first entry point is an Athletic Greens drink.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll put it in the fridge</p>
<p>and then take a quick shower and drink it cold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delicious either way, warm, cold, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Just put a little powder with some water, it&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>And I also, when I travel, I take it.</p>
<p>It gives me that feeling that I&rsquo;ve gotten my life in order,</p>
<p>at least for the nutritional stuff.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Aaron Smith-Levin.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a full overview of Scientology,</p>
<p>its ideas, how it operates,</p>
<p>how it wields its power and influence.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s start at the very basics.</p>
<p>What is Scientology?</p>
<p>Scientology is a belief system created by L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>that does fundamentally believe</p>
<p>that we are all immortal spiritual beings called thetans,</p>
<p>that we have native godlike potential,</p>
<p>that there is nothing more powerful</p>
<p>in the universe than a thetan.</p>
<p>So godlike is quite literal here.</p>
<p>And that through various decisions thetans have made,</p>
<p>they have fallen away from their native godlike power</p>
<p>to falling down to a state where most thetans</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t even aware that they are thetans,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t even aware that they ever have lived before</p>
<p>or have these powers,</p>
<p>and that thetans are now in a state</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re trapped in bodies, trapped here on Earth,</p>
<p>trapped in this prison of a physical universe,</p>
<p>trapped on this prison of a planet,</p>
<p>and that only Scientology can restore a thetan</p>
<p>to its native state.</p>
<p>Are these multiple beings?</p>
<p>Like is there one thetan inside of me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trapped in this prison?</p>
<p>Well, the thane would be you.</p>
<p>The thane would be me.</p>
<p>The thetan is you.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m presumably limited in some fundamental way.</p>
<p>So this thetan that is me is limited.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like eight billion thetans on the planet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one primary thetan animating each body.</p>
<p>Later in Scientology you learn there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of sick, unconscious, half-dead thetans stuck to you</p>
<p>that are now an additional cause of problems for you.</p>
<p>But fundamentally at the lower levels,</p>
<p>the non-confidential levels,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just one thetan per body.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</p>
<p>I just would like to kind of explore</p>
<p>the philosophy of that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a being that&rsquo;s all-powerful that&rsquo;s immortal,</p>
<p>and its projection, its manifestation on this Earth</p>
<p>is fundamentally limited.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to, the process of Scientology</p>
<p>is the process of letting go of those limitations.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of religions have this kind of idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s, not just religions,</p>
<p>but like we have the capacity as human beings</p>
<p>to achieve greatness in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the question we have with our cognitive abilities</p>
<p>we start with an embryo and build up into this organism</p>
<p>and like this world of opportunities before us,</p>
<p>what are we capable of?</p>
<p>And the idea that we&rsquo;re capable of almost anything</p>
<p>is a really powerful one.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of religions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of philosophies,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of advice, self-help</p>
<p>that kind of explore those ideas.</p>
<p>And so it seems like with Scientology,</p>
<p>the application of this religious philosophy</p>
<p>means that we&rsquo;re limited</p>
<p>and we have to break through those limitations.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a process to break through those limitations.</p>
<p>That would be correct.</p>
<p>So what can make it challenging to adequately</p>
<p>and completely describe Scientology in the beginning</p>
<p>is what Scientologists believe actually changes</p>
<p>as they progress further into or further up in Scientology.</p>
<p>So the explanation is I&rsquo;ve given it</p>
<p>is pretty consistent with what you would get</p>
<p>at the lowest levels, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a Thetan, I&rsquo;m a Thetan, everyone&rsquo;s a Thetan.</p>
<p>And we have a reactive mind.</p>
<p>L. Ron Hubbard would say the reactive mind</p>
<p>is a collection of these recordings,</p>
<p>mental recordings of any moments of pain and unconsciousness</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever had in your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the subconscious mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always recording in moments of pain and unconsciousness</p>
<p>and that these recordings,</p>
<p>L. Ron Hubbard called them engrams.</p>
<p>Now, when L. Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in 1950,</p>
<p>this was before Scientology came along</p>
<p>a couple of years later, right?</p>
<p>So in 1950, when he wrote Dianetics,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a spiritual endeavor.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be a mental health,</p>
<p>a science of mental health.</p>
<p>So as of that time,</p>
<p>the earliest engram you could have</p>
<p>was the incident of birth.</p>
<p>Being born was an engram.</p>
<p>And technically in Dianetics,</p>
<p>he said you could have prenatal engrams,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re still in the womb.</p>
<p>But there was no concept of past lives</p>
<p>as of 1950 version of Dianetics, right?</p>
<p>And so the idea there was that the reactive mind</p>
<p>is essentially a stimulus response mechanism</p>
<p>created through evolution millions of years ago</p>
<p>to protect the individual from things that would harm them.</p>
<p>In other words, things that would bring</p>
<p>about pain and unconsciousness.</p>
<p>So you have these recordings of things that hurt you,</p>
<p>create a pain and unconsciousness.</p>
<p>And in present time, these things will react upon you</p>
<p>in a way to cause you to avoid similar things</p>
<p>reacting upon you in a subconscious, unconscious way.</p>
<p>So the reactive mind protects you</p>
<p>from the trauma that is inside your subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Yes, and the idea is we&rsquo;ve now,</p>
<p>as human beings, evolved to a state</p>
<p>where it no longer serves us beneficially.</p>
<p>It only serves us negatively.</p>
<p>This was Hubbard&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>And he says you can get rid of these engrams</p>
<p>by basically recalling them and going over them</p>
<p>again and again using Dianetics auditing therapy.</p>
<p>And if you get back to the moment of birth</p>
<p>and erase the earliest engram,</p>
<p>all the other subsequent engrams on the chain would vanish.</p>
<p>Oh, nice, so there&rsquo;s a chain.</p>
<p>Earlier, similar, earlier, similar,</p>
<p>earlier, similar, earlier, similar, okay.</p>
<p>So that gives you a pretty good understanding</p>
<p>of how L. Ron Hubbard thought of the mind</p>
<p>because that carries on,</p>
<p>has applicability later on in Scientology.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a pretty powerful model of the mind.</p>
<p>I mean, Freud had similar conceptions</p>
<p>that a lot of our traumas are grounded in</p>
<p>sort of poor formulation of sexuality</p>
<p>or imperfect formulation of sexuality in early childhood,</p>
<p>something like this.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re trying to figure out the puzzle</p>
<p>of whatever we formed in early childhood.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s similar, similar kind of-</p>
<p>It is similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably what Hubbard took it from.</p>
<p>In the early days of Dianetics,</p>
<p>before he decided psychiatry was evil,</p>
<p>he actually credited Sigmund Freud</p>
<p>with some of the shoulders he was standing on</p>
<p>in writing Dianetics.</p>
<p>So he still admired psychiatry at that time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting moment of Dianetics.</p>
<p>So what else?</p>
<p>You mentioned Dianetics.</p>
<p>Auditing was there too.</p>
<p>So if we just, before Scientology,</p>
<p>what are the ideas that formed what we know as Dianetics?</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve just described, that is the fundamental.</p>
<p>That is pretty much the nuts and bolts of Dianetics.</p>
<p>Was it applied?</p>
<p>Was it applied often?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, no, that&rsquo;s what Dianetics in the early days</p>
<p>was all about, was just auditing.</p>
<p>Auditing is the process of the one-on-one counseling,</p>
<p>recall a moment of pain and unconsciousness,</p>
<p>run through the engram over and over and over again,</p>
<p>find something early or similar.</p>
<p>That is Dianetics auditing.</p>
<p>One of the main things that changed with Scientology</p>
<p>is that birth or prenatal engrams</p>
<p>were no longer the earliest engrams on the chain.</p>
<p>The idea is you have to get the earliest engram</p>
<p>on the chain for the later ones to blow, which is a race.</p>
<p>And so, but all of a sudden now,</p>
<p>with the addition of an immortal spiritual</p>
<p>being into the equation,</p>
<p>well now the earliest incident</p>
<p>could be trillions of years ago</p>
<p>in other galaxies and universes.</p>
<p>Other universes?</p>
<p>So before the origin of this universe?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there a model of physics integrated in any of this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The model is you have the physical universe</p>
<p>and then above that you have the theta universe.</p>
<p>So we used the word thetan earlier.</p>
<p>So in Scientology, they just use the word theta.</p>
<p>Theta is just basically thetan power,</p>
<p>thetans collectively.</p>
<p>So Hubbard would say you have the theta universe,</p>
<p>which is senior to the physical universe</p>
<p>and creates the physical universe.</p>
<p>And remember, I said native God-like potentials.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about the God who created the Earth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, like Scientologists don&rsquo;t believe in a God,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll get into that later.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about just creating universes.</p>
<p>Like just think like matrix.</p>
<p>Like just, when I say creating a universe,</p>
<p>essentially just creating different thetan simulations.</p>
<p>But it sounds like a little bit more</p>
<p>like the ideas of Plato,</p>
<p>which is there&rsquo;s these platonic forms,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s abstract forms that are bigger, more general</p>
<p>than our particular reality here.</p>
<p>And those forms are used to construct the reality.</p>
<p>Well, I grew up in a cult,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not familiar with the works of Plato.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t use that as an excuse for everything.</p>
<p>I would like to, you know, non-jokingly steal man the case</p>
<p>because a lot of philosophies, a lot of religions,</p>
<p>a lot of even scientific endeavors</p>
<p>are a little bit full of uncertainty.</p>
<p>You can call it bullshit,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re on sturdy ground</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re surrounded by mystery.</p>
<p>And you have to take these ideas somewhat seriously</p>
<p>and see where those ideas go wrong.</p>
<p>This happens with communism.</p>
<p>This happens with capitalism.</p>
<p>These ideas sound beautiful in their ideal forms.</p>
<p>And then they somehow go wrong</p>
<p>and some go more wrong than others.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to sort of caricature and make fun of the ideas.</p>
<p>I think if we take them seriously,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start to understand like when you&rsquo;re in it,</p>
<p>it was serious.</p>
<p>It can be very convincing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, the devil is going</p>
<p>to be a charismatic person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to be a caricature of ridiculous person.</p>
<p>So that helps us understand which ideas</p>
<p>will sound appealing, but will become dangerous.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s one of the thrusts I have on my channel</p>
<p>is wanting to talk about Scientology in a way</p>
<p>that would actually resonate with current Scientologists,</p>
<p>not just resonate with former Scientologists.</p>
<p>I want people who are still in</p>
<p>to be able to hear how I talk about it and go,</p>
<p>wow, he&rsquo;s being really fair and really accurate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not just a hater.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>If you look at the, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take one of the worst places on earth is North Korea.</p>
<p>You have Kim Jong-un.</p>
<p>And the reality is there&rsquo;s a lot of citizens of that nation</p>
<p>that deeply love the leader</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve grew up in that way.</p>
<p>And you, I mean, through fear,</p>
<p>through all kinds of manipulation,</p>
<p>through propaganda and so on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not allowed to love members of their own family.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not allowed to have romantic love.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only allowed to have love for the leader.</p>
<p>And to reach those people,</p>
<p>you have to empathize with the fact that in their eyes,</p>
<p>in some sense, this is a great man.</p>
<p>This is a God, a messianic figure.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just make fun of the ridiculousness</p>
<p>of the situation that is this pudgy person</p>
<p>waltzing around creating propaganda.</p>
<p>With a funny haircut.</p>
<p>With a funny haircut.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s so easy, Hitler too,</p>
<p>to make fun of, to make a caricature of the person.</p>
<p>But this is a real person,</p>
<p>a real person that influenced the minds</p>
<p>of millions of people.</p>
<p>In the case of Hitler, you know,</p>
<p>tens of millions of people</p>
<p>and created a huge amount of suffering,</p>
<p>not because of the caricature version,</p>
<p>but because he was a charismatic leader.</p>
<p>He was somebody that people deeply, deeply loved.</p>
<p>And that just, over time,</p>
<p>with the abuse of any kind of ideology,</p>
<p>this happens over and over.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting because Scientology</p>
<p>is so close to the core of what is America</p>
<p>because so many Americans are involved with it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to study the beauty</p>
<p>and the power of the ideas that underlie it</p>
<p>and where things go wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just say, it&rsquo;s interesting to note,</p>
<p>you would never get a representative</p>
<p>of the Church of Scientology to sit down</p>
<p>and have a conversation with you</p>
<p>and even be as fair and accurate about Scientology</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m going to be, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Do you honestly, deeply believe that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not going to be a high-level official</p>
<p>that would sit down for a conversation?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I disagree with you.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Because I think that given the current dynamics</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening, I think in order to say,</p>
<p>from their perspective,</p>
<p>in order to save the Church of Scientology,</p>
<p>they have to be transparent and authentic,</p>
<p>basically still mend their case, but better.</p>
<p>You would think so.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll talk about the other ways you could do that,</p>
<p>which is through manipulation, through propaganda,</p>
<p>through controlled media, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They paint themselves into a corner</p>
<p>of not being able to send a representative out</p>
<p>into the world to speak honestly about it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re literally not allowed to.</p>
<p>So when faced, if you&rsquo;re just sitting down</p>
<p>with an entertainment journalist,</p>
<p>a representative might be able to fudge their way</p>
<p>through an interview,</p>
<p>but sitting down for a long-form format interview</p>
<p>with someone who is going to ask them about Zinu</p>
<p>and the body thetans and Leah Remini and Lisa McPherson,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a no-go zone.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m representing why it will never happen,</p>
<p>but shit, I would tune in for that interview.</p>
<p>I mean, I hope you do get someone.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think David Miscavige would sit down</p>
<p>for an interview?</p>
<p>I would love to be wrong.</p>
<p>In general, journalists in these kinds of situations</p>
<p>can attack in a way that doesn&rsquo;t empathize</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t come from a place of deep knowledge</p>
<p>and understanding, and I think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to have serious conversations with people like that</p>
<p>in an empathetic way, but it&rsquo;s also in a challenging way.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a huge amount of trust required,</p>
<p>and obviously for a very secretive organization,</p>
<p>the amount of trust, yes, might be too much required.</p>
<p>Anyone over there, if they&rsquo;ve done their homework, knows</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be as fair as anyone in the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be, and yet, there&rsquo;s simply things</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not allowed to talk about,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not even allowed to say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not allowed to talk about it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a fundamental part of the church</p>
<p>of Scientology is the secrecy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re trained as you go up</p>
<p>through the ranks is secrecy, secrecy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a matter of training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s an entire, the entire upper half</p>
<p>of Scientology&rsquo;s bridge is simply confidential.</p>
<p>I mean, and I never even did those levels</p>
<p>when I was in Scientology.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t learn what Scientologists actually believe</p>
<p>on those upper levels until after I got out of Scientology,</p>
<p>and I was frickin&rsquo; born and raised in it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to your personal story.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spent 30 years in Scientology.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was four years old when my mom got in.</p>
<p>And then about seven years ago, got out,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on what, YouTube channel now,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re an educator?</p>
<p>So I was four years old when my mom</p>
<p>got introduced to Scientology,</p>
<p>and she got in really fast, really quick.</p>
<p>I was 12 years old when I was taken out of school</p>
<p>and started officially full-time working for Scientology.</p>
<p>Okay, so in various capacities,</p>
<p>I worked for them from the ages of 12 to the age of 26.</p>
<p>Okay, so, and then I was 34</p>
<p>when I officially parted ways with Scientology,</p>
<p>which was really more them officially parting ways with me,</p>
<p>but we can get into all that later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just kinda how Scientology does it.</p>
<p>And what do you do now in terms of Scientology?</p>
<p>So now I run, growing up in Scientology,</p>
<p>the YouTube channel, but what I primarily do</p>
<p>is I help run an organization that helps people</p>
<p>who are escaping from Scientology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the vice president of the Aftermath Foundation.</p>
<p>And we created the foundation</p>
<p>after the television show,</p>
<p>Leah Remini, Scientology and the Aftermath.</p>
<p>And there was such an outpouring of support</p>
<p>from non-Scientologists all over the world.</p>
<p>What can we do to help people leave Scientology?</p>
<p>That we decided to create a foundation,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been incredibly successful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve helped people escape from all regions</p>
<p>and echelons of Scientology.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve accomplished is far beyond</p>
<p>what we actually envisioned would be possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a huge success.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about the negative aspect,</p>
<p>the abuses of power,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just explore the ideas a little bit more.</p>
<p>So the public facing three fundamental truths</p>
<p>of Scientology, maybe correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Man is an immortal spiritual being,</p>
<p>like we said with Thetans.</p>
<p>His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime,</p>
<p>so infinite memory backwards.</p>
<p>His capabilities are unlimited,</p>
<p>even if not presently realized.</p>
<p>The capabilities are unlimited.</p>
<p>So when I say godlike, I really just mean,</p>
<p>you know, Thanos, like unlimited.</p>
<p>Scientologists don&rsquo;t believe in a god.</p>
<p>So when I say godlike,</p>
<p>I just mean the most powerful entity, the creator,</p>
<p>the prime mover unmoved,</p>
<p>except we are all that.</p>
<p>You know, a Thetan in Scientology,</p>
<p>a Thetan has no position in space or time.</p>
<p>A Thetan does not actually exist in the physical universe.</p>
<p>It might choose to locate itself</p>
<p>in the physical universe, right?</p>
<p>And then forget that it made that decision</p>
<p>and then sort of get caught and trapped</p>
<p>in the physical universe.</p>
<p>But that once the Thetan is restored to its native powers,</p>
<p>everything you see here in the physical universe</p>
<p>is just a Thetan playing a game.</p>
<p>We are in a simulation right now of some Thetan.</p>
<p>So like physics doesn&rsquo;t have to make sense</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about it this way.</p>
<p>Like technically you&rsquo;re a Thetan, I&rsquo;m a Thetan, we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>but this could also all just be another Thetan&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>So Thetan&rsquo;s all the way down.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just Thetans everywhere,</p>
<p>Thetans, it all comes down to the Thetan.</p>
<p>Is there an idea of a god?</p>
<p>Because I read there is a kind of,</p>
<p>there is a sense of a supreme being.</p>
<p>Is that basically the Thetan that&rsquo;s at the core,</p>
<p>at the bottom of it all?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Not defined, undefined.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Scientology has this concept of the dynamics,</p>
<p>how Ron Hubbard breaks life into eight different dynamics.</p>
<p>And the dynamic meaning a thrust towards survival.</p>
<p>So he would say, the first dynamic is you yourself,</p>
<p>second dynamic is your family,</p>
<p>third dynamic is any other group</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a part of other than your family.</p>
<p>Fourth dynamic is all humankind.</p>
<p>The fifth dynamic is plant and animal life,</p>
<p>all non-human life.</p>
<p>Sixth dynamic is the physical world.</p>
<p>Seventh dynamic is sort of like spirituality,</p>
<p>collectively, Thetans, us as Thetans.</p>
<p>And the eighth dynamic, Ron Hubbard says,</p>
<p>Scientology doesn&rsquo;t deal with the eighth dynamic.</p>
<p>But we recognize that people have this idea</p>
<p>of a supreme being.</p>
<p>And so Scientology says, you can call the eighth dynamic</p>
<p>the supreme being dynamic, but we call it infinity.</p>
<p>Just the allness of everything without having to define it.</p>
<p>And then they sort of do a little dance</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, Scientology,</p>
<p>the purpose of Scientology is to get you to the point</p>
<p>where you have your own understandings or realizations</p>
<p>about the nature of the eighth dynamic.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t tell you what you have to believe about that.</p>
<p>And technically speaking, that is true.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, that is true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point in Scientology where they sit you down</p>
<p>and say, you&rsquo;re now required to revoke your belief</p>
<p>in a supreme being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that everything in Scientology is inconsistent</p>
<p>with a belief in the supreme being.</p>
<p>You can still find Scientologists</p>
<p>who, through cognitive dissonance,</p>
<p>will tell you they believe in a supreme being.</p>
<p>Mostly, they&rsquo;re lying to you.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s this inconsistent with a supreme being?</p>
<p>Because like, Thetans could just-</p>
<p>Because Thetans have created everything, not God.</p>
<p>Okay, so Thetans created, they&rsquo;re also a creative force.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just the force that runs everything.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But can&rsquo;t those be just the fingertips of a God?</p>
<p>Sure, the only way you could reconcile a supreme being</p>
<p>is if you say a single supreme being created all Theta.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like the spiritual Big Bang.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what most people think</p>
<p>when they talk about God.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about a creator of-</p>
<p>The physical universe.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Theta.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, even as I&rsquo;ve described Scientology so far,</p>
<p>none of what I&rsquo;ve said is something</p>
<p>I even subject to ridicule.</p>
<p>This is pretty common sense stuff, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, if you believe in spirituality or spirits at all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;ve described so far that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, believing in past lives</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t particularly unique or special.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The fact that Scientology does this little dance</p>
<p>of pretending to believe in a God,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s even like a PR line.</p>
<p>Scientology representatives will tell you</p>
<p>you can be a Christian and be a Scientologist.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you what.</p>
<p>Christians don&rsquo;t believe in past lives</p>
<p>and lives on other galaxies and planets and universes.</p>
<p>And Scientology knows that.</p>
<p>Scientology knows you can&rsquo;t be a Christian</p>
<p>and be a Scientologist, but they will say that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an example of sort of</p>
<p>the fundamental baked in dishonesty.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so important to Scientology</p>
<p>on the organizational level to have tax exempt status.</p>
<p>I wonder, do you know the process of what it takes</p>
<p>to prove that an organization is a religion?</p>
<p>While going through that process with the IRS,</p>
<p>for the second time, by the way,</p>
<p>Scientology actually had tax exemption in the early days</p>
<p>and the IRS pulled it and then they got it back in 1993.</p>
<p>While going through that process again,</p>
<p>the IRS actually took issue with the fact</p>
<p>that Scientology was claiming you could be a Scientologist</p>
<p>and a member of another religion.</p>
<p>The IRS actually said, pump the brakes there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna say that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna say you&rsquo;re not a religion.</p>
<p>And they actually put in writing to the IRS,</p>
<p>no, no, no, no, no, that&rsquo;s not what we meant,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what we meant.</p>
<p>We meant in the beginning you can be both,</p>
<p>but eventually you just have to be a Scientologist.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the eight dynamics,</p>
<p>but you also mentioned survival.</p>
<p>So that seems to be a core principle</p>
<p>that human existence is about survival.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate what is meant by survival?</p>
<p>Are we talking about the survival of the human species,</p>
<p>survival of the individual humans,</p>
<p>survival of the manifestation of thetans in human form?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s survival?</p>
<p>So it would be all of that,</p>
<p>because survival is the dominant force</p>
<p>across all the dynamics.</p>
<p>That, I mean, L. Ron Hubbard,</p>
<p>it was either Dianetics or Science of Survival.</p>
<p>He says he discovered the principle</p>
<p>upon which all life exists,</p>
<p>and that is all life, no matter what it is trying to do,</p>
<p>are you ready, Lex?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to survive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</p>
<p>See, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>No, I gotta tell you, I gotta-</p>
<p>You might get me back in, Lex.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not trying to get you back in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get you to take seriously</p>
<p>the power of the ideas behind Scientology,</p>
<p>because I think those ideas are not bad ideas.</p>
<p>They resonate with a lot of ideas throughout philosophy,</p>
<p>throughout religions,</p>
<p>throughout the history of human civilization.</p>
<p>The interesting aspect is how it goes wrong.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, Lex, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It is consistent with prior efforts or studies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that L. Ron Hubbard said</p>
<p>this was a watershed breakthrough</p>
<p>that was being discovered for the first time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what I&rsquo;m mocking, really.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can mock Nietzsche for saying,</p>
<p>man is will to power.</p>
<p>You can mock Freud-</p>
<p>But did he claim to be the first person to ever say it?</p>
<p>Well, Nietzsche, he&rsquo;s had a bit of an ego, so.</p>
<p>Like, and he&rsquo;s full of contradictions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure the implied thing</p>
<p>is that he was the first to say it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of scientists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one of the people I really admire,</p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram, who wrote a book</p>
<p>called A New Kind of Science</p>
<p>that explores complex systems and cellular automata</p>
<p>and these mathematical systems</p>
<p>that have been explored before.</p>
<p>But he boldly kind of defined,</p>
<p>I am presenting to you a whole new way to look at the world.</p>
<p>And if you just set a little bit of the ego</p>
<p>behind that aside,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually beautiful ideas in there.</p>
<p>They have, of course, been done before and explored before.</p>
<p>But sometimes people declare this is the coolest-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;m really mocking is he said,</p>
<p>this discovery that life is trying to survive</p>
<p>is greater than the discovery of fire.</p>
<p>Okay, I mean, it gets a little silly, but that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>We can agree that the fact that life is trying to survive</p>
<p>has meaning and is meaningful and is valuable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, life is trying to survive.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s a non-trivial definition</p>
<p>of what is life here.</p>
<p>So this idea of a thing that permeates through lifetimes,</p>
<p>through people, there&rsquo;s some fabric</p>
<p>that is bigger than individual biological bags of meat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a philosophically interesting idea.</p>
<p>Of course, if it&rsquo;s not grounded</p>
<p>in a little bit more physical reality,</p>
<p>then it becomes a little too woo-woo.</p>
<p>And the way L. Ron Hubbard in Scientology defines survival</p>
<p>is very much intertwined with how they define ethics.</p>
<p>Ethics, anything to be ethical is pro-survival.</p>
<p>To be unethical is counter-survival.</p>
<p>But we were talking about just the concept of the dynamics,</p>
<p>like what does survival refer to?</p>
<p>And it actually does refer to all of them,</p>
<p>but just keep in mind when it comes to the seventh dynamic,</p>
<p>Thetans collectively involved in here is the idea</p>
<p>that a Thetan cannot die.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as killing a Thetan.</p>
<p>A Thetan can only survive.</p>
<p>And so, anyway, this concept of the dynamics</p>
<p>is one of the most fundamental</p>
<p>and important concepts in Scientology.</p>
<p>But because I mentioned that it also gets tied up</p>
<p>with ethics, and this probably speaks</p>
<p>to what you were just talking about,</p>
<p>is you can have the ideas and the concepts,</p>
<p>and you can have how do they go wrong,</p>
<p>because they hold that Scientology, applying Scientology,</p>
<p>getting people into Scientology,</p>
<p>is the key to basically saving</p>
<p>every spiritual being in existence.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re analyzing what is ethical,</p>
<p>it becomes whatever&rsquo;s good for Scientology</p>
<p>becomes by definition ethical,</p>
<p>because anything that&rsquo;s good for Scientology,</p>
<p>which is a third dynamic,</p>
<p>is inherently good for all the dynamics.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you get the ends justifying the means</p>
<p>to do anything possible, use any means necessary</p>
<p>to forward the aims of Scientology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of where a lot of Soviet implementation</p>
<p>of communism went wrong, is the ends justify the means.</p>
<p>The equality, the justice for the workers,</p>
<p>if we have to kill, murder, imprison, censor,</p>
<p>in the name of that, then it&rsquo;s for the greater good</p>
<p>in the long term to achieve the ideal of communism.</p>
<p>In some respects, Scientology created</p>
<p>a near-perfect communist experiment in its C organization.</p>
<p>What is it, from everyone according to their ability</p>
<p>to each according to their need or something like that?</p>
<p>Scientology&rsquo;s C organization is damn near</p>
<p>a perfect communist experiment.</p>
<p>Coming from someone who doesn&rsquo;t necessarily know</p>
<p>what a perfect communist experiment really is,</p>
<p>because I grew up in a cult, Lex.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t keep using that as an excuse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny tagline I use in my videos.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>It is interesting that an organization</p>
<p>that is so hyper-capitalist and so money-hungry</p>
<p>and is known to be very wealthy,</p>
<p>at its core is run by this group of C org members</p>
<p>that live a communist lifestyle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna jump around.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, what is C org?</p>
<p>What is C organization?</p>
<p>What is this organization?</p>
<p>The C organization is the most dedicated version,</p>
<p>the most dedicated brand of Scientologists.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s three echelons of Scientologists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s public, who just live normal lives</p>
<p>in the real world and they pay</p>
<p>to do Scientology courses and auditing.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s staff members, who also live in the real world,</p>
<p>but work on two-and-a-half-year contracts</p>
<p>or five-year contracts at their local Scientology</p>
<p>organization, and then once they finish their contract,</p>
<p>their debt is paid or whatever.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the C org members.</p>
<p>These are the guys who sign the billion-year contracts.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have lives in the outside world.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t own property.</p>
<p>They live in Scientology-provided housing.</p>
<p>They eat in Scientology-run cafeterias.</p>
<p>Is there an actual contract that says a billion years?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s symbolic, but yes.</p>
<p>Like, no, it&rsquo;s not a legally enforceable contract.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha!</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t succeeded in enforcing it</p>
<p>in any subsequent lifetimes yet.</p>
<p>Marriage contracts should be like that, a billion years.</p>
<p>Not until death do us part, but a billion years,</p>
<p>it really makes it very concrete</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re signing up for.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are the billion-year guys.</p>
<p>You hear a lot about the billion-year contract,</p>
<p>the billion-year contract.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the C org.</p>
<p>And all of Scientology management,</p>
<p>international management, middle management,</p>
<p>continental management, and even some lower-level</p>
<p>service orgs, are composed 100% of C org members.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to marry or date someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not in the C org.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also not allowed to have children.</p>
<p>With anybody outside of C org, or in general,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to have children?</p>
<p>C org members are not allowed to have children</p>
<p>unless they leave the C org.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re expected to have an abortion and stay in the C org,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the greatest good for Scientology,</p>
<p>if you accidentally get pregnant.</p>
<p>Interesting, because it distracts</p>
<p>from the focus of the work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about sexual relations?</p>
<p>Only once married, but that&rsquo;s why people get married</p>
<p>after like three days.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, hey you, you look all right, let&rsquo;s get married.</p>
<p>Are you allowed to have divorce?</p>
<p>Yeah, you get divorced a lot in the C org.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known people who get married and divorced</p>
<p>three times by the age of 25.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>Because in the C org, getting married</p>
<p>is practically like dating.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Also, unless you&rsquo;re married, you&rsquo;re living in dorms</p>
<p>with a bunch of other people.</p>
<p>So in order to get your own room,</p>
<p>you also have to get married.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many benefits.</p>
<p>Oh wow, okay.</p>
<p>So you mentioned communism, in which way,</p>
<p>because is there a hierarchy inside C org?</p>
<p>Is there a redistribution of influence,</p>
<p>position, money, power inside C org?</p>
<p>Everyone in the C org makes $50 a week.</p>
<p>Everybody, except David Miscavige, but.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And some posts might have a cash bonus incentive structure,</p>
<p>but fundamentally their pay is $50 a week.</p>
<p>So even the head of a big Scientology organization</p>
<p>is getting 50 bucks a week.</p>
<p>Are celebrities also part of C org or not usually?</p>
<p>So this is really the management layer.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the idea behind $50 a week?</p>
<p>Is that basically live a humble life?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to give you anything at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, oh, you mean like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the idea behind not paying?</p>
<p>Yeah, basically not paying.</p>
<p>Everything you need is already being provided for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not here for the money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working all the time anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you don&rsquo;t have days off.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re working all the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s no concept of the weekends.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, oh, thank God it&rsquo;s Friday.</p>
<p>Friday&rsquo;s just another day.</p>
<p>And how are the position, the tasks,</p>
<p>the jobs allocated within the C org?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Like what kind of tasks you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>What kind of stuff you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very similar to just any other business</p>
<p>as far as you can have your human resources,</p>
<p>you can have your sales,</p>
<p>you can have your accounting, your operations,</p>
<p>your quality control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that in Scientology,</p>
<p>your operations is delivering courses and auditing.</p>
<p>So your operations and your quality control</p>
<p>where most of the activity occurs</p>
<p>as far as delivering Scientology.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got your, you&rsquo;d call it business development,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just bringing in new members, right?</p>
<p>So the function of Scientology&rsquo;s organization</p>
<p>is very comparable to a normal business</p>
<p>in the normal world.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the products of this business,</p>
<p>auditing and courses.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s auditing?</p>
<p>So auditing is, so we described earlier,</p>
<p>Dianetics auditing.</p>
<p>Scientology auditing is very similar to that.</p>
<p>So at first glance, it looks like psychotherapy,</p>
<p>a kind of therapy.</p>
<p>All Scientology auditing is going to look like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one-on-one talk therapy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a room by yourselves, no distraction, no noise.</p>
<p>One-on-one?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like this?</p>
<p>Yeah, and in Scientology,</p>
<p>they have what&rsquo;s called an e-meter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Almost all auditing employs the use of an e-meter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an e-meter?</p>
<p>So an e-meter is a device that just measures the resistance</p>
<p>to a small electrical flow,</p>
<p>except Scientologists believe that this e-meter</p>
<p>can be used to simply direct the progress</p>
<p>of an auditing session,</p>
<p>to determine whether the auditing has reached</p>
<p>a good satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>All auditing sessions have to end</p>
<p>on a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the job of the auditor.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just, it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>sorry, the session sucked, see you next week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>Every auditing session has to end on a positive note.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s corrections to be made.</p>
<p>So the e-meter.</p>
<p>What does it look like visually?</p>
<p>Oh, you can pull it up.</p>
<p>Pull up mark eight, e-meter mark eight.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a few dials.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a basic information about time and duration,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m presuming, and then a dial</p>
<p>that just goes zero to something.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s say that the meter&rsquo;s in front of me</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the one holding the cans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m holding the cans, so you&rsquo;re doing the auditing of me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m holding the cans.</p>
<p>No, literally, in the beginning of an auditing session,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re calibrating the sensitivity of the e-meter,</p>
<p>you do a can squeeze.</p>
<p>So I go, squeeze the cans, please.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m just like squeezing the cans.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just changing the sensitivity,</p>
<p>because when you squeeze the cans,</p>
<p>I wanna get about a 1 3rd of a dial drop on the needle.</p>
<p>The idea is you don&rsquo;t want, if the needle&rsquo;s too sensitive,</p>
<p>then every time you shift around in your chair,</p>
<p>the needle&rsquo;s gonna bounce all over the place.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to set the sensitivity of this thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all, the knob there on the bottom to the left,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the sensitivity knob.</p>
<p>And that determines just how sensitive</p>
<p>the needle&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>And the bigger dial is called the tone arm.</p>
<p>And that is changing, I wanna say voltage or current,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not intending,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get one of those words is wrong, right?</p>
<p>But it is a real device.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real device.</p>
<p>That you can actually calibrate to probably,</p>
<p>you know, get an outcome that you want.</p>
<p>Yeah, so here&rsquo;s even how a Scientology auditor</p>
<p>believes it works.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re holding the cans,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tiny little battery in that e-meter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sending, you&rsquo;re completing the circuit</p>
<p>when you pick up the cans, right?</p>
<p>So you got a little thing going there.</p>
<p>And that needle will respond to your physical movement,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what we want.</p>
<p>We want you to sit the hell still</p>
<p>so that we can read this thing</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m asking you questions, okay?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re sitting there still, very still.</p>
<p>As still as you can, comfortable, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna go,</p>
<p>is there something you&rsquo;re withholding from me?</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m looking for is right when I say</p>
<p>at the end of me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for the needle to dip to the right.</p>
<p>Having a needle, even if it&rsquo;s kind of random,</p>
<p>can really be like a catalyst for conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s used for.</p>
<p>Except it&rsquo;s an enforced conversation.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a really good example of this.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re holding the cans.</p>
<p>Say, is there anything you&rsquo;re withholding from me?</p>
<p>And I get an instant read.</p>
<p>And I go, is there anything you&rsquo;re withholding from me?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see the needle.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t see the needle.</p>
<p>I go, well, what did you think of</p>
<p>when I asked you the question?</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve already had a lot of auditing,</p>
<p>you know how this goes.</p>
<p>It means I got an instant read</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not going to move on</p>
<p>until this question gets resolved.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re gonna go,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking of.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m gonna be like,</p>
<p>take a look and I&rsquo;ll help you out here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to steer you.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m looking to get roughly the same read</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re thinking about whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going, what was that?</p>
<p>What was that right there?</p>
<p>And you can start digging to what?</p>
<p>You can start.</p>
<p>I just want an answer to the question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I can go to memory.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can give me any answer you want.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way for me to know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re giving me the right answer,</p>
<p>but I want you to give me something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you say you can&rsquo;t give me anything,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna keep using the emitter</p>
<p>until you give me something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s say you give me something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get all the details about that</p>
<p>and until time, place, form, and event,</p>
<p>I wanna know everything that happened.</p>
<p>I wanna know all the details.</p>
<p>And by the way, I&rsquo;m writing all this down.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m taking notes of everything you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a bad thing that you did</p>
<p>that you haven&rsquo;t told me about.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m keeping notes.</p>
<p>When you represent to me</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve told me everything there is to tell,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for the needle</p>
<p>to give a smooth back and forth motion like this.</p>
<p>And Scientology calls that a floating needle.</p>
<p>That means, in Scientology land, we&rsquo;re done with that.</p>
<p>So now I might go back to check the question.</p>
<p>Okay, good, I&rsquo;ll check the question again.</p>
<p>Is there anything you&rsquo;re withholding from me?</p>
<p>Ooh, if I get another read,</p>
<p>we gotta go through the process again.</p>
<p>Okay, if you tell me I&rsquo;ve told you everything</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t get a floating needle,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta go, okay, is there an earlier similar thing?</p>
<p>Have you basically done an earlier similar thing?</p>
<p>Is there an earlier similar time</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t told someone something</p>
<p>or is there an earlier similar thing</p>
<p>that you did to the thing that you just told me?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna keep going earlier similar,</p>
<p>earlier similar, earlier similar</p>
<p>until I get a floating needle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where, explaining it this way,</p>
<p>you can see how no matter</p>
<p>what the specific auditing session happens to be about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still the potential in any auditing session</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going into past lives</p>
<p>just because you have to go earlier similar</p>
<p>until you get a floating needle.</p>
<p>Okay, now here&rsquo;s how Scientologists think</p>
<p>the e-meter actually works,</p>
<p>meaning why does the e-meter work?</p>
<p>So we talked before about these mental pictures, right?</p>
<p>These recordings, okay?</p>
<p>Well, we spoke about engrams,</p>
<p>just recordings of pain and unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Well, Scientology would hold the bad recordings</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t the only recordings that you have.</p>
<p>Those are just the recordings in your reactive mind.</p>
<p>You also have an analytical mind,</p>
<p>which is just your conscious memory,</p>
<p>conscious recording of everything from present time</p>
<p>to the last 76 trillion years.</p>
<p>And Hubbard would say that these memories</p>
<p>are actually a perfectly detailed recording.</p>
<p>I think he says like 56 perceptions or something.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>And you can access that information,</p>
<p>you just have trouble doing so.</p>
<p>Okay, so he says that these recordings,</p>
<p>these mental pictures have actual electrical charge and mass.</p>
<p>Now you asked before,</p>
<p>is there any actual physics in this?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, where are you supposed to store</p>
<p>the pictures of your last 76 trillion years</p>
<p>that have charge and mass?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it, but Hubbard says it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Okay, so he says that these things have mass.</p>
<p>And when you recall them or put attention on them,</p>
<p>you create an electrical flow,</p>
<p>which maybe through magnetic fields or whatever,</p>
<p>impinges upon the electrical flow of the e-meter</p>
<p>and it shows up as a read on the needle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Scientologists believe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the needle reads.</p>
<p>Now cynics would say the needle only reads</p>
<p>on palm sweat and movement.</p>
<p>Well, I know that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Right, I can&rsquo;t tell you everything the needle does read on,</p>
<p>but I can tell you it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>moving your hands and sweaty hands.</p>
<p>It does correlate to thoughts probably.</p>
<p>Some way, somehow.</p>
<p>Because if it didn&rsquo;t correlate to thoughts,</p>
<p>then this process would be way too inefficient.</p>
<p>Because it would be too,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of people who are just not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get the,</p>
<p>what is it called, the floating needle.</p>
<p>Like no matter what.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain to you how you get a floating needle,</p>
<p>but it sure as hell isn&rsquo;t hand sweat</p>
<p>and it sure as hell isn&rsquo;t squeezing the cans.</p>
<p>Right, so you eventually,</p>
<p>most people will get to the floating needle.</p>
<p>And somehow. You get floating needles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a feed,</p>
<p>there probably is a feedback mechanism</p>
<p>that each person realizes how their mind and body,</p>
<p>because you want a resolution, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably. You want your needle to float.</p>
<p>For both people. Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably a great experience</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like, yes, it&rsquo;s a gamified feeling, right?</p>
<p>Well, when you&rsquo;re training on how to use the e-meter,</p>
<p>there are drills where you practice</p>
<p>generating with your mind various needle reactions.</p>
<p>So, you know, there is a drill where you sit there</p>
<p>and you consciously try to create a floating needle</p>
<p>by recalling happy thoughts.</p>
<p>You go to your happy place.</p>
<p>And at the end of every auditing session,</p>
<p>you actually have to go to a third party,</p>
<p>sit down in front of an e-meter</p>
<p>and verify that your needle&rsquo;s floating.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Every single auditing session</p>
<p>not only has to end on a floating needle,</p>
<p>but then you have to go to someone else</p>
<p>and have the floating needle verified.</p>
<p>Any Scientologist who&rsquo;s a seasoned recipient of auditing</p>
<p>knows how to make their needle float at the examiner.</p>
<p>Well, I gotta be honest though,</p>
<p>this process, again, sorry to be sort of going there,</p>
<p>but it feels like this is a very rigorous</p>
<p>talk therapy session.</p>
<p>Is there good aspects to this?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>A lot of people find auditing very helpful.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard some describe it</p>
<p>as quite thoroughly addictive.</p>
<p>Me personally, I never enjoyed getting auditing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably more a function of having been raised in it.</p>
<p>And it was never something I wanted to do.</p>
<p>It was something that was forced on me as a child.</p>
<p>And also I was never, I don&rsquo;t like talking</p>
<p>about private secret stuff.</p>
<p>Like you kind of have to want to be an open book</p>
<p>to honestly and thoroughly participate</p>
<p>in an auditing session.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s not necessarily a belief</p>
<p>that this is gonna be private.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no expectation of privacy,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no expectation</p>
<p>that your stuff&rsquo;s gonna be leaked for blackmail either.</p>
<p>I mean, you trust the people in the organization.</p>
<p>Even despite rumors and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But the rumors are coming from people</p>
<p>that are lying to you, essentially.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Scientologist,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re participating in an auditing session,</p>
<p>you know that anyone in the organization</p>
<p>has the ability to know the stuff that you talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh my God, I&rsquo;m only telling my auditor</p>
<p>because I think no one&rsquo;s ever gonna know.</p>
<p>You know that people know.</p>
<p>But you also trust the organization.</p>
<p>How quickly does it go to past memories?</p>
<p>For people who are seasoned,</p>
<p>like they actually like going past life.</p>
<p>I hated it.</p>
<p>I would make sure, I was really good</p>
<p>at making my needle float.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to have some auditor,</p>
<p>because I never believed in the past life memories.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t want to be in that impassable,</p>
<p>reach an impasse in an auditing session</p>
<p>where I was being asked for something I couldn&rsquo;t provide.</p>
<p>Because I knew this auditing session</p>
<p>has to end on a good point.</p>
<p>But Scientologists enjoy, for the most part,</p>
<p>they call it whole track.</p>
<p>Whole track is past life.</p>
<p>Going whole track.</p>
<p>Your time track, they call it the time track,</p>
<p>is your whole memory.</p>
<p>But whole track refers to anything past life.</p>
<p>So going whole track or deep whole track with high reality.</p>
<p>Meaning it&rsquo;s not like, oh, I have a fuzzy memory</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Like your real seasoned Scientologists are like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, I was on this planet at this time,</p>
<p>circling this star, and this is what I was eating</p>
<p>for breakfast.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>Before the origin of life on Earth,</p>
<p>so billions of years ago, on a distant planet</p>
<p>where you were eating for breakfast.</p>
<p>Or other universes.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a nice shortcut</p>
<p>to sneak up to actual trauma that happened to you</p>
<p>as a therapy device.</p>
<p>I just, so putting Scientology aside,</p>
<p>I just am thinking about, as a technique for therapy,</p>
<p>discussing, basically, some people have trauma,</p>
<p>and one of the things you do with therapy</p>
<p>is bring the trauma to the surface.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the stuff that happened to you in childhood.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a more convenient thing to do</p>
<p>to kind of map that indirectly onto a fictitious telling</p>
<p>of what happened to you, something like that trauma</p>
<p>on a distant planet elsewhere.</p>
<p>Could be a nice way to sneak up to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it goes both flows there.</p>
<p>Not just things that have happened to you,</p>
<p>but things that you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So you could be being asked for,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be going back to, I wiped out a civilization.</p>
<p>I committed genocide on this rice on this planet.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>But so you can actually take on a whole new guilt.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So I, okay, all right.</p>
<p>You might actually take on a lot more guilt than I go of.</p>
<p>Because if you feel like that self-critical aspect</p>
<p>of the brain, boy, because my brain is really self-critical.</p>
<p>So I could see myself manufacturing,</p>
<p>if I was forced to over time,</p>
<p>some kind of story where I did genocide</p>
<p>a whole population of like Pluto or something</p>
<p>at a distant, somewhere in Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean.</p>
<p>And now I walk around with that guilt.</p>
<p>Wait, I&rsquo;m actually a horrible person.</p>
<p>So imagine though, if you had not only are you looking at,</p>
<p>you know, if someone&rsquo;s being self-critical,</p>
<p>trying to identify destructive patterns of behavior</p>
<p>in your present life.</p>
<p>But what if you really internalize the fact that</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t only been this way for 40 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been this way for 40 trillion years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But Scientology would argue that as a thetan</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re inherently good.</p>
<p>All thetans are basically good.</p>
<p>So the goal of the auditing procedure there</p>
<p>would be essentially to figure out, find the moment,</p>
<p>find what it was that caused you to make that shift</p>
<p>as a being to dramatize, you know,</p>
<p>evil intentions and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re going whole track,</p>
<p>looking at all the horrible things you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>the goal is to find like,</p>
<p>well, what happened just prior to that?</p>
<p>What was like the prior confusion?</p>
<p>And what did you misunderstand</p>
<p>just before that and whatnot?</p>
<p>So the goal is basically,</p>
<p>so Scientologists after a lot of auditing</p>
<p>are also convinced that they have fixed</p>
<p>the reason for any non-optimum conduct.</p>
<p>And underlying this is a belief that</p>
<p>at the core, we&rsquo;re all good.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of really powerful ideas in Scientology,</p>
<p>which is so interesting that it goes wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, what about the training you mentioned,</p>
<p>the training of the auditor?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s, how lengthy is that process?</p>
<p>It can take years.</p>
<p>I mean, one of that question I wanna ask is,</p>
<p>are people in Sea Org, like as an auditor,</p>
<p>do you believe everything?</p>
<p>How much, is there a crisis of faith that creeps in?</p>
<p>In religion, you have a crisis of faith</p>
<p>when you start to wonder like, does God even exist?</p>
<p>So in this case, how often do you start to doubt</p>
<p>that some of the core beliefs of Scientology are false?</p>
<p>Scientology would say that Scientology is not about beliefs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about application of the techniques</p>
<p>of Scientology auditing to improve</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s spiritual awareness and ability.</p>
<p>So the belief level of Scientology</p>
<p>is pretty much the stuff we&rsquo;ve already discussed.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the auditing process.</p>
<p>So the effectiveness of the auditing process,</p>
<p>this is one of the things Hubbard says,</p>
<p>is that standard tech, standard Scientology,</p>
<p>they call it the tech,</p>
<p>the technology of how to deliver auditing,</p>
<p>standard tech, works 100% of the time</p>
<p>when applied 100% correctly.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s kind of unfalsifiable, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because any time it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t applied correctly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice little escape hatch</p>
<p>to pull on having a crisis of faith.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Well, then obviously it wasn&rsquo;t applied correctly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where quality control comes in.</p>
<p>Their job is to nitpick,</p>
<p>and you can always find one thing</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t done correctly.</p>
<p>Communism didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t implemented correctly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always an escape hatch with ideologies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I would probably argue that auditors</p>
<p>are not in a position of having many crisis of faith,</p>
<p>because actually they&rsquo;re usually seeing people,</p>
<p>for the most part, improve in some ways</p>
<p>through the process of auditing.</p>
<p>Now, auditing can create like a state</p>
<p>of somewhat of a euphoric state.</p>
<p>You feel great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just blown out of your head.</p>
<p>You know, you feel on top of the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that in some of my auditing.</p>
<p>As an auditor, sorry?</p>
<p>No, as a person receiving auditing.</p>
<p>And so my point is that as an auditor</p>
<p>doing a lot of auditing,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re gonna have someone in front of you</p>
<p>called the pre-clear is the person in front of you</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s getting the auditing,</p>
<p>called the PC or the pre-clear.</p>
<p>They see over and over and over again,</p>
<p>these PCs having these sort of euphoric states</p>
<p>and floating needles,</p>
<p>and I feel great and fantastic.</p>
<p>No, thanks, you saved my life,</p>
<p>and da-da-da-da-da.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve always said,</p>
<p>if people didn&rsquo;t find Scientology helpful,</p>
<p>nobody would ever stay in Scientology.</p>
<p>And so auditors are pretty much the ones</p>
<p>doing the heavy lifting</p>
<p>of what it even means to be a Scientologist.</p>
<p>Those guys aren&rsquo;t the ones</p>
<p>that you end up having crisis of faith.</p>
<p>I mean, doing Scientology, auditing,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t require that you just have faith</p>
<p>that you believe something.</p>
<p>You just have to go through these motions.</p>
<p>And Scientologists, one of the reasons Scientologists</p>
<p>think this is all scientific</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you believe why this works.</p>
<p>I care how you feel at the end of an auditing session.</p>
<p>And empirically speaking,</p>
<p>like anecdotal data is,</p>
<p>it actually seems to improve people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>within the context.</p>
<p>So taking the outside world out of it,</p>
<p>within this particular organization,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually measurably seeing improvement.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is that to some degree real?</p>
<p>Because like, if you look at a book like Animal Farm,</p>
<p>where the pigs start to rule the other animals,</p>
<p>and over time, the life of the animals</p>
<p>gets worse and worse and worse</p>
<p>while the pigs keep saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually getting better and better and better.</p>
<p>Again, communism, same thing.</p>
<p>The rationing is getting worse and worse and worse,</p>
<p>less and less food.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s constant reporting</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s more and more food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re winning, hashtag.</p>
<p>I would argue that what you&rsquo;ve just described</p>
<p>could be an identical description</p>
<p>of what it feels like and what it means to go up.</p>
<p>Scientology&rsquo;s bridge to total freedom.</p>
<p>You are reinforcing to yourself</p>
<p>that everything&rsquo;s getting better and better and better.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t spend time with your family anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re broke, even though you make a lot of money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always stressed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at the beck and call of these people</p>
<p>who seem to run your lives.</p>
<p>Like, how a Scientologist feels about their own life is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very interesting to compare that</p>
<p>to how that person&rsquo;s life looks</p>
<p>to their non-Scientology family members.</p>
<p>I get contacted by a lot of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve never been in Scientology,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re like, I got a family member</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really deep,</p>
<p>and can you help me understand some things?</p>
<p>Why is this person&rsquo;s life like this?</p>
<p>Why is this person&rsquo;s life like this?</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t wanna say that Scientologists</p>
<p>do not actually, I don&rsquo;t wanna say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s all in their heads.</p>
<p>They think they&rsquo;re being helped, but they&rsquo;re really not.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t feel honest, you know?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s this thing where if Scientology</p>
<p>was just getting auditing when you wanted,</p>
<p>about the subjects you wanted,</p>
<p>and you could take it or leave it,</p>
<p>that would be fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that it&rsquo;s part and parcel</p>
<p>to this entire organization and this entire experience</p>
<p>that has, as a part of that experience,</p>
<p>taking everything from you,</p>
<p>demanding everything from you,</p>
<p>controlling who you can speak with,</p>
<p>controlling who you can have relationships with,</p>
<p>who you have to erase from your life.</p>
<p>This is where, and it&rsquo;s hard to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to place one pinpoint on,</p>
<p>this is where Scientology goes wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to do that,</p>
<p>because the good parts of Scientology</p>
<p>and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s definition of what&rsquo;s bad for you,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably, in the beginning, is bad for you.</p>
<p>This almost just sounds like a template</p>
<p>of a toxic relationship.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff in this world</p>
<p>that is just not good for you,</p>
<p>so the authoritarian says, like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just protecting you by blocking you off</p>
<p>from those negative things,</p>
<p>and they are probably negative things,</p>
<p>but then this freedom starts closing in</p>
<p>to where you can&rsquo;t no longer speak freely,</p>
<p>think freely, act freely, and there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why sort of power corrupts,</p>
<p>and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>That person doing the controlling</p>
<p>actually starts getting that dopamine rush</p>
<p>of the controller that&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vicious negative cycle,</p>
<p>so you start out as a, it starts out good,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to do good for the person,</p>
<p>but then it somehow goes to shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what are the aspects that just,</p>
<p>that are often controlled about a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in Scientology, especially Sea Org?</p>
<p>Well, information control, access to the internet,</p>
<p>access to any information critical of Scientology.</p>
<p>Is some internet access allowed?</p>
<p>Public Scientologists has no restrictions</p>
<p>to their access to the internet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not allowed</p>
<p>to read anything critical of Scientology.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so they&rsquo;re supposed to self-control</p>
<p>what they read or not, and what&rsquo;s the explanation?</p>
<p>Is it always assumed</p>
<p>that anything critical of Scientology is a lie?</p>
<p>They really push this thing that</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;ve been in a Scientology organization yourself,</p>
<p>or unless you&rsquo;ve actually been a Scientologist,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t possibly know the truth about Scientology.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only getting information</p>
<p>from people who aren&rsquo;t members or former members,</p>
<p>then you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be getting</p>
<p>the correct information.</p>
<p>Now, they don&rsquo;t realize the math there doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>If you can find out the true information</p>
<p>by becoming and being a Scientologist,</p>
<p>then that means you can get the correct information</p>
<p>from a former Scientologist,</p>
<p>because they traveled that path</p>
<p>and they got the correct information.</p>
<p>So they still create this,</p>
<p>they try to create this unfalsifiable loop</p>
<p>where unless you are personally doing it,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have correct information.</p>
<p>And you go, what about people who did personally do it,</p>
<p>got the correct information, left,</p>
<p>and are now sharing that with others?</p>
<p>Well, no, those are lies.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so just anything you don&rsquo;t like is a lie then.</p>
<p>You go, yeah, pretty much, that&rsquo;s kind of how it works.</p>
<p>So what about the control</p>
<p>of negative information on the internet?</p>
<p>What the actual operations?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, you know, preparing, I should admit,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know too much about Scientology.</p>
<p>I was doing a bunch of reading,</p>
<p>and the Wikipedia page on Scientology,</p>
<p>interestingly enough, is not that negative</p>
<p>about Scientology.</p>
<p>So it made me ask, you have to be a little bit careful</p>
<p>how you consume stuff from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You have to consider, because money can buy things there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain special interests and so on.</p>
<p>But it made me wonder,</p>
<p>like with a lot of controversial topics,</p>
<p>what is true, and where do I look,</p>
<p>where do I go for truth?</p>
<p>So like how much sort of deliberate action is there</p>
<p>to control what is true on the internet by Scientology?</p>
<p>Well, these days, they&rsquo;ve pretty much, I think,</p>
<p>thrown in the towel.</p>
<p>But the Scientology middle management</p>
<p>was editing Wikipedia so often from IP addresses</p>
<p>that were traced back to the Scientology buildings</p>
<p>that Wikipedia locked them out from any IP addresses</p>
<p>associated with Scientology from being able to edit it.</p>
<p>The Scientology was so infatuated</p>
<p>with trying to control the information,</p>
<p>and in the early days of the internet,</p>
<p>they had a certain degree of success with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hopeless these days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the scale, the scale&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>But actually, I&rsquo;m very surprised how bot farms,</p>
<p>how effective they can be at a very small scale.</p>
<p>If you just pay 100 people to spread narratives.</p>
<p>But the reason that&rsquo;s effective</p>
<p>is you can kind of create conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that create chaos, and nobody knows what is true.</p>
<p>That bot farms can do.</p>
<p>But actually really nicely control a narrative is hard.</p>
<p>So to create chaos, it&rsquo;s easier to do.</p>
<p>To basically say like, you know, do PR control is very hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, so especially on the internet,</p>
<p>especially when the critical eye is there.</p>
<p>The internet can smell bullshit,</p>
<p>which is one of the really,</p>
<p>really powerful thing about the internet.</p>
<p>And I gotta tell you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the reasons I do my YouTube channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I decided to upload every day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve uploaded every day for the last six months.</p>
<p>I just wanted there to be a nonstop flow of information</p>
<p>of any kind and any variety,</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s fair and balanced,</p>
<p>intelligent, interesting,</p>
<p>that Scientologists who stumble upon the internet</p>
<p>will go, oh look, someone&rsquo;s talking about my thing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what they got going on.</p>
<p>And I know this guy.</p>
<p>The fact that Scientology crushes so much information.</p>
<p>Before YouTube, before like,</p>
<p>I have the only like big Scientology channel.</p>
<p>And that only got big in the last six months.</p>
<p>Okay, so before that, there were channels, there was things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost like it took a lot of like,</p>
<p>people felt like it took a lot of bravery and courage</p>
<p>to like say something on the internet about Scientology.</p>
<p>And so people would pop up</p>
<p>and there weren&rsquo;t very many voices.</p>
<p>And I was like, I want this to be prolific.</p>
<p>I want to be prolific.</p>
<p>I want to have 30 or 40 other channels being prolific</p>
<p>so that Scientology couldn&rsquo;t possibly</p>
<p>successfully control the narrative about it.</p>
<p>Have you been personally attacked?</p>
<p>AaronSmith11.com is a website</p>
<p>created by the Church of Scientology.</p>
<p>Have you seen it?</p>
<p>No, what kind of content is on there?</p>
<p>Oh, Aaron&rsquo;s abusive father and a horrible husband</p>
<p>and the worst staff member we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>And oh, I openly talk about it</p>
<p>because I think the fact that Scientology</p>
<p>even does things like that is fucking hilarious.</p>
<p>And anything they try to do to me,</p>
<p>the way I think about it is,</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re just giving me an opportunity</p>
<p>to turn the mirror back on you</p>
<p>and show everyone how horrible you are.</p>
<p>Does it stick?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So you find that there is ineffective?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely ineffective.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so over the top.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you how the website even came into being.</p>
<p>So I was on the first season of</p>
<p>Leah Remini&rsquo;s Scientology in the Aftermath.</p>
<p>Every single person who participated in that show</p>
<p>got a website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that everyone else&rsquo;s website is like,</p>
<p>whoismarkhedley.com, whoismikerender.com.</p>
<p>Well, I bought whoisaaronsmith11.com,</p>
<p>but I was too stupid to buy Aaron,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t buy aaronsmith11.com.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually the only one</p>
<p>who has a website in their name.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I could probably get a lawyer</p>
<p>to get it back for me, but I&rsquo;m like, why?</p>
<p>I want everyone to see what a nasty, petty,</p>
<p>disgusting organization that this is.</p>
<p>And nobody believes anything Scientology says anyway.</p>
<p>Does the general public know</p>
<p>that it comes from Scientology?</p>
<p>Pull it up.</p>
<p>It says right on the bottom, copyright 2000 whatever,</p>
<p>Church of Scientology International.</p>
<p>Like they didn&rsquo;t even try to hide it.</p>
<p>aaronsmith11.com.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A man with no moral compass.</p>
<p>Aaron Smith, who is he really?</p>
<p>Aaron Smith Levin, a man with no moral compass.</p>
<p>Read about Aaron Smith Levin,</p>
<p>an angry man spreading hate from the internet&rsquo;s shadows.</p>
<p>Open mouth shot.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying like at the,</p>
<p>but wow, there&rsquo;s testimonies.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s videos from former coworkers.</p>
<p>The slightest thing just sets him off</p>
<p>and he just goes totally nuts.</p>
<p>Well, that one is true.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand why you slapped me</p>
<p>before the interview.</p>
<p>I felt that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got links to everyone else&rsquo;s website on the bottom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>Who is, okay, the other one.</p>
<p>2021 Church of Scientology International,</p>
<p>all rights reserved.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of just Scientology&rsquo;s</p>
<p>complete lack of self-awareness.</p>
<p>So me and Mike Rinder,</p>
<p>we went and have these on like a house flip project, right?</p>
<p>You know, Mike Rinder.</p>
<p>You know Mike Rinder.</p>
<p>Do I?</p>
<p>He gave me a bobblehead of the guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him.</p>
<p>I was just, I would like to talk to him about him,</p>
<p>but this, there&rsquo;s a very fine gentleman here</p>
<p>with a bobblehead.</p>
<p>The reason we created the bobblehead</p>
<p>is because on Mike Rinder&rsquo;s hate site,</p>
<p>Scientology created a gif or a gif.</p>
<p>How do you say it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right way to say it?</p>
<p>The correct way is gif.</p>
<p>Gif, good.</p>
<p>Scientology created a gif of Mike Rinder as a bobblehead.</p>
<p>It was an insult, like,</p>
<p>oh, all he does is sit next to Leah Remedy</p>
<p>and go, yes, Leah, yes, Leah.</p>
<p>And so they made a gif of him with a bobblehead.</p>
<p>So we were like, we&rsquo;re gonna make Mike Rinder bobbleheads</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna sell them on the spshop.com</p>
<p>to raise money for the Aftermath Foundation.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now that I-</p>
<p>So go out and buy.</p>
<p>Yeah, go to the spshop.com</p>
<p>and get yourself a Mike Rinder bobblehead.</p>
<p>Now look, now that my profile&rsquo;s getting a little higher,</p>
<p>this head was made to bobble.</p>
<p>Like this smooth, shiny head needs its own bobblehead now.</p>
<p>It does, 100% does.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So, but let me show you.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>We just hired some day laborers off of what,</p>
<p>like Craigslist or something.</p>
<p>So what Scientology did was they had a private investigator</p>
<p>stake out the house flip project.</p>
<p>They were clearly running license plates</p>
<p>of anyone who visited the property</p>
<p>because otherwise how would they find out</p>
<p>the laborer&rsquo;s names, do background checks on them</p>
<p>to find out they had criminal records?</p>
<p>And they published this as if it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>reflect negatively on me.</p>
<p>Oh, we hired someone to do work who had a criminal record?</p>
<p>Who gives a shit?</p>
<p>Do you know one of the biggest problems</p>
<p>people with records have is finding employment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing bad about hiring someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got a criminal record.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t reflect negatively on me,</p>
<p>but it shows you what they think about those people.</p>
<p>It shows you what they think about people</p>
<p>who are trying to put their lives back together</p>
<p>and maybe, you know, actually work for a living.</p>
<p>And it also shows that they&rsquo;re surveilling us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, they don&rsquo;t realize that putting this up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re publishing information that they could only have</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re surveilling me and Mike</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t occur to them,</p>
<p>maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t put that up.</p>
<p>Just the general process, sad to say, of journalism</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re looking for any kind of dirt</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re trying to conjure up a story</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something about drama</p>
<p>and negative stories that get clicks and so on.</p>
<p>So this is a general process.</p>
<p>The more, especially the more celebrity you become,</p>
<p>the more of these kinds of attacks come</p>
<p>and they look for any kind of thing that could be,</p>
<p>you know, it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be facts.</p>
<p>It could be just asking, who is he really?</p>
<p>Seems to have traction on the internet.</p>
<p>What is the actual truth of the man</p>
<p>you keep claiming you are,</p>
<p>of the good man you keep claiming you are?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But sometimes that can be effective.</p>
<p>But I think if you&rsquo;re being transparent and authentic</p>
<p>and just putting yourself out there completely</p>
<p>and your story completely,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s the best way to fight it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other reason to be prolific</p>
<p>on the internet, right?</p>
<p>The reason Joe Rogan can&rsquo;t get canceled</p>
<p>is because anyone can watch thousands of hours</p>
<p>of the authentic Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t misrepresent him</p>
<p>because he spent thousands of hours</p>
<p>representing himself genuinely.</p>
<p>Yeah, the nice thing when you&rsquo;re representing yourself</p>
<p>genuinely, you should be a good person.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a good person, then the internet will know.</p>
<p>They can smell out the bullshit.</p>
<p>Who is David Miscavige?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even like,</p>
<p>because you said L. Ron Hubbard founded Scientology.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the story of how we transitioned</p>
<p>from that to David Miscavige.</p>
<p>The current leader of Scientology.</p>
<p>He was actually not selected by L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>to take over,</p>
<p>but ended up usurping power and taking over.</p>
<p>It sounds like Stalin and Trotsky and communism,</p>
<p>similar story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the person oftentimes in the situation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the natural successor to power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one that takes power.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think the quote,</p>
<p>sometimes it gets attributed to David Miscavige is,</p>
<p>power is not given, it is assumed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>The last six years of L. Ron Hubbard&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>he was often a seclusion,</p>
<p>essentially hiding from lawsuits.</p>
<p>Now, by the time Hubbard went off into seclusion,</p>
<p>Miscavige had sort of already risen up</p>
<p>through the ranks of the C organization.</p>
<p>Now, Miscavige was like a teenager,</p>
<p>either like 11, 12, 13, something like that.</p>
<p>Miscavige was not born into Scientology,</p>
<p>but he was a young boy</p>
<p>when his father got into Scientology.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Miscavige did start working as a C org member.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one organization that existed</p>
<p>to essentially serve Hubbard directly</p>
<p>and to represent his interests.</p>
<p>And that was called the Commodore.</p>
<p>He was the Commodore of the C organization.</p>
<p>The Commodore&rsquo;s Messenger&rsquo;s organization,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna call it the CMO.</p>
<p>Miscavige started working for the CMO</p>
<p>pretty early on in his C org career,</p>
<p>by the way, as did Mike Rinder,</p>
<p>mini Mike.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so he just became known as a doer,</p>
<p>like a guy who&rsquo;ll get it done.</p>
<p>No excuses, no stops, get it done.</p>
<p>So he had made a name for himself in the CMO</p>
<p>around the time, by the time Hubbard</p>
<p>went off into seclusion.</p>
<p>Now, when he went off into seclusion,</p>
<p>he took two other CMO,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna call them messengers, right?</p>
<p>Commodore&rsquo;s messengers.</p>
<p>He took two other messengers with him,</p>
<p>Pat and Annie Broker.</p>
<p>Now it has been said by people,</p>
<p>Mike, Mike Rinder has told me,</p>
<p>he goes, the reason Pat and Annie went off with LRH</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t necessarily because he desperately wanted them to,</p>
<p>but partly because we could afford to let them go.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t necessarily need them.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And between the two of them,</p>
<p>Annie was the one who was like a really compassionate person,</p>
<p>intelligent person, caring person.</p>
<p>Was there a possible trajectory of this world</p>
<p>where she was the one that took over?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In fact, Pat and Annie Broker were the two people</p>
<p>that were supposed to take over.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But because Pat and Annie were with Hubbard in seclusion,</p>
<p>Miscavige basically had the complete run of the operation</p>
<p>without any oversight from Hubbard.</p>
<p>The only way any information would get</p>
<p>from Scientology World to Hubbard</p>
<p>is Miscavige and Pat Broker</p>
<p>would meet at a confidential location,</p>
<p>and Miscavige would give Broker any information</p>
<p>he wanted to go to LRH.</p>
<p>So if Miscavige wanted to get rid of somebody,</p>
<p>all he had to do was feed LRH false information</p>
<p>that this person had been caught doing something treasonous.</p>
<p>And then he would get in response some order</p>
<p>from LRH to get rid of this person.</p>
<p>So are there so many similarities</p>
<p>between various communist regimes and fascist regimes?</p>
<p>Well, Hitler did the same thing</p>
<p>when he became the Supreme Leader.</p>
<p>He had to take power.</p>
<p>Yeah, he had to wait for the president to die,</p>
<p>but the whole time there&rsquo;s a control on information</p>
<p>and a slow aggregation of power.</p>
<p>Of course, with nations it&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>because if you control the military, you control a lot.</p>
<p>So you have to also get the generals on your side</p>
<p>and so on, but I&rsquo;m sure in this situation</p>
<p>there is similar kind of dynamics.</p>
<p>You have to get certain people on your side,</p>
<p>control the flow of information,</p>
<p>let the original founder, the original leader die off,</p>
<p>and make sure that you are the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s left with the power.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So whereas Pat and Annie are off with LRH,</p>
<p>all of Scientology&rsquo;s attorneys and accountants</p>
<p>and lobbyists and whatever, they all know Dave.</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s the one they deal with.</p>
<p>LRH passes away, Pat and Annie make disappearance.</p>
<p>Nobody knows Pat and Annie.</p>
<p>Everybody knows Dave.</p>
<p>And so he ended up getting rid of Pat and Annie.</p>
<p>This is a very short, perhaps slightly bastardized version</p>
<p>of it, of Miscavige basically.</p>
<p>They had been ushering just suitcases of cash</p>
<p>to L. Ron Hubbard during this time.</p>
<p>So you have Miscavige handing boatloads of cash</p>
<p>to Pat Broker.</p>
<p>Pat would do crazy things like hide the money</p>
<p>in the walls of houses and dig pits and everything.</p>
<p>So Miscavige basically threatened to turn Pat Broker</p>
<p>over to the IRS for tax evasion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part, Pat Broker&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>Is he a Scientologist or no?</p>
<p>No, he basically went away and kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>She died a handful of years ago.</p>
<p>She stayed a loyal Sea Org member until the very end.</p>
<p>But literally, Miscavige put her on menial tasks</p>
<p>like she had no authority whatsoever.</p>
<p>She was just put on menial tasks,</p>
<p>washing dishes, but not really, groundskeeper,</p>
<p>just stupid low-level assistant, paper pusher stuff.</p>
<p>She never operated with any actual authority,</p>
<p>even though she was supposed to be the one</p>
<p>to take over her and Pat.</p>
<p>So on David Miscavige, difficult question,</p>
<p>but can you make both the case that he is a good man</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s misunderstood and the case that he&rsquo;s not a good man?</p>
<p>First of all, I believe that Miscavige</p>
<p>is a true believer in Scientology.</p>
<p>I do believe that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really important question.</p>
<p>Do you think he believes in all the thetans and all of that?</p>
<p>He definitely believes in that.</p>
<p>I think he believes in Scientology,</p>
<p>but in a different way than all other Scientologists</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s aware of a lot more information,</p>
<p>damaging information about L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>and the true story of Scientology than most people.</p>
<p>So his version of belief is different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one example here.</p>
<p>So Scientology&rsquo;s bridge to total freedom</p>
<p>goes up to what they call OT8,</p>
<p>Operating Thetan Level Eight, okay?</p>
<p>Scientologists have all been told</p>
<p>that L. Ron Hubbard, before he passed,</p>
<p>finished, completed, putting together OT9, 10, 11, 12,</p>
<p>13, 14, and 15.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sitting in the vault, waiting to be released.</p>
<p>This is part of the Scientology belief system</p>
<p>because remember, I said going up Scientology&rsquo;s bridge</p>
<p>to total freedom is how you&rsquo;re supposed to get back</p>
<p>to your native godlike state.</p>
<p>Well, all the Scientologists in the world</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve already done OT8 know that they haven&rsquo;t gotten there,</p>
<p>but they still believe in Scientology</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re told there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>Miscavige knows there is no more.</p>
<p>So Miscavige knows the fundamental promise</p>
<p>of being able to achieve full Operating Thetan is a lie.</p>
<p>He knows L. Ron Hubbard didn&rsquo;t accomplish that,</p>
<p>so therefore, no one else is going to accomplish it as well.</p>
<p>If L. Ron Hubbard had accomplished it,</p>
<p>Miscavige knows, well, he didn&rsquo;t write it up.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t leave instructions</p>
<p>for how anyone else would accomplish it.</p>
<p>So no matter what, Miscavige knows</p>
<p>that the fundamental promise</p>
<p>that what Scientology is saying they will be able</p>
<p>to deliver to mankind is a lie.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s gonna sound like I&rsquo;m contradicting myself</p>
<p>because it sounds like I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>well, he knows it&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>I think he believes that L. Ron Hubbard just failed</p>
<p>to finish his work, and he&rsquo;s kind of hoping L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>is gonna come back to finish the job</p>
<p>because L. Ron Hubbard did tell the people</p>
<p>at the International Management Base,</p>
<p>at least a core of them, that he was coming back.</p>
<p>Now, we know that David Miscavige believed this</p>
<p>because right around the 21-year mark,</p>
<p>he was supposed to come back like 21 years after he died.</p>
<p>Right around the 21-year mark,</p>
<p>David Miscavige was getting busy putting some things</p>
<p>in place that had to get done</p>
<p>in case L. Ron Hubbard came back.</p>
<p>So we know he at least believed to that level.</p>
<p>Do you believe that L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>can sort of enter his own body?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not how it works in Scientology.</p>
<p>Okay, so you can&rsquo;t have a transfer of thetans.</p>
<p>If you were full OT, you could.</p>
<p>Can you describe the OT again?</p>
<p>So OT levels, OT one, two, three, four, five to the eight.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>How do you get to level one?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna answer this question</p>
<p>by first connecting some dots.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We spoke earlier in the interview</p>
<p>about achieving your native god-like state.</p>
<p>That in Scientology is called native state.</p>
<p>Native state and full operating thetan</p>
<p>mean the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Because at native state, you are a fully operating thetan.</p>
<p>Operating meaning operating in your full capacity.</p>
<p>So OT means operating thetan.</p>
<p>So the upper confidential half of Scientology&rsquo;s bridge</p>
<p>are called the OT levels, the operating thetan levels.</p>
<p>And these, and remember, they&rsquo;re confidential.</p>
<p>So most Scientologists have not done these levels.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s on them.</p>
<p>It is on these levels that you learn</p>
<p>about the xenu in the body thetan story.</p>
<p>Can you describe xenu, please?</p>
<p>We spoke earlier about how at the lower</p>
<p>non-confidential levels of Scientology&rsquo;s bridge,</p>
<p>Hubbard is saying that what&rsquo;s wrong with you</p>
<p>is your reactive mind.</p>
<p>Okay, well in Scientology,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve gotten rid of your reactive mind,</p>
<p>that is what&rsquo;s called the state of clear.</p>
<p>Okay, so after you finish state of clear,</p>
<p>the next thing on the bridge is the OT levels.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;ve already gotten rid of your active mind,</p>
<p>what the heck are you supposed to do now?</p>
<p>Well, now L. Ron Hubbard says,</p>
<p>okay, first, what was wrong with you</p>
<p>was just your reactive mind.</p>
<p>But now the next thing you have to resolve,</p>
<p>the next thing that&rsquo;s wrong with you</p>
<p>is you actually have tens of thousands of thetans</p>
<p>stuck to your body,</p>
<p>and they all have their own reactive minds.</p>
<p>You have to audit the thetans.</p>
<p>How do you audit the thetans?</p>
<p>Are these like different shades of your inner mind,</p>
<p>and you just have to try to access them somehow?</p>
<p>You use the e-meter, just like we spoke about,</p>
<p>except now you&rsquo;ve got a divider that separates the cans</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t short circuit,</p>
<p>and you hold both cans in one hand,</p>
<p>and you have the e-meter in front of you,</p>
<p>so now you&rsquo;re auditing yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telepathically talking</p>
<p>to the thetans that are stuck to you.</p>
<p>You are thinking the commands</p>
<p>instead of saying them out loud,</p>
<p>and you sort of do drills where you practice</p>
<p>looking for e-meter reads at the instant you have a thought.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telepathically auditing spirits</p>
<p>that L. Ron Hubbard says are stuck to your body.</p>
<p>Does this sound like a recipe for a mental breakdown?</p>
<p>Or a heck of a mental journey?</p>
<p>Wherever that leads, it could lead anywhere.</p>
<p>It probably would lead to a very bad place, right?</p>
<p>Very often does, and you combine that</p>
<p>with the fact that Scientology is against</p>
<p>any forms of mental health or health outside of Scientology,</p>
<p>and you have a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Now, you might go, where did all these spirits come from</p>
<p>that are stuck to your body?</p>
<p>This is where Zinu comes into play.</p>
<p>So Hubbard says that 75 million years ago,</p>
<p>Zinu was basically a dictator at,</p>
<p>the Galactic Confederation is like 70-something</p>
<p>or 80-something planets somewhere in the Milky Way,</p>
<p>and Zinu was like a dictator, an overlord</p>
<p>for either one of these planets or the whole system,</p>
<p>and they had a population problem.</p>
<p>And Zinu was like, we need to get rid of half the people.</p>
<p>So we called them all in for tax audits.</p>
<p>L. Ron Hubbard didn&rsquo;t like the IRS,</p>
<p>so of course the story has to do with tax audits.</p>
<p>Called them all in for tax audits,</p>
<p>said, psych bitches, froze them in glycol,</p>
<p>loaded them up on space planes, flew them to Earth.</p>
<p>Remember, the story has to be Earth</p>
<p>because the story is What&rsquo;s Wrong With Us?</p>
<p>Flew them to Earth, dropped them in volcanoes,</p>
<p>blew them up with hydrogen bombs,</p>
<p>and then captured them with spirit magnets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making up words, because, okay.</p>
<p>And these disembodied spirits of these people</p>
<p>that got blown up have just been blowing in the wind</p>
<p>here on Earth, and they attach themselves to things,</p>
<p>and they can be in the environment,</p>
<p>and they stick to bodies and everything,</p>
<p>and they all have reactive minds.</p>
<p>So at Scientology&rsquo;s upper levels,</p>
<p>if you get sick or you have cancer</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something wrong with you,</p>
<p>Scientology will say, that&rsquo;s one of your body things.</p>
<p>You need to get some auditing to fix the body things.</p>
<p>So this story, you do it with a bit of a chuckle,</p>
<p>but when done seriously,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just told in a serious way,</p>
<p>or written down, and you read it.</p>
<p>By most accounts, Scientologists struggle</p>
<p>when they read this for the first time,</p>
<p>because this is not consistent with what Scientologists</p>
<p>are hoping for is on the OT levels.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hoping for some real life-changing magic.</p>
<p>The way these things are described and sold,</p>
<p>remember, they&rsquo;re hoping that these OT levels</p>
<p>are gonna give them the ability</p>
<p>to go completely independent of their body at will,</p>
<p>exteriorize from your body, go back into your body,</p>
<p>like have some real spirit powers.</p>
<p>So at first, it&rsquo;s kind of a shock.</p>
<p>But then you still probably believe, you hope,</p>
<p>and you might turn it on yourself,</p>
<p>self-critical that this is, I&rsquo;m just not strong enough yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, because also part of Scientology,</p>
<p>remember, it works 100% of the time</p>
<p>when used 100% correctly, and if it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it could be because something&rsquo;s not being done right,</p>
<p>but it also could be because you&rsquo;re doing bad things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not telling people about.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re committing present time</p>
<p>overts, crimes, sins, Scientologists would be like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the reason auditing isn&rsquo;t working on you</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;re committing criminal behavior</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not being honest about.</p>
<p>So every Scientologist is sort of incentivized</p>
<p>to make auditing work on them, okay?</p>
<p>Now, Lex, this is where it gets a little crazy.</p>
<p>On OT-3, you learn about the OT,</p>
<p>the body things for the first time.</p>
<p>When you finish OT-3, you attest to having achieved</p>
<p>the state of having no more body things,</p>
<p>and then you start OT-4, and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>psych, you got more, you got more BTs,</p>
<p>except those other BTs, they had drug problems,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you couldn&rsquo;t find them the first time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna do something a little different here,</p>
<p>do something a little different there,</p>
<p>gotta get rid of these BTs that were addicted to drugs, okay?</p>
<p>Then you finish OT-4, and you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>man, I hope we get to the good stuff soon,</p>
<p>and then you get to OT-5, and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>psych, you got more BTs, you couldn&rsquo;t find these BTs</p>
<p>because they were all bunched up together in clusters,</p>
<p>and first you have to break up the clusters,</p>
<p>and then you can get rid of the BTs,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, okay, gotta do that.</p>
<p>And this was all L. Ron Hubbard approved.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is from L. Ron Hubbard.</p>
<p>And then, after you finish OT-5,</p>
<p>you get rid of all the BT clusters.</p>
<p>OT-6 is just a training course to teach how to audit OT-7.</p>
<p>Well, OT-7 is now more BTs,</p>
<p>except it&rsquo;s in the environment and stuff,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to locate BTs,</p>
<p>you can find them on your body, but it&rsquo;s just more BTs.</p>
<p>Okay, and then OT-8 is, remember we talked about</p>
<p>in all these auditing sessions</p>
<p>throughout the entire Scientology bridge,</p>
<p>you have people who&rsquo;ve run hundreds or thousands</p>
<p>of past life whole track incidents.</p>
<p>These memories have become part of their self-identity</p>
<p>of who they even think they are.</p>
<p>OT-8, you go through all these past life recalls,</p>
<p>and essentially, I&rsquo;m oversimplifying this a little bit,</p>
<p>he goes, psych, all those past life memories weren&rsquo;t yours.</p>
<p>They were your BTs.</p>
<p>And he goes, now that you&rsquo;ve discovered this,</p>
<p>now you know who you are not,</p>
<p>and you are ready to find out who you really are.</p>
<p>Well, now you&rsquo;re supposed to find out</p>
<p>who you really are on OT-9 and 10.</p>
<p>Those don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Do we know they don&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>Yes, in fact, the whole story of how that became known</p>
<p>is part of how David Miscavige was able</p>
<p>to get rid of Pat Broker and take over power,</p>
<p>because it was believed that Pat Broker</p>
<p>was in possession of the upper unreleased OT levels,</p>
<p>and when Miscavige determined that he was not,</p>
<p>and there weren&rsquo;t, in fact, any levels,</p>
<p>that was a bad day to be David Miscavige,</p>
<p>because he now knew he had something on his hands</p>
<p>he could not get himself out of.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no gap for faith to seep in,</p>
<p>that there is a level nine and 10, 11, and 12.</p>
<p>Oh, the faith is there.</p>
<p>Scientologists believe that these things do exist.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>L. Ron Hubbard didn&rsquo;t leave anything behind.</p>
<p>Does David Miscavige believe they exist?</p>
<p>Oh, no, he knows they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>No, but.</p>
<p>When I say exist, oh, I don&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>do advanced levels of spiritual awareness exist.</p>
<p>What I said is, I mean, did L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>write down what anyone is supposed to do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called OT nine?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying David Miscavige believes</p>
<p>that they can be written down,</p>
<p>so they exist sort of in a platonic sense,</p>
<p>and L. Ron Hubbard is the only one that can write it down?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So his faith is really deep.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean his faith that only L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>could have ever been the one to do it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The full principles, beliefs of Scientology,</p>
<p>he is, do you have, are you sure he believes?</p>
<p>That what exactly?</p>
<p>Everything about Scientology that is true.</p>
<p>To the best of my ability to know</p>
<p>that I believe it to be true.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll give you some all even stupid examples.</p>
<p>Like Mike Renders told a story</p>
<p>where at the International Base,</p>
<p>Miscavige actually had like a copper contraption</p>
<p>built into the ground, like grounded into the ground</p>
<p>to come out where you could hold it,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s something he sort of came up with to,</p>
<p>your BT, it could ground your BTs,</p>
<p>could get your BTs that if you were feeling</p>
<p>overstimulated or something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably slightly bastardizing this story,</p>
<p>but he came up with this as a great idea,</p>
<p>something to help someone de-stimulate</p>
<p>if their BTs were getting a little too overactive.</p>
<p>Now, so that&rsquo;s a stupid story that&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>well, it shows you he believes in the concept of BTs</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s creating little rods to get rid of them,</p>
<p>to ground them into the earth.</p>
<p>Well, he could be conjuring up the stories</p>
<p>because he understands the power of myth and narrative</p>
<p>and so on to inspire.</p>
<p>Sure, but like, but also if we look at history,</p>
<p>both with, this is an interesting thing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about Hitler and Stalin,</p>
<p>and it seems like both of them in different ways</p>
<p>believed in the stories they were telling.</p>
<p>Even when the stories, this is the fascinating,</p>
<p>especially with Hitler and propaganda,</p>
<p>where they were literally conjured up at first,</p>
<p>but then you start to believe you&rsquo;re in propaganda.</p>
<p>With Stalin, I think what he always believed</p>
<p>is the bigger ideal of pure communism</p>
<p>and anything justifies the journey to communism</p>
<p>because it will ultimately be good for humanity</p>
<p>to achieve the state of pure communism.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s a godlike figure</p>
<p>that can bring humanity there.</p>
<p>But like, with Hitler, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s constant propaganda</p>
<p>that he knows is not true.</p>
<p>A little bit, there&rsquo;s gotta be doubt,</p>
<p>but then he like, all doubt is removed very quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I guess humans are just, this is how they operate.</p>
<p>Yeah, the conversation about David Miscavige</p>
<p>gets really interesting because I could give you a,</p>
<p>if I wanted to make the argument that he didn&rsquo;t believe,</p>
<p>I could give you a dozen examples to make that argument.</p>
<p>I just happen to think that he believes in a different way,</p>
<p>whereas your average Scientologist</p>
<p>believes that Alvaron Hubbard was practically infallible,</p>
<p>that he thought of everything in advance,</p>
<p>he took care of everything before he left,</p>
<p>and Miscavige still believes</p>
<p>in like the main structure of this thing,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s like, oh shit, it&rsquo;s falling to me</p>
<p>to figure out how to actually make this thing happen.</p>
<p>I think Miscavige sees himself as someone</p>
<p>who has to a certain degree had to go back</p>
<p>and fix Alvaron Hubbard&rsquo;s mistakes.</p>
<p>Do you think he sees himself as doing good for the world?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>What about for the people of Scientology?</p>
<p>I think in his own way, he does.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he wakes up thinking</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s screwing Scientologists.</p>
<p>I think he sees everyone else as screwing him.</p>
<p>I think he sees that it is his job to expand Scientology</p>
<p>throughout the world and accomplish the aims of Scientology,</p>
<p>and he sees that it&rsquo;s not happening,</p>
<p>and he thinks if everyone else would just stop,</p>
<p>if everyone else would get out of his way</p>
<p>and stop creating problems for him, it would happen.</p>
<p>I do think he sees himself as someone who is doing good.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fair to say.</p>
<p>I think the evidence shows that.</p>
<p>What about the effects of clearly power and influence</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s had and money?</p>
<p>Yeah, without question that has served</p>
<p>as a corrupting force.</p>
<p>It has.</p>
<p>Without question.</p>
<p>Have you seen sort of evidence of that,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s changed over time?</p>
<p>After the 1993 IRS exemption that Scientology won back,</p>
<p>and this information comes from Mike Rinder,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when David Miscavige,</p>
<p>as soon as the checks on his power were removed,</p>
<p>Miscavige&rsquo;s behavior changed markedly.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of Shelly Miscavige</p>
<p>and the mystery surrounding her?</p>
<p>I saw that there is quite a bit of mystery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Shelly Miscavige, for many years,</p>
<p>held the job of her post in the C organization</p>
<p>was David Miscavige&rsquo;s assistant.</p>
<p>That was her post.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to truly understand that and what that means</p>
<p>because the fact that she was Miscavige&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>is meaningless.</p>
<p>And this is something that&rsquo;s hard to,</p>
<p>for regular people in the regular world,</p>
<p>to truly grasp how meaningless it is in Scientology.</p>
<p>For C-Org members who are spouses, it means nothing.</p>
<p>Your role matters more within C-Org.</p>
<p>Your role&rsquo;s the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say if Shelly was married to Dave,</p>
<p>but she worked in a different organization.</p>
<p>She would never be seen with him ever, publicly ever.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t travel with him,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t go to events with him, nothing.</p>
<p>Sometime around 2006, 2007,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very oversimplifying this, okay?</p>
<p>Shelly basically pissed off Dave to the point</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m done with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take you off of your post, okay?</p>
<p>At that point, she was reassigned</p>
<p>to another confidential Scientology base</p>
<p>up in Twin Peaks, California.</p>
<p>Why am I, the reason I&rsquo;m providing this type of detail</p>
<p>is because we hear that Shelly&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you realize the same people</p>
<p>who report that Shelly&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>are also the same people</p>
<p>who will tell you exactly where she is, okay?</p>
<p>She works at this secretive CST,</p>
<p>Church of Spiritual Technology base</p>
<p>out in Twin Peaks, California.</p>
<p>I have personal confirmation that she was seen</p>
<p>and spoken with by someone who knew her well</p>
<p>in, I&rsquo;ll say, 2019.</p>
<p>Shelly Miscavige is missing in the sense</p>
<p>that she hasn&rsquo;t been seen with David Miscavige</p>
<p>since about 2006,</p>
<p>but because she&rsquo;s no longer his assistant,</p>
<p>you would never see her with him.</p>
<p>As opposed to the mystery of a person</p>
<p>that might be murdered,</p>
<p>this is more of a reallocation within the organization.</p>
<p>Certain people who cover Scientology,</p>
<p>who have published stories</p>
<p>where Shelly Miscavige&rsquo;s family member</p>
<p>told a story to another family member,</p>
<p>who told the story to a friend,</p>
<p>who told the story to a former Scientologist,</p>
<p>who told the story to a journalist,</p>
<p>who published the story,</p>
<p>has created the impression</p>
<p>that some of Shelly Miscavige&rsquo;s family members</p>
<p>are actually talking to the press,</p>
<p>when in fact that has never occurred.</p>
<p>And so the very people who are publishing</p>
<p>about Shelly Miscavige missing</p>
<p>have contributed to the fact</p>
<p>that Shelly Miscavige does no longer speak</p>
<p>to those family members,</p>
<p>because she thinks they&rsquo;re talking to the press,</p>
<p>when they never have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty messed up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that she,</p>
<p>because those family members,</p>
<p>what would be a way for her to recover,</p>
<p>to flourish as a human being, to escape?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I believe the information that I have,</p>
<p>that I verified,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one representing it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>without revealing my sources,</p>
<p>that Shelly was still actively in touch regularly</p>
<p>with family members outside of the C organization</p>
<p>since about, until about 2014.</p>
<p>So I mean regularly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no question about her safety</p>
<p>during that period.</p>
<p>And then someone else who knew Shelly very well,</p>
<p>did see her and actually have a conversation with her</p>
<p>in a public place in 2019 or 2020.</p>
<p>Now somebody could still come along and be like,</p>
<p>how do we know she&rsquo;s okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been three years.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>You can say that about anybody.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the nature of working</p>
<p>in the highest levels of Scientology management</p>
<p>at these super secretive bases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very weird and unique situation.</p>
<p>It has isolation baked in.</p>
<p>How is secrecy enforced?</p>
<p>Why is everybody holding on to their stories so intensely?</p>
<p>People that are within the organization,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s hard to leak information.</p>
<p>Oh, they wouldn&rsquo;t want to leak.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re true believers.</p>
<p>They see, like there&rsquo;s sort of a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>that runs right through all of Scientology,</p>
<p>which is that Scientology represents</p>
<p>like an existential threat to the powers</p>
<p>that really control this planet.</p>
<p>Do they have a face to the powers that really control?</p>
<p>Do they have names to it?</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s controlling?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Zeno&rsquo;s homies.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not what they say.</p>
<p>Zeno embodied in-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually sort of a multifaceted conspiracy</p>
<p>in that on the one hand, L. Ron Hubbard points his fingers</p>
<p>at like the international bankers,</p>
<p>which has shades of antisemitism to it.</p>
<p>And then the IRS is going to be quickly baked in or no?</p>
<p>The IRS, no, the IRS is so low on the totem pole</p>
<p>as far as the, I mean, the international bankers,</p>
<p>he would say runs everything.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But use that these bankers also use big pharma</p>
<p>and big psych to control the population.</p>
<p>And Scientology&rsquo;s famously against pharma and psych.</p>
<p>And so this is sort of how L. Ron Hubbard characterizes</p>
<p>like this big war between Scientology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to set everyone free</p>
<p>and big pharma and big psych</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to enslave everyone on the planet.</p>
<p>Yeah, controlling their mind,</p>
<p>controlling their body through chemicals and-</p>
<p>And who controls the press, big pharma and big psych.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of correlation</p>
<p>to other kinds of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But you asked the question,</p>
<p>where, why would all these people hold onto their stories?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, they would never want to leak.</p>
<p>Like by even anyone who would want to leak</p>
<p>would not even want to be a Scientologist anymore.</p>
<p>Like if you truly believe,</p>
<p>if you truly believe in Scientology</p>
<p>and you got your shoulder to the wheel</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a Sea Org member,</p>
<p>you think Scientology is literally the only thing</p>
<p>that can save every being on this planet</p>
<p>from a fate of eternal amnesia and slavery, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, I mean, you&rsquo;ve seen The Matrix, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got everyone,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re unplugged from The Matrix</p>
<p>and you realize, yeah, you can get plugged back in</p>
<p>and live your nice life, but you&rsquo;re a slave.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Scientologists see this planet.</p>
<p>They actually, they refer to Earth as a prison planet.</p>
<p>Just at an individual level,</p>
<p>how is it possible to reach a person like that?</p>
<p>Is there something you could say to that?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the journey of reaching a person like that?</p>
<p>I personally, because when I was in those shoes,</p>
<p>I say there&rsquo;s nothing anybody could have said to me</p>
<p>to get me to change how I felt and thought about Scientology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost foolproof that the more evidence</p>
<p>you try to present that there&rsquo;s something wrong</p>
<p>with what Scientology is doing,</p>
<p>the more you&rsquo;re just working for the psychs, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, most people who leave Scientology</p>
<p>leave because they have had some personal experience</p>
<p>that was just such a grave injustice</p>
<p>that it just pushed them beyond the point</p>
<p>of what they were willing to experience.</p>
<p>Very rare, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve really ever heard a story</p>
<p>of someone going, yeah, I just woke up,</p>
<p>I just gradually realized it was all BS and drifted away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually like, no, I really believed</p>
<p>and they treated me so horribly,</p>
<p>I almost had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>And then the stories get pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Meaning you don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s true anymore,</p>
<p>you just have to leave with the unpleasant feeling,</p>
<p>the suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this sort of goes back to the conversation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having about, well, does Miscavige really believe?</p>
<p>And I said I could make an argument</p>
<p>for the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Because I go, it wouldn&rsquo;t be that hard</p>
<p>to change the way Scientology treats people</p>
<p>just a little bit and you&rsquo;d probably stop losing anyone</p>
<p>because Scientologists already believe</p>
<p>to such a strong degree, you have to be</p>
<p>pretty frickin&rsquo; horrible to people to make them leave.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you go, well, does Miscavige</p>
<p>even want Scientology to expand?</p>
<p>Because if he was really being clever about it,</p>
<p>it seems like he could at least stop the bleeding</p>
<p>and yet he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you make the argument,</p>
<p>well, if he doesn&rsquo;t, then he must not want to.</p>
<p>So his mind is corrupted to the point</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s not able to actually</p>
<p>be a good businessman, essentially.</p>
<p>It seems that way.</p>
<p>The numbers of Scientologists have been going down</p>
<p>and down and down since the early 90s.</p>
<p>Is there a good, I mean, it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to get to this number, but is there a good estimate</p>
<p>of what the current number of Scientologists,</p>
<p>of practicing Scientologists is?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I did a video about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite easy to get to the number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not more than 35,000 in the entire world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s being very generous and charitable.</p>
<p>I was intentionally generous.</p>
<p>I broke it all down in a spreadsheet and everything.</p>
<p>Can you give some insights of how you get that information?</p>
<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s about 175 to 200 Scientology organizations</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s ever worked at these organizations know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not more than 35 to 50 staff members per org.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not more than one to 200</p>
<p>public Scientologists per org.</p>
<p>I broke down the number of C-Org members</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d be working at every continental management unit,</p>
<p>middle management, international management.</p>
<p>I broke down the mission network, and I was generous.</p>
<p>I mean, my numbers were like, if L. Ron Hubbard came back</p>
<p>and they were doing an event, L. Ron Hubbard was coming back</p>
<p>and announcing OT nine and 10?</p>
<p>How many Scientologists could we scrape together</p>
<p>in every city to come to this event?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t more than 35,000.</p>
<p>Now, contrast that to what Scientology says.</p>
<p>Millions, 10 million people.</p>
<p>Is this less people than there used to be?</p>
<p>At its peak, it was about 100,000 active members.</p>
<p>But never the millions.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Has David Miscavige used violence?</p>
<p>Has there, in your understanding of it, in your estimation,</p>
<p>sort of harassment, assault, and actual,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to define assault, but violence?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Dozens of former C-Org members</p>
<p>from the international base have told stories</p>
<p>of being assaulted by Miscavige.</p>
<p>In fact, Mike Rinder is probably the one person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been assaulted by Miscavige more than anyone else.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s personally probably been assaulted dozens of times.</p>
<p>Who is Mike Rinder, the man here?</p>
<p>One of the highest ranking executives in Scientology.</p>
<p>The author.</p>
<p>There you go, a billion years.</p>
<p>Of a billion years.</p>
<p>It really is a fantastic book.</p>
<p>Because Lex, the guy was born and raised in Scientology</p>
<p>and worked personally with L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>and worked personally with David Miscavige for decades.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get much more insider than that.</p>
<p>A candid and deeply felt memoir of a life lost</p>
<p>to false belief and courageously regained.</p>
<p>Lawrence Wright.</p>
<p>A billion years, my escape from a life</p>
<p>in the highest ranks of Scientology, Mike Rinder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fantastic book.</p>
<p>He also narrates his own audio book, too.</p>
<p>I know you like the audio books.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I listen to them.</p>
<p>So Mike, famously, I just said a moment ago,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s treated so horribly,</p>
<p>even though he still believed in Scientology,</p>
<p>he had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>And he tells the story in that book.</p>
<p>And he still believed in Scientology for years</p>
<p>after he escaped.</p>
<p>For years.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s this thing called</p>
<p>the Independent Scientology Movement</p>
<p>or the Free Zone or whatever.</p>
<p>There are people who do Scientology</p>
<p>outside of the Church of Scientology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just not many of them.</p>
<p>But Mike was one of those people</p>
<p>who was actually doing Scientology even after he left.</p>
<p>Now he no longer believes in that anymore</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But even though he still believed,</p>
<p>even though everything he knew</p>
<p>was what he was leaving behind,</p>
<p>he still had to leave it behind.</p>
<p>And by the way, I just opened a random page</p>
<p>and he says,</p>
<p>when I signed on for Sea Org in Adelaide in 1973,</p>
<p>the recruiter promised I would train</p>
<p>as a Scientology executive</p>
<p>under the direct tutelage of Hubbard on the Apollo.</p>
<p>So this is another thing I should probably ask you about.</p>
<p>Oh, we could go for days.</p>
<p>I was also told that after I learned</p>
<p>all I needed to learn at the foot of the Master,</p>
<p>I would return to Australia</p>
<p>to help expand Scientology in my home country.</p>
<p>So what was the thing that really broke him?</p>
<p>The final thing is when he got to a point</p>
<p>where he was no longer being forced</p>
<p>to lie to protect L. Ron Hubbard.</p>
<p>He was now being forced to lie to protect David Miscavige.</p>
<p>And specifically, it was about the allegations</p>
<p>of having been assaulted by Miscavige.</p>
<p>Mike Rinder was at some event,</p>
<p>it might&rsquo;ve been a grand opening for a building,</p>
<p>a Scientology building in London.</p>
<p>And I believe it was John Sweeney,</p>
<p>at that time a BBC journalist,</p>
<p>who stuck a camera and a microphone in Mike&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Is it true David Miscavige assaulted?</p>
<p>Is it true?</p>
<p>And Mike denied it on camera.</p>
<p>And then turned around and to himself is like,</p>
<p>this is what my life has been reduced to?</p>
<p>Lying to protect David Miscavige?</p>
<p>This used to be about L. Ron Hubbard.</p>
<p>This used to be about Scientology.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s about protecting this douchebag?</p>
<p>And Miscavige had just issued orders</p>
<p>that was gonna send Mike off to Australia.</p>
<p>Like Miscavige is sadistic, that is without question.</p>
<p>Sadistic meaning?</p>
<p>He enjoys inflicting pain upon others.</p>
<p>So he very specifically was gonna tell Mike,</p>
<p>tell Rinder, or tell that cocksucker,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re shipping him off to Australia,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s never gonna see his wife</p>
<p>and his kids again, essentially.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when Mike was like,</p>
<p>they were the only reason I hadn&rsquo;t already left.</p>
<p>So if I follow the orders, I&rsquo;m gonna lose him.</p>
<p>If I leave Scientology, I&rsquo;m gonna lose him.</p>
<p>At least if I leave Scientology,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be free of something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking sad.</p>
<p>And he still believed Scientology</p>
<p>to some degree after he left, is what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Has he spoken about what it took to let go</p>
<p>of believing in Scientology?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He does a very good job talking about all of this</p>
<p>in the book.</p>
<p>And it took him like four or five years</p>
<p>to get that book done.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a polished version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a polished version of his story.</p>
<p>And I think Mike&rsquo;s about getting ready</p>
<p>to start his own YouTube channel,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;ll be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Actually, Mike comes on my channel all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys do a thing together, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, we do Three Amigos</p>
<p>with me and Mike Rinder and Mark Hedley.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I gave you Mark&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>I thought maybe you would know him</p>
<p>from our little Three Amigos,</p>
<p>our Mondays with Mike and Mark videos.</p>
<p>Mark Hedley, blown for good</p>
<p>behind the iron curtain of Scientology.</p>
<p>So he escaped from the International Base on a motorcycle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wild story.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t even try to do it justice, but-</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s a better writer of the two of them?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get me there, like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to be investigative journalist for once.</p>
<p>Mike and Mark are both on the board</p>
<p>of the Aftermath Foundation with me, so.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s better looking?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my justifications</p>
<p>for just putting up content every day</p>
<p>is every video is just an excuse to,</p>
<p>in some little way, promote the Aftermath Foundation.</p>
<p>And I do that again, one, to genuinely help people escape,</p>
<p>and two, because I know it drives David Miscavige crazy.</p>
<p>If you look in your own heart, is there anger there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate Scientology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate David Miscavige.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even hate my experience in Scientology.</p>
<p>Do you able to accept the good from your experience?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the only path that I traveled.</p>
<p>So I tend, okay, a little less so these days,</p>
<p>but earlier in life, I tended to attribute</p>
<p>all positive characteristics in me to Scientology,</p>
<p>because in my simplistic way of thinking,</p>
<p>I was like, what else could it possibly be attributed to?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very black and white way of seeing.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a beautiful way to see life.</p>
<p>No matter what happens to you, you attribute,</p>
<p>like you focus on the positive,</p>
<p>and sometimes people have traumatic experiences</p>
<p>with parents and so on, and if you focus on the positive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good way to let go of the trauma associated with it.</p>
<p>True, but another example would be,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to school.</p>
<p>I stopped going to school in the seventh grade,</p>
<p>but people go, but you sound so smart.</p>
<p>And what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Am I supposed to say, well, it&rsquo;s because of Scientology?</p>
<p>How do I answer that question?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the only path I traveled,</p>
<p>how do I answer that question?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to give Scientology credit,</p>
<p>but what the hell am I supposed to point to?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, you said you kind of enjoy,</p>
<p>I mean, part of it is you joking and trolling,</p>
<p>that you enjoy knowing that your YouTube channel</p>
<p>drives Dave Miscavige crazy.</p>
<p>That means you still, I mean, there is a joy you have.</p>
<p>There is a joy, I&rsquo;m not gonna deny that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of that,</p>
<p>because I suppose there&rsquo;s an intimacy</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re part of a tribe of that kind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, let me try to frame it.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t trying to get kicked out of Scientology.</p>
<p>I was trying to not get kicked out of Scientology.</p>
<p>So what happened, first my mom got kicked out</p>
<p>for basically talking some smack about David Miscavige.</p>
<p>And then they go to me and they go,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;ve gotta disconnect from your mom</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna get kicked out.</p>
<p>And I lied about that.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, I&rsquo;ll disconnect.</p>
<p>But I never did.</p>
<p>For a couple years, I lied my ass off about it.</p>
<p>Eventually they were like,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s gonna keep lying to us, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, all right, you&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>So then they go to my wife.</p>
<p>So you gotta divorce your husband</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna get kicked out.</p>
<p>And she goes, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hell of a statement from her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna get harder from here, so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ll try to get, I&rsquo;ll try to do my best.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t seem like a man who&rsquo;s afraid of hard things.</p>
<p>Okay, so she&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>So then they go to her parents.</p>
<p>And they say, you&rsquo;ve gotta disconnect from your daughter</p>
<p>and your three granddaughters</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna get kicked out.</p>
<p>But they have three other kids who are Scientologists</p>
<p>who have spouses who are Scientologists</p>
<p>who have grandkids.</p>
<p>So I feel like up until that point,</p>
<p>everybody was sort of making a decision for themselves</p>
<p>on what would be best for themselves</p>
<p>until they get to her parents.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like, which grandkids are we gonna lose?</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>At the part where they were trying to get me</p>
<p>to disconnect from my mom,</p>
<p>there were hours that I spent talking to them going,</p>
<p>you know, guys, there&rsquo;s another way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to go this way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another way that ends well for all of us.</p>
<p>And that wasn&rsquo;t even considered.</p>
<p>And I go, like, they created this monster.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I take joy in it.</p>
<p>When people ask me, is Scientology a destructive cult?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have to get into all the academic discussions</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s a religion and what&rsquo;s a cult</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>I go, as long as they destroy families like that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a cult.</p>
<p>So they cut people off deliberately, one by one.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And why is it that way?</p>
<p>I mean, it started with L. Ron Hubbard</p>
<p>laying out a policy framework, a policy structure</p>
<p>that if interpreted and applied in the worst possible way</p>
<p>with the worst possible judgment,</p>
<p>can be abused in that way.</p>
<p>I would make the argument that if an anti-broker</p>
<p>had taken over, that Scientology policy</p>
<p>does have enough little caveats baked into it</p>
<p>that even the policies about disconnection</p>
<p>could be interpreted and implemented</p>
<p>in a non-destructive way.</p>
<p>There is room for judgment and discretion.</p>
<p>And Miscavige has just created the worst possible version</p>
<p>of Scientology, and that&rsquo;s where you sort of get</p>
<p>that argument of, does he even want Scientology to succeed?</p>
<p>Because he seems to be hell-bent</p>
<p>on making sure that he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to see him make it succeed,</p>
<p>but it does bring that question up of like,</p>
<p>what are his motivations?</p>
<p>Can he not see that he&rsquo;s destroying the thing</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s supposed to be expanding?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also, you know, there&rsquo;s ways to measure cost.</p>
<p>And that would probably be the most costly aspect</p>
<p>of Scientology, is the suffering associated</p>
<p>with the separating of families.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that actually just puts, makes it very concrete</p>
<p>what we value in human life,</p>
<p>is the connection to our loved ones.</p>
<p>Like, everything else doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Like, getting 50 bucks a week,</p>
<p>like that, like getting money stolen from you,</p>
<p>getting the truth stolen from you,</p>
<p>none of that compares.</p>
<p>You can even frame that as the good.</p>
<p>There could be a lot of positives, whatever,</p>
<p>in the tribe, but separating families,</p>
<p>separating loved ones, that&rsquo;s the destructive thing.</p>
<p>So no hate, though?</p>
<p>No, I genuinely don&rsquo;t hate them.</p>
<p>Do you forgive them?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one I look at in Scientology that I go,</p>
<p>how dare you?</p>
<p>If I was in their shoes, having to, you know,</p>
<p>operate under David Miscavige&rsquo;s orders,</p>
<p>I would have done the same thing,</p>
<p>and I would have loved it.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I don&rsquo;t blame any of them.</p>
<p>I mean, I take the opposite approach.</p>
<p>If they knew what I knew, they&rsquo;d be doing what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>If they knew what I knew and believed it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be doing what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dumb people in Scientology.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re ambitious, they&rsquo;re dreamers, they got hope,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re driven, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the reasons I like</p>
<p>putting up content on my channel,</p>
<p>so they can see, hey, like if you&rsquo;re a Scientologist,</p>
<p>you look at it and you go, hey,</p>
<p>he seems like he&rsquo;s doing well, he&rsquo;s happy,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a positive guy, he&rsquo;s a good communicator,</p>
<p>he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not lying, he&rsquo;s not exaggerating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t exaggerate anything on my channel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t make up anything.</p>
<p>And this actually comes from an experience I had</p>
<p>from 1998 to 2000.</p>
<p>I was living in LA.</p>
<p>I sort of had a two-year period in my life</p>
<p>where I actually had almost no contact with Scientology.</p>
<p>And during that time, I found my way onto the internet.</p>
<p>And there was a website.</p>
<p>It might have been ESMB, X Scientology message,</p>
<p>but whatever it was, it was, at that time,</p>
<p>the main source of critical information</p>
<p>about Scientology on the internet.</p>
<p>And I looked at it.</p>
<p>And remember, I was still a true believer.</p>
<p>And I looked at this, and it was so offensive,</p>
<p>insulting, hyperbolic, exaggerated.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, just a bunch of bullshit.</p>
<p>I was in Scientology for 16 more years.</p>
<p>If what I had seen on the internet</p>
<p>about critical of Scientology,</p>
<p>if what I had seen when I had seen it</p>
<p>was something that actually resonated with me,</p>
<p>that I was like, oh, that I believed was true,</p>
<p>that seemed credible,</p>
<p>I would have gotten out of Scientology 16 years earlier.</p>
<p>So I was like, how can I help create an experience</p>
<p>on the internet that if a Scientologist stumbles upon it,</p>
<p>it will resonate with them instead of repelling them?</p>
<p>And that is exactly what I have set out to do</p>
<p>and what I believe I&rsquo;ve accomplished.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the content, the message,</p>
<p>but also just showing that you can be happy</p>
<p>outside of Scientology.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You can have a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>You can be a good man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All that.</p>
<p>What benefit do you think Tom Cruise gets from Scientology?</p>
<p>So why is he still in Scientology?</p>
<p>He genuinely loves it.</p>
<p>And also, Miscavige does,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one celebrity who does have</p>
<p>the most unique experience in Scientology,</p>
<p>and that is Tom.</p>
<p>Scientology hires all of Tom&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>All of Tom&rsquo;s staff are subject</p>
<p>to interrogations by Scientology,</p>
<p>not only in the hiring process,</p>
<p>but during the employment.</p>
<p>David Miscavige on Scientology runs Tom Cruise&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>and his production company and his household staff.</p>
<p>Do you imagine there&rsquo;s some personal connection there</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just, they like each other a lot?</p>
<p>Best friends.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s them against the world is how they see it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty easy to see how that works</p>
<p>between the two of them.</p>
<p>I think this idea of them against the world,</p>
<p>us against the world, is a really powerful, intimate,</p>
<p>I kind of see like friendships and relationships that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in a dark sense, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>the world is full of cruelty and absurdity</p>
<p>and unfairness and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to huddle together like the penguins</p>
<p>in March of the Penguins against the cold.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just like, and so,</p>
<p>especially with the ideology of Scientology,</p>
<p>this idea that you can be anything,</p>
<p>you can essentially, I mean, you can manifest it,</p>
<p>essentially, through like believing it.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t really put it into those words,</p>
<p>but believing that you&rsquo;re a god</p>
<p>is a really inspiring, positive thing to think.</p>
<p>If they could figure out how to do all that</p>
<p>without destroying families and bankrupting its members,</p>
<p>they might actually have a future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, like it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because sometimes I feel like it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m rooting for them to succeed and do it right,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not, but it&rsquo;s an interesting academic discussion</p>
<p>to have of like, we can all see how much people</p>
<p>will sacrifice in the names of belief and religion.</p>
<p>We can see how much Scientologists sacrifice</p>
<p>based on what they already believe.</p>
<p>If you would just start treating people less horribly,</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It might actually have a future.</p>
<p>Not that I want it to.</p>
<p>It seems like this dark lesson of human nature</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something about, to use the word cults,</p>
<p>that you just stop seeing reality for what it is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that could make this</p>
<p>a better organization that&rsquo;s actually helping people</p>
<p>flourish and be a little bit more like loose</p>
<p>about membership, not dividing families,</p>
<p>not causing suffering, not causing financial harm,</p>
<p>but actually inspiring people and helping people.</p>
<p>But then maybe it fundamentally changes</p>
<p>what the organization is, and maybe that means</p>
<p>somebody like David Miscavige loses power too,</p>
<p>which might be very difficult,</p>
<p>or people that are close to him lose power,</p>
<p>and people hold on to power, so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whatever the human force is here,</p>
<p>it seems to become worse and worse over time.</p>
<p>What about, oh, let me ask a conspiracy question.</p>
<p>Is there a chance that Tom Cruise is being blackmailed,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s information from auditing?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>So that kind of stuff is not, that&rsquo;s very conspiratorial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually come out and said definitively,</p>
<p>I do not know of a single person who stays in Scientology</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid of being blackmailed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a thing.</p>
<p>Does Scientology have enough information</p>
<p>to blackmail someone if they wanted to?</p>
<p>Well, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, and it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be true.</p>
<p>It could just be lies.</p>
<p>Who cares, who knows?</p>
<p>Scientology can say whatever the hell they want.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing, it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be true.</p>
<p>And actually, that would be the argument</p>
<p>against blackmailing.</p>
<p>Like, in order for Scientology to blackmail you</p>
<p>with that information, they&rsquo;d actually have to represent</p>
<p>that, yes, he really did tell us this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, then why are you spilling secrets</p>
<p>of members, right?</p>
<p>Like, it sets a bad precedent.</p>
<p>What are some of the sins according to Scientology?</p>
<p>Most of the sins from a Scientology perspective</p>
<p>are just doing or saying anything that brings disrepute</p>
<p>to Scientology itself, right?</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s not like Christianity where there&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>If you break this rule, you&rsquo;re not getting into heaven</p>
<p>because Scientology doesn&rsquo;t think about things that way.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s the drug.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do drugs, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do drugs.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t take any psychotropic medications.</p>
<p>And no medications almost at all?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to take medications.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no rules expressly prohibiting it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just most Scientologists tend not to.</p>
<p>You can take Advil, but many Scientologists won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t take anything prescribed by a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>a psychologist, or any drugs that are psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p>I mean, SSRIs are considered probably the closest thing</p>
<p>to pure evil in the world of Scientology.</p>
<p>What about, weird question, what about sex?</p>
<p>Is there boundaries on what&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>There used to not be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become very puritanical in the last many decades</p>
<p>for a reason I can&rsquo;t actually explain.</p>
<p>Like, miscavige does seem to be infatuated</p>
<p>with controlling sex.</p>
<p>Like, that is one thing about miscavige version</p>
<p>of Scientology that&rsquo;s gotten very strange.</p>
<p>I mean, L. Ron Hubbard even specifically wrote a policy</p>
<p>that says we are no longer going to regulate</p>
<p>in any way the bedroom activities of people.</p>
<p>He literally said, from this point on,</p>
<p>no one is allowed to be subject to any justice actions</p>
<p>of any kind whatsoever for anything they do</p>
<p>in their sexual lives.</p>
<p>But that still did not give permission for gay relationships.</p>
<p>That was still referring to straight stuff.</p>
<p>And monogamous only.</p>
<p>Can you do open marriages and open relationships?</p>
<p>According to L. Ron Hubbard policy, you can.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you know.</p>
<p>I think he wrote that policy</p>
<p>before he created the C organization.</p>
<p>And then what happened is,</p>
<p>this is actually how this came into effect.</p>
<p>He created the C organization,</p>
<p>you had a lot of people on a ship,</p>
<p>and everybody was just banging each other,</p>
<p>and it created just a nightmare of personal relationship.</p>
<p>It was making production impossible.</p>
<p>Not because everybody was spending so much time banging,</p>
<p>but because everybody was so upset</p>
<p>about who was banging who.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, sex and that kind of dynamic is really,</p>
<p>I mean, humans do what humans do,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s drama and all of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable, because everybody&rsquo;s so intimate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a closed tribe.</p>
<p>It makes sense to limit sex, otherwise everyone&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but otherwise it becomes a sex cult.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which a lot of them end up becoming.</p>
<p>On that topic, would you classify Scientology as a cult?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>But not because I&rsquo;m fully conversant</p>
<p>with the academic differentiations</p>
<p>between what&rsquo;s a religion and what&rsquo;s a cult.</p>
<p>I mean, Scientology would say,</p>
<p>well, all small new religions are cults,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>Some people would say, all religions are cults,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be like, depends on how you define religion,</p>
<p>and it depends on how you define cult.</p>
<p>But I just fall back on my thing of like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re destroying families and bankrupting your members,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a cult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I look at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s us versus them, and the them could be your family,</p>
<p>could be your loved ones, that&rsquo;s deeply destructive.</p>
<p>And one of the things you would probably throw</p>
<p>into the definition of a cult</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s actually destructive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I do a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s cult-like,</p>
<p>like jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of really close-knit tribes,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no negative toxicity to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no divide, there&rsquo;s no divisions.</p>
<p>Or if there is, it&rsquo;s more, boy.</p>
<p>Try being a fan of a certain soccer team</p>
<p>and then becoming a fan of another soccer team.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hardcore.</p>
<p>And like, whew.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you, I train jiu-jitsu as well,</p>
<p>and I have found that community of people</p>
<p>to be one of the most loving</p>
<p>and helpful group of people ever.</p>
<p>Shout out to John Keller at Gracie Baja Clearwater.</p>
<p>No, but seriously, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>I continue to do it, despite my back, my hip, my shoulder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just such a cool group of guys.</p>
<p>This goes on.</p>
<p>It used to not.</p>
<p>I think it was much more divisive in the beginning</p>
<p>from its Brazilian roots.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>is the team-oriented, like, if you&rsquo;re this team,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ride or die with this team.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s the Crianchas,</p>
<p>they go to another team.</p>
<p>And I think that aspect, that was actually a turnoff</p>
<p>for me in the beginning, that the toxicity of that.</p>
<p>Because I understand that a little bit for the elites,</p>
<p>for the highest of the highest.</p>
<p>That there is, I like the brotherhood</p>
<p>and the loyalty of the people,</p>
<p>like the Olympic gold medalists,</p>
<p>the best in the world, yes.</p>
<p>But for recreational fun, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>this is all ultimately about the camaraderie</p>
<p>of all human beings together,</p>
<p>not some, whatever label you put on yourself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we actually talked</p>
<p>about the organization itself.</p>
<p>We talked about tax-exempt status,</p>
<p>which is really important.</p>
<p>We talked about some of the control,</p>
<p>like through the propaganda control of what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually interesting that you said</p>
<p>that Scientology has pretty much lost the battle</p>
<p>with the internet at this point.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Which is kind of inspiring</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard to defeat the internet.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s bots that are,</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re sophisticated,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of remarkable they haven&rsquo;t been able</p>
<p>to capitalize on these bot armies.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s one thing that they have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of tax-free money</p>
<p>that they got nothing else better to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, they can invest.</p>
<p>They just, they should give you a call.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t have the right people, apparently.</p>
<p>But that said, how do they wield influence</p>
<p>with government agencies?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about the local police enforcement,</p>
<p>also federal agencies, anything.</p>
<p>That is the one way they effectively put their money to use,</p>
<p>is lobbyists and attorneys, judges.</p>
<p>Very rarely have they ever been able</p>
<p>just to get a politician on their side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the behind-the-scenes people.</p>
<p>Greta Van Susteren&rsquo;s a very high-level,</p>
<p>long-term Scientologist, and her husband,</p>
<p>I always get it wrong, it&rsquo;s either Jim Cole or John Cole,</p>
<p>I always get it wrong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very powerful attorney</p>
<p>who has a lot, wields a lot of influence behind the scenes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one example.</p>
<p>Like, the reason why that&rsquo;s an interesting example</p>
<p>is because he&rsquo;s actually a Scientologist,</p>
<p>and he travels in those circles.</p>
<p>Scientology, though, its money goes to good use</p>
<p>by hiring non-Scientologists,</p>
<p>retired judges, attorneys, lobbyists.</p>
<p>It really is how they get almost anything done.</p>
<p>Like, Miscavige himself is not hobnobbing and glad-hanging</p>
<p>and shaking hands and meeting these folks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the non-Scientologist professionals</p>
<p>who work behind the scenes on Scientology&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>Can you describe the dynamics</p>
<p>of how that actually happens?</p>
<p>Like, why would the police department</p>
<p>work on behalf of Scientology?</p>
<p>I meant more the courts and regulators,</p>
<p>not the police department.</p>
<p>But, well, for example,</p>
<p>it can come down to something as simple as this.</p>
<p>In Clearwater, Scientology hires Clearwater police</p>
<p>to do off-duty work for them.</p>
<p>They pay like three times their normal off-duty rate.</p>
<p>They will, even though I&rsquo;m not aware of anyone</p>
<p>on the Clearwater PD who&rsquo;s actually a Scientologist,</p>
<p>they basically end up with,</p>
<p>they would call them allies or safe points, right?</p>
<p>People who will literally operate as Scientology spies.</p>
<p>Someone comes in and follows a report</p>
<p>about some child sex case.</p>
<p>Someone in the Clearwater PD is calling Sarah Heller</p>
<p>at the Office of Special Affairs</p>
<p>at the Flank-Laddin base to let her know,</p>
<p>hey, heads up, we got a thing coming in.</p>
<p>And then Scientology can run around</p>
<p>and go talk to all the Scientologists</p>
<p>who have knowledge about this</p>
<p>and either get them out of Clearwater, you know.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like a direct, explicit corruption,</p>
<p>but more just friends and coworkers</p>
<p>integrated deeply in the community.</p>
<p>Yeah, I call it soft corruption.</p>
<p>So another example,</p>
<p>you have the mayor of Clearwater, Frank Hibbard.</p>
<p>Well, he used to, when he won his recent election,</p>
<p>he stepped down from some of these nonprofits</p>
<p>that he served on.</p>
<p>But the nonprofits that he served on</p>
<p>also gets millions of dollars of donations</p>
<p>from some of Scientology&rsquo;s richest Clearwater members, right?</p>
<p>You have one of the mayor&rsquo;s best friends, Joe Burdett,</p>
<p>literally a paid lobbyist for Scientology.</p>
<p>So that creates a chilling effect</p>
<p>on anyone who&rsquo;s gonna be talking smack about Scientology</p>
<p>because his friends are on their damn payroll.</p>
<p>So I call it soft corruption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not illegal, it&rsquo;s not illegal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s how Scientology wields influence.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s ironic is that a lot of these people</p>
<p>who work on Scientology&rsquo;s behalf</p>
<p>actually secretly hate Scientology.</p>
<p>They kind of see through it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s part of the community.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s deeply integrated in the community</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s financial leverage.</p>
<p>Are you ever afraid?</p>
<p>I mean, afraid for your wellbeing,</p>
<p>afraid for your ability to function in society</p>
<p>because of the pressures from Scientology?</p>
<p>Is that because you&rsquo;re genetically malfunctioning</p>
<p>or mentally or is there,</p>
<p>speaking out as a kind of protection?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>that once you&rsquo;ve seen behind the curtain</p>
<p>and you see the Wizard of Oz, it&rsquo;s just a silly man.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t have any fear.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s one of these things,</p>
<p>like people will say, oh, you&rsquo;re so brave.</p>
<p>And I go, eh, what&rsquo;s that quote?</p>
<p>Bravery is being a soldier</p>
<p>and being afraid and going in any way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not brave to run in if you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s gonna happen to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to,</p>
<p>like I do not hold myself up as an example of bravery</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like, oh, they could destroy me,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s not a damn thing they can do to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>I continue to put out content every day</p>
<p>to just basically go, hey, still here.</p>
<p>I dare you to try to do something about it,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t and hope that that also serves</p>
<p>as kind of an example for other people to go,</p>
<p>if this schmo can do it</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t do anything else to him,</p>
<p>then maybe I can do it too.</p>
<p>Because I would love it.</p>
<p>I would love there to be a 20 channels</p>
<p>where former Scientologists talk about their experience.</p>
<p>I mean, that is bravery because what happens</p>
<p>is fear seeps in even if it&rsquo;s not grounded in reality.</p>
<p>But at the same time, like my grandfather</p>
<p>who fought in World War II,</p>
<p>I mean, the story is, I mean,</p>
<p>he was very convinced and sure.</p>
<p>Most of the people he fought alongside with died.</p>
<p>He was a machine gunner,</p>
<p>but he believed that bullets can&rsquo;t hit him.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he said?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Well, you know, he was right, right?</p>
<p>Because he survived.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some sense like you&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Survivor bias.</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s like, just like you are.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m not brave.</p>
<p>I just, the bullets can&rsquo;t hit me.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a dark kind of truth to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, you know, it&rsquo;s like a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a feedback loop where if you have the confidence</p>
<p>and you push on forward and you&rsquo;re brave in that way</p>
<p>to not let fear seep in and affect you,</p>
<p>it actually gives you less things to be scared about.</p>
<p>I mean, but that initial few steps might be,</p>
<p>for people, it might be a very difficult step to take</p>
<p>to talk about it publicly.</p>
<p>The fear was knowing how the family</p>
<p>was gonna be destroyed and trying to prevent that.</p>
<p>I was terrified of that happening, but it happened.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing left to be afraid of.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the thing, like they created this beast.</p>
<p>And the same is true for Mark Headley.</p>
<p>The same is true for Mike Rinder.</p>
<p>I said, they&rsquo;ve essentially created</p>
<p>a Scientology proof virus, Scientology resistant strain.</p>
<p>By throwing everything they have at us for so many years,</p>
<p>they have just, through natural selection,</p>
<p>created people who just do not give a damn</p>
<p>about anything they could or would do.</p>
<p>And maybe there is something a little wrong with me.</p>
<p>Because when I get a phone call from someone,</p>
<p>like, I just got this phone call about you,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s Scientology PIs</p>
<p>doing work behind the scenes, I get really excited.</p>
<p>I get really excited.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get nervous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go, oh no, it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh yeah, this is gonna be exciting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>Because everything they try to do to me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna figure out how to reflect it back on them</p>
<p>and make them look ridiculous.</p>
<p>And that pales in comparison to the separating from family.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Is there parts of your family</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve lost because of Scientology?</p>
<p>Just, yeah.</p>
<p>If you&hellip;</p>
<p>Most of my episode on The Lee Remedy and the Aftermath show</p>
<p>was talking about me and my twin brother.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a pretty horrible story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a pretty horrible story.</p>
<p>So I do have a younger brother</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s still in Scientology and disconnected from me,</p>
<p>but I never had much of a relationship with that brother,</p>
<p>really, to begin with, right?</p>
<p>But my twin brother died when I was like 23 or 24.</p>
<p>And that was, without any question,</p>
<p>a direct result of our Scientology experience.</p>
<p>He died in a car accident</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t technically his fault or anything.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t even the one driving.</p>
<p>But the specific fact of his death was not,</p>
<p>meaning the fact and the manner of his death</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t specifically because of Scientology.</p>
<p>But our story and where our relationship got to,</p>
<p>and how he was even in a position</p>
<p>of having something like that happen to him</p>
<p>is directly attributable to Scientology.</p>
<p>Do you think about him?</p>
<p>Miss him?</p>
<p>As part of what you&rsquo;re doing in memory of him?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Man, this is such a&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, we were identical twins.</p>
<p>Can you imagine two of me?</p>
<p>I can barely handle one.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Losing him, would that be the darkest moment</p>
<p>in this whole journey of Scientology for you?</p>
<p>Two moments would equal the darkest moment.</p>
<p>It would be that,</p>
<p>and also just the period of six, nine, 12 months</p>
<p>of impending doom,</p>
<p>knowing that my wife&rsquo;s whole family</p>
<p>was gonna be obliterated,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s nothing we could do about it.</p>
<p>And kind of telling ourselves every step of the way</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t really gonna happen, you know?</p>
<p>And I really felt like,</p>
<p>you ever watch the Ozarks?</p>
<p>I felt like Marty Bird.</p>
<p>Now, this was happening before the Ozarks,</p>
<p>but when I watch the Ozarks,</p>
<p>and I see that character,</p>
<p>the entire world is crumbling down around him,</p>
<p>and all he can, all he did was like,</p>
<p>all right, what&rsquo;s the next step?</p>
<p>I watch Marty Bird, and I go,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my fucking spirit animal.</p>
<p>Because you can only control what you can control.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t keep Scientology from destroying your family.</p>
<p>And literally, it&rsquo;s funny, I mention this show a lot,</p>
<p>because I watch that, and I go,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly how I felt, you know?</p>
<p>I talk about this six months, or nine, or 12 months,</p>
<p>whatever it was, of impending doom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I was an emotional wreck during that time.</p>
<p>In private, I was, but it&rsquo;s not like I was just freaking out.</p>
<p>It was like, the sun&rsquo;s gonna come up tomorrow,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s gonna keep spinning, I can&rsquo;t control it,</p>
<p>this is horrible, I can&rsquo;t believe this is happening.</p>
<p>But tomorrow&rsquo;s a new day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, personally, even at the darkest times,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never experienced anything</p>
<p>that I would characterize as depression.</p>
<p>Certainly not ever any suicidal thoughts or anything.</p>
<p>Even in the darkest of times, and again,</p>
<p>this one thing I go, is it because of Scientology,</p>
<p>or is it just me?</p>
<p>There really is an emotional detachment.</p>
<p>There almost has to be.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a cold calculation, what are my options?</p>
<p>What do I do here?</p>
<p>And then once I figure out the answer to that question,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually quite chipper and happy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of my default.</p>
<p>You could give me six horrible options.</p>
<p>Once I figure out the best of those six,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna feel like I just had a pretty good day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Because just watching Ozarks is so stressful.</p>
<p>It is, right?</p>
<p>So stressful watching it.</p>
<p>And he usually finds a way,</p>
<p>and usually it is a set of really bad options,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of the bad options,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the best of the bad options.</p>
<p>And he almost gets pissed off at everyone around him</p>
<p>for being so pouty about it.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna watch that show again,</p>
<p>the same way again.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still simmering there right under the surface,</p>
<p>like pretty damn close to the surface.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And people sometimes ask about recovery and whatnot,</p>
<p>and what does that look like, and what does that mean?</p>
<p>And it sort of goes back</p>
<p>to kind of the emotional detachment,</p>
<p>is I go, what the fuck does recovery even mean?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an alcoholic and you&rsquo;re recovering,</p>
<p>you know what that means.</p>
<p>I used to drink, I don&rsquo;t drink now.</p>
<p>Well, I used to be in a cult, and I&rsquo;m not in a cult now.</p>
<p>How else am I supposed to feel about this</p>
<p>for someone to be like, it seems like you&rsquo;ve recovered.</p>
<p>What the fuck does that even mean?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m sure some academic has an answer to that question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not someone who particularly,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t spend any time thinking about that.</p>
<p>My recovery is success,</p>
<p>and a little bit of trolling and revenge,</p>
<p>but mostly success.</p>
<p>You know, what does it mean</p>
<p>to be a recovered former cult member?</p>
<p>What, you don&rsquo;t cry when people ask you about your brother?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it means.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it means.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it means.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it means.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had therapy,</p>
<p>but not because I&rsquo;m still against it from Scientology.</p>
<p>I just like, I&rsquo;m not gonna pay to talk to someone.</p>
<p>Do you know where else I could do that?</p>
<p>Scientology.</p>
<p>Now, I know there&rsquo;s a lot of people going like, oh boy.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a lot, I&rsquo;m not shitting on therapy.</p>
<p>I would rather have a beer with my friend</p>
<p>and talk about this shit</p>
<p>than talk to a professional for $200 an hour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of therapy, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, listen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part of the reason I do this podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s talking to people that you care about,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re close with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really powerful, powerful thing.</p>
<p>But yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what recovery looks like.</p>
<p>Success to you is defined, just be, find happiness.</p>
<p>Find happiness outside the closed bubble</p>
<p>that defines what happiness looks like on Scientology.</p>
<p>If I can make my kids happy, that&rsquo;s success to me.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to your kids</p>
<p>on how to live?</p>
<p>Travel the world.</p>
<p>A life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>Travel the world.</p>
<p>Travel the world.</p>
<p>Get rid of friends who don&rsquo;t push you up</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t celebrate your success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to give that advice to young children</p>
<p>because kids are always so catty.</p>
<p>But honestly, it&rsquo;s like, when I see,</p>
<p>that really is, I just think, not just advice to my kids,</p>
<p>but some of the best advice to anybody.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got anyone around you</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t celebrate your success,</p>
<p>just spend less time.</p>
<p>With those people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people</p>
<p>who actually wanna celebrate your success</p>
<p>and push you to succeed.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s even more important at a young age</p>
<p>because if at a young age,</p>
<p>you get used to being around people</p>
<p>who kind of take joy in tearing you down,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s what you become accustomed to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And I just think, you know,</p>
<p>having friends who love you and support you</p>
<p>is just about the closest thing to the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>And who believe in you, who believe in your potential.</p>
<p>And some of those ideas underlie</p>
<p>the good parts of Scientology.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And except there&rsquo;s a lot of dark parts of Scientology</p>
<p>that separate you from the people</p>
<p>that believe in you and that love you.</p>
<p>Well, this was a beautiful conversation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a beautiful human being who came full of gifts.</p>
<p>And I mean, I genuinely,</p>
<p>first of all, you&rsquo;re an inspiring human being,</p>
<p>but most importantly,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait until I can purchase a bobblehead on the store.</p>
<p>So I can keep that inspiration on my desktop.</p>
<p>Aaron, thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for being you, for being brave.</p>
<p>I know you said you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>but thank you for being brave, for talking about this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an inspiration and you help a lot of people.</p>
<p>Thank you, brother.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Aaron Smith Levin.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>
<p>Be not the slave of your own past.</p>
<p>Plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep and swim far.</p>
<p>So you will come back with new self-respect,</p>
<p>with new power and with an advanced experience</p>
<p>that will explain and overlook the old.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
