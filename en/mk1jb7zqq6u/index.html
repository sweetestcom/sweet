<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re here with</p>
<p>another q a and uh of course I have to</p>
<p>always give this disclaimer anything</p>
<p>that I say uh can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>construed as being medical care or a</p>
<p>replacement for your current therapies</p>
<p>so you have to check with the doctor</p>
<p>with any type of medical things because</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>according to the law they&rsquo;re The</p>
<p>Gatekeepers of your body so anyway</p>
<p>um that being said let&rsquo;s Jump Right In</p>
<p>absolutely good morning everyone and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a great lineup in The Green</p>
<p>Room uh and we&rsquo;re excited to talk to</p>
<p>them always terrific questions from Dr</p>
<p>Berg which the audience astutely answers</p>
<p>and then of course tons of questions</p>
<p>from social media and we do not</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know gauge anyone more important</p>
<p>than other we love everyone so we try to</p>
<p>kind of stagger it make sure everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting some attention so why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>start off with um social media this</p>
<p>morning Jane from YouTube could you</p>
<p>please discuss the cause and treatment</p>
<p>of PBC disease primary uh biliary</p>
<p>cirrhosis if I said that right</p>
<p>yeah and of course</p>
<p>this is just my opinion from a natural</p>
<p>nutritional standpoint what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with is the</p>
<p>you have the gallbladder and you have</p>
<p>this little tube that&rsquo;s connected from</p>
<p>the gallbladder back up to the liver and</p>
<p>then from the gallbladder comes right</p>
<p>down into the small intestine and</p>
<p>sometimes there&rsquo;s an infection and it</p>
<p>gets uh scar tissue and then you start</p>
<p>having problems with um the bile flowing</p>
<p>freely through this tube right and so it</p>
<p>can create a lot of problems and it can</p>
<p>back up</p>
<p>um into the liver and create</p>
<p>inflammation and a lot of abdominal pain</p>
<p>and digestive issues</p>
<p>um for that I would I would research and</p>
<p>look at tadka that&rsquo;s a the type of bile</p>
<p>salt that&rsquo;s very unique in that it</p>
<p>mimics bare bile so that way you can</p>
<p>keep the bears alive because they make</p>
<p>it synthetically which seems to still</p>
<p>work nicely so um Tut cut is a remedy</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>helps the flow of bile if there&rsquo;s sludge</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some obstruction through</p>
<p>those bile ducts so then you can have um</p>
<p>the benefit of bile and the benefit in</p>
<p>your digestive system so you just might</p>
<p>find that there&rsquo;s less pain there&rsquo;s less</p>
<p>backup into the liver there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>digestion of those fat soluble things as</p>
<p>well as the</p>
<p>the other function of being able to get</p>
<p>rid of the excess cholesterol that can</p>
<p>be in the liver so that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>purposes of bile but if you look at my</p>
<p>video online on Tucka there&rsquo;s some I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s quite it&rsquo;s magical what it can</p>
<p>do with so many different things so you</p>
<p>can check that out just type type Dr</p>
<p>Bergen Tucka on YouTube all right very</p>
<p>good let&rsquo;s see if we can help Mandy out</p>
<p>with some suggestions she&rsquo;s on YouTube</p>
<p>can you suggest any way to address</p>
<p>restless leg syndrome and a burning</p>
<p>sensation in the feet I do take d3k2</p>
<p>natural yeast uh and she probably meant</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and the problem is</p>
<p>with the right leg but both feet are</p>
<p>burning and it&rsquo;s hard to fall asleep I</p>
<p>bet it is</p>
<p>yeah you know that condition sounds to</p>
<p>me it&rsquo;s like something like peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy so hopefully you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>benphotamine okay that that&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathy and it usually</p>
<p>comes with alpha lipoic acid together</p>
<p>those are two um wonderful things for</p>
<p>the nerves</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know what your diet looks</p>
<p>like but I would I hope you get on keto</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting because</p>
<p>um that would ultimately correct it I</p>
<p>used to have that problem restless leg</p>
<p>syndrome I mean I would get up in the</p>
<p>middle of night and just my legs I just</p>
<p>wake me up little did I know I was</p>
<p>connected to eating all these carbs and</p>
<p>sugars and ice cream every single night</p>
<p>Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s a quart of ice cream</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>um for many years and I didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>twice of it until the restless legs</p>
<p>started kicking in</p>
<p>um this is really a problem in the uh</p>
<p>with this um</p>
<p>issue with the depletion of vitamin B1</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re taking so many carbs so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>glad you&rsquo;re taking B1 you just might</p>
<p>need to take a lot more of it and then</p>
<p>also change your diet okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like even more important</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>on a rare occasion it could be coming</p>
<p>from an imbalance with magnesium and</p>
<p>calcium</p>
<p>so but first try the the low hanging</p>
<p>fruit which is the changing of the diet</p>
<p>and then adding that benphotamine</p>
<p>all right very good wealth as they call</p>
<p>themselves on YouTube I&rsquo;m on healthy</p>
<p>keto and wonder if it&rsquo;s okay to eat</p>
<p>chicken an omelette salad vitamin E</p>
<p>complex and drink your electrolyte</p>
<p>formula all in one meal or is it too</p>
<p>much I guess omad is his thing</p>
<p>no I think it&rsquo;s totally fine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally fine</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t see any problem with that at</p>
<p>all very good keep it up I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get healthier every day Alina</p>
<p>from YouTube are there any natural</p>
<p>solutions to addressing depression uh</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on that that is a</p>
<p>terrible plague Among Us</p>
<p>you may want you might want to research</p>
<p>and try</p>
<p>um higher amounts of vitamin D3 like</p>
<p>like 30 or even 40 or even 50 000 I use</p>
<p>and just take it all at once and then</p>
<p>wait like three days</p>
<p>four days and then take it again and</p>
<p>that that can help you because think</p>
<p>about during the winter months people</p>
<p>tend to get the blues right why because</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get much sun and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>vitamin D aspect right and also bee out</p>
<p>in the sun as much as you can in nature</p>
<p>helps</p>
<p>um a lowered state of emotion as well</p>
<p>so we have that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then of course um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s from a nutritional angle vitamin</p>
<p>D I think um</p>
<p>the other thing too is I would uh watch</p>
<p>some of my videos on I actually list all</p>
<p>the different potential causes of</p>
<p>depression and one the most common was</p>
<p>vitamin D but you also have a lack of</p>
<p>sleep lack of energy I&rsquo;ve never found</p>
<p>anyone</p>
<p>that has depression and a ton of energy</p>
<p>okay like very energetic it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>they have fatigue so when you fix the uh</p>
<p>the physical part of the body many times</p>
<p>that can influence your mood</p>
<p>um another thing I would do is work on</p>
<p>the your uh probiotics like add more</p>
<p>probiotics uh change your diet get on</p>
<p>less carbs and then see if that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help your mood</p>
<p>all right very good well someone&rsquo;s in a</p>
<p>good mood in London her name is Margaret</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s one of our first contestants</p>
<p>if you will and Margaret if you will</p>
<p>unmute yourself I&rsquo;m going to do the same</p>
<p>thing and you are on with Doc</p>
<p>it was supposed to bring her on ta-da</p>
<p>drum roll there she is Margaret go ahead</p>
<p>we do one question please</p>
<p>go ahead Margaret yes good to see you Dr</p>
<p>Burge</p>
<p>nice seeing you</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>um I</p>
<p>I just want to thank you for all you do</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you sort of saved my life I was diabetic</p>
<p>metformin 18 months ago I came across</p>
<p>your site and then I started</p>
<p>kitu and then watching my diet so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been off both insulin and Metformin but</p>
<p>my sugar level are still a bit High I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get them down all the time they</p>
<p>are still in the double figures</p>
<p>sometimes they go down sometimes they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t and recently the doctor said my</p>
<p>LDL is 10.3 and they are concerned so I</p>
<p>just wanted to know</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve been telling us what we</p>
<p>can do what can I take to reduce both</p>
<p>the to help me with my double figures of</p>
<p>the sugar as well as my cholesterol</p>
<p>so this is just my opinion okay so I</p>
<p>just want to give you my two cents on</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re a diabetic</p>
<p>and even uh you have this uh</p>
<p>this insulin resistance that&rsquo;s behind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sitting in the background that um</p>
<p>and this is why metformin addresses the</p>
<p>insulin resistance in which actually uh</p>
<p>helps the the cells become more</p>
<p>sensitive to insulin so you can then</p>
<p>have the insulin work a little bit</p>
<p>better on lowering the blood sugars</p>
<p>right now the fact that your blood</p>
<p>sugars are not lowered it tells me that</p>
<p>either</p>
<p>those receptors still need some more</p>
<p>work okay</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>something else going on</p>
<p>um especially if you&rsquo;re not on a high</p>
<p>carb diet you went on low carb and your</p>
<p>sugars are high it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>does it well there&rsquo;s something else that</p>
<p>contributes to this that I want to share</p>
<p>and I did a video on it and and it has</p>
<p>to do with um your liver making</p>
<p>sugar okay your liver is making sugar</p>
<p>out of</p>
<p>other things not carbohydrates like</p>
<p>proteins and fats your liver can make</p>
<p>sugar and this is a this happens after</p>
<p>you you get someone on keto and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>diabetic they do much better but then</p>
<p>they might have either the dawn</p>
<p>phenomena they wake up the blood sugar</p>
<p>is higher or you just have a harder time</p>
<p>taking this residual sugar so this is a</p>
<p>liver issue and it&rsquo;s going to take some</p>
<p>time but there&rsquo;s things you can do to</p>
<p>speed it up all right</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t change what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>just be really strict with what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing</p>
<p>um but if you add</p>
<p>um berberine okay that will help if you</p>
<p>also add apple cider vinegar that will</p>
<p>help if you add cinnamon</p>
<p>that will help and there&rsquo;s many other</p>
<p>herbs like</p>
<p>ginseng and turmeric that you can add</p>
<p>that will support the liver I would do</p>
<p>that and then re keep reevaluating and</p>
<p>you should in theory see it starting to</p>
<p>come down normally as that insulin</p>
<p>resistant issue goes away and your liver</p>
<p>starts to heal I will mention that</p>
<p>even though the liver is the most the</p>
<p>toughest organ in the body</p>
<p>sometimes it does take up to three years</p>
<p>to fully heal a damaged liver so give it</p>
<p>more time and this is what we call you</p>
<p>patient in fact uh you have to have</p>
<p>patience Right In fact when you go to</p>
<p>the doctor&rsquo;s office you have waiting</p>
<p>rooms so you can have patience and wait</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just being very sorry</p>
<p>all right well thank you so much uh</p>
<p>Margaret</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great we&rsquo;d love to hear back from</p>
<p>you after a period of time and hope that</p>
<p>everything resolves wonderfully for you</p>
<p>it sounds like you&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s go back to social media uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Jess from YouTube will a</p>
<p>plant-based diet help reduce fibroids</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>against a plant-based diet I just think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s more difficult to do keto</p>
<p>because of how you&rsquo;re going to get your</p>
<p>protein and you have the B12 and you</p>
<p>have the the bioactive forms of zinc and</p>
<p>iron and uh the active form of vitamin A</p>
<p>you know retinol you have all the</p>
<p>precursors there but then where are you</p>
<p>going to get these active forms you can</p>
<p>do it but it&rsquo;s just more difficult so um</p>
<p>it really depends on what you eat what I</p>
<p>would do is I watch my videos</p>
<p>um on how to do a vegan style Keto</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you may have to add more nutrition into</p>
<p>this mix but that that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend all right very good and I</p>
<p>recommend it it&rsquo;s time for our first</p>
<p>quiz question there it is Dr Berg</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right dieting is one of the biggest</p>
<p>things that directly causes rebound</p>
<p>weight gain I guess this would be a true</p>
<p>or false right Steve oh uh you know I</p>
<p>guess it is and I&rsquo;m afraid that must be</p>
<p>my fault not doing this so that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>or false does that happen or not and let</p>
<p>me just if there&rsquo;s any confusion true or</p>
<p>false let me ask it again great true or</p>
<p>false dieting is one of the biggest</p>
<p>things that directly causes a rebound</p>
<p>weight gain</p>
<p>true or false folks all right let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to uh social media as we wait for</p>
<p>that uh improving one these names the</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s name is improving one from</p>
<p>YouTube what recommendations would you</p>
<p>make to someone with uh</p>
<p>Vitiligo I guess that&rsquo;s the skin</p>
<p>condition right that&rsquo;s a situation where</p>
<p>your your skin you you have this like</p>
<p>almost like a bleaching effect you have</p>
<p>these</p>
<p>um white spots through the body</p>
<p>um because of lack of melanin and so um</p>
<p>that usually is triggered by some type</p>
<p>of stress response cortisol is involved</p>
<p>because they sometimes they uh people</p>
<p>with a condition called Addison&rsquo;s has</p>
<p>Vitiligo it&rsquo;s usually a stress situation</p>
<p>so what I would do if I were you</p>
<p>um most of the research that I found on</p>
<p>this topic relates to research on</p>
<p>vitamin D higher levels in Vitiligo</p>
<p>which addresses</p>
<p>or at least addresses uh in a</p>
<p>significant way autoimmune problems</p>
<p>which that could also be connected so</p>
<p>look at Vitamin A&rsquo;s you may find a nice</p>
<p>solution with that so test the waters</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really sorry that your your</p>
<p>parents named you that name it must have</p>
<p>been terrible going through school</p>
<p>having you being called uh what was that</p>
<p>Steve let&rsquo;s see it was improving one and</p>
<p>what if he didn&rsquo;t improve yeah</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if your name last name is</p>
<p>one I I wouldn&rsquo;t have called your first</p>
<p>name improving I know and their second</p>
<p>child improving too is doing very well</p>
<p>so I can see and speaking of people uh</p>
<p>remember we just heard from London from</p>
<p>Margaret but there&rsquo;s also a lot of folks</p>
<p>listening today from the UK the rest of</p>
<p>the UK Canada Mexico India Jordan South</p>
<p>Africa Sweden Oman turkey Finland Poland</p>
<p>Eritrea Yugoslavia Zambia Uganda Iran</p>
<p>Kurdistan the Virgin Islands Argentina</p>
<p>Egypt Spain Kashmir Hong Kong Belgium</p>
<p>Australia Nigeria Israel Norway Bermuda</p>
<p>Iran Japan Pakistan Trinidad and Tobago</p>
<p>Iran Peru Albania Albania Switzerland</p>
<p>France Tanzania</p>
<p>Brunei hold on my little screen just</p>
<p>flipped up let me grab that thing there</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see uh Iran Japan Pakistan uh</p>
<p>Ireland Peru Albania Switzerland France</p>
<p>Tanzania Brunei now I&rsquo;m caught up</p>
<p>Croatia Russia Portugal moldovia</p>
<p>Scotland Denmark the Netherlands Nigeria</p>
<p>Chile Armenia Taiwan Bahrain Kurdistan</p>
<p>Thailand Jamaica Nepal United Arab</p>
<p>Emirates Bulgaria Bangladesh Germany and</p>
<p>all across these United States of</p>
<p>America so thanks everybody so much for</p>
<p>tuning in to the show and thanks</p>
<p>everybody so much for answering the</p>
<p>question now again as a point of</p>
<p>confusion this is not a question it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>true false true false dieting is one of</p>
<p>the biggest things that can directly</p>
<p>cause weight gain</p>
<p>and the audience uh said 98 of a</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s true and two</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true I mean when I when I did</p>
<p>surveys uh in my practice when I was</p>
<p>practicing I&rsquo;d ask people all the time</p>
<p>when did you notice you start having a</p>
<p>problem with your weight and and losing</p>
<p>the weight</p>
<p>and then you find out well they just</p>
<p>they tried many times it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>the more times they died the harder it</p>
<p>is to</p>
<p>lose the weight and that&rsquo;s mainly</p>
<p>because of the uh the body&rsquo;s adaptation</p>
<p>to that lower lower calories especially</p>
<p>I mean back I guess definitely back in</p>
<p>the 70s and 80s low calorie diets were</p>
<p>even more popular than they are now but</p>
<p>um you start lowering your calories</p>
<p>and you might actually start</p>
<p>gaining weight over or I mean after</p>
<p>after you get a little bit older so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in your 20s and all of</p>
<p>a sudden now now you try to diet when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 30s or 40s or 50s</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s going to be a challenge</p>
<p>interesting okay I&rsquo;m sorry doc stepped</p>
<p>all over I was going to say that</p>
<p>solution to that would be</p>
<p>to not necessarily go on a diet but just</p>
<p>a longer lifestyle change and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even honestly consider</p>
<p>healthy version of Keto as a diet or</p>
<p>intermittent fasting because that be</p>
<p>that could be something that is just a</p>
<p>natural healthy way of eating you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just not eating all these extra</p>
<p>refined carbs and you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>healthily I mean to me that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>normal that should be your normal diet</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s just my opinion</p>
<p>all right well it&rsquo;s valued around the</p>
<p>world Maria from Facebook I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>that a lot a lot of opinions speaking of</p>
<p>which that coffee is not good for you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your opinion on uh coffee not</p>
<p>being good for you I know oh well okay</p>
<p>not good for you well I think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>abusive coffee</p>
<p>um some people are sensitive genetically</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain Gene that helps you</p>
<p>get rid of caffeine in coffee and um</p>
<p>some people just can&rsquo;t get rid of</p>
<p>caffeine and so they drink coffee they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel good they don&rsquo;t sleep good</p>
<p>other people can drink more coffee</p>
<p>coffee does deplete vitamins like</p>
<p>vitamin B1 for sure but um personally um</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s very addicting and I</p>
<p>am I will say I&rsquo;m addicted to coffee but</p>
<p>I only do one so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one small little cup which is very tiny</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done videos on it so um</p>
<p>if if you&rsquo;d ask me</p>
<p>should I start drinking coffee is it</p>
<p>going to give me health benefits I&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>no don&rsquo;t start don&rsquo;t start I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>start I think it&rsquo;s better if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink coffee I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a major</p>
<p>contribute to problems with your bodies</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just something that</p>
<p>um 80 of the population drinks coffee</p>
<p>and I just wouldn&rsquo;t drink excessive</p>
<p>amounts</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s my my two cents on and if you</p>
<p>do drink I would drink um organic coffee</p>
<p>because of all the pesticides</p>
<p>interesting for what it&rsquo;s worth I cold</p>
<p>brew my coffee it&rsquo;s actually brewed in</p>
<p>the refrigerator heavy cream according</p>
<p>to Dr Berg&rsquo;s okay and I just love it and</p>
<p>I am a little addictive but I have</p>
<p>slowed down I only have two of those</p>
<p>jugs a day so I guess that&rsquo;s we could</p>
<p>call that Improvement all right now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh James from YouTube I just</p>
<p>got back from Italy which Dr Berg loves</p>
<p>after eating everything</p>
<p>um in sight what is your suggestion for</p>
<p>getting back onto omad and I guess maybe</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Keto well stay away from Italy stay away</p>
<p>from all that good food and then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be okay so that way you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>access to it because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dangerous no I&rsquo;m just kidding now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh you could actually do it you can do</p>
<p>the keto version</p>
<p>um but it&rsquo;s um you have to um there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain keto doctors now that are</p>
<p>are really um going after it in Italy</p>
<p>and helping people have alternative type</p>
<p>things to um the pasta and pizza and</p>
<p>things like that but the point is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a higher I will say there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>much higher quality of food in Italy and</p>
<p>France and other parts of Europe for</p>
<p>sure than America</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um and they more than Americans they</p>
<p>stick with the cultural Foods um well we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really have a culture food in</p>
<p>America but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but I think the way to get back on track</p>
<p>is to start with um</p>
<p>uh intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>rip the Band-Aid and Jump Right In don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it gradually and then within probably</p>
<p>a day or two you&rsquo;ll start doing better</p>
<p>um in fact I even did a video on it you</p>
<p>can watch it because I go through a lot</p>
<p>more information okay well in the South</p>
<p>we do have some traditional foods we</p>
<p>have possum pie and then you can get</p>
<p>some roadkill as a side put some sausage</p>
<p>gravy on top of it and there you go</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true that&rsquo;s true yeah good point</p>
<p>there Steve I have developed some habits</p>
<p>over here okay now the second question</p>
<p>of the day has been properly formatted</p>
<p>and there it is</p>
<p>okay true or false there&rsquo;s no such thing</p>
<p>as a slow metabolism it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>highly efficient metabolism All Right</p>
<p>audience climb onto that</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see uh hafizer from Facebook</p>
<p>is there a natural way to fix a hiatal</p>
<p>hernia also what&rsquo;s behind the best way</p>
<p>excuse me what&rsquo;s the best way to address</p>
<p>bad breath</p>
<p>boy you get slipped into two questions</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>um well I think the hiatal hernia</p>
<p>originally came from a weakness within</p>
<p>um some of the supporting connective</p>
<p>tissue around</p>
<p>in your abdomen and so in that case uh</p>
<p>you know I there&rsquo;s a couple things right</p>
<p>a couple things that I I would look at I</p>
<p>would check your vitamin C because</p>
<p>vitamin C deficiency can affect collagen</p>
<p>support and strength the collagen itself</p>
<p>um and the fascia and then also check</p>
<p>the um the acid in the stomach because</p>
<p>many people have hiatal hernia have a</p>
<p>low stomach acid and</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t break down the amino acids so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get the benefit of the</p>
<p>complete amino acids into the tissues so</p>
<p>taking butane hydrochloride maybe five</p>
<p>or six before you eat might just help</p>
<p>you with that in the meantime there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some great stretch type acupressure type</p>
<p>treatments you can do for hiatal hernia</p>
<p>and I did videos on that</p>
<p>um but you have to type in Dr Berg</p>
<p>hiatal hernia for many of the topics</p>
<p>that you want to research because</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re ranking now more medical</p>
<p>sites uh than alternative sites</p>
<p>um the other other point I was going to</p>
<p>bring up you said bad breath</p>
<p>um that could come from</p>
<p>usually an overgrowth of the wrong</p>
<p>bacteria in your mouth because maybe you</p>
<p>took an antibiotic</p>
<p>um or maybe you&rsquo;re eating foods that are</p>
<p>are disrupting your Flora</p>
<p>um wheatgrass juice powder can provide</p>
<p>some really good chlorophyll to help</p>
<p>cleanse</p>
<p>um your body and that seems to help for</p>
<p>any type of like bad odorous type stuff</p>
<p>in your gut that can come up or in your</p>
<p>mouth</p>
<p>chlorophyll from the wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder and then start taking things like</p>
<p>sauerkraut probiotics</p>
<p>um kimchi and even a probiotic to start</p>
<p>to change the um the ratio of good</p>
<p>bacteria to bad bacteria because usually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a imbalance that&rsquo;s creating this</p>
<p>bad breath all right very good and by</p>
<p>the way for those of you in the</p>
<p>conundrum are trying to search for Dr</p>
<p>Berg&rsquo;s video I would we would urge you</p>
<p>to download his free app on Android or</p>
<p>on Apple products and that way you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to do some very efficient research</p>
<p>because they are properly labeled and so</p>
<p>on there&rsquo;s a lot of other good resources</p>
<p>on that app as well okay let&rsquo;s see why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go back to the green room again</p>
<p>and this time why don&rsquo;t we bring in</p>
<p>Anita she&rsquo;s been smiling through the</p>
<p>whole time very excited I think to be on</p>
<p>very cheerful person let&rsquo;s see if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true she&rsquo;s put under the pressure of</p>
<p>being on the air Anita unmute yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hello Dr Berg my family and I are a</p>
<p>great fans awesome</p>
<p>so I have a question it&rsquo;s in regards to</p>
<p>my daughter so my daughter&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>suffering from severe headaches for a</p>
<p>few months now and now and now she&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>pain in the face</p>
<p>um starting on the forehead sinus area</p>
<p>and Jaws</p>
<p>um she had an MRI done a few months ago</p>
<p>and the diagnosis was something on the</p>
<p>pituitary gland on or in the pituitary</p>
<p>gland either a pituitary adenoma or a</p>
<p>rat key syndrome so after we found out</p>
<p>we were doing the intermittent fasting</p>
<p>so my question is would the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting or getting your body to a state</p>
<p>of autophagy has a positive effect on</p>
<p>this and are there any supplements and</p>
<p>natural products that she can use</p>
<p>because the alternative is surgery and I</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t want her to go that route</p>
<p>so this is a perfect example of what</p>
<p>people are searching for</p>
<p>on YouTube and internet and</p>
<p>unfortunately that to try to find that</p>
<p>information it&rsquo;s more and more difficult</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>it just conflicts with the mainstream</p>
<p>medicine but how old is your child my</p>
<p>daughter is 28. 28. yeah okay I was</p>
<p>thinking maybe like three or four years</p>
<p>old so all right we&rsquo;re dealing with 28</p>
<p>years old okay so</p>
<p>um the first thing I would do is get</p>
<p>back to the basic eating and on all</p>
<p>these conditions and make sure she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing not just an intermittent fasting</p>
<p>but keto and just see what happens with</p>
<p>that I would highly recommend</p>
<p>um you also watch all my videos on</p>
<p>headaches even no there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tumor on the pituitary even know that</p>
<p>you know many many times that can be</p>
<p>asymptomatic and not even causing that</p>
<p>headache right it could be some of the</p>
<p>other factors I&rsquo;ll give you just some</p>
<p>random ideas on that um a lot of</p>
<p>headaches come from</p>
<p>digestive problems they come from um</p>
<p>fluorescent lights</p>
<p>um a lack of sodium uh something going</p>
<p>on with your liver I mean there&rsquo;s this a</p>
<p>whole long list but I would</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now that you narrowed it down</p>
<p>um if you if you put her on a product</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called pituitrophin PMG from</p>
<p>Standard Process pituitrophin PMG and</p>
<p>she just took like one before bed</p>
<p>uh that may uh support this issue and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making any claims or guarantees</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just something that supports</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something very specific and Taylor</p>
<p>Made to the pituitary gland</p>
<p>um so anytime there&rsquo;s a problem with</p>
<p>that gland this kind of just gives the</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>um what it needs to help support it much</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the the other thing is that when you</p>
<p>evaluate something like this you know</p>
<p>you really need a lot more information</p>
<p>and digging in and testing and things</p>
<p>like that I don&rsquo;t have that information</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like things that I would want to</p>
<p>know is um what potentially could have</p>
<p>created that tumor in the first place</p>
<p>was there</p>
<p>severe stress was there a chemical</p>
<p>exposure was there something that might</p>
<p>have triggered that and then because</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t that that doesn&rsquo;t just come</p>
<p>out of the blue there&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>causes it so I would look into the</p>
<p>history and then once you have that data</p>
<p>then you could have Clues on what you</p>
<p>can do to bring things Back in Balance</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um but that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>right just from what I have as far as</p>
<p>what you told me</p>
<p>about them how do you how do you spell</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>I knew you&rsquo;re gonna ask me that um p-i-t</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s t r</p>
<p>but two etrophin the two trophin I am</p>
<p>terrible at spelling but let me just let</p>
<p>me just see here okay okay I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>p-i-t-u-i-t-a-r-y or in the trophin</p>
<p>t-r-o-f-y and then p m g</p>
<p>um and that&rsquo;s by standard process</p>
<p>that was my pack job at spelling that</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um you should be able to find online</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a prescription and uh you just</p>
<p>want to take one before bed</p>
<p>um and um I use that I&rsquo;ve used it in</p>
<p>practice for a lot of issues with</p>
<p>pituitary imbalances</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like I remember even children that were</p>
<p>not growing very well like they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>their growth is stunting stunted and you</p>
<p>put them on that and they just shoot</p>
<p>right up I mean it&rsquo;s just crazy so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and also for older people that have loss</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say muscle mass and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough growth hormone to replace</p>
<p>that uh but two tropin is good for that</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>um so anyway it has a lot of</p>
<p>applications</p>
<p>all right so</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>interesting doing and just try this and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what happens yeah and then</p>
<p>also because the pituitary uh releases a</p>
<p>hormone called ACTH which then caused</p>
<p>the adrenals to release cortisol you</p>
<p>want to make sure that um her stress is</p>
<p>the lowest possible Right the lowest</p>
<p>possible stress and then do that for a</p>
<p>bit a while and then go get it</p>
<p>re-evaluated and see if it&rsquo;s improving</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s improving then</p>
<p>why would you want to why not just keep</p>
<p>going in that direction if you can</p>
<p>improve something you know just even a</p>
<p>little bit</p>
<p>um but I think um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of unknowns right now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but if we go in the direction of</p>
<p>creating more health I think we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be more successful</p>
<p>awesome thanks so much Anita we</p>
<p>appreciate you coming on and hope to</p>
<p>hear back with uh a more stable daughter</p>
<p>there who&rsquo;s feeling better okay let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to uh in fact I think it&rsquo;s time for</p>
<p>quiz question</p>
<p>number three let&rsquo;s see I don&rsquo;t think we</p>
<p>did the truthful did we uh do we answer</p>
<p>quiz question number two no we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um and quiz question number two was a</p>
<p>true false and it said</p>
<p>um there is no such thing as a slow</p>
<p>metabolism it&rsquo;s really highly efficient</p>
<p>uh metabolism so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>72 percent of our respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true and 28 say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally true this is really</p>
<p>interesting I mean</p>
<p>when you think you have a slow</p>
<p>metabolism it&rsquo;s not true it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually your body is adapted to years</p>
<p>of diagonal dieting in the past and then</p>
<p>the body becomes</p>
<p>becomes better for survival under in in</p>
<p>situations of famine</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like a survival mechanism</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re in K the caveman times where</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re just trying to hunt for</p>
<p>food only those who were very overweight</p>
<p>would survive because they their their</p>
<p>system is very efficient uh versus a</p>
<p>fast metabolism you burn up all your fat</p>
<p>and then you you die so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a slow metabolism is super</p>
<p>efficient if you have a car that is very</p>
<p>that can get go longer on a gallon of</p>
<p>gasoline it&rsquo;s more efficient that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly equivalent to someone with</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s considered a slow metabolism so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just have to get a t-shirt for you</p>
<p>and just say I&rsquo;m not overweight I just</p>
<p>have I&rsquo;m just very efficient at burning</p>
<p>fat and I can burn fat a lot longer it</p>
<p>sounds better but that&rsquo;s what happens</p>
<p>especially when you go on a low calorie</p>
<p>diet over a period of time I mean take a</p>
<p>look at</p>
<p>The Biggest Loser what happened with</p>
<p>that group not only did they gain all</p>
<p>the weight back but they gain a lot more</p>
<p>and now it makes it even harder to lose</p>
<p>weight so just with anything</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s exercise or whatever when</p>
<p>you exercise you create a stress your</p>
<p>body breaks down and then it becomes</p>
<p>stronger</p>
<p>when you diet and you lose weight and</p>
<p>you restrict calories your body becomes</p>
<p>more efficient at burning fat so how do</p>
<p>we solve that problem well we don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>keep providing the same amount of</p>
<p>calories but make sure they&rsquo;re quality</p>
<p>make sure there&rsquo;s nutrients make sure we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t create a starvation effect in the</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>and um that&rsquo;s with healthy keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and I and I already</p>
<p>know um when people do that they lose</p>
<p>the weight it&rsquo;s a lot easier they get in</p>
<p>the fat burning and they don&rsquo;t create a</p>
<p>problem with</p>
<p>this um this what&rsquo;s considered a slow</p>
<p>metabolism</p>
<p>all right very good well how about uh</p>
<p>quiz question number three I think you</p>
<p>spoke briefly about fluorescent light so</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>okay what influence does fluorescent</p>
<p>lighting have on a child in a classroom</p>
<p>and boy it assures a lot of that</p>
<p>so climb on that</p>
<p>okay here we go our latest question</p>
<p>comes from covered in cake from YouTube</p>
<p>I remember watching a video of yours</p>
<p>where you said you started eating</p>
<p>breakfast again is that still the case</p>
<p>no um I did a video on that I did say I</p>
<p>told everyone it was an experiment I was</p>
<p>testing it out because I was going to</p>
<p>try to shift the time of eating and have</p>
<p>a breakfast and then like at three</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock right</p>
<p>so I did that for a while</p>
<p>um it just was really really hard with</p>
<p>my with the schedule and other people</p>
<p>eating you know just it just didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not hungry in the morning</p>
<p>um but it does I wanted to test it out</p>
<p>to see if it helped me sleep better and</p>
<p>it did a little bit but</p>
<p>instead I&rsquo;ve reverted back to eating</p>
<p>like at noon or one and then an early</p>
<p>dinner and that seems to work uh for my</p>
<p>schedule and um for everything else so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing right now very</p>
<p>good okay covered in cake uh that should</p>
<p>give you some idea of which direction to</p>
<p>move first remove the cake and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to see clearly what sort</p>
<p>of routine you should do Rudy from</p>
<p>Facebook I&rsquo;m reading the book how not to</p>
<p>die in the beginning of the book the</p>
<p>author shares a diagram that indicates</p>
<p>the keto diet can narrow the arteries</p>
<p>what is your take on that premise</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s written by a vegan doctor</p>
<p>um which I really disagree with a lot of</p>
<p>his things that he talks about</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>I mean let&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll give you one example I</p>
<p>just did an interview yesterday with</p>
<p>someone I&rsquo;ll release the video it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>success story here&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>for almost 400 pounds</p>
<p>52 or 3 years old almost 400 pounds this</p>
<p>was back in February now he&rsquo;s a hundred</p>
<p>pounds less okay but he&rsquo;s off a lot of</p>
<p>medications he&rsquo;s doing fantastic and and</p>
<p>then we have close to if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken 8 000 success stories of people</p>
<p>not just with losing weight but taking</p>
<p>less meds improvement with blood</p>
<p>pressure improving improving with</p>
<p>cardiovascular function</p>
<p>based on</p>
<p>you know you might say well that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>real research but then you think all</p>
<p>these people are making it up I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um to be to say that keto is not healthy</p>
<p>it really depends on the the definition</p>
<p>of your version of Keto too because I</p>
<p>always recommend the healthy version</p>
<p>um in fact</p>
<p>the diet that I recommend probably is</p>
<p>includes more plant-based things than</p>
<p>some of the vegans that I know because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing big salads and vegetables</p>
<p>things like that but you&rsquo;re also having</p>
<p>a moderate amount of high quality</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>um why would that cause any problems</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>thinning of the arteries or thickening</p>
<p>of the arteries or whatever</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking about I think it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reducing inflammation when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reducing these higher levels of refined</p>
<p>carbs and that inflammation comes down</p>
<p>in the arteries as well so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>just because someone says it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make it true you have to look at both</p>
<p>sides and and look at the whole picture</p>
<p>well it certainly does and you know my</p>
<p>doctor</p>
<p>my physician who I go to now suddenly</p>
<p>aspirin which has been the miracle drug</p>
<p>according to traditional medical science</p>
<p>is not anymore it won&rsquo;t help your heart</p>
<p>Eliquis is the only way forward but I</p>
<p>mean and the problem is and who knows if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true not could be but you know</p>
<p>for years people have been you know</p>
<p>relying on the advice of medical doctors</p>
<p>who said aspirin is the miracle drug and</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s not so you know it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>difficult to follow traditional uh you</p>
<p>know Medical Science because the rules</p>
<p>change constantly is it constantly</p>
<p>moving both so it&rsquo;s very frustrating in</p>
<p>that regard but anyway so</p>
<p>um you know aspirin is now degraded all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s see if we have some answers</p>
<p>we certainly do and the last question</p>
<p>asked what influence does fluorescent</p>
<p>lighting have on a child in the</p>
<p>classroom and besides Illuminating their</p>
<p>books 55 percent of our response it says</p>
<p>it depletes vitamin D interesting 25</p>
<p>percent say it creates mental fatigue</p>
<p>and the final 20 say it affects</p>
<p>serotonin levels</p>
<p>oh I&rsquo;m sorry sir I didn&rsquo;t mean to put</p>
<p>you up forgive me we&rsquo;ll get to you next</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>everyone uh of those answers are correct</p>
<p>um but I I actually I&rsquo;m doing a video on</p>
<p>this I&rsquo;m releasing the video uh</p>
<p>releasing it soon but I found some</p>
<p>really interesting research on how it</p>
<p>affects your ability to learn and uh you</p>
<p>know yes it causes fatigue and eye</p>
<p>strain but it affects the cognitive</p>
<p>function to the point where you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>concentrate as well and your fidgety and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re Restless I mean this is</p>
<p>incredible just by having a certain</p>
<p>light on in the classroom you know</p>
<p>fluorescent lights you want incandescent</p>
<p>lights you want also they need to get</p>
<p>more sunlight but you know we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about you know getting off like</p>
<p>artificial foods and artificial</p>
<p>flavorings and artificial colorings and</p>
<p>all that but what about artificial</p>
<p>lights</p>
<p>uh especially especially if someone has</p>
<p>any type of autism they should</p>
<p>definitely change the lighting around</p>
<p>them I mean how many um how many of you</p>
<p>sit in a an office for more than eight</p>
<p>hours with with bad lighting you know or</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s lighting is very very important so</p>
<p>invest in at least in a full spectrum</p>
<p>light incandescent light and then as as</p>
<p>the day gets longer and it starts to</p>
<p>become let&rsquo;s say dark out</p>
<p>um you should probably start dimming the</p>
<p>lights wherever you are and start slowly</p>
<p>bringing the light down and that way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;re gonna sleep</p>
<p>better because</p>
<p>especially the uh fluorescent lights can</p>
<p>affect your ability to sleep</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because they inhibit melatonin but a</p>
<p>candle by the way only inhibits</p>
<p>melatonin by like two percent</p>
<p>incandescent lights limit melatonin by</p>
<p>40 so you could um improve your sleeping</p>
<p>just by changing</p>
<p>um the light source and the intensity of</p>
<p>that light which is interesting very</p>
<p>good all right well listen we gave you</p>
<p>an exciting preview of Lucas from Texas</p>
<p>but just before that uh bringing them on</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go ahead and launch the</p>
<p>next question there it is Dr Berg</p>
<p>okay what are the best two antidotes to</p>
<p>sleeping in a closed room with higher</p>
<p>amounts of CO2 levels because you know</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the room</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>ventilation you could just build up the</p>
<p>CO2 and because maybe you&rsquo;re using up</p>
<p>all the oxygen in that room right so</p>
<p>what are the two antidotes to that to</p>
<p>fix that problem</p>
<p>all right very good and Lucas finally</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with a purpose there you go</p>
<p>and your one question please for Dr Berg</p>
<p>in 30 seconds</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting some coaching there</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>hey good morning so I started keto in</p>
<p>2019 I&rsquo;ve had a lot of success with it</p>
<p>and also with the intermittent fasting I</p>
<p>went from 300 to one point I was 150</p>
<p>right now I&rsquo;m going to steady about 190</p>
<p>and so yeah I&rsquo;m sticking with it I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>even you know getting others on it yay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to turn yeah thank you thank</p>
<p>you I&rsquo;m about to turn 30. I&rsquo;ve kind of</p>
<p>hit some issues I&rsquo;ve been not very</p>
<p>tolerating with the cold uh it&rsquo;s led to</p>
<p>to me kind of fainting I&rsquo;ve had some</p>
<p>public talks where I have to stand up</p>
<p>and and do like a 15-minute talk in</p>
<p>front of people and uh I fainted on</p>
<p>stage it&rsquo;s real embarrassing and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just been it&rsquo;s just been a struggle I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>very lethargic</p>
<p>um not a lot of energy</p>
<p>um can&rsquo;t really exercise as much as I</p>
<p>used to so we&rsquo;re thinking if maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a thyroid problem and so I just wanted</p>
<p>to get some advice on them still doing</p>
<p>keto and if sometimes omad sometimes for</p>
<p>long fasting as well</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a really good great question</p>
<p>because I do remember two years ago when</p>
<p>I turned 30</p>
<p>um I didn&rsquo;t have a similar thing but I</p>
<p>do understand that that change</p>
<p>of a new decade but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m that comes right to mind and um</p>
<p>I would start taking higher amounts of</p>
<p>vitamin B1 natural vitamin B1 because</p>
<p>that supports something called the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s you have the sympathetic</p>
<p>comparison pathetic they both work</p>
<p>together to</p>
<p>maintain equilibrium and homeostasis so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very severe version of what</p>
<p>you told me called pots and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>situation where you can&rsquo;t even stand up</p>
<p>you just like collapse or faint you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>better off lying on your on the bed or</p>
<p>something like that that is a problem</p>
<p>with the autonomic nervous system which</p>
<p>you have that you know it&rsquo;s part of your</p>
<p>adrenal glands and other other places</p>
<p>and any type of stress can trigger it</p>
<p>um but</p>
<p>um I would take B1 that supports the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system and fortunately</p>
<p>for you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another great solution</p>
<p>um I need about maybe three to four</p>
<p>weeks before I release it but I found</p>
<p>um a company that has very inexpensive</p>
<p>devices that you can get</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s the technology to measure the</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system both both sides</p>
<p>sympathetic and parasympathetic</p>
<p>um it gives you all sorts of data about</p>
<p>the vagus nerve and it gives you</p>
<p>information about biofeedback on what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing so now you can do your own</p>
<p>science on</p>
<p>and testing on various things to see</p>
<p>what improves it and kind of look inside</p>
<p>the body</p>
<p>to measure</p>
<p>um things and see if what you are doing</p>
<p>improves certain things</p>
<p>and understand what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>internally it&rsquo;s a great test that uses</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called heart rate variability</p>
<p>technology which I&rsquo;m going to explain in</p>
<p>future videos so stay tuned for that</p>
<p>because I think that would be a great</p>
<p>tool for you</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;ll have to look into it um they</p>
<p>did have me on vitamin B&rsquo;s I just I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel the difference you know maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not the natural form so the</p>
<p>thing with the B1 is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example there&rsquo;s um when</p>
<p>I when I I&rsquo;m into the genetic testing</p>
<p>many people have um</p>
<p>DNA problems with absorbing B1</p>
<p>at the cellular level so if you took</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example you took a</p>
<p>synthetic version and you took the</p>
<p>normal amount</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t see anything</p>
<p>so you might you might have that</p>
<p>situation when you need a lot a lot more</p>
<p>of that so I would take high amounts I</p>
<p>would take high amounts of vitamin B1</p>
<p>and give it more time now</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s not the only thing that you</p>
<p>can do as well you might want to support</p>
<p>the adrenals with ashwagandha</p>
<p>um different herbs that are adaptogens</p>
<p>to see if that doesn&rsquo;t help but it</p>
<p>sounds to me like it could be like</p>
<p>a deficiency of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the resiliency or the adaptation of the</p>
<p>adrenals adapting to</p>
<p>stress and gravity and and other things</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re cold right yes</p>
<p>tells me that your body&rsquo;s tolerance is</p>
<p>lowered you can&rsquo;t tolerate as well so</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m thinking okay yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely autonomic nervous system is</p>
<p>something in that area and um so</p>
<p>I mean even the remedy for that would be</p>
<p>like higher levels of B1 but then</p>
<p>support the adrenals over time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the area that I would dive into and look</p>
<p>more into more than anything else</p>
<p>sure thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great well listen you just</p>
<p>spoke in front of thousands of people</p>
<p>Lucas without fainting so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>call that signs of improvement that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely fantastic well you know um</p>
<p>Steve when someone does get on keto FYI</p>
<p>they the need the demand for B1 goes up</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re deficient even going into</p>
<p>keto and you don&rsquo;t take the B vitamins</p>
<p>or electrolytes that could put more of a</p>
<p>strain on any subclinical deficiency</p>
<p>that you had going into it so</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s um that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend all right very good well we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got some answers on quiz question number</p>
<p>four which asks what are the best two</p>
<p>antidotes to sleeping in a closed room</p>
<p>with higher CO2 levels and 85 percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say add oxygen</p>
<p>generating plants in the room that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s neat 20 say add infrared lighting</p>
<p>and 15 say eliminate uh uh emfs</p>
<p>you know uh</p>
<p>I think those answers are valid um</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um if you add plants to your room a</p>
<p>couple plants big plants</p>
<p>um they give you oxygen they&rsquo;ll take in</p>
<p>that CO2 and give you more oxygen but it</p>
<p>is true that like when you when you</p>
<p>sleep in a closed room the circulation</p>
<p>sometime it&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t necessarily have</p>
<p>the same oxygen levels and CO2 levels as</p>
<p>you would if the if you&rsquo;re outside uh</p>
<p>this is probably why most people when</p>
<p>they crack the window open they sleep so</p>
<p>much better so either open the window or</p>
<p>add plants to your room to balance out</p>
<p>this CO2 oxygen situation</p>
<p>um also when you&rsquo;re at work or in a</p>
<p>classroom with a lot of people that are</p>
<p>sucking up all the oxygen and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>left with this imbalance of CO2 it does</p>
<p>even affect your ability to learn study</p>
<p>Focus concentration</p>
<p>so this is another video that I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to do to show the effects of this</p>
<p>imbalance with a bit too much CO2 and of</p>
<p>course I won&rsquo;t mention anything else</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>other sources of how you developed too</p>
<p>much CO2</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m sure you can read between the</p>
<p>lines all right very good okay thanks</p>
<p>audience let&rsquo;s see back</p>
<p>for more of our social media</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see healthy reviews good grease</p>
<p>okay so this person&rsquo;s going by healthy</p>
<p>reviews plus from YouTube what is your</p>
<p>opinion on consuming Nightshade plants</p>
<p>you know I</p>
<p>for some people they&rsquo;re a problem but</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>I I haven&rsquo;t seen a big problem with</p>
<p>people with night shades I mean things I</p>
<p>I used to look at and get people off</p>
<p>night shades and I didn&rsquo;t see that was</p>
<p>the big culprit to a lot of problems and</p>
<p>night shades are talking about like</p>
<p>um eggplant</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know also like tobacco leaves don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat tobacco leaves right or tomatoes</p>
<p>um right now tomatoes are in season</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re nitrate I I&rsquo;m consuming so many</p>
<p>tomatoes because it&rsquo;s I I can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>keep up with my garden that I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy and I love them because the</p>
<p>season comes and goes and then you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get these tomatoes so we&rsquo;re canning them</p>
<p>and dehydrating and freeze drying them</p>
<p>but um there&rsquo;s nothing better than a</p>
<p>really good tomato from your own garden</p>
<p>but um I don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s something you want</p>
<p>to test out I mean if you have arthritis</p>
<p>or and just avoid them and see if you</p>
<p>feel better</p>
<p>then you would want to avoid them but</p>
<p>you know of course potatoes are not on</p>
<p>the keto list anyway but</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t uh I think I&rsquo;ve mixed</p>
<p>feelings on these nightshades</p>
<p>all right very good by the way Terry</p>
<p>wanted to remind this takes us way back</p>
<p>that these are not names they&rsquo;re handles</p>
<p>like back when they&rsquo;re we all had CB</p>
<p>radios or the truckers do and they go</p>
<p>come on Orange Blossom bring it back so</p>
<p>I get that Terry but uh those are days</p>
<p>long ago anyway so I understand that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably not their birth name but anyway</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re funny so why don&rsquo;t we kick out</p>
<p>with the last question and then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go to the last uh nice person</p>
<p>Lena on here so there you go Dr Burke</p>
<p>okay what is the only situation where</p>
<p>ketones are toxic to the body</p>
<p>All Right audience dig on that as you</p>
<p>always do and Lena uh make sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unmuted and you are on with Dr bird</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke</p>
<p>so much for your educational videos so</p>
<p>much appreciated I have a question on</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I&rsquo;ve been on a 16</p>
<p>hour intermittent fasting six days a</p>
<p>week for two years now and I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>prolong a fasting once at least once a</p>
<p>month to help with my insulin</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m having some problems usually by</p>
<p>the 40th hour I&rsquo;m completely wiped out</p>
<p>I have zero energy I&rsquo;ve been drinking</p>
<p>green tea throughout the fasting I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been drinking Celtics sea salt as well</p>
<p>as vegetable broth</p>
<p>um two other factors I&rsquo;m not sure if my</p>
<p>impact this is that I I have</p>
<p>hypothyroidism as well as I&rsquo;m considered</p>
<p>underweight</p>
<p>and how long are you fasting that once a</p>
<p>month</p>
<p>oh I can barely make it to 48 Hours</p>
<p>usually by 40th hour I&rsquo;m like barely</p>
<p>making it to the table okay I totally</p>
<p>understand I think what you could do</p>
<p>um is I would um</p>
<p>do a smaller level of that for a while</p>
<p>because your body just has to adapt and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite a big step or for your</p>
<p>pre-existing issues that you have to</p>
<p>jump right into that because yeah 40</p>
<p>hours if your body&rsquo;s like okay I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>then eat because you&rsquo;re not quite at</p>
<p>that level your body has to adapt so</p>
<p>maybe what you do because I think you</p>
<p>said you&rsquo;re doing a 16 hour fast right</p>
<p>yes so maybe you go start experimenting</p>
<p>with 17 hours and then 18 hours and I I</p>
<p>like 18 hours as a fast</p>
<p>best because that&rsquo;s pretty routine you</p>
<p>can do that and then do that for a while</p>
<p>I will guarantee if you fast for 18</p>
<p>hours</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll definitely fast a lot longer for</p>
<p>when you do the prolonged fast and then</p>
<p>the other thing is that um</p>
<p>maybe you also try</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>an 18 hour fast and then you go</p>
<p>to omad maybe once a week</p>
<p>once a week</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not going crazy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just going like 23 hours of fasting so</p>
<p>you go 18 and 23 and then do that for a</p>
<p>while until your body gets comfortable</p>
<p>with that</p>
<p>um and I think then you&rsquo;ll be able to go</p>
<p>longer and longer so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things that it&rsquo;s just like if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to the gym and you lift too</p>
<p>much weight you won&rsquo;t be able to do it</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just not used to it so you</p>
<p>have to work get your body to adapt</p>
<p>and become stronger to be able to</p>
<p>tolerate going for longer periods of</p>
<p>time what&rsquo;s happening at the cellular</p>
<p>level is um the mitochondria is not</p>
<p>converting energy from your fat like you</p>
<p>should and maybe you&rsquo;re right you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of extra fat but still even a</p>
<p>thin person has enough fat I mean to</p>
<p>last a good long time without food so</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s what I would do and then also</p>
<p>make sure that your nutrients are right</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re taking the B vitamins</p>
<p>electrolytes and trace minerals and</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin C just</p>
<p>make sure you get those</p>
<p>squared away and um</p>
<p>I think um yeah that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome okay</p>
<p>good luck with that uh Lena you know you</p>
<p>hear these stories about the folks on</p>
<p>life rafts that are a hundred days or a</p>
<p>year and talking about metabolism and</p>
<p>fat levels it&rsquo;s a miracle that they come</p>
<p>back alive you know gnawing on jellyfish</p>
<p>every week or something so what in a</p>
<p>miracle the human body really is</p>
<p>so uh let&rsquo;s see yeah the final question</p>
<p>of the day a terrific one asked uh what</p>
<p>is the only situation where</p>
<p>ketones are toxic to the body and 100 of</p>
<p>our respondents say ketones are</p>
<p>detrimental when they are caused by</p>
<p>ketoacidosis or type 1 diabetes</p>
<p>so you get 100 correct this is a</p>
<p>ketoacidosis situation A type 1 diabetes</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>how common is this it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>very common so in other words if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not a type 1 diabetic okay and even if</p>
<p>you are you just take your insulin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be fine but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about if you are type one and</p>
<p>you forget to take your insulin okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s where the problem is you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily want to go on keto</p>
<p>in that situation but but what about if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have diabetes type 1 okay I</p>
<p>mean even if you had type 2</p>
<p>and you go on low carb and you start</p>
<p>getting in the ketosis</p>
<p>is that going to be toxic are those</p>
<p>ketones toxic no because you there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>way it&rsquo;s impossible to generate that</p>
<p>many ketones to the point where your</p>
<p>body becomes acid to acid it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to happen it&rsquo;s impossible so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>therapeutic version of the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet that is super healthy and normal</p>
<p>our bodies were never designed to eat</p>
<p>the amount of carbohydrates that people</p>
<p>eat and so um when you type this</p>
<p>you know are ketones dangerous on</p>
<p>YouTube or Google you are going to get</p>
<p>pages of pages oh yeah it&rsquo;s toxic</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>ketoacidosis to scare people and</p>
<p>discourage them from trying it when this</p>
<p>is completely false and misinformation</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s very high in Google</p>
<p>unfortunately so anyway you have to um</p>
<p>understand these Basics before you</p>
<p>accepted as truth especially when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting into these questions and ketones</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super healthy it&rsquo;s non-toxic it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually very therapeutic too much</p>
<p>glucose is toxic I mean that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a term called gluclotoxicity I</p>
<p>mean just look that up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;ll be interesting yeah if</p>
<p>you want to feel rotten keep chugging</p>
<p>the sugar okay so uh Dr Berg in the</p>
<p>United States we just love it we can get</p>
<p>stuff uh shipped to our door very easily</p>
<p>is there any movement on our</p>
<p>International efforts to get your great</p>
<p>products to all those that wish to have</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>always and and I think um</p>
<p>um if I&rsquo;m not mistaken we we might even</p>
<p>be in India right now but um yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making the products more available and</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re also keeping the quality the</p>
<p>same okay if not better for certain</p>
<p>things because</p>
<p>um you know one of the things about um</p>
<p>these ingredients</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re and we you know I have like 50</p>
<p>different vendors that Supply</p>
<p>ingredients for our products so we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just about</p>
<p>um contacted every single one and just</p>
<p>doing a severe major Deep dive into</p>
<p>I want to know everything about</p>
<p>um those ingredients to make sure that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like the best quality in fact</p>
<p>parallel to that we&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>growing our own ingredients in a</p>
<p>greenhouse so we&rsquo;re building that as</p>
<p>well so</p>
<p>um I think transparency is going to be</p>
<p>really important because of all the</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>things you can&rsquo;t find out about</p>
<p>transparency especially in the Vitamin</p>
<p>World and you&rsquo;d be shocked to find out</p>
<p>where your products come from even like</p>
<p>the electrolyte powders I did a video on</p>
<p>this if you add a drop of iodine to your</p>
<p>electrolyte powder and it turns dark</p>
<p>purple</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hidden sugar in there usually in</p>
<p>the form of maltodextrin which is a</p>
<p>carbohydrate starch and that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>starch test just add that drop of iodine</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a legitimate test and if you do</p>
<p>that with our products it won&rsquo;t turn</p>
<p>purple it stays yellow</p>
<p>so just just another way to sell people</p>
<p>cheaper ingredients</p>
<p>and uh you know at your expense</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s just not not good</p>
<p>okay JJ from Facebook wants to know</p>
<p>which supplement might help with as they</p>
<p>recover from shingles horrible condition</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s usually triggered by a</p>
<p>lowered immune system mostly by a stress</p>
<p>event and there&rsquo;s a couple uh natural</p>
<p>things you could take that are forms of</p>
<p>zinc so zinc is a really good one to</p>
<p>take when you have shingles it puts that</p>
<p>virus back in remission because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing about shingles it&rsquo;s a it was a</p>
<p>chickenpox virus that goes dormant into</p>
<p>your nervous system and it just hides</p>
<p>out and waits until you get older and</p>
<p>you get sick and you get stressed and it</p>
<p>comes out and it kicks your butt so as</p>
<p>long as you don&rsquo;t get older stressed or</p>
<p>have any body problems you&rsquo;re totally</p>
<p>fine but in the meantime what you can do</p>
<p>is you can um</p>
<p>stay healthy keep the stress low take</p>
<p>your zinc and even vitamin D and keep</p>
<p>that darn thing in remission so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t become a problem but vitamin D</p>
<p>is very very important as well in</p>
<p>shingles I was on a boat trip when I</p>
<p>lived in Southern California and one of</p>
<p>the gentlemen that came on board had an</p>
<p>attack of shingles and it was a fairly</p>
<p>small boat and I&rsquo;ve never seen firsthand</p>
<p>such suffering I mean it was really yeah</p>
<p>painful terrible terrible terrible awful</p>
<p>awful awful okay okay Gina from YouTube</p>
<p>I am on coumadin should I be taking</p>
<p>vitamin K2</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;m going to get in trouble if I</p>
<p>answer that but I would do the research</p>
<p>on it vitamin K1 is the thing that you</p>
<p>want to avoid on Kuma team but check</p>
<p>with your doc to see if you can also</p>
<p>take vitamin K2 I mean you&rsquo;d want to get</p>
<p>a a product that doesn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>blend of K1</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but I will say this there are</p>
<p>medications out there</p>
<p>um that are our blood thinners that are</p>
<p>like Coumadin but you can still take</p>
<p>vitamin K</p>
