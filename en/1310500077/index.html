    <p>The following is a conversation with Alex Garland,</p>
<p>writer and director of many imaginative</p>
<p>and philosophical films from the dreamlike exploration</p>
<p>of human self destruction in the movie Annihilation</p>
<p>to the deep questions of consciousness and intelligence</p>
<p>raised in the movie Ex Machina,</p>
<p>which to me is one of the greatest movies</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence ever made.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m releasing this podcast to coincide</p>
<p>with the release of this new series called Devs</p>
<p>that will premiere this Thursday, March 5th on Hulu</p>
<p>as part of FX on Hulu.</p>
<p>It explores many of the themes this very podcast is about,</p>
<p>from quantum mechanics to artificial life to simulation</p>
<p>to the modern nature of power in the tech world.</p>
<p>I got a chance to watch a preview and loved it.</p>
<p>The acting is great.</p>
<p>Nick Offerman especially is incredible in it.</p>
<p>The cinematography is beautiful</p>
<p>and the philosophical and scientific ideas</p>
<p>explored are profound.</p>
<p>And for me as an engineer and scientist,</p>
<p>which is fun to see brought to life.</p>
<p>For example, if you watch the trailer</p>
<p>for the series carefully,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see there&rsquo;s a programmer with a Russian accent</p>
<p>looking at a screen with Python like code on it</p>
<p>that appears to be using a library</p>
<p>that interfaces with a quantum computer.</p>
<p>This attention and technical detail</p>
<p>on several levels is impressive.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons I&rsquo;m a big fan</p>
<p>of how Alex weaves science and philosophy together</p>
<p>in his work.</p>
<p>Meeting Alex for me was unlikely,</p>
<p>but it was life changing</p>
<p>in ways I may only be able to articulate in a few years.</p>
<p>Just as meeting spot many of Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>for the first time planted a seed of an idea in my mind,</p>
<p>so did meeting Alex Garland.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s humble, curious, intelligent,</p>
<p>and to me an inspiration.</p>
<p>Plus, he&rsquo;s just really a fun person to talk with</p>
<p>about the biggest possible questions in our universe.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends,</p>
<p>buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market</p>
<p>with as little as one dollar.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>let me mention that cryptocurrency</p>
<p>in the context of the history of money is fascinating.</p>
<p>I recommend A Scent of Money</p>
<p>as a great book on this history.</p>
<p>Debits and credits on ledgers started 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The US dollar was created about 200 years ago.</p>
<p>At Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency</p>
<p>was released just over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So given that history,</p>
<p>cryptocurrency is still very much</p>
<p>in its early days of development,</p>
<p>but it still is aiming to</p>
<p>and just might redefine the nature of money.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store</p>
<p>or Google Play and use code LEXPODCAST,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>that is helping advance robotics</p>
<p>and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Alex Garland.</p>
<p>You described the world inside the shimmer</p>
<p>in the movie Annihilation as dreamlike</p>
<p>in that it&rsquo;s internally consistent</p>
<p>but detached from reality.</p>
<p>That leads me to ask,</p>
<p>do you think, a philosophical question, I apologize,</p>
<p>do you think we might be living in a dream</p>
<p>or in a simulation, like the kind that the shimmer creates?</p>
<p>We human beings here today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wanna sort of separate that out into two things.</p>
<p>Yes, I think we&rsquo;re living in a dream of sorts.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re living on a planet</p>
<p>with a very thin layer of atmosphere</p>
<p>and the planet is in a very large space</p>
<p>and the space is full of other planets and stars</p>
<p>and quasars and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think those physical objects,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the matter in that universe is simulated.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>We are definitely,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hot problem with saying definitely,</p>
<p>but in my opinion, I&rsquo;ll just go back to that.</p>
<p>I think it seems very like we&rsquo;re living in a dream state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure we are.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just to do with the nature</p>
<p>of how we experience the world.</p>
<p>We experience it in a subjective way.</p>
<p>And the thing I&rsquo;ve learned most</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve got older in some respects</p>
<p>is the degree to which reality is counterintuitive</p>
<p>and that the things that are presented to us as objective</p>
<p>turn out not to be objective</p>
<p>and quantum mechanics is full of that kind of thing,</p>
<p>but actually just day to day life</p>
<p>is full of that kind of thing as well.</p>
<p>So my understanding of the way the brain works</p>
<p>is you get some information, hit your optic nerve,</p>
<p>and then your brain makes its best guess</p>
<p>about what it&rsquo;s seeing or what it&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s seeing.</p>
<p>It may or may not be an accurate best guess.</p>
<p>It might be an inaccurate best guess.</p>
<p>And that gap, the best guess gap,</p>
<p>means that we are essentially living in a subjective state,</p>
<p>which means that we&rsquo;re in a dream state.</p>
<p>So I think you could enlarge on the dream state</p>
<p>in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>So yes, dream state, no simulation</p>
<p>would be where I&rsquo;d come down.</p>
<p>Going further, deeper into that direction,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve also described that world as psychedelia.</p>
<p>So on that topic, I&rsquo;m curious about that world.</p>
<p>On the topic of psychedelic drugs,</p>
<p>do you see those kinds of chemicals</p>
<p>that modify our perception</p>
<p>as a distortion of our perception of reality</p>
<p>or a window into another reality?</p>
<p>No, I think what I&rsquo;d be saying</p>
<p>is that we live in a distorted reality</p>
<p>and then those kinds of drugs</p>
<p>give us a different kind of distorted.</p>
<p>Different perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>They just give an alternate distortion.</p>
<p>And I think that what they really do</p>
<p>is they give a distorted perception,</p>
<p>which is a little bit more allied to daydreams</p>
<p>or unconscious interests.</p>
<p>So if for some reason you&rsquo;re feeling unconsciously anxious</p>
<p>at that moment and you take a psychedelic drug,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a more pronounced, unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re feeling very calm or happy,</p>
<p>you might have a good time.</p>
<p>But yeah, so if I&rsquo;m saying we&rsquo;re starting from a premise,</p>
<p>our starting point is we were already in the</p>
<p>slightly psychedelic state.</p>
<p>What those drugs do is help you go further down an avenue</p>
<p>or maybe a slightly different avenue, but that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>So in that movie, Annihilation,</p>
<p>the shimmer, this alternate dreamlike state</p>
<p>is created by, I believe perhaps, an alien entity.</p>
<p>Of course, everything is up to interpretation, right?</p>
<p>But do you think there&rsquo;s, in our world, in our universe,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there?</p>
<p>And if so, how different is it from us humans?</p>
<p>Well, one of the things I was trying to do in Annihilation</p>
<p>was to offer up a form of alien life</p>
<p>that was actually alien,</p>
<p>because it would often seem to me that in the way</p>
<p>that in the way we would represent aliens in books</p>
<p>or cinema or television,</p>
<p>or any one of the sort of storytelling mediums,</p>
<p>is we would always give them very humanlike qualities.</p>
<p>So they wanted to teach us about galactic federations,</p>
<p>or they wanted to eat us, or they wanted our resources,</p>
<p>like our water, or they want to enslave us,</p>
<p>or whatever it happens to be.</p>
<p>But all of these are incredibly humanlike motivations.</p>
<p>And I was interested in the idea of an alien</p>
<p>that was not in any way like us.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t share.</p>
<p>Maybe it had a completely different clock speed.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s way, so we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at each other,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting information, light hits our optic nerve,</p>
<p>our brain makes the best guess of what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s right, something, you know,</p>
<p>the thing we were talking about before.</p>
<p>What if this alien doesn&rsquo;t have an optic nerve?</p>
<p>Maybe its way of encountering the space it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>is wholly different.</p>
<p>Maybe it has a different relationship with gravity.</p>
<p>The basic laws of physics it operates under</p>
<p>might be fundamentally different.</p>
<p>It could be a different time scale and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, or it could be the same laws,</p>
<p>could be the same underlying laws of physics.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a machine created,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a creature created in a quantum mechanical way.</p>
<p>It just ends up in a very, very different place</p>
<p>to the one we end up in.</p>
<p>So, part of the preoccupation with annihilation</p>
<p>was to come up with an alien that was really alien</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t give us,</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t give us and we didn&rsquo;t give it</p>
<p>any kind of easy connection between human and the alien.</p>
<p>Because I think it was to do with the idea</p>
<p>that you could have an alien that landed on this planet</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t even know we were here.</p>
<p>And we might only glancingly know it was here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d just be this strange point</p>
<p>where the vent diagrams connected,</p>
<p>where we could sense each other or something like that.</p>
<p>So in the movie, first of all, incredibly original view</p>
<p>of what an alien life would be.</p>
<p>And in that sense, it&rsquo;s a huge success.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go inside your imagination.</p>
<p>Did the alien, that alien entity know anything about humans</p>
<p>when it landed?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So the idea is you&rsquo;re basically an alien</p>
<p>that life is trying to reach out to anything</p>
<p>that might be able to hear its mechanism of communication.</p>
<p>Or was it simply, was it just basically their biologist</p>
<p>exploring different kinds of stuff that you can find?</p>
<p>But this is the interesting thing is,</p>
<p>as soon as you say their biologist,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done the thing of attributing</p>
<p>human type motivations to it.</p>
<p>So I was trying to free myself from anything like that.</p>
<p>So all sorts of questions you might answer</p>
<p>about this notional alien, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to answer</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know what it was or how it worked.</p>
<p>You know, I had some rough ideas.</p>
<p>Like it had a very, very, very slow clock speed.</p>
<p>And I thought maybe the way it is interacting</p>
<p>with this environment is a little bit like</p>
<p>the way an octopus will change its color forms</p>
<p>around the space that it&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of reacting to what it&rsquo;s in to an extent,</p>
<p>but the reason it&rsquo;s reacting in that way is indeterminate.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so, but it&rsquo;s clock speed was slower</p>
<p>than our human life clock speed or inter,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s faster than evolution.</p>
<p>Faster than our evolution.</p>
<p>Yeah, given the 4 billion years it took us to get here,</p>
<p>then yes, maybe it started at eight.</p>
<p>If you look at the human civilization as a single organism,</p>
<p>in that sense, you know, this evolution could be us.</p>
<p>You know, the evolution of living organisms on earth</p>
<p>could be just a single organism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s its life,</p>
<p>is the evolution process that eventually will lead</p>
<p>to probably the heat death of the universe</p>
<p>or something before that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just an incredible idea.</p>
<p>So you almost don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve created something</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t even know how it works.</p>
<p>Yeah, because anytime I tried to look into</p>
<p>how it might work,</p>
<p>I would then inevitably be attaching</p>
<p>my kind of thought processes into it.</p>
<p>And I wanted to try and put a bubble around it.</p>
<p>I would say, no, this is alien in its most alien form.</p>
<p>I have no real point of contact.</p>
<p>So unfortunately I can&rsquo;t talk to Stanley Kubrick.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really fortunate to get a chance to talk to you.</p>
<p>On this particular notion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask it a bunch of different ways</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll explore it in different ways,</p>
<p>but do you ever consider human imagination,</p>
<p>your imagination as a window into a possible future?</p>
<p>And that what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting that imagination on paper as a writer</p>
<p>and then on screen as a director.</p>
<p>And that plants the seeds in the minds of millions</p>
<p>of future and current scientists.</p>
<p>And so your imagination, you putting it down</p>
<p>actually makes it as a reality.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a first step of the scientific method</p>
<p>that you imagining what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>in your new series with Ex Machina</p>
<p>is actually inspiring thousands of 12 year olds,</p>
<p>millions of scientists</p>
<p>and actually creating the future view of imagine.</p>
<p>Well, all I could say is that from my point of view,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost exactly the reverse</p>
<p>because I see that pretty much everything I do</p>
<p>is a reaction to what scientists are doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an interested lay person.</p>
<p>And I feel this individual,</p>
<p>I feel that the most interesting area</p>
<p>that humans are involved in is science.</p>
<p>I think art is very, very interesting,</p>
<p>but the most interesting is science.</p>
<p>And science is in a weird place</p>
<p>because maybe around the time Newton was alive,</p>
<p>if a very, very interested lay person said to themselves,</p>
<p>I want to really understand what Newton is saying</p>
<p>about the way the world works</p>
<p>with a few years of dedicated thinking,</p>
<p>they would be able to understand</p>
<p>the sort of principles he was laying out.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true anymore.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s stopped being true now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty smart guy.</p>
<p>And if I said to myself,</p>
<p>I want to really, really understand</p>
<p>what is currently the state of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>or string theory or any of the sort of branching areas of it,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be intellectually incapable of doing it</p>
<p>because to work in those fields at the moment</p>
<p>is a bit like being an athlete.</p>
<p>I suspect you need to start when you&rsquo;re 12, you know?</p>
<p>And if you start in your mid 20s,</p>
<p>start trying to understand in your mid 20s,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re just never going to catch up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it feels to me.</p>
<p>So what I do is I try to make myself open.</p>
<p>So the people that you&rsquo;re implying maybe I would influence,</p>
<p>to me, it&rsquo;s exactly the other way around.</p>
<p>These people are strongly influencing me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking they&rsquo;re doing something fascinating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concentrating and working as hard as I can</p>
<p>to try and understand the implications of what they say.</p>
<p>And in some ways, often what I&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>is disseminate their ideas</p>
<p>into a means by which it can enter a public conversation.</p>
<p>So Ex Machina contains lots of name checks,</p>
<p>all sorts of existing thought experiments,</p>
<p>shadows on Plato&rsquo;s cave and Mary in the black and white room</p>
<p>and all sorts of different longstanding thought processes</p>
<p>about sentience or consciousness or subjectivity</p>
<p>or gender or whatever it happens to be.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m trying to marshal that into a narrative</p>
<p>to say, look, this stuff is interesting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also relevant and this is my best shot at it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m the one being influenced in my construction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Of course you would say that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not even aware of your own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably what Kubrick would say too, right?</p>
<p>Is in describing why, how 9,000 is created</p>
<p>the way how 9,000 is created,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re just studying what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but the reality when the specifics of the knowledge</p>
<p>passes through your imagination,</p>
<p>I would argue that you&rsquo;re incorrect</p>
<p>in thinking that you&rsquo;re just disseminating knowledge</p>
<p>that the very act of your imagination consuming that science,</p>
<p>it creates something that creates the next step,</p>
<p>potentially creates the next step.</p>
<p>I certainly think that&rsquo;s true with 2001 A Space Odyssey.</p>
<p>I think at its best, and if it fails.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true of that, yeah, it&rsquo;s true of that, definitely.</p>
<p>At its best, it plans something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe it.</p>
<p>It inspires the next generation</p>
<p>and it could be field dependent.</p>
<p>So your new series has more a connection to physics,</p>
<p>quantum physics, quantum mechanics, quantum computing,</p>
<p>and yet Ex Machina has more artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I know more about AI.</p>
<p>My sense that AI is much earlier</p>
<p>in the depth of its understanding.</p>
<p>I would argue nobody understands anything</p>
<p>to the depth that physicists do about physics.</p>
<p>In AI, nobody understands AI,</p>
<p>that there is a lot of importance and role for imagination,</p>
<p>which I think we&rsquo;re in that,</p>
<p>where Freud imagined the subconscious,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in that stage of AI,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of imagination needed</p>
<p>thinking outside the box.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The spread of discussions and the spread of anxieties</p>
<p>that exists about AI fascinate me.</p>
<p>The way in which some people seem terrified about it</p>
<p>whilst also pursuing it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never shared that fear about AI personally,</p>
<p>but the way in which it agitates people</p>
<p>and also the people who it agitates,</p>
<p>I find kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>Are you afraid?</p>
<p>Are you excited?</p>
<p>Are you sad by the possibility,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take the existential risk</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>by the possibility an artificial intelligence system</p>
<p>becomes our offspring and makes us obsolete?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a huge subject to talk about, I suppose.</p>
<p>But one of the things I think is that humans</p>
<p>are actually very experienced at creating new life forms</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s why you and I are both here</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s why everyone on the planet is here.</p>
<p>And so something in the process of having a living thing</p>
<p>that exists that didn&rsquo;t exist previously</p>
<p>is very much encoded into the structures of our life</p>
<p>and the structures of our societies.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean we always get it right,</p>
<p>but it does mean we&rsquo;ve learned quite a lot about that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned quite a lot about what the dangers are</p>
<p>of allowing things to be unchecked.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why we then create systems</p>
<p>of checks and balances in our government</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not to say,</p>
<p>the other thing is it seems like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of things that you could put</p>
<p>into a machine that you would not be.</p>
<p>So with us, we sort of roughly try to give some rules</p>
<p>to live by and some of us then live by those rules</p>
<p>and some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And with a machine,</p>
<p>it feels like you could enforce those things.</p>
<p>So partly because of our previous experience</p>
<p>and partly because of the different nature of a machine,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t feel anxious about it.</p>
<p>More I just see all the good that,</p>
<p>broadly speaking, the good that can come from it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just where I am on that anxiety spectrum.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of, there&rsquo;s a sadness.</p>
<p>So we as humans give birth to other humans, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s generations.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s often in the older generation,</p>
<p>a sadness about what the world has become now.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, there is, but there&rsquo;s a counterpoint as well,</p>
<p>which is that most parents would wish</p>
<p>for a better life for their children.</p>
<p>So there may be a regret about some things about the past,</p>
<p>but broadly speaking, what people really want</p>
<p>is that things will be better</p>
<p>for the future generations, not worse.</p>
<p>And so, and then it&rsquo;s a question about</p>
<p>what constitutes a future generation.</p>
<p>A future generation could involve people.</p>
<p>It also could involve machines</p>
<p>and it could involve a sort of cross pollinated version</p>
<p>of the two or any, but none of those things</p>
<p>make me feel anxious.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t give you anxiety.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t excite you?</p>
<p>Like anything that&rsquo;s new?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Not anything that&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, for example, I&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>my anxieties relate to things like social media</p>
<p>that, so I&rsquo;ve got plenty of anxieties about that.</p>
<p>Which is also driven by artificial intelligence</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s too much information</p>
<p>to be able to, an algorithm has to filter that information</p>
<p>and present to you.</p>
<p>So ultimately the algorithm, a simple,</p>
<p>oftentimes simple algorithm is controlling</p>
<p>the flow of information on social media.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another form of AI.</p>
<p>But at least my sense of it, I might be wrong,</p>
<p>but my sense of it is that the algorithms have</p>
<p>an either conscious or unconscious bias,</p>
<p>which is created by the people</p>
<p>who are making the algorithms</p>
<p>and sort of delineating the areas</p>
<p>to which those algorithms are gonna lean.</p>
<p>And so for example, the kind of thing I&rsquo;d be worried about</p>
<p>is that it hasn&rsquo;t been thought about enough</p>
<p>how dangerous it is to allow algorithms</p>
<p>to create echo chambers, say.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to be about the AI</p>
<p>or the algorithm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the naivety of the people</p>
<p>who are constructing the algorithms to do that thing.</p>
<p>If you see what I mean.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So in your new series, Devs,</p>
<p>and we could speak more broadly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, let&rsquo;s talk about the people</p>
<p>constructing those algorithms,</p>
<p>which in our modern society, Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>those algorithms happen to be a source of a lot of income</p>
<p>because of advertisements.</p>
<p>So let me ask sort of a question about those people.</p>
<p>Are current concerns and failures on social media,</p>
<p>their naivety?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t pronounce that word well.</p>
<p>Are they naive?</p>
<p>Are they, I use that word carefully,</p>
<p>but evil in intent or misaligned in intent?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a, do they mean well</p>
<p>and just go have an unintended consequence?</p>
<p>Or is there something dark in them</p>
<p>that results in them creating a company</p>
<p>results in that super competitive drive to be successful.</p>
<p>And those are the people that will end up</p>
<p>controlling the algorithms.</p>
<p>At a guess, I&rsquo;d say there are instances</p>
<p>of all those things.</p>
<p>So sometimes I think it&rsquo;s naivety.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think it&rsquo;s extremely dark.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think people are not being naive or dark.</p>
<p>And then in those instances are sometimes</p>
<p>generating things that are very benign</p>
<p>and other times generating things</p>
<p>that despite their best intentions are not very benign.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something, I think the reason why I don&rsquo;t get anxious</p>
<p>about AI in terms of, or at least AIs that have,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a relationship with,</p>
<p>some sort of relationship with humans</p>
<p>is that I think that&rsquo;s the stuff we&rsquo;re quite well equipped</p>
<p>to understand how to mitigate.</p>
<p>The problem is issues that relate actually</p>
<p>to the power of humans or the wealth of humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s dangerous here and now.</p>
<p>So what I see, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I sometimes feel</p>
<p>about Silicon Valley is that it&rsquo;s like Wall Street</p>
<p>in the 80s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rabidly capitalistic, absolutely rabidly capitalistic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s rabidly greedy.</p>
<p>But whereas in the 80s, the sense one had of Wall Street</p>
<p>was that these people kind of knew they were sharks</p>
<p>and in a way relished in being sharks</p>
<p>and dressed in sharp suits and kind of lorded</p>
<p>over other people and felt good about doing it.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley has managed to hide</p>
<p>its voracious Wall Street like capitalism</p>
<p>behind hipster T shirts and cool cafes in the place</p>
<p>where they set up there.</p>
<p>And so that obfuscates what&rsquo;s really going on</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s really going on is the absolute voracious pursuit</p>
<p>of money and power.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where it gets shaky for me.</p>
<p>So that veneer and you explore that brilliantly,</p>
<p>that veneer of virtue that Silicon Valley has.</p>
<p>Which they believe themselves, I&rsquo;m sure for a long time.</p>
<p>Okay, I hope to be one of those people and I believe that.</p>
<p>So as maybe a devil&rsquo;s advocate term,</p>
<p>poorly used in this case,</p>
<p>what if some of them really are trying</p>
<p>to build a better world?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I think some of them are.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve spoken to ones who I believe in their heart</p>
<p>feel they&rsquo;re building a better world.</p>
<p>Are they not able to?</p>
<p>No, they may or may not be,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just as a zone with a lot of bullshit flying about.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also another thing,</p>
<p>which is this actually goes back to,</p>
<p>I always thought about some sports</p>
<p>that later turned out to be corrupt</p>
<p>in the way that the sport,</p>
<p>like who won the boxing match</p>
<p>or how a football match got thrown or cricket match</p>
<p>or whatever happened to be.</p>
<p>And I used to think, well, look,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a lot of money</p>
<p>and there really is a lot of money,</p>
<p>people stand to make millions or even billions,</p>
<p>you will find a corruption that&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in the nature of its voracious appetite</p>
<p>that some people will be corrupt</p>
<p>and some people will exploit</p>
<p>whilst thinking they&rsquo;re doing something good.</p>
<p>But there are also people who I think are very, very smart</p>
<p>and very benign and actually very self aware.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not trying to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to wipe out the motivations</p>
<p>of this entire area.</p>
<p>But I do, there are people in that world</p>
<p>who scare the hell out of me.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a little bit naive in that,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t care at all about money.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m a&hellip;</p>
<p>You might be one of the good guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so the thought is, but I don&rsquo;t have money.</p>
<p>So my thought is if you give me a billion dollars,</p>
<p>I would, it would change nothing</p>
<p>and I would spend it right away</p>
<p>on investing it right back and creating a good world.</p>
<p>But your intuition is that billion,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about that money</p>
<p>that maybe slowly corrupts the people around you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody gets in that corrupts your soul</p>
<p>the way you view the world.</p>
<p>Money does corrupt, we know that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a different sort of problem</p>
<p>aside from just the money corrupts thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re familiar with throughout history.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more about the sense of reinforcement</p>
<p>an individual gets, which is so&hellip;</p>
<p>It effectively works like the reason I earned all this money</p>
<p>and so much more money than anyone else</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;m very gifted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a bit smarter than they are,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m a lot smarter than they are,</p>
<p>and I can see the future in the way they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And maybe some of those people are not particularly smart,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very lucky,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re very talented entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a difference between&hellip;</p>
<p>So in other words, the acquisition of the money and power</p>
<p>can suddenly start to feel like evidence of virtue.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not evidence of virtue,</p>
<p>it might be evidence of completely different things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliantly put, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s brilliantly put.</p>
<p>So I think one of the fundamental drivers</p>
<p>of my current morality&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me just represent nerds in general of all kinds,</p>
<p>is of constant self doubt and the signals&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very sensitive to signals from people that tell me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>But when there&rsquo;s a huge inflow of money,</p>
<p>you just put it brilliantly</p>
<p>that that could become an overpowering signal</p>
<p>that everything you do is right.</p>
<p>And so your moral compass can just get thrown off.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that is not contained to Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s across the board.</p>
<p>In general, yeah.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m from the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the current president is convinced, I believe,</p>
<p>actually he wants to do really good by the country</p>
<p>and by the world,</p>
<p>but his moral compass may be off because&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s the interesting thing about evil,</p>
<p>which is that I think most people</p>
<p>who do spectacularly evil things think themselves</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing really good things.</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re not there thinking,</p>
<p>I am a sort of incarnation of Satan.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking, yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen a way to fix the world</p>
<p>and everyone else is wrong, here I go.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m having a fascinating conversation</p>
<p>with a historian of Stalin, and he took power.</p>
<p>He actually got more power</p>
<p>than almost any person in history.</p>
<p>And he wanted, he didn&rsquo;t want power.</p>
<p>He just wanted, he truly,</p>
<p>and this is what people don&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>he truly believed that communism</p>
<p>will make for a better world.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And he wanted power.</p>
<p>He wanted to destroy the competition</p>
<p>to make sure that we actually make communism work</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union and then spread across the world.</p>
<p>He was trying to do good.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s typically the case</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what people think they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I think that, but you don&rsquo;t need to go to Stalin.</p>
<p>I mean, Stalin, I think Stalin probably got pretty crazy,</p>
<p>but actually that&rsquo;s another part of it,</p>
<p>which is that the other thing that comes</p>
<p>from being convinced of your own virtue</p>
<p>is that then you stop listening to the modifiers around you.</p>
<p>And that tends to drive people crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s other people that keep us sane.</p>
<p>And if you stop listening to them,</p>
<p>I think you go a bit mad.</p>
<p>That also happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Disagreement keeps us sane.</p>
<p>To jump back for an entire generation of AI researchers,</p>
<p>2001, a Space Odyssey, put an image,</p>
<p>the idea of human level, superhuman level intelligence</p>
<p>into their mind.</p>
<p>Do you ever, sort of jumping back to Ex Machina</p>
<p>and talk a little bit about that,</p>
<p>do you ever consider the audience of people</p>
<p>who build the systems, the roboticists, the scientists</p>
<p>that build the systems based on the stories you create,</p>
<p>which I would argue, I mean, there&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>most of the top researchers about 40, 50 years old and plus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their favorite movie, 2001 Space Odyssey.</p>
<p>And it really is in their work, their idea of what ethics is,</p>
<p>of what is the target, the hope, the dangers of AI,</p>
<p>is that movie, right?</p>
<p>Do you ever consider the impact on those researchers</p>
<p>when you create the work you do?</p>
<p>Certainly not with Ex Machina in relation to 2001,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not sure, I mean, I&rsquo;d be pleased if there was,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure in a way there isn&rsquo;t a fundamental</p>
<p>discussion of issues to do with AI that isn&rsquo;t already</p>
<p>and better dealt with by 2001.</p>
<p>2001 does a very, very good account of the way</p>
<p>in which an AI might think and also potential issues</p>
<p>with the way the AI might think.</p>
<p>And also then a separate question about whether the AI</p>
<p>is malevolent or benevolent.</p>
<p>And 2001 doesn&rsquo;t really, it&rsquo;s a slightly odd thing</p>
<p>to be making a film when you know there&rsquo;s a preexisting film</p>
<p>which is not a really superb job.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s questions of consciousness, embodiment,</p>
<p>and also the same kinds of questions.</p>
<p>Because those are my two favorite AI movies.</p>
<p>So can you compare Hal 9000 and Ava,</p>
<p>Hal 9000 from 2001 Space Odyssey and Ava from Ex Machina?</p>
<p>The, in your view, from a philosophical perspective.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve got different goals.</p>
<p>The two AIs have completely different goals.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really the difference.</p>
<p>So in some respects, Ex Machina took as a premise</p>
<p>how do you assess whether something else has consciousness?</p>
<p>So it was a version of the Turing test,</p>
<p>except instead of having the machine hidden,</p>
<p>you put the machine in plain sight</p>
<p>in the way that we are in plain sight of each other</p>
<p>and say now assess the consciousness.</p>
<p>And the way it was illustrating the way in which you&rsquo;d assess</p>
<p>the state of consciousness of a machine</p>
<p>is exactly the same way we assess</p>
<p>the state of consciousness of each other.</p>
<p>And in exactly the same way that in a funny way,</p>
<p>your sense of my consciousness is actually based</p>
<p>primarily on your own consciousness.</p>
<p>That is also then true with the machine.</p>
<p>And so it was actually about how much of</p>
<p>the sense of consciousness is a projection</p>
<p>rather than something that consciousness</p>
<p>is actually containing.</p>
<p>And has Plato&rsquo;s cave, I mean, this you really explored,</p>
<p>you could argue that how sort of Space Odyssey explores</p>
<p>idea of the Turing test for intelligence,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not tests, there&rsquo;s no test,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more focused on intelligence.</p>
<p>And Ex Machina kind of goes around intelligence</p>
<p>and says the consciousness of the human to human,</p>
<p>human to robot interactions more interest,</p>
<p>more important, more at least the focus</p>
<p>of that particular movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s about the interior state</p>
<p>and what constitutes the interior state</p>
<p>and how do we know it&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>And actually in that respect,</p>
<p>Ex Machina is as much about consciousness in general</p>
<p>as it is to do specifically with machine consciousness.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also interesting,</p>
<p>you know that thing you started asking about,</p>
<p>the dream state, and I was saying,</p>
<p>well, I think we&rsquo;re all in a dream state</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all in a subjective state.</p>
<p>One of the things that I became aware of with Ex Machina</p>
<p>is that the way in which people reacted to the film</p>
<p>was very based on what they took into the film.</p>
<p>So many people thought Ex Machina was the tale</p>
<p>of a sort of evil robot who murders two men and escapes.</p>
<p>And she has no empathy, for example,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s a machine.</p>
<p>Whereas I felt, no, she was a conscious being</p>
<p>with a consciousness different from mine, but so what,</p>
<p>imprisoned and made a bunch of value judgments</p>
<p>about how to get out of that box.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a moment which it sort of slightly bugs me,</p>
<p>but nobody ever has noticed it and it&rsquo;s years after,</p>
<p>so I might as well say it now,</p>
<p>which is that after Ava has escaped,</p>
<p>she crosses a room and as she&rsquo;s crossing a room,</p>
<p>this is just before she leaves the building,</p>
<p>she looks over her shoulder and she smiles.</p>
<p>And I thought after all the conversation about tests,</p>
<p>in a way, the best indication you could have</p>
<p>of the interior state of someone</p>
<p>is if they are not being observed</p>
<p>and they smile about something</p>
<p>with their smiling for themself.</p>
<p>And that to me was evidence of Ava&rsquo;s true sentience,</p>
<p>whatever that sentience was.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s really interesting, we don&rsquo;t get to observe Ava much</p>
<p>or something like a smile in any context</p>
<p>except through interaction,</p>
<p>trying to convince others that she&rsquo;s conscious,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>But it was a small, in a funny way,</p>
<p>I think maybe people saw it as an evil smile,</p>
<p>like, ha, I fooled them.</p>
<p>But actually it was just a smile.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, in the end,</p>
<p>after all the conversations about the test,</p>
<p>that was the answer to the test and then off she goes.</p>
<p>So if we align, if we just linger a little bit longer</p>
<p>on Hal and Ava, do you think in terms of motivation,</p>
<p>what was Hal&rsquo;s motivation?</p>
<p>Is Hal good or evil?</p>
<p>Is Ava good or evil?</p>
<p>Ava&rsquo;s good, in my opinion, and Hal is neutral</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think Hal is presented</p>
<p>as having a sophisticated emotional life.</p>
<p>He has a set of paradigms,</p>
<p>which is that the mission needs to be completed.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a version of the paperclip.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The idea that it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a super intelligent machine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just performed a particular task</p>
<p>and in doing that task may destroy everybody on Earth</p>
<p>or may achieve undesirable effects for us humans.</p>
<p>Precisely, yeah.</p>
<p>But what if&hellip;</p>
<p>At the very end, he says something like I&rsquo;m afraid, Dave,</p>
<p>but that may be he is on some level experiencing fear</p>
<p>or it may be this is the terms in which it would be wise</p>
<p>to stop someone from doing the thing they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>if you see what I mean.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>So actually that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s such a small, short exploration of consciousness</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m afraid, and then you just with ex machina say,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna magnify that part</p>
<p>and then minimize the other part.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to sort of compare the two.</p>
<p>But if you could just use your imagination,</p>
<p>if Ava sort of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>ran the, was president of the United States,</p>
<p>so had some power.</p>
<p>So what kind of world would you want to create?</p>
<p>If you kind of say good, and there is a sense</p>
<p>that she has a really, like there&rsquo;s a desire</p>
<p>for a better human to human interaction,</p>
<p>human to robot interaction in her.</p>
<p>But what kind of world do you think she would create</p>
<p>with that desire?</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s a really, that&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna approach it slightly obliquely,</p>
<p>which is that if a friend of yours</p>
<p>got stabbed in a mugging, and you then felt very angry</p>
<p>at the person who&rsquo;d done the stabbing,</p>
<p>but then you learned that it was a 15 year old</p>
<p>and the 15 year old, both their parents were addicted</p>
<p>to crystal meth and the kid had been addicted</p>
<p>since he was 10.</p>
<p>And he really never had any hope in the world.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d been driven crazy by his upbringing</p>
<p>and did the stabbing that would hugely modify.</p>
<p>And it would also make you wary about that kid</p>
<p>then becoming president of America.</p>
<p>And Ava has had a very, very distorted introduction</p>
<p>into the world.</p>
<p>So, although there&rsquo;s nothing as it were organically</p>
<p>within Ava that would lean her towards badness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that robots or sentient robots are bad.</p>
<p>She did not, her arrival into the world</p>
<p>was being imprisoned by humans.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m not sure she&rsquo;d be a great president.</p>
<p>The trajectory through which she arrived</p>
<p>at her moral views have some dark elements.</p>
<p>But I like Ava personally, I like Ava.</p>
<p>Would you vote for her?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having difficulty finding anyone to vote for</p>
<p>in my country or if I lived here in yours.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a yes, I guess, because I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>Yes, I guess, because of the competition.</p>
<p>She could easily do a better job than any of the people</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got around at the moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d vote her over Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>So, what is a good test of consciousness?</p>
<p>We talk about consciousness a little bit more.</p>
<p>If something appears conscious, is it conscious?</p>
<p>You mentioned the smile, which seems to be something done.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a really good indication</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a tree falling in the forest</p>
<p>with nobody there to hear it.</p>
<p>But does the appearance from a robotics perspective</p>
<p>of consciousness mean consciousness to you?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think you could say that fully</p>
<p>because I think you could then easily have</p>
<p>a thought experiment which said,</p>
<p>we will create something which we know is not conscious</p>
<p>but is going to give a very, very good account</p>
<p>of seeming conscious.</p>
<p>And so, and also it would be a particularly bad test</p>
<p>where humans are involved because humans are so quick</p>
<p>to project sentience into things that don&rsquo;t have sentience.</p>
<p>So, someone could have their computer playing up</p>
<p>and feel as if their computer is being malevolent to them</p>
<p>when it clearly isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so, of all the things to judge consciousness, us.</p>
<p>Humans are bad at it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re empathy machines.</p>
<p>So, the flip side of it is that</p>
<p>so the flip side of that,</p>
<p>the argument there is because we just attribute consciousness</p>
<p>to everything almost and anthropomorphize everything</p>
<p>including Roombas, that maybe consciousness is not real,</p>
<p>that we just attribute consciousness to each other.</p>
<p>So, you have a sense that there is something really special</p>
<p>going on in our mind that makes us unique</p>
<p>and gives us this subjective experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very interesting going on in our minds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slightly worried about the word special</p>
<p>because it gets a bit, it nudges towards metaphysics</p>
<p>and maybe even magic.</p>
<p>I mean, in some ways, something magic like,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think is there at all.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think about,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s an idea called panpsychism</p>
<p>that says consciousness is in everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t buy that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the idea that there is a thing</p>
<p>that it would be like to be the sun.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I don&rsquo;t buy that.</p>
<p>I think that consciousness is a thing.</p>
<p>My sort of broad modification is that usually</p>
<p>the more I find out about things,</p>
<p>the more illusory our instinct is</p>
<p>and is leading us into a different direction</p>
<p>about what that thing actually is.</p>
<p>That happens, it seems to me in modern science,</p>
<p>that happens a hell of a lot,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s to do with even how big or small things are.</p>
<p>So my sense is that consciousness is a thing,</p>
<p>but it isn&rsquo;t quite the thing</p>
<p>or maybe very different from the thing</p>
<p>that we instinctively think it is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>but we may be in sort of quite fundamentally</p>
<p>misunderstanding it for reasons that are based on intuition.</p>
<p>So I have to ask, this is kind of an interesting question.</p>
<p>The Ex Machina for many people, including myself,</p>
<p>is one of the greatest AI films ever made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s number two for me.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely not number one.</p>
<p>If it was number one, I&rsquo;d really have to, anyway, yeah.</p>
<p>Whenever you grow up with something, right,</p>
<p>whenever you grow up with something, it&rsquo;s in the mud.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, one of the things that people bring up,</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t please everyone, including myself,</p>
<p>this is what I first reacted to the film,</p>
<p>is the idea of the lone genius.</p>
<p>This is the criticism that people say,</p>
<p>sort of me as an AI researcher,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to create what Nathan is trying to do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a brilliant series called Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Absolutely spectacular.</p>
<p>I mean, they got so many things brilliant or right.</p>
<p>But one of the things, again, the criticism there.</p>
<p>Yeah, they conflated lots of people into one.</p>
<p>Into one character that represents all nuclear scientists,</p>
<p>Ivana Komiak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a composite character that presents all scientists.</p>
<p>Is this what you were,</p>
<p>is this the way you were thinking about that?</p>
<p>Or is it just simplifies the storytelling?</p>
<p>How do you think about the lone genius?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d say this, the series I&rsquo;m doing at the moment</p>
<p>is a critique in part of the lone genius concept.</p>
<p>So yes, I&rsquo;m sort of oppositional</p>
<p>and either agnostic or atheistic about that as a concept.</p>
<p>I mean, not entirely.</p>
<p>Whether lone is the right word, broadly isolated,</p>
<p>but Newton clearly exists in a sort of bubble of himself,</p>
<p>in some respects, so does Shakespeare.</p>
<p>So do you think we would have an iPhone without Steve Jobs?</p>
<p>I mean, how much contribution from a genius?</p>
<p>Steve Jobs clearly isn&rsquo;t a lone genius</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s too many other people</p>
<p>in the sort of superstructure around him</p>
<p>who are absolutely fundamental to that journey.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying Newton, but that&rsquo;s a scientific,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s an engineering element to building Ava.</p>
<p>But just to say, what Ex Machina is really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a thought experiment.</p>
<p>I mean, so it&rsquo;s a construction</p>
<p>of putting four people in a house.</p>
<p>Nothing about Ex Machina adds up in all sorts of ways,</p>
<p>in as much as the, who built the machine parts?</p>
<p>Did the people building the machine parts</p>
<p>know what they were creating and how did they get there?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a thought experiment.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t stand up to scrutiny of that sort.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s actually that interesting of a question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s brought up so often that I had to ask it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s exactly how I felt after a while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about, there was almost a defense,</p>
<p>like I watched your movie the first time</p>
<p>and at least for the first little while in a defensive way,</p>
<p>like how dare this person try to step into the AI space</p>
<p>and try to beat Kubrick.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I was thinking,</p>
<p>because it comes off as a movie that really is going</p>
<p>after the deep fundamental questions about AI.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of a nerd do this,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s automatically searching for the flaws.</p>
<p>And I did.</p>
<p>I do exactly the same.</p>
<p>I think in Annihilation, in the other movie,</p>
<p>I was be able to free myself from that much quicker</p>
<p>that it is a thought experiment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, who cares if there&rsquo;s batteries</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t run out, right?</p>
<p>Those kinds of questions, that&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nevertheless something I wanted to bring up.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a fair thing to bring up.</p>
<p>For me, you hit on the lone genius thing.</p>
<p>For me, it was actually, people always said,</p>
<p>Ex Machina makes this big leap in terms of where AI</p>
<p>has got to and also what AI would look like</p>
<p>if it got to that point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another one, which is just robotics.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the way Ava walks around a room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, forget it, building that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also got to be a very, very long way off.</p>
<p>And if you did get there, would it look anything like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Actually, I disagree with you.</p>
<p>I think the way, as a ballerina, Alicia Vikander,</p>
<p>brilliant actress, actor that moves around,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very far away from creating that.</p>
<p>But the way she moves around is exactly</p>
<p>the definition of perfection for a roboticist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like smooth and efficient.</p>
<p>So it is where we wanna get, I believe.</p>
<p>I think, so I hang out with a lot</p>
<p>of like human robotics people.</p>
<p>They love elegant, smooth motion like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their dream.</p>
<p>So the way she moved is actually what I believe</p>
<p>that would dream for a robot to move.</p>
<p>It might not be that useful to move that sort of that way,</p>
<p>but that is the definition of perfection</p>
<p>in terms of movement.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from real life.</p>
<p>So for devs, for Ex Machina,</p>
<p>look at characters like Elon Musk.</p>
<p>What do you think about the various big technological</p>
<p>efforts of Elon Musk and others like him</p>
<p>and that he&rsquo;s involved with such as Tesla,</p>
<p>SpaceX, Neuralink, do you see any of that technology</p>
<p>potentially defining the future worlds</p>
<p>you create in your work?</p>
<p>So Tesla&rsquo;s automation, SpaceX&rsquo;s space exploration,</p>
<p>Neuralink is brain machine interface,</p>
<p>somehow merger of biological and electric systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a way I&rsquo;m influenced by that almost by definition</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the world I live in.</p>
<p>And this is the thing that&rsquo;s happening in that world.</p>
<p>And I also feel supportive of it.</p>
<p>So I think amongst various things,</p>
<p>Elon Musk has done, I&rsquo;m almost sure he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>a very, very good thing with Tesla for all of us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really kicked all the other car manufacturers</p>
<p>in the face, it&rsquo;s kicked the fossil fuel industry</p>
<p>in the face and they needed kicking in the face</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s done it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the world he&rsquo;s part of creating</p>
<p>and I live in that world, just bought a Tesla in fact.</p>
<p>And so does that play into whatever I then make</p>
<p>in some ways it does partly because I try to be a writer</p>
<p>who quite often filmmakers are in some ways fixated</p>
<p>on the films they grew up with</p>
<p>and they sort of remake those films in some ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always tried to avoid that.</p>
<p>And so I looked at the real world to get inspiration</p>
<p>and as much as possible sort of by living, I think.</p>
<p>And so yeah, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Which of the directions do you find most exciting?</p>
<p>Space travel.</p>
<p>Space travel.</p>
<p>So you haven&rsquo;t really explored space travel in your work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said something like if you had unlimited amount</p>
<p>of money, I think I read at AMA that you would make</p>
<p>like a multi year series Space Wars or something like that.</p>
<p>So what is it that excites you about space exploration?</p>
<p>Well, because if we have any sort of long term future,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that, it just simply is that.</p>
<p>If energy and matter are linked up in the way</p>
<p>we think they&rsquo;re linked up, we&rsquo;ll run out if we don&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>So we gotta move.</p>
<p>And, but also, how can we not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built into us to do it or die trying.</p>
<p>I was on Easter Island a few months ago,</p>
<p>which is, as I&rsquo;m sure you know, in the middle of the Pacific</p>
<p>and difficult for people to have got to,</p>
<p>but they got there.</p>
<p>And I did think a lot about the way those boats</p>
<p>must have set out into something like space.</p>
<p>It was the ocean and how sort of fundamental</p>
<p>that was to the way we are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the one that most excites me</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the one I want most to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s the place</p>
<p>where we could get to as humans.</p>
<p>Like in a way I could live with us never really unlocking</p>
<p>fully unlocking the nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know, I&rsquo;m really curious,</p>
<p>but if we never leave the solar system</p>
<p>and if we never get further out into this galaxy</p>
<p>or maybe even galaxies beyond our galaxy,</p>
<p>that would, that feels sad to me</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so limiting.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something hopeful and beautiful</p>
<p>about reaching out any kind of exploration,</p>
<p>reaching out across Earth centuries ago</p>
<p>and then reaching out into space.</p>
<p>So what do you think about colonization of Mars?</p>
<p>So go to Mars, does that excite you</p>
<p>the idea of a human being stepping foot on Mars?</p>
<p>It does, it absolutely does.</p>
<p>But in terms of what would really excite me,</p>
<p>it would be leaving the solar system</p>
<p>in as much as that I just think,</p>
<p>I think we already know quite a lot about Mars.</p>
<p>And, but yes, listen, if it happened,</p>
<p>that would be, I hope I see it in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I really hope I see it in my lifetime.</p>
<p>So it would be a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Without giving anything away,</p>
<p>but the series begins with the use of quantum computers.</p>
<p>The new series does,</p>
<p>begins with the use of quantum computers</p>
<p>to simulate basic living organisms,</p>
<p>or actually I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s quantum computers are used,</p>
<p>but basic living organisms are simulated on a screen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really cool kind of demo.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using, yes, they are using a quantum computer</p>
<p>to simulate a nematode, yeah.</p>
<p>So returning to our discussion of simulation,</p>
<p>or thinking of the universe as a computer,</p>
<p>do you think the universe is deterministic?</p>
<p>Is there a free will?</p>
<p>So with the qualification of what do I know?</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m a layman, right?</p>
<p>Lay person.</p>
<p>But with a big imagination.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>With that qualification,</p>
<p>yup, I think the universe is deterministic</p>
<p>and I see absolutely,</p>
<p>I cannot see how free will fits into that.</p>
<p>So yes, deterministic, no free will.</p>
<p>That would be my position.</p>
<p>And how does that make you feel?</p>
<p>It partly makes me feel that it&rsquo;s exactly in keeping</p>
<p>with the way these things tend to work out,</p>
<p>which is that we have an incredibly strong sense</p>
<p>that we do have free will.</p>
<p>And just as we have an incredibly strong sense</p>
<p>that time is a constant,</p>
<p>and turns out probably not to be the case.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re definitely in the case of time,</p>
<p>but the problem I always have with free will</p>
<p>is that it gets,</p>
<p>I can never seem to find the place</p>
<p>where it is supposed to reside.</p>
<p>And yet you explore.</p>
<p>Just a bit of very, very,</p>
<p>but we have something we can call free will,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the thing that we think it is.</p>
<p>But free will, so do you,</p>
<p>what we call free will is just.</p>
<p>What we call it is the illusion of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a subjective experience of the illusion.</p>
<p>Which is a useful thing to have.</p>
<p>And it partly comes down to,</p>
<p>although we live in a deterministic universe,</p>
<p>our brains are not very well equipped</p>
<p>to fully determine the deterministic universe.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re constantly surprised</p>
<p>and feel like we&rsquo;re making snap decisions</p>
<p>based on imperfect information.</p>
<p>So that feels a lot like free will.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Would be my, that&rsquo;s my guess.</p>
<p>So in that sense, your sort of sense</p>
<p>is that you can unroll the universe forward or backward</p>
<p>and you will see the same thing.</p>
<p>And you would, I mean, that notion.</p>
<p>Yeah, sort of, sort of.</p>
<p>But yeah, sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>I mean, that notion is a bit uncomfortable</p>
<p>to think about.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s, you can roll it back.</p>
<p>And forward and.</p>
<p>Well, if you were able to do it,</p>
<p>it would certainly have to be a quantum computer.</p>
<p>Something that worked in a quantum mechanical way</p>
<p>in order to understand a quantum mechanical system, I guess.</p>
<p>And so that unrolling, there might be a multiverse thing</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a bunch of branching.</p>
<p>Well, exactly.</p>
<p>Because it wouldn&rsquo;t follow that every time</p>
<p>you roll it back or forward,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get exactly the same result.</p>
<p>Which is another thing that&rsquo;s hard to wrap your mind around.</p>
<p>So yeah, but that, yes.</p>
<p>But essentially what you just described, that.</p>
<p>The yes forwards and yes backwards,</p>
<p>but you might get a slightly different result</p>
<p>or a very different result.</p>
<p>Or very different.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, you&rsquo;ve explored</p>
<p>some really deep scientific ideas in this new series.</p>
<p>And I mean, just in general,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unafraid to ground yourself</p>
<p>in some of the most amazing scientific ideas of our time.</p>
<p>What are the things you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>or ideas you find beautiful and mysterious</p>
<p>about quantum mechanics, multiverse,</p>
<p>string theory, quantum computing that you&rsquo;ve learned?</p>
<p>Well, I would have to say every single thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned is beautiful.</p>
<p>And one of the motivators for me is that</p>
<p>I think that people tend not to see scientific thinking</p>
<p>as being essentially poetic and lyrical.</p>
<p>But I think that is literally exactly what it is.</p>
<p>And I think the idea of entanglement</p>
<p>or the idea of superpositions,</p>
<p>or the fact that you could even demonstrate a superposition</p>
<p>or have a machine that relies on the existence</p>
<p>of superpositions in order to function,</p>
<p>to me is almost indescribably beautiful.</p>
<p>It fills me with awe.</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s not just a sort of grand, massive awe of,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also delicate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very delicate and subtle.</p>
<p>And it has these beautiful sort of nuances in it.</p>
<p>And also these completely paradigm changing</p>
<p>thoughts and truths.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as good as it gets as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>So broadly everything.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean I believe everything I read</p>
<p>in quantum physics.</p>
<p>Because obviously a lot of the interpretations</p>
<p>are completely in conflict with each other.</p>
<p>And who knows whether string theory</p>
<p>will turn out to be a good description or not.</p>
<p>But the beauty in it, it seems undeniable.</p>
<p>And I do wish people more readily understood</p>
<p>how beautiful and poetic science is, I would say.</p>
<p>Science is poetry.</p>
<p>In terms of quantum computing being used to simulate things</p>
<p>or just in general, the idea of simulating,</p>
<p>simulating small parts of our world,</p>
<p>which actually current physicists are really excited about</p>
<p>simulating small quantum mechanical systems</p>
<p>on quantum computers.</p>
<p>But scaling that up to something bigger,</p>
<p>like simulating life forms.</p>
<p>How do you think, what are the possible trajectories</p>
<p>of that going wrong or going right</p>
<p>if you unroll that into the future?</p>
<p>Well, if a bit like Ava and her robotics,</p>
<p>you park the sheer complexity of what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>The issues are, I think it will have a profound,</p>
<p>if you were able to have a machine</p>
<p>that was able to project forwards and backwards accurately,</p>
<p>it would in an empirical way show,</p>
<p>it would demonstrate that you don&rsquo;t have free will.</p>
<p>So the first thing that would happen is people</p>
<p>would have to really take on a very, very different idea</p>
<p>of what they were.</p>
<p>The thing that they truly, truly believe they are,</p>
<p>they are not.</p>
<p>And so that I suspect would be very, very disturbing</p>
<p>to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Do you think that has a positive or negative effect</p>
<p>on society, the realization that you are not,</p>
<p>you cannot control your actions essentially,</p>
<p>I guess is the way that could be interpreted?</p>
<p>Yeah, although in some ways we instinctively understand</p>
<p>that already because in the example I gave you of the kid</p>
<p>in the stabbing, we would all understand that that kid</p>
<p>was not really fully in control of their actions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an idea that&rsquo;s entirely alien to us, but.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we understand that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a bunch of people who see the world</p>
<p>that way, but not everybody.</p>
<p>Yes, true, of course true.</p>
<p>But what this machine would do is prove it beyond any doubt</p>
<p>because someone would say, well, I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d predict, well, in 10 seconds,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d say, no, no, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;d do it.</p>
<p>And then determinism would have played its part.</p>
<p>But I, or something like that.</p>
<p>But actually the exact terms of that thought experiment</p>
<p>probably wouldn&rsquo;t play out, but still broadly speaking,</p>
<p>you could predict something happening in another room,</p>
<p>sort of unseen, I suppose,</p>
<p>that foreknowledge would not allow you to affect.</p>
<p>So what effect would that have?</p>
<p>I think people would find it very disturbing,</p>
<p>but then after they&rsquo;d got over their sense</p>
<p>of being disturbed, which by the way,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think you need a machine</p>
<p>to take this idea on board.</p>
<p>But after they&rsquo;ve got over that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d still understand that even though I have no free will</p>
<p>and my actions are in effect already determined,</p>
<p>I still feel things.</p>
<p>I still care about stuff.</p>
<p>I remember my daughter saying to me,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d got hold of the idea that my view of the universe</p>
<p>made it meaningless.</p>
<p>And she said, well, then it&rsquo;s meaningless.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I can prove it&rsquo;s not meaningless</p>
<p>because you mean something to me and I mean something to you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not completely meaningless</p>
<p>because there is a bit of meaning contained</p>
<p>within this space.</p>
<p>And so with a lack of free will space,</p>
<p>you could think, well, this robs me of everything I am.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d say, well, no, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because you still like eating cheeseburgers</p>
<p>and you still like going to see the movies.</p>
<p>And so how big a difference does it really make?</p>
<p>But I think initially people would find it very disturbing.</p>
<p>I think that what would come,</p>
<p>if you could really unlock with a determinism machine,</p>
<p>everything, there&rsquo;d be this wonderful wisdom</p>
<p>that would come from it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d rather have that than not.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really good example of a technology</p>
<p>revealing to us humans something fundamental about our world,</p>
<p>about our society.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost this creation</p>
<p>is helping us understand ourselves.</p>
<p>And the same could be said about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>So what do you think us creating something like Ava</p>
<p>will help us understand about ourselves?</p>
<p>How will that change society?</p>
<p>Well, I would hope it would teach us some humility.</p>
<p>Humans are very big on exceptionalism.</p>
<p>America is constantly proclaiming itself</p>
<p>to be the greatest nation on earth,</p>
<p>which it may feel like that if you&rsquo;re an American,</p>
<p>but it may not feel like that if you&rsquo;re from Finland,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all sorts of things</p>
<p>you dearly love about Finland.</p>
<p>And exceptionalism is usually bullshit.</p>
<p>Probably not always.</p>
<p>If we both sat here,</p>
<p>we could find a good example of something that isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but as a rule of thumb.</p>
<p>And what it would do</p>
<p>is it would teach us some humility about,</p>
<p>actually often that&rsquo;s what science does in a funny way.</p>
<p>It makes us more and more interesting,</p>
<p>but it makes us a smaller and smaller part</p>
<p>of the thing that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mind that humility at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>Our excesses don&rsquo;t tend to come from humility.</p>
<p>Our excesses come from the opposite,</p>
<p>megalomania and stuff.</p>
<p>We tend to think of consciousness</p>
<p>as having some form of exceptionalism attached to it.</p>
<p>I suspect if we ever unravel it,</p>
<p>it will turn out to be less than we thought in a way.</p>
<p>And perhaps your very own exceptionalist assertion</p>
<p>earlier on in our conversation</p>
<p>that consciousness is something belongs to us humans,</p>
<p>or not humans, but living organisms,</p>
<p>maybe you will one day find out</p>
<p>that consciousness is in everything.</p>
<p>And that will humble you.</p>
<p>If that was true, it would certainly humble me,</p>
<p>although maybe, almost maybe, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what effect that would have.</p>
<p>My understanding of that principle is along the lines of,</p>
<p>say, that an electron has a preferred state,</p>
<p>or it may or may not pass through a bit of glass.</p>
<p>It may reflect off, or it may go through,</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And so that feels as if a choice has been made.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m going down the fully deterministic route,</p>
<p>I would say there&rsquo;s just an underlying determinism</p>
<p>that has defined that,</p>
<p>that has defined the preferred state,</p>
<p>or the reflection or non reflection.</p>
<p>But look, yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>If it turned out that there was a thing</p>
<p>that it was like to be the sun,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d be amazed and humbled,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be happy to be both, that sounds pretty cool.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll say the same thing as you said to your daughter,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nevertheless feels something like to be me,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s pretty damn good.</p>
<p>So Kubrick created many masterpieces,</p>
<p>including The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange.</p>
<p>But to me, he will be remembered, I think,</p>
<p>to many 100 years from now for 2001 in Space Odyssey.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s his greatest film.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And you are incredibly humble.</p>
<p>I listened to a bunch of your interviews,</p>
<p>and I really appreciate that you&rsquo;re humble</p>
<p>in your creative efforts and your work.</p>
<p>But if I were to force you a gunpoint.</p>
<p>Do you have a gun?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know that, the mystery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to imagine 100 years out into the future.</p>
<p>What will Alex Carlin be remembered for</p>
<p>from something you&rsquo;ve created already,</p>
<p>or feel you may feel somewhere deep inside</p>
<p>you may still create?</p>
<p>Well, okay, well, I&rsquo;ll take the question in the spirit</p>
<p>it was asked, but very generous.</p>
<p>Gunpoint.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What I try to do, so therefore what I hope,</p>
<p>yeah, if I&rsquo;m remembered, what I might be remembered for,</p>
<p>is as someone who participates in a conversation.</p>
<p>And I think that often what happens</p>
<p>is people don&rsquo;t participate in conversations,</p>
<p>they make proclamations, they make statements,</p>
<p>and people can either react against the statement</p>
<p>or can fall in line behind it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>So I want to be part of a conversation.</p>
<p>I take as a sort of basic principle,</p>
<p>I think I take lots of my cues from science,</p>
<p>but one of the best ones, it seems to me,</p>
<p>is that when a scientist has something proved wrong,</p>
<p>that they previously believed in,</p>
<p>they then have to abandon that position.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to be someone who is allied</p>
<p>to that sort of thinking.</p>
<p>So part of an exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>And the exchange of ideas for me is something like,</p>
<p>people in your world, show me things</p>
<p>about how the world works.</p>
<p>And then I say, this is how I feel</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;ve told me.</p>
<p>And then other people can react to that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not to say this is how the world is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to say, it is interesting</p>
<p>to think about the world in this way.</p>
<p>And the conversation is one of the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really hopeful about in your works.</p>
<p>The conversation you&rsquo;re having is with the viewer,</p>
<p>in the sense that you&rsquo;re bringing back</p>
<p>you and several others, but you very much so,</p>
<p>sort of intellectual depth to cinema, to now series,</p>
<p>sort of allowing film to be something that,</p>
<p>yeah, sparks a conversation, is a conversation,</p>
<p>lets people think, allows them to think.</p>
<p>But also, it&rsquo;s very important for me</p>
<p>that if that conversation is gonna be a good conversation,</p>
<p>what that must involve is that someone like you</p>
<p>who understands AI, and I imagine understands a lot</p>
<p>about quantum mechanics, if they then watch the narrative,</p>
<p>feels, yes, this is a fair account.</p>
<p>So it is a worthy addition to the conversation.</p>
<p>That for me is hugely important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in getting that stuff wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only interested in trying to get it right.</p>
<p>Alex, it was truly an honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
