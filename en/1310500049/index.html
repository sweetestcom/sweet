    <p>The following is a conversation with Elon Musk, Part 2, the second time we spoke on the podcast,</p>
<p>with parallels, if not in quality, than an outfit, to the objectively speaking greatest</p>
<p>sequel of all time, Godfather Part 2. As many people know, Elon Musk is a leader of Tesla,</p>
<p>SpaceX, Neuralink, and the Boring Company. What may be less known is that he&rsquo;s a world</p>
<p>class engineer and designer, constantly emphasizing first principles thinking and taking on big</p>
<p>engineering problems that many before him will consider impossible. As scientists and engineers,</p>
<p>most of us don&rsquo;t question the way things are done, we simply follow the momentum of the crowd.</p>
<p>But revolutionary ideas that change the world on the small and large scales happen when you</p>
<p>return to the fundamentals and ask, is there a better way? This conversation focuses on the</p>
<p>incredible engineering and innovation done in brain computer interfaces at Neuralink.</p>
<p>This work promises to help treat neurobiological diseases to help us further understand the</p>
<p>connection between the individual neuron to the high level function of the human brain.</p>
<p>And finally, to one day expand the capacity of the brain through two way communication</p>
<p>with computational devices, the internet, and artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe by YouTube,</p>
<p>Apple Podcasts, Spotify, support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N. And now, as an anonymous YouTube commenter referred to</p>
<p>our previous conversation as the quote, historical first video of two robots conversing without</p>
<p>supervision, here&rsquo;s the second time, the second conversation with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an easy question about consciousness. In your view, is consciousness</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s unique to humans or is it something that permeates all matter, almost like</p>
<p>a fundamental force of physics? I don&rsquo;t think consciousness permeates all matter. Panpsychists</p>
<p>believe that. Yeah. There&rsquo;s a philosophical. How would you tell? That&rsquo;s true. That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>I believe in scientific methods. I don&rsquo;t know about your mind or anything, but the scientific</p>
<p>method is like, if you cannot test the hypothesis, then you cannot reach meaningful conclusion that</p>
<p>it is true. Do you think consciousness, understanding consciousness is within the</p>
<p>reach of science of the scientific method? We can dramatically improve our understanding of</p>
<p>consciousness. You know, hot press to say that we understand anything with complete accuracy,</p>
<p>but can we dramatically improve our understanding of consciousness? I believe the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Does an AI system in your view have to have consciousness in order to achieve human level</p>
<p>or superhuman level intelligence? Does it need to have some of these human qualities that</p>
<p>consciousness, maybe a body, maybe a fear of mortality, capacity to love those kinds of</p>
<p>silly human things? There&rsquo;s a different, you know, there&rsquo;s this, there&rsquo;s the scientific method,</p>
<p>which I very much believe in where something is true to the degree that it is testably. So</p>
<p>and otherwise, you&rsquo;re really just talking about, you know, preferences or untestable beliefs or</p>
<p>that, you know, that kind of thing. So it ends up being somewhat of a semantic question, where</p>
<p>we were conflating a lot of things with the word intelligence. If we parse them out and say,</p>
<p>you know, are we headed towards the future where an AI will be able to outthink us in every way?</p>
<p>Then the answer is unequivocally yes.</p>
<p>In order for an AI system that needs to outthink us in every way, it also needs to have</p>
<p>a capacity to have consciousness, self awareness, and understanding.</p>
<p>It will be self aware. Yes, that&rsquo;s different from consciousness. I mean, to me, in terms of what</p>
<p>what consciousness feels like, it feels like consciousness is in a different dimension.</p>
<p>But this is this could be just an illusion. You know, if you damage your brain in some way,</p>
<p>physically, you get you, you damage your consciousness, which implies that consciousness</p>
<p>is a physical phenomenon. And in my view, the thing is that that I think are really quite,</p>
<p>quite likely is that digital intelligence will be able to outthink us in every way, and it will</p>
<p>simply be able to simulate what we consider consciousness. So to the degree that you would</p>
<p>not be able to tell the difference. And from the from the aspect of the scientific method,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s might as well be consciousness, if we can simulate it perfectly.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t tell the difference, when this is sort of the Turing test, but think of a more</p>
<p>sort of advanced version of the Turing test. If you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re talking to a digital super</p>
<p>intelligence and can&rsquo;t tell if that is a computer or a human, like let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re just having</p>
<p>conversation over a phone or a video conference or something where you&rsquo;re you think you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>looks like a person makes all of the right inflections and movements and all the small</p>
<p>subtleties that constitute a human and talks like human makes mistakes like a human like</p>
<p>and you literally just can&rsquo;t tell is this Are you video conferencing with a person or or an AI</p>
<p>might as well might as well be human. So on a darker topic, you&rsquo;ve expressed serious concern</p>
<p>about existential threats of AI. It&rsquo;s perhaps one of the greatest challenges our civilization faces,</p>
<p>but since I would say we&rsquo;re kind of an optimistic descendants of apes, perhaps we can find several</p>
<p>paths of escaping the harm of AI. So if I can give you an example of an example of an example</p>
<p>of escaping the harm of AI. So if I can give you three options, maybe you can comment which do you</p>
<p>think is the most promising. So one is scaling up efforts on AI safety and beneficial AI research</p>
<p>in hope of finding an algorithmic or maybe a policy solution. Two is becoming a multi planetary</p>
<p>species as quickly as possible. And three is merging with AI and riding the wave of that</p>
<p>increasing intelligence as it continuously improves. What do you think is most promising,</p>
<p>most interesting, as a civilization that we should invest in?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of tremendous amount of investment going on in AI, where there&rsquo;s a lack</p>
<p>of investment is in AI safety. And there should be in my view, a government agency that oversees</p>
<p>anything related to AI to confirm that it is does not represent a public safety risk,</p>
<p>just as there is a regulatory authority for the Food and Drug Administration is that&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>automotive safety, there&rsquo;s the FAA for aircraft safety, which I really come to the conclusion that</p>
<p>it is important to have a government referee or referee that is serving the public interest</p>
<p>in ensuring that things are safe when when there&rsquo;s a potential danger to the public.</p>
<p>I would argue that AI is unequivocally something that has potential to be dangerous to the public,</p>
<p>and therefore should have a regulatory agency just as other things that are dangerous to the public</p>
<p>have a regulatory agency. But let me tell you, the problem with this is that the government</p>
<p>moves very slowly. And the rate of the rate, the usually way a regulatory agency comes into being</p>
<p>is that something terrible happens. There&rsquo;s a huge public outcry. And years after that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a regulatory agency or a rule put in place, take something like, like seatbelts,</p>
<p>it was known for a decade or more that seatbelts would have a massive impact on safety and save so</p>
<p>many lives in serious injuries. And the car industry fought the requirement to put seatbelts in</p>
<p>tooth and nail. That&rsquo;s crazy. Yeah. And hundreds of 1000s of people probably died because of that.</p>
<p>And they said people wouldn&rsquo;t buy cars if they had seatbelts, which is obviously absurd.</p>
<p>Yeah, or look at the tobacco industry and how long they fought any thing about smoking. That&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of why I helped make that movie. Thank you for smoking. You can sort of see just how pernicious</p>
<p>it can be when you have these companies effectively achieve regulatory capture of government. The bad</p>
<p>people in the community refer to the advent of digital super intelligence as a singularity.</p>
<p>That is not to say that it is good or bad, but that it is very difficult to predict what will</p>
<p>happen after that point. And then there&rsquo;s some probability it will be bad, some probably it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be it will be good. We obviously want to affect that probability and have it be more good than bad.</p>
<p>Well, let me on the merger with AI question and the incredible work that&rsquo;s being done at Neuralink.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating innovation here across different disciplines going on. So the flexible</p>
<p>wires, the robotic sewing machine, that responsive brain movement, everything around ensuring safety</p>
<p>and so on. So we currently understand very little about the human brain. Do you also hope that the</p>
<p>work at Neuralink will help us understand more about our about our human brain?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the work in Neuralink will definitely shed a lot of insight into how the brain, the mind</p>
<p>works. Right now, just the data we have regarding how the brain works is very limited. You know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got fMRI, which is that that&rsquo;s kind of like putting us, you know, stethoscope on the outside</p>
<p>of a factory wall and then putting it like all over the factory wall and you can sort of hear</p>
<p>the sounds, but you don&rsquo;t know what the machines are doing, really. It&rsquo;s hard. You can infer a few</p>
<p>things, but it&rsquo;s very broad brushstroke. In order to really know what&rsquo;s going on in the brain,</p>
<p>you really need you have to have high precision sensors. And then you want to have stimulus and</p>
<p>response. Like if you trigger a neuron, what, how do you feel? What do you see? How does it change</p>
<p>your perception of the world? You&rsquo;re speaking to physically just getting close to the brain,</p>
<p>being able to measure signals, how do you know what&rsquo;s going on in the brain?</p>
<p>Physically, just getting close to the brain, being able to measure signals from the brain</p>
<p>will give us sort of open the door inside the factory.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Being able to have high precision sensors that tell you what individual neurons</p>
<p>are doing. And then being able to trigger a neuron and see what the response is in the brain.</p>
<p>So you can see the consequences of if you fire this neuron, what happens? How do you feel? What</p>
<p>does it change? It&rsquo;ll be really profound to have this in people because people can articulate</p>
<p>their change. Like if there&rsquo;s a change in mood, or if they can tell you if they can see better,</p>
<p>or hear better, or be able to form sentences better or worse, or their memories are jogged,</p>
<p>or that kind of thing. So on the human side, there&rsquo;s this incredible general malleability,</p>
<p>plasticity of the human brain, the human brain adapts, adjusts, and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not that plastic, to be totally frank.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a firm structure, but nevertheless, there&rsquo;s some plasticity. And the open question is,</p>
<p>sort of, if I could ask a broad question is how much that plasticity can be utilized. Sort of,</p>
<p>on the human side, there&rsquo;s some plasticity in the human brain. And on the machine side,</p>
<p>we have neural networks, machine learning, artificial intelligence, it&rsquo;s able to adjust</p>
<p>and figure out signals. So there&rsquo;s a mysterious language that we don&rsquo;t perfectly understand</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s within the human brain. And then we&rsquo;re trying to understand that language to communicate</p>
<p>both directions. So the brain is adjusting a little bit, we don&rsquo;t know how much, and the</p>
<p>machine is adjusting. Where do you see, as they try to sort of reach together, almost like with</p>
<p>an alien species, try to find a protocol, communication protocol that works? Where do</p>
<p>you see the biggest, the biggest benefit arriving from on the machine side or the human side? Do you</p>
<p>see both of them working together? I think the machine side is far more malleable than the</p>
<p>biological side, by a huge amount. So it&rsquo;ll be the machine that adapts to the brain. That&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s possible. The brain can&rsquo;t adapt that well to the machine. You can&rsquo;t have neurons start</p>
<p>to regard an electrode as another neuron, because neurons just, there&rsquo;s like the pulse. And so</p>
<p>something else is pulsing. So there is that elasticity in the interface, which we believe is</p>
<p>something that can happen. But the vast majority of the malleability will have to be on the machine</p>
<p>side. But it&rsquo;s interesting, when you look at that synaptic plasticity at the interface side,</p>
<p>there might be like an emergent plasticity. Because it&rsquo;s a whole nother, it&rsquo;s not like in the</p>
<p>brain, it&rsquo;s a whole nother extension of the brain. You know, we might have to redefine what it means</p>
<p>to be malleable for the brain. So maybe the brain is able to adjust to external interfaces. There</p>
<p>will be some adjustments to the brain, because there&rsquo;s going to be something reading and simulating</p>
<p>the brain. And so it will adjust to that thing. But most, the vast majority of the adjustment</p>
<p>will be on the machine side. This is just, this is just, it has to be that otherwise it will not</p>
<p>work. Ultimately, like, we currently operate on two layers, we have sort of a limbic, like prime</p>
<p>primitive brain layer, which is where all of our kind of impulses are coming from. It&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve got, we&rsquo;ve got like a monkey brain with a computer stuck on it. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>human brain. And a lot of our impulses and everything are driven by the monkey brain.</p>
<p>And the computer, the cortex is constantly trying to make the monkey brain happy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the cortex that&rsquo;s steering the monkey brains, the monkey brain steering the cortex.</p>
<p>You know, the cortex is the part that tells the story of the whole thing. So we convince ourselves</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s more interesting than just the monkey brain. The cortex is like what we call like human</p>
<p>intelligence. You know, it&rsquo;s just like, that&rsquo;s like the advanced computer relative to other</p>
<p>creatures. The other creatures do not have either. Really, they don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>computer, or they have a very weak computer relative to humans. But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like, it sort</p>
<p>of seems like surely the really smart thing should control the dumb thing. But actually,</p>
<p>the dumb thing controls the smart thing. So do you think some of the same kind of machine learning</p>
<p>methods, whether that&rsquo;s natural language processing applications are going to be applied for the</p>
<p>communication between the machine and the brain to learn how to do certain things like movement</p>
<p>of the body, how to process visual stimuli, and so on. Do you see the value of using machine</p>
<p>learning to understand the language of the two way communication with the brain? Sure. Yeah,</p>
<p>absolutely. I mean, we&rsquo;re neural net. And that, you know, AI is basically neural net.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like digital neural net will interface with biological neural net.</p>
<p>And hopefully bring us along for the ride. Yeah. But the vast majority of our intelligence will be</p>
<p>digital. Like, so like, think of like, the difference in intelligence between your cortex</p>
<p>and your limbic system is gigantic, your limbic system really has no comprehension of what the</p>
<p>hell the cortex is doing. It&rsquo;s just literally hungry, you know, or tired or angry or sexy or</p>
<p>something, you know, that&rsquo;s just and then that communicates that that impulse to the cortex and</p>
<p>tells the cortex to go satisfy that then love a great deal of like, a massive amount of thinking,</p>
<p>like truly stupendous amount of thinking has gone into sex without purpose, without procreation,</p>
<p>without procreation. Which is actually quite a silly action in the absence of procreation. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bit silly. Why are you doing it? Because it makes the limbic system happy. That&rsquo;s why. That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pretty absurd, really. Well, the whole of existence is pretty absurd in some kind of sense.</p>
<p>Yeah. But I mean, this is a lot of computation has gone into how can I do more of that with</p>
<p>procreation not even being a factor? This is, I think, a very important area of research by NSFW.</p>
<p>An agency that should receive a lot of funding, especially after this conversation.</p>
<p>I propose the formation of a new agency. Oh, boy.</p>
<p>What is the most exciting or some of the most exciting things that you see in the future impact</p>
<p>of Neuralink, both in the science, the engineering and societal broad impact?</p>
<p>Neuralink, I think, at first will solve a lot of brain related diseases. So it could be anything</p>
<p>from like autism, schizophrenia, memory loss, like everyone experiences memory loss at certain points</p>
<p>in age. Parents can&rsquo;t remember their kids names and that kind of thing. So it could be anything</p>
<p>from like autism, schizophrenia, memory loss, like everyone experiences memory loss at certain points</p>
<p>in age. Parents can&rsquo;t remember their kids names and that kind of thing. So there&rsquo;s a tremendous</p>
<p>amount of good that Neuralink can do in solving critical damage to the brain or the spinal cord.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that can be done to improve quality of life of individuals. And those will be steps</p>
<p>to address the existential risk associated with digital superintelligence. Like we will not be</p>
<p>able to be smarter than a digital supercomputer. So therefore, if you cannot beat them, join them.</p>
<p>And at least we won&rsquo;t have that option.</p>
<p>So you have hope that Neuralink will be able to be a kind of connection to allow us to merge,</p>
<p>the wave of the improving AI systems. I think the chance is above zero percent.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s non zero. There&rsquo;s a chance. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve seen. Dumb and Dumber.</p>
<p>Yes. So I&rsquo;m saying there&rsquo;s a chance. He&rsquo;s saying one in a billion or one in a million,</p>
<p>whatever it was, a dumb and dumber. You know, it went from maybe one in a million to improving.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll be one in a thousand and then one in a hundred, then one in ten. Depends on the rate</p>
<p>of improvement of Neuralink and how fast we&rsquo;re able to do make progress.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve talked to a few folks here that are quite brilliant engineers, so I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s like fundamentally good, you know,</p>
<p>giving somebody back full motor control after they&rsquo;ve had a spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>You know, restoring brain functionality after a stroke,</p>
<p>solving debilitating genetically oriented brain diseases. These are all incredibly</p>
<p>great, I think. And in order to do these, you have to be able to interface with neurons at</p>
<p>a detailed level and you need to be able to fire the right neurons, read the right neurons, and</p>
<p>and then effectively you can create a circuit, replace what&rsquo;s broken with</p>
<p>with silicon and essentially fill in the missing functionality. And then over time,</p>
<p>we can develop a tertiary layer. So if like the limbic system is the primary layer, then the</p>
<p>cortex is like the second layer. And as I said, obviously the cortex is vastly more intelligent</p>
<p>than the limbic system, but people generally like the fact that they have a limbic system</p>
<p>and a cortex. I haven&rsquo;t met anyone who wants to delete either one of them. They&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ll keep them both. That&rsquo;s cool. The limbic system is kind of fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the fun is, absolutely. And then people generally don&rsquo;t want to lose their</p>
<p>cortex either. They&rsquo;re like having the cortex and the limbic system. And then there&rsquo;s a tertiary</p>
<p>layer, which will be digital superintelligence. And I think there&rsquo;s room for optimism given that</p>
<p>the cortex, the cortex is very intelligent and limbic system is not, and yet they work together</p>
<p>well. Perhaps there can be a tertiary layer where digital superintelligence lies, and that will be</p>
<p>vastly more intelligent than the cortex, but still coexist peacefully and in a benign manner with the</p>
<p>cortex and limbic system. That&rsquo;s a super exciting future, both in low level engineering that I saw</p>
<p>as being done here and the actual possibility in the next few decades. It&rsquo;s important that</p>
<p>Neuralink solve this problem sooner rather than later, because the point at which we have digital</p>
<p>superintelligence, that&rsquo;s when we pass the singularity and things become just very uncertain.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re necessarily bad or good. For the point at which we pass singularity,</p>
<p>things become extremely unstable. So we want to have a human brain interface before the singularity,</p>
<p>or at least not long after it, to minimize existential risk for humanity and consciousness</p>
<p>as we know it. So there&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating actual engineering, low level problems here at</p>
<p>Neuralink that are quite exciting. The problems that we face in Neuralink are material science,</p>
<p>electrical engineering, software, mechanical engineering, microfabrication. It&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>engineering disciplines, essentially. That&rsquo;s what it comes down to, is you have to have a</p>
<p>tiny electrode, so small it doesn&rsquo;t hurt neurons, but it&rsquo;s got to last for as long as a person. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to last for decades. And then you&rsquo;ve got to take that signal, you&rsquo;ve got to process</p>
<p>that signal locally at low power. So we need a lot of chip design engineers, because we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do signal processing, and do so in a very power efficient way, so that we don&rsquo;t heat your brain</p>
<p>up, because the brain is very heat sensitive. And then we&rsquo;ve got to take those signals and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to do something with them. And then we&rsquo;ve got to stimulate the back to bidirectional</p>
<p>communication. So somebody&rsquo;s good at material science, software, and we&rsquo;ve got to do a lot of</p>
<p>that. So somebody&rsquo;s good at material science, software, mechanical engineering, electrical</p>
<p>engineering, chip design, microfabrication. Those are the things we need to work on.</p>
<p>We need to be good at material science, so that we can have tiny electrodes that last a long time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a tough thing with the material science problem, it&rsquo;s a tough one, because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to read and simulate electrically in an electrically active area. Your brain is</p>
<p>very electrically active and electrochemically active. So how do you have a coating on the</p>
<p>electrode that doesn&rsquo;t dissolve over time and is safe in the brain? This is a very hard problem.</p>
<p>And then how do you collect those signals in a way that is most efficient? Because you really</p>
<p>just have very tiny amounts of power to process those signals. And then we need to automate the</p>
<p>whole thing so it&rsquo;s like LASIK. If this is done by neurosurgeons, there&rsquo;s no way it can scale to</p>
<p>a large number of people. And it needs to scale to a large number of people, because I think</p>
<p>ultimately we want the future to be determined by a large number of humans. Do you think that</p>
<p>this has a chance to revolutionize surgery period? So neurosurgery and surgery all across?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. It&rsquo;s got to be like LASIK. If LASIK had to be done by hand by a person,</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t be great. It&rsquo;s done by a robot. And the ophthalmologist kind of just needs to make</p>
<p>sure your head&rsquo;s in the right position, and then they just press a button and go.</p>
<p>SmartSummon and soon Autopark takes on the full beautiful mess of parking lots and their human</p>
<p>to human nonverbal communication. I think it has actually the potential to have a profound impact</p>
<p>in changing how our civilization looks at AI and robotics, because this is the first time human</p>
<p>beings, people that don&rsquo;t own a Tesla may have never seen a Tesla or heard about a Tesla,</p>
<p>get to watch hundreds of thousands of cars without a driver. Do you see it this way, almost like an</p>
<p>education tool for the world about AI? Do you feel the burden of that, the excitement of that,</p>
<p>or do you just think it&rsquo;s a smart parking feature? I do think you are getting at something</p>
<p>important, which is most people have never really seen a robot. And what is the car that is</p>
<p>autonomous? It&rsquo;s a four wheeled robot. Yeah, it communicates a certain sort of message with</p>
<p>everything from safety to the possibility of what AI could bring to its current limitations,</p>
<p>its current challenges, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s possible. Do you feel the burden of that almost like a</p>
<p>communicator educator to the world about AI? We were just really trying to make people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lives easier with autonomy. But now that you mentioned it, I think it will be an eye opener</p>
<p>to people about robotics, because they&rsquo;ve really never seen most people never seen a robot. And</p>
<p>there are hundreds of thousands of Tesla&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t be long before there&rsquo;s a million of them that</p>
<p>have autonomous capability, and the drive without a person in it. And you can see the kind of</p>
<p>evolution of the car&rsquo;s personality and, and thinking with each iteration of autopilot,</p>
<p>you can see it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s uncertain about this, or it gets it, but now it&rsquo;s more certain. Now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>moving in a slightly different way. Like, I can tell immediately if a car is on Tesla autopilot,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got just little nuances of movement, it just moves in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>Cars on Tesla autopilot, for example, on the highway are far more precise about being in the</p>
<p>center of the lane than a person. If you drive down the highway and look at how at where cars</p>
<p>are, the human driven cars are within their lane, they&rsquo;re like bumper cars. They&rsquo;re like moving all</p>
<p>over the place. The car in autopilot, dead center. Yeah, so the incredible work that&rsquo;s going into</p>
<p>that neural network, it&rsquo;s learning fast. Autonomy is still very, very hard. We don&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>how hard it is fully, of course. You look at the most problems you tackle, this one included,</p>
<p>with an exponential lens, but even with an exponential improvement, things can take longer</p>
<p>than expected sometimes. So where does Tesla currently stand on its quest for full autonomy?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense? When can we see successful deployment of full autonomy?</p>
<p>Well, on the highway already, the the probability of intervention is extremely low.</p>
<p>Yes. So for highway autonomy, with the latest release, especially the probability of needing</p>
<p>to intervene is really quite low. In fact, I&rsquo;d say for stop and go traffic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s far safer than a person right now. The probability of an injury or impact is much,</p>
<p>much lower for autopilot than a person. And then with navigating autopilot, you can change lanes,</p>
<p>take highway interchanges, and then we&rsquo;re coming at it from the other direction, which is low speed,</p>
<p>full autonomy. And in a way, this is like, how does a person learn to drive? You learn to drive</p>
<p>in the parking lot. You know, the first time you learn to drive probably wasn&rsquo;t jumping on</p>
<p>August Street in San Francisco. That&rsquo;d be crazy. You learn to drive in the parking lot, get things</p>
<p>get things right at low speed. And then the missing piece that we&rsquo;re working on is traffic</p>
<p>lights and stop streets. Stop streets, I would say actually also relatively easy, because, you know,</p>
<p>you kind of know where the stop street is, worst case in geocoders, and then use visualization to</p>
<p>see where the line is and stop at the line to eliminate the GPS error. So actually, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably complex traffic lights and very windy roads are the two things that need to get solved.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s harder, perception or control for these problems? So being able to perfectly perceive</p>
<p>everything, or figuring out a plan once you perceive everything, how to interact with all the</p>
<p>agents in the environment in your sense, from a learning perspective, is perception or action</p>
<p>harder? And that giant, beautiful multitask learning neural network, the hottest thing is</p>
<p>having accurate representation of the physical objects in vector space. So transfer taking the</p>
<p>visual input, primarily visual input, some sonar and radar, and and then creating the an accurate</p>
<p>vector space representation of the objects around you. Once you have an accurate vector space</p>
<p>representation, the planning and control is relatively easier. That is relatively easy.</p>
<p>Basically, once you have accurate vector space representation, then you&rsquo;re kind of like a video</p>
<p>game, like cars and like Grand Theft Auto or something like they work pretty well. They drive</p>
<p>down the road, they don&rsquo;t crash, you know, pretty much unless you crash into them. That&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve got an accurate vector space representation of where the cars are, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just and then they&rsquo;re rendering that as the as the output. Do you have a sense, high level, that</p>
<p>Tesla&rsquo;s on track on being able to achieve full autonomy? So on the highway? Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And still no driver state, driver sensing? And we have driver sensing with torque on the wheel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Yeah. By the way, just a quick comment on karaoke. Most people think it&rsquo;s fun,</p>
<p>but I also think it is a driving feature. I&rsquo;ve been saying for a long time, singing in the car</p>
<p>is really good for attention management and vigilance management. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Tesla karaoke is great. It&rsquo;s one of the most fun features of the car. Do you think of a connection</p>
<p>between fun and safety sometimes? Yeah, you can do both at the same time. That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I just met with Andrew and wife of Carl Sagan, directed Cosmos. I&rsquo;m generally a big fan of Carl</p>
<p>Sagan. He&rsquo;s super cool. And had a great way of putting things. All of our consciousness,</p>
<p>all civilization, everything we&rsquo;ve ever known and done is on this tiny blue dot.</p>
<p>People also get they get too trapped in there. This is like squabbles amongst humans.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not think of the big picture. They take civilization and our continued existence for</p>
<p>granted. I shouldn&rsquo;t do that. Look at the history of civilizations. They rise and they fall. And now</p>
<p>civilization is all it&rsquo;s globalized. And so civilization, I think now rises and falls together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s not geographic isolation. This is a big risk. Things don&rsquo;t always go up. That</p>
<p>should be that&rsquo;s an important lesson of history. In 1990, at the request of Carl Sagan, the Voyager</p>
<p>One spacecraft, which is a spacecraft that&rsquo;s reaching out farther than anything human made</p>
<p>into space, turned around to take a picture of Earth from 3.6 billion years ago. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a picture of Earth from 3.7 billion miles away. And as you&rsquo;re talking about the pale blue dot,</p>
<p>that picture there takes up less than a single pixel in that image. Yes. Appearing as a tiny</p>
<p>blue dot, as a pale blue dot, as Carl Sagan called it. So he spoke about this dot of ours in 1994.</p>
<p>And if you could humor me, I was wondering if in the last two minutes you could read the words</p>
<p>that he wrote describing this pale blue dot. Sure. Yes, it&rsquo;s funny. The universe appears to be 13.8</p>
<p>billion years old. Earth is like four and a half billion years old.</p>
<p>In another half billion years or so, the sun will expand and probably evaporate the oceans and make</p>
<p>life impossible on Earth, which means that if it had taken consciousness 10% longer to evolve,</p>
<p>it would never have evolved at all. It&rsquo;s 10% longer. And I wonder how many dead one planet</p>
<p>civilizations there are out there in the cosmos.</p>
<p>That never made it to the other planet and ultimately extinguished themselves or were destroyed</p>
<p>by external factors. Probably a few. It&rsquo;s only just possible to travel to Mars. Just barely.</p>
<p>If G was 10% more, it wouldn&rsquo;t work really.</p>
<p>If G was 10% lower, it would be easy. Like you can go single stage from the surface of Mars all the</p>
<p>way to the surface of the Earth. Because Mars is 37% Earth&rsquo;s gravity. We need a giant booster</p>
<p>to get off the Earth. Channeling Carl Sagan. Look again at that dot. That&rsquo;s here. That&rsquo;s home. That&rsquo;s us.</p>
<p>On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you&rsquo;ve ever heard of, every human being</p>
<p>who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident</p>
<p>religions, ideologies and economic doctrines. Every hunter and farger, every hero and coward,</p>
<p>every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love,</p>
<p>every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every</p>
<p>corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of</p>
<p>our species lived there on a mode of dust suspended in a sunbeam. Our planet is a lonely speck in the</p>
<p>great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help</p>
<p>will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor</p>
<p>life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. This</p>
<p>is not true. This is false. Mars. And I think Carl Sagan would agree with that. He couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>imagine it at that time. So thank you for making the world dream. And thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
