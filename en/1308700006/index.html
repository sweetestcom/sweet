    <p>Our cards this week are Rebecca Harvey and Stephen Hendricks, the Queen of Clubs, and</p>
<p>the Eight of Hearts from Indiana.</p>
<p>In this episode, I&rsquo;m going to tell you everything our reporting team could find out about Rebecca&rsquo;s</p>
<p>horrific death in 1988, and how it&rsquo;s connected to Stephen, who is still missing today.</p>
<p>For years, there hasn&rsquo;t been much out there on Rebecca&rsquo;s murder or Stephen&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because their case is a lesser-known unsolved mystery from right here in my home</p>
<p>state of Indiana.</p>
<p>But our team went right to the lead investigator on the case to learn more.</p>
<p>More than 30 years later, the case continues to baffle law enforcement and everyone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>asking the question, what really happened to Rebecca Harvey and Stephen Hendricks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>September 3rd, 1988 had been a busy day for Jackie and Carol Arnold.</p>
<p>The couple had taken a road trip to and from the Indianapolis airport that afternoon to</p>
<p>pick up a family member.</p>
<p>That trip is about a two-hour drive southwest to their home in Washington, Indiana, which</p>
<p>is this small town in Davies County.</p>
<p>When they got to their house that evening on Oak Grove Road, nothing out of the ordinary</p>
<p>was going on.</p>
<p>The Arnolds lived on the outskirts of their small town and a typical night there was quiet.</p>
<p>They went to bed and like every other night before, didn&rsquo;t hear a thing stir.</p>
<p>That is until around three in the morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Mr. Arnold woke up to something extremely unusual for the neighborhood, a</p>
<p>strong smell of smoke.</p>
<p>The smoke wasn&rsquo;t in their house, it was coming from outside.</p>
<p>So he peeked out a window and that&rsquo;s when he saw it.</p>
<p>The neighbor&rsquo;s house was on fire.</p>
<p>Almost the entire structure was engulfed in flames, to the point that there were flames</p>
<p>shooting out from every direction, the roof, the windows, everywhere.</p>
<p>Without even thinking, Mr. Arnold grabbed the phone and dialed the local fire department.</p>
<p>In a matter of minutes, several volunteer firefighters responded to the scene.</p>
<p>Some of them even drove up in their personal cars.</p>
<p>They started fighting the blaze on the outside and called for more backup.</p>
<p>As the firefighters quickly worked to knock down the flames, the Arnolds were left to</p>
<p>helplessly look on from next door, terrified.</p>
<p>With each piece of the house that collapsed, they worried that the young couple who lived</p>
<p>inside hadn&rsquo;t made it out.</p>
<p>Jackie and Carol knew that the vehicle parked out front belonged to a young man who lived</p>
<p>there with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>They hoped the couple maybe stayed out late or were just out of town, but their hopes</p>
<p>were dashed when not long after the firefighters tamed the blaze, a coroner&rsquo;s van pulled</p>
<p>up to the burned house.</p>
<p>According to Indiana police records, when the firefighters made their way through the</p>
<p>small house, they hollered for anyone alive inside to come out, but no one responded.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;d reached a bedroom, they found the burned remains of a single human body</p>
<p>on what was left of a bed.</p>
<p>Now it was clear just from looking at it that the remains were those of a person, but because</p>
<p>they had been burned so badly, no one could tell right away whether the body was that</p>
<p>of a woman or a man.</p>
<p>Witnesses stated it appeared from burn patterns in the room that the person had been lying</p>
<p>on top of the bed and likely never moved, even as the house caught on fire, almost as</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;d been asleep the whole time and didn&rsquo;t even know that the house had started</p>
<p>to burn.</p>
<p>Before removing anything, the Davies County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department and Indiana State Police</p>
<p>arrived and quickly secured the scene and started investigating.</p>
<p>The first thing they needed to do was ID the body, but that would take a few days for the</p>
<p>coroner to confirm, so in the meantime, detectives started talking with the neighbors.</p>
<p>They wanted to get a better idea of who lived in the house, and that&rsquo;s where the Arnolds</p>
<p>became helpful.</p>
<p>The couple told detectives that a 22-year-old man named Stephen Hendricks had been renting</p>
<p>the house, and just a week before the fire, his girlfriend, a woman named Rebecca Harvey,</p>
<p>had moved in.</p>
<p>They confirmed for investigators that it was Stephen&rsquo;s car that was parked out front</p>
<p>of the scorched house, and the Arnolds said they&rsquo;d seen Stephen and Rebecca coming and</p>
<p>going regularly, but never spent much time with them.</p>
<p>They described Rebecca as being several years younger than Stephen, and said overall the</p>
<p>couple was nice, at least from the limited interactions they&rsquo;d had.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the night of the fire, the Arnolds told police they didn&rsquo;t see much</p>
<p>action happening at Stephen&rsquo;s house in between the time when they&rsquo;d gotten home from the</p>
<p>airport and before they went to bed.</p>
<p>But what little info the Arnolds did give investigators set detectives off on a good</p>
<p>start.</p>
<p>They eventually learned that Stephen worked as a local mechanic in town, and 18-year-old</p>
<p>Rebecca had recently dropped out of high school to live with him.</p>
<p>With this information in hand, authorities had to wait for the coroner&rsquo;s office to</p>
<p>identify who the body in the house belonged to.</p>
<p>Was it Stephen?</p>
<p>Or Rebecca?</p>
<p>Or someone else?</p>
<p>Eventually, law enforcement got medical records and dental impressions for Stephen and Rebecca,</p>
<p>and those were compared to the burned remains.</p>
<p>The results confirmed that the body belonged to Rebecca.</p>
<p>The reason police were so focused on finding out who the victim was, was because initial</p>
<p>autopsy and evidence findings indicated that she had been intentionally set on fire.</p>
<p>Traces of gasoline were found inside the house, particularly in the bedroom.</p>
<p>That detail told investigators all they needed to know.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t just dealing with an accidental fire, they were dealing with murder.</p>
<p>Now, the two glaring questions they needed to answer were, who did it?</p>
<p>And most importantly, where was Stephen Hendricks?</p>
<p>As authorities picked and shuffled through the charred remains of Stephen&rsquo;s rental</p>
<p>house on Oak Grove Road, they started finding more clues, and one thing became very clear.</p>
<p>The fire that eventually engulfed the whole structure had started in the bedroom where</p>
<p>Rebecca&rsquo;s body had been found.</p>
<p>Fire marshals found high concentrations of gasoline residue splashed all around the room.</p>
<p>According to police records, the county coroner who conducted Rebecca&rsquo;s autopsy wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>able to determine if she died before the fire started.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not super clear because investigators won&rsquo;t release the full autopsy report, but</p>
<p>I guess there wasn&rsquo;t enough of Rebecca&rsquo;s lungs left for the coroner to determine if</p>
<p>she inhaled any smoke before dying, or if she was already dead before the fire started.</p>
<p>Our reporter Emily interviewed Indiana State Police Sergeant Brock Wernie, who said that</p>
<p>he and the other investigators who have worked on this case over the years have always contemplated</p>
<p>the terrible thought that maybe Rebecca burned alive because she was restrained or incapacitated</p>
<p>somehow on the bed.</p>
<p>But Sergeant Wernie is actually one of a handful of investigators who doesn&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>though.</p>
<p>Wernie claims Rebecca was killed prior to the fire starting.</p>
<p>He says the position of her remains indicated she was lying on the bed motionless when she</p>
<p>was set on fire.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say she was alive.</p>
<p>She could have been.</p>
<p>This is just an assumption.</p>
<p>I would say she was dead.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just based off if the house is on fire and she&rsquo;s alive and she can get out,</p>
<p>she probably would have got out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying I don&rsquo;t think a suspect would hold somebody down until they burnt, you know what</p>
<p>I mean?</p>
<p>They would also be burnt.</p>
<p>So my assumption is that she was dead before the fire started.</p>
<p>Our team did find some rumors out there online that suggest Rebecca might have been tied</p>
<p>to the bed while she was being burned.</p>
<p>But Sergeant Wernie said this isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t really share more from his case file about that.</p>
<p>But all he said was it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>So the rumors about her being tied to the bed are false?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see anything about her and her court being tied to the bed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whether or not Rebecca was alive or dead before being set on fire is</p>
<p>just not something anyone but her killer can know.</p>
<p>All police were sure of at the time was that Rebecca&rsquo;s death was no accident.</p>
<p>Naturally, their next move was to figure out where Steven was.</p>
<p>Firefighters found no trace of him in the house, but his car was left parked out front,</p>
<p>his personal belongings like his wallet and keys were ultimately found in the house.</p>
<p>That told investigators he either walked away from the crime scene, or he got a ride, or</p>
<p>he was never there at all.</p>
<p>But just the fact that Steven was Rebecca&rsquo;s boyfriend and the only other person known</p>
<p>to live in the house made him authorities&rsquo; prime suspect.</p>
<p>Police wondered if there was anything in the couple&rsquo;s history or relationship that could</p>
<p>have led him to kill her and flee.</p>
<p>Sometimes people say they were a happy couple, I guess, and then there&rsquo;s some that say that</p>
<p>they were on and off.</p>
<p>One time they&rsquo;d be happy and one time they would be yelling at each other.</p>
<p>The problem was, everyone detectives spoke with, friends, family, the Arnolds, they all</p>
<p>said that Steven and Rebecca really seemed to love one another.</p>
<p>In fact, they weren&rsquo;t even just girlfriend and boyfriend, they were engaged.</p>
<p>It was kind of low-key, but together they had been working hard to save up for their</p>
<p>wedding.</p>
<p>Steven worked on cars at a place in Washington called Craney&rsquo;s Body Shop, which is still</p>
<p>in business today.</p>
<p>And Rebecca worked as a waitress at a local restaurant called Patsy&rsquo;s Pizza.</p>
<p>Some of her friends told police back in 1988 that she&rsquo;d even contemplated going back to</p>
<p>high school to finish her senior year and get her diploma.</p>
<p>And the Arnolds told police that on several occasions they&rsquo;d gotten the impression from</p>
<p>Steven that he really encouraged Rebecca to go back and graduate.</p>
<p>Emily tried to contact several of Rebecca&rsquo;s old classmates and friends about their relationship,</p>
<p>and even just to learn more about Rebecca in general, but no one responded.</p>
<p>Records indicate that her parents died years ago, and little else is known about her, other</p>
<p>than what I&rsquo;ve told you.</p>
<p>In 88, police knew just as much info, and so they were left asking the question, if</p>
<p>Steven and Rebecca had a wedding date on the horizon and a happy future ahead of them,</p>
<p>then why would he kill her?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question that investigators have never been able to find the answer to, because</p>
<p>they have never been able to find Steven.</p>
<p>Today, he&rsquo;s listed as a missing person.</p>
<p>Investigators back in 1988 interviewed his boss at the auto body shop in Washington right</p>
<p>after the fire, and that guy told the cops that it was truly bizarre Steven never showed</p>
<p>up to work again after the incident.</p>
<p>He was one of the best employees Craney&rsquo;s Body Shop had at the time.</p>
<p>He was a very good worker, I know that for them.</p>
<p>They did report that in here, because I think Mr. Craney at one time, when he hired him</p>
<p>or they went and interviewed him, said he was a good worker.</p>
<p>Mr. Craney told police that Steven not returning to work was odd, because he&rsquo;d left thousands</p>
<p>of dollars worth of personal mechanics tools inside the shop.</p>
<p>For a long time, news publications that have covered this case reported conflicting information</p>
<p>about whether or not Steven collected his paycheck from his work before the fire.</p>
<p>Some news reporters from that time said that Steven did not pick up his last paycheck.</p>
<p>But Sergeant Wernie took a fresh look at the investigative reports specifically for this</p>
<p>show and he said that Steven did in fact pick up his paycheck and cashed it at the</p>
<p>local IGA the afternoon before the fire.</p>
<p>So you could assume if Steven was planning to murder Rebecca and take off and start a</p>
<p>new life that he might have used that paycheck to get a head start.</p>
<p>But then why wouldn&rsquo;t he take his valuable mechanics tools with him that he could, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, sell or pawn off to help with his getaway?</p>
<p>And why would he leave his wallet behind?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>The last known sighting of Steven was after he cashed his paycheck, just a few hours before</p>
<p>the Arnolds woke up to see his house on fire.</p>
<p>A friend of his was at the Oak Grove Road house with Steven late in the afternoon on</p>
<p>September 3rd.</p>
<p>Police interviewed that friend not long after the crime, and he told investigators that</p>
<p>Steven was helping him work on his truck, which had overheated earlier that day.</p>
<p>The guy told police that everything seemed normal with Steven when he was there, and</p>
<p>that Rebecca was gone at the time working at Potsy&rsquo;s Pizza.</p>
<p>No one has heard from or seen Steven Hendricks since that moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hardest part of this case is he hasn&rsquo;t been located.</p>
<p>So is he somebody that was involved or is it somebody else involved that took him somewhere</p>
<p>else?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the unknown right now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the biggest question they had back then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably still the biggest question we have today is where he&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>Never having a solid lead on where their prime suspect went, and no forensic evidence</p>
<p>to push Rebecca&rsquo;s murder case forward, caused the investigation to grind to a halt.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much unknowns, I think, in this case.</p>
<p>So some people out there make assumptions to the case and don&rsquo;t know the facts and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how the rumors start going around, you know, especially since Steven&rsquo;s missing, Hendricks.</p>
<p>So with him missing and never being found, there&rsquo;s a lot of scenarios that could have</p>
<p>took place, you know, that sends people into starting rumors.</p>
<p>A bizarre theory that was floated on social media a few years back indicated Steven was</p>
<p>killed the same night as Rebecca and his body was dumped in Oak Grove Cemetery, not far</p>
<p>from the original crime scene.</p>
<p>Police took this tip so seriously that they taped off the cemetery and started to dig.</p>
<p>Somebody I believed a body to be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember whose body, if it was Hendricks or somebody else&rsquo;s, but we just looked into</p>
<p>that area and nothing was located.</p>
<p>The number of semi-credible tips dwindled as the case got older and colder.</p>
<p>Police struggled to get to the bottom of who killed Rebecca and where Steven was.</p>
<p>Cold case investigators turned to re-examining Steven&rsquo;s life more closely, hoping it would</p>
<p>reveal more clues.</p>
<p>Learning more about Rebecca and Steven&rsquo;s past was essential for us to put this episode together.</p>
<p>Law enforcement is limited to what detectives working on the case now can say on the record,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why we hired the team to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Emily interviewed Steven Hendricks&rsquo; younger sister, a woman named Felicia, to learn more</p>
<p>about him and his past, both before and while he was dating Rebecca.</p>
<p>Felicia didn&rsquo;t want to be recorded, but she says for years she felt something terrible</p>
<p>happened to her older brother the night Rebecca was murdered.</p>
<p>Felicia says Steven was funny, caring, and protective of her and anyone else he loved,</p>
<p>including Rebecca.</p>
<p>He enjoyed riding motorcycles, fixing cars, and getting together with family when he could.</p>
<p>Growing up, Felicia and Steven were tight and on a weekly basis either went to dinner</p>
<p>or the movies and sometimes went on camping trips.</p>
<p>Felicia says that three days before the fire, she met Rebecca over the phone.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d been chatting with her brother and said it was great to hear about how happy</p>
<p>and excited he was to get married.</p>
<p>Felicia says Rebecca sounded like a really sweet girl and she wishes she could have met</p>
<p>her future sister-in-law in person.</p>
<p>But for all his good qualities and bright future, Steven did have his share of trouble,</p>
<p>though.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a significant criminal history by any means, but according to a statement</p>
<p>Steven&rsquo;s boss gave police, Steven had actually been arrested just one town over, five months</p>
<p>before the fire.</p>
<p>Sergeant Wernie said that police arrested Steven for battery, criminal mischief, and</p>
<p>criminal recklessness in late spring of 1988.</p>
<p>The charges were fairly minor, and according to county jail records, Steven only served</p>
<p>45 days in jail before being released on the morning of May 26th, 1988.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing though, Steven&rsquo;s arrest wasn&rsquo;t because he got out of control with</p>
<p>Rebecca or any kind of domestic violence incident.</p>
<p>According to Sergeant Wernie, Steven was arrested for taking a baseball bat to the car of one</p>
<p>of Rebecca&rsquo;s ex-boyfriends while the ex-boyfriend was in the car.</p>
<p>As far as we could find, this information has never been reported in detail before,</p>
<p>and what he told us about the ex really piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Sergeant Wernie said at one point in time, this ex-boyfriend who Steven attacked was</p>
<p>someone investigators did look at pretty hard.</p>
<p>There was other persons of interest, of course ex-boyfriends to her, I think were persons</p>
<p>of interest.</p>
<p>Were they ever named as suspects?</p>
<p>No, I guess everybody&rsquo;s a suspect, depends on how you put that, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So yeah, were they suspects?</p>
<p>Yeah, they were suspects, but they were interviewed, and obviously nothing came out of those interviews</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not in custody, you know what I mean, they were locked up for it.</p>
<p>But are they still suspects?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess anybody&rsquo;s still a suspect in this case because we don&rsquo;t have the answers yet.</p>
<p>The rumor at the time was that Rebecca&rsquo;s ex was overheard in a local store, stating</p>
<p>that if he saw Rebecca and Steven together, he would kill them both.</p>
<p>As promising as this lead seemed, after several interviews with locals who reported the rumor,</p>
<p>police determined someone made the whole story up.</p>
<p>Everybody was interviewed at the time, all family members, I mean, I saw the list of</p>
<p>people being interviewed, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>They did a very good investigation who did this, I mean, they interviewed everybody,</p>
<p>everybody that knew anything, friends, to family, to neighbors, to co-workers, everybody</p>
<p>was interviewed and asked questions.</p>
<p>On top of that, Rebecca&rsquo;s ex provided police with an alibi.</p>
<p>According to reports, he was said to be at a friend&rsquo;s house the night of the fire, and</p>
<p>he had some buddies who corroborated his story.</p>
<p>But there never seemed to be any additional follow-up by police, that the ex-boyfriend</p>
<p>provided proof that he was at the friend&rsquo;s house the whole night.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse, police said that that ex-boyfriend has since died, so who knows if he took any</p>
<p>secrets to the grave with him.</p>
<p>According to Sergeant Wernie, two other suspects emerged over the years that felt like they</p>
<p>could be solid leads.</p>
<p>Police say these suspects were two men from Indianapolis who were seen in the town of</p>
<p>Washington on September 4th and 5th of 1988.</p>
<p>They had been hired to do some electrical work at Patsy&rsquo;s Pizza, the same restaurant</p>
<p>where Rebecca worked.</p>
<p>While on shift the night of September 4th, the bartender at the restaurant saw these</p>
<p>two men come in, and after a while, the guys started chatting her up.</p>
<p>According to her transcript in Sergeant Wernie&rsquo;s case file, the bartender mentioned the men</p>
<p>indicated they wanted to buy some cocaine while they were in town.</p>
<p>The strangers also stated that they didn&rsquo;t have a place to stay while they were there,</p>
<p>so they tried to convince the bartender to let them crash with her.</p>
<p>The bartender said that the guys wouldn&rsquo;t let up, so finally she told them that they</p>
<p>could crash at her place, but she intentionally gave them a wrong address to throw them off,</p>
<p>which is like such a great crime junkie move on her part.</p>
<p>But according to her interview with police though, these two guys somehow still figured</p>
<p>out where she lived, and when she got home from work that night, which was technically</p>
<p>early in the morning September 5th, the men were at her kitchen table.</p>
<p>Her boyfriend&rsquo;s brother had let them inside.</p>
<p>The bartender told police that she sent these guys packing into the darkness in the direction</p>
<p>of Oak Grove Road, and that would have been around the same time of morning that Rebecca</p>
<p>Harvey was murdered.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t know if the police ever tracked these guys down and interviewed them or ever</p>
<p>got alibis for them, but from what Sergeant Wernie said, the men reportedly just drove</p>
<p>around the rest of the night and morning in Washington.</p>
<p>So maybe the cops did interview them, maybe they just relied on eyewitness sightings,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure.</p>
<p>But either way, Sergeant Wernie said they could never come up with a motive for why</p>
<p>these men would have been involved in killing Rebecca and abducting or killing Steven.</p>
<p>I mean I guess you could venture and say robbery, or possibly it was sexually motivated, but</p>
<p>again why take Steven?</p>
<p>Why burn the house and only douse Rebecca with gasoline?</p>
<p>But just the detail that these guys were working at Potsy&rsquo;s Pizza the same day as the crime</p>
<p>is super interesting to me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the police could never come up with enough evidence or witness testimony</p>
<p>to connect these men or anyone else to the case.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the problem has always been, and might always be with this case if we keep</p>
<p>looking where we&rsquo;ve already looked.</p>
<p>The reality is the key people that have been investigated are either missing or dead.</p>
<p>The ex-boyfriend, deceased.</p>
<p>The shady guys from Indianapolis, confirmed dead.</p>
<p>Steven hasn&rsquo;t been seen in 33 years.</p>
<p>So possibly he&rsquo;s dead too.</p>
<p>Who did it, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is Steve dead or did somebody else kill him and take him out first, you know what I mean,</p>
<p>and then go to the house?</p>
<p>I mean just a lot of unknowns.</p>
<p>Reading through this report, we still don&rsquo;t know either way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just making a guess on my part.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;s a suspect or a victim obviously because he&rsquo;s missing, can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be interviewed.</p>
<p>It makes you assume something happened to him, but at the same time, as a detective</p>
<p>you never want to assume anything.</p>
<p>Because if you assume that, next thing you know he shows up somewhere just because he</p>
<p>changed identities or he started a new bank account or a fake name.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve learned in this job never to assume anything.</p>
<p>Anything can happen.</p>
<p>Despite these setbacks, Indiana State Police think there are still people out there who</p>
<p>know exactly what happened to Rebecca Harvey and Stephen Hendricks.</p>
<p>And those people have to come forward to even begin to move this case forward.</p>
<p>You never lose hope.</p>
<p>You always hope you can solve it.</p>
<p>But the longer the years go by, the harder it is to solve a case like this.</p>
<p>Somebody knows something out there, I would say in this case.</p>
<p>Whether Stephen&rsquo;s still alive and maybe somebody&rsquo;s talked to him and he&rsquo;s admitted to killing</p>
<p>somebody and lives in another state, or if an ex-boyfriend at this point has told anybody</p>
<p>that they admitted to anybody over the years that they did it, it&rsquo;s just anybody that would</p>
<p>know any information just to come forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been long enough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we hope for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been long enough and the truth needs to come out.</p>
<p>The family needs closure.</p>
<p>If you have any information about the murder of Rebecca Harvey or the disappearance of</p>
<p>Stephen Hendricks, you&rsquo;re asked to call the Indiana State Police Jasper Post at 812-482-1444.</p>
