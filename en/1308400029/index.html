    <p>Hi friends, so in this episode I&rsquo;m gonna give you all the things I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>about being there for yourself and all the shortcuts that are gonna get you</p>
<p>comforted because I know what it&rsquo;s like to not have anyone to turn to and not</p>
<p>know what the motherfuck to do with the way that you feel okay because sometimes</p>
<p>shit just happens and you don&rsquo;t know what to do what to think where to go who</p>
<p>to go to if you have anyone like it&rsquo;s just a fucking shit show and I know how</p>
<p>hard it is to navigate the way that your feelings so this episode I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>share everything I&rsquo;ve learned because I&rsquo;ve talked about it before and we all</p>
<p>know that I&rsquo;ve gone through most of the like worst parts of my life alone and</p>
<p>even if I&rsquo;ve had people around me I felt like they couldn&rsquo;t get it like they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even understand or know how to begin to understand what I was going</p>
<p>through a feeling so I just didn&rsquo;t talk to them like I truly felt alone and how</p>
<p>I felt but that led me to all the shit I know now it was very painful and it</p>
<p>sucked so if I can prevent you from having to go through that I&rsquo;ve got you</p>
<p>so this is your cheat sheet and I also want to make this episode as a comfort</p>
<p>thing so when you are upset or you&rsquo;re going through something or you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>feeling the best this is an episode you can go to for comfort because I always</p>
<p>look for that I always look for someone&rsquo;s video or podcast or just</p>
<p>something to have on in the background when I&rsquo;m upset like I just want to hear</p>
<p>someone fucking talk you know what I mean especially when you&rsquo;re by yourself</p>
<p>like I just want to feel like someone&rsquo;s there for me in a way even if it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the voice you know so I want to make this episode for people like that</p>
<p>because a lot of you said that my episodes are comforting so this one is</p>
<p>specifically for that because I&rsquo;m gonna tell you what the fuck to do we got this</p>
<p>so the first thing I want you to do when you&rsquo;re feeling upset is look at is there</p>
<p>something causing you to feel the way that you do so you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>understand the way that you&rsquo;re feeling but I just want you to look at is there</p>
<p>something that caused you to feel the way that you&rsquo;re feeling right now did</p>
<p>something happen did an event happen did someone do something did something shift</p>
<p>that is causing you to feel the way you do right now so if someone broke up with</p>
<p>you and you&rsquo;re sad no shit if you broke up with someone else and you&rsquo;re sad no</p>
<p>shit like it makes total fucking sense if someone died no shit you&rsquo;re sad if</p>
<p>one of your friends has just made you feel like they don&rsquo;t really care about</p>
<p>you no shit you&rsquo;re sad so first step is validating if something did happen that</p>
<p>the way you feel is normal and it&rsquo;s expected but I do know sometimes that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have an explanation for the way that you feel one day you just wake</p>
<p>up in kind of a funk and you don&rsquo;t like the way that you&rsquo;re feeling you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>feeling down you&rsquo;re feeling very sad and it&rsquo;s just out of the blue so I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>give you tips on that too but I want to give you an example first about is there</p>
<p>something causing you to feel the way that you do something I used to</p>
<p>entertain a lot is the thought of not waking up it would feel good and it</p>
<p>started to scare me a little bit cuz I was kind of like happy about that</p>
<p>thought like oh if I didn&rsquo;t wake up tomorrow it wouldn&rsquo;t be the worst thing</p>
<p>ever like I&rsquo;m talking about when I was going through shit I&rsquo;m okay right now</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t check on me bitch I&rsquo;m fine but like in the past I would just kind of</p>
<p>entertain that thought and be like you know what if I didn&rsquo;t wake up tomorrow I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be mad about it like it kind of would be a relief but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>entertaining the thought of not waking up and it feels like relief but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually have any plans to act on it then that&rsquo;s your message right there</p>
<p>the way you feel is your message of you&rsquo;re under too much fucking pressure</p>
<p>because if thinking about not waking up feels like relief it only is gonna feel</p>
<p>like relief when there&rsquo;s something to be relieved of so you&rsquo;re under too much</p>
<p>pressure right now in your life and that&rsquo;s causing you to feel the way that</p>
<p>you do a lot of people will get scared if they even entertain the thought of oh</p>
<p>my god like not waking up wouldn&rsquo;t be terrible like they get scared they freak</p>
<p>out and the way that they react to feeling that way is what makes it seem</p>
<p>worse and makes it seem like a problem but if you don&rsquo;t look at it like a</p>
<p>problem you look at it like it&rsquo;s a little message like what is it trying to</p>
<p>like what is this feeling trying to make me aware of what is the message that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming through with it you&rsquo;re under too much goddamn pressure bitch take some</p>
<p>off look for the areas in your life where you can stop spreading yourself so</p>
<p>thin where you can set yourself off the hook mentally because you&rsquo;re beating</p>
<p>yourself up a lot and you&rsquo;re holding yourself to really high standards so get</p>
<p>realistic with it reevaluate the pressure you&rsquo;re under and brainstorm</p>
<p>some ways to get some of it off of you okay so even if it&rsquo;s just a little</p>
<p>mental things mental shifts you can make to get rid of some pressure that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting on yourself great but there&rsquo;s nothing ever wrong with the way that you</p>
<p>feel ever nothing is ever wrong with the way that you fucking feel it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>understandable and it&rsquo;s explainable so let&rsquo;s move into when you&rsquo;re just in a</p>
<p>funk and you don&rsquo;t understand why you feel the way that you do I go through</p>
<p>this a lot and every time I&rsquo;m about to have some like breakthrough fucking</p>
<p>realization that changes my life I&rsquo;m sick of them like I&rsquo;ll get this weird</p>
<p>funk for a couple of days and it&rsquo;s not really like it&rsquo;s a breakdown but kind of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s my message that everything in my life needs to be broken</p>
<p>down like I need to change some shit because the way that I&rsquo;m going is not</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ll just get into a funk I&rsquo;ll get like into this like little</p>
<p>pit of like sadness for a couple of days and I don&rsquo;t understand where it</p>
<p>came from it just comes up but I love the way that Teal Swan talks about being</p>
<p>upset so she flips it she says when you&rsquo;re upset just flip the word upset</p>
<p>and look at it as a setup you&rsquo;re being set up to become aware of something and</p>
<p>I fucking love that and that will shift your entire perspective on all of this</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re being set up to learn something by the way that you feel and</p>
<p>like I said the way you feel is never wrong then the way you feel is a little</p>
<p>messenger I look at it like it&rsquo;s a messenger it&rsquo;s a little visitor so</p>
<p>whenever I get into a funk I look at the funk of like the couple day period or</p>
<p>week or whatever it&rsquo;s gonna be I look at it like this little feeling state and</p>
<p>this little feeling of being down as a messenger it&rsquo;s a visitor it&rsquo;s coming to</p>
<p>visit me to make me aware of something and I always notice in the beginning of</p>
<p>my funk I&rsquo;m like trying to figure it out immediately I&rsquo;m like what the fuck is</p>
<p>the what is it what is it like I just want to know what the fucking message is</p>
<p>and figure it out so that this feeling could go away but that&rsquo;s not how you</p>
<p>treat a visitor like you don&rsquo;t want to treat a visitor like you just want to</p>
<p>get rid of it you want to make the visitor feel welcome you want to make</p>
<p>them feel like they&rsquo;re okay to hang out and stay and that&rsquo;s the way you need to</p>
<p>respond to this funk that you feel you need to understand it&rsquo;s a visitor it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a message so treat it like that allow it to come into your life and</p>
<p>allow this funk to come in and just sit with it make space for it let it hang</p>
<p>out it&rsquo;s got a message for you so make it comfortable and let it stay as long</p>
<p>as it needs to because it&rsquo;s here to help you and I want to make sure everybody</p>
<p>understands that part because just this mindset shift about the way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling is going to change everything so when I say you need to make room for</p>
<p>the visitor you need to allow this visitor of this funk of this negative</p>
<p>feeling state or this just down feel that&rsquo;s how I feel I feel just very down</p>
<p>when I get into the funk it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not inspired by anything I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>encouraged I&rsquo;m not motivated I&rsquo;m not happy about a fuck thing it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>come down that&rsquo;s how I feel like it&rsquo;s that level of like I don&rsquo;t really want</p>
<p>to live and it&rsquo;s not that I want to die I just feel nothing positive to make me</p>
<p>want to live that&rsquo;s the little bit of like funk it&rsquo;s like a numbness and kind</p>
<p>of just like a down feeling like a little down state I don&rsquo;t know but when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in this state I want to reassure you it is completely fucking normal to</p>
<p>start questioning everything you&rsquo;re gonna question everything about yourself</p>
<p>your self-confidence what you&rsquo;re doing what you like what you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>decisions that you&rsquo;ve made people you&rsquo;ve cut off you&rsquo;re gonna start questioning</p>
<p>everything your job what you want to do with life what you&rsquo;ve been doing like</p>
<p>literally your style the way you look everything is about this part to like be</p>
<p>questioned and that&rsquo;s just what comes with being in this mind frame and having</p>
<p>this little funk come over you I just want to reassure you of that because</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t fucking tell you that people don&rsquo;t warn you about that do not</p>
<p>take any questioning serious that you notice in this funk so this is my way of</p>
<p>like weeding out okay what thoughts should I trust and what should I not</p>
<p>trust so start observing yourself questioning shit like you have to become</p>
<p>aware that you&rsquo;re questioning things and it&rsquo;s not gonna feel good it&rsquo;s gonna feel</p>
<p>fucking painful and if you just let yourself mindlessly question shit you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel lost and then you&rsquo;re gonna get scared and then you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>that even bigger feeling of like oh my god if I just didn&rsquo;t wake up it would be</p>
<p>better like I fucking get it you&rsquo;re not crazy I fucking get it okay and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to navigate this shit so step one is start observing yourself questioning</p>
<p>shit just start observing it and I&rsquo;m talking shit that like two days before</p>
<p>the funk you were like feeling good about you were amped about you were like</p>
<p>yeah you felt confident about and now all of a sudden in this funk you&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>questioning it do not take that fucking seriously okay because every time I get</p>
<p>into a funk I question my coaching abilities I question my podcast I</p>
<p>question my social media I question fucking everything I question if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually as aware as I think I am like bitch I question everything but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny because like before my funk I will be so confident about my coaching</p>
<p>abilities I&rsquo;ll be so confident about the awareness that I&rsquo;m sharing in my podcast</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be so confident about everything and then being in this funk will make it</p>
<p>seem like all that confidence I had just got wiped the fuck out it&rsquo;s not gone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the mood I&rsquo;m in and I&rsquo;m taking my thoughts of questioning things too</p>
<p>seriously I&rsquo;m making it mean that they&rsquo;re true and that&rsquo;s my next point is</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a funk or you&rsquo;re in a down mood you take a lot more things as</p>
<p>fact and like it&rsquo;s certain and that&rsquo;s the way that it is so if someone has</p>
<p>criticism of you whereas before it wouldn&rsquo;t bother you you&rsquo;re a little bit</p>
<p>more receptive to shit when you&rsquo;re in a down mood so like people&rsquo;s criticism</p>
<p>will hit harder you questioning yourself just by questioning things it</p>
<p>will make you think that something&rsquo;s gone wrong basically you&rsquo;re not gonna be</p>
<p>good at buffering yourself and kind of like checking yourself and being able to</p>
<p>filter out what is true and holds weight and what doesn&rsquo;t so like your ability to</p>
<p>like critically think and weigh out the options it&rsquo;s like everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hurtful is gonna hurt ten times worse because you don&rsquo;t have that barrier</p>
<p>anymore it&rsquo;s like your barrier to bullshit and your barrier to questioning</p>
<p>yourself and feeling down about things and your barrier to not seeing your</p>
<p>worth is up like that one&rsquo;s up but your barrier to protecting yourself is down</p>
<p>right you just don&rsquo;t see shit for what it is like you&rsquo;re very clouded you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>jaded and I just want to reassure you that&rsquo;s normal for the way that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong and it will change it&rsquo;s not true it&rsquo;s not here to</p>
<p>stick around that&rsquo;s just something that comes with being in a funk is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna start questioning and doubting shit so the first thing I want you to do</p>
<p>is give yourself reassurance that you&rsquo;re not taking your thoughts seriously it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re hungover and you&rsquo;re anxious as fuck you don&rsquo;t take your</p>
<p>thoughts seriously from that day because you know you&rsquo;re gonna be wacky like your</p>
<p>thoughts are not accurate they&rsquo;re gonna be anxious and weird and you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>all in your fucking head and that&rsquo;s expected after you drink alcohol just</p>
<p>how you don&rsquo;t take your thoughts serious when you&rsquo;re hungover don&rsquo;t take your</p>
<p>thoughts serious when you&rsquo;re in a fucking funk like anything you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>questioning set it the fuck free just set it free from your mind and</p>
<p>understand you&rsquo;re gonna have shit come up you didn&rsquo;t realize you were insecure</p>
<p>about or things that you were questioning but reassure yourself it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s true so tell yourself after this funk has passed if these</p>
<p>feelings are still here then I will go into them I&rsquo;m not gonna go into them and</p>
<p>question them and question everything that I&rsquo;m doing and start changing</p>
<p>everything that I&rsquo;m doing just because I&rsquo;m in this funk that&rsquo;s the main thing</p>
<p>is do not change what you&rsquo;ve been doing because you&rsquo;re in the funk if you have</p>
<p>goals you&rsquo;re working toward work toward that if you&rsquo;re working on your business</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re working on going to the gym if you&rsquo;re working on eating healthy don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just start throwing shit away and making all these changes because you feel a</p>
<p>little different like I said the messenger is here to hang out now you</p>
<p>allow the visitor to come and hang out you don&rsquo;t allow the visitor to come and</p>
<p>disrupt your entire fucking schedule of everything you&rsquo;re working on so continue</p>
<p>working on the things you&rsquo;ve been working on address things observe your</p>
<p>feelings but don&rsquo;t take them too seriously during this time so the next</p>
<p>part of that is when you start questioning shit if you can&rsquo;t set your</p>
<p>mind free from it and you keep questioning it just look at the fucking</p>
<p>facts look straight up at the fact so how I said when I start getting in a</p>
<p>little funk I&rsquo;ll question my coaching abilities I&rsquo;ll question my podcast and</p>
<p>how good it is if I&rsquo;m actually smart or not I want you to start looking at</p>
<p>things that the the proof is obvious and so in front of your face you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even question it so when you&rsquo;re questioning things go look for the</p>
<p>answers that are unquestionable so when I go read reviews of my podcast and I</p>
<p>look at my DMS because you guys DM me all the time Instagram about how much</p>
<p>you love my podcast and I love that you DM me my Instagram is the Leo Skeppy if</p>
<p>you want to DM me I would love to hear what you have to say and if you have any</p>
<p>like ideas for future topics send them to me bitch like we&rsquo;re in this together</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to talk about what you guys need help with so tell me but I&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>read DMS I&rsquo;ll go look at you guys as message I&rsquo;ll hear your words I will hear</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s reaction to me and what I&rsquo;m sharing and also I&rsquo;ll look at my</p>
<p>coaching testimonials the ways that I&rsquo;ve helped people I&rsquo;ll go back and look at</p>
<p>things people have said to me and I&rsquo;ll remember the ways that people end calls</p>
<p>with me and how most of my clients reschedule with me right after the call</p>
<p>they get off of like that only happens when I&rsquo;m able to contribute value and to</p>
<p>truly help them it&rsquo;s so obvious when I look at it that the thoughts that I had</p>
<p>questioning it or something that were in my head and when I look for the proof in</p>
<p>real life it ain&rsquo;t fucking there so that&rsquo;s what I want you to do is look for</p>
<p>the facts and look for the shit that is not able to be questioned like how am I</p>
<p>gonna go read the reviews of my podcast and be like I&rsquo;m worried my podcast is</p>
<p>not that good and then I have all these reviews of people saying it changed</p>
<p>their life and it helped them more than their therapist has how am I supposed to</p>
<p>fight that you can&rsquo;t so then I have to make my brain accept hey fucker you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing good you&rsquo;re fine you know I mean so when there are not any facts or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way for you to directly reassure yourself and look at okay the</p>
<p>way that I&rsquo;m feeling is like a little just incorrect the way I&rsquo;m feeling is a</p>
<p>little inaccurate when I start questioning my abilities like when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling that this is what to do when there&rsquo;s no facts to look at I want</p>
<p>you to formulate a plan so when you&rsquo;ve tried to set something free from your</p>
<p>mind and it won&rsquo;t go away and you&rsquo;re just worried about this thing or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just so self-conscious about this thing you&rsquo;re worried about it happening you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worrying you&rsquo;re worrying you&rsquo;re not good enough whatever it is formulate a plan</p>
<p>for the exact scenario you&rsquo;re so worried about and the one that you can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>thinking about so what are you gonna do make an action step like action plan</p>
<p>of things you&rsquo;re going to do after this funk is over if the way that you feel</p>
<p>does not leave having a list of action steps is gonna make you feel so</p>
<p>reassured and safe and comfortable and it&rsquo;s gonna allow you to free yourself</p>
<p>from that worry and the shit that&rsquo;s going on in your mind like it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>help it just kind of like put it at rest and it&rsquo;s like the thoughts are only</p>
<p>coming up because you won&rsquo;t address them so when you address what you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re worrying about when you address it you make a little plan</p>
<p>for it the thought can fuck off like it will leave you alone because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ready for it and even if it doesn&rsquo;t leave you alone you can now reassure</p>
<p>yourself every time that thought continues to come up I&rsquo;ve planned for it</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not gonna spend time worrying about it okay so my next tip is about</p>
<p>before you fucking call someone or before you ask someone to come be there</p>
<p>for you and comfort you this is all the shit you need to do before that but also</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m about to list is how you can actually be there for yourself</p>
<p>before you go to other people so if you don&rsquo;t have anyone there for you you can</p>
<p>still do everything in this list and you should but the worst thing is when</p>
<p>somebody is like all emotional and fucked up and freaking out and they come</p>
<p>to you it&rsquo;s like girl get your fucking self together get your thoughts together</p>
<p>before you come to me and just start unleashing all of your shit onto me and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about a serious situation like if someone in your family</p>
<p>dies I&rsquo;m there for you you&rsquo;re allowed to freak out you&rsquo;re allowed to be</p>
<p>dramatic if there&rsquo;s like a serious event that has happened and you need someone</p>
<p>there for you call me immediately that&rsquo;s totally fine that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about I&rsquo;m talking about little bullshit fucking things that people freak the</p>
<p>fuck out over and they don&rsquo;t check in with their self before they come to me</p>
<p>and they just start freaking out and it spirals and they don&rsquo;t have their</p>
<p>thoughts together they&rsquo;re just blurting out all this shit they&rsquo;re feeling all</p>
<p>these things and they&rsquo;re just like a fucking little tornado and they come</p>
<p>into my life and come into my world expecting me to help them figure it out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like bitch check in with yourself first if it&rsquo;s not something like</p>
<p>catastrophic and huge you&rsquo;d like come to me immediately for that shit but when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something like day to day and you&rsquo;re just overwhelmed and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with things motherfucker I want you to sit down and check in with</p>
<p>yourself first so what I want people to do before you go running to other people</p>
<p>or before one of my friends if you&rsquo;re listening to this before you come running</p>
<p>to me fucking sit down check in with yourself and I want you to make a list</p>
<p>of all of your concerns worries what&rsquo;s bothering you and what is going on so</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re prepared to talk about it kind of treat it like you&rsquo;re going to a</p>
<p>meeting like get fucking logical and put it all on paper so that you can come to</p>
<p>me and list off exactly what you&rsquo;re feeling thinking worrying about going</p>
<p>through I want it fucking listed out so we can have this shit organized so we</p>
<p>can be as efficient as possible I know that&rsquo;s a weird approach to take but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a point behind it as you try to make a list and write out the things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worried about the things you&rsquo;re feeling the things you&rsquo;re concerned</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s bothering you you&rsquo;re gonna be able to see it all outside of your</p>
<p>head so when you write it all on a piece of paper or you type it up in a document</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see everything that was going on inside your head that felt so</p>
<p>overwhelming and like it was so much to deal with you&rsquo;re gonna see it laid out</p>
<p>on paper and it&rsquo;s different when you&rsquo;re thinking it versus when you can see it</p>
<p>in front of you so when you see it on that paper and you see all your thoughts</p>
<p>spilled out in front of you you&rsquo;re gonna be able to be there for yourself a lot</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re gonna be able to sort out a lot of what you&rsquo;re feeling and thinking</p>
<p>and worried about you&rsquo;re gonna be able to look at this list of shit or this</p>
<p>giant page full of things that are just going on you&rsquo;re gonna be able to</p>
<p>individually go through and look at everything and cross things out okay</p>
<p>well that makes sense now that I&rsquo;m looking at it that is that makes sense</p>
<p>or that doesn&rsquo;t make sense or yeah I&rsquo;m not gonna worry about that where the</p>
<p>fuck did that come from that was just a random thought you&rsquo;ll be able to cross</p>
<p>out a lot of shit you&rsquo;ll be able to reassure yourself of a lot of shit that</p>
<p>is on your paper so getting everything that&rsquo;s inside your head out in front of</p>
<p>you so you could look at it and observe it is your first step in dealing with it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of things you can solve for yourself and a lot of</p>
<p>things you can get yourself through comfort yourself through and reason</p>
<p>yourself through and then what&rsquo;s left on the list that you need guidance with or</p>
<p>you need help dealing with you want to see a new perspective you need insight</p>
<p>you just need a little advice you just want to share it with somebody then you</p>
<p>come to me you come to me with your list of the things that you cannot handle</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where I can be of most use to you that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll get tighter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll feel like people can actually be there for you is after</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gone through the list and handled all the shit that you can handle but by</p>
<p>writing it you&rsquo;re gonna realize you can handle a lot more of it as my point and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll be able to go to people for what they can actually be of use with</p>
<p>because I know there&rsquo;s so many situations where you go to somebody when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re upset and you feel like they were no fucking help it&rsquo;s like you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking get it but you didn&rsquo;t get it you didn&rsquo;t go to talk to them prepared</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna be able to poke holes in your own worries you&rsquo;re gonna be able to</p>
<p>poke holes in your own stories and the shit that you&rsquo;re telling yourself you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to redirect your thoughts in your mind when you can see it on</p>
<p>paper like that just remember me saying poke holes in your own stories first and</p>
<p>then what&rsquo;s left you go to talk to someone about that is where they can</p>
<p>truly help you but my whole point of saying even if you don&rsquo;t have someone to</p>
<p>do this with or someone to go to just getting everything out of your head and</p>
<p>sorting through it yourself is how you&rsquo;re gonna be able to be there for you</p>
<p>like there is gonna be times where you make this full fucking list of shit and</p>
<p>you get yourself through it and you figure it all out for yourself and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to go to anyone about it and by doing it more and more you&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to be there for yourself through more and more things and handle more and more</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;ll be able to see new perspectives on your own you&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to be there for yourself but sometimes there is like a comfort aspect that you</p>
<p>want so doing the list before you go try to get comforted by someone you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>spending your time enjoying their company and being comforted by them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be spending your time trying to sort out the way that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling and all these emotional ups and downs does that make sense like you need</p>
<p>to make it easier for yourself to go be comforted and to be allowed to be</p>
<p>comforted because if you go at somebody venting and freaking out and screaming</p>
<p>about shit they&rsquo;re gonna be like whoa like cool it bitch so get that sorted</p>
<p>out with yourself when you can like I said there are gonna be situations where</p>
<p>something is just way too overwhelming like if you find out your partner&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cheating on you and you&rsquo;re freaking the fuck out go be with someone there are</p>
<p>situations where you need to go be with someone immediately they need to be able</p>
<p>to walk you through it and comfort you as you&rsquo;re going through it but for the</p>
<p>situations where you can handle it yourself and it&rsquo;s not like super intense</p>
<p>and trying in the moment I want you to start trying to be there for yourself</p>
<p>first but one of the big things I want to make sure I point out in this is when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling some type of way that&rsquo;s part of you inside of you screaming for</p>
<p>your fucking help and screaming for your attention so whenever you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>down you&rsquo;re feeling angry you&rsquo;re feeling sad you&rsquo;re feeling anything you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling there&rsquo;s part of you that needs your attention so I want you to face it</p>
<p>I want you to look at it I want you to validate that part of you that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>screaming for your attention what&rsquo;s bothering it it&rsquo;s easy when you can look</p>
<p>at it separate as a separate person a separate part of you okay that helps me</p>
<p>a lot so I know it will probably help a lot of you look at it like a party</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s screaming for your attention what does it need from you how can you give</p>
<p>it your attention how can you be there for it what does it need you to know how</p>
<p>can you take it into consideration the part of you that&rsquo;s upset you know and</p>
<p>that will help you a lot with this whole process but remember when I said the</p>
<p>funk was kind of there as a visitor so sometimes these funks pop up to disrupt</p>
<p>your life like I said it&rsquo;s a visitor it&rsquo;s a messenger it&rsquo;s got a message for</p>
<p>you so usually a funk will come in when you&rsquo;ve been ignoring the way that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been feeling something&rsquo;s gonna come up where it&rsquo;s like not ignorable what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>word for that like you can&rsquo;t ignore it that&rsquo;s exactly it but if that&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>takes is this funk coming to visit you for you to be brought back toward</p>
<p>yourself and to become aware of something that you need to change or</p>
<p>become aware of everything that you&rsquo;re feeling to the point where you have to</p>
<p>throw it on paper and look at it if that&rsquo;s what it takes then that visitor</p>
<p>served its fucking purpose it&rsquo;s forced you to lay out how you&rsquo;re feeling and</p>
<p>observe the thoughts you&rsquo;ve been thinking because you&rsquo;re gonna discover</p>
<p>some things you&rsquo;ve been thinking that have been holding you back or that you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking or you&rsquo;re gonna realize that certain thoughts have been</p>
<p>putting pressure on you that you didn&rsquo;t fucking need and by getting you to a</p>
<p>point where you fully make a fucking list of everything going on and you</p>
<p>start strategizing and you start looking at changes you&rsquo;re gonna make to your</p>
<p>perspective your thoughts your actions whatever it&rsquo;s gonna be if that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it took to get you to make changes to your life then that&rsquo;s what it took and</p>
<p>the funk the visitor served its purpose every breakdown is setting you up for a</p>
<p>breakthrough and I want you to fucking realize that I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>that somewhere if I just came up with that I don&rsquo;t fucking know it probably</p>
<p>was on some goddamn Pinterest quote that&rsquo;s my reassurance you feel the way</p>
<p>that you do for a reason always and I hope this episode helped you and I</p>
<p>really hope you take it seriously because these are the things that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>like completely transformed me and the way that I do shit and the way that I</p>
<p>handle things and it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s made me a lot more resilient to things because</p>
<p>when I start feeling a negative way I don&rsquo;t start freaking the fuck out oh my</p>
<p>god I have to get away from it it&rsquo;s like no I look at it like part of me is</p>
<p>screaming for my attention now I&rsquo;m gonna look at him what does he need cuz when</p>
<p>you start feeling a negative thing it&rsquo;s like a part of you screaming for your</p>
<p>attention when people run the opposite way of that all that&rsquo;s gonna happen is</p>
<p>your emotions are gonna have to start screaming louder to the point you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking ignore them and it&rsquo;s gonna body your ass okay don&rsquo;t fucking run from how</p>
<p>you feel like sometimes it&rsquo;s okay to go get drunk and just have a fucking night</p>
<p>out when you&rsquo;re dealing with too much go do it it&rsquo;s fucking normal like it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>human like it&rsquo;s too much to take it on all the time but don&rsquo;t run for too long</p>
<p>just understand that part of you is yelling for your attention part of you</p>
<p>needs you so go do what you need to do to get to a point where you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>overwhelmed and fucking drink have a good fucking night have a good weekend</p>
<p>whatever it is and then come back to yourself okay no one&rsquo;s judging you for</p>
<p>going to party in a little bit no one&rsquo;s judging you for smoking a little blank</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s judging you from de-stressing a little bit like it&rsquo;s not fun to go into</p>
<p>your emotions all the fucking time like take a little minute for yourself take a</p>
<p>break the party that&rsquo;s tired of responsibility let them go fucking be</p>
<p>let off to and then come back to the party that&rsquo;s screaming for your</p>
<p>attention like you need to take care of all parts of you so that&rsquo;s all I got for</p>
<p>this episode I really hope you enjoyed I hope you took something from it if you</p>
<p>like this podcast I just have one request and it&rsquo;s that you go leave me a</p>
<p>five-star rating thank you so much if you want to keep up with me all of my</p>
<p>social media will be linked in the description of this podcast also if you</p>
<p>are interested in one-on-one coaching with me I have now created an</p>
<p>application process so it&rsquo;s no longer just free to schedule I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>applications now to keep up with the demand because it just got too high so</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m screening people basically to see who&rsquo;s a good fit and who&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>because I want to work with action takers I want to work with people that</p>
<p>are serious about transforming their life because the shit that I say y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for and where I specialize is with the people that have</p>
<p>been looking for answers they can&rsquo;t find and the people that have been trying</p>
<p>shit and it&rsquo;s just not working I&rsquo;m the person that those people can go to so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interested in that I will put the link to the application in the</p>
<p>description box also and I want to make it very clear that you&rsquo;ve already got</p>
<p>what it takes to get through what you&rsquo;re dealing with or to improve your life or</p>
<p>to reach your goals and I&rsquo;ll help you see that and it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot easier</p>
<p>when you got me in your corner because that&rsquo;s exactly how I want it to feel I</p>
<p>wanted to feel like you have someone that has your back and like I&rsquo;m in your</p>
<p>corner because that&rsquo;s what it is like I&rsquo;m there for you and I&rsquo;m there to do</p>
<p>shit with you but anyways thank you so much for listening please stay safe and</p>
<p>take care of yourself and I will talk to you next Sunday</p>
