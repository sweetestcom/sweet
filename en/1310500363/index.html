    <p>The following is a conversation with Andrew Strominger,</p>
<p>theoretical physicist at Harvard,</p>
<p>whose research seeks to shed light</p>
<p>on the unification of fundamental laws of nature,</p>
<p>the origin of the universe,</p>
<p>and the quantum structure of black holes</p>
<p>and event horizons.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got Eight Sleep for naps,</p>
<p>Rocket Money for saving on subscriptions,</p>
<p>Indeed for hiring excellent teams,</p>
<p>and ExpressVPN for security and privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, on to the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please do check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>And I should also mention that, as always,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hiring folks to join our amazing team.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested,</p>
<p>or know somebody who might be interested,</p>
<p>go to lexfriedman.com slash hiring.</p>
<p>This episode is brought to you by Eight Sleep</p>
<p>and its new Pod 3 mattress.</p>
<p>Today is actually an example of a day</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s been a pretty rough one.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep the night before.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep tonight.</p>
<p>I had to do a bunch of really difficult work,</p>
<p>especially programming work</p>
<p>and then reviewing other people&rsquo;s code.</p>
<p>I also had to record a podcast.</p>
<p>I also had to socialize,</p>
<p>which is another kind of challenge altogether.</p>
<p>And all of that combines to just this kind of mental state</p>
<p>of maybe psychological, physical, all kinds of exhaustion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of incredible how a short nap</p>
<p>can fix so much of that.</p>
<p>At least can fix the most important aspect,</p>
<p>which is once you wake up, you see the world anew.</p>
<p>That reinvigorated feeling of gratitude</p>
<p>for being alive, for the beauty of the world,</p>
<p>for being able to experience the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>And a great nap, at least for me,</p>
<p>does that just every single time.</p>
<p>And in order to do a great nap, the best of the naps,</p>
<p>you should do it on an Eight Sleep mattress.</p>
<p>It keeps it cool, warm blanket, it&rsquo;s heaven.</p>
<p>Check it out and get special savings</p>
<p>when you go to eightsleep.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Rocket Money,</p>
<p>a personal finance app that finds and cancels</p>
<p>your unwanted subscriptions, monitors your spending,</p>
<p>and helps you lower your bills all in one place.</p>
<p>It always cracks me up when people have something</p>
<p>like a treadmill in their basement</p>
<p>or in their apartment or wherever,</p>
<p>and you can just tell that treadmill</p>
<p>is not being used in months, if not years.</p>
<p>And to me, for my life, I hate having that treadmill there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a kind of symbolic visceral reminder</p>
<p>of promises to yourself that you have broken.</p>
<p>Anyway, subscriptions are kind of like that,</p>
<p>except they also waste your money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I plan to do this thing,</p>
<p>I plan to consume this product or this service</p>
<p>or to do this kind of reading or to do this kind of thing</p>
<p>on the internet or whatever the subscription is.</p>
<p>And then you realize, I&rsquo;m actually not using that thing.</p>
<p>So save the money by using Rocket Money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an easy service that helps you</p>
<p>get rid of the unwanted subscriptions.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to rocketmoney.com slash flex</p>
<p>to cancel unwanted subscriptions</p>
<p>and manage your money the easy way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rocketmoney.com slash flex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Indeed,</p>
<p>a hiring website.</p>
<p>I should also mention that we&rsquo;re currently hiring.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>
<p>We have an amazing team of human beings</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m truly proud of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m truly happy to stand besides</p>
<p>as we take on the challenges of creative work</p>
<p>in this particular podcast and beyond.</p>
<p>Basically capturing in video form interesting ideas,</p>
<p>interesting people, interesting concepts,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s educational,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s beyond maybe educational,</p>
<p>almost like exploring the human condition,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s podcast or videos or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s an amazing team and we&rsquo;re always growing it.</p>
<p>And to do so, you have to use the best tools for the job.</p>
<p>Indeed, to me, is an incredible tool for hiring.</p>
<p>They have all kinds of stuff,</p>
<p>including Instant Match tool</p>
<p>that helps you find quality candidates.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Andrew Strominger.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>You are part of the Harvard Black Hole Initiative,</p>
<p>which has theoretical physicists, experimentalists,</p>
<p>and even philosophers.</p>
<p>So let me ask the big question.</p>
<p>What is a black hole from a theoretical,</p>
<p>from an experimental,</p>
<p>maybe even from a philosophical perspective?</p>
<p>So a black hole is defined theoretically</p>
<p>as a region of space-time</p>
<p>from which light can never escape.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s just the starting point.</p>
<p>Many weird things follow from that basic definition,</p>
<p>but that is the basic definition.</p>
<p>What is light that can&rsquo;t escape from a black hole?</p>
<p>Well, light is, you know,</p>
<p>the stuff that comes out of the sun,</p>
<p>that stuff that goes into your eyes.</p>
<p>Light is one of the stuff that disappears</p>
<p>when the lights go off.</p>
<p>This is stuff that appears when the lights come on.</p>
<p>Of course, I could give you a mathematical definition,</p>
<p>but, or a physical mathematical definition,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s something that we all understand</p>
<p>very intuitively what is light.</p>
<p>Black holes, on the other hand,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand intuitively.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very weird.</p>
<p>And one of the questions is about black holes,</p>
<p>which I think you were alluding to,</p>
<p>is, you know, why doesn&rsquo;t light get out?</p>
<p>Or how is it that there can be a region of space-time</p>
<p>from which light can&rsquo;t escape?</p>
<p>It definitely happens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen those regions.</p>
<p>We have spectacular pictures,</p>
<p>especially in the last several years of those regions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;re up in the sky,</p>
<p>thousands or millions of them.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t yet know how many.</p>
<p>But the proper explanation</p>
<p>of why light doesn&rsquo;t escape from a black hole</p>
<p>is still a matter of some debate.</p>
<p>And one explanation,</p>
<p>which perhaps Einstein might have given,</p>
<p>is that light carries energy.</p>
<p>You know it carries energy because, you know,</p>
<p>we have photocells and we can take the light from the sun</p>
<p>and collect it, turn it into electricity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s energy in light.</p>
<p>And anything that carries energy</p>
<p>is subject to a gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Gravity will pull at anything with energy.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that the gravitational pull</p>
<p>exerted by an object is proportional to its mass.</p>
<p>And so if you get enough mass in a small enough region,</p>
<p>you can prevent light from escaping.</p>
<p>And let me flesh that out a little more.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on the Earth</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on a rocket ship</p>
<p>leaving the surface of the Earth,</p>
<p>and if we ignore the friction from the air,</p>
<p>if your rocket accelerates up to 11 kilometers per second,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s escape velocity.</p>
<p>And if there were no friction,</p>
<p>you could just continue forever to the next galaxy.</p>
<p>On the moon, which has less mass,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only seven kilometers per second.</p>
<p>So, but going in the other direction,</p>
<p>if you have enough mass in one place,</p>
<p>the escape velocity can become the speed of light.</p>
<p>If you shine light straight up away from the Earth,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have too much trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going way above the escape velocity.</p>
<p>But if you have enough mass there,</p>
<p>even light can&rsquo;t escape the escape velocity.</p>
<p>And according to Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity,</p>
<p>there is an absolute speed limit in the universe,</p>
<p>the speed of light, and nothing makes any sense.</p>
<p>Nothing could be self-consistent</p>
<p>if there were objects that could exceed light speed.</p>
<p>And so, in these very, very massive regions of space-time,</p>
<p>even light cannot escape.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is Einstein himself</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think that these objects,</p>
<p>we call the black holes, could exist.</p>
<p>But let me actually linger on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting things here.</p>
<p>First, the speed limit.</p>
<p>How wild is it to you, if you put yourself in the mind</p>
<p>in the time of Einstein before him,</p>
<p>to come up with a speed limit, that there is a speed limit,</p>
<p>and that speed limit is the speed of light?</p>
<p>How difficult of an idea is that?</p>
<p>You know, you said from a mathematical physics perspective,</p>
<p>everything just kind of falls into place,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t, perhaps, maybe initially had the luxury</p>
<p>to think mathematically.</p>
<p>He had to come up with it intuitively, yes?</p>
<p>So, how counterintuitive is this notion to you?</p>
<p>Is it still crazy?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very funny thing in physics.</p>
<p>The best discoveries seem completely obvious in retrospect.</p>
<p>Even my own discoveries,</p>
<p>which, of course, are far lesser than Einstein&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but many of my papers, many of my collaborators</p>
<p>get all confused.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try to understand something.</p>
<p>We say, we&rsquo;ve got to solve this problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get all confused.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll solve it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get it all together,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>everything will fall into place.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll explain it, and then we&rsquo;ll look back</p>
<p>at our discussions for the proceedings of months</p>
<p>and literally be unable to reconstruct</p>
<p>how confused we were</p>
<p>and how we could ever have thought of it any other way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>And so, not only can I not fathom</p>
<p>how confused Einstein was</p>
<p>before he, when he started thinking about the issues,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even reconstruct my own confusion</p>
<p>from two weeks ago.</p>
<p>I, you know, so the really beautiful ideas in physics</p>
<p>have this very hard-to-get-yourself-back-into-the mindset.</p>
<p>Of course, Einstein was confused about many, many things.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a physicist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not how many things you got wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the ratio of how many you got wrong</p>
<p>to how many you got right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the number that you got right.</p>
<p>So, Einstein didn&rsquo;t believe black holes existed</p>
<p>even though he predicted them.</p>
<p>And I went and I read that paper which he wrote.</p>
<p>You know, Einstein wrote down his field equations in 1915,</p>
<p>and Schwarzschild solved them</p>
<p>and discovered the black hole solution</p>
<p>three or four months later, in very early 1916.</p>
<p>And 25 years later, Einstein wrote a paper.</p>
<p>So, with 25 years to think about what this solution means,</p>
<p>wrote a paper in which he said that black holes didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, you know,</p>
<p>if one of my students in my general relativity course</p>
<p>wrote this, you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t pass them.</p>
<p>You get a C-minus, oh, you wouldn&rsquo;t pass them.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Get a C-minus, okay.</p>
<p>Same thing with gravity waves.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>Oh, he didn&rsquo;t believe in gravitational waves either?</p>
<p>He went back and forth, but he wrote a paper in, I think,</p>
<p>34, saying that gravity waves didn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>because people were very confused</p>
<p>about what a coordinate transformation is.</p>
<p>And in fact, this confusion about</p>
<p>what a coordinate transformation is has persisted,</p>
<p>and we actually think we&rsquo;re on the edge of solving it</p>
<p>100 years later, 100 years later.</p>
<p>Well, what is coordinate transformation,</p>
<p>as it was 100 years ago to today?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine I want to draw a map with pictures</p>
<p>of all the states and the mountains,</p>
<p>and then I want to draw the weather forecast,</p>
<p>what the temperatures are gonna be all over the country.</p>
<p>And I do that using one set of weather stations,</p>
<p>and I number the weather stations,</p>
<p>and you have some other set of weather stations,</p>
<p>and you do the same thing.</p>
<p>So the coordinates are the locations</p>
<p>of the weather stations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re how we describe where the things are.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we should draw the same map.</p>
<p>That is coordinate invariance.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re telling somebody,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna tell somebody at a real physical operation,</p>
<p>we want you to stay as dry as possible</p>
<p>on your drive from here to California,</p>
<p>we should give them exactly the same route.</p>
<p>No matter which weather stations we use</p>
<p>or how we, it&rsquo;s a very trivial,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the labeling of points is an artifact</p>
<p>and not in the real physics.</p>
<p>So it turns out that that&rsquo;s almost true,</p>
<p>but not quite.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some subtleties to it.</p>
<p>The statement that you should always have the same,</p>
<p>give at least the same kind of trajectory,</p>
<p>the same kind of instructions,</p>
<p>no matter the weather stations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some very delicate subtleties to that,</p>
<p>which began to be noticed in the 50s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly true, but when you have a space-time with edges,</p>
<p>it gets very tricky how you label the edges.</p>
<p>And space-time in terms of space or in terms of time,</p>
<p>in terms of everything, just space-time?</p>
<p>Either one, space or time.</p>
<p>That gets very tricky.</p>
<p>And Einstein didn&rsquo;t have it right.</p>
<p>And in fact, he had an earlier version</p>
<p>of general relativity in 1914,</p>
<p>which he was very excited about,</p>
<p>which was wrong,</p>
<p>gave, it wasn&rsquo;t fully coordinate-invariant,</p>
<p>it was only partially coordinate-invariant.</p>
<p>It was wrong.</p>
<p>It gave the wrong answer for bending light to the sun</p>
<p>by a factor of two.</p>
<p>There was an expedition sent out to measure it</p>
<p>during World War I.</p>
<p>They were captured before they could measure it.</p>
<p>And that gave Einstein four more years</p>
<p>to clean his act up, by which time he&rsquo;d gotten it right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very tricky business.</p>
<p>But once it&rsquo;s all laid out, it&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>Then why do you think Einstein</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t believe his own equations</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t think that black holes are real?</p>
<p>Why was that such a difficult idea for him?</p>
<p>Well, something very interesting happens</p>
<p>in Schwarzschild&rsquo;s solution of the Einstein equation.</p>
<p>I think his reasoning was ultimately wrong,</p>
<p>but let me explain to you what it was.</p>
<p>At the center of the black hole, behind the horizon,</p>
<p>in a region that nobody can see and live to tell about it,</p>
<p>at the center of the black hole, there&rsquo;s a singularity,</p>
<p>and if you pass the horizon, you go into the singularity,</p>
<p>you get crushed, and that&rsquo;s the end of everything.</p>
<p>Now, the word singularity means that,</p>
<p>it just means that Einstein&rsquo;s equations break down.</p>
<p>They become infinite.</p>
<p>You write them down, you put them on the computer.</p>
<p>When the computer hits that singularity, it crashes.</p>
<p>Everything becomes infinite, there&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>So the equations are just no good there.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s actually not a bad thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good thing, and let me explain why.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s an odd thing that Maxwell&rsquo;s equation</p>
<p>and Maxwell&rsquo;s theory and Newton&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>never exhibit this phenomena.</p>
<p>You write them down, you can solve them exactly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really, Newton&rsquo;s theory of gravity,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really very simple theories.</p>
<p>You can solve them.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t solve the three-body problem,</p>
<p>but you can certainly solve a lot of things about them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was never any reason,</p>
<p>even though Maxwell and Newton perhaps fell for this trap,</p>
<p>there were never any reason to think</p>
<p>that these equations were exact.</p>
<p>And every, there&rsquo;s no equation, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some equations that we&rsquo;ve written down</p>
<p>that we still think are exact.</p>
<p>Some people still think are exact.</p>
<p>My view is that there&rsquo;s no exact equation.</p>
<p>Everything is an approximation.</p>
<p>Everything is an approximation.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to get as close as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying objective truth</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist in this world?</p>
<p>The internet&rsquo;s gonna be very mad at you.</p>
<p>We could discuss that, but that&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t say Newton&rsquo;s theory was wrong.</p>
<p>It had very, very small corrections,</p>
<p>incredibly small corrections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a puzzle why they&rsquo;re so small.</p>
<p>So if you watch the precession of Mercury&rsquo;s perihelion,</p>
<p>this was the first indication of something going wrong.</p>
<p>According to Newton&rsquo;s theory,</p>
<p>Mercury has an elliptical orbit.</p>
<p>The long part of it moves around</p>
<p>as other planets come by and perturb it and so on.</p>
<p>And so this was measured by Le Verrier in 1859,</p>
<p>and he compared theory and experiment,</p>
<p>and he found out that the perihelion precess</p>
<p>moves around the sun once every 230,000 years.</p>
<p>33 centuries instead of every 231 centuries.</p>
<p>Now, this is the wonderful thing about science.</p>
<p>Why was this guy?</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t get any idea how much work this is,</p>
<p>you know, but of course he made one</p>
<p>of the greatest discoveries in the history of science</p>
<p>without even knowing what good it was gonna be.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how small, that was the first sign</p>
<p>that there was something wrong with Newton.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, so the corrections to Newton&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>are very, very small, but they&rsquo;re definitely there.</p>
<p>The corrections to electromagnetism,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re mostly, the ones that we see</p>
<p>are mostly coming from quantum effects.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>So the corrections for Maxwell&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>is when you get super tiny,</p>
<p>and then the corrections for Newton&rsquo;s laws of gravity</p>
<p>is when you get super big.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you require corrections.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but I would phrase it</p>
<p>as saying when it&rsquo;s super accurate.</p>
<p>You know, if you look at the Bohr atom,</p>
<p>Maxwell electromagnetism is not a very good approximation</p>
<p>to the force between the proton and the electron.</p>
<p>The quantum mechanics, if you didn&rsquo;t have quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>the electron would spiral into the proton,</p>
<p>and the atom would collapse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quantum, you know, so that&rsquo;s a huge correction there.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So every theory gets corrected as we learn more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d just be no reason to suppose</p>
<p>that it should be otherwise.</p>
<p>How does this relate to the singularity?</p>
<p>Why the singularity becomes quantum?</p>
<p>So when you hit the singularity,</p>
<p>you know that you need some improvement</p>
<p>to Einstein&rsquo;s theory of gravity.</p>
<p>And that improvement, we understand what kind of things</p>
<p>that improvement should involve.</p>
<p>It should involve quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Quantum effects become important there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small thing.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t understand exactly what the theory is,</p>
<p>but we know there&rsquo;s no reason to think,</p>
<p>you know, Einstein&rsquo;s theory was invented</p>
<p>to describe weakly curved things,</p>
<p>the solar system and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly robust that we now see</p>
<p>that it works very well near the horizons</p>
<p>around black holes and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good thing that the theory drives itself</p>
<p>that it predicts its own demise.</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s gravity had its demise.</p>
<p>There were regimes in which it wasn&rsquo;t valid.</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s electromagnetism had its demise.</p>
<p>There was regimes in which quantum effects</p>
<p>greatly modified the equations.</p>
<p>But general relativity all on its own</p>
<p>found a system which originally was fine</p>
<p>would perversely wander off into a configuration</p>
<p>in which Einstein&rsquo;s equations no longer applied.</p>
<p>So to you, the edges of the theory are wonderful.</p>
<p>The failures of the theory.</p>
<p>Edges are wonderful because that keeps us in business.</p>
<p>So one of the things you said I think in your TED Talk</p>
<p>that the fact that quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and relativity don&rsquo;t describe everything</p>
<p>and then they clash is wonderful.</p>
<p>I forget the adjective you used,</p>
<p>but it was something like this.</p>
<p>So why is that?</p>
<p>Why is that interesting?</p>
<p>Do you in that same way</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s contradictions that create discovery?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question in my mind,</p>
<p>of course many people would disagree with me,</p>
<p>that now is the most wonderful time to be a physicist.</p>
<p>So people look back at,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a classical thing to say among physicists,</p>
<p>I wish it were 1920.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics had been just understood.</p>
<p>There was the periodic table.</p>
<p>There was, but in fact, that was such a rich thing</p>
<p>that, well, so a lot of exciting stuff happened around 1920.</p>
<p>It took a whole century</p>
<p>to sort out the new insights that we got.</p>
<p>Especially adding some experimental stuff</p>
<p>into the bunch, actually making observations</p>
<p>and integrating all the data.</p>
<p>Adding the experimental thing.</p>
<p>Computers also help with visualizations</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It was a whole sort of wonderful century.</p>
<p>I mean, the seed of general relativity</p>
<p>was the incompatibility of Maxwell&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic field</p>
<p>with Newton&rsquo;s laws of gravity.</p>
<p>They were incompatible</p>
<p>because if you look at Maxwell&rsquo;s theory,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a contradiction</p>
<p>if anything goes faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>But Newton&rsquo;s theory of gravity,</p>
<p>the gravitational field,</p>
<p>the gravitational force,</p>
<p>is instantaneously transmitted across the entire universe.</p>
<p>So you could, if you had a friend on,</p>
<p>in another galaxy with a very sensitive measuring device</p>
<p>that could measure the gravitational field,</p>
<p>they could just take this cup of coffee</p>
<p>and move it up and down in Morse code</p>
<p>and they could get the message instantaneously</p>
<p>over another galaxy.</p>
<p>That leads to all kinds of contradictions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not self-consistent.</p>
<p>It was exactly in resolving those contradictions</p>
<p>that Einstein came up with the general theory</p>
<p>of relativity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating how this contradiction,</p>
<p>which seems like maybe it&rsquo;s kind of technical thing,</p>
<p>led to a whole new vision of the universe.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s not get fooled</p>
<p>because lots of contradictions are technical things.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t set up the,</p>
<p>we run into other kinds of contradictions</p>
<p>that are technical and they don&rsquo;t seem to,</p>
<p>we understood something wrong,</p>
<p>we made a mistake,</p>
<p>we set up our equations in the wrong way,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t translate the formalisms.</p>
<p>As opposed to revealing some deep mystery</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s yet to be uncovered.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re never very sure</p>
<p>which are the really important ones.</p>
<p>But to you, the difference between quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and general relativity,</p>
<p>the tension, the contradiction there</p>
<p>seems to hint at some deeper, deeper thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be discovered in the century.</p>
<p>Yes, because that one has been understood since the 50s.</p>
<p>Pauli was the first person to notice it</p>
<p>and Hawking in the early 70s</p>
<p>gave it a really much more visceral form.</p>
<p>And people have been hurling themselves at it,</p>
<p>trying to reduce it to some technicality,</p>
<p>but nobody has succeeded.</p>
<p>And the efforts to understand it</p>
<p>have led to all kinds of interesting relations</p>
<p>between quantum systems</p>
<p>and applications to other fields and so on.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s actually jump around.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll return to black holes,</p>
<p>I have a million questions there,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s go into this unification,</p>
<p>the battle against the contradictions</p>
<p>and the tensions between the theories of physics.</p>
<p>What is quantum gravity?</p>
<p>Maybe what is the standard model of physics?</p>
<p>What is quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>What is general relativity?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s quantum gravity?</p>
<p>What are all the different unification efforts?</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>Again, five questions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a theory that describes everything</p>
<p>with astonishing accuracy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most accurate theory</p>
<p>in the history of human thought.</p>
<p>Theory and experiment have been successfully compared</p>
<p>to 16 decimal place.</p>
<p>We have that stenciled on the door where I work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing feat of the human mind.</p>
<p>It describes the electromagnetic interaction,</p>
<p>unifies the electromagnetic interaction</p>
<p>with the so-called weak interaction,</p>
<p>which you need some good tools</p>
<p>to even view the weak interaction.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the strong interaction,</p>
<p>which binds the quarks into protons.</p>
<p>And the forces between them are mediated</p>
<p>by something called Yang-Mills theory,</p>
<p>which is a beautiful mathematical generalization</p>
<p>of electromagnetism in which the analogs</p>
<p>of the photons themselves carry charge.</p>
<p>And so this, the final piece of this,</p>
<p>of the standard model, everything in the standard model</p>
<p>has been observed.</p>
<p>Its properties have been measured.</p>
<p>The final particle to be observed was the Higgs particle,</p>
<p>observed like over a decade ago.</p>
<p>Oh, Higgs is already a decade ago.</p>
<p>I think it is, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow, time flies.</p>
<p>But you better check me on that, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but so much fun has been happening.</p>
<p>So much fun has been happening.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s all pretty well understood</p>
<p>There are some things that might or might not,</p>
<p>around the edges of that, dark matter,</p>
<p>neutrino masses, some sort of fine points</p>
<p>or things we haven&rsquo;t quite measured perfectly and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s largely a very complete theory.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t expect anything very new coming out</p>
<p>conceptually in the completion of that.</p>
<p>Anything contradictory by new,</p>
<p>because can&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Anything contradictory, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have some wild questions for you on that front.</p>
<p>But yeah, anything that, yeah,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no gaps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so accurate, so precise in its predictions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to imagine something.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And it was all based on something called,</p>
<p>let me not explain what it is,</p>
<p>let me just throw out the buzzword,</p>
<p>renormalizable quantum field theory.</p>
<p>They all fall in the category</p>
<p>of renormalizable quantum field theory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna throw that at a bar later to impress the girls.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>They all fall under that rubric.</p>
<p>Gravity will not put that suit on.</p>
<p>So the force of gravity cannot be tamed</p>
<p>by the same renormalizable quantum field theory</p>
<p>to which all the other forces so eagerly submitted.</p>
<p>What is the effort of quantum gravity?</p>
<p>What are the different efforts</p>
<p>to have these two dance together effectively,</p>
<p>to try to unify the standard model</p>
<p>and general relativity, any kind of model of gravity?</p>
<p>Sort of the one fully consistent model that we have</p>
<p>that reconciles, that sort of tames gravity</p>
<p>and reconciles it with quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is string theory and its cousins.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know what or if in any sense</p>
<p>string theory describes the world, the physical world,</p>
<p>but we do know that it is a consistent reconciliation</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics and general relativity</p>
<p>and moreover one which is able to incorporate</p>
<p>particles and forces like the ones we see around us.</p>
<p>So it hasn&rsquo;t been ruled out as an actual</p>
<p>sort of unified theory of nature,</p>
<p>but there also isn&rsquo;t a, in my view,</p>
<p>some people would disagree with me,</p>
<p>but there isn&rsquo;t a reasonable possibility</p>
<p>that we would be able to do an experiment</p>
<p>in the foreseeable future which would be</p>
<p>sort of a yes or no to string theory.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;ve been there from the early days</p>
<p>of string theory, you&rsquo;ve seen its developments.</p>
<p>What are some interesting developments?</p>
<p>What do you see as also the future of string theory?</p>
<p>And what is string theory?</p>
<p>Well, the basic idea which emerged in the early 70s</p>
<p>was that if you take the notion of a particle</p>
<p>and you literally replace it by a little loop of string,</p>
<p>the strings are sort of softer than particles.</p>
<p>What do you mean by softer?</p>
<p>Well, you know, if you hit a particle,</p>
<p>if there were a particle on this table, a big one,</p>
<p>and you hit it, you might bruise yourself.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But if there was a string on the table,</p>
<p>you would probably just push it around.</p>
<p>And the source of the infinities in quantum field theory</p>
<p>is that when particles hit each other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a jarring effect.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never described it this way before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually scientifically accurate.</p>
<p>But if you throw strings at each other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little more friendly.</p>
<p>One thing I can&rsquo;t explain is how wonderfully precise,</p>
<p>well, the mathematics is that goes</p>
<p>into describing string theory.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just wave our hands and throw strings around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some very compelling mathematical equations</p>
<p>that describe it.</p>
<p>Now, what was realized in the early 70s</p>
<p>is that if you replace particles by strings,</p>
<p>these infinities go away,</p>
<p>and you get a consistent theory of gravity</p>
<p>without the infinities.</p>
<p>And that may sound a little trivial,</p>
<p>but at that point, it had already been 15 years</p>
<p>that people had been searching around</p>
<p>for any kind of theory that could do this.</p>
<p>And it was actually found kind of by accident.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of accidental discoveries</p>
<p>in this subject.</p>
<p>Now, at the same time,</p>
<p>it was believed then that string theory</p>
<p>was an interesting sort of toy model</p>
<p>for putting quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and general relativity together on paper,</p>
<p>but that it couldn&rsquo;t describe</p>
<p>some of the very idiosyncratic phenomena</p>
<p>that pertain to our own universe,</p>
<p>in particular, the form of so-called parity violation.</p>
<p>Our world is-</p>
<p>Ooh, another term for the bar later tonight.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Parity violation.</p>
<p>So if you go to the bar and-</p>
<p>I already got the renormalizable quantum field theory.</p>
<p>And you look in the mirror across the bar.</p>
<p>The universe that you see in the mirror is not identical.</p>
<p>You would be able to tell,</p>
<p>if you show the lady in the bar,</p>
<p>a photograph that shows both the mirror and you,</p>
<p>if she&rsquo;s smart enough,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll be able to tell which one is the real world</p>
<p>and which one is you.</p>
<p>Now, she would have to do some very precise measurements.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And if the photograph was too grainy,</p>
<p>it might not be possible,</p>
<p>but a principle is possible.</p>
<p>Why is this interesting?</p>
<p>Why is it?</p>
<p>Does this mean that there is some not perfect determinism?</p>
<p>Or what does that mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some uncertainty?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a very interesting feature of the real world</p>
<p>that it isn&rsquo;t parity invariant.</p>
<p>In string theory, it was thought could not tolerate that.</p>
<p>And then it was learned in the mid 80s</p>
<p>that not only could it tolerate that,</p>
<p>but if you did things in the right way,</p>
<p>you could construct a world involving strings</p>
<p>that reconciled quantum mechanics and general relativity,</p>
<p>which looked more or less like the world that we live in.</p>
<p>And now, that isn&rsquo;t to say</p>
<p>that string theory predicted our world.</p>
<p>It just meant that it was consistent,</p>
<p>that the hypothesis that string theory describes our world</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be ruled out from the get-go.</p>
<p>And it is also the only proposal for a complete theory</p>
<p>that would describe our world.</p>
<p>Still, nobody will believe it</p>
<p>until there&rsquo;s some kind of direct experiment.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even believe it myself.</p>
<p>Sure, which is a good place to be mentally</p>
<p>as a physicist, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Einstein didn&rsquo;t believe his own equations, right?</p>
<p>With the black hole.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, then, when he was wrong about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have it, but he was wrong about that.</p>
<p>But you might be wrong, too, right?</p>
<p>So, do you think string theory is dead</p>
<p>if you were to bet all your money</p>
<p>on the future of string theory?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a logical error</p>
<p>to think that string theory is either right or wrong</p>
<p>or dead or alive.</p>
<p>What it is is a stepping stone.</p>
<p>And an analogy I like to draw is Yang-Mills theory,</p>
<p>which I mentioned a few minutes ago</p>
<p>in the context of standard model.</p>
<p>Yang-Mills theory was discovered by Yang and Mills</p>
<p>in the 50s, and they thought that the symmetry</p>
<p>of Yang and Mills theory described the relationship</p>
<p>between the proton and the neutron.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they invented it.</p>
<p>That turned out to be completely wrong.</p>
<p>It does, however, describe everything else</p>
<p>in the standard model.</p>
<p>And it had a kind of inevitability.</p>
<p>They had some of the right pieces, but not the other ones.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t have it quite in the right context.</p>
<p>It had an inevitability to it,</p>
<p>and it eventually sort of found its place.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also true of Einstein&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>of general relativity.</p>
<p>He had the wrong version of it in 1914,</p>
<p>and he was missing some pieces.</p>
<p>And you wouldn&rsquo;t say that his early version</p>
<p>was right or wrong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d understood the equivalence principle.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d understood spacetime curvature.</p>
<p>He just didn&rsquo;t have everything.</p>
<p>I mean, technically, you would have to say it was wrong.</p>
<p>And technically, you would have to say</p>
<p>Yang and Mills were wrong.</p>
<p>And I guess in that sense, I would believe just odds are.</p>
<p>We always keep finding new wrinkles.</p>
<p>Odds are we&rsquo;re gonna find new wrinkles in string theory,</p>
<p>and technically, what we call string theory now</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t quite right, but.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always going to be wrong,</p>
<p>but hopefully a little bit less wrong every time.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I would bet the farm, as they say.</p>
<p>Do you have a farm?</p>
<p>I say that much more seriously,</p>
<p>because not only do I have a farm,</p>
<p>but we just renovated it.</p>
<p>So before I renovated it.</p>
<p>So before I renovated, betting at the farm,</p>
<p>my wife and I spent five years renovating it before I.</p>
<p>You were much looser with that statement,</p>
<p>but now it really means something.</p>
<p>Now it really means something.</p>
<p>And I would bet the farm on the,</p>
<p>on the guess that 100 years from now,</p>
<p>string theory will be viewed as a stepping stone</p>
<p>towards a greater understanding of nature.</p>
<p>And it would, I mean, another thing that I didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>about string theory is, of course,</p>
<p>we knew that it solved the infinities problem,</p>
<p>and then we later learned that it also solved</p>
<p>Hawking&rsquo;s puzzle about what&rsquo;s inside of a black hole.</p>
<p>And you put in one assumption, you get five things out,</p>
<p>somehow you&rsquo;re doing something right, you know?</p>
<p>Probably not everything, but you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some good signposts.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been a lot of good signposts like that.</p>
<p>It is also a mathematical toolkit, and you&rsquo;ve used it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve used it with Kamran Vafa.</p>
<p>Maybe we can sneak our way back</p>
<p>from string theory into black holes.</p>
<p>What was the idea that you and Kamran Vafa developed</p>
<p>with the holographic principle and string theory?</p>
<p>What were you able to discover through string theory</p>
<p>about black holes, or that connects us back</p>
<p>to the reality of black holes?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that is a very interesting story.</p>
<p>I was interested in black holes</p>
<p>before I was interested in string theory.</p>
<p>I was sort of a reluctant string theorist in the beginning.</p>
<p>I thought I had to learn it</p>
<p>because people were talking about it,</p>
<p>but once I studied it, I grew to love it.</p>
<p>First, I did it in a sort of dutiful way.</p>
<p>These people say they&rsquo;ve claimed quantum gravity.</p>
<p>I ought to read their papers, at least.</p>
<p>And then the more I read them, the more interested I got,</p>
<p>and I begin to see, they phrased it in a very clumsy way.</p>
<p>The description of string theory was very clumsy.</p>
<p>Mathematically clumsy, or just the interpretation?</p>
<p>Mathematically clumsy, yeah.</p>
<p>It was all correct, but mathematically clumsy.</p>
<p>But it often happens that in all kinds of branches</p>
<p>of physics that people start working on it really hard</p>
<p>and they sort of dream about it and live it and breathe it,</p>
<p>and they begin to see inner relationships,</p>
<p>and they see a beauty that is really there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not deceived.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really seeing something that exists,</p>
<p>but if you just kind of look at it,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t grasp it all in the beginning.</p>
<p>So our understanding of string theory</p>
<p>in 1985 was almost all about</p>
<p>weakly coupled waves of strings colliding and so on.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know how to describe a big thing,</p>
<p>like a black hole in string theory.</p>
<p>Of course, we could show that strings in theory</p>
<p>in some limit reproduced Einstein&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>of general relativity and corrected it,</p>
<p>but we couldn&rsquo;t do any better with black holes</p>
<p>than before my work with Kuhnmann,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t do any better than Einstein</p>
<p>and Schwarzschild had done.</p>
<p>Now, one of the puzzles,</p>
<p>if you look at the Hawking&rsquo;s headstone</p>
<p>and also Boltzmann&rsquo;s headstone,</p>
<p>and you put them together,</p>
<p>you get a formula for,</p>
<p>and they are really central equations</p>
<p>in 20th century physics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there are many equations</p>
<p>that made it to headstones.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really central equations,</p>
<p>and you put them together and you get a formula</p>
<p>for the number of gigabytes in a black hole.</p>
<p>Now, in Schwarzschild&rsquo;s description,</p>
<p>the black hole is literally a hole in space</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no place to store the gigabytes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not too hard to,</p>
<p>and this really was Wheeler and Bekenstein,</p>
<p>Wheeler, Bekenstein, and Hawking,</p>
<p>to come to the conclusion that if there isn&rsquo;t a sense</p>
<p>in which a black hole can store</p>
<p>some large number of gigabytes,</p>
<p>that quantum mechanics and gravity can&rsquo;t be consistent.</p>
<p>We gotta go there a little bit.</p>
<p>So how is it possible,</p>
<p>when we say gigabytes, so there&rsquo;s some information,</p>
<p>so black holes can store information.</p>
<p>How is this thing that sucks up all light</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s supposed to basically be super homogeneous</p>
<p>and boring, how is that actually able to store information?</p>
<p>Where does it store information?</p>
<p>On the inside, on the surface?</p>
<p>Where, where is, and what&rsquo;s information?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m liking this ask five questions</p>
<p>to see which one you actually answer.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So if you say that, I should try to memorize them</p>
<p>and answer each one in order, just to answer them.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m desperately trying to figure it out as we go along here.</p>
<p>So Einstein&rsquo;s black hole, Schwarzschild&rsquo;s black hole,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t store information.</p>
<p>Stuff goes in there and it just keeps flying</p>
<p>and it goes to the singularity and it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>However, Einstein&rsquo;s theory is not exact.</p>
<p>It has corrections.</p>
<p>And string theory tells you what those corrections are.</p>
<p>And so you should be able to find some way of,</p>
<p>some alternate way of describing the black hole</p>
<p>that enables you to understand</p>
<p>where the gigabytes are stored.</p>
<p>So what Hawking and Bekenstein really did</p>
<p>was they showed that physics is inconsistent</p>
<p>unless a black hole can store a number of gigabytes</p>
<p>proportional to its area divided by four times</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s constant times Planck&rsquo;s constant.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another wild idea.</p>
<p>You said area, not volume.</p>
<p>Exactly, and that&rsquo;s the holographic principle.</p>
<p>The universe is so weird.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the holographic principle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called the holographic principle, that it&rsquo;s the area.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just jumping around.</p>
<p>What is the holographic principle?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Is there some kind of weird projection going on?</p>
<p>What the heck?</p>
<p>Well, I was just before I came here</p>
<p>writing an introduction to a paper</p>
<p>and the first sentence was the as yet imprecisely defined</p>
<p>holographic principle, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So nobody knows exactly what it is,</p>
<p>but roughly speaking, it says just what we were alluding to</p>
<p>that really all the information</p>
<p>that is in some volume of space-time</p>
<p>can be stored on the boundary of that region.</p>
<p>So this is not just about black holes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about any area of space-time.</p>
<p>Any area of space-time.</p>
<p>However, we&rsquo;ve made sense of the holographic principle</p>
<p>for black holes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made sense of the holographic principle</p>
<p>for something which could be called anti-de Sitter space,</p>
<p>which could be thought of as a giant,</p>
<p>as a black hole turned into a whole universe.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really understand how to talk</p>
<p>about the holographic principle for either flat space,</p>
<p>which we appear to live in,</p>
<p>or asymptotically de Sitter space,</p>
<p>which astronomers tell us we actually live in</p>
<p>as the universe continues to expand.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of the huge problems in physics</p>
<p>is to apply or even formulate the holographic principle</p>
<p>for more realistic, well, black holes are realistic.</p>
<p>We see them.</p>
<p>But yeah, in more general context.</p>
<p>So a more general statement of the holographic principle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between flat space</p>
<p>and asymptotic de Sitter space?</p>
<p>So flat space is just an approximation</p>
<p>of the world we live in.</p>
<p>So like de Sitter space, asymptotic,</p>
<p>I wonder what that even means,</p>
<p>meaning like asymptotic over what?</p>
<p>Okay, so for thousands of years,</p>
<p>until the last half of the 20th,</p>
<p>well, sorry, until the 20th century,</p>
<p>we thought spacetime was flat.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on flat?</p>
<p>What do we mean by flat?</p>
<p>Well, like the surface of this table is flat.</p>
<p>Let me just give an intuitive explanation.</p>
<p>Surface of the table is flat,</p>
<p>but the surface of a basketball is curved.</p>
<p>So the universe itself could be flat</p>
<p>like the surface of a table,</p>
<p>or it could be curved like a basketball,</p>
<p>which actually has a positive curvature.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another kind of curvature</p>
<p>called the negative curvature.</p>
<p>And curvature can be even weirder</p>
<p>because that kind of curvature I&rsquo;ve just described</p>
<p>is the curvature of space,</p>
<p>but Einstein taught us that we really live</p>
<p>in a spacetime continuum,</p>
<p>so we can have curvature in a way</p>
<p>that mixes up space and time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of hard to visualize.</p>
<p>Because you have to step, what, a couple of dimensions up,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s hard to?</p>
<p>You have to step a couple,</p>
<p>but even if you have flat space</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s expanding in time,</p>
<p>you know, we could imagine we&rsquo;re sitting here,</p>
<p>this room, good approximation, it&rsquo;s flat,</p>
<p>but imagine we suddenly start getting</p>
<p>further and further apart.</p>
<p>Then space is flat,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s expanding,</p>
<p>which means that spacetime is curved.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s about spacetime.</p>
<p>Okay, so what&rsquo;s de Sitter and anti-de Sitter space?</p>
<p>The three simplest spacetimes are flat spacetime,</p>
<p>which we call Minkowski spacetime,</p>
<p>and negatively curved spacetime, anti-de Sitter space,</p>
<p>and positively curved spacetime, de Sitter space.</p>
<p>And so astronomers think that on large scales,</p>
<p>on large scales, even though for thousands of years</p>
<p>we hadn&rsquo;t noticed it, beginning with Hubble,</p>
<p>we started to notice that spacetime was curved.</p>
<p>Space is expanding in time means that spacetime is curved.</p>
<p>And the nature of this curvature</p>
<p>is affected by the matter in it,</p>
<p>because matter itself causes the curvature of spacetime.</p>
<p>But as it expands, the matter gets more and more diluted.</p>
<p>And one might ask, when it&rsquo;s all diluted away,</p>
<p>is spacetime still curved?</p>
<p>And astronomers believe they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>precise enough measurements to determine this,</p>
<p>and they believe that the answer is yes.</p>
<p>The universe is now expanding.</p>
<p>Eventually, all the matter in it</p>
<p>will be expanded away,</p>
<p>but it will continue to expand</p>
<p>because, well, they would call it the dark energy.</p>
<p>Einstein would call it a cosmological constant.</p>
<p>In any case, in the far future,</p>
<p>matter will be expanded away</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be left with empty de Sitter space.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s this cosmological,</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s cosmological constant</p>
<p>that now hides this thing that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>called dark energy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s dark energy?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your best guess at what this thing is?</p>
<p>Why do we think it&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it comes from the astronomers.</p>
<p>Dark energy is synonymous</p>
<p>with positive cosmological constant.</p>
<p>And we think it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>because the astronomers have told us it&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>and they know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really, really hard measurement,</p>
<p>but they really know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And we have no friggin&rsquo; idea why it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Another big mystery.</p>
<p>Another reason it&rsquo;s fun to be a physicist.</p>
<p>And if it is there, why should it be so small?</p>
<p>Why should there be so little?</p>
<p>Why should it have hid itself from us?</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t there be enough of it</p>
<p>to substantially curve the space</p>
<p>between us and the moon?</p>
<p>Why did there have to be such a small amount</p>
<p>that only the crazy best astronomers</p>
<p>in the world could find it?</p>
<p>Well, can&rsquo;t the same thing be said</p>
<p>about all the constants?</p>
<p>All of the, can&rsquo;t that be said about gravity?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t that be said about the speed of light?</p>
<p>Like, why is the speed of light so slow?</p>
<p>So fast.</p>
<p>So slow.</p>
<p>Relative to the size of the universe, can&rsquo;t it be faster?</p>
<p>Or no?</p>
<p>Well, the speed of light is a funny one,</p>
<p>because you could always choose units</p>
<p>in which the speed of light is one.</p>
<p>You know, we measure it in kilometers per second,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s 186,000, or miles per second.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 186,000 miles per second.</p>
<p>But if we had used different units,</p>
<p>then we could make it one.</p>
<p>But you can make dimensionless ratios.</p>
<p>So, you know, you could say,</p>
<p>why is the time scale set by the expansion of the universe</p>
<p>so large compared to the time scale of a human life,</p>
<p>or so large compared to the time scale</p>
<p>for a neutron to decay?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, ultimately, the reference frame,</p>
<p>the temporal reference frame here is a human life.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the important thing for us descendants of apes?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a really important aspect of physics?</p>
<p>Like, because we kind of experience the world,</p>
<p>we intuit the world through the eyes</p>
<p>of these biological organisms.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess mathematics helps you escape that</p>
<p>for a time, but ultimately,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that how you wander about the world?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That like a human life time is only 100 years?</p>
<p>Because if you think of everything,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re able to think in, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>in billions of years,</p>
<p>then maybe everything looks way different.</p>
<p>Maybe universes are born and die,</p>
<p>and maybe all of these physical phenomena</p>
<p>become much more intuitive than we see</p>
<p>at the grand scale of general relativity.</p>
<p>Well, that is one of the, a little off the track here,</p>
<p>but that certainly is one of the nice things</p>
<p>about being a physicist,</p>
<p>is you spend a lot of time thinking about, you know,</p>
<p>insides of black holes and billions of years in the future,</p>
<p>and it sort of gets you away from the day-to-day</p>
<p>into another fantastic realm.</p>
<p>But I was answering your question about</p>
<p>how there could be information in a black hole.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So Einstein only gave us an approximate description,</p>
<p>and we now have a theory that corrects it, string theory.</p>
<p>And now sort of was the moment of truth.</p>
<p>Well, when we first discovered string theory,</p>
<p>we knew from the get-go that string theory</p>
<p>would correct what Einstein said,</p>
<p>just like Einstein corrected what Newton said.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t understand it well enough</p>
<p>to actually compute the correction,</p>
<p>to compute how many gigabytes there were.</p>
<p>And sometime in the early 90s,</p>
<p>we began to understand the mathematics of string theory</p>
<p>better and better, and it came to the point</p>
<p>where it was clear that this was something</p>
<p>we might be able to compute.</p>
<p>And it was a kind of moment of truth for string theory</p>
<p>because if it hadn&rsquo;t given the answer,</p>
<p>that Bekenstein and Hawking said it</p>
<p>had to give for consistency,</p>
<p>string theory itself would have been inconsistent</p>
<p>and we wouldn&rsquo;t be doing this interview.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very dramatic statement, but yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the most dramatic thing.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, that&rsquo;s very life and death.</p>
<p>You mean like that because string theory</p>
<p>was central to your work at that time.</p>
<p>Is that what you mean?</p>
<p>Well, string theory would have been inconsistent.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So string theory would have been inconsistent.</p>
<p>But those inconsistencies can give birth</p>
<p>to other theories, like you said.</p>
<p>The inconsistency, right.</p>
<p>Something else could have happened.</p>
<p>It would have been a major change</p>
<p>in the way we think about string theory.</p>
<p>And it was a good thing that one supposition</p>
<p>that the world is made of strings solves two problems,</p>
<p>not one.</p>
<p>It solves the infinity problem</p>
<p>and it solved the Hawking&rsquo;s problem.</p>
<p>And also the way that it did it was very beautiful.</p>
<p>It gave an alternate description.</p>
<p>So alternate description of things are very common.</p>
<p>I mean, we could, to take a simple example,</p>
<p>this bottle of water here is 90% full.</p>
<p>I could say it&rsquo;s 90% full.</p>
<p>I could also say it&rsquo;s 10% empty.</p>
<p>Those are obviously the same statement.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s trivial to see that they&rsquo;re the same,</p>
<p>but there are many statements that can be made</p>
<p>in mathematics and mathematical physics</p>
<p>that are equivalent, but might take years</p>
<p>to understand that they&rsquo;re equivalent</p>
<p>and might take the invention or discovery</p>
<p>of whole new fields of mathematics</p>
<p>to prove they&rsquo;re equivalent.</p>
<p>And this was one of those.</p>
<p>We found an alternate description</p>
<p>of certain black holes in string theory,</p>
<p>which we could prove was equivalent.</p>
<p>And it was a description of the black hole</p>
<p>as a hologram that can be thought of a holographic plate</p>
<p>that could be thought of as sitting</p>
<p>on the surface of the black hole.</p>
<p>And the interior of the black hole itself</p>
<p>sort of arises as a projection</p>
<p>or the near horizon region of the black hole</p>
<p>arises as a projection of that holographic plate.</p>
<p>So the two descriptions were the hologram,</p>
<p>the three-dimensional image, and the holographic plate.</p>
<p>And the hologram is what Einstein discovered</p>
<p>and the holographic plate is what we discovered.</p>
<p>And this idea that you could describe things</p>
<p>very, very concretely in string theory</p>
<p>in these two different languages, of course, took off</p>
<p>and was applied to many different contexts.</p>
<p>Within string theory.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the infinity problem</p>
<p>and the Hawking problem.</p>
<p>Which Hawking problem?</p>
<p>That the black hole destroys information</p>
<p>or which Hawking problem are we talking about?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s really two Hawking problems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very closely related.</p>
<p>One is how does the black hole store the information?</p>
<p>And that is the one that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>we solved in some cases.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like, you know, your smartphone,</p>
<p>how does it store its 64 gigabytes?</p>
<p>Well, you rip the cover off and you count the chips</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s 64 of them, each with a gigabyte.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s 64 gigabytes.</p>
<p>But that does not solve the problem</p>
<p>of how you get information in and out of your smartphone.</p>
<p>You have to understand a lot more about the Wi-Fi</p>
<p>and the internet and the cellular and-</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where Hawking radiation,</p>
<p>this prediction, it starts to-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Hawking radiation comes in.</p>
<p>And that problem of how the information gets in and out,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t, you couldn&rsquo;t have explained</p>
<p>how information gets in and out of an iPhone</p>
<p>without first explaining how it&rsquo;s stored</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>So just to clarify, the storage is on the plate?</p>
<p>Is on the plate.</p>
<p>On the holographic plate</p>
<p>and then it projects somehow inside the-</p>
<p>The bulk, the space time is the hologram.</p>
<p>The hologram, man, I mean, do you have an intuitive,</p>
<p>when you sit late at night and you stare at the stars,</p>
<p>do you have an intuitive understanding</p>
<p>what a holographic plate is?</p>
<p>Like that there&rsquo;s two dimension,</p>
<p>no projections that store information?</p>
<p>How a black hole could store information</p>
<p>on a holographic plate, I think we do understand</p>
<p>in great mathematical detail and also intuitively.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very much like an ordinary hologram</p>
<p>where you have a holographic plate</p>
<p>and it contains all the information.</p>
<p>You shine a light through it and you get an image</p>
<p>which looks three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Yeah, but why should there be a holographic plate?</p>
<p>Why should there be?</p>
<p>Yeah, why?</p>
<p>That is the great thing about being a theoretical physicist</p>
<p>is anybody can very quickly stump you</p>
<p>with a going to the next level of whys.</p>
<p>Yeah, whys is kind of, oh, I can just keep asking, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could just keep asking</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t take you very long to.</p>
<p>So the trick in being a theoretical physics</p>
<p>is finding the questions that you can answer.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So the questions that we think</p>
<p>we might be able to answer now</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve partially answered</p>
<p>is that there is a holographic explanation</p>
<p>for certain kinds of things in string theory.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve answered that.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;d like to take what we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve mostly been doing</p>
<p>for the last 15, 20 years.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really been working so much</p>
<p>on string theory proper.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sort of taking the lessons</p>
<p>that we learned in string theory</p>
<p>and trying to apply them to the real world</p>
<p>assuming only what we know for sure about the real world.</p>
<p>So on this topic, you co-authored a paper</p>
<p>with Stephen Hawking called Soft Hair on Black Holes</p>
<p>that makes the argument</p>
<p>against Hawking&rsquo;s original prediction</p>
<p>that black holes destroy information.</p>
<p>Can you explain this paper?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the title.</p>
<p>Okay, so first of all,</p>
<p>the hair on black holes is a word</p>
<p>that was coined by the greatest phrase master</p>
<p>in the history of physics, John Wheeler,</p>
<p>invented the word black hole.</p>
<p>And he also said that he made the statement</p>
<p>that black holes have no hair.</p>
<p>That is, every black hole in the universe</p>
<p>is described just by its mass and spin.</p>
<p>They can also rotate as was later shown by Kerr.</p>
<p>And this is very much unlike a star, right?</p>
<p>Every star of the same mass is different</p>
<p>in a multitude of different ways.</p>
<p>Different chemical compositions,</p>
<p>different motions of the individual molecules.</p>
<p>Every star in the universe, even of the same mass,</p>
<p>is different in many, many different ways.</p>
<p>Black holes are all the same.</p>
<p>And that means when you throw something,</p>
<p>in Einstein&rsquo;s description of them,</p>
<p>which we think must be corrected.</p>
<p>And if you throw something into a black hole,</p>
<p>it gets sucked in.</p>
<p>And if you throw in a red book or a blue book,</p>
<p>the black hole gets a little bigger,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no way within Einstein&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>of telling how they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>And that was one of the assumptions</p>
<p>that Hawking made in his 1974, 75 papers,</p>
<p>in which he concluded that black holes destroy information.</p>
<p>You can throw encyclopedias, thesis defenses,</p>
<p>the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to behave exactly the same uniform way.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what Hawking and I showed,</p>
<p>and also Malcolm Perry,</p>
<p>is that one has to be very careful</p>
<p>about what happens at the boundary of the black hole.</p>
<p>And this gets back to something I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>about when two things which are related</p>
<p>by a coordinate transformation are and are not equivalent.</p>
<p>And what we showed is that there are very subtle imprints</p>
<p>when you throw something into a black hole.</p>
<p>There are very subtle imprints left</p>
<p>on the horizon of the black hole,</p>
<p>which you can read off at least partially what went in.</p>
<p>And so this invalidates</p>
<p>Stephen&rsquo;s original argument</p>
<p>that the information is destroyed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the soft hair, those imprints.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the soft hair, right.</p>
<p>And soft is a word that is used in physics</p>
<p>for things which have very low energy.</p>
<p>And these things actually carry no energy.</p>
<p>There are things in the universe which carry no energy.</p>
<p>You said, I think to Sean Carroll,</p>
<p>by the way, everyone should go check out</p>
<p>Sean Carroll&rsquo;s Mindscape podcast, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And Sean Carroll&rsquo;s an incredible person.</p>
<p>I think you said there, maybe in a paper, I have a quote.</p>
<p>You said that a soft particle is a particle</p>
<p>that has zero energy, just like you said now.</p>
<p>And when the energy goes to zero,</p>
<p>because the energy is proportionate to the wavelength,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also spread over an infinitely large distance.</p>
<p>If you like, it&rsquo;s spread over the whole universe.</p>
<p>It somehow runs off to the boundary.</p>
<p>What we learned from that is that</p>
<p>if you add a zero energy particle to the vacuum,</p>
<p>you get a new state.</p>
<p>And so there are infinitely many vacua,</p>
<p>plural for vacuum, which can be thought of</p>
<p>as being different from one another</p>
<p>by the addition of soft photons or soft gravitons.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on this wild idea?</p>
<p>If you like, it spreads over the whole universe.</p>
<p>When the energy goes to zero,</p>
<p>because the energy is proportionate to the wavelength,</p>
<p>it also spreads over an infinitely large distance.</p>
<p>If you like, it&rsquo;s spread over the whole universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spread over the whole universe.</p>
<p>Can you explain these soft gravitons and photons?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the soft gravitons and photons</p>
<p>have been known about since the 60s.</p>
<p>But exactly what we&rsquo;re supposed to do with them</p>
<p>or how we&rsquo;re supposed to think about them</p>
<p>I think has been well understood only recently.</p>
<p>And in quantum mechanics, the energy of a particle</p>
<p>is proportional to Planck&rsquo;s constant times its wavelength.</p>
<p>So when the energy goes to zero,</p>
<p>the wavelength goes to infinity.</p>
<p>Now, if something has zero energy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s spread all over the universe,</p>
<p>in what sense is it actually there?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been the confusing thing,</p>
<p>to make a precise statement</p>
<p>about when something is and isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Now, the simplest way of seeing,</p>
<p>so people might have taken the point of view</p>
<p>that if it has zero energy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s spread all over the universe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not there, we can ignore it.</p>
<p>But if you do this, you&rsquo;ll get into trouble.</p>
<p>And one of the ways that you&rsquo;ll get into trouble</p>
<p>is that even though it has zero energy,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have zero angular momentum.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a photon, it always has angular momentum one.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a graviton, it&rsquo;s angular momentum two.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t say that the state of the system</p>
<p>with the zero energy photon</p>
<p>should be identified with the one</p>
<p>without the zero energy photon,</p>
<p>that we can just ignore them,</p>
<p>because then you will conclude</p>
<p>that angular momentum is not conserved.</p>
<p>And if angular momentum is not conserved,</p>
<p>things won&rsquo;t be consistent.</p>
<p>And of course, you can have a lot of these things,</p>
<p>and typically you do get a lot of them.</p>
<p>And when you, you can actually do a calculation</p>
<p>that shows that every time you scatter two particles,</p>
<p>you create an infinite number of them.</p>
<p>Infinite number of the soft photons and gravitons.</p>
<p>Of the zero energy ones, yeah.</p>
<p>And so these are, and they&rsquo;re somehow everywhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>But they also contain information,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re able to store information.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to store information.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to store</p>
<p>an arbitrary large amount of information.</p>
<p>So what we pointed out is,</p>
<p>so what these things really do,</p>
<p>one way of thinking of them</p>
<p>is they rush off to the edges of the universe,</p>
<p>spreading out all over the space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying they rush off</p>
<p>to the energy edge of the universe.</p>
<p>And that includes, if the interior of the black hole</p>
<p>is not considered part of the universe,</p>
<p>that includes the edge of the black hole.</p>
<p>So we need to set up our description of physics</p>
<p>so that all the things that are conserved</p>
<p>are still conserved in the way that we&rsquo;re describing them.</p>
<p>And that will not be true if we ignore these things.</p>
<p>We have to keep careful track of these things.</p>
<p>And people had been sloppy about that.</p>
<p>And we learned how to be very precise and careful about it.</p>
<p>And this, and once you&rsquo;re being precise,</p>
<p>you can actually, that makes,</p>
<p>you can actually answer this kind of very problematic thing</p>
<p>that Hawking suggested, that black holes destroy information.</p>
<p>Well, what we showed is that there&rsquo;s an error</p>
<p>in the argument that all black holes are the same</p>
<p>because they hadn&rsquo;t kept track of these,</p>
<p>these very subtle things.</p>
<p>And whether or not this is the key error</p>
<p>in the argument remains to be seen,</p>
<p>or whether this is a technical point.</p>
<p>Yes, but it is an error.</p>
<p>It is an error.</p>
<p>And Hawking obviously agreed with it.</p>
<p>Hawking agreed with it, and he was sure that this was the,</p>
<p>he was sure that this was.</p>
<p>This was a critical error.</p>
<p>That this was the critical error,</p>
<p>and that understanding this would get us the whole story.</p>
<p>And that could well be.</p>
<p>What was it like working with Stephen Hawking</p>
<p>on this particular problem?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s kind of a whole journey, right?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I love the guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so passionate about physics.</p>
<p>He just, yeah, his oneness with the problem,</p>
<p>and I mean, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So his mind is all occupied by the world that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, and let me tell you, there&rsquo;s a lot of other things</p>
<p>with his illness and with his celebrity,</p>
<p>and a lot of other things.</p>
<p>A lot of distractions pulling at his mind.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still right there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I remember him churning down tea with Lady Gaga</p>
<p>so we could spend another hour on paper.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is dedication.</p>
<p>What did you learn about physics?</p>
<p>What did you learn about life</p>
<p>from having worked with Stephen Hawking?</p>
<p>Well, he was one of my great teachers.</p>
<p>Of course, he&rsquo;s older than me,</p>
<p>and I was reading his textbooks,</p>
<p>and in graduate school,</p>
<p>and I learned a lot about relativity from him.</p>
<p>I learned about passion for a problem.</p>
<p>I learned about not caring what other people think.</p>
<p>Physics is an interesting culture,</p>
<p>even if you make a great discovery</p>
<p>like Hawking did,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t believe everything you say.</p>
<p>In fact, people love to disagree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a culture that cherishes disagreement,</p>
<p>and so he kept ahead with what he believed in,</p>
<p>and sometimes he was right, and sometimes he was wrong.</p>
<p>Do you feel pressure from the community?</p>
<p>So, for example, with string theory,</p>
<p>it was very popular for a time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of criticism, or it&rsquo;s less popular now.</p>
<p>Do you feel the forces of the community</p>
<p>as it moves in and out of different fields,</p>
<p>or do you try to stay,</p>
<p>like how difficult is it to stay intellectually</p>
<p>and mathematically independent from the community?</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m lucky I&rsquo;m well-equipped for that.</p>
<p>I, when I started out in graduate school,</p>
<p>the problem of quantum gravity</p>
<p>was not considered interesting.</p>
<p>He still did it anyway.</p>
<p>I still did it anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit of a contrarian, I guess,</p>
<p>and I think that has served me well.</p>
<p>And people are always sort of disagreeing with me,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re usually right, but I&rsquo;m right enough.</p>
<p>And like you said, the contradiction</p>
<p>ultimately paves the path of discovery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, just on this tension,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been dancing between physics and mathematics.</p>
<p>What to you is an interesting line</p>
<p>you can draw between the two?</p>
<p>You have done some very complicated mathematics</p>
<p>in your life to explore the laws of nature.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between physics and mathematics</p>
<p>to you?</p>
<p>Well, I love math.</p>
<p>I think my first love is physics,</p>
<p>and the math that I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;ve done to,</p>
<p>because it was needed.</p>
<p>In service of physics.</p>
<p>In service of physics, but then, of course,</p>
<p>in the heat of it, it has its own appeal.</p>
<p>In the heat of it, I like it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It has its own appeal, and I certainly enjoyed it.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I would like to think,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I believe, but I would like to think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no difference between physics and mathematics,</p>
<p>that all mathematics is realized in the physical world,</p>
<p>and all physics has a firm mathematical basis</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re really the same thing.</p>
<p>I mean, why would there be math</p>
<p>that had no physical manifestation?</p>
<p>It seems a little odd, right?</p>
<p>You have two kinds of math,</p>
<p>some that are relevant to the real world.</p>
<p>Well, they don&rsquo;t have to be contradictory,</p>
<p>but you can have, can&rsquo;t you not have mathematical objects</p>
<p>that are not at all connected to the physical world?</p>
<p>So, I mean, this is to the question</p>
<p>of is math discovered or invented?</p>
<p>So, to you, math is discovered,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a deep linkage between the two.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you find it at all compelling,</p>
<p>these ideas like something like Max Tegmark,</p>
<p>where our universe is actually</p>
<p>a fundamentally mathematical object,</p>
<p>that math is, our universe is mathematical,</p>
<p>fundamentally mathematical in nature?</p>
<p>My expertise is a physicist</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t add anything to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really, you know, physics is,</p>
<p>you know, I was once very interested in philosophy,</p>
<p>and, you know, physics,</p>
<p>physics, I like questions that can be answered,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not obvious what the answer is,</p>
<p>and that you can find an answer to the question,</p>
<p>and everybody will agree what the answer is,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s an algorithm for getting there.</p>
<p>Not that these other questions aren&rsquo;t interesting,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t somehow have a way</p>
<p>of presenting themselves,</p>
<p>but to me, the interesting thing is to,</p>
<p>is motion in what we know, is learning more,</p>
<p>and understanding things</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t understand before,</p>
<p>things that seemed totally confusing,</p>
<p>having them seem obvious, that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>So, I think that those questions are there.</p>
<p>I mean, I would even go further,</p>
<p>you know, the whole multiverse,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s too much concrete</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re ever gonna be able to say about it.</p>
<p>This is fascinating,</p>
<p>because you spend so much time in string theory,</p>
<p>which is devoid from a connection</p>
<p>to the physical world for a long time.</p>
<p>Not devoid, but it travels in a mathematical world</p>
<p>that seems to be beautiful and consistent,</p>
<p>and seems to indicate that it could be</p>
<p>a good model of the laws of nature,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still traveling independently,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very difficult to experimentally verify,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a promise laden in it,</p>
<p>in the same way multiverse,</p>
<p>or you can have a lot of kind of</p>
<p>very far out there questions,</p>
<p>where your gut and instinct and intuition says</p>
<p>that maybe in 50, 100, 200 years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to actually have</p>
<p>strong experimental validation, right?</p>
<p>I think that with string theory,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely that we could measure it,</p>
<p>but we could get lucky.</p>
<p>In other words, just to take an example,</p>
<p>about 10 or 20 years ago,</p>
<p>it was thought that they had seen a string in the sky,</p>
<p>and that it was seen by doubled stars</p>
<p>that were gravitationally lensed</p>
<p>around the gravitational field</p>
<p>produced by some long string.</p>
<p>There was a line of double lens.</p>
<p>Now, the signal went away, okay?</p>
<p>But people were hoping that they&rsquo;d seen a string,</p>
<p>and it could be a fundamental string</p>
<p>that had somehow gotten stretched,</p>
<p>and that would be some evidence for string theory.</p>
<p>There was also BICEP2,</p>
<p>which the experiment was wrong,</p>
<p>but it could have happened.</p>
<p>It could have happened that we got lucky,</p>
<p>and this experiment was able to make direct measurements.</p>
<p>Certainly would have been measurements of quantum gravity</p>
<p>if not string theory.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very logical possibility</p>
<p>that we could get experimental evidence from string.</p>
<p>That is a very different thing than saying,</p>
<p>do this experiment, here&rsquo;s a billion dollars,</p>
<p>and after you do it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll know whether or not strings are real.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a crucial difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s measurable in principle,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t see how to get from here to there.</p>
<p>If we see how to get from here to there,</p>
<p>in my eyes, it&rsquo;s boring, right?</p>
<p>So when I was a graduate student,</p>
<p>they knew how to measure the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>Took 40 years, but they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Not to say that stuff is boring.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say that stuff is boring.</p>
<p>But when Magellan set out,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know he could get around the world.</p>
<p>There was no map.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>connect in a concrete way.</p>
<p>All these ideas of string theory to the real world.</p>
<p>And when I started out in graduate school,</p>
<p>I said, what is the most interesting problem</p>
<p>that there might be,</p>
<p>the deepest, most interesting problem</p>
<p>that there might be progress on in 60 years?</p>
<p>And I think it could be</p>
<p>that in another 30 years</p>
<p>that maybe we&rsquo;ll learn that we have understood</p>
<p>how black holes store information.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem wild,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re able to abstract what we learned</p>
<p>from string theory and show that it&rsquo;s operative.</p>
<p>I mean, the Bose-Einstein condensate, they did.</p>
<p>If you would, Bose and Einstein predicted it.</p>
<p>When was that, the 30s maybe, early 30s?</p>
<p>It took, there were 20 orders of magnitude</p>
<p>that were needed in order to,</p>
<p>improvement in order to measure it.</p>
<p>And they did, 50 years later.</p>
<p>So, and you couldn&rsquo;t have guessed how that had happened,</p>
<p>how they could have gotten that.</p>
<p>And it could happen that we,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>the heterotic string spectrum at an accelerator,</p>
<p>but it could be that things come around</p>
<p>in an interesting way and somehow it comes together.</p>
<p>And the fact that we can&rsquo;t see to the end</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a reason not to do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, what did they do</p>
<p>when they were trying to find the Pacific, right?</p>
<p>They just, they took every route.</p>
<p>They just tried everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re taking, and I&rsquo;m taking the one</p>
<p>that my nose tells me is the best.</p>
<p>And other people are taking other ones, and that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because we need every person taking every route.</p>
<p>And if somebody on another route</p>
<p>finds something that looks really promising,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make a portage over the mountain</p>
<p>and get on their stream.</p>
<p>So the fact that you don&rsquo;t see the experiment now</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t, to me, a reason to give up on what I view</p>
<p>as the most fundamental paradox in 20th century,</p>
<p>20th, in present physics, 20th, 21st century physics.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you can see that it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t know the way.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I mean</p>
<p>why some of the philosophical questions could be formulated</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s explorable scientifically.</p>
<p>So some of the stuff we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>but for example, this topic that&rsquo;s become more okay</p>
<p>to talk about, which is the topic of consciousness.</p>
<p>To me, as an artificial intelligence person,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very practically interesting topic.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also philosophers.</p>
<p>Sean Carroll loves to argue against them.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some philosophers that are panpsychists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against philosophers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not as fun, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as fun, right.</p>
<p>But they start a little flame of a fire going</p>
<p>that some of those flames, I think,</p>
<p>eventually become physics.</p>
<p>So eventually become something that we can really,</p>
<p>like having them around is really important</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll discover something by modeling</p>
<p>and exploring black holes that&rsquo;s really weird</p>
<p>and having these ideas around,</p>
<p>like the ideas of panpsychists</p>
<p>that consciousness could be a fundamental force of nature.</p>
<p>Just even having that crazy idea,</p>
<p>swimming around in the background,</p>
<p>could really spark something</p>
<p>where you were missing something completely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s where the philosophy done right,</p>
<p>I think, is very useful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where even the, you know, these thought experiments,</p>
<p>which is very fun in sort of the tech sci-fi world</p>
<p>that we live in a simulation,</p>
<p>that, you know, taking a perspective of the universe</p>
<p>as a computer, as a computational system</p>
<p>that processes information,</p>
<p>which is a pretty intuitive notion,</p>
<p>but you can just even reframing it that way for yourself</p>
<p>could really open up some different way of thinking.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>And then you have, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with Stephen Wolfram&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>of like cellular atomic complexity.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did a podcast with Stephen.</p>
<p>Stephen, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, forget physics, forget all that.</p>
<p>Cellular automata make no sense.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so beautiful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so, that from simple rules</p>
<p>you can create complexity.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think, you know,</p>
<p>he wrote a book, A New Kind of Science,</p>
<p>basically hinting at,</p>
<p>which a lot of people have hinted at,</p>
<p>is like, we don&rsquo;t have a good way</p>
<p>to talk about these objects.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t figure out what is happening here.</p>
<p>These trivial rules can create incredible complexity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s totally right about that, yeah.</p>
<p>And physicists, I guess, don&rsquo;t know what to do with that,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what to do with cellular automata</p>
<p>because you can describe the simple rules</p>
<p>that govern the system,</p>
<p>but how complexity can emerge, like incredible complexity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Of course, Wolfram&rsquo;s version of that</p>
<p>is that physicists will never be able to describe it.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>He tries to prove that it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>What do you make about the tension of being a physicist</p>
<p>and potentially not being able to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Freud or somebody that maybe,</p>
<p>Sigmund Freud, that maybe you&rsquo;ll never be able</p>
<p>to actually describe the human psyche.</p>
<p>Is that a possibility for you,</p>
<p>that you will never be able to get to the core</p>
<p>fundamental description of the laws of nature?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I had this conversation with Weinberg.</p>
<p>Yeah, how&rsquo;d it go?</p>
<p>So Weinberg has this book called</p>
<p>Dreams of a Final Theory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I had this conversation with him.</p>
<p>I said, why do you think there&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>gonna be a final theory?</p>
<p>Why should there ever be a final theory?</p>
<p>I mean, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Do physics departments shut down with solar power?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve solved everything.</p>
<p>And doesn&rsquo;t it seem that every time</p>
<p>we answer some old questions, we&rsquo;ll just find new ones</p>
<p>and that it will just keep going on forever and ever?</p>
<p>He said, well, that&rsquo;s what they used to say about the Nile.</p>
<p>They were never gonna find the end.</p>
<p>Then one day they found it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>String theory doesn&rsquo;t look like a candidate to me</p>
<p>for a final theory.</p>
<p>As it stands now.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get to the bottom of the well</p>
<p>and to the sides and to the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems to me that even if we kind of solved it</p>
<p>and we did experiments, there still would be more questions</p>
<p>like why are there four dimensions instead of six?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to have anything in it</p>
<p>that would explain that.</p>
<p>You can always hope that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know about string theory</p>
<p>that will explain it, but it still doesn&rsquo;t look like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna answer every question.</p>
<p>And why is there one time, not two?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what it would mean to answer every question.</p>
<p>Well, to answer every question, obviously.</p>
<p>So when you refer to the theory of everything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to have a, if it exists,</p>
<p>it would be a theory that allows you to predict precisely</p>
<p>the behavior of objects in the universe</p>
<p>and their movement, right?</p>
<p>What about them, their movement?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Precisely, no matter the object.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So that would be a really interesting state of affairs</p>
<p>if we could predict everything</p>
<p>but not necessarily understand everything.</p>
<p>So for example, let&rsquo;s just forget about gravity.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not too far from that situation.</p>
<p>If we forget about gravity, the standard model,</p>
<p>in principle, given a big enough computer,</p>
<p>predicts almost everything.</p>
<p>But if you look at the standard model,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a laundry list with neutrino masses</p>
<p>and all that stuff.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of free parameters.</p>
<p>Where do they come from?</p>
<p>Is there an organizing principle?</p>
<p>Is there some further unification?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So being able to predict everything</p>
<p>is not the only goal that physicists have.</p>
<p>So on the way to trying to predict,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually probably the goal is to understand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But right, we&rsquo;re more interested in understanding</p>
<p>than actually doing the predictions.</p>
<p>But the predictions are more,</p>
<p>focusing on how to make predictions</p>
<p>is a good way to improve your understanding</p>
<p>because you know you&rsquo;ve understood it</p>
<p>if you can do the predictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the interesting things</p>
<p>that might come to a head with is artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an increasing use of AI in physics.</p>
<p>We might live in a world where AI</p>
<p>would be able to predict perfectly what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And so as physicists, you&rsquo;ll have to come to the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually not that interested in prediction.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very useful, but you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in really understanding the deep laws of nature</p>
<p>versus a perfect predictor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you wanna play chess.</p>
<p>But even within AI,</p>
<p>people are trying to understand what it is</p>
<p>that the AI bots have learned</p>
<p>in order to produce whatever they produce.</p>
<p>For sure, but you still don&rsquo;t understand deeply,</p>
<p>especially because they&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>especially language models, if you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>the systems that are able to generate text,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to have conversations,</p>
<p>Chad GPT is the recent manifestation of that.</p>
<p>They just seem to know everything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trained on the internet.</p>
<p>They seem to be very, very good</p>
<p>at something that looks like reasoning.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to generate, you can ask them questions,</p>
<p>they can answer questions.</p>
<p>It just feels like this thing is intelligent, right?</p>
<p>And I could just see that being possible with physics.</p>
<p>You ask any kind of physical question</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be able to, very precise</p>
<p>about a particular star system or a particular black hole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll say, well, these are the numbers you see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll perfectly predict.</p>
<p>And then, sure, you can understand</p>
<p>how the neural network is, the architecture is structured.</p>
<p>Actually, for most of them now, they&rsquo;re very simple.</p>
<p>You can understand what data is trained on,</p>
<p>huge amount of data.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting a huge amount of data</p>
<p>from a very nice telescope or something.</p>
<p>And then, but it seems to predict everything perfectly.</p>
<p>How a banana falls when you throw it.</p>
<p>Everything is perfectly predicted.</p>
<p>You still don&rsquo;t have a deep understanding</p>
<p>of what governs the whole thing.</p>
<p>And maybe you can ask it a question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be some kind of Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide</p>
<p>to the Galaxy type answer that,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a funny world we live in.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s also possible that there&rsquo;s no such deep,</p>
<p>simple governing laws of nature behind the whole thing.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something in us humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>That wants it there to be.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t have to be, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re betting, you already bet the farm.</p>
<p>But if you were to have a second farm,</p>
<p>do you think there is a theory of everything</p>
<p>that we might get at?</p>
<p>So, simple laws that govern the whole thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>honestly, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty confident that if there is,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t get to it in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re near it.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t it feel like there,</p>
<p>like the fact that we have the laws we do,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re relatively simple already.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, there seems to be,</p>
<p>there seems to be simple laws that govern things, right?</p>
<p>By theory of everything, you mean theory,</p>
<p>a theory of everything,</p>
<p>an algorithm to predict everything.</p>
<p>But a simple algorithm.</p>
<p>A relatively simple algorithm to predict everything.</p>
<p>So, for me, it would be a sad day</p>
<p>if we arrived at that</p>
<p>without answering some deeper questions.</p>
<p>Sure, of course, it definitely is.</p>
<p>But the question, yes.</p>
<p>But one of the questions before we arrive there,</p>
<p>we can ask, does such a destination even exist?</p>
<p>So, because asking the question and the possible answers</p>
<p>in the process of trying to answer that question</p>
<p>is in itself super interesting.</p>
<p>Is it even possible to get there,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an equals mc squared type of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a function, okay, you can have many parameters,</p>
<p>but a finite number of parameter function</p>
<p>that can predict a lot of things about our universe.</p>
<p>Well, okay, but just to sort of throw one thing in,</p>
<p>in order to answer every question,</p>
<p>we would need a theory of the origin of the universe.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that is a huge task, right?</p>
<p>So, and the fact that the universe seems to have a beginning</p>
<p>defies everything we know and love, right?</p>
<p>Because one of the basic principles of physics</p>
<p>is determinism, that the past follows from,</p>
<p>the present follows from the past,</p>
<p>the future follows from the present, and so on.</p>
<p>But if you have the origin of the universe,</p>
<p>if you have a big bang,</p>
<p>that means before that, there was nothing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have a theory</p>
<p>in which something follows from nothing.</p>
<p>So somehow.</p>
<p>Sounds like you don&rsquo;t like singularities.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>I thought for somebody that works with black holes,</p>
<p>you would get used to them by now.</p>
<p>No, no, I like this because it&rsquo;s so hard to understand.</p>
<p>I like it because it&rsquo;s hard to understand,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really challenging us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re close</p>
<p>to solving that problem.</p>
<p>So even.</p>
<p>And string theory, string theory has basically had nothing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been almost nothing interesting said about that</p>
<p>in the last many decades.</p>
<p>So string theory hasn&rsquo;t really looked at the big bang.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t really tried to get to the origin.</p>
<p>Not, not successfully.</p>
<p>Not, there aren&rsquo;t compelling papers</p>
<p>that lots of people have read</p>
<p>that people have taken it up and tried to go at it,</p>
<p>but there aren&rsquo;t, there aren&rsquo;t compelling.</p>
<p>String theory doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a trick</p>
<p>that helps us with that puzzle.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to sneak up</p>
<p>to the origin of the universe?</p>
<p>Like reverse engineer it?</p>
<p>From experimental, from theoretical perspective?</p>
<p>Like, okay, if we can, what would be the trajectory?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already gotten yourself in trouble, you see,</p>
<p>because you used the word reverse engineer.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re gonna reverse engineer,</p>
<p>that means you, forward engineering</p>
<p>means that you take the present and determine the future.</p>
<p>Reverse engineering means that you take the present</p>
<p>and determine the past.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Estimate the past, but yes, sure.</p>
<p>But if the past was nothing,</p>
<p>how are you ever gonna reverse engineer to nothing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>Run up against the nothing, right?</p>
<p>Until, have mathematical models that break down nicely</p>
<p>to where you can actually start to infer things.</p>
<p>Do you think.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work on it.</p>
<p>No, but do you think that that.</p>
<p>I could, maybe, but it is,</p>
<p>people have tried to do things like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and have not succeeded.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that we, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting A pluses in.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pretend we live in a world</p>
<p>where in 100 years we have an answer to that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What would that answer look like?</p>
<p>Who, what department is that from?</p>
<p>What fields led us there?</p>
<p>What, not what fields,</p>
<p>what set of ideas in theoretical physics?</p>
<p>Is it experimental, is it theoretical?</p>
<p>Like what can you imagine possibly</p>
<p>could have possibly lead us there?</p>
<p>Is it through gravitational waves</p>
<p>and some kind of observations there?</p>
<p>Is it investigation of black holes?</p>
<p>Is it simulation of universes?</p>
<p>Is it maybe we start creating black holes somehow?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe some kind of high energy physics type of experiments?</p>
<p>Well, I have some late night ideas about that</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t really ready for prime time.</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>But you have some ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but, and many people do.</p>
<p>It could be that some of the advances</p>
<p>in quantum information theory are important</p>
<p>in that they kind of go beyond taking quantum systems</p>
<p>and just replicating themselves,</p>
<p>but combining them with others.</p>
<p>Do you think, since you highlighted the issue</p>
<p>with time and the origin of the universe,</p>
<p>do you think time is fundamental or emergent?</p>
<p>I think ultimately it has to be emergent.</p>
<p>Yeah, what does it mean for time to be emergent?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s review what it means for space to be emergent.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What it means for space to be emergent</p>
<p>is that you have a holographic plate</p>
<p>and you shine some light that&rsquo;s moving in space</p>
<p>and it produces an image</p>
<p>which contains an extra spatial dimension</p>
<p>and time just goes along for the ride.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;d like to do,</p>
<p>and indeed there is some rather concrete work</p>
<p>in this direction, though again, I would say,</p>
<p>even within our stringing community,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not getting A pluses on these efforts.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;d like to do is to see</p>
<p>examples in which the extra space-time dimension is time.</p>
<p>In other words, usually what we understand</p>
<p>very well mathematically is how to take systems</p>
<p>in some number of space-time dimensions</p>
<p>and rewrite them as a plate in fewer space dimensions.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;d like to do is to take systems</p>
<p>with one time in some number of space dimensions</p>
<p>and to rewrite them as a system</p>
<p>that had only space dimensions in it, had no time evolution.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some fairly concrete ideas about how to do that</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not universally accepted</p>
<p>even within the stringy community.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it wild to you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For it to be emergent?</p>
<p>How do we intuit these kinds of ideas as human beings</p>
<p>for whom space and time seems as fundamental</p>
<p>as apples and oranges?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re both illusions.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both illusions, even time.</p>
<p>You co-authored a paper titled</p>
<p>Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes.</p>
<p>First of all, whoever writes your paper titles,</p>
<p>you like the soft hair and the term black hole</p>
<p>and the big bang, you&rsquo;re very good</p>
<p>at coming up with titles yourself.</p>
<p>Anyway, you co-authored a paper titled</p>
<p>Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes.</p>
<p>In it you write, quote,</p>
<p>recent work has identified a number of emergent symmetries</p>
<p>related to the intricate self-similar structure</p>
<p>of the photon ring.</p>
<p>So what are photon rings?</p>
<p>What are some interesting characteristics of a photon ring?</p>
<p>So that was a paper with Dan Kopitz and Alex Lipsaska</p>
<p>that just came out.</p>
<p>And this paper is kind of a wonderful example</p>
<p>of what happens when you start to talk to people</p>
<p>who are way out of your comfort zone</p>
<p>of know different stuff</p>
<p>and look at the world a different way</p>
<p>and some two or three years ago,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of this, the Black Hole Initiative,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also part of this</p>
<p>Event Horizon Telescope collaboration</p>
<p>that took the famous,</p>
<p>though I had nothing to do with the experiment,</p>
<p>but that took the famous picture of the donut of M87</p>
<p>and through conversations with them,</p>
<p>which started out in an effort</p>
<p>to understand the image that they&rsquo;d seen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great thing for somebody like me,</p>
<p>a theoretical physicist,</p>
<p>lost, seemingly lost in string land,</p>
<p>to be presented with an actual picture of a black hole.</p>
<p>And to be asked, what can we learn from this?</p>
<p>So with some help from Michael Johnson and Alex Lipsaska</p>
<p>and a bunch of other people at the Event Horizon</p>
<p>collaboration, we came up with a fantastic,</p>
<p>beautiful answer using Einstein&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>that is both shaping the future of now,</p>
<p>it is shaping the future of improved black hole photographs.</p>
<p>What do you want to concentrate on in the photograph?</p>
<p>You just point it at the sky and click?</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You optimize for various features.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s both shaping that</p>
<p>and in the process of talking to them</p>
<p>and thinking about how light behaves around a black hole,</p>
<p>black holes just have so many magic tricks</p>
<p>and they do so many weird things.</p>
<p>And the photon ring is among the weirdest of them.</p>
<p>We understood this photon ring and in the process of this,</p>
<p>we said, hey, this photon ring</p>
<p>has got to be telling us something about the puzzle</p>
<p>of where the holographic plate is</p>
<p>outside of a ordinary astrophysical black hole.</p>
<p>And we nailed it for the stringy black holes,</p>
<p>but they have a somewhat different character.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a stringy black hole?</p>
<p>The black holes that describe us?</p>
<p>The black holes that are contained in string theory</p>
<p>and they have different structure in them.</p>
<p>Well, but actually, can we step back?</p>
<p>So what was the light in the image taken in 2019?</p>
<p>No, not taken in 2019, presented in 2019.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the puzzle.</p>
<p>What they really saw,</p>
<p>so the black holes tend to gather stuff</p>
<p>that swirls around it.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t know what that stuff is made of.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what its temperature is.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what kind of magnetic fields</p>
<p>there are around there.</p>
<p>So the form of the image has a lot of unknowns in it</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s dependent on many other things</p>
<p>other than the geometry of the black hole.</p>
<p>So most of what you&rsquo;re learning is about the stuff.</p>
<p>Now the stuff, the swirling stuff,</p>
<p>the hot swirling stuff is interesting as hell,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as interesting as the black hole,</p>
<p>which are the most, in my view,</p>
<p>the most interesting things in the universe.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t wanna just learn about the stuff.</p>
<p>You wanna learn about the black hole</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s swirling around.</p>
<p>So one of the, at the very first step,</p>
<p>at the very primitive level,</p>
<p>this is just a big leap for human civilization</p>
<p>to be able to see a black hole.</p>
<p>And the way you can see it</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s stuff around it.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t get to learn much about the black hole.</p>
<p>You get to learn more about the stuff just from the image.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re not gonna learn about the details</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;ve even seen it.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s too many parameters.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many variables that govern the stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, so then we found a very wonderful way</p>
<p>to learn about the black hole.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>A black hole is a mirror.</p>
<p>And the way it&rsquo;s a mirror is if light, a photon,</p>
<p>bounces off your face towards the black hole,</p>
<p>it goes straight to the black hole,</p>
<p>just falls in, you never see it again.</p>
<p>But if it just misses the black hole,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll swing around the back and come back to you.</p>
<p>And you see yourself.</p>
<p>From the photon that went around</p>
<p>the back of the black hole.</p>
<p>But not only can that happen,</p>
<p>the black hole, the photon can swing around twice</p>
<p>and come back.</p>
<p>So you actually see an infinite number of copies of yourself.</p>
<p>Like with a little bit of a delay.</p>
<p>With a little bit of a delay, right.</p>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in fact.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not used to an object</p>
<p>that bends light like that, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna get some trippy cool effects.</p>
<p>And in fact, one of my students</p>
<p>has made a really awesome computer animation of this,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m gonna show at a public lecture</p>
<p>in a couple of weeks where the audience</p>
<p>will see infinitely many copies of themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Swirling around the black hole.</p>
<p>So, a black hole is like a hall of mirrors.</p>
<p>You know, like an apartment store</p>
<p>where you go and there&rsquo;s the three mirrors</p>
<p>and you see infinitely many copies of yourself.</p>
<p>Think of the black hole as the mirror.</p>
<p>And you go in there with your clothes.</p>
<p>If you wanna know about your clothes,</p>
<p>you just look at the direct image.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not learning anything</p>
<p>about the configuration of mirrors.</p>
<p>But the relation of the image you see in front of you</p>
<p>the image you see in front of you</p>
<p>to the one you see at the side</p>
<p>and the next one and so on depends only on the mirrors.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what clothes you&rsquo;re wearing.</p>
<p>So you can go there a thousand times</p>
<p>wearing different clothes, but each time</p>
<p>there will be the same relation</p>
<p>between the subsequent images.</p>
<p>And that is how we&rsquo;re gonna learn about the black holes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna take the stuff that is swirling around</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna tease out the subsequent images</p>
<p>and look at their relation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some very beautiful,</p>
<p>really beautiful mathematics,</p>
<p>which we were surprised to realize</p>
<p>with the volumes and volumes of papers</p>
<p>on black holes and their properties,</p>
<p>this particular, because it was a physical question</p>
<p>that had never been asked in exactly this way.</p>
<p>So basically you&rsquo;re looking at the-</p>
<p>The relation between the subsequent images.</p>
<p>But those are ultimately formed by photons</p>
<p>that are swirling around.</p>
<p>Photons that are orbiting.</p>
<p>So the photon ring are the photons that orbit around.</p>
<p>And beyond, so like orbit and lose orbit.</p>
<p>Wow, and that starts to give you,</p>
<p>what can you possibly figure out mathematically</p>
<p>about the black hole?</p>
<p>Can you, the geometry of it?</p>
<p>The geometry, the spin.</p>
<p>And you can verify things behaving.</p>
<p>We have never seen a region of space time</p>
<p>with such high curvature.</p>
<p>I mean, the region around a black hole is crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like in this room.</p>
<p>The curvature is everything.</p>
<p>You spent probably enough time with the math and the photons.</p>
<p>Can you put yourself in that space?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like having a conversation</p>
<p>in pretty peaceful, comfortable, flat space.</p>
<p>Are you able to put yourself</p>
<p>in the place around a black hole?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m able to imagine that kind of thing, yeah.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>and actually there&rsquo;s a wonderful movie, Interstellar.</p>
<p>And in that movie, Kip Thorne of course</p>
<p>is a great theoretical physicist, experimental,</p>
<p>who later won the Nobel Prize for LIGO.</p>
<p>And that movie is very accurate scientifically.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some funny statements in there</p>
<p>that of the 100 million people who saw that movie,</p>
<p>there can&rsquo;t be more than 10 or 20 understood</p>
<p>about why Matthew McConaughey is ejecting the trash</p>
<p>in a certain direction in order to,</p>
<p>but for example, if I were a spinning black hole right here,</p>
<p>if I was spinning fast enough,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stay still there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to be orbiting around like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to have your microphone on a rotating piece.</p>
<p>But I wonder what the experience is,</p>
<p>what the actual experience,</p>
<p>because I mean, space itself is curved.</p>
<p>Well, if space gets very curved, you get crushed.</p>
<p>Your body gets ripped apart</p>
<p>because the forces are different on different parts.</p>
<p>But it can be less curved</p>
<p>so that the curvature is very noticeable,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not ripped apart.</p>
<p>The fact that this was just nonchalantly stated</p>
<p>is just beautiful.</p>
<p>Like two biological systems discussing</p>
<p>which level of curvature is required to rip apart</p>
<p>said biological system.</p>
<p>Very well, so you propose in the paper</p>
<p>that a photon ring of a warped black hole</p>
<p>is indeed part of the black hole hologram.</p>
<p>A photon ring of a warped black hole</p>
<p>is indeed part of the black hole hologram.</p>
<p>So what can you intuit about the hologram</p>
<p>and the holographic plate</p>
<p>from looking at the photon rings?</p>
<p>Well, this paper is exploring a new idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not making a new discovery, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exploring an idea and the ins and outs of it</p>
<p>and what might work and what might not.</p>
<p>This photon ring, somehow everybody always thought</p>
<p>that the holographic plate</p>
<p>sat at the horizon of the black hole</p>
<p>and that the quantum system that describes the black hole</p>
<p>is inside the horizon.</p>
<p>In fact, we think it&rsquo;s plausible</p>
<p>and we give some evidence in some soluble examples,</p>
<p>in this case, in an example in one lower dimension</p>
<p>where we can handle the equations better,</p>
<p>that the quantum system that describes the black hole</p>
<p>should correspond to a region of space-time</p>
<p>which includes the photon ring.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s bigger.</p>
<p>So that would be the holographic plate.</p>
<p>That would be the holographic plate.</p>
<p>All of that.</p>
<p>I mean, we didn&rsquo;t prove this.</p>
<p>We put it out there.</p>
<p>It hadn&rsquo;t really been considered previously.</p>
<p>We put it out there and it does seem more plausible</p>
<p>than the idea that it sits literally at the horizon</p>
<p>and it is a big outstanding problem</p>
<p>of how you have a holographic reconstruction</p>
<p>of black holes like M87.</p>
<p>Do you think there could be further experimental data</p>
<p>that helps explore some of these ideas</p>
<p>that you have for photon rings and holographic plates</p>
<p>through imaging and through high-resolution images</p>
<p>and also just more and more data?</p>
<p>I wish so, but I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>But what I think already has happened</p>
<p>and will continue to happen</p>
<p>is that there are many different ways</p>
<p>that theorists and observers can interact.</p>
<p>The gold standard is the theorist makes a prediction,</p>
<p>the observer measures it and confirms it,</p>
<p>or the observer makes a discovery</p>
<p>and the theorist explains it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot less than that</p>
<p>which is really kind of the bread and butter of,</p>
<p>those are dramatic moments when that happens, right?</p>
<p>Those are once-in-a-lifetime moments when that happens.</p>
<p>But the bread and butter is more when,</p>
<p>and it has already happened,</p>
<p>they came to us and said,</p>
<p>what is the interesting theoretical things</p>
<p>we can understand in this swirl around the black hole?</p>
<p>And we gave an answer and then that,</p>
<p>in turn, jogged us to think about</p>
<p>the holographic principle in the context of M87</p>
<p>a little bit differently.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a useful, and in the same vein,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful to talk to the philosophers</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s useful to talk to the mathematicians</p>
<p>and a lot of,</p>
<p>you gotta, we just gotta,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>we just gotta do everything.</p>
<p>Let me ask you another sort of philosophical type question,</p>
<p>but not really, actually.</p>
<p>It seems that thought experiments are used,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just mathematics that makes progress</p>
<p>in theoretical physics, but thought experiments do.</p>
<p>They did for Einstein as well.</p>
<p>They did for a lot of great physicists throughout history.</p>
<p>Over the years, how&rsquo;s your ability</p>
<p>to generate thought experiments?</p>
<p>Or just your intuition about some of these weird things</p>
<p>like quantum mechanics or string theory</p>
<p>or quantum gravity or, yeah, even general relativity.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your intuition improved over the years?</p>
<p>Have you been able to make progress?</p>
<p>The hard part in physics is</p>
<p>most problems are</p>
<p>either doable, most problems that a theoretical calculation,</p>
<p>that a theoretical physicist would do,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no end of problems whose answer is uninteresting.</p>
<p>Can be solved, but the answer is uninteresting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also no end of problems that are very interesting,</p>
<p>some of which you&rsquo;ve asked me,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have a clue how to solve them.</p>
<p>And when first presented with a problem,</p>
<p>almost every problem is one or the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the jackpot when you find one</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t one or the other.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>There seems like there&rsquo;s a gray area</p>
<p>between the two, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you should be looking.</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t describe it as a gray area.</p>
<p>I would describe it as a knife edge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very small area.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a huge area with a sign.</p>
<p>Here lie problems that are doable,</p>
<p>and people wanna know the answer.</p>
<p>In some deep sense, that&rsquo;s where timing is everything</p>
<p>with physics, with science, with discovery.</p>
<p>With timing.</p>
<p>I mean, I think earlier in my career,</p>
<p>I erred more on the side of problems</p>
<p>that were not solvable.</p>
<p>The ambition of youth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What made you fall in love with physics at first?</p>
<p>If we can go back to the early days.</p>
<p>You said black holes were there in the beginning.</p>
<p>But what made you, do you remember</p>
<p>what really made you fall in love?</p>
<p>You know, I wanted to reach nirvana,</p>
<p>and I sort of realized that wasn&rsquo;t gonna happen.</p>
<p>And then after that, I wanted to know the meaning of life,</p>
<p>and I realized I probably wasn&rsquo;t gonna figure that out.</p>
<p>And then I wanted to understand, you know,</p>
<p>justice and socialism and world things,</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t figure those out either.</p>
<p>And the simplest.</p>
<p>Smaller and smaller problems.</p>
<p>Smaller and smaller problems.</p>
<p>And I mean, most of this I&rsquo;m talking about adolescence,</p>
<p>you know, but it was the biggest problem</p>
<p>that I thought that there was a prospect of,</p>
<p>but not 100%, you know?</p>
<p>And I was definitely ready to spend my life</p>
<p>in the wilderness knocking my head against the wall,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t had to.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t solved them, but I&rsquo;ve said enough</p>
<p>interesting things that you&rsquo;re interviewing me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not in the wilderness, but yeah, so.</p>
<p>Do you remember the early days?</p>
<p>Do you feel nostalgic when you think back to the ideas,</p>
<p>the circumstances that led down,</p>
<p>that led you down the path towards black holes,</p>
<p>towards theoretical physics, towards the tools of physics,</p>
<p>towards this really fascinating world</p>
<p>of theoretical physics?</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t add nostalgia to it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like a summer in Italy or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s results that are there,</p>
<p>that people are, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so gratifying.</p>
<p>I mean, of course one&rsquo;s name disappears from these things,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re Einstein or Newton or something.</p>
<p>People are not gonna remember my name in 50 years.</p>
<p>Well, most, basically every name will be forgotten</p>
<p>in hundreds of years, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Are you able to, by the way, love the idea,</p>
<p>the exploration of ideas themselves,</p>
<p>without the names, the recognition, the fame?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, so I have not.</p>
<p>I hope someday, but I have not.</p>
<p>There are some experiments now to verify</p>
<p>some of my predictions about properties</p>
<p>of gravity and so on, but I have not.</p>
<p>Most of what I&rsquo;ve done is in the,</p>
<p>it could happen still.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a logical possibility</p>
<p>that everything having to do with string theory and the,</p>
<p>I mean, as we mentioned, I&rsquo;m betting the farm</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not, but it is indeed a logical possibility</p>
<p>that people will say, can you believe Lex Fridman</p>
<p>interviewed Elon Musk in Kenya West,</p>
<p>and then he interviewed Strominger,</p>
<p>who was on this, working on this theory</p>
<p>that just completely went into the,</p>
<p>completely went into the toilet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make, I&rsquo;m gonna get,</p>
<p>with a wife I don&rsquo;t have, I&rsquo;m gonna make</p>
<p>a public statement, she&rsquo;ll be on stage,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll say, I&rsquo;m really sorry I made this giant mistake</p>
<p>of platforming this wild-eyed physicist</p>
<p>that believed for decades in the power</p>
<p>of theoretical physics, yes.</p>
<p>No, like you said.</p>
<p>So that could happen.</p>
<p>It could happen, it could happen.</p>
<p>And of course, if that couldn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t be real exploration, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And so, but I, you know, I do take a lot of satisfaction</p>
<p>that some of the things I discovered</p>
<p>are, at the minimum, mathematical truths,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re still, so you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that sort of nostalgic feeling of it</p>
<p>being something that was gone,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still making discoveries now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m as excited about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if they hold the test of time that,</p>
<p>that stand the test of time that these other ones did,</p>
<p>but that I&rsquo;m as excited about as I was about those</p>
<p>when I made them.</p>
<p>I am easily excitable, as my friends will tell you.</p>
<p>Well, one interesting thing about you is.</p>
<p>And I have been very excited about things</p>
<p>which turned out to be completely wrong, you know?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, the excitement is a precondition</p>
<p>for breakthroughs.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also somebody, just like you said,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a cynical view of the modern state of physics.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of people that glorify</p>
<p>like the early days of string theory,</p>
<p>and that, you know, all the discoveries that were made,</p>
<p>and the 20th century.</p>
<p>Yeah, people are always, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying like, this, to you,</p>
<p>might be one of, if not the most exciting times</p>
<p>to be a theoretical physicist.</p>
<p>Like, when the alien civilizations,</p>
<p>500 years from now, that visit Earth,</p>
<p>will look back, they&rsquo;ll think the 21st century,</p>
<p>some of the biggest discoveries ever</p>
<p>were made in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, when they have a measurement</p>
<p>of string theory, the fun&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Then we have to go on to something new, you know?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s deep, there&rsquo;s going to be deep.</p>
<p>The fun is over.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>But there is an end to the Nile, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Is there?</p>
<p>Who told you?</p>
<p>Some, some Weinberg guy.</p>
<p>Let me ask you another trippy out there question now.</p>
<p>So, again, perhaps unanswerable</p>
<p>from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>but do you wonder about alien civilizations?</p>
<p>Do you wonder about other intelligent beings out there</p>
<p>making up their own math and physics,</p>
<p>trying to figure out the world?</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;re out there?</p>
<p>It is hard to understand why there would,</p>
<p>given that there&rsquo;s so many planets,</p>
<p>and of course, there&rsquo;s Drake&rsquo;s formula,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t exactly know what the,</p>
<p>but I mean, I think Fermi&rsquo;s paradox,</p>
<p>that, you know, is a real paradox,</p>
<p>and I think there probably are,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s very exciting</p>
<p>that, you know, we might, you know,</p>
<p>find some, it&rsquo;s a logical possibility</p>
<p>that we could learn about it.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, it&rsquo;s super interesting</p>
<p>to think about aliens from a perspective of physics,</p>
<p>because, so, any intelligent civilization</p>
<p>is going to be contending with the ideas,</p>
<p>just trying to understand the world around it.</p>
<p>So, I think that the alien,</p>
<p>I think that the universe is filled</p>
<p>with alien civilizations.</p>
<p>So, they all have their physicists, right?</p>
<p>They all have their,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all trying to understand the world around them,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just interesting to me</p>
<p>to imagine all these different perspectives,</p>
<p>all these different Einsteins.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, trying to make sense of, like.</p>
<p>Though they might be more different than we think.</p>
<p>What, why?</p>
<p>They might be different in a way</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t even thought of.</p>
<p>Like, smarter or different?</p>
<p>Just different, something that we don&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not even able to describe now.</p>
<p>We just haven&rsquo;t thought of it, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a really frustrating thing</p>
<p>when we think, from me as an AI person,</p>
<p>you start to think about what is intelligence,</p>
<p>what is consciousness,</p>
<p>and you start to, sometimes, again,</p>
<p>evening thoughts is how little we understand,</p>
<p>how narrow our thinking is about these concepts.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That it could be intelligence,</p>
<p>could be, something could be intelligent</p>
<p>and be very different.</p>
<p>Intelligent in a very different way</p>
<p>that we won&rsquo;t be able to detect</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not keeping an open mind,</p>
<p>open enough mind.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of sad because, to me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also just a strong possibility</p>
<p>that aliens or something like alien intelligence</p>
<p>or some fascinating, beautiful physical phenomena</p>
<p>are all around us,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re too dumb to see it, for now.</p>
<p>Or too close-minded to see it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re just deeply missing,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s fundamental limitations</p>
<p>of our cognitive abilities</p>
<p>or just because our tools are too primitive right now.</p>
<p>Or the way we, it&rsquo;s like you said,</p>
<p>the idea seemed trivial once you figured it all out,</p>
<p>looking back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that kind of makes me sad</p>
<p>because there could be so much beauty in the world</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not seeing.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re too dumb.</p>
<p>There surely is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I guess, the process of science and physics</p>
<p>is to keep exploring, to keep exploring,</p>
<p>to find the thing that will, in a century, seem obvious.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s something we know for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, the brain, we don&rsquo;t really understand,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gotta be some fabulously beautiful story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping some of that story will be written</p>
<p>through the process of trying to build a brain,</p>
<p>so the process of engineering intelligence,</p>
<p>not just the neuroscience perspective</p>
<p>of just looking at the brain, but trying to create it.</p>
<p>But yeah, that story hasn&rsquo;t been written almost at all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just at the early days of figuring that one out.</p>
<p>But see, you said that math is discovered,</p>
<p>so aliens should at least have the same math as us, right?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Maybe different symbols?</p>
<p>They might have discovered different,</p>
<p>they might have discovered it differently,</p>
<p>and they might have had a different idea</p>
<p>of what a proof is.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very like black and white with the proof thing.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re looser?</p>
<p>Right, well, so you can know something is true.</p>
<p>First of all, you never know something is true</p>
<p>with 100% uncertainty.</p>
<p>I mean, you might have had a blackout,</p>
<p>just to be, it&rsquo;s never 100%, right?</p>
<p>You might have had a momentary lapse of consciousness</p>
<p>as the key step in the proof,</p>
<p>and nobody read it, and whatever.</p>
<p>Okay, so you never know for sure.</p>
<p>But you can be, you have a preponderance of evidence,</p>
<p>which makes it, and preponderance of evidence</p>
<p>is not accepted very much in mathematics.</p>
<p>And that was sort of how the famous Ramanujan work.</p>
<p>He had formulas which he guessed at,</p>
<p>and then he gathered a preponderance of evidence</p>
<p>that he was sure they were true.</p>
<p>So there might be, or something completely different.</p>
<p>They might function in a very different way.</p>
<p>Let me ask you kind of a heavy question for a physicist,</p>
<p>but one on nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Just in general, what do you think about nuclear weapons</p>
<p>where, like philosophical level,</p>
<p>where brilliant physicists and brilliant engineering</p>
<p>leads to a thing that can destroy human civilization?</p>
<p>Sort of like some of the ideas that you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>have power when engineered into machines, into systems.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of you that worries about that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the brilliant had to do with it,</p>
<p>because, of course, Oppenheimer and all that,</p>
<p>okay, they did it really fast,</p>
<p>but if you didn&rsquo;t have Oppenheimer,</p>
<p>I mean, it would all have happened anyway.</p>
<p>It had a reality of its own.</p>
<p>The possibility of making a nuclear,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t depend on the fact</p>
<p>that the physicists who built it were brilliant.</p>
<p>Maybe that sped it up by a year or two years,</p>
<p>but by now, we&rsquo;d have nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that.</p>
<p>So the ideas have momentum and that they&rsquo;re unstoppable.</p>
<p>Right, the possibility of making nuclear weapons</p>
<p>was discovered, right?</p>
<p>It was there before, it&rsquo;s not like somebody made it, right?</p>
<p>Without Picasso, there would never have been a Guernica,</p>
<p>but without Oppenheimer,</p>
<p>there would surely have still been an atom bomb.</p>
<p>But timing matters, right?</p>
<p>Timing&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy with a mustache.</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>Of course, the timing mattered there.</p>
<p>But I, yeah, okay, I mean,</p>
<p>you could try to make a case for stopping.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s the case of carrying the burden</p>
<p>of the responsibility of the power of ideas</p>
<p>when manifested into systems.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not a game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a game of fun mathematics.</p>
<p>Just same with artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>You have this, you know, a lot of people in AI.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people in the AI community,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating, fun puzzle,</p>
<p>how to make systems more and more intelligent,</p>
<p>how to, you have a bunch of benchmarks.</p>
<p>You try to make them perform better and better and better,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden, you have a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to outsmart people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now able to be used in geopolitics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s able to create super intelligent bots</p>
<p>that are able to, at scale,</p>
<p>control the belief of a population of people.</p>
<p>And now you can have world wars.</p>
<p>You can have a lot of really risky instabilities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re incredible.</p>
<p>They really are incredible.</p>
<p>And so to think, like, there is some responsibility.</p>
<p>This is not sort of, it&rsquo;s a beauty and a power,</p>
<p>and a terror to these ideas, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At that moment, it was certainly a question for Oppenheimer</p>
<p>and everybody who participated in that.</p>
<p>What is the responsible way to serve society</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sort of accidentally in this position</p>
<p>of being at the forefront of a development</p>
<p>that has a huge impact on society?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see my work a likelihood of having a huge impact</p>
<p>on the development of society itself.</p>
<p>But if I were you, working on AI,</p>
<p>I think that there is a possibility there.</p>
<p>And that it is, as a responsible scientist,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really not a good thing to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just the scientist here</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m figuring out what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re in a role where you have more of a podium</p>
<p>to influence things than other people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s your responsibility as a citizen</p>
<p>of the planet, or let me phrase it a little less shooty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you have an opportunity as a citizen of the planet</p>
<p>to make the world a better place,</p>
<p>which it would be sad to bypass.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a nice world without going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice to keep it going for a little bit longer.</p>
<p>Andrew, I&rsquo;m really honored that you sat down with me.</p>
<p>This is, thank you for your work.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Well, it was a really great conversation.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>You really covered a lot.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re able to discuss at this level</p>
<p>on so many different topics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pleasure.</p>
<p>It was super fun, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Andrew Strominger.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Werner Heisenberg.</p>
<p>Not only is the universe stranger than we think,</p>
<p>it is stranger than we can think.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
