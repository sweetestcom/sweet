    <p>Hello, dear listener. I&rsquo;m Megan, host of this series. And before we get into the show,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a minute to tell you about our sponsor, FIRE, the Foundation for Individual</p>
<p>Rights and Expression. We live in a moment when free speech, the bedrock of our democracy</p>
<p>and of all free societies, is often viewed as suspect, where many argue that the right</p>
<p>to free speech is too dangerous, and that even listening to ideological opponents is</p>
<p>morally wrong. Many people just don&rsquo;t see a problem with using the law, corporate power,</p>
<p>and even extraordinary social pressure to censor viewpoints they disagree with.</p>
<p>But many of us feel the costs of all this in our everyday lives. We feel it when we</p>
<p>self-censor, afraid to say what we really think, sometimes even in private conversations</p>
<p>with friends or loved ones. We feel it when we opt out of a growing number of public discussions,</p>
<p>afraid of the potential cost to our jobs and even our relationships.</p>
<p>FIRE shares a mission with this show, to remind us why a culture of free speech and open dialogue</p>
<p>matters. And regardless of how loud the calls for censorship are, FIRE&rsquo;s defense of that</p>
<p>culture is unshakable and invaluable. And if you want to remember why we choose freedom,</p>
<p>even for people we strenuously disagree with, you can learn more about FIRE&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>work at thefire.org. And now, on to the show.</p>
<p>This episode contains language that might not be suitable for children.</p>
<p>Can you talk to me about some of the threats that you&rsquo;ve received over the past few years?</p>
<p>There have been a lot. A huge amount, as every woman will know who speaks up on this issue,</p>
<p>a huge amount of, I want her to choke on my fat trans dick. You know, like, very sexualized</p>
<p>abuse. I don&rsquo;t think all of them mean it literally, but attempts to degrade, to humiliate.</p>
<p>People might say, well, that&rsquo;s not really a threat. And you know what, up to a point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably right, though it&rsquo;s very unpleasant to be on the receiving end of it, particularly</p>
<p>in the quantities I&rsquo;ve had it. Then I have had direct threats of violence. And I have</p>
<p>had people coming to my house where my kids live, and I&rsquo;ve had my address posted online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had what the police anyway would regard as credible threats. The pushback is often,</p>
<p>you are wealthy, you can afford security, you haven&rsquo;t been silenced. All true, right?</p>
<p>All of that&rsquo;s true. But I think that misses the point. The attempt to intimidate and silence</p>
<p>me is meant to serve as a warning to other women. And I say that because I have seen</p>
<p>it used that way. I have seen other women, and other women have told me, I literally</p>
<p>had someone say this to me the other day, I was told, look, look what happened to J.K.</p>
<p>Rowling. Watch yourself.</p>
<p>Chapter 3. A New Pyre.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have internet at all when Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone came out. So around about 98, I did</p>
<p>have internet, but would use it to look stuff up, like most of us do, and I would use it</p>
<p>for email. But I think some sort of unconscious spirit of self-preservation had stopped me</p>
<p>going and looking at Harry Potter, to the point where the internet fandom cropped up</p>
<p>in interviews, and I thought, well, I need to know about this, because I can&rsquo;t be ignorant</p>
<p>about this. I need to know. Well, I mean, I went online for the first time, and I just</p>
<p>had no idea. I just fell into this universe.</p>
<p>How deep into the fandom are you?</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>How many times do you think you&rsquo;ve read the books?</p>
<p>10 to 15 times through the series.</p>
<p>The magic came from the first book, and there was just no turning back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Megan Phelps-Roper, and we begin today in Orlando, Florida, at LeakyCon. LeakyCon</p>
<p>is one of dozens of Harry Potter conventions that are held around the world every year.</p>
<p>Okay, so we are at LeakyCon 2022, and it is pretty packed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan since, I think, 1998. So I really grew up with Harry Potter.</p>
<p>And like many of these events, it takes place in a convention hall filled with a bunch of</p>
<p>people who are dressed up as characters from the books.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m dressed up as Buckbeak today, and I&rsquo;m here with my husband, who&rsquo;s Sirius Black.</p>
<p>And then we have our witch hats and our wands.</p>
<p>I have my own prescription Harry Potter round glasses.</p>
<p>They sell handmade merchandise, they have meetups, and they even get tattoos.</p>
<p>This is just like my first childhood memory.</p>
<p>And how many Harry Potter tattoos do you think you&rsquo;ve done?</p>
<p>Way too many to count.</p>
<p>And when you ask them, a lot of these fans are quick to say that it wasn&rsquo;t just Harry</p>
<p>Potter that brought them together. It was the community they found surrounding it.</p>
<p>A lot of the community here at LeakyCon, they were my friends growing up. We were all online.</p>
<p>Specifically on the internet.</p>
<p>I think Harry Potter is so special because it was coming out right when everyone was</p>
<p>getting online.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, which would go on to become the best-selling book series of all time,</p>
<p>just happened to be published right as many people were getting their first introduction</p>
<p>to the internet.</p>
<p>And so there is a generation of people who grew up alongside both the characters in the</p>
<p>books and the ever-expanding power and influence of this new technology.</p>
<p>Pretty much as soon as I got on the internet, somehow, you know, at age 12, I must have</p>
<p>Googled Harry Potter.</p>
<p>In fact, for many fans, Harry Potter was their gateway to the internet. It was the first</p>
<p>thing they ever looked up on Yahoo or Google. It was their first email address.</p>
<p>We were able to talk to people from around the world and meet people that have the same</p>
<p>interests as us.</p>
<p>It was their first time talking to another person online. The first time they made a</p>
<p>screen name.</p>
<p>I was going to MuggleNet.com every day to get the updates, talking on message boards,</p>
<p>reading fan fiction on fanfiction.net. And it was just, it was such a special experience</p>
<p>to get to connect with so many people who you didn&rsquo;t know necessarily, but who felt</p>
<p>the same passion for Harry Potter.</p>
<p>One of the things that I think you have to understand about Harry Potter is it is one</p>
<p>of the biggest fan experiences that modern culture has to offer.</p>
<p>This is Helen Lewis, staff writer at The Atlantic, where she writes and reports about politics</p>
<p>and internet culture.</p>
<p>You know, at its peak, there were people writing hundreds of thousands of Harry Potter fan</p>
<p>fiction stories. So taking the characters from Harry Potter and writing your own stories</p>
<p>for them.</p>
<p>I was equally fascinated and alarmed, if I&rsquo;m honest.</p>
<p>Rowling says that when she saw the way her books were colliding with the still quite</p>
<p>new internet, much like her reaction to the book&rsquo;s surprise success, she was taken aback,</p>
<p>but also really intrigued.</p>
<p>What connections did you see people specifically, you know, making with the books?</p>
<p>Well, there was the really sweet sorting of yourself into houses, which I think speaks</p>
<p>deeply to children and also to adolescents.</p>
<p>Are you wearing yellow because you identify as a Hufflepuff?</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>There was obviously the championing of different romantic combinations, which was very sweet.</p>
<p>Why Hermione and Draco?</p>
<p>Who did not want the bad boy?</p>
<p>We can change him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was everybody&rsquo;s fantasy, right?</p>
<p>Little groups of mutual support were made, you know, real friendships were made.</p>
<p>If you ever want to feel good about the world, go search the internet for friendships forged</p>
<p>by Harry Potter.</p>
<p>There are so many places where fans are just gushing.</p>
<p>Like one user says, my best friends in high school were a group of people I met because</p>
<p>we loved talking about Harry Potter online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy that I&rsquo;m alive at the same time as the internet.</p>
<p>I watched it happening.</p>
<p>I could see really beautiful interactions happening online.</p>
<p>And you know, in later years, I&rsquo;ve met people, I met my best friend on MuggleNet, you know,</p>
<p>my husband and I connected over Harry Potter.</p>
<p>We are wearing our matching shirts from when we got engaged.</p>
<p>And we had a complete Harry Potter wedding where we wore house robes instead of tuxes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s happened time and time again.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful, it&rsquo;s just a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So huge positives came out of that.</p>
<p>The biggest of the early fan websites was called MuggleNet.</p>
<p>It was set up in 1999 by a 12-year-old homeschool kid in Indiana who could have had no idea</p>
<p>how much the site was going to change his life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s partly because Rowling eventually embraced it.</p>
<p>She was one of the first authors, the first creators of any kind, really, to invest time</p>
<p>and energy communicating directly with her fans online, doing interviews, answering fan</p>
<p>questions, really catering to the community she saw forming there.</p>
<p>But she also told me that on at least one occasion, she went into one of these forums</p>
<p>anonymously.</p>
<p>So I chose a random name that was not a Potter-related name.</p>
<p>I was almost scared, even though they&rsquo;ve all got Potter-related names, that I would choose</p>
<p>a name that was a little, I don&rsquo;t know, I was just scared I would somehow self-reveal.</p>
<p>So I go into this chat room, and people are sharing some theories.</p>
<p>And I gave an opinion that was very bland.</p>
<p>And I got rounded on by users who told me in no uncertain terms just to get out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar in that room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m clearly an idiot who doesn&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>But I genuinely, and I left.</p>
<p>I left.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, do you know what, I promise you this is what I thought.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written three and a half books, I think it would have been at that time, where bullying</p>
<p>is such a theme from the very first page, where bullying and authoritarian behavior</p>
<p>is held to be one of the worst of human ills.</p>
<p>Look what just happened.</p>
<p>And these people who call themselves such fans of this franchise, what if I&rsquo;d been a</p>
<p>12?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I was a pretty robust person.</p>
<p>But what if I&rsquo;d been some 12-year-old who&rsquo;s excited to go into this room, and is immediately</p>
<p>caustically chastised for not belonging?</p>
<p>Just kick someone out because they&rsquo;re new.</p>
<p>And I thought that was so interesting, that you&rsquo;re passionate about these books.</p>
<p>And yet, in the course of living, you are behaving in a way that I depict as one of</p>
<p>the worst and most stupid human behaviors.</p>
<p>This being the early days of the internet, it was also the early days of a kind of social</p>
<p>behavior that we now generally know as trolling.</p>
<p>There were definitely individual trolls on the MuggleNet forums, purely there to be objectionable.</p>
<p>And even though they were just this small part of the community.</p>
<p>It was a fringe, but it was definitely there.</p>
<p>Having noticed that they did seem to have outsized power.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it&rsquo;s kind of amusing that this is how you&rsquo;re spending your time.</p>
<p>But as time went on, I started to really see it as bullying.</p>
<p>There was an edge of picking off vulnerable people.</p>
<p>And I was very aware by that time, early 2000s, that a lot of kids who felt themselves to</p>
<p>be outsiders, who were vulnerable, were finding themselves in Potter.</p>
<p>Why do you like Harry Potter?</p>
<p>He felt like an outsider, and he felt like he didn&rsquo;t belong, and I really, that really</p>
<p>resonated with me.</p>
<p>Like, I had not such a great childhood, and I think a kid with not such a great childhood</p>
<p>actually escaped to something else in a book.</p>
<p>Many of the people that like Harry Potter tend to be the ones outside, especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a child that isn&rsquo;t well loved.</p>
<p>I felt protective of those people, so watching trolls operate in those spaces increasingly</p>
<p>did not amuse me.</p>
<p>It began to concern me.</p>
<p>Both of us had challenging, crappy upbringing and childhoods, and when you talk to people</p>
<p>that are like the really crazy fans, I feel like that&rsquo;s something that comes up more often</p>
<p>than not.</p>
<p>And I think Harry Potter was one of the things that was just always there for people.</p>
<p>You grow up feeling like the weird one of the bunch, but then you realize there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many other people out there like you, and then you don&rsquo;t feel so alone anymore, you</p>
<p>know?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the best part about Harry Potter.</p>
<p>And indeed, I actually ended up in long-term pen pal relationships with some of those people.</p>
<p>You know, I can remember a situation where a young person had written a letter that resulted</p>
<p>in my then assistant and I calling that child&rsquo;s school.</p>
<p>We were very, very concerned that this child might be about to kill themselves.</p>
<p>I just was hyper aware, and I remain hyper aware, that the Potter books were a refuge</p>
<p>for some people who were, for very different reasons, very vulnerable.</p>
<p>One of the groups that really gravitated both to the Harry Potter books and to the online</p>
<p>fandom were gay teenagers.</p>
<p>The president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights lobbying organization</p>
<p>in the US, once referred to Rowling as a writer whose work has inspired countless LGBTQ young</p>
<p>people to imagine a world of acceptance and inclusivity.</p>
<p>Were you surprised by the way that gay teenagers in particular really started to connect with</p>
<p>the books?</p>
<p>Did that surprise you at all?</p>
<p>Honestly, it didn&rsquo;t because the amazing thing about the Wizarding World is you walk through</p>
<p>that wall in Diagon Alley, and while human nature remains the same, and that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that I was setting out to depict, human nature remains the same.</p>
<p>If you can do magic, the ludicrous things that we discriminate about in the Muggle world</p>
<p>really are utterly immaterial.</p>
<p>What do you think were the messages in your book that misfits people who felt like outsiders,</p>
<p>what messages were they connecting with?</p>
<p>I think that some of the most sympathetic characters, like Lupin, for example, who is</p>
<p>stigmatized through something that he can&rsquo;t help, can&rsquo;t control, some of the most sympathetic</p>
<p>characters are people who are grappling with things that may be stigmatized, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all imperfect.</p>
<p>Harry has anger issues, Ron can be, I think I call him a git quite a lot in the books,</p>
<p>but together they are more than the sum of their parts, together they grow, they find</p>
<p>family in each other, and there&rsquo;s real human beauty in that.</p>
<p>I suppose the Dursleys are my epitome of a very authoritarian and conformist world that</p>
<p>demands absolute obedience, and that&rsquo;s not the world you enter when you go to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Our grade in school was the same year each book came out, so my exact class almost grew</p>
<p>up with Harry.</p>
<p>We were 11 when Harry was 11.</p>
<p>As each book came out, these characters figured out a lot of normal life things right along</p>
<p>with us.</p>
<p>Many fans credit the morals of the books with helping shape their morals growing up.</p>
<p>Friendship and loyalty and bravery and doing the right thing when the right thing is hard</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>The way people pull together, they&rsquo;re different, they don&rsquo;t all exactly agree with one another,</p>
<p>but they can say, okay, this is the common good, and this is what we&rsquo;re going to work</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>We need a whole lot more of that.</p>
<p>And as they got older and went from middle schoolers lined up at the midnight release</p>
<p>parties to young adults heading off to college, some of those morals also became more mature.</p>
<p>Things like media literacy, understanding when maybe the media is lying to you, and</p>
<p>having to really think critically.</p>
<p>To many of these fans, Rowling became something of a moral authority in their lives, giving</p>
<p>them this series to grow up with and being this figure that they could look up to.</p>
<p>I idolized her for a really long time.</p>
<p>She was a great feminist icon.</p>
<p>Online we called her Jo because we felt like we were on a first name basis.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us actually kind of feel like she was our mom in some ways.</p>
<p>She was just the mom of the Harry Potter fandom.</p>
<p>I became aware that I was to an extent becoming an idealized figure, and probably an idealized</p>
<p>mother figure.</p>
<p>And that is a complex position to find yourself in.</p>
<p>And for me particularly, it&rsquo;s complex because I am a maternal person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re seeing something in me that isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>And I have had quite maternal relationships with some individual fans who&rsquo;ve been going</p>
<p>through bad times.</p>
<p>But to be idealized is not something I want.</p>
<p>I am a human being.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have written these books if I weren&rsquo;t a human being, and aware of human frailty</p>
<p>and human imperfection.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very aware that idealization comes at a price.</p>
<p>Last summer, in a grand celebration of literature, Harvard Square and Harvard Yard was transformed</p>
<p>into Hogwarts Square.</p>
<p>This summer festival celebrated the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.</p>
<p>I want to talk about your 2008 commencement address at Harvard.</p>
<p>At this point, you are about 10 years since the days you were struggling in that small</p>
<p>flat.</p>
<p>You had become one of the most beloved authors of all time, and you&rsquo;re speaking at the most</p>
<p>prestigious school in America, arguably the world.</p>
<p>Her books have set sales records and have won many awards, probably because the Harry</p>
<p>Potter stories provide a familiar backdrop for readers who can empathize with the young</p>
<p>protagonist adrift in a sometimes cruel and challenging world.</p>
<p>And so at this point, for better or for worse, you do seem to be seen as a moral leader.</p>
<p>And the person who introduces you says this, actually.</p>
<p>In addition to her vast contributions to literature, she is also noted for the social,</p>
<p>moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans, a notable philanthropist.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a remarkable thing to go back and watch.</p>
<p>And now I give you Ms. J.K. Rowling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re up there, dressed in robes, standing in front of this generation that grew up alongside</p>
<p>Harry Potter, and you&rsquo;re talking to them as they are launching into the world.</p>
<p>The first thing I would like to say is thank you.</p>
<p>Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honor, but the weeks of fear and nausea I</p>
<p>have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight.</p>
<p>On this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success,</p>
<p>I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure.</p>
<p>And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called real life, I want to extol</p>
<p>the crucial importance of imagination.</p>
<p>And your speech is very personal and vulnerable.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun.</p>
<p>That period of my life was a dark one.</p>
<p>So why do I talk about the benefits of failure?</p>
<p>Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential.</p>
<p>I was set free because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and</p>
<p>I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea.</p>
<p>And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.</p>
<p>But you also challenged them.</p>
<p>Now you might think that I chose my second theme, the importance of imagination, because</p>
<p>of the part it played in rebuilding my life, but that is not wholly so.</p>
<p>I have learned to value imagination in a much broader sense.</p>
<p>In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us</p>
<p>to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared.</p>
<p>You tell them that they need to be empathetic to people who are not like them.</p>
<p>Unlike any other creature on this planet, human beings can learn and understand without</p>
<p>having experienced.</p>
<p>What is more, those who choose not to empathize enable real monsters, for without ever committing</p>
<p>an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it through our own apathy.</p>
<p>We do not need magic to transform our world.</p>
<p>We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already.</p>
<p>We have the power to imagine better.</p>
<p>And the crowd just goes wild.</p>
<p>And they love it, and they love you.</p>
<p>But at this point, it&rsquo;s really hard to imagine that you would be welcome at Harvard at all,</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;d get that kind of reception from that crowd.</p>
<p>From that crowd.</p>
<p>And what I want to understand from your point of view is what changed, and maybe when did</p>
<p>you start to notice it changing?</p>
<p>I would say about a decade ago, I started to become very interested in what was going</p>
<p>on online, and concerned about what was going on online.</p>
<p>I noticed a real shift.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>

<p>I am a person who can be pretty obsessive about my health.</p>
<p>My routine typically includes things like 10,000 steps a day, and smoothies, and strength</p>
<p>workouts.</p>
<p>And yes, I am even one of those people who forces myself to take cold showers even in</p>
<p>the winter.</p>
<p>But a lot of that flew out the window when I had a baby six months ago, and I especially</p>
<p>struggled to make sure that I was getting good nutrition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was so excited to add AG-1 from Athletic Greens to my routine.</p>
<p>I love that I can get 75 vitamins, minerals, and nutrients from whole food sources just</p>
<p>by adding a scoop of AG-1 to my smoothie in the morning, or mixing it with a glass of</p>
<p>cold water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really simple habit to get into, and it&rsquo;s so much easier than swallowing</p>
<p>a bunch of pills, which is what I did for years and came to completely dread.</p>
<p>AG-1 is different, and it makes me feel grateful that even during the most chaotic times in</p>
<p>my life, I can do this small, powerful thing to help me cover my nutritional bases every</p>
<p>day.</p>

<p>So in the early days of the internet, by definition, the people who were on there were going to</p>
<p>be people who are really passionate about the future of computers.</p>
<p>This is writer and internet historian Angela Nagel.</p>
<p>People with a lot of imagination and maybe tendency towards utopian thinking.</p>
<p>The internet is for me the hope for humanity.</p>
<p>The internet provides everybody a voice and the chance to be heard, which is the whole</p>
<p>point about democracy.</p>
<p>They had an idea that the internet would bring democracy and freedom to the world and that</p>
<p>it would be impossible for dictatorships and tyranny to coexist with the internet.</p>
<p>In 2007, when Rowling released the final installment in the Harry Potter series, and in 2008 when</p>
<p>she gave that address at Harvard, this was a time when internet usage around the world</p>
<p>was exploding, both in terms of how many people were gaining access to the internet and in</p>
<p>terms of how much we used it, especially because it coincided with the invention of the smart</p>
<p>phone.</p>
<p>And Nagel says that it was also a time when it seemed like some of those optimistic dreams</p>
<p>of what the internet could usher in were coming true.</p>
<p>I guess the first manifestation that maybe proved to those utopians that they could be</p>
<p>right is that you saw things like the Arab Spring, where protesters used social media</p>
<p>to gather in public squares and protest dictatorships.</p>
<p>And you also had the election of Barack Obama, which was very much seen as the internet generation&rsquo;s</p>
<p>president.</p>
<p>I never thought in my lifetime that it would happen, but it happened tonight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reality and we did it.</p>
<p>America is now more united, we did it.</p>
<p>People were becoming more progressive and more multicultural.</p>
<p>Also there was this very powerful idea of the global village, all humanity as one, sort</p>
<p>of in this one collective consciousness on the internet.</p>
<p>But then, then of course, inevitably things started to go a little bit weird.</p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans say they feel more and more like a stranger in their own country.</p>
<p>This has, over the last few decades, increasingly empowered the extremes of political parties.</p>
<p>These can often be traced back to the rise of online extremism.</p>
<p>Elected officials have been shot at community meetings.</p>
<p>This increasing habit of demonizing political opponents creates a dangerous climate.</p>
<p>Is the internet killing democracy?</p>
<p>So, what happened?</p>
<p>Many people blame this disruptive technology that we call social media, which over the</p>
<p>last two decades went from something that barely existed at all to the single most powerful</p>
<p>tool for communication in history, shaping our politics, our societies, and our sense</p>
<p>of reality.</p>
<p>Now it is undeniable that social media has done tangible good, helping people like me</p>
<p>expand our moral circle and find our partners and friends.</p>
<p>Just a brief homage to social media from me, it was conversations on Twitter that helped</p>
<p>me leave what many describe as a religious cult, and it also introduced me to my husband,</p>
<p>the father of my two children.</p>
<p>However, over the past few years, many, including some of the very optimists who helped design</p>
<p>the internet as we know it today, have been outspoken in saying that social media has</p>
<p>corrupted the dream of what the internet could do for the world.</p>
<p>Like computer scientist Jaron Lanier, who argues that social media poses a real threat</p>
<p>to a pluralistic society.</p>
<p>Society has been gradually darkened by this scheme in which everyone is under surveillance</p>
<p>all the time, and everyone is under this mild version of behavior modification all</p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made people jittery and cranky, it&rsquo;s made teens especially depressed, which can</p>
<p>be quite severe, but it&rsquo;s made our politics kind of unreal.</p>
<p>And he, along with former Google engineer Tristan Harris, have focused a lot of their</p>
<p>concern around social media, on the algorithms and the profit motives of big tech.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tendency to think here that this is just human nature, you know, that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>people are polarized and this is just playing out, it&rsquo;s a mirror, it&rsquo;s holding up a mirror</p>
<p>to society.</p>
<p>But what it&rsquo;s really doing is it&rsquo;s an amplifier for the worst parts of us.</p>
<p>But far less attention has been paid to the question of where certain polarizing beliefs</p>
<p>and norms began to gain a foothold online.</p>
<p>And the answer turns out to be, in part, these small, strange, and fascinating corners</p>
<p>of the internet.</p>
<p>When you started writing and doing PhD research into these smaller, peculiar online subcultures,</p>
<p>did people think you&rsquo;d lost your mind?</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>I had many, many arguments with people where they said, oh, what does this matter, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just some obscure, some people on the internet, it&rsquo;s not real life.</p>
<p>And I kept telling people, no, you&rsquo;re getting this wrong, this is going to change the world,</p>
<p>this is hugely important, and it&rsquo;s going to be massively impacting your life in a few</p>
<p>years from now.</p>
<p>In 2017, Angela Nagle published a book called Kill All Normies, which helped explain the</p>
<p>rise of the alt-right.</p>
<p>But it also revealed, in a powerful way, this handful of online forums and websites, places</p>
<p>on the internet that most people had never even heard of or spent any real time on, and</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;ve come to have a profound impact on almost every aspect of our politics and</p>
<p>society.</p>
<p>So, in my book, I focused on two main forums because I felt that they were possibly the</p>
<p>most influential, and they also represented very politically different groups.</p>
<p>The first of these two forums was Tumblr.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by Tumblr culture, and for those who don&rsquo;t know, Tumblr is a micro-blogging</p>
<p>website and is very popular with young women.</p>
<p>Which was also one of the key places where Rowling says she started to notice these changes</p>
<p>online.</p>
<p>I started to be intrigued by the use of the word identify.</p>
<p>This was something I was seeing rising in culture, particularly from the younger generation.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see that as necessarily a malign thing, because I think we all have an identity,</p>
<p>and identity is important to all of us for a stable sense of self.</p>
<p>But I was noticing something that I thought was interesting, and then that began to disturb</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Tumblr went live in 2007, and it gained some popularity in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>The whole idea of the site was built off of the popularity of blogging, or online journaling.</p>
<p>But unlike other blogging sites, Tumblr tapped into what would eventually make social media</p>
<p>so addictive.</p>
<p>Tumblr is like Twitter but longer, so you can reblog people&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>Again, Helen Lewis, staff writer at The Atlantic.</p>
<p>So it has a kind of viral element to it, but it was also very image-based.</p>
<p>Tumblr was kind of a cross between Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>And for early Tumblr users, it was just as addictive as those apps would eventually become.</p>
<p>And these people on Tumblr largely fit into a few different groups.</p>
<p>One of them was fans.</p>
<p>Fans of Twilight and Doctor Who and, of course, a ton of Harry Potter fans.</p>
<p>But here, they no longer had to log into chat rooms or poke around message boards to connect</p>
<p>with other fans, because on Tumblr, it was all in one big scrollable feed.</p>
<p>And it became a big place for teenagers to hang out, to draw their own comics, to write</p>
<p>their own fan fiction, to engage in all kinds of fandom, essentially, around these big properties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to know that a lot of the people on Tumblr were anonymous.</p>
<p>And over time, the site became inundated with porn.</p>
<p>The other big group that was on Tumblr were masturbators.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very sexual environment, because the moderation was, like, super loose.</p>
<p>So that obviously is going to attract the attention of many different groups.</p>
<p>This is Catherine D., aka Default Friend, writer, internet historian, and admitted former</p>
<p>Tumblr addict.</p>
<p>A lot of, like, fetishists and pornographers and sex workers, and you also have a lot of</p>
<p>teenagers.</p>
<p>You know, it was a very odd place to be sometimes, Tumblr, because you would have this just endless</p>
<p>porn interspersed with very cute kawaii comics and anime and very kind of infantilized cultures.</p>
<p>And you have a lot of, like, horny teenagers who are exploring their sexuality and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drawing erotic fan art, or they&rsquo;re even posting photos of themselves.</p>
<p>Years later, Tumblr would be singled out by law enforcement for being a major source of</p>
<p>child pornography online.</p>
<p>And that ultimately forced them to moderate their content.</p>
<p>But back in the early 2010s, it was pretty much a free-for-all.</p>
<p>And then finally, you have the activists, who are giving you new language to describe</p>
<p>your experience, potentially giving you a sense of meaning.</p>
<p>Like other social media sites eventually would, Tumblr attracted a lot of activists.</p>
<p>And in Tumblr&rsquo;s case, it was activism particularly around sex positivity and gender identity.</p>
<p>These groups had a huge influence on a lot of different subcultures that ended up forming</p>
<p>on Tumblr.</p>
<p>And all of that together really creates a Tinder box.</p>
<p>And so this place full of teenagers and activists and fans and fetishists and porn, it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just a place where you could invent a new character in your Harry Potter fan fiction.</p>
<p>It ultimately became a place where users could create and experiment with new identities</p>
<p>for themselves.</p>
<p>The thing I remember thinking about it most is, it was almost like a huge live action</p>
<p>role-playing game.</p>
<p>Tumblr was a place that was allowing people to explore these new forms of identification.</p>
<p>I would say that Tumblr is probably most notorious for generating hundreds of gender identities.</p>
<p>This is Natalie Nguyen, a popular online commentator better known as ContraPoints.</p>
<p>I am a YouTuber.</p>
<p>That is, I guess, a profession.</p>
<p>And my videos are about social issues or politics or media.</p>
<p>A lot of it has been focused on gender because I&rsquo;m a transgender woman.</p>
<p>I transitioned in 2017 and have been doing videos pretty consistently ever since.</p>
<p>People still talk about, quote, Tumblr genders.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s 76 genders.</p>
<p>That was a meme for years.</p>
<p>You could be lumigender, that is having a gender that was, you know, illuminating like</p>
<p>a light or ambigender, pangender, xenogender.</p>
<p>They really embraced this idea of genderqueer, which is, you know, a word that was used before</p>
<p>non-binary.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of talk about otherkin.</p>
<p>So otherkin were people who said that although they looked like they were human, they were</p>
<p>actually wolves or dragons.</p>
<p>And they were quite insistent about this, that this was a, this was an identity that</p>
<p>you could adopt.</p>
<p>This is where you get people who say things like, my gender is a cloud.</p>
<p>How much of it was just playfulness and how much appeared to be like sincere self-discovery?</p>
<p>Well, I think that playfulness is part of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Natalie Nguyen appreciated this aspect of Tumblr, and she says that it&rsquo;s exactly why</p>
<p>some people like her were drawn to the site.</p>
<p>For a lot of young queer people, engaging in this imaginative play about all the possibilities</p>
<p>of gender was like a way for them to experiment with different imaginative possibilities or</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s possible with gender.</p>
<p>There was a culture that was encouraged on Tumblr, which was to be able to describe your</p>
<p>unique non-normative self.</p>
<p>Again, Angela Nagel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s to some extent a feature of modern society anyway, but it was taken to such an</p>
<p>extreme that people began to describe this as the snowflake, the person who constructs</p>
<p>a totally kind of boutique and unique identity for themselves, and then guards that identity</p>
<p>in a very, very sensitive way and reacts in an enraged way when anyone does not respect</p>
<p>the uniqueness of their identity.</p>
<p>And Nagel says that these norms around identity, and this increased sensitivity to identities</p>
<p>of all kinds, it spread across huge swaths of Tumblr.</p>
<p>So that was very much the culture of Tumblr.</p>
<p>And at the same time, you had on the other side of the political spectrum, you could</p>
<p>say, the most insensitive culture imaginable, which was the culture of 4chan.</p>
<p>And the culture of 4chan was really based around transgression and offensiveness and</p>
<p>the kind of fun of being offensive.</p>
<p>About like 30 to 45 minutes ago, I beat the fuck out of my dick so goddamn hard that I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even feel my left leg.</p>
<p>My left leg has went&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, the entire culture became a sort of a one-upmanship of who can post the most</p>
<p>outrageous or offensive thing imaginable.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re going to make Holocaust jokes and they&rsquo;re going to make Anne Frank jokes.</p>
<p>Making an ethnostate is hard work.</p>
<p>I mean, you really got to ask yourself, what eugenics programs are you going to use?</p>
<p>What type of plumbing do you use in your internment camps?</p>
<p>So 4chan, if you&rsquo;ve never heard of it, it was actually somewhat similar to Tumblr in</p>
<p>that it was largely anonymous and text and image based.</p>
<p>There were a lot of fans there, especially anime, and it had lots of porn and lots of</p>
<p>young people.</p>
<p>But where Tumblr attracted a lot of girls and women, 4chan skewed way more male.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, 4chan made headlines after users there pulled this stunt that generated some</p>
<p>panic about how hackers were able to access people&rsquo;s private photos in the cloud.</p>
<p>Several A-list stars are the target of what appears to be one of the biggest celebrity</p>
<p>hacking leaks.</p>
<p>Users of private nude photographs were apparently accessed from phones and leaked online.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lawrence and several other celebrities had their personal nude photos stolen out</p>
<p>of the cloud and leaked on 4chan.</p>
<p>Do we even know who is this 4chan person or website?</p>
<p>He may, and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re going to be able to get some more information.</p>
<p>Where users shared and sold the nudes, made gifs and memes out of them, and celebrated</p>
<p>how much attention this got.</p>
<p>So in a lot of ways, the norms and mores of Tumblr and 4chan end up being these kind</p>
<p>of mirror images of one another.</p>
<p>You have this kind of reinforcing culture of ultra-sensitivity on one side, and this</p>
<p>reinforcing culture of anti-sensitivity on the other side.</p>
<p>And both of these cultures are growing at the same time.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever heard a kind of right-wing activist railing against woke culture, then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be hearing them condemning phrases that were popularized on Tumblr.</p>
<p>Microaggression, trigger warnings, Latinx, non-binary, two-spirit, transgender.</p>
<p>You know, even the idea of being cis as opposed to being trans, you know, the idea that everybody</p>
<p>was one of those two things.</p>
<p>If you dig through the Wayback Machine or Google Analytics, you can see that many of</p>
<p>these words and phrases that have become pretty mainstream on the political left, and have</p>
<p>become the focus of a lot of backlash from the political right, many of them can be traced</p>
<p>back to their increased use on Tumblr.</p>
<p>People start Googling them between 2011 and 2014.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you see the first spike.</p>
<p>And this is also the same period when the use of social media in general was exploding.</p>
<p>So more and more people were spending more and more of their time on these platforms.</p>
<p>And you can go back and kind of watch how these ideas start to migrate outward from</p>
<p>Tumblr.</p>
<p>So a good example of this is the word Latinx, right?</p>
<p>If you look at early articles about the word Latinx, so these are articles that are coming</p>
<p>out between 2013 and 2015, a lot of them reference Tumblr.</p>
<p>Gabby Rivera of Autostraddle wrote, the word Latinx has been appearing on my Tumblr dashboard</p>
<p>for the last year.</p>
<p>The website Latino Rebels also ran an article about the term, and they were like, this word</p>
<p>comes from Tumblr and we don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the American blogosphere and nobody in Latin America uses it.</p>
<p>Even though some of these ideas were openly mocked by many people, others became quite</p>
<p>mainstream quite quickly.</p>
<p>So like when Facebook announced it was suddenly offering like 40 different gender identities</p>
<p>and a lot of people were confused, do you think it&rsquo;s right to say that essentially they</p>
<p>were just catching up to what Tumblr had been doing for years at that point?</p>
<p>Oh, of course.</p>
<p>Facebook was definitely playing catch up.</p>
<p>The idea of privilege was very big.</p>
<p>You know, the idea that you have white privilege, male privilege, cis privilege, that really</p>
<p>came from Tumblr and has had a sort of odd effect on discourse ever since.</p>
<p>And things that we wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized as being offensive suddenly were considered</p>
<p>offensive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real culture of like calling not only people, but media properties and the</p>
<p>creators of those media properties problematic on Tumblr.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really where you get cancel culture in a sense, which takes sensitivity</p>
<p>and the strengthening of taboos to such a point that anyone who transgresses them should</p>
<p>be just totally removed from the conversation.</p>
<p>People online did discover that there is a kind of clout to be gained from discovering</p>
<p>what is problematic about a popular figure.</p>
<p>There used to be a Tumblr blog called Your Fave is Problematic.</p>
<p>Your Fave is Problematic was a Tumblr account created in 2013 by an anonymous American high</p>
<p>school student.</p>
<p>Initially, it was just a place where she would call out celebrities and artists, as well</p>
<p>as their hardcore fans on Tumblr.</p>
<p>It was just like a list of celebrities or popular figures and all of their sort of social</p>
<p>justice sins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be a call out of Jennifer Lawrence, who wore fake dreads for a photo shoot, or</p>
<p>Tina Fey for a rape joke on 30 Rock.</p>
<p>You know, Justin Bieber did cultural appropriation in this, and Miley Cyrus did that.</p>
<p>And so if you like them, you&rsquo;re a terrible person.</p>
<p>But quickly, and to this high school Tumblr user&rsquo;s surprise, the account grew massively</p>
<p>popular on Tumblr, and it started to create these real backlashes, leading to big stars</p>
<p>issuing apologies.</p>
<p>And these fandoms that were such a big presence on Tumblr, they were increasingly turning</p>
<p>on the very creators of the books and films and television shows that they were such big</p>
<p>fans of, whether it was Stephanie Meyer, who wrote the Twilight series and was accused</p>
<p>of being racist, or Anne Rice, who was accused of sexism.</p>
<p>So this is happening over and over and over again, and people on other parts of the internet</p>
<p>are making fun of Tumblr constantly about it.</p>
<p>And JK Rowling was not immune.</p>
<p>First rolling backlash was in 2016, when she wrote about Native American wizards.</p>
<p>And she wrote about skinwalkers, this idea of malevolent wizards who disguise themselves</p>
<p>as animals.</p>
<p>And the outcry then was about cultural appropriation, which is a very Tumblr concern, cultural appropriation,</p>
<p>the idea that, you know, you&rsquo;re borrowing bits and pieces from other cultures, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to a music festival and you&rsquo;re wearing a Native American headdress or whatever</p>
<p>it might be.</p>
<p>And so in 2016, JK Rowling was accused of Native American appropriation, of appropriating</p>
<p>another culture.</p>
<p>And that was the first time I thought, ah, she is no longer left wing enough for her</p>
<p>fans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Do you remember how it felt when you first started to see those things?</p>
<p>I definitely saw it in the context of this is happening everywhere.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t take it super personally.</p>
<p>But I was seeing this happen across the board to artists.</p>
<p>And there was a kind of puritanism that was rising that to me seemed very illiberal.</p>
<p>So very contrary, I suppose, to my values, to my core values.</p>
<p>So yeah, it happened to me.</p>
<p>I was watching it happening to other artists.</p>
<p>I was watching it happening to other sort of properties, creative properties.</p>
<p>And it was inevitable I was going to be hit with it too.</p>
<p>Was it enjoyable?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did I take it really personally?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the honest answer.</p>
<p>Cancel culture is probably as old as humanity in a way.</p>
<p>But in the style of the internet, I think Tumblr was very, very central to that.</p>
<p>Your fave is problematic, even at the peak of its popularity, only had around 50,000</p>
<p>followers.</p>
<p>The fans who turned on these different creators, they didn&rsquo;t represent anything close to the</p>
<p>majority view of the artist in the hot seat, or even the average fan&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p>But then, when the battles on Tumblr became enmeshed on another platform, its effects</p>
<p>became much more far reaching.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when it gets to Twitter that it&rsquo;s this monster that is a complete runaway train.</p>
<p>Twitter is like, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s like being on the National Mall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like being in Times Square.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re having these fights, right?</p>
<p>Like the biggest public forum.</p>
<p>You know, every journalist in the world is on Twitter, practically.</p>
<p>And politicians are on it, public figures are on it.</p>
<p>So that really changes the dynamic.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s not fandom wars, it&rsquo;s like, Twitter is politics, full stop.</p>
<p>Twitter had two things that Tumblr lacked.</p>
<p>One was a much larger user base.</p>
<p>And the other was the presence of a huge number of journalists from around the world.</p>
<p>Those journalists began to pick up these stories, publishing them in mainstream media</p>
<p>outlets.</p>
<p>And so this small group of people, shaped by the norms of Tumblr, appeared to have a</p>
<p>much bigger presence in society than it actually did.</p>
<p>That gave them more of an ability to influence politics.</p>
<p>And it also fueled an aggressive backlash from places like 4chan.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Social justice warrior.</p>
<p>4chan users delighted in developing new ways to inflict reputational damage on people,</p>
<p>who they saw as embodying these values from Tumblr.</p>
<p>A very common thing, for example, was raiding a person&rsquo;s Wikipedia page and filling it</p>
<p>up with negative material, or putting out a post about a person&rsquo;s sexual assault.</p>
<p>Putting out, like, fake revenge pornography, spreading outrageous lies about people.</p>
<p>They made fake accounts and photoshopped pictures and videos.</p>
<p>They targeted people in the media, who they saw as perpetuating the culture of sensitivity</p>
<p>Tumblr, giving more and more power to that side of the debate.</p>
<p>Users on 4chan started doxing them, swatting their houses, and sending them death threats.</p>
<p>That was sort of very common from the, let&rsquo;s say, anti-political correctness side.</p>
<p>But then on the other side, you also had things like getting people fired for a joke that</p>
<p>was a bit off-color.</p>
<p>You know, publicly shaming people for something that they said many years previous that has</p>
<p>since become politically incorrect.</p>
<p>Is this like the phenomenon of digging up old tweets?</p>
<p>Yes, digging up old tweets.</p>
<p>One example would be something like, you find a picture of somebody, and they&rsquo;re white,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wearing a traditional Chinese dress at an event.</p>
<p>And somebody says, this is cultural appropriation.</p>
<p>Those kind of deliberate attempts to use public shaming and moral pressure to destroy people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>livelihoods and careers.</p>
<p>And Nagel says that over time, the tactics and norms that emerged from these subcultures</p>
<p>that felt embattled, they began to really shape the language and norms of internet culture</p>
<p>more broadly.</p>
<p>And so we had to deal with a new sort of mean, cruel quality to the internet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s fascinating about this is that the sensitive, politically correct culture of</p>
<p>Tumblr is driven to greater and greater extremes because they see the enemy culture that comes</p>
<p>from places like 4chan.</p>
<p>And likewise, the culture of 4chan is sort of inspired to become more and more extreme</p>
<p>because they see the culture of Tumblr.</p>
<p>And so both are not only reinforcing the culture within their communities, but by observing</p>
<p>the other side, they feel more like their political project is necessary.</p>
<p>And therefore, they have to become more and more extreme in order to fight this evil in</p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about what you&rsquo;ve described as a witch hunt impulse when it comes to the</p>
<p>dynamics of online cancel culture.</p>
<p>What is that impulse?</p>
<p>And what parallels do you draw maybe to the witch hunts of old?</p>
<p>Well, I think that people, there&rsquo;s a lot of sources of aggression.</p>
<p>I think that aggression is a basic human instinct.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of free-form aggression in search of a target.</p>
<p>Natalie Wynn has a video with the title, Cancel Culture, where she goes into detail about</p>
<p>what she sees as some of the underlying and very human impulses inspiring people on Tumblr</p>
<p>and beyond.</p>
<p>Freud discusses this, like morality can be sadistic, the sadistic superego, he calls it.</p>
<p>And the idea is that you kind of use that kind of punishing, shaming, moral condemnation.</p>
<p>That becomes an outlet for aggression in itself.</p>
<p>And so I think for people, it can become a way to attack someone while also kind of feeling</p>
<p>good about themselves, which is a very, I think, tempting place to be, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trashing someone, but you feel like you&rsquo;re crusading.</p>
<p>I was starting to think about this a lot, subcultures that have their own rigid rules,</p>
<p>acceptable beliefs, non-acceptable beliefs, everything becoming very reductive.</p>
<p>I was also deeply concerned by it because to me, it was a rise of the kind of authoritarianism</p>
<p>and lack of empathy that is in all of my books.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in literally every book I write.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that I stand against more than any other, it is authoritarianism.</p>
<p>And that cuts across political persuasions, cuts through atheists all the way through</p>
<p>to various different religions.</p>
<p>So I was definitely seeing that.</p>
<p>And I was becoming really concerned.</p>
<p>I think the first time I became really interested in what was going on, sort of culturally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken some time out of my busy schedule, being fabulous and doing my hair, to prepare</p>
<p>a speech for you.</p>
<p>Well, a few remarks, really.</p>
<p>It was Milo Yiannopoulos.</p>
<p>Feminism is cancer.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>The outright provocateur, I suppose you would call him.</p>
<p>In 2016, this battle online really started to move offline.</p>
<p>And for many people, the person who signaled this shift was an editor from Breitbart, who</p>
<p>essentially was the culture of 4chan in human form, Milo Yiannopoulos.</p>
<p>I think Milo Yiannopoulos was very much an embodiment of the moment where the culture</p>
<p>of places like 4chan sort of bursts into the mainstream.</p>
<p>As Milo was booked to speak on college campuses, he was increasingly met with protesters demanding</p>
<p>that he be stopped, leading to real political violence.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m watching from across the pond as he tries to speak on various campuses.</p>
<p>And there are protests, riots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s locked down as more than 1,000 people rallied against the appearance of a controversial</p>
<p>editor from Breitbart, Milo Yiannopoulos.</p>
<p>We want him deplatformed.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want him to speak at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using free speech as a justification to have these fascists come to Berkeley.</p>
<p>And I thought it was a terrible strategic error.</p>
<p>Overnight mayhem on campus.</p>
<p>The University of California, Berkeley erupting in flames as over 1,000 came out to protest.</p>
<p>My feeling was, you are giving this man way more power than he deserves by behaving in</p>
<p>this way.</p>
<p>It made Milo look sexier and edgier than he deserved to look.</p>
<p>Is there anybody in here who hates me?</p>
<p>Yes, there we go, thank you.</p>
<p>I thought it was a strategically appalling turn.</p>
<p>Get on that platform and eviscerate his ideas.</p>
<p>Get on that platform and expose him for the charlatan that he is.</p>
<p>You push back hard, but you&rsquo;ve given him so much power by refusing to talk.</p>
<p>Milo went from relative obscurity to being a regular on primetime television and political</p>
<p>talk shows in just a few months.</p>
<p>You know, I have marched in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly been part of mass movements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve signed petitions and I&rsquo;ve demonstrated in certain ways.</p>
<p>But when it comes to a speaker like that, I just thought they were undermining their</p>
<p>own ends.</p>
<p>I thought they were serving his purposes because he was able to walk away from that</p>
<p>saying, look, they won&rsquo;t even, they don&rsquo;t dare debate me.</p>
<p>This is how dangerous and edgy I am.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we want to cast the alt-right in that light, but inadvertently, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>Rowling says that she was alarmed watching people who she saw as being on her side of</p>
<p>the political aisle, behaving in a way that she felt broke with her deeply held principles.</p>
<p>Even when the target was someone who she agreed was offensive and immoral and a political</p>
<p>opponent.</p>
<p>And she started to think that maybe this was something she needed to speak up about.</p>
<p>I was becoming unnerved by some of what I was seeing.</p>
<p>I thought the way this activist movement is behaving is troubling me.</p>
<p>But then, she started to see that it wasn&rsquo;t just her political opponents who were being</p>
<p>treated this way.</p>
<p>I was starting to see activists behaving in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.</p>
<p>These are trans activists protesting outside a feminist meeting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shouting TERF.</p>
<p>It stands for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists.</p>
<p>Like, what were they doing?</p>
<p>There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging and kicking on windows.</p>
<p>Very threatening.</p>
<p>They were masked.</p>
<p>Which frankly is never a good look.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a good guy, you&rsquo;re probably not going to be standing there in a black balaclava.</p>
<p>I watched that happening and I was deeply disturbed because now this movement that</p>
<p>I started being interested in, now this is really happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s playing out very fast.</p>
