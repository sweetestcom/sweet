<p>Rain Man, David Saks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And it said.</p>
<p>We open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the queen of Kinwam.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Hey everybody, welcome to episode 55</p>
<p>of the All In Podcast with us again this week.</p>
<p>The dictator himself, Jamal Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>The queen of Kinwam, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>And coming back from Portugal</p>
<p>and the Solana Conference, riding his.</p>
<p>Where heroin and prostitution are legal, David Saks.</p>
<p>We were gonna double click on that</p>
<p>but you jumped the gun here on the docket.</p>
<p>So David, how was the heroin in Portugal?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Great, okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>I was fully drinking the Kool-Aid</p>
<p>at the Solana Conference.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t heroin, it was Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>It was literally Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>How many people were at the Solana Conference in Portugal?</p>
<p>Why is it in Portugal?</p>
<p>What happens at a Solana Crypto Conference?</p>
<p>I think there were thousands of people there</p>
<p>and it was, I mean, easily.</p>
<p>And I mean, it was kind of a madhouse</p>
<p>and people were trying to get in last minute</p>
<p>and nobody could get in</p>
<p>because the conference was like totally sold out.</p>
<p>It was a lot of crypto developers,</p>
<p>a lot of people with projects.</p>
<p>And why Portugal?</p>
<p>I think because there&rsquo;s a lot of conferences</p>
<p>happening in Portugal right now</p>
<p>because they are easier on the COVID restrictions</p>
<p>than a lot of other countries.</p>
<p>So you can actually get in there and host a conference.</p>
<p>What was it, indoors with no masks?</p>
<p>Or masks optional?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if like masks were required or not.</p>
<p>I did see people wearing masks indoors, so.</p>
<p>Were you required to be vaccinated?</p>
<p>Did they do tests on the way in?</p>
<p>I think I did show a vaccine pass</p>
<p>at one point when I checked in.</p>
<p>I just did my booster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do my booster shortly.</p>
<p>It kind of, it was a little, I would say</p>
<p>the same kind of shitty feeling as the second one.</p>
<p>Which kind though?</p>
<p>I just got Pfizer, I mean, the first two were Pfizer,</p>
<p>so I took Pfizer.</p>
<p>She was, the nurse actually gave me a choice.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, you can do whatever you want,</p>
<p>Pfizer, Moderna, or J&amp;J.</p>
<p>I just, I didn&rsquo;t know any better.</p>
<p>I texted my doctor.</p>
<p>So I just took Pfizer.</p>
<p>Although the interesting thing is</p>
<p>Moderna is the only one that&rsquo;s dose regulated</p>
<p>for the third dose.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, they actually give you less specifically,</p>
<p>but Pfizer is the same for all three.</p>
<p>I think we talked about this on the pod.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one theory, which they told you</p>
<p>get whatever one you can get, was the instructions,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more important to just get one</p>
<p>than which one you get.</p>
<p>But they said there&rsquo;s a Swiss cheese theory,</p>
<p>which is if you took two slices of Swiss cheese</p>
<p>from two different bricks of it,</p>
<p>the holes would not be the same,</p>
<p>and therefore you overlap them.</p>
<p>So whichever deficiencies each one had,</p>
<p>maybe the other one doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I should have gotten Moderna is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>That would be, if you believe in the Swiss cheese theory,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Friedberg, you&rsquo;re a science guy.</p>
<p>I should ask Aaron Rogers what he thinks.</p>
<p>I mean, he just straight up lied</p>
<p>about being vaccinated, huh?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And I think the NFL&rsquo;s not doing anything about it, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>Why would you lie about it?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s not, he would have still been allowed to play.</p>
<p>So there was no reason to lie about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not totally up on that story.</p>
<p>The rumor is that Kyrie is gonna be playing basketball soon.</p>
<p>Because New York-</p>
<p>Because Eric Adams is gonna lift the vaccine restrictions.</p>
<p>You will not need to show a vaccine card or wear a mask.</p>
<p>Bro, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna-</p>
<p>Or maybe you&rsquo;ll just get a PCR test every day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna matter</p>
<p>because the Warriors are shooting the lights out</p>
<p>and Klay hasn&rsquo;t even come back yet.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>That Gary Payton, the second kid is-</p>
<p>Did you see Gary Payton Jr., these clips?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s like living above the rim</p>
<p>and just destroying his Wiseman back.</p>
<p>And then Wiggins is playing great basketball.</p>
<p>I mean, the Warriors are gonna win this year.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Steph is otherworldly right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Steph&rsquo;s got something to prove,</p>
<p>even though he doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s playing like he&rsquo;s got something to prove.</p>
<p>Okay, so do we wanna just cover the elephant in the room?</p>
<p>The last episode, I think we should just get out of the way</p>
<p>because it relates to Solana.</p>
<p>There was, we took something out of the last podcast</p>
<p>so people understand we have an agreement</p>
<p>between the four of us.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something that somebody doesn&rsquo;t want on the pod</p>
<p>after we record it, we&rsquo;ll take it out</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t want anybody.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the philosophy,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t said this out loud,</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t want anybody to say something they regret</p>
<p>that could cause damage to other people or to themselves.</p>
<p>So if they wanna take something out that they said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine with all of us.</p>
<p>And basically each of us has veto right on something.</p>
<p>So last week, two people took their veto right on something</p>
<p>and we took something out.</p>
<p>You wanna explain our thinking on that, Sax,</p>
<p>and why we&rsquo;re reversing it?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so a few weeks ago on the pod,</p>
<p>there was an oblique reference</p>
<p>between me and Chamath regarding Solana.</p>
<p>And so some internet theorists claimed</p>
<p>that we were trying to engineer a pump and dump in Solana,</p>
<p>which if you actually listen to what we said,</p>
<p>it certainly is not a pump.</p>
<p>Let me explain what it was.</p>
<p>So Kraft is the beneficiary because we invest,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the first investors in multi-coin.</p>
<p>We were kind of like their seed investor,</p>
<p>investor in there who put in something like 40%</p>
<p>of the money for their special opportunity fund.</p>
<p>They were one of the first investors in Solana.</p>
<p>So we are the beneficiary of about a billion dollars</p>
<p>of Solana, so thank you, multi-coin.</p>
<p>At some point, well,</p>
<p>so they have started doing distributions,</p>
<p>but at the time I texted Chamath,</p>
<p>they hadn&rsquo;t really started doing distributions.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how deep and liquid the market for Solana was.</p>
<p>I just asked Chamath, like I&rsquo;d heard,</p>
<p>that Chamath may have said something</p>
<p>that he was long Solana and wanted to accumulate.</p>
<p>So I sent him a text saying, hey, are you interested?</p>
<p>I thought maybe we could do an OTC transaction</p>
<p>at some point when we get our Solana.</p>
<p>He basically, we had a brief exchange about that.</p>
<p>And then he mentioned on the pod, that was the extent of it.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t know at the time, but learned subsequently</p>
<p>is that the market for Solana is very deep,</p>
<p>about three and a half billion notional</p>
<p>is traded every day.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no need, even if we wanted to fully get out</p>
<p>of our Solana position, which by the way,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even have, multi-coin still has most of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessary to do an OTC transaction.</p>
<p>We could just sell it.</p>
<p>Explain what OTC transaction is.</p>
<p>It just means over the counter.</p>
<p>It just means that instead of going to like an exchange,</p>
<p>you would deal with like a trading desk</p>
<p>or it could just be direct, like for me to Chamath.</p>
<p>So that was basically the exchange.</p>
<p>Chamath and I talked about it for maybe two minutes</p>
<p>and then it came up on the pod for 20 seconds.</p>
<p>So then some internet theorist basically clipped it</p>
<p>and tried to accuse us of organizing a pump and dump.</p>
<p>Well, obviously if you&rsquo;re talking about selling something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a pump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not a dump either.</p>
<p>So anyway, the reason why we said cut it out last week</p>
<p>is because we didn&rsquo;t want to give oxygen</p>
<p>to this stupid like conspiracy theory</p>
<p>that somebody had invented on the internet</p>
<p>with like no basis whatsoever</p>
<p>because you could spend all day</p>
<p>trying to like shoot this stuff down.</p>
<p>But then at the Solana conference,</p>
<p>enough people told me that this was becoming a meme</p>
<p>that I thought was worth addressing.</p>
<p>And look, the way you have to understand with crypto</p>
<p>is that for every cryptocurrency like Solana,</p>
<p>there are haters because they&rsquo;re invested in Ethereum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very tribal.</p>
<p>Or Cardano or whatever.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s talking up their books.</p>
<p>There are pump and dumps.</p>
<p>And there are armies of anonymous Twitter accounts</p>
<p>that will coordinate attacks and or memes, et cetera.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re trying to spread the rumor</p>
<p>that like VCs are big holders in Solana</p>
<p>and are gonna dump it.</p>
<p>The reality is that Multicoin has a large position,</p>
<p>but they have LPs.</p>
<p>They are slowly distributing their positions to LPs.</p>
<p>We will then-</p>
<p>In the forms of the tokens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not selling them and giving you cash.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re giving you the tokens.</p>
<p>You get to decide what you do.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d like to do as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re currently working through those mechanics</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually complicated for a VC firm</p>
<p>to distribute in kind through tokens, but-</p>
<p>If you had to give them to your LPs subsequently-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would like to do.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>People are doing that with Coinbase.</p>
<p>So Coinbase is providing that as a service now,</p>
<p>from what I understand.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So we have to work through with our LPs,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna try to do</p>
<p>is distribute it in kind</p>
<p>so everyone can make their own decision.</p>
<p>I have a couple of things to say.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve only been a buyer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, I haven&rsquo;t sold a single Solana token.</p>
<p>And so we are net buyers and we&rsquo;re buying a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>But I hate acknowledging that.</p>
<p>And this is why my tone was more non-committal</p>
<p>when we did the pod,</p>
<p>is that I really don&rsquo;t like this culture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s emerged via Twitter mostly,</p>
<p>where you all of a sudden have to be this maximalist</p>
<p>that basically falls on their sword and never sells,</p>
<p>in order to be legitimate.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a really dangerous place to be.</p>
<p>So, look, if I take a-</p>
<p>Why is that dangerous?</p>
<p>Well, if I take a much, much bigger step back,</p>
<p>let me put Solana in the context of crypto</p>
<p>and let me put crypto in the context of the markets</p>
<p>and where we are today at the end of the week</p>
<p>after Q3 earnings in November of 2021.</p>
<p>We have the stock market at absolute all time highs.</p>
<p>Ripping.</p>
<p>We have crypto at absolute all time highs.</p>
<p>Ripping.</p>
<p>We have the art markets,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw Phillips and Christie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and Sotheby&rsquo;s this past week,</p>
<p>at absolute all time highs.</p>
<p>Sold another vehicle for 25 million.</p>
<p>We have inflation at a 30-year high.</p>
<p>We have 10-year break-evens at a 25-year high.</p>
<p>We have 1 point some odd trillion dollars</p>
<p>that we just approved last week</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still horse trading on another three,</p>
<p>1.8 trillion dollars of stimulus that we&rsquo;re going to put in.</p>
<p>And so when you, and then you have,</p>
<p>and I think the most important thing,</p>
<p>which is the two most important founders of our generation,</p>
<p>the two smartest people who have really consistently won,</p>
<p>Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos,</p>
<p>have collectively sold more than $11 billion</p>
<p>of their holdings this year alone.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t take all of that and decide for yourself</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right for you and your family,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing yourself a disservice.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important for me to never sort of like,</p>
<p>be forced to tell folks whether I&rsquo;m buying or selling,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m willing to do it in moments</p>
<p>where I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really important to understand the context.</p>
<p>And so I think like these folks that like think derisively</p>
<p>about individuals who are managing risk,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really naive.</p>
<p>And I think it creates a lot of missed opportunity</p>
<p>for them as well.</p>
<p>If the smartest people in the world</p>
<p>are now selling their core holdings</p>
<p>that they told you they would never sell,</p>
<p>and you are not reconsidering your position on things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re either much smarter than them,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re being really, really reckless.</p>
<p>All right, there you have it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we, just so people also know inside baseball,</p>
<p>we have a docket of stories that we talk about</p>
<p>on our group chat that make up the docket for the show,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll bring stuff up.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t bring that up in some way</p>
<p>to cause trouble or anything.</p>
<p>I thought you guys would want to clear the air about it.</p>
<p>And I understand Chamath&rsquo;s position of,</p>
<p>hey, you don&rsquo;t want to give these things oxygen or whatever,</p>
<p>but I think Sachs also-</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know that we needed to clear the air</p>
<p>until I went to the conference</p>
<p>and enough people mentioned it.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s so funny is half the people on Twitter</p>
<p>spend all their time in crypto land saying things like,</p>
<p>never going to make it, have fun staying poor.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re extremely, Jason, as you said, tribal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that they&rsquo;re doing first principles analysis</p>
<p>of these things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re toxic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gotten exceptionally lucky.</p>
<p>Some of them are exceptionally good,</p>
<p>but many people broadly speaking</p>
<p>have gotten exceptionally lucky.</p>
<p>And I think a little bit of it is getting to their head</p>
<p>where they become very virulent against people</p>
<p>that they think whose perspectives may actually be</p>
<p>negatively affecting their position</p>
<p>without actually understanding what David said,</p>
<p>which is these are incredibly deep liquid markets</p>
<p>and one person&rsquo;s opinion can&rsquo;t do much of anything.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, that&rsquo;s a really good point.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d like to give my opinion on Solana,</p>
<p>or just crypto in general.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s like hard about it</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s hard to talk about the benefits</p>
<p>of say the Solana blockchain without being seen</p>
<p>as a pumper of soul or a dumper of ether or whatever,</p>
<p>because all these things are so intrinsically connected.</p>
<p>I mean, I learned a lot of really bullish things</p>
<p>about Solana at this conference.</p>
<p>I mean, the biggest thing is,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s basically a battle</p>
<p>for the hearts and minds of developers going on right now</p>
<p>between Solana and Ethereum.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Solana has raced up</p>
<p>to over 200, I don&rsquo;t know what, like 7,000% increase</p>
<p>or something incredible like that.</p>
<p>The reason is because Solana as a blockchain</p>
<p>gives confirmations back in something like 400 milliseconds,</p>
<p>whereas Ethereum takes minutes</p>
<p>and a transaction that might cost tens of dollars,</p>
<p>10, 20, 30, $50 of gas on Ethereum cost pennies on Solana.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s revenge.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, a lot of developers feel like the tools,</p>
<p>the developer tools that they&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>are easier than building on Solidity.</p>
<p>The thing that Solana gives up,</p>
<p>the trade-off that it makes is decentralization.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s basically that transactions</p>
<p>are processed by 20 validators</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re a top 20 based on holdings of soul.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like this proof of stake model.</p>
<p>So anyway, there&rsquo;s some trade-offs there.</p>
<p>I can tell you that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the view of, you know, our friends at Multicoin.</p>
<p>And, you know, I heard a lot of this views at the conference,</p>
<p>although obviously you have to take it with a grain of salt</p>
<p>because these are the biggest believers,</p>
<p>but their view is that Solana over the next year</p>
<p>will flip Ethereum based on developer activity,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s real companies being created.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time actually before we do anything</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s the only thing we&rsquo;ve been looking at, you know,</p>
<p>and Syndica, Fractal,</p>
<p>a lot of the stuff that we&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>DSO is purely driven by developer interest.</p>
<p>When we see developers in the open source ecosystem,</p>
<p>building things on top of this stuff,</p>
<p>making stuff that&rsquo;s composable and usable by other people</p>
<p>and building infrastructure,</p>
<p>you know, we don&rsquo;t really second guess that</p>
<p>because they are spending the most important currency,</p>
<p>which is not monetary capital, but human capital.</p>
<p>Yeah, their time, their skill.</p>
<p>Their time and their skill and their reputation.</p>
<p>They can apply it to another project, yeah.</p>
<p>And so when enough developers,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve always thought you just follow the developers</p>
<p>and as more and more projects get started,</p>
<p>you just have to unemotionally support that.</p>
<p>I think the writing is on the wall,</p>
<p>which is Bitcoin is gold.</p>
<p>Ethereum looks like it&rsquo;s trending to be silver</p>
<p>and Solana could be the first,</p>
<p>but there will be others that come after it</p>
<p>of real developer ecosystems</p>
<p>that can be built on top of it.</p>
<p>The other thing that I would offer up to people</p>
<p>for them to think about is</p>
<p>before you blindly go and rush into crypto,</p>
<p>one way in which I try to think about these things</p>
<p>is in the following way.</p>
<p>You see these projects get started all the time</p>
<p>and I would view each of these projects</p>
<p>as a mini economy and really try to think</p>
<p>what is the economic value</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening under the hood.</p>
<p>So simple example, Helium is an interesting project</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to build a completely decentralized</p>
<p>5G infrastructure, right?</p>
<p>Render is a really interesting project</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to build a completely decentralized</p>
<p>graphical processing infrastructure, right?</p>
<p>GPUs essentially.</p>
<p>In both of those things,</p>
<p>you can quantifiably economically measure</p>
<p>what the value is that people get, right?</p>
<p>In the case of Render,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically displacing an AWS instance.</p>
<p>And so that has a price and a value.</p>
<p>And so for Render to be valuable,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an economic value that it replaces.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re joining a hotspot that has an economic value</p>
<p>where you hadn&rsquo;t necessarily have to pay</p>
<p>to get internet connectivity,</p>
<p>if you all of a sudden are on the Helium network,</p>
<p>that displaces a measurable economic quantum.</p>
<p>Understanding that is probably</p>
<p>and taking the absolute value of that</p>
<p>is the best way of really understanding</p>
<p>which projects have potential.</p>
<p>So if you take those two ideas and marry them together,</p>
<p>where is their developer interest</p>
<p>and where is their measurable economic activity?</p>
<p>At the intersection of those,</p>
<p>I think are the really compelling projects I can win.</p>
<p>Well, and the thing that complicates all of this</p>
<p>is that the developers are not just picking</p>
<p>based on which language or technology or stack</p>
<p>they think has the most potential.</p>
<p>They also have acquired economic stakes in it.</p>
<p>So a developer who might be objective and say,</p>
<p>hey, this new platform is better than Ethereum,</p>
<p>might be sitting on millions of dollars in Ethereum.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, I want to keep my bet going here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to keep talking my book.</p>
<p>Possibly, but I do think that developers in general</p>
<p>will choose the platform that&rsquo;s easiest</p>
<p>and cheapest and fastest for them to develop on.</p>
<p>Which would mean the list on CoinMarketCap</p>
<p>of market cap ones that has been static</p>
<p>for a decade of crypto almost,</p>
<p>or largely the top 10 doesn&rsquo;t change that much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s XRP, it&rsquo;s Stellar, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Tether.</p>
<p>That could be up for grabs.</p>
<p>That whole thing could change</p>
<p>now that people are actually building projects</p>
<p>and the projects are getting competitive with each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that flippity we&rsquo;re talking about, correct Sax?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that what&rsquo;s tricky here again</p>
<p>is I never want to give anyone investment advice.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just not my job.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s anyone out there listening to the show</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to get like tips or tricks</p>
<p>or whatever for investment,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not really comfortable telling people what to do.</p>
<p>So, you know, everyone just has to understand that.</p>
<p>I do feel like what I saw at this conference</p>
<p>over the past week in terms of developer enthusiasm</p>
<p>and activity was very bullish.</p>
<p>Actually, it was a lot like I went to the Ethereum conference</p>
<p>I think it was back in 2017, several years ago.</p>
<p>And it felt a little bit like that.</p>
<p>Although I would say that this time it felt less academic.</p>
<p>Like several years ago, it felt more like white papers.</p>
<p>Now it actually feels like real projects and businesses</p>
<p>that people are trying to create.</p>
<p>Still infrastructure and less applications</p>
<p>or more applications and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Chamath mentioned a couple of them.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s Helium,</p>
<p>which is creating a decentralized network for Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Render,</p>
<p>which is creating a decentralized network for GPU.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one called HiveMapper, I met the founder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decentralized network for people to map the world.</p>
<p>You can think of, you know,</p>
<p>the concept of a miner that Bitcoin invented.</p>
<p>Think of them more as like a resource provider to a network.</p>
<p>So with Bitcoin, you know, we call them miners,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re the validators of transactions.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to incentivize them</p>
<p>through block rewards,</p>
<p>basically through small bits of Bitcoin that get released</p>
<p>to provide these valuable computing resources</p>
<p>to the network.</p>
<p>And so people are figuring out now</p>
<p>how to create massively decentralized networks</p>
<p>where you have, you know,</p>
<p>thousands or millions of resource providers</p>
<p>provide a little bit of something</p>
<p>to the network for everyone&rsquo;s benefit</p>
<p>in exchange they get some coin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a really interesting model</p>
<p>that couldn&rsquo;t exist before crypto.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>but you know, in order for that to work,</p>
<p>you have to have like very,</p>
<p>you need fast, efficient, scalable blockchains.</p>
<p>And the feeling as, I mean, I&rsquo;ll give credit here</p>
<p>to Tushar, who&rsquo;s one of the GPs at Multicoin.</p>
<p>His view is that this was the iPhone moment for blockchain,</p>
<p>that what Solana has built,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s massively scalable and also very cheap.</p>
<p>I mean, again,</p>
<p>you can run a lot of transactions for pennies.</p>
<p>Now, all of that is obviously very bullish for Solana.</p>
<p>The thing I wrestle with is,</p>
<p>and Chamath kind of alluded to this,</p>
<p>is I think everything&rsquo;s kind of in a bubble right now</p>
<p>because of monetary and fiscal policy.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I guess you could say</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m long Solana versus ETH,</p>
<p>but I do kind of worry that the whole world right now</p>
<p>is very bubbly.</p>
<p>And so as a GP, like, what do you do about that?</p>
<p>I can tell you right now, like this second,</p>
<p>we are sitting on Solana that we have not sold.</p>
<p>So, you know, I am long in that sense.</p>
<p>However, sometime over the next, whatever number of years,</p>
<p>we will distribute out our position of Solana</p>
<p>to LPs.</p>
<p>And then the LPs will make their decisions.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll make their decisions.</p>
<p>Some LPs might specialize in crypto and want to keep it.</p>
<p>Other ones might not want to hold assets</p>
<p>and need that money to fund their endowment</p>
<p>to give scholarships to students</p>
<p>or whatever your LPs particularly do.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, and so I guess to the issue of,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re not giving investment advice here.</p>
<p>We are all capital allocators and startup creators.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about our day-to-day lives here.</p>
<p>Nobody should interpret this as investment advice</p>
<p>and especially not in a world now,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw what happened</p>
<p>with Rivian this week.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we don&rsquo;t talk about a company</p>
<p>with essentially no public sales.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve sold 148 cars to their employees.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth $120 billion.</p>
<p>Any, Freeberg, did you see this IPO, any thoughts on it?</p>
<p>Seems like a high-</p>
<p>Do you have investment advice for the audience</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like to give?</p>
<p>Tell me what Rivian does.</p>
<p>Can you play that video that you found</p>
<p>that you shared with everyone?</p>
<p>You have that video, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, well, we do have it.</p>
<p>I can, we can cue it up.</p>
<p>Did you see this yet, Sax?</p>
<p>Who is this guy?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh, that, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, but just, so I don&rsquo;t want to beat this point</p>
<p>to death, but I just think it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>for the audience that what they should be getting</p>
<p>out of the show, if they&rsquo;re fans,</p>
<p>is maybe like advice on how to think.</p>
<p>Yeah, critical thinking.</p>
<p>Critical thinking and how we think about investments.</p>
<p>First principles.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So look, if you want to invest in crypto,</p>
<p>first of all, like go understand</p>
<p>what all these different projects or blockchains do</p>
<p>and figure out what is the purpose of the token</p>
<p>in that system?</p>
<p>What are the token economics?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the utility?</p>
<p>Yeah, does it even make sense or is it just a scam?</p>
<p>Then if it&rsquo;s something like a blockchain,</p>
<p>go research how many projects have developers on them</p>
<p>and how much code is being checked in.</p>
<p>And maybe open a wallet and buy some NFTs</p>
<p>and buy some ETH and transfer it</p>
<p>and learn just how to set up your internet connection.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>If this was 1995.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And then on top of all that,</p>
<p>you got to consider macro forces because,</p>
<p>I mean, and I think, you know,</p>
<p>my friends at MultiCoin would fully concede this,</p>
<p>that, you know, it could be the case</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s a crypto bust over the next year</p>
<p>and this thing, you know, crypto has gone</p>
<p>through boom and bust cycles for many, many years.</p>
<p>That is the standard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the standard.</p>
<p>So you could have a situation in which, for example,</p>
<p>Solana flips ETH and yet still goes down in value</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an overall bust cycle.</p>
<p>So, you know, you have to consider</p>
<p>the macroeconomic factors as well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of things to consider here.</p>
<p>And then you also have to consider your own risk tolerance</p>
<p>and, you know, what is appropriate for your portfolio.</p>
<p>And it may be different than us.</p>
<p>And when do you need your money?</p>
<p>Are you a 25 year old?</p>
<p>Everything is at all time highs</p>
<p>and the two smartest men in the world are selling.</p>
<p>Not just them, by the way.</p>
<p>Not just them.</p>
<p>There are other guys that are heavily on the other side</p>
<p>waiting for this whole thing to go.</p>
<p>Like Druckenmiller has been very vocal about this.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been the best macro trader in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>And his position is what exactly?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re printing too much money</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>So, you know, look, I mean, generally there is,</p>
<p>I think a good point of view being shared here,</p>
<p>which is, you know, understanding how to think</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re investing in</p>
<p>and what your expectations are</p>
<p>versus relying on someone&rsquo;s advice</p>
<p>or opinion on what to do.</p>
<p>If you have to rely on someone else&rsquo;s advice</p>
<p>or opinion on what to do,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna eventually lose money.</p>
<p>You should not be in that investment category.</p>
<p>You should not be in the market.</p>
<p>Cause guess what?</p>
<p>Anyone that&rsquo;s giving you advice or opinions</p>
<p>is gonna make money if you do what they tell you to do.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>So at some point, they&rsquo;re gonna all make money</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna end up losing money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a better game to play</p>
<p>to learn how to kind of be thoughtful about</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your money going?</p>
<p>What are you investing in?</p>
<p>And it takes a lot of time and a lot of money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sitting here silently</p>
<p>as you guys have been talking deeply</p>
<p>about Solana and Ethereum and Bitcoin</p>
<p>and the crypto markets,</p>
<p>because I realized so much of, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s needed to be successful in entering this market</p>
<p>is a depth of understanding and a depth of knowledge.</p>
<p>My time is highly limited.</p>
<p>I have spent no time understanding crypto markets</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so deep and it&rsquo;s so fluid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing every week.</p>
<p>So if I can&rsquo;t get smart enough to feel confident</p>
<p>about the opinions and decisions</p>
<p>that I would be making as an investor,</p>
<p>I decide not to invest and I stay out.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not an active crypto investor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a specialist and you&rsquo;re on the razor&rsquo;s edge</p>
<p>on synthetic biology and so many other categories.</p>
<p>There are other areas where it&rsquo;s better for me</p>
<p>to spend my time and my energy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve chosen to do that</p>
<p>versus being drawn into what feels like a very exciting</p>
<p>kind of, you know, turbulent time.</p>
<p>There are other areas that I kind of spend my time on</p>
<p>and I just kind of try to recognize</p>
<p>that maybe I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>if I were to try and get involved here.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d rather stay out.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s counsel for anyone.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re gonna make an investment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to feel confident about the knowledge</p>
<p>and the depth needed to kind of be different</p>
<p>than the rest of the market.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll build on your point.</p>
<p>Like when I started doing my SPACs,</p>
<p>I started to write these one-pagers</p>
<p>and those one-pagers were artifacts</p>
<p>for me to hold myself accountable</p>
<p>for how I saw something in a moment in time</p>
<p>and then to be able to see whether it was</p>
<p>tracking to that.</p>
<p>And then also to share it to other people, a starting point,</p>
<p>as David said, a journey where they should then,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re curious, go and do their own work.</p>
<p>It turned out not enough people were doing the work.</p>
<p>So then I had to start adding disclaimers to these things,</p>
<p>saying, hey guys, I&rsquo;m not telling you to buy this.</p>
<p>Please be abundantly clear.</p>
<p>These next SPACs that I will eventually launch,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see an entire like in bread block letters,</p>
<p>like please don&rsquo;t buy this.</p>
<p>Right, because to your point,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say.</p>
<p>People want a lazy, easy way out.</p>
<p>And so I just want to reiterate what all of you guys said.</p>
<p>None of us are dispensing advice.</p>
<p>We are not telling you to do anything.</p>
<p>Please do your own work</p>
<p>and please come to your own conclusion.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not sure,</p>
<p>go and look at your children in the face</p>
<p>or your significant other in the face.</p>
<p>You are responsible to them.</p>
<p>And so do your own work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say one more point on where I sit as an investor.</p>
<p>I choose to only participate in investing</p>
<p>in what I call productive assets.</p>
<p>That is you put some money into something</p>
<p>and whatever that thing is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s generating money in some way</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s trying to generate value</p>
<p>through a set of activities like a business</p>
<p>or owning an apartment building where you&rsquo;re making rent,</p>
<p>you know, anything that,</p>
<p>or, you know, a group of people</p>
<p>that are trying to have some breakthrough</p>
<p>or some discovery.</p>
<p>Those are productive assets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of what&rsquo;s going on now</p>
<p>that is what I would call speculative assets,</p>
<p>which is the only way you make money</p>
<p>is if someone else pays more in the future</p>
<p>versus what you&rsquo;re paying.</p>
<p>And there isn&rsquo;t an underlying productive asset</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re putting money into.</p>
<p>Art-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re describing every ICO or-</p>
<p>Every ICO, every NFT and the art market, right?</p>
<p>These are examples of unproductive assets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re speculative assets in the sense</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re speculating that at some point</p>
<p>the price of them are gonna go up and someone-</p>
<p>Somebody wants that NFT more than you.</p>
<p>Someone down the road will pay more for that asset</p>
<p>than what you paid.</p>
<p>But that underlying asset,</p>
<p>that capital that you just put in</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go in to build something.</p>
<p>It basically-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no revenue generation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no IP.</p>
<p>It went into someone else&rsquo;s pocket</p>
<p>that sold that asset to you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re eventually gonna try and sell it to someone else.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there&rsquo;s a real attraction here</p>
<p>because what we just talked about is really hard to do.</p>
<p>Having fundamental analysis and understanding of businesses</p>
<p>and a fundamental understanding of what&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s not and when to shift and, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>are things different or are they not?</p>
<p>To do that is really hard.</p>
<p>So people end up relying on opinions of others</p>
<p>or they end up running into speculative markets.</p>
<p>And the speculative markets are easy to understand.</p>
<p>Someone just paid more for X than the other person did.</p>
<p>Therefore, there&rsquo;s a trend line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like playing roulette and black keeps coming up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, okay, it&rsquo;s gonna be black again.</p>
<p>It has to be black.</p>
<p>There were seven, correct?</p>
<p>There were seven blacks.</p>
<p>And so I think that that&rsquo;s a really important</p>
<p>kind of takeaway for folks that might be new as investors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all susceptible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all susceptible to this.</p>
<p>Like I was just looking, you know,</p>
<p>at my own performance coming into the end of this year.</p>
<p>And, you know, I did a lot of SPACs this year,</p>
<p>but I also did these pipes,</p>
<p>which are these third party deals.</p>
<p>Private investment in public entities.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Other people&rsquo;s deals that they were bringing to the market</p>
<p>where they said, Chamath, do you want to be a part of it?</p>
<p>And, you know, and I did.</p>
<p>And part of it was I was looking at these things</p>
<p>and, you know, Freeberg doing my work.</p>
<p>But in the end, it turned out I didn&rsquo;t do nearly as much</p>
<p>as I probably should have,</p>
<p>because I ended up sitting on top of other people&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>versus the original or underwriting that I would do</p>
<p>if it was my own deal itself, right?</p>
<p>Anyways, the net of it all, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>that was very inefficient capital deployment.</p>
<p>And as I look at it now, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down, well, I&rsquo;m technically up 19%,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really because of one deal.</p>
<p>If I take that one deal out, which was a total outlier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down 17% on about $200 million of investment.</p>
<p>When you were a fast follower, not the originator,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t your idea.</p>
<p>This is critically important.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to make money,</p>
<p>but you have to specialize</p>
<p>and you have to have first principles and your knowledge.</p>
<p>I trusted other people.</p>
<p>I did the same thing that I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>to other people not to do.</p>
<p>Do not just copy other people.</p>
<p>You have to do your own principle work.</p>
<p>And even when you do your own principle work,</p>
<p>it may not be enough.</p>
<p>And you have to be willing to basically</p>
<p>see the forest from the trees and walk away.</p>
<p>And so all these pipes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the midst of sort of cleaning up and selling down.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been just a kind of a disaster for me.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Hold on, I want to build on this for a second,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s critically important</p>
<p>what you said as well, Friedberg.</p>
<p>You have to be comfortable</p>
<p>with the investments you&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>I look at these companies</p>
<p>and I look at the underlying customer, the product,</p>
<p>you know, and what kind of revenue it&rsquo;s going to generate.</p>
<p>And people thought I was dunking on Rivian yesterday.</p>
<p>And I said, listen, you know, when Tesla went public,</p>
<p>people forget their valuation was 1.5 billion.</p>
<p>1.7.</p>
<p>1.7.</p>
<p>Okay, so 1.7 billion when they went public.</p>
<p>Now they already had thousands of roadsters</p>
<p>and they had already had the-</p>
<p>No, they had 93 million of revenue in year one.</p>
<p>So this was dramatically different than what Rivian had.</p>
<p>Rivian is being valued at, you know, whatever that is,</p>
<p>120 billion, I think yesterday.</p>
<p>Rivian has 17 billion in cash.</p>
<p>Somebody asked me at the poker game last night</p>
<p>what I value Rivian at.</p>
<p>I said, 17 plus three,</p>
<p>17 million in cash plus 3 billion,</p>
<p>double roughly what Tesla&rsquo;s was,</p>
<p>the market&rsquo;s hotter right now, whatever.</p>
<p>But I put them at 20 billion</p>
<p>and people were giving a hard time about it.</p>
<p>I said, I think that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>the realistic valuation for this company.</p>
<p>And we are in a very dangerous moment in time right now</p>
<p>where I think people are,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s meme stocks or crypto or NFTs,</p>
<p>suspending disbelief, in some cases SPACs,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not all created equal.</p>
<p>And certainly in private companies, we&rsquo;re seeing this,</p>
<p>where people are giving people an amount of credit,</p>
<p>which makes no logical sense</p>
<p>and is getting further and further disconnected</p>
<p>from reality.</p>
<p>So as an investor, you have a choice.</p>
<p>Either you take, you have your fundamentals,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not going to change my fundamentals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to focus on the fundamentals</p>
<p>that got me where I am.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to be involved</p>
<p>in $100 billion market cap company</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t launched a product yet,</p>
<p>let alone $120 billion one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stay focused on startups.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re saying is also important</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re highlighting how you value that company.</p>
<p>You individually said,</p>
<p>I think that company&rsquo;s worth some multiple</p>
<p>of how many cars have been sold in the past.</p>
<p>Elon sold thousands of cars.</p>
<p>He was worth 1.7 billion.</p>
<p>These guys have sold.</p>
<p>And other people are coming in and looking at this company</p>
<p>and saying they&rsquo;ve built facilities,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve built assembly lines,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got pre-orders and bookings</p>
<p>for lots and lots of cars in the future.</p>
<p>And clearly they&rsquo;ve gone in and some people have gone in</p>
<p>and seen these plants and seen these cars actually working.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really important to take note</p>
<p>that your point of view is one point of view</p>
<p>in a very diverse market with many points of view.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s going to come into this market.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why unless you individually as an investor</p>
<p>have a strong point of view</p>
<p>and can show that you can apply your unique insights</p>
<p>to consistently beat the market making decisions,</p>
<p>investment decisions like that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eventually going to lose</p>
<p>because those other points of view</p>
<p>will be a bigger view of the truth and you&rsquo;ll lose money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, by the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why picking stocks is ultimately a loser&rsquo;s game</p>
<p>unless you have some unique ability and insight.</p>
<p>For most people historically and in an upmarket,</p>
<p>everyone looks like a genius.</p>
<p>You need to have an edge, right?</p>
<p>You need to have an edge.</p>
<p>And the public markets are hard to say that</p>
<p>because people think it means insider trading.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some unique competency</p>
<p>that you need to bring to the table.</p>
<p>I mean, if we double click on what you just said</p>
<p>as the things that would be reasons to embed on Rivian,</p>
<p>number one, they have 48,000 orders of pickup trucks</p>
<p>against the F-150, which is now electric from Ford</p>
<p>and a million Tesla Cybertrucks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re arguing this, right?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just making a point</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have someone on the panel right now,</p>
<p>but someone else could come in</p>
<p>and argue the other side.</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead, Chamath.</p>
<p>And I would just say, this is the part of the conversation,</p>
<p>to be honest, Jason, to give you feedback I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>because Rivian, just in defense of Rivian for a second,</p>
<p>what I have heard is that it&rsquo;s a well-engineered car</p>
<p>or truck rather.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done a very smart path to market,</p>
<p>which is essentially to build these delivery trucks</p>
<p>for Amazon that allowed them to even frankly,</p>
<p>be default alive.</p>
<p>To use the Paul Graham term, instead of default dead.</p>
<p>I think the point that&rsquo;s more important here</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t affect you.</p>
<p>So let Rivian do well, you know?</p>
<p>And this is part of the cycle-</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re saying we shouldn&rsquo;t have an opinion publicly?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying this is the part of the cycle</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>where people legitimately have these zero-sum points of view</p>
<p>about companies.</p>
<p>And this is where I think Friberg is more right</p>
<p>than anybody else, which is the market is the sum</p>
<p>of all these collective points of view.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Longs and shorts.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fine to have one.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little superficial, your point of view,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not really-</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>Sitting on top of a model or anything else.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the same kind of superficiality</p>
<p>that the Tesla Q guys had about Tesla for many years as well.</p>
<p>It takes a long time.</p>
<p>As somebody that does this every day,</p>
<p>and I just want to point this out,</p>
<p>it takes an enormous amount of time</p>
<p>and enormous amount of work to be 55% right.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;ve invested in 350 companies.</p>
<p>I meet with 2,000 companies a year.</p>
<p>No, in the public markets, Jason,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different in the public markets.</p>
<p>Listen, and my companies are going public now,</p>
<p>so I take exception to what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I know a fraud when I see it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen them before.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a really big statement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Rubin&rsquo;s at fraud level yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a fraud.</p>
<p>No, but the distance between the valuation and reality</p>
<p>is in the 50 to 100 billion dollar range,</p>
<p>and that is very dangerous.</p>
<p>I know, but that&rsquo;s not in control of Rubin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not in their control.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s in a bunch</p>
<p>of external market participants&rsquo; control,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t pin that on them.</p>
<p>My point is-</p>
<p>What I would pin it on is,</p>
<p>the market right now seems dysfunctional</p>
<p>and is not properly measuring things.</p>
<p>I know, but throwing shade,</p>
<p>then you should throw shade at T. Rowe, Fidelity,</p>
<p>all these people that are bidding up your companies,</p>
<p>by the way, because they are the ones</p>
<p>that are taking Rubin to 120 billion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Rubin&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>And Jason, what&rsquo;s really going on in the market-</p>
<p>I thought that was the thing.</p>
<p>It was public speculators.</p>
<p>No, what&rsquo;s really going on, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t sell $16 billion in an IPO to speculators.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s at a much lower price than the IPO price.</p>
<p>These are institutionally placed trade orders,</p>
<p>but regardless, the market is clearly right now,</p>
<p>in productive assets, businesses,</p>
<p>the market is looking at a time horizon</p>
<p>that it has never looked at before,</p>
<p>which is making bets that are at 10, 15,</p>
<p>20 years in the future,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because of the condition</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re in right now</p>
<p>from a monetary policy point of view.</p>
<p>Interest rates are so low,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nowhere to get yield in other assets.</p>
<p>So you have to look further and further out to find value.</p>
<p>Okay, I accept that, I accept that.</p>
<p>So the market is betting, is making 10-year bets,</p>
<p>which is like a VC type bet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than a 10-year bet, but okay, yeah.</p>
<p>And Jason, sorry, can I just finish my last point?</p>
<p>Because before you interrupt me,</p>
<p>my issue, Jason, is I think you are</p>
<p>an exceptional angel investor,</p>
<p>but just the same way you derided</p>
<p>a bunch of late-stage guys,</p>
<p>remember last night at poker,</p>
<p>when we were talking about late-stage folks</p>
<p>entering into the angel market and the Series A,</p>
<p>you were extremely dismissive</p>
<p>because you know what the job is to be done,</p>
<p>to do that job well,</p>
<p>and they have a different skillset.</p>
<p>Similarly, what I would just offer for you to think about is</p>
<p>the people that really underwrite public market stocks well</p>
<p>do things and have a skillset that is extremely specific,</p>
<p>and it is well-trained as well.</p>
<p>And I think that-</p>
<p>Okay, no, I accept that people were good at that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll defend me.</p>
<p>Let me jump into the Jake Alston facts.</p>
<p>But go ahead, since you want to defend me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, the people are in shock right now,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna let you speak.</p>
<p>Way to get yourself back in the game.</p>
<p>The sky is purple, the sky is purple,</p>
<p>the moon is set.</p>
<p>Breaking news.</p>
<p>Hell is freezing over right now.</p>
<p>Hell is freezing over.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s where I think Jake Alston,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about this Rivian company,</p>
<p>but where I think Jake Alston&rsquo;s right is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen over and over again</p>
<p>that when a company gets,</p>
<p>when a startup gets a billion dollar plus valuation</p>
<p>without a product, invariably,</p>
<p>it ends up somewhere between a disappointment</p>
<p>and an outright fraud.</p>
<p>Jason&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>It was Theranos, or Magic Leap, or Quibi, or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re all frauds.</p>
<p>I mean, I think just Theranos was, but-</p>
<p>Trainwrecks, frauds.</p>
<p>Trainwrecks, frauds, whatever.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s reasonable for any,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say seed or early venture investor</p>
<p>to develop the heuristic</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not gonna invest in anything</p>
<p>with a billion dollar, with basically a unicorn valuation</p>
<p>without seeing the product first.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve learned, we&rsquo;ve got our hands burnt</p>
<p>so many times from these overhyped companies.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where I agree.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t see and use the product, I&rsquo;m not investing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll invest in a seed stage,</p>
<p>but I will not invest in a unicorn stage, no way.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>when a company is going public like that,</p>
<p>there is demonstrable proof of concept there, okay?</p>
<p>The only market in which that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>is in biotechnology.</p>
<p>Well, I would say for Fisker and Nikola,</p>
<p>two related companies,</p>
<p>those ones seem very, very shaky.</p>
<p>You can debate about the scalability of these things,</p>
<p>and you can debate that people didn&rsquo;t do the diligence,</p>
<p>but they had to at least put a proof of concept out there</p>
<p>for you to judge.</p>
<p>If people don&rsquo;t do the work, I agree with you.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re rolling a truck down a hill, sure.</p>
<p>Outright fraud.</p>
<p>No, but my point is if you were there and you did your work,</p>
<p>you would have seen what you needed to see.</p>
<p>What I have heard from people who were investors</p>
<p>in both Lucid and Rivian</p>
<p>is that they have sat in the cars, they&rsquo;ve driven the cars,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve spent time with them, they&rsquo;ve seen the factories,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very much real.</p>
<p>Now what they&rsquo;re debating is ramp and velocity and scale.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t have a position in either.</p>
<p>I have the bigger macro point of view,</p>
<p>which is important to me,</p>
<p>which is just because these things are in the public markets</p>
<p>I think people think it&rsquo;s easy to judge.</p>
<p>And I think actually modeling them and making good decisions</p>
<p>is just as hard as it is for private companies.</p>
<p>Okay, we need to roll this clip</p>
<p>because there is somebody who is giving exceptional advice</p>
<p>on CNBC.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s roll the clip.</p>
<p>Yeah, so well, Upstart&rsquo;s up about 25% just in four days</p>
<p>since we bought it.</p>
<p>We bought it on about four days ago.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually made a nice little move</p>
<p>in the short term, probably a little extended right now,</p>
<p>but longer term, that&rsquo;s a good looking name.</p>
<p>Very powerful, very strong earnings.</p>
<p>These stocks are-</p>
<p>What do they do? I don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>What do they do?</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>What does Upstart do?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>What kind of company is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not, you&rsquo;re breaking up.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I guess we&rsquo;ve got an audio problem, Mark,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Oh my fucking God.</p>
<p>Brutal.</p>
<p>Who is this guy?</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>J. Cal, is that like your uncle or something?</p>
<p>Who is that guy?</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, just to the point-</p>
<p>Do you want to go on CNBC?</p>
<p>Well, you know, the guy&rsquo;s been on many times.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t this prove what we were saying,</p>
<p>which is that you&rsquo;ve got to do your own principal work here?</p>
<p>That is why we wanted to play it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a talking head who&rsquo;s probably getting paid</p>
<p>for selling some books and giving advice,</p>
<p>who knows nothing about what he&rsquo;s telling you.</p>
<p>You can join his membership club for 1,000 a month.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s publishing lots of papers</p>
<p>that show that he&rsquo;s a highly successful,</p>
<p>profitable investor, and look how smart he is.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t even know the company he just promoted on CNBC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>On a mechanical basis here, Chamath,</p>
<p>you and I have been on CNBC many times.</p>
<p>In that moment, what is going on?</p>
<p>What do you think is going on in the host&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>and the producer who has to dump this call?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re watching this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>I just, the breakdown when he says, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>What do they do?</p>
<p>I think the point&rsquo;s been made.</p>
<p>I think the point&rsquo;s been made.</p>
<p>Oh my Lord, everybody should do their own work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do your work.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>
<p>Zach, you look like you want to say something.</p>
<p>I mean, it just shows the agenda.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I mean, there is a massive agenda</p>
<p>in corporate journalism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an agenda by the people on these shows</p>
<p>to promote positions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an agenda by the reporters themselves</p>
<p>and on and on and on it goes.</p>
<p>So to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>if you just take face value and you don&rsquo;t do your own work,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re buying into someone else&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
<p>Trust yourself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>One thing that we are trying to all understand is inflation.</p>
<p>The CPI has gone up 6.2% in October,</p>
<p>highest jump in 31 years since 1990,</p>
<p>according to the Wall Street Journal,</p>
<p>fifth largest straight month.</p>
<p>Fifth straight month of inflation above 5%.</p>
<p>Somebody tweeted out, we&rsquo;ll pull it up here,</p>
<p>Denver Bitcoin put out a year over year commodity chart.</p>
<p>We can throw up on the screen.</p>
<p>And then I think Friedberg, you shared in the chat</p>
<p>the average weekly retail prices around fertilizer.</p>
<p>What are our thoughts on the nature of inflation</p>
<p>and how that affects our investment?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s persistent.</p>
<p>And the reason I think it&rsquo;s persistent is that</p>
<p>all of these things are intertwined.</p>
<p>And so, Gina, if you want to just bear with me for a second,</p>
<p>like when this, let&rsquo;s just go to the entry level</p>
<p>economic job, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a barista at Starbucks or you work at McDonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re making 17 to $20 an hour.</p>
<p>What that does is it shifts labor.</p>
<p>And eventually there are other people</p>
<p>that are entering the workforce or may shift jobs.</p>
<p>And essentially it just causes this leaky bucket effect</p>
<p>where everybody else has to then accommodate itself.</p>
<p>So you have a guy like, you have a company like Amazon,</p>
<p>which is now gonna pay 25 or $30 to keep folks, right?</p>
<p>Because otherwise they may say,</p>
<p>oh, if I make 15 or $16 an hour,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather work at McDonald&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s simpler.</p>
<p>And free college.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not backbreaking work, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So then they start to increase the amount that they pay.</p>
<p>They increase their benefits and the like.</p>
<p>I saw this thing this week.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a crazy thing that&rsquo;s happening though,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s now pulling people</p>
<p>from non-traditional job classes into those jobs.</p>
<p>There are teachers that are leaving teaching</p>
<p>to go work at an Amazon warehouse.</p>
<p>There are firefighters that are quitting</p>
<p>being a firefighter to go work at an Amazon warehouse</p>
<p>because you make the same or more,</p>
<p>plus you have all of these other benefits</p>
<p>and the job is structurally a lot easier.</p>
<p>And so people are making different optimizations.</p>
<p>And to that point, I think we talked about this</p>
<p>and Nick, you can put it in the group chat.</p>
<p>In Reddit, as an example, there is more engagement</p>
<p>in the subreddit around having a simple work life</p>
<p>than there is now in Wall Street bets, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been a structural cultural change</p>
<p>where people need to get paid more</p>
<p>to do the same amount of work.</p>
<p>And then at the same time,</p>
<p>you have all of the supply side getting more expensive.</p>
<p>Fertilizer makes corn more expensive.</p>
<p>Lumber makes house prices more expensive.</p>
<p>Chip prices makes the iPhone and cars more expensive</p>
<p>or completely backlogged.</p>
<p>You know, yesterday at poker,</p>
<p>Sonny was showing us he bought a Tesla</p>
<p>and the delivery period is October of 2022.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s freaking crazy.</p>
<p>So I think that this is the beginning of a persistence.</p>
<p>I think those are all like really valid points.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m seeing now is I think we&rsquo;ve moved</p>
<p>into what I&rsquo;ll call a contagion phase of inflation,</p>
<p>which is people are hearing about inflation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seeing it in some places.</p>
<p>My gas went up a little bit.</p>
<p>My milk went up a little bit, whatever.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying, well,</p>
<p>I guess if everybody&rsquo;s raising prices,</p>
<p>I need to raise the prices as well</p>
<p>of whatever I provide in the world</p>
<p>so I can just keep up with everybody else.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not looking at their inputs necessarily</p>
<p>and saying, I need to charge more</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s the best business decision.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just saying everything&rsquo;s going up around me.</p>
<p>And so they raise prices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve literally had this happen three or four times</p>
<p>and I went to buy a car and they wanted 15K over sticker</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t buy it based on principle,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sitting here going like, maybe I&rsquo;m an idiot.</p>
<p>Maybe I should just pay the 15K over sticker.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, Saxon inflation?</p>
<p>And the contagion, if you have any thoughts.</p>
<p>My thoughts are I told you guys</p>
<p>like six months ago about this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can we just replay what I said on episode 32?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got his researchers in the background giving.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written down what you said on per episode basis?</p>
<p>No, this guy&rsquo;s in the fucking debate club,</p>
<p>Stanford debate club over here.</p>
<p>Some of us, when we make predictions, take them seriously.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, was that a dig at professor ice cold takes?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you guys a link to a prediction that was made.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s, I mean, I just want to replay the 20 seconds</p>
<p>I said about this back in May.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>The two Davids dueling again, just like in the group chat.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not dueling.</p>
<p>All right, here&rsquo;s Friedberg, January 1st, 2021.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t think inflation is already here,</p>
<p>you missed what happened to the stock market.</p>
<p>Companies aren&rsquo;t performing better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just inflating everything.</p>
<p>Financial assets first.</p>
<p>Everything else will follow.</p>
<p>That was a good one.</p>
<p>So just make your point.</p>
<p>Just make your point.</p>
<p>Just add the clip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder</p>
<p>if Biden&rsquo;s going to be a Jimmy Carter here</p>
<p>because frankly, all he had to do</p>
<p>was leave things well enough alone.</p>
<p>COVID was winding down.</p>
<p>We had a vaccine.</p>
<p>All they had to do was distribute it</p>
<p>to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>End COVID, let the recovery take shape.</p>
<p>And instead, they push this insane $10 trillion agenda.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to backfire massively.</p>
<p>Look, if the economy turns,</p>
<p>we were set for a post-COVID boom.</p>
<p>And right now that is all at risk</p>
<p>because Jamal, like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re keeping the economy closed</p>
<p>or parts of it way too long.</p>
<p>They then overcompensate for that</p>
<p>by printing a ton of money.</p>
<p>And then they overcompensate for that</p>
<p>by raising taxes too much.</p>
<p>Just to build on that.</p>
<p>So that second step of their overcompensating</p>
<p>their inability to open with money is so true</p>
<p>because then what happens is your labor force</p>
<p>stays impaired because people make enough money</p>
<p>by not working.</p>
<p>It was true when I said in May,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even more true now.</p>
<p>He said it was, there was inflation.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s inflation.</p>
<p>So now, great, good job.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s prediction was proven true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I made one in January that said the same thing.</p>
<p>Now look, you can do three things to,</p>
<p>you can do three things to curb inflation,</p>
<p>raise rates, right?</p>
<p>When you raise interest rates, you slow spending.</p>
<p>Prices come down, inflation slows.</p>
<p>But the issue when you raise rates</p>
<p>is obviously you see things like job loss</p>
<p>and economic growth declines,</p>
<p>and it can very quickly spiral the other way.</p>
<p>This is the big challenge of Fed tapering.</p>
<p>The other option is we&rsquo;ve seen a significant attempt</p>
<p>at lately is to raise revenue, right?</p>
<p>So increase tax rates,</p>
<p>tax a broader swath of people at a higher rate</p>
<p>or a broader swath of business at a higher rate.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very likely that tax revenue</p>
<p>could kind of present itself again as a driver</p>
<p>if inflation continues to spiral up.</p>
<p>And the third, which is the least likely is cut spending,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>The federal government spending the way it does right now</p>
<p>makes a very inefficient way of kind of putting capital</p>
<p>into the system and inflating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen historically that anything</p>
<p>the federal government spends money on</p>
<p>like healthcare and education,</p>
<p>the costs very quickly spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Super inefficient.</p>
<p>Why not just give that money to the free market</p>
<p>to make decisions on how to spend it?</p>
<p>It would be more efficient, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the market would effectively find balance</p>
<p>where buyers and sellers are equivalent</p>
<p>as opposed to having the federal government</p>
<p>driving the price of everything up.</p>
<p>The fourth option that people don&rsquo;t talk about,</p>
<p>which I think may end up becoming an important option,</p>
<p>not kind of a bleak option,</p>
<p>but more kind of backdrop is to start a war.</p>
<p>And when you start a war-</p>
<p>Wag the dog, wag the dog.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you start a war,</p>
<p>you stimulate the economy</p>
<p>without needing to pump additional capital in</p>
<p>so you can increase growth</p>
<p>and avoid the risk of stagflation.</p>
<p>And you can source resources</p>
<p>that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be kind of flowing into trade</p>
<p>or basically in a land grab type situation.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that policymakers would say,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s go start a war to decrease inflation.</p>
<p>Taiwan.</p>
<p>But the premise that conflict can improve the economy</p>
<p>is a important backdrop</p>
<p>that starts to play into policy decisions</p>
<p>that might get made</p>
<p>over the next couple of months and quarters.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>Whether or not the posturing is one of partnership</p>
<p>and reducing the tension with foreign nations</p>
<p>or one of increasing the tension,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more likely that we would want to increase the tension</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in an inflationary environment.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a conspiracy there.</p>
<p>So what do you think, Sax?</p>
<p>Okay, we got to go back to first principles on this thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to start a war to tame inflation, okay?</p>
<p>But let me just explain what inflation is,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not sure people fully understand</p>
<p>how this works.</p>
<p>Inflation is very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much money chasing too few goods, okay?</p>
<p>And we have both sides of the equation going on right now.</p>
<p>On the supply side, on the good side, we&rsquo;ve got shortages.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the ports backed up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got paying people not to work.</p>
<p>We still have the 2 trillion of COVID relief</p>
<p>passed earlier this year,</p>
<p>which was responding to a problem</p>
<p>that was largely winding down.</p>
<p>So we have these labor shortages.</p>
<p>People dropping out of the workforce in record numbers.</p>
<p>The number that just came out showed</p>
<p>we had more people quitting their jobs than ever before.</p>
<p>So we have a shortage in terms of the production</p>
<p>of goods and services that people want.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>we have this monetary and fiscal expansion</p>
<p>coming out of Washington.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got, and again,</p>
<p>they did the 1.9 trillion of COVID relief.</p>
<p>They did 1.2 trillion of infrastructure.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s still talking about another 2 trillion</p>
<p>of social welfare.</p>
<p>You have the Fed still printing money with QE.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this massive expansion</p>
<p>in the amount of money.</p>
<p>So look, too much money chasing too few goods</p>
<p>creates this problem.</p>
<p>And it was very predictable.</p>
<p>And so what I said back in May,</p>
<p>this is what I was warning about,</p>
<p>and it goes back to the Druckenmiller clip</p>
<p>that we were talking about all the way back in May.</p>
<p>He said the same thing,</p>
<p>that we had a reckless fiscal and monetary</p>
<p>expansionary policy coming out of Washington</p>
<p>at a time we didn&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>Because if you looked at retail spending back in May,</p>
<p>it was back to above trend.</p>
<p>So, you know, in other words,</p>
<p>like there was no demand problem.</p>
<p>The economy was back.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve just been pumping</p>
<p>and pumping out of Washington.</p>
<p>We made a, we had a, we had good intent.</p>
<p>We wanted to make people not suffer.</p>
<p>We wanted to get the economy on tap.</p>
<p>We may have just made a bigger bet than we needed to.</p>
<p>We overdid it.</p>
<p>We overdid it, clearly.</p>
<p>But look, who wants to be the politician, quite frankly?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not going to get you re-elected.</p>
<p>Who ends the eviction moratorium, right?</p>
<p>The gravy train, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, nobody wants to be the politician who says,</p>
<p>okay, now you suddenly have to pay your rent.</p>
<p>But obviously people have to pay their rent.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re taking away your bonus unemployment.</p>
<p>People have to go back to work at some point</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s 10 million jobs open.</p>
<p>Just as a, I&rsquo;ve been watching the Taiwan situation</p>
<p>like a hawk.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this this week</p>
<p>to go off on another tangent,</p>
<p>but the US is testing Israeli&rsquo;s Iron Dome in Guam</p>
<p>as a defense against Chinese cruise missiles.</p>
<p>Obviously for possible deployment in Taiwan.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>Ennis Cantor in the NBA,</p>
<p>but he has been going on CNN and stuff like that now</p>
<p>talking about China.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing.</p>
<p>I predict escalating global conflict.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be my prediction to mark the Q4.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I think actually that&rsquo;s a pretty valid prediction,</p>
<p>but I just think it&rsquo;s a little bit separate than inflation.</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s not an explicit decision,</p>
<p>but I do think that in the backdrop</p>
<p>of an inflationary environment</p>
<p>where you have something</p>
<p>that can temper the condition at home,</p>
<p>that at the same time, you know, might sell politically.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t need,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna solve anything politically.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, World War II, you know,</p>
<p>famously got us out of the Great Depression</p>
<p>because that did stimulate demand.</p>
<p>But in the situation we&rsquo;re in today,</p>
<p>we have too much demand.</p>
<p>We have retail is trending way above curve.</p>
<p>What we have is a supply shortage</p>
<p>and devoting resources,</p>
<p>taking them away from the productive economy</p>
<p>to go to war would only exacerbate the problem,</p>
<p>make it even worse.</p>
<p>What we need right now actually is for Washington</p>
<p>to back off, to stop pumping demand with this,</p>
<p>with, you know, now they&rsquo;re still talking</p>
<p>about this $2 trillion.</p>
<p>Sell the money printing machine.</p>
<p>Sell the money printing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we need.</p>
<p>We need them to get out of the way.</p>
<p>And to stop these disincentives for production and work.</p>
<p>So you have, I mean,</p>
<p>Manchin was exactly right about this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you remember when Manchin,</p>
<p>when he was resisting this $2 trillion social welfare bill?</p>
<p>I mean, the things he said are already coming true.</p>
<p>I mean, he said this months ago.</p>
<p>He said that we should take a strategic pause</p>
<p>because he said, this is a quote,</p>
<p>by all accounts, the threat posed by record inflation</p>
<p>to the American people is not transitory</p>
<p>and is instead getting worse.</p>
<p>From the grocery store to the gas pump,</p>
<p>Americans know that the inflation tax is real</p>
<p>and DC can no longer ignore the economic pain</p>
<p>Americans feel every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he was saying this past summer,</p>
<p>several months ago.</p>
<p>And they rolled right over him.</p>
<p>The psychology of this could be self-fulfilling as well</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s going to happen is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have everybody raise prices</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s now become an escalation.</p>
<p>You know, your hairdresser, your, you know,</p>
<p>whatever, you know, services you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>whatever product you&rsquo;re buying,</p>
<p>whatever restaurant you&rsquo;re going to is going to put $2</p>
<p>on every appetizer and five bucks on every entree.</p>
<p>Everything is just going to keep going up.</p>
<p>And then what happens is people who are in the middle class</p>
<p>or, you know, who are consumers of products in a large way</p>
<p>will say, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put off buying a car.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re going to be driving all this supply up.</p>
<p>And then people are going to say, you know what?</p>
<p>Fuck it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just drive this one for two more years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to cause stagnation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s called stagnation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we had in the 1970s.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called an inflationary spiral,</p>
<p>which is the future expectations of increasing prices</p>
<p>means that people start increasing them now.</p>
<p>And that feeds on itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we had in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>And the thing that broke that was Paul Volcker,</p>
<p>jacking up interest rates.</p>
<p>It was very painful.</p>
<p>It caused a very severe recession in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>But then the economy came roaring out of that by 83.</p>
<p>It got Reagan elected in 84.</p>
<p>And you had 30 straight years of declining interest rates.</p>
<p>And that led to a stock market boom.</p>
<p>So the problem we have now, okay,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem we have is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be no Paul Volcker.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford to jack up rates</p>
<p>because the federal government&rsquo;s debt</p>
<p>is so much bigger than it used to be.</p>
<p>And we are not on a fixed rate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on a variable rate.</p>
<p>All of the debt we take.</p>
<p>The average maturity of government debt</p>
<p>right now is five years.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that means the whole debt</p>
<p>rolls over within five years.</p>
<p>So if they jack up interest rates,</p>
<p>we have almost 30 trillion of US federal debt right now.</p>
<p>So every 1% that they increase interest rates,</p>
<p>that means another 300 billion a year</p>
<p>of debt service payments.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be enormous pressure</p>
<p>on the Fed not to raise rates.</p>
<p>You already are hearing Biden</p>
<p>rattling the saber saying that Powell</p>
<p>may not be his choice for a second term.</p>
<p>By the way, Powell is very dovish.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically saying we can&rsquo;t raise rates right now</p>
<p>because of this and that.</p>
<p>So, and the Biden administration,</p>
<p>nobody in Washington ever wants rates to go up, right?</p>
<p>They want to keep these low rates forever.</p>
<p>This is the problem is, look,</p>
<p>at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the inflation picture</p>
<p>is going to look like next year.</p>
<p>But what concerns me is we don&rsquo;t have effective tools</p>
<p>to fight it anymore</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve given up our ability to raise rates</p>
<p>because it would increase the cost of the debt so much.</p>
<p>And I mean, so just one article</p>
<p>just to share with you guys is this, again,</p>
<p>one of my favorite sources of economic information</p>
<p>is the Fred blog, which is from the St. Louis Fed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We wrote a blog talking about two tails of federal debt.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And the article is about,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s so much disagreement</p>
<p>on whether the federal government debt is too high.</p>
<p>So the first chart shows debt to GDP.</p>
<p>This was always the way of looking at government debt</p>
<p>was simply looking at the ratio of debt to GDP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now something like 125% in peacetime.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve had a higher peacetime ratio</p>
<p>that would tell you things were out of control.</p>
<p>But for the last decade,</p>
<p>while this has been going on,</p>
<p>you had this whole school of thought,</p>
<p>the MMT, modern monetary theory,</p>
<p>all these economists and experts</p>
<p>and politicians and the media were eager to buy in</p>
<p>because they want to spend the money.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And what they said is, no, it&rsquo;s not debt to GDP.</p>
<p>You should look at debt service to GDP.</p>
<p>This is the second chart on that blog.</p>
<p>And so debt service to GDP was staying constant</p>
<p>or even going down as the debt to GDP was going up.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because interest rates were so low.</p>
<p>The problem is what was so foolish</p>
<p>about this point of view is,</p>
<p>it is assumed that interest rates were going to last forever.</p>
<p>Well, if that was your point of view,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you do what Trump actually suggested</p>
<p>several years ago when he suggested</p>
<p>having a hundred year T-bills?</p>
<p>They should have locked in much, much longer duration,</p>
<p>maturities on the federal debt.</p>
<p>And instead, and Yellen rejected this, okay?</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve got a five-year average duration,</p>
<p>which means that if interest rates go back up,</p>
<p>the debt service cost is going to explode.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In 1980, we changed the goalposts for CPI.</p>
<p>So even as a measurement to know what we look at,</p>
<p>and I think Jack Dorsey tweeted this out.</p>
<p>So Nick, you may be able to find this tweet,</p>
<p>but we changed the measurement of how CPI measures.</p>
<p>And so if you go back to the original measurement,</p>
<p>it looks like inflation and CPI is much more pernicious</p>
<p>than we would otherwise think it</p>
<p>if we just look at the new CPI</p>
<p>that we started to look at as of 1980.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another sort of like point.</p>
<p>We did the same thing with unemployment.</p>
<p>I just go back to what I said early on.</p>
<p>We took out people who had given up looking for jobs.</p>
<p>The two smartest people that we both know are net sellers.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re selling some, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re not selling everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying the two smartest people we know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to get financial advice here,</p>
<p>but should everybody be moving to cash?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Where do you put your money?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, I&rsquo;m totally confused.</p>
<p>This is, I think, the admission.</p>
<p>Just buy productive assets,</p>
<p>great businesses that have durability,</p>
<p>and let them ride for 20 years.</p>
<p>I like your answer.</p>
<p>The fact is we&rsquo;re all confounded</p>
<p>as to what to do at this moment in time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all trying to figure this out,</p>
<p>and we do this for a living.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re trading the market</p>
<p>like everyone else all the time.</p>
<p>Like, you know, why trade the market</p>
<p>when you can just buy great businesses,</p>
<p>own stakes in them, and let it rest?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just talking holistically</p>
<p>where to put money.</p>
<p>I mean, my practical issue</p>
<p>is that I don&rsquo;t have infinite money.</p>
<p>And so in order to put my money into productive assets,</p>
<p>I have to sell other productive assets.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;ve got other productive assets,</p>
<p>leave them in.</p>
<p>Why sell?</p>
<p>Well, then it&rsquo;s like, then I&rsquo;m basically,</p>
<p>you know, doubling down on a worldview</p>
<p>that may be old and dated, right?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m long a bunch of software companies,</p>
<p>and I really want to do something</p>
<p>in climate science or biotech,</p>
<p>what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try and time the market.</p>
<p>Shift your assets, right?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;m not trying to time the market.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, if my worldview shifts</p>
<p>to really want to double down on climate science</p>
<p>or alternative finance or biotech,</p>
<p>I have to raise capital to do that.</p>
<p>You have to raise capital, is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Right, but for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not raising it from other people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m raising it for myself.</p>
<p>So I have to sell things I already own.</p>
<p>It seems like, to me,</p>
<p>the best place to be right now</p>
<p>is in the company formation space,</p>
<p>because when you create a company,</p>
<p>like Friedberg does every three months,</p>
<p>there is so much value being created</p>
<p>at that moment in time,</p>
<p>and so much further capital getting poured into it,</p>
<p>that if you are the originator of the company,</p>
<p>and you get some big slice of the cap table</p>
<p>for doing that, which is completely valid,</p>
<p>you originated the company,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Munique or Call-In or whatever it is,</p>
<p>man, that is a great moment of wealth creation.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re the person putting the money in</p>
<p>at the billion dollar valuation</p>
<p>before the company, whatever, Call-In,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Clubhouse,</p>
<p>went from 100 million to 4 billion with no revenue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening in the world,</p>
<p>but pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Do you want to go on to Xi Jinping</p>
<p>and his, he&rsquo;s gonna be speaking with Biden on Monday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>He got it done before his video, his Zoom with Biden.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, so they&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now the supreme leader.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping hasn&rsquo;t left China in 18 months.</p>
<p>Explain what this means, Chamath, from the story.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the basic takeaway</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;ve been working inside the body politic</p>
<p>inside of China to basically reflect Xi</p>
<p>on the same level as Mao.</p>
<p>And effectively what this means is that it allows him</p>
<p>to remain the leader of China indefinitely.</p>
<p>And so there is no transition of power.</p>
<p>Typically what had happened was</p>
<p>there were these 10-year windows</p>
<p>and you go Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, 10-year cycles</p>
<p>and then they pass the baton.</p>
<p>But it now looks like we&rsquo;ll be living with Xi Jinping</p>
<p>until he joins the afterworld.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s ruler for life of China, basically, crazy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>What an incredible feat of political maneuvering</p>
<p>without judging it, just to say</p>
<p>how what a complicated Byzantine political infrastructure</p>
<p>he must&rsquo;ve had to navigate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how he played the three-dimensional chess</p>
<p>with all these people,</p>
<p>the slow systematic dismantling of the old guard,</p>
<p>placing all of his people in</p>
<p>then slowly moving towards this kind of recognition for him.</p>
<p>He sounded a bit admiring, Shamath.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, the dictator got his name for a reason.</p>
<p>Somewhere Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are like,</p>
<p>what did we do wrong?</p>
<p>We were so close January 6th.</p>
<p>We almost, if Pence would have just played ball,</p>
<p>Sachs, you&rsquo;d still be in power, huh?</p>
<p>Your guys dropped the ball.</p>
<p>And we wouldn&rsquo;t have inflationary.</p>
<p>Just think, if Trump was leader for life.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jason, given how accurate my predictions have been,</p>
<p>you should have a little bit more respect</p>
<p>for my political positions.</p>
<p>What do you guys think happens now</p>
<p>that Xi basically is ruler for life?</p>
<p>I think the Chinese term for it is historic figure,</p>
<p>which is the parlance of saying, you&rsquo;re basically.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a made man, basically.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get whacked.</p>
<p>Nobody can touch you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good for life, the end.</p>
<p>Nobody can question you.</p>
<p>Can you imagine Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping,</p>
<p>and now Xi Jinping?</p>
<p>Incredible, he is at that level.</p>
<p>Well, it means if you start a war</p>
<p>and a serious military conflict</p>
<p>that nobody can question you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the supreme leader.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like Putin and MBS.</p>
<p>MBS can go kill a journalist</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got nobody to answer to.</p>
<p>It means he has nobody to answer to.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong initiated the revolution.</p>
<p>And Deng Xiaoping was really the architect</p>
<p>of free markets that has made China</p>
<p>the economic powerhouse that it is today.</p>
<p>Their internal reflection of Xi Jinping</p>
<p>is on the same scale of that.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, I can&rsquo;t claim to know enough Chinese.</p>
<p>But what is his vision for the future of China?</p>
<p>Yeah, what is the accomplishment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna really put him in that league?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have to say it&rsquo;s the annexation of Taiwan.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing that he must be looking to do</p>
<p>before his time runs out.</p>
<p>To reunify China.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that could put him in that league.</p>
<p>And so that is the tripwire that, to Freeberg&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>that could lead to a conflict.</p>
<p>I think they, you know, I hate to say that Freeberg is wrong</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think in this case I can.</p>
<p>I do think that there is some left tail risk</p>
<p>for like a crazy wag the dog moment in Taiwan.</p>
<p>It would be really scary, really scary.</p>
<p>Right now, if I was looking at the sizes of the names,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>Japan actually has a very large defensive Navy.</p>
<p>The UK and the United States obviously have very large ones.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s is large, but not on a tonnage basis.</p>
<p>They have a lot of ships.</p>
<p>But together, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw</p>
<p>the military exercises going on,</p>
<p>but New Zealand, Australia, the United States,</p>
<p>UK and Japan were basically, I think South Korea</p>
<p>were basically driving their ships</p>
<p>around the South China Sea.</p>
<p>This is gonna be, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you know, I did a really interesting interview</p>
<p>with the historian and commentator, Neil Ferguson,</p>
<p>who is also a pretty avid China watcher.</p>
<p>And I did an interview with him actually on my app.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want me to say the name.</p>
<p>The app shall not be named.</p>
<p>But anyway, so he had a really great line,</p>
<p>which is he said that the issue of Taiwan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically like the issue of Cuba and Berlin</p>
<p>and the Persian Gulf all rolled into one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Cuba and the Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s right there off the shore of China.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Berlin, you know,</p>
<p>because that was basically the dividing line</p>
<p>between freedom and totalitarianism,</p>
<p>you know, where the Berlin Wall got built.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the Persian Gulf</p>
<p>because the new oil are these semiconductors,</p>
<p>the chips that are fabbed in Taiwan at TSMC.</p>
<p>And so all the resources that we&rsquo;re dependent on</p>
<p>for the new economy are all right there.</p>
<p>Super smart framing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought it was a clever line.</p>
<p>The thing we have to remember about Xi</p>
<p>is that his father was a commander for Mao</p>
<p>and was in a vice premier.</p>
<p>And so, you know, his historical,</p>
<p>he is the original princeling, right?</p>
<p>Remember, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this context of these Chinese princelings,</p>
<p>but he is one of these originalists.</p>
<p>And so his motivation will be, it seems at least,</p>
<p>to bring China back into that spectrum of power,</p>
<p>which is really about a consolidated country</p>
<p>and a single nation state.</p>
<p>And that has to include Taiwan.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t not.</p>
<p>So to your point, David,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost more motivation for him to go off</p>
<p>on some crazy adventure and try to reclaim it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to look at the tonnage of ships</p>
<p>and the number of ships.</p>
<p>The United States has over 6,000 tons of ships,</p>
<p>949 according to globalsecurity.org.</p>
<p>China has only 2,000 tons and 1,000 ships.</p>
<p>They have a lot of smaller ships.</p>
<p>And then Russia, UK, India, Japan, France,</p>
<p>Indonesia, Turkey, Germany, Italy.</p>
<p>These are warships, Jason, or?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is their Navy warships.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re fighting.</p>
<p>But Japan has a very large one.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of this</p>
<p>because I thought they were not doing military buildup,</p>
<p>but they have what&rsquo;s called a defensive Navy,</p>
<p>which can do offensive stuff.</p>
<p>So this is, I think this is really problematic for China.</p>
<p>How many of these ships are smaller than Sax&rsquo;s yacht</p>
<p>that he rented this summer?</p>
<p>Yeah, Sax&rsquo;s tonnage would kind of put the United States</p>
<p>over the top, I think, in this conflict.</p>
<p>The gross tonnage of Sax&rsquo;s yacht this summer.</p>
<p>Bezos is gonna be donating his new yacht to the-</p>
<p>No, for sure, it&rsquo;s bigger than Indonesia.</p>
<p>I see Indonesia on this list.</p>
<p>Turkey, I mean, how big could their yachts be?</p>
<p>In my defense, it was a starter yacht.</p>
<p>It was a starter, right?</p>
<p>In my indefensible stuff.</p>
<p>Next one will be bigger.</p>
<p>Yeah, Solana&rsquo;s gonna make sure of that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you can buy yachts with Solana.</p>
<p>All right, I think we covered enough.</p>
<p>GE and Toshiba can&rsquo;t run their businesses,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re each separating into three separate companies.</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, actually.</p>
<p>And Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should talk about it.</p>
<p>All right, so on Tuesday, GE announced</p>
<p>they were splitting into three separate companies,</p>
<p>Aviation, Healthcare, and Energy.</p>
<p>Toshiba reported a similar plan.</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson today?</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson was today.</p>
<p>This is in direct conflict with the consolidation</p>
<p>and the creation of conglomerates and-</p>
<p>But not conglomerates, I think this is an important point,</p>
<p>Jake, you know, in the 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>it was cool to create conglomerates,</p>
<p>meaning you would kind of stick businesses together</p>
<p>that were- RJR, yeah.</p>
<p>Somewhat disparate because you could</p>
<p>financially engineer a way to do it</p>
<p>that would juice shareholder returns, right?</p>
<p>You could borrow money, add lots of scale,</p>
<p>the cost of debt goes down,</p>
<p>you could increase your debt load, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the challenge is when you&rsquo;re scaling a business,</p>
<p>you either need to grow your revenue organically</p>
<p>or you need to acquire.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re acquiring,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re either acquiring horizontally</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re acquiring vertically,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re kind of integrating your supply chain</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re integrating,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re adding ancillary businesses</p>
<p>that you can cross sell.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re either reducing your costs</p>
<p>or increasing your cross-selling ability.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some inherent synergy in the acquisition.</p>
<p>The problem with conglomerates</p>
<p>is there is very little synergy,</p>
<p>meaning like when you acquire a new business,</p>
<p>like an aviation business,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t create synergy for your healthcare business.</p>
<p>And, you know, there was always a rationalization</p>
<p>that these managers of these big conglomerates had,</p>
<p>which was like, oh, well, we could do this</p>
<p>and we could do that.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, it was financial engineering</p>
<p>where they simply kind of used debt</p>
<p>to reduce, you know, the cost of capital</p>
<p>and increase the shareholder returns.</p>
<p>And now everyone&rsquo;s kind of waking up to the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually decreasing value</p>
<p>because an investor that wants to own an aviation company</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t also want to own a healthcare company.</p>
<p>So the investor doesn&rsquo;t buy those shares.</p>
<p>And the investor that wants to own the healthcare company</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to own the aviation company</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t buy those shares.</p>
<p>So the way to increase shareholder value</p>
<p>is to actually split those businesses up.</p>
<p>And then the investors</p>
<p>that want to own the aviation business</p>
<p>will pay more and the investors</p>
<p>that want to own the healthcare business will pay more.</p>
<p>And the overall value of those two businesses goes up</p>
<p>by having them be separate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the market&rsquo;s kind of waking up to.</p>
<p>And this is kind of a trend</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been going on for years now.</p>
<p>You know, going back to kind of 2013, 14,</p>
<p>where the market started to kind of rationalize</p>
<p>some of these silly conglomerate business ideas</p>
<p>and break them apart into more kind of, you know,</p>
<p>targeted businesses that can actually spin out</p>
<p>or yeah, or break off.</p>
<p>Breakups, yeah.</p>
<p>That can basically attract shareholders</p>
<p>to bid on each one of those businesses individually</p>
<p>and drive value up.</p>
<p>You know, one business I was close to</p>
<p>that I saw this with was Dow DuPont,</p>
<p>where they, you know, Dow merged with DuPont</p>
<p>and then they split into several businesses</p>
<p>that each were focused on a particular vertical</p>
<p>and it made a lot of sense to drive value</p>
<p>for the overall shareholders.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, you know,</p>
<p>these conglomerates are about</p>
<p>kind of driving economic outcomes.</p>
<p>And the only folks that you see doing this well</p>
<p>are folks like Warren Buffett,</p>
<p>where the job is really about capital allocation,</p>
<p>where, you know, you can allocate capital</p>
<p>to the best business</p>
<p>and that business on its own will grow organically</p>
<p>versus taking a bunch of crappy low growth,</p>
<p>no growth businesses,</p>
<p>levering them up to kind of juice the returns on each other.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing this slow unwinding happening.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;ll continue to,</p>
<p>and you could probably go</p>
<p>and pick a bunch of these conglomerates</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see the activist shareholders doing this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll buy a bunch of shares,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll instigate and say,</p>
<p>hey, you guys should break up.</p>
<p>The share price will go up by 20, 30%.</p>
<p>So if you want a stock tip of the day,</p>
<p>you know, go find a set of conglomerates</p>
<p>that are gonna get attacked and broken up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting Chamath and, you know,</p>
<p>with public markets, Dell is spinning out VMware</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna create a massive amount of cash</p>
<p>and shareholder value.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing a huge dividend.</p>
<p>So I guess my question to you Chamath is,</p>
<p>when do we start to see this hit,</p>
<p>not from a point of weakness,</p>
<p>but from companies that are strong and see this as,</p>
<p>hey, this is a way to just unlock shareholder value.</p>
<p>Will we see an Amazon spin out AWS,</p>
<p>a YouTube or an Instagram</p>
<p>come out of their parent companies?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very rare that these things happen</p>
<p>on the offensive foot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s typically a defensive maneuver</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driven by really poor returns</p>
<p>over long periods of time,</p>
<p>or activist investors who wanna push for a value unlock.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yeah, like eBay, PayPal.</p>
<p>Totally, I was about to bring that up.</p>
<p>I mean, do you remember how hard that eBay,</p>
<p>I remember like John Donahoe was the CEO.</p>
<p>He like fought that so hard.</p>
<p>I remember getting a phone call from him</p>
<p>asking if I would support them.</p>
<p>He had rounded up Reid Hoffman</p>
<p>and other people support eBay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I can&rsquo;t support.</p>
<p>No, wait, wait, wait, no.</p>
<p>Do you remember this?</p>
<p>We were in Vegas and Donahoe called</p>
<p>and we were working on a plan</p>
<p>and then you went and walked Donahoe through the plan.</p>
<p>Do you remember this thing?</p>
<p>We were-</p>
<p>No, what happened?</p>
<p>We were in Vegas.</p>
<p>You were gonna try to do a hostile spin out of PayPal.</p>
<p>No, Donahoe either called you or called me</p>
<p>and I said, you should talk to Sachs.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And we sketched out a plan for what PayPal should do.</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, I do remember that.</p>
<p>And like on Saturday afternoon,</p>
<p>we sketched out this plan.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I told John, no, I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t support you</p>
<p>because I believe it should be spun out.</p>
<p>And so the only two people from the original PayPal team</p>
<p>who said that publicly were me and Elon.</p>
<p>And we said that if you could get PayPal out from under,</p>
<p>this sort of eBay bureaucracy,</p>
<p>it could be $100 billion plus company.</p>
<p>The bar for acquisitions is extremely high.</p>
<p>Like I think the last really two acquisitions</p>
<p>that were really done well was Sachs acquisition</p>
<p>of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p>
<p>But since then, the bar is extremely high</p>
<p>for these conglomerates.</p>
<p>So as an example, PayPal was rumored to be buying Pinterest</p>
<p>and there was such an incredible shareholder revolt</p>
<p>that they had to put out a press release saying,</p>
<p>we have absolutely no interest in acquiring Pinterest.</p>
<p>But all that did was just accelerate the bleeding</p>
<p>because then people were saying, wait a minute,</p>
<p>how strategically lost must you be</p>
<p>that you would want to buy Pinterest?</p>
<p>And so then as a result,</p>
<p>the PayPal stock price has gotten absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was over a $300 billion company</p>
<p>and it lost the entire value of Pinterest basically.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the big issue that I think we have</p>
<p>in American economics and company building.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through 20 or 30 years</p>
<p>of really under investing in R&amp;D</p>
<p>at the sake of share buybacks,</p>
<p>at the sake of market consolidation.</p>
<p>Dividends.</p>
<p>Private equity, driven take privates.</p>
<p>And so all of this capital misallocation</p>
<p>has really put us on the wrong foot.</p>
<p>And the pandemic basically showed</p>
<p>that we were really ill positioned.</p>
<p>So a lot of these conglomerates,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense today because we&rsquo;ve proven</p>
<p>that the compensation schemes for CEOs,</p>
<p>the incentives for executive management</p>
<p>are way too perverted.</p>
<p>And they just create horrible outcomes.</p>
<p>A different example I saw in the last,</p>
<p>I think 15 or 20 years, IBM&rsquo;s market cap</p>
<p>has gone down to 113 billion.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they&rsquo;ve bought back</p>
<p>$132 billion of stock.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Could you imagine the kind of R&amp;D</p>
<p>that IBM could have affected with that 132 billion</p>
<p>and where they could be?</p>
<p>So we have-</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not good capital allocators.</p>
<p>Well, we have horrible capital misallocation.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Well, look at Apple.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they know how to spend the money on R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re not good at it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not good at it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re better off taking those massive-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re better off taking those massive R&amp;D budgets</p>
<p>and putting it into M&amp;A budgets.</p>
<p>Not for like a $50 billion Pinterest acquisition</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, has no synergies,</p>
<p>but on smaller acquisitions of teams</p>
<p>that have built really interesting technology.</p>
<p>I mean, look, IBM could have bought</p>
<p>a lot of different things with $130 billion.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to know how to innovate or operate.</p>
<p>Those guys don&rsquo;t seem to know how to do anything.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So like-</p>
<p>My point is now we&rsquo;re in this cycle</p>
<p>where these conglomerates will get ripped apart</p>
<p>so that a brighter, fresher,</p>
<p>and probably younger group of executive management</p>
<p>can take a different spin on these companies</p>
<p>and actually do some.</p>
<p>So for example, the J&amp;J spin out is really exciting</p>
<p>because you take med devices and pharma</p>
<p>and you separate it from a really struggling,</p>
<p>complicated consumer goods package business.</p>
<p>You know, the shampoo, the Q-tips, the Listerine.</p>
<p>Get all that off balance sheet.</p>
<p>Now you can actually make drugs and med devices,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a really interesting business</p>
<p>that the right CEO can really do</p>
<p>a lot of interesting things with.</p>
<p>I heard an interview with the CEO of GE,</p>
<p>I think, Culp, who was putting forward this plan.</p>
<p>The line that I remember that kind of resonated with me,</p>
<p>he said,</p>
<p>the benefits of focus are immediate.</p>
<p>The benefits of synergy are hypothetical.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really the key point here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to fuel</p>
<p>all this sort of deconglomeration</p>
<p>is that the benefits of focus to a company are so huge</p>
<p>that, you know, but the reason why it doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>is because of this instinct</p>
<p>that all these managers have for empire building, right?</p>
<p>So when times are good,</p>
<p>they can keep building their empires</p>
<p>and then something bad ass to happen</p>
<p>to force them to focus.</p>
<p>And by the way, the motivation, they&rsquo;re not owners.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re typically not founders.</p>
<p>And so what you end up seeing</p>
<p>is their comp goes up linearly with market cap.</p>
<p>So the bigger the business, the more money.</p>
<p>Right, and this is just to close the thought out</p>
<p>on that whole eBay PayPal thing.</p>
<p>I mean, it was so obvious</p>
<p>that eBay should spin out PayPal,</p>
<p>but the management resisted it</p>
<p>and it took an activist shareholder.</p>
<p>I think Icon came in there.</p>
<p>It was Icon, yeah.</p>
<p>It was Icon who came in there.</p>
<p>Yeah, when Carl Icon is in the lobby, you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>Well, but Icon shouldn&rsquo;t have to come in there.</p>
<p>The reason why there&rsquo;s opportunities for Icon</p>
<p>is the managers want to do the right thing.</p>
<p>He unlocked a quarter trillion dollars of value.</p>
<p>He was incredible.</p>
<p>No, I mean, he spun that out for 40 or 50 billion.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s worth five times that amount.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quarter trillion dollars.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>And just to put this all in perspective,</p>
<p>the stock buybacks that are going on right now,</p>
<p>Apple did almost $20 billion less quarter.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done 77 billion last year.</p>
<p>And you want to talk about the impact</p>
<p>of tax policy on innovation.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve got on one hand here,</p>
<p>Apple is looking at,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m going to have to pay all these taxes.</p>
<p>I might as well just increase the amount</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buying back and be neutral.</p>
<p>Why would I want to show any kind of a profit here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just buy back as many shares as possible.</p>
<p>The company will eventually be private.</p>
<p>I mean, this is,</p>
<p>you got to be really careful with how you do this</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no incentive for people now</p>
<p>to put money into R and D or other stuff.</p>
<p>So just buy back the stock</p>
<p>might be the most efficient thing to do, correct?</p>
<p>In terms of like the share.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how to spend the money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the dumbest thing to do.</p>
<p>It basically shows you&rsquo;re an idiot.</p>
<p>Well, it shows you got nothing better</p>
<p>to spend the money on.</p>
<p>So maybe buying back the stock</p>
<p>is better than throwing it away.</p>
<p>But yeah, it means you&rsquo;re out of ideas.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;re out of ideas.</p>
<p>Or a combination of,</p>
<p>my God, this core business is throwing off so much money</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t come up with enough ideas at that time.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also part of it.</p>
<p>No, it just means you&rsquo;re not ambitious enough.</p>
<p>I mean, what would you spend 20 billion on?</p>
<p>I mean, Zuck is having a hard time spending 10 billion</p>
<p>on creating the metaverse a year.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about 80 billion a year.</p>
<p>What would you put that towards?</p>
<p>What should Apple put it towards?</p>
<p>No, Apple could even more aggressively double down</p>
<p>to enter the car market.</p>
<p>They could have done it much sooner than they have.</p>
<p>They could spend 20 a year on that, sure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>You know, easily.</p>
<p>They could actually enter, I don&rsquo;t know, power.</p>
<p>They could.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but they&rsquo;re, you know, Apple,</p>
<p>their culture is to have very few products as a company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always very proud of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Steve Jobs focused thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s worked pretty well for them.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re second guessing it.</p>
<p>The thing that I hear-</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like buybacks</p>
<p>because I think it comes at the sake of R&amp;D</p>
<p>for most companies.</p>
<p>I think obviously- It&rsquo;s not an easy choice</p>
<p>of crazy shareholder values.</p>
<p>No, the big tech companies are different,</p>
<p>but everybody else, what you see is R&amp;D</p>
<p>is like one or 2% of their, you know, it&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>Look, Apple could definitely be more aggressive,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t judge the Tim Cook era</p>
<p>until we see what happens with glasses</p>
<p>because this is the product that I hear is coming</p>
<p>is going to be their, you know, their AR glasses,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to be a new computing platform</p>
<p>that they open up to developers.</p>
<p>And I guess Cook&rsquo;s been there for, what, a decade?</p>
<p>But I think he doesn&rsquo;t want to retire</p>
<p>until this comes out and he can see</p>
<p>this is going to be his signature product, I think.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you, just the other thought</p>
<p>that just went through my head</p>
<p>as I saw this news about GE,</p>
<p>it really was kind of the end of an era.</p>
<p>You got to remember that back in the 80s, 90s,</p>
<p>I think even as late as 2000,</p>
<p>GE was the number one company in America by market cap.</p>
<p>It was the top of the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>It later subsequently got kicked out of the Dow Jones.</p>
<p>But the thing that went through my head is,</p>
<p>you know, when I was a kid growing up,</p>
<p>the only two business names that I even knew</p>
<p>were Jack Welch and then Lee Iacocca.</p>
<p>You know, that was it.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>They had their posters on their wall.</p>
<p>Do you remember that?</p>
<p>GE and Chrysler.</p>
<p>Farrah Fawcett in between the two of them.</p>
<p>It was big Jack Welch and Iacocca.</p>
<p>And now you don&rsquo;t even know the name of the GE guy.</p>
<p>I mean, like I know it because I watched some interview</p>
<p>and I saw him up there, but I mean,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t think of a business leader today</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not in tech and really a tech founder</p>
<p>or somebody who&rsquo;s handed the ball by the tech founder.</p>
<p>So we know Tim Cook because Steve Jobs handed him the ball,</p>
<p>but otherwise it&rsquo;s all tech, all tech founders.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear about any of these old,</p>
<p>like Dow Jones type companies anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the business environment,</p>
<p>the economy has changed so much since the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all totally dominated by tech now.</p>
<p>But tax, I would argue that the disruptive business</p>
<p>and the disruptive business leader are always the icons.</p>
<p>Back in the day, the chemical companies were the icons</p>
<p>and everyone knew the chemical companies</p>
<p>and the guys running them.</p>
<p>Then it was the industrial companies,</p>
<p>then it was kind of the financial,</p>
<p>then it were these guys in the 80s and 90s</p>
<p>that did all the LBOs.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Walsh and Iacocca weren&rsquo;t founders.</p>
<p>But they were in different ways.</p>
<p>Tell me the top two companies on R&amp;D spending.</p>
<p>Top two companies without looking on R&amp;D spending.</p>
<p>In the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, global.</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>Number one, number two.</p>
<p>Give me number one, number two.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say Microsoft is up there.</p>
<p>No, it depends on classification,</p>
<p>but I would say Saudi Aramco.</p>
<p>Freebird, what do you got?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would probably put Exxon up there.</p>
<p>You guys need to think about who has been</p>
<p>some of the most innovative leaders.</p>
<p>Amazon, 42 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>No, but Jason, that&rsquo;s an accounting thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re saying in the world, Saudi Aramco,</p>
<p>their exploration, their E&amp;P budget</p>
<p>is probably $200 billion a year.</p>
<p>Okay, I guess maybe because that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>is that a corporate entity technically</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be on the list?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a public company.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it could be.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s got to be spending 25 billion a year.</p>
<p>Alphabet is second with 27 billion.</p>
<p>Oh, off by two.</p>
<p>Huawei is third, 22.</p>
<p>Microsoft is fourth, 19.</p>
<p>Apple is fifth, 18.</p>
<p>So tech companies, you&rsquo;re saying tech companies.</p>
<p>No, this is all companies.</p>
<p>Samsung, Facebook.</p>
<p>Some of this is just accounting categorization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accounting categorization too.</p>
<p>Because the engineering budget</p>
<p>is basically what goes into R&amp;D.</p>
<p>So the more engineers you have on staff,</p>
<p>the bigger your R&amp;D budget.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re producing anything, by the way.</p>
<p>Bigger industrial companies,</p>
<p>traditional companies that list things as R&amp;D.</p>
<p>You know, most of those dollars flow out</p>
<p>to third party companies like enterprise software companies,</p>
<p>services businesses.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t end up, it gets accounted for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quote unquote R&amp;D because they get to capitalize it.</p>
<p>But that spend is typically</p>
<p>not paying in-house salaries to engineers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the distinction between true tech companies</p>
<p>and other companies that are quote unquote</p>
<p>going through a digital transformation</p>
<p>or have a quote unquote R&amp;D budget.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re outsourcing R&amp;D</p>
<p>and typically paying three times as much</p>
<p>and typically getting one 10th in the return.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s maybe a good heuristic</p>
<p>for how you might kind of want to look at</p>
<p>what differentiates a true tech company.</p>
<p>Depending on accounting,</p>
<p>Saudi Aramco spends 37 and a half billion to 50 billion,</p>
<p>depending on how you&rsquo;re accounting.</p>
<p>All right, so that puts them at,</p>
<p>probably tied with Amazon for all intents and purposes.</p>
<p>That just means I was right, Jason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I care about.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m wondering,</p>
<p>the reason I think that they might not be listed</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s a really good insight.</p>
<p>Yeah, Cal was reading a BuzzFeed article and he had-</p>
<p>No, it was Barron&rsquo;s, it was Barron&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But anyway, putting it aside,</p>
<p>I think the issue might be</p>
<p>that they are recently public, right?</p>
<p>So maybe they&rsquo;ve only been filing public</p>
<p>for two years or something.</p>
<p>All right, I think that&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everybody doing otherwise?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s personal life?</p>
<p>Are people losing their mind?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s plans for the end of COVID?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go have beer and pizza on the beach.</p>
<p>Nicely done.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m ready to get out of here.</p>
<p>Nice, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m exhausted.</p>
<p>Are you guys exhausted?</p>
<p>This has been a fucking crazy run.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what day it is anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to wind the year down.</p>
<p>I am so exhausted.</p>
<p>I mean, this has been the craziest pace</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever experienced in my life.</p>
<p>The number of deals going on, the amount of inbound-</p>
<p>Oh my God, I tell you at that conference,</p>
<p>every single-</p>
<p>So I have all these founders come up to me</p>
<p>and pitch me what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and a couple of them are like,</p>
<p>that sounds really interesting.</p>
<p>Can we participate in that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, no, the rounds are subscribed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why&rsquo;d you come up to me and pitch me this then?</p>
<p>How dare you?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Rule number one.</p>
<p>I tweeted a new terms of service.</p>
<p>This is only if I&rsquo;m at a conference, okay?</p>
<p>If you set up an appointment in my office, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like an opt-in.</p>
<p>But like, if you come up to me</p>
<p>to pitch me your idea at a conference,</p>
<p>then, and I say, okay, I want to invest,</p>
<p>like give me an allocation.</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t come to me and pitch me</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not gonna give me an allocation.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like being like, oh my God,</p>
<p>I know the best restaurant in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s open tonight.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got the greatest steak.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;ll go.</p>
<p>No reservations.</p>
<p>Guys, tell Sax about the white truffles from yesterday.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>We had dinner at Chamath&rsquo;s house last night.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>He got these white truffles from Alba.</p>
<p>Best meal I&rsquo;ve had in a year or two.</p>
<p>I mean, it was really incredible.</p>
<p>I really appreciated it.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>And 2000, like it was 1996, white burgundy, Leroy.</p>
<p>The white burgundy 2009.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a wine drinker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that your guy,</p>
<p>your chef beat Sax&rsquo;s from two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Sax&rsquo;s, wasn&rsquo;t Sax&rsquo;s chef, your old chef, Chamath?</p>
<p>I think one of his chefs.</p>
<p>I think he lives in a stratosphere of Bern.</p>
<p>He lives in a stratosphere of Bern.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just at a different, he&rsquo;s next level.</p>
<p>Chamath, are you eating my sloppy seconds?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on over there?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I think.</p>
<p>I think I gotta beat that one out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that term means</p>
<p>when you think it means anymore, Sax.</p>
<p>But by the way, there was a dinner conversation</p>
<p>last night, Sax, to your point.</p>
<p>Chamath, it&rsquo;s up to you to decide</p>
<p>if you want to disclose the dinner conversation, guess.</p>
<p>But this guy said that there was a guy</p>
<p>that applied to Y Combinator</p>
<p>that had $750 million in crypto.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s like applying to Y Combinator with his 750K.</p>
<p>For 150K to give up some percent of his company.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, all these stories of these guys</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, I will pre-fund my own Series A</p>
<p>with $15 million to create this business</p>
<p>inside of the YC machine.</p>
<p>That was incredible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such an incredible, like inexplicable,</p>
<p>undescribed, I think in the mainstream media</p>
<p>story of crypto wealth creation that&rsquo;s been going on.</p>
<p>And these crypto 100 millionaires, billionaires</p>
<p>are emerging and doing their own kind of innovation</p>
<p>completely under the radar right now.</p>
<p>The smartest people that we know are selling right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think they changed their conversions</p>
<p>for the YC safe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now getting preferred shares</p>
<p>they used to do common.</p>
<p>And they now, I think it happens post-conversion.</p>
<p>So they want their 7% fixed, you know,</p>
<p>after your next round of funding is my understanding.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s, but yeah,</p>
<p>so they got a more aggressive, but.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, what&rsquo;s happening is like</p>
<p>the accelerators have to move earlier back to incubators.</p>
<p>So the idea of somebody, you know,</p>
<p>grand or some of the other companies we funded</p>
<p>coming to the accelerator with 20,000</p>
<p>or 50,000 in revenue, in some cases,</p>
<p>they may be able to raise money without,</p>
<p>and certainly the crypto companies</p>
<p>are raising $25 million.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re outpacing regular companies,</p>
<p>regular startups, non-crypto startups.</p>
<p>And they raise it in 10 seconds from a bunch of ETH</p>
<p>for buying tokens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve created a whole shadow economy</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have to play by any of the rules.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you really need venture anymore?</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Well, if you want to obey the law, I guess you do.</p>
<p>But in a lot of these cases, like.</p>
<p>I did this, I did this to understand.</p>
<p>This whole new economy</p>
<p>could emerge completely offline, right?</p>
<p>Completely off the, the current.</p>
<p>I mean, the SEC and Gensler</p>
<p>do want to get this thing tightened up.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want people doing this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised.</p>
<p>20, I think it was 2015, I presented Amazon at Irisone.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I did</p>
<p>was we calculated what Bezos'</p>
<p>investment track record was, right?</p>
<p>Because he basically took all his free cash flow</p>
<p>and reinvested it in the business.</p>
<p>And you could measure</p>
<p>what his return on invested capital was.</p>
<p>And it was like 42%.</p>
<p>And on a really big number, on tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying his IRR</p>
<p>on the money Amazon deployed in R&amp;D projects</p>
<p>like the Kindle or AWS.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was about 40, 42%,</p>
<p>over like a multi-decade period.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Double what a venture firm would do,</p>
<p>or top debt venture firm would do.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s in a class by itself.</p>
<p>But my takeaway in that moment was,</p>
<p>wow, this is the smartest investor of our generation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I said to Bezos at the time.</p>
<p>And Bezos had a track record of selling</p>
<p>roughly a billion dollars of Amazon stock every year.</p>
<p>And this year he snap sold 6.6 billion.</p>
<p>Which, when we talk about the percentage you&rsquo;re selling,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about selling 5%, 10%.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re not diluting their whole positions,</p>
<p>but these are big numbers, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a signal.</p>
<p>Jake, are you gonna close this out?</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been another amazing episode.</p>
<p>Episode 55 of the All-In Podcast from,</p>
<p>yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>You know where people are coming from.</p>
<p>The All-In Summit will be in the spring at some point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to Miami and look at the locations.</p>
<p>March 11th through 15th, I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m playing poker.</p>
<p>Yes, okay.</p>
<p>You got your poker chip.</p>
<p>In an undisclosed location, big time poker.</p>
<p>I can go, listen, is there any way I can deal?</p>
<p>Can I deal the game?</p>
<p>Big boy poker.</p>
<p>You need to have a funny guy there.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not a great dealer,</p>
<p>but can I be a waiter or something?</p>
<p>I think the game starts at 2,000, 4,000,</p>
<p>but it could get a little spicier.</p>
<p>Spicy.</p>
<p>Zach, you&rsquo;ve had a good year.</p>
<p>Maybe you should go.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe you should.</p>
<p>A Solana play?</p>
<p>Get the Solana chips and play?</p>
<p>Oh, he can play.</p>
<p>David can play.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s invited.</p>
<p>Solana plays!</p>
<p>A lot of bequeting this year.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>You chip off 10 milli in Solana,</p>
<p>you put it in an LLC,</p>
<p>and then you buy into the game,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re in for a breeze.</p>
<p>That may not be enough.</p>
<p>That may not be enough.</p>
<p>All right, 20, whatever.</p>
<p>20&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>For the queen of quinoa, the dictator,</p>
<p>and rain man, David Sacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jay Cowell.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you next time on the All-In Podcast.</p>
<p>Subscribe to the channel.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain man, David Sacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And instead, we open-sourced it to the fans,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Wesley.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a piss in your driveway.</p>
<p>Sacks.</p>
<p>Wait, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatar will meet me at Queens.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this sexual tension,</p>
<p>but they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the B.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the B.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
