    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is Episode 12, Early Greek, Hittite, and the Trojan War.</p>
<p>Over the last few episodes, we&rsquo;ve looked at the migration of the original Indo-European</p>
<p>from the Eurasian steppes to the areas where the modern Indo-European languages are located.</p>
<p>We will now begin to look at each of the individual Indo-European languages which have directly</p>
<p>impacted the history of English.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll begin with the Early Greeks.</p>
<p>But before I begin, let me give a quick thanks to Lewis Henwood and naturalearthdata.com</p>
<p>for the fantastic maps which Lewis prepared for the website, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t checked out the site recently, you might want to check out the pages for</p>
<p>Episodes 9, 10, and 11.</p>
<p>The maps included there are wonderful maps that fully illustrate the migrations which</p>
<p>I discussed in those episodes.</p>
<p>So thanks again to Lewis.</p>
<p>Now this time, I want to introduce you to the Ancient Greeks, and I want to explore</p>
<p>the Indo-European roots of those Ancient Greek-speaking people.</p>
<p>The Greek language is the biggest influence on modern English outside of Latin and, of</p>
<p>course, English&rsquo;s native Germanic roots.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not interested in ancient history, you probably know that Greek culture</p>
<p>was a major influence on Western civilization.</p>
<p>The Greek influence extends into many disciplines that were pioneered in Greece, including music,</p>
<p>philosophy, politics, drama, and poetry.</p>
<p>All words that come from Greek, by the way.</p>
<p>But this is not a podcast about Western civilization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a podcast about English.</p>
<p>And Greek has had two major influences on English.</p>
<p>The first is vocabulary.</p>
<p>As you know by now, English is a Germanic language, but it&rsquo;s borrowed heavily from</p>
<p>other languages.</p>
<p>The biggest source of borrowed words is Latin, including words taken from French, which is</p>
<p>a derivative of Latin.</p>
<p>But the second biggest source of English loan words is Greek.</p>
<p>Now Ancient Greece existed long before the Anglo-Saxons arrived in Britain, and therefore</p>
<p>early Anglo-Saxon English didn&rsquo;t really borrow directly from Greek.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon or Old English was much closer to a pure Germanic language.</p>
<p>But after the Norman conquest of England in 1066, Latin and French words began to pour</p>
<p>into English.</p>
<p>And this is also the point at which Greek words began to flow into English.</p>
<p>And the reason for that connection is the fact that Latin itself had borrowed heavily</p>
<p>from Greek.</p>
<p>The Romans were fascinated by Greek culture, and they generally sought to adopt the best</p>
<p>parts of it into Roman culture.</p>
<p>And that meant they borrowed a lot of words from Greek.</p>
<p>So a lot of the Latin words which English adopted had Greek origins.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at a lot of those words as we look at the Greeks in more detail.</p>
<p>The next major deposit of Greek words occurred during and after the Renaissance in the late</p>
<p>Middle Ages.</p>
<p>As you may know, there were two dominant languages in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Latin of course dominated the western portion of the empire, but Greek was the dominant</p>
<p>language in the east.</p>
<p>Greek had been a lingua franca in the eastern Mediterranean before the Roman conquest, and</p>
<p>Latin was never able to replace it there.</p>
<p>In fact, when the Roman Empire was eventually divided into western and eastern portions,</p>
<p>it was this linguistic divide which served as the basis for the division.</p>
<p>The Latin-speaking west evolved into the western Roman Empire, and the Greek-speaking</p>
<p>east evolved into the eastern Roman Empire, or later called the Byzantine Empire, with</p>
<p>its capital at Constantinople.</p>
<p>But in 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>And that led to the disbursement of Greek scholars throughout western Europe.</p>
<p>They brought with them manuscripts which had been written in ancient Greek, which were</p>
<p>previously unknown in the west.</p>
<p>The discovery of this pre-Christian Greek culture caused an intellectual, social, and</p>
<p>cultural revolution in the west.</p>
<p>This was the Renaissance.</p>
<p>And it came with an influx of Greek words associated with all of those things I mentioned</p>
<p>earlier—music, philosophy, politics, drama, and poetry.</p>
<p>And it also extended to architecture, science, and literature.</p>
<p>Many of these Greek words were therefore borrowed directly from Greek during the period</p>
<p>of modern English.</p>
<p>But the major point here is that most Greek words came into English during the Middle</p>
<p>English and Modern English periods, so they were later additions to the language for the</p>
<p>most part.</p>
<p>So Greek vocabulary has influenced English.</p>
<p>But I said there were two major Greek contributions to English.</p>
<p>The other influence was the way we write those words—the alphabet.</p>
<p>In fact, the word alphabet itself comes from the first two letters of the Greek alphabet—alpha</p>
<p>and beta.</p>
<p>The history of the alphabet is a fascinating story in itself.</p>
<p>And much of the early history of the alphabet involves the entire eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>So while the Greeks will be the focus of the next few episodes, I will actually be talking</p>
<p>about the entire region in order to see all of the moving pieces which ultimately came</p>
<p>together to deliver the alphabet to the Greeks.</p>
<p>The story of the early Greeks in the eastern Mediterranean also presents some themes which</p>
<p>will extend throughout ancient history and arguably still exist today.</p>
<p>During this period, we start to see the conflicts between the Indo-European languages and cultures,</p>
<p>settling in from the north, and the Egyptian, Semitic, and other languages and cultures</p>
<p>from the south.</p>
<p>We see this in the rivalry between the Hittites and the Egyptians, the Hebrews and the Philistines,</p>
<p>the Greeks and the Phoenicians, and the Roman Empire and the native Aramaic speakers during</p>
<p>the early Christian era.</p>
<p>Each of these cases involves a conflict between Indo-European-speaking civilizations and Egyptian</p>
<p>or Semitic civilizations.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to look at these events from a linguistic perspective.</p>
<p>Many of these events also provide a backdrop to the development and spread of the alphabet.</p>
<p>So in this episode, I&rsquo;m going to look at the settlement of the first Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>into Anatolia and Greece, and I&rsquo;m going to explore the rise and fall of the Hittite</p>
<p>Empire and the first Greek civilization, and I&rsquo;m going to explain how these events are</p>
<p>connected to the emergence of the first alphabet and the adoption of that alphabet by the Greeks.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of ancient history here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin the story of the Greeks and the Eastern Mediterranean with the arrival of</p>
<p>the first Indo-Europeans, the Hittites and the Greeks.</p>
<p>When we think about ancient Greece, I think we tend to think about the early rivalry between</p>
<p>Athens and Sparta, and we think about the rise of Greek culture, the great philosophers</p>
<p>like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.</p>
<p>We think of architecture like the Acropolis and the Parthenon, and military heroes like</p>
<p>Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>But all of those things are part of the era which extended from around 800 BC to the first</p>
<p>century BC when the Greeks were defeated by the Romans.</p>
<p>And until the late 1800s, this was the oldest known period of Greek history.</p>
<p>Virtually nothing was known about Greece before this period.</p>
<p>Greek history basically began with the rise of the various city-states like Athens, Sparta,</p>
<p>and Corinth.</p>
<p>Now we did have a couple of epic poems which you&rsquo;ve probably heard of, the Iliad and the</p>
<p>Odyssey.</p>
<p>These epics were attributed to a blind poet named Homer around the very beginning of this</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>And these epic poems described an ancient Greek civilization at war with Troy in the</p>
<p>so-called Trojan War.</p>
<p>But these were considered fictional accounts.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t really considered history.</p>
<p>The poems mentioned a Greek city called Mycenae and the city-state of Troy, as well as other</p>
<p>cities which no longer existed.</p>
<p>So all of this was generally considered the stuff of legend.</p>
<p>Mycenae and Troy were placed in the same category as Atlantis, legendary but mythological places.</p>
<p>But archaeological discoveries in the late 1800s and early 1900s revealed that there</p>
<p>actually was a Mycenae and a city of Troy.</p>
<p>And shields, described by Homer as basically having the shape of a figure eight, were also</p>
<p>unearthed.</p>
<p>Shields of this nature had only been known in these epic poems, which were thought to</p>
<p>be fiction.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t exist during the later Greek period.</p>
<p>And yet here they were.</p>
<p>We now know that at least parts of the Iliad and the Odyssey were likely rooted in fact.</p>
<p>Not that the stories themselves were factual, but it turns out there really was a city of</p>
<p>Troy and an ancient Greek civilization that predated the known history of Greece.</p>
<p>And it turns out that there was probably a Trojan War.</p>
<p>And that war may have provided the backdrop for the stories that passed through the generations</p>
<p>in the oral tradition before they were finally reduced to writing.</p>
<p>And by the way, not coincidentally, the Iliad and the Odyssey were written down for the</p>
<p>first time just after the alphabet was adopted by the Greeks in the eighth century B.C.</p>
<p>So these were some of the first works to be captured for posterity by the alphabet.</p>
<p>And for the same reason, these two epic poems are generally considered to be the beginning</p>
<p>of European literature.</p>
<p>These two poems also coincide with the beginning of regular historical records in Greece.</p>
<p>Once the alphabet was adopted, historical records could be maintained.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why our knowledge of Greece before that time was largely unknown.</p>
<p>There was no alphabet before then, so no known written records existed.</p>
<p>That meant that everything before then was prehistory.</p>
<p>And the same thing was basically true of the Hittites to the east in Anatolia.</p>
<p>Prior to the early 1900s, nothing was really known about them outside of a few references</p>
<p>in the Old Testament of the Bible.</p>
<p>For example, it&rsquo;s stated that King David had a Hittite named Uriah killed in battle in</p>
<p>order to steal his wife Bathsheba.</p>
<p>But everyone assumed that the Hittites were just some random Near Eastern tribe like many</p>
<p>others mentioned in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>But archaeological discoveries changed everything.</p>
<p>In the mid-1800s, the ruins of a large ancient city were discovered in central Anatolia.</p>
<p>The city contained walls, monuments, and reliefs with hieroglyphic inscriptions.</p>
<p>But no one knew what the city was or what language the inscriptions were written in.</p>
<p>Over the next few decades, people in Anatolia began to come across monuments, statues, reliefs,</p>
<p>and stamped seals, all with similar-looking hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>And these were being found throughout central Anatolia.</p>
<p>All of this suggested some ancient civilization.</p>
<p>But no one really knew what it was.</p>
<p>In the late 1800s, an Oxford professor named Archibald Henry Sace claimed to have found</p>
<p>a connection between all of these monuments.</p>
<p>And he also claimed that he had partially deciphered one of the stone reliefs.</p>
<p>He concluded that all of the inscriptions belonged to the Hittites.</p>
<p>Again, at the time, no one really knew anything about the Hittites.</p>
<p>The big surprise was that these Hittites occupied such a large kingdom and weren&rsquo;t some obscure</p>
<p>tribe as previously thought.</p>
<p>After this discovery, archaeologists began to travel to Turkey to investigate this ancient</p>
<p>civilization.</p>
<p>These archaeologists uncovered even more tablets.</p>
<p>But these were written in a separate form of early writing called cuneiform.</p>
<p>Many of these texts were composed in Akkadian, which was the international language of the</p>
<p>region at the time.</p>
<p>Since Akkadian had already been deciphered, it was possible to actually read these inscriptions.</p>
<p>And the excavations soon revealed a clay tablet which referred to a certain unpleasantness</p>
<p>between the Egyptians and the Hittites.</p>
<p>The tablet was actually a peace treaty between the Hittites and the Egyptian pharaoh, Ramses</p>
<p>II, which was signed after the Battle of Kadesh.</p>
<p>That made the treaty over 3,000 years old.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s considered to be the first known written peace treaty, and today it&rsquo;s actually exhibited</p>
<p>at the entrance to the Security Council of the United Nations in New York.</p>
<p>As I said, many of the texts were composed in Akkadian, which was sort of a lingua franca</p>
<p>of the region.</p>
<p>But many others were composed in an unknown language, which scholars concluded had to</p>
<p>be Hittite.</p>
<p>The Czech linguist Biedrich Hrozny studied the inscriptions, and he quickly concluded</p>
<p>that the language was an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>One day he isolated the word for bread, and he concluded that a phrase containing the</p>
<p>word bread also had to have words for eat and drink.</p>
<p>And from that he deciphered a complete sentence, now you will eat bread, further you will drink</p>
<p>water.</p>
<p>What Hrozny had discovered was Hittite, the oldest known Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Based upon Hrozny&rsquo;s initial work, other scholars were able to decipher over 25,000 tablets</p>
<p>and other inscriptions all written in this Hittite language.</p>
<p>This included treaties, letters, laws, rituals, and prayers.</p>
<p>These documents also mentioned specific cities, kings, queens, and historical events.</p>
<p>From these inscriptions and other research, we now know a great deal about the ancient</p>
<p>Hittite empire and the Hittite people.</p>
<p>But since the Hittite language did not have any direct impact on English, I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to spend a lot of time on it here.</p>
<p>But the Hittite civilization is a player in our overall story of the Eastern Mediterranean,</p>
<p>so there are a few things you should know about that civilization.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the last episode, the Hittites entered Anatolia from the Indo-European homeland</p>
<p>north of the Black Sea sometime around 2000 B.C.</p>
<p>Now the area where the Hittite ancestors settled in Anatolia was previously occupied by people</p>
<p>called the Hatti, and they called this particular region Hatti.</p>
<p>And the arriving Hittites apparently moved in and conquered the native Hatti people around</p>
<p>1700 B.C.</p>
<p>The Hittites called the area the Land of the Hatti after the Hattians they had conquered.</p>
<p>And this is the basis of the name Hittite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s believed that around 1650 B.C. the Hittite ruler managed to join all of the various local</p>
<p>people under his rule, thereby establishing the Hittite kingdom.</p>
<p>The Hittite kingdom soon evolved into a great empire.</p>
<p>It actually took a place beside Egypt and Assyria as a major political power in the</p>
<p>Near East.</p>
<p>And these major regional powers were soon to be joined by the early Greeks, but more</p>
<p>on that in a minute.</p>
<p>Soon after the Hittites conquered the native Hattians, their armies became powerful enough</p>
<p>to challenge the great powers of the Near East.</p>
<p>They looted Babylon and they fought the Assyrians.</p>
<p>The Hittite empire reached its peak in the fourteenth century B.C., and it expanded its</p>
<p>power to the south into Syria at the expense of the Egyptians.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Egyptian influence and control extended from Egypt northward all the way</p>
<p>to the Hittite territory outside Syria.</p>
<p>So the stage was set for a major showdown between those two ancient powers.</p>
<p>And interestingly, one of the sparks which ignited the great battle between the Egyptians</p>
<p>and the Hittites involved the Egyptian ruler who had become known as one of the most famous</p>
<p>mummies in the world, King Tut.</p>
<p>Around 1327 B.C., King Tut, or Tutankhamen, died very young without any children.</p>
<p>His widow frantically sent a letter to the Hittite king proposing a marriage alliance</p>
<p>between herself and one of the Hittite king&rsquo;s sons.</p>
<p>In the letter, Tut&rsquo;s widow vowed that she would not marry one of her subjects and that</p>
<p>she was, quote, very much afraid, end quote.</p>
<p>The Hittite king then sent one of his sons to Egypt, but the son was murdered as soon</p>
<p>as he reached the Egyptian border.</p>
<p>And then Tut&rsquo;s widow was forced to marry one of her subjects, a royal advisor.</p>
<p>But an immediate war was averted when the Hittite king himself died a short time later.</p>
<p>But the murder of the Hittite king&rsquo;s son and the surrounding circumstances led to a</p>
<p>great deal of unease between the Hittites and the Egyptians.</p>
<p>There was a period of cold war for a while.</p>
<p>But in 1265 B.C., the Egyptian pharaoh, Ramses II, launched a campaign against the Hittites</p>
<p>to seize control of Kadesh in modern Syria.</p>
<p>This was an attempt to break the Hittite power and gain control over the region for Egypt.</p>
<p>The Battle of Kadesh is considered the first documented battle in world history, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also considered the greatest chariot battle of all time.</p>
<p>Ramses II was nearly defeated early in the battle, but he had split his army and the</p>
<p>reinforcements arrived just in time to prevent defeat.</p>
<p>But the battle ultimately resulted in a stalemate.</p>
<p>The result of this battle was the peace treaty between the Hittites and the Egyptians, which</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier, and which is still located at the United Nations in New York.</p>
<p>Now Egypt and the Hittite kingdom coexisted for around another century, and they even</p>
<p>entered into an alliance around 1258 B.C. against the rising power of the Assyrians</p>
<p>to the east.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at this point that we have to turn our attention to the West, to the rise of</p>
<p>a new power in the region, the ancient Greek civilization.</p>
<p>The exact time and manner in which the first Indo-Europeans arrived in Greece is unknown.</p>
<p>They might have come through western Anatolia and then traveled to Greece by sea around</p>
<p>2400 to 2200 B.C.</p>
<p>This was a period when Greece was experiencing a great deal of immigration, and this view</p>
<p>would help to explain some of the connections between the Greek language and the earliest</p>
<p>Armenian language and Indo-Iranian languages.</p>
<p>The other view is that the Indo-Europeans arrived in Greece via the Balkans from beyond</p>
<p>the Danube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the view which I presented in the last episode.</p>
<p>A third related possibility is that they arrived via the Balkans and then traveled</p>
<p>into Anatolia, where they stayed for a while, and then traveled westward to Greece.</p>
<p>Regardless, it appears that the first Indo-European Greeks settled into modern Greece shortly</p>
<p>after 2000 B.C.</p>
<p>So this was around the same time that the Hittites were settling into central Anatolia</p>
<p>to the east.</p>
<p>It also appears that successive waves of Indo-Europeans arrived in the Greek peninsula, with each</p>
<p>subsequent group speaking a slightly different dialect, which may explain the division of</p>
<p>Greek dialects into western and eastern groups.</p>
<p>So as we look at Greece, we have to consider what was there when the Indo-Europeans arrived.</p>
<p>For the most part, we have some native peoples who fished and hunted, and some lived in small</p>
<p>farming communities.</p>
<p>They also were making bronze tools by mixing copper and tin, or sometimes copper and arsenic.</p>
<p>But outside of some general archaeological evidence, very little is known about these</p>
<p>people who preceded the Indo-Europeans in mainland Greece.</p>
<p>Now part of the reason for using 2000 B.C. as the arrival date of the Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>in Greece is the archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>This evidence indicates that sites throughout the region were sacked and burned by invaders</p>
<p>in a wave around 2100 B.C., and then in a second and larger wave around 1900 B.C.</p>
<p>And objects from this period that have been unearthed contain depictions of people with</p>
<p>heavy beards and a distinctly European appearance, accompanied by long swords, chariots and horses.</p>
<p>All of those things are closely associated with the Indo-Europeans, as I&rsquo;ve discussed</p>
<p>in prior episodes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s mainland Greece and the many surrounding small islands.</p>
<p>But if we move away from the Greek mainland and look southward into the Aegean Sea, we</p>
<p>find a large island known as Crete.</p>
<p>And it turns out that there was not only a civilization in place there when the Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>arrived, but it was in fact a very old and advanced civilization.</p>
<p>It was the ancient Minoan civilization, which was unearthed and excavated just over a century</p>
<p>ago by the Englishman Arthur Evans.</p>
<p>According to Greek legend, this civilization had a legendary king named Minos.</p>
<p>So Evans called it the Minoan civilization.</p>
<p>But remember, this civilization on Crete was in place before the Indo-Europeans arrived.</p>
<p>So they did not speak an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And even though it existed in the area we know today as Greece, many historians consider</p>
<p>it to be pre-Greek, since the Greek language is associated with the Indo-Europeans who</p>
<p>arrived later.</p>
<p>Now in the centuries following their arrival in Greece at around 2000 B.C., the Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>established their own civilization centered around the city of Mycenae.</p>
<p>Therefore this civilization is known to us today as the Mycenaean civilization.</p>
<p>And their language was the ancient ancestor of Classical Greek and eventually Modern Greek.</p>
<p>They also developed a highly centralized bureaucratic system of administration.</p>
<p>Now as you may recall from earlier, the Hittite Empire over in Anatolia began to rise to power</p>
<p>around 1650 B.C.</p>
<p>And at the same time in Greece, Mycenaean warrior kings ruled over Mycenae and other</p>
<p>parts of Greece.</p>
<p>So Mycenaean power grew in Greece just as Hittite power grew in Anatolia.</p>
<p>The Mycenaeans quickly adapted to the sea once they settled in mainland Greece and the</p>
<p>many islands that surrounded it.</p>
<p>Over the following centuries they would become famous for their seafaring.</p>
<p>But this did not allow them to interact with the existing Minoan civilization on the large</p>
<p>island of Crete.</p>
<p>It led to trade between the two peoples and probably led to a rivalry over time.</p>
<p>In fact, that rivalry with the Minoan civilization on Crete probably accounts for a very well-known</p>
<p>Greek legend about the Minoan king, Minos.</p>
<p>According to the legend, Minos had a half-man, half-bull creature called a Minotaur.</p>
<p>And he kept that creature in a complicated maze called a labyrinth.</p>
<p>No one who entered the maze was able to find his or her way out, and the Minotaur fed on</p>
<p>the people who entered the maze.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Minos&rsquo; son was killed by the Greek king Aegeus, and the Greeks had to atone</p>
<p>for the murder by sending seven boys and girls to the Minoan capital every nine years.</p>
<p>They would enter the maze and meet their death at the hands of the Minotaur.</p>
<p>But eventually, the Greek king&rsquo;s son, Theseus, offered to go and kill the Minotaur.</p>
<p>When he entered the labyrinth, he had a ball of thread which he tied to the entrance, and</p>
<p>he unwound it as he traveled through the maze.</p>
<p>He eventually found the Minotaur and killed it, and he was able to find his way out of</p>
<p>the maze by following the thread back to the entrance.</p>
<p>When Theseus returned to Greece, he was supposed to change the color of the sails on his ship</p>
<p>from black to white to indicate his success, but he forgot to do so.</p>
<p>When his father, King Aegeus, saw the black sails approaching, he thought that his son</p>
<p>had been killed by the Minotaur, and in despair he threw himself into the ocean and died.</p>
<p>And according to the legend, the sea was thereafter known as the Aegean Sea, so named because</p>
<p>King Aegeus met his death in the sea under the mistaken assumption that his son had been</p>
<p>killed by the Minotaur.</p>
<p>I wanted to recount that story because it explains an interesting change in the meaning</p>
<p>of a very common English word.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the word clue.</p>
<p>Today we normally associate the word clue with a hint or something that provides an</p>
<p>answer to a question or a solution to a problem.</p>
<p>Well the word clue originally meant a ball of yarn or thread.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an Old English word, and it had that meaning in the period of Old English.</p>
<p>But this story of Theseus and the Minotaur was very popular in England in the Middle</p>
<p>Ages, and it was so well known that writers sometimes used the word clue to mean a ball</p>
<p>of yarn or thread used to find one&rsquo;s way out of a maze.</p>
<p>So they used the word in reference to this famous story of the labyrinth and the Minotaur.</p>
<p>And from that sense of the word clue as a way to solve a maze or a puzzle, it started</p>
<p>to acquire a broader sense as a way to solve any kind of problem.</p>
<p>And that gave us the modern sense of the word clue.</p>
<p>However, the word clue can still be found in English with its original meaning as a</p>
<p>ball of yarn or thread, but it&rsquo;s usually spelled c-l-e-w when it&rsquo;s used in that context.</p>
<p>So even though the words seem like distinct words today, in actuality c-l-u-e meaning</p>
<p>a hint and c-l-e-w meaning a ball of thread are ultimately the same word.</p>
<p>The different spellings reflect the modern difference in meanings.</p>
<p>Again, this legend of the labyrinth and the Minotaur developed in Greece, and it probably</p>
<p>reflects an ancient trading relationship and rivalry between the Mycenaean Greeks on the</p>
<p>mainland and the Minoan civilization on Crete.</p>
<p>The Mycenaeans gradually began to assimilate the Minoan culture into their own culture.</p>
<p>Over time, Mycenaean art, architecture, clothing, and customs all began to show distinct Minoan</p>
<p>influences.</p>
<p>And the Mycenaeans also began to write down their language for the first time by adopting</p>
<p>a script that the Minoans had been using.</p>
<p>And since this is one of the first instances of an Indo-European people adopting a written</p>
<p>language, I think it&rsquo;s important to take a look at exactly what was going on here.</p>
<p>Now remember that the Minoans on the island of Crete predated the arrival of the Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>So they were pre-Greek, and they kept official records by writing symbols on clay.</p>
<p>They had adopted that writing system shortly after the civilization was established.</p>
<p>The system had started as simple picture writing, somewhat similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>But sometime between 1900 B.C. and 1700 B.C., the Minoans had developed a second script,</p>
<p>which was a linear script known today as Linear A.</p>
<p>Again it was linear, meaning that it wasn&rsquo;t made up of pictures like hieroglyphics or</p>
<p>wedge-shaped markings like cuneiform.</p>
<p>It was written in lines, and at first glance it resembled an alphabet.</p>
<p>But it was not an alphabet, as we&rsquo;ll see in a moment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, linguists have never been able to decipher this script.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no bilingual Rosetta Stone to help.</p>
<p>But the language written in Linear A is definitely not Greek.</p>
<p>The Greeks were just beginning to settle into mainland Greece at this time, and their influence</p>
<p>had not yet reached the Minoans down in Crete.</p>
<p>Again, this Minoan Linear A script was unique.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an alphabet.</p>
<p>It was a syllabic form of writing.</p>
<p>In other words, it used the same basic approach as hieroglyphics, or cuneiform, which I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>discuss in more detail later.</p>
<p>All of these forms of writing used symbols for the sound of syllables.</p>
<p>So ba would have a symbol, and at would have a symbol, and al would have a symbol.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll see, this system works, but it&rsquo;s not efficient.</p>
<p>Syllables are made up of two or more sounds put together, usually a vowel and one or more</p>
<p>consonants, and there are lots of possible sound combinations in any given language.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re going to use a separate symbol for each syllable or sound combination, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to need a lot of symbols.</p>
<p>And that was the problem with syllabic writing systems.</p>
<p>They were difficult to learn and use because there were so many symbols involved.</p>
<p>But an alphabet takes a different approach.</p>
<p>It breaks syllables down to their basic sounds or phonemes.</p>
<p>So rather than a symbol for ba, there&rsquo;s a symbol, called a letter, for ba, and a separate</p>
<p>symbol or letter for a.</p>
<p>And an alphabet allows you to put those two together to form ba.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why that idea was so revolutionary.</p>
<p>Unlike syllables, there are only a few basic sounds or phonemes in most languages.</p>
<p>You can combine them in all sorts of ways, but there are only a handful of those basic</p>
<p>sounds.</p>
<p>Typically, there are only about a couple of dozen of those sounds or phonemes.</p>
<p>So with an alphabet, you only have to master a handful of letters.</p>
<p>In modern English, it&rsquo;s just 26.</p>
<p>And with those few letters, you can spell any word in the language.</p>
<p>Even children can do it.</p>
<p>And they do, in fact, learn to do it in grade school, if not before.</p>
<p>But again, with a syllabic writing system, there are hundreds and even thousands of symbols</p>
<p>to represent each possible syllable that may exist within that language.</p>
<p>So you can see why the alphabet quickly replaced syllabic writing systems once it was introduced.</p>
<p>The alphabet was easy to learn, and it made writing much easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>So the alphabet spread very, very quickly, and literacy spread with it.</p>
<p>But at this earlier point in Greek history, there was no alphabet yet.</p>
<p>The Mycenaean Greeks did not have a writing system at all, and the Minoans down on Crete</p>
<p>had to work with the syllabic script known as Linear A.</p>
<p>Now as I&rsquo;ve noted, the Mycenaean Greeks spread throughout the Greek mainland and the</p>
<p>surrounding islands.</p>
<p>And eventually, as their power grew, they set their sights on the Minoan civilization</p>
<p>in Crete.</p>
<p>Around 1450 B.C., it appears that the Mycenaeans invaded the island of Crete and defeated the</p>
<p>Minoans.</p>
<p>And many historians think that this invasion was made in conjunction with or shortly after</p>
<p>a volcanic eruption which destroyed a large portion of the capital city of Crete.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method and motivation, the Mycenaeans took control of Crete around 1450</p>
<p>B.C.</p>
<p>And part of the reason why we know the conquest happened around that time is because that</p>
<p>Minoan script, Linear A, disappeared around that time.</p>
<p>And that old script was replaced with a completely new script called Linear B.</p>
<p>And this Linear B script not only existed for several centuries after this point in</p>
<p>Crete, it also began to appear throughout mainland Greece as well.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why that change in script is so important.</p>
<p>In 1952, literally a few decades ago, that Linear B script was finally deciphered.</p>
<p>And it turned out that the writings composed in that script were actually a very early</p>
<p>form of Greek.</p>
<p>In fact, it was what we call today Mycenaean Greek, the earliest known form of the Greek</p>
<p>language, spoken by the first Indo-European Greeks.</p>
<p>Since this shift from the original Linear A script to the new Linear B script occurred</p>
<p>in Crete around 1450 B.C., it&rsquo;s believed that this represents the point at which the</p>
<p>Mycenaean Greeks took over there.</p>
<p>And it also suggests that the Mycenaeans borrowed this script for their own Indo-European language</p>
<p>and converted it into the new Linear B script.</p>
<p>And from there, this script spread throughout mainland Greece.</p>
<p>But remember that this was still a syllabic script.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve already explained, syllabic scripts were hard to work with.</p>
<p>They required scribes to memorize symbols for every possible syllable that occurred</p>
<p>in the language.</p>
<p>Very few people could actually do that.</p>
<p>Linear B consisted of 85 signs and dozens of other symbols.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that as few as 5% of the Mycenaean Greeks could actually read or write that Linear</p>
<p>B script.</p>
<p>So these early Mycenaean Greeks had a written language.</p>
<p>But it was of very limited use, pretty much just for government and commercial functions.</p>
<p>And very few people were capable of writing with it.</p>
<p>The Greeks would have to wait another 500 years for the alphabet to arrive, which was</p>
<p>much more efficient to work with and which changed communication forever.</p>
<p>But the fact that the Mycenaean Greeks had a written language at all is very important</p>
<p>to historians because it means that there are surviving records that can be analyzed.</p>
<p>And those records shed light on this early Greek culture.</p>
<p>For example, some Linear B tablets include a list of gods and deities that received offerings</p>
<p>like honey, wine, olive oil, animals, and even human slaves.</p>
<p>Those tablets include references to deities like Zeus and Poseidon.</p>
<p>So those tablets confirm that those deities existed in Greek mythology and religion long</p>
<p>before the period of classical Greece.</p>
<p>Now even though these early Greeks had a common script for writing, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that</p>
<p>they all spoke the same way.</p>
<p>In fact, there were actually several different Greek dialects being spoken throughout Greece.</p>
<p>Those dialects included Mycenaean, Aeolic, Doric, and Attic Ionic.</p>
<p>The Attic dialect was spoken in and around Athens.</p>
<p>And as Athens emerged as a dominant city-state, the Attic dialect eventually emerged as the</p>
<p>dominant dialect in Greece, forming the basis of classical Greek and eventually modern Greek.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s later in our story.</p>
<p>Following the Mycenaean takeover of Crete, Mycenaean civilization spread with trade and</p>
<p>cultural influences throughout the Aegean, and they spread to Egypt and Phoenicia in</p>
<p>the Middle East and the Hittite kingdom in Anatolia.</p>
<p>They even spread to southern Italy.</p>
<p>And Mycenaean Greece emerged as one of the three great powers in the eastern Mediterranean,</p>
<p>together with the Hittite kingdom in the east and the Egyptian civilization to the south.</p>
<p>As the Greeks spread their influence eastward into Anatolia, they encountered a city called</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>The city was located on the western coast of Anatolia, which is modern-day Turkey.</p>
<p>So it was located across the Aegean Sea from mainland Greece, but it was part of the Greek</p>
<p>sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The Greeks were seafarers, and the western part of Anatolia was easily accessible by</p>
<p>boat or ship.</p>
<p>The people of Troy were called the Trojans, and very little is known about them with any</p>
<p>certainty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even clear what language they spoke.</p>
<p>They apparently did not have a written language.</p>
<p>One theory is that the Trojans spoke an Indo-European language that was closely related to Hittite.</p>
<p>The language is known as Luwian, and it was spoken in western parts of Anatolia.</p>
<p>Historians have unearthed a Hittite seal in the remains of Troy, which were inscribed</p>
<p>in Luwian.</p>
<p>If true, that would suggest that the ancestors of the Trojans settled in western Anatolia</p>
<p>around the same time that the ancestors of the Hittites settled in the central part of</p>
<p>Anatolia.</p>
<p>Again both Hittite and Luwian are part of the same Anatolian subfamily within the larger</p>
<p>Indo-European family of languages.</p>
<p>But again, no one really knows for sure if the Trojans spoke that language.</p>
<p>And even if they did, it appears that the Hittite civilization had very little influence</p>
<p>on Troy itself.</p>
<p>As I noted, the Trojans apparently had a much closer connection with the Mycenaean Greeks</p>
<p>than the Hittites.</p>
<p>Mycenaean artifacts have been uncovered at Troy, and that suggests that there was extensive</p>
<p>trade between the two regions.</p>
<p>But we may never know the full story of the relationship between Troy and Greece.</p>
<p>Whatever that relationship was, it apparently led to a major conflict around the year 1250</p>
<p>B.C.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the oral tradition tells us that the Mycenaeans invaded Troy and the Trojan</p>
<p>War began.</p>
<p>Once again, very little is known with certainty about the war, but it was apparently such</p>
<p>a major event in Greek history that later generations loved to tell stories and sing</p>
<p>songs about the war and the aftermath of the war.</p>
<p>Those stories were passed down from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>And when the Greeks finally adopted the alphabet about four centuries later, some of these</p>
<p>stories were written down and preserved in the epic poems we know today as the Iliad</p>
<p>and the Odyssey.</p>
<p>Those stories were attributed to a poet named Homer, but they were almost certainly derived</p>
<p>from older legends and stories that were passed down over the centuries in the oral tradition.</p>
<p>Other stories and legends about the war were preserved in other works composed in Greece</p>
<p>and Rome over the following centuries.</p>
<p>Together, these stories told of a massive invasion of Troy by the Greeks, which resulted</p>
<p>in a ten-year siege of the city.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s no way to confirm such a siege, but it does appear that the city of</p>
<p>Troy was destroyed around the time that the war supposedly happened.</p>
<p>However, in retrospect, the destruction of Troy may not have been all that unusual.</p>
<p>According to archaeologists, the version of Troy that was destroyed around the time of</p>
<p>the Trojan War was actually the seventh city built on the site.</p>
<p>The unearthed remains suggest that the city that existed during the war was a shell of</p>
<p>its former self, and it doesn&rsquo;t appear to match the descriptions in the Iliad at all.</p>
<p>So again, these later stories may have been rooted in an actual event, but they were mostly</p>
<p>the stuff of legend and myth.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s easy to dismiss the Trojan War as a conflict that took place in the distant</p>
<p>past and didn&rsquo;t really have any bearing on the later development of English.</p>
<p>But just as this war fascinated the people of classical Greece, it also fascinated the</p>
<p>Romans, as well as the poets and writers of medieval Europe.</p>
<p>The story of the Trojan hero Aeneas provided the basic foundation myth of Rome.</p>
<p>Writers in medieval England extended the story of Aeneas to proclaim that his descendant</p>
<p>Brutus was the mythological founder of Britain and also the source of the name Britain.</p>
<p>Again, this was all the stuff of myth and legend, but many people in medieval Britain</p>
<p>assumed that it was true.</p>
<p>Britain had its own legendary king, King Arthur, and Arthur was also supposedly descended from</p>
<p>the Trojan heroes Aeneas and Brutus.</p>
<p>This mythological connection encouraged later English poets like Geoffrey Chaucer to harken</p>
<p>back to ancient Greece and the Trojan War.</p>
<p>The war provided the backdrop for one of Chaucer&rsquo;s most famous poems, Troilus and Cressida.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare composed his own version of the story, Troilus and Cressida.</p>
<p>And in fact, the first book to be printed in the English language was a collection of</p>
<p>stories about the Trojans and the Greeks, called Rekai of the Histories of Troy.</p>
<p>So while the real-life Trojan War is shrouded in mystery, the legend of the war has spanned</p>
<p>the centuries and has fascinated generations of readers throughout the Western world.</p>
<p>Now as we look back to the actual evidence on the ground, archaeologists have determined</p>
<p>that the city of Troy was destroyed around 1200 BC.</p>
<p>And that destruction was a precursor of things to come.</p>
<p>In the century that followed the destruction of Troy, just about everything I&rsquo;ve discussed</p>
<p>in this episode was demolished and wiped away.</p>
<p>The Mycenaean Greece, the Mycenaean writing system Linear B, the Hittite Kingdom, all</p>
<p>of it was eradicated.</p>
<p>And even the mighty Egyptian civilization was rocked to its core and almost destroyed.</p>
<p>And to this day historians only have a vague sense of what happened.</p>
<p>This period is sometimes referred to as the Bronze Age Collapse.</p>
<p>Some historians attribute this collapse to an event which is sometimes referred to as</p>
<p>the Invasion of the Sea Peoples, based upon an inscription found in Egypt which described</p>
<p>the episode.</p>
<p>And there are many theories about what happened.</p>
<p>It appears that around the time of the Trojan War, Mycenaean Greece was starting to become</p>
<p>overpopulated, which led to a period of instability as groups competed for limited resources.</p>
<p>But the more important factor was a development that took place north of Greece.</p>
<p>Some scholars think there was a renewed migration of Indo-European tribes in the region north</p>
<p>of Greece, in and around the Balkans.</p>
<p>There were still Indo-European tribes in that region, and it appears that some of them were</p>
<p>still on the move.</p>
<p>By now we know that most European languages are descended from dialects spoken by Indo-European</p>
<p>tribes that migrated in the 2nd and 3rd millennium BC.</p>
<p>But not every tribe gave birth to a language that&rsquo;s spoken today.</p>
<p>Some of those tribes were lost to history, and they never contributed to the modern linguistic</p>
<p>landscape.</p>
<p>Those tribes may have been small in number, or they may have been assimilated into other</p>
<p>tribes and cultures over time.</p>
<p>But at this point in our story, they were still out there, moving around.</p>
<p>And many of them were located in the area north of Greece, in the Danube Valley and</p>
<p>in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Remember from the last episode that the ancestors of the Latin speakers and the Celts were all</p>
<p>so situated in that region for many centuries around this same period.</p>
<p>These tribes and other Indo-European tribes were putting constant pressure on the Mycenaean</p>
<p>Greeks to the south.</p>
<p>Around the time that Troy was destroyed, or shortly thereafter, it appears that some of</p>
<p>those people from the Balkans region swept down through Mycenaean Greece and initiated</p>
<p>a domino effect of destruction and devastation throughout the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Historians originally thought these invaders from the north were the Dorians, a distinct</p>
<p>group of Indo-Europeans who eventually blended in with the other Greek ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Some scholars think there was a Dorian invasion, and that invasion was a trigger for the disruptions</p>
<p>that followed.</p>
<p>Some historians still advance that view, but it now appears that the Dorians arrived around</p>
<p>1100 BC, which would have been a little too late for them to have been the initial cause</p>
<p>of the destruction.</p>
<p>The fact is, history cannot really identify exactly who these people were.</p>
<p>But they did wear horned helmets, and they used ox-drawn covered wagons.</p>
<p>Every indication is that these people were Indo-European tribes, ultimately from the</p>
<p>Eurasian steppe, just like the ancestors of the Mycenaeans themselves.</p>
<p>Whoever these invaders from the north were, they sacked and burned the Mycenaean cities</p>
<p>around 1120 BC.</p>
<p>They overran Greece, and by 1100 BC all of the main Mycenaean centers had fallen to the</p>
<p>attacks of these invaders.</p>
<p>They continued on eastward, through the Hittite Empire in Anatolia, which collapsed during</p>
<p>that same century.</p>
<p>And the invaders continued down the Phoenician coast all the way to Egypt, where they were</p>
<p>finally defeated by Ramses III.</p>
<p>Egyptian historical records refer to an invasion of sea people at this time, which could be</p>
<p>a reference to these invaders from the north, or it could be a reference to Mycenaean Greeks</p>
<p>who were fleeing the devastation in Greece.</p>
<p>Either way, after their defeat by the Egyptians, these northern invaders were generally lost</p>
<p>to history.</p>
<p>But they left total devastation in their wake.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the invasion, Mycenaean Greeks flooded outward looking for new lands,</p>
<p>and their early Greek civilization faded into history.</p>
<p>The domino effect that had been set in motion contributed to waves of mass migrations and</p>
<p>disruptions throughout the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>As I said, both the Mycenaean Greek civilization and the Hittite civilization were destroyed</p>
<p>and lost to history until modern archaeologists rediscovered them.</p>
<p>And even though Egypt was able to beat back the sea people, Egypt&rsquo;s influence was pushed</p>
<p>back to the Nile, and its influence in Palestine was effectively ended.</p>
<p>States in Syria, Palestine, and Cyprus were also attacked.</p>
<p>Babylonia dissolved at the same time, in 1154 B.C., after wars with Assyria and Elam.</p>
<p>So the destruction occurred throughout the entire region.</p>
<p>In the wake of the collapse of the Hittite civilization, a group of Indo-Europeans settled</p>
<p>in from the north there as well.</p>
<p>These people were called the Phrygians.</p>
<p>They settled in the northwestern part of Anatolia, but again they apparently had no written language.</p>
<p>Greek tradition says that the Phrygians came from an earlier homeland in southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>Now as you may recall from Episode 3 on the Indo-European Family Tree, I mentioned Phrygian</p>
<p>as another branch of the Indo-European Family Tree.</p>
<p>Some linguists include it as a branch, even though we know almost nothing about the language</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>The Phrygians actually prospered under a king named Midas, or Maita.</p>
<p>And the later-day Greeks were so impressed by the rule of King Maita that they developed</p>
<p>the legend of King Midas from his reign.</p>
<p>Everything King Midas touched turned to gold.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the root of the term Midas touch, which often appears in English.</p>
<p>A Midas touch is the ability to profit from any effort.</p>
<p>With the collapse of the Hittite kingdom and the Mycenaean Greek civilization and the weakening</p>
<p>of ancient Egypt, a major power vacuum resulted in the areas around modern-day Lebanon and</p>
<p>Israel.</p>
<p>This vacuum allowed the largely Semitic populations in and around Palestine to establish small</p>
<p>independent states in that region along the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Two of the most prominent Semitic-speaking groups in the region were the Hebrews and</p>
<p>the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>So here we have the beginnings of Israel, as well as the Phoenicians, who developed</p>
<p>an early alphabet, which is the basis of the alphabet used throughout the Western world</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>And another group of people also settled in that same narrow strip of land.</p>
<p>They were the Philistines, who were the arch-enemies of the early Hebrews and who are believed</p>
<p>by many historians to be remnants of the Sea Peoples defeated by the Egyptians.</p>
<p>If true, these Philistines would have been either part of the original Indo-European</p>
<p>invaders who caused the disruptions or Greek refugees who were beaten back by the Egyptians</p>
<p>and settled in the same general area as the Hebrews and the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>Excavations of ancient Philistine cities have revealed pottery made in a style that was</p>
<p>common in Greece.</p>
<p>And a recent DNA study of remains acquired from Philistine burial sites revealed that</p>
<p>the bodies shared a significant amount of DNA with the people of southern Europe.</p>
<p>So this period of destruction brought an end to many of the civilizations in the eastern</p>
<p>Mediterranean, but it also allowed others to take root and flourish in the aftermath.</p>
<p>To the northwest, the Mycenaean Greek civilization was not able to recover.</p>
<p>It disappeared in the wake of these disruptions, as did its Linear B script.</p>
<p>For the next three centuries, virtually nothing is known about the history of Greece.</p>
<p>This period represents the so-called Greek Dark Ages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very similar to the period after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in Europe,</p>
<p>which is also called the Dark Ages there.</p>
<p>That period is sometimes called the Dark Ages because written historical accounts largely</p>
<p>disappeared for several centuries.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like someone turned the lights out.</p>
<p>Well the same thing happened at this point in Greece.</p>
<p>The Mycenaean inscriptions disappear from the archaeological record, and we have to</p>
<p>wait three or four hundred years for the later Greeks to pick up the alphabet from</p>
<p>the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>When that finally happened around 800 B.C., the Greeks could start writing again, and</p>
<p>thanks to the alphabet, which was easier to learn and master, literacy spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably not surprising that one of the first works written in this new alphabet</p>
<p>was a collection of epic poems about that great conflict, the Trojan War.</p>
<p>These poems recounted the ancient past of Greece, of Mycenae and Troy.</p>
<p>These stories have been passed along and recounted by bards for centuries in the oral tradition,</p>
<p>which was the only way to preserve these stories without a written language.</p>
<p>Throughout the Greek Dark Ages, these stories were told and sung, and probably embellished.</p>
<p>And even though the written versions of these stories, which we know today as the Iliad</p>
<p>and the Odyssey, are attributed to a blind bard named Homer, we don&rsquo;t really know if</p>
<p>he was the source or not.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know if he really existed.</p>
<p>But we do know that the Iliad had been composed and was reduced to writing by 750 B.C., and</p>
<p>the Odyssey came a short time later.</p>
<p>The Iliad concerned the siege of Troy, and the Odyssey concerned the travels of the Greek</p>
<p>hero Odysseus on his way back home after the war was over.</p>
<p>Those works also mark Greece&rsquo;s emergence from three centuries of Dark Ages, and they represent</p>
<p>the beginning of the period of Greek history, which is most familiar to us today.</p>
<p>The new Greek alphabet allowed poets and authors to write down their words for the first time</p>
<p>in several centuries, and the Greeks had several words for words, or lots of words put together</p>
<p>in a narrative.</p>
<p>One of those words was mythos, which gave us words like myth and mythic.</p>
<p>Another term for word or words was logos, which gave us words like monologue, dialogue,</p>
<p>logic, and the ology in words like apology, analogy, and terminology.</p>
<p>Those two Greek words, mythos and logos, were even combined to produce the English</p>
<p>word mythology.</p>
<p>The Greeks also had another term for a word or group of words.</p>
<p>That term was apos, and it gave us the English word epic.</p>
<p>That word typically describes a type of extended narrative featuring characters who perform</p>
<p>heroic deeds or go on grand adventures.</p>
<p>They usually involve some type of physical or emotional journey.</p>
<p>And as a style of poetry, the word epic is often associated with ancient works like the</p>
<p>Iliad and the Odyssey.</p>
<p>As I noted, these two epic poems are some of the oldest works to be preserved with the</p>
<p>brand-new Greek alphabet in the eighth century B.C.</p>
<p>Now the Iliad isn&rsquo;t really the story of the Trojan War.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a story set during a brief two-week period in the final year of the war.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t really address the cause of the war or explain how the war ended with</p>
<p>the famous story of the Trojan Horse.</p>
<p>Those details are provided by other poems which appeared in subsequent centuries.</p>
<p>The origin of the war is detailed in a later poem called Vesipria.</p>
<p>That poem has actually been lost to history, but fragments of it survive, as does a summary</p>
<p>of the poem composed at a later date.</p>
<p>It is, in effect, a prequel to the Iliad, since it covers the origin and earlier years</p>
<p>of the Trojan War.</p>
<p>That poem also explains the mythological origins of the Trojan War.</p>
<p>It began with a golden apple.</p>
<p>The apple was inscribed with the phrase, For the Fairest.</p>
<p>Three different goddesses claimed the apple because each of them felt that they were the</p>
<p>most beautiful.</p>
<p>The goddesses were Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera.</p>
<p>Eventually, Zeus decided to resolve the argument by selecting the Trojan prince Paris to be</p>
<p>the final judge, and each of the goddesses offered Paris a bribe to decide in her favor.</p>
<p>Aphrodite offered Paris the most beautiful woman in the world as his wife, and he ultimately</p>
<p>accepted the bribe and gave Aphrodite the apple.</p>
<p>The most beautiful woman in the world was Helen, a Greek queen married to the king of</p>
<p>Sparta.</p>
<p>Paris and his entourage then went to Sparta and abducted Helen and brought her back to</p>
<p>Troy.</p>
<p>The Spartan king and his Greek allies then launched an invasion of Troy to recover Helen</p>
<p>and to defeat the Trojans who had taken her away.</p>
<p>So in a sense the entire conflict between the Greeks and the Trojans was caused by a</p>
<p>dispute over an apple.</p>
<p>And that gave us the term apple of discord to refer to the ultimate source or crux of</p>
<p>a much larger dispute.</p>
<p>That story also explains why Helen is referred to as the face that launched a thousand ships.</p>
<p>That was a term coined by the Elizabethan poet Christopher Marlow, who wrote,</p>
<p>Is this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Elyium?</p>
<p>According to another legend, Helen&rsquo;s beauty was widely regarded even as a child, and she</p>
<p>had actually been abducted at least one time before.</p>
<p>As a child she had been abducted by an Athenian prince who intended to hold her in captivity</p>
<p>until she was old enough to marry him.</p>
<p>When the Spartans went to Athens to retrieve her, an Athenian named Academus told them</p>
<p>where Helen was to spare the city.</p>
<p>Academus was venerated for saving the city, and a grove on the outskirts of the city was</p>
<p>named in his honor.</p>
<p>This spot became known as the Grove of Academus.</p>
<p>And in the fourth century B.C., Plato moved next to the grove and began teaching his students</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>His school was later named after that nearby Grove of Academus.</p>
<p>And that gave us the word Academy, as well as related terms like Academic and Academia.</p>
<p>Those words ultimately came from the name of a legendary Athenian who helped the Spartans</p>
<p>recover Helen the first time she was abducted.</p>
<p>But now she was abducted again by the Trojans.</p>
<p>In that passage where Marlow referred to her as the face that launched a thousand ships,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that he referred to the topless towers of Ilium, not the topless towers of Troy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Ilium was another name for Troy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a Latin version of the original Greek terms Ilios and Ilion.</p>
<p>It was just another common term that the Greeks used for Troy, and it&rsquo;s also the source of</p>
<p>the title of Homer&rsquo;s epic poem, The Iliad.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, the Iliad covers a brief period in the final year of the Ten-Year War.</p>
<p>The conflict has turned into a stalemate.</p>
<p>The Greek ships rest on the beach below Troy as the Greek fighters are unable to pierce</p>
<p>the gates of the city.</p>
<p>The central character in the story is the Greek warrior Achilles.</p>
<p>He is the nearly unbeatable fighter who leads a contingent of Greek soldiers.</p>
<p>But the story begins with an argument between Achilles and his Mycenaean king and commander, Agamemnon.</p>
<p>After the argument, Achilles leaves the Greek army and withdraws from the war out of anger and frustration.</p>
<p>With Achilles gone, the Greek commander Agamemnon gathers his forces and offers a prayer to Zeus</p>
<p>to grant them victory against the Trojans and, in the words of the poem, to force the</p>
<p>Trojans to, quote, fall headlong into the dust, teeth biting the soil, end quote.</p>
<p>That phrase was rendered in later English translations variously as bite the ground</p>
<p>and bite the dust, and that appears to be the origin of the modern phrase bite the ground</p>
<p>or bite the dust, meaning to die.</p>
<p>With the fighting renewed, the king of Troy, named Priam, meets with Helen, and they discuss</p>
<p>the leaders of the Greek forces.</p>
<p>Priam says that he once fought against the Amazons in Phrygia, that region of Anatolia</p>
<p>east of Troy that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>But Priam says that as intimidating as the Amazons were, there were not as many of them</p>
<p>as the Greeks who had descended upon Troy.</p>
<p>And this is apparently the first recorded reference to the Amazons in written literature.</p>
<p>Greek mythology taught that the Amazons were a tribe of fierce female warriors who lived</p>
<p>in the area between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea in the region of the Indo-European</p>
<p>homeland.</p>
<p>The legends held that these female warriors had fought against the tribes of Anatolia</p>
<p>and had even invaded Greece itself.</p>
<p>So this ties into that persistent Greek concern about the warring tribes to the north which</p>
<p>we looked at earlier.</p>
<p>According to the legend of the Amazons, they met up with a tribe of men once a year, and</p>
<p>the two groups mated.</p>
<p>But any boys born to the women were either killed or sent to their fathers.</p>
<p>The legend of the Amazons was so well known that it ultimately produced the name of the</p>
<p>river in South America, at least according to the most popular etymology.</p>
<p>Supposedly, when Spanish explorers in the region encountered native tribes where the</p>
<p>women fought beside the men, the explorers likened them to the legendary Amazons, and</p>
<p>they named the river the Amazon.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Jeff Bezos was starting an online retail store, and he wanted a name for the</p>
<p>company that began with the letter A so it would be listed first in most directories.</p>
<p>Since the Amazon was generally regarded as the largest river in the world, and he wanted</p>
<p>to build the largest online retail store, he decided to call the store Amazon, which</p>
<p>is indeed one of the largest and most successful businesses of the Internet era.</p>
<p>And it all began with this earliest written reference to the Amazons in the Iliad.</p>
<p>At one point in the renewed warfare between the Greeks and the Trojans, the two armies</p>
<p>take a rest, and a soldier from each side agrees to engage in personal combat in the</p>
<p>middle of the gathered forces.</p>
<p>One of the soldiers, named Glaucus, says that he is the grandson of the warrior Bellerophon,</p>
<p>who was well known as a slayer of monsters in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Glaucus recalls that his grandfather slaughtered the Amazons, but the gods became jealous of</p>
<p>him and caused the death of two of his sons.</p>
<p>The Iliad says that he then wandered alone in the plain, eating his heart out.</p>
<p>It meant that he felt great despair or loss, but that phrase is apparently the first recorded</p>
<p>version of the modern-day phrase, eat your heart out, usually uttered by a victor to</p>
<p>someone who has experienced defeat or loss.</p>
<p>As the war continues, the Trojan forces are led by their commander, Hector.</p>
<p>Hector is a Trojan prince and the greatest of the Trojan warriors, and his name has given</p>
<p>English a common verb, to Hector, meaning to browbeat or bully or torment.</p>
<p>The modern sense of the verb is probably a little unfair to the character in the Iliad,</p>
<p>who is generally presented as a noble and honorable leader.</p>
<p>It appears that London street gangs appropriated the name of Hector in the 1600s, and they</p>
<p>began calling themselves Hectors, and that gave English the modern sense of the word</p>
<p>as browbeat or bully.</p>
<p>Now with Achilles&rsquo; withdrawal from the war, Hector takes advantage of the situation and</p>
<p>eventually drives the Greeks back to their ships.</p>
<p>In one battle, Hector manages to kill Patroclus, who was one of the leading Greek warriors</p>
<p>and Achilles&rsquo; close friend.</p>
<p>The death of Patroclus finally spurs Achilles to re-enter the war to avenge his friend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death.</p>
<p>He is warned by his mother that he will die if he tries to avenge his friend&rsquo;s death,</p>
<p>but he does so anyway.</p>
<p>Achilles returns and routs the Trojans, leading to the final confrontation between Achilles</p>
<p>and Hector.</p>
<p>During the fight, Achilles stabs Hector in the throat, killing him.</p>
<p>After the battle, the body of Achilles&rsquo; friend Patroclus is placed on a burning funeral pyre.</p>
<p>After initially disregarding the body of Hector, Achilles finally agrees to return</p>
<p>the body to Hector&rsquo;s father, the Trojan king Priam, and the Trojan commander&rsquo;s body is</p>
<p>also burned in a funeral pyre.</p>
<p>And that brings an end to the Iliad.</p>
<p>So the epic ends with Achilles still alive and the Trojan war still unresolved.</p>
<p>Of course, all the listeners or readers would have known the ultimate outcome of those events,</p>
<p>which were common knowledge to the Latter-day Greeks and which were recorded in other poems</p>
<p>in the centuries after the Iliad was composed.</p>
<p>The death of Achilles is foretold several times in the Iliad, and one popular account</p>
<p>outlined in other works of Greek mythology tells how Achilles&rsquo; mother held him by his</p>
<p>heel and dipped him into the river Styx as a child to make him immortal.</p>
<p>But that meant his heel never got wet and never acquired the same protection, and it</p>
<p>left him with that one vulnerability.</p>
<p>It was Paris, the Trojan prince who abducted Helen, who took advantage of that one weakness</p>
<p>and shot an arrow into the heel of Achilles and killed him.</p>
<p>This legendary story gave us the term Achilles&rsquo; heel to refer to a weak point.</p>
<p>It also produced the term Achilles&rsquo; tendon for the tendon that attaches to the heel bone</p>
<p>in the foot.</p>
<p>Now the Iliad also fails to address the end of the war.</p>
<p>Again, other sources fill in that part of the legend, and those sources give us the</p>
<p>very well-known story of the Trojan horse.</p>
<p>This event is also alluded to in the Odyssey, so this part of the story would have been</p>
<p>well known to all who listened to or read the Iliad.</p>
<p>According to the legend, the Greeks made it appear that they were abandoning their camp</p>
<p>and were heading back home to Greece.</p>
<p>But the Greek hero Odysseus had told them to build a hollow horse out of wood and to</p>
<p>fill it with Greek warriors.</p>
<p>The horse was left in the marketplace of Troy as a gift to the city.</p>
<p>The Trojans opened the gates of the city and brought the horse inside, whereupon the Greeks</p>
<p>jumped out and destroyed the city.</p>
<p>So it was all a trick, a grand example of subterfuge.</p>
<p>It also gave us the term Trojan horse, which refers to something that undermines an opponent</p>
<p>from within.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially common in modern English as a type of computer virus, because those viruses</p>
<p>often work the same way as the Greeks&rsquo; famous Trojan horse.</p>
<p>You might download an innocent-looking file or program, but it actually has a virus inside,</p>
<p>and once it&rsquo;s on your computer, the virus comes out and wreaks havoc.</p>
<p>So even in the modern digital era, we hearken back to this ancient story about the Trojan</p>
<p>war.</p>
<p>Now even though the Trojan horse was a clever ruse, some later writers considered it deceitful</p>
<p>and dishonest, and it tainted the Greek victory over the Trojans.</p>
<p>This helps to explain why the founding myth of Rome was based around the Trojan hero,</p>
<p>Aeneas, who survived the fall of Troy.</p>
<p>The Roman poet Virgil picked up the story of Aeneas after the end of the war in his</p>
<p>classic work known as The Aeneid, and that work contains the following line from Aeneas&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uncle, who was a priest named Laocoön.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do not trust the horse, Trojans.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That line ultimately produced the modern English proverb, &ldquo;&lsquo;Beware of Greeks bearing</p>
<p>gifts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It means, don&rsquo;t trust your enemies.</p>
<p>Now the Aeneid is the first of the two epics attributed to Homer, which cover the Trojan</p>
<p>war and its aftermath.</p>
<p>The other work is The Odyssey.</p>
<p>The Odyssey is really the story of the Greek hero, Odysseus, and his attempt to make it</p>
<p>back home to Ithaca after the war was over.</p>
<p>The title of the epic is based on the name of its main character, Odysseus, and since</p>
<p>it involved a long journey filled with adventures, it has given us the English word, Odyssey,</p>
<p>with the same meaning.</p>
<p>I should note that Odysseus is the form of the name based on the original Greek version,</p>
<p>but the name evolved slightly within Latin and English, where it was sometimes rendered</p>
<p>as Ulysses.</p>
<p>So ultimately, Odysseus and Ulysses are different versions of the same name.</p>
<p>The Odyssey is the story of Odysseus and his journey, but it&rsquo;s also the story of his family</p>
<p>back home in Ithaca, awaiting his return.</p>
<p>In fact, the story begins with his wife and son in Ithaca, a decade after the war has</p>
<p>ended.</p>
<p>Odysseus still hasn&rsquo;t returned, and it isn&rsquo;t clear if he will ever return.</p>
<p>We are told that when Odysseus first left Ithaca on his way to Troy twenty years earlier,</p>
<p>he left his son in the care of his friend, Mentor.</p>
<p>Mentor remained loyal to Odysseus, and in the story his guise is often assumed by the</p>
<p>goddess Athena.</p>
<p>Even though the character of Mentor plays a very limited role in the Odyssey, it was</p>
<p>expanded by other writers in the modern era.</p>
<p>Mentor was represented as a man who gave wise counsel, and through that association</p>
<p>the name of the character gave us the modern English word mentor, meaning an advisor or</p>
<p>counselor.</p>
<p>Now among the creatures encountered by Odysseus and his men on their journey are the sirens.</p>
<p>They are the sea nymphs that sing alluring songs which enchant and distract the sailors</p>
<p>and cause them to become shipwrecked and never want to leave.</p>
<p>Though the passage is relatively short, the sirens were very memorable characters.</p>
<p>And in the 1800s, when a Frenchman named Charles de la Tour invented a device that made a piercing</p>
<p>tone, it was soon adopted by ship captains who used it as a type of warning signal on</p>
<p>the water.</p>
<p>The distracting sound hearkened back to the distracting sound of the sirens, and even</p>
<p>though this new sound was piercing, it came to be known as a siren.</p>
<p>And it gave us the modern English word siren, which is often used today by police cars and</p>
<p>emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>Now Odysseus did eventually find his way back home to Ithaca.</p>
<p>In fact, stories about a hero&rsquo;s journey home were very popular with the Greeks.</p>
<p>So much so that they actually had a word for those types of stories.</p>
<p>A story about a homecoming was called a nostos, which literally meant a return.</p>
<p>The Greeks also had the word algos, which meant pain.</p>
<p>Later writers sometimes put those two Greek words together, nostos meaning a return or</p>
<p>homecoming and algos meaning pain.</p>
<p>It referred to the pain or longing for home.</p>
<p>It was the feeling that you had for a place that you hadn&rsquo;t seen for a while.</p>
<p>And it gave us the English word nostalgia, which means a longing for an earlier time</p>
<p>or a familiar place.</p>
<p>So as you can see, those epic stories about the Trojan War have given us lots of words</p>
<p>and phrases in modern English.</p>
<p>But those epic poems were written down long after the war was over, if the war even happened</p>
<p>at all.</p>
<p>They were written down with that brand-new Greek alphabet which appeared in the eighth</p>
<p>century B.C. and which marked the end of the Greek Dark Ages.</p>
<p>That new alphabet ushered in a period of literature and scholarship and philosophy</p>
<p>which we know today as the period of classical Greece.</p>
<p>So next time, we&rsquo;ll turn our focus to the story of literate Greece, Greece with the</p>
<p>alphabet and a written language that was available to the masses.</p>
<p>Until then, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
