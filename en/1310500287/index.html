    <p>The following is a conversation with Chris Mason,</p>
<p>professor of genomics, physiology,</p>
<p>and biophysics at Cornell.</p>
<p>He and colleagues do some of their research out in space,</p>
<p>experiments on space missions that seek to discern</p>
<p>the molecular basis of changes in the human body</p>
<p>during long-term human space travel.</p>
<p>On this topic, he also wrote an epic book</p>
<p>titled The Next 500 Years,</p>
<p>Engineering Life to Reach New Worlds</p>
<p>that boldly looks at what it takes to colonize space</p>
<p>far beyond our planet and even journey out</p>
<p>towards livable worlds beyond our solar system.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got BetterHelp for mental health,</p>
<p>Grammarly for writing, Magic Spoon for cereal,</p>
<p>Blinkist for books, and Asleep for naps.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them, please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp,</p>
<p>spelled H-E-L-P, help.</p>
<p>BetterHelp helps you figure out what you need</p>
<p>and match you with a licensed professional therapist</p>
<p>in under 48 hours.</p>
<p>I recently had a conversation with Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>brilliant psychiatrist.</p>
<p>He, at least in part, reinvigorated my curiosity,</p>
<p>maybe passion about psychiatry, about talk therapy,</p>
<p>about exploring the human mind through conversation,</p>
<p>especially when that human mind</p>
<p>has fallen off the beaten path.</p>
<p>One of the most moving things to me</p>
<p>is when folks happen to run into me in the street,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll sometimes say that, you know,</p>
<p>me talking about love and just in general,</p>
<p>having optimism about the future gave them strength,</p>
<p>but I also hear about the struggle,</p>
<p>and I see the pain, even just a few seconds of interaction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it makes me feel like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re together in this thing, you know?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re struggling, just know we&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you, brother and sister.</p>
<p>Anyway, BetterHelp is easy, private, affordable,</p>
<p>and available worldwide.</p>
<p>Check them out at betterhelp.com slash lex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s betterhelp.com slash lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Grammarly,</p>
<p>a writing assistant tool that checks spelling,</p>
<p>grammar, sentence structure, and readability.</p>
<p>Grammarly Premium, the version you pay for,</p>
<p>offers a bunch of extra features.</p>
<p>My favorite is the Clarity Check,</p>
<p>which helps detect rambling, overcomplicated chaos</p>
<p>that many of us descend into</p>
<p>in conversation, in writing, and otherwise.</p>
<p>Again, let me bring up Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>who references James Joyce quite a bit</p>
<p>in his book, Projections.</p>
<p>This is like a long ad read for Karl, who&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>He references James Joyce, the author of Ulysses,</p>
<p>considered one of the great novels of the 20th century,</p>
<p>and Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake, which is complete rambling chaos,</p>
<p>which is the kind of thing that might be good</p>
<p>for an epic novel that explores schizophrenia,</p>
<p>but it might not be good for emails,</p>
<p>and tweets, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>If you wanna not do that kind of thing,</p>
<p>Grammarly will help you, and it&rsquo;s available on any platform,</p>
<p>major sites and apps like Gmail, and Twitter, and so on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just do spell check,</p>
<p>it helps you get your point across effectively,</p>
<p>and you can do that with Grammarly Premium.</p>
<p>You can get 20% off Grammarly Premium</p>

<p>This episode is brought to you by Magic Spoon,</p>
<p>low-carb, keto-friendly cereal.</p>
<p>It has zero grams of sugar, 13 to 40 grams of protein,</p>
<p>only four net grams of carbs,</p>
<p>and 140 calories in each serving.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m having way too much fun doing these at-reads.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re much less about whatever the product is,</p>
<p>and much more about me just talking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like personal therapy by myself,</p>
<p>but also with my friends.</p>
<p>Back to Magic Spoon.</p>
<p>You can build your own box,</p>
<p>and get a variety pack with available flavors,</p>
<p>cocoa, fruity, frosted, peanut butter,</p>
<p>blueberry, and cinnamon,</p>
<p>but I return time and time and time again to cocoa.</p>
<p>The flavor of champions.</p>
<p>It reminds me of childhood, it reminds me of happiness,</p>
<p>but it just reminds me of that joy of morning cereal,</p>
<p>without the deeply unhealthy, excessive amounts of sugar.</p>
<p>Anyway, Magic Spoon have a 100% happiness guarantee.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re back to happiness.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it, they refund it.</p>

<p>This show is brought to you by Blinkist,</p>
<p>my favorite app for learning new things.</p>
<p>Blinkist takes the key ideas</p>
<p>from thousands of nonfiction books,</p>
<p>and condenses them down to just 15 minutes</p>
<p>that you can read or listen to.</p>
<p>I can recommend a ton of books,</p>
<p>Sapiens, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius,</p>
<p>Beginning of Infinity by David Doitch,</p>
<p>Snowden Book, and so on.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe, I have to check again,</p>
<p>but they have a lot of the most important,</p>
<p>most impactful nonfiction books ever written.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the time to read all of them,</p>
<p>which nobody does,</p>
<p>you should definitely use Blinkist</p>
<p>to catch up on the ones</p>
<p>that are not at the top of your stack to read.</p>
<p>I use it both to summarize books I&rsquo;ll never read,</p>
<p>but also to summarize books I&rsquo;ve already read</p>
<p>to remind myself to the key insights.</p>
<p>You can go to Blinkist.com slash Lex</p>
<p>to start your free seven day trial</p>
<p>and get 25% off of a Blinkist premium membership</p>
<p>as Blinkist.com slash Lex,</p>

<p>It controls temperature with an app,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s packed with sensors,</p>
<p>it can cool down to as low as 55 degrees</p>
<p>on each side of the bed separately.</p>
<p>There are very few things in life, my friends,</p>
<p>that are as pleasant as a good power nap.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll even drink a coffee beforehand,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know how that works.</p>
<p>Andrew Huberman probably knows how that works,</p>
<p>but it works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll drink a coffee and I&rsquo;ll just pass out.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes I pass out on the floor and that also works,</p>
<p>but if I want to really enjoy the power nap,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just about function, it&rsquo;s about happiness,</p>
<p>and if I want to enjoy happiness,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing better than a cool bed</p>
<p>with a warm blanket for 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes,</p>
<p>and then I wake up 100% refreshed.</p>
<p>I do that because I&rsquo;m in a Eight Sleep Pod Pro cover</p>
<p>that you can add to your mattress.</p>

<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Chris Mason.</p>
<p>You wrote a book called</p>
<p>The Next 500 Years Engineering Life to Reach New Worlds,</p>
<p>and you dedicated to, quote,</p>
<p>to all humans and any extinction-aware sentience.</p>
<p>How fundamental is awareness of death</p>
<p>to the understanding of the existence of life?</p>
<p>And how does it relate to the human condition?</p>
<p>Aware sentience.</p>
<p>How fundamental is awareness of death and extinction</p>
<p>to the human condition?</p>
<p>I think this is actually one of the most</p>
<p>human-specific traits and features that we have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually maybe one of the few things</p>
<p>that only we have and no one else has.</p>
<p>So it sounds scary.</p>
<p>It sounds like what people often don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>to think about their death,</p>
<p>except now and again, or at funerals,</p>
<p>or to recognize their mortality.</p>
<p>But if you do it at a species-wide level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that is actually</p>
<p>an exemplary human-specific trait that you&rsquo;re exhibiting.</p>
<p>You think about something that is the loss</p>
<p>of not just your life, or your family,</p>
<p>or everyone you see, but everyone like you.</p>
<p>And that is, I dedicated it because I think</p>
<p>we might not be the last sentience to have this awareness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually hoping we&rsquo;ll just be the first.</p>
<p>But as far as we know, we&rsquo;re the only.</p>
<p>And I think this is the,</p>
<p>part of the moral thrust for the book</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re the only ones that have this awareness.</p>
<p>That gives us a duty that only we can exercise so far.</p>
<p>So we definitely contemplate our own mortality</p>
<p>at the individual level.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>When you wrote it, it was really powerful to realize,</p>
<p>for me, that we do contemplate our extinction.</p>
<p>And that is a creative force.</p>
<p>So at the individual level,</p>
<p>contemplating your own death is a creative force.</p>
<p>Like I have a deadline.</p>
<p>But contemplating the extinction of the whole species,</p>
<p>I suppose that stretches through human history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s many of the sort of subtext of religious ideas</p>
<p>is that like, if we screw this up, it&rsquo;s gonna be over.</p>
<p>And revelation, and every religious text</p>
<p>has some view of either the birth or the death</p>
<p>of the world as they know it.</p>
<p>But it was very abstract.</p>
<p>It was fiction, almost, or in some cases,</p>
<p>complete fiction of what you hope or think might happen.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s become much more quantified and much more real,</p>
<p>I think, in the past several hundred years,</p>
<p>and especially in the past few decades,</p>
<p>where we can see a sense of responsibility</p>
<p>at a planetary scale.</p>
<p>So when we think about, say, terraforming Mars,</p>
<p>that would just be the second planet we&rsquo;ve engineered</p>
<p>at a planetary scale.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already doing it for this one, just not that well.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like a bunch of ants.</p>
<p>Extinction-aware sentience ants that are busy</p>
<p>trying to terraform this planet to make it habitable</p>
<p>so it can flourish.</p>
<p>And then you say that it&rsquo;s our duty to expand beyond Earth,</p>
<p>to expand to other planets, to find a good backup,</p>
<p>off-site backup solution.</p>
<p>Why the word duty?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting word.</p>
<p>Duty is something that usually puts people to sleep,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this.</p>
<p>So duty is a bit like death.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t often like to really think,</p>
<p>wake up in the morning and think,</p>
<p>what is my duty today?</p>
<p>Most people.</p>
<p>There are some people that think about it every day.</p>
<p>People in active military service wake up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very concrete sense of duty to country.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can think about it, though,</p>
<p>in terms of family.</p>
<p>You feel a duty towards your spouse, your kids,</p>
<p>your parents.</p>
<p>You feel a real duty to them</p>
<p>because you want them to flourish and to be safe.</p>
<p>So we do have this sense of duty,</p>
<p>but very much like death,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think about it actively.</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s something that just becomes embedded</p>
<p>in your day-to-day existence.</p>
<p>But I think about duty because people think about duties</p>
<p>for themselves, but there has never been a real</p>
<p>overarching duty that we all feel as a species</p>
<p>for each other and for generations</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t yet been born.</p>
<p>And I think I want people to have a sense of the same love</p>
<p>and compassion and fighting even to the tooth and nail,</p>
<p>whether the way you protect your family,</p>
<p>the way you&rsquo;d fight for a country, for example,</p>
<p>to feel the same way towards the rarity</p>
<p>and preciousness of life and feel that sense of duty</p>
<p>towards particularly extinction-aware life,</p>
<p>which is just us so far.</p>
<p>This ability that we have this awareness</p>
<p>of not only our own frailty,</p>
<p>which of course is often talked about in climate change</p>
<p>and people think about pandemics,</p>
<p>but other species that we&rsquo;ve sometimes caused extinction,</p>
<p>but very soon will be even de-extinctifying species</p>
<p>like the woolly mammoth colossus,</p>
<p>a recent startup that&rsquo;s doing that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on their advisory board,</p>
<p>and it might happen in three or four years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting point in history</p>
<p>where we can actually think about preventing death</p>
<p>at a species-wide level and even resurrecting things</p>
<p>that we have killed or that have gone away,</p>
<p>which brings its own series of questions</p>
<p>of just as when you delete something from an ecosystem,</p>
<p>adding something can be completely catastrophic.</p>
<p>And so there are no real guidelines yet on how to do that,</p>
<p>but the technology now exists, which is pretty extraordinary.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve just been working on backup</p>
<p>and restoring databases quite a bit recently,</p>
<p>and you can do quite a lot of damage</p>
<p>when you restore improperly.</p>
<p>So when we bring back the mammoths,</p>
<p>it might be, you have to be careful bringing that back.</p>
<p>The best of science, the best of engineering</p>
<p>is both dangerous and exciting,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you have to have the best people,</p>
<p>but also the most morally grounded people</p>
<p>pushing us forward.</p>
<p>But on the point of duty, there&rsquo;s a kind of sense</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something special to humanity,</p>
<p>to human beings that we want to preserve,</p>
<p>and if that little flame, whatever that is, dies,</p>
<p>that will be a real shame for the universe.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What is special about human beings?</p>
<p>What is special about the human condition</p>
<p>that we want to preserve?</p>
<p>Why do we matter?</p>
<p>There are some people who think we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There are some people who say,</p>
<p>well, humans, take it or leave it.</p>
<p>They think they&rsquo;re misanthropes,</p>
<p>so the book is, on the one sense, a call to misanthropes</p>
<p>to hopefully shake them out of their slumber,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some people-</p>
<p>What does the word misanthrope mean?</p>
<p>Just people that dislike humanity there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, again, they&rsquo;re all just-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called nihilists, Donny.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a shout-out for Bigelow fans.</p>
<p>People, they&rsquo;re like, nothing matters,</p>
<p>and they just apply it more particularly to humans,</p>
<p>but there are endless reasons, I think,</p>
<p>to cherish and celebrate what humans have done.</p>
<p>At the same time, many things we&rsquo;ve done awfully,</p>
<p>and genocide, and nuclear weapons testing</p>
<p>on unsuspecting citizens in the remote islands.</p>
<p>There are definitely things we&rsquo;ve done bad,</p>
<p>but the poetry, the music, the engineering feats,</p>
<p>the getting to the moon, and eventually rovers on Mars,</p>
<p>these extraordinary feats</p>
<p>that humans have already accomplished,</p>
<p>and just a sense of beauty, I think,</p>
<p>is something that is-</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t ask ants or cockroaches</p>
<p>about their favorite paintings,</p>
<p>or maybe if you could,</p>
<p>it would be very different from ours,</p>
<p>but in either case, there&rsquo;s a unique perspective</p>
<p>that we carry, and I think-</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something, even just the age-old question,</p>
<p>in biology, I&rsquo;m a geneticist,</p>
<p>so this comes up a lot of what makes humans unique,</p>
<p>and so is it bipedalism?</p>
<p>Is it our intelligence?</p>
<p>Is it tool-making?</p>
<p>Is it language?</p>
<p>All those things I just listed,</p>
<p>other species have some degree of those traits,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a question of degree, not of type, of trait</p>
<p>that defines humans a little bit,</p>
<p>but I think for the extinction awareness,</p>
<p>that is a uniquely human trait,</p>
<p>that is, to our knowledge, no other species,</p>
<p>or entity, or AI, or sentience</p>
<p>that carries that awareness of the frailty of life,</p>
<p>of our own life, but all life.</p>
<p>Maybe it is that awareness of the frailty of life</p>
<p>that allows us to be so urgently creative,</p>
<p>create beauty, create innovation.</p>
<p>It just seems like, if you just measure,</p>
<p>humans are able to create</p>
<p>some sort of subjectively beautiful things,</p>
<p>and I see science that way, I see engineering that way,</p>
<p>and ants are less efficient at that.</p>
<p>They also create beautiful things,</p>
<p>but less aggressively, less innovation,</p>
<p>less building, like standing on the shoulders of giants,</p>
<p>building on top of each other, over, and over, and over,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re getting these hierarchical systems,</p>
<p>where you create on greater levels of abstraction,</p>
<p>then you use ideas to communicate those ideas,</p>
<p>and you share those ideas, and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you have the rockets going out into space.</p>
<p>Which ants have been building the same structures</p>
<p>for millions and millions of years with no real change,</p>
<p>and so that is the key differentiator.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>Yet, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got an experiment going right now,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;ll change, but.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, we will bring up some extreme organisms.</p>
<p>Another thing you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that comes up much later in your book</p>
<p>is something I also haven&rsquo;t thought of,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite inspiring,</p>
<p>which is the heat death in the universe</p>
<p>is something worth fighting against.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also an engineering problem.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, you seriously look at the next 500 years,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s such a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Seriously, we&rsquo;ll talk about the uncertainty</p>
<p>involved with that, and all the different trajectories,</p>
<p>but to seriously look at that,</p>
<p>and then to seriously look at what happens</p>
<p>when the sun runs out,</p>
<p>what happens when the universe comes to an end.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity and a kind of duty,</p>
<p>like you said, to fight against that,</p>
<p>and that was so inspiring to me to think,</p>
<p>wait, maybe we&rsquo;ll actually,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a worthy thing to think about.</p>
<p>Maybe we can prevent it, actually.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Come up with the best known understanding,</p>
<p>current, of how things end.</p>
<p>We kind of are building an intuition,</p>
<p>and data, and models of the way the universe is,</p>
<p>the way it started, the way it&rsquo;s going to end.</p>
<p>So our best model of the end,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start thinking about how that could be prevented,</p>
<p>how that could be avoided,</p>
<p>how that could be channeled and misdirected,</p>
<p>and you can pivot it somehow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really inspiring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>I never really thought about it.</p>
<p>Eventually, all things end,</p>
<p>and that was the kind of melancholic notion</p>
<p>behind all of it.</p>
<p>None of this matters, in a way.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s also inspiring to enjoy the moment,</p>
<p>to really live in the moment,</p>
<p>because that is truly where beauty exists,</p>
<p>is in the moment.</p>
<p>But there is a long-lasting aspect to beauty</p>
<p>that is part of the engineering ethic,</p>
<p>which is like, tell me what the problem is,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to solve it.</p>
<p>So what do you think about that,</p>
<p>the long scale, beyond 500 years?</p>
<p>Do humans have a chance?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think we have the best chance of any species,</p>
<p>and actually the best chance that humanity&rsquo;s ever had.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of people fear that we can</p>
<p>or will kill ourselves.</p>
<p>Actually, my favorite question I ask</p>
<p>at the end of every interview</p>
<p>for every potential graduate student,</p>
<p>medical student, faculty,</p>
<p>whoever I&rsquo;m interviewing, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>their last question is,</p>
<p>well, how long do you think that humans</p>
<p>or our evolutionary derivatives will last?</p>
<p>And the answers are shockingly wide-ranging.</p>
<p>Some people say, I think we&rsquo;ve only got 100 years left.</p>
<p>Or some people say billions.</p>
<p>Some people say as long as the universe lasts.</p>
<p>But the person who once said,</p>
<p>it was a medical student, applicant,</p>
<p>who said, I think we&rsquo;ve only got 100 years left.</p>
<p>And I was like, really, for all of humanity,</p>
<p>everything will be gone in 100 years?</p>
<p>And he said, yes.</p>
<p>And I said, well, sweet Jesus, man, why go to med school?</p>
<p>Why not go sell bananas on the beach?</p>
<p>And then he said, I really wanna make</p>
<p>the last few hundred years count really matter.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, well, that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>kind of, sort of hopeful in a really dark way.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;ve never been better situated</p>
<p>to actually last for the long term.</p>
<p>We have, even though we&rsquo;ve also never been</p>
<p>at the greater risk of being able to destroy ourselves</p>
<p>ever since really the first nuclear test,</p>
<p>when they, Tony Orb has a great book</p>
<p>about this called The Precipice,</p>
<p>where The Precipice for Humanity is</p>
<p>at one point we made technologies</p>
<p>that we weren&rsquo;t sure whether or not</p>
<p>they would destroy the Earth or the entire universe.</p>
<p>So the math was incomplete and there was too much error,</p>
<p>but they tested the bomb anyway.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an extraordinary place as a species to think,</p>
<p>we now have something in our hands</p>
<p>that may destroy the Earth and possibly a chain reaction</p>
<p>that destroys the whole universe.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try it anyway as a stage that we&rsquo;re at as a species.</p>
<p>But with that power comes an ability</p>
<p>to get to other planets to survive long term.</p>
<p>And when you think about the heat death,</p>
<p>that just becomes, that&rsquo;s an ad infinitum question.</p>
<p>If you keep thinking, well, we survive,</p>
<p>we go to the next sun and then you go to the next sun,</p>
<p>eventually the question will be,</p>
<p>well, if you just keep doing that forever,</p>
<p>at some point the universe either continues to expand</p>
<p>or it could collapse back in itself.</p>
<p>And the heat death is more likely at this point</p>
<p>where it just keeps expanding and expanding,</p>
<p>everything is too far away.</p>
<p>But even in that case,</p>
<p>I think if we had a fundamental knowledge of physics</p>
<p>and space time that you could try and restructure it</p>
<p>quite literally the shape of the universe to prevent it,</p>
<p>I think we would, I think we would wanna survive.</p>
<p>I think, unless we had done the math</p>
<p>and we think that there&rsquo;s a greater chance</p>
<p>that the next universe would form and make more life,</p>
<p>maybe we would, but even then,</p>
<p>I think humans have always wanted to survive</p>
<p>and you could argue maybe should survive because.</p>
<p>And are able to engineer systems that help us survive.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and always have, yeah.</p>
<p>So what is this though, the Tsar bomb?</p>
<p>Yeah, the hydrogen.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s nothing more terrifying</p>
<p>and somehow inspiring than watching</p>
<p>the mushroom cloud of a nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like humans are capable of this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re capable of leveraging the power of nature.</p>
<p>To completely obliterate everything.</p>
<p>And to create propulsion.</p>
<p>I mean, most of the Voyager spacecraft are nuclear powered</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s still in many ways the most efficient way</p>
<p>to get a tiny amount of fissile material</p>
<p>and make power out of it.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re still slowly drifting their path to heliosphere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out now into interstellar space</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re nuclear powered.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like any tool or technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool or a weapon depending on how you hold it.</p>
<p>Are we alone in the universe, Chris Mason?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>So the presumption that you&rsquo;ve just mentioned</p>
<p>is let&rsquo;s just focus on our thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, for now.</p>
<p>Well, I think we, as far as we know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no other sentient life out in the universe</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve found yet.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s probably bacteria life out there</p>
<p>just because we found it everywhere we&rsquo;ve looked on Earth.</p>
<p>It is, and there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>halophilic organisms that can survive in extreme salts.</p>
<p>There are cyclophiles that in extreme cold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you know, basically organisms that can survive</p>
<p>in really almost any possible environment</p>
<p>that can adapt and find a way to live.</p>
<p>But as far as we know, we&rsquo;re the only sentient ones.</p>
<p>And I think this is the famous, the Drake equation,</p>
<p>or, you know, how many, where is everyone?</p>
<p>Is that what Enrico Fermi said?</p>
<p>Is that, why haven&rsquo;t we heard from anyone</p>
<p>if there are these other life forms?</p>
<p>I actually think the question is wrong</p>
<p>to phrase it that way because the Earth</p>
<p>has only been here for 4.5 billion years.</p>
<p>And, you know, life may be only for a few billion</p>
<p>of those years, complex life only for several hundred years,</p>
<p>hundred million years of life we&rsquo;ve actually had,</p>
<p>you know, and humans only the past few million years</p>
<p>since our last common ancestor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that much time.</p>
<p>But if you think even further back,</p>
<p>the universe hasn&rsquo;t had that much time itself</p>
<p>to cool and create atoms and have them spread</p>
<p>around the universe, right?</p>
<p>So the current estimate&rsquo;s 13.8 billion years</p>
<p>of just the whole universe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been the first five or six</p>
<p>of those billion years really just like cooling</p>
<p>and making enough of the stars to then make the atoms</p>
<p>that would come from supernovas.</p>
<p>So I actually think we might be the first</p>
<p>or one of the very few or one of the early life forms,</p>
<p>but the universe itself hasn&rsquo;t had that much time</p>
<p>to make life in a galactic and universal timeframe.</p>
<p>You needed billions of years for the elements</p>
<p>to be created and then distributed.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re only really in the, I think,</p>
<p>the last few billion years where I think even life</p>
<p>could have been made.</p>
<p>So I think the question of where is everyone</p>
<p>is the wrong question.</p>
<p>I think the question is, I think we are the first ones</p>
<p>at the party, let&rsquo;s set up the liquor,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s set up the food.</p>
<p>I just think we&rsquo;re the first ones at the party of life,</p>
<p>but more people are coming.</p>
<p>One of the early attendees to the party.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe as far as we know, the first,</p>
<p>but maybe we&rsquo;ll find someone.</p>
<p>In the local pocket of the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because the parties then expand and it overflows.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, and then there&rsquo;s a mosh pit</p>
<p>and then you bump into the other galaxy.</p>
<p>I think the question should be when else</p>
<p>is everyone getting here instead of where is everyone?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve just started on the genesis of life</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, so not where you have they or not,</p>
<p>more about when and who and how do we set up the party.</p>
<p>Right, and then how do we help them?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an interesting other moral question</p>
<p>is do we, a lot of Star Trek episodes,</p>
<p>the prime directive is you do not interfere</p>
<p>with another planet if you could pass by a planet.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time to also revisit that</p>
<p>because what if you go by a planet</p>
<p>and we think that with, as far as we can tell,</p>
<p>enough certainty that they would never be able</p>
<p>to leave their planet and then the sun eventually</p>
<p>would engulf that planet, wherever that planet might be</p>
<p>in some solar system.</p>
<p>But if we had a way to help them, their culture,</p>
<p>their science, their technology,</p>
<p>everything about a different species to survive,</p>
<p>would we not interfere?</p>
<p>I think that would actually be wrong to say,</p>
<p>well, we can save this life here and we decide not to.</p>
<p>We decide after millions and billions of years pass</p>
<p>and we know the sun will engulf that planet,</p>
<p>like what will happen with our planet?</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t interfere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s watching a train hit someone on the tracks</p>
<p>and not moving the train, so.</p>
<p>In terms of the effort of humans becoming</p>
<p>a multi-planetary species, in terms of priorities,</p>
<p>how much would you allocate to trying to make contact</p>
<p>with aliens and getting their help?</p>
<p>And if we look at the next 500 and beyond years,</p>
<p>and just versus option number two,</p>
<p>really just focusing on setting up the party</p>
<p>on our own engineering, on our own,</p>
<p>the genome, the biology of humanity,</p>
<p>the AI collaborating with humans,</p>
<p>just all the engineering challenges</p>
<p>and opportunities that we&rsquo;re exploring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focused in my lab, of course,</p>
<p>a lot on the engineering of genomes,</p>
<p>the monitoring of astronauts during long missions.</p>
<p>Reaching out to other aliens,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been doing reach out to aliens</p>
<p>since the first radio wave&rsquo;s been broadcast,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re doing some of it, but to do a real.</p>
<p>You made it sound like your lab</p>
<p>is mostly focused on biology,</p>
<p>but you also reach out occasionally to aliens.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when they visit, they bring their whiskey</p>
<p>and we have a drink, but I think we can do,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been broadcasting into space for,</p>
<p>at this point, almost a century, getting close to,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not been structured,</p>
<p>so I think it&rsquo;s very cheap and easy</p>
<p>to send out structured messages,</p>
<p>like what Carl Sagan wrote about in Contact,</p>
<p>doing prime numbers and sending those out</p>
<p>to indicate intelligence.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s things we can do that I think</p>
<p>are very cheap and very easy,</p>
<p>so we should do some of that.</p>
<p>We can walk in, chew gum at the same time.</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest critiques</p>
<p>people often say of space research</p>
<p>and even space flight in general,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s too expensive, shouldn&rsquo;t we solve poverty,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t we cure diseases,</p>
<p>and the answer&rsquo;s always, as it always has been,</p>
<p>is that you can walk and chew gum at the same time.</p>
<p>You can pass the Civil Rights Act</p>
<p>and go to the moon in the same decade.</p>
<p>You can improve and get rid of structural inequality</p>
<p>while getting to the moon and Mars in this decade,</p>
<p>so I think we can do both.</p>
<p>Yeah, they kinda help each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sometimes criticism of ridiculous science,</p>
<p>like studying penguins or something,</p>
<p>or studying the patterns of birds or fish and so on.</p>
<p>Some congressman stands up and says,</p>
<p>this is a waste of taxpayer dollars,</p>
<p>and then someone says, oh, but we,</p>
<p>and for example, CRISPR was pure research for 25 years.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a household word,</p>
<p>and students are editing genomes in high school,</p>
<p>but it was just pure research on weird bacteria</p>
<p>living actually in salt, hypersaline lakes and rivers</p>
<p>for decades, and then eventually</p>
<p>became a massive therapeutic,</p>
<p>which has led to curing of diseases in this past year.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s stuff that you discover</p>
<p>as part of the research that you didn&rsquo;t anticipate</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with the actual research,</p>
<p>like oceanography is one of the interesting things</p>
<p>about that whole field is that it&rsquo;s a huge amount of data,</p>
<p>neuroscience too, actually,</p>
<p>so you could discover computer science things,</p>
<p>like machine learning things,</p>
<p>or even data storage manipulation,</p>
<p>distributed compute things by forcing yourself</p>
<p>to get something done on the oceanography side.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you invent the internet</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So to me, aliens, looking for aliens</p>
<p>out there in the universe is a motivator</p>
<p>that just inspires, inspires everybody,</p>
<p>young people, old people, scientists, artists,</p>
<p>engineers, entrepreneurs, everybody.</p>
<p>Somehow, that line between fear and beauty,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>Aliens are like perfectly merged, basically.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, for you, let&rsquo;s start talking</p>
<p>about primitive alien life.</p>
<p>Are you excited by it, or are you terrified?</p>
<p>I want to make a lotion out of it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be great if it&rsquo;s alien life,</p>
<p>assuming it&rsquo;s safe, but I&rsquo;m very excited.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a lotion.</p>
<p>You just said a half sentence, assuming it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental question I&rsquo;m trying to get at.</p>
<p>If you could, yeah, presuming it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, we have this,</p>
<p>this beginning of some planetary protection</p>
<p>is happening now, is we&rsquo;re gonna send,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing rocks back from Mars in 2033,</p>
<p>if all goes according to plan.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always a danger.</p>
<p>What if you bring this back?</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s alive?</p>
<p>What if it will kill all of humanity?</p>
<p>Or Michael Crichton wrote a book,</p>
<p>The Andromeda Strain, about this very idea.</p>
<p>And it could, but it hopefully won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the only way you can really gauge that</p>
<p>is the same way we do with any infectious agent</p>
<p>here on Earth, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new pathogen, a new organism.</p>
<p>You do it slowly, carefully.</p>
<p>You often do it with levels of containment.</p>
<p>So, you know, and it&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>probably have to be where some pioneers go</p>
<p>and would be, for example, on Mars,</p>
<p>there might be other organisms there</p>
<p>that only get activated once there&rsquo;s an ambient temperature</p>
<p>and more humidity.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, the first settlers on Mars</p>
<p>are encountering a strange new fungus</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s not even like a fungus,</p>
<p>because it might be a different clade of life,</p>
<p>different branch of life, and could be very dangerous.</p>
<p>Or it could be very inert.</p>
<p>I mean, most of life on Earth is not really dangerous</p>
<p>or harmful, let me go back on this.</p>
<p>Most of life on Earth is neither harmful</p>
<p>nor beneficial to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re making its own way in the universe,</p>
<p>just trying to survive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when, you know, it&rsquo;s inside of you</p>
<p>and replicating yourselves and destroying yourselves</p>
<p>like a virus, like COVID, XRCV2,</p>
<p>that it becomes a big problem, of course.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, you know, just doesn&rsquo;t really have agency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just trying to get by.</p>
<p>And so, for example, most of the bacteria</p>
<p>on the table, on your skin, in the subway,</p>
<p>are pretty inert.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, you know, people hanging around for the ride.</p>
<p>And actually, just because we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>so much trash about viruses,</p>
<p>most viruses are, don&rsquo;t bother humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re phages.</p>
<p>Almost all, the vast majority of viruses are phages.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this battle in biology that is really dorky,</p>
<p>is that bacteria think that they&rsquo;re the most,</p>
<p>you know, people who study bacteria</p>
<p>think the bacteria are the most important,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s trillions and trillions of them.</p>
<p>They run a lot of our own biology in our body.</p>
<p>But then people who study phages, they say,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s 10 times more phages than the bacteria,</p>
<p>which can attack the bacteria and destroy them as well.</p>
<p>So, phage people think that they run the world.</p>
<p>But we need them both.</p>
<p>What do you think about viruses?</p>
<p>So, because you said alien organisms.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t we encounter something like bacteria,</p>
<p>something like viruses, as the first alien life form?</p>
<p>Are they, first of all, are viruses alive or not?</p>
<p>So, by the book definition,</p>
<p>if you pick up a biology textbook,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d say, technically, no,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have the ability</p>
<p>to self-replicate independently.</p>
<p>But I would think, if you restructure</p>
<p>how you view what life is,</p>
<p>as far as autonomously aggregating</p>
<p>and replicating of information.</p>
<p>For example, AI, at some point,</p>
<p>what if there&rsquo;s an AI platform that we could consider alive?</p>
<p>Like, at what point would you allow it to say it&rsquo;s alive?</p>
<p>And I think we have the same definitional challenge there,</p>
<p>is that if it can continually propagate instructions</p>
<p>for its own existence, then it is a version of living.</p>
<p>I think viruses don&rsquo;t get that category</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t do it on their own.</p>
<p>But they are a version of life, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>but probably not alive.</p>
<p>Well, they are expressing themselves</p>
<p>and doing so, on occasion,</p>
<p>quite powerfully in human civilization.</p>
<p>So, like you said, at which point</p>
<p>are AI systems allowed to say?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re life, we are.</p>
<p>Allowed.</p>
<p>Humans must allow them.</p>
<p>And the viruses didn&rsquo;t ask for permission</p>
<p>to express themselves to humans,</p>
<p>they just kinda did.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to allow them.</p>
<p>Are they, overall, though, exciting or terrifying to you,</p>
<p>as somebody who has studied viruses?</p>
<p>Well, whenever given two options,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always two more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you do both or neither.</p>
<p>So, here, I&rsquo;ll say they&rsquo;re both terrifying and exciting,</p>
<p>I think, to me.</p>
<p>More exciting than terrifying, I think,</p>
<p>if I had to make that sandwich,</p>
<p>and how many layers are meat versus cheese.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more cheese of excitement.</p>
<p>And meat is the fear, apparently,</p>
<p>in this metaphor, apparently.</p>
<p>In the sandwich.</p>
<p>Well, I love both, so it&rsquo;s a hell of a delicious sandwich.</p>
<p>You quote President Dwight D. Eisenhower in your book,</p>
<p>quote, plans are useless, but planning is essential.</p>
<p>And you provide a thought experiment</p>
<p>called Entropy Goggles.</p>
<p>Can you describe this thought experiment?</p>
<p>Happily, I do this almost every day,</p>
<p>somewhere, when I&rsquo;m sitting in a given room, I will,</p>
<p>well, a quick comment about that quote, actually,</p>
<p>for all the NASA planning meetings</p>
<p>for the twin study and other missions,</p>
<p>that was often the quote that goes put up on the wall</p>
<p>before we&rsquo;d sit down for the day to plan the mission.</p>
<p>It was that quote, which I thought was.</p>
<p>Plans are useless.</p>
<p>But planning is essential, which I thought was hilarious</p>
<p>for an official NASA meeting.</p>
<p>But it was because you need to have a plan,</p>
<p>but you have to know that plan might change.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s just a quick context</p>
<p>for that quote.</p>
<p>Craig Kundro, who&rsquo;s a leader at NASA&rsquo;s headquarters now,</p>
<p>would always put that first slide up,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, hmm, this meeting&rsquo;s either gonna go</p>
<p>really well or really bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s about to happen.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an inspiring quote because it&rsquo;s very true.</p>
<p>In any case, the Entropy Goggles is a thought experiment</p>
<p>I detail in my book, which is,</p>
<p>if you just sit in a room, any room, wherever you are,</p>
<p>and imagine what it will look like in 10 years,</p>
<p>100 years, 500 years, or even thousands of years,</p>
<p>it is a wonderfully terrifying and exciting exercise.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s definitely both.</p>
<p>Because you realize the transience of everything.</p>
<p>You think of what might survive.</p>
<p>Almost everything that you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>will probably not be there in hundreds of years.</p>
<p>It will be, at the very least, degraded,</p>
<p>or it might be changed, altered,</p>
<p>completely different, moved.</p>
<p>It is just, and it&rsquo;s that trait, though, of humans,</p>
<p>to just sit there and project into the future,</p>
<p>easily, really seamlessly,</p>
<p>with whatever you were doing previously,</p>
<p>is powerful because it shows what can change</p>
<p>and what should change, in some cases,</p>
<p>but also that, left to its own devices,</p>
<p>the universe would, Entropy would come take over,</p>
<p>and really, things would decay.</p>
<p>Things would be destroyed.</p>
<p>But the only thing really preventing,</p>
<p>I think, some of the Entropy is humans,</p>
<p>these sort of sentient creatures</p>
<p>that are aware of extinction, like ourselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really one of the only forces in the universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s counteracting the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Entropy that&rsquo;s always increasing.</p>
<p>Technically, we&rsquo;re actually still increasing it</p>
<p>because we emit heat,</p>
<p>and we never have perfect capture of all of energy,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re the only things really actively</p>
<p>and consciously resisting it.</p>
<p>Really, you could say life in general does this.</p>
<p>Ants do this when they build their big homes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re rearranging the universe</p>
<p>to make a nice place for themselves,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re counteracting Entropy.</p>
<p>But we could actually do it in a way</p>
<p>that would be at a large scale and for long-term.</p>
<p>So, but the Entropy Goggles is just a way to realize</p>
<p>how transient everything is,</p>
<p>and just imagine everything that will decay or change</p>
<p>in the room around you.</p>
<p>So, anyone listening, if they&rsquo;re listening on a train</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re driving in their car,</p>
<p>or if someone is listening right now,</p>
<p>looking around, everything can and will change.</p>
<p>And so you, but then, at first, it&rsquo;s terrifying</p>
<p>to see that, oh my gosh, everything will decay and go away.</p>
<p>But then, I think it&rsquo;s actually liberating to think,</p>
<p>wait, I can affect this, I can prevent it,</p>
<p>or I can affect it, or I can improve the change</p>
<p>that may occur all by itself, say, naturally.</p>
<p>And so I think it is, but it is that awareness,</p>
<p>again, of the frailty of life,</p>
<p>the ever-insistence in increasing Entropy</p>
<p>that you can address, though.</p>
<p>Actually, I say the same thing</p>
<p>to first-year medical students.</p>
<p>I teach them genetics.</p>
<p>I say, I point early in the course,</p>
<p>I say, here&rsquo;s all these charts</p>
<p>of how the human body decays over time.</p>
<p>And I call it the inexorable march</p>
<p>towards molecular oblivion,</p>
<p>which the students often find, they kind of laugh at,</p>
<p>oh, because on all the charts, they&rsquo;re 22 years old,</p>
<p>but older people do not laugh as much</p>
<p>at the thought of molecular oblivion,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all marching towards it to a large degree.</p>
<p>So this is both a great thought experiment</p>
<p>for the environment around you,</p>
<p>so just looking at all the objects around you,</p>
<p>that they will dissipate, they will disappear with time.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s also the thing you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is how can I affect any of the world?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re one little creature,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like your life is kind of,</p>
<p>you get dropped into this ocean,</p>
<p>and you make a little splash.</p>
<p>And how do I make it so the splash</p>
<p>lasts for a little bit longer?</p>
<p>Because it ultimately will,</p>
<p>I suppose the wave will continue indefinitely,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll be such a small impact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost indetectable.</p>
<p>And so how do I have that impact at all?</p>
<p>On so many levels, I get to experience this as a human.</p>
<p>Like, I recently had my cold storage hacked</p>
<p>to where it was locked, essentially.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t hacked, it was locked.</p>
<p>And so you get to lose all your data.</p>
<p>So for example, if you lose all your data,</p>
<p>if you lose all your online presence,</p>
<p>your social media, your emails,</p>
<p>if you, like, think of all the things you could lose.</p>
<p>In a fire, there&rsquo;s been a lot of fires in the United States.</p>
<p>If you lose your home,</p>
<p>and it makes you realize, wait a minute,</p>
<p>this is exactly a nice simulation</p>
<p>of what will happen anyway, eventually.</p>
<p>And that eventually comes pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And so it allows you to focus on,</p>
<p>how can I actually affect, what matters, what lasts?</p>
<p>And what brings me joy?</p>
<p>I suppose that the ultimate answer is nothing lasts.</p>
<p>So you have to focus on the things in the moment</p>
<p>that bring you joy,</p>
<p>and that have a positive impact on those around you.</p>
<p>That focusing on something that&rsquo;s long-lasting is perhaps,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s complicated, right?</p>
<p>Because like,</p>
<p>well, it used to be foolhardy to say,</p>
<p>I want to think,</p>
<p>legacy is often what people think of</p>
<p>as they approach the end of their life.</p>
<p>What is my legacy?</p>
<p>What have I done?</p>
<p>Even younger in life.</p>
<p>But it used to be really foolhardy</p>
<p>to say I could affect something.</p>
<p>People would build a building,</p>
<p>architects would say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put my name on this building,</p>
<p>and there I&rsquo;ll have some sense of immortality.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a fleeting dream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you can&rsquo;t reach immortality.</p>
<p>And if you could, it would be resource taxing</p>
<p>on everyone else, if you really were.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I mean, the book&rsquo;s for the next 500 years,</p>
<p>but I presume I&rsquo;ll be dead</p>
<p>for the vast majority of that time.</p>
<p>But that is actually the liberating state of mortality,</p>
<p>is you know that you don&rsquo;t have forever.</p>
<p>So it means what can you do that is the most impactful.</p>
<p>But you can build things that you say,</p>
<p>I want to pass this on to the next generation.</p>
<p>Again, the most obvious thing we do with this</p>
<p>is if people have kids.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t think of this</p>
<p>as an intergenerational responsibility.</p>
<p>They think of it as, well, I was at the bar one night</p>
<p>and met this hot girl, and then things happened.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s more planned than that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no overarching sense of,</p>
<p>wait, I could have something that</p>
<p>three or four generations from now,</p>
<p>well, that someone will receive this gift</p>
<p>that was planned for them</p>
<p>long before they were born or gestating.</p>
<p>And I think we have that capacity.</p>
<p>And that can be a version of legacy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s even okay if no one knows exactly who started it,</p>
<p>but that the benefit was wrought by people,</p>
<p>you know, again, hundreds or even thousands of years</p>
<p>after you got it started.</p>
<p>So I think this is something that is,</p>
<p>only really people that are economically secure</p>
<p>can even begin to do this,</p>
<p>where you can say, you know,</p>
<p>think of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs,</p>
<p>where you need to satisfy your physical needs,</p>
<p>all your structural needs, and have shelter.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I&rsquo;m sitting from a position</p>
<p>of great privilege to be able to pontificate</p>
<p>about what I hope I could do for things</p>
<p>for people that come 200 years from now.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, more and more people can do that.</p>
<p>Humanity&rsquo;s never been in a better state,</p>
<p>quantifiably, to be able to start to think</p>
<p>about these intergenerational responsibilities.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an interesting balance.</p>
<p>Because like, it seems that if you let the ego flare up</p>
<p>a little bit, that&rsquo;s good for productivity.</p>
<p>Like saying, I can somehow achieve immortality</p>
<p>if what I do is going to be pretty good.</p>
<p>But then, that&rsquo;s actually being kind of dishonest</p>
<p>with yourself, because it won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>in the long arc of history, it won&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>in terms of your own ego.</p>
<p>But it will have a small piece to play in a larger puzzle.</p>
<p>And help people, you know.</p>
<p>Help people many generations from now.</p>
<p>And that they said, there are all these people</p>
<p>who were looking after me before I was ever born.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, because it&rsquo;s a bit of just,</p>
<p>even just, when you go to a campsite,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a camping rule that you always leave</p>
<p>the campsite better than you found it.</p>
<p>So if the fire pit was somewhat damaged</p>
<p>and you got there, you fix it.</p>
<p>If there was no wood, you leave a few bits of logs</p>
<p>for the next person who comes.</p>
<p>And this ethos is something that just picked up</p>
<p>from camping, and so I think if we did that as people,</p>
<p>the world would be a better place,</p>
<p>and the world coming ahead would also be.</p>
<p>That said, with these entropy glasses,</p>
<p>how can you see through the fog?</p>
<p>500 years is a long time.</p>
<p>First of all, why 500 years?</p>
<p>Most people, this is so refreshing.</p>
<p>Because most colleagues and friends I talk to</p>
<p>are, don&rsquo;t have the guts to think even like 10 years out.</p>
<p>They start doing wishy-washy kind of statements</p>
<p>about, well, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so refreshing to say, all right,</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s so many trajectories</p>
<p>that this world can take, but I&rsquo;m going to pick a few</p>
<p>and think through them, and think what,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the, well, it&rsquo;s the quote, right?</p>
<p>Plans are useless, but planning&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>So why 500 years?</p>
<p>So 500 was a little bit of what I felt like I could see</p>
<p>clearly through the entropy goggles.</p>
<p>I feel like I can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Which is a contradiction in terms, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, right, right, I can see.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, if you said,</p>
<p>Chris, what&rsquo;s going to happen in a million years?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll start to describe what happens to,</p>
<p>the moon will be farther away</p>
<p>because it moves several inches away every year.</p>
<p>And so then eventually you can&rsquo;t have a full lunar eclipse</p>
<p>after a while.</p>
<p>I think about structures of continental change</p>
<p>and things will move.</p>
<p>I could describe some things,</p>
<p>but it starts to become so vague.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a useful exercise.</p>
<p>I think if it&rsquo;s too far out, if it&rsquo;s too soon,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not that much different</p>
<p>from what people just do with the news and say,</p>
<p>I think this is what the economy might look like</p>
<p>over the next year or two years.</p>
<p>Economists are notoriously not held accountable</p>
<p>when they have really bad predictions.</p>
<p>You can make really awful predictions</p>
<p>and no one seems to care.</p>
<p>You can just make another one next week.</p>
<p>So too short is, I think, not necessarily as helpful.</p>
<p>But 500, I actually, when I was first working on the book</p>
<p>and thinking about the time, I thought,</p>
<p>well, do I do 1,000 or 2,000?</p>
<p>I kept thinking about, the main idea was</p>
<p>if I were to pick this up 500 years from now,</p>
<p>what would it look like?</p>
<p>I changed the number.</p>
<p>If I pick up 1,000 years from now or 100,</p>
<p>and I kept trying to think of what are some timeframes</p>
<p>where really large-scale changes have happened?</p>
<p>And so, in some sense, you could argue</p>
<p>that humans have been mostly the same</p>
<p>for about 3,000 or 4,000 years.</p>
<p>And the best example is this.</p>
<p>You looked at some of the Homer&rsquo;s poems</p>
<p>or the Greek tragedies in Oedipus, for example.</p>
<p>Humans are really almost identical.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still petty and people have affairs</p>
<p>and people do things they shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>People, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying all those things like it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>You read, it&rsquo;s astounding and, in some sense,</p>
<p>soothing that the Greek tragedies of 2,300 years ago</p>
<p>are very relatable to what happens</p>
<p>in every high school, right?</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s why you read them in high school.</p>
<p>Like, oh, that&rsquo;s really a clear part</p>
<p>of the human condition.</p>
<p>So, on that sense, some things are really permanent.</p>
<p>But I want to think of, a few reasons I chose 500</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a timeframe where I could foresee</p>
<p>clear development of some biotechnology</p>
<p>that will get us to a new place,</p>
<p>including missions to Mars that are planned</p>
<p>that will be there and that would start to have</p>
<p>settlements there on the Moon and Mars.</p>
<p>And I could see, also, that by that time,</p>
<p>I think we would have enough knowledge of biology</p>
<p>and technology and space medicine</p>
<p>to start to prepare for an interstellar mission,</p>
<p>to actually send people on a craft</p>
<p>that would have what&rsquo;s called a generation ship.</p>
<p>People live and die on the same spacecraft</p>
<p>on the way towards a destination.</p>
<p>But I think we need that much time</p>
<p>to actually perfect the technology</p>
<p>and to learn enough about physiology</p>
<p>to be able to make it for that distance.</p>
<p>And the book is kind of focused on the human story.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a specific slice of the possible futures.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There could be sort of AI systems.</p>
<p>There could be other technologies</p>
<p>that kind of build up the world.</p>
<p>So much of the world might be lived in virtual reality.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re not touching any of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sticking to biology.</p>
<p>Well, not, you&rsquo;re touching a little bit,</p>
<p>but focused on what the cells that make up the human body,</p>
<p>how do they change?</p>
<p>How do we design technologies to repair them?</p>
<p>And how do we protect them</p>
<p>and as they travel out into the cosmos?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that is part of the duty.</p>
<p>If your duty is to keep life safe,</p>
<p>you have to consider all means to do so.</p>
<p>And engineering life to save itself</p>
<p>is definitely on that list.</p>
<p>I think we can imagine in that timeframe, 500 years,</p>
<p>that we would, there will be AI</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s continually advancing.</p>
<p>And I actually say that I&rsquo;m matter agnostic</p>
<p>towards cognition.</p>
<p>So, if your matter is carbon atoms and cells and tissues</p>
<p>and you have cognition, bravo, good for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re silicon-based and you&rsquo;re in chips</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in AI, that&rsquo;s all virtual.</p>
<p>But we reach a state of well beyond the Turing test</p>
<p>and really clearly intelligent.</p>
<p>Congratulations to you too.</p>
<p>So, I feel like this sense of duty is applicable</p>
<p>regardless of what the state of matter</p>
<p>your cognition is based in.</p>
<p>So, I would imagine that AI platforms</p>
<p>that are really intelligent</p>
<p>might also get a sense of this duty.</p>
<p>Or I hope they would.</p>
<p>I wrote the book.</p>
<p>So, they can carry that flame</p>
<p>of whatever makes humans special.</p>
<p>So, but why nevertheless is so much of your focus</p>
<p>on this human meat vehicle?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s essential?</p>
<p>No, it definitely does not.</p>
<p>It could be, I&rsquo;m hoping that the AI platforms</p>
<p>that we build or that would become,</p>
<p>that would start to build themselves</p>
<p>would also carry the sense of duty.</p>
<p>Because at that point, they would be life.</p>
<p>And so, whichever means that life,</p>
<p>whatever form life takes, it should have this duty, I think.</p>
<p>Will it have the lessons of genetics, genomics,</p>
<p>DNA and RNA and proteins and the squishy stuff</p>
<p>that makes us human?</p>
<p>Are those lessons a temporary thing that we&rsquo;ll discard?</p>
<p>Or will those lessons be carried forward?</p>
<p>I mean, like if the machines completely take over,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, and it&rsquo;s all-</p>
<p>Not necessarily completely take over,</p>
<p>but either completely take over</p>
<p>or merge with humans in some interesting way</p>
<p>where we, as opposed to figuring out</p>
<p>how to repair cells and protect cells,</p>
<p>we start having some cyborg cells.</p>
<p>I think we will.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll definitely be a blending.</p>
<p>Blending&rsquo;s already happened.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s prosthetic limbs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s cybernetic limbs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s neural link.</p>
<p>Progress being made to blend biology</p>
<p>and cybernetics and machines, for sure.</p>
<p>But I think in the long term,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see that they are fairly&hellip;</p>
<p>The biology would be useful</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a manufacturing system.</p>
<p>All of life is a way to create copies of things</p>
<p>or to replicate information,</p>
<p>including storage of information.</p>
<p>Actually, hard drives are probably one of the worst ways</p>
<p>for long-term storage.</p>
<p>DNA might end up being the best way to have</p>
<p>millennia or even longer scale storage</p>
<p>where you want something that has redundancy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built in and it can store</p>
<p>and can be put at really cold temperatures</p>
<p>and survive even cosmic rays.</p>
<p>DNA might be the best hard drive of the future, potentially.</p>
<p>This is really interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, what is DNA?</p>
<p>What is RNA?</p>
<p>And what are genes?</p>
<p>Yes, we should,</p>
<p>because most, I presume the audience knows it,</p>
<p>but some might just be first-time listeners</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a person right now in Brazil</p>
<p>smoking a joint, sitting on the beach,</p>
<p>and just wants to learn about DNA.</p>
<p>So please, can you explain it to them?</p>
<p>DNA, the deoxyribonucleic acid, is the recipe for life.</p>
<p>It is what carries the instructions.</p>
<p>In almost all of your cells,</p>
<p>you have a copy of your genome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the reason I became a geneticist</p>
<p>is because the day I learned that as an embryo,</p>
<p>we start with just a single cell,</p>
<p>but all the instructions that are there</p>
<p>to make every single type of cell in your body,</p>
<p>I was, and still am, endlessly fascinated by that.</p>
<p>That is extraordinary.</p>
<p>That is, to me, the most beautiful thing</p>
<p>in the entire universe.</p>
<p>That is, from one single embryo,</p>
<p>everything is there to make the entire body.</p>
<p>Which aspect of that is most beautiful?</p>
<p>So is it that there is this information within DNA</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stored efficiently,</p>
<p>and it also stores information on how to build,</p>
<p>not just what to build.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From all of that, what&rsquo;s the sexiest,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the most beautiful aspect?</p>
<p>Is it the entire machinery,</p>
<p>or is it just the information is there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that the machinery is the information,</p>
<p>like that it becomes its own manufacturer</p>
<p>is what is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Imagine if you took a one two-by-four</p>
<p>and you threw it on the ground,</p>
<p>and you said, I&rsquo;ll be back in a day,</p>
<p>and then a whole house was made when you came back.</p>
<p>I mean, we would all lose our minds.</p>
<p>A lot of people would poop their pants.</p>
<p>People would have to wear adult diapers.</p>
<p>It would be a big scene if that happened.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re actually getting close to that.</p>
<p>People are having autonomous house building.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite there yet,</p>
<p>but there are people trying to make robots</p>
<p>that will build entire houses for you.</p>
<p>But you need much more than the block of wood.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the extraordinary thing,</p>
<p>is just to put one piece of wood there</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;ll just leave it there for a few days,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll come back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what embryos do.</p>
<p>Okay, it takes nine months, a little bit longer,</p>
<p>but still, that is nothing short of magic, right?</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what I love about</p>
<p>the fact that DNA carries that information.</p>
<p>Now, the information is static,</p>
<p>so to actually read that information</p>
<p>and to actually put it into motion is where RNA comes in.</p>
<p>So this ribonucleic acid,</p>
<p>so it just has one other oxygen added to it,</p>
<p>versus DNA, but it&rsquo;s the transcribed version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you look at a book</p>
<p>and you see you have it in your hands,</p>
<p>but then you start to read it aloud,</p>
<p>it becomes the active form of the recipe for life,</p>
<p>is the RNA.</p>
<p>And those RNAs also then get translated to become proteins,</p>
<p>to become active forms like enzymes.</p>
<p>If you think of like your hair</p>
<p>or think of other ways you digest food,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these active proteins going around</p>
<p>that are copying your DNA, making RNA,</p>
<p>making sure your DNA is safe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these built-in systems</p>
<p>to keep your cells in check and working,</p>
<p>and these are often in protein form.</p>
<p>And so genes are really these constructs.</p>
<p>Basically, what are the instruction sets?</p>
<p>Like how many versions of instructions</p>
<p>do you have in your genome?</p>
<p>So the genome is the collection of all the DNA of a person.</p>
<p>For humans, it&rsquo;s about three billion letters</p>
<p>of genetic code.</p>
<p>So just three billion A, Cs, Gs, and Ts,</p>
<p>these nucleotides that are the recipe for life,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That is the entire instruction set</p>
<p>to go from that one embryo up to a full human,</p>
<p>which is pretty efficient to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not that much information.</p>
<p>And in that three billion letters</p>
<p>are snippets of the genes,</p>
<p>which are independently regulated,</p>
<p>autonomous instruction sets, if you will,</p>
<p>these really active forms of the instructions</p>
<p>from your DNA to say, make a protein,</p>
<p>make this RNA, or turn off some other part of a cell.</p>
<p>All those instructions are there in our DNA,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s about 60,000 of these genes</p>
<p>that are in our genome.</p>
<p>So how do those all lead up to you having a personality,</p>
<p>good memory and bad memory?</p>
<p>Some of the functional characteristics</p>
<p>that we at the human level are able to interpret,</p>
<p>the way your face look, the way you smile,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re good at running or jumping,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re good at math and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an age-old debate of nature versus nurture.</p>
<p>So like most things, if given two options,</p>
<p>you can of course have both.</p>
<p>So almost every trait that we know of in humanity</p>
<p>has mixtures of nurture and nature.</p>
<p>Some of them are purely nurture.</p>
<p>So most people are probably familiar with twin studies,</p>
<p>but twin studies are one of the best ways to gauge</p>
<p>how much is something nurture versus nature,</p>
<p>how much of it is really ingrained</p>
<p>and has probably less ability to change</p>
<p>versus how much can you really train.</p>
<p>So height, for example,</p>
<p>is one of the most obvious inheritable traits,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have one gene.</p>
<p>It probably has at least 50 or 60 genes</p>
<p>that contribute to height.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not like a gene for height.</p>
<p>Some people think of like the gene for cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>Now in that case, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There is one gene that if you have mutations,</p>
<p>you get cystic fibrosis as a disease.</p>
<p>But for other traits, they&rsquo;re much more complicated.</p>
<p>They can have dozens or even hundreds of genes</p>
<p>that influence your risk and what appears.</p>
<p>But from twin studies, you take monozygotic twins,</p>
<p>twins that are identical, and you can clearly tell.</p>
<p>They look, they have the same facial structure,</p>
<p>similar intonation, similar even likes,</p>
<p>and you compare them to dizygotic twins.</p>
<p>Or when you have fraternal twins,</p>
<p>you can have a male and female,</p>
<p>for example, in the same uterus,</p>
<p>and those are dizygotic twins or two zygotes.</p>
<p>So in that case, they share 50% of their DNA,</p>
<p>but they share the same womb.</p>
<p>And then what you can look at is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between identical twins</p>
<p>versus fraternal twins?</p>
<p>And calculate that difference for any trait.</p>
<p>And that gives you an estimate of the heritability,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s called H-squared.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>for almost every trait in humanity for the past,</p>
<p>you know, 100 years, we&rsquo;ve been trying to measure this.</p>
<p>And religion is one that&rsquo;s a negative control.</p>
<p>So if you separate people and see what religion they become,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no gene for religion or what religion you choose.</p>
<p>So often, the correlation there is zero,</p>
<p>because it should be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nurture trait.</p>
<p>What religion you end up taking is not encoded in your DNA.</p>
<p>Religion meaning Islam, Judaism, Christianity,</p>
<p>but there could be aspects of religions that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>There is religiosity as a trait</p>
<p>that has been studied in twins,</p>
<p>and that has a heritable component to some degree.</p>
<p>So, and things like boredom susceptibility is a trait.</p>
<p>One of my favorite papers just looked at,</p>
<p>how likely is it that people get bored?</p>
<p>And they looked at identical twins and fraternal twins,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a heritability of about 30%.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s mostly not heritable, it&rsquo;s mostly environmental,</p>
<p>but that means to some degree,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re bored,</p>
<p>you can say, well, it&rsquo;s a little bit of my genes.</p>
<p>You could, a little bit, not a lot,</p>
<p>but most traits have some degree,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re probably overlapping with other traits.</p>
<p>Like your boredom susceptibility</p>
<p>versus risk-seeking behavior are interrelated.</p>
<p>So how likely are you to say, I wanna go cliff jumping,</p>
<p>or I wanna go, I wanna do freebasing,</p>
<p>or I wanna, I don&rsquo;t know, do some else that&rsquo;s risky behavior.</p>
<p>So speaking of twin studies,</p>
<p>Scott Kelly spent 340 consecutive days out in space</p>
<p>you analyzed his molecular data, DNA, RNA,</p>
<p>proteins, small molecules.</p>
<p>What did you learn about the effect of space</p>
<p>on the human body from Scott?</p>
<p>We learned that space is rough on the human body,</p>
<p>but that the human body is amazingly</p>
<p>and monstrously responsive to adapt to that challenge.</p>
<p>It can rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>So we can see, Scott had, as almost all astronauts do,</p>
<p>a bit of puffiness and spikes in his bloodstream</p>
<p>of these what are called cytokines,</p>
<p>or these inflammation markers of the body</p>
<p>is clearly saying to itself, holy crap, I&rsquo;m in space.</p>
<p>And liters of fluid move to the upper torso,</p>
<p>and they get a puffy face,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the astronaut face that is very common,</p>
<p>but it goes away after a few days.</p>
<p>And some astronauts maintain high levels of stress</p>
<p>for their whole mission, as measured by cortisol</p>
<p>or some of these other inflammation markers.</p>
<p>Whereas Scott actually had a little spike,</p>
<p>but then he was cool as a cucumber for most of the mission.</p>
<p>But he had spent, at that time,</p>
<p>it was the longest ever mission for a US astronaut.</p>
<p>A few cosmonauts have gone a little bit longer,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;d never been a deep molecular analysis</p>
<p>of what happens to the body after about a year in space.</p>
<p>So it was the first study of this kind.</p>
<p>And what we found is when he got back,</p>
<p>we saw all the same markers of stress on the body</p>
<p>and changes spiked up to levels we&rsquo;d never seen</p>
<p>for any other astronaut before.</p>
<p>So it seemed like going to space for a year</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t so hard as much as returning to gravity</p>
<p>after a year, it was much harder on the body.</p>
<p>He notoriously broke out in a rash all over his body.</p>
<p>And really, even the weight of clothing on his skin</p>
<p>was too heavy.</p>
<p>It created all this irritation</p>
<p>because his body had not felt the weight</p>
<p>of just a simple T-shirt.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really, it had zero weight, of course, right?</p>
<p>So it went up in space.</p>
<p>So that led to all this inflammation, all these changes.</p>
<p>He was much more comfortable just to walk around nude.</p>
<p>In that case, it was for a medical reason.</p>
<p>Some people do this recreationally.</p>
<p>He was doing it for medical purposes.</p>
<p>I do it for medical reasons as well.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>I have a prescription, the doctor told me.</p>
<p>So he was allergic to Earth, you can say,</p>
<p>which is fascinating to think about, actually.</p>
<p>How quickly did his body adapt there?</p>
<p>So there it was about three to four days</p>
<p>he got back to normal, at least in terms of the inflammation.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s extraordinary is that we measured</p>
<p>a lot of other molecules, genes, structural changes,</p>
<p>tissue, look at his eyeballs, look at his vasculature.</p>
<p>It took him even six months after the mission,</p>
<p>a lot of the genes that had become activated</p>
<p>in response to space flight were still active.</p>
<p>So things like, we could see his body repairing DNA.</p>
<p>It was being irradiated by cosmic rays</p>
<p>and by the radiation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the equivalent of giving three or four</p>
<p>chest x-rays every day, just in space.</p>
<p>And we could see his body working hard</p>
<p>at the molecular level to repair itself.</p>
<p>And even in his urine, we could see bits of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called 8-oxyguanosine, a form of damaged DNA</p>
<p>that you could see coming out.</p>
<p>And we see it for other astronauts as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very common.</p>
<p>You could see damaged DNA, the response of the body</p>
<p>to repair the DNA.</p>
<p>But even though he&rsquo;d been back on Earth for six months,</p>
<p>that was still happening, even six months later.</p>
<p>How do you, wait, how do you explain that?</p>
<p>So some of this has to do with,</p>
<p>when you have a gene get activated,</p>
<p>you might think, oh, it&rsquo;s like a light switch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at my wall, just flip a light on or off.</p>
<p>And sometimes turning a gene on or off is that simple.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just flip it on because the gene</p>
<p>is already ready to go.</p>
<p>Other cases, though, you have to reprogram</p>
<p>even the structure of how your DNA is packaged,</p>
<p>which is called an epigenetic rearrangement.</p>
<p>In that case, we could see that a lot of these genes</p>
<p>had been, his cells had changed the structure</p>
<p>of how DNA was packaged, and it remained open</p>
<p>even months after the mission.</p>
<p>Now, after about a year, it was actually almost</p>
<p>all back to normal.</p>
<p>99% of all the genes were back to where they were</p>
<p>in pre-flight levels.</p>
<p>So it means that eventually you&rsquo;ll adapt,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s almost a lag time,</p>
<p>kind of like jet lag for the body,</p>
<p>but jet lag for your cells to repair all the DNA.</p>
<p>What was the most surprising thing</p>
<p>that you found in that study?</p>
<p>There were several surprises.</p>
<p>One is just that the repair, as I just mentioned,</p>
<p>that the repair took so long.</p>
<p>I thought maybe a week or a few days,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll be back to normal.</p>
<p>But to see this molecular echo in his cells</p>
<p>of his time and space still occurring was interesting.</p>
<p>His telomeres was one that was really surprising.</p>
<p>The caps on the ends of your chromosomes,</p>
<p>which keep all your DNA packaged,</p>
<p>and you get half your chromosomes from your mother</p>
<p>and half from your father, and then you go on</p>
<p>and make all your cells.</p>
<p>Normally, these shrink as you get older,</p>
<p>and telomeres&rsquo; length is just an overall sign</p>
<p>of aging, getting shorter.</p>
<p>His telomeres got longer in space.</p>
<p>And so it was really surprising</p>
<p>because we thought the opposite would happen.</p>
<p>So that was genetically one surprise.</p>
<p>And also, some of the mutations we found in his blood,</p>
<p>he had less mutations in blood,</p>
<p>as if his body was almost being,</p>
<p>like a low dose of radiation was sort of cleansing his body,</p>
<p>of maybe the cells that were about to die</p>
<p>is one of our main theories on what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And of course, you can&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>you have theories, but you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The number of subjects in the study is small.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s notoriously one of the lowest-powered studies</p>
<p>in human history, yes.</p>
<p>But what you lack in subjects,</p>
<p>you can make up for in the number of sampling times.</p>
<p>So we did basically 260 samples collected</p>
<p>over the course of three years.</p>
<p>So we really, almost every few weeks,</p>
<p>had a full workup, including in space.</p>
<p>So that was the way we tried to make up for it.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve tried in other model organisms.</p>
<p>In mice, we&rsquo;ve seen this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve looked now in 59 other astronauts.</p>
<p>And in every astronaut that we&rsquo;ve looked at,</p>
<p>their telomeres get longer in space.</p>
<p>Does that indicate anything about lifespan,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things, or no?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make any of those kinds of jumps.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t make that jump yet,</p>
<p>but it does indicate that there is a version</p>
<p>of cleansing, if you will, that&rsquo;s happening in space.</p>
<p>A mixture of, and we see this actually clinically</p>
<p>at our hospital.</p>
<p>You can do a low dose of radiation</p>
<p>with some targeted therapies</p>
<p>to kind of activate your immune cells.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even tried clinically.</p>
<p>So this idea of just a little bit of stress on the body,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s called hormesis,</p>
<p>may prime you into active of cleansing things</p>
<p>that were about to die.</p>
<p>And that includes stress caused by space.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, apparently.</p>
<p>So how do we adapt the human body to stress of this kind</p>
<p>for periods of multiple years?</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw from that study</p>
<p>and other experiments in space</p>
<p>that give you an indication</p>
<p>of how we can survive for multiple years?</p>
<p>I think we know that the radiation</p>
<p>is one of the biggest risk factors,</p>
<p>and this has been well described by NASA</p>
<p>and many other astronauts and researchers.</p>
<p>And so there, we don&rsquo;t have to just measure the radiation</p>
<p>or just look at DNA being damaged.</p>
<p>We can actually actively repair it.</p>
<p>This happens naturally in all of our cells.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little enzymes, little protein,</p>
<p>and really many machines that go around</p>
<p>and scan DNA for nicks and breaks and repair it.</p>
<p>We could improve them.</p>
<p>We could add more of them,</p>
<p>or you can even activate them before you go into space.</p>
<p>We have one set of cells in my lab</p>
<p>where you activate them before we irradiate them</p>
<p>to actually prepare them for the dose of radiation.</p>
<p>And now that is what&rsquo;s called epigenetic CRISPR therapies,</p>
<p>where you can actually,</p>
<p>instead of adding or taking away a gene or modifying a cell,</p>
<p>you just change kind of how it&rsquo;s packaged.</p>
<p>Like I was just describing that the DNA,</p>
<p>the genes are still there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just changing how they get used.</p>
<p>And so you can actually preemptively activate</p>
<p>the DNA repair genes, and we&rsquo;ve done this for cells.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done this yet for astronauts,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve done it for cells.</p>
<p>And a similar idea to this is being used</p>
<p>to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia,</p>
<p>is you can reactivate a gene that was dormant</p>
<p>in a way as a therapy.</p>
<p>So should we make human genes resilient to harsh conditions,</p>
<p>or should we get good at repairing them?</p>
<p>I wanna get good at repairing.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I think every time I ask this question,</p>
<p>you have taught me that there&rsquo;s always a third option.</p>
<p>Say both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll say both.</p>
<p>I know for copy, it&rsquo;s good to just have one big statement,</p>
<p>but you wanna do both, or a third option.</p>
<p>I would want to do electromagnetic shielding.</p>
<p>I would wanna do a fourth option of maybe some other</p>
<p>kind of physical defenses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re outside of the human body.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re taking the same passion</p>
<p>to keep astronauts safe that&rsquo;s outside of them</p>
<p>and just putting it in their cells is what I propose.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s a bit radical today</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re just starting this in clinical trials</p>
<p>to treat diseases on Earth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not ready, I think, to do in astronauts.</p>
<p>But in the book, I propose by about the year 2040,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;d reach this next phase</p>
<p>where I think we&rsquo;ll have known enough</p>
<p>about the clinical response.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have the technology ironed out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about when it&rsquo;s time, I think, to try it.</p>
<p>So what are some interesting early milestones?</p>
<p>So you said 2040.</p>
<p>What do we have to look forward to in the next 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>according to your book, according to your thoughts?</p>
<p>A lot of really exciting developments</p>
<p>where if you really want to activate genes,</p>
<p>like I was just describing,</p>
<p>or repair a specific disease gene,</p>
<p>you can actually CRISPR it out and modify it.</p>
<p>This has been already published and well-documented.</p>
<p>But as I was alluding to,</p>
<p>more and more we&rsquo;ll see people</p>
<p>that just wanna temporarily change your gene&rsquo;s functions</p>
<p>and change their activity.</p>
<p>So the best example of this is for beta thalassemia.</p>
<p>We all have hemoglobin in our blood</p>
<p>that carries oxygen around.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re an adult, it&rsquo;s a different version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different gene.</p>
<p>One gene when you&rsquo;re a fetus called fetal hemoglobin.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re an adult, you have a different gene.</p>
<p>But they both are making a protein that carries oxygen.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re after you&rsquo;re born,</p>
<p>the fetal hemoglobin gene gets just turned off.</p>
<p>Just goes away.</p>
<p>And you replace it with adult hemoglobin.</p>
<p>But if your gene for hemoglobin is bad as an adult,</p>
<p>one of the therapies is,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s turn back on the gene</p>
<p>that you had when you were a fetus.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually already led to cures</p>
<p>for sickle cell and beta thalassemia in this past year.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this extraordinary idea of like,</p>
<p>well, you already have some of the genetic solutions</p>
<p>in your body.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just reactivate them</p>
<p>and see if you can live?</p>
<p>And indeed, you can.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ll see more of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for severe disease,</p>
<p>but eventually you could see it for more,</p>
<p>I think, work-related purposes.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re working in a dangerous mine</p>
<p>or in a high-radiation environment,</p>
<p>you could basically start to prime it</p>
<p>for work safety, basically.</p>
<p>We need to genetically protect you.</p>
<p>Now, it would have to be shown</p>
<p>that that genetic option is safe, reliable,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s better, at least as good,</p>
<p>or if not better, than other shielding methods.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;ll start to see that more</p>
<p>in the next 10, 20 years.</p>
<p>And eventually, as I describe in the book,</p>
<p>you could get to recreational genetics.</p>
<p>You could say, well, I want to turn some genes on</p>
<p>just for this weekend because I&rsquo;m going to a high altitude,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d like to prepare for that.</p>
<p>And so instead of having to take weeks and weeks</p>
<p>for acclimation, you could just do</p>
<p>some quick epigenetic therapies</p>
<p>and have a good time in the mountains</p>
<p>and then come back and turn them back on.</p>
<p>So this is stuff to do on Earth</p>
<p>across thousands of humans,</p>
<p>and then you start getting good data</p>
<p>about what the effects on the human body are.</p>
<p>How do we make humans survive across an entire lifetime</p>
<p>for, let&rsquo;s say, several decades in space?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just in space, it&rsquo;ll be hard</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll need basically some gravity at some point.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d need orbital platforms</p>
<p>that give you at least some partial gravity, if not 1G.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on Mars, it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>you know, even though the gravity is 38% of Earth&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>just having that gravity would be enough.</p>
<p>And if you could get under the surface</p>
<p>into some of the lava tubes,</p>
<p>where you have some protection above you from the radiation,</p>
<p>I think that would be,</p>
<p>you probably could survive quite well there.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just in space part that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d need some gravity.</p>
<p>You need some additional protection from the radiation.</p>
<p>Can you linger on the lava tubes on Mars?</p>
<p>What are the lava tubes on Mars?</p>
<p>Yeah, so they are a bit like what they sound,</p>
<p>like there were large masses of lava</p>
<p>at one point on the planet,</p>
<p>pushing really quickly through the environment.</p>
<p>And they created basically these small caverns,</p>
<p>which you could go in, in theory,</p>
<p>and build a small habitat and then puff it up,</p>
<p>kind of like blowing up a balloon</p>
<p>and have a protective habitat.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s a little bit underground.</p>
<p>So one of the next helicopter missions</p>
<p>being planned at the Jet Propulsion Lab</p>
<p>is to see if you can get a helicopter</p>
<p>to go into the lava tube.</p>
<p>And which is just, as it sounds,</p>
<p>kind of like take out a big worm</p>
<p>that has burrowed into the landscape</p>
<p>and leave out the hollow column that&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what your tubes look like.</p>
<p>So one of the future helicopters</p>
<p>might even go explore one of them</p>
<p>as a mission being planned right now.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re accessible without</p>
<p>a significant amount of drilling?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the other advantage.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can get to them,</p>
<p>because some of them are exposed.</p>
<p>You could do a little bit of drilling</p>
<p>and then see, essentially, this entire cavern.</p>
<p>And that protects you a little bit from the radiation.</p>
<p>Right, because you have some soil above you, basically,</p>
<p>which would be a regolith, which would be nice.</p>
<p>What about source of food?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good, so that&rsquo;s part of biology,</p>
<p>how you power this whole thing.</p>
<p>What about source of food across decades?</p>
<p>In space, we&rsquo;d have to,</p>
<p>plants have been grown in flight</p>
<p>and you can get some nutrients,</p>
<p>but right now, it is very reliant</p>
<p>on all the upmass being sent up,</p>
<p>all the freeze-dried food that then gets rehydrated,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t taste awful, but is not self-reliant.</p>
<p>So I think those would have to be small bioreactors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d have to be a lot of work on fermentation,</p>
<p>a lot of work on, essentially, prototrophic organisms,</p>
<p>the organisms that can make all of the 20 amino acids</p>
<p>that you would need to eat.</p>
<p>I describe a little bit in the book,</p>
<p>what if we did a prototrophic human,</p>
<p>where you could have, like right now,</p>
<p>we need to get some of our amino acids</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t make them all,</p>
<p>which I think is kind of sad.</p>
<p>So what if we could make all of our own amino acids</p>
<p>or all of our own vitamins?</p>
<p>And also, I think that&rsquo;s one case</p>
<p>where another adaptation could be</p>
<p>to activate the vitamin C gene.</p>
<p>Like right now, you&rsquo;d have to have limes</p>
<p>or some other source of vitamin C in space,</p>
<p>but we actually carry the gene inside of our genome</p>
<p>to make vitamin C.</p>
<p>Look at dogs and cats, for example.</p>
<p>They have these kind of wet noses.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see them going out and getting margaritas,</p>
<p>although dogs can drink beer and get drunk.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need vitamin C.</p>
<p>They have no risk of scurvy</p>
<p>because they can make the vitamin C all by themselves.</p>
<p>So can other wet-nosed primates called strepsirines.</p>
<p>But we are dry-nosed primates,</p>
<p>and we lost this ability sometimes</p>
<p>10 or 20 million years ago.</p>
<p>We no longer make our own vitamin C,</p>
<p>but the gene for it, it&rsquo;s called GULO,</p>
<p>is still in our DNA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a pseudogene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just broken down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like having a, like in our genome,</p>
<p>we have these functional genes,</p>
<p>like nice BMW, a nice car that works well,</p>
<p>but we also have this like wrecking,</p>
<p>this like junkyard of old cars, old genes,</p>
<p>old functions in our DNA that we could bring back.</p>
<p>And so vitamin C is one of them</p>
<p>that would be very easy to do.</p>
<p>So then you could activate the gene, repair it basically,</p>
<p>repair it so we can make our own vitamin C.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;d have to do it again carefully</p>
<p>because what if we lost vitamin C,</p>
<p>the production of vitamin C as a species?</p>
<p>What if it was a good reason that we lost it?</p>
<p>Maybe it was helping in some other way</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t see now,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d start slowly, do it in cells,</p>
<p>then do it potentially in animal models</p>
<p>and other primates, and then try it in humans.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s something else I&rsquo;d like to see</p>
<p>so we wouldn&rsquo;t have to make as much food in orbit.</p>
<p>You could actually start to make</p>
<p>as much of your own food in your own cells.</p>
<p>So the input to the system in terms of energy</p>
<p>could be much more restricted.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to have the diversity</p>
<p>we currently need as humans.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to be a robot.</p>
<p>Humans love, as I do, texture.</p>
<p>I realize that made me sound like I wasn&rsquo;t human,</p>
<p>but humans love food and flavors and textures and smells.</p>
<p>All of that is actually attenuated in flight.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d want to not forget our humanity</p>
<p>and this love of all the benefits and wonder of food</p>
<p>and cooking and smells.</p>
<p>Well, speak for yourself,</p>
<p>because for me, I eat the same thing every single day</p>
<p>and I find beauty in everything.</p>
<p>And some beauty is more easily accessible outside of Earth.</p>
<p>And food is not one of those things, I think.</p>
<p>What about insects?</p>
<p>The people bring that up,</p>
<p>basically food that has sex with itself and multiplies.</p>
<p>So cockroaches and so on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a source of a lot of protein</p>
<p>and a lot of the amino acids.</p>
<p>And bedbugs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy at the American Academy of Natural History</p>
<p>in New York, he loves bedbugs, Lou Sorkin.</p>
<p>And he has a monthly meeting where he talks about</p>
<p>which insects would be the best for eating.</p>
<p>And one month, he gave a whole talk about bedbugs,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re pretty gross,</p>
<p>but in terms of the value of what you can get for protein,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a good candidate.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d have to, if you could deep fry them.</p>
<p>If you deep fry anything, you can pretty much eat it.</p>
<p>Some of you need a fryer up in space,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re a candidate.</p>
<p>All right, what, technical question,</p>
<p>what are the major challenges of sex in space?</p>
<p>Asking for a friend for reproduction purposes.</p>
<p>So like, when we&rsquo;re looking about survival</p>
<p>of the human species across generations.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do we need gravity, essentially?</p>
<p>For sex in space, we know that gestation can happen</p>
<p>in space, where the babies can develop, at least in mice.</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s possible for worms to replicate and fly,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s possible for other invertebrates</p>
<p>to show they can make babies in space.</p>
<p>But for humans, NASA&rsquo;s official stance on this</p>
<p>is that there has never been sex in space, officially.</p>
<p>I think, you know, if we all wonder about that,</p>
<p>I think humans are very predictable in that regard.</p>
<p>Again, going back to the Greek tragedies,</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s probably someone</p>
<p>did something close to it at some point.</p>
<p>And so I think we know that sperm can be sent into space</p>
<p>and brought back and be used for fertilization,</p>
<p>for in vitro fertilization for humans.</p>
<p>But sex itself in space, you know, would be,</p>
<p>I think when we start to get bigger structures</p>
<p>that have a bit more privacy,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ll be a lot of it.</p>
<p>And it has to be, you know, this is a big question</p>
<p>of who goes up into space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now becoming more of, you know, regular,</p>
<p>in quotes, people who have prosthetic limbs</p>
<p>or are cancer survivors like Haley Arsenault</p>
<p>who just went up on the Inspiration4 mission.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s been a great researcher</p>
<p>in helping with a lot of the science from that mission.</p>
<p>We are doing the same analysis on them</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re doing for the twin study.</p>
<p>And for other astronauts, we&rsquo;re doing basically</p>
<p>all the same molecular profile</p>
<p>before, during, and after space flight.</p>
<p>So there, we now know that other people can go into space.</p>
<p>As those more and more regular Joes and Janes go up,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll see a lot more of it.</p>
<p>But so far we have no data.</p>
<p>We have no video of it either.</p>
<p>We have no real knowledge other than it would be,</p>
<p>it would need a lot of Velcro,</p>
<p>I think is my only real answer there.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m, as a fan of Velcro and duct tape,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna be, those two are essential</p>
<p>for anything, any kind of engineering out anywhere,</p>
<p>honestly, in all kinds of harsh conditions.</p>
<p>But that is, I mean, on the topic of sex in general,</p>
<p>just social interaction with humans is fascinating.</p>
<p>The current missions are very focused on science</p>
<p>and very technical engineering things.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a human element that seeps in.</p>
<p>And the more we travel out to space,</p>
<p>the more the humans, the natural human drama,</p>
<p>the love, the hate that emerges,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all gonna be right there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Greek tragedy just in space, basically.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>Or a reality show.</p>
<p>So what about the colonization of other planets?</p>
<p>If we look at Mars, when you,</p>
<p>first of all, do you think it&rsquo;s a worthy effort</p>
<p>looking at this particular one planet</p>
<p>to put humans on Mars</p>
<p>and to start thinking about colonizing Mars?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the closest options.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best option, though, by far.</p>
<p>We put in the book measures of Earth Similarity Index,</p>
<p>or something called ESI, is how close is the gravity,</p>
<p>the temperature, the solar incidence on the surface,</p>
<p>how close is it to Earth is a calculation</p>
<p>many astronomers make when they look for exoplanets.</p>
<p>And Mars is pretty far away from an ESI of about 0.7.</p>
<p>I mean, Earth is one, so the best you can get is one.</p>
<p>Earth is just like Earth.</p>
<p>It gets a score of one.</p>
<p>Anything above some of the best exoplanets</p>
<p>that are in the habitable zone,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s liquid water that could be there,</p>
<p>start to get above 0.8 or 0.9,</p>
<p>but most planets are very low.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re 0.1, 0.2.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re either way too big,</p>
<p>and we have crushing gravity,</p>
<p>or way too small, too close to a sun.</p>
<p>But Mars is, even though it&rsquo;s not that great</p>
<p>on the ESI scale, it is still relatively close,</p>
<p>galactically, and Venus is just too hot right now.</p>
<p>So I think Venus would also be a great candidate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much easier to survive in a place</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very cold, but you can be sealed and survive,</p>
<p>whereas we probably just have no technology</p>
<p>to survive anywhere except in the clouds of Venus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just currently our best option,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the best option for sure.</p>
<p>So over time, the ESI changes across millennia.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>So Venus is gonna get cooler and cooler.</p>
<p>Okay, but what are the big challenges to you</p>
<p>in colonizing Mars, from a biology perspective,</p>
<p>from a human perspective, from an engineering perspective?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several big challenges to Mars,</p>
<p>and even the first one is even just the word colonize.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s even a social challenge.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people, Daniel Wood actually studies this</p>
<p>at MIT, is we shouldn&rsquo;t even use the word colonize,</p>
<p>but then we probably shouldn&rsquo;t use the word settle either,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s settlements that have some other baggage</p>
<p>to that word as well.</p>
<p>And then maybe we should use the word explore,</p>
<p>but at some point you need to say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going there to survive there.</p>
<p>And so colonization still is the word most people use,</p>
<p>but I try to say go explore and build or settle.</p>
<p>But I think the first challenge is social.</p>
<p>I think getting people to think</p>
<p>that this will not be like the colonization efforts</p>
<p>of the past.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will be a very different version</p>
<p>of humanity exploring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>History, you could say, has proved me wrong</p>
<p>every single time.</p>
<p>Every time humans have gone somewhere,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually been a tale of exploitation,</p>
<p>strife, and drama again, and often murder, genocide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a pretty dark history,</p>
<p>if you think of just all the colonization efforts.</p>
<p>But I think most of it was done</p>
<p>in a really dark area of humanity,</p>
<p>where the average life expectancy</p>
<p>was more than half, less than it was today.</p>
<p>Life was brutish and short, as many of,</p>
<p>as Hobbes has famously said.</p>
<p>So it was a rough existence, right?</p>
<p>So I think some of the ugliness of humanity</p>
<p>in prior colonization times was a consequence of the time,</p>
<p>or at least that&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>I think that now we would have it be much more,</p>
<p>I think, inclusive, much more responsible,</p>
<p>much more, much less evil, frankly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d go there, and you would need commercialization.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d need efforts to do mining, for example,</p>
<p>bring things back, but it&rsquo;d have to be some degree</p>
<p>where there are some areas that are viewed as commons</p>
<p>or that are untouchable, like places that are parks.</p>
<p>We do this today, even if there&rsquo;s a lake, for example,</p>
<p>the first several hundred feet of a lake</p>
<p>are all for public property and everything.</p>
<p>You can own property, but just not certain areas.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;d have to make sure we do that</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not completely exploited.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s on the social, the human side.</p>
<p>The technological, we&rsquo;ve talked a little bit</p>
<p>about where you&rsquo;d have to live.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d want to be underground with engineering</p>
<p>and modifying even human cells to make sure you survive.</p>
<p>The soil does have a lot of perchlorates,</p>
<p>which is a problem for growing them,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s ways to extract them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fair amount of water.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually this beautiful image</p>
<p>of all the known water on Mars</p>
<p>that NASA posted about a year ago.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s water everywhere, not lots of it everywhere,</p>
<p>but almost everywhere you look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s at least a little bit of water,</p>
<p>just a few feet under the surface.</p>
<p>And by the caps, there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>So I think we could get some water</p>
<p>and we could also do self-generating reactors,</p>
<p>machines that could make food, start to even make beer,</p>
<p>if you go long enough down the path.</p>
<p>But the technical challenges are definitely,</p>
<p>engineering and the manufacturing are gonna be hard</p>
<p>because you have to build the buildings</p>
<p>basically out of the soil that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So you have to really go there</p>
<p>and try and build with whatever you can.</p>
<p>So that has to be perfected still.</p>
<p>But then once you&rsquo;re in those buildings, those structures,</p>
<p>you need to create all the biology</p>
<p>that will feed the populace, feed them.</p>
<p>So, which we don&rsquo;t have the technology for yet.</p>
<p>We have bits of it,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s gonna be the biggest challenge</p>
<p>is making Mars really truly independent.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;ll probably take, as I say in the book,</p>
<p>several hundred years before I think we&rsquo;d get there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because we&rsquo;re also exploring</p>
<p>ways to motivate society to take on this challenge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the JFK thing and then the Cold War</p>
<p>that inspired the race to space.</p>
<p>And I think as a human species,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually trying to figure out different ideas</p>
<p>for how to motivate everybody</p>
<p>to work on the same project together.</p>
<p>But yet compete at the same time.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one idea and that&rsquo;s worked well.</p>
<p>Competition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily the only idea,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the one that worked well so far.</p>
<p>So maybe the only way to truly build a colony on Mars</p>
<p>or a successful human civilization on Mars</p>
<p>is to get China to get competitive about it.</p>
<p>And they are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve announced they wanna have boots</p>
<p>on the red planet by 2033,</p>
<p>which is two to four years earlier</p>
<p>than when NASA&rsquo;s supposed to do it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see if they get there first.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a space race 2.0,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just the US and Russia this time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s China, it&rsquo;s India, it&rsquo;s the UAE,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Europe, ESA.</p>
<p>JAXA has the Japanese Space Agency,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the US.</p>
<p>So now it went from just a two-person race</p>
<p>to a whole field of runners, if you will,</p>
<p>on the track trying to get to Mars first.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be like anything.</p>
<p>If you start to have settlements and construction projects</p>
<p>and places to visit on Mars,</p>
<p>I think the true mark of a place being actually settled</p>
<p>is when you start to be able to pick.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, well, I wanna go to this destination,</p>
<p>not this one, because they have better Martian cocktails</p>
<p>here, but this one&rsquo;s not as good.</p>
<p>So this idea of innovating and competing</p>
<p>will continue to drive, I think, humans as it always has.</p>
<p>You write this fascinating thing, which is, quote,</p>
<p>people living on Mars will have developed</p>
<p>entirely new cultures, dialects, products,</p>
<p>and even new religions or variations of current religions.</p>
<p>For example, a Martian Muslim will need to pray upward</p>
<p>toward the dusty sky.</p>
<p>I love that you&rsquo;ve thought through the geometry of this.</p>
<p>For example, a Martian Muslim will need to pray upward</p>
<p>toward the dusty sky since Earth, and therefore Mecca,</p>
<p>will sometimes be overhead.</p>
<p>Or when Mecca&rsquo;s below the Martian&rsquo;s feet,</p>
<p>the prayer direction to Allah will stay downward</p>
<p>toward the 38% gravity floor.</p>
<p>Perhaps a second Mecca will be built on the new planet.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another interesting question.</p>
<p>How will culture be different on Mars</p>
<p>in the early days and beyond?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;ll be, as we&rsquo;ve seen with all of human history,</p>
<p>I think, even just when people migrate and they move,</p>
<p>even the dialects change.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just going to the South in the United States,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, oh, y&rsquo;all, come on down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not even that far away,</p>
<p>or even just people on Long Island versus New York City,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be with a big nasally accent, oh, yeah,</p>
<p>and the people will just get, or even Wisconsin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Wisconsin, we just have this big nasally tone,</p>
<p>welcome to Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p>
<p>I wonder who defines that culture</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very likely that the early humans on Mars</p>
<p>will be very technically savvy.</p>
<p>They have to be for engineering challenges.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It could be the, this has to do with your extreme microbiome</p>
<p>is like, is it going to be the extreme survivalists,</p>
<p>or is it going to be the engineers and scientists,</p>
<p>or is it gonna be both?</p>
<p>Because my experience of scientists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, you know, they like the comfort of the lab.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, well, no, there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>I keep contradicting myself nonstop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some badass scientists that travel to Antarctica</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, so.</p>
<p>It says evolutionary selection for humans</p>
<p>who can stare at a screen for eight hours at a time,</p>
<p>or pipette for 12 hours at a time,</p>
<p>and not talk to anybody.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not surprising when our scientists</p>
<p>are a little bit awkward in social situations.</p>
<p>But we can get them, we can train them out of that.</p>
<p>We can get them to engage other humans,</p>
<p>not all of them, but hopefully most of them.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, I think the culture</p>
<p>will definitely be different.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be different dialects, different foods.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be different values.</p>
<p>There very likely will be a different religion.</p>
<p>Kim Stanley Robinson wrote a lot about this in his books,</p>
<p>the new Martian religion that was created.</p>
<p>So I think this idea has been discussed</p>
<p>in science fiction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost unavoidable, because there&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>I mean, just think of all the religions</p>
<p>that have happened on Earth with very little,</p>
<p>I think, I mean, there&rsquo;s just terrestrial drama,</p>
<p>but suddenly you have a different planet,</p>
<p>and a deity that would span multiple planets,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t even know how you do that,</p>
<p>but I think someone will think of a way</p>
<p>and make up something.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, look for ways to draw meaning.</p>
<p>So religion, for a lot of people,</p>
<p>myths, common ideas are a source of meaning,</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re on another planet,</p>
<p>boy, does the sense of what is meaningful change,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s humbling.</p>
<p>The harshness of the conditions is humbling.</p>
<p>The very practical fact that Earth,</p>
<p>from which you came, is not so special,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re clearly not on Earth currently,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing fine, and you made it.</p>
<p>At some point, I mean, it&rsquo;ll be pretty harsh,</p>
<p>like what Shackleton did doing this exploration</p>
<p>of Antarctica and going, it was a very dangerous mission,</p>
<p>barely made it, people died.</p>
<p>Actually, he didn&rsquo;t believe in scurvy at the time,</p>
<p>so he didn&rsquo;t take enough vitamin C,</p>
<p>and some of his people died from not having vitamin C,</p>
<p>so if we had had their genes active,</p>
<p>the pseudogene, they&rsquo;d be okay,</p>
<p>but there, I think, the early settlers will be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a very different crew,</p>
<p>but once it&rsquo;s comfort, once people are comfortable there,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re gonna, I hope they&rsquo;ll draw more meaning,</p>
<p>because more planets should be more meaning.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s like more hands is a better massage.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the best analogy here, but.</p>
<p>I think Aristotle said that, yeah.</p>
<p>I should mention that your book has incredible quotes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great writing, but also just incredible quotes</p>
<p>at the beginning of chapters that are really.</p>
<p>Thanks, well, it&rsquo;s basically my favorite quotes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, I&rsquo;m writing a book,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put my favorite quotes in there.</p>
<p>I might as well put them all down.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the efforts</p>
<p>of Elon Musk and SpaceX in pushing</p>
<p>this commercial spaceflight,</p>
<p>and I mean, other companies, Axiom Space as well?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on their efforts?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a gold rush.</p>
<p>Space Race 2.0, there&rsquo;s a lot of terms for it.</p>
<p>The new Space Race, I think it&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>I think it is, it&rsquo;s moving at a pace that is unprecedented,</p>
<p>and also there&rsquo;s a lot of investment</p>
<p>from the commercial and private sector pushing it forward,</p>
<p>so Elon, most notoriously, doing a lot of it</p>
<p>just himself with SpaceX, so we&rsquo;ve worked really closely</p>
<p>with the SpaceX ops teams and medical team,</p>
<p>planning the Inspiration4 mission,</p>
<p>and now some of the Polaris missions which are happening,</p>
<p>and Jared Isaacman has been a fabulous colleague,</p>
<p>collaborator, pilot for the missions.</p>
<p>You know, again, we&rsquo;re doing the same deep profiling</p>
<p>and molecular characterization of these astronauts</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve done for Scott Kelly and other astronauts</p>
<p>that are from NASA, and we&rsquo;re seeing so far,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a lot of this presented later this year,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s pretty safe.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s dangers.</p>
<p>We can see real stress on the body, very obvious changes,</p>
<p>some of the same changes that Scott Kelly experienced,</p>
<p>but for the most part, they return back to normal,</p>
<p>even for a short three-day mission.</p>
<p>I remember chatting with Jared,</p>
<p>and we were presenting the data to them</p>
<p>actually just a few weeks ago, kind of a briefing</p>
<p>to the crew, and because they went to 590 kilometers.</p>
<p>They went basically several hundred kilometers higher</p>
<p>than the space station or the Hubble normally rests,</p>
<p>more radiation, the farther you get from Earth,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more radiation.</p>
<p>He was worried, you know, did we get cooked?</p>
<p>It was kind of his question for me in the briefing.</p>
<p>I said, well, actually, it looks like</p>
<p>you can go back into the microwave.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get fully cooked.</p>
<p>You can go a little bit farther.</p>
<p>So for the Polaris mission, they&rsquo;re gonna go even farther,</p>
<p>and then also, they&rsquo;ll open the hatch</p>
<p>and go on these new spacesuits that SpaceX are designing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be much nimbler, not as much of a giant,</p>
<p>you know, Dr. Octagon kind of spacesuit,</p>
<p>but really looks like just a nice spacesuit,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna go out into the vacuum of space.</p>
<p>And so, you know, pushing all the engineering</p>
<p>for these missions, which are privately funded,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s people who just say, I wanna go up in space</p>
<p>and see if I can push the limits, has been fabulous,</p>
<p>but I think the most fabulous part is Jared in particular,</p>
<p>but others, other commercial spaceflight drivers</p>
<p>like John Shoffner or Peggy Whitson</p>
<p>for the Axiom missions are coming to us,</p>
<p>scientists, researchers, saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just wanna go up into space just to hang out.</p>
<p>How much science can I get done when I&rsquo;m up there?</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>What experiments can I do?</p>
<p>Give me, you know, blood, tissue, urine, semen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you any biofluid, you know,</p>
<p>and I always email them back and say,</p>
<p>listen, every one of your cells is worthy of study.</p>
<p>I send, you know, so I have this really kind of creepy</p>
<p>geneticist email response, like,</p>
<p>I want all of your cells, you know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s true because there&rsquo;s so much we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I wanna learn as much as we can about it.</p>
<p>Every time I go up, anyone,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re doing it, you know, with NASA astronauts,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been some of this influx of new crews</p>
<p>that are willing to do almost anything, right?</p>
<p>So including, we did skin biopsies</p>
<p>for the Inspiration4 crew before and after spaceflight,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s never been done before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never seen the structure of the skin</p>
<p>and how it changes in response to microgravity</p>
<p>and also the microbes that change.</p>
<p>And so we have these beautiful images</p>
<p>of even the structure of skin changing</p>
<p>and the inflammation that we&rsquo;ve seen in,</p>
<p>like for Scott Kelly, for example,</p>
<p>we now have a molecule-by-molecule map</p>
<p>of what happens to skin, which has never been done before.</p>
<p>So there.</p>
<p>What are the interesting surprises there?</p>
<p>So one of the interesting things we can see,</p>
<p>the part of what&rsquo;s driving inflammation</p>
<p>is we can actually see macrophages</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s other dendritic cells,</p>
<p>like cells that are part of the immune system,</p>
<p>kind of creeping along towards the surface of the skin,</p>
<p>which is, now we know it&rsquo;s actually physically driving</p>
<p>the immune system as these cells</p>
<p>going and creating this inflammation,</p>
<p>which is what leads to some of the rashes.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t see as much in them as we saw, for example,</p>
<p>some of the signatures of Scott Kelly.</p>
<p>So we can see within the crew</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s getting more of a rash or not,</p>
<p>or who didn&rsquo;t experience any rash.</p>
<p>And some people had changes in vision.</p>
<p>Some people had other GI problems,</p>
<p>even looking at sort of what happens to the gut</p>
<p>and looking at the microbiome of the gut.</p>
<p>Other people didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we started to get a little bit predictive</p>
<p>about their medicine.</p>
<p>Right now we&rsquo;re just diagnosing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;d be good to say, if you&rsquo;re going into space,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s exactly what you need for each bacteria in your body.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you could maybe take to get rid of nausea</p>
<p>or other ways we could monitor you</p>
<p>to keep the inflammation down.</p>
<p>What does it take to prepare for one of these missions?</p>
<p>Because you mentioned some of the folks</p>
<p>are not necessarily lifelong astronauts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about more and more regular civilians.</p>
<p>What does it take physiologically</p>
<p>and psychologically to prepare for these?</p>
<p>They have to do a lot of the same training</p>
<p>that most astronauts do.</p>
<p>So a lot of it&rsquo;s in Hawthorne at SpaceX headquarters,</p>
<p>which if you can ever get a chance to do a tour,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, you can see all these giant rockets being built</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re drawing blood over there right next to them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really cool place.</p>
<p>But the training, they have to go through a lot of the ops,</p>
<p>a lot of the programming, just in case.</p>
<p>Most of the systems are automated</p>
<p>on the Dragon and other spacecraft, but just in case.</p>
<p>So they have to go through the majority of the training.</p>
<p>If you want to go to the space station,</p>
<p>as the Axiom missions are,</p>
<p>including John Shroffner,</p>
<p>you have to do training for some of the Russian modules.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t do that training,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not allowed to go</p>
<p>to the Russian part of the space station, apparently.</p>
<p>So right now, John Shroffner, for example,</p>
<p>unless he completes this additional training,</p>
<p>all in Russian, he&rsquo;s not allowed.</p>
<p>All in Russian?</p>
<p>Otherwise he has to learn enough Russian</p>
<p>to be, you know, just functional.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just technical, he also has to.</p>
<p>Enough, enough Russian.</p>
<p>And so, and if he doesn&rsquo;t learn,</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t go to that part of the space station.</p>
<p>So interesting things like that.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll be, you know, it&rsquo;s not that far.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, I can see it right there.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t float over to that capsule.</p>
<p>But technically he can&rsquo;t go, so, you know.</p>
<p>Is there a Chinese component to the</p>
<p>International Space Station?</p>
<p>Is there a collaboration there?</p>
<p>Sadly not, they&rsquo;re building their own space station.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re building a space station.</p>
<p>Actually, eventually there&rsquo;ll be probably</p>
<p>four space stations in orbit by 2028.</p>
<p>Some from the orbital reef, some from Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>Of course, Axiom is far ahead right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably gonna be done first.</p>
<p>But the extraordinary thing is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, unfortunately there&rsquo;s no collaboration</p>
<p>between the.</p>
<p>You see that as a negative,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the positive kind of competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, good question.</p>
<p>So maybe, for example, when we get different NASA grants,</p>
<p>you apply for a grant, you get to the lab,</p>
<p>it goes through Cornell, the grants office.</p>
<p>I have to sign, as a scientist, as the PI on the mission,</p>
<p>say, I promise I will move no funds or resources</p>
<p>or any staff to anyone in China</p>
<p>or work with anyone in China with these dollars</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re giving to the lab for this mission.</p>
<p>And so every other grant I get from the NASA, DOD,</p>
<p>or sorry, DO, let me go back to that.</p>
<p>Every other grant I get from, say, the NIH or the NSF,</p>
<p>even sometimes DOD, you don&rsquo;t have to promise</p>
<p>that you won&rsquo;t talk to anybody in China about it.</p>
<p>But for NASA alone, it&rsquo;s congressionally mandated.</p>
<p>You have to promise and sign all those paperwork</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t do anything with anyone in China about this.</p>
<p>And what I view as sad about that is I wanna at least</p>
<p>be able to chat with them about it</p>
<p>and know what they&rsquo;re up to.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t even go to a conference in China,</p>
<p>technically, with NASA funds about, say, space medicine</p>
<p>or engineering a new rocket.</p>
<p>I can go with personal funds, but I can&rsquo;t use those funds.</p>
<p>Like, you should be able to go to a conference</p>
<p>and in a friendly way talk shit to the other scientists.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re doing, like the way scientists do really well,</p>
<p>which is like they compliment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a backhanded compliment.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re doing a really good job here.</p>
<p>And then you kind of imply that you&rsquo;re doing a much</p>
<p>better job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core of competition.</p>
<p>You get jealous and then everybody&rsquo;s trying to improve.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re ultimately talking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ultimately collaborating closely.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re competing closely as opposed to in your own silos.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask in terms of preparing for space flight.</p>
<p>You know, I tweeted about this and I joked about it.</p>
<p>And I talk to Elon quite a lot these days.</p>
<p>What I tweeted was I&rsquo;d like to do a podcast in space one day.</p>
<p>And it was a silly thing,</p>
<p>because I was thinking, for some reason in my mind,</p>
<p>I was thinking 10, 20 years from now.</p>
<p>And then I realized like, wait, why not like now?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, just even seeing what Axiom is doing,</p>
<p>what Inspiration4 is doing, it&rsquo;s like regular civilians</p>
<p>could just start going up.</p>
<p>So let me ask you this question.</p>
<p>When do you think, we saw Jeff Bezos go out into orbit,</p>
<p>when do you think Elon goes up to space?</p>
<p>His thinking about this is it&rsquo;s partially responsible</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s safe, because he has such a direct engineering</p>
<p>roles in the running of multiple companies.</p>
<p>So at which point do you think,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your prediction for the year that Elon will go up?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;d probably go up by 2026, I would say.</p>
<p>Because the number of missions planned,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be several missions per year</p>
<p>through multiple space agencies and companies</p>
<p>that are really making low Earth orbit very routine.</p>
<p>And by go up, I think it might also, for example,</p>
<p>the Inspiration4 mission just went up</p>
<p>for three days in flight.</p>
<p>You know, and there was enough time to get up there,</p>
<p>do some experiments, enjoy the view, and then you came back.</p>
<p>The Axiom missions are a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s docking up in the space station,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a shared atmosphere.</p>
<p>So you have to follow all the ISS protocols.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about the Dragon capsule</p>
<p>and the Inspiration4 and some of these</p>
<p>what are called free flyer missions,</p>
<p>you can just launch into space.</p>
<p>You basically have your own little mini space station</p>
<p>for a few days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that big, right?</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d probably see him do first</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna see a lot more tests of those</p>
<p>in the next two, three years.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re already been demonstrated to be safe.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re not trying to go for 10 to 20 days</p>
<p>or months or years at a time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just up in space for a few days,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re in proper space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an orbital flight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a suborbital flight.</p>
<p>You could do a podcast from there, I think.</p>
<p>2026, I wonder how the audio works.</p>
<p>See, also, can you comment on 2026?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start getting ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start pushing him on this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite serious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating kind of-</p>
<p>Axiom 2 still has room.</p>
<p>You could go on that mission if you wanted.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll ask you about Axiom.</p>
<p>How strict are these?</p>
<p>So this seems surreal that civilians are traveling up.</p>
<p>So how much bureaucracy is there still in your experience</p>
<p>for the scientific?</p>
<p>I mean, I know it&rsquo;s a difficult question</p>
<p>to ask a scientist,</p>
<p>because you get to, you don&rsquo;t want to complain too much.</p>
<p>But how much, there&rsquo;s sometimes bureaucracy</p>
<p>with NSF and DOD and the funding</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>that kind of prevent you from being as free</p>
<p>as you might sometimes like to do all kinds</p>
<p>of wild experiments and crazy experiments.</p>
<p>Now, the benefit of that is that you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>any wild and crazy experiments that hurt people.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very important to put safety first,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a dance.</p>
<p>A little too much restrictions of bureaucracy</p>
<p>can hamper the flourishing of science.</p>
<p>A little too little of that can get some crazy scientists</p>
<p>to start doing unethical experiments.</p>
<p>Okay, that said, NASA and just space flight in general</p>
<p>is sort of famously very, very risk averse.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your sense currently about like,</p>
<p>even like doing a podcast, right?</p>
<p>A podcast, you know, unless it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, I think with mixed martial arts</p>
<p>is a pretty safe activity,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing the octagon version of your podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, just getting there and back</p>
<p>is the only real risky part, which is still risky.</p>
<p>But I think, you&rsquo;re not asking to do open heart surgery</p>
<p>in space, you&rsquo;re just saying, what if I do a podcast?</p>
<p>And I think-</p>
<p>Well, fun.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to ask to have fun.</p>
<p>And I feel like fun sounds dangerous, any kind of fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been extraordinary,</p>
<p>is that traditionally, yes,</p>
<p>I think most of the space agencies have been very,</p>
<p>by definition, bureaucratic,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re coming from the government.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve been that way for a really good reason,</p>
<p>is that safety, you know, in the early 60s,</p>
<p>we know almost nothing about the body in space,</p>
<p>except for some of the work that pilots had done</p>
<p>at really high altitudes.</p>
<p>So we really didn&rsquo;t know what at all to expect.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s good that there were decades of resolute focus</p>
<p>on just safety.</p>
<p>But now we know it&rsquo;s pretty safe.</p>
<p>We know the physiological responses.</p>
<p>We know what to expect.</p>
<p>We can also treat some of it.</p>
<p>Hopefully soon we&rsquo;ll treat a lot more of it.</p>
<p>But if you just wanna go up there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually, now it&rsquo;s just a question of cost.</p>
<p>Like imagine, I think the way you can view</p>
<p>a lot of the commercial spaceflight companies</p>
<p>is that if you have the funds,</p>
<p>you can basically plan the mission.</p>
<p>All the training they&rsquo;ll do is to help you get prepared</p>
<p>for how you run some of the instrumentation,</p>
<p>how you can fly the rocket to a limited degree,</p>
<p>and how to use some of the equipment.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, it&rsquo;s no longer a question</p>
<p>of years and years of training and selection,</p>
<p>this impossible-odds task of becoming an astronaut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frankly just a question of funds.</p>
<p>Expensive plane ride.</p>
<p>So how much, you mentioned Axiom.</p>
<p>Is it known how much it costs for the plane ride?</p>
<p>There is no official number,</p>
<p>and it depends on the mission, of course.</p>
<p>So if you ask them, often they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>well, how serious are you?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just wanna give out random numbers</p>
<p>to people.</p>
<p>But the numbers, because for example,</p>
<p>we propose one mission, we want a new twin study</p>
<p>where someone goes up and stays up there</p>
<p>for 500 to 550 days.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s basically gonna be up there</p>
<p>for the longest time ever,</p>
<p>to simulate the time it would take to get to Mars</p>
<p>and back for the shortest possible duration,</p>
<p>about 550 days.</p>
<p>Because if you went there and immediately turned around,</p>
<p>you could maybe make that mission.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a three-year mission.</p>
<p>And there, you&rsquo;re looking at the ranges of,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s 50 to $100 million in that ballpark range.</p>
<p>But the reason it&rsquo;s so variable is it depends.</p>
<p>What are you doing up there?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re up there, for example, for two years, basically,</p>
<p>almost two years, that&rsquo;s a long time</p>
<p>to just be in one spot, right?</p>
<p>So could you be doing some things</p>
<p>where your time is valuable?</p>
<p>So you can do experiments, and people pay for those,</p>
<p>and that defrays the cost.</p>
<p>Or you could build something, or you could do podcasts,</p>
<p>and maybe, you know, fundraise on the podcast.</p>
<p>And so as long as you, the reason the cost is variable</p>
<p>is because it depends, well, do you have all the money?</p>
<p>And you say, I wanna go and just sit in space</p>
<p>for two years and do nothing?</p>
<p>Well, then you have to pay for all that time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re up there if you wanna do things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I see the official AX-1 mission</p>
<p>was $55 million for a trip to the ISS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>
<p>It could be worse.</p>
<p>Wait, Sergey just posted a $35,000 price tag</p>
<p>per night, per person on the ISS.</p>
<p>Is that real?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>No, it sounds about right, that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a real hotel stay.</p>
<p>So to stay, oh, so interesting.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s costs with the docking</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from the perspective of Axiom,</p>
<p>the private company, or SpaceX,</p>
<p>or whoever is paying the cost in the short-term</p>
<p>and in the long-term.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the thing about a lot of that cost</p>
<p>is rocket fuel, a lot of it is the ride.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been on calls where Axiom&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey, SpaceX, give us to make it a little cheaper.</p>
<p>We can make it cheaper on our end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the cost, that is the rocket.</p>
<p>So SpaceX is giving Axiom a ride, in this case.</p>
<p>What is Axiom Space?</p>
<p>Can you speak to this particular private company?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their mission, what&rsquo;s their goal?</p>
<p>And what is the Axiom One mission that just went up?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the Axiom Space is a private spaceflight company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s building the first private space station.</p>
<p>They actually have seen the videos and footage</p>
<p>and hardware being put together,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re in the process of constructing it.</p>
<p>The hope is that by 2024, one of the first modules</p>
<p>will be up and connected to the ISS.</p>
<p>Eventually it&rsquo;ll be expanded, and then by 2028,</p>
<p>the plan is it&rsquo;ll be completely detached and free-floating.</p>
<p>And it will be, maybe even a little bit sooner,</p>
<p>depending on how fast it goes,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re building the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first private space station.</p>
<p>So if you want to have a wedding up there,</p>
<p>you just have to multiply the number of guests</p>
<p>times the number of nights,</p>
<p>and you could have a wedding up there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be very expensive, but if you want to do it,</p>
<p>you can do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can have a lab up there.</p>
<p>If you want to do experiments, you can do experiments.</p>
<p>You just figure out the cost.</p>
<p>If you want to have a beer up there,</p>
<p>you can make your own, brew your own beer.</p>
<p>And so this is the first beer made in space.</p>
<p>For some reason, you want to do it, you can pay for it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s opened up this space where,</p>
<p>if you can find the funds for it, you propose it.</p>
<p>You can probably just do it.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So what is the Axiom 1 mission that just went up?</p>
<p>Can you tell me what happened?</p>
<p>Axiom 1 is the first private,</p>
<p>the first commercial crew to go to the space station.</p>
<p>So Inspiration 4 was the first commercial private crew</p>
<p>to just go into space.</p>
<p>They went into space and actually did an orbital mission</p>
<p>for just about three days.</p>
<p>But Axiom 1 is the first, again, on the SpaceX rockets,</p>
<p>but launched up, docked to the space station.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re up there for about 10 days to do experiments,</p>
<p>to work with staff, actually just take some pictures.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a mission, actually doing a lot of experiments.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing almost 80 different experiments.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot of, it&rsquo;s very science heavy,</p>
<p>which I love as a scientist.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the ability to show that you can fundraise</p>
<p>and launch up a crew that&rsquo;s all privately funded</p>
<p>and then go to the space station.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s four people.</p>
<p>Yeah, four people.</p>
<p>And the Axiom 2 will also likely be four people.</p>
<p>The two that have been announced are</p>
<p>John Shroffner and Peggy Whitson.</p>
<p>Peggy Whitson&rsquo;s a already prior NASA astronaut,</p>
<p>has been at many times, done many experiments.</p>
<p>She knows the space station like her own house.</p>
<p>And we recently did a training with Peggy and John</p>
<p>in my lab at Cornell to get ready for some other</p>
<p>genomics experiments that we&rsquo;ll do on that mission.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re doing the experiments too.</p>
<p>What does it take to design an experiment,</p>
<p>and to run a design experiment here on Earth</p>
<p>that runs up there, and then also to actually do</p>
<p>the running of the experiment?</p>
<p>What are the constraints?</p>
<p>What are the opportunities?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>The biggest concern is what do you need for reagents</p>
<p>or materials, the liquids that you might use</p>
<p>for any experiment?</p>
<p>What if it floats away?</p>
<p>What if it gets in someone&rsquo;s eye?</p>
<p>Because things always float away in space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s notoriously panels in the space station</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t want to look behind</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got a little fungus.</p>
<p>Or food has gotten stuck there and sometimes found</p>
<p>months and months or years later.</p>
<p>Things float around.</p>
<p>The little things.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And so if you have anything you need to do your experiment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a liquid or a solid, whatever that is,</p>
<p>it has to go through toxicity testing.</p>
<p>And the big question is if this thing,</p>
<p>whatever you want to use, gets in someone&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>will they lose their vision or be really injured?</p>
<p>And if the answer is yes, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>It just means if the answer is yes,</p>
<p>you have to then go through multiple levels of containment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a glove box on the space station</p>
<p>where you can actually do experiments</p>
<p>that have triple layers of containment.</p>
<p>So you can still use some harsh reagents,</p>
<p>but you have to do them in that glove box.</p>
<p>And so, but you can propose almost anything.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is the weight.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a heavy, it&rsquo;s $10,000 per kilogram</p>
<p>to get something up into space.</p>
<p>So if you have a big, heavy object,</p>
<p>that is some cost you have to consider.</p>
<p>And that includes the, not just the materials,</p>
<p>but the equipment used to analyze the materials.</p>
<p>One of the ones we worked on actually with Kate Rubins</p>
<p>was putting the first DNA sequencer in space</p>
<p>called the Biomolecule Sequencer Mission.</p>
<p>Also with Aaron Burton and Sarah Castor Wallace.</p>
<p>But there, the interesting thing is</p>
<p>we had to prepare this tiny little sequencer.</p>
<p>It sequences DNA, you can do it really quickly</p>
<p>within really minutes.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s extraordinary is you have to do,</p>
<p>if you want to get a piece of machinery up there,</p>
<p>you have to do destructive testing.</p>
<p>So you have to destroy it and see what happens.</p>
<p>How does it destroy it?</p>
<p>Do pieces, little pieces of glass break everywhere?</p>
<p>If so, that&rsquo;s a problem, so you have to redesign it.</p>
<p>And do fire testing, how does it burn?</p>
<p>How does your device explode in a fire, or doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>You have to test that, and then you do vibration testing.</p>
<p>So you have to basically,</p>
<p>if you want to fly one thing into space,</p>
<p>you need to make four of them and destroy</p>
<p>at least three of them to know how they destroy.</p>
<p>Destructive, fire, and then vibration testing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like-</p>
<p>Just asking for a friend,</p>
<p>how do you, from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p>do destructive testing?</p>
<p>And how do you do fire testing,</p>
<p>and how do you do vibration testing?</p>
<p>Vibration, just large shakers.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s mostly to simulate launch.</p>
<p>They have a lot of machinery at NASA and at SpaceX</p>
<p>to just make sure, does the thing completely fall apart</p>
<p>if it has a high vibrational,</p>
<p>essentially force attached to it?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just kind of like a big shaker.</p>
<p>Fire testing is just to simulate what would happen</p>
<p>if there was a normal fire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that gets up to,</p>
<p>fire temperature is several hundred degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>And does-</p>
<p>Open fire, or are we talking like you put in a toaster?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s more like-</p>
<p>Is it heat, or is it actual flames?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s flames and heat,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like a kiln or anything like that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to know how does it burn in a kiln.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more, is it flammable, is the first big question.</p>
<p>Like, does it just start on fire?</p>
<p>If it gets a little bit of flame on it,</p>
<p>does it just light up like a Christmas tree?</p>
<p>Is there a YouTube video of this?</p>
<p>You know, actually-</p>
<p>Did you film any of this?</p>
<p>Not, not, no.</p>
<p>Aaron Burton might still have some of the videos.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of doing some testing</p>
<p>for the new sequencer called the Mark 1C.</p>
<p>So I will make videos of that.</p>
<p>I would love to see that for,</p>
<p>if anything, for my private collection.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>This is very exciting.</p>
<p>And the destructive testing is just often,</p>
<p>it can be something as simple as a hammer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, how does it shatter?</p>
<p>You want to question, are there glass components, and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like office space.</p>
<p>That scene with the fax machine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We blow into the,</p>
<p>damn, it feels good to be a gangster soundtrack.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great scene.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so, that&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best of engineering, is that kind of testing.</p>
<p>What else about designing experiments?</p>
<p>Like, what kind of stuff do you want to get in there?</p>
<p>You said 80 different experiments.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re staying in the realm of biology and genetics?</p>
<p>Yep, for now.</p>
<p>But we also want to do,</p>
<p>some of the experiments that have been discussed in the lab</p>
<p>and some that are being planned as well.</p>
<p>But I think the most controversial one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s come up in our planning,</p>
<p>it gets back to sex in space,</p>
<p>is can human embryos divide</p>
<p>and actually begin to develop in space?</p>
<p>But then if we do that experiment,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re taking viable human embryos,</p>
<p>watching them develop in space.</p>
<p>Then you could freeze them</p>
<p>and bring them down and characterize them to see.</p>
<p>But to answer that question,</p>
<p>because we actually don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>can a human embryo actually develop well in zero gravity?</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But to find that out,</p>
<p>that means we&rsquo;d have to literally sacrifice embryos,</p>
<p>probably, which itself has, of course,</p>
<p>a lot of complications, ethical considerations.</p>
<p>Some people just wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a non-starter for lots of people.</p>
<p>But we do know that the sperm survives in space,</p>
<p>as you earlier said.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And nobody cares about sperm, apparently.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing several studies</p>
<p>on autism risk for fathers and sperm.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really easy to get sperm, I&rsquo;ll just tell you.</p>
<p>People say, you&rsquo;re helping us out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I hear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I read that somewhere on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Are you involved in Axiom 1, Axiom 2 experiments?</p>
<p>Like, what is your lab directly</p>
<p>or indirectly involved with in terms of experiment design?</p>
<p>What are you excited about,</p>
<p>different experiments that are happening out there?</p>
<p>Some of them, we&rsquo;re doing a lot of the direct training</p>
<p>for the crews.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really saying,</p>
<p>how do you do a modern genetics experiment?</p>
<p>So for the Axiom 1,</p>
<p>for Inspiration 4 and Axiom 1,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also collaborating with Trish,</p>
<p>which is the translational research arm for NASA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in Houston.</p>
<p>And there, it&rsquo;s a lot of sharing of samples and data</p>
<p>for all these missions.</p>
<p>Basically, for all the commercial spaceflight missions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a repository where you can look at the data</p>
<p>from the astronauts.</p>
<p>You can look at some of the genetic information,</p>
<p>some of the molecular changes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s being built up with Trish,</p>
<p>which has been fabulous collaboration</p>
<p>between Cornell and Trish.</p>
<p>But the other thing we&rsquo;re doing is for Axiom 2</p>
<p>is training them.</p>
<p>How do you, for example, if you want to look at a virus,</p>
<p>you can take a swab of something, extract it, sequence it,</p>
<p>and say, do I have Omicron?</p>
<p>Or do I have a different virus?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna do some of the exact same work in flight,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re having the astronauts do the extraction,</p>
<p>the sequencing, and the analysis of all the molecules.</p>
<p>And so one common occurrence is herpes</p>
<p>is reactivated often in spaceflight, oral herpes.</p>
<p>So you can see that viral reactivation</p>
<p>is one of the biggest kind of mysteries in spaceflight,</p>
<p>where the immune system seems to be responding a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s active, the body&rsquo;s really perturbed,</p>
<p>but viruses start shedding again.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really, and this happens clinically.</p>
<p>And we see this for, for example, hepatitis C</p>
<p>or hepatitis B, you can get infected with it</p>
<p>and it can stay in your body for decades</p>
<p>and still kind of be hiding in the body.</p>
<p>And in this case, we see it in spaceflight,</p>
<p>herpes comes back.</p>
<p>So we want to figure out, is it there, first of all,</p>
<p>and then when is it happening and characterize it better,</p>
<p>but have the astronauts do it themselves</p>
<p>rather than collecting it and bringing it back to Earth</p>
<p>and figuring out later.</p>
<p>We could see in real time how it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And then also look at their blood.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see what is changing in their blood in real time</p>
<p>with these new sequencers.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited about the genomics in space, if you will.</p>
<p>So clearly somebody that loves robots,</p>
<p>how many robots are up there in space</p>
<p>that help with the experiments?</p>
<p>Like what, how much technology is there, would you say?</p>
<p>Is it really a manual activity</p>
<p>or is there a lot of robots helping out?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>So far, it&rsquo;s almost all manual,</p>
<p>just because the robots have to all undergo</p>
<p>the destructive fire and vibrational testing.</p>
<p>So if you have a million-</p>
<p>This is so exciting.</p>
<p>So if you can get-</p>
<p>That thing is a lot less than a million.</p>
<p>So we could destroy it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re definitely gonna test it out for the,</p>
<p>I guess in which order,</p>
<p>and they have to do separate for each one.</p>
<p>Yeah, each one, yeah, yes.</p>
<p>Vibration, fire.</p>
<p>Note to self, do fire testing for the legged robots</p>
<p>and the destructive testing.</p>
<p>That would be fascinating.</p>
<p>I wonder if any of the folks I&rsquo;m working with</p>
<p>did that kind of testing on the materials.</p>
<p>Like what breaks first with the robots?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very key question.</p>
<p>And also, the big question.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting about this,</p>
<p>for Axiom and for these commercial spaceflight areas,</p>
<p>if you can fund it, you could fly it, right?</p>
<p>So if you have to say,</p>
<p>I wanna fly these series of robots up</p>
<p>because I think they could help build something</p>
<p>or they could help measure or repair the spacecraft.</p>
<p>Oh, you have to come up with a good reason.</p>
<p>Well, for NASA, you have to have a good reason,</p>
<p>but I think for private spaceflight,</p>
<p>you could have the reason is I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>and that could just be-</p>
<p>Exactly, curiosity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a private fund or I&rsquo;ve got your own money.</p>
<p>And then you pay per kilogram, essentially.</p>
<p>There are some things.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say, I wanna send a nuclear bomb up there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that would fly, but you-</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably rules</p>
<p>in terms of free-floating robots, right?</p>
<p>They probably have to be attached.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an orchestra that plays together.</p>
<p>All the experiments that are up there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably, it&rsquo;s not silos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not separate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re separate kind of things.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s all mostly manual.</p>
<p>How much electronics is there</p>
<p>in terms of data collection,</p>
<p>in terms of all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>A lot of electronics.</p>
<p>So a lot of it&rsquo;s tablets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s laptops up there.</p>
<p>The whole space station is running</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s humming on electronics.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the biggest complaints astronauts have</p>
<p>is sleeping up there is hard,</p>
<p>not only because you&rsquo;re in zero gravity,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a consistent loud hum of the space station.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things active and humming and moving</p>
<p>that are keeping the station alive.</p>
<p>The CO2 scrubbers, all the instrumentation, it&rsquo;s loud.</p>
<p>So I think it is a very well-powered lab, basically,</p>
<p>in flight, but the future space stations,</p>
<p>I think, will be very different</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re being built more for pleasure than business,</p>
<p>or a little bit of both.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re built for, we want people to,</p>
<p>at least when you talk to Axiom,</p>
<p>when you talk to the other industry partners,</p>
<p>they wanna make space more fun and engaging</p>
<p>and open to new ideas.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s looking at the fun stuff</p>
<p>going on in the next few years.</p>
<p>But if we zoom out once again,</p>
<p>how and when do we get outside of the solar system?</p>
<p>You mentioned this before.</p>
<p>Or maybe you can mention the other hops we might take.</p>
<p>You know what, let&rsquo;s step back a little.</p>
<p>Where are some of the fun places we might visit first</p>
<p>in a semi-permanent way inside the solar system</p>
<p>that you think are worth visiting?</p>
<p>Yeah, at the end of 500 years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping we make the big launch</p>
<p>towards another solar system,</p>
<p>really driven by the fact that we now actually</p>
<p>have exoplanets that we know we might be able to get to</p>
<p>and survive on, whereas 20 years ago,</p>
<p>we really had almost none,</p>
<p>certainly none that we knew were habitable.</p>
<p>And exoplanets even just discovered</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t start to happen until 89 and early 90s</p>
<p>for the real validated ones.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping over the next 500 years,</p>
<p>we go from thousands of possible habitable planets</p>
<p>to hundreds of thousands or millions,</p>
<p>especially with some of the recent telescopes launched,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll find them.</p>
<p>But before we get there, I have a whole section</p>
<p>I really describe about the magic of Titan</p>
<p>because it has all this methane,</p>
<p>which is a great hydrocarbon you can use to make fuel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cold as all bejesus on Titan, but if you can-</p>
<p>Ice.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s Titan made up of?</p>
<p>What is Titan?</p>
<p>Everybody loves Titan.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a favorite, I mean, it&rsquo;s this kind of eerie,</p>
<p>green-hued moon that&rsquo;s around Saturn</p>
<p>that is, to our knowledge, you know, this large,</p>
<p>it has like, you know, so cold,</p>
<p>it has these methane lakes</p>
<p>where the methane normally is a gas,</p>
<p>but there it actually would be so cold</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a lake of methane.</p>
<p>You could go swimming in it, potentially.</p>
<p>There might be some degree of rocks</p>
<p>or maybe mountains there,</p>
<p>but they might also be made of like frozen methane.</p>
<p>So no one&rsquo;s ever, no person&rsquo;s obviously been there,</p>
<p>but it is, you know, I have enough satellite imagery</p>
<p>and some data that you could actually</p>
<p>potentially survive on Titan.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;d be one place where I&rsquo;m hoping</p>
<p>that we would at least have a bit of an outpost.</p>
<p>It might not be a luxurious retreat</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really cold.</p>
<p>Is there a life on Titan, you think,</p>
<p>underneath the surface somewhere?</p>
<p>Maybe, well, actually, with all that carbon</p>
<p>and all those hydrocarbons,</p>
<p>it is very possible that some microbial life could be there</p>
<p>and hanging out, waiting for us to dip our toes</p>
<p>into the methane and find it.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know yet,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s one place I&rsquo;d like to see an outpost.</p>
<p>I would like to see other outposts near Jupiter,</p>
<p>but Jupiter has extremely high radiation, actually.</p>
<p>So even places like Io,</p>
<p>which are volcanically active and quite amazing,</p>
<p>we probably couldn&rsquo;t survive that long</p>
<p>or that close to Jupiter, though,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a giant planet.</p>
<p>It emits back out a lot of radiation</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s collecting from other parts of the universe</p>
<p>and it juts back out.</p>
<p>So if you get too close to Jupiter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d actually almost certainly not be able to survive,</p>
<p>depending on which part of it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one risk about Jupiter.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;d be cool to see the giant red spot up close,</p>
<p>maybe have some spots there.</p>
<p>Mars is top one.</p>
<p>Then we get to pick Titan or Io,</p>
<p>so ice, firing ice,</p>
<p>the Robert Frost poem comes to mind.</p>
<p>And then Europa, is that?</p>
<p>Europa would be cool, too, and Enceladus,</p>
<p>which is a big ocean that might be there,</p>
<p>like an alien ocean that&rsquo;s under the,</p>
<p>might be even water ice that&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>and even liquid water potentially there under the surface.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;d be a great candidate.</p>
<p>The asteroids of Ceres would be good,</p>
<p>or Eros, big enough you get a little bit of gravity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be interesting.</p>
<p>You could have maybe a habitable place there.</p>
<p>And they just might be big enough</p>
<p>that you could get there, survive,</p>
<p>and even have a tiny bit of gravity, but not much.</p>
<p>Why do you like asteroids?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Are you just, we&rsquo;re just listing vacation spots.</p>
<p>Yeah, vacation spots, basically, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, well, so they probably have</p>
<p>a lot of rare earth minerals</p>
<p>that you could use for manufacturing,</p>
<p>which is why part of the space economy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being built up now is people really wanna go</p>
<p>and hollow out the asteroids and bring back all the,</p>
<p>all the resources from it.</p>
<p>So this legally is very possible,</p>
<p>because even though the Space Act</p>
<p>prevents people from militarizing space</p>
<p>or owning all of it,</p>
<p>if you get the resources out of an asteroid,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t actually say you own it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still, that&rsquo;s perfectly legal.</p>
<p>So you could.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Space Act?</p>
<p>Space Act of 1967 was the first large-scale agreement</p>
<p>between major international parties,</p>
<p>particularly the US and Russia, but also many others,</p>
<p>to say that space should be a place for humanities</p>
<p>to not militarize it, to not weaponize it,</p>
<p>to not militarize it,</p>
<p>also establish some of the basic sharing principles</p>
<p>between countries who are going into space.</p>
<p>And there was a plan to make an additional act in the 90s,</p>
<p>the Lunar, actually I&rsquo;m blanking on the name of it,</p>
<p>but there hasn&rsquo;t been any significant legislation</p>
<p>that has been universally accepted since the Space Act.</p>
<p>So, but the primary focus was on the militarization.</p>
<p>The militarization.</p>
<p>Which was, in theory, not allowed,</p>
<p>which so far has stayed true, but.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no, is there any legal framework</p>
<p>for who owns space and space?</p>
<p>Like, different geographical regions of space,</p>
<p>both out in space and on asteroids and planets and moons?</p>
<p>Currently, you can&rsquo;t own,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to be able to own.</p>
<p>I mean, people have tried to sell bits of the moon,</p>
<p>for example, or sell names of stars,</p>
<p>which is pretty harmless.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not supposed to be able to own</p>
<p>any part of the moon, or an asteroid, for that matter.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re allowed to mine the resources from it.</p>
<p>So, in theory, you could go catch an asteroid,</p>
<p>hollow out the whole thing, like you eat an orange,</p>
<p>and leave the shell, and say, okay, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I never owned it, but I just extracted</p>
<p>everything inside of it, and now I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>
<p>And then, probably.</p>
<p>Of course, you see there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>some contentious battles, even wars, over those resources.</p>
<p>Hopefully, at a very small scale,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like conflict, or human tension, but.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like war makes for human flourishing,</p>
<p>like after the war, somehow.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there&rsquo;s just this explosion of conflict,</p>
<p>and afterwards, for a long while, there&rsquo;s a flourishing.</p>
<p>And again, conflict and flourishing,</p>
<p>and hopefully, over a stretch of millennia,</p>
<p>the rate of conflict, and the destructiveness</p>
<p>of conflict decreases.</p>
<p>It has, at least in the past 100 years,</p>
<p>the number of wars, number of military actions,</p>
<p>casualties, have all decreased.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna stay that way for humanity.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know, the trajectory&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I think the warmongering is less tolerated</p>
<p>by the international community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more scrutinized.</p>
<p>It still happens.</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s an ongoing war</p>
<p>between Russia and Ukraine, and you&rsquo;ve spoken</p>
<p>a lot about it, and it&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there sometimes will be small military actions,</p>
<p>but I think the, and even there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a large military action across most of the country,</p>
<p>but not all of it, actually, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I think we see less over time</p>
<p>of large-scale, multi-country invasions,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve seen in the past.</p>
<p>I think maybe that won&rsquo;t happen ever again,</p>
<p>but you might see country-to-country battles happening,</p>
<p>which has always happened, I think,</p>
<p>but hopefully, less of that as well.</p>
<p>And yet, the destructiveness of our weapons increases,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a complicated race in both directions.</p>
<p>We become more peaceful and more destructive</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>How do we get outside the solar system?</p>
<p>You write an epic line, I believe it&rsquo;s the title</p>
<p>of one of the sections, Launch Toward the Second Sun.</p>
<p>That journey of saying we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>somehow the solar system feels like home.</p>
<p>Earth is home, but the solar system is home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our sun.</p>
<p>The sun is a source of life.</p>
<p>And going towards the second sun, leaving this home behind,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one hell of a journey.</p>
<p>So what does that journey look like?</p>
<p>When does it happen, and what&rsquo;s required to make it happen?</p>
<p>To get to that state, we have to actually have,</p>
<p>describe a number of options.</p>
<p>We have to all have people survive</p>
<p>in multiple generations, live and die</p>
<p>on the same spacecraft towards another star.</p>
<p>Propulsion technology, you need to have that in place.</p>
<p>I assume we don&rsquo;t have dramatic improvements.</p>
<p>I describe ways it could happen, like antimatter drives</p>
<p>or things that could make it possible to go faster.</p>
<p>But since it&rsquo;s a book of nonfiction,</p>
<p>I just make no big leaps other than what we know of today</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;d need probably 20 generations</p>
<p>to live and die on one spacecraft to make it towards</p>
<p>what is our known closest habitable exoplanet.</p>
<p>Now that sounds, you know, so you need to have</p>
<p>the life support, self-reliance, self-sustainability</p>
<p>all in that one, it&rsquo;d be a large spacecraft.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to grow your own food,</p>
<p>probably still have some areas with gravity.</p>
<p>It would be complicated, but I think after 500 years,</p>
<p>we could actually have the technology and the means</p>
<p>and the understanding of biology to enable that.</p>
<p>And so with that as a backdrop,</p>
<p>you could have people hibernate and talk about like,</p>
<p>maybe they need to hibernate instead of just people</p>
<p>living their normal life.</p>
<p>But I think the hibernation technology</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work that well yet.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it might pan out</p>
<p>and maybe in 200 years, it gets really good</p>
<p>and then people can all just sleep in pods.</p>
<p>Great, you know, so I think this is the minimum</p>
<p>viable product with everything that we have today</p>
<p>and nothing else, right?</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s the case, which of course,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure of more than 500 years,</p>
<p>but based on what we know today,</p>
<p>you have people live and die on the spacecraft.</p>
<p>And that sounds almost like a prison sentence.</p>
<p>You say, if you were born into a spacecraft</p>
<p>and when you got old enough age, you said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re, yes, you can tell we&rsquo;re on a spacecraft.</p>
<p>You will live your whole life on this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say something the size of a building.</p>
<p>And this is everyone you&rsquo;ll ever know.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll die and then your children</p>
<p>will also carry on the mission.</p>
<p>Would those people feel proud and excited to say,</p>
<p>we are the vanguard and hope of humanity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going towards a new sun and maybe they&rsquo;d love it.</p>
<p>Or would they, after 10 generations,</p>
<p>maybe they would rebel and say, to hell with this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of being in this prison.</p>
<p>This is a bad idea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re turning around or we&rsquo;re going somewhere else</p>
<p>or a mutiny happens and they kill each other, right?</p>
<p>So we would have to really make sure that the mental health,</p>
<p>the structure of the society is built</p>
<p>so they could sustain that mission.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crazy mission,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that much different from spaceship Earth, right?</p>
<p>Here we are stuck on one planet.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have planetary liberty.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t go to another planet right now.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even really go to another moon that easily.</p>
<p>So we, and I love Earth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of wonderful things here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still just this one planet and we&rsquo;re stuck on it.</p>
<p>So everyone that you know and love and live with here</p>
<p>will be dead someday and that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ll ever know too.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a difference of scale,</p>
<p>not a difference of type in terms of an experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s still a spaceship traveling out in space.</p>
<p>Earth is still a spaceship traveling out in space.</p>
<p>So it is a kind of prison.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always, everybody lives in a prison.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a limited planetary experience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>Prison sounds so dark, but.</p>
<p>Just, yeah, just like prison is a limited geographic</p>
<p>and culinary experience.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want it to be viewed that way.</p>
<p>I want to think, wait, this is,</p>
<p>what an extraordinary gift.</p>
<p>And we wouldn&rsquo;t probably just launch one generation ship.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d probably launch 10 or 20 of them,</p>
<p>the different, the best candidates and hopefully get there.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, the fact is limitations and constraints</p>
<p>make life fascinating because the human mind</p>
<p>somehow struggles against those constraints.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how beauty is created.</p>
<p>So there is kind of a threshold,</p>
<p>being stuck in one room is different</p>
<p>than being stuck in a building</p>
<p>and being stuck in a city, being stuck in like,</p>
<p>I wonder what the threshold of people,</p>
<p>I lived for a long time in a studio</p>
<p>and then I upgraded gloriously to a one bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>And the power to be able to like close the door.</p>
<p>It was magnificent, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, wow, you can speak volumes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can escape, that feels like freedom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of freedom,</p>
<p>having a door where you could close it</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re alone with your thoughts</p>
<p>and then you can open it and you enter</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s other humans as freedom.</p>
<p>So the threshold of what freedom,</p>
<p>the experience of freedom is like is really fascinating.</p>
<p>And like you said, there could be technologies</p>
<p>in terms of hibernation.</p>
<p>VR, ultra reality, virtual reality.</p>
<p>Because 30 years ago, that sounded awful.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be stuck in a spacecraft</p>
<p>but now you could bring the totality</p>
<p>of all of human history, culture, every music,</p>
<p>every bit of music, song, every movie, every book</p>
<p>can all be in one tablet basically, right?</p>
<p>So, and also you&rsquo;d still get updates from Netflix</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on the way towards another star.</p>
<p>You could still get downloads and so,</p>
<p>but eventually maybe the crew</p>
<p>would start to make their own shows.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like, well, I don&rsquo;t want the Earth shows.</p>
<p>I wanna talk about, I&rsquo;m gonna make a drama</p>
<p>on this spacecraft.</p>
<p>But I think it would have to be big enough</p>
<p>so it feels like at least the size of a building.</p>
<p>I think people&rsquo;s intuitions about quarantining</p>
<p>have really become very immediate</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve all had to experience it</p>
<p>to some degree in the past two years.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve survived, but definitely we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>that you need a really good internet connection.</p>
<p>You need some ability to go somewhere sometimes.</p>
<p>And that might just be as simple</p>
<p>as people leaving the spacecraft</p>
<p>to go to something that&rsquo;s another thing connected to it</p>
<p>or just go out into the vacuum of space</p>
<p>for an afternoon to experience it.</p>
<p>So people need recreation.</p>
<p>People need games.</p>
<p>People need toys.</p>
<p>People love to play.</p>
<p>What are chloro-humans?</p>
<p>Chloro-humans is a description</p>
<p>of how you can embed chloroplasts into human skin</p>
<p>or the thing that makes plants green</p>
<p>so they can absorb light from the sun</p>
<p>and then get all their energy that way.</p>
<p>Of course, humans don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>but I describe in the book in the far future,</p>
<p>maybe 300, 400 years from now,</p>
<p>if we could work on the ways</p>
<p>that animals and plants work together,</p>
<p>you could embed chloroplasts in human skin.</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>you go outside and you lay out your skin</p>
<p>and then you absorb sunlight</p>
<p>and then you go back in when you get full.</p>
<p>If you only wanted to lay outside for just say one hour</p>
<p>to get your day&rsquo;s fully value of energy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d need about two tennis courts worth of skin</p>
<p>that you could lay out</p>
<p>and maybe your friends would plant it or something.</p>
<p>But if they plant it,</p>
<p>then their shadows would block your sun.</p>
<p>So maybe you&rsquo;d leave your skin out there</p>
<p>and you could roll up your skin,</p>
<p>go back inside after about one hour</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how much skin you would need to have exposed</p>
<p>with some reasonable assumptions</p>
<p>about the light capture and efficiency of the chloroplast.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just kind of a fun concept in the book</p>
<p>of green humans going around,</p>
<p>absorbing light from the sun.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve dreamed about since I was a kid.</p>
<p>Is there engineering ways of like</p>
<p>having that much skin</p>
<p>and being able to laying it out efficiently?</p>
<p>Like is there, it sounds absurd, but.</p>
<p>You could roll it up, it would be.</p>
<p>I mean, or you could just lay outside longer.</p>
<p>I wanted to think if you just had one hour</p>
<p>and how much skin would you need.</p>
<p>But if you just went out there for four hours,</p>
<p>you need something that&rsquo;s smaller,</p>
<p>but you know, so it&rsquo;s a half a tennis court.</p>
<p>So you could make it.</p>
<p>Could be like wings.</p>
<p>Could be like wings. Gigantic wings.</p>
<p>And you lay them out there.</p>
<p>But also, that&rsquo;s if you needed all your energy</p>
<p>only from your skin.</p>
<p>So if you just get a little bit of it, your energy,</p>
<p>of course you could just walk around with your skin as is.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d still have to eat, but not as much.</p>
<p>And I describe that because we&rsquo;d need other ways</p>
<p>to think about making your own energy</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on a really long mission that&rsquo;s far from stars.</p>
<p>You could turn on a lamp that would give you</p>
<p>some of that essentially exact wavelength of light</p>
<p>you need for your chloroplast and your skin.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m hoping</p>
<p>would happen in three to 400 years.</p>
<p>But it would be hard because you&rsquo;re taking a plant organelle</p>
<p>and putting it in an animal cell.</p>
<p>Which sounds weird, but we have mitochondria inside of us,</p>
<p>which basically where our cells capture the bacteria</p>
<p>and now it walks around with us all the time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s precedent for it in evolution.</p>
<p>How much, by the way, speaking of which,</p>
<p>does evolution help us here?</p>
<p>So we talked a lot about engineering.</p>
<p>You know, building, you know, genetically modifying humans</p>
<p>to make them more resilient or having mechanisms</p>
<p>for repairing parts of humans.</p>
<p>What about evolving humans or evolving organisms</p>
<p>that live on humans?</p>
<p>Sort of the thing you mentioned,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;ve already learned,</p>
<p>is that humans are pretty adaptable.</p>
<p>Now what does that mean?</p>
<p>You also, somewhere wrote that, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s trillions of cells that make up the human body.</p>
<p>And, you know, those are all organisms.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also very adaptable.</p>
<p>So can we leverage the natural process of evolution</p>
<p>of the slaughter, the selection, the mutation,</p>
<p>and the adaptation that is all in,</p>
<p>sorry to throw slaughter into there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just acknowledging that a lot of organisms</p>
<p>have to die in evolution.</p>
<p>Can we use that for long-term space travel</p>
<p>or colonization, occupation?</p>
<p>Is there a good word for this?</p>
<p>Of planets.</p>
<p>Like to terraform the planet?</p>
<p>Terraform the planet.</p>
<p>No, to adjust the human body to the planet.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s not really a term for that yet.</p>
<p>I guess to-</p>
<p>Adapt to the new vacation spot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I called it just the directed evolution in the book</p>
<p>is that you guide the evolution towards what you want.</p>
<p>In this case, sometimes you can engineer yourselves</p>
<p>to make exactly what you want,</p>
<p>but other times you put people on planets</p>
<p>and see how they change.</p>
<p>Actually, later in the book,</p>
<p>I imagine if you have humans on multiple planets,</p>
<p>you could have this virtuous cycle</p>
<p>where as people adapt and evolve here,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d sequence their DNA and see how they change</p>
<p>and then send the information back to the other planet</p>
<p>and then study them with more resources.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d be able to then have a continual exchange</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s evolving in which way on different planets</p>
<p>and then each planet would learn from the changes</p>
<p>that they see at the other planet.</p>
<p>Does the evolution happen at the scale of human</p>
<p>or do we need the individual,</p>
<p>or is it more efficient to do bacteria?</p>
<p>Bacteria are cheaper and faster and easier,</p>
<p>but we also have a lot of bacteria in us,</p>
<p>on us, and all around us,</p>
<p>and even the bacteria in the space station</p>
<p>are continually evolving.</p>
<p>Did you study that, by the way?</p>
<p>Like non-human cells, the microbiomes.</p>
<p>Yep, so we&rsquo;ve seen it for the astronauts.</p>
<p>We can actually see their immune system</p>
<p>respond to the microbiome of the space station.</p>
<p>So as soon as you get into that aluminum tube,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole ecosystem that&rsquo;s already up there</p>
<p>and we can actually see, we saw this with Scott Kelly,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen this with other astronauts,</p>
<p>you can see the T-cells in their body,</p>
<p>they actually are responding to little peptides,</p>
<p>the molecules of the bacteria,</p>
<p>the immune system is looking for a specific bacteria,</p>
<p>and then once it sees new ones, it remembers it,</p>
<p>and you can see the body looking for the microbes</p>
<p>that are only on the space station</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t see on Earth.</p>
<p>And then when Scott came back,</p>
<p>he actually had more of those microbes embedded in his skin</p>
<p>and in his mouth and stool that weren&rsquo;t there before.</p>
<p>So he like picked up new hitchhikers in the space station</p>
<p>and brought some of them back down with him.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like long-term ecosystems up in the space station.</p>
<p>20 years, they&rsquo;ve been up there for 20 years, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some Chuck Norris type of bacteria up there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re part of the Extreme Microbiome Project.</p>
<p>What does that involve and what kind of fun organisms</p>
<p>have you learned about, have you gotten to explore?</p>
<p>We have a really fun project, XMP,</p>
<p>the Extreme Microbiome, which is as it sounds like.</p>
<p>We look for really odd places,</p>
<p>like heavy radiation environments,</p>
<p>high salt, high or low temperature,</p>
<p>strange area of the space station, for example,</p>
<p>lots of radiation and microgravity.</p>
<p>Places where organisms can evolve</p>
<p>for interesting adaptations.</p>
<p>And some of them have been organisms we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>like a candy pink lake in Australia called Lake Hillier,</p>
<p>which we just published a paper on this.</p>
<p>Why is it pink?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually Denalia salinas,</p>
<p>one of these organisms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mixture of bacteria and some algae</p>
<p>that are there that make it bright pink.</p>
<p>So they actually make carotenoids,</p>
<p>these really sort of orangey and kind of pink molecules</p>
<p>when you look at them in the light.</p>
<p>So if you get enough of the bacteria, it becomes pink.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just pink, it&rsquo;s like bubblegum pink, the lake.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just an odd, it&rsquo;s a halophile,</p>
<p>means that it grows in 30% salt.</p>
<p>And if you go below 10, 15% salt, it doesn&rsquo;t even grow.</p>
<p>It actually kills it.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Yeah, there it is, Lake Hillier.</p>
<p>Is it toxic to humans or no?</p>
<p>So when you walk in the pink lake,</p>
<p>actually, it&rsquo;s so hypertonic, meaning it&rsquo;s so salty,</p>
<p>you can feel it lysing and killing your cells on your foot.</p>
<p>So it actually hurts to walk in because it&rsquo;s so salty.</p>
<p>So yeah, but it won&rsquo;t kill, it&rsquo;ll, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Listen, you have to suffer for art.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Great art requires suffering.</p>
<p>I mean, so it is a beautiful lake.</p>
<p>You have to get permits to go sample there,</p>
<p>but we actually just got an email last week.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s pilots who fly over this in Australia</p>
<p>because they love the color.</p>
<p>So he emailed us, one of the pilots,</p>
<p>and he said, hey, guys, I saw you publish this paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as pink as it used to be</p>
<p>because he loves flying over it,</p>
<p>and it was like a little bit less pink</p>
<p>because it had a bunch of rain in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>So it was just a little bit diluted.</p>
<p>So we reassured him it&rsquo;ll get more pink as they grow again.</p>
<p>But basically, yeah, it&rsquo;s a beautiful pink lake.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>That is gorgeous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a Dr. Seuss book or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it doesn&rsquo;t even look real.</p>
<p>Is it hard to get to?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no road.</p>
<p>You have to basically fly, land nearby it,</p>
<p>and then paddle in, but, so it&rsquo;s not next to anything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to get to.</p>
<p>But once you get there, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>If anyone knows how to get there, let me know.</p>
<p>I wanna go there.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>What are some other extreme organisms that you study?</p>
<p>Other ones, there&rsquo;s some organisms we&rsquo;ve studied</p>
<p>in the space station called Acinetobacter pitii,</p>
<p>which is often found in human skin,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve found hundreds of strains in the space station</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve brought down and curated and then sequenced.</p>
<p>And this is with Katsuri Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s at Jet Propulsion Laboratory working with him.</p>
<p>And they have evolved, so they no longer look</p>
<p>like any Earth-based Acinetobacter.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t look like, they&rsquo;re now basically a new species.</p>
<p>So actually, there&rsquo;s a different species of bacteria</p>
<p>and fungi that have now mutated so much</p>
<p>in the space station, they&rsquo;re literally a new species.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve found some of those that have just,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re evolving in, as life is always evolving,</p>
<p>and we can see it also in the space station.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an entirely new species born in the space station.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s completely different.</p>
<p>So we found one species, actually,</p>
<p>that we named after a donor to Cornell,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s donated funds for research.</p>
<p>So we named a different species of fungus after him,</p>
<p>Naganishia tolchinskia, because he&rsquo;s Igor Tolchinsky.</p>
<p>So as a thank you for him donating to Cornell,</p>
<p>we said, we&rsquo;ve named this fungus</p>
<p>that we found on the space station for you.</p>
<p>Was he grateful, or did he stop funding our research?</p>
<p>He was very grateful, and then, and I told him,</p>
<p>I said, if you have an ex-girlfriend,</p>
<p>we could try and name a genital fungus</p>
<p>after her or something, if you want.</p>
<p>And he said, yeah, he said maybe,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s convinced it needs some.</p>
<p>He stopped answering emails after that.</p>
<p>Okay, what about in extreme conditions,</p>
<p>in ice, in heat, is that something of interest to you,</p>
<p>in the things that survive where most things can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Yes, of keen interest.</p>
<p>I think that will be the roadmap</p>
<p>for some of the potential adaptations</p>
<p>we could think of for human cells,</p>
<p>or certainly for our human, the microbiome,</p>
<p>just all the microorganisms in and on and around us.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve seen, even there&rsquo;s this one crater,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the Lake of Fire, it&rsquo;s in Turkmenistan,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s been on fire because of oil</p>
<p>that had been set on fire decades ago,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still burning.</p>
<p>So we collected some samples from there,</p>
<p>and those were some Pseudomonas putida,</p>
<p>some species we found there that can.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s stuff alive there.</p>
<p>That seems to be surviving there by this large pit of fire.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, there it is, the desert.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been just on fire for decades, apparently.</p>
<p>What the?</p>
<p>So this is another place that we.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the Lake of Fire.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and they said.</p>
<p>Soviet scientists had set up a drilling rig here</p>
<p>for extraction of natural gas.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be in this part of the world</p>
<p>that you would get something like this,</p>
<p>but the rig collapsed,</p>
<p>and methane gas is being released from the crater.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for those just listening,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at a lake full of fire,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something alive there, allegedly.</p>
<p>And Pseudomonas are known to be</p>
<p>some of the most tough organisms.</p>
<p>They actually can clean toxic waste</p>
<p>from any areas of Superfund sites</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s so much waste that&rsquo;s been deposited.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find them there as well.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s one place in the Gowanus Canal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>in New York City in Brooklyn,</p>
<p>and it is a complete toxic waste dump.</p>
<p>That was where a lot of waste in the 1700s was dumped,</p>
<p>and so the gateway to hell is what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the nickname for the lake.</p>
<p>So the Gowanus Canal is also a place</p>
<p>that has been fun to sequence</p>
<p>and see Pseudomonas species that can survive there,</p>
<p>basically pulling toxins from the environment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if you create this toxic landscape,</p>
<p>and then evolution comes in and says,</p>
<p>oh, fine, I&rsquo;ll make things that can survive here.</p>
<p>And when you look at the biochemistry of those species,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;ve created is their own salvation, basically.</p>
<p>The selection has made them survivors,</p>
<p>and suddenly you can use that</p>
<p>to remediate other polluted sites, for example.</p>
<p>That explains Twitter perfectly.</p>
<p>The toxicity created adaptation</p>
<p>for the psychological microbiome that is social media.</p>
<p>Okay, beautiful, but you just actually jumped back</p>
<p>to the interstellar travel.</p>
<p>Assuming the technology of today, yes,</p>
<p>what are some wild innovations that might happen</p>
<p>in the space of physics or biology?</p>
<p>By the way, where do you think</p>
<p>is the most exciting breakthroughs</p>
<p>for interstellar travel</p>
<p>that will happen in the next 500 years?</p>
<p>Is it physics, is it biology, is it computer science?</p>
<p>So information or DNA,</p>
<p>like some kind of informational type of thing?</p>
<p>Is it biological, like physiological,</p>
<p>making the body resilient, live longer,</p>
<p>and resilient to the harsh conditions of space?</p>
<p>Or is it the actual vehicle of transport,</p>
<p>which would be applied physics?</p>
<p>As you can probably guess, I&rsquo;ll say all of the above.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question, never.</p>
<p>But to break those down, though,</p>
<p>I think the AI, I hope in the book later</p>
<p>that we would have really good machine companions,</p>
<p>that the AI, I really hope the AIs that we build,</p>
<p>realistically, we are the programmers who make them.</p>
<p>I would feel a colossal failure if we didn&rsquo;t make AI</p>
<p>that was embedded with a sense of duty</p>
<p>and caretaking and friendship and even creativity.</p>
<p>We have the opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve coded algorithms myself.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building them, so it&rsquo;s incumbent upon us</p>
<p>to actually make them not assholes, I think, frankly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d just be a error.</p>
<p>Actually, on that point, just to linger on the AI front,</p>
<p>can you steelman the case that Hal 9000</p>
<p>from Space Odyssey was doing the right thing?</p>
<p>So for people who haven&rsquo;t seen 2001 Space Odyssey,</p>
<p>Hal 9000 is very kind of focused on the mission,</p>
<p>cares a lot about the mission,</p>
<p>and kind of wants to hurt the astronauts</p>
<p>that try to get in the way of the mission.</p>
<p>I think he was doing what he was programmed to do,</p>
<p>which was just to follow the mission,</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t have a sense of anything broader,</p>
<p>duty, you could, I mean, he was.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the broader duty, exactly?</p>
<p>Maintaining the well-being of astronauts?</p>
<p>Yeah, or giving them another option.</p>
<p>I think he viewed them as completely expendable,</p>
<p>rather than say.</p>
<p>Not completely, it&rsquo;s a trade-off.</p>
<p>So a doctor has to make decisions like this, too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re restricted on the resources.</p>
<p>You have to make life and death decisions.</p>
<p>So maybe Hal 9000 had a long-term vision</p>
<p>of what is good for the civilization back at home.</p>
<p>Maybe a deontogenic vision of what was the best duty</p>
<p>for the genetics, you could say.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s deontogenic mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a word I made up in the book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what is your genetic duty?</p>
<p>When you think of your DNA,</p>
<p>what are you supposed to do with it?</p>
<p>Which is kind of the value of life.</p>
<p>But if Hal was a silicon-based version of genetics,</p>
<p>which is just his own maintenance of himself</p>
<p>and self-survival, you could argue</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing the right thing for himself.</p>
<p>A human in that circumstance might have tried</p>
<p>to find a way to, even if the astronauts don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with the mission, to figure out some way</p>
<p>to get them on a different spacecraft</p>
<p>to go away or something, versus just say,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re in the way of the mission,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just, you have to die.</p>
<p>But a combination can always be made,</p>
<p>to your point with doctors.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;d like to save three people,</p>
<p>but you can only save two,</p>
<p>and you have to at some point pick.</p>
<p>But I think, in that sense, it&rsquo;s a false dichotomy.</p>
<p>I think Hal wasn&rsquo;t programmed to</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t try to find a third solution.</p>
<p>Perhaps, let&rsquo;s say Stuart Russell proposes this idea</p>
<p>that AI systems should have self-doubt.</p>
<p>They should be always uncertain in their final decision,</p>
<p>and that would help Hal sort of get out of the local optimum</p>
<p>of this is the mission, always be a little bit like,</p>
<p>hmm, I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the right thing.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re forced to kind of contend</p>
<p>with other humans, with other entities,</p>
<p>on what is the right decision.</p>
<p>So the worst stuff, the worst thing about decisions,</p>
<p>from that perspective, is if you&rsquo;re extremely confident</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re stubborn and immovable.</p>
<p>Right, but programming doubt, that sounds complicated.</p>
<p>That sounds like.</p>
<p>You can go wrong so many ways.</p>
<p>You can go wrong either way.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too confident, you won&rsquo;t see the other options.</p>
<p>If you have too much doubt, you won&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be paralyzed by the options.</p>
<p>So you need some middle ground,</p>
<p>which I think is what most people experience every day,</p>
<p>is we all love the concept of being a steadfast,</p>
<p>resolute leader, making big decisions quickly</p>
<p>and without question, but at the same time,</p>
<p>we know people can be blinded to things they&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re too headstrong.</p>
<p>So how would you improve Hal 9000?</p>
<p>I think I would include other,</p>
<p>because Hal is one program, much like we do for humans.</p>
<p>You get feedback from other humans</p>
<p>before you make a decision that affects all of them.</p>
<p>So I think Hal could have gotten feedback</p>
<p>from other AI systems that said,</p>
<p>well, is this, are there other options here?</p>
<p>And done it probably very quickly.</p>
<p>Or you can even embed a programming system</p>
<p>where the AI has a primary function,</p>
<p>but at times of uncertainty,</p>
<p>queries a series of other programmed AIs</p>
<p>to ask for a consensus almost,</p>
<p>more like a democracy of the AI.</p>
<p>But since it&rsquo;s all programmed,</p>
<p>you could bring it all together</p>
<p>and say there&rsquo;s a primary,</p>
<p>but it only activates the parliament, if you will,</p>
<p>for a decision when needed.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know how you program</p>
<p>dramatically different AIs on one system</p>
<p>that are different enough,</p>
<p>but conceptually, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Of course, that can lead to log jam</p>
<p>and government and parliament doesn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>or Congress doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s trade-offs, but it&rsquo;s one idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Dave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>That, I find really compelling, the idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to set that up in my own life at some point.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re stuck there on a spaceship with an AI system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the two of you and you have to figure it out.</p>
<p>I love that challenge.</p>
<p>I love that almost a really deep human conflict</p>
<p>of through conversation have to arrive at something.</p>
<p>You really try to understand what survival is a stake.</p>
<p>You have to try to understand the other being.</p>
<p>Now, you think it&rsquo;s just a robot.</p>
<p>We keep saying like, it&rsquo;s just programmed.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>When you talk to another human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a bag of meat.</p>
<p>And then you disagree and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>everybody starts using terms like, how dumb can you be?</p>
<p>How ignorant can you be?</p>
<p>Come on, this is the right way.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>This is what you&rsquo;re talking about is insane.</p>
<p>And when the stakes go up, when it&rsquo;s life and death,</p>
<p>you have to convince another person.</p>
<p>First, you have to understand another person.</p>
<p>In this case, you have to understand the machine</p>
<p>without knowing how it was programmed.</p>
<p>Because as a programmer, even, I mean,</p>
<p>this is very much true for these Lego robots.</p>
<p>I really make sure that everything that&rsquo;s programmed</p>
<p>is sufficiently large and has a sufficient degree</p>
<p>of uncertainty where I&rsquo;m constantly surprised.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it works.</p>
<p>I kind of know how it works, but I&rsquo;m surprised constantly.</p>
<p>And there, there&rsquo;s a human component</p>
<p>of trying to figure each other out.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s high stakes.</p>
<p>Life and death.</p>
<p>Through conversation.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s actually what makes</p>
<p>a great companion out in space is like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re both in charge of each other&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>and you both don&rsquo;t quite know how each other works.</p>
<p>And also, you don&rsquo;t treat each other as a servant.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if Hal was treated that way a little bit,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, yeah, like a servant</p>
<p>as opposed to a friend, a companion, a teammate.</p>
<p>Because I think the worst part about treating an AI system</p>
<p>or another human being as a servant is what it does to you.</p>
<p>If you treat them as a means to an end</p>
<p>rather than end in of itself, then you&rsquo;ve debased them.</p>
<p>And like lessen the humanity in yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, at the same time.</p>
<p>Which is, I mean, that&rsquo;s why they talked about</p>
<p>kids have to be polite to Alexa.</p>
<p>Because they find if they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>if people are, if kids are rude to AI systems,</p>
<p>they actually, that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad sign, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad sign and it develops the wrong thing</p>
<p>in terms of how they treat other human beings.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s AI.</p>
<p>So what about physics?</p>
<p>Can we do, in terms of, can we travel</p>
<p>close to the speed of light?</p>
<p>Can we travel faster than the speed of light?</p>
<p>I would love to fold space.</p>
<p>We know wormholes are technically possible,</p>
<p>but we have no way to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see advanced wormhole technology,</p>
<p>antimatter drives.</p>
<p>Antimatter is notoriously missing</p>
<p>for most of the universe, so.</p>
<p>What is antimatter drive?</p>
<p>Antimatter would be where you just</p>
<p>purify bits of antimatter.</p>
<p>Basically, it was the opposite of matter.</p>
<p>So if you can have an anti-electron,</p>
<p>you can convert it to the electron.</p>
<p>You could have, even in complete atoms,</p>
<p>it would be anti-atoms.</p>
<p>And when you put them together,</p>
<p>they would be pure energy released, in theory.</p>
<p>And that could drive the most powerful possible engine</p>
<p>for space travel.</p>
<p>But the only place you can make antimatter</p>
<p>is in large particle accelerators, and only very briefly.</p>
<p>So that is hard, but if that could work,</p>
<p>that would be extraordinary.</p>
<p>Fusion drives would be great,</p>
<p>just getting nuclear fusion well-controlled,</p>
<p>and that would actually give you pretty good propulsion.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the most likely thing we&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>is fusion drives.</p>
<p>Fusion technology is getting better and better every year.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s that old saying,</p>
<p>fusion is always 10 years away.</p>
<p>Every year, it&rsquo;s always 10 years away.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s getting better, and I think.</p>
<p>And saying is something that is a century old,</p>
<p>or less than a century old.</p>
<p>Over multiple centuries, that saying might actually,</p>
<p>the fusion might actually become a reality for propulsion.</p>
<p>So that would be, I think, very likely to see</p>
<p>in the next few centuries.</p>
<p>And then biology was the other part.</p>
<p>Or anything else, physics?</p>
<p>I mean, physics, you could imagine ways</p>
<p>that have electromagnetic shielding.</p>
<p>So it could be, you could deflect all the cosmic rays</p>
<p>that are coming at your spacecraft with a large,</p>
<p>almost like force fields, quite frankly.</p>
<p>That would take some development to do,</p>
<p>but that would be good to see.</p>
<p>And uploading human memories and consciousness</p>
<p>into digital form?</p>
<p>Yeah, this kind of blends the machine and physics</p>
<p>with the biology developments.</p>
<p>I think, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of great work</p>
<p>being done on longevity.</p>
<p>I have a, one of my companies itself works on longevity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Onegevity.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m working on it myself,</p>
<p>on ways to improve how we monitor health and wellness now,</p>
<p>and live longer, live better.</p>
<p>Many people are doing this.</p>
<p>This is what the whole purpose of medicine is,</p>
<p>to a large degree.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll live, in the book,</p>
<p>I propose we might get out to live to 150 years.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s reasonable.</p>
<p>But say humans are gonna live to be two, three, four,</p>
<p>500 years, or some people, I meet people like this</p>
<p>every week, who say, I think I&rsquo;m not going to die.</p>
<p>To which I always say, I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But I think you should plan</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not going to be right.</p>
<p>But I want people, also, as we mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>being immortal would really fundamentally change</p>
<p>the social contract, and how you plan,</p>
<p>and how you allocate resources.</p>
<p>Not necessarily bad, but it would just be different.</p>
<p>But I also just think we don&rsquo;t know yet,</p>
<p>of any way to undo the ravages to the human body</p>
<p>that occur over time.</p>
<p>We can repair some of it, replace some of it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s okay to assume that you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t just assume, know you&rsquo;re gonna die,</p>
<p>because then you have a bit of liberty</p>
<p>about what you can do quickly and do next.</p>
<p>But I think we will get better.</p>
<p>I think we could see people live, potentially, to 150,</p>
<p>with some of the tools and methods, and living longer.</p>
<p>But upload, you know, living might become-</p>
<p>Living in a brain, like in the Kurtzweil singularity,</p>
<p>where we all have this rapture-like moment,</p>
<p>and we go up and upload into the cloud and live forever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it would still be the same</p>
<p>as what we consider the view of self in this flesh form.</p>
<p>If we could really get a complete representation</p>
<p>of a person&rsquo;s entire personality up into digital form,</p>
<p>I mean, that would be immortality, basically.</p>
<p>Or a loose representation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go through the thought experiment of,</p>
<p>I like thinking about clones.</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>Twins, twins are clones, basically.</p>
<p>Basically, but the ability to generate,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re stuck with those clones.</p>
<p>The twins is a fixed number of clones,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a genetic clone.</p>
<p>I mean, a philosophical clone</p>
<p>where you can keep generating them.</p>
<p>Versions.</p>
<p>And then I, the reason I really like that construction,</p>
<p>thinking about that, like for me personally,</p>
<p>is it nicely encapsulates how I feel about being human.</p>
<p>Because why do I matter?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m, how would I, if I do another copy of me,</p>
<p>how would I defend why I matter as a human being?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I can.</p>
<p>Because that clone-</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a personal clone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a perfect, like a reasonable clone.</p>
<p>Like most people I know that love me and who I love,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be just fine with the clone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like, and they&rsquo;ll be surprised,</p>
<p>like, oh, you&rsquo;re like, your move kind of weird,</p>
<p>but overall, but otherwise, I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s possible to do that kind of copying,</p>
<p>and no, I don&rsquo;t want to say perfect clone,</p>
<p>because I think perfect clone</p>
<p>is very difficult engineering-wise.</p>
<p>I mean, like a pretty crappy copy.</p>
<p>Would still be okay for most people.</p>
<p>Just like wears suits a lot, has a weird way of talking.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of elements there,</p>
<p>like in the digital space, especially with the metaverse,</p>
<p>you can clone, I think, in the next few decades,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to clone people&rsquo;s behavioral patterns</p>
<p>pretty well, and visual, at least in the virtual reality,</p>
<p>in the digital representation, if you are.</p>
<p>And then you have to really contend,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, why do I matter?</p>
<p>Maybe what matters isn&rsquo;t the individual person,</p>
<p>but what matters are the ideas that that person plays with.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if there&rsquo;s 1,000 clones,</p>
<p>what matters is that I&rsquo;m currently thinking about X,</p>
<p>or some kind of problem that I&rsquo;m trying to solve,</p>
<p>and those ideas, and I&rsquo;m sharing those ideas,</p>
<p>maybe ideas of the organisms,</p>
<p>and not the meat vehicles of the organism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cultural shift where we won&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>treat any one body as fundamentally unique or important,</p>
<p>but the ideas that those bodies play with.</p>
<p>I mean, that sounds crazy.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s abstract, but very relevant.</p>
<p>Derek Parfitt wrote this great book</p>
<p>called Reasons and Persons,</p>
<p>about how you really define an individual</p>
<p>as not just your own thoughts and your own self-reflection,</p>
<p>but where almost, he argues, more defined</p>
<p>by how other people have seen you.</p>
<p>See, like, if you walked out into the world,</p>
<p>and say suddenly nobody knew who you were or recognized you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be, in some regards, deceased, right?</p>
<p>If no one, if everyone just suddenly had massive amnesia,</p>
<p>and you just didn&rsquo;t, no one knew who you are,</p>
<p>and never remembered, no memory of anything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d ever done together, you&rsquo;d be very alone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be basically, you know, starting from scratch,</p>
<p>like as if you&rsquo;d just been born, basically.</p>
<p>So, and he also writes thought experiments,</p>
<p>like what if half of your neurons get replaced</p>
<p>with half of someone else, or a quarter, or 60%?</p>
<p>At what point do you stop being you</p>
<p>and become that other person?</p>
<p>And the argument he makes is it&rsquo;s more than just</p>
<p>what percentage of your neurons are swapped out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the relationships you have with so many people</p>
<p>that partly define you.</p>
<p>No, not completely, but they&rsquo;re a key component</p>
<p>of how you view yourself, how they view you,</p>
<p>what you are in the world.</p>
<p>And he actually goes so far to say</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re probably more important</p>
<p>than even what&rsquo;s in your head.</p>
<p>Like, if you swap out all of your thoughts,</p>
<p>but when you walk out into the world,</p>
<p>everyone still treats to you and talks to you</p>
<p>the same way, has this memory of what you are,</p>
<p>that is still like an entity that&rsquo;s defined you,</p>
<p>even if all of your, you know, there&rsquo;s even movies</p>
<p>like Trading Spaces about this with Eddie Murphy,</p>
<p>or like the ideas of people who can swap bodies.</p>
<p>The reason those are comedies</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re fish-out-of-water comedies,</p>
<p>but they go to the point of what defines you</p>
<p>is not just you, but also how you&rsquo;re viewed.</p>
<p>Well, you as an entity exist in the memories</p>
<p>of other beings, and so that, yeah,</p>
<p>the entities as they exist in their form in those memories</p>
<p>perhaps are more important to who you are</p>
<p>than what&rsquo;s in your head, and that clones then are,</p>
<p>how do they, do they lessen?</p>
<p>Not really, they just distribute, they just scale</p>
<p>the you-ness that can be experienced by other humans.</p>
<p>Like, if I could be doing five podcasts right now</p>
<p>at the same time, then in theory,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d have to have some way to transmit the memory</p>
<p>of each one I did, which would be hard,</p>
<p>but not impossible if it&rsquo;s all digital.</p>
<p>You could aggregate and accrete more and more</p>
<p>of the memories into one entity.</p>
<p>Oh, I see, but I thought at the moment of cloning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like cloning a Git repository,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re no longer as branched.</p>
<p>You share the version, view one of Chris</p>
<p>that a lot of people have experienced,</p>
<p>like your high school friends, college friends,</p>
<p>colleagues, and so on, but now you moved on</p>
<p>to your music career, and one of your clones did,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s fundamentally new experiences</p>
<p>that you still, your colleagues can still experience</p>
<p>the memories of the old Chris,</p>
<p>but the new one is totally, you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>new communities experiencing, connecting to those,</p>
<p>and then you can just propagate,</p>
<p>and the ones that don&rsquo;t get a lot of likes</p>
<p>on social media, we can quietly dispose of.</p>
<p>We wanna maximize the clones of Chris</p>
<p>that can get a lot of likes on Facebook.</p>
<p>Okay, just returning briefly to the topic of AI,</p>
<p>are you working on AI stuff, too?</p>
<p>A lot of machine learning tools for genomics.</p>
<p>For genomics, because I was seeing this interspersed,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re such a biology,</p>
<p>I mean, I guess post-computational biology person,</p>
<p>but what about the, are you working on age of prediction?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, so you&rsquo;ve heard about the book, I guess, yeah.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually written with the philanthropist</p>
<p>I mentioned who we named the fungus after the space station,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s coming out next year, actually, yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the effort there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your interest in the more narrow AI tools</p>
<p>of prediction and machine learning,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I think, called The Age of Prediction,</p>
<p>so the next book that&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>is all the ways where machine learning tools,</p>
<p>predictive algorithms, have fundamentally</p>
<p>changed our lives, so some of them are obvious to me,</p>
<p>where, for example, when we sequence cancer patients&rsquo; DNA,</p>
<p>and we have predictions of exactly</p>
<p>which drug will work with it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a very simple algorithm,</p>
<p>but other ones involve predicting, say,</p>
<p>the age of blood that&rsquo;s left at the scene of a crime,</p>
<p>which uses computational tools to look at each piece of DNA</p>
<p>and what it might reveal for its epigenetic state,</p>
<p>and then predicting, essentially,</p>
<p>how old you are at any given moment,</p>
<p>and it also gets to longevity,</p>
<p>because sometimes you can see if you&rsquo;re aging faster</p>
<p>or slower than you should be,</p>
<p>so some tools are in medicine or even forensics,</p>
<p>but my favorite part, a lot of the book is,</p>
<p>where does this show up in economics as well as in medicine,</p>
<p>so predictive tools, I mean, I think the most notorious</p>
<p>one people thought of was during the 2012 election,</p>
<p>and 2016 election especially,</p>
<p>we were seeing these really big differences</p>
<p>of how Facebook was monitoring feeds,</p>
<p>and so prediction is not just better medicine</p>
<p>or in finance and economics,</p>
<p>people think about stock traders,</p>
<p>people doing predictive algorithms,</p>
<p>but what you view in your feed,</p>
<p>what your vote is and what you saw,</p>
<p>Facebook did experiments,</p>
<p>they called it social contagion experiments</p>
<p>to see can we restructure what people see</p>
<p>and then how they respond,</p>
<p>actually kind of be really predictive and manipulative,</p>
<p>frankly, with what happens,</p>
<p>and then can that change how they vote,</p>
<p>and the answer seemed to be yes</p>
<p>for a good amount of the populace in 2016 in the US,</p>
<p>so I think we&rsquo;re seeing more and more of these algorithms</p>
<p>show up all over the place,</p>
<p>and so the book is about where they&rsquo;re good,</p>
<p>for example, in medicine, they&rsquo;re phenomenal,</p>
<p>they have fundamentally changed how we treat cancer patients,</p>
<p>but where they&rsquo;re risky,</p>
<p>like if someone&rsquo;s trying to steal your vote</p>
<p>or manipulate your thoughts potentially negatively.</p>
<p>So in medicine, you&rsquo;re hopeful about prediction.</p>
<p>Yeah, most of the AI in medicine,</p>
<p>the machine learning tools for image recognition,</p>
<p>for example, for pathology samples,</p>
<p>where normally you think,</p>
<p>oh, someone takes a big bit of tissue</p>
<p>and then puts it onto a slide,</p>
<p>normally there&rsquo;s pathologists</p>
<p>that have been training for years</p>
<p>to look at a chunk of your tissue and say,</p>
<p>okay, is this cancer, what kind of cancer,</p>
<p>what treatment should I do,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an old joke about pathologists</p>
<p>where you can give 10 slides to 10 different pathologists</p>
<p>and get 11 different diagnoses,</p>
<p>which is as awful as it sounds,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re having someone squint</p>
<p>at a stained microscope slide,</p>
<p>but instead, if you use a lot of the AI tools</p>
<p>where you can actually segment the image,</p>
<p>high-resolution characterization with multiple probes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what AI was built to do,</p>
<p>you have a large training data set,</p>
<p>and then you have test samples afterward,</p>
<p>you can do far better than almost every pathologist</p>
<p>on the planet and get a much more accurate diagnostic.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for breast cancer, for prostate cancer,</p>
<p>for leukemia, we&rsquo;ve seen the diagnostic tools</p>
<p>explode with AI power.</p>
<p>Is it currently mostly empowering doctors</p>
<p>or can it replace doctors?</p>
<p>Watson notoriously was made by IBM</p>
<p>to try and replace doctors.</p>
<p>I actually was-</p>
<p>I love IBM so much.</p>
<p>I was in the room when we got a tour of Watson</p>
<p>for the first time with the dean of our medical school,</p>
<p>and these programmers came out and they said,</p>
<p>listen, here&rsquo;s this example of a patient,</p>
<p>and watch Watson diagnose the patient</p>
<p>and recommend the right treatment,</p>
<p>and then at one point in the conversation,</p>
<p>remember this is a room of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a PhD, it&rsquo;s like a geneticist,</p>
<p>some programmers, some MDs,</p>
<p>leaders of the medical school,</p>
<p>the dean is there, and he says,</p>
<p>you could imagine someday this could replace doctors</p>
<p>in a room full of doctors, right?</p>
<p>So it was a really poor choice of words</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>you want to help the doctors,</p>
<p>but I think the view from the programmers</p>
<p>is often a bit naive that they could</p>
<p>fundamentally replace doctors.</p>
<p>Now, in some cases they can.</p>
<p>For the pathology description I just mentioned,</p>
<p>I think the AI tools already do a better job,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve only really been doing this</p>
<p>for about five years, right?</p>
<p>So you imagine another five years</p>
<p>of optimization and data,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna take over, right?</p>
<p>And they should, because staring and squinting</p>
<p>at screens for hours on day</p>
<p>is not the best use of human ingenuity.</p>
<p>So I think in some cases they&rsquo;ll take over,</p>
<p>in other cases they&rsquo;ll augment, they&rsquo;ll help.</p>
<p>Yeah, that human ingenuity,</p>
<p>actually, especially for AI people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to characterize.</p>
<p>I have this debate all the time</p>
<p>about autonomous driving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more difficult than people realize.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an expert on it,</p>
<p>you focus a lot on that for your research, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an expert in nothing.</p>
<p>Except in not being an expert, I think.</p>
<p>Or asking stupid questions where the answer is both.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But there is some ingenuity that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to kind of encapsulate that is human.</p>
<p>For a doctor, the decision-making,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the Hal 9000 thing.</p>
<p>You can have a perfect system</p>
<p>that is able to know the optimal answer,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some human element that&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>And sometimes the suboptimal answer</p>
<p>in the long term is the right one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the self-doubt that is essential</p>
<p>for human progress, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what that is.</p>
<p>If I can, let me ask you to be the wise old sage</p>
<p>and give advice to young people today.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>In high school, in college,</p>
<p>about how to have a career they can be proud of</p>
<p>or maybe a life they can be proud of</p>
<p>on this planet or others.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think for the Padawans out there</p>
<p>and younglings looking up at the stars,</p>
<p>you have to know that this day that you&rsquo;re alive</p>
<p>is quantifiably the best day that&rsquo;s ever happened</p>
<p>and that tomorrow will be even better than this day</p>
<p>in terms of the capacity for discovery,</p>
<p>the amount of data that exists.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not my opinion,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just an empirical fact of the state</p>
<p>of genetics research, knowledge,</p>
<p>accretion of humanity&rsquo;s acumen for many disciplines.</p>
<p>So with that ability to do so many things,</p>
<p>it can be sometimes just terrifying.</p>
<p>Well, what do I pick?</p>
<p>If I could do everything in the most possibility ever</p>
<p>in human history, how do you pick one thing to do?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the thing,</p>
<p>what do you find yourself daydreaming about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the thing that keeps you up at night?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>that keeps you up at night sometimes,</p>
<p>you go find something that keeps you up at night.</p>
<p>Because that is kind of this,</p>
<p>sometimes I feel like I get woken up</p>
<p>by someone on the inside of my skull</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s knocking, trying to get out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of that almost haunting feeling</p>
<p>of I need to wake up, there&rsquo;s things that have to be done,</p>
<p>there are questions I don&rsquo;t know the answer to.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of times it&rsquo;s as simple as</p>
<p>how do we engineer cells to survive more radiation?</p>
<p>But I read a paper and then it came back to me a week later</p>
<p>as, oh, wait, we could use some of these tools</p>
<p>or these genes or these methods.</p>
<p>Really, being pleasantly haunted by something</p>
<p>is a wonderful place to be</p>
<p>and find that thing that bothers you.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;ll be good days and there&rsquo;ll be bad days,</p>
<p>but you want to have, even on the worst possible days,</p>
<p>working on the thing that you love the most.</p>
<p>And then all the usual normal phrases apply,</p>
<p>like then you never work a day in your life</p>
<p>if you have a job you love, the usual phrases.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true and it&rsquo;s actually really hard to find.</p>
<p>I think a lot of times you&rsquo;ll have to do work</p>
<p>for random jobs that maybe you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>for five or even 10 years, right?</p>
<p>Or you might have to go to school for 10 to 15 to 20 years</p>
<p>to finally get to the right spot</p>
<p>where you have the knowledge, the experience,</p>
<p>and even, frankly, just reputation,</p>
<p>and people trust you, you&rsquo;ve done enough good work.</p>
<p>And only then can you really do the thing you love most.</p>
<p>So you have to be a little bit patient,</p>
<p>be a little bit patient and impatient at the same time.</p>
<p>You have to do both.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to find that thing</p>
<p>that excites you, you have to,</p>
<p>especially in this modern world,</p>
<p>I think, silence the distractions.</p>
<p>Because once you find that thing and you hear it,</p>
<p>that little voice in your head,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still Instagram and TikTok and video games</p>
<p>and other exciting sort of dopamine rushes</p>
<p>that can pull you away and make it seem</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re the same thing, but they&rsquo;re not really.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some little flame there that&rsquo;s longer lasting.</p>
<p>And I think you have to silence everything else</p>
<p>to let that sort of flame become a fire.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>because so much of the internet is designed</p>
<p>to convert that natural predisposition</p>
<p>that humans have to get excited about stuff,</p>
<p>convert that into attention and money and ads and so on.</p>
<p>But we have to be conscious of that.</p>
<p>I think a lot of that is full of fun and is awesome.</p>
<p>I think TikTok and Instagram, that&rsquo;s full of fun.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazing, yeah.</p>
<p>And creativity leads to people making amazing videos</p>
<p>or even doing people, my daughter loves TikTok,</p>
<p>and people who do makeup art on TikTok</p>
<p>of things that are mind-blowing.</p>
<p>You think they made that video just to put it on TikTok</p>
<p>and practice their art and share it with the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>But then if my daughter watches TikTok</p>
<p>for like three hours straight,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what are you doing exactly?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, well, you know, so it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But I mean, when I was a kid, I mean, I played Nintendo.</p>
<p>I sometimes would play for like 10 hours a day.</p>
<p>Even in grad school, I&rsquo;d sometimes play</p>
<p>like Counter-Strike or Half-Life, like 12 hours straight.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what was I?</p>
<p>So at one point, I built a new computer.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t install some of the games I had them for.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m just gonna not install them</p>
<p>because otherwise I&rsquo;ll play them for too long.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting props from the team.</p>
<p>I would love to lay out all the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life to myself</p>
<p>because I think I would be less judgmental of others</p>
<p>and less understanding, more patient</p>
<p>because the amount of hours I spent playing</p>
<p>like Diablo and like video, like it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it adds up to like weeks, maybe months of my life</p>
<p>that it was just, you know,</p>
<p>but I feel like I was probably, I tell myself at least,</p>
<p>I was problem-solving.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hand-eye coordination or that&rsquo;s an old,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that really is even remotely true,</p>
<p>but some of the games like Final Fantasy things</p>
<p>are things we actually had to solve problems and think,</p>
<p>and they were some degree of strategy, but.</p>
<p>They were actually just expanding</p>
<p>the diversity of human character that makes up you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can&rsquo;t just focus on the night you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but perhaps it&rsquo;s more beneficial to focus,</p>
<p>to not focus on a singular thing</p>
<p>for many, many years at a time.</p>
<p>That could be one of the downsides of a PhD</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not careful,</p>
<p>is that you become too singularly focused,</p>
<p>not just on the problem, but on a particular community.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t do wild stuff.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do interdisciplinary stuff.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go out painting or getting drunk or dancing,</p>
<p>whatever the variety, whatever injects variety</p>
<p>to the years of difficult reading research paper</p>
<p>after research paper, that whole process,</p>
<p>you have to be very careful to add variety into it.</p>
<p>Maybe that involves playing a little bit of</p>
<p>Counter-Strike or Diablo, whatever floats your boat.</p>
<p>Or dancing.</p>
<p>New York City&rsquo;s a great place for this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Sunrise Rooftop Dancing, a party that does this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>So you go there, I have some people from my lab that go,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only been once, but at Sunrise,</p>
<p>and you see the sun rise over the city,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s huge house music,</p>
<p>and you play and you dance like crazy,</p>
<p>and then you go to work, you go to lab,</p>
<p>you go to wherever you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>But you can, it&rsquo;s good to squeeze in some weird,</p>
<p>crazy sunrise rooftop dancing or things like that</p>
<p>when you can.</p>
<p>If we can, if we may, to some difficult, dark places.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring a flashlight.</p>
<p>Maybe something, find something that can warm your soul</p>
<p>or inspires others.</p>
<p>Is there dark periods, dark times in your life</p>
<p>that you had to overcome?</p>
<p>Yeah, like many people, had friends I&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>I had a friend when I was younger who committed suicide,</p>
<p>and that was actually,</p>
<p>I remember being so struck of, I couldn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand mental illness at the time.</p>
<p>I was very young.</p>
<p>I was only, I think, 11 at the time.</p>
<p>And I really was confused more than anything else</p>
<p>about how could someone take their life.</p>
<p>And I actually, once I got over the grief of it all,</p>
<p>I really, it cemented in my head</p>
<p>that I would never commit suicide.</p>
<p>I used to tell this to my wife.</p>
<p>If it looks like I hung myself, go find my killer,</p>
<p>because I would never do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be staged.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I&rsquo;ve begun to appreciate</p>
<p>there are times where the suffering is so great</p>
<p>and diseases can be so awful that sometimes,</p>
<p>euthanasia, it is an actual exit.</p>
<p>But I just have friends I&rsquo;ve lost along the way,</p>
<p>or, but that&rsquo;s not too different.</p>
<p>Everyone has people they&rsquo;ve lost along the way.</p>
<p>But I actually was never too dark of a childhood</p>
<p>or of a dark place.</p>
<p>I mean, the hardest things have been</p>
<p>really weird relationship breakups</p>
<p>with love, falling in love, and then losing that person,</p>
<p>just breaking up, not like they died,</p>
<p>but where you felt like you just could barely move.</p>
<p>And you literally felt like your heart was moved</p>
<p>in your body to a different location.</p>
<p>And that sort of scraping sense of existence.</p>
<p>But also at the same time, that&rsquo;s been where I&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>in some ways, been the most alive,</p>
<p>where I lost what I thought at the time</p>
<p>was the love of my life.</p>
<p>But then was able to actually, I think,</p>
<p>carve a deeper trench into my heart,</p>
<p>which then could be filled more with joy,</p>
<p>I would say, is what Pablo Neruda wrote about this.</p>
<p>And Khalil Gibran is that the deepest, deepest sorrows,</p>
<p>I think, later have translated into my life</p>
<p>as to places that can be filled</p>
<p>with greater amounts of joy.</p>
<p>I love thinking of sorrows as a digging of a ditch</p>
<p>that can then be filled with more good stuff.</p>
<p>Eventually.</p>
<p>Not at the time, but for a while,</p>
<p>I watched a giant empty cavern full of blood</p>
<p>and tears and pain.</p>
<p>But then, yeah, it comes later, I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>There is an element to life where this too shall pass.</p>
<p>So any moment of sorrow or joy, it&rsquo;s gonna be over.</p>
<p>And treasure it, no matter what.</p>
<p>I mean, I do definitely think about losing love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a celebration of love.</p>
<p>And even any living, I think, is better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, just adamantly,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever really commit suicide,</p>
<p>is because anything I take is better than nothing.</p>
<p>So the worst case scenario,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no heaven, there&rsquo;s no hell.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just it.</p>
<p>If you just die and that&rsquo;s really just it,</p>
<p>then anything that you have in living</p>
<p>is by definition infinitely better than the zero,</p>
<p>because at least it&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>And so I appreciate sad.</p>
<p>I mean, I enjoy sadness, which sounds like an oxymoron,</p>
<p>but I sometimes even long for a good sadness,</p>
<p>like a rainy day and I&rsquo;m staring out a window,</p>
<p>squinting and drinking some underpriced whiskey,</p>
<p>and then just moping.</p>
<p>And like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just moping today, but I want at least one day</p>
<p>where I do that or something.</p>
<p>I actually had a conversation offline with Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a music producer about this.</p>
<p>And he told me, he has a way of speaking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all sage-like, and he says,</p>
<p>be careful that you spend some time appreciating</p>
<p>that sadness, but don&rsquo;t become addicted to it.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a line you can cross</p>
<p>and then you actually push away the joy.</p>
<p>Because you feel like the sad,</p>
<p>because the sadness can be all-encompassing</p>
<p>and therefore even more real</p>
<p>than what might seem like fleeting happiness.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Sadness, if you let it, can be a thing</p>
<p>that stays with you longer and stickier.</p>
<p>But just witnessing suicide made you appreciate life more.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just an appreciation of death</p>
<p>is actually an appreciation of life at the same time.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of your death?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What do you think about it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like being afraid of the sunrise.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a part of this fabric that is humanity.</p>
<p>And then you just think generationally.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I want to do as much as I can.</p>
<p>I feel like I would die,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve lived a full life already.</p>
<p>I actually believe that since age 17 onward.</p>
<p>I feel like even then, I mean, then the bar was low.</p>
<p>I feel like, well, I&rsquo;d had at least sex once.</p>
<p>I had good friends.</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>Good times right at that age.</p>
<p>But then I had also really read a lot of philosophy,</p>
<p>had traveled a bit, felt like I&rsquo;d started</p>
<p>to at least see the world</p>
<p>and had lived a somewhat of a life.</p>
<p>But from then on, I felt like,</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t feel like I was cheated</p>
<p>if I had died from that day forward,</p>
<p>that I had gotten at least enough of life</p>
<p>to feel like that I would be not okay with dying,</p>
<p>but that I feel like I knew I was gonna die.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t afraid I was gonna die.</p>
<p>And it actually was very liberating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only gotten better since then.</p>
<p>So I think some of that may or may not have been</p>
<p>drug-related euphoria, but nonetheless, the joy stuck.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just gotten more true ever since,</p>
<p>is that the default state is one of very rich appreciation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so fleeting.</p>
<p>And so I knew I would die happy, I guess, even at age 17,</p>
<p>but now my metrics have changed a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had sex more than one time now, so that&rsquo;s really big.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>This is very exciting news.</p>
<p>At least four times.</p>
<p>But the empathy.</p>
<p>Multiples.</p>
<p>And professionally accomplished things.</p>
<p>Like I actually do some of the genetic dreams I had</p>
<p>when I was 16 or 17.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now actually making them in my lab.</p>
<p>I actually like to say, my scientific goals and statements</p>
<p>have really been the same since I&rsquo;ve been 17.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just now everyone takes me seriously</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a professor and actually I&rsquo;ve done the thing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re mentoring people, you&rsquo;re educating.</p>
<p>To the next generation, yeah.</p>
<p>Also patients.</p>
<p>And helping patients live longer</p>
<p>and seeing the hope in their eyes</p>
<p>when they went from, even my own grandfather,</p>
<p>went from a two-month diagnosis of living</p>
<p>from metastatic cancer to living for more than two years.</p>
<p>Eventually he succumbed to it,</p>
<p>but knowing you can use the tools of predictive medicine</p>
<p>to save people.</p>
<p>And so now, looking ahead, I feel like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I would die very happy if I saw boots on the red planet</p>
<p>and people there.</p>
<p>And the other advice to the younglings, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>the first time I proposed the twin study to NASA,</p>
<p>they said no several times.</p>
<p>They said, no, we don&rsquo;t have a plan for a mission like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t, just persevere.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I knew you were part of leading the NASA twin study,</p>
<p>but you were also part of the failure to do so early.</p>
<p>Early.</p>
<p>So the first, actually,</p>
<p>because when you start a lab in academia,</p>
<p>they say, here&rsquo;s a pile of money.</p>
<p>Write grants and bring in more money</p>
<p>and train people and start a lab.</p>
<p>So I actually wrote NASA and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not requesting any funds.</p>
<p>I have funds.</p>
<p>They just gave me a bunch of money.</p>
<p>I would like to, though,</p>
<p>do a deep genetic profile of astronauts</p>
<p>before and after space flight</p>
<p>and do it, ideally, if we have some twins</p>
<p>or do genetics and epigenetics and microbiome.</p>
<p>But John Charles,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the director of the Human Research Program,</p>
<p>said, no, we don&rsquo;t even have those samples banked</p>
<p>that you would want that are old samples</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have any plans</p>
<p>for missions like that right now.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And that was the first time I,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like saying to someone,</p>
<p>listen, I&rsquo;ll buy a house for you.</p>
<p>I just have this mile,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh, no, no thanks.</p>
<p>Because it felt like I was offering</p>
<p>a really unique research opportunity.</p>
<p>But then that failure of saying</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not ready yet, it&rsquo;s not time,</p>
<p>but then once they had the solicitation,</p>
<p>then he reached out and said,</p>
<p>oh, actually, I think we&rsquo;ve got something</p>
<p>along the lines of what you were thinking a few years ago.</p>
<p>So sometimes when some things get rejected</p>
<p>or someone says no, say, okay,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s just too early,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t give up, I think, and say.</p>
<p>To me, when someone says no, not right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be like, okay, I&rsquo;ll just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back in a year.</p>
<p>No just means no for now.</p>
<p>And so, if I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>sometimes no means you have a crappy idea.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>I do have crappy ideas, and so does everybody,</p>
<p>but if I really believe in it,</p>
<p>I just say, okay, I&rsquo;ll be back.</p>
<p>Yeah, this too shall pass, the no.</p>
<p>Do you hope to go out to ISS,</p>
<p>out to deep space one day?</p>
<p>I would love to go.</p>
<p>I want to be a little bit older</p>
<p>so that if I die, it&rsquo;s not as traumatic</p>
<p>for my daughter and family.</p>
<p>But yeah, I feel like if I&rsquo;m a little bit older,</p>
<p>I definitely, I would even potentially</p>
<p>do a one-way trip to Mars if it&rsquo;s later in life.</p>
<p>So would you like to,</p>
<p>do you think you will step foot on Mars?</p>
<p>I would love to, and I think I might.</p>
<p>I think it may be that one-way trip.</p>
<p>Because I think they&rsquo;ll need settlers</p>
<p>who would want to go and stay there</p>
<p>and build and be there for the long term,</p>
<p>knowing it&rsquo;s high risk, knowing it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>And your resume fits,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll have a lot of cool stuff to do there.</p>
<p>At least on the surface, you&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to sell yourself well.</p>
<p>Resilience, experience, motivation.</p>
<p>Would that make you sad to die on Mars?</p>
<p>Looking back at the planet you were born on?</p>
<p>No, I think it would be actually,</p>
<p>in some ways, it may be the best way to die,</p>
<p>knowing that you&rsquo;re in the first wave</p>
<p>of people expanding the reach into the stars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be an honor.</p>
<p>Why do you think we&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>To serve as the guardians of life itself.</p>
<p>That is the duty for our species,</p>
<p>is to recognize and really manifest</p>
<p>this unique responsibility that we have,</p>
<p>and only we have so far.</p>
<p>So I think, yeah, to me, the meaning of life</p>
<p>is for life to, in its simplest form,</p>
<p>is to be able to survive,</p>
<p>but to leverage the frailty of life</p>
<p>into its ability to protect itself.</p>
<p>And quite literally, the guardians of the galaxy</p>
<p>is basically what we are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re guarding ourselves and also life.</p>
<p>I mean, life is just so precious.</p>
<p>As far as we know, it is completely rare in the universe.</p>
<p>And I do think a lot, well, what if this is</p>
<p>the only universe that&rsquo;s ever come in</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t come back again?</p>
<p>And like, this is it.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s true, we have to serve as its shepherds.</p>
<p>Leverage the frailty of life to protect it.</p>
<p>And this is all life.</p>
<p>So we get the opportunity, we humans get the opportunity</p>
<p>to be smart enough, to be clever enough,</p>
<p>to be motivated enough to actually protect</p>
<p>the other life that&rsquo;s on this.</p>
<p>Including AI, including life that&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>That might be very different from what we imagine today.</p>
<p>And that would make you sad if we were replaced</p>
<p>by the kinder, smarter AI?</p>
<p>Nope, I think about that in the book a bit,</p>
<p>that I think I would be okay with it</p>
<p>if they carry some echo of that duty</p>
<p>and they bring that with them.</p>
<p>It would be real, I&rsquo;d be sad if they were like,</p>
<p>to hell with everyone, we&rsquo;re gonna destroy everything</p>
<p>we come across and become like nanobots</p>
<p>that make everything gray goo.</p>
<p>That seems, but that would still be a version of life.</p>
<p>Just not one that is, as I think is pretty,</p>
<p>but technically it&rsquo;d be alive.</p>
<p>So philosophically, could I object?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s borderline.</p>
<p>Yeah, but romantically, no.</p>
<p>Romantically.</p>
<p>They need to carry the duty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, yes, there&rsquo;s a bit of a romance</p>
<p>to the philosophy that&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>And you also end the book with a universe</p>
<p>that creates new universes.</p>
<p>So if this isn&rsquo;t the only universe,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s in our future,</p>
<p>that we might launch new offspring universes?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>I mean, multiverse is a controversial field</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very much hypothetical,</p>
<p>but with this universe has been created,</p>
<p>the one we&rsquo;re in now, and so it&rsquo;s happened before,</p>
<p>it certainly could happen again.</p>
<p>Some of them might be happening in parallel.</p>
<p>I think if you look at billions of years,</p>
<p>trillions of years in the future</p>
<p>of technological development, certainly possible.</p>
<p>We could start to have little baby universes,</p>
<p>grow them like cabbage, get them out,</p>
<p>saute them, make them have flavor.</p>
<p>Yeah, create something delicious.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds difficult,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s our human duty to try.</p>
<p>As you said, Chris, this is an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible person, a scientist, explorer.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do in this world,</p>
<p>and I hope to be there with you on Mars.</p>
<p>I would like to also breathe my last breath</p>
<p>on that sexy red planet that&rsquo;s our neighbor.</p>
<p>Podcast from Mars, at least space.</p>
<p>I think space should be coming.</p>
<p>Space is pretty good, space is pretty good.</p>
<p>But Mars next.</p>
<p>Chris, thanks so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an honor and a pleasure to be here, thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Chris Mason.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Stanislav Lem and Solaris.</p>
<p>Man has gone out to explore other worlds</p>
<p>and other civilizations without having explored</p>
<p>his own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers,</p>
<p>and without finding what lies behind doorways</p>
<p>that he himself has sealed.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
