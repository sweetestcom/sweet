<p>if I don&rsquo;t take him</p>
<p>um so yeah I&rsquo;m trying to get myself to</p>
<p>feed or my body to feed off the effects</p>
<p>rather than sugars and I&rsquo;m finding funny</p>
<p>quite hard to get that right</p>
<p>so basically if you don&rsquo;t do the uh the</p>
<p>glucose you tend to hit this wall right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s correct yes</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I mean are you familiar with Professor</p>
<p>Knox in South Africa</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right yeah</p>
<p>yeah he has some great data on that I</p>
<p>mean um that it comes with a package it</p>
<p>comes with the package</p>
<p>um you know like diabetes things like</p>
<p>that but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um I think you just need to um</p>
<p>kind of study some of the long-distance</p>
<p>Runners that have got into a really good</p>
<p>keto adaptation to the point where our</p>
<p>fat adaptation where they can just</p>
<p>oxidize fat like way better than anyone</p>
<p>else and because what&rsquo;s happening you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running up against the loss of glycogen</p>
<p>and now where&rsquo;s the fuel your body just</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t really been able to tap into the</p>
<p>fat because you&rsquo;re not fully converted</p>
<p>over yet and that that takes some time</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s what I would shoot for as a</p>
<p>long-term goal couple other things</p>
<p>um I would recommend I would um</p>
<p>maybe as a transition uh you do</p>
<p>um not the glucose but maybe you do some</p>
<p>fruit okay try that for a while okay</p>
<p>then push that to the side and then</p>
<p>maybe you do maybe a starch something</p>
<p>like that so it&rsquo;s a little bit kind of</p>
<p>like a stair step approach because when</p>
<p>you do this straight</p>
<p>uh those packs are just pure dextrose</p>
<p>synthetic from corn syrup they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to deplete a lot of B vitamins B1</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to affect your</p>
<p>performance</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>as well as deplete other things too so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking this refined sugar I think</p>
<p>they even use maltodextrin it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>refined and it&rsquo;s um yeah it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be burned as fuel but it&rsquo;s going to come</p>
<p>with the package because in order to</p>
<p>burn that fuel you need a lot of other</p>
<p>nutrients so</p>
<p>um at the very very minimum you should</p>
<p>be taking you know B vitamins</p>
<p>electrolytes um not too many but just</p>
<p>enough to compensate for the um that</p>
<p>refined sugar that&rsquo;s going to deplete</p>
<p>because it takes in order to break down</p>
<p>that Sugar it takes certain cofactors</p>
<p>and nutrients so what&rsquo;s happening you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just creating deficiencies left and</p>
<p>right so we want to avoid that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now there is some this is a really open</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>a new field a lot of people are</p>
<p>experimenting now with um</p>
<p>you know adding more ins you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re adding uh MCT oil and coconut uh</p>
<p>um fat to help maybe can run on that as</p>
<p>far as just once your body can burn uh</p>
<p>actual ketones they can start taking</p>
<p>some of this the fat is fuel rather than</p>
<p>the sugar is fuel but again it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a new field there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>research but I would go more towards</p>
<p>some some of these ultra marathon runner</p>
<p>diets that um they&rsquo;re not doing the</p>
<p>glucose they&rsquo;re doing um they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>certain carbs potatoes and things like</p>
<p>that but it&rsquo;s definitely not straight</p>
<p>glucose</p>
<p>quite a few different types of foods and</p>
<p>foods but they are really just trying to</p>
<p>avoid those Stills full stop but like I</p>
<p>said um it happens that you you need</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>yeah I understand that I totally</p>
<p>understand</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the two things too that I think will</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>help you um reduce some of the those</p>
<p>symptoms is to take more vitamin E in</p>
<p>the form of tocotrenals as well as uh</p>
<p>sodium like sea salt because both of</p>
<p>those if you&rsquo;re deficient especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exercising and utilize a lot of</p>
<p>energy they can actually keep at least</p>
<p>your muscles in really good shape and</p>
<p>keep them strong and you&rsquo;ll have less</p>
<p>fatigue just from that</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have to be a human guinea pig to</p>
<p>really uh experiment on this yourself</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just not a lot of</p>
<p>research unfortunately</p>
<p>thank you very much for the advice</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome I appreciate it all right</p>
<p>thanks for coming on board David we</p>
<p>appreciate that and all of us uh you</p>
<p>know tip our hat here all that long</p>
<p>distance run into stuff uh my longest</p>
<p>run used to be to the refrigerator but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to avoid that a little bit</p>
<p>more with Dr Berg&rsquo;s great Council and</p>
<p>speaking of places far away Kerry from</p>
<p>YouTube just simply wants to say hi Dr</p>
<p>Berg much love from your Australian</p>
<p>followers you have given us health</p>
<p>happiness and you have changed my life</p>
<p>so thanks for that Carrie we appreciate</p>
<p>it and you&rsquo;re certainly not alone all</p>
<p>across the world we&rsquo;ve got yeah great</p>
<p>reports like that and LK from YouTube is</p>
<p>it okay to take your vitamins and</p>
<p>minerals during a fast good question</p>
<p>well especially especially that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>you want to take them for sure because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you are</p>
<p>um you know living off no food so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make sure you get your nutrients</p>
<p>and with very very minimal calories if</p>
<p>any and then that way you can uh survive</p>
<p>a little bit better especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into a fast with some subclinical</p>
<p>deficiencies</p>
<p>so I mean I know some people that do the</p>
<p>fasting and they kind of after like 24</p>
<p>hours they might feel faint you know</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re not taking enough</p>
<p>electrolytes and things like that so</p>
<p>yeah take them while you&rsquo;re fasting um</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re going to probably ask about</p>
<p>well wait a second I thought what about</p>
<p>like the fat soluble vitamins like</p>
<p>vitamin D don&rsquo;t you need fat for that</p>
<p>so that should I take that with the meal</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s going to help you digest it to a</p>
<p>certain degree but you&rsquo;ll still absorb</p>
<p>um a significant amount if even if you</p>
<p>have an empty stomach so I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry too much about that perfect okay</p>
<p>we got some really great in my opinion</p>
<p>questions today and I bet the audience</p>
<p>will agree and here&rsquo;s the first one</p>
<p>okay question number one what is the</p>
<p>primary nutritional difference</p>
<p>between adult vegetables</p>
<p>and sprouts and microgreens</p>
<p>is uh broccolini a sprout or something</p>
<p>or is that just regular old broccoli I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a type of broccoli</p>
<p>interesting all right well uh so climb</p>
<p>on that audience</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see here let&rsquo;s go through the list</p>
<p>of people in addition to David and Dr</p>
<p>Gantt and Marsha who are listening to us</p>
<p>from all around the world so we&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to say a good morning to our viewers</p>
<p>joining us from the UK Canada Mexico</p>
<p>Jordan Palestine Japan Australia we just</p>
<p>mentioned Ghana Bangkok Algeria uh and</p>
<p>by the way Terry corrected me I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>saying nambia but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Namibia Namibia if I said in Namibia</p>
<p>thank you Terry Hong Kong Brazil Tunisia</p>
<p>Germany Oman turkey Spain Greece Italy</p>
<p>Paraguay Montenegro South Africa thanks</p>
<p>again David Denmark Pakistan uh and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another one that he gave me uh</p>
<p>eritia come on dear you got to throw in</p>
<p>these names anyway aratia I think I said</p>
<p>that right Nepal Taiwan Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>Israel France the Netherlands Nicaragua</p>
<p>Nigeria Sweden Ethiopia India</p>
<p>Switzerland Malaysia Croatia United Arab</p>
<p>Emirates Emirates excuse me Estonia</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago the Czech Republic</p>
<p>Jamaica Aruba Slovakia Bhutan Zambia</p>
<p>been their beautiful place Peru Zimbabwe</p>
<p>Austria Ghana we&rsquo;re getting there folks</p>
<p>Poland Iran Qatar Iraq the Virgin</p>
<p>Islands and all across these United</p>
<p>States including uh you know Atlanta who</p>
<p>will have up soon and also my my</p>
<p>neighbor Dr Gant is from Fayetteville</p>
<p>North Carolina and she promises to come</p>
<p>out to the beach at Wilmington where I</p>
<p>live but says she prefers Myrtle Beach</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a little rabbit hole to go</p>
<p>down cat on a cat can style from YouTube</p>
<p>is it okay to drink organic ceremonial</p>
<p>Keiko while fasting</p>
<p>did I said it right I I didn&rsquo;t hear what</p>
<p>you said ceremonial what uh c-a-c-a-o</p>
<p>is that like Coco I&rsquo;m not sure what that</p>
<p>is yeah interesting well audience why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you guys if you know what</p>
<p>c-a-c-a-o is uh why don&rsquo;t you uh</p>
<p>yes I guess that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>oh okay yeah yeah you can drink that</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>not a problem all right very good thank</p>
<p>goodness and being my pronunciation</p>
<p>today I&rsquo;m just uh getting an F minus I</p>
<p>think okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um here&rsquo;s a good one Karen from YouTube</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating clean keto with intermittent</p>
<p>fasting on a 22 and 2 schedule if I</p>
<p>drink antimicrobial formula with uh</p>
<p>Manuka Honey morning and night am I</p>
<p>still getting any benefits from</p>
<p>autophagy so she&rsquo;s chugging some honey</p>
<p>dog</p>
<p>I think not because out of all the</p>
<p>things you can eat of course</p>
<p>fructose glucose that&rsquo;s what honey is</p>
<p>made out of um</p>
<p>can inhibit</p>
<p>um it can raise insulin and insulin is</p>
<p>the factor that kind of inhibits</p>
<p>autophagy so you you really are not</p>
<p>going to get the benefit of that um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so you have other things you probably</p>
<p>could eat would be better I mean you can</p>
<p>have celery uh that would be that would</p>
<p>probably help you a lot more but of</p>
<p>course the um</p>
<p>you know I know there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>some good properties in honey so maybe</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking it to help yourself</p>
<p>with a sore throat something like that</p>
<p>or you can put it topically on a burn if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I think maluka honey has some</p>
<p>amazing properties and uh you can use be</p>
<p>used for many different things as an</p>
<p>antimicrobial</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s so many more antimicrobial</p>
<p>things that you can ingest</p>
<p>to uh that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>create that effect</p>
<p>very good okay the odd garlic oregano</p>
<p>oil things like that wonderful okay</p>
<p>uh the first question of today uh Dr</p>
<p>Berg asked the audience what is the</p>
<p>primary nutritional difference between</p>
<p>adult vegetables and Sprouts or micro</p>
<p>machines and the audience</p>
<p>uh ninety percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>sprouts and micro greens are the</p>
<p>nutritionally dense 10 say they have</p>
<p>higher levels of chlorophyll</p>
<p>okay so um</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about</p>
<p>um this little baby Sprout you have the</p>
<p>seed right and that would be also be</p>
<p>considered a grain</p>
<p>grains or seeds and people actually eat</p>
<p>grains right</p>
<p>um and then you have the Sprout which is</p>
<p>usually about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>two to five days</p>
<p>and then you have the micro green which</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a little bit later up to 14 days</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a little bit older in the stage</p>
<p>of development then you have baby greens</p>
<p>which is a little bit older and then you</p>
<p>have adult vegetables so the the peak</p>
<p>nutrition okay happens right right</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>you know 7 to 14 days so you have this</p>
<p>massive up uh spike in these protective</p>
<p>defense chemicals but primarily you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting massive amounts of</p>
<p>phytonutrients in these phytochemicals</p>
<p>which by the way drug companies are</p>
<p>spending a lot of money researching and</p>
<p>in their development of drugs from</p>
<p>these phytonutrients that are just have</p>
<p>amazing properties anti-inflammatory you</p>
<p>name it anti-cancer so what&rsquo;s unique</p>
<p>about a microgreen or a sprout is you</p>
<p>have about between</p>
<p>40 to up to a hundred times the amount</p>
<p>of phytonutrients than adult vegetables</p>
<p>so here you&rsquo;re trying to get your</p>
<p>phytonutrients your antioxidants from</p>
<p>the vegetables being broccoli which you</p>
<p>should</p>
<p>um but if you had the microgreens or the</p>
<p>Sprouts it&rsquo;s super concentrated you get</p>
<p>a lot more so you wouldn&rsquo;t have to have</p>
<p>as much</p>
<p>so those people that can&rsquo;t seem to do</p>
<p>the 10 to 20 cups of salad a day like</p>
<p>Steve should definitely be doing micro</p>
<p>greens or Sprouts just put a little bit</p>
<p>on your salad now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>growing methods are important too and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into that but the</p>
<p>point is like you can buy these micro</p>
<p>greens at the store they&rsquo;re a bit</p>
<p>expensive because they go bad really</p>
<p>quick but you don&rsquo;t need very many and</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re consuming this super</p>
<p>concentrated phytonutrient you can even</p>
<p>grow them yourself that can actually</p>
<p>help you with so many different things</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using it for autism H pylori</p>
<p>cancer even if someone is on</p>
<p>chemotherapy it helps to minimize the</p>
<p>side effects it also just helps you</p>
<p>trigger enzymes in your own liver to</p>
<p>help turn poisons into harmless</p>
<p>particles so if there&rsquo;s some type of</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Benzene for example that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very toxic</p>
<p>these phytonutrients help to dismantle</p>
<p>that so they can help you and the last</p>
<p>cool thing about it is that when you</p>
<p>have the sprouts and you have the micro</p>
<p>greens they have the least amount of</p>
<p>um anti-nutrients lectins oxalates uh</p>
<p>phytates</p>
<p>um all these things that a seed has</p>
<p>as well as an adult vegetable has</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re eating something at the stage</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a plant growth that&rsquo;s uh will</p>
<p>give you some really cool benefits</p>
<p>without with minimal problems wow how</p>
<p>about preparation doc how can you ruin</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>or how can you get the most well if you</p>
<p>grow them you know what you can do is</p>
<p>you um I would you know highly recommend</p>
<p>you grow them in actual soil because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get you would get a way better</p>
<p>product but of course some people you</p>
<p>know grow them in</p>
<p>different mediums that uh that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the the perfect thing for the</p>
<p>microbes you want but anyway you grow</p>
<p>them and you can just cut the tops off</p>
<p>put on your salad and let them grow back</p>
<p>cut it off put in your salad let it grow</p>
<p>back so you can use it multiple times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how many times you can use</p>
<p>them but they do grow back and um</p>
<p>you can also buy them from the store and</p>
<p>just uh you know they&rsquo;re already going</p>
<p>to be clean and you stick them right on</p>
<p>your salad and or I&rsquo;ll get some at the</p>
<p>farmer&rsquo;s market usually has them as well</p>
<p>I go to the Bethesda Farmers Market on</p>
<p>Sunday and there&rsquo;s a guy there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the salad guy he is the best</p>
<p>micro greens that I&rsquo;ve ever had so I end</p>
<p>up buying tons of that stuff I put in my</p>
<p>salad</p>
<p>very great health properties</p>
<p>thanks Doc okay shray from YouTube can</p>
<p>fasting mess with a woman&rsquo;s hormones my</p>
<p>physician says as soon as blood sugar</p>
<p>drops noticeably cortisol kicks in and</p>
<p>it can further deplete a woman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>progesterone levels thoughts</p>
<p>so maybe we should just start eating</p>
<p>more frequently eat a lot of snacks eat</p>
<p>every hour and a half to keep that</p>
<p>cortisol from going up right that makes</p>
<p>a lot of sense</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that is utter uh nonsense in fact you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find that when you do fasting you feel</p>
<p>Serene calm your stress goes down your</p>
<p>tolerance stress goes up</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re confusing is the counter</p>
<p>regulatory</p>
<p>cortisol effect when blood sugars go</p>
<p>down because you&rsquo;re not eating but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not going to be a big</p>
<p>issue because as soon as your body</p>
<p>starts adapting within two to three days</p>
<p>and you start getting into ketosis</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hope you&rsquo;re not eating sugar so</p>
<p>um your body runs on fat fuel so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not it so now you don&rsquo;t have this</p>
<p>situation where you&rsquo;re just running on</p>
<p>blood sugars and it goes down and then</p>
<p>all of a sudden you can&rsquo;t tap in the fat</p>
<p>and then you have this issue so the</p>
<p>solution is to adapt to the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>and um and your cortisol will be fine</p>
<p>um yeah it&rsquo;s just based on</p>
<p>misinformation</p>
<p>um they don&rsquo;t know they don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>the adaptation and the liver they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know about nutritional ketosis</p>
<p>unfortunately just not taught that so</p>
<p>um they can&rsquo;t really give you a good</p>
<p>opinion because they don&rsquo;t understand it</p>
<p>wow this covers a lot of folks uh Jack</p>
<p>from YouTube I&rsquo;m struggling with</p>
<p>prostate issues at 65 your</p>
<p>recommendations would be greatly</p>
<p>appreciated</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the first thing</p>
<p>um I do know this if you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>dairy products okay if you have prostate</p>
<p>and dairy sometimes that doesn&rsquo;t mix</p>
<p>because the dairy can actually increase</p>
<p>the hormonal Factor even estrogen and</p>
<p>actually if you&rsquo;re doing like nothing</p>
<p>like milk and even sometimes cheese can</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll you might notice that your</p>
<p>prostate swells up</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um my if you&rsquo;re just cutting that out</p>
<p>that might help you now many uh men get</p>
<p>up multiple times a night to urinate</p>
<p>because the prostate they think anyway</p>
<p>and it could be but I found when you</p>
<p>start doing intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and you cut out the carbs and you cut</p>
<p>out the snacking especially the late</p>
<p>night snacking</p>
<p>the grazing at night when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching TV you cut that out and you</p>
<p>start doing two meals or even one meal a</p>
<p>day boy</p>
<p>your retention of urine</p>
<p>is going to be so much better in fact</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to sleep through the</p>
<p>night without getting up and you then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go wait a second I</p>
<p>thought that that was my my prostate and</p>
<p>when in fact it was just your insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>interesting okay the rest of our</p>
<p>questions for today unusually are all</p>
<p>true false or and that&rsquo;s just so great</p>
<p>because you can appear to be you have a</p>
<p>50 chance of appearing to be a genius</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t know the answer so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the first one to consider uh Dr</p>
<p>Berg</p>
<p>okay true or false the best way to</p>
<p>stretch a muscle</p>
<p>is a static stretch which basically</p>
<p>means you&rsquo;re not moving the muscle</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just holding it for about 30</p>
<p>seconds</p>
<p>okay folks what do you think about that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to YouTube Gregory from</p>
<p>YouTube my wife suffers from anemia and</p>
<p>must continually take iron pills and her</p>
<p>doctors can&rsquo;t find the root of this</p>
<p>issue what are your thoughts</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>not good because of the iron pills they</p>
<p>give you are Elemental which is um</p>
<p>really hard in the body you should you</p>
<p>should get a better source of iron I</p>
<p>would get um</p>
<p>liver grass-fed liver pills or spleen</p>
<p>pills that will give you a much better</p>
<p>type of iron I think your body will find</p>
<p>more bile available the other point to</p>
<p>look at with iron is the pH of your</p>
<p>stomach chances are your acid your</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid is just not strong</p>
<p>enough to be able to assimilate or pull</p>
<p>in that iron so these minerals don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>absorbed unless you have other factors</p>
<p>involved so you might benefit from</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride with your meals</p>
<p>maybe two or three or four even five of</p>
<p>those betaine hydrochloride to help you</p>
<p>absorb iron</p>
<p>um iron also uh can be increased with</p>
<p>vitamin C so you might need that as well</p>
<p>so I would look at the whole uh look</p>
<p>your whole diet to see what&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s something else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stopping you uh from having this</p>
<p>issue the other thing too</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other forms of um anemia so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re anemic and they someone</p>
<p>said you&rsquo;re iron anemic when in fact</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 12 anemic</p>
<p>that could be a world of difference that</p>
<p>could be another reason why you might</p>
<p>have anemia that can&rsquo;t fix it because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fix it by taking iron you need</p>
<p>to take</p>
<p>methylcobolamine that type of B12</p>
<p>interesting okay as usually happens</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a few other folks around the</p>
<p>world that want to be acknowledged and</p>
<p>they are from Tibet Albania Thailand</p>
<p>Ireland Norway Scotland and Egypt so</p>
<p>welcome you folks too so glad that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a part of the growing list of</p>
<p>folks that listen to Dr Burke&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>counsel from around the world</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see here&rsquo;s another one</p>
<p>Nikki uh from Facebook wants to know</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got her fingers crossed can I eat</p>
<p>kale chips while fasting</p>
<p>you can it just will inhibit your</p>
<p>results because when you&rsquo;re fasting you</p>
<p>know you shouldn&rsquo;t be eating</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah so I would probably have those</p>
<p>more towards when you eat than when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re when you&rsquo;re um</p>
<p>fasting I mean the other thing that um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things that don&rsquo;t trigger</p>
<p>insulin very much okay number one is fat</p>
<p>number two is fiber so kale does have</p>
<p>more fiber</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s cool so that would help that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a lot better than sugar but</p>
<p>but still the kale chips they I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what they put on them and um might</p>
<p>be an inhibiting factor it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably not going to contribute to your</p>
<p>success but I mean it&rsquo;s definitely way</p>
<p>better than other things you could be</p>
<p>doing so I guess um really</p>
<p>depends on what you&rsquo;re comparing it to</p>
<p>all right here&rsquo;s an off to ask question</p>
<p>Dana from Facebook what can I do about</p>
<p>fatigue during fasting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an easy one uh it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>one of three things but usually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a lack of sodium so you need</p>
<p>to have some sea salt and you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>the energy should go up about maybe 80</p>
<p>percent of the time another</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>mineral that might create a fatigue</p>
<p>would be a lack of potassium</p>
<p>so start taking up potassium find up</p>
<p>electrolyte powder that is high in</p>
<p>potassium and of course I&rsquo;m not biased</p>
<p>of my own but that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend but you&rsquo;d find that you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>energy goes up because you need a lot of</p>
<p>potassium to run the</p>
<p>sodium potassium pump that generates all</p>
<p>the power to your muscle and nerves so</p>
<p>that will instantly give you energy and</p>
<p>the last thing to look at for energy is</p>
<p>uh the B1 B1 is like the spark plug</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>you need it when you do keto or even you</p>
<p>do high carb diet you need B1 to ignite</p>
<p>the engine and get things working and a</p>
<p>lot of people are deficient and so that</p>
<p>may just ignite and give you more energy</p>
<p>too but start with the salt do one thing</p>
<p>at a time and see what it is all right</p>
<p>well I am biased to your electrolytes</p>
<p>now to be fair I hadn&rsquo;t tried other</p>
<p>powders but I used to get the cramps in</p>
<p>my calves really bad and if I would</p>
<p>drink your electrolyte formula a couple</p>
<p>hours before I ran it seemed to</p>
<p>alleviate that I must also admit I just</p>
<p>probably wasn&rsquo;t hydrating well enough</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had great results with that</p>
<p>electrolyte powder plus it tastes great</p>
<p>so there you go all right the second</p>
<p>question of the day is a true false or</p>
<p>as we said the best way to stretch a</p>
<p>muscle is a static stretch for 30</p>
<p>seconds and the audience 75 percent of</p>
<p>them say it&rsquo;s true 25 is say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>well the 25 is correct you know I was</p>
<p>taught uh for many years that you have</p>
<p>to do static stretching in fact um when</p>
<p>I was in wrestling I did static</p>
<p>stretching and I ended up pulling a</p>
<p>muscle</p>
<p>um what happens when you think about a</p>
<p>muscle muscle um always comes in pairs</p>
<p>okay you have a something that contracts</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s relaxing so let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>for example you&rsquo;re trying to relax your</p>
<p>hamstring and you stretch it well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called a stretch</p>
<p>reflex which counters the stretching</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t want you to break</p>
<p>that muscle So within three seconds of</p>
<p>stretching you have this reflex that</p>
<p>comes in and counters that stretch and</p>
<p>so here you are trying to um become more</p>
<p>flexible and you&rsquo;re actually creating</p>
<p>more damage believe it or not I know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to believe but um there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you can do I&rsquo;ll be doing a</p>
<p>video on this it&rsquo;s a wonderful stretch</p>
<p>by uh physiotherapist</p>
<p>um athletic trainer trains the top of</p>
<p>the food chain as far as athletes</p>
<p>Olympic runners okay this guy wrote a</p>
<p>book and um stay tuned for that video</p>
<p>but what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p>isolate the muscle you want to stretch</p>
<p>okay the hamstring for example and then</p>
<p>you you take the opposite muscle and you</p>
<p>contract it okay that would be the quad</p>
<p>the thigh muscle so you contract that</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re stretching in motion</p>
<p>hold at the end of range of motion for</p>
<p>two seconds let off</p>
<p>repeat eight to ten times it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>great um stretch I&rsquo;ve been doing and I</p>
<p>love it you can do with any muscle in</p>
<p>the body but the principle is uh it</p>
<p>makes a lot of sense and it&rsquo;s working so</p>
<p>I wish I would have known that a long</p>
<p>time ago interesting okay I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>put up another question then we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go back to the Green Room for a Dr</p>
<p>Gantt but here&rsquo;s the next true falser</p>
<p>all right true or false immobilizing the</p>
<p>joint</p>
<p>is the best treatment for sprains and</p>
<p>strains mild to moderate injuries of</p>
<p>your joints</p>
<p>climb on that folks and let me unmute</p>
<p>our next guest and Dr again if you would</p>
<p>remind yourself to unmute you were on</p>
<p>with Dr Byrd</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>all right hated</p>
<p>oops you are breaking up a little bit</p>
<p>maybe get a little closer to the mic</p>
<p>can you hear me now perfect oh good</p>
<p>um my question is for my patients that</p>
<p>are diabetics and they are fat what do</p>
<p>you think is the best thing when the</p>
<p>person that&rsquo;s over 40 trying to lose</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>for the fluctuating</p>
<p>did you get all that dog</p>
<p>well I got the gist of it but you kind</p>
<p>of phased out but I think let me just</p>
<p>duplicate this question</p>
<p>um so you have what&rsquo;s the best fasting</p>
<p>pattern this window of fasting uh for</p>
<p>someone over 40. generally speaking yes</p>
<p>okay yeah I think um the the best</p>
<p>pattern I to start out with is the 18</p>
<p>hour fast and then the six hour window</p>
<p>so that gives you this real easy thing</p>
<p>to do by just skipping your breakfast</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s easy to do because most</p>
<p>people really they&rsquo;re not as hungry as</p>
<p>they think in the morning and even if</p>
<p>they are it&rsquo;s a hunger wave that goes</p>
<p>away if they just ignore it because</p>
<p>really they have this little spike in</p>
<p>cortisol but if you can do an 18 hours</p>
<p>oh my goodness you&rsquo;ll have so many</p>
<p>amazing benefits</p>
<p>so uh after six o&rsquo;clock you just fast</p>
<p>all the way to the next day you know</p>
<p>until 12 and you have this wonderful</p>
<p>period of autophagy and you see all</p>
<p>these amazing benefits that would be</p>
<p>like the average</p>
<p>great fasting window for someone over</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>now if someone&rsquo;s a little more</li>
</ol>
<p>hardcore and they&rsquo;re uh they want to see</p>
<p>faster results and they want to bite the</p>
<p>bullet what you do is you you push them</p>
<p>right to a 20-hour fast so now we have a</p>
<p>four hour window and um of eating and</p>
<p>then 20 hours of fasting then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to see some even better benefits</p>
<p>especially with the immune system and</p>
<p>then if you want to be</p>
<p>a rock star and then you just do a one</p>
<p>meal a day and you fast for 23 hours and</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re gonna it&rsquo;s gonna take it to a</p>
<p>whole new level uh you&rsquo;re not gonna have</p>
<p>any hunger cravings are gone you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel great mood wise your</p>
<p>cognitive function is great if you have</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s symptoms they&rsquo;ll probably go</p>
<p>away</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so I notice even when I do videos when I</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when I fast before I do a video</p>
<p>wow you don&rsquo;t have to do much editing</p>
<p>but when I don&rsquo;t when I eat before I do</p>
<p>a video you gotta edit that thing chop</p>
<p>it up it&rsquo;s like you know just takes more</p>
<p>cuts and more resources but</p>
<p>um yeah I like the question I&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that but 18 hour is really</p>
<p>really good but you know what some</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>um need to do</p>
<p>um a 14 hour or even a 12 hour</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to add some benefits</p>
<p>but the more you can get them not to</p>
<p>snack the better okay</p>
<p>thank you thank you that&rsquo;s great thank</p>
<p>you for joining us uh doctor from um</p>
<p>Atlanta oh no no I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Fayetteville okay so come out to the</p>
<p>beach soon and thanks for getting on</p>
<p>with the show the audience is on it uh</p>
<p>the latest question was true false so</p>
<p>mobilizing to join is the best treatment</p>
<p>for sprains and strains mild or moderate</p>
<p>injuries and the audience says or at</p>
<p>least 65 percent of them say it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>sorry say it&rsquo;s false 35 percent say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true</p>
<p>the way that we were taught is to</p>
<p>immobilize</p>
<p>compress add cold</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s just what we do but you</p>
<p>know I always like to question</p>
<p>everything and say is that is that</p>
<p>really the best way to do it well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some new research to find that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the best way to do it in fact</p>
<p>if you if you don&rsquo;t have a severe joint</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a fracture for example</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a moderate type injury or</p>
<p>sprain strain it&rsquo;s best</p>
<p>to add motion to that joint</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>start moving it not to the point of pain</p>
<p>but just start to add some motion to</p>
<p>that joint passive range of motion</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when you immobilize you start creating</p>
<p>um you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t have healing you</p>
<p>have you have scar tissue that develops</p>
<p>right away and we found that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>best way to treat an injury and they</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve looked at this this greater</p>
<p>research and I will be releasing a video</p>
<p>on this and also</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to add cold the only</p>
<p>reason you&rsquo;d want to add cold therapy is</p>
<p>because a pain</p>
<p>um but other than that it&rsquo;s best if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t immediately ice it because</p>
<p>the the blood&rsquo;s there to kind of add</p>
<p>circulation healing</p>
<p>so if we add a little bit of motion and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t add ice I&rsquo;m not saying add heat</p>
<p>but just don&rsquo;t advice you&rsquo;ll find that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a better healing response I</p>
<p>mean you can add other things like</p>
<p>infrared</p>
<p>but ice um I use that only if you need</p>
<p>to with the pain but this whole idea of</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ice it to help healing is um</p>
<p>is actually a myth I know it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>believe so things that we were taught</p>
<p>come to find out they&rsquo;re not always a</p>
<p>hundred percent</p>
<p>true</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>anyway stay tuned for my video on that</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um uh if you injure a joint you want to</p>
<p>keep moving keep it moving and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to find that uh it&rsquo;ll heal faster</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re an athlete I mean</p>
<p>some of the top athletes</p>
<p>the book that I&rsquo;m going to recommend of</p>
<p>the guy who came up with the stretching</p>
<p>technique</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>also talks about this motion after an</p>
<p>injury and boy he has a lot of</p>
<p>experience with top athletes in the</p>
<p>world injuring themselves and he puts</p>
<p>him right into motion right away and</p>
<p>then they they&rsquo;re back playing in no</p>
<p>time so I like the concept and it makes</p>
<p>a lot of sense once you get the details</p>
<p>very interesting stuff okay star sister</p>
<p>uh is her handle from YouTube my blood</p>
<p>sugar is higher in the mornings than</p>
<p>throughout the rest of the day am I in</p>
<p>ketosis if my blood sugar levels are all</p>
<p>over the place question mark</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re doing keto</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing a lot of sugar that</p>
<p>being said uh there&rsquo;s something called</p>
<p>The Don phenomena where your blood</p>
<p>sugars go up because you still have a</p>
<p>good amount of insulin resistance and so</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening your signals the</p>
<p>sensors in your liver are going wow we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough sugar so what we need</p>
<p>to do is we need to make some</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s coming from it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even coming from your your diet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming from your own body turning the</p>
<p>protein fat and even ketones into blood</p>
<p>sugar and this process is called gluco</p>
<p>glucose Neo meaning new genesis the</p>
<p>creation of so your liver is doing</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis to make more sugar</p>
<p>because it still has insulin resistance</p>
<p>but that will go away with time I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it</p>
<p>um if you are worried about it all you</p>
<p>have to do in the morning</p>
<p>is take a long walk and just burn off</p>
<p>that sugar</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s things that you can speed it</p>
<p>up the way to actually fix insulin</p>
<p>resistance is to cut down the carbs</p>
<p>do insulin intermittent fasting</p>
<p>keep your stress low because cortisol</p>
<p>can be a big factor in making sugar</p>
<p>because the cortisol causes your body to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>do more of that gluconeogenesis and then</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar with water is a good</p>
<p>thing you can add cinnamon to the water</p>
<p>too cinnamon is a really good thing for</p>
<p>blood sugars</p>
<p>berberine is another thing you can do</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole series of things you can</p>
<p>do to to speed up this process of</p>
<p>getting rid of insulin resistance</p>
<p>especially like vitamin D and and B1</p>
<p>all right Daria from YouTube I have</p>
<p>anemia and high cholesterol levels I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so confused about what I can and cannot</p>
<p>eat help</p>
<p>go back to the basics don&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>complex just do the keto the healthy</p>
<p>version of Keto and do nutrient dense</p>
<p>foods and that&rsquo;s really the key is when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing these Foods Does it include</p>
<p>all the nutrients well I I show people</p>
<p>in the books and in my videos what to</p>
<p>eat and if you eat foods that are not</p>
<p>only keto but are loaded with the iron</p>
<p>and the B12 you&rsquo;re going to be fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when you don&rsquo;t do that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>problem like let&rsquo;s say you want to get</p>
<p>your your um</p>
<p>iron from spinach for example well good</p>
<p>luck that&rsquo;s not the best source of iron</p>
<p>to prevent anemia or um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re even doing antacids</p>
<p>right and you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of</p>
<p>your anemia good luck because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to get rid of the acid that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>necessary to absorb iron</p>
<p>um and actually have it go in your body</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you just stick with the the healthy</p>
<p>version of Keto and um you&rsquo;ll come out</p>
<p>fine</p>
<p>very good eater from YouTube I have</p>
<p>gastritis and acid reflux what can I do</p>
<p>to address these issues</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a couple things zinc</p>
<p>konoscine is good</p>
<p>um cabbage with the sulforaphane seems</p>
<p>to help</p>
<p>um H pylori which is behind sometimes</p>
<p>gastritis and um</p>
<p>things like that so I think at this</p>
<p>point if you have this inflammatory</p>
<p>stomach I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend taking</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride instead I would</p>
<p>just do these other things like I said</p>
<p>and then slowly heal it so then the</p>
<p>stomach can be healthy and then go back</p>
<p>to the normal healthy ketogenic diet but</p>
<p>um I have videos and gastritis uh you</p>
<p>can also do licorice root is another</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s a whole series of things</p>
<p>that you can do to help that but um the</p>
<p>bottom line is um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know this a symptom is just an</p>
<p>indicator that there&rsquo;s a problem uh once</p>
<p>as you treat it realize there&rsquo;s a deeper</p>
<p>cause and it&rsquo;s probably somehow you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get the core uh eating plan</p>
<p>implemented yet long enough to create</p>
<p>the effects probiotics are another great</p>
<p>way to deal with gastritis because it</p>
<p>handles the the gut microbes which have</p>
<p>a huge influence over these other</p>
<p>digestive organs believe it or not so</p>
<p>they all work together but um</p>
<p>I always recommend a good probiotic if</p>
<p>you have gastritis</p>
<p>okay very good I&rsquo;m going to come on</p>
<p>camera here because it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>confession time Christy from YouTube has</p>
<p>a question about Lyme disease and my</p>
<p>hypochondria skyrockets whenever I go</p>
<p>into the woods uh during the summer</p>
<p>because I imagine that their ticks all</p>
<p>over me uh just injecting Lyme disease</p>
<p>and in fact I went to the doctor once I</p>
<p>told my family it&rsquo;s up here on my head</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just sure and it&rsquo;s swollen red</p>
<p>and so on and they followed me to the</p>
<p>doctor and the doctor said well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really kind of a cut do you do you want</p>
<p>a Band-Aid and I no I don&rsquo;t want a</p>
<p>Band-Aid I was so embarrassed that my</p>
<p>family laughed at me but anyway I just</p>
<p>want to set up the next question because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really paranoid about ticks giving</p>
<p>me Lyme disease and so far apparently I</p>
<p>just have cuts on my head and no Lyme</p>
<p>disease so let&rsquo;s go back to Christy she</p>
<p>says please discuss the best way to get</p>
<p>rid of Lyme disease so I guess she did</p>
<p>have it</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m very and I&rsquo;m not telling you</p>
<p>to file this but I said just my opinion</p>
<p>is that very much against the long-term</p>
<p>antibiotics</p>
<p>for Lyme because they wipe out your</p>
<p>defenses and then it&rsquo;s just it gets it</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>not a a win-win situation these spiral</p>
<p>kites um are very</p>
<p>stealth and they can go up into the</p>
<p>brain they can go into this remission</p>
<p>State uh the real solution is to keep</p>
<p>your defenses very very strong keep the</p>
<p>stress low and also do the natural</p>
<p>antibiotics like the garlic the time the</p>
<p>sage the oregano oil and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>protocols for lime</p>
<p>um that I&rsquo;m not going to get into you</p>
<p>can read up on that</p>
<p>um I had Lyme that&rsquo;s what I did and um</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good probiotic but it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>you really have to um build up your your</p>
<p>immune system as the primary goal</p>
<p>um I would say in a given year I would</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>maybe 30 ticks I would find on my body</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>many times I&rsquo;ve had the butterfly rash</p>
<p>so uh of course</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a chance that could have</p>
<p>contributed to line but</p>
<p>um at this point I&rsquo;m just focusing on</p>
<p>keeping my immune system strong and I</p>
<p>have not had a problem believe it or not</p>
<p>so but it&rsquo;s interesting because these</p>
<p>ticks tend to stick on you and they numb</p>
<p>the area you don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>there and then one day you just happen</p>
<p>to be looking down and they&rsquo;ll what is</p>
<p>that a little scab and you find it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>darn tick and you pull it out um so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened so many times because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>on a farm but um</p>
<p>it is a situation unfortunately you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to when you know when you</p>
<p>get home if you&rsquo;re outside take your</p>
<p>fingers through your hair and just kind</p>
<p>of really feel around if you have a dog</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;ll bring these ticks in left</p>
<p>and right you have to check your dog and</p>
<p>check out your body every day to make</p>
<p>sure there&rsquo;s no ticks but I understand</p>
<p>your your problem</p>
<p>um and it is a situation I wish there</p>
<p>was a simple solution but um it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>battle between these very stealth evil</p>
<p>microbes and trying to</p>
<p>defend against that well Christy I&rsquo;m we</p>
<p>are all pulling for you hope you heal</p>
<p>and feel better uh from that terrible</p>
<p>situation okay let&rsquo;s see here&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>true falser for the audience doc there</p>
<p>it is</p>
<p>okay the fact that the stomach pH is so</p>
<p>acidic between 1.5 and 3 indicates</p>
<p>that we have a good ability to digest</p>
<p>meat</p>
<p>is that true or false all right folks</p>
<p>climb on it and let&rsquo;s go back to the</p>
<p>green room and this time from Atlanta</p>
<p>Georgia we have Marcia and Marcia let me</p>
<p>unmute you and you are on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>with your terrific question</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg hi</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve had really large fibroids and I</p>
<p>wanted to avoid a hysterectomy so that</p>
<p>brought me to my journey with keto with</p>
<p>you and so thank you my question is I</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>um lingering sort of indigestion now and</p>
<p>a pulling that&rsquo;s happening right on this</p>
<p>side and I&rsquo;m just wondering what can I</p>
<p>what should I be doing more frequently</p>
<p>or eating more of in order to take care</p>
<p>of this lingering problem</p>
<p>so the fibroids are creating a pulling</p>
<p>sensation and it&rsquo;s uncomfortable is that</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>um I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone from 192 to 165 I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m doing well on the keto so</p>
<p>um but the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing this now to flare up and</p>
<p>sort of you know bother me at this point</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know what to eat what to do</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>okay it was really hard to hear you but</p>
<p>I think I I understand what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>asking</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Steve did you did you hear her maybe did</p>
<p>you want to clarify or should I just</p>
<p>Jump Right In what I what I think she</p>
<p>asked well I think you you should uh Doc</p>
<p>and then you correct us Marcia if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the wrong track</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s feeling the sensation and she</p>
<p>had the fibroids I think they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>better but there&rsquo;s still a sensation she</p>
<p>lost weight and like how do we how do we</p>
<p>get rid of some of the maybe the scar</p>
<p>tissue that is developed in this area</p>
<p>would that be the right question okay</p>
<p>good all right great</p>
<p>um so we&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>um this thing called fascia and</p>
<p>connective tissue and it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>just like an injury</p>
<p>um you do you injure your fascia fascia</p>
<p>is like the Saran wrap that holds</p>
<p>everything together and you have a lot</p>
<p>of fascia that that has been holding</p>
<p>this fibroid in hopefully it&rsquo;s shrinking</p>
<p>down to nothing but there&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>probably some fascia and adhesions into</p>
<p>this area so I think the absolute best</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>um is to manually</p>
<p>uh get in there and start working out</p>
<p>some of the fascia so you can do like a</p>
<p>fascial type trigger point type therapy</p>
<p>in the abdomen area as well as fascial</p>
<p>stretches</p>
<p>um uh in your you know in your lower</p>
<p>part of your body and the upper part</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all connected you have</p>
<p>these all these different connections</p>
<p>from even up to the back of your neck</p>
<p>all the way down to your shoulder and</p>
<p>your hip and down your leg in these</p>
<p>sheaths of connective tissue that need</p>
<p>to be stretched and I think you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to find when you do that you&rsquo;re like wow</p>
<p>I really feel these adhesions in my</p>
<p>abdomen way more and then you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to work those out and do fascial</p>
<p>stretching and you&rsquo;re going to find that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll give you more space in your</p>
<p>abdomen and then the discomfort will go</p>
<p>away but that&rsquo;s really what you have to</p>
<p>do it&rsquo;s and you can manage manually</p>
<p>going in there and and do some work as</p>
<p>well but you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>stimulate it and that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>increase blood flow which is going to</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>also Don don&rsquo;t forget about two things</p>
<p>autophagy from doing the prolonged</p>
<p>fasting that&rsquo;ll help get rid of some of</p>
<p>that damaged protein collagen as well as</p>
<p>the tocatrinols which also help with</p>
<p>anything scar anything adhesions</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s a really good thing as well</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s great well thank you so much</p>
<p>Marcia for joining us and being so</p>
<p>patient uh there in the green room and</p>
<p>again you can stick around and just</p>
<p>watch the rest of the show as we move</p>
<p>forward and let&rsquo;s see uh and quiz</p>
<p>question number four we already have</p>
<p>the consensus or the answers from the</p>
<p>audience and it asks the fact that the</p>
<p>stomach pH is so acidic and I won&rsquo;t read</p>
<p>the amount indicates that we have a good</p>
<p>ability to digest meat and uh 72 percent</p>
<p>of our respondents say it&rsquo;s false and 28</p>
<p>say it is true</p>
<p>now I was just I&rsquo;m just curious how many</p>
<p>people would agree or disagree with that</p>
<p>because if you think about it um</p>
<p>if you take a cat or a dog</p>
<p>their pH is even more acidic than that I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s down to like one to two</p>
<p>uh and their their bodies digest meat</p>
<p>very well raw meat they can digest it</p>
<p>without chewing it so if our pH is that</p>
<p>acidic</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know the logic is that we</p>
<p>have the ability to break down meat um</p>
<p>so um if you take a cow that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>designed to eat meat what is the pH of</p>
<p>their stomach is it is it that acidic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost neutral it&rsquo;s like 6.4</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s almost neutral so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with a a huge change in PH right</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>one way to know kind of what we have the</p>
<p>ability to digest is just to look at the</p>
<p>digestive system and kind of understand</p>
<p>um some of these Basics but yeah our</p>
<p>bodies do have the ability to digest</p>
<p>meat because of this pH</p>
<p>um so as we get older the pH gets worse</p>
<p>and worse and worse and then we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the ability to digest meat and so</p>
<p>really depends on the acidity in your</p>
<p>stomach when you hit 80 years old like</p>
<p>your pH is probably going to be five</p>
<p>uh maybe even six and you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>a harder time digesting meat so when</p>
<p>people say well I&rsquo;m getting older I</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t want to do red meat well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably because they just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the acid but the real key thing to</p>
<p>know is</p>
<p>um one of the</p>
<p>problems with getting older is this</p>
<p>thing called sarcopenia which you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>losing muscle</p>
<p>um and so we do need good amounts</p>
<p>sufficient amount of protein as we age</p>
<p>um so don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t forget that and if we</p>
<p>we talked about Sprouts before Sprouts</p>
<p>have have protein but don&rsquo;t rely on</p>
<p>sprouts for your protein because it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>incomplete it&rsquo;s not going to be enough</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to need some you can you</p>
<p>might need to eat</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>eat things that have eaten Sprouts like</p>
<p>cows so I&rsquo;m actually a vegan on a beer</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat cows that eat grass so I get</p>
<p>that my grass indirectly</p>
<p>yeah well I&rsquo;m jealous of all the great</p>
<p>things you eat out there uh okay here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our final question speaking of digestion</p>
<p>yeah all right the fact that</p>
<p>um our large colon microflora good</p>
<p>bacteria ferments okay it ferments</p>
<p>indicates that we should have the</p>
<p>ability to digest plant fiber</p>
<p>is that true</p>
<p>well false the audience I tell you you</p>
<p>guys uh are the reason our show runs so</p>
<p>well you just don&rsquo;t waste any time on</p>
<p>these questions and so this show we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to get them all out and the reward</p>
<p>for that from this audience is that we</p>
<p>can now go a hundred percent social</p>
<p>media for the rest of the show unless</p>
<p>you have a dialogue for us doc uh and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um oh well wait a minute I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>bring up a graphic because this question</p>
<p>is perfect there&rsquo;s the graphic and the</p>
<p>question is is can you ship your</p>
<p>products be shipped to Kenya</p>
<p>is that true or false</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a very good question I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know I doubt it but you can check</p>
<p>uh we&rsquo;ll put a link down below to see</p>
<p>where where it comes from right now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actively working on trying to make</p>
<p>things available in different parts of</p>
<p>the world so you can check that see if</p>
<p>see if that works but eventually we will</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;d also like to try to get to</p>
<p>Australia</p>
<p>um but we&rsquo;re working on that and um the</p>
<p>other thing I&rsquo;m working on since we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about products is um some really</p>
<p>uh great things coming in the future</p>
<p>with um</p>
<p>I really want to just grow all of our</p>
<p>ingredients</p>
<p>myself not myself but just</p>
<p>with with certain farmers and myself</p>
<p>involved in doing the testing so we we</p>
<p>isolated the farm we&rsquo;re actively I have</p>
<p>a plan to do that and I&rsquo;m really excited</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um now I&rsquo;ll be able to do all the</p>
<p>microbial testing and the microbial</p>
<p>testing of the plant the herbs and uh</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>um talk about quality talk about just</p>
<p>the research and the fun of just trying</p>
<p>to take that to a whole new level</p>
<p>um so I&rsquo;m excited about that and stay</p>
<p>tuned for</p>
<p>for some great uh information on that</p>
<p>fantastic and let&rsquo;s say audience you</p>
<p>wanted to watch one of Dr Berg&rsquo;s videos</p>
<p>and you scour through Google and you get</p>
<p>a little frustrated well there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>remedy and it&rsquo;s called the Dr Berg app</p>
<p>which is available on your iPhone or</p>
<p>through Google play or whatever and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all neatly organized in there</p>
<p>and you know you&rsquo;ll be able to fare it</p>
<p>down through that and get the answer you</p>
<p>need quickly and for free on the app</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no charge at all so just download</p>
<p>that and enjoy the results of your</p>
<p>queries okay and let&rsquo;s see uh I tell you</p>
<p>Terry is also a big advocate of the</p>
<p>audience because if I miss a question</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll regurgitate it and this must what</p>
<p>happens so the the handle is one minute</p>
<p>interview that&rsquo;s the person&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>non-deploom from YouTube what is the</p>
<p>best form of choline we can take choline</p>
<p>uh by tartrate by tartrate CDP or Alpha</p>
<p>CPC does that make any sense doc</p>
<p>yeah it they&rsquo;re all really good</p>
<p>phosphatidylcholine is good the um they</p>
<p>all have slightly different forms and um</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all I I wouldn&rsquo;t say one is</p>
<p>better than the other it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>different forms that can actually get</p>
<p>the colony in your body but choline is</p>
<p>really good for</p>
<p>um helping make that neurotransmitter</p>
<p>acetylcholine it&rsquo;s also good to prevent</p>
<p>a fatty liver it&rsquo;s also good to help</p>
<p>break down fats I have a problem with</p>
<p>choline I need to take that</p>
<p>supplementation based on my DNA test and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of comments like</p>
<p>Dr Pepper when are you gonna you know</p>
<p>explain more about this DNA I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working on it hang in there there&rsquo;s a I</p>
<p>just have to you know create like over</p>
<p>100 videos for this topic so that way</p>
<p>when someone</p>
<p>gets their report they can um go to the</p>
<p>video that they need to learn about uh</p>
<p>based on their problem with the DNA</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a bit</p>
<p>complex now and I want to simplify it</p>
<p>and make it really simple</p>
<p>um and that takes a little bit of time</p>
<p>so be patient and that&rsquo;s why we call you</p>
<p>a patient</p>
<p>okay and this is a question true false</p>
<p>the fact that this is one we&rsquo;ve asked</p>
<p>the uh and you asked the audience the</p>
<p>fact that our large colon microflora</p>
<p>ferments indicates that we have the</p>
<p>ability to digest plant fiber and the</p>
<p>audience is right on it as usual our</p>
<p>final question 55 percent of respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s true and uh the remaining 45</p>
<p>percent say that it is false</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>I think um you know the way we&rsquo;re taught</p>
<p>about the large colon</p>
<p>large intestine you know it&rsquo;s like oh it</p>
<p>just does two things it uh recycles</p>
<p>water you absorb water so to prevent</p>
<p>dehydration and it also electrolytes but</p>
<p>what about the fermentation part you</p>
<p>ferment that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s the large</p>
<p>intestine so just the fact that we have</p>
<p>acid stomach then we have also the last</p>
<p>part being fermentation tells us kind of</p>
<p>what food we should be eating It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>combination an omnivore a combination of</p>
<p>plant and animal and um</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>exclusively on on plants or just animals</p>
<p>but our body can can do both and I find</p>
<p>the combination is is the best</p>
<p>um but if you are a carnivore and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going well I don&rsquo;t really need plants</p>
<p>um you can still ferment</p>
<p>uh protein</p>
<p>you can ferment collagen and cartilage</p>
<p>and things like that so there&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>fermented fish you know in certain</p>
<p>cultures</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s you can do that as well</p>
<p>um and that&rsquo;s I think good for really</p>
<p>for people with digestive issues</p>
<p>but the point is that um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of benefit when you uh</p>
<p>when these microbes are fed fiber you</p>
<p>start making small chain fatty acids and</p>
<p>if you create a deficiency of that the</p>
<p>colon cells don&rsquo;t always get to be fed</p>
<p>and they can have a problem because that</p>
<p>can help build the layer of mucus in</p>
<p>your colon and add for that that strong</p>
<p>barrier so there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>from feeding the microbes and having</p>
<p>them give us other things other</p>
<p>other things but when you start changing</p>
<p>your diet one way or the other but with</p>
<p>the whole microflora completely changes</p>
<p>I mean pretty quick so it&rsquo;s constantly</p>
<p>adapting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I think your your core Health really</p>
<p>depends on these micro microbes you know</p>
<p>the level of microbes so the diversity</p>
<p>of microbes and if you have a wide range</p>
<p>of different plants or herbs</p>
<p>you can really create a really nice</p>
<p>diverse microbiome that can then give</p>
<p>you different things that you maybe</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get before and actually help</p>
<p>you digest</p>
<p>various things because now you have</p>
<p>maybe microbes that can break down</p>
<p>oxlets which decrease your ability to</p>
<p>get kidney stones or break down</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know even lactose I don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>could be a possibility but a lot of</p>
<p>these microbes actually even make bile</p>
<p>salts so they&rsquo;re fascinating creatures</p>
<p>and um I&rsquo;m doing a deep dive now and</p>
<p>yeah we have the ability to ferment and</p>
<p>if you have too much fiber and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough microbes you could probably</p>
<p>get an over fermentation or even not be</p>
<p>able to keep up with that and get gas so</p>
<p>you can use your digestive system to</p>
<p>really determine what you should be</p>
<p>eating just by testing certain things</p>
<p>out and see how you feel on different</p>
<p>foods that&rsquo;s terrific well I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>what I forgot to get some acknowledgment</p>
<p>to Marcia Mitchell from Atlanta who lost</p>
<p>35 pounds she mentioned and for that she</p>
<p>gets what&rsquo;s known as the Dr Berg Bell</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s for you Marcia congratulations</p>
<p>and uh keep that up and as promised</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to wrap things up on YouTube</p>
<p>um oh wait a minute Maggie from Facebook</p>
<p>says thank you for the app Dr Berg it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing so Maggie is acknowledging that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great free thing to download on</p>
<p>your Android or Apple phone let&rsquo;s see I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve wrapped up all the questions</p>
<p>um and let me let me find another one</p>
<p>from uh from our social media</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>honestly Bretta from Facebook when I cut</p>
<p>out carbs I lose too much weight what</p>
<p>should I do to deal with this problem</p>
<p>well you can hang around with Steve</p>
<p>McMillan and I&rsquo;ll plump you up in a week</p>
<p>but no there&rsquo;s probably a healthier way</p>
<p>to do that uh Dr Berg what do you</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re gonna have to just increase</p>
<p>your calories unfortunately increase eat</p>
<p>more food but try not to do multiple</p>
<p>meals maybe add more fat for sure</p>
<p>because that way at the very least your</p>
<p>body won&rsquo;t be using your stored fat</p>
<p>anymore it&rsquo;ll be using the dietary fat</p>
<p>as the fuel so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more fat it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more calories</p>
<p>I have that problem as well so join the</p>
<p>club I even made my own called keto</p>
<p>bricks which you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re using cacao</p>
<p>powder and different things and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making these um</p>
<p>very interesting</p>
<p>thousand calorie I guess they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>bricks and you just eat it</p>
<p>um some people don&rsquo;t like the taste but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m experimenting with this so stay</p>
<p>tuned I&rsquo;ll actually share a recipe with</p>
<p>everyone</p>
<p>um if you wanted to gain weight but I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t recommend them if you are</p>
<p>trying to lose weight because this is</p>
<p>going to add more calories unnecessarily</p>
<p>and on that note Steve I don&rsquo;t know am I</p>
<p>premature oh yeah it&rsquo;s only well maybe a</p>
<p>little bit why don&rsquo;t we get one more</p>
<p>question we promised a lot of action for</p>
<p>social media uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>okay uh now here&rsquo;s one Nadal yeah I mean</p>
<p>I think I already went for her excuse me</p>
<p>All Right audience I&rsquo;m going to get it</p>
<p>together</p>
<p>ooh uh Sid hartha from YouTube what is</p>
<p>the best way to stop vomiting during a</p>
<p>pregnancy poor thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the typical thing that kind of comes up</p>
<p>because that can be come from a number</p>
<p>of things and it&rsquo;s really really about</p>
<p>um make sure you&rsquo;re going into the</p>
<p>pregnancy and do the whole</p>
<p>um process you&rsquo;re eating really</p>
<p>healthily you know getting all the</p>
<p>nutrients because I will say that a</p>
<p>certain deficiency of could be zinc</p>
<p>could be B6 deficiency that could</p>
<p>actually increase the risk of vomiting</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>nauseousness vomiting it also could be</p>
<p>gallbladder this could be many different</p>
<p>reasons for that</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t really have another answer</p>
<p>for you because I don&rsquo;t know your</p>
<p>history</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best time to</p>
<p>eat healthy is right at that point and</p>
<p>especially once you have the baby and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re breastfeeding hopefully</p>
<p>um just really get your diet like really</p>
<p>pristine and try to breastfeed as long</p>
<p>as possible and that baby is going to</p>
<p>have a great chance of</p>
<p>doing very well and with your immune</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t uh um</p>
<p>try to have the the child in a</p>
<p>completely sterile environment you know</p>
<p>let them go on the floor and</p>
<p>get outside in these experience some of</p>
<p>the microbes that&rsquo;s going to start</p>
<p>developing the immune system</p>
<p>because the mother gives her the gives</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>innate immune system so you&rsquo;ve got that</p>
<p>going for you and then you have this</p>
<p>acquired immune system that&rsquo;s developed</p>
<p>with experience and exposure to microbes</p>
<p>and going through infections and just</p>
<p>because a child gets sick</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like try to suppress that let them</p>
<p>go through the process let the immune</p>
<p>system develop</p>
<p>on that note have a wonderful weekend</p>
<p>thank you for your wonderful uh</p>
<p>questions attention and I have some</p>
<p>interesting videos coming up this next</p>
<p>week too</p>
<p>foreign</p>
