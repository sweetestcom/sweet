    <p>The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall,</p>
<p>one of the most insightful minds and systems thinkers</p>
<p>in the martial arts world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a black belt in jiu jitsu, accomplished competitor,</p>
<p>an MMA fighter undefeated in the UFC,</p>
<p>and truly a philosopher who seeks to understand</p>
<p>the underlying principles of the martial arts.</p>
<p>Jiu jitsu is such an important part of who I am,</p>
<p>and I was hoping to share that with folks</p>
<p>who might know me only as a researcher.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no better person to do that with than Ryan,</p>
<p>who somehow, remarkably, I can say is a friend,</p>
<p>and also a modern day warrior philosopher</p>
<p>of the Miyamoto Masashi line of especially dangerous</p>
<p>and brilliant humans.</p>
<p>Also, his amazing wife, Jen Hall, was there as well,</p>
<p>so if you hear a kind of voice of wisdom coming from above,</p>
<p>you know who it is.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the sponsors,</p>
<p>PowerDot, Babbel, and Cash App.</p>
<p>Please check out the sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that renaming this podcast</p>
<p>to just my name gave me intellectual freedom</p>
<p>that I really didn&rsquo;t anticipate was so empowering,</p>
<p>especially for someone who&rsquo;s trying to find their voice.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll allow me the chance to really try and do that,</p>
<p>to step outside of AI and even science, engineering,</p>
<p>history, and so on, and on occasion,</p>
<p>talk to athletes, musicians, writers,</p>
<p>and maybe even comedians who inspire me,</p>
<p>especially up and coming comedians and musicians</p>
<p>like Eric Weinstein, who yes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do a third conversation with soon.</p>
<p>I think if I allow myself to expand the range</p>
<p>of these conversations on occasion,</p>
<p>when I do return to science and engineering,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring a new perspective and also a little bit more fun</p>
<p>and a few extra listeners</p>
<p>that may not otherwise realize how fascinating</p>
<p>artificial intelligence, robotics, mathematics,</p>
<p>and engineering truly is.</p>
<p>All that said, please skip the episodes</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t interest you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to listen to all of them.</p>
<p>Trust me, as someone who is a bit or a lot OCD,</p>
<p>that idea is quite unpleasant.</p>
<p>But life, friends, is full of unpleasant things.</p>
<p>But as Hunter S. Thompson suggested,</p>
<p>and I suggest as well,</p>
<p>you should still buy the ticket and take the ride.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,</p>
<p>or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but I give you the timestamp,</p>
<p>so please skip if you don&rsquo;t want to listen to the ads,</p>
<p>but it does mean a lot to me when you do.</p>
<p>And still please do check out the sponsors</p>
<p>by clicking on the links in the description.</p>
<p>It really is the best way to support this podcast.</p>

<p>I use it for muscle recovery for legs and shoulders,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to build muscle,</p>
<p>endurance, or even just warm up.</p>
<p>In fact, I first heard about this kind of</p>
<p>electrical muscle stimulation device</p>
<p>in reading that Bruce Lee used it.</p>
<p>He was an inspiration to me</p>
<p>as someone who practices first principles thinking,</p>
<p>especially in a discipline</p>
<p>where conventional thinking is everywhere.</p>
<p>He created a martial art called Jeet Kune Do</p>
<p>that is in many ways, at least philosophically</p>
<p>in its hybrid approach,</p>
<p>a precursor to modern day mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a special kind of deep philosophical thinking</p>
<p>that combat athletes or jiu jitsu practitioners do</p>
<p>that is unlike any other.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s grounded in the humbling process</p>
<p>of getting your ass kicked a lot.</p>
<p>That removes any illusion of intellectual superiority.</p>
<p>I think the journey towards wisdom starts</p>
<p>when you humbly admit to yourself</p>
<p>that you know very little or almost nothing.</p>

<p>They offer 14 languages, including Spanish, French,</p>

<p>Let me read a few lines from a Russian song</p>
<p>by Vladimir Vysotsky called</p>
<p>Anna Bula V Parishe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start to understand if you sign up to Babbel.</p>
<p>The song always made me smile,</p>
<p>because it resonates with my own life.</p>
<p>It translates loosely to she&rsquo;s been to Paris.</p>
<p>Paris for a Russian, I suppose, symbolizing a fancy life</p>
<p>and that the guy can never quite fit into that kind of life.</p>
<p>Expensive things, nice restaurants, cars, all that.</p>
<p>I was thinking about what song&rsquo;s equivalent in English,</p>
<p>maybe Uptown Girl by Billy Joe is similar in spirit,</p>
<p>but very different in style.</p>
<p>I just watched the video on YouTube for Uptown Girl</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically Billy Joe dressed up as a mechanic,</p>
<p>but dancing in a way that I&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>no mechanic has ever danced,</p>
<p>turning the old cringe factor up to 11.</p>
<p>Anyway, I always felt like I didn&rsquo;t really fit in</p>
<p>with the fancy people and that&rsquo;s what this song represents.</p>
<p>But back to Babbel.</p>

<p>This show is presented by the great, the powerful,</p>
<p>the OG sponsor named unofficially</p>
<p>after one of my favorite musicians,</p>
<p>the man in black, Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Cash App, the number one finance app</p>
<p>in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEX podcast.</p>
<p>The Cash App folks are truly amazing people</p>
<p>and are teaming with ideas for cool contests,</p>
<p>giveaways and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of doing some kind of a little contest</p>
<p>and giving away 42 bucks to a bunch of people who win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much about the money,</p>
<p>but the glory and a delicious taste of victory.</p>
<p>If you have ideas for a contest, let me know.</p>
<p>I was thinking of something like asking people</p>
<p>to submit funny, inspiring photos or videos or audio</p>
<p>of using Cash App or any of the sponsors of this podcast,</p>
<p>really, or maybe even just funny things related</p>
<p>to the podcast, like different weird places</p>
<p>you might be watching or listening to me right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s somebody out there right now</p>
<p>sitting in a hot tub with some wine watching me say this.</p>
<p>I salute you, sir or madam.</p>
<p>I may be opening up some floodgates I deeply regret later,</p>
<p>so please make sure you&rsquo;re wearing clothes</p>
<p>and whatever you sent me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be no naked people in the hot tub</p>
<p>as part of this podcast.</p>
<p>I have integrity and standards.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments what ideas</p>
<p>for contests you might have.</p>
<p>Again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use the code LexPodcast, you get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>an organization that is helping to advance robotics</p>
<p>and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Ryan Hall.</p>
<p>Who, in your view, is the greatest warrior in history?</p>
<p>Ancient or modern?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough question, and again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no historian by any measure,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll probably do the worst.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what are your best bands ever?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Metallica, and you know, so I&rsquo;ll pick the&hellip;</p>
<p>Metallica just came out with a new album,</p>
<p>by the way, with an entire orchestra.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Metallica will always be one of the greatest.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I agree with you.</p>
<p>They were a bad example.</p>
<p>They were a well known, yet awesome band.</p>
<p>Let me say it&rsquo;s like Nickelback or something like that.</p>
<p>I mean, that feels cheap</p>
<p>because everyone makes fun of Nickelback.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on how you want to define warrior.</p>
<p>Something that I think about</p>
<p>when it comes to trying to evaluate</p>
<p>various people or situations</p>
<p>or things that I&rsquo;ve read about or heard about</p>
<p>are the circumstances that they were involved in</p>
<p>because I think a lot of times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to look at the outcomes,</p>
<p>and obviously we live in an outcome driven world</p>
<p>and outcomes do matter,</p>
<p>but at the same time, you look at,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say what Cuba&rsquo;s been able to pull off</p>
<p>from a combat sports perspective, it&rsquo;s staggering.</p>
<p>The amount of successful Olympic level competitors</p>
<p>they have in wrestling, boxing, judo.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re a tiny little island</p>
<p>with no money and no people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s shocking.</p>
<p>You know, when you think about the Olympics</p>
<p>and the United States doing well,</p>
<p>of course we should do well.</p>
<p>I mean, Russia should do well.</p>
<p>China should do well.</p>
<p>India should do better than they do, honestly.</p>
<p>Obviously it means like they&rsquo;re not into it as much</p>
<p>or at least certain sports</p>
<p>because they have the resources people wise.</p>
<p>So talent&rsquo;s not going to be an issue.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something to like</p>
<p>where the starting point is.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the argument with like,</p>
<p>why people say Maradona,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re into soccer, okay.</p>
<p>They say Maradona is better than Messi</p>
<p>because he basically carried the team</p>
<p>and won the World Cup with a team</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise win the World Cup.</p>
<p>And then Messi was only successful in Barcelona</p>
<p>because he has like superstars,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s playing with other superstars.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fair to say.</p>
<p>I mean, like you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of factors that go into,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say winning a soccer game.</p>
<p>And obviously Barcelona,</p>
<p>particularly for various points in time</p>
<p>had a ridiculous all star squad of world class players.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say for instance,</p>
<p>maybe they didn&rsquo;t have the creative players in Argentina.</p>
<p>They needed to get the ball up to Messi.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have like the NES</p>
<p>and again the backing there in the midfield.</p>
<p>But because obviously Argentina&rsquo;s always had</p>
<p>ridiculous attacking players,</p>
<p>like even alongside Messi,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re like the three killers up front</p>
<p>and then a little less behind.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting you say that</p>
<p>depends how you define warrior</p>
<p>because you can probably take like</p>
<p>some of the civil rights leaders,</p>
<p>you can go into that direction,</p>
<p>like leaders in general.</p>
<p>But if we just look at like</p>
<p>the greatest martial artists in history in that direction,</p>
<p>do you have somebody in mind?</p>
<p>I would say at least three that pop into my head</p>
<p>and would be Hannibal, Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>and then maybe Miyamoto Musashi,</p>
<p>the two commanders and then one guy.</p>
<p>But so it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And then again, you mentioned warriors</p>
<p>being able to make a lot out of a little.</p>
<p>Musashi&rsquo;s famous for winning duels</p>
<p>that were oftentimes one on one.</p>
<p>The Alexander and Hannibal were military commanders</p>
<p>and one of them faced Rome.</p>
<p>And that was an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Oftentimes coming up with novel tactics,</p>
<p>different strategies, sometimes under resourced,</p>
<p>having to do novel and crazy things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s skin in the game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting thing too.</p>
<p>I think a lot of times it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re playing a video game,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can be a warrior</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no skin in the game.</p>
<p>You get hurt, you lose, that&rsquo;s a bummer.</p>
<p>It stings a little bit,</p>
<p>maybe it makes you feel slightly disappointed,</p>
<p>but Musashi loses, he loses.</p>
<p>Hannibal loses, he loses.</p>
<p>Alexander loses, he loses.</p>
<p>And they lose, I guess the people around them lose.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s almost like you could use,</p>
<p>even from a combat sports perspective, Muhammad Ali,</p>
<p>I mean, you consider also their quality of opposition.</p>
<p>Musashi was fighting high quality opposition.</p>
<p>Obviously Hannibal and Alexander, particularly Hannibal,</p>
<p>were fighting unbelievable opposition.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali fought phenomenal opposition,</p>
<p>but he had skin in the game both in the ring and out.</p>
<p>And that actually meshes with, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>like a civil rights type of situation</p>
<p>where you are under resourced,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pushing the stone uphill.</p>
<p>And that was a neat thing I think about Muhammad Ali</p>
<p>was how much personal conviction the man had to have</p>
<p>in order to pull off what he was able to pull off</p>
<p>both in and outside of the ring.</p>
<p>And that reminds me of, again,</p>
<p>some of the other great leaders</p>
<p>or great fighters throughout history.</p>
<p>So what do you make of the kind of very difficult idea</p>
<p>that some of these conquerors like Alexander the Great</p>
<p>and somebody that, if you listen to Hardcore History,</p>
<p>oh, Dan Carlin, who apparently Elon Musk</p>
<p>is also a big fan of, is the Genghis Khan episode.</p>
<p>A large percent of the world can call Genghis Khan</p>
<p>an ancestor.</p>
<p>So the difficult truth is about some of these conquerors</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a lot of murder and rape and pillage</p>
<p>and stealing of resources and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And yet they&rsquo;re often remembered as quite honorable.</p>
<p>I mean, in the case of Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who argue,</p>
<p>if you look at historically the way it&rsquo;s described</p>
<p>in full context, is he was ultimately,</p>
<p>given the time, he was a liberator.</p>
<p>He was a progressive, I should say.</p>
<p>In terms of the violence and the atrocities he committed,</p>
<p>he, at least in the stories, has always provided the option</p>
<p>of not to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only if you resist, do,</p>
<p>so you basically have the option,</p>
<p>do you wanna join us or do you want to die?</p>
<p>And die horribly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the progressive sort of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the Bernie Sanders of the era.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So what do you make of that?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s so much of these great conquerors,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much murder that to us now would just seem insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny you mention it.</p>
<p>I think that maybe it&rsquo;s a human nature thing</p>
<p>that we want to, or maybe a misunderstanding thing</p>
<p>that we want to cast all of our characters and ourselves</p>
<p>maybe as entirely good or as entirely negative</p>
<p>when I guess the phrase or the saying,</p>
<p>one man&rsquo;s freedom fighter is another person&rsquo;s terrorist,</p>
<p>is accurate.</p>
<p>And a lot of times I think you can understand</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re able to look</p>
<p>from various people&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the TV show, The Wire,</p>
<p>which was obviously widely, everybody loves The Wire.</p>
<p>I thought that there were everyone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying anything that&rsquo;s not been said before,</p>
<p>compelling characters from all angles,</p>
<p>whether you like the character, dislike the character,</p>
<p>you were able to understand the motivations of people</p>
<p>doing various things.</p>
<p>Even if they did wrongly, they did rightly.</p>
<p>We want to cast all of the demons throughout history</p>
<p>as completely inhuman when I think that makes it difficult</p>
<p>for us to understand them.</p>
<p>And we want to look back at the people</p>
<p>that we think of as great and entirely great.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re experiencing the problems with this</p>
<p>even right now, socially and politically</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re trying to look back and decide</p>
<p>the people we thought were good or not good</p>
<p>or people we thought were bad are now good</p>
<p>rather than going, hey, there&rsquo;s good and bad to all things.</p>
<p>And there are, as you mentioned, the Genghis Khan thing,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to fight back.</p>
<p>You do, I respect you for it,</p>
<p>but then we&rsquo;re gonna have a conflict</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>And if you lose, you&rsquo;re gonna be sorry that you did</p>
<p>because I have to make it that way.</p>
<p>If I want to continue utilizing this kind of MO</p>
<p>because I need to discourage the next guy</p>
<p>from doing what you&rsquo;re doing right now.</p>
<p>And ultimately though, I guess that&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Imagine you put every single person</p>
<p>on planet earth in a cage, crime drops, all sorts.</p>
<p>There are certain positives to that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, things are as they are, it&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>but that is ultimately more the law of the jungle.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re able to supersede some of that now</p>
<p>in modern times and I think we&rsquo;re fortunate.</p>
<p>But as you mentioned, we look back and say,</p>
<p>oh, this is horrible.</p>
<p>Say, no, that just is what it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how life is at a base level.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re a lion and I&rsquo;m a gazelle,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like it very much,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t call the lion the bad guy.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t sanctify the gazelle or the other way around.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s interesting when you pull back</p>
<p>some of the controls that we put on our behavior</p>
<p>and in modern life,</p>
<p>which I think are generally speaking positive,</p>
<p>we get down to how things often are.</p>
<p>And at the same time, we could,</p>
<p>modern life was built by people like Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>So then you get down to the ends justifying the means.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t things with easy answers,</p>
<p>or at least if they are, I certainly don&rsquo;t have the smarts</p>
<p>to figure out the answers to them, but it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>I would just say people in the world are complicated</p>
<p>and layered and depending upon which side of the line</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re standing on at various times,</p>
<p>you may like or dislike someone,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t remember whose idea it was,</p>
<p>this is killing me, but it&rsquo;s the veil of ignorance,</p>
<p>I guess, the philosophical idea of the veil of ignorance</p>
<p>where I go, is sticking everyone in the cage</p>
<p>the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Or everyone but me, and I say, well, no, why?</p>
<p>Well, it would make my life easier</p>
<p>if I just went over and took all of your stuff</p>
<p>as long as you couldn&rsquo;t stop me.</p>
<p>I mean, of course that&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what everyone does in every video game.</p>
<p>But in Skyrim, you steal stuff when people aren&rsquo;t around.</p>
<p>But ultimately you go, well,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t the right thing to do</p>
<p>because if I were on the other side of it,</p>
<p>I would not appreciate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inherently not a good thing to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only doing it because I think I&rsquo;m gonna win.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fine way to be,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have the white hat on, I guess I would say.</p>
<p>So I think without those philosophical underpinnings</p>
<p>to rein us in, I guess, morally speaking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to say what&rsquo;s right or wrong.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d say certain actions have a reaction,</p>
<p>almost like a physics sense.</p>
<p>If you kill everyone in your way</p>
<p>for as long as you&rsquo;re able to, your life will be easier.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re setting the table for someone</p>
<p>doing the same to you when you&rsquo;re no longer the tough guy,</p>
<p>but it is what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you look at like the Instagram channel,</p>
<p>nature is metal, it hurts my heart to watch,</p>
<p>to remind me, a comfortable descendant of ape,</p>
<p>how vicious nature is, just unapologetically, just,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a process to it where the bad guy always wins.</p>
<p>The violence is the solution to most problems,</p>
<p>or the flip side of that running away from violence</p>
<p>is the solution depending on your skillset.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny to think of us humans</p>
<p>with our extra little piece of brain</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re somehow trying to figure out,</p>
<p>like you said, in a philosophical way,</p>
<p>how to supersede that, how to like move past the viciousness,</p>
<p>the cruelty, just the cold exchange of nature.</p>
<p>But perhaps it&rsquo;s not so, maybe that is nature,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s the way of life, maybe we&rsquo;re trying too hard to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re being too egotistical and thinking we&rsquo;re somehow</p>
<p>separate from nature, we&rsquo;re somehow distant</p>
<p>from that very thing.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more.</p>
<p>In fact, I think actually Orson Scott Card,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the writer of a great book called Ender&rsquo;s Game,</p>
<p>this was a statement that the main character,</p>
<p>Ender, made in the book.</p>
<p>His brother was brilliant.</p>
<p>His brother was like kind of sociopathic brilliant kid</p>
<p>that ended up kicked out of the school</p>
<p>that they were all into for Battle Commander.</p>
<p>Dealing with his brother taught him that ultimately strength,</p>
<p>courage, the ability to do violence</p>
<p>for all the good and the bad of that</p>
<p>is one of the fundamental most important things</p>
<p>to be able to do in life,</p>
<p>because if you can&rsquo;t cause destruction,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t cause pain,</p>
<p>you will be forever subject to those who can.</p>
<p>And I think that you mentioned egotism.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a disease</p>
<p>that could obviously strike any of us,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re looking at now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, I think we should be unbelievably thankful</p>
<p>as people that live in the world that we do</p>
<p>that we can walk down the street</p>
<p>without having to worry that I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>well, don&rsquo;t worry that that&rsquo;s six foot six,</p>
<p>270 pound person over there is just gonna leave me alone.</p>
<p>And I have a Rolex on, but whatever, I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Because that person is deciding to leave me alone</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve all agreed to live in this relatively sane</p>
<p>and or constrained society because it benefits all of us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing it because of a philosophical underpinning,</p>
<p>not because nature dictates it be that way,</p>
<p>because nature dictates it go in a very,</p>
<p>very different direction.</p>
<p>And the only person,</p>
<p>the only thing stopping that person</p>
<p>from doing something to me is either me, that person,</p>
<p>or someone else that will stand in between us.</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no one there to stand in between us,</p>
<p>then the only thing stopping that person is that person.</p>
<p>And I have to hope that they&rsquo;re either disinterested</p>
<p>or disinclined to do that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s keeping in mind</p>
<p>that that is the fundamental nature of the world,</p>
<p>whether we like it or not is important.</p>
<p>And I think the quest to fundamentally alter human nature</p>
<p>is gonna be ultimately fruitless.</p>
<p>And then also it&rsquo;s, it is a little bit egotistical.</p>
<p>A lion does what a lion does.</p>
<p>We can try to box it in and we can try to guide</p>
<p>this direction, that direction.</p>
<p>But nature is as it is and as it always will be</p>
<p>unless we wanna start to constrain it significantly.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m starting to get into individual rights</p>
<p>who put me in charge,</p>
<p>who says that I should be the one</p>
<p>to make the choices constraining</p>
<p>because many of the most awful things</p>
<p>that have happened throughout history,</p>
<p>one group or one person has decided to constrain others.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t like Genghis Khan doing that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll do that on a little level.</p>
<p>Are there gonna be benefits and beneficiaries?</p>
<p>Absolutely, but there&rsquo;ll be losers in that too.</p>
<p>So I guess it&rsquo;s a dangerous game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like putting on the one ring.</p>
<p>You remember when Frodo offered the one ring to Gandalf</p>
<p>and Gandalf said, no, no, I would take it away.</p>
<p>I would put it on.</p>
<p>I would use it out of the desire to do good.</p>
<p>But through me, it would wield a power so terrible</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the big question for anyone that decides</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to have reach and able to have power.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously I can&rsquo;t speak to that,</p>
<p>but imagine you did have national level,</p>
<p>global level power.</p>
<p>How would you use it?</p>
<p>Would you try to change the world?</p>
<p>Would you be glad that you did down the line?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the thing we&rsquo;re struggling now as a society.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;d be nice to get your quick comment on that,</p>
<p>which is the people who have traditionally been powerless</p>
<p>are now seeking a fairer society, a more equal society.</p>
<p>And in attaining more power justly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a realization, at least from my perspective,</p>
<p>that power corrupts everyone.</p>
<p>Even if the flag you wave is that of justice, right?</p>
<p>And so, not to overuse the term, but it&rsquo;d be nice</p>
<p>if you have thoughts about the whole idea of cancel culture</p>
<p>and the internet and Twitter and so on,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s nuanced, difficult discussions of race,</p>
<p>of gender, of fairness, equality, justice,</p>
<p>all of these kinds of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a shouting down oftentimes of nuanced discussion</p>
<p>of kind of trying to reason through these very difficult issues,</p>
<p>through our history, through what our future looks like.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts about the internet discourse</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on now?</p>
<p>Is there something positive?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting thing to see.</p>
<p>I guess, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re wielding power, whomever you are,</p>
<p>doing so carefully is important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, very easy to look at the people that have power</p>
<p>and that are using it poorly or have used it poorly</p>
<p>and go, hey, you&rsquo;re the bad guy.</p>
<p>And then go, well, of course, if I had power,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use it properly and I may intend to use it properly</p>
<p>and maybe I will.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we see a lot of times</p>
<p>people are people are people.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of the&hellip;</p>
<p>I think if you believe that human beings are all one,</p>
<p>which I do, no matter whether you&rsquo;re here or there,</p>
<p>you got two arms, two legs, a heart, a brain,</p>
<p>we all live a similar experience.</p>
<p>And obviously, with variations on a theme,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re no less a human being.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a person I&rsquo;ve never met from China,</p>
<p>than some person in Virginia, we&rsquo;re all people.</p>
<p>And I guess, ultimately, if I believe that human beings</p>
<p>are corruptible and that power corrupts</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re all fallible and we say and do things</p>
<p>that either intentionally or unintentionally</p>
<p>that we wish we&rsquo;d not, I think that I have to allow</p>
<p>for a space, I guess the word, it&rsquo;s almost a religious term,</p>
<p>but I guess I would just say grace.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I see disappearing from discourse</p>
<p>in the public, or maybe it wasn&rsquo;t there, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting watching this occur on the internet</p>
<p>because also now no longer are you and I just having a talk</p>
<p>sitting on a bus stop, it&rsquo;s now in writing.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s in writing.</p>
<p>The old saying, don&rsquo;t put that in writing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, don&rsquo;t put anything in writing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get in trouble.</p>
<p>And basically, with the degree to which everything</p>
<p>is recorded, but recorded in tiny little bites,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very easy for me to wave every last little foolish,</p>
<p>ignorant, incorrect, or correct thing that someone</p>
<p>has ever said or done in their face to support whatever</p>
<p>argument that I&rsquo;m trying to make about them or a situation.</p>
<p>And I think that you mentioned cancel culture,</p>
<p>as it seems to exist.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is poisonous on its face.</p>
<p>This is poisonous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sort of thing that doesn&rsquo;t incentivize</p>
<p>proper behavior.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at, let&rsquo;s say one of the great monsters</p>
<p>of history, Adolf Hitler, obviously, who&rsquo;s done awful,</p>
<p>awful things, but also for anyone that&rsquo;s even a minor</p>
<p>student of history, did some positive things as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to embroider this person&rsquo;s crimes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to act as if there was nothing good a monster has</p>
<p>ever done and nothing bad that a great person throughout history</p>
<p>has ever done.</p>
<p>But imagine the ghost of Adolf Hitler were to pop up and go,</p>
<p>oh, my gosh, guys, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>I know what I&rsquo;ve done, but I&rsquo;d like to apologize and start</p>
<p>to make it right.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you&rsquo;d hope that if he popped up over here,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d go, well, I don&rsquo;t really like what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that you&rsquo;re attempting</p>
<p>to make this right and push in a positive direction, even if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make it right.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, what am I doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disincentivizing change for the better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking to wield whatever power I have in a punitive</p>
<p>fashion, which does not encourage people to do anything</p>
<p>other than double down on the wrongs that they&rsquo;ve made,</p>
<p>knowing that at least they&rsquo;re going to have some support from</p>
<p>the people that support that.</p>
<p>And I guess I want to, you would hopefully look at the use</p>
<p>of the internet as a tool that can educate, and I guess I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like the word empower, but empower people to do various</p>
<p>things, extend their reach, but educate and learn rather than</p>
<p>to further solidify little tribal things that exist, which</p>
<p>I think everyone in humanity and human history is vulnerable</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the course of human history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deeply tribal.</p>
<p>And the tribes or the groups that have been on top at various</p>
<p>points in time have done a lot of times bad things to the</p>
<p>ones that have not.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d hope that we could learn lessons from the past</p>
<p>and rather than committing the crimes that were committed</p>
<p>against us, recommitting them when we slide into the top</p>
<p>position, say, I could do this now, but I&rsquo;ll not.</p>
<p>I understand the urge to seek vengeance is strong.</p>
<p>Anyone that says differently, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we have enough experience in history,</p>
<p>enough experience in life, enough hopefully wisdom time in</p>
<p>to go, this isn&rsquo;t the right answer.</p>
<p>This is only going to replay the things.</p>
<p>The worst parts of our history, not the best.</p>
<p>And I want to encourage positive behavior.</p>
<p>And if I just, again, further lash out at people, although</p>
<p>understandably, done understandably, I&rsquo;m simply just</p>
<p>going to just perpetuate the cycle that&rsquo;s gone on to this</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>So you hope that even though we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of turmoil</p>
<p>societally at the moment and globally at the moment, that I</p>
<p>guess our better angels can prevail at a certain point.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to take a great deal of leadership.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re sorely missing like a Martin Luther</p>
<p>King style character at the moment or a great leader.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hoping that one will show up.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And by the way, a word I don&rsquo;t hear often, and I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a beautiful one, which is grace.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting word.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to think about that.</p>
<p>There is a religious component to it, but it&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>You have to somehow walk the line between, you know, you</p>
<p>mentioned Hitler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really thinking about the 1930s and what it&rsquo;s like to</p>
<p>have economic.</p>
<p>My concern is the economic pain that people are feeling now</p>
<p>quietly is really a suffering that&rsquo;s not being heard.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s echoes of that in the 20s and the 30s with the</p>
<p>Great Depression.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a hunger for a charismatic leader.</p>
<p>Like you said, there&rsquo;s a leader that could walk with grace,</p>
<p>could inspire, could bring people together with sort of dreams</p>
<p>of a better future that&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>But Hitler did exactly everything that I just said, except</p>
<p>for the word positive, which is he did give a dream to the</p>
<p>German people who were great people, who are great people</p>
<p>of a better future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that a certain point that quickly turned into the</p>
<p>better future requires literally expansion of more land.</p>
<p>It started with, well, if we want to build a great Germany,</p>
<p>we need a little bit more land.</p>
<p>And so we need to kind of get Austria, then we need to kind</p>
<p>of get France, mostly because France doesn&rsquo;t understand that</p>
<p>more land is really useful.</p>
<p>So we need to get rid of them.</p>
<p>And look what they did to us in Versailles anyway.</p>
<p>But so the Jewish, the Holocaust is a separate thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think of it because so me being Jewish</p>
<p>and having a lot of the echoes of the suffering is in my</p>
<p>family or the people that are lost.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because Hitler wrote all about it in Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if the evil he committed was there all along.</p>
<p>I mean, and that&rsquo;s where the question of forgiveness, I mean,</p>
<p>Hitler is such a difficult person to talk about, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the question of cancer culture, who is deserving of forgiveness</p>
<p>and who is not like the Holocaust survivors that I&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>about that I&rsquo;ve heard the interviews with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve often spoken about the fact that the way for them</p>
<p>to let go, to overcome the atrocities that they&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>is to forgive.</p>
<p>Like forgiveness is the way out for them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re even as a society ready to even</p>
<p>contemplate an idea of forgiveness for Hitler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting idea though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thought exercise at the very least to think about</p>
<p>like all these people that are being canceled for doing bad</p>
<p>things of different degrees.</p>
<p>Think of like Louis CK or somebody like that for being</p>
<p>not a good person, but like, what is the path for forgiveness?</p>
<p>And also what&rsquo;s a good person?</p>
<p>What is a good person?</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s a sliding scale that we could all find ourselves</p>
<p>looking at the uncomfortable end of a gun on, you know,</p>
<p>particularly down the line.</p>
<p>I mean, you hope for the best, but these definitions, I guess,</p>
<p>like you said, are important and who&rsquo;s doing the canceling,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s being canceled.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily, as you said, saying that that&rsquo;s entirely</p>
<p>unjustified or certainly not, it&rsquo;s certainly understandable.</p>
<p>And particularly you mentioned like a monster, like an Adolf</p>
<p>Hitler, but it&rsquo;s also interesting.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice, like you mentioned as a society,</p>
<p>us being able to apply forgiveness to someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done so much horror, but people who are personal, I mean,</p>
<p>of course, many of us, so many people in person affected,</p>
<p>but directly personally affected someone, a survivor of the</p>
<p>Holocaust being able to let go on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nowhere near big enough a person for that sort of thing.</p>
<p>But I guess that&rsquo;s an interesting thing, you know, being</p>
<p>the person who was physically there, potentially able to</p>
<p>let go, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s unbelievably powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I guess you have to wonder sometimes, and this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>obviously in regards to the Holocaust, but why I&rsquo;m holding</p>
<p>on to various things, have I, what is it doing for me and</p>
<p>what is it doing to me?</p>
<p>Is it facilitative, is it not?</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s something else that I really want to</p>
<p>talk about, something else that I really enjoy.</p>
<p>When I was on Ultimate Fighter, they don&rsquo;t let you have any</p>
<p>music or any books.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have religious texts, so I brought a Bible and I</p>
<p>brought a Quran and I started to read them side by side.</p>
<p>And it was really interesting reading.</p>
<p>The Bible&rsquo;s a little drier, the Quran&rsquo;s more interesting,</p>
<p>at least written.</p>
<p>But I think something that was consistently brought up was</p>
<p>the way, most merciful.</p>
<p>People want, I don&rsquo;t think any of us want justice.</p>
<p>We think we want justice, but I don&rsquo;t think we want justice.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous game, because maybe</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s wronged me deeply and I want justice.</p>
<p>I want to balance it out, because what is justice if not</p>
<p>a balancing of the scales?</p>
<p>And sometimes you can understand it on a societal</p>
<p>level, I think it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s crime and punishment and we can go for</p>
<p>the benefits and the drawbacks of that.</p>
<p>But I think what any of us want is mercy within reason, grace,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, because justice is a very, very, very</p>
<p>dangerous thing and it&rsquo;s a valuable and important thing.</p>
<p>But who gets to decide what&rsquo;s just, what justice is actually</p>
<p>meted out?</p>
<p>Maybe I get to meet out justice, but it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>my comeuppance.</p>
<p>Well, that sounds great, but what happens when it&rsquo;s pointed</p>
<p>back at me?</p>
<p>And I guess that comes back to the veil of ignorance, the</p>
<p>idea that one day I will have to live in the world in which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve envisioned and the world in which I&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of times people love the idea of they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a judge for your crimes and a lawyer for theirs.</p>
<p>And I heard that the other day.</p>
<p>I thought that was great.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a dangerous thing and hopefully it gives</p>
<p>us all pause before rightly or wrongly, but always understandably</p>
<p>wielding serious power.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Justice is a kind of drug.</p>
<p>So if you look at history, I&rsquo;ve also been reading a lot</p>
<p>about Stalin.</p>
<p>I mean, all those folks really, I don&rsquo;t know what was inside</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s head actually that he&rsquo;s a tricky one because I think</p>
<p>he was legitimately insane.</p>
<p>Stalin was not.</p>
<p>And Stalin was like, he literally thought he&rsquo;s doing a good</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>He literally thought for the entirety of the time that communism</p>
<p>is going to bring, like that&rsquo;s the utopia and he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>create a happy world.</p>
<p>And in his, in his mind were ideas of justice, of fairness,</p>
<p>of happiness, of, of yeah, human flourishing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a drug and it&rsquo;s somehow sadly pollutes the</p>
<p>mind when you start thinking like that, what&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>society and believing that you have a good sense of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s intoxicating, especially when others around you are</p>
<p>feeling the same way.</p>
<p>And then you start like building up this movement and you</p>
<p>forget that you are just like, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re like barely</p>
<p>recently evolved from an ape.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t know what the hell you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And then you start like killing witches or whatever.</p>
<p>Like you start, you start doing.</p>
<p>They did math.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest though.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes you got a witch has to go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We can all agree that a witch, a witch has to go if, if it</p>
<p>floats or sinks, which one, I forget which one.</p>
<p>Whichever one we need at the time, honestly.</p>
<p>Is it floating?</p>
<p>It should have sunk.</p>
<p>Yeah, but yeah, we can definitely agree that witches</p>
<p>have to go because you brought it up.</p>
<p>I tweeted recently, but also just, I&rsquo;m one of the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really ashamed of in my life is I haven&rsquo;t really read</p>
<p>almost any of the sci fi classics.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like I, my whole journey through reading was through</p>
<p>like the literary philosophers that would say like Camus,</p>
<p>Hase, Dostoevsky, Kafka, like that place, like that&rsquo;s a kind</p>
<p>of sci fi world in itself, but it&rsquo;s, it just, it creates a</p>
<p>world in which the, the deepest questions about human nature</p>
<p>can be explored.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize this, but the sci fi world is the same.</p>
<p>It just puts it in a, it like removes it from any kind of</p>
<p>historical context where you can explore those same ideas</p>
<p>in like space somewhere elsewhere in a different time,</p>
<p>a different place.</p>
<p>It allows you almost like more freedom to like construct</p>
<p>these artificial things where you can just do crazy, crazy</p>
<p>kind of human experiments.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now working through it.</p>
<p>The books on my list are the foundation series by</p>
<p>Isaac Asimov, Dune, Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson and</p>
<p>Ender&rsquo;s Game, like you mentioned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just kind of, and then, so I posted that.</p>
<p>And then of course, like Elon Musk, John Carmack, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you know him, creator of Doom and Quake.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>See, they all pitched in these nerds, these ultra nerds</p>
<p>just started like going like these, you need to read this,</p>
<p>that and the other.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve like started working out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it seems like the list I&rsquo;ve mentioned holds up somewhat.</p>
<p>Is there a book?</p>
<p>Is there sci fi books or series or authors that you find</p>
<p>are just amazing?</p>
<p>Maybe another way to ask that is like, what&rsquo;s the greatest</p>
<p>sci fi book of all time?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to start by sharing something that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>embarrassed about is that I haven&rsquo;t read anything other</p>
<p>than, you know, Orson Scott Card, J.R. Tolkien,</p>
<p>Frank Herbert Tolkien.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m aware through Wikipedia and through surface</p>
<p>reading of things that like a book called the Republic</p>
<p>was written once.</p>
<p>There were some other&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you read Wikipedia?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a prolific reader of Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>Well, or occasional.</p>
<p>Occasional reader.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>In between whatever else it is that I waste my time on.</p>
<p>But yeah, so I also, I should say, I posted on Reddit</p>
<p>questions for Ryan Hall and there&rsquo;s like a million</p>
<p>questions, but like half of them have to do with Dune.</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>But like people bring up Dune.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why.</p>
<p>Did you mention Dune before?</p>
<p>Well, actually, we actually have a showy role actually</p>
<p>made us a Gi, a Dune themed Gi one time, which I thought</p>
<p>was kind of cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one.</p>
<p>We got extra stuff.</p>
<p>But actually, to your point, actually, this is Orson Scott</p>
<p>Card quote, actually the writer of Ender&rsquo;s Game.</p>
<p>Fiction, because it&rsquo;s not about somebody who actually</p>
<p>lived in the real world always has the possibility of being</p>
<p>about oneself.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a neat thing because I have heard other</p>
<p>people whom I respect and very sharp people actually every</p>
<p>now and then dig their heels and going, I don&rsquo;t like fiction.</p>
<p>I only like nonfiction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more instructive.</p>
<p>And I would go, I completely disagree with that.</p>
<p>I think we have a hard enough time figuring out what happened</p>
<p>at 711 three hours ago that, let me tell you what happened</p>
<p>600 years BC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hey, I&rsquo;m interested.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t tell me this isn&rsquo;t a story too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s factual components, I have no doubt.</p>
<p>But we struggle sometimes to like, I guess what I like</p>
<p>about fiction is that you can tell me a story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about people.</p>
<p>I mean, every now there&rsquo;s more and less believable things.</p>
<p>And I think Dune would be an unbelievably well written,</p>
<p>in my opinion, for to run, what do I know?</p>
<p>But I really liked doing, I&rsquo;ll say that well written example</p>
<p>of human beings interacting with one another, the political</p>
<p>component to that, the emotional, the intellectual, the</p>
<p>relationship components, all of that.</p>
<p>And I think that Dune is neat because it&rsquo;s a sci fi, not</p>
<p>a sci fi novel, but only in the only in the loosest sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a story about religion, about group dynamics,</p>
<p>about human potential, about belief, learning, politics,</p>
<p>governance, ecology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best stories remind me of history the same way</p>
<p>history hopefully is not just a list of facts that I try to be</p>
<p>able to recall or factoids that I try to recall, but a story</p>
<p>that I can understand and see how the threads of time kind</p>
<p>of came together and created certain things.</p>
<p>And a lot of times, like we say, I&rsquo;m like, how the heck is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on right now or 100 years from now or 100 years</p>
<p>in the past happened.</p>
<p>And you can look back far enough.</p>
<p>If we had accurate knowledge, if we had that hypothetical</p>
<p>perfect pool shot at the beginning of time, we would see</p>
<p>an unbroken chain of events that led us to where we are and</p>
<p>where we are will potentially lead us to where we&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>which is, again, why hindsight is helpful.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s neat.</p>
<p>Like, I guess I really enjoy, for instance, a book like</p>
<p>Dune, and they&rsquo;re actually making a movie out of it, which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical of, to be honest, because it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>difficult to bring that to the screen for a variety of</p>
<p>reasons, but there&rsquo;s at least a hundred questions.</p>
<p>Ask Ryan, what do you think about the new Dune movie?</p>
<p>I am not enough of an authority to have any sort of decent</p>
<p>opinion, but I guess what I would say is so much of it</p>
<p>goes on in the character&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Like how much of any of our days is any lived experience,</p>
<p>as it were, is internal, but the majority, how many times</p>
<p>are people walking around and, you know, they&rsquo;re like, hey,</p>
<p>what do you see right now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, well, I see this picture.</p>
<p>I see a wall.</p>
<p>Hey, there&rsquo;s Lex.</p>
<p>But really what I was paying attention to was what was</p>
<p>going on inside of my head for a moment, and almost the rest</p>
<p>of the world tuned out and kind of dimmed.</p>
<p>And I guess I think that&rsquo;s going to be a struggle to any</p>
<p>time you want to bring that type of a written story to a</p>
<p>visual medium.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be more difficult, but it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely one of my favorite stories, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>honestly helped me become better at life, in my opinion,</p>
<p>better at martial arts.</p>
<p>And I think the writer, I think Frank Herbert was absolutely</p>
<p>brilliant, whether those were all his ideas, which are not</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>None of us or all of our good ideas aren&rsquo;t ours.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a combination.</p>
<p>Maybe it came up with something you&rsquo;re a curator of other</p>
<p>good ideas and some things you borrowed from somewhere</p>
<p>without even realizing it.</p>
<p>But I think the way the messages and the themes and the</p>
<p>ideas that were conveyed, particularly in the original</p>
<p>novel, are just absolutely brilliant.</p>
<p>Is that to you one of the greats and the flip side of</p>
<p>that, or another way to ask that is if somebody is new to</p>
<p>sci fi, is that something you would recommend that is an</p>
<p>entry point?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not well read enough in the sci fi world.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read a lot of Isaac Asimov or anything like that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll recommend Dune.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be an obnoxious evangelist for Dune to anyone who&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>listen.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would strongly recommend it.</p>
<p>So the other thing you mentioned, now I should</p>
<p>probably be talking to you about much more important</p>
<p>things, but the other thing is Skyrim.</p>
<p>Do you play video games?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite game?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what would you say is the greatest video game of</p>
<p>all time?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Elder Scrolls.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I play a little bit at this point.</p>
<p>You know, a little less finally moves into a new house.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like an adult.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a better funded 12 year old.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s yeah, that&rsquo;s entirely that&rsquo;s entirely</p>
<p>accurate.</p>
<p>Better funded 12 year old.</p>
<p>But somewhat better funded 12 year old.</p>
<p>Not as well funded as I wish.</p>
<p>But historically, did you play video games?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I played as a kid.</p>
<p>I was, you know, again, I&rsquo;ve always liked playing sports</p>
<p>and liked reading and I always enjoyed video games.</p>
<p>But my favorite video game I think I&rsquo;ve ever played was</p>
<p>Knights of the Old Republic.</p>
<p>It was a Star Wars game.</p>
<p>A huge Star Wars fan until it become less so recently.</p>
<p>Disney.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like the, I haven&rsquo;t watched it yet.</p>
<p>Oh, Mandalorian.</p>
<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>Oh, actually, I like Mandalorian.</p>
<p>That was actually pretty cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, waving this off.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I will.</p>
<p>If I could cancel one thing, I would cancel Disney Star Wars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to edit that part out.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go to the next.</p>
<p>But this is where if people are wondering if you&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>this on YouTube and like the dislike amount is like 80%</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of that comment.</p>
<p>So good job.</p>
<p>Good job for making the internet hate you.</p>
<p>I regret nothing.</p>
<p>Now, what about Baby Yoda?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess he&rsquo;s like little.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got ears and he uses the force sometimes and he passes</p>
<p>out again.</p>
<p>No qualms with Baby Yoda.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don&rsquo;t have a heart.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go to Jiu Jitsu if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So the audience of this podcast may not know much about Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>or they do because it&rsquo;s really part of the culture now,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t really know much.</p>
<p>They see that so many people have fallen in love with it,</p>
<p>have been transformed through it, but they don&rsquo;t know much</p>
<p>about like, what is this thing?</p>
<p>Is there a way you could sort of try to explain what is</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu, what is the essence of this martial art that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>captured the minds and hearts of so many people in the world?</p>
<p>I think that Jiu Jitsu is a philosophy that&rsquo;s expressed</p>
<p>physically and that it&rsquo;s the kind of development of the</p>
<p>mental capacity and physical capacity working in unison to</p>
<p>move efficiently and almost flowingly, unresistingly with</p>
<p>a given situation, with a physically resisting opponent.</p>
<p>Learning how to generate force on your own and how to steal</p>
<p>force from the floor, how to steal force from the other</p>
<p>person and move in concert with it as opposed to clash</p>
<p>against, which if you watch two untrained people fight,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost entirely a clash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a runaway and clash, a runaway and clash.</p>
<p>If you watch Jiu Jitsu done well, it looks like water</p>
<p>moving around a solid structure.</p>
<p>And I think that that is expressed physically.</p>
<p>And I think that all of the things that anyone has really</p>
<p>been able to do very, very well in Jiu Jitsu end up kind</p>
<p>of exemplifying that.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s true of martial arts in general.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of times like the clashing that we see</p>
<p>going on and working well is just the fact that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know, you get very, very physically powerful people</p>
<p>every now and then they&rsquo;re able to get away with this.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s fantastic</p>
<p>because ultimately it&rsquo;s a results driven thing.</p>
<p>But I think that the essence of the martial arts is learning</p>
<p>how to make more out of less and how to move with</p>
<p>and be yielding, almost like real life Aikido.</p>
<p>And so you think of martial arts, Jiu Jitsu as like water</p>
<p>or flowing, so Aikido, so moving around a solid structure</p>
<p>so Aikido, so moving around the force as opposed to sort of</p>
<p>maybe the wrestling mindset is finding a leverage</p>
<p>where you can apply an exceptional amount of force.</p>
<p>So like, so like maximizing the application of force.</p>
<p>I guess maybe that&rsquo;s a better way to, I&rsquo;d like to marry</p>
<p>the two ideas, you know, because I think you flow</p>
<p>until the point at which you are the greater force</p>
<p>at which point in time you can apply.</p>
<p>But if you look at the best wrestlers and then when I say</p>
<p>best, I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean most successful</p>
<p>although of course most successful are always very</p>
<p>very good throughout the course of history in boxing</p>
<p>in wrestling, in Judo, they&rsquo;re magical.</p>
<p>They disappear and reappear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like fighting a ghost that is like incorporeal</p>
<p>when you want to find it.</p>
<p>But then when you don&rsquo;t want it to find it</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t want to find it, it finds you.</p>
<p>And I think that we see that in the like the Bufais</p>
<p>or societies of wrestling.</p>
<p>And you know, I guess you could look at a Floyd Mayweather</p>
<p>or Willie Pep or you know, Prunell Whitaker in boxing</p>
<p>as brilliant examples of disappearing and reappearing.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re strong, it&rsquo;s almost like guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re strong, I&rsquo;m nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re weak, you can&rsquo;t get rid of me.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Yes, the TF brothers are incredible at that.</p>
<p>They just, they look like skinny Starbucks baristas</p>
<p>and they just manhandle everybody like effortlessly.</p>
<p>They look like they just kind of woke up,</p>
<p>rolled out of bed, fighting for like the gold medal</p>
<p>at the Olympics and just effortlessly throw,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a match against, I guess, Yul Romero.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like, you know, if you look at like</p>
<p>who is the guy who&rsquo;s like intimidating in this case</p>
<p>and terrifying looking, it&rsquo;s Yul Romero,</p>
<p>just like a physical specimen</p>
<p>and obviously like a super accomplished wrestler.</p>
<p>I think this is for the gold medal, yeah.</p>
<p>In 2000.</p>
<p>In 2000?</p>
<p>Yeah, Sydney.</p>
<p>And then there, this is the year you all took silver.</p>
<p>And what you, like, just to show you like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a inside trip, effortless.</p>
<p>Uchi, and he does it again.</p>
<p>Yep, you know, it&rsquo;s a really creative kind of wrestling</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s organic.</p>
<p>Yeah, you throw in all of these kinds of things.</p>
<p>This is a mix of judo, a mix of like weird kind of moves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like as funky as Ben Askren.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like legitimate, basic.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not funky for funky sake.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not poking at Ben Askren to imply</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing, but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, a lot of times it&rsquo;s almost like Musashi</p>
<p>talked a lot about that.</p>
<p>You know, that the only goal of combat is to win</p>
<p>is the outcome is it&rsquo;s outcome driven</p>
<p>versus like flourishing, you know, cool looking movements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, unless that had a utilitarian purpose,</p>
<p>like what are you wasting your time with that?</p>
<p>Both in the fight and also, you know, in practice.</p>
<p>But as you mentioned, it&rsquo;s almost like it looks like judo.</p>
<p>It looks like wrestling, it looks like jujitsu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, I guess the reminds me</p>
<p>all of the martial arts is again, deeply tribal as well.</p>
<p>I wanna learn Lex Fridman, martial arts.</p>
<p>And then I wanna learn another, you know,</p>
<p>I guess, transcendent person&rsquo;s martial arts.</p>
<p>And it just happened to be the set of movements</p>
<p>that you tended to do most of the time,</p>
<p>thanks to your body type and your opposition and whatnot.</p>
<p>But then I try to codify that and force those to work</p>
<p>as opposed to going, I wanna understand how the body works</p>
<p>in concert and in Congress with something else</p>
<p>and other forces and move appropriately.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s like, it always struck me</p>
<p>that the Saiki brothers are great examples</p>
<p>of just moving like water, but they,</p>
<p>to use Bruce Lee, which is a little trite,</p>
<p>but again, he&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like water can flow or water can crash.</p>
<p>And they would crash when they needed to crash</p>
<p>and they would flow when they needed to flow,</p>
<p>but they would flow for the purpose of dissipating</p>
<p>and then crash when they would win.</p>
<p>And at the right moment, then go back to flowing</p>
<p>the second that the other person found them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s beautiful to watch, it&rsquo;s artistic.</p>
<p>And I think that that great expression of anything physical</p>
<p>is ultimately studied as a science,</p>
<p>but expressed as an art.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s something that gets lost</p>
<p>in jujitsu a lot of times when it gets a little bit,</p>
<p>a little nerdy, like do this hand here, hand here.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like the more details I have,</p>
<p>the better when in reality, that&rsquo;s just not,</p>
<p>not in my experience, how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Might be fun exercise of saying like,</p>
<p>what are the main positions and submissions</p>
<p>in the art of jujitsu?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be complete, that&rsquo;s a ridiculously,</p>
<p>I apologize for putting you on a spot like this,</p>
<p>but it might be a nice exercise to think through it.</p>
<p>Sure, I mean, I would just say that there,</p>
<p>you have your arms bend in various ways.</p>
<p>You have key lock Americana, straight arm locks,</p>
<p>Kimura, omoplata, omoplata is a Kimura,</p>
<p>Kimura is an omoplata, it&rsquo;s just executed.</p>
<p>Submissions.</p>
<p>Submissions, yes.</p>
<p>Breaking off your arm in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the question is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you were a Terminator,</p>
<p>like a robot that I, which of course you are.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, so we&rsquo;re being completely literal.</p>
<p>But, and I couldn&rsquo;t harm you with any of these things.</p>
<p>Would I still use these positions?</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>They create leverage, they create control,</p>
<p>they create shapes that I can affect</p>
<p>and that can affect me and they can be affected</p>
<p>through other forces and other objects or structures</p>
<p>like the ground or the wall.</p>
<p>I really enjoy mixed martial arts</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s another component</p>
<p>rather than just me and you and the floor,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s me, you, the floor, and the wall.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s another player in the game</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t exist in a grappling context</p>
<p>with a non enclosed, I guess, area of combat.</p>
<p>But you can strangle me or choke me,</p>
<p>what do you call it, without my arms being involved,</p>
<p>or you can use one of my shoulders</p>
<p>to pin one side of my, one carotid artery off</p>
<p>and you can enclose the other.</p>
<p>You can turn my knee in the exact same ways</p>
<p>that you can turn my arm straight this way and that way.</p>
<p>You can add a rotation to that</p>
<p>or it can be directly linear against the joint.</p>
<p>So I guess what I would say is the more</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been able to understand jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>the more that I&rsquo;ve been, it&rsquo;s given me a look</p>
<p>into how we learn language where rather</p>
<p>than learning five bazillion adjectives,</p>
<p>I go, I understand what an adjective is.</p>
<p>And of course we are all read</p>
<p>into some degree of vocabulary.</p>
<p>I understand what an adverb does</p>
<p>and I understand what an adverb is.</p>
<p>I know what a noun is.</p>
<p>I know what the component parts of a sentence are.</p>
<p>I know what, you know, I guess a clause,</p>
<p>a contraction, any of these things.</p>
<p>And it allows you to be interesting and artistic</p>
<p>with your language to the extent that you can.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t, like I can speak a degree of Spanish,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not even slightly artistic in Spanish.</p>
<p>I would be something, I speak like a child</p>
<p>with a head injury.</p>
<p>And anyway, the I.</p>
<p>Your basic understanding of the English language</p>
<p>allows you to then be a student of Spanish.</p>
<p>100%, but I&rsquo;m limited by my experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m limited by my understanding of techniques.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m limited by my understanding, almost like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say techniques are like these are like vocabulary.</p>
<p>So even if I kind of sort of grasp the sentence structure</p>
<p>and the thought process and the thought patterns</p>
<p>of Spanish, which it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because just even though the orientation</p>
<p>and the organization of a language,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve thought about this a great deal,</p>
<p>you know, the way that I perceive the world</p>
<p>is affected deeply by the language that I learned.</p>
<p>The, you know, the, again, if I learned,</p>
<p>I have no idea how the Chinese language structures,</p>
<p>but I can only imagine that it would be,</p>
<p>that it would affect, it&rsquo;s like a different lens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all looking at the same thing,</p>
<p>but I have a different set of sunglasses on than you do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very, very interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the Quran as an example.</p>
<p>You know, apparently it&rsquo;s unbelievably poetic</p>
<p>and in Arabic, still neat</p>
<p>and was interesting reading in English,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m told by people that I trust</p>
<p>that it just one doesn&rsquo;t bear a resemblance to the other.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a very interesting thing</p>
<p>that you may be able to say the same thing,</p>
<p>but in a more, I guess, in a different way,</p>
<p>in a more artistic way that may not translate</p>
<p>on a one for one kind of fidelity.</p>
<p>But the more that we&rsquo;re able to understand</p>
<p>about how the body works,</p>
<p>the more examples of the body working this way,</p>
<p>the body working that way, the body working that way,</p>
<p>the more that I&rsquo;m able to eventually become an artist,</p>
<p>but it has to be studied as a science first.</p>
<p>And it does start with technique collection,</p>
<p>vocabulary collection, the same way we learn in school.</p>
<p>You remember how to say quickly 17 different ways.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say I speak Spanish, I&rsquo;m only, I only know three.</p>
<p>So you might use quickly, you might use an adjective</p>
<p>like quickly in Spanish, but use one of the many,</p>
<p>many options to describe that, that I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And now I sit there and go like, wait, what?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be artistic.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be as organic with the language as I&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>So I believe that jujitsu a lot of times starts</p>
<p>with the acquisition of a lot of, hey, do this, this,</p>
<p>this drill, this technique.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an Americana, Americana to an armlock,</p>
<p>armlock to a triangle.</p>
<p>But the problem with that is oftentimes</p>
<p>we get stuck in that phase.</p>
<p>And people eventually become move collectors</p>
<p>or sequence collectors.</p>
<p>And I noticed this when I&rsquo;m trying to do DVDs</p>
<p>or I guess like an instructional series now,</p>
<p>or even teaching in class,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in that form of learning anymore.</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s not valuable, but I don&rsquo;t believe,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand jujitsu on that level anymore.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to do is get across the basic ideas</p>
<p>to people and say, hey, you need to fill in the gaps</p>
<p>with going to class all the time.</p>
<p>You need to go, hey, learn this move, learn that technique,</p>
<p>learn that technique.</p>
<p>Because otherwise I&rsquo;m basically just throwing at you</p>
<p>like 75 different words that you could use,</p>
<p>but that hasn&rsquo;t really taught you how to speak a language.</p>
<p>Whereas if you give me a language structure,</p>
<p>you can fill in these pieces on your own</p>
<p>and then eventually speak organically in Lex form,</p>
<p>which will be ultimately unique to you</p>
<p>because otherwise you just end up being like a weird facsimile</p>
<p>of whatever it is that I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>for mostly the worst I&rsquo;d say, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what people, I mean, people comment like,</p>
<p>is this, especially people who haven&rsquo;t listened to me before,</p>
<p>is this guy drunk or high?</p>
<p>Does he, does MIT really allow slow people to be,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s. Quotas.</p>
<p>Quotas, yeah.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s wrong with him?</p>
<p>Is he getting sleep?</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Does he need help?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s similar with my jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, is this guy, is this guy really,</p>
<p>whatever rank I was throughout,</p>
<p>I remember just like, is this guy really this rank?</p>
<p>I just have a very kind of certain way of sitting</p>
<p>and being slow and lazy looking</p>
<p>that there was ultimately the language</p>
<p>that I had to discover.</p>
<p>And it was, it was, yeah,</p>
<p>it was a very liberating moment.</p>
<p>I think of probably a few years of getting my ass kicked,</p>
<p>especially with Open Guard and butterfly</p>
<p>to where you really allow yourself</p>
<p>to take in the entirety of the language</p>
<p>and realize that, that I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a unique, I&rsquo;m unique.</p>
<p>And like, I have a very, I have a language,</p>
<p>I have a set of techniques,</p>
<p>a way I move my body that needs,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m the one to discover.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, you can only,</p>
<p>you can learn specific techniques and so on,</p>
<p>but you really have to understand your own body.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>like you said, is like the connection about your philosophy,</p>
<p>your view of the world with the physical</p>
<p>and like connecting those two things,</p>
<p>how you perceive the world,</p>
<p>how you interpret ideas of the world about exhaustion,</p>
<p>about force, about effortlessness,</p>
<p>like what it really means to relax,</p>
<p>all these kinds of loose concepts,</p>
<p>and then actually teach your body to like do those things</p>
<p>and like, you know, and be able to apply force and spurts,</p>
<p>be able to relax and spurts</p>
<p>and like figure all that stuff out for my,</p>
<p>for my individual body.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more, it&rsquo;s a discovery process</p>
<p>and no one can cheat that process,</p>
<p>which is at the same time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like imagine I wanna start writing books</p>
<p>in second grade, unless maybe I&rsquo;m like staggeringly brilliant,</p>
<p>which I can only conceptualize someone being able to do that,</p>
<p>but maybe a Mozart of the English language</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re out there doing it.</p>
<p>But for most of us, we don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge,</p>
<p>enough information, enough experience</p>
<p>to be able to be, to express ourselves.</p>
<p>So we have to basically input, repeat, which is important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the process, as you say,</p>
<p>of going through that, of getting your ass kicked,</p>
<p>of just like, well, that didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>well, that didn&rsquo;t work, that felt right,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, nobody else does that,</p>
<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t believe in that,</p>
<p>versus eventually going, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just try going my own way and see what happens</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;ll get yelled at and people won&rsquo;t like me</p>
<p>and if it works, they&rsquo;ll say I got lucky</p>
<p>and if it doesn&rsquo;t work, they&rsquo;ll say I was dumb,</p>
<p>but which one, maybe all is right.</p>
<p>But basically, you know,</p>
<p>going through that iterative process</p>
<p>that allows you to eventually find your self expression</p>
<p>and find your voice so that you fight</p>
<p>the same way that you speak, the same way that you write,</p>
<p>the same way that you think in a way that is uniquely you,</p>
<p>that will also ultimately allow you</p>
<p>to understand other people being uniquely them</p>
<p>because even if you can only conceptualize,</p>
<p>and I think about this a lot for society stuff,</p>
<p>where I go, well, this is how I feel about this,</p>
<p>but am I objectively right?</p>
<p>Maybe about a couple things, but that&rsquo;s a small box</p>
<p>that I have to be very, very careful about</p>
<p>what I think is objective versus what&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>and I have to be open to the possibility</p>
<p>of all the things that I think are objectively correct</p>
<p>may or may not be.</p>
<p>And that should allow me to have some degree</p>
<p>of compassion or consideration for other people,</p>
<p>both in their martial arts journey</p>
<p>and in their journey as people, as human beings,</p>
<p>because I understand that they&rsquo;re on a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, we&rsquo;re all on a path where it&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>again, an iterative process of eventual self expression,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that we see having trouble when we see tribalism,</p>
<p>which, I mean, racism, expression of that,</p>
<p>political affiliation, expression of that,</p>
<p>all of these things that can go</p>
<p>in really uncomfortable directions.</p>
<p>People are looking for,</p>
<p>hey, where do I plant my feet over here?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the thing that I know is right?</p>
<p>And we can all agree on the following.</p>
<p>And I think that we see that in martial arts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, oh, I do this style, I do that style,</p>
<p>I do that style.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, man, we&rsquo;re all just pushing forward</p>
<p>in a certain direction here, trying to do our best.</p>
<p>And I understand why you feel the way you do.</p>
<p>I may have felt like that at one point too,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just trying to learn and understand</p>
<p>versus I&rsquo;ve already acquired enough knowledge,</p>
<p>let me cross my arms and start to look</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s fucking up around here.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s an, it&rsquo;s an interesting trap</p>
<p>that I think is very human trap to fall into,</p>
<p>but it definitely happens early on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s a joke in the jiu jitsu world, right?</p>
<p>Like, oh, the blue belt that knows everything.</p>
<p>Well, initially it&rsquo;s like, what, I know nothing</p>
<p>and I at least think I know nothing.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d learn a little bit and I think it&rsquo;s a lot bit.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the more you learn,</p>
<p>the more you go like, I don&rsquo;t even know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>We kind of talked about it a little bit,</p>
<p>but once again, a lot of people that listen to this</p>
<p>have never been on the mat, have never tried jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>but are really curious about it.</p>
<p>Everybody at all positions, like I think, you know,</p>
<p>most kids are not doing jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Andrew Yang is like, they&rsquo;re all, you know,</p>
<p>the world is curious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a nice, it seems to be a nice methodology</p>
<p>by which to humble your ego,</p>
<p>which to grow intellectually and physically.</p>
<p>So people are curious about it.</p>
<p>So the natural question is if they&rsquo;re curious about it,</p>
<p>how would you recommend they get started?</p>
<p>Maybe like, what do you recommend the first day,</p>
<p>week, month, year, first couple of years look like?</p>
<p>Like, how do you ease into it</p>
<p>and make sure that it&rsquo;s a positive experience</p>
<p>and you progress in the most optimal and positive way?</p>
<p>The first thing you can do is simply ask yourself why,</p>
<p>why you want to be involved.</p>
<p>You know, I remember the first day that I walked into</p>
<p>Ronin Athletics in New York City</p>
<p>to train under Godfather of my son now,</p>
<p>Christian Montes, and I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what I was getting myself into.</p>
<p>I played baseball through high school</p>
<p>and I wanted, I was at Manhattan College in the Bronx</p>
<p>and I wanted to go and learn martial arts</p>
<p>because it was always something that was interesting to me,</p>
<p>but it was never something that I knew was accessible</p>
<p>and it definitely wasn&rsquo;t really around</p>
<p>in Northern Virginia where I grew up,</p>
<p>whereas then you stick yourself in Manhattan</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s stuff everywhere.</p>
<p>So anyway, I guess I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know if I was going to get beat up,</p>
<p>if people were going to be nice,</p>
<p>if people were not going to be nice,</p>
<p>but what I began with was, I think, expectation management.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s something that I would,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be the first thing that I would start</p>
<p>is almost imagining what is it that I&rsquo;m getting myself into</p>
<p>because I love the martial arts.</p>
<p>The martial arts has given me everything in life</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so thankful I wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here</p>
<p>without that experience, that journey.</p>
<p>The people that I&rsquo;ve met, the places that I&rsquo;ve gone,</p>
<p>I could never, ever have ever imagined.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just unbelievably thankful for that.</p>
<p>But I think that the thing that helped me most of all</p>
<p>was starting with going,</p>
<p>my mom said something to me one time and she said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two types of people in various situations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s why and there&rsquo;s why not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s understandable to have questions, concerns,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>But maybe sometimes it&rsquo;s a little bit easier</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re younger to just trust people</p>
<p>or just say, I don&rsquo;t know, you know.</p>
<p>But we go, hey, you wanna climb that rock?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, why not?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Hey, you wanna jump in that river?</p>
<p>Yeah, why not?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Versus if I have to reason my way into everything,</p>
<p>if I have to be talked into everything,</p>
<p>a lot of times I&rsquo;ll talk myself out of it.</p>
<p>And I think that a lot of times</p>
<p>this is the thinker&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>You wanna figure out what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>and what you should expect to have happen</p>
<p>before you get involved versus going,</p>
<p>using the old Bruce Lee saying again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like no amount of thinking or training</p>
<p>on the side of the river will teach you how to swim.</p>
<p>You have to jump in.</p>
<p>And there are risks associated with that.</p>
<p>And I guess psychological are usually the biggest ones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest hurdle.</p>
<p>And physical.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing that I guess I would suggest</p>
<p>to anyone to say, well, why do you wanna do this?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, well, I wanna challenge myself.</p>
<p>I wanna learn, I would like to learn to fight.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn to fight so that I could protect myself.</p>
<p>And if anything else, other people,</p>
<p>if only within arms reach.</p>
<p>I perceived that if I had some small degree of power,</p>
<p>I generally wouldn&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>Which is why I was like, yeah, I&rsquo;ll give it a try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to be reasonable.</p>
<p>And hopefully if I make a mistake,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll apologize to people.</p>
<p>But basically I said, yeah, I&rsquo;d like to have that.</p>
<p>And I wanna, I know this is gonna be challenging</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>And that means that getting beat up</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t get like hurt, but getting roughed up,</p>
<p>getting my arm bent this way or that way, getting choked.</p>
<p>I was like, well, this is all supposed to happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
<p>It would be like going and joining the army</p>
<p>during peacetime and then going,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m just doing this for college education.</p>
<p>You know, like, okay, that&rsquo;s cool, man.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden war breaks out</p>
<p>and they wanna send me somewhere.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sign up for that.</p>
<p>Actually you did, whether you realize it or not.</p>
<p>You may not have thought that you did, but you did.</p>
<p>So getting your mind right and just going,</p>
<p>what are my expectations for this activity?</p>
<p>What is it that I&rsquo;m looking to do?</p>
<p>And of course, you know, you&rsquo;re going into a gym,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going into a place that you don&rsquo;t know people,</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t know people</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know the coach.</p>
<p>And even if you do wanna, hey, how you doing?</p>
<p>Shake your hand, type of level.</p>
<p>You know, 95% of my students don&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p>Not really, you know, I&rsquo;ll try to be polite</p>
<p>and not annoy them too much,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t know me and I don&rsquo;t know them.</p>
<p>I understand if they don&rsquo;t trust me,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t trust, trust me either if I were them.</p>
<p>But at the same time, someone has to take that leap.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I&rsquo;ve noticed</p>
<p>as a martial arts instructor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biggest struggle with dealing with adults,</p>
<p>which is why a lot of people like to teach kids</p>
<p>is because kids don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t argue.</p>
<p>Now that also means there&rsquo;s all sorts of pitfalls</p>
<p>or that sort of thing, and that can be an issue.</p>
<p>But you know, I guess a lot of times people get to a point</p>
<p>in their life, you know, in their 20s, early 30s,</p>
<p>where now I&rsquo;m a manager now, I know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>No one talks to me like that.</p>
<p>First it&rsquo;s like, hey man, you go join bootcamp,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you are Elon Musk,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna tell you to shut up and do pushups.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s great about it.</p>
<p>So you are taking a leap of faith into a world</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna be a tiny fish.</p>
<p>And you gotta hope that the people who are guiding you</p>
<p>in that journey are gonna have,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even say your best interests at heart</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t even know you,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll try to do no harm.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll try to help you</p>
<p>in the way that they would understand.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s, for instance,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would try to do with anyone</p>
<p>that comes into my gym.</p>
<p>I would try to help them in the way</p>
<p>that I understand they need as best I can</p>
<p>and as safe and reasonable a way as possible,</p>
<p>but sometimes in a way that&rsquo;s gonna make them uncomfortable,</p>
<p>particularly if physical combat,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not something they&rsquo;ve done before.</p>
<p>If a lot of people go in without even having played,</p>
<p>you know, contact sports, and so that can be a big jump.</p>
<p>And you have to understand,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re starting from, no worries,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have to kind of work your way to it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be uncomfortable, and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the process,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have some bumps and bruises,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not gonna wanna roll with that guy in the corner</p>
<p>because that person&rsquo;s rough, and they beat you up,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, okay, but is this a big hurt</p>
<p>or is it a little hurt?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a big hurt, okay.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a little hurt,</p>
<p>need you to center up a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting balance because to find,</p>
<p>I think one of the most important things</p>
<p>as in anything, I think, in life</p>
<p>is the selection of the people that you put around you.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s true with like getting married.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true with like if you go to,</p>
<p>if people ask me, like graduate students,</p>
<p>like your PhD advisor can be the difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you spend five years with somebody,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to basically define more impact on you</p>
<p>than anybody you marry, anybody you hang out with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge impact.</p>
<p>And the same with the coach selection,</p>
<p>which is like the school selection,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s going to be really important about</p>
<p>in terms of like who you select will define how happy,</p>
<p>like the trajectory of your growth</p>
<p>and how happy you are with the entirety of the experience.</p>
<p>And yet, like the flip side of that is,</p>
<p>especially if you have an ego,</p>
<p>especially if you are the manager</p>
<p>that needs to let go of some stuff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel like shit</p>
<p>with the best kind of coach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you need.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a weird balance there to find.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, like, and everybody needs a different thing.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m much more, I enjoy being sort of like,</p>
<p>it sounds weird, but like I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>from the wrestling background,</p>
<p>I enjoy feeling like crap in the sense like the coach,</p>
<p>like getting beat up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually enjoy it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like some masochistic thing or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the growth.</p>
<p>Like I like the anxiety.</p>
<p>I like feeling like shit when I go home,</p>
<p>like emotionally, physically, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign of growth, right?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re not having to feel those things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably in your comfort zone, which is fine,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not your growth zone, right?</p>
<p>And everybody has a different threshold for that.</p>
<p>And I mean, the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also has like a yoga feel to it.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re learning about your body.</p>
<p>So depending on the gym and depending on, in fact,</p>
<p>the coaches or the people around you within the gym,</p>
<p>you can select little groups too, kind of like the people</p>
<p>with who you roll, like if you&rsquo;re a smaller person,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to go against big people.</p>
<p>You can go against the people who like smoke a lot of weed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re chill, or you can go against like that crazy</p>
<p>red blue belt competitor who&rsquo;s like out to destroy everybody.</p>
<p>And depending on like what your mindset is,</p>
<p>you can kind of select that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a fascinating journey of like,</p>
<p>basically self discovery.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, what you need may change over time, right?</p>
<p>Maybe what you needed, what you need today</p>
<p>could change six months from now or a year from now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I experienced.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use my first coach Christian, again,</p>
<p>as a great example of someone who I really look up to</p>
<p>and respect and someone who helped me a lot.</p>
<p>Like at a time when I really needed some guidance</p>
<p>and I needed to learn martial arts, but get into,</p>
<p>Hensel Gracie&rsquo;s gym was right down the street</p>
<p>from where Christian was teaching.</p>
<p>And Christian was a blue belt at the time.</p>
<p>It was, he was teaching at a place called Fight House,</p>
<p>which was this awesome, like, you know, like 90s,</p>
<p>early 2000s, you know, warehouse area down</p>
<p>on Fashion Avenue in Manhattan,</p>
<p>off of like between 7th and 8th.</p>
<p>And it was like two basketball courts wide,</p>
<p>but like there was the Sambo guys over here.</p>
<p>There was the Kali guys over there.</p>
<p>There was a Wing Chun over there.</p>
<p>There was Jiu Jitsu in the corner.</p>
<p>And Hensel&rsquo;s was one of the most famous academies</p>
<p>in the world at that time, still is.</p>
<p>And I just didn&rsquo;t know what Hensel Gracie was.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s a great gym</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fantastic place for people to train.</p>
<p>But I think what was right for me at the time was to,</p>
<p>I stumbled into, you know, like a two person elevator up</p>
<p>and found a place where six people trained at that time.</p>
<p>And I had someone that could give me some,</p>
<p>like in addition to martial arts advice,</p>
<p>like personal guidance.</p>
<p>And that made a big difference.</p>
<p>And then when initially we would have like competitions</p>
<p>or like intra, you know, gym competitions</p>
<p>with the Sambo guys, we would compete,</p>
<p>we would roll with them.</p>
<p>And like, again, it was great</p>
<p>because they were just a bunch of like Russian dudes</p>
<p>from like Brighton Beach.</p>
<p>And they would come down and then we would all fight.</p>
<p>And then everyone would train</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d all drink tea and then go home.</p>
<p>And anyway, what was, it was super tough.</p>
<p>And they were like, again, just a tough group of people.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>And then I remember when I decided</p>
<p>after like four or five months,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, man, I really want to try to take this seriously.</p>
<p>And I told Christian about that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, hey,</p>
<p>I think you need to do the following.</p>
<p>And it was, you know, like, hey, here&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there was a guy named Jeff Ruth,</p>
<p>who was a purple belt at the time,</p>
<p>which was a much bigger deal than it is now,</p>
<p>but it was 10 and always an MMA fighter,</p>
<p>a lot of amateur box spirit, super tough dude.</p>
<p>And Jeff was the best person at that time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d ever trained with.</p>
<p>And I just got squashed.</p>
<p>Christian used to beat me up too,</p>
<p>but like Jeff would just absolutely kick the crap out of me.</p>
<p>And I was like, this is awesome.</p>
<p>And this was back when I was at home.</p>
<p>I went home for the summer for that.</p>
<p>And Chris is like, hey, I think you should stay because I told him that&rsquo;s what I was thinking.</p>
<p>And this was a coach that, you know, when it&rsquo;s like when initially was exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, well, hey, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m doing here.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re going to be able to help you onto a path that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of commensurate with what your goals are at the moment.</p>
<p>And then, you know, that was an, that was an interesting thing.</p>
<p>And I really got, I feel that I was fortunate to start at a place where my coach was able to transition roles</p>
<p>and, and, and do so comfortably.</p>
<p>And I think that that also was probably a factor of the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;d done some of his training prior, like there&rsquo;ve been issues with, with the coach there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like not supporting, not having the support, you know, feeling like, hey,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m going to hold onto my students.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hold onto my best guy or my best girl, even if I can&rsquo;t take them where they need to go.</p>
<p>So that was an interesting thing.</p>
<p>And just recognizing also though, that the people like the same way you&rsquo;re an individual going into a gym</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re getting into your coach is a person too.</p>
<p>And he or she, you know, they may have been doing this activity longer than you, but they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not some weird little, you know, all knowing God.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>They may say something that pisses you off.</p>
<p>They may, they may yell at you.</p>
<p>They may help you.</p>
<p>They may inadvertently cause you some sort of, you know, some sort of issue.</p>
<p>And just being able to recognize that even though I say this to people and I&rsquo;ve said this to people in my gym,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know, we&rsquo;re in the service industry, man, but I&rsquo;m not at your service.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t get it twisted.</p>
<p>Like I will absolutely do my best to help people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there to do my best as a martial arts coach, but I&rsquo;m here to do my best as a martial arts coach.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do my best and periodically I make mistakes and I own apology or two,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll try to give them out when I can.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, oh, you gave me a hundred bucks, so you do whatever you want in here.</p>
<p>This is my house.</p>
<p>This is my gym.</p>
<p>This is my dojo.</p>
<p>This is, this is a martial arts.</p>
<p>This is not a basketball team.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something beautiful about martial arts.</p>
<p>Like exactly as you said is the coach, like in wrestling and at least collegiate,</p>
<p>like high level wrestling is like, there&rsquo;s a dictatorship aspect to a coach that is very important to have.</p>
<p>Like this, this ridiculous sometimes nature of like master and so on and bowing, all these traditions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, it seems ridiculous from the outside perhaps,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something really powerful to that because that process of you said, why not,</p>
<p>of letting go of the leap of faith requires you to believe that the coach has your best interest in mind</p>
<p>and just give yourself over to their ideas of how, how you should grow.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never been able to really see coaches I&rsquo;ve had as human.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always, you always, it&rsquo;s like a father figure or like this,</p>
<p>you always put them in this position of power.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, I think at least for me, it&rsquo;s been a very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a very useful way to see the coach because it allows you to not think and let go</p>
<p>and really allow yourself to grow and emotionally deal with all the beatings.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ll push you where past oftentimes where you would have stopped yourself, right?</p>
<p>Which is great.</p>
<p>And then hopefully they know they, if they&rsquo;re paying attention and they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still a person, they can make mistakes,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll push you further than you would have gone, but not so far that it&rsquo;s not facilitative.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that I can say, like Faraz Zahabi, the head coach at TriStar,</p>
<p>my head coach for MMA, Kenny Florian, one of the head coaches for MMA,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve both been phenomenal influences.</p>
<p>Paul Shriner, who&rsquo;s the one of the assistants at Marcelo Garcia&rsquo;s Academy,</p>
<p>coached me in Jiu Jitsu for a long time, brilliant instructor.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all been able to do that.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s interesting about all of those guys is they&rsquo;re very sharp,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re very intuitive as well.</p>
<p>And I think that Faraz actually, you know, told me about some of the John Wooden said,</p>
<p>John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, just a simple philosophical idea.</p>
<p>Just, he said, some people&rsquo;s life is a bowl of shit.</p>
<p>It needs some whipped cream in it.</p>
<p>Some people&rsquo;s life is a bowl of whipped cream.</p>
<p>Needs a little bit of shit in it just to balance it out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Coaching everyone the same way doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s, I think the difference between a coach and an instructor.</p>
<p>And a lot of times people think they want to coach, but they really want an instructor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hey Lex, tell me what to do, not how to do it.</p>
<p>And then other times people think they want, you know, an instructor and they really want a coach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, man, this guy&rsquo;s just giving me information.</p>
<p>A coach is so much more than an instructor.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a huge leap.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I think that people need to understand when they&rsquo;re going into</p>
<p>martial arts.</p>
<p>And I understand, and I can totally grasp why they don&rsquo;t, because how would they know?</p>
<p>But I think about this a lot, like me giving you $150 for a month, which is not nothing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>That does not, that pays for instructor really.</p>
<p>Coach is a relationship that gets developed because can you imagine like just the amount</p>
<p>of emotional investment and time thinking away from like, oh, Lex isn&rsquo;t here anymore.</p>
<p>What can I do to help him?</p>
<p>What does he need?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s serious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the difference between, that&rsquo;s oftentimes the difference that getting over</p>
<p>the hump in various situations.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting, you know, bargain that&rsquo;s being made like commitment by the instructor</p>
<p>who becomes a coach, commitment by the student.</p>
<p>You know, like there&rsquo;s a financial transaction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things going on there, but I feel very fortunate to have had not just</p>
<p>instructors in my time, but coaches.</p>
<p>And that means sometimes we butted heads and sometimes I look back and I think I was right.</p>
<p>And other times I look back on my own, no, they were definitely right.</p>
<p>But there was always the trust with the exception of one time that I feel that trust was greatly</p>
<p>betrayed that rightly or wrongly, whether mistakes, mistakes will be made, but everyone</p>
<p>is attempting to do the right thing under no circumstances.</p>
<p>Is what I intentionally do anything malicious, you know, versus, Hey, I might&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>I might&rsquo;ve burnt your house down, but you can be darn sure it wasn&rsquo;t on purpose.</p>
<p>And I think that as long as there&rsquo;s that mutual understanding and mutual belief of goodwill,</p>
<p>which again, doesn&rsquo;t just magic up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s when then great things can happen.</p>
<p>And I look at all the athletes that I know, you know, the guys and girls that I&rsquo;ve watched</p>
<p>become fantastic in various places, almost invariably.</p>
<p>It never happened alone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really torn about that.</p>
<p>Like, maybe you can help.</p>
<p>Have you seen the movie Whiplash?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I would say from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective, people should watch it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I guess, jazz band.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a movie about a drummer and the instructor.</p>
<p>And he, it&rsquo;s a basically, I would say from the outsider&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s a toxic</p>
<p>relationship, but he&rsquo;s really the coach, whatever we call him, pushes the musician, the drummer</p>
<p>or to his limits, like to where he just feels like shit emotionally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it looks like a toxic relationship, but it&rsquo;s one that ultimately is very productive</p>
<p>for the improvement of the musician.</p>
<p>I have the same, like in my own experience, I had, I got a chance to train at a couple</p>
<p>of places regularly.</p>
<p>And so one of my coaches who is a great human being, a lot of people love him.</p>
<p>But when I was a blue belt, he was pushing me a lot for competition.</p>
<p>And every time I step on the mat, I was anxious and almost afraid of training because of like</p>
<p>the places I&rsquo;m going to have to go.</p>
<p>And then the, I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good or bad because I think I&rsquo;ve become a</p>
<p>better person because of that experience.</p>
<p>Like I needed that.</p>
<p>And on the flip side, like the place I got my black belt from, it&rsquo;s Balanced Studios.</p>
<p>I remember also blue belt, the coach sitting down and I was going to competition and he</p>
<p>saw something in me where he said, you know, like, good luck, but win or lose, we always</p>
<p>love you.</p>
<p>Like, I, I really, I remember that because I really needed that at that time.</p>
<p>Like I was putting so much pressure on myself.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not an actual professional competitor, you know, I just competed.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a PhD student, like, but like it was clearly having a psychological effect</p>
<p>on me and that&rsquo;s what a great coach does is like, you know, it&rsquo;s like life is more</p>
<p>important than Jiu Jitsu since it&rsquo;s bigger.</p>
<p>So they find, you use Jiu Jitsu when you need it to grow as a person and when it</p>
<p>overwhelms you, you have to pull that person out, like look at the bigger picture, always</p>
<p>look at the bigger picture and it&rsquo;s fascinating and I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would have it any other way is both the anxiety and the, and the love</p>
<p>and the love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that I couldn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s a really interesting thing that you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>that I guess it kind of brings me back to a lot of the other things we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>discussing is just almost like the, the reciprocal nature of everything where no</p>
<p>pressure, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s happy all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either, I mean, let&rsquo;s, uh, use the example of sci fi movies to see the matrix,</p>
<p>which of course the first one was amazing and then each subsequent movie made the</p>
<p>series worse.</p>
<p>But, um, but basically, yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard, we&rsquo;ll see, I was hoping for the best, but,</p>
<p>um, but basically, uh, you know, let&rsquo;s say, Hey, which we started with our first</p>
<p>initial world agent Smith says to Neo is like our first world was a utopia where</p>
<p>everyone was happy and nothing ever went wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your primitive cerebrum rejected it.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s obviously, I mean, what do I think, but I guess, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here, so I might as well say what I think.</p>
<p>Um, I guess, uh, you know, great things are fantastic.</p>
<p>A kind, gentle place is fantastic.</p>
<p>And this is again, why I love dune is I think dune does such a great job of, of</p>
<p>expressing Frank Herbert does such a great job of expressing again, the</p>
<p>reciprocal nature of these ideas.</p>
<p>You know, look at, uh, look at Sparta for instance, or at least what I understand</p>
<p>of Sparta from the reading and also watching 300.</p>
<p>Um, uh, you know, and reading the Wikipedia and reading the Wikipedia</p>
<p>article about the movie, not the place.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, it&rsquo;s, um, that&rsquo;s a hard, brutal place.</p>
<p>And that was their benefit to that.</p>
<p>Like, absolutely.</p>
<p>Was there drawback to that?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is it sustainable?</p>
<p>I should probably think probably not.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, granted it hasn&rsquo;t sustained, but I mean, that type of a, of a thing,</p>
<p>it, it burns too hot almost.</p>
<p>And it, uh, it, it destroys the host at a certain point.</p>
<p>And, you know, I guess that, that type of unforgiving nature, but in</p>
<p>entirely, entirely permissive has its own issues.</p>
<p>And I guess coming back into your, what your description of like describing a</p>
<p>toxic relationship is a very dangerous and tricky thing because it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like, uh, it&rsquo;s like bird&rsquo;s eye view.</p>
<p>Me, you know, you see, let&rsquo;s say a husband and a wife arguing, you know,</p>
<p>like, all right, well, sort of somebody hitting somebody.</p>
<p>I need to keep myself out of this because I have no idea what I&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>something, but I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on or why specifically.</p>
<p>And again, short of it going to a place that, that just out of bounds,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s right here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what phase of this things are in.</p>
<p>So I guess long term was good for both people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dangerous for it.</p>
<p>So if I want to put my finger on the scale, I can understand the desire to do</p>
<p>them like, Hey guys, let&rsquo;s break it up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But, and that may be the right thing at the time, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure.</p>
<p>So I think back to all of the times that.</p>
<p>You know, that like you mentioned, your coach pushing you when very, very hard.</p>
<p>And then other times going like, Hey, let&rsquo;s put it in perspective here.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an interesting thing for high performance.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re seeing that again, societally, you know, now, or at least</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s just pops up on my internet feed periodically but coaches shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be allowed to do this or yell at this person to yell at that person.</p>
<p>Like, well, have you ever been go to a boxing gym?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a commercial entity.</p>
<p>Not really a real box, not LA boxing, not a USC gym, like a real place.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to see what things are like when it&rsquo;s entirely performance based.</p>
<p>Go to wrestling room at a high level.</p>
<p>You know, again, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s left and right limits and there are such</p>
<p>things obviously as abuse, of course, but, and that should never be tolerated.</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s not a commercial entity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to be sweet to you if you&rsquo;re, if you&rsquo;re screwing up, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dropping the ball and in fact, recognizing that I&rsquo;m not doing you a favor or the</p>
<p>favor or the team a favor by, by being permissive of that type of behavior.</p>
<p>I think is important.</p>
<p>Everything in its context and at its time is important.</p>
<p>And I guess I can think again at the times that I&rsquo;ve been put, put, or had</p>
<p>put on me, like a great deal of pressure to do X, Y, or Z or to succeed, um, or</p>
<p>to push for success.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t look back fondly enough on those times.</p>
<p>They were tough at the time, but without that, I&rsquo;m not sitting here without that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go from growing up in a, in a very nice family in the suburbs to fighting at</p>
<p>the highest level in jujitsu, gi, no gi, and now in mixed martial arts, starting a</p>
<p>career at age 27.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t, it just doesn&rsquo;t happen because people generally speaking from</p>
<p>that background, don&rsquo;t get pushed hard enough physically to be able to make that</p>
<p>transition.</p>
<p>And that has benefits and it has drawbacks.</p>
<p>You know, when you stare into the abyss, it stares back.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s an important thing to understand.</p>
<p>You know, you stare long enough, you, you can become something that you don&rsquo;t, that</p>
<p>you would be sorry that you did.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t look enough and you don&rsquo;t have perspective either.</p>
<p>You know, and I, I think that that&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>I can speak to someone who&rsquo;s relative to being someone who&rsquo;s relatively articulate</p>
<p>and reasonable.</p>
<p>I try to be reasonable, but you know, I&rsquo;ll say in sparring, if people get crazy with</p>
<p>me, they get a warning and then I&rsquo;m a crack them.</p>
<p>And what did they expect?</p>
<p>Oh, they hear the guy on a, on an interview, but who did they think they were meeting?</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s also the guy in the ring and there&rsquo;s layers there too.</p>
<p>I remember training with you.</p>
<p>It was kind of funny.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s, well, you didn&rsquo;t know who I was.</p>
<p>I mean, you still like, I have a really good straight ankle up by the way.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t remember what rank I was, but it might&rsquo;ve been purple or something like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And I did some, like I, you had this look on your face, which I&rsquo;ve often seen in</p>
<p>black belts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here he goes again, like here, here&rsquo;s him trying this thing.</p>
<p>And then when I kind of annoyed you a little bit with it, now I get that it was a good</p>
<p>at like, I, you know, I did something somewhat effective, like some, like maybe a little</p>
<p>bit off balance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, I just peeled off a little layer of Ryan Hall to where I was like, okay, let</p>
<p>me, let me like, there, there&rsquo;s like layers underneath Mike Tyson somewhere in there.</p>
<p>Like, so it was like, okay, this like new guy rolls in here.</p>
<p>He thinks he can do the stupid thing.</p>
<p>And then, and then you started to beat the hell out of me.</p>
<p>But the, the, the point is there&rsquo;s layers here from the guy who was being interviewed</p>
<p>now to like Genghis Khan, but it&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s all in the same body.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, all of us are like that, right.</p>
<p>In various different directions and recognizing that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, there are consequences to all every choice that we make as a consequence.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s like objectively wrong or objectively right.</p>
<p>But at least in my mind, that&rsquo;s a pretty small box.</p>
<p>Everything else is just, there&rsquo;s a consequence to that.</p>
<p>Do you like that consequence?</p>
<p>Do you not?</p>
<p>And who do I want to become?</p>
<p>What do I want to try to hone myself or anyone else into?</p>
<p>And also like, but this is something I&rsquo;ve screwed up as a coach plenty of times.</p>
<p>You know, like if someone says, if you&rsquo;re, if like, I come to them like Lex, I really,</p>
<p>really want to take, you know, research very seriously.</p>
<p>Like, okay, I believe you.</p>
<p>Now I haven&rsquo;t shown you that, but I believe you like, okay.</p>
<p>And now me not showing up to research or to study or not being up until three in the morning</p>
<p>thinking about this is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>There was a time like five seconds before me making that statement that if I went to</p>
<p>bed without reading the book that I needed to read, no worries.</p>
<p>But the second that I made that statement, your expectations for me changed.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve screwed up a whole bunch of times in my, as a teacher.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s an interesting thing, obviously, you know, being a, like running a martial</p>
<p>arts school is as you&rsquo;re principally an athlete is sometimes I don&rsquo;t pay enough attention</p>
<p>to what people are doing.</p>
<p>I just go, oh, okay.</p>
<p>You say X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Roger that.</p>
<p>I believe you.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I will now put you in category X and whether rightly or wrongly, like maybe this person</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t understand what they were asking for, or I didn&rsquo;t express this or the other.</p>
<p>And it just, it caused cross wires.</p>
<p>And then most times you just, you hash it out.</p>
<p>You have a discussion, you figure out, get to the bottom of what people are trying to</p>
<p>do or what they want.</p>
<p>But if I was paying more attention, I think I could have been a lot more effective.</p>
<p>Or if I had more experience and sometimes maybe I&rsquo;m not sharp enough or I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not perceptive enough to be able to, to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And maybe with years more down the line, I&rsquo;ll be able to have a sharper perception.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s another one of those interesting things that some, that sometimes I would caution</p>
<p>or not caution, but just inform a prospective martial arts student, depending upon where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going you know, this you, both you and also your coach or other people in the</p>
<p>room, they wear many hats.</p>
<p>And sometimes there&rsquo;s a, I had the wrong hat on.</p>
<p>You were talking to me as Lex the guy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize you were talking to me.</p>
<p>I thought you were talking to me as Lex the guy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re talking to me as Lex the martial artist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Oh crap.</p>
<p>I was talking to the wrong person.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like if you had a, like I run my gym with my wife, she&rsquo;s a black belt.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s my wife.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s my peers as a martial artist, uh, in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s here by the way, in judging.</p>
<p>So exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, all right.</p>
<p>So, but, but a fellow black belt.</p>
<p>And I guess like another thing, she doesn&rsquo;t have a microphone, so you can&rsquo;t hear all the</p>
<p>trash she&rsquo;s talking.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But it can be tough.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve had to work through a lot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like looking back and it&rsquo;s like now being where I&rsquo;m at now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy for me to say that cause she&rsquo;s in the room and I don&rsquo;t want her to stab me,</p>
<p>just continue to slowly poison me over time, which frankly I understand.</p>
<p>Um, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that is now way more effective than anything</p>
<p>else I could really reasonably expect to have.</p>
<p>Um, but there were times when, when both of us, you know, were justifiably annoyed at</p>
<p>the other because of crossed wires.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you know, you&rsquo;ll just have to scream in any way or misunderstanding anyway.</p>
<p>But again, like I&rsquo;ve, I coached some of my friends, I&rsquo;ve coached, I&rsquo;ve coached my friend</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ve known since I was four years old.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I don&rsquo;t go, Hey buddy, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s like, what the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p>Put your hand over there.</p>
<p>How many times we talked about this?</p>
<p>And then you walk away and you can see him look at you crooked and you&rsquo;re like, Oh crap.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>He thought I was talking to his friend.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, all right, let, we need to talk this one out, hashing out and not he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>How could he possibly think that way?</p>
<p>Like, Oh no, I totally understand that.</p>
<p>But if I was 22, like doesn&rsquo;t need no, I&rsquo;m a purple belt, some nonsense like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, and it doesn&rsquo;t come from a bad place, but it&rsquo;s just, I guess that comes back to</p>
<p>society to anything.</p>
<p>People only had the perspective that they have and the awareness that we have.</p>
<p>And so again, going back and going, Hey guys, grace, like I don&rsquo;t expect, it&rsquo;s not fair</p>
<p>for me to go, I fight UFC.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t this guy who came in as an attorney understand how hardcore this needs to be?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how could he?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And at the same time though, if, if I&rsquo;m using the language of someone that is interested</p>
<p>in at least performance from a martial arts perspective, I understand how that could be</p>
<p>off putting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say for instance, someone that&rsquo;s like all of that would be out of bounds in their</p>
<p>normal workplace.</p>
<p>But if they think of the gym as my office, then whether they agree or disagree with what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on, they go, okay, I hear why I see why that might happen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>And we can, again, all push forward in a positive direction that benefits, I guess, everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>journey throughout the activity.</p>
<p>And on top of all that, there&rsquo;s moods.</p>
<p>Like I, I mean, especially lately, I think two days ago, maybe yesterday, no, two days</p>
<p>ago, I&rsquo;ve never been that cranky in my life.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but I wanted to tell everybody how much they annoyed me.</p>
<p>It was like, I was just very conscious of this feeling of like, why, why is this happening</p>
<p>right now?</p>
<p>So I consciously decided as I usually do in those cases to not say anything to anybody.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Well, I, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s yeah.</p>
<p>Meditate because it&rsquo;s not, I tend to, I tend to then visualize what&rsquo;s going to happen in</p>
<p>the next, like, how is this going to make my life better?</p>
<p>Like if I say something that mean to somebody else, I have just started a conflict that</p>
<p>will just escalate, will continue, will add more conflict to my life.</p>
<p>It will make things, I just don&rsquo;t like the feeling you will create.</p>
<p>And so you live in enough life to know that like, it&rsquo;s just like with like street fighting.</p>
<p>I would get into a lot of fights when I was younger, just on the street, but then you</p>
<p>realize like, it&rsquo;s not like a jujitsu match or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;ll escalate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll, it might come back at you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll like that person might find you again.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the anxiety of it, of having created little enemies in this</p>
<p>world, distorts the way you see the world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve noticed that like, if I am shitty to people on the internet, which I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been, I think in a long time is like, it, it somehow brings the shittiness to you</p>
<p>more and more, it escalates like the more love you put out there, the more like the</p>
<p>people who put love out, like surround you.</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned forgiveness as well.</p>
<p>Like you said, like, I guess back to the original, you know, the Holocaust survivor</p>
<p>scenario where you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, like you think of the ultimate in, in like, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never experienced one, one billionth of that level of, of pain and horror.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, and I can&rsquo;t let this little thing go.</p>
<p>You know, I guess that&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re just making the point in your personal life, I guess the same way.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And on the internet, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve somehow gotten, I mean, you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve had a level of celebrity for a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently gotten some level of like celebrity and like these people who are</p>
<p>just shitty for no reason come out from all, from all places, like calling me a</p>
<p>fraud or anything else.</p>
<p>It was Jay and Silent Bob, Strike Back.</p>
<p>They find out a movie is going to be made about them and people were talking shit</p>
<p>on the internet and they&rsquo;re like, what&rsquo;s the internet?</p>
<p>And then someone shows them and they&rsquo;re like, what?</p>
<p>And they go to a message board and they go to Hollywood to try to stop it from</p>
<p>being made.</p>
<p>And they eventually get money for their likeness and they use the money to buy</p>
<p>plane tickets and fly around and beat the shit out of all the people that talk bad</p>
<p>about them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m having trouble with it cause there&rsquo;s people like, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s posts and forums and like heated discussions about</p>
<p>is like sweeping a fraud.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What has he really done?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like, and then there&rsquo;s people like, well, I think he&rsquo;s an all right</p>
<p>guy, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Like, like there&rsquo;s like literal discussions and I&rsquo;m like, like nobody,</p>
<p>like if you increase the level of celebrity, there&rsquo;s going to be like one</p>
<p>of the things that hurts my heart a little bit is like some level of toxicity</p>
<p>around Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>For example, there&rsquo;s like communities of people that now like talk about him</p>
<p>selling out, for example, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, you know, and Joe I&rsquo;ve talked to him about it is amazing that</p>
<p>he he says, don&rsquo;t read the comments.</p>
<p>He legitimately doesn&rsquo;t read the comments.</p>
<p>His heart and his soul doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about the comments.</p>
<p>All he gives a damn about is his friends.</p>
<p>Like one of the things that&rsquo;s really inspiring to me and that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>conversation with them offline about Spotify and the removed episodes.</p>
<p>People are curious.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Spotify?</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s, uh, it&rsquo;s a thing on the internet where, uh, I think you can play</p>
<p>Taylor Swift songs on, um, but you can also now play Joe Rogan podcasts and</p>
<p>they gave him a hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>So that that&rsquo;s, um, you know, that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, but the thing I&rsquo;ve had a discussion with him and I made a video about it</p>
<p>that I took down because of the toxicity is like, it&rsquo;s hard to put into words,</p>
<p>but he will give away the a hundred million in a second.</p>
<p>If he ever has to compromise who he is, like he doesn&rsquo;t, I mean, he already</p>
<p>said, as he talked about, he&rsquo;s made quote unquote, fuck you money a long</p>
<p>time ago, he doesn&rsquo;t need any more money.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to have money, whatever, but like, he&rsquo;ll give it away.</p>
<p>So the it&rsquo;s nice to see when people like him at a level of celebrity level of</p>
<p>success and financial success, don&rsquo;t change at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just the same thing that makes you happy is talking in his case, talking</p>
<p>shit with his friends in the case of most of us really just, just hanging out</p>
<p>with friends, doing the things you love in his case, doing the things he loves</p>
<p>without any, like, you know, the Texas way, the freedom, like without any</p>
<p>corporate bureaucracy bullshit that rolls in and says, well, maybe you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t say fuck, you know, like more than 20 times a podcast or something</p>
<p>like that, like those kinds of like rules, like people, like he says in a</p>
<p>suit and tie, they show up and say stuff oddly enough people that could never</p>
<p>have done what he does.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of inspiring to see that.</p>
<p>And I hope people, I hope people realize how special of a human he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s inspired like people like me, like I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m a scientist, right?</p>
<p>So he inspired somebody like me from a very different walk of life to be like</p>
<p>kind to others, to be open minded.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s a special dude.</p>
<p>So like people need to support that and treasure that as opposed to</p>
<p>as opposed to be toxic about it.</p>
<p>I mean, what people really for a long time have told me that it would be</p>
<p>awesome if Ryan Hall goes on Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I definitely think that would be an awesome thing.</p>
<p>Have you listened to Joe?</p>
<p>Has he been a part of your life in some kind of way?</p>
<p>You know, well, Joe&rsquo;s always, I remember watching Joe on Fear Factor when I</p>
<p>was a little kid, which is cool.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve actually gotten to like, from a bird&rsquo;s eye view, watch his kind of</p>
<p>just path through life.</p>
<p>But one of the things that I always appreciate, and again, I barely know Joe</p>
<p>other than to shake his hand.</p>
<p>He interviewed me after the, briefly in the ring after the BJ pan fight.</p>
<p>But one of the things that I&rsquo;ve always admired about Joe is that I think he</p>
<p>had fucking money from the start.</p>
<p>I think that zero dollars is fucking money for Joe.</p>
<p>I think, and that&rsquo;s something I respect about him a great deal because as you</p>
<p>say, it&rsquo;s interesting to watch, it&rsquo;s like you hope that George St. Pierre is</p>
<p>like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, I&rsquo;m not super close to George, but we&rsquo;re teammates at TriStar</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s never been anything but a gentleman.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of those people that if you didn&rsquo;t know George was famous when you</p>
<p>walk into the gym, you&rsquo;d have no idea.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not holding court, not doing it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, you know, training and he&rsquo;ll help out an amateur doing this.</p>
<p>If you have a question for him, he&rsquo;ll help me.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m nobody, man.</p>
<p>He would give me advice and train me.</p>
<p>It was super cool.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t kill me, which I really appreciated.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a gentleman.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s like you meet someone and you go, man, it&rsquo;s so cool that</p>
<p>this is the guy who&rsquo;s the best, that this is the guy who has been successful.</p>
<p>And then you go, why are they successful?</p>
<p>Like I said, true to what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same as they&rsquo;ve been.</p>
<p>And I remember I got to TriStar in 2012 and George was already George St.</p>
<p>Pierre, but I remember watching and talking to people and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh man, George is the same as he&rsquo;s always been.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s neat.</p>
<p>I see him in the gym training now and again, giving advice now.</p>
<p>And it seems like Joe has always been consistent.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s neat to watch someone not compromise on their values and not change</p>
<p>who they are.</p>
<p>And not, you know, periodically, like, you know, again, we all make mistakes.</p>
<p>Like you have a bad day or this or that.</p>
<p>And an apology needs to be issued or even my bad or this or that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, yeah, and they just move on that they&rsquo;re not afraid to be</p>
<p>themselves and they&rsquo;re not afraid to be wrong.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not afraid to make a mistake.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, open mind and some like, so what are the correct beliefs to</p>
<p>have about this that I know going in, everyone&rsquo;s going to be okay with what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, which is usually the beginning of a conversation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to go nowhere.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, uh, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s neat to see, um, the things I guess that he&rsquo;s created on</p>
<p>his own as a result of the authenticity that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it reminds me of like Dave Chappelle.</p>
<p>And, and again, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve never met Dave, but it&rsquo;s neat to see</p>
<p>someone that&rsquo;s clearly again, authentic in their own way, doing their own</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re because of that, they&rsquo;re above the corporate nonsense.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s funny, I think the message behind all of it is, Hey guys, we</p>
<p>all are, I can&rsquo;t promise you that I&rsquo;m going to have money.</p>
<p>Joe couldn&rsquo;t promise you that he&rsquo;s going to have money.</p>
<p>Now it ended up working out, but he was above that nonsense from the jump.</p>
<p>And he just continued to be above it by never giving it any mind and just</p>
<p>going like, yeah, I&rsquo;m going to be a reasonable person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to learn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to grow.</p>
<p>And, uh, if I say something annoying, you can come and talk to me about it.</p>
<p>We can get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, if I need to say my bad, thanks, appreciate it.</p>
<p>You know, I will.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t need to, I&rsquo;m like, Hey, I still appreciate the talk.</p>
<p>Thanks man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll shake your hand and we&rsquo;d carry on and we&rsquo;d go our separate ways and</p>
<p>hopefully I&rsquo;ll treat you with respect.</p>
<p>You treat me with respect and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>And I guess I think it&rsquo;s a lesson that it can work out no matter what you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to count out to like these weird powers that be.</p>
<p>And whether you&rsquo;re at this level or at this level, but you can live your</p>
<p>life the way that you want.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned, talk to your friends, hang out, be happy.</p>
<p>And it just so happens that that resonates with people.</p>
<p>It actually reminds me of like, uh, speaking to MIT and being in Boston is</p>
<p>like a good will hunting.</p>
<p>You know, like, again, that&rsquo;s what did he really want to do?</p>
<p>He could have gone this way.</p>
<p>Could have gone that way.</p>
<p>And it was an interesting story, but it&rsquo;s like this person wants to hang out</p>
<p>with his buddies and wants to do other things.</p>
<p>And again, it happens to be brilliant and happens to be able to do all these</p>
<p>other things, but there was.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s like, at least in my mind, a story of authenticity as well.</p>
<p>And it was both the same thing in the Robin Williams character.</p>
<p>And I just think that that&rsquo;s a message cause watch watching things occur on</p>
<p>the internet as they do now.</p>
<p>Think so many things playing out in the public eye.</p>
<p>I feel like so many private or otherwise formerly private discussions and</p>
<p>disputes and, and, you know, interactions now become, they all have a, a, well,</p>
<p>what is this going to say when it goes public?</p>
<p>So how can I couch what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Or how can I word this in a way that&rsquo;s going to get people on my side or use</p>
<p>the right buzzwords and not use the wrong buzzwords.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just neat to see people.</p>
<p>You know, in their own way, flip the bird to the head, because I just think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s just not how a human being is meant to think or interact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious what you think about the thing that recently has, you know, me like</p>
<p>hosting this podcast, I sometimes think about like, who should I talk to and not</p>
<p>in terms of like, it&rsquo;s the, the old Hitler question now, Hitler, I would definitely</p>
<p>talk to because post world war II, because everyone knows he&rsquo;s evil.</p>
<p>The question, whether you talk to Hitler in 1937, like when people who are really</p>
<p>students of what&rsquo;s going on, understand that this is a very dangerous human being.</p>
<p>But a large number of the part of the world are like, well, he&rsquo;s a leader who</p>
<p>cares for Germany.</p>
<p>So the question I have, it&rsquo;s interesting to me, it involves a particular person</p>
<p>named who also lives in Austin, Texas named Alex Jones.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with the guy.</p>
<p>I am familiar with Mr. Jones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually recently just listened to Infowars, like one episode of his show,</p>
<p>I guess that he does every day.</p>
<p>And it kind of reminds me of a time in college when I drank too much tequila.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no turning back.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, like the mistakes you make that like, it&rsquo;s, I mean, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know where you&rsquo;re going to wake up, you don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re going to kill or</p>
<p>not kill or steal or rob, it&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>So that, it felt like I was getting pulled into a dark place where pretty</p>
<p>much everybody is a pedophile that&rsquo;s trying to control the world.</p>
<p>So Bill Gates definitely is a pedophile.</p>
<p>Everybody in power, anybody in power, there&rsquo;s a kind of a deep skepticism</p>
<p>about power and a conspiratorial way to see the world where everything is</p>
<p>like dark forces in all corners.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the way you feel when you&rsquo;re a kid, that there&rsquo;s a monster hiding</p>
<p>in the closet.</p>
<p>Which is also why you leap over the bed from like four feet away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strategy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, but he says that you&rsquo;re just being weak.</p>
<p>You need to look under the bed.</p>
<p>Under the bed, there&rsquo;s monsters and we need to be aware of them because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re growing, they&rsquo;re multiplying.</p>
<p>You should be.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re touching children.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re touching children.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So it all connects.</p>
<p>But the, the, I, when I listened to him and I thought about like, do I want</p>
<p>to talk to him on this podcast, for example, when I listened to his</p>
<p>conversation with Joe Rogan, the two times he talked on there, to me,</p>
<p>it was somehow entertaining.</p>
<p>Like it was fun to listen to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to listen to a madman go on for four hours because it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like theater.</p>
<p>Like, this is what I talked to Joe about.</p>
<p>When people try to censor Alex Jones, Joe says that the people who try</p>
<p>to censor him don&rsquo;t give enough credit to the intelligence of human</p>
<p>beings to like, understand like that, like what a person says on a</p>
<p>large platform does not necessarily is not the truth.</p>
<p>You can be a madman and say crazy things and people are intelligent</p>
<p>enough to hear certain things being, when they&rsquo;re said like the earth</p>
<p>is flat, they can, they can be intelligent enough not to all of a</p>
<p>sudden start believing that the earth is flat.</p>
<p>Like they, they&rsquo;re intelligent enough to sort of select different</p>
<p>ideas and be able to enjoy the theater of a particular ridiculous</p>
<p>over the top conversation without being sort of influenced to where</p>
<p>they start believing like toxic set of beliefs.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of sort of other kinds of people, especially now</p>
<p>with cancel culture that say, well, you don&rsquo;t want to give platform</p>
<p>to crazy people that ultimately whose beliefs might lead to dangerous</p>
<p>consequences.</p>
<p>Like, and I see it very often now with conspiracy theories that go,</p>
<p>that go like way too far.</p>
<p>Like for example, would, I, I&rsquo;m not, I haven&rsquo;t looked into it, so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry, I will look into it, but it hurts my heart to see that on Bill</p>
<p>Gates, in my opinion, the person who has saved and improved more lives</p>
<p>than probably any human history, literally because of the money he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>invested in helping, like just, just the work he&rsquo;s done on like malaria</p>
<p>in Africa, the number of people he&rsquo;s helped is huge.</p>
<p>And yet every interview, anything you see now on Bill Gates, everyone</p>
<p>is calling him, I believe haven&rsquo;t looked into it, but I believe</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s calling him a pedophile.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the full structure of it, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just a very, it</p>
<p>feels like an army of like, it feels like it&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it feels like.</p>
<p>It might be a much smaller percentage, but it feels like a huge number</p>
<p>of people are calling him a pedophile.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s the flip side.</p>
<p>If you allow, if you give platform to conspiracy theories like that,</p>
<p>then you start to have bigger and bigger percent of the population</p>
<p>believe in these crazy things.</p>
<p>I just, I wanted to put it out there.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t know what to think of that.</p>
<p>If you put yourself in Joe Rogan&rsquo;s shoes, if you put yourself in my</p>
<p>shoes, if you put yourself just in your own shoes, I mean, I&rsquo;m even</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my shoes right now.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re staying in your shoes, just stay in your shoes.</p>
<p>Can I have your, would you talk, would you give platform to people like</p>
<p>Alex Jones, would, would you talk to somebody like Alex Jones or, or not?</p>
<p>Uh, I, yes, I would.</p>
<p>And I feel very strongly about this, honestly.</p>
<p>Um, well, I think that it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s an interesting thing and I, I would</p>
<p>just say a lot of times, um, I can understand, you know, very, very</p>
<p>clearly why people would take issue with the idea of, I guess what they</p>
<p>proceed to be amplifying this man&rsquo;s voice, this man&rsquo;s reach, um, you</p>
<p>know, as, as a demonstrable negative.</p>
<p>But I think, um, you know, when you take a step back further, uh, the,</p>
<p>the cure is more damaging than the disease and significantly.</p>
<p>So, um, I guess I think that I&rsquo;m very, very wary of, I think being where</p>
<p>you mentioned Alex Jones being wary of power and people with it, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of times there&rsquo;s a lot of truth and validity to crazy things that</p>
<p>people say it&rsquo;s the conspiracy theories that stick are the ones that sound</p>
<p>credible, at least quasi credible in some aspect.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like it seems to me like an anchor in people&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>And it is also funny to me, obviously the, the Bill Gates, it&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>to tar people with things like pedophile, racist, rapist, like, these</p>
<p>are things that we&rsquo;re basically trying to pick words that no one can ever</p>
<p>support someone who does these things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, and that changes year by year.</p>
<p>Like currently pedophile is totally in as a thing to call somebody just,</p>
<p>just as a, it used to be communist or Marxist Cleveland Browns fan, you</p>
<p>know, like, come on, you know, actually nobody likes the Browns.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll agree with you.</p>
<p>That was, that&rsquo;s why I picked them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the trick is you find a group of people that nobody likes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good here.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the move, but, uh, yeah, that&rsquo;s a creepy thing though, because</p>
<p>that is, that is the creepy thing is like, if people are always looking</p>
<p>for groups of people are always looking for, and I find this really deeply</p>
<p>disturbing, um, like, Hey, so who&rsquo;s the guy that we can all get away with?</p>
<p>You know, just treating like dirt, who&rsquo;s the guy that I can be a dick to?</p>
<p>I can just walk up and punch in the face and no one&rsquo;s going to say anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, even if I, you know, people do that with, whether it&rsquo;s literal</p>
<p>Nazis or someone that I called a Nazi, you know, I guess what&rsquo;s the bigger issue,</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s ridiculous beliefs or what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And you mentioned Hitler before, and obviously Mein Kampf being a, you know,</p>
<p>like the outline for some of the things he did later and when the evil was it</p>
<p>always there, did it, did it take root later on or flourish later on?</p>
<p>But was, was Adolf Hitler a problem because he had crazy ideas or</p>
<p>because he did things?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not, I think I know it&rsquo;s because he did things.</p>
<p>Now, if I&rsquo;m going to start punishing thought crime, I, I&rsquo;m going to have to</p>
<p>start punishing thought crime.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a terrifying concept.</p>
<p>Even if I&rsquo;m right about the certain, about the objectively correct about the</p>
<p>things that I decide to call out of bounds, who put me in charge and made me</p>
<p>arbiter of good taste and how long until I did it, did it, did it, did it, did it</p>
<p>long until I decide that something else is, is out of bounds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s always a sliding scale or it&rsquo;s always a sliding standard.</p>
<p>And I find that, that, you know, to be more of a concern than people doing</p>
<p>crazy things, because I guess if you mentioned Alex Jones, you know, putting</p>
<p>out ridiculous, ridiculous ideas, ridiculous theories, I think that most</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t look at Alex Jones as a credible person.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not going to pretend to be deeply read into all of his beliefs or the</p>
<p>things that he&rsquo;s trying to peddle.</p>
<p>Um, but there&rsquo;s plenty of things that are quasi mainstream that I think on</p>
<p>with this side or that side that maybe not comparably ridiculous, but are, you</p>
<p>know, particularly in hindsight or, you know, or we&rsquo;re not, or, or silly.</p>
<p>And I guess, uh, the idea of, of getting a group of people together to decide</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re not going to tolerate is a very, very tricky thing.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, it reminds me of law or, you know, even, you</p>
<p>know, religion when it gets to like, what are the things that we don&rsquo;t like?</p>
<p>How do we feel about rape?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, under no circumstances.</p>
<p>Is that an acceptable behavior murder?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not acceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Killing, I don&rsquo;t know, kind of depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Are you at war?</p>
<p>Were you justified?</p>
<p>Were you acting in self defense?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not now murder is a specific type of killing the same way, you know, other</p>
<p>things should be a specific type of something else.</p>
<p>But I guess we, we draw the line of murder.</p>
<p>We say, if you want to exist in our society, you can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>This cannot be done.</p>
<p>And then we go theft.</p>
<p>If someone said, Hey, I murdered that guy.</p>
<p>Can you understand where I&rsquo;m coming from?</p>
<p>I might say, yeah, I&rsquo;ll hear you out.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I think you&rsquo;re right, but I&rsquo;m like, have you ever been wronged</p>
<p>so deeply that you could imagine that you could kill someone?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I haven&rsquo;t, but I could conceptualize someone doing that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>And you still need to go, you still need to face, you know, criminal justice as we</p>
<p>have it in our system, or at least that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve decided.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You have to be able to like, there&rsquo;s, if you look at the history of discourse in</p>
<p>this country, I think it&rsquo;s still true, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s changed since 9 11 is,</p>
<p>uh, it used to be impossible to criticize, um, a soldier.</p>
<p>It was easier to criticize war.</p>
<p>It was harder to criticize soldiers for allowing themselves to be the tools of war.</p>
<p>I tend to be, maybe it&rsquo;s the Russian upbringing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the combat thing.</p>
<p>I tend to romanticize war and soldiers.</p>
<p>I see soldiers as heroes, but I&rsquo;ve also heard people that not only say that soldiers</p>
<p>are, uh, war is bad.</p>
<p>They say soldiers are bad.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their argument?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the kind of a libertarian view that they&rsquo;re basically slaves to evil, right?</p>
<p>War is evil and they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re given, they are suspending their moral and ethical, like,</p>
<p>as like duties as a human being to become the tools of evil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of the argument.</p>
<p>If you see war as evil, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s useful to hear that, but there&rsquo;s for a long</p>
<p>part in history that was completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Same with abortion.</p>
<p>If you see abortion as murder, I mean, if I classify it in that, if I put it in that,</p>
<p>in that basket, it starts, we&rsquo;re living in the midst of like a genocide.</p>
<p>Looked at from that perspective, could you feel how people could be deeply upset by abortion?</p>
<p>You go, of course.</p>
<p>Looked at from a different perspective, you say, I don&rsquo;t believe it to be murder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how I see it.</p>
<p>Then you go, oh, well, if that&rsquo;s the genesis of your, your thought process, then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Now, now I see how we can come to a different thing, but I guess we go, well, abortion is</p>
<p>murder period.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you support it, you support murder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a convenient way for me to tar you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I guess that&rsquo;s kind of coming back to the Alec Jones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m just a nuance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, you have to have the nuance in these kinds of conversations and I have to be willing</p>
<p>to have the conversation and I have to be willing to sit down.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t sit down across from like the most violently racist, angry, hypothetical internet,</p>
<p>you know, conceived person that none of us have ever actually met in real life, but are</p>
<p>hopefully not, you know, and go like, well, of course I believe that this person&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>but allow me to change, do my best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hear them out and I&rsquo;ll go, no, I can go point by point and explain where this guy</p>
<p>or this girl is wrong and hopefully bring them over to a more reasonable position where</p>
<p>they will have better beliefs and they will like objectively better beliefs and beliefs</p>
<p>that will, will, and they&rsquo;ll treat other people better.</p>
<p>Why would I want to marginalize this person?</p>
<p>I might not want to talk.</p>
<p>I might not want to invite them to my barbecue if they&rsquo;re acting like a jerk all the time,</p>
<p>but how could I, would it not make the world a better place if I&rsquo;d hear them out and they</p>
<p>go, look, if you&rsquo;re going to sit down and talk with me, we&rsquo;re going to have to have</p>
<p>a discussion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hear what you have to say.</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t, if I can&rsquo;t explain to someone why their ridiculous belief is wrong, then</p>
<p>I might, I must not be so confident in my position.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s where I come back to the Alex Jones thing.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, you know, with, with Bill Gates and, and you&rsquo;re much more familiar with,</p>
<p>with the specifics of all the good that he&rsquo;s done, but you know, again, he&rsquo;s been an unbelievable</p>
<p>force for good, you know, in this world.</p>
<p>You can list A, B, C, D things that the man has, has done, that his foundation has done</p>
<p>and, you know, positive things.</p>
<p>And then the other people could speculate about ridiculous, crazy levels of, of evil,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t produce any evidence for that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Because if you could, the man will find himself in some trouble, you know?</p>
<p>And anyway, I guess what I would, would say is that why you can&rsquo;t force me to accept the</p>
<p>truth the same way you could write down two plus two equals four on a piece of paper and</p>
<p>show me how it works.</p>
<p>And I could say, no, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it not true.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve still given yourself an opportunity to present your case.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve presented it to me.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also, for anyone listening and watching, you know, you&rsquo;ve been able to critically</p>
<p>assess what&rsquo;s gone on, you know, or critically address back and forth, you know, kind of</p>
<p>the, the discourse.</p>
<p>And I think that you almost, you&rsquo;re making your case for the public.</p>
<p>So I guess like, you know, when it comes to just never not engaging with these people,</p>
<p>that seems to me to be cowardly.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a, something that we&rsquo;re seeing in society right now, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing a crisis of courage in society all over the place.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re seeing poor leadership.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re seeing understandable things happening everywhere, but we need stronger</p>
<p>voices and stronger, stronger beliefs that have a conviction and are willing to engage</p>
<p>with others, not just turning into a shouting contest and not, I didn&rsquo;t win because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more of me.</p>
<p>Oh, I voted, I outvoted you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice too.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a stand in for bullets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s saying I won because there&rsquo;s more of me.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m right because plenty of horrible and unpopular now things have</p>
<p>been very, very deeply popular in the past and would have won a popular vote.</p>
<p>Does that make them right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say clearly not.</p>
<p>So I guess you&rsquo;d hope that we engage with these people and that you can do your best</p>
<p>to bring them over to a more reasonable position if you believe that you have one.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t, well, at least you made the effort.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s something where martial arts shows the value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, do you know if you&rsquo;re going to go win your next fight?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I have no idea.</p>
<p>I will proceed forward with full effort and I will fight with dignity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll fight with honor and I&rsquo;ll fight with courage and I&rsquo;ll use everything that I have</p>
<p>and I will play within the bounds of the game and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And the result will be what it&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll walk into and out of that ring with my head held high because I will know that</p>
<p>I did my part.</p>
<p>I did my job.</p>
<p>The outcome, the specific outcome is not in my control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just strongly in my influence.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s something that helped me, that martial arts has taught me because</p>
<p>other times, even when I was successful or unsuccessful, I would focus on if I won, I</p>
<p>won, therefore I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>I lost, therefore I&rsquo;m bad.</p>
<p>This other guy won or lost, therefore, as opposed to evaluating their method.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s so easy when we&rsquo;re taking a bird&rsquo;s eye view of things to not evaluate</p>
<p>how someone&rsquo;s doing things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not evaluating my process.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re simply evaluating my outcome.</p>
<p>And I could have stumbled into something very, very good or very, very bad.</p>
<p>And we can look back and I think that&rsquo;s the value of history.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t mean to get on my dang high horse, but it&rsquo;s like this value of history</p>
<p>is we can see the unbroken chain or the chain of events that led us somewhere.</p>
<p>And then only with the eyes of history can we truly evaluate things unless we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the room watching it happen.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s, again, where we start to go most of the big, bad, scary things that</p>
<p>have happened in history that are done particularly on an industrial scale, which implies governmental</p>
<p>power and things like that or the equivalent, involve groups of people getting together</p>
<p>and going, hey, we&rsquo;re not going to deal with that guy, giant groups of people.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;re right this time, but maybe we&rsquo;re wrong next time.</p>
<p>And I guess I would be back to the Gandalf putting on the one ring.</p>
<p>I would be very, very hesitant, even if we thought we were in the right to simply try</p>
<p>to try to marginalize just on general principle.</p>
<p>Even people like Alex Jones, whom on their face are pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>Like you said, you should sit down with Adolf Hitler and talk to the man.</p>
<p>I agree with you to play a little devil&rsquo;s advocate is Alex Jones might be a bad example.</p>
<p>But if we look at, because he has a face, he is a human, he&rsquo;s a real person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also trolls on the internet for Chan.</p>
<p>The worry I have with those folks is that, and there might be parallels to martial arts</p>
<p>is they practice guerrilla warfare, meaning they don&rsquo;t necessarily want to arrive at the truth.</p>
<p>They just always want to cut at the ankles of the powerful.</p>
<p>Like they want to always break down the powerful.</p>
<p>And even if they, I mean, it&rsquo;s, they turn everything into a game.</p>
<p>So they let&rsquo;s see if we can make the world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can make a trend that Bill Gates is a pedophile, right?</p>
<p>They make it into a game.</p>
<p>They get excited about this game.</p>
<p>They see the powerful.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can convince that, like, who is the most positive person we can think of.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can turn them into evil.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve tried that with like everybody and it seems to stick and they&rsquo;re good at it.</p>
<p>And some would argue, whatever you think about our current president, that he has some elements</p>
<p>of that, which is he&rsquo;s figured out whatever this music of social discourse that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s figured out how to always troll the mainstream flow of consciousness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the media.</p>
<p>He always kind of says stuff that annoys a very large number of people.</p>
<p>And he enjoys that because it&rsquo;s like taking the powerful, taking the way things were before.</p>
<p>And he like shakes it up by saying the most inappropriate thing, almost on purpose or</p>
<p>instinctually and so on.</p>
<p>The problem I have with that is that doesn&rsquo;t, the powerful thing there is it brings those</p>
<p>in power down a notch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>The negative thing is it doesn&rsquo;t push us closer to a nuanced, careful, rigorous discourse</p>
<p>towards truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like showing up to a party and just like starting to yell.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t create a good conversation.</p>
<p>It just makes everything into a game where truth doesn&rsquo;t even seem like a thing we can</p>
<p>even hope to achieve.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>And I guess, as you mentioned, we&rsquo;ll come back to another movie because I don&rsquo;t do books</p>
<p>and do movies.</p>
<p>Some people just want to watch the world burn, right?</p>
<p>And I guess there&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a creepy, creepy kind of urge that some people have.</p>
<p>And then also is some people you&rsquo;re like, hey, would you like to throw a brick through</p>
<p>that glass window?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Like, no, I&rsquo;m not going to do that because I think about what&rsquo;s going to occur.</p>
<p>Like something&rsquo;s going to be hurt, someone&rsquo;s property not going to do it versus, hey, you</p>
<p>want to see what will happen?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Kids are always like, I have my son, he grabs Spider Man and drops him on the table.</p>
<p>Spider Man fell.</p>
<p>Spider Man didn&rsquo;t fall, Sean.</p>
<p>Like, he dropped him, you knocked him off the table and he&rsquo;ll grin.</p>
<p>And basically, it&rsquo;s an interesting thing, like you said, that these people are appealing</p>
<p>to and also almost like the little dog factor of like people do want to watch the powerful</p>
<p>get taken down a notch for all the good and the not good of that.</p>
<p>Just plenty of people, it seems to me, that have found their way to incredibly high positions.</p>
<p>Some have just found themselves there and many, many, many, many, many people, men and</p>
<p>women of all backgrounds are brilliant and have worked hard.</p>
<p>And yeah, of course, there&rsquo;s luck and there&rsquo;s luck into everything.</p>
<p>LeBron James, in spite of being the best basketball player on God&rsquo;s green earth, is fortunate</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t get hit by a car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fortunate he didn&rsquo;t tear his knee, but thankfully, we get to see all these things.</p>
<p>But I guess if people don&rsquo;t have any skin in the game, you never know what they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the problem with the internet.</p>
<p>You know, that people get to be nameless, be faceless.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why guerrilla fighters are outside of the bounds of war.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have a uniform on.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re from.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get the same treatment that a soldier gets for MP.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s reasons for this, because otherwise people are able to assail things</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no one responsible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to go and say, hey, where did this come from?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the root of this?</p>
<p>How can I address this?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the problem of the internet, the problem of Twitter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a problem in places like 4chan.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing that type of stuff go away, if I&rsquo;m frank.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the same thing as people with a face, people who are willing to stand there</p>
<p>and say, hi, my name is so and so.</p>
<p>Even if I have ridiculous beliefs, hopefully people will hear me out.</p>
<p>And then if I&rsquo;m wrong, educate me.</p>
<p>But I guess you hope that the real, I guess, in my mind, antidote to all of this silliness</p>
<p>is education.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re critical thinking is not necessarily.</p>
<p>I went to school in America, and I feel very fortunate.</p>
<p>But critical thinking is not something that&rsquo;s focused on.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like talking about jujitsu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to teach critical thinking when I don&rsquo;t know any words.</p>
<p>You have to teach me techniques.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t teach me to be an artist.</p>
<p>But recognize that the techniques are the beginning, not the end.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s the artistry that we are searching for, not just the science or the</p>
<p>biro memorization.</p>
<p>And I guess you&rsquo;d hope that people&rsquo;s ability to think critically and recognize that majority</p>
<p>rule or whoever&rsquo;s loudest does not mean that they&rsquo;re right by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t appeal to that.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t bow to that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll help them to help inoculate them against the ridiculous things that come out of these</p>
<p>places, these dark places that are objectively not great.</p>
<p>But I guess all circling back, even if we swatted these bad things out of existence</p>
<p>right now, we&rsquo;ve got to be very, very careful doing that because it&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s doing the swatting.</p>
<p>This political group that&rsquo;s in power right now, the people that support our current president</p>
<p>would maybe feel a certain way.</p>
<p>The people that support another option would feel differently as to what exactly defines</p>
<p>toxic.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s what gives me pause.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But also the grace thing.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that the technology, you said education, but the platforms we use like</p>
<p>Twitter and Reddit and all these platforms have a role to play to teach us grace.</p>
<p>Meaning they should help us incentivize the kind of behavior that is incentivized in real</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Like being a dick in real life is not incentivized.</p>
<p>Like one on one interaction.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s cases where it is, but usually being kind to each other is incentivized.</p>
<p>On the internet, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Like you get likes for mocking people in a funny, in a humorous way.</p>
<p>And it can be dark kind of mocking, depending on the community.</p>
<p>You can go to the appearance.</p>
<p>If somebody is a little fat or a little too skinny, you can comment on their appearance,</p>
<p>the hair, the way the hair looks, like the appearance stuff.</p>
<p>It could be on the people comment all the time on the level of eloquence of my speech.</p>
<p>Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creepy though watching previously, like this used to be low brow though.</p>
<p>Like people doing this type of stuff, it&rsquo;s creepy watching like our political figures</p>
<p>get into this type of game.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s a little bit refreshing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, my hope with Donald Trump was, is that he would shake up the people who wear</p>
<p>suits.</p>
<p>Usually the, like if you&rsquo;re from DC, I remember like showing up, I actually didn&rsquo;t wear what</p>
<p>I usually wear in DC cause I was like, everybody&rsquo;s wearing a suit and tie when I was like giving</p>
<p>talks and stuff.</p>
<p>Except for Mudge, who wears jeans and a t shirt.</p>
<p>Mudge doesn&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p>Mudge is a forever renegade.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t even remember what, oh yeah.</p>
<p>So my hope with Trump was that he would shake up that system to say like, to inject new</p>
<p>ideas, to inject new energy.</p>
<p>Of course, the way it turned out is different, but like there&rsquo;s, it turns out that you might</p>
<p>want to have somebody who&rsquo;s like an Andrew Yang type character who is full of ideas that</p>
<p>are very different and inject the energy, new energy into the system through youthful</p>
<p>new ideas versus through the troll that like, that&rsquo;s very good at sort of mocking and like</p>
<p>playing outside the rules of the game.</p>
<p>But Trump did reveal powerfully, I don&rsquo;t know what to think of it, that it&rsquo;s just a game</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to play by the rules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s both inspiring and dark.</p>
<p>Deeply depressing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean the same, I&rsquo;m not drawing parallels, not drawing parallels between our</p>
<p>president and Adolf Hitler, but it&rsquo;s certainly, and there&rsquo;s a lot of, in history, a lot of</p>
<p>positive and a lot of negative things happen when charismatic leaders realize they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to play by the rules.</p>
<p>You can just flip the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that Kevin Spacey show.</p>
<p>House of Cards.</p>
<p>House of Cards, where you just flip the table or whatever.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to play by the rules of the chess game.</p>
<p>You can flip the table.</p>
<p>One wonders if that&rsquo;s always been done in private, you know?</p>
<p>I guess, because that&rsquo;s, I mean, even look, obviously, the United States is a republic,</p>
<p>but we had Bush, then we had Clinton, then we had more Bush, then we had President Obama,</p>
<p>then we were about to have another Clinton.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fairly creepy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even on its own.</p>
<p>But now we added another, I mean, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll have a generation of Trumps now.</p>
<p>Gee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Russian, so I think we humans like kings still and queens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, we&rsquo;re attracted to the thing we talked about, coaches.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in us that longs towards that authoritarian control.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about America, the Second Amendment, is we also like individual</p>
<p>freedom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the unique aspects at the founding of this country and still, and for me, is</p>
<p>the beacon of hope that somehow there&rsquo;s the fire of freedom burns in like that Texas feel.</p>
<p>That gives me hope.</p>
<p>The FU energy that revolts against the power, which as we discussed, power corrupts and</p>
<p>ultimately leads to degradation of whoever&rsquo;s ruling the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting though.</p>
<p>It seems to me, maybe I&rsquo;m just, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m reading this properly when I see it,</p>
<p>but it seems to me that, like you said, that flip the bird, I&rsquo;m going to do me within reason.</p>
<p>As long as I&rsquo;m not hurting you, is idea that very much, at least in my mind, defines the</p>
<p>American ideal or at least part of the consciousness of the United States is under attack to a</p>
<p>certain extent.</p>
<p>If only I can think to maybe a generation behind us, it&rsquo;s becoming more collectivist</p>
<p>for all the good and also the not good of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not in terms of policy at this point, but just in terms of consciousness.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that&rsquo;s an internet thing.</p>
<p>People are more in touch with one another than they&rsquo;ve, as far as I can tell, have ever</p>
<p>been, or at least more than in my lifetime.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world seems much closer than it did.</p>
<p>Living in Virginia, California seems very far away.</p>
<p>Being on the internet, it&rsquo;s just right there.</p>
<p>I can hear about it.</p>
<p>I can see it.</p>
<p>I can interact with people from there.</p>
<p>I remember being in Tennessee at one time and reading about events taking place in the</p>
<p>Middle East.</p>
<p>And that just seemed like a mile away.</p>
<p>It seemed like an unbelievably far distance.</p>
<p>And then another time when you&rsquo;re in DC, you just feel like, oh, you read about something</p>
<p>happening in Paris.</p>
<p>And it just feels like it&rsquo;s just right around the corner because DC is a seat of power where</p>
<p>things are just occurring all the time.</p>
<p>And I guess you wonder about that&rsquo;s where I come back to the group decisions to not</p>
<p>listen to this person or to cancel this.</p>
<p>We all, the moral majority, shall do the following as opposed to as long as you&rsquo;re not hurting</p>
<p>me and as long as you&rsquo;re not hurting anyone else, I have to let you do, I have to let</p>
<p>you be on general principle.</p>
<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t like you, I&rsquo;m very free to not like you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m free to speak out against you, but I&rsquo;m not, it is not within my right or, and not</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, I would not be right to attempt to attack you.</p>
<p>And that is an interesting thing though, when we see words being redefined or words being</p>
<p>defined, whether it&rsquo;s toxicity, whether it&rsquo;s violence, if I think that what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is your speech is by itself a violence or a precursor to violence, I&rsquo;m justified in</p>
<p>doing all sorts of things.</p>
<p>And that creeps me out significantly because again, even if it ends up being pointed in</p>
<p>a good direction initially, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>And actually that brings me to another, yeah, I got all day.</p>
<p>How much are they paying you?</p>
<p>But we about say the Frank Herbert estate, not enough frankly, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>And how many books are there in Dune?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a Jen question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also a fan of Dune?</p>
<p>I read the whole series, but not a couple of the, I read all the prequels as well with</p>
<p>the exception of a couple.</p>
<p>Is there a book one for Dune?</p>
<p>Dune would be book one.</p>
<p>And even the prequels, it&rsquo;s still all better if you start, like I read Dune and then read</p>
<p>the original, what is it?</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>And then I went back and started to read some of the books.</p>
<p>Just like watching Star Wars, you want to start episode four or whatever?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the move and then stop at six, call it a day, watch The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>Well, I thought you&rsquo;re not walking back here.</p>
<p>No, I like The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>That is what I said.</p>
<p>I was told that I was heartless for not liking Baby Yoda, who I&hellip;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk about a couple of the movies, not including The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>The Mandalorian is fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the more recent movies that we don&rsquo;t like to talk about.</p>
<p>Oh, the&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>The goofy guy.</p>
<p>Ryan.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>No, the creature, the goofy creature with the&hellip;</p>
<p>Jar Jar?</p>
<p>Yeah, Jar Jar.</p>
<p>Do you ever see the Jar Jar Binks is actually like the Dark Lord of the Sith theory?</p>
<p>That fixed the whole initial trilogy where he&rsquo;s goofing around and making it all the</p>
<p>way through battles.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re like, wait a minute, he oops his way, walks over to a pool, does a triple</p>
<p>backflip, falls in, you&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s just bizarre that you&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the Alex Jones theory of Star Wars.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually running everything.</p>
<p>He was the one that actually was like, hey, we should vote in Chancellor Palpatine, or</p>
<p>Senator Palpatine, right before they put Jar Jar in charge.</p>
<p>First off, what did they think was gonna happen?</p>
<p>And second off, I just think that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oops, oh man, I guess he&rsquo;s the emperor now.</p>
<p>That would have been great.</p>
<p>But actually, to the cancel and all the other stuff, again, you&rsquo;d hope that it gives pause.</p>
<p>And I think about this for fighting, because a lot of times&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use this as an example, people fight fans in UFC, they love people that run out</p>
<p>and try to murder each other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s entertaining, and it&rsquo;s super entertaining.</p>
<p>But Floyd Mayweather doesn&rsquo;t resonate with people as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people start&hellip;</p>
<p>I remember the time when Floyd was not as popular.</p>
<p>Now people think people love Floyd because he&rsquo;s 50 and oh Floyd.</p>
<p>And oh man, and finally he had so much success that we all can&rsquo;t help but recognize the man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>genius and greatness.</p>
<p>But prior to that, oh, he&rsquo;s boring, he&rsquo;s this, he&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>He fights with his circumspect, he&rsquo;s cautious, he&rsquo;s pressing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s intelligent, deeply intelligent.</p>
<p>And when you watch people go out and try to murder each other, you can flip a coin 100</p>
<p>times and you could be lucky enough to get 100 heads, but it&rsquo;s still a coin flip.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on all the time is people are getting an outcome</p>
<p>that they want, but it wasn&rsquo;t a well thought out situation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll win by five in a row by knockout and then lose three in a row.</p>
<p>And then people will go, well, what happened to that guy?</p>
<p>He used to be so great.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, no, he&rsquo;s doing what he&rsquo;s always been doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it was getting great outcomes on a coin flip prior, and it&rsquo;s getting negative</p>
<p>outcomes on a coin flip now.</p>
<p>But I guess what I would say is it watches, it&rsquo;s interesting watching, I guess, societal</p>
<p>beliefs become such a thing that we&rsquo;re almost adopting on a religious level if we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>careful.</p>
<p>If when I say religious level, I mean like pan life, like this is guiding all of my</p>
<p>choices for all the good and the bad of that.</p>
<p>And this is a Dune quote is, when religion and politics travel in the same cart, the</p>
<p>writers believe that nothing can stand in their way.</p>
<p>Their movements become headlong faster and faster and faster.</p>
<p>They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget that the precipice does not show itself</p>
<p>to the man in the blind rush until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s, again, the pause.</p>
<p>We go, oh man, thank goodness we have this guy that wants to rebuild Germany.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll put us back where we need to be.</p>
<p>And you stop questioning your own judgment, your own, you stop thinking essentially.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not allowed to question this.</p>
<p>Of course this is correct.</p>
<p>Of course, of course I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>I intended to do right.</p>
<p>So of course my actions are correct.</p>
<p>I mean, how many times have any of us intended to do something helpful and ended up doing</p>
<p>something less?</p>
<p>And plenty of people who intend to do harm could by accident do something decent.</p>
<p>And I guess it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m not saying anything terribly, terribly insightful, but it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>one of those where it&rsquo;s hard to say in the moment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you hopefully caution, you would counsel some degree of caution.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what worries me with people deciding that we&rsquo;re all so right about this or we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all so right about that and attempting to rather than win the argument, silence the</p>
<p>counter argument, no matter how crazy it may seem.</p>
<p>Because I just think that that idea, even when it&rsquo;s pointed in a good direction initially,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re amongst many things, a Jiu Jitsu black belt.</p>
<p>One of the things that people are really curious about white belts and blue belts in Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>but also people haven&rsquo;t tried the art is what does it take to be a Jiu Jitsu black belt?</p>
<p>I think that, you know, everyone&rsquo;s journey is a little bit different, but the one thing</p>
<p>that the, it was a Calvin Coolidge quote, you know, determination, persistence is the</p>
<p>only thing that will win in the end.</p>
<p>It will always win in the end.</p>
<p>Not brilliance, not toughness, not education, it&rsquo;s persistence.</p>
<p>And I think that having the belief that no matter what happens to me, I will proceed</p>
<p>forward and I will figure out how to make this happen, hell or high water, I think is</p>
<p>the one thing that ties together all of the people that I&rsquo;ve ever met that made it through</p>
<p>whatever it was that they were going through.</p>
<p>Because, you know, sometimes you can get lucky and you can have an easy time or and that</p>
<p>luck could be you had a good situation.</p>
<p>It could be, I mean, like in the obvious sense of like where you&rsquo;re living, where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>training, what&rsquo;s going on, you had a good situation, you&rsquo;re unbelievably athletic.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re going to be an astronaut, you&rsquo;re brilliant and an Olympic athlete, you know,</p>
<p>like, well, that&rsquo;s a fantastic situation.</p>
<p>You know, you won the genetic lottery and I&rsquo;m sure you worked hard as well, but you</p>
<p>also won the genetic lottery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a determination is the one thing, though, because that person could have a very easy</p>
<p>go of it initially and then tear their knee.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re no longer the superhuman physical specimen that they were.</p>
<p>The only thing that will keep them going is persistence.</p>
<p>And I think that that I would just say that persistence to say I&rsquo;ll just put one foot</p>
<p>in front of the other.</p>
<p>And sometimes I can see the path ahead and sometimes it&rsquo;s beyond my vision, but I will</p>
<p>not stop.</p>
<p>I may even slow down, but I won&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only thing that I can say that I&rsquo;ve seen tie everyone together because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many ways to the top of any mountain and there&rsquo;s so many different personalities and</p>
<p>skills and backgrounds involved.</p>
<p>But everyone, everyone carries on.</p>
<p>So at the core, the foundational advice is just don&rsquo;t quit.</p>
<p>Just keep going.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the lesson of martial arts.</p>
<p>I think, you know, we think it&rsquo;s like how to be strong or how to be how to win.</p>
<p>But in reality, it&rsquo;s like how to persist, how to endure, because it&rsquo;s all of us have</p>
<p>been beaten so many times and gotten beaten up so many times and thought about quitting.</p>
<p>Have I ever thought about quitting?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Have I ever quit?</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>I will never, ever quit ever.</p>
<p>I can say that you might not me out.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be damned if I quit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the darkest moment?</p>
<p>Is it injury related?</p>
<p>Like, is it, uh, so like, to me, like two possibilities, I&rsquo;ve fortunately never been</p>
<p>seriously injured, but I think that&rsquo;s a dark place to be like having to be out for many</p>
<p>months, uh, for, um, as Jen was saying, like with a head injury, especially like the uncertainty</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>And then the other side is if you have big ambitions as a competitor, realizing that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not as good, like those, those doubts were like, I kind of suck.</p>
<p>How am I supposed to be a world?</p>
<p>The greatest fighter of all time.</p>
<p>If I, if, if like several people in the gym are kicking my ass, those are the two things</p>
<p>that paralyze you.</p>
<p>I think that everyone&rsquo;s darkest moment is maybe different looking from the outside for</p>
<p>Ryan.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that he&rsquo;s had injuries and he&rsquo;s had bad ones.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that was his darkest moment.</p>
<p>I think for me, I would say some of my head injury was my darkest moment.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve torn my ACL twice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve torn my shoulders four times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had lots of surgeries.</p>
<p>For me, the orthopedic injuries were not the most difficult.</p>
<p>It was the brain injury for others that might be the case for them.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;ve never experienced an injury and maybe for them, that&rsquo;s their darkest moment</p>
<p>from the outside, obviously Ryan can speak to this more, but for Ryan, I think it was</p>
<p>the inability to, to perform at certain points to the upper, the missing of opportunities</p>
<p>that for him, from my perspective, watching him go through and having seen various points</p>
<p>of his growth from, from early purple belt on, I think the hardest time for him looking</p>
<p>in obviously was when he would hit moments where he wasn&rsquo;t able to perform for various</p>
<p>reasons.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t get fights.</p>
<p>He, he was having difficulties there.</p>
<p>I think that that was the hardest point for him.</p>
<p>Did you, did you think like with the head injury that you might not, never be able to</p>
<p>jujitsu again?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I, I, mine was very, was really bad and it was just the one hit, but I had a looping</p>
<p>memories for seven months.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t know it because when your brain&rsquo;s messed up, you&rsquo;re not even aware that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looping.</p>
<p>And so I saw two different neurologists.</p>
<p>I finally, like it took a very long time.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know if I was going to be able to have like linear thoughts or read a book.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know at certain points if I could listen to music again, you know, without it</p>
<p>making my head hurt.</p>
<p>And so it was almost two years before I woke up in the morning without a headache.</p>
<p>Just waking up before I even start my day.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s even bigger than jujitsu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s just hard.</p>
<p>And I think that you can experience so many things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had all these injuries.</p>
<p>We lost a baby when I was 15, 15 weeks.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had all these experiences and what the hardest point for me, not saying all those</p>
<p>things weren&rsquo;t hard, but it&rsquo;s kind of like, well, did you go through these?</p>
<p>You just realize like life goes on and you have to keep working at it and you have to</p>
<p>keep going.</p>
<p>And you asked me earlier offline, did I feel depressed and not for my head injury.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that at least in the moment I had a, any recognition of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like, but I think different people&rsquo;s personalities.</p>
<p>I have kind of the like buckle down and just keep going.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s not until lots of time later that you realize, wow, that was really</p>
<p>hard because you&rsquo;re just struggling to live and function and do the things that you need</p>
<p>to do along the way.</p>
<p>Do you mind jumping on just like this part of the conversation just for a few minutes?</p>
<p>Do you mind, you know, just sitting together?</p>
<p>Oh, not at all.</p>
<p>Just for a little bit, it&rsquo;d be cool if we put a face to it, you know, is it okay with</p>
<p>you?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fine with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine with you.</p>
<p>By the way, what was the head injury?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind sharing.</p>
<p>Someone had dropped their knee on the back of my head during training.</p>
<p>It was a lot bigger than me.</p>
<p>So one strike to the back of the head is too much for someone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason that&rsquo;s outlawed in MMA, right?</p>
<p>Someone 50 pounds heavier than you dropped their knee on the back of your head once.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the funny thing about getting hit, right?</p>
<p>You never can really be sure what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually one of the magical parts about jiu jitsu where, like, if you choke</p>
<p>me, if we know what&rsquo;s going to occur, you hit someone, they might be completely unharmed.</p>
<p>You might be punching Tony Ferguson in the face and you need to hit him with a sledge</p>
<p>hammer to affect this man.</p>
<p>And then other people, they could get really badly hurt, which I guess it&rsquo;s back to your</p>
<p>point about street fighting and things like that and serious, serious potential, second,</p>
<p>third order consequences of any action that we take.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s a tricky thing about getting hit.</p>
<p>How does it make you feel that, like the really shitty thing about injuries to me was that</p>
<p>like you start thinking like, well, if I did this one little thing different, like this</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have happened today.</p>
<p>Like one moment changes your entire life.</p>
<p>Is that, do you think that way or is that totally counterproductive?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t help but think that way when you&rsquo;ve had the amount of injuries I&rsquo;ve had, because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had more than most people&rsquo;s fair share.</p>
<p>As my orthopedic says, you don&rsquo;t want to win that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to win the contest of who&rsquo;s had the most.</p>
<p>But since you have, you&rsquo;re building me a pool.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think you can&rsquo;t help but think that way sometimes, but I definitely don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s, I think it can be facilitated if you don&rsquo;t beat yourself up too much.</p>
<p>Because thinking about why have I been subject to so many injuries and a lot of it comes</p>
<p>to just almost all of mine in particular are people a lot heavier than me.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;ve been training martial arts 15 years, I&rsquo;m obviously on the much smaller side.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a woman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done thousands and thousands of rounds with people 50 pounds plus heavier than me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been years not training with anyone less than 50 pounds, which is 50 pounds is almost</p>
<p>half my body weight.</p>
<p>And when you also add testosterone, the natural physiological advantages of men, not just</p>
<p>are they heavier with more mass, they&rsquo;re faster, they&rsquo;re more explosive, they&rsquo;re stronger</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re the same size.</p>
<p>And so I think that the willingness to be in that environment over and over and over</p>
<p>again creates a lot of strength, resiliency, willingness to continue.</p>
<p>But it also like in order to do that, you almost have to, for me, the way I was approaching</p>
<p>it was like pretend like I wasn&rsquo;t more vulnerable and just be willing to step in and step in</p>
<p>and step in until you make it kind of thing until you make it kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I&rsquo;ll just one day I&rsquo;ll be strong enough.</p>
<p>And you avoided injury for most, for most of those rounds, I would enjoy the problem</p>
<p>as Ryan points out is that like you could do thousands of rounds, but if one person</p>
<p>that size, that strength, that hover reacts in a way that you don&rsquo;t expect, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like an oops, it&rsquo;s like always major.</p>
<p>Do you regret any of it?</p>
<p>I think that most no one I know has experienced the degree of injuries that I&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>And I started just at a time when 2005 is very different than now where you have the</p>
<p>coaches have more control over what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more aware in general about a lot of the injuries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more people who are hobbyists than when I started.</p>
<p>They were hobbyists, but it was different kind of hobbyists, you know, than now.</p>
<p>Now, our girls can train with other girls.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to do thousands of rounds with somebody significantly more powerful</p>
<p>than them.</p>
<p>And for the drawbacks and the benefits of that, you know, as with anything.</p>
<p>So I think I think that I don&rsquo;t think I would go back and change it.</p>
<p>There were times after one of my injuries where I said to Ryan, I said, I quit, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing this anymore.</p>
<p>I probably said it more than once, but there was one time I was really serious in 2012.</p>
<p>I was really serious.</p>
<p>I tore my shoulder.</p>
<p>I had I was looking at missing a big competition again in the world for my second or third</p>
<p>year in a row after injuries.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;d quit my job two years before.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>And Ryan, before that had always been, you know, keep me focused.</p>
<p>And then he kind of said, OK, if you want to be done, be done.</p>
<p>Just just have a good time.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m really done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to train anymore.</p>
<p>OK, OK.</p>
<p>And then, you know, I think he helped facilitate a moment for me to go visit a friend, some</p>
<p>friends, some girls that were doing a girls camp who are close to my size or some friends</p>
<p>of mine to go train.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, wait, I do love this thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder for me on a daily basis, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t love this thing.</p>
<p>And it really helped change my mind.</p>
<p>I started to connect with other people, travel more myself because previously he had done</p>
<p>that, but I hadn&rsquo;t really done that.</p>
<p>I think there was a point where when I started YouTube, it was just for fun.</p>
<p>I just wanted to sport after college.</p>
<p>I played sports as a kid.</p>
<p>I want to just want to exercise.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t into the martial arts.</p>
<p>He used to give me a hard time about it because he was always very, how can you not care about</p>
<p>martial arts?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just want to play sports.</p>
<p>And Ryan was really big into kind of the philosophy side of the martial arts aspect.</p>
<p>He used to give me a hard time.</p>
<p>And I think after that moment, this moment where I looked at myself and I said, do I</p>
<p>want to keep doing this, is when I started to appreciate jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>It took off some of the pressure I&rsquo;d been feeling, I think, as Ryan&rsquo;s girlfriend.</p>
<p>But I had a full time job a long time.</p>
<p>It was never my goal to be a jiu jitsu world champion.</p>
<p>And I think after that moment where I was like, you know, I really do like this.</p>
<p>I really do want to do this.</p>
<p>I had this moment like any time where you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m doing this for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing this for him.</p>
<p>And I think that that was really lucky for me because how often in our lives,</p>
<p>do we have a kind of a challenge where we have to stop and we have to say, is this really</p>
<p>what I want?</p>
<p>How often in a relationship do you do that?</p>
<p>How often in any type of lifestyle or job do you stop and do you really ask yourself,</p>
<p>is something really difficult happened that you look and you go, am I just doing this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s convenient and easy?</p>
<p>Or is this what I really want to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve had those moments.</p>
<p>Like this podcast is one of those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you stop and think like, I actually love this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I had that with jiu jitsu too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I had said until like brown belt that I stop.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it&rsquo;s when you first face real challenges, you think like, why am I doing</p>
<p>this?</p>
<p>I think most of my progression was why not?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the right, the leap of faith.</p>
<p>And then at a certain point you think like, why am I doing this?</p>
<p>And if you can answer, honestly, that because I love it, it&rsquo;s kind of a liberating feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, yeah, it&rsquo;s so powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an acceptance.</p>
<p>Then you feel thankful for the opportunity to be there, right?</p>
<p>Because you love it.</p>
<p>And you go, man, this is great gratitude.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s ultimately gratitude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>So Ryan said like, what is it?</p>
<p>I took over your thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, nobody cares about Ryan.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll Photoshop him out or whatever.</p>
<p>However you do that, it&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>Put Sean Connery&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just like a Dune ad over there.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Sean Connery, I could get down on that.</p>
<p>Is that the sexiest man in Sean Connery?</p>
<p>In the Dune universe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my understanding.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think in any universe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, Myron Gosling, give him.</p>
<p>We actually named our son after Sean Connery.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>He was in The Rock.</p>
<p>That was, I love all those lame.</p>
<p>Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Connery is probably the greatest movie of all time.</p>
<p>Dude, his accent in Connery was so awesome.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s from.</p>
<p>Alabama, I guess, or something.</p>
<p>I love that they got like Steve Buscemi in there.</p>
<p>Like we need Steve Buscemi in this thing.</p>
<p>We got him.</p>
<p>Dave Chappelle.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a prisoner in there.</p>
<p>Eight ball.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Greatest movie of all time.</p>
<p>Should have won an Oscar.</p>
<p>Dave Chappelle also in Blue Street with Martin Lawrence.</p>
<p>And then, what do you call it?</p>
<p>Robin Hood Men in Tights.</p>
<p>Oh, Robin Hood Men in Tights was one of my favorites as a kid.</p>
<p>Half baked.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s a good.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>We just listed off some really bad 90s movies, but.</p>
<p>You take that back.</p>
<p>For telling our age.</p>
<p>Speak yourself.</p>
<p>So what, like in your view, I don&rsquo;t mean to, from like a smaller person, I guess.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting thing about Jiu Jitsu is like that small.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I hope, hopefully it&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Elf.</p>
<p>Elves are taller.</p>
<p>Like with all these like bigger people, you could still enjoy the art.</p>
<p>Like what does it take to get a black belt to excel, to quote unquote, master the art?</p>
<p>Gosh, everyone has such a different path.</p>
<p>Ryan&rsquo;s promoted six, seven people.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>And I think about half of them have had kids, have families, have other careers.</p>
<p>At the time, some of them competed a lot.</p>
<p>Some of them have never competed or rarely competed.</p>
<p>Some haven&rsquo;t competed in a long time.</p>
<p>Some had started different places.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s had different journeys, even in our own little group of seven.</p>
<p>I think only maybe only two or three were high level competitors of that group.</p>
<p>At the higher belts, right, like brown, black, maybe.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just different for every person.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that we try to tell our students.</p>
<p>We have 400 students.</p>
<p>And do we have this?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have anyone who&rsquo;s a stated other than like the coaches like Adam,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have anyone who&rsquo;s like a stated high level competitor as a student at the moment.</p>
<p>People look at our gym and go, it&rsquo;s lots of competitors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not lots of competitors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never been lots of competitors.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had ones and twos here and there.</p>
<p>But really everybody&rsquo;s in it for the long term if they&rsquo;re in it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the high level competitors are the ones that are more likely to drop off</p>
<p>because they have a bit of success, particularly at blue or purple.</p>
<p>And then they realize how hard it is at brown and black.</p>
<p>And then they have a hard time continuing on that path.</p>
<p>And then they can&rsquo;t look at themselves as a noncompetitor.</p>
<p>They have a hard time continuing with Jiu Jitsu, I think.</p>
<p>Whereas sometimes it&rsquo;s the guy who comes in as a white belt and he trains twice a week,</p>
<p>twice a week, every week.</p>
<p>And the next thing you know, he&rsquo;s been there for two or three years.</p>
<p>Like, oh, he&rsquo;s a blue belt.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a purple belt.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brown belt.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just consistent over a long period of time and willing to take the path.</p>
<p>And no two people&rsquo;s path is exactly the same.</p>
<p>No two people&rsquo;s lives are exactly the same.</p>
<p>We have students who started as a white belt as a young adult with no responsibilities.</p>
<p>And they train all the time.</p>
<p>And then they have a job.</p>
<p>Then they graduate college.</p>
<p>Then they have a job.</p>
<p>Then they have married.</p>
<p>Then they have kids.</p>
<p>Then they have different points in their careers and at different points in your life.</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu will be there for whatever way that you&rsquo;re willing to accept it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s place, I think.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s actually kind of back to the initial question we discussed about what makes</p>
<p>a warrior and also what makes something or someone particularly impressive in my mind</p>
<p>is like what they make out of what they have.</p>
<p>One of my favorite movies ever is Forrest Gump.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s obviously it&rsquo;s just if you can&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;ve heard people go, Forrest Gump</p>
<p>sucks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t like you as a person.</p>
<p>And you have no heart at all.</p>
<p>But basically, it&rsquo;s the story of someone that tries hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, but it&rsquo;s a funny movie.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, you know, I guess you meet each person where they are, you know, and</p>
<p>obviously you want everyone needs to be pushed.</p>
<p>We all need to be pushed.</p>
<p>We need friends and people around us that push us to be better versions of ourselves</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned, the people you spend all of your time around deeply impact you.</p>
<p>And we have to be willing to be pushed.</p>
<p>It takes a leap of faith for me to trust, for me to put some of myself in my, you know,</p>
<p>I guess my ability, my control, my personal agency, as it were, in the hands of someone</p>
<p>else that I trust and that I respect.</p>
<p>But if I can do that, again, maybe I never become, you know, high level black belt competitor.</p>
<p>But, you know, I had four of the things I was doing in my life.</p>
<p>I also have a family.</p>
<p>I have this, I have that, you know, what that person was able to accomplish in the martial</p>
<p>arts relative to what they were able to put in this phenomenal, you know, other times</p>
<p>someone could be a very successful black belt and in my mind be a bum because they could</p>
<p>have been a lot more.</p>
<p>And, you know, they could have done more.</p>
<p>They could have focused more.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no shame in deciding that you don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>But whatever it is that you&rsquo;re invested in, I remember the Take It Uneasy podcast and</p>
<p>that I loved because, you know, I&rsquo;ll just chill out like resting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like vacation.</p>
<p>Oh, who wants to go on vacation?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll go on vacation for a day or two.</p>
<p>You want to spend three weeks on vacation?</p>
<p>Like, I kill myself.</p>
<p>Like, get me out of here.</p>
<p>Like, this is horrible.</p>
<p>This is I&rsquo;m a waste of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing anything useful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re technically on vacation right now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, this is fun, though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a one day vacation.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re thinking about jumping off of the building right now.</p>
<p>But if you had to talk to me for, you know, like three days, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>shove me off the building.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be dead.</p>
<p>Five hours in.</p>
<p>But, yeah, but, you know, it&rsquo;s like you want to be pushing towards something because otherwise</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the purpose of being here?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not just a college.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing something useful, building, growing as a person, helping others do the same if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s within your power at any given time.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s kind of the neat thing about martial arts is it can be many, many</p>
<p>different things to many different people.</p>
<p>You know, I finally, for instance, was able to get a college degree this year.</p>
<p>That which I mean, it&rsquo;s not a big deal for most people, but for me it was a big deal</p>
<p>because I was going back and finish.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I never envisioned ever going back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a hard step to go back and finish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always heavy on you if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I was just I was more proud of that than most things I&rsquo;ve ever done, if I&rsquo;m honest.</p>
<p>You know, and it was neat and I really enjoyed it and it was the process of doing it.</p>
<p>But, you know, are my academic credentials impressive?</p>
<p>Like, not in the least.</p>
<p>But for me, it&rsquo;s like it was a big deal for me personally to take that step and to go</p>
<p>back and do that.</p>
<p>And I was I was proud of the the direction and because it would have been easy, like,</p>
<p>do I need to do it?</p>
<p>Like, no, I&rsquo;m in our business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do OK.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep fighting.</p>
<p>But I was happy to take the time in between fights when I was when I was unbooked for</p>
<p>an opponent to do something productive rather than just I&rsquo;ll just hang out.</p>
<p>You know, like I can still train every single day, but I can also train and go to school.</p>
<p>People go to the Olympics while going to school.</p>
<p>I can I can do martial arts and go to school.</p>
<p>One thing I got to ask is, you know, a bunch of women listen to this podcast if they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>done Jiu Jitsu, I think it&rsquo;d be kind of intimidating to step on the mat with a bunch of bros that</p>
<p>like enjoy somehow killing each other.</p>
<p>Like, how do you succeed in that environment to where you can learn this art, learn how</p>
<p>to beat all those people up?</p>
<p>Oh, gosh.</p>
<p>Is there any advice?</p>
<p>I mean, another way to ask that is like if any women listening to this are interested</p>
<p>in starting Jiu Jitsu, like, is there advice for that journey?</p>
<p>Honestly, I think it&rsquo;s just walking in the door and starting.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t know how to respond to that because I&rsquo;m not I don&rsquo;t view myself as typically</p>
<p>anxious, particularly in interactions with other people or new people.</p>
<p>Shy is not a word that has been used for me by if you ask my family and they joke because</p>
<p>our son talks a lot.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s advanced verbally and they&rsquo;re always like, oh, well, let&rsquo;s we know where he gets</p>
<p>that from because he just doesn&rsquo;t stop talking.</p>
<p>He narrates everything he does.</p>
<p>And so they always tease because that&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m known for for kind of talking a lot.</p>
<p>But so I haven&rsquo;t been typically I&rsquo;m not I don&rsquo;t consider myself a shy person.</p>
<p>So for me, going into a new room, a new group of people is, you know, there&rsquo;s always that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really know who they are, how they&rsquo;re going to treat you.</p>
<p>But I typically but I don&rsquo;t have a lot of anxiety with that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t if that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s going to put something up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how to to address that particular feeling.</p>
<p>But in terms of all of the rooms I&rsquo;ve been and I have popped into gyms before I knew</p>
<p>Ryan in Florida, like I traveled for my job in Germany and Florida and in California and</p>
<p>places where where I don&rsquo;t know anyone, they don&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p>And I have never once had anyone be anything other than than kind and solicitous and helpful</p>
<p>and long before when I was a white belt and a blue belt and didn&rsquo;t know anything and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know anyone.</p>
<p>And I just think that it&rsquo;s a community of people that it&rsquo;s so cool that no matter where</p>
<p>you go in the world, I walked into a gym in Prague one time where only two people spoke</p>
<p>English and and it was just yes, weird, you know, it&rsquo;s weird that like part of a group</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, Oh, let me tell you what it&rsquo;s like to be part of a cult, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s like a positive cult, like it for sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we would say as cultists.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, we do need to murder everybody who practice Aikido.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s this cult deeply believes it.</p>
<p>No, but there is a like if you look at different kinds of games like chess and so on, like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a skepticism.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s not a brotherhood, sisterhood feeling with Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can roll into most places.</p>
<p>Even like with Judo, like I can see the contrast like because I&rsquo;ve trained in Judo places.</p>
<p>It it&rsquo;s more like tribal, like you walk in and like, who is this?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s that kind of feeling with Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less so there is a little bit with like the competitors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always like the competitors feeling each other out usually like the blue belts.</p>
<p>But like outside of that, in terms of if you don&rsquo;t get the if you walk in with the vibes of just</p>
<p>loving the art and just wanting to have a good time, you&rsquo;re like welcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really great thing.</p>
<p>I think in as a woman, I think you you think you&rsquo;re walking into these rooms of these,</p>
<p>you know, big, strong, tough guys.</p>
<p>And if anything, I would I would say that they&rsquo;re almost like much more solicitous when</p>
<p>a woman comes in there and not like they&rsquo;re just like hitting on you all the time.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just that you walk in and everyone is like, oh, cool.</p>
<p>You want to do this thing that I love.</p>
<p>Let me make sure you have a good experience and take care of you.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s an experience that that I hope people have when they come into our gym.</p>
<p>And and I&rsquo;ve always felt when I walked into other gyms.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we try our best to to make that comfortable.</p>
<p>And it can be a little uncomfortable because there are when you walk into a male dominated</p>
<p>environment, there&rsquo;s conversations and topics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different style of camaraderie and joking that a lot of men will do that.</p>
<p>Maybe some women are more uncomfortable with.</p>
<p>I grew up with four brothers, so I kind of maybe was a little more desensitized to that.</p>
<p>And I worked for the Department of Defense for a while, too.</p>
<p>So before I do with the government.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So so I did that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already skeptical.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Oh, you left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to ask you about UFOs then, because you&rsquo;re not going to tell me the truth.</p>
<p>No, they exist.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>No, you just freaked out a lot of people.</p>
<p>OK, but yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, where&rsquo;s where&rsquo;s your school?</p>
<p>Because people always ask like where?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re outside of Washington, D.C., in Northern Virginia, in Falls Church.</p>
<p>You always want to pick like, what&rsquo;s the best school if I travel to this place or if I want</p>
<p>to move to this place?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s well, I mean, obviously we&rsquo;re biased.</p>
<p>But yeah, we&rsquo;re in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p>The best.</p>
<p>OK, we just took a little break.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>Let me ask you one thing that a bunch of people are curious about.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the innovators.</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re one of the great innovators and philosophers and thinkers in Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also one of the innovators in terms of leg locks and the 50 50 position.</p>
<p>And just like the fact that legs have something to do in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>The other popularizer innovator in the space is John Donoher and his whole group of guys.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts about their whole system of leg locks and their ideas about Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>and so on?</p>
<p>Sure, I guess, you know, obviously, you know, John and the students at HENZO have been able</p>
<p>to do fantastic things competitively in the past number of years.</p>
<p>And, you know, you mentioned innovators in the in that kind of, you know, section of</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>I would be I&rsquo;d love to bring up some guys like Dean Lister, of course, Masakazu Imanari.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of what was going on in like nineties Japan, like combat submission wrestling,</p>
<p>there was some crazy gnarly stuff that it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s on grainy VHS tape, but like stuff</p>
<p>that if people were doing now, they go, oh, my God, that&rsquo;s brand new.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s been I think these are things that have been around for a while</p>
<p>in various places.</p>
<p>I first learned the 50 50 position, just like the leg entanglement of it from Brandon Vera,</p>
<p>actually, at a seminar at Lord Irwin&rsquo;s Martial Arts thing in 2005.</p>
<p>He learned it from Dean Lister, who used it to submit Alexandria Kakareko, really, really</p>
<p>tough Nogi guy at ADCC on there in the run that Dean made to the to the gold medal in</p>
<p>the absolute division, which was a great performance at the time.</p>
<p>First American to do that.</p>
<p>And, you know, and I actually saw a video.</p>
<p>I mean, first, a boss rootin actually broke.</p>
<p>I think Guy Mezger&rsquo;s foot with a 50 50 heel hook that he actually grabbed his heel and</p>
<p>his and his toes went and in pancreases back when they had like the man panties in the</p>
<p>high, high boots on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that was gnarly.</p>
<p>Boss rootin is underappreciated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like he double grab like and oh, yeah, like, you know, his leverage is</p>
<p>leverage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s like a toehold that, you know, that goes the other way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like it either doesn&rsquo;t work or breaks in half.</p>
<p>And well, he&rsquo;s is people don&rsquo;t often think of boss rootin as an innovator, but he is</p>
<p>in a way like he, you know, talk about like Elon Musk and first principles thinking in</p>
<p>terms of physics.</p>
<p>He like just feels like he just gets the job.</p>
<p>He figures out like the simplest way to get the job done of breaking things and establishing</p>
<p>control and hurting people.</p>
<p>Remember that was back in the day boss.</p>
<p>If you listen to boss rootin do any like commentary for any of the the big MMA shows or any MMA</p>
<p>show way back when anytime guys were clinches like the guys roll for a knee bar.</p>
<p>He was saying that way back when and now people are doing it all the time with varying degrees</p>
<p>of success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s also tough to be, I think, like a breakaway thinker.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, group think is a real thing and group inertia.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s neat to see, you know, particularly at a time when maybe that type of stuff was</p>
<p>less accepted.</p>
<p>You know, someone going, hey, I&rsquo;m going to I&rsquo;m going to run off in this other direction.</p>
<p>I think, you know, whoever, you know, the inventor of electricity in my mind is a lot</p>
<p>more impressive than whomever not to say that the person down the line isn&rsquo;t impressive</p>
<p>that comes up with an interesting way to use it.</p>
<p>Both are cool.</p>
<p>But when you think about just can you imagine we&rsquo;re sitting here like, yeah, people, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to build an airplane.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s not going to be as good as the airplane down the line, the iterative</p>
<p>things that happen later on.</p>
<p>But just being able to go to dream something into existence that you haven&rsquo;t seen before</p>
<p>and then make it happen, like takes an unbelievable like strength of character, almost like a</p>
<p>force of will, because you have you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re blazing a trail that hasn&rsquo;t been washed away</p>
<p>walked before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the BJ Penn factor in, you know, winning the Jiu Jitsu World Championship.</p>
<p>First non Brazilian to do that was back in 2001.</p>
<p>And then Rafael Lovato later on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s you know, both of those guys are so unbelievably impressive in my mind</p>
<p>for the same reason, you know, because they were out there winning at a time when that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t a common thing.</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s easy to win now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s not a psychological hurdle that needs to be left.</p>
<p>I remember, you know, when I was early in Jiu Jitsu, like Americans weren&rsquo;t winning</p>
<p>the world championships at any belt.</p>
<p>I mean, BJ, we all knew BJ Penn because BJ Penn did it.</p>
<p>But it was really, really uncommon.</p>
<p>Now it happens, you know, on a semi regular basis.</p>
<p>Of course, the Brazilians are so strong.</p>
<p>Europeans are still strong.</p>
<p>But in Australians are coming on as well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely kind of an interesting thing.</p>
<p>So to come back to, you know, John Danaher and the Henzo team, obviously, they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>fantastic things.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s had some really, really great innovation there.</p>
<p>And the systematization and the methodology that they&rsquo;re using is great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s neat to see that it&rsquo;s getting out there.</p>
<p>I would just also want, I would encourage people to make sure that they&rsquo;re catching</p>
<p>up on their history because obviously, you know, John&rsquo;s a brilliant instructor and has</p>
<p>done things for the sport that are fantastic that haven&rsquo;t been done before.</p>
<p>But, you know, none of us exist in a vacuum.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned things from everywhere else.</p>
<p>So, you know, John would say the same, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>And, you know, Dean Lister would say the same.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just neat when you can kind of trace the history of all of this happening because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had, humanity&rsquo;s had two arms and two legs for some time, at least as long as I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been alive.</p>
<p>But you mentioned, like, airplanes.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s something totally new to be invented in Jiu Jitsu still?</p>
<p>Not totally new, but like the, you know, flying isn&rsquo;t new, but airplanes nevertheless made</p>
<p>that much more efficient.</p>
<p>Is there, like, new ideas to be discovered in Jiu Jitsu still?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, the reason I&rsquo;d say yes is the same reason I would say I believe in alchemy, even</p>
<p>though I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some backing for this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know, I guess I talk about this with a buddy of mine a lot, like, and facilitative</p>
<p>versus not facilitative beliefs.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t believe something is possible and I do no investigation towards it, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never find something even if it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s no different than me walking up on a group of people and going</p>
<p>like, oh, man, look at these jerks.</p>
<p>This is going to suck versus me going, oh, I wonder what these guys are up to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to have two very different conversations, even though the players in the game are no</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>My internal constitution has changed because of how I&rsquo;ve decided to approach the situation.</p>
<p>So, although I wouldn&rsquo;t personally want to spend all my time trying to turn lead into</p>
<p>gold because I don&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s likely to work, only a person who&rsquo;s willing to spend</p>
<p>his or her life in that pursuit will actually get to the bottom of that.</p>
<p>And also, in the pursuit of that, they&rsquo;re likely to find other things.</p>
<p>So, I think a lot of times the idea is that humanity is pushed forward by, you know, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another Orson Scott Card one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, human beings are in this slog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s paraphrasing, just in this slog over time.</p>
<p>And then periodically, humanity gives birth to genius, like someone that invents the wheel,</p>
<p>invents electricity, pushes us forward, you know, comes up with the idea of governance</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t, you know, just start and end with the point of a sword, you know.</p>
<p>And, you know, these aren&rsquo;t common things.</p>
<p>These are unbelievable advancements that, you know, just me sitting here, I didn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>up with them, but I just get the benefit of it.</p>
<p>So, I guess what I would say is a lot of times these ideas are called crazy, you know, like</p>
<p>as we discussed kind of offline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, Einstein was brilliant in his 20s and he was brilliant before that,</p>
<p>I would suspect, but basically, you know, gets recognized later on in life.</p>
<p>And of course, we all thought those were great ideas.</p>
<p>The man was probably roundly mocked for giant chunks of his life.</p>
<p>And I guess, so it&rsquo;s neat to, I would say there&rsquo;s definitely in my mind things that</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just combinations and new to me, new ways to see things, new ways to understand</p>
<p>different depth of understanding, possibly new things, new positions, new ideas, because</p>
<p>even if that&rsquo;s not true, the process of going through and acting as if it is and believing</p>
<p>like that and focusing and trying to investigate will make any of us, will push us all forward.</p>
<p>Whereas sitting there, you know, obsessing over the cult of our current knowledge, I</p>
<p>think is the biggest, the biggest danger and the biggest cause of stagnation that exists</p>
<p>anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it starts with believing the impossible, which is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s really inspiring to me is to see people out there, which sadly</p>
<p>are rare, who kind of have a combination of two things.</p>
<p>One is they have a worldview that involves, that includes a lot of ideas that are crazy.</p>
<p>And the second part is they&rsquo;re exceptionally focused and competent in bringing that,</p>
<p>whatever the ideas in that worldview to reality.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of people with crazy ideas.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>They have way out there beliefs about things, but they&rsquo;re not doing much to like make the,</p>
<p>like build stuff grounded.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not engineers or whatever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like espousing different crazy ideas.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why you get like the Elon Musk type characters.</p>
<p>And the reason I bring him up a lot is because like, there&rsquo;s not many others to bring up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s not many examples of it through history.</p>
<p>The people, I mean, the guy&rsquo;s convinced that we&rsquo;re going to colonize Mars.</p>
<p>And basically everybody on earth thinks that&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>Everyone except the guy that&rsquo;s going to do it, right?</p>
<p>Except that&rsquo;s going to do it.</p>
<p>And like, you can imagine like a couple of hundred years from now, people will,</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, they won&rsquo;t, certainly won&rsquo;t remember the haters.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t remember all the people.</p>
<p>If they do remember them, they&rsquo;ll remember them in a sense like people were silly to</p>
<p>think that this isn&rsquo;t the obvious path forward.</p>
<p>Like from a perspective, that&rsquo;s what Elon talks about.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s obvious that we&rsquo;re going to expand throughout the universe.</p>
<p>Like, so.</p>
<p>From his perspective.</p>
<p>Like, but to me it is also obvious because like either we destroy ourselves or we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>expand beyond earth.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s not many, well, maybe it&rsquo;s not completely obvious.</p>
<p>I guess I share that worldview.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the other possibility that we humans find a sort of an inner peace where the forces</p>
<p>of capitalism will calm down and we&rsquo;ll all just meditate and do yoga and Jiu Jitsu and</p>
<p>like relax with this whole tech thing where we keep building new technologies.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s cool to have those kinds of people that just believe the big ambitious, crazy</p>
<p>dreams because that&rsquo;s where it starts.</p>
<p>If you want to build something, you have to first believe that when you also have to believe</p>
<p>strongly enough that you&rsquo;re not vulnerable and I&rsquo;m speculating, but it&rsquo;s like, I can</p>
<p>only imagine how many people have told Elon that what he&rsquo;s doing is crazy.</p>
<p>So not only did he dream it up, he dreamed it up, went with it and also went with it</p>
<p>in the face of being told that it&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>And then anytime, and then also stepped away from the bitterness because he&rsquo;s done a</p>
<p>series of really crazy, impressive things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s only those little things that I&rsquo;m aware of, but, and also staying away from</p>
<p>the bitterness of every single time you did something good.</p>
<p>Initially, all I do is talk down about you.</p>
<p>And then eventually I act as, of course, of course, I never apologize.</p>
<p>And yet you don&rsquo;t let that dampen your spirits for the next innovation, which is pretty incredible</p>
<p>to me to watch.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s contagious to spend time with the guy because he&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s, Rogan has</p>
<p>the same look to him, which is interesting about these people is like, there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>hater shield that he&rsquo;s like, he doesn&rsquo;t even like sense them.</p>
<p>It feels like, like it doesn&rsquo;t, he thinks to Elon it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>I mean, he keeps calling it like first principles thinking, like physics says it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Therefore it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s convinced himself that like his beliefs are grounded in the fundamental fabric</p>
<p>of the way the universe works.</p>
<p>Therefore the haters don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of like a system of thought.</p>
<p>He developed himself through all the difficulties, through all the doubt.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s able to take huge risks with basically putting everything he owes on the line multiple</p>
<p>times throughout his life.</p>
<p>Amidst all the drama, amidst all the doubts, amidst all like the, he&rsquo;s still able to make</p>
<p>just clear, clearheaded decisions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it, but it&rsquo;s inspiring as hell.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I think like, I can only imagine, you know, history will look back on him as a brilliant</p>
<p>person, but that&rsquo;s not the only, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of maybe not numeric, not statistically</p>
<p>speaking, but a lot numerically on a giant planet of, you know, billions of people, a</p>
<p>lot of brilliant people.</p>
<p>Well, you know, time, place, luck, fortune, all that other stuff.</p>
<p>But at the same time, that clearly isn&rsquo;t the only determining thing in making Elon Musk,</p>
<p>Elon Musk.</p>
<p>And obviously I don&rsquo;t know the guy from Adam and, but it&rsquo;s an interesting thing that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just his intellect, his belief system, his structure, how he&rsquo;s viewing the world.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, did he, did he reason his way to that?</p>
<p>Did he not?</p>
<p>What other factors came in?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really curious about that because I guess coming, it&rsquo;s, again, I feel really strongly</p>
<p>about people&rsquo;s belief structure and, and this, the, how they view the world being more important</p>
<p>than the engine behind it.</p>
<p>You know, it makes someone resilient or not.</p>
<p>It makes someone positive or not because you could have 10,000.</p>
<p>I think about this for competitive stuff, you could have 10,000 things going properly</p>
<p>and one thing going improperly.</p>
<p>If you focus on the improper, you&rsquo;ll probably fix it at a certain point, which is good,</p>
<p>facilitated for development in the longterm.</p>
<p>But if you had to go and try to perform a task in the next five minutes and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>focusing on the negative, your confidence and your, your, your belief in the positive</p>
<p>outcome of the future is likely to be damaged.</p>
<p>Whereas you could have 25 things going wrong, but you go, man, I sure am happy to be alive.</p>
<p>How fortunate I am.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, this is, I have problems to solve.</p>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<p>Versus I had to list the problems and I start bitching about them.</p>
<p>Both of them are technically accurate, but it&rsquo;s, I guess, different lenses.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a really neat thing to see, you know, someone, you know, exemplifying</p>
<p>that for us.</p>
<p>So maybe to look at the, the fighting world, there&rsquo;s a million questions I can ask here.</p>
<p>Like one, you mentioned BJ Penn, you, uh, first of all, you&rsquo;re undefeated in the UFC</p>
<p>and one of the fights you&rsquo;ve had is against BJ Penn, which is, uh, kind of an incredible</p>
<p>fight.</p>
<p>You, you won performance of the night.</p>
<p>What did it feel like to, uh, to face BJ Penn and to beat him definitively as you did?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s that whole experience like?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I didn&rsquo;t know if I was going to ever be able to fight again after beating</p>
<p>Gray Maynard in 2016. Um, you know, I&rsquo;ve had a couple of periods of those.</p>
<p>I was about to join the army actually in, uh, when I was 30 before the, uh, for the</p>
<p>UFC before Jen sent me over to ultimate fighter.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to go cause I was like, one, they&rsquo;re never going to pick me.</p>
<p>Two, I&rsquo;d be terrible for TV.</p>
<p>Three, I&rsquo;ll probably say something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get burned to death in the streets.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m like, this isn&rsquo;t a great idea.</p>
<p>And then, uh, she said, we&rsquo;ll go out there, see what happens, do it anyway.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be, you&rsquo;ll regret it if you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then I ended up doing ultimate fighter.</p>
<p>And then, so I fought three times on the show and then I fought, um, for the, for the finale.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s four times in like five or six months, which was great.</p>
<p>And then it took me a year to get another opponent.</p>
<p>Um, and that was Gray Maynard.</p>
<p>And then Gray was obviously very tough guy, um, managed to get a good outcome there.</p>
<p>Then it took two years to fight BJ Penn.</p>
<p>And that was, you know, obviously I&rsquo;m training all the time every single day and that never</p>
<p>stops, but that was, I&rsquo;ll be honest, like pretty deeply frustrating.</p>
<p>Cause you know, as a, as a human being, as an athlete, you know, I think as an athlete,</p>
<p>you die twice.</p>
<p>Like you have an athletic peak or area and then, then you go on with the rest of your</p>
<p>life, but it is a microcosm for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re seeing this, the sand tick away in the hourglass would drop</p>
<p>away and you&rsquo;re going, man, this is, these are the years between 31, 32, 33.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll be at my best at this time.</p>
<p>My absolute best physically now, not technically I&rsquo;m a lot better now than I was before.</p>
<p>And I plan, but at a certain point you will, unless you&rsquo;re Bernard Hopkins, you will reach</p>
<p>diminishing returns and I guess the long, the long way you can feel the clock ticking</p>
<p>is frustrating.</p>
<p>Why, why did it take two years for BJ?</p>
<p>I, I, I, that&rsquo;s the question people ask a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why does nobody want to fight Ryan?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I probably, they probably think they&rsquo;ll get infected by whatever this is, but I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame them.</p>
<p>But I would mean you&rsquo;re a really tough opponent as bought as the bottom line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that I&rsquo;m different.</p>
<p>Maybe they perceive that the, the, the, the threat is greater than the reward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that now that we&rsquo;re ranked number 12, you know, in the UFC rankings that, that,</p>
<p>that will change.</p>
<p>And I know that if we&rsquo;re one more win and then we&rsquo;re in the top 10 that, you know, now,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve consistently found is that like randoms want to fight and I&rsquo;m like, go away.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come here for you.</p>
<p>You know, cause if I wanted to just fight anybody, I could go down to a waffle house</p>
<p>and yell until like DMX shows up and we can, we can fight.</p>
<p>Cause he&rsquo;ll be at the waffle house too.</p>
<p>Who am I kidding?</p>
<p>I really want to hang out with the MX.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s like, you want to, when I had the opportunity, oh my God, that was</p>
<p>so cool.</p>
<p>I was, I would never, I would never fight DMX.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be on the same team.</p>
<p>But anyway it&rsquo;s, I guess I accepted fights against, I asked, they got asked about Lamas.</p>
<p>I said, yes.</p>
<p>I got asked about Dennis Bermudez.</p>
<p>I said, yes.</p>
<p>You know, like long periods of time.</p>
<p>And they, at that time, well, you know, in between 2016 and 2018 I was struggling to</p>
<p>have, have opponents who would sign up.</p>
<p>And so I haven&rsquo;t turned down fights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just said, Hey, you know, keep the, I don&rsquo;t care about fighting the randoms.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you have a successful school.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re running your martial artists broadly speaking.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to take fights that aren&rsquo;t like that fit a certain kind of trajectory</p>
<p>for your career.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when, when BJ Penn, they said, well, BJ is looking for an opponent.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m your guy.</p>
<p>And, and I think that, you know, BJ accepted that fight because I&rsquo;m another jujitsu guy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he, he, he perceived that I was much of a threat on the feet.</p>
<p>And, you know, I was able to, it was neat to get it to compete against someone, you</p>
<p>know, who&rsquo;s one of my heroes, one of the people I looked up to in MMA for the longest time.</p>
<p>Were you intimidated by that?</p>
<p>No, no, I love competing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really get nervous or scared before fights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid to get hurt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid to win.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid to lose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I, I&rsquo;m just excited for the, I feel thankful for the opportunity to compete and</p>
<p>the opportunity to, to play when it matters.</p>
<p>You know, I, I just, that&rsquo;s the only time I&rsquo;m interested in playing anymore is when</p>
<p>it, when it matters, when the opposition is, I know that, you know, it&rsquo;s funny because</p>
<p>people pick on, on a lot of some opponents, particularly after, after the fact, like if</p>
<p>you, if you get a good outcome, well then, oh, of course, let&rsquo;s beat that guy.</p>
<p>That guy wasn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, I wasn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s after the fact.</p>
<p>I get to say that.</p>
<p>And also as the person in the ring, you know, BJ Penn has heard a lot of people in mixed</p>
<p>martial arts cage and I could actually absolutely have been on that list.</p>
<p>So it was neat to get to compete against someone that I really respect, someone that I looked</p>
<p>up to for a long time, someone who has a great skillset.</p>
<p>And also I went up in weight to fight him at his weight class.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have to come down to mine, which is where he&rsquo;d take it.</p>
<p>It was lightweight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally a featherweight.</p>
<p>I walk around at like 158 pounds.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the lightweight and featherweight?</p>
<p>Lightweight is 155 with the day before Wayne and featherweight is 145 with the day before</p>
<p>Wayne.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a little bit more properly sized for featherweight.</p>
<p>But anyway, you know, I, so I didn&rsquo;t feel like obviously he was giving up a couple</p>
<p>years of age, but I was giving up size and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>And it was, you know, I was just excited to have the opportunity to step in against someone</p>
<p>like BJ and you know, we managed to get out of there with a, with a good outcome without</p>
<p>getting too banged up.</p>
<p>But just, it was cool cause we tied up on the fence and just even the second, you know,</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re rolling with somebody and you touch and you can feel what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and you go, man, this guy&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>You can feel the calm, you can feel the small minor adjustments that they&rsquo;re making, the</p>
<p>subtle things that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And that was one of those things that was really neat and gratifying because you know,</p>
<p>you never know.</p>
<p>Sometimes people that you&rsquo;ve heard of are a little bit less technically proficient than</p>
<p>you thought.</p>
<p>And other times you&rsquo;ll meet some guy that you&rsquo;re training like, who the hell is this</p>
<p>guy?</p>
<p>How have I not heard of this person?</p>
<p>And BJ was exactly, as a jiu jitsu guy, what I would have thought.</p>
<p>And another thing, that&rsquo;s another thing that bugged me about how people reacted after the</p>
<p>fight is, you know, basically going, oh, BJ screwed up this, screwed up that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, all right, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>That was, you know, one of the, and to me, I mean, as a fan of both, that was a beautiful</p>
<p>moment as a, as a kind of passing of a torch in a sense of exceptional performance.</p>
<p>Like another one that stands out to me, maybe you can comment, is I don&rsquo;t understand, well,</p>
<p>maybe I do, why Conor McGregor gets as much hate as he does.</p>
<p>He probably revels in it.</p>
<p>But I think he doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit for Jose Aldo for the, for like, for basically,</p>
<p>you know, knocking him out in the first few seconds of a fight.</p>
<p>I mean, Jose is like one of the greatest fighters ever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Maybe some people can even put him in the top 10.</p>
<p>No question.</p>
<p>And the, like, I don&rsquo;t understand why it&rsquo;s, doesn&rsquo;t get as much, like Conor McGregor</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get as much credit as I think he deserves for that and for Eddie Alvarez and all the</p>
<p>fights, for some reason, whenever Conor McGregor beats somebody, well, they were not that good</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>Like, it means like they were, they were, something was off.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s convenient, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite strange to me.</p>
<p>But I mean, what are your thoughts on the, on Conor McGregor?</p>
<p>Maybe one way to ask that, I&rsquo;m Russian, so I&rsquo;m obviously also a Khabib fan, but I&rsquo;m also</p>
<p>a Conor fan, it seems like there&rsquo;s not many of us who are, like, fans of both.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>You and Artem Lobov.</p>
<p>The two of us, which also is a good fight.</p>
<p>Tough dude.</p>
<p>Yeah, really, really tough dude.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like five languages, really interesting kid.</p>
<p>Oh, so, oh wow, I didn&rsquo;t know that side of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a brain there.</p>
<p>Well, on the Khabib versus Conor, what do you make of their first fight?</p>
<p>What do you, do you agree with me that they should fight again?</p>
<p>Because I think it would be awesome if they fought again in Moscow.</p>
<p>And do you agree with me, I&rsquo;m just going to put, say things that piss people off,</p>
<p>but I believe is that Conor actually has a chance to beat Khabib.</p>
<p>One, that Conor absolutely has a chance to beat Khabib.</p>
<p>Conor has a chance to beat anyone that he steps into that ring with, and not just like</p>
<p>a mathematical chance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, one of the billion, but like, you know, like he absolutely, it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>because I won&rsquo;t pretend to know Conor really well, but I first met Conor in 2010 when I</p>
<p>was teaching a seminar in, at Strait Blast Gym Ireland in Dublin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually where I first met all of the coaches that ended up being on Conor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>team.</p>
<p>You know, John Kavanaugh, Owen Roddy, Gunnar Nelson, you know, so for, I actually, I enjoyed</p>
<p>being on Ultimate Fighter and being on Uriah Faber&rsquo;s team and getting to train with all</p>
<p>the guys there.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the people that I was actually, I knew better were actually the</p>
<p>European side, all of Conor&rsquo;s coaches.</p>
<p>And that was a neat thing because I got to, I met Conor, I didn&rsquo;t know who Conor, like</p>
<p>Conor wasn&rsquo;t Conor at that point.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was before his UFC debut.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, well, well before, yeah.</p>
<p>I think, I think he got in like 2014, maybe something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And anyway, but he was doing well in Cage Warriors, winning the titles there.</p>
<p>I think prior to that, you know, I remember going, seeing him on the show and also then</p>
<p>getting to see him train because I competed, I was initially slated to fight David Tamer</p>
<p>for the Ultimate Fighter finale before getting put in to fight Artem for the title for the</p>
<p>show.</p>
<p>So I went over to Ireland to train for a couple of days and basically it was neat to watch</p>
<p>him, watch him work.</p>
<p>I mean, man is focused and trains a lot and very, very smart and very, very hardworking.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of times people get stuck in the, in this, you know, and they almost</p>
<p>want to believe that this was lucky or this, this person, you know, like they&rsquo;re not working</p>
<p>that hard.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just out there.</p>
<p>They got there with their mouth and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s just not the case.</p>
<p>And you know, I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like, you know, obviously Connors very well off</p>
<p>right now and I don&rsquo;t know how hard, how seriously he&rsquo;s training, what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to any of that, but there&rsquo;s no question that he has skills to be dangerous.</p>
<p>And one of the funny things, obviously the Khabib fight when Khabib was a great fighter</p>
<p>and also has the chance to beat anyone in that ring at any given time.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, there was a Conner, you know, it&rsquo;s a one that he can, he can put anybody</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned, I think that he doesn&rsquo;t get the credit for the Eddie Alvarez fight.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t get the credit for the Jose Aldo fight.</p>
<p>Cause it was almost so much of a letdown.</p>
<p>I remember that happened the same weekend that I did the ultimate fighter finale.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, all right, wait, what?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It almost doesn&rsquo;t feel like a fight happening, but we mentioned Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p>I mean, Musashi was famous for the way he poked and prodded that people with what he</p>
<p>was doing, whether overtly or not, it&rsquo;s like, Oh, we&rsquo;re supposed to fight to the death.</p>
<p>And, uh, you know, at 3 PM tomorrow, great.</p>
<p>4 PM rolls around, I&rsquo;m just not there.</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>I mean, you remember all the, all the antics and nonsense that Conner was pulling prior</p>
<p>to that, like speaking personally, that&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not something I would feel comfortable</p>
<p>doing, but it&rsquo;s like, everyone&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And the effect that it had on, on Jose was, I mean, beyond evident.</p>
<p>When was the last time Jose started the, started the fight with leaping left hand,</p>
<p>leaping right hand, you&rsquo;re like, wait, what?</p>
<p>And then he was obviously, you know, living rent free and in Jose&rsquo;s head at that point.</p>
<p>And that was a combination of psychological, you know, ability and, and, and wherewithal</p>
<p>and then physical.</p>
<p>And it reminded me of the way Muhammad Ali would, would bother people and whatnot.</p>
<p>And, uh, the fact that he&rsquo;s a polarizing figure, um, I think makes some people not give him</p>
<p>his due.</p>
<p>And then at the same time, sometimes certain fans may be go overboard, but, uh, they remember</p>
<p>the knee that Ben Askren got knocked out with by Masoudal.</p>
<p>I mean, that was an amazing, unbelievable thing, but three inches to the right, three</p>
<p>inches to the left, I guess, whichever side his head wasn&rsquo;t, could have been squarer.</p>
<p>But, uh, and that fight starts with Ben Askren on top of you in the first five seconds.</p>
<p>Well, Connor ran and threw a knee just like that at Khabib and Khabib got right around</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>That could have easily gone the other way.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what would have happened if after the, after coming back from boxing,</p>
<p>um, after coming back from, from the Mayweather fight, Connor, in the first 10 seconds, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Khabib in the first 10 seconds, it&rsquo;s over and you&rsquo;re like, he would, it would have been</p>
<p>intolerable, but basically, like, you know, but see, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Let me actually push back slightly.</p>
<p>Uh, I mean, to the fans, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but Connor seems to cause I&rsquo;ve competed</p>
<p>a lot and like there&rsquo;s a tension.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a negativity sometimes depending on the opponent and there&rsquo;s a respect afterwards</p>
<p>that happens, like when you understand that there&rsquo;s a deep like respect and almost like</p>
<p>love for each other.</p>
<p>Like, I always seen that in Connor, like all the trash talk afterwards.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a subtle thing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t always see it, but there&rsquo;s a respect like.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And like that, I almost on the Khabib side, I almost feel like Khabib really took it personally.</p>
<p>He did, he didn&rsquo;t, he lost the respect for Connor.</p>
<p>I thought, I thought the whole time Connor had the respect.</p>
<p>So I, I, what I wanted to say is like, if Connor won that fight, like rock Khabib, I</p>
<p>could see like, I wouldn&rsquo;t see trash talking.</p>
<p>I could see like trash talking stop right there.</p>
<p>I think so too, but at the same time, I&rsquo;m sure you recall like Connor, Connor crossing</p>
<p>some pretty personal territory, you know, both religiously and, and also familiarly</p>
<p>with, uh, with Khabib.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Like you have to know the diff so obviously I know the, the, the Khabib, uh, the Dagestani</p>
<p>people, they don&rsquo;t play around like that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t play around like that.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, they take offense to basically, I mean, you, you don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So, uh, so like Connor didn&rsquo;t, maybe he did it on purpose or maybe he wasn&rsquo;t even just</p>
<p>aware of, of, uh, it was cultural differences of the box he opened.</p>
<p>Like you, you can talk to Floyd Mayweather, you can, you can go anywhere with him.</p>
<p>You can, you can say the most offensive things, but with, uh, with Khabib, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, yeah,</p>
<p>hard lines, but you, uh, I mean, a lot of people ask, I know you&rsquo;re a featherweight,</p>
<p>but if you were to, uh, face, it feels like Khabib was one of the hardest puzzles to solve</p>
<p>in, in all of mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>If you were to face Khabib, do you think, how would you go about solving that puzzle?</p>
<p>Like almost the question is almost from a Jiu Jitsu perspective too.</p>
<p>What do you do with a guy that&rsquo;s exceptionally good at controlling position, especially on</p>
<p>top, very good at wrestling and taking down and controlling position.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s say, so forget maybe striking on the ground.</p>
<p>How do you solve that guy?</p>
<p>Like what do you do with your guard if you get taken down or do you create an entire</p>
<p>system of not getting taken down or escaping is like, what, what ideas do you have for</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>Well, I guess I would say in my mind, fighting is a game of trading energy.</p>
<p>Um, kind of, uh, you know, there&rsquo;s two, there&rsquo;s two things, there&rsquo;s damage and there&rsquo;s energy.</p>
<p>So like when I say energy and being like, uh, tired, not tired, how much, how much gas</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>Um, and then damage counts obviously as well.</p>
<p>Um, you could be feeling, I could be feeling great and then you get to kick me in the head</p>
<p>hard, really hard three times.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I could get up and run a mile.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get up.</p>
<p>So anyway, um, you know, I, I think what Khabib does is so well is he makes the fight look</p>
<p>like it could be an amalgamated fight.</p>
<p>Um, he does a great job of avoiding damage on the feet for the most part and really sucking</p>
<p>the life out of people with how suffocating and oppressive is his control is.</p>
<p>Um, his chain wrestling is as good as anyone we&rsquo;ve ever seen in the UFC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, that poses a really serious threat for people that need to maintain a certain</p>
<p>amount of space and try to hurt them on the feed because unless they&rsquo;re able to inflict</p>
<p>an adequate amount of damage, they&rsquo;re going to each time, let&rsquo;s say for instance, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say him taking them down as a foregone conclusion at some point.</p>
<p>Um, if every single time Khabib takes you down, you get right back up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that big a deal, um, because it&rsquo;s actually more, we&rsquo;ve all experienced this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you and I are rolling, you tap me 15 times in one round.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s more tired?</p>
<p>Probably you are.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My ass so badly that, that it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re the only one working, but, um,</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re comfortable with the up and down of it, like being taken down.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, if you don&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t get hurt badly or tired on the bottom, you have</p>
<p>a chance, but that doesn&rsquo;t involve just cracking him on the feet before he gets ahold of you.</p>
<p>Um,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot to ask.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s difficult to do.</p>
<p>It seemed actually like Connor, it seemed like it when he was being kind of taken down</p>
<p>or the, the take down attempts against Khabib, he seemed to be somewhat relaxed the whole</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>I thought he was doing well, actually.</p>
<p>I think that particularly for the first round, I thought he did a very good job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of those things that I think like, uh, Khabib being the fights taking place</p>
<p>in Khabib&rsquo;s world in large part.</p>
<p>And I mean, set aside that one giant, uh, was it right hand that, that Khabib hit Connor</p>
<p>with it, by the way, Connor reacted like an absolute champion.</p>
<p>He got crushed by that overhand and then drop and his eyes went right back on Khabib.</p>
<p>It was immediate positive, great response.</p>
<p>So even though that was, I think that was a bit of a surprising thing, Connor reacted</p>
<p>really, really well.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to be on bottom with Khabib for four rounds, that&rsquo;s going to be tough.</p>
<p>And also Connor&rsquo;s a way better grappler than people like to give him credit for, but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the type of grappler that can do that can, that can, that&rsquo;s too tall of an order,</p>
<p>but there are grapplers that could do that or at least would have a much, much better</p>
<p>shot at, uh, being able to weather that type of a storm.</p>
<p>Do you see yourself being able to be relaxed through that kind of storm?</p>
<p>Well, I guess I can remember being, being, being, being savagely beaten is very relaxing.</p>
<p>The time that the timing of that answer was like, okay, that&rsquo;s a dumb question.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s ultimately the goal of Jiu Jitsu is to, um, be relaxed to the fire.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And remember like every UFC fighter, I win all hypothetical matchups.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Uh, since, uh, I&rsquo;m one to ask ridiculous questions and we&rsquo;ve been talking about sci fi and all</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Let me ask the kind of big question that everybody disagrees about, certainly with me is, uh,</p>
<p>who are the top five greatest MMA fighters of all time and, um, um, why is Fedor number</p>
<p>one?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, first off, Fedor is number one.</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Right there with you.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Talk about people that just get completely underappreciated.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never been in the, uh, like he&rsquo;s never succeeded in the UFC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not his fault.</p>
<p>It came along after him at the time that, at the time that Fedor was at his height,</p>
<p>the UFC was not where it was at for heavyweight fighting.</p>
<p>I mean, not that there weren&rsquo;t good heavyweights there, but Fedor, Fedor was unbelievable.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You remember, I mean, Minotaur Noguera, I was a massive fan of him.</p>
<p>I still remember watching, uh, what is it pride 2004 when, when Noguera fought Cro Cop</p>
<p>and got blasted with that left kick and dropped with like seconds left in the first round.</p>
<p>Pride was great cause he had a 10 minute first round and that five minute second, which again</p>
<p>materially alters, alters the fight big time.</p>
<p>And you know, just the texture of the fight is just totally, it&rsquo;s borderline a different</p>
<p>sport, you know, then, then getting a five, a pause and a five.</p>
<p>But anyway, uh, similar sports, like one of those swimming things where they have nine</p>
<p>gold medals for different types of swimming, right?</p>
<p>But still swimming.</p>
<p>But anyway, um,</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>They would disagree.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean, I&rsquo;m not trying to.</p>
<p>They specialize in that.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s totally true.</p>
<p>10, 10 minutes is different than five minutes.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t drown me swimmers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t swim very well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for me to, easy for me to downplay it, but anyway, um, uh, yeah.</p>
<p>And then no,</p>
<p>Better than, uh, John Jones, like the modern era.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s tough to compete, to compare across eras.</p>
<p>It would be like going and saying like, Oh man, how, how would such and such great grappler</p>
<p>from today fare against someone from 1995?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, probably pretty well for them, depending upon who they are, what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people that would, their skill sets might transition across eras, but a lot</p>
<p>of times not, but that&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>We get the, they&rsquo;ll be like comparing Spartans to modern day, you know, like army guys.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, well, who&rsquo;s going to win?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, did modern day army guys get modern day weapons?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but who&rsquo;s the toughest ruggedest group of people at the very least?</p>
<p>So I guess it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s tough to say, but at least in my mind, the people that I think</p>
<p>about for great fighters, their, their, their quality of opposition, um, their level of</p>
<p>like lasting and like success, their level of lasting innovation.</p>
<p>Like the courage that they have to demonstrate, because again, it&rsquo;s like being a big fish</p>
<p>in a small pond takes no courage.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s nothing there, but it just requires something a little bit different.</p>
<p>So Kazushi Sakuraba is one of my guys too.</p>
<p>Um, BJ Penn also, I mean, BJ Penn fought Lyoto Machida.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, that was a time, it was a different sport.</p>
<p>It was a different time in the sport where, you know, they were, some guys were, were</p>
<p>bouncing around doing different things, but let&rsquo;s, so I guess the Gracie family, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, they never had an in like, obviously Hoist was there, um, but they never, and that</p>
<p>was a definitely a different sport.</p>
<p>Weight classes being open, things like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you have to say that Hoist is up there.</p>
<p>Oh, no question.</p>
<p>One of the greatest ever.</p>
<p>I think so too.</p>
<p>And again, I wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here talking to you, um, if it weren&rsquo;t for him.</p>
<p>So the Gracie family as a whole, but I mean, who&rsquo;s the better, I mean, I think Hoist would</p>
<p>tell you himself probably that, that Hickson would have handled business back then, but</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t put him in.</p>
<p>So again, he&rsquo;s the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter that we saw</p>
<p>do his business.</p>
<p>So Hoist up there for sure.</p>
<p>What about, so this is like, nobody seems to agree with me on this, but like this connects</p>
<p>to soccer again and Messi.</p>
<p>It seems that people value like how long you&rsquo;ve been a champion, how many like defenses of</p>
<p>the championship that you&rsquo;ve had successfully.</p>
<p>To me, I highly value singular moments of genius.</p>
<p>So like, like, I, I don&rsquo;t, like, if you look at Conor McGregor, he hasn&rsquo;t, I guess, held,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a champion very long, very much.</p>
<p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t defend either title, right?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t defend any other, uh, either of the titles, but like, if you talk, and same</p>
<p>with Messi, if you look at, uh, Lionel Messi, there&rsquo;s just moments of brilliance unlike</p>
<p>any other in history for both Conor and Messi.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t seem to give credits like, well, how many world cups have you won?</p>
<p>But to me, like, why is it about this arbitrary world cup thing or championship thing?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier for people to wrap their head around, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the NFL combine.</p>
<p>When was, I mean, yeah, numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that, well, again, if I go and if I pick Tom Brady in the first round,</p>
<p>you know, and it works out, they call me a genius.</p>
<p>If I had to pick Tom Brady in the first round after his combine and it doesn&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>I get fired and I&rsquo;m never hired again, I have to work, work somewhere else.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m insulating myself from criticism.</p>
<p>I think almost if I go by the numbers, well, he had more bench presses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how, how many times have the guys that are like the super studs in the, uh,</p>
<p>in the NFL combine ever been on the greatest players in the NFL history, in NFL history,</p>
<p>like zero or close to zero.</p>
<p>And even if, even if there&rsquo;s some, it&rsquo;s certainly not a one to one correlation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so funny though.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just like, how many, how long, how many days did he hold the title?</p>
<p>Oh, your title reign was X times longer.</p>
<p>That means nothing.</p>
<p>So if we wanted to find greatest fighter ever, like you said, I think individual moments</p>
<p>of like, like that was transcended, that was different.</p>
<p>That was something else because people can win or lose for any number of different reasons.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t blame Argentina, not winning the world cup on messy, you know, that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fair.</p>
<p>You know, how many times has, you know, I mean, I use the, I remember when a Trent</p>
<p>Ilfer was the quarterback for the, uh, the Baltimore Ravens and they had such a strong</p>
<p>defense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to pick on Trent Ilfer, but it&rsquo;s like they, they had such a strong defense</p>
<p>that they were to make it.</p>
<p>That was the Ray Lewis, you know, Chris McAllister era, you know, and they, they won, they won</p>
<p>the super bowl.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone is going to say that, you know, Trent Dilfer is a better quarterback</p>
<p>than, you know, or put him in the same category as Dan Marino, but he got the W he&rsquo;s got the,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got the super ring.</p>
<p>How many times, let&rsquo;s use March Madness or super, I love it.</p>
<p>Like that, that guy always makes the finals, but he just never gets it done.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight, getting to the finals nine times doesn&rsquo;t count because you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t win the end game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it wouldn&rsquo;t be better, but that guy won the game once he got over the</p>
<p>hump.</p>
<p>Well, how many other times was he in the finals?</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting what we, yeah.</p>
<p>We were obsessed with these numbers, like, um, well, cause we can&rsquo;t assess their method,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Well, I think most of the time, most of us can&rsquo;t assess the method of anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s like, Oh, look at that guy do X Y swimming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how do I know Michael Phelps is great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It was faster.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t look at his technique and say anything other than, well, that&rsquo;s way better than anything</p>
<p>I know how to do, but I can&rsquo;t say the difference between him and the next guy.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s, I wonder if it&rsquo;s like, I need a concrete identifier and a lot of</p>
<p>times people don&rsquo;t like saying, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And most people won&rsquo;t put like a Ronda Rousey in the top, even 20 or 50 of, but like she</p>
<p>changed more than, more than almost anybody else.</p>
<p>She changed the martial arts history.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that even, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m exaggerating that she, she made it okay for</p>
<p>women to be fighters and that, and that changed the way we see like, she&rsquo;s one of the great</p>
<p>feminists of our time in a weird kind of way that like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just a Ronda Rousey fan, but the, yeah, the, but she&rsquo;s not in the conversation</p>
<p>because then you start converting into numbers.</p>
<p>Well, how many did she win?</p>
<p>Is she among the greatest fighters or did she do the greatest things?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think it&rsquo;s something, I mean, obviously Ronda is a great Sudoku who was competing</p>
<p>in MMA at a time when a lot of the girls like, where did you get your skills in the Olympics</p>
<p>or where&rsquo;d you get yours?</p>
<p>High school.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re going to, the Olympic girls going to beat you up.</p>
<p>But I guess that, that doesn&rsquo;t diminish her, just that accomplishment is what it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to, I don&rsquo;t, Fedor is not diminished by the fact that he would like, if he were</p>
<p>to fight Stephen Mayochis right now, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t go great or that John Jones exists.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t now have to like knock Fedor&rsquo;s accomplishments down or say, oh, because BJ Penn or so and</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say has a mixed record at this point that somehow invalidates the things that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done before.</p>
<p>I guess it kind of brings us back to a lot of the other people we&rsquo;ve talked about, the</p>
<p>fact that the brilliant people throughout history that we love or some of the monsters</p>
<p>throughout history that we rightly revile in a lot of cases were complicated people</p>
<p>and their legacy is more than just one thing.</p>
<p>And someone doing something amazing doesn&rsquo;t invalid, doesn&rsquo;t mean they didn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>bad.</p>
<p>And someone doing terrible things doesn&rsquo;t, doesn&rsquo;t mean that, doesn&rsquo;t invalidate the,</p>
<p>the positives that they did.</p>
<p>But I guess we fighting the urge to put people in one category and same with ourselves.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why people get depressed.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m good right now.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m bad right now.</p>
<p>Versus hey, we&rsquo;re all at work in progress and we&rsquo;re trying to do X number of things</p>
<p>and legacy is a tough thing to figure out anyway.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all speculative.</p>
<p>Last time or no on Reddit, you said that last time too, that you don&rsquo;t experience much fear</p>
<p>before fights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask you a couple of Mike Tyson things, if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting to me.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just weird.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen this clip of Tyson talking about how he feels</p>
<p>leading up to a fight that he&rsquo;s kind of overtaken with fear, but as he gets closer and closer</p>
<p>and closer to the ring, his confidence grows.</p>
<p>Have you seen the clip?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen it in a while.</p>
<p>Here, let me play it for you.</p>
<p>I think George St. Pierre said something similar to me one time.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m in the dressing room, five minutes before I come out, my gloves are laced up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m breaking my gloves down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pushing the lever on the back of my leg, breaking the middle of the glove so my knuckle</p>
<p>pierced through the lever.</p>
<p>I feel my knuckle piercing against the tight leather gloves on the Everlast box.</p>
<p>When I come out, I have supreme confidence, but I&rsquo;m scared to death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally afraid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of losing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of being humiliated, but I&rsquo;m just totally confident.</p>
<p>The closer I get to the ring, the more confidence I get.</p>
<p>The closer, the more confidence I get.</p>
<p>All during my training, I&rsquo;ve been afraid of this man.</p>
<p>I thought this man might be capable of beating me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dreamed of him beating me, but I always stayed afraid of him.</p>
<p>But the closer I get to the ring, I&rsquo;m more confident.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;m in the ring, I&rsquo;m a god.</p>
<p>No one can beat me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a god.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, he&rsquo;s cognizant of both his demons and whatever the hell ideas he</p>
<p>has about violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Is there something about the tension that he&rsquo;s describing about being confident and</p>
<p>scared that resonates with you?</p>
<p>Or do you hold to this idea that you&rsquo;ve kind of spoken about before that you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>not afraid?</p>
<p>No, I can appreciate what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>I think that I can speak to feeling concerned about, let&rsquo;s say, for instance, if you feel</p>
<p>a certain way, I think people are a lot more like computers than we like to admit.</p>
<p>And just because a lot of times I can&rsquo;t parse what&rsquo;s going on and why doesn&rsquo;t mean that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>And I think that, at least in the times, if I&rsquo;m concerned about a situation or about a</p>
<p>person or about something happening prior to the fight, I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s a reason.</p>
<p>There was a reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to push that down and bury it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>What have I not thought about?</p>
<p>What have I not done?</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p>Why am I feeling this way?</p>
<p>As you mentioned, for yourself prior, you&rsquo;d be like, why am I feeling like this?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do this very well in certain aspects of my life now that I mention it or now that</p>
<p>I think about it.</p>
<p>But when it comes to competing, I think I do an all right job and I&rsquo;m trying to learn</p>
<p>to be better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going like, well, why do I, if I feel this way, there&rsquo;s a reason.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Am I thinking about this the wrong way?</p>
<p>Have I not adequately prepared for something?</p>
<p>I have to address it and then maybe I&rsquo;ll be up for four hours that night, like extra hours</p>
<p>thinking what have I not addressed, watching sparring, watching this, watching that.</p>
<p>And then when I am thinking about things more accurately or when I&rsquo;ve addressed what that</p>
<p>concern was, I feel any of that concern kind of dissipate.</p>
<p>And I guess if I honestly thought that, I guess when it comes to, I know I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>die at a certain point, obviously, I&rsquo;m going to get hurt, pain happens.</p>
<p>But the pain of loss would be nothing compared to the, or the pain of injury would be nothing</p>
<p>compared to the pain of running away.</p>
<p>And so I guess if I think about where&rsquo;s my value, it&rsquo;s like I feel like I&rsquo;m a winner</p>
<p>and every single time I step into that ring and fight with everything that I have, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>promise that I&rsquo;ll win my next fight.</p>
<p>I know that I have the skills and the tools to beat anyone in grappling or in mixed martial</p>
<p>arts at this point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I know that for certain, I&rsquo;ve trained with enough people, I&rsquo;ve competed with enough</p>
<p>people, I know where I stand.</p>
<p>But I also know that I&rsquo;m not perfect and also the better fighter, even if I perceived that</p>
<p>I was that thing, doesn&rsquo;t win on the night.</p>
<p>The man who fights better wins on the night.</p>
<p>And if I give credence in my mind to only the person that&rsquo;s won has value versus going,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your process?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your path through this?</p>
<p>How are you going about this?</p>
<p>How are you thinking about this?</p>
<p>How are you behaving?</p>
<p>Then if I can focus on the process, then I will respect my opponent and I will respect</p>
<p>myself and I&rsquo;ll respect anyone that behaves with a certain level of consistency to that.</p>
<p>And they could win, there&rsquo;s plenty of winners in history that are shitbags and there&rsquo;s plenty</p>
<p>of losers that are not.</p>
<p>But winning doesn&rsquo;t make you a bad or good person and losing doesn&rsquo;t make you good by</p>
<p>default either or bad by default.</p>
<p>And I think that that can be the truth socially, that can be the truth athletically and academically.</p>
<p>So I guess&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there a primal fear though, like a primal fear of getting hurt?</p>
<p>The running away and not facing the threat long term is the bigger pain than any pain</p>
<p>you can experience in the fight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</p>
<p>But what about the violence of, I mean, you don&rsquo;t have that on your face, but like, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve also seen Tyson talk about, he was on Rogan recently and he was</p>
<p>talking about, he was trying to psychoanalyze himself about why he enjoys violence so much.</p>
<p>I mean, he called it orgasmic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, have you seen that clip?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re playing it because I can, I need to, because Trump also retweeted it, which is</p>
<p>hilarious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to contextualize that our president retweeted the clip of Tyson saying&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s just doing like, they&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to throw him a curve ball.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s going to have any idea what that is.</p>
<p>But yeah, he did no explanation, just, here you go.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s kind of like what you were describing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if I give you an answer, it has to be a good one.</p>
<p>Better to just let your imagination run.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like the Kubrick of our time.</p>
<p>Now what&rsquo;s really interesting that sometimes, period, it&rsquo;s not real, but sometimes I struggle</p>
<p>with the fact of why there&rsquo;s a possibility I can really hurt somebody.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t want to hurt them.</p>
<p>What do you mean when you struggle with the possibility that you could hurt them?</p>
<p>That is sometimes, it&rsquo;s orgasmic sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like some fights, like particular, like Tyrell Biggs or someone that you had problems with,</p>
<p>someone that you, you had animosity towards.</p>
<p>So when you finally get your hands on them.</p>
<p>Hey, what does it mean when fighting gets you, gets you erect?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Means you&rsquo;re getting excited.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that, that&rsquo;s going through your mind right now.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s how I get when I was a kid and I, you know, sometimes I get the twinkle.</p>
<p>The twinkle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>When you reached a state as a human being, as a champion, as a ferocious fighter, you</p>
<p>reached a state of, of ability and of accomplishment that very few humans will ever, ever touch</p>
<p>and feel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you when you&rsquo;re running, when you&rsquo;re hitting the bag, when that heart&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beating again and that you know who you are, you&rsquo;re Mike motherfucking Tyson.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re doing all this shit again, you&rsquo;re still Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>Those thoughts have got to be burning inside you again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be pretty wild.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wild, but I believe it&rsquo;s rightfully so to be that way.</p>
<p>And I used to know how to, I don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m master, but I used to know how to deal with</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t let it overwhelm me.</p>
<p>I mean, he goes on to try to, they don&rsquo;t ever, like Joe doesn&rsquo;t bite.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about that conversation is Mike was trying to figure himself out.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s trying on the spot, like, why do I feel this way?</p>
<p>To me it was like, to me it&rsquo;s so real and honest to feel like pleasure from hurting</p>
<p>somebody.</p>
<p>Like that you rarely hear that.</p>
<p>In this society, it&rsquo;s like, you rarely like talk about like you feel pleasure from winning.</p>
<p>You feel pleasure from like the relief of overcoming like all the stress you had to</p>
<p>go through.</p>
<p>Pleasure from just like the specifics of the fight, the techniques you use, the maybe</p>
<p>overcoming being down a couple of rounds, but like how often do you hear somebody say,</p>
<p>I just enjoyed, he&rsquo;s not even saying because I hate the opponent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying like, I enjoyed purely the violence of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s honest.</p>
<p>It made me ask, like, I wonder how many of us are cognizant of that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say Mike is uncommonly seemingly honest.</p>
<p>I think athletes make a full time job out of lying, you know, I think people make a</p>
<p>full time job.</p>
<p>To themselves perhaps too.</p>
<p>I mean, in some, you tell yourself or you tell others what you feel you need to, or</p>
<p>maybe whether you&rsquo;ve, whether you even know what you feel you need to, but why should</p>
<p>he not, I mean, again, did he, did he run up and just hit somebody that&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t sign</p>
<p>up for this?</p>
<p>No, they, they signed up to be there.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the interesting thing about Dyson is there&rsquo;s that weird, uh, like nonstandard</p>
<p>behavior.</p>
<p>I mean, like your fighting style is not standard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s nonstandard to another degree of like, uh, who else has that in Jiu Jitsu, uh, uh,</p>
<p>Polaris, uh, uh, has this kind of weirdness, like what&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s in there?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a fear that I think, uh, most opponents would have because it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no longer about like, it takes you out of the realm of its game.</p>
<p>It takes us back to the thing we were talking about, like before is it strips away that</p>
<p>like several layers of Ryan Hall, the, the podcast, uh, guest, Ryan Hall, the Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>instructor, Ryan Hall, Jiu Jitsu competitor, it keeps going down to a point where like</p>
<p>Ryan Hall, the murderer of all things that get in his way that lies underneath all of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Seemingly like if we&rsquo;re like in this society, we put all that aside, but it makes you wonder</p>
<p>like now as society is being tested in many ways, it makes you wonder like what&rsquo;s underneath</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Well, do we want, do we want the answer to that?</p>
<p>Cause I guess it&rsquo;s, what is it?</p>
<p>Uh, you seem Paul Fiction, you know, the best character in the movie and in the best scene</p>
<p>in the movie is like, if my questions here, if you&rsquo;re, what do you call it?</p>
<p>If my answer is scary, you should cease asking scary questions, you know?</p>
<p>And I guess, uh, you wonder, I mean, all of us, that&rsquo;s something that I think it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>we go, that&rsquo;s not okay, I mean, versus maybe not appropriate for situation X, Y, or Z.</p>
<p>But uh, what should make any of us think, I mean, humanity is a different place now.</p>
<p>And I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying anything crazy out there, but humanity is a different place</p>
<p>now than we were 5,000 years ago where all of us are descended from people who have killed</p>
<p>things with their teeth and fingernails in order to be where we are.</p>
<p>And whether it was in, whether it was an animal or it was in conflict with another person,</p>
<p>I mean, think about the, the chances of dying by violence now are so, so slim, at least</p>
<p>in most countries in most plays, like shockingly small, thankfully.</p>
<p>But there was a period of time, like the most period of time where dying by violence was</p>
<p>mostly how it went down.</p>
<p>And I guess what would be facilitative, what would allow you to win back to Ender&rsquo;s game?</p>
<p>You know, what allows you, if you can&rsquo;t do that, you are all, you are forever subject</p>
<p>to people who can, and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>And you know, we&rsquo;re fortunate to find ourselves in a situation where we don&rsquo;t, where other</p>
<p>things matter.</p>
<p>But that is a funny thing periodically where people, you&rsquo;ll see people kind of drawn at</p>
<p>each other, like in videos or out in the world that clearly neither of them expect this to</p>
<p>get serious.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m just going to yell at you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to yell at me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like this weird LARPing thing where we&rsquo;re both going to go on our own separate</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>All it takes is one person to be like, well, I wasn&rsquo;t kidding.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, you&rsquo;ll go to jail.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh, I know you&rsquo;re going to go to the morgue.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, but that can happen like that.</p>
<p>Like society.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, anyway, you could jump across the table, stab me in the eye.</p>
<p>I mean, I appreciate, I&rsquo;d hope if you don&rsquo;t, and there will be consequences if you do,</p>
<p>but not from, not from me, from, from the rest of society will potentially get you at</p>
<p>a certain point, but you can decide to not play by the rules anytime you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that, yeah, that&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ve created rules based on which we all behave,</p>
<p>but underneath there, you know, there, there&rsquo;s things that doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s motivations and</p>
<p>forces that don&rsquo;t play by the rules and still there nature is metal is under the surface.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>And again, I pull out my phone and I&rsquo;m basically saying like, Hey, I&rsquo;m going to, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get caught.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But really I&rsquo;m further antagonizing you rightly or wrongly.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, and that, that&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>And I feel like just people need to remember any of us need to remember just for any reason,</p>
<p>just that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s one step away at all, at all times you ever, I&rsquo;ve had people say</p>
<p>to me before, like, Oh, I don&rsquo;t feel safe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re not safe.</p>
<p>I kill you before you get out of this room.</p>
<p>Nothing you do to stop that.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I mean, but don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>You can do the same to me, which means I&rsquo;m like, Oh, Oh, thank goodness.</p>
<p>Can you imagine like how many guns are there are in this country?</p>
<p>Like I mean, everywhere, I mean, seriously everywhere, but that&rsquo;s a heartening thought.</p>
<p>Not the other way.</p>
<p>Cause people usually freak out and go, Oh my God, gun violence, gun violence, gun violence</p>
<p>is like really not a serious issue in the United States compared to what it could be.</p>
<p>Because it means that, I mean, with the amount of guns and the amount of bullets that are</p>
<p>out there that are in circulation, can you imagine if like one in every thousand was</p>
<p>used in anger each day?</p>
<p>I mean, this would be a terrifying place to live.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>So, I mean, although you could say, Hey, this is more than we&rsquo;d like or X, Y, Z, it actually</p>
<p>means that people are much more reasonable and sane than we&rsquo;re saying then, or then I,</p>
<p>then sometimes I might, my might argue.</p>
<p>So I guess what I mean is like, Oh man, I walked a seven 11 and I didn&rsquo;t get stabbed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Oh, well that&rsquo;s good because not because I protected myself with my karate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically no one decided to run over and stab me because I wasn&rsquo;t protecting myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I, they, they stopped.</p>
<p>So I guess we&rsquo;re all fortunate to live in a society that, that like you said, nature</p>
<p>being metal doesn&rsquo;t become that big of an issue all the time.</p>
<p>But it is funny when you get people in the ring and you go, Hey, let&rsquo;s peel back from</p>
<p>Mr. Tyson, many layers of that and say, Hey, now it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cool that, I mean, that&rsquo;s what society is doing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve lived in Harvard square for awhile and we add extra layers of what safe means.</p>
<p>Like now there&rsquo;s a disc discourse about safe spaces, about like ideas being violence or,</p>
<p>or like, uh, you know, like, yeah, but ideas are minor slights against your personality</p>
<p>being violence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all like extra layers around the nature is metal thing that, uh, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what progress is.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t forget that like underneath it is still, it&rsquo;s still the, the thing that will</p>
<p>murder at the, at the drop of, uh, in any, at any moment.</p>
<p>If uh, if aroused one, one thing that I find funny though, or ironic maybe about the, uh,</p>
<p>the, you know, words of violence, you know, offenses, violence thing is that of course</p>
<p>that if that, the belief in that then justifies my violence, like my, and whether it may be</p>
<p>in my, maybe not physical violence, but my response to my, my aggressive response to</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>And I guess like, which it can be regrets of begets a further aggressive response and</p>
<p>like a, you know, kind of a tit for tat sort of situation or, or it goes to like, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 10 of me and there&rsquo;s one of you, so we&rsquo;ll get you and you can&rsquo;t do anything about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not morality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s just saying that&rsquo;s might makes right.</p>
<p>So I guess again, you can understand why people do it and there are certain, there is a progress</p>
<p>aspect to it.</p>
<p>But again, I guess without proper examination, I&rsquo;m effectively with my 10 friends, you know,</p>
<p>and, and the force of the law, Mike Tyson and people, but not admitting to myself what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And at least Mike Tyson again is honest.</p>
<p>Are you, uh, afraid of death?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s easy for me to say no, as I sit here, probably not about to die, but.</p>
<p>Is this like the UFC question, can you defeat any opponent?</p>
<p>The answer is of course, yes.</p>
<p>And uh, I don&rsquo;t have, they&rsquo;re not around, they&rsquo;re not here, are they?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But, uh, I mean, are you, uh, do you ponder your own mortality?</p>
<p>Maybe another context to that is you mentioned two deaths for martial artists.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually why, honestly, even though at a relatively young age, I think</p>
<p>mortality is something that I&rsquo;m aware of more, maybe more than the average person.</p>
<p>I think probably most athletes can speak to this and anyone that&rsquo;s had trouble, I&rsquo;ve managed</p>
<p>to just slide out of a couple of near death experiences personally, you know, mostly river</p>
<p>related, um, because I&rsquo;m an idiot, but, um, I regret nothing, but, uh, yeah, but, uh,</p>
<p>thank God we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>But, um, yeah, it is an interest seeing, seeing the end and seeing going, well, what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>I guess I think it comes back to kind of what we&rsquo;re discussing about belief structure and</p>
<p>belief system.</p>
<p>I think a lot of times, if I recognize that no matter what I do, it&rsquo;s all going to end</p>
<p>one day and then you go, well, why were we here?</p>
<p>What would I do?</p>
<p>Am I going to make it to 40?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hope so that I had no idea that I was going to make it to the age that I am</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>Um, am I going to make it to 80?</p>
<p>How much of that is in my control?</p>
<p>Much of it is not.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting, like back to the belief structure again, like locus of internal and</p>
<p>external locus of control.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s facilitative versus what&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And you know, I think accepting personal responsibility for more than is on my control is, is probably</p>
<p>a positive, but at the same time, recognizing that much of much is not in my control.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be born in the United States, fortunate enough to, you know, to</p>
<p>not knock on wood, have, have a serious disease that I&rsquo;m not aware of right now.</p>
<p>Um, I didn&rsquo;t do any of that.</p>
<p>I just showed up.</p>
<p>That was really fortunate.</p>
<p>And I guess that doesn&rsquo;t diminish the fact that I&rsquo;ve tried to make decent choices, but</p>
<p>it works in concert with it.</p>
<p>And I, I guess, um, when I, when you go, is death what I want right now?</p>
<p>No, no, I should think not.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s easier for me to be relatively calm about as I&rsquo;m not staring it in the face,</p>
<p>but what I would care a lot more about is, is how you live.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in my control.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t control if, as I walk out of this building, a helicopter falls on me worrying</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t control it.</p>
<p>Maybe I, maybe I have cancer now and I don&rsquo;t know it and I really hope not.</p>
<p>But um,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about meditating on the fact that it could end today outside of your</p>
<p>control that can clarify your thinking about the, the fact that life is amazing, like just</p>
<p>kind of, yeah, helping you enjoy this moment.</p>
<p>Even if life was horrible, let&rsquo;s say for instance, it was, it was, you live at one of those times</p>
<p>or places and this place is still exists in this world today that life is brutal and metal</p>
<p>and whatever all and short and painful.</p>
<p>Would you still want it?</p>
<p>And again, as I&rsquo;m sitting here and not, not on fire physically, it&rsquo;s easy to say yes,</p>
<p>but I would, I&rsquo;m confident I still I&rsquo;ll plant my feet and say yes, any of, any life is amazing</p>
<p>and beautiful and a gift and unbelievable gift, uh, that none of us have earned for</p>
<p>the record.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, I hate the word earned a lot of times earned yet you earn, but it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of, a lot of good fortune and earning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s back to, do I want justice or do I want grace?</p>
<p>And I guess we&rsquo;re all fortunate to be where we are, no matter where we are.</p>
<p>And hopefully it should give us some sense of perspective, some sense of compassion for</p>
<p>other people.</p>
<p>But also like, like you said, a sense of peace, if it all ended right now, would I be happy</p>
<p>with what I, with life to this point?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, of course, would you like to live a little longer?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would try to do more and try to live rightly to the best that I know how, which over time</p>
<p>will hopefully continue to evolve in a, in a positive direction.</p>
<p>But if the answer to that is no, I guess, uh, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s always, that&rsquo;s a sign that,</p>
<p>that what I&rsquo;m doing is not what I&rsquo;m meant to be doing.</p>
<p>And I mean, you&rsquo;re familiar with the Tecumseh before, uh, so there&rsquo;s a, I&rsquo;ve got one actually,</p>
<p>if you could give me 10 seconds, I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll read this one out.</p>
<p>This is a personal favorite basically.</p>
<p>And I think it sums up, I mean, again, like it&rsquo;s one of those quotes on the internet,</p>
<p>like when Abraham Lincoln said, don&rsquo;t believe everything you read online.</p>
<p>Um, but, uh, this is, you know, I, it&rsquo;s again, uh, attributed, but it&rsquo;s like, so live your</p>
<p>life that the fear of death can never enter your heart, trouble, no one about their religion,</p>
<p>respect others in their view and demand that they respect yours, love your life, perfect</p>
<p>your life and beautify all things in your life.</p>
<p>Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people.</p>
<p>Prepare a noble death song for the day.</p>
<p>When you go over the great divide, always give a word or sign of salute when meeting</p>
<p>or passing a friend, even a stranger when in a lonely place.</p>
<p>Show respect to all people and grovel to none.</p>
<p>When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the food and for the joy of living.</p>
<p>If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.</p>
<p>Abuse no one and no thing for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit</p>
<p>of its vision.</p>
<p>When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear</p>
<p>of death so that when their time comes, they weep and pray for a little more time to live</p>
<p>their lives over again in a different way.</p>
<p>Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.</p>
<p>Powerful words.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it.</p>
<p>Let me just say, we&rsquo;ve spoke maybe five, six years ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember when, but I&rsquo;m not exaggerating saying like you had a huge impact on my life</p>
<p>because of the podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the reason I was doing the podcast as long as I have.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the reason I&rsquo;m doing this podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little, it&rsquo;s a stupid little meeting that you probably didn&rsquo;t know who I was.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know who you are.</p>
<p>It was just like a magical moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a flap of a butterfly wing kind of situation.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;m forever grateful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the most inspiring people in my life.</p>
<p>So Ryan, it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would come here.</p>
<p>Jen didn&rsquo;t talk with me and waste all this time.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Alexis.</p>

<p>But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
