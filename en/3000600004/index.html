    <p>(audience chattering)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good afternoon and welcome</li>
</ul>
<p>to today&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series on Sustainable Futures.</p>
<p>I am Michele de Nevers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the executive director of the Sustainability</p>
<p>and Climate Change Office here at Berkeley Haas,</p>
<p>and I am thrilled to introduce two</p>
<p>of the women leaders whom I most admire.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s guest speaker in the Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series</p>
<p>is Afsaneh Beschloss.</p>
<p>Afsaneh is the founder and the CEO of RockCreek,</p>
<p>which is an investment firm</p>
<p>among the largest woman-headed investment firms anywhere.</p>
<p>Afsaneh has been named among the most powerful women</p>
<p>in banking by American Banker.</p>
<p>And her firm, RockCreek, manages over $15 billion in assets</p>
<p>and believes that integrating inclusion</p>
<p>and sustainability from the very beginning</p>
<p>is the soundest way to generate long-term value.</p>
<p>Prior to starting RockCreek,</p>
<p>Afsaneh was a managing director</p>
<p>and partner at the Carlyle Group,</p>
<p>and before that, she was the treasurer</p>
<p>and chief investment officer at the World Bank,</p>
<p>which is where we met.</p>
<p>Afsaneh and I joined the World Bank</p>
<p>in their Young Professional Program</p>
<p>at exactly the same time a few years ago,</p>
<p>early in our careers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Afsaneh] I was gonna say, you don&rsquo;t have to say the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to. (laughs)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You would&rsquo;ve thought that I joined a lot sooner.</p>
<p>But anyway, we joined at the same time.</p>
<p>So Afsaneh has advised governments,</p>
<p>central banks and regulatory agencies</p>
<p>on global public policy and financial policy,</p>
<p>as well as energy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s actually quite an energy expert.</p>
<p>She recently gave a talk as part</p>
<p>of the UN climate negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh,</p>
<p>where she spoke about accelerating finance</p>
<p>towards mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>Here at Haas, as you know,</p>
<p>we are keenly aware of the role of investment</p>
<p>in the climate and sustainability transition.</p>
<p>In 2008, Haas launched the first student-managed</p>
<p>Socially Responsible Investment Fund,</p>
<p>and today our Sustainable and Impact Finance initiative</p>
<p>is educating the next generation of leaders</p>
<p>to utilize finance and investment</p>
<p>to drive positive global change.</p>
<p>In fact, on March 22nd, 2023,</p>
<p>the Sustainable and Impact Finance initiative</p>
<p>is organizing its first inaugural conference</p>
<p>on mobilizing climate finance to achieve net zero by 2050.</p>
<p>So we are delighted to have Afsaneh with us today</p>
<p>to explore these issues.</p>
<p>Leading the conversation today is Ann Harrison,</p>
<p>the 15th dean of the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Ann Harrison is a renowned economist</p>
<p>and has dedicated her career to researching inclusive</p>
<p>and sustainable policies in development economics,</p>
<p>international trade and global markets.</p>
<p>She now brings this focus to higher education</p>
<p>here at the greatest public university in the world,</p>
<p>go bears, and the number one public business school.</p>
<p>Ann Harrison also worked at the World Bank,</p>
<p>which is also where we met.</p>
<p>And so you can see that the World Bank</p>
<p>has been a launchpad for powerful women</p>
<p>in economics and finance.</p>
<p>So please join me in a warm welcome</p>
<p>for Afsaneh and Ann Harrison, thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<ul>
<li>So I&rsquo;m going to start out, Afsaneh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, again, for joining us today.</p>
<p>So you and I, we both started our careers at the World Bank.</p>
<p>And now I see that you have founded and are leading</p>
<p>a very successful investment management company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leading a top 10 business school.</p>
<p>If we look around, we have other World Bank,</p>
<p>former World Bank colleagues</p>
<p>who are doing amazing things, also women.</p>
<p>So the World Trade Organization</p>
<p>is led by a former World Bank woman.</p>
<p>The IMF is led by one, the London School of Economics,</p>
<p>the Fletcher School.</p>
<p>So what is it about the World Bank that really fosters</p>
<p>and creates strong women leaders?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my first question.</p>
<p>And then my second question is maybe you could tell us</p>
<p>a little bit about the path that led you</p>
<p>from an energy economist at the World Bank</p>
<p>to leading the World Bank Treasury</p>
<p>to where you are today as the founder of your own firm.</p>
<ul>
<li>So thank you, Ann, and thank you, Michele,</li>
</ul>
<p>for your very kind invitation to be together today.</p>
<p>It is really, seriously, a true honor to be on</p>
<p>with the two of you and to, you know,</p>
<p>be with your great audience of really incredible students.</p>
<p>So as Michele said, we go back a long way</p>
<p>and as Ann said, we have all worked in an institution</p>
<p>that you hear about sometimes positively,</p>
<p>sometimes negatively.</p>
<p>You hear a lot about the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>But on the positive side, it&rsquo;s one of the very few places</p>
<p>where women have been able to actually just do fine.</p>
<p>And in the finance part of the bank where I worked,</p>
<p>as well as energy, and other parts</p>
<p>on the developments and policy side</p>
<p>where Michele worked and also Ann worked,</p>
<p>we had probably a lot of women role models.</p>
<p>I think one of them</p>
<p>is that there were other senior women around us.</p>
<p>Number two, because we worked in a very diverse environment.</p>
<p>You can imagine the World Bank is a very, very global place</p>
<p>and very international and we are all very different</p>
<p>with very different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Being different was not, you know,</p>
<p>did not stand out, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>And I think your student body is similarly very diverse.</p>
<p>So in my own case, I had my first two,</p>
<p>I should say bosses happened to have been women.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I sought out to work with them,</p>
<p>but I worked with DeAnne Julius,</p>
<p>who is very renowned in energy,</p>
<p>and Jessica Einhorn actually became also afterwards,</p>
<p>also treasurer of the World Bank and was dean of SAIS</p>
<p>among other people that Ann just mentioned.</p>
<p>And, you know, it made it sort of possible</p>
<p>to think of myself in the same terms.</p>
<p>So it was not uncommon for those of us</p>
<p>who worked around other women who were, you know,</p>
<p>just great in terms of their expertise</p>
<p>but also great in terms of mentoring</p>
<p>and sharing that expertise to flourish.</p>
<p>The other thing I would say is what Ann just said.</p>
<p>I mean, look at what she has done herself.</p>
<p>She has had a renowned career</p>
<p>before she joined the World Bank</p>
<p>and then at the World Bank she did an incredible job.</p>
<p>But then now in doing this role,</p>
<p>which is in education and working at, you know, at the,</p>
<p>as I agree with you, the best business school in the world,</p>
<p>she is bringing that same energy and dynamic spirit</p>
<p>to the men and women of Berkeley Haas.</p>
<p>And similarly, Michele, who I was very fortunate,</p>
<p>I should say, I&rsquo;m one of three sisters, so is she.</p>
<p>And we bonded quickly when we both joined the bank</p>
<p>at about the same time and have commiserated</p>
<p>and been excited through our lives</p>
<p>about many of our, you know, life experiences.</p>
<p>So let me just stop there before I go on</p>
<p>to sort of how I got into what I got, if I may, Ann.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if there was anything else on that</p>
<p>that I could say or you may want to jump in</p>
<p>or Michele may want to jump in.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, no, we just love to hear a little bit</li>
</ul>
<p>about your journey as an entrepreneur now.</p>
<p>leading the company, RockCreek.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>So very quickly,</p>
<p>you asked about the journey a little earlier.</p>
<p>I was born in an emerging market, Iran,</p>
<p>and I came to the US and when I was 16</p>
<p>as a exchange student, lived in Concord, Mass.</p>
<p>And when I was there, I already had an interest in energy</p>
<p>because I grew in a country where, you know,</p>
<p>which was an oil producer and had the largest,</p>
<p>second largest reserves of natural gas.</p>
<p>Natural gas being a big topic these days of course.</p>
<p>And fast forward, I went on to England</p>
<p>to do my undergraduate postgraduate.</p>
<p>And when I was at Oxford doing my postgraduate work,</p>
<p>I worked with one of my professors</p>
<p>also started the Oxford Energy Institute while I was there.</p>
<p>And it was a very oil and gas-based place at the time.</p>
<p>But his advice to me was a lot of the men know about oil,</p>
<p>very few people are natural gas experts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cleaner fuel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting your life in economics as an economist,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you learn something</p>
<p>about cleaner fuels like natural gas?</p>
<p>So that was kind of unusual at the time</p>
<p>and it is very similar to all of you</p>
<p>who live in the Bay Area,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s so much venture going on around you,</p>
<p>where, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of innovation.</p>
<p>So believe it or not, I know it sounds hard</p>
<p>to think that natural gas at that time</p>
<p>was an innovation to work on.</p>
<p>And fast forward, I went to J.P. Morgan</p>
<p>and did a couple of years there</p>
<p>and learned a lot about many of the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re learning in your course</p>
<p>like accounting and corporate finance</p>
<p>and all those good skills that one needs</p>
<p>in order to be able to do other things.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re trained as an economist in England,</p>
<p>believe it or not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t take any other courses than economics.</p>
<p>And I was passionate about working</p>
<p>on economic development like Michele and Ann.</p>
<p>So I ended up at the World Bank</p>
<p>in the Young Professional Program where I met Michele.</p>
<p>And I initially worked on health briefly</p>
<p>as a young professional, but energy had been,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, something I was very excited about.</p>
<p>So I went on to the energy department.</p>
<p>And as a young person,</p>
<p>I mean, probably not very different in age</p>
<p>than some of you in, you know,</p>
<p>who are listening to us today.</p>
<p>I said to my boss then, DeAnne Julius,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should really do more on natural gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she said, &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I went on later on to create this group</p>
<p>and brought in everybody from the private sector</p>
<p>because one of the things we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>is that in order to, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much that a multilateral can do,</p>
<p>but you really need to leverage its resources</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to succeed,</p>
<p>otherwise the money is not well spent.</p>
<p>So we leveraged resources.</p>
<p>Every dollar that we brought,</p>
<p>the private sector brought $10</p>
<p>because these were good projects at the time.</p>
<p>And a lot of them was moving countries away</p>
<p>from coal to natural gas.</p>
<p>Again, a topic that is very, very topical right now</p>
<p>in Europe, in Indonesia, in South Africa,</p>
<p>in many other countries.</p>
<p>So that was sort of the early, early story, Ann,</p>
<p>and then as solar and wind technology started</p>
<p>to get more developed, we started doing those</p>
<p>and we were pioneering investing in solar and wind.</p>
<p>And to be quite honest, they were not quite economic yet.</p>
<p>So we got special grants from a lot of the Nordic countries</p>
<p>to work on this in a number of countries</p>
<p>that were well-suited for doing solar and wind.</p>
<p>And it was really quite spectacular</p>
<p>to be investing in Latin America, in Africa and in Asia</p>
<p>in these cleaner forms of energy in the early days</p>
<p>and doing environmental studies.</p>
<p>And a lot of what we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>in terms of impactful investments we were doing then</p>
<p>and trying to do the measurements</p>
<p>because that was the other thing.</p>
<p>Are we actually helping, you know,</p>
<p>on the environmental side?</p>
<p>So some of what we are using today was probably developed</p>
<p>at that time with my colleagues and I,</p>
<p>as we worked on these.</p>
<p>So it was a very, very exciting time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s really inspirational to me</p>
<p>to hear what a pioneer you are.</p>
<p>So I understand, so you were the first, you were the pioneer</p>
<p>to lead the World Bank&rsquo;s investments in clean energy,</p>
<p>and wind and solar with the goal,</p>
<p>also in infrastructure to reduce emission.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s move to right now.</p>
<p>Right now, what&rsquo;s exciting to you in climate tech</p>
<p>and in renewable energy specifically?</p>
<ul>
<li>So Ann, I think a lot of really two or three areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>One is obviously investing in climate tech</p>
<p>in some of the new technologies</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing a fair bit of that</p>
<p>and a lot of that is happening, again, in your zip code,</p>
<p>but is really happening all over the world,</p>
<p>including in some emerging markets as well.</p>
<p>So we are investing in new technologies</p>
<p>that are affecting aviation.</p>
<p>I like to call it air, land and water,</p>
<p>because a lot of what we have all worked on traditionally</p>
<p>is like on energy on land and have food and ag</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a lot going on with aviation fuels</p>
<p>and as we speak, we&rsquo;re doing some early investments</p>
<p>on alternatives to aviation fuels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work going on on water, as you know,</p>
<p>because that is such an important source</p>
<p>of both resources but also getting destroyed very fast</p>
<p>by many in the world.</p>
<p>So we are doing the early stage.</p>
<p>Where we also are spending a lot of time, Ann,</p>
<p>is also on bringing existing, you know,</p>
<p>technology on solar but scaling it.</p>
<p>Because as you know with the new Inflation Act,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of wind behind investing in cleaner energy.</p>
<p>And I think President Biden&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>efforts to get this as the largest bill</p>
<p>that is going to help us move in this direction</p>
<p>is very, very powerful.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re doing is to look</p>
<p>at specifically scaling solar,</p>
<p>both residential but also what we call community</p>
<p>because the community-based solar</p>
<p>is very much even more economic</p>
<p>and you sort of bring it into a community</p>
<p>rather than individually, which is, as we all know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any of you have tried</p>
<p>to bring solar power into your own home.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a shortage of contractors</p>
<p>and shortage of experts on this,</p>
<p>believe it or not, as we speak.</p>
<p>And then also of course, you know,</p>
<p>working on scaling a lot of what is going</p>
<p>on the electric vehicles.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on that across the board on vehicles,</p>
<p>as well as larger trucks.</p>
<p>So I think both on terms of early tech,</p>
<p>as well as existing, we&rsquo;re looking at battery storage</p>
<p>of course, you know, that&rsquo;s a very, very big area.</p>
<p>Problem with that is that we&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>a lot of the new technologies that are going on</p>
<p>have still not been incorporated</p>
<p>into existing batteries that we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>and we are looking at that.</p>
<p>I think I was looking at some numbers</p>
<p>and just since January, 2021,</p>
<p>there has been more than close to 100 billion raised</p>
<p>for just climate-focused funds from almost 132 firms.</p>
<p>So that is sort of a large number.</p>
<p>And again, I think given where you&rsquo;re living,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably seeing a lot of that going on around you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, thank you so much for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now I wanna shift a little bit to think,</p>
<p>talking about venture capital.</p>
<p>So we know that here in the Bay Area</p>
<p>that venture capital has been absolutely critical</p>
<p>in the explosive growth of tech,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just think about the role of venture capital</p>
<p>in a broader sense.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now thinking about venture capital</p>
<p>in much many other fields,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s agriculture or social impact, for example.</p>
<p>So I was just wondering what do you see</p>
<p>as the role of venture capital</p>
<p>in sort of the ecosystem in general?</p>
<ul>
<li>So Ann, it&rsquo;s really interesting</li>
</ul>
<p>because if you read a lot about venture capital,</p>
<p>obviously, it&rsquo;s been the fastest growing area of investment</p>
<p>in the last few years and we saw the huge numbers</p>
<p>in terms of performance, particularly the last two years,</p>
<p>the not so good numbers in 2022,</p>
<p>which is normal because anything that does incredibly well,</p>
<p>like, is up 40, 50, 60% in one year</p>
<p>is not going to continue on that front.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still, in my mind,</p>
<p>the most exciting because at the end of the day</p>
<p>where returns will come from is innovation,</p>
<p>where returns will come from</p>
<p>is how we&rsquo;re going to be living in the future.</p>
<p>And again, I think your student body</p>
<p>should be telling me what we should be looking at,</p>
<p>but it seems to me that the big themes for investors</p>
<p>is how do we invest in cheap energy</p>
<p>but cheap energy now happens to be clean energy,</p>
<p>so that makes it easier.</p>
<p>How do we get sick less?</p>
<p>Well, we need, you know, cleaner water,</p>
<p>better sources of food and healthier food.</p>
<p>So that takes us to food tech,</p>
<p>and we are investing in food and ag</p>
<p>because there is a lot going on as we speak,</p>
<p>not in terms of just producing more but better quality</p>
<p>and one of the projects we&rsquo;re investing as we speak</p>
<p>is also how do you reduce water, for example.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s with the venture firm</p>
<p>because look at almond and pistachios</p>
<p>and other goods in California.</p>
<p>The company we&rsquo;re investing in is trying</p>
<p>to reduce the water need by about a third.</p>
<p>So venture firms are at the, you know,</p>
<p>I think the numbers I&rsquo;ve seen is something, like,</p>
<p>about 2 trillion of venture invested so far,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that number is right or not,</p>
<p>your students and you would know better, in the US.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world is behind the US</p>
<p>but starting to invest a lot more in Asia.</p>
<p>Europe is behind, but trying to do more.</p>
<p>And I think that will change over time.</p>
<p>But here you are where you are sitting</p>
<p>in the middle of the sort of center of innovation</p>
<p>and venture will continue.</p>
<p>And as you very correctly said,</p>
<p>I really liked what you said</p>
<p>because most people when they think venture</p>
<p>or investing in venture or a lot of endowments,</p>
<p>foundations that you know very well around the Valley,</p>
<p>have been investing in tech that is related to software.</p>
<p>And I think the future as we speak</p>
<p>and in the future and some of what we&rsquo;re doing at RockCreek</p>
<p>is investing, of course, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll continue doing that, no question about software,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a lot in the themes of sustainability</p>
<p>and impact in health, education, and climate.</p>
<p>That will be very exciting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s turn to the company that you founded</p>
<p>and that you are heading, RockCreek.</p>
<p>So tell us a little bit about major trends</p>
<p>and exciting new investment opportunities</p>
<p>that you are seeing at RockCreek in venture capital.</p>
<ul>
<li>So thank you for asking me that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m always excited to talk about RockCreek.</p>
<p>So I started RockCreek in about 2003, 2004,</p>
<p>and we really do two kinds of businesses.</p>
<p>One is we will work with endowment foundations,</p>
<p>become their chief investment officer</p>
<p>and allocate their assets</p>
<p>based on what our views are on the markets</p>
<p>and then choose funds or companies to invest in,</p>
<p>public and private.</p>
<p>So all the way from venture,</p>
<p>early growth and late stage, as well as private equity,</p>
<p>real estates and public markets.</p>
<p>On the other side of our business,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing direct investments in climate,</p>
<p>in food and ag, in health, in education, et cetera.</p>
<p>So those are sort of the two ends</p>
<p>and we are investing very globally,</p>
<p>US, Europe and a lot in emerging markets.</p>
<p>So what is interesting and what I would say, Ann,</p>
<p>has changed a lot is when we started RockCreek,</p>
<p>we wanted to do more in impactful investments,</p>
<p>but it was sometimes hard to convince our clients</p>
<p>who are endowment foundations, pension plans,</p>
<p>about these areas.</p>
<p>And something changed just before COVID</p>
<p>and particularly during COVID.</p>
<p>And what has been super exciting for me</p>
<p>and for our team here at RockCreek</p>
<p>is how our clients have basically hired RockCreek</p>
<p>because they are excited about these areas.</p>
<p>Some of the things that you asked me about earlier.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re getting new clients who are joining us,</p>
<p>but very mission-driven but mission-driven</p>
<p>with a return objective.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all looking at market returns</p>
<p>and at the same time,</p>
<p>they expect to do no damage if they can</p>
<p>and hopefully do some good</p>
<p>as far as impactful investments are concerned.</p>
<p>I should mention also,</p>
<p>I chair the investment committee at Rockefeller Foundation,</p>
<p>and Doris Duke Foundation and National Geographic,</p>
<p>as well as World Resources Institute.</p>
<p>Different in terms of their sustainability goals,</p>
<p>but I can tell you that not just in my day job,</p>
<p>but in my, you know, life as a non-profit trustee,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing the same trends as I just mentioned,</p>
<p>where a lot of foundations are looking</p>
<p>at increasing the share of impactful investments</p>
<p>in their total investments.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how exactly the Berkeley Endowment</p>
<p>is managed, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re looking at more impactful investments as well.</p>
<p>But I can also talk about some examples</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s of interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, maybe we can talk about that in the next question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I wanted to ask a little bit</p>
<p>about ESG in particular, right?</p>
<p>We all know ESG stands</p>
<p>for environmental, social, governance factors</p>
<p>in investments mostly in public markets.</p>
<p>So I know that you were an early adopter of ESG investing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m curious, can you tell us a little bit more</p>
<p>about the specific framework that you use</p>
<p>when you make these investments decisions</p>
<p>since so many, so much can go</p>
<p>into an ESG investment portfolio.</p>
<p>And also not just tell us perhaps a little bit</p>
<p>about your framework, but also do you apply that lens</p>
<p>to your whole portfolio or just to certain funds?</p>
<ul>
<li>So Ann, just in terms of history, again,</li>
</ul>
<p>when Michele and I were at the World Bank,</p>
<p>which is a few years before you joined,</p>
<p>this word ESG started creeping into our language then.</p>
<p>And if you invested in emerging markets, you would know,</p>
<p>and both of you know very well that governance</p>
<p>is extremely important to invest</p>
<p>in a company that does not have good governance</p>
<p>or is not improving its governance</p>
<p>is probably a recipe for a disaster, right?</p>
<p>So the G of ESG was very, very big</p>
<p>when we started investing.</p>
<p>And this is like going back to a long time ago.</p>
<p>And then environmental was also early at the bank,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, because the bank</p>
<p>was getting involved earlier on cleaner energy</p>
<p>became a big thing.</p>
<p>So you would do environmental assessments of your projects.</p>
<p>And then social indicators were also important</p>
<p>in terms of looking at all kinds of health indicators</p>
<p>from child mortality</p>
<p>to education and indicators.</p>
<p>So all of those, I think the three of us were very fortunate</p>
<p>because as those indicators were developed,</p>
<p>we were sort of part of the dialogue.</p>
<p>And I think you yourself were very involved</p>
<p>in that in your time at the bank.</p>
<p>So that was sort of historically.</p>
<p>And fast forward to today,</p>
<p>whole industries are getting developed,</p>
<p>and there are many people who are measuring these.</p>
<p>And what we decided to do at RockCreek</p>
<p>is we realized that there is almost like religions,</p>
<p>like religious, you cannot get everyone to agree.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some people who use one system of ESG.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Bloomberg Sustainalytics.</p>
<p>There is MSCI.</p>
<p>There are many others.</p>
<p>And frankly, they lead to very different results.</p>
<p>And what we do in RockCreek is we have created</p>
<p>like a system that will use any</p>
<p>of these external systems,</p>
<p>but then we also have our own ratings</p>
<p>and try to apply those.</p>
<p>And ours are much simpler and more streamlined, I would say.</p>
<p>So I think the big issue</p>
<p>that you and I were talking about a little earlier about ESG</p>
<p>before we started in the more formal conversation</p>
<p>is that there is a lot of greenwashing going on</p>
<p>and it is reducing the faith of people in the whole subject.</p>
<p>And what we need to do is to make it simpler,</p>
<p>more easy to adopt and more easy to regulate</p>
<p>and incorporate it into our daily life</p>
<p>because I think your students know better than anyone else.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re choosing the place they live,</p>
<p>their transport mode, what they&rsquo;re wearing,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re eating very much based on environment</p>
<p>compared to their parents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>I totally agree with you that,</p>
<p>that the systems need to be more streamlined</p>
<p>and much more clear and transparent.</p>
<p>And so that would be a longer conversation</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure we would all love to have.</p>
<p>But in the interest of time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to move on to a totally different area.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the founder and CEO of RockCreek,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the largest diverse-owned investment companies</p>
<p>in the world with over 15 billion</p>
<p>in assets under management.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at the percentage of minority-owned</p>
<p>and women-owned firms and private equity, it is very low,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s larger</p>
<p>than in all the other asset classes.</p>
<p>So there are only 4.5%</p>
<p>of minority-owned companies</p>
<p>and 1.6% of companies</p>
<p>that do private equity</p>
<p>are run by women, which is incredible.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in that 1.6%.</p>
<p>Tell us a little bit about some of the biggest challenges</p>
<p>that you faced as an Iranian immigrant woman</p>
<p>in setting up your fund.</p>
<ul>
<li>So first of all, Ann,</li>
</ul>
<p>let me just tell you that one good news,</p>
<p>maybe it was the training at the World Bank,</p>
<p>was we learned not to take no for an answer.</p>
<p>So I think being, you know,</p>
<p>I think the polite word for it is resilience</p>
<p>is very important if you&rsquo;re building anything, right?</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re building a technical company</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re building an investment firm or anything else.</p>
<p>And if you truly believe that what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is something you&rsquo;re excited about,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to do some good,</p>
<p>not just for your own team but for the broader world</p>
<p>and the people you&rsquo;re serving,</p>
<p>I think it just makes it that much more fun</p>
<p>to do even on days where, you know, it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>because you go into a meeting and you realize</p>
<p>that because you look different,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not taken as seriously as somebody</p>
<p>who looks less different in that environment.</p>
<p>I have to tell you that while things have changed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re a little better today,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not completely, you know, perfect.</p>
<p>I would say that even now, even at our size,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;ve been around for a long time,</p>
<p>I find that it&rsquo;s still, you know,</p>
<p>not as difficult maybe as when I started out,</p>
<p>but certainly not as easy as it should be.</p>
<p>And one of the things we do at RockCreek,</p>
<p>we invest in a lot of new talent.</p>
<p>So believe it or not, the first five million</p>
<p>to a firm called Bridgewater,</p>
<p>that a lot of your audience has heard of,</p>
<p>came from the team at the World Bank.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been early in terms of finding new talent.</p>
<p>And new talent could be diverse or not diverse,</p>
<p>but two or three findings that we have.</p>
<p>Number one, we did a study with IFC,</p>
<p>which looked at private equity and venture investors</p>
<p>and we looked at emerging markets</p>
<p>because believe it or not, again,</p>
<p>this data does not exist in the US.</p>
<p>You cannot get data on gender</p>
<p>or any other kind of diversity</p>
<p>from Blackstone or Carlyle or KKR or any of those firms.</p>
<p>But IFC required anyone that they invested in</p>
<p>to keep this data.</p>
<p>So we had data of over 700 firms over 20 years</p>
<p>and sat down with IFC and with Oliver Wyman,</p>
<p>went through the data and found the following three things.</p>
<p>And we could only do gender because obviously,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s racial diversification since it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>all regions in emerging markets.</p>
<p>So number one, more women GPs</p>
<p>in emerging markets than the US.</p>
<p>Number two, gender balance team,</p>
<p>and balance is really important</p>
<p>because you want balance, right, in a team.</p>
<p>And by that we meant 30% of one gender represented led</p>
<p>to 20% higher return.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>And if you talk to Mary Meeker, you know,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in the Valley or any of the other women</p>
<p>who have done really well, they will tell you that,</p>
<p>you know, having a diverse team means</p>
<p>that they look at a broader set of investments</p>
<p>and they will question different things</p>
<p>and they will look at risk management differently.</p>
<p>So 20% is huge.</p>
<p>And then thirdly, if you have a diverse team,</p>
<p>like, you know, in this case it was gender,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to also invest</p>
<p>in underlying women on companies.</p>
<p>So all in all, I think that was a really interesting result</p>
<p>and we have huge databases at RockCreek</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been keeping.</p>
<p>And what I would love is if you have students</p>
<p>who are interested in internships or later on joining,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for really innovative,</p>
<p>high-energy dynamic students who are interested</p>
<p>in looking at this data more intelligently,</p>
<p>improving it, and then using it in investment decisions.</p>
<p>Because believe it or not, in the venture area,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little use of technology per se and data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information on specific,</p>
<p>you know, industries on data,</p>
<p>but looking at trends and using that in investing</p>
<p>is not as common and it&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that we are trying to improve.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I&rsquo;ll just say one thing,</p>
<p>which I think is very positive,</p>
<p>which is unlike private equity, as you said,</p>
<p>broader category of private investments</p>
<p>where it is very hard to start a new firm,</p>
<p>venture is probably one of the easier places</p>
<p>to start with a small amount of capital.</p>
<p>So if you can raise smaller amounts in venture,</p>
<p>which is also an area where you can be very impactful,</p>
<p>you can start much more easily.</p>
<p>In private equity, if you don&rsquo;t have in buyouts,</p>
<p>you know, several billion,</p>
<p>you probably won&rsquo;t be taken seriously.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been really exciting for us to do more</p>
<p>on the venture side, but I would also, you know,</p>
<p>let your students know that definitely one</p>
<p>of the more open areas for women and men</p>
<p>and diverse communities is venture today.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s really, really wonderful to hear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who are here in the room, did you all hear that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real role for a more quantitative approach</p>
<p>to venture capital and here we have the CEO</p>
<p>of a big company that&rsquo;s encouraging you</p>
<p>to work with RockCreek.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna shift the conversation a little bit more now</p>
<p>to the goal to reach net zero emissions globally.</p>
<p>What do you see as the role of private companies</p>
<p>in catalyzing the transition</p>
<p>to net zero emissions and sustainability?</p>
<p>And do you feel that the private sector</p>
<p>and financial institutions are leading the way</p>
<p>or can lead the way to net zero emissions?</p>
<ul>
<li>So Ann, I find that the interesting thing</li>
</ul>
<p>is that first of all the audience in your room</p>
<p>is the strongest group that is pushing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the new, you know,</p>
<p>younger generation that is really pushing the most,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the future consumers.</p>
<p>So companies are listening to who their existing consumers</p>
<p>and the future consumers are.</p>
<p>And so they are hearing</p>
<p>that they need to be much more impactful</p>
<p>and to be much more thoughtful about emission specifically,</p>
<p>which is something which is a little bit easier</p>
<p>to measure as they develop their product</p>
<p>or as they refine the systems</p>
<p>for production of existing goods.</p>
<p>So I think that is very much the case</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re finding is that some companies</p>
<p>and really, the best companies see</p>
<p>that it is more cost-effective,</p>
<p>less risky to move in this direction</p>
<p>and they also don&rsquo;t want to get stuck with stranded assets.</p>
<p>So whether they&rsquo;re insurance companies,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re financial companies</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re running other kinds of businesses,</p>
<p>they are looking at this much more effectively.</p>
<p>In practice, it was only really at the end of last year</p>
<p>and the beginning of this year where in the banking sector,</p>
<p>if you look at the numbers, just at banks,</p>
<p>the amount going into renewable energy</p>
<p>and into traditional oil and gas became equalized.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re still investing in oil and gas and coal.</p>
<p>They have not said they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And there was, as you remember,</p>
<p>in the last COP meeting in COP26,</p>
<p>there was a whole set of financial institutions</p>
<p>that signed up for GFANZ.</p>
<p>But in practice, some have backtracked</p>
<p>and some have not done very much on that front.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think what we need to do</p>
<p>is with the people in the room, again,</p>
<p>and your students at Berkeley and other universities</p>
<p>really improve measurement</p>
<p>so that we can hold people responsible</p>
<p>and introduce simple rules again to boardrooms</p>
<p>to hold their management more responsible.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re moving in the right direction</p>
<p>and if anything, I would say the younger people,</p>
<p>followed by corporations, followed by governments,</p>
<p>and followed by international organizations.</p>
<p>So COP is talking a lot,</p>
<p>but I wish that they will achieve more and implement more,</p>
<p>followed by governments, followed by, you know,</p>
<p>corporations and young people would be the direction</p>
<p>that you would see more happening versus less.</p>
<ul>
<li>So that&rsquo;s exciting.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real role for our community</p>
<p>to really make a difference in this area.</p>
<p>So along the lines of disclosure,</p>
<p>I wanna ask you about a specific proposal.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission,</p>
<p>which regulates financial markets,</p>
<p>has a proposed climate risk rule that would mandate</p>
<p>that companies describe on Form 10-K</p>
<p>their strategy towards climate risk.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just curious,</p>
<p>what do you think about the proposal</p>
<p>by the SEC to mandate disclosure in this area?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think I&rsquo;m very excited</li>
</ul>
<p>that they&rsquo;re asking for disclosure.</p>
<p>I think we were, you know,</p>
<p>like many others involved in giving comments to the SEC,</p>
<p>some of them we saw in their new ruling,</p>
<p>some we did not see.</p>
<p>But in terms of moving towards more information,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good for investors to see what&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>a company&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re investing in a company,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to get stuck with stranded assets</p>
<p>in five years or 10 years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s good risk management to do that.</p>
<p>I think the one thing that I would encourage, you know,</p>
<p>regulators to do though is to be careful</p>
<p>because the larger companies have diversity officers,</p>
<p>they have teams of diversity officers, they have teams</p>
<p>of impact and sustainability officers.</p>
<p>So they can, when they report,</p>
<p>they can make a pretty report, let&rsquo;s put it this way,</p>
<p>versus other companies who might be much more effective</p>
<p>in reducing emissions but they do not have the, you know,</p>
<p>impact officers and sustainability officers</p>
<p>to produce the beautiful reports.</p>
<p>So you need to make the rules</p>
<p>to be such that people who are, you know,</p>
<p>obviously, the Fortune 500 are doing a lot</p>
<p>and doing it better, but also smaller companies</p>
<p>are also moving in this direction,</p>
<p>not just the larger companies.</p>
<p>So I would try to simplify and one other thing</p>
<p>is that I think one unintended sort of experience</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve seen is some</p>
<p>of the smaller asset management firms</p>
<p>who have got dinged by regulators because again,</p>
<p>while they are very impactful,</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t have the resources</p>
<p>to report on it preferably.</p>
<p>And I think you have to be very careful if I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>you know, if I was in the shoes of the regulators</p>
<p>to differentiate between that versus a lot of people</p>
<p>who are greenwashing but are very effective in reporting.</p>
<p>And I hope that your students are learning the difference</p>
<p>between those two and hopefully with their values,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get better reporting in future in companies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for that insight</li>
</ul>
<p>on the differential regulatory impacts</p>
<p>on large versus small companies.</p>
<p>Now I wanna ask you a little bit</p>
<p>about a backlash against ESG.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve heard, and I&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>that you may have personal experience with this,</p>
<p>that some politicians are divesting from companies</p>
<p>whom they think aren&rsquo;t investing enough in fossil fuels.</p>
<p>So what do you think are the best ways</p>
<p>to get critics of ESG investing on board?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is such an interesting situation right now</li>
</ul>
<p>because you all are in California where, you know,</p>
<p>there has been a lot of investments in cleaner fuels</p>
<p>and just broadly sustainable energy.</p>
<p>And the other states that have been talking about,</p>
<p>like you said Ann,</p>
<p>not holding it against the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>I should tell you,</p>
<p>I was in one of the most interesting meetings</p>
<p>in May of this year in Texas</p>
<p>with people who had, you know, roles in universities,</p>
<p>very big endowments.</p>
<p>They were secretaries of energy from both parties.</p>
<p>There were people from all kinds of venues.</p>
<p>Anyways, I can&rsquo;t talk about details about that</p>
<p>but let me just tell you that a lot of the biggest CEOs</p>
<p>who own oil and gas,</p>
<p>their biggest investments now are in renewable energy.</p>
<p>So while the politicians in some of these states</p>
<p>are talking about oil and gas, in practice,</p>
<p>a lot of the business people</p>
<p>are investing in renewable energy</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where they see the future, right?</p>
<p>And if anything, they complain about how permitting</p>
<p>for renewable energy is slow.</p>
<p>I found that really interesting</p>
<p>to see the disconnect between the two.</p>
<p>And again, I think as the audience</p>
<p>for this conversation is thinking about this,</p>
<p>what you see is not quite what is happening.</p>
<p>And I think what it shows me</p>
<p>is that we need a lot more communication</p>
<p>between the politicians and the business people</p>
<p>from both sides of the aisle</p>
<p>and not being political about it</p>
<p>but being completely business like,</p>
<p>solar energy and wind energy.</p>
<p>I think Texas is the biggest producer</p>
<p>of wind energy, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>You would know better,</p>
<p>but they might be ahead of you in California,</p>
<p>on solar, they might be number two.</p>
<p>So I think I would look at what the numbers are</p>
<p>versus what the politicians are stating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so interesting that CEOs in Texas</p>
<p>of oil and gas companies are actually putting their bets</p>
<p>on wind and energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great to hear.</p>
<p>So this is my last question</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m going to turn it over to Michele</p>
<p>and those of you in the room who would like to ask questions</p>
<p>that maybe I haven&rsquo;t covered.</p>
<p>So my last question is many of our students, really,</p>
<p>are excited about the huge potential</p>
<p>of sustainable finance.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re curious, what do you look for in new hires,</p>
<p>other than the fact that you have a Haas MBA,</p>
<p>which is an amazing thing.</p>
<p>And also not just what do you look for,</p>
<p>but where do you think are some</p>
<p>of the really exciting opportunities for our students</p>
<p>who may wanna have an impact in sustainable finance?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think this is really the time</li>
</ul>
<p>where if this is your interest,</p>
<p>that is where the largest growth is</p>
<p>in terms of jobs opportunities.</p>
<p>And, you know, you are very fortunate</p>
<p>to be coming out of Haas and with this kind of background.</p>
<p>Most companies are looking for young people</p>
<p>who have both quantitative skills and qualitative skills</p>
<p>but also have this passion around sustainability.</p>
<p>And if you can bring those three things together,</p>
<p>I think you basically are unique</p>
<p>because a lot of people who have qualitative experience</p>
<p>around life and some people who have,</p>
<p>you know, just quantitative experience.</p>
<p>But if you bring the three, quantitative,</p>
<p>qualitative, and sustainability together,</p>
<p>I think you are very unique.</p>
<p>And whether you&rsquo;re looking at it from, again,</p>
<p>we talked about venture companies,</p>
<p>but the underlying companies that the venture companies</p>
<p>are investing in need the same skills, right?</p>
<p>And not just the venture firms</p>
<p>but private equity firms are all hiring people,</p>
<p>banks are all hiring people</p>
<p>who have this kind of background.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also the non-profits</p>
<p>and non-profits are trying to straddle</p>
<p>to do more impactful investments with returns in their,</p>
<p>not in their foundation endowment,</p>
<p>but also in the rest of their businesses.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re entering this job market at this very time</p>
<p>where certain things are going down like just pure,</p>
<p>you know, you see Amazon letting 10,000 people go off</p>
<p>or Twitter, you know, going through,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s various interesting changes.</p>
<p>And tech in general, you know, when it comes to software,</p>
<p>goes through a lot of transition</p>
<p>but the areas we talked about,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s sustainability is the growth area.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking, just go look at the Inflation Act</p>
<p>and see where it is driving resources to</p>
<p>and that gives you a really good indication also</p>
<p>of where resources are going in the next five, 10 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m going to let Michele take over.</p>
<p>I think this is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>If you have questions,</p>
<p>you can go to the mic and please identify yourselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ann, it&rsquo;s great to be with you</li>
</ul>
<p>and look forward to seeing you soon.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes, I look forward to seeing you too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much, Afsaneh.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have students lining up to ask questions</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to take advantage of my position</p>
<p>of standing in front of this microphone</p>
<p>to ask the first question.</p>
<p>And that is of your asset owners, whose assets you invest,</p>
<p>and in your firm, people talk about fossil fuel companies</p>
<p>becoming stranded assets.</p>
<p>Do you think that your asset owners</p>
<p>and other investors actually believe that?</p>
<p>Do they actually think we maybe should withdraw</p>
<p>from fossil fuel companies</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna become stranded?</p>
<p>Because one doesn&rsquo;t really see that happening.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I think there&rsquo;s plenty of people who are invested,</li>
</ul>
<p>as you said, in oil and gas.</p>
<p>And particularly, natural gas is a very complicated,</p>
<p>politically charged question right now</p>
<p>because as Europe is going through its crisis</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re short of natural gas.</p>
<p>The question is, you know,</p>
<p>should US and the rest of Europe produce more natural gas</p>
<p>or other places, Africa,</p>
<p>to push into replacing the Russian sources</p>
<p>in the short run as Europe is developing</p>
<p>its own solar and wind and potentially, modular nuclear,</p>
<p>or other forms of nuclear.</p>
<p>So that conversation is very, very hot as we speak</p>
<p>and probably around 10 trillion of investments</p>
<p>will go into just Europe over the next,</p>
<p>you know, decade or so</p>
<p>in revamping their whole energy sector,</p>
<p>which was very based on, as you know, Russian natural gas.</p>
<p>So the short term versus the longer term conversations</p>
<p>are really important when it comes to hydrocarbons</p>
<p>versus clean energy.</p>
<p>And as you see in a lot of developed countries,</p>
<p>oil and gas, particularly natural gas is getting resources.</p>
<p>I would say, Michele, though,</p>
<p>that in a lot of oil companies,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;re renaming themselves,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re changing their names from oil and gas</p>
<p>to energy companies, right?</p>
<p>And their R and D groups and their groups</p>
<p>that are investing in new technologies</p>
<p>are increasing and getting more resources.</p>
<p>So you should follow where the money is going</p>
<p>in those companies.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, more and more,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing the money going towards investing</p>
<p>in new technologies rather than the old oil and gas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not giving up on the existing oil and gas</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not spending a lot on exploration production</p>
<p>or exploration, really, because some of these</p>
<p>and a lot of the cleaner energy is just cheaper.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Michele] Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just stranded</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>because people believe they should not,</p>
<p>you know, use coal or they should not use oil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more because, you know,</p>
<p>if you get solar that is cheaper,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the power generation will come from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the utilities will go</p>
<p>to source their energy for power.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I get a different picture reading the FT energy section</p>
<p>but okay, we have a student.</p>
<p>Remember to introduce yourself, please.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, thanks for coming here today.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Charlie, a first year MBA student,</p>
<p>and I wanted to ask about nuclear energy.</p>
<p>So you mentioned IRA, right?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s roughly half a billion earmarked</p>
<p>for nuclear energy specifically in the US</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m wondering what your view is</p>
<p>on both fission and fusion&rsquo;s role</p>
<p>in the future of energy throughout the world,</p>
<p>what we should be doing today,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve seen with all of the recent investments</p>
<p>in fusion over the last two, three years</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s, you know, tripled</p>
<p>and just kind of curious what your thoughts are around it.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I have to tell you first my prejudice</li>
</ul>
<p>was not positive about nuclear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve learned more in recently</p>
<p>and I continue to learn.</p>
<p>The reason I was not positive was around two reasons.</p>
<p>One is the waste management aspects that we all know.</p>
<p>Where do you keep the waste?</p>
<p>And how do you deal with the waste?</p>
<p>And the other one was we have seen the accidents</p>
<p>around nuclear energy around locations</p>
<p>in Japan or the US or elsewhere,</p>
<p>where you have very highly skilled technicians.</p>
<p>And everything that I learned when I did try</p>
<p>to learn about nuclear power plants</p>
<p>and went to visit them was the quality</p>
<p>of the technical staff who run these</p>
<p>is not just designing them</p>
<p>but the actual running them is really important.</p>
<p>So, so long as you have high quality trained people</p>
<p>to do it, it&rsquo;s fine and otherwise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not fine and it&rsquo;s very dangerous</p>
<p>to the environment around them.</p>
<p>And that was why I always felt</p>
<p>since that could not be confirmed,</p>
<p>especially if you went out of the, you know,</p>
<p>G7 countries, the more developed countries,</p>
<p>then maybe it&rsquo;s better not to look at it.</p>
<p>More recently, we&rsquo;re all hearing about</p>
<p>and some of these IRAs going</p>
<p>into what is called modular nuclear, which is smaller.</p>
<p>So think of these community solar plants</p>
<p>where you get solar plants</p>
<p>to go to solar energy for communities.</p>
<p>Similar idea with nuclear where there is less wastage,</p>
<p>there is less possibility of anything dangerous happening.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need the same kind of technical know-how.</p>
<p>There are few US companies</p>
<p>that are developing this technology.</p>
<p>They still have not really been used</p>
<p>in any scale or anything.</p>
<p>So I think we should definitely watch</p>
<p>to see how that is going.</p>
<p>And I think it will be very interesting both,</p>
<p>like you said, to watch the technology on fusion</p>
<p>and fission and see what is getting used</p>
<p>in scale versus not scale.</p>
<p>In terms of the bigger nuclear,</p>
<p>as you know in places like Germany,</p>
<p>they had a rule not to touch it,</p>
<p>but even there, they&rsquo;re looking at it</p>
<p>as one of the many alternatives.</p>
<p>So just depends on how fast some of the other things</p>
<p>like green hydrogen or other forms of innovation move</p>
<p>and how cheap they become.</p>
<p>So people will look at the cost of nuclear,</p>
<p>which is not cheap, by the way,</p>
<p>versus the costs of the renewable energy</p>
<p>as is known right now and new sources of renewable energy</p>
<p>that are getting developed.</p>
<p>So nuclear, I think will, you know,</p>
<p>people will continue to look at it</p>
<p>but I think most people still don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to have the very large-scale nuclear plants</p>
<p>next to their houses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Student] Awesome, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Michele] Thank you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Introduce yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, I&rsquo;m a second year MBA,</li>
</ul>
<p>also an exchange student from London Business School.</p>
<p>My background is mainly been in the clean energy space</p>
<p>from a financial advisory point of view.</p>
<p>Thank you for your talk today.</p>
<p>My question was around the investment side</p>
<p>in terms of ESG integration.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ve talked about particularly how ESG factors</p>
<p>into selecting these investments.</p>
<p>So we talked about accelerating the renewable energy space</p>
<p>and other clean tech.</p>
<p>I guess on the other side of ESG integration</p>
<p>beyond impact measurement,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re talking about, like, adding value.</p>
<p>Could you talk to a few examples where your fund</p>
<p>has added value from an ESG perspective,</p>
<p>particularly maybe later state kind of more akin</p>
<p>to like private equity?</p>
<ul>
<li>So I mean, one of the things we look at</li>
</ul>
<p>in all of these is obviously looking</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a clean energy technology</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s, you know, a renewable source of energy.</p>
<p>Obviously, we look at the carbon emissions</p>
<p>and that is sort of the, I don&rsquo;t wanna say straightforward,</p>
<p>but a little bit easier to measure, right?</p>
<p>I think the other things in terms of value</p>
<p>that are harder to measure</p>
<p>is, let&rsquo;s say, job creation, right?</p>
<p>How many jobs have we created?</p>
<p>And for some of our clients, that really matters.</p>
<p>So in terms of value,</p>
<p>what are you adding beyond the emissions?</p>
<p>And there we do measure if we are creating new jobs</p>
<p>that did not exist before,</p>
<p>what kind of training programs we are providing.</p>
<p>And so I think that is important.</p>
<p>We look at the value if some of the places</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re investing is more economically backward areas</p>
<p>that do not have the same, you know, situation as others.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at some solar plants as we speak</p>
<p>in Georgia and elsewhere on blighted agriculture land</p>
<p>where there is no alternative to either using it</p>
<p>for agriculture or anything else.</p>
<p>And as solar comes in, it&rsquo;ll really reduce energy costs</p>
<p>for population that it will make, you know,</p>
<p>it will be meaningful, as well as using this land</p>
<p>that could not have been used.</p>
<p>So those are some of the places, but I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s answering your question exactly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think it does answer it to some extent.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it sounds like it&rsquo;s mainly impact measurement tracking</p>
<p>and then kind of socially in terms of job,</p>
<p>increasing jobs and reporting on that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Afsaneh] Absolutely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Michele] Thank you. - [Afsaneh] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Afsaneh, thank you so much</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>for coming to guest speak for us at Haas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer Yen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a senior undergrad student here</p>
<p>and I have two questions.</p>
<p>So first one, what do you think as the end goal of ESG?</p>
<p>Basically, how does it play out in maybe 10 or 20 years</p>
<p>in the US or in the developing countries?</p>
<p>I think second question is,</p>
<p>you mentioned about addressing the greenwashing issues</p>
<p>about some, like, ESG funds.</p>
<p>And what do you think are some good criteria</p>
<p>that come into the ESG investment process</p>
<p>that make sure that our investments</p>
<p>are actually making the impact that we want?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, Jennifer, for these great questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you my hope and dream</p>
<p>is that we won&rsquo;t have these terms like ESG,</p>
<p>that you and your friends in your class and others</p>
<p>in your position will make sure</p>
<p>that everything we&rsquo;re doing is good for the environment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got good governance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, you are running diverse boards,</p>
<p>diverse companies and you are trying to not,</p>
<p>you know, when I look at S, for example,</p>
<p>we are in a very highly</p>
<p>inflationary environment right now, right?</p>
<p>Every time you open the newspapers people will say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wages are going up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the way, we know that wages have gone up less,</p>
<p>a lot less than inflation has in the last 12 months, right?</p>
<p>But they will talk about how the labor market is tight</p>
<p>and as wages go up, that will be highly inflationary.</p>
<p>However, there is not scenario where you say,</p>
<p>well, wages could go up a little bit more,</p>
<p>at least to meet inflation, but profits could come down.</p>
<p>It means that some of the stakeholders will make less money,</p>
<p>i.e., the shareholders in the company,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll still make profit.</p>
<p>The labor will get paid more decent wage</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;re coming out of this inflationary period,</p>
<p>actually, they won&rsquo;t be hit with big debt</p>
<p>and they will consume more,</p>
<p>which means we will have more economic growth.</p>
<p>And so when we talk about the S,</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s a very practical, real thing, you know?</p>
<p>And so when I hear many economies talking about wages</p>
<p>creating inflation is spiraled</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t talk about profit margins,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something wrong in that conversation</p>
<p>because all of these end up, you know,</p>
<p>to be inflationary and you have to have productivity,</p>
<p>capital, labor and technology</p>
<p>and all these other costs and profit margins,</p>
<p>all look at it as one, not, you know, individually.</p>
<p>So the reason I say that</p>
<p>is I think we&rsquo;re still sort of moving out of a world,</p>
<p>where having a decent wage was not something</p>
<p>that people thought about.</p>
<p>And I think as we move to a world</p>
<p>where people believe in truly paying people a decent wage</p>
<p>and to have, you know, your environment be,</p>
<p>everywhere, be the environment you want around yourself,</p>
<p>where your breathing air and you have clean water to drink</p>
<p>for everybody and you have good governance,</p>
<p>i.e., people hire people like you and me</p>
<p>and others in your audience,</p>
<p>then I think companies will not use,</p>
<p>hopefully use the term ESG.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sorry to be a little long-winded on that,</p>
<p>but hopefully the term ESG will go away</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>That would be if we&rsquo;re really successful.</p>
<p>And it sort of brings you to the greenwashing subject</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be faster on that</p>
<p>because I think on the greenwashing,</p>
<p>I think you just have to hold people up</p>
<p>to what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And the more you can measure what is getting done</p>
<p>versus their reports, you know,</p>
<p>and holding people responsible to a few factors.</p>
<p>You know, what did you do for emissions yourself</p>
<p>in your own company?</p>
<p>What did you do on diversity internally?</p>
<p>What did you do on, but specifically with greenwashing,</p>
<p>which is about the environment,</p>
<p>the two or three factors that are important</p>
<p>on the environmental side, holding them responsible,</p>
<p>I think, will be the best way to deal with that</p>
<p>versus letting them just say,</p>
<p>we are moving towards improving, you know, our emissions,</p>
<p>which is just too fuzzy.</p>
<p>So I think that would be my answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So really helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we have one more question?</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have time, Afsaneh, for one more question?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Afsaneh] I can do one more question, yes,</li>
</ul>
<p>if there is one more.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello, my name is Joseph, I&rsquo;m a second year MBA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And I have a question</p>
<p>about kind of managing VC expectations.</p>
<p>So climate tech startups</p>
<p>have different looking economies of scale,</p>
<p>different looking economics than tech companies,</p>
<p>but there has been so much tech and VC relation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been going on.</p>
<p>As a climate tech startup,</p>
<p>how should you manage those VC expectations</p>
<p>a little bit differently,</p>
<p>given that you&rsquo;re going to have higher capital costs</p>
<p>than a more traditional software-based tech startup?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think, so great question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that is why there are a lot</p>
<p>of climate tech venture firms that are getting created,</p>
<p>that are specialized just in climate tech.</p>
<p>So I think they obviously will be much more sensitive</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re saying versus the more general venture firms</p>
<p>that are investing across the board</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking at everything at the same time.</p>
<p>So obviously, the two will look</p>
<p>at the cost of capital differently, right?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re investing in climate tech,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking across different investments</p>
<p>across that sector,</p>
<p>and looking at what is sort of your best ideas.</p>
<p>The other thing is that if you look at the other companies,</p>
<p>you know, the broader larger venture firms</p>
<p>that invest across areas,</p>
<p>they already have a lot in software, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re trying to diversify.</p>
<p>No question they&rsquo;ll look at the cost of capital,</p>
<p>and in general, the cost of capital has gone up from zero.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that issue, which is affecting everything.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that will be the issue</p>
<p>in terms of investing in climate</p>
<p>just because they also see where money is going</p>
<p>and they will follow money, so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, everybody, for your questions.</p>
<p>And Afsaneh, thank you so much for joining us today.</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s a huge amount of appreciation</p>
<p>among our students.</p>
<p>I expect to see you flooded with letters saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I come work for you?</p>
<p>Sounds like such an interesting firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So thank you very much.</p>
<p>We really appreciate having you with us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, Michele.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, really thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
