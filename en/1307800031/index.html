Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 29, the Anglo-Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to explore the invasion of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And specifically, we&rsquo;re going to look at the period from around the year 410, when</p>
<p>the Roman Empire abandoned Britain, until around the year 600.</p>
<p>These two centuries are sometimes called the lost centuries of British history because</p>
<p>so little is known about what happened with any certainty.</p>
<p>As we know by now, the Anglo-Saxons were illiterate, so they didn&rsquo;t keep a chronicle of events</p>
<p>as they happened.</p>
<p>The few written accounts that we do have come from a small handful of individuals, mostly</p>
<p>monks and bishops, who wrote in Latin.</p>
<p>So in this episode, we&rsquo;ll explore those bits and pieces of information, and we&rsquo;ll try to</p>
<p>piece together what happened during those two centuries in which a large portion of</p>
<p>Britain passed to the Anglo-Saxons, and in the process, began to speak the language of</p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>But before I begin, I wanted to mention that I&rsquo;ve completely redesigned the website for</p>
<p>the podcast, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>The new website is specifically designed to work with any media device, so it&rsquo;ll automatically</p>
<p>work with a PC or tablet, smartphone, or any other media device with access to the web.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also taken the opportunity to reconfigure and remaster some of the old episodes, and</p>
<p>I saved them to a new server.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to release a bonus episode before the next regular episode of the podcast, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to listen to that episode because I&rsquo;m going to be changing the feed for the</p>
<p>podcast, and that bonus episode will explain what that means to you if you&rsquo;re a subscriber.</p>
<p>For most of you, it won&rsquo;t mean very much at all, but for some of you, it could affect</p>
<p>your current subscription.</p>
<p>So again, just be sure to check out that next bonus episode, and all will be explained.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s turn to the Anglo-Saxons, the people who brought us the language which we</p>
<p>call Old English.</p>
<p>As I noted, it&rsquo;s very common for many histories of Britain to sort of skip through the next</p>
<p>two centuries.</p>
<p>They often note that the Anglo-Saxons arrived in Britain around the year 450, and over the</p>
<p>next century and a half, they displaced the native Celtic-speaking people and established</p>
<p>several new Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.</p>
<p>And while there&rsquo;s some very interesting stories about what happened during this period, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>difficult to determine how much is legend and how much is actual history.</p>
<p>For example, the ultimate origins of the story of King Arthur date from this period.</p>
<p>But even today, historians disagree as to whether there really was a leader named Arthur</p>
<p>who fought against the invading Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Ironically, Arthur was originally said to be a leader who fought against the English</p>
<p>or Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>It would take many centuries for the stories of Arthur to develop into the full-fledged</p>
<p>legend of King Arthur that we have today, and that&rsquo;s the real problem with this period</p>
<p>of history, separating fact from legend.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to approach this period of history by turning to the actual sources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take you through what we actually know about this period, based upon the various</p>
<p>scraps of evidence that we have, including both the limited written evidence and the</p>
<p>archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>So this episode will be a true history episode.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll begin the story with the year 410, the year that the crumbling Roman Empire abandoned</p>
<p>Britain.</p>
<p>With the Romans focused on events taking place in continental Europe, the Romanized Britons</p>
<p>had to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>And there were lots of challenges on the horizon.</p>
<p>The Picts and the Scots were threatening from the north, and various Germanic tribes like</p>
<p>the Angles and Saxons were threatening from the south and the east.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider what things were like around this time in southern and central Britain.</p>
<p>First of all, since this is a podcast about language, let&rsquo;s consider what the region</p>
<p>was like linguistically.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Romans a few centuries earlier, the use of Latin had spread throughout</p>
<p>Roman Britain, but its influence was greatest in the towns and cities, where Roman influences</p>
<p>in general were greater.</p>
<p>Latin was made the official language of Roman Britain, and that meant that the governing</p>
<p>classes and administrators spoke Latin.</p>
<p>And many of the soldiers stationed there spoke Latin as well.</p>
<p>And the traders who passed through the region, a lot of them also spoke Latin.</p>
<p>And even some of the better educated natives learned and spoke Latin.</p>
<p>But all of that basically meant that Latin was spoken in and around the Roman-occupied</p>
<p>towns and cities.</p>
<p>But outside of the towns and cities, out in the rural areas, most Britons continued to</p>
<p>speak the native Celtic languages.</p>
<p>And even though Latin was more common in the towns and cities, we have to keep in mind</p>
<p>what we mean by the term city during this period.</p>
<p>Even during this early period, London was the most important city in Britain, but it</p>
<p>only had a population of about 30,000 people, and the entire city only covered about 300</p>
<p>acres.</p>
<p>So cities were just small towns by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>And the number of people who lived in towns and cities, as a percentage of the overall</p>
<p>population, well it was much smaller than it is today.</p>
<p>So that meant that even though Latin was the official language of Britain, it was always</p>
<p>a minority language.</p>
<p>The Celtic languages were spoken by far more people, even during the heyday of Roman Britain.</p>
<p>And this is a very important point as we compare the situation here to the situation in continental</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>On the continent, where the Romans had arrived earlier, and where Roman influence was greater,</p>
<p>the Latin language had begun to replace the native Celtic languages by this point.</p>
<p>But in Britain, Latin never enjoyed the same degree of influence.</p>
<p>It was a prominent language among the elite and the educated and the bureaucrats, but</p>
<p>those people mainly lived in the towns and cities.</p>
<p>And when those towns began to decline after the Roman Empire abandoned the island, Latin</p>
<p>slowly gave way to the native Celtic languages, which dominated the rural areas.</p>
<p>And that process was accelerated when the Anglo-Saxons arrived and began to sack the</p>
<p>towns and cities, and in the process, displaced many of those Latin-speaking elites.</p>
<p>And this is a very important reason why the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons took</p>
<p>root in Britain.</p>
<p>And remember that Britain is really the exception to the rule here.</p>
<p>Pretty much everywhere else in the former Western Roman Empire, Latin held firm.</p>
<p>When the Franks conquered Gaul, and the Goths conquered modern-day Spain and Italy, Latin</p>
<p>continued to be the dominant languages in those regions.</p>
<p>But Latin was never as ingrained in Britain.</p>
<p>It was a minority language, and it would continue to be a minority language.</p>
<p>Before we move on from the language issue, let me mention a few things about the native</p>
<p>Celtic languages in the British Isles.</p>
<p>Though all of these languages are generally grouped together under the general heading</p>
<p>of Celtic languages, linguists have noticed distinct differences between the Celtic languages</p>
<p>that were spoken in Britain, and the Celtic languages which were spoken to the West, in</p>
<p>Ireland.</p>
<p>And this is not really surprising, because we&rsquo;re dealing with two different islands,</p>
<p>and both groups were somewhat isolated from each other over many centuries.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that the northern part of Britain was home to the people called the</p>
<p>Picts, who were likely native people who predated the arrival of the Celtic-speaking people.</p>
<p>Now around the time the Romans were leaving Britain, a group of Celtic-speaking people</p>
<p>from Ireland called the Scots began to settle in northwestern Britain.</p>
<p>Over several centuries, the Scots overcame the Picts, and the Picts were assimilated</p>
<p>into the Scots.</p>
<p>And this is the ultimate origin of Scotland.</p>
<p>And that means that the Celtic language of the Scots, called Gaelic, is very closely</p>
<p>related to the Celtic language of the Irish.</p>
<p>The Celtic language spoken in the Isle of Man, in this same general region, called Manx,</p>
<p>is also part of this same subfamily.</p>
<p>So all of these languages are descended from that original form of Celtic which was spoken</p>
<p>in Ireland.</p>
<p>But remember that that particular form of Celtic was different from the Celtic dialects</p>
<p>spoken in Britain.</p>
<p>So the Gaelic language of the Scots displaced the native language of the Picts in the north,</p>
<p>and the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons displaced the native Celtic languages in central</p>
<p>and southern Britain.</p>
<p>That left the Celtic languages in the far west of Britain, in the region we know today</p>
<p>as Wales.</p>
<p>And it also left the Celtic language in the southwestern peninsula of Britain, known as</p>
<p>Cornwall.</p>
<p>Now Welsh still survives today, but Cornish no longer exists as a spoken language.</p>
<p>So these languages in western Britain were descended from the Celtic languages spoken</p>
<p>in Britain when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, and they form part of a separate subfamily</p>
<p>of Celtic languages.</p>
<p>And I wanted to make that point because even though Scottish Gaelic is spoken today in</p>
<p>northern Britain, it isn&rsquo;t actually descended from the original Celtic languages of Britain.</p>
<p>Its roots are in Ireland.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve looked at the general decline of Latin relative to the native Celtic languages.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just the language of the Romans that was beginning to decline during this</p>
<p>period around the year 410.</p>
<p>The economy and the culture of the Romans was also beginning to experience a general</p>
<p>decline.</p>
<p>Back in episode 19, I discussed the Romanization of Britain, and I mentioned how the economy</p>
<p>of the region had actually flourished in the decades and centuries that followed the arrival</p>
<p>of the Romans.</p>
<p>Roman-style marketplaces were built, new roads were constructed, trade with the empire increased,</p>
<p>and Roman coins poured into Britain, which meant that the Romanized Britons began to</p>
<p>use a common international currency.</p>
<p>And this currency largely replaced the old barter system.</p>
<p>But after 410, when the Roman Empire pulled out of Britain, all of those developments</p>
<p>gradually began to fade away.</p>
<p>Roman coins began to disappear since Roman mints were no longer providing Britain with</p>
<p>new coins.</p>
<p>Within a couple of decades, Roman coins had stopped being used on a regular basis, and</p>
<p>the people had returned to barter as the primary means of exchange.</p>
<p>In the years after the Romans arrived, a massive pottery industry had developed in Britain.</p>
<p>But shortly after 410, the pottery industry collapsed, and the high-quality Roman pottery</p>
<p>stopped being produced.</p>
<p>During the Roman period, the people of Britain had become accustomed to all the benefits</p>
<p>and comforts of Roman civilization.</p>
<p>At least in the cities, they had running water, and public baths, and a variety of luxury</p>
<p>items.</p>
<p>But many of these things were starting to disappear, and they wouldn&rsquo;t return for over</p>
<p>a thousand years.</p>
<p>They might not have realized it at the time, but the native Britons had really become dependent</p>
<p>on the Romans.</p>
<p>The Romans provided them with the benefits of Roman civilization, but just as importantly,</p>
<p>they provided them with the benefits of Roman troops and defenses.</p>
<p>So the native Romano-Britons weren&rsquo;t accustomed to fighting in their own defense.</p>
<p>And this was in stark contrast to the warriors who had been invading from the north and the</p>
<p>west, the Picts and the Scots, especially the Picts.</p>
<p>The Picts up in modern-day Scotland had been a long-term threat, even to the Roman troops.</p>
<p>The Romans had constructed Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall across the entire width of the island to keep</p>
<p>the Picts out.</p>
<p>And as long as the Romans manned the wall, it was effective.</p>
<p>But when Rome left Britain to its own defenses after 410, the wall was abandoned, and the</p>
<p>Picts poured across it.</p>
<p>And the Celtic-speaking Scots from Ireland were also joining in the invasions and adding</p>
<p>to those problems.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the reason why 410 is often cited as the year when Rome abandoned Britain</p>
<p>is because that was the year when the Britons asked Rome for help in fighting the Picts.</p>
<p>And Rome said, sorry, we&rsquo;ve got our hands full with the Goths and other tribes here</p>
<p>on the continent.</p>
<p>Now, even though the Pictish threat was growing to the north, the native Romano-Britons fared</p>
<p>pretty well for a while.</p>
<p>And even the economy held on for a couple of decades.</p>
<p>And the reason why we know that the decline was actually very gradual at first is because</p>
<p>we have a written account from around the year 429, which gives us our first insight</p>
<p>into the situation in Britain in the years after the Romans abandoned the island.</p>
<p>Around that year, 429, a couple of decades after the Romans left, a bishop named Germanus</p>
<p>arrived in Britain from Gaul.</p>
<p>And a second-hand written account of his trip provides some details about the situation</p>
<p>on the ground.</p>
<p>The account was written a few decades later as part of a general biography of Germanus.</p>
<p>And it indicates that he encountered a mostly wealthy island, that&rsquo;s a quote, with communities</p>
<p>that were still thriving.</p>
<p>Trade at the port in London, which was then called Londinium, was still active.</p>
<p>People were still making and selling local crafts.</p>
<p>Biography also indicates that there were many highly educated people and that many of them</p>
<p>could speak Latin.</p>
<p>So at least a couple of decades later, things hadn&rsquo;t changed all that much.</p>
<p>But the account also indicates that there were foreign invaders on the horizon.</p>
<p>And that included both Picts and Saxons.</p>
<p>The Britons were actively engaged in fighting them.</p>
<p>But the Picts were only a threat in the northern border regions.</p>
<p>And the Saxons were only a threat along the coast.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t really considered a threat to the fortified towns at this point.</p>
<p>Now Germanus arrived as a preacher.</p>
<p>But he had previously been a soldier and military governor in Gaul.</p>
<p>And while in Britain, he reorganized the local militias and he taught them how to fight battles</p>
<p>in the traditional Roman fashion.</p>
<p>According to his biography, he actually led a group of Britons in a successful battle</p>
<p>against Saxon invaders during this period.</p>
<p>Now we don&rsquo;t know for certain whether that story is true.</p>
<p>But we can take from this account that the Britons were fighting the invaders and apparently</p>
<p>having some success at this early point.</p>
<p>Now unfortunately, that&rsquo;s about all we get from the biography of Germanus.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s enough to get a general sense that Britain was still doing okay a couple of decades</p>
<p>after the Empire abandoned the region.</p>
<p>And this account is consistent with the archaeological evidence as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence of any permanent Saxon settlements in Britain until around the years</p>
<p>430 to 440.</p>
<p>So that would be the decade after Germanus visited.</p>
<p>And even then, those original settlements were very sparse.</p>
<p>So for a few decades, the decline of Britain was very gradual and the outside threats were</p>
<p>managed.</p>
<p>After Germanus left, we don&rsquo;t have a contemporary written account from within Britain itself</p>
<p>for over a century.</p>
<p>So it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint exactly what happened next.</p>
<p>But it appears that the Saxon and Pictish invasions increased significantly in the next</p>
<p>few years after Germanus left.</p>
<p>And for the first time, the archaeological evidence confirms the existence of permanent</p>
<p>Saxon settlements.</p>
<p>Those settlements began to pop up during the decade that followed that visit by Germanus.</p>
<p>So what happened after Germanus left?</p>
<p>Did the Saxons simply overwhelm the Britons?</p>
<p>Well, maybe.</p>
<p>Our next piece of evidence is a letter written sometime between 446 and 454 by a group of</p>
<p>Britons to a Roman general in Gaul who was busy trying to repel Attila the Hun from that</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>The letter was a plea for help and it was quoted by later writers like Gildas and Bede,</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ll discuss later.</p>
<p>The letter was addressed to this particular general in Gaul who was in power there from</p>
<p>446 to 454.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we have a general time frame for the date of that letter.</p>
<p>So that means the letter was written around 20 years after Germanus left, give or take</p>
<p>a few years.</p>
<p>The letter was titled, The Groans of the British.</p>
<p>And it read,</p>
<p>The barbarians drive us to the sea.</p>
<p>The sea throws us back on the barbarians.</p>
<p>Thus two modes of death await us, we&rsquo;re either slain or drowned.</p>
<p>So obviously the Romano-Britons were under attack around this time, around the year 450.</p>
<p>And this letter was a desperate plea for help.</p>
<p>But the Roman general in Gaul had his hands full with Attila.</p>
<p>So once again the Romans were of no help.</p>
<p>Now we don&rsquo;t have a copy of this particular letter today.</p>
<p>We only know it through these later writers.</p>
<p>But since it was quoted, historians believe the letter actually existed and those later</p>
<p>writers had access to it, or at least a copy of it.</p>
<p>And this particular letter may actually be pinpointing the time when the Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>invasion was beginning to explode across eastern and southern Britain.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll see shortly, later historians also identify this period, the middle of the</p>
<p>fifth century, as the real beginning of the Anglo-Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>So from the account of Germanus&rsquo;s visit around 429 to this particular letter which was written</p>
<p>sometime around 450, the situation had changed dramatically in Britain.</p>
<p>So what happened during this intervening 20-year period to cause the situation to deteriorate</p>
<p>so much?</p>
<p>At the beginning of that period Roman society still existed in Britain, at least in the</p>
<p>inland cities, and the foreign threats were manageable.</p>
<p>But now they were desperate for help.</p>
<p>But who were these invaders?</p>
<p>Were they Picts and Scots pouring in from the north?</p>
<p>Or were they Saxons invading from the coast?</p>
<p>Or were they both?</p>
<p>Well we have another written source from this same general time frame which sheds some light</p>
<p>on that question.</p>
<p>Around this time in Gaul, a chronicle was being maintained.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know for certain who wrote the chronicle, but it likely originated from a</p>
<p>monastery in southern Gaul.</p>
<p>The original manuscript has long since been lost, but it survives in the form of a later</p>
<p>medieval French copy from the 9th or 10th century.</p>
<p>The chronicle is called the Gallic Chronicle of 452, because that&rsquo;s the year of the last</p>
<p>entry.</p>
<p>But it contains entries for earlier years as well.</p>
<p>And for the year 441, the chronicle contains the following entry.</p>
<p>The Britons, which to this time had suffered from various disasters and misfortunes, are</p>
<p>reduced to the power of the Saxons.</p>
<p>So according to this chronicle, the Gallic Chronicle, it was the Saxons who were in the</p>
<p>process of conquering the island.</p>
<p>And presumably it was the Saxon threat which led to that letter to the Roman general in</p>
<p>Gaul around the same time.</p>
<p>Now modern historians have a field day with these dates.</p>
<p>As I said, the chronicle itself is dated to the year 452.</p>
<p>So that time is completely consistent with the letter pleading for help.</p>
<p>But the chronicle places the entry I just read under the year 441, a decade earlier.</p>
<p>Now most later historians have tended to dismiss this date of 441 as being a little too early</p>
<p>given the other sources.</p>
<p>And in fact the dates for other events in the Gallic Chronicle are indeed off by a few</p>
<p>years given other more reliable sources.</p>
<p>But I just wanted to note that this is one of the sources relied upon by those who believe</p>
<p>that the Saxon conquest happened a little bit earlier.</p>
<p>For our purposes it isn&rsquo;t really important to put a specific date on the events.</p>
<p>And as I discussed in the last episode, the Anglo-Saxon conquest was a gradual event.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t just begin in one particular year.</p>
<p>So rather than focusing on the dating inconsistencies, the more important point is that this Gallic</p>
<p>Chronicle confirms that the plea for help around 450 occurred at the same time that</p>
<p>the Saxons were conquering the island.</p>
<p>And both of those documents paint the same picture of native Britons rapidly falling</p>
<p>to the invading Saxons.</p>
<p>But again, they don&rsquo;t provide us with any real details.</p>
<p>But we do have some archaeological evidence from this same time period.</p>
<p>As I noted, the archaeological evidence confirms the existence of the first permanent Saxon</p>
<p>settlements in Britain during this period.</p>
<p>So we know that the Saxons were no longer just raiding.</p>
<p>They were now settling in Britain and becoming permanent residents.</p>
<p>In fact, about 30 years ago, a small gold medallion was found in a field near Suffolk</p>
<p>in eastern England.</p>
<p>Archaeologists believe the medallion was dropped or buried there between the years 450 and</p>
<p>480.</p>
<p>So right in this same time frame.</p>
<p>The same time frame as the Gallic Chronicle and that letter to the Roman general in Gaul</p>
<p>pleading for help.</p>
<p>Now what&rsquo;s interesting about this particular medallion is that it bears a Germanic runic</p>
<p>inscription, which reads,</p>
<p>This she-wolf is a reward to my kinsmen.</p>
<p>Now it may not be Shakespeare, but it is the earliest known Anglo-Saxon inscription in</p>
<p>Britain.</p>
<p>And that makes it the first known sentence in the English language.</p>
<p>And that means that English was on the ground, literally on the ground, around the year 450</p>
<p>or soon thereafter.</p>
<p>The archaeological evidence also shows that some Britons were beginning to flee the southern</p>
<p>coast of Britain during this period.</p>
<p>And they were actually beginning to head south across the Channel into northern Gaul.</p>
<p>If the Roman general in Gaul wouldn&rsquo;t come to their aid, well, they would just head to</p>
<p>Gaul where maybe they would be safe from the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>These Britons established a new home in the northwestern part of Gaul.</p>
<p>And this region came to be known as Brittany.</p>
<p>And that name&rsquo;s not a coincidence.</p>
<p>The name Brittany comes from the fact that it was settled by refugees from Britain.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s evidence that both regions were called Britannia very early on.</p>
<p>Now in an upcoming episode, I&rsquo;m going to look at the expansion of the Franks throughout</p>
<p>northern Gaul and the impact that their language had on French and then later had on English.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m going to explore the etymology of a lot of English words, which can be traced</p>
<p>back to the Germanic Franks.</p>
<p>But for now, we just need to keep in mind that the Frankish invasion of Gaul was happening</p>
<p>around the same time as the early Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain.</p>
<p>But at the same time that the Franks were expanding westward, the fleeing Britons were</p>
<p>expanding into the same general region in the northern part of Gaul.</p>
<p>So the emerging region of Brittany in northwestern Gaul remained distinct from the expanding</p>
<p>Frankish territory.</p>
<p>And we get another scrap of written evidence from around this same time period which confirms</p>
<p>that the exodus from Britain to northern Gaul was occurring.</p>
<p>The evidence comes to us in the form of two letters written by a bishop in Gaul.</p>
<p>The bishop&rsquo;s name was Sedonius Apollinaris.</p>
<p>Now Sedonius was very active in the Catholic Church and he corresponded with many of the</p>
<p>prominent people of his day throughout western Europe.</p>
<p>And fortunately, many of his letters have survived the centuries.</p>
<p>One of his letters is dated to the year 468.</p>
<p>And again, as with so many of these sources, we can&rsquo;t be a hundred percent sure if that</p>
<p>date is accurate.</p>
<p>But given the time frame in which he lived and wrote, it can&rsquo;t be off by very much.</p>
<p>This particular letter was written to a friend named Vincentius.</p>
<p>And in it, Sedonius notes that a government official in Gaul had sent a message to the</p>
<p>Gothic king, not the Frankish king, but the Gothic king, Uric.</p>
<p>And that letter had been intercepted.</p>
<p>And the official&rsquo;s secretary had been arrested.</p>
<p>And the secretary confirmed that the letter did indeed come from that particular official</p>
<p>in Gaul.</p>
<p>And according to Sedonius, the intercepted letter was, quote, evidently addressed to</p>
<p>the king of the Goths, whom it dissuaded from concluding peace with the Greek emperor, urging</p>
<p>that instead he should attack the Bretons north of the Loire, and asserting that the</p>
<p>law of nations called for a division of Gaul between Visigoth and Burgundian.</p>
<p>There was more in that same mad vein calculated to inflame a choleric king or shame a quiet</p>
<p>one into action.</p>
<p>Of course, the lawyers found here a flagrant case of treason, end quote.</p>
<p>So it sounds like this particular official found himself in a bit of trouble.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting from this account is that Sedonius specifically mentions the, quote,</p>
<p>Bretons north of the Loire.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s confirming that the British refugees were in place in northern Gaul around this</p>
<p>time, around the year 468.</p>
<p>And of course, the Bretons had to be fleeing something.</p>
<p>And based on that Gallic chronicle entry from a couple of decades earlier, we know that</p>
<p>they were fleeing the Saxons.</p>
<p>So you can start to see how historians have pieced together scraps of information here</p>
<p>and there to figure out what happened.</p>
<p>Now Sedonius also wrote another letter, which is interesting and provides a little more</p>
<p>information about the situation in Gaul.</p>
<p>This other letter was dated 470, a couple of years after that first letter I just mentioned.</p>
<p>And it was written to a British military leader who was busy fighting against the Visigoths</p>
<p>who remained in northern Gaul.</p>
<p>The British leader&rsquo;s name was Rhiothamas.</p>
<p>And the late Roman historian Giordanus actually called Rhiothamas the king of the Bretons.</p>
<p>In fact, the name Rhiothamas is a Latin version of a Celtic name, which meant king most or</p>
<p>highest king.</p>
<p>So why was such a supreme British king active in northern Gaul during this period?</p>
<p>Well part of the answer has to do with the general exodus of Bretons from southern Britain.</p>
<p>The exodus was so great that even prominent generals had apparently made the trek.</p>
<p>But for some later historians who are intrigued with the legendary figure of Arthur, who pops</p>
<p>up in some later accounts of this period, they think that there might be a connection</p>
<p>to this leader named Rhiothamas.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s possible that he was the same person who was later referred to as Arthur</p>
<p>in some of those accounts, but I&rsquo;ll look at that issue in a little more detail in the</p>
<p>next episode.</p>
<p>For now, we just need to focus on this particular letter written to Rhiothamas around the year</p>
<p>470.</p>
<p>Apparently Sidonius, who wrote the letter, knew someone who had his slaves enticed away</p>
<p>by a group of armed Bretons in northern Gaul.</p>
<p>And he wrote the following.</p>
<p>I will write once more in my usual strain, mingling compliment with grievance.</p>
<p>Not that I at all desire to follow up the first words of greeting with disagreeable</p>
<p>subjects, but things seem to be always happening which a man of my order and in my position</p>
<p>can neither mention without unpleasantness nor pass over without neglect of duty.</p>
<p>Yet I do my best to remember the burdensome and delicate sense of honor which makes you</p>
<p>so ready to blush for others&rsquo; faults.</p>
<p>The bearer of this is an obscure and humble person, so harmless, insignificant, and helpless</p>
<p>that he seems to invite his own discomfiture.</p>
<p>His grievance is that the Bretons are secretly enticing his slaves away.</p>
<p>Whether his indictment is a true one I cannot say, but if you can only confront the parties</p>
<p>and decide the matter on its merits, I think the unfortunate man may be able to make good</p>
<p>his charge.&quot;</p>
<p>So this letter once again confirms the presence of British refugees in and around the region</p>
<p>of Brittany around the year 470.</p>
<p>And remember that that&rsquo;s about 20 or 30 years after the other sources we looked at</p>
<p>which indicated that the native Bretons had started to be conquered by the Saxons.</p>
<p>Now before we move on from the Bretons in northern Gaul, let me note that since they</p>
<p>came from Britain during this period, their Celtic language is closely related to the</p>
<p>Celtic languages of southern Britain.</p>
<p>So we can place Breton in the same Celtic subfamily as Welsh and Cornish.</p>
<p>All of those are descended from the early Celtic languages of Britain.</p>
<p>And remember that those are all distinct from that other Celtic subfamily which includes</p>
<p>Irish and Scottish Gaelic.</p>
<p>Okay, so by now we&rsquo;ve established that there was a great Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain,</p>
<p>that the Anglo-Saxons had begun to settle there, that outside sources refer to a Saxon</p>
<p>conquest of Britain, and that there was a massive migration of Bretons out of southern</p>
<p>Britain into northern Gaul.</p>
<p>But we still don&rsquo;t know much about that actual Anglo-Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly what led to the invasion.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know much about the actual conquest of Britain.</p>
<p>So we might be led to assume that the Saxons had just begun to arrive in greater numbers</p>
<p>and they had simply overwhelmed the native Romano-Bretons.</p>
<p>But it turns out things were a little more complicated than that.</p>
<p>Our next written account actually comes about 70 or 80 years after those letters from Sidonius.</p>
<p>So that puts us around the year 550 or maybe a few years before.</p>
<p>And this particular written account is probably the most important contemporary account of</p>
<p>the events during this period that we have.</p>
<p>Even though it was written about a century after the initial Saxon invasion around 450,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still the first detailed account we have which describes what happened over those intervening</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it&rsquo;s a pretty important document.</p>
<p>The document is a three-part extended sermon written by a British monk named Gildas the Wise.</p>
<p>And according to Gildas, the Saxons didn&rsquo;t just show up one day and start looting and pillaging.</p>
<p>In fact, believe it or not, they were actually invited in by the native Bretons.</p>
<p>According to Gildas, the Picts to the north had become such a tremendous threat that the</p>
<p>Saxons were invited in as mercenaries to fight the Picts.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider what Gildas has to say and why and when he says it.</p>
<p>The first potential problem with Gildas is the time frame.</p>
<p>As I noted, his account was written about 100 years after that Gallic Chronicle entry</p>
<p>which says that the Saxons were conquered by the Bretons.</p>
<p>And in keeping with the tradition of the church, it was written in Latin.</p>
<p>In its English translation, the sermon was called On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain.</p>
<p>So what about that 100-year time frame?</p>
<p>Well, obviously Gildas wasn&rsquo;t old enough to have been around for over a century and</p>
<p>have first-hand knowledge of what had happened.</p>
<p>So he had to rely at least in part on other evidence, probably stories passed down in</p>
<p>the oral tradition.</p>
<p>And he also had some access to documents which we don&rsquo;t have today.</p>
<p>One of those documents was that letter to the Roman general in Gaul around the year</p>
<p>450 because he was the first writer to actually quote the letter.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very likely that later writers simply quoted it directly from him.</p>
<p>So he may have been the only person with direct access to the letter to leave a written account</p>
<p>of it for future generations.</p>
<p>Now even though he may have had access to some documents and oral accounts of what happened</p>
<p>a century earlier, we still have to consider the fact that he was writing at a much later</p>
<p>date.</p>
<p>The other potential problem with Gildas was his motivation and purpose.</p>
<p>As I noted, Gildas was a monk in a native Britain and it&rsquo;s very clear from his writing</p>
<p>that he was trying to convey a moral message, that it had been wrong to invite in pagan</p>
<p>barbarians to fight the Picts, and he believed that the people of Britain had been punished</p>
<p>for that decision.</p>
<p>They had experienced a great deal of suffering, but it was all a consequence of their own</p>
<p>misdeeds.</p>
<p>So the account of Gildas is primarily a sermon, not a literal record of history.</p>
<p>So we have to keep that in mind as we consider what he has to say.</p>
<p>Gildas begins his sermon with a summary of the events which had taken place in Britain</p>
<p>from the time the Romans first arrived until the time of his writing shortly before the</p>
<p>year 550.</p>
<p>Now some of his early history of Roman Britain is clearly wrong, but as he describes events</p>
<p>closer to his own time, it&rsquo;s believed that his accounts are more accurate.</p>
<p>According to Gildas, the native Britons came under increasing attacks from the Picts and</p>
<p>the Scots, and in an effort to defend the region, they turned to the Saxons.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a portion of the sermon.</p>
<p>And all the councilors, along with the proud tyrant, were so blinded that, as a protection</p>
<p>to their country, they sealed its doom by inviting in among them, like wolves into the</p>
<p>sheepfold, the fierce and impious Saxons, a race hateful both to God and men, to repel</p>
<p>the invasions of the northern nations.</p>
<p>Nothing was ever so pernicious to our country.</p>
<p>Nothing was ever so unlucky.</p>
<p>But palpable darkness must have enveloped their minds, darkness, desperate and cruel.</p>
<p>Those very people whom, when absent, they dreaded more than death itself, were invited</p>
<p>to reside, as one may say, under the same roof.&quot;</p>
<p>So according to Gildas, a, quote, proud tyrant invited the Saxons.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll see shortly, later sources identified this tyrant or leader as a man named Vortigern.</p>
<p>Gildas then says that the Saxons were given lands in eastern Britain, and soon their relatives</p>
<p>back on the continent heard of their successes, and many more flocked to Britain.</p>
<p>But at a later date, the Saxons turned on their British host, and fighting broke out</p>
<p>between the two groups.</p>
<p>And this is how he described the root of the conflict between the Saxons and the Britons.</p>
<p>The barbarians, being thus introduced as soldiers into the island, to encounter, as</p>
<p>they falsely said, any dangers in defense of their hospitable entertainers, obtain an</p>
<p>allowance of provisions, which, for some time being plentifully bestowed, stopped their</p>
<p>doggish mouths.</p>
<p>Yet they complain that their monthly supplies are not furnished in sufficient abundance,</p>
<p>and they industriously aggravate each occasion of quarrel, saying that unless more liberality</p>
<p>is shown them they will break the treaty and plunder the whole island.</p>
<p>In short time they follow up their threats with deeds.&quot;</p>
<p>So basically the Saxons began to complain about their provisions and supplies.</p>
<p>And this is very reminiscent of the complaints of the Goths after they were allowed to cross</p>
<p>the Danube into Roman territory.</p>
<p>As we know, the Goths began to starve and soon rose up and defeated the Romans.</p>
<p>Now we don&rsquo;t know if the Saxons were as desperate as the Goths, but it&rsquo;s possible that the</p>
<p>same basic process was happening again here in Britain, and it&rsquo;s also possible the Saxons</p>
<p>just wanted an excuse to plunder.</p>
<p>According to Gildas, the fighting between the Saxons and the Britons lasted for many</p>
<p>years, and he described the consequences in great detail.</p>
<p>In one passage he writes,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;for the fire of vengeance, justly kindled by former crimes, spread from sea to sea,</p>
<p>fed by the hands of our foes in the east, and did not cease until, destroying the neighboring</p>
<p>towns and lands, it reached the other side of the island, and dipped its red and savage</p>
<p>tongue in the western ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he writes in graphic detail,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;lamentable to behold, in the midst of the streets lay the tops of lofty towers,</p>
<p>tumbled to the ground, stones of high walls, holy altars, fragments of human bodies, covered</p>
<p>with livid clots of coagulated blood, looking as if they had been squeezed together in a</p>
<p>press, and with no chance of being buried, save in the ruins of the houses, or in the</p>
<p>ravening bellies of wild beasts and birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he notes the following,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;some, therefore, of the miserable remnant, being taken into the mountains, were murdered</p>
<p>in great numbers, others, constrained by famine, came and yielded themselves to be slaves for</p>
<p>ever to their foes, running the risk of being instantly slain, which truly was the greatest</p>
<p>favor that could be offered them.</p>
<p>Some others passed beyond the seas, with loud lamentations, instead of the voice of exhortation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So from all of that, Gildas confirms that many of the native Britons fled the Saxon</p>
<p>onslaught.</p>
<p>He says that some of them fled to the western mountains, basically modern-day Wales.</p>
<p>And he said that some of them fled, quote, beyond the seas.</p>
<p>So presumably that means across the channel to Brittany and northern Gaul.</p>
<p>Gildas then notes that the fighting lasted for many years.</p>
<p>Eventually though, the Britons began to fight back, under the leadership of a man named</p>
<p>Ambrosius Aurelianus.</p>
<p>And eventually, they won a decisive victory at a place called Mons Bodonicus.</p>
<p>And he says that the victory occurred about 44 years earlier, in the same year in which</p>
<p>he was born.</p>
<p>And that victory at Mons Bodonicus ushered in a period of peace between the two groups</p>
<p>that had lasted until the time of Gildas&rsquo; writings, about 44 years later.</p>
<p>So that means that British victory at Mons Bodonicus took place sometime around the year</p>
<p>500.</p>
<p>He then states the following,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and yet neither to this day are the cities of our country inhabited as before.</p>
<p>But being forsaken and overthrown still lie desolate.</p>
<p>Our foreign wars having ceased, but our civil troubles still remaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Gildas is indicating that the region had been devastated, and the native Britons had</p>
<p>been largely displaced.</p>
<p>In the next episode, we&rsquo;ll look at the legacy of the Celtic-speaking Britons, especially</p>
<p>their legacy on the English language.</p>
<p>And one of the great ongoing debates is whether the Britons were wiped out by the Anglo-Saxons,</p>
<p>or whether they were just consumed within the new Anglo-Saxon society.</p>
<p>Well Gildas suggests the former, that they were basically wiped out within the regions</p>
<p>occupied by the Saxons.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ll see, modern evidence suggests that this view may be an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Now Gildas concludes his history by describing a period of relative peace during his lifetime.</p>
<p>And since he was writing for a contemporary audience, we can assume that he was somewhat</p>
<p>accurate in this part of his description.</p>
<p>But what about the rest of it?</p>
<p>Is there any real evidence of an imitation being extended to the Saxons?</p>
<p>Well no.</p>
<p>And who was that proud tyrant who invited the Saxons in?</p>
<p>Well Gildas doesn&rsquo;t say, though later sources provide the name of Vortigern.</p>
<p>When did this alleged invitation to the Saxons occur?</p>
<p>Again Gildas doesn&rsquo;t tell us.</p>
<p>And when did the Anglo-Saxons begin to arrive?</p>
<p>Well again, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And where is this place called Mons Pedonicus, where the Britons supposedly won a decisive</p>
<p>victory?</p>
<p>Again, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem with Gildas.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t writing as an historian.</p>
<p>He was writing as a preacher.</p>
<p>But while we&rsquo;re left with lots of questions, we have to assume that his account is roughly</p>
<p>based on facts.</p>
<p>And the reason for that assumption is because Gildas was writing for a contemporary audience.</p>
<p>He was writing about events that were taking place during his lifetime, and which had taken</p>
<p>place over the prior century.</p>
<p>And he was writing to the people of his time.</p>
<p>So it appears that his description reflects the common knowledge and understanding of</p>
<p>the people of Britain at the time.</p>
<p>And the events described by Gildas are actually very consistent with Roman practice at the</p>
<p>time, especially the basic idea of using the Saxons to fight the Picts.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen over the past few episodes, the Romans had come to rely heavily on Germanic</p>
<p>mercenaries.</p>
<p>Tribes like the Goths and the Franks had been invited into Roman territory to fight Rome&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enemies.</p>
<p>In fact, by this point, a large portion of the Roman army in Western Europe was composed</p>
<p>of Germanic mercenaries.</p>
<p>And Germans were rising to the highest ranks in the Roman army.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not surprising that those Romano-Britons left behind in Britain would do exactly what</p>
<p>Rome had been doing for decades.</p>
<p>Bring in some mercenaries to fight the invaders.</p>
<p>Let the barbarians fight the barbarians.</p>
<p>Let their enemies fight each other while they stood on the sidelines.</p>
<p>That was all very Roman.</p>
<p>And so the account of Gildas may be accurate in this respect.</p>
<p>Now before we move on from Gildas, let me note a few more things about his account.</p>
<p>First, he described the Germanic tribes simply as Saxons.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t use the term Angles, Jutes, Frisians, or Franks, it&rsquo;s just Saxons.</p>
<p>And the Gallic Chronicle did the same thing a century earlier.</p>
<p>It only refers to Saxons.</p>
<p>But this appears to have been a common practice at the time.</p>
<p>Remember the Saxon shore which I discussed in the last episode?</p>
<p>It appears that all of the North Sea Germanic tribes were sometimes collectively referred</p>
<p>to as the Saxons.</p>
<p>Another key point about Gildas is that he did make a few mistakes in his narrative.</p>
<p>For example, he attributed the construction of Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall to a period much later</p>
<p>than the period when it was actually constructed.</p>
<p>Also, earlier I mentioned that letter from a group of Britons to the Roman general in</p>
<p>Gaul pleading for help.</p>
<p>Well Gildas quotes that letter, and that&rsquo;s part of the reason why we believe the letter</p>
<p>actually existed.</p>
<p>And we know from the dates in which the general was in power that it had to have been written</p>
<p>around the year 450.</p>
<p>But the letter didn&rsquo;t mention who the invaders were.</p>
<p>So Gildas assumed that the invaders were the Picts and the Scots.</p>
<p>But we know from that Gallic Chronicle written about the same time period that it was the</p>
<p>Saxons who were invading.</p>
<p>So Gildas also apparently made a mistake in that regard.</p>
<p>He also concluded his history by noting that at the time of his writings, around the year</p>
<p>550, that there had been an extended period of peace between the Saxons and the Britons.</p>
<p>But archaeology suggests that the term peace used by Gildas must have been a relative term</p>
<p>‚Äì maybe it was peaceful compared to the earlier period of warfare ‚Äì because the</p>
<p>archaeological evidence suggests that skirmishes were still occurring during the time in which</p>
<p>Gildas lived.</p>
<p>Cemetery evidence indicates that the Saxons, or Anglo-Saxons, were still expanding westward</p>
<p>and northward during that period.</p>
<p>And hilltop sites in the west were also re-fortified during that period, and that also suggests</p>
<p>an ongoing threat.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Gildas, and while we can be skeptical about some of his purported history, we also</p>
<p>have to consider that his is really the closest thing we have to a contemporary account of</p>
<p>the history of the Anglo-Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>Now after Gildas, the only other contemporary account of the events in Britain during this</p>
<p>period comes from the Byzantine writer and historian Procopius.</p>
<p>I actually mentioned Procopius a couple of episodes back.</p>
<p>He was the Byzantine writer and historian in Constantinople during the time of the Emperor</p>
<p>Justinian, and he wrote three histories during his lifetime, one of which was a series of</p>
<p>scandalous stories published after his death called Anecdota, which is the origin of the</p>
<p>word anecdote in modern English.</p>
<p>Remember that?</p>
<p>Well he also wrote a history of wars of the Eastern Roman Empire, and he wrote that history</p>
<p>around the same time that Gildas wrote that sermon we just looked at.</p>
<p>So Procopius was a contemporary of Gildas, and in his history Procopius mentioned a couple</p>
<p>of things about events in Britain.</p>
<p>Now in order to understand what Procopius has to say, we have to consider the context</p>
<p>in which he wrote.</p>
<p>Remember that he was writing from Constantinople, modern day Istanbul in Turkey.</p>
<p>So needless to say he wasn&rsquo;t exactly providing a first-hand account of events in Britain.</p>
<p>But remember that at the same time the Anglo-Saxons were conquering parts of Britain, the Franks</p>
<p>were expanding across northern and central Gaul.</p>
<p>And by this point, around the year 550, the Franks had effectively conquered most of Gaul</p>
<p>except for that region of Brittany with the British refugees in the northwest.</p>
<p>Around the year 553, the Franks sent some emissaries to Constantinople.</p>
<p>And these Frankish emissaries were accompanied by some Angles as well.</p>
<p>And this was the source of the information which Procopius included in his history.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re dealing with second-hand accounts, and we have to consider the possibility</p>
<p>of hearsay and the impact of the personal opinions of the Franks and the Angles.</p>
<p>One thing that was confirmed by the sources is that many Britons were now living in northern</p>
<p>Gaul in Brittany.</p>
<p>Procopius writes,</p>
<p>Three very populous nations inhabit the island of Britia.</p>
<p>And one king is set over each of them.</p>
<p>And the names of these nations are Angles, Frisians, and Britons, who have the same name</p>
<p>as the island.</p>
<p>So great apparently is the multitude of these peoples that every year in large groups they</p>
<p>migrate from there with their women and children and go to the Franks.</p>
<p>And they, the Franks, are settling them in what seems to be the more desolate part of</p>
<p>their land.</p>
<p>And as a result of this, they say they are gaining possession of the island.</p>
<p>So that not long ago the king of the Franks actually sent some of his friends to the emperor</p>
<p>Justinian in Byzantium and dispatched with them the men of the Angles, claiming that</p>
<p>this island, Britain, too is ruled by him.</p>
<p>Such then are the matters concerning the island called Britia.</p>
<p>So Procopius confirms the settlement of Britons in Brittany, but we already knew that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more interesting is the way he describes the inhabitants of Britain.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that up to this point other writers simply used the term Saxons.</p>
<p>But Procopius doesn&rsquo;t use the term Saxons at all.</p>
<p>He describes the residents of Britain as Britons, Angles, and Frisians.</p>
<p>This is the first specific reference we have to those two groups settling in Britain.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the only historical reference which specifically mentions the Frisians.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s no mention of the Saxons, which is interesting.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t mention the Jutes either.</p>
<p>But at least we&rsquo;re starting to get specific references to other North Sea tribes in Britain.</p>
<p>And I should also note that Procopius uses the term Britia, which has led some later</p>
<p>scholars to wonder if he was using that term to refer to the island of Britain or the region</p>
<p>of Brittany in northern Gaul.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to get into that debate here.</p>
<p>So that really concludes our look at the contemporary sources who wrote during the period of the</p>
<p>actual Anglo-Saxon invasions.</p>
<p>The period of the Anglo-Saxon invasions or uprising lasted from the early 400s through</p>
<p>the very early 600s.</p>
<p>So the last sources we have from this period, Gildas and Procopius, they were writing around</p>
<p>the year 550.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s about three quarters of the way through that period.</p>
<p>And as we know today, the story was far from over when they were writing.</p>
<p>That period of relative peace mentioned by Gildas would soon come to an end because the</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxons soon conquered all of the territory which we know today as modern England.</p>
<p>And with respect to the Britons who were fleeing to northern Gaul, the archaeological evidence</p>
<p>suggests that there were two general periods of migrations.</p>
<p>There was that initial period around the year 450 when the first Anglo-Saxon onslaught began.</p>
<p>And most of those refugees came from the central coast of southern Britain.</p>
<p>But around the year 575, shortly after the time of Gildas and Procopius, a second wave</p>
<p>of migration occurred.</p>
<p>Most of this second wave of refugees came from the western regions of Britain, around</p>
<p>Devon and Cornwall.</p>
<p>So that suggests that shortly after the time of Gildas, the period of relative peace ended.</p>
<p>And the native Britons who had fled to the west came under attack again.</p>
<p>And many of them fled from those regions down into northern Gaul.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, later historians wrote about the Anglo-Saxon invasion and filled</p>
<p>in some of the details which were missing from these contemporary accounts.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the real dilemma as we look at this period of history.</p>
<p>Many of the details come from accounts which were written many years after the fact, usually</p>
<p>several centuries later.</p>
<p>And without knowing the sources of those extra details, it can be difficult to determine</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s fact and what&rsquo;s legend.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t leave the topic of the Anglo-Saxon invasion without discussing a couple of these</p>
<p>later sources, because they provide many of the missing details of this story.</p>
<p>The first source is the history of England which was written by Bede in the 8th century.</p>
<p>The other is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which began to be compiled around the year 900.</p>
<p>And these are generally considered to be the two definitive sources of Anglo-Saxon history,</p>
<p>since they were both written during the Anglo-Saxon period.</p>
<p>But as it relates to the initial Anglo-Saxon invasion, both of these sources had to deal</p>
<p>with the same problem of time, the fact that they were both written so many years after the fact.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with Bede, or the Venerable Bede as he came to be known in later centuries.</p>
<p>Bede was a monk who lived in Northumbria, in northern England.</p>
<p>And in the year 731 he completed a history of England and the English Church called the</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical History of the English People.</p>
<p>And this is still generally considered to be the definitive history of Anglo-Saxon England</p>
<p>up to that point.</p>
<p>Bede begins his history with the following description.</p>
<p>In the year of our Lord, 449, Martian, being made emperor when Valentinian, and the 46th</p>
<p>from Augustus, ruled the empire seven years.</p>
<p>Then the nation of the Angles, or Saxons, being invited by the aforesaid king, arrived</p>
<p>in Britain with three longships, and had a place assigned to them to reside in by the</p>
<p>same king, in the eastern part of the island, that they might thus appear to be fighting</p>
<p>for their country, whilst their real intentions were to enslave it.&quot;</p>
<p>So Bede gives us a specific year for the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, the year 449.</p>
<p>And because Bede and his history were so influential, that year has become the traditional date</p>
<p>often given for the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>But this particular date, 449, was almost certainly a reconstructed date, and probably</p>
<p>more of a guesstimate.</p>
<p>In reality, as we know by now, there probably wasn&rsquo;t a specific date that we can look</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>It was a very gradual process, not a dramatic event like the arrival of the Romans in the</p>
<p>year 43, or the Normans in the year 1066.</p>
<p>In fact, as I noted earlier, the archaeological evidence confirms that there were permanent</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon settlements in place over a decade before the date given by Bede.</p>
<p>But it also appears that what was initially a gradual immigration did accelerate at some</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>We know that a group of Britons wrote that letter to the Roman general pleading for help</p>
<p>around the year 450.</p>
<p>And the Gallic Chronicle also mentions that Saxon conquest of Britain around the same</p>
<p>time frame.</p>
<p>So Bede was probably in the ballpark with that year of 449.</p>
<p>Bede then follows the account of Gildas by stating that the Anglo-Saxons were invited</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>He writes, and again this is a quote,</p>
<p>The newcomers received of the Britons a place to inhabit, upon condition that they should</p>
<p>wage war against their enemies for the peace and security of the country, whilst the Britons</p>
<p>agreed to furnish them with pay.</p>
<p>Those who came over were of the three most powerful nations of Germany, Saxons, Angles,</p>
<p>and Jutes.</p>
<p>From the Jutes are descended the people of Kent, and of the Isle of Wight, and those</p>
<p>also in the province of the West Saxons, who are to this day called Jutes, seated opposite</p>
<p>to the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>From the Saxons, that is the country which we now call Old Saxony, came the East Saxons,</p>
<p>the South Saxons, and the West Saxons.</p>
<p>From the Angles, that is the country which we call Anglia, and which is said from that</p>
<p>time to remain deserted to this day, between the provinces of the Jutes and the Saxons</p>
<p>are descended the East Angles, the Midland Angles, the Mercians, all the race of the</p>
<p>Northumbrians, that is of those nations that dwell on the north side of the River Humber,</p>
<p>and the other nations of the English.&quot;</p>
<p>So there is the definitive statement that Britain was invaded by Angles, Saxons, and</p>
<p>Jutes.</p>
<p>And he also gives us the traditional regional breakdown for those groups.</p>
<p>The Jutes settled in the east in Kent.</p>
<p>The Angles settled in the central regions.</p>
<p>And the Saxons settled in the south.</p>
<p>The area of the East Saxons became Essex.</p>
<p>The area of the South Saxons became Sussex.</p>
<p>And the area of the West Saxons became Wessex.</p>
<p>Once again, Bede was working from a vantage point almost 300 years later.</p>
<p>By this point, there were certainly regional differences in the dialects of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And the kingdoms that had emerged within these regions had distinct names as well.</p>
<p>Sussex, Essex, and Wessex all had names which clearly derived from the name of the Saxons.</p>
<p>And they all spoke similar dialects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the east, there was the region known as East Anglia.</p>
<p>And that name clearly derived from the name of the Angles.</p>
<p>And the people in that region also spoke a distinctive dialect.</p>
<p>And those differences in dialects persisted through the years and could be detected by</p>
<p>later generations.</p>
<p>And some of those differences persist to this day.</p>
<p>And Bede&rsquo;s description reflects those regional differences as they existed at the time, the</p>
<p>time when he was writing.</p>
<p>But historians still debate whether those differences were there from the beginning</p>
<p>or whether they had developed later from an initial mixture of tribes.</p>
<p>After describing the initial settlement of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, Bede continues</p>
<p>his history.</p>
<p>And in doing so, he basically followed the same narrative as Gildas.</p>
<p>It seems clear that Gildas was one of Bede&rsquo;s primary sources, but Bede adds some additional</p>
<p>details as well.</p>
<p>For example, the proud tyrant who invited the Anglo-Saxons to Britain was named Vortigern.</p>
<p>And the early leaders of the Anglo-Saxons were called Ingus and Horsa.</p>
<p>So were these real people or just legendary figures?</p>
<p>Well, again, that&rsquo;s still a matter of debate, but I&rsquo;ll leave it to the professional Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>historians to figure all of that out.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is that Bede&rsquo;s summary of the Anglo-Saxon invasion has secured its</p>
<p>place as the traditional view of the invasion in the minds of most historians.</p>
<p>It was so influential that when the Anglo-Saxons began their own annual chronicle around the</p>
<p>year 900, they largely deferred to Bede&rsquo;s history of the period.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxon chronicle follows Bede&rsquo;s narrative, as well as Bede&rsquo;s time frame.</p>
<p>And this is not really surprising.</p>
<p>While the Anglo-Saxon chronicle is the most important source for late Anglo-Saxon history,</p>
<p>the chroniclers obviously had to rely on other sources for events which had occurred 400</p>
<p>years earlier.</p>
<p>So as you can probably see by now, we have a very general idea of what happened around</p>
<p>the 5th and 6th centuries in Britain.</p>
<p>Lots of questions remain, and there are a lot of details which we may never know.</p>
<p>But one of the biggest mysteries from this period concerns the legacy of the native Celtic-speaking</p>
<p>Britons in the region which fell to the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Were they wiped out as many historians originally thought?</p>
<p>Well, linguistically, there&rsquo;s very little Celtic influence on English.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been the traditional view.</p>
<p>But that view&rsquo;s been challenged by recent research in both linguistics and genetics.</p>
<p>So next time, I&rsquo;m going to explore the legacy of the Celts in Anglo-Saxon England, and in</p>
<p>the English language.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
