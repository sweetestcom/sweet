    <p>Our card this week is Timothy Blair, the five of clubs from Kentucky.</p>
<p>When Timothy&rsquo;s body was found on the side of the road in 2005, investigators launched</p>
<p>into action to find his killer, but their investigation quickly turned cold despite</p>
<p>the discovery of DNA evidence and the cooperation of his family.</p>
<p>Seventeen years later, Timothy&rsquo;s mother persists in her search for justice, even with</p>
<p>the investigation being put on hold and overshadowed by a whirlwind of rumors that have only led</p>
<p>to dead ends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On Sunday, May 22, 2005, a woman was driving her car through a residential area in the</p>
<p>heart of Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when she saw something lying at the edge of the sidewalk up ahead.</p>
<p>It was around 6 a.m., and so she couldn&rsquo;t immediately tell what it was since it was</p>
<p>still dark out.</p>
<p>But when she got closer, she was shocked to see that it was a fully clothed, limp body</p>
<p>sprawled out in front of an empty lot on a corner.</p>
<p>Now this woman didn&rsquo;t have a cell phone, so she sped to her friend&rsquo;s house about</p>
<p>a block away and called 911.</p>
<p>When officers arrived, they found a man lying on his back with half his body across the</p>
<p>sidewalk and half extending into a grassy lot.</p>
<p>It was clear right off the bat that he was deceased, having been shot multiple times</p>
<p>in his torso.</p>
<p>But his injuries weren&rsquo;t the only thing that stood out to investigators.</p>
<p>The man was dressed in clothing traditionally associated with women.</p>
<p>He had on a blonde wig, a green t-shirt with the phrase, my boyfriend is hotter than yours</p>
<p>in pink lettering, and a blue jean miniskirt.</p>
<p>He was barefoot, but there were pink flip-flops kicked off to the side near his body, which</p>
<p>they assumed were his.</p>
<p>And based on the positioning of those flip-flops, they thought that maybe he had tried to run,</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t make it more than a few steps before he was gunned down.</p>
<p>They also found a matching pink purse near his body, but it&rsquo;s never been said if there</p>
<p>was anything inside or not.</p>
<p>Police called the coroner out to the scene, and once he arrived, he was able to touch</p>
<p>the body, and he actually found the man&rsquo;s ID on him, which helped identify him there</p>
<p>at the scene as 19-year-old Timothy Blair.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much more about how the scene looked, but investigators thought that Timothy</p>
<p>was killed there and not shot somewhere else and then dumped, which to me means that there</p>
<p>probably was a lot of blood present.</p>
<p>But again, I don&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, scouring the streets for more physical evidence didn&rsquo;t reveal anything</p>
<p>else of note, such as bullet casings or discarded items.</p>
<p>But the investigators did see something on Timothy that they hoped would help them solve</p>
<p>this homicide.</p>
<p>There was something, investigators still won&rsquo;t say exactly what or even where on Timothy</p>
<p>it was found, but whatever it was, they believed that it would give them a DNA profile for</p>
<p>their killer.</p>
<p>Our reporting team spoke with Lieutenant Donnie Burbrink of the Louisville Metro Police Department&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Homicide Unit.</p>
<p>He was a patrol officer at the time of Timothy&rsquo;s murder, and while he wasn&rsquo;t assigned to</p>
<p>work the case at the time, he&rsquo;s actually the lead investigator today.</p>
<p>One of the first things we asked is if he could give us any more information on the</p>
<p>DNA that was found now.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into that because I don&rsquo;t want to put that out there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of those things that I want to see if the information that comes back actually</p>
<p>is authentic.</p>
<p>Whatever the source of the DNA, investigators knew how crucial it could be for solving Timothy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>homicide, so they collected it to send to the crime lab for testing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officers started canvassing the neighborhood to talk to people who lived nearby.</p>
<p>A few neighbors did remember hearing several gunshots sometime between 3.45 and 4.15 that</p>
<p>morning, although nobody had called 911 to report them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also talking about an area that wasn&rsquo;t unfamiliar with gunshots being, you know,</p>
<p>ringing out in the area.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t get a hundred people saying, yeah, I heard gunshots, because at this time I was</p>
<p>watching TV.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 3.45 in the morning, 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, not many people are up.</p>
<p>Even the party crowd by then is going home and going to bed.</p>
<p>Despite most people not knowing anything, they spoke to one woman that morning who walked</p>
<p>up to the scene and said that she had some information, not about the gunshots, but about</p>
<p>the victim.</p>
<p>The woman, who I&rsquo;ll refer to as Kathy, lived just a few blocks away from where Timothy</p>
<p>was found.</p>
<p>According to her, Timothy went by the nickname Timmy Joe, and he&rsquo;d stopped by her house at</p>
<p>around 2.30 that morning with her goddaughter, Dee Dee.</p>
<p>Kathy had been asleep when the two walked in, so even though they woke her up, she was</p>
<p>still a little groggy.</p>
<p>But from what she remembered, while they were there, Dee Dee told her a story about how</p>
<p>they were harassed by some guys earlier that night, and the police actually had to intervene.</p>
<p>The two didn&rsquo;t tell her much more about the incident, but they were a little shaken</p>
<p>up by it and said that they just needed a place to chill out for a bit and kind of collect</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>So they stayed for a few minutes and then left, after which she went back to sleep not</p>
<p>really thinking anything of it.</p>
<p>Since Dee Dee seemed to be the last person seen with Timmy Joe, officers wanted to track</p>
<p>her down and talk to her as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But first, officers still needed to find Timmy Joe&rsquo;s family and notify them of what</p>
<p>had happened.</p>
<p>When they arrived at his townhome, a young woman answered the door.</p>
<p>She said that her name was Keisha Stewart, and she was Timmy Joe&rsquo;s older sister.</p>
<p>The two lived together along with her kids.</p>
<p>When they told Keisha her brother had been murdered, she was obviously devastated.</p>
<p>But before they interviewed her, she said she had to call her mother, Rosalind Blair,</p>
<p>who lived across the border in Indiana.</p>
<p>When our reporter spoke to Rosalind for this episode, she described what it was like getting</p>
<p>that call, a call that no mother ever wants to receive.</p>
<p>I was getting a call from Keisha, screaming and crying on the phone that Timmy was dead,</p>
<p>he had been murdered.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>And the coroner takes the phone, and I said, I want to see my child.</p>
<p>He told me I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in a biohazard area, and you can&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>Rosalind agreed to meet them over at Keisha and Timmy Joe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And while they were waiting for her, investigators started to get a clearer picture of who Timmy</p>
<p>Joe was from his sister.</p>
<p>He was the third of seven kids and was an openly gay man who occasionally dressed in</p>
<p>more traditionally feminine clothes as part of his self-expression.</p>
<p>He often went by the nicknames Paris or Yum Yum when he dressed up.</p>
<p>And like any family should, his family accepted him for exactly who he was, which according</p>
<p>to Rosalind, was the life of the party.</p>
<p>He was fun.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d always make you laugh on your worst day.</p>
<p>I remember when he was 17, they thought I had throat cancer.</p>
<p>He was the strongest one out of seven kids.</p>
<p>That I planned my funeral and everything.</p>
<p>He never dropped a tear.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m right here.</p>
<p>And ended up coming back.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So he tore up all the paperwork.</p>
<p>He said, OK, enough of this trash now.</p>
<p>He tore up everything.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t perfect by no means.</p>
<p>He made mistakes like we all do.</p>
<p>But he was mine and nobody had a right to take him.</p>
<p>When Rosalind arrived, officers asked them both if they knew anything about Timmy Joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whereabouts earlier that morning.</p>
<p>Keisha said that she had last seen her brother sometime between 1130 and 1 a.m. when he had</p>
<p>left the house with Dee Dee.</p>
<p>And as far as Rosalind, she&rsquo;d only briefly spoken to Timmy Joe on his cell phone while</p>
<p>he was out, but didn&rsquo;t really know exactly where he was when they spoke.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when officers paused because they didn&rsquo;t find a cell phone at the scene.</p>
<p>Keisha went on to say that she had called Timmy Joe several times the night before,</p>
<p>but each time it would ring and ring without an answer.</p>
<p>So authorities there noted that they would need to locate the phone and then continued</p>
<p>asking questions.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s when suddenly Rosalind&rsquo;s phone began to ring.</p>
<p>And when she looked down, it was Timmy Joe&rsquo;s name that lit up her screen.</p>
<p>When our reporter spoke to Rosalind, she told us that she answered the phone hoping to hear</p>
<p>her son&rsquo;s voice on the other end.</p>
<p>But when we spoke to Detective Burbrink, he said that it was Keisha who picked up.</p>
<p>Whoever answered, they both agreed that there was a man on the other end who asked for Diana.</p>
<p>Now everyone realized that he was talking about Dee Dee.</p>
<p>Diana was her given name.</p>
<p>But before the man could say anything else, Keisha jumped in.</p>
<p>Keisha starts automatically throwing accusations that you&rsquo;ve got my brother&rsquo;s phone, you know</p>
<p>who killed him, you&rsquo;re the one, you&rsquo;re involved, you and Dee Dee are involved.</p>
<p>And this guy is completely and totally clueless of what she&rsquo;s talking about, has no idea.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of insisting he had no idea what she was talking about, the mystery</p>
<p>man hung up.</p>
<p>The call left the two women in a state of shock.</p>
<p>But investigators tried to get their conversation back on track before they left to pursue the</p>
<p>man on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>After they collected themselves, Keisha was able to fill police in on some of the earlier</p>
<p>parts of Timmy Joe&rsquo;s evening.</p>
<p>She said that he had been at a block party in the neighborhood with Dee Dee while she</p>
<p>was hanging out at the house with her ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>Eventually, the two came home, they got ready to go out, and they left on foot.</p>
<p>Keisha didn&rsquo;t know where they went from there, and there wasn&rsquo;t anything about their behavior</p>
<p>that stuck out to her as alarming.</p>
<p>Although, she did mention something about her own car that stuck out in her memory.</p>
<p>She said that it had been moved down a few spaces from where she remembered parking it</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>Now, she often let Timmy Joe borrow her car when he needed to, but as far as she knew,</p>
<p>he hadn&rsquo;t used it since she last parked it.</p>
<p>And since he left on foot, there was no reason for him to have moved the car that night.</p>
<p>Now, she wasn&rsquo;t sure what this meant, or if it meant anything, or if it was even related</p>
<p>to her brother&rsquo;s murder at all.</p>
<p>But it was just weird, and she wasn&rsquo;t sure who moved it, so she figured she might as</p>
<p>well mention it.</p>
<p>Other than that, though, neither Keisha nor Rosalind had anything else to add.</p>
<p>So investigators got to work on their other potential witnesses.</p>
<p>Specifically, they went to track down Dee Dee.</p>
<p>When they found her, she told them the same story as Keisha.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d been at the block party, then they decided to go out in downtown Louisville.</p>
<p>She even described the exact outfit that he was in, down to the blonde wig and pink flip-flops.</p>
<p>After they left Keisha&rsquo;s, the two walked a few blocks toward downtown Louisville.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they came across this guy coming out of a nearby bar.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know him prior to this, but they were looking for a ride and thought that maybe</p>
<p>he could help.</p>
<p>Dee Dee described this guy as a white guy and middle-aged, and nice enough off the bat</p>
<p>because he agreed to give them a ride.</p>
<p>She sat in the back while Timmy Joe got up in the front and chatted with the man.</p>
<p>They go to Dino&rsquo;s, which is a gas station, a well-known gas station here in Louisville</p>
<p>at the corner of 26th and Broadway.</p>
<p>And Timothy asks the guy that was giving him a ride for $4 to go in and buy a pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p>The guy gives him money.</p>
<p>Timothy and Dee Dee get out of the car.</p>
<p>They go into Dino&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They come back with cigarettes.</p>
<p>And then they start driving eastbound, coming back this way.</p>
<p>It gets a little murky here on the reasoning behind this, but they eventually get to 7th</p>
<p>and Broadway, which is about 10 blocks, 11 blocks from here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a White Castle there.</p>
<p>And Timothy asked the guy to drop him off at the White Castle.</p>
<p>And the guy does.</p>
<p>Both Timmy Joe and Dee Dee get out of the car there, and they kept walking for a few</p>
<p>more blocks until they decided to take a break and smoke a cigarette.</p>
<p>So they sat down outside of the bank, and as they were resting, Timmy Joe started trying</p>
<p>to talk to this group of guys who had come out of a nearby club.</p>
<p>But their conversation was anything but friendly, because the men started hurling transphobic</p>
<p>and homophobic remarks towards Timmy Joe.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a group of guys that start yelling at Timmy, saying, you&rsquo;re a dude, you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>dude, you look like a dude, I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re talking to us, you&rsquo;re a dude.</p>
<p>And somebody actually throws a beer bottle at Timmy.</p>
<p>And the police were on patrol, and Timmy flags them down and says, this guy over here,</p>
<p>he just threw a beer bottle at me.</p>
<p>So the officers get out and basically tell everybody they got to leave.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to stay in here and congregate, y&rsquo;all got to go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the last time that this guy is talked about.</p>
<p>Understandably, they were both a little shaken by the incident.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when they walked back to Dee Dee&rsquo;s godmother&rsquo;s house to take some deep breaths</p>
<p>and regroup before they left to continue their night out.</p>
<p>From there, Dee Dee told them nothing notable really happened, they just kind of walked</p>
<p>around.</p>
<p>But all these years later, after reviewing her interview, Lieutenant Burbank isn&rsquo;t so</p>
<p>sure about that.</p>
<p>Now, they started walking down Broadway again.</p>
<p>But the way they&rsquo;re talking in the interview, Dee Dee, they&rsquo;re kind of soliciting a little</p>
<p>bit, almost like they&rsquo;re trying to get picked up for some cash.</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t together right next to each other.</p>
<p>So they could make money, they&rsquo;d split up.</p>
<p>One went on the north side of the street, one went on the south side of the street.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re walking, and they would talk to people.</p>
<p>And they would walk and talk.</p>
<p>Whether they really were soliciting or not, as they were walking, Dee Dee told investigators</p>
<p>that she ran into a group of men that she knew.</p>
<p>They were out partying and offered to take Dee Dee with them to their next stop.</p>
<p>And she agreed.</p>
<p>But she wasn&rsquo;t going to just leave Timmy Joe without saying anything.</p>
<p>So she got his attention from the other side of the road and asked if he wanted to come</p>
<p>along.</p>
<p>But he declined and said that he was going to stay out just a little bit longer.</p>
<p>It was roughly 3 a.m. when Dee Dee said that she drove away in her friend&rsquo;s vehicle and</p>
<p>saw Timmy Joe for the last time, only three blocks from where his body would eventually</p>
<p>be found.</p>
<p>Not talking to anybody, not really doing anything, just by himself.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the gap between that time, that Dee Dee last season, and where they find</p>
<p>Timmy Joe deceased.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important that we show our belief based on the investigation.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t leave Diana&rsquo;s involved.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just important to show people&rsquo;s cooperation to eliminate them in an investigation</p>
<p>that is to say when people don&rsquo;t cooperate, we need to key in on them.</p>
<p>Notably, Dee Dee also never mentioned Keisha&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>So investigators thought it likely didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with Timmy Joe&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>So filling in that gap, the timeline between when Dee Dee drove away and when Timmy Joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body was found became investigators&rsquo; top priority.</p>
<p>But then they got another call from the man who had Timmy Joe&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>That man, who I&rsquo;ll call Charlie, told investigators that he&rsquo;d been the one who had given Timmy</p>
<p>Joe and Dee Dee a ride on Saturday night.</p>
<p>He was also the man who had spoken to Keisha and Rosalind earlier that morning.</p>
<p>Now, he gave the same story as Dee Dee, from that stop at Dino&rsquo;s for cigarettes to dropping</p>
<p>them off at the White Castle.</p>
<p>And he was able to explain why he had Timmy Joe&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>Problem is, Timothy had let Dee Dee borrow his phone.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in the back seat, he&rsquo;s in the front seat.</p>
<p>When they get out, they leave the phone in this guy&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Charlie said he didn&rsquo;t realize that they had left it, and so the next morning when</p>
<p>he went out to his vehicle, he was confused when he found an unfamiliar phone on the rear</p>
<p>floorboard.</p>
<p>It had a bunch of missed calls, so he went ahead and called the most recent number.</p>
<p>But when Keisha accused him of harming her brother, he panicked.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on the expressway, gets off the expressway to go to his house, and takes the phone and</p>
<p>throws it out the window.</p>
<p>He said, I don&rsquo;t want any part of this, I&rsquo;m leaving.</p>
<p>After he threw it away, he didn&rsquo;t plan on calling the police.</p>
<p>But when he got home and turned on the news, he saw a report about the murder of a young</p>
<p>man named Timothy, which he connected to the name Timmy Joe he remembered Keisha saying.</p>
<p>It was then that he connected the dots and decided to call authorities.</p>
<p>After his interview, police determined that Charlie wasn&rsquo;t involved in Timmy Joe&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>But they still needed him to find the phone that he had chucked out the window in case</p>
<p>there was anything of note on it.</p>
<p>He led police to the location where he tossed it, and luckily they were able to retrieve</p>
<p>Right there on the side of the road.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t give them any helpful information.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to take full downloads on phones like we would do now.</p>
<p>But we know for a fact, Timothy didn&rsquo;t have his phone at the time of his kill.</p>
<p>So that phone, while it&rsquo;s great that we have his phone, we know it wasn&rsquo;t with him.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t communicating with anybody prior to that on that phone.</p>
<p>With the phone being another dead end, investigators were hoping to find some physical evidence</p>
<p>from the autopsy.</p>
<p>Timmy Joe&rsquo;s cause of death was determined to be multiple gunshot wounds to his chest</p>
<p>and torso.</p>
<p>His time of death was estimated to be somewhere between 4 and 4.30 a.m.</p>
<p>And while Lieutenant Burbank didn&rsquo;t reveal the results of the toxicology report to us,</p>
<p>he said that nothing serious stood out to him in that.</p>
<p>But there was something else that did catch investigators&rsquo; attention.</p>
<p>Or rather, the lack of something.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re assaulted before, you&rsquo;ll see the bruising, the disheveled hair, you know, all</p>
<p>those different things that normally happen within a fight.</p>
<p>You see that.</p>
<p>None of that&rsquo;s documented on anything from the medical examiner&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t appear that anybody jumped out and started beating on Timmy Joe and then</p>
<p>shot him.</p>
<p>The fact that there wasn&rsquo;t evidence of an assault pointed towards the murder being a</p>
<p>drive-by.</p>
<p>But there was something about that that just didn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>In a drive-by, there&rsquo;s usually something like shell casings left behind.</p>
<p>So either whoever killed him stopped to clean up after, or they just got really lucky and</p>
<p>all the casings wound up in the car and not on the road.</p>
<p>It was early in the investigation still, but investigators were inching toward a brick</p>
<p>wall.</p>
<p>They decided to spend the next few days interviewing Timmy Joe&rsquo;s other friends and family to</p>
<p>try and stir up some new information.</p>
<p>We start talking to other people that Keisha and Roslyn are giving us, saying, these people</p>
<p>might have information.</p>
<p>These people might have information.</p>
<p>So we just start talking to everybody that they come into.</p>
<p>We talked to one of Timothy&rsquo;s friends named Daryl, and he says that he heard that it was</p>
<p>a Bronco that pulled up on him and a bunch of guys got out and beat him up and do all</p>
<p>this stuff.</p>
<p>Well, the medical examiner&rsquo;s notes don&rsquo;t match up with that because there was no significant</p>
<p>trauma to Timmy Joe&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Roslyn told investigators about another person that she thought might have been with Timmy</p>
<p>Joe at some point that night.</p>
<p>It was a young woman and her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Burbank calls this young woman Jenny.</p>
<p>Roslyn suspected that they were involved in the murder, but when investigators tracked</p>
<p>them down, they quickly cleared them, although the boyfriend did admit to having seen Timmy</p>
<p>Joe out that night.</p>
<p>So we go interview the boyfriend and we&rsquo;ll call him Billy.</p>
<p>Billy&rsquo;s interviewed and Billy says, I saw Timmy Joe around 13th and Broadway and he</p>
<p>was having words with somebody.</p>
<p>So they weren&rsquo;t fighting, but it was really loud words to the point where he thought that</p>
<p>maybe he needed to intervene.</p>
<p>But it looked like it started to settle.</p>
<p>Now investigators aren&rsquo;t sure that this was actually Timmy Joe that he saw because the</p>
<p>timeline of this sighting was off.</p>
<p>Billy said that he saw Timmy Joe around 11 or 1130, but according to all of the other</p>
<p>testimonies that they had gathered, Timmy Joe hadn&rsquo;t even left home by that time.</p>
<p>Also Billy said that he was on a bus when he spotted Timmy Joe, like he saw him through</p>
<p>the window as the bus was going by.</p>
<p>So it is totally possible it was someone else entirely.</p>
<p>But just to be sure, Billy gave investigators a description of the man Timmy Joe was allegedly</p>
<p>arguing with.</p>
<p>He said he was a black man about 6'1 or 6'2, maybe in his late twenties, but he really</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t give them any more identifying information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really never brought up again from what I could find.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, hey, we, me and Jenny had nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>You know, this is what I saw.</p>
<p>This is the last thing that I saw.</p>
<p>Investigators were quickly running out of leads.</p>
<p>It seemed like Timmy Joe had seen plenty of people that night, but no one had been around</p>
<p>at the time of his murder.</p>
<p>So they decided to circle back to Keisha&rsquo;s concerns about her car, just to make sure</p>
<p>they were covering all their bases.</p>
<p>She consented to a search.</p>
<p>So on June 2nd, they combed through it, looking for any evidence that might suggest Timmy</p>
<p>Joe had been inside the evening that he died.</p>
<p>So obviously we wanted to look at that and see if maybe there was anything in there that</p>
<p>really led us to believe that it might be involved somehow.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no evidence whatsoever that shows that this car has anything to do with Timmy</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no blood in the car.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no DNA in the car, in the trunk, where you would normally take a body and put it</p>
<p>in there if you killed somebody inside of a house.</p>
<p>None of that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>After the car came back empty, the case went cold.</p>
<p>They still had the DNA, and although he couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly when, Lt. Burbank told us</p>
<p>the DNA from the scene was uploaded to CODIS, but there were no hits.</p>
<p>The tips stopped coming in as well.</p>
<p>For more than a year, investigators were just stuck.</p>
<p>But then, in December 2006, Rosalind walked into the Louisville Metro Police Department</p>
<p>with what she said was a new lead.</p>
<p>And she pointed her finger straight at someone who had been involved in the case since the</p>
<p>very beginning.</p>
<p>Rosalind told investigators she believed her daughter Keisha had something to do with Timmy</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>You see, in the last year, Keisha had given up custody of her kids because she claimed</p>
<p>to have some health issues and unstable housing.</p>
<p>Two of the kids went to their dads, but the other two, including Keisha&rsquo;s seven-year-old</p>
<p>daughter who I&rsquo;ll just call Anna, went to stay with Rosalind.</p>
<p>Well, when Anna arrived, she immediately said that she had to tell her grandma something</p>
<p>about Timmy Joe.</p>
<p>She told the whole story as to what happened in her house.</p>
<p>And mommy was fake crying and mommy was lying when she was talking to you on the phone.</p>
<p>And she said a guy by the name of that lived there had been touching her and that Timmy</p>
<p>and him got into a fight.</p>
<p>We bleeped the man&rsquo;s name, but we aren&rsquo;t done talking about him, so we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>call him Jerome.</p>
<p>Rosalind recounted Anna&rsquo;s story of hearing two gunshots inside the home on the night</p>
<p>Timmy Joe died, and she went downstairs to see what was happening.</p>
<p>She says that&rsquo;s when she saw her mom, Jerome, and her uncle in the living room.</p>
<p>Timmy was laying on the rug because she had come back downstairs, that&rsquo;s what she said.</p>
<p>And Timmy was laying on the rug and that Keisha had the gun in her hand.</p>
<p>She said there was a guy there that looked like Timmy.</p>
<p>I said, hmm, and they made her go upstairs.</p>
<p>Now there is a discrepancy here between Rosalind&rsquo;s account and other reporting on Timmy Joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case, specifically from an article by Philip Bailey for Leo Weekly.</p>
<p>Rosalind was clear in saying Keisha was the one with the gun in her hand, but the Leo</p>
<p>Weekly article states that it was Jerome who did the shooting.</p>
<p>Regardless of the discrepancy, Rosalind went on to say that Anna told her that she watched</p>
<p>from her window upstairs as her mother and Jerome took the rug with Timmy Joe&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>inside and placed it in the trunk of her vehicle before driving off.</p>
<p>Now, Rosalind said that she was skeptical at first because Anna was young and maybe</p>
<p>she misremembered what she saw.</p>
<p>So she asked Anna if she was sure.</p>
<p>I said, well, how did you know it was Timmy?</p>
<p>She said, you know, Nana, Timmy was big and tall and he had his wig on.</p>
<p>She said, and I could see his hair.</p>
<p>She said, after they left, mommy called me downstairs and she beat me and told me, I</p>
<p>better not never tell you.</p>
<p>When Rosalind finished her story, investigators were stunned, but they were also hesitant.</p>
<p>This was the biggest tip they&rsquo;d gotten in over a year, but they couldn&rsquo;t rely solely</p>
<p>on Anna&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>Not to mention investigators on the scene already determined that Timmy Joe wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dumped there.</p>
<p>Remember, they thought that he was shot right there at the scene.</p>
<p>Sure, they could always be wrong, but investigators thought the evidence just wasn&rsquo;t lining up.</p>
<p>Well, you have to take that seriously because her story, it has validity to it.</p>
<p>It sounds legit.</p>
<p>Problem is, she&rsquo;s young.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you and I talking right now, we can have a conversation.</p>
<p>I can ask you questions.</p>
<p>You can answer those questions directly.</p>
<p>But with a child, seven, six, seven, eight years old, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You have to do a special type of interview.</p>
<p>You have to do a forensic interview.</p>
<p>And the forensic interview is very delicate because you can&rsquo;t just ask the questions.</p>
<p>Even though interviews with children about tough topics can be challenging, a child interview</p>
<p>specialist spoke with Anna on December 13th.</p>
<p>She told the story with the same details Rosalind had initially relayed to police.</p>
<p>But a few things stood out.</p>
<p>They try to pick up on key phrases.</p>
<p>Key phrases that a normal child would not use in the standard conversation.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re using verbiage that doesn&rsquo;t fit their education level or their age level,</p>
<p>those are prime signs that this kid has been told specific things to say.</p>
<p>In the forensic interview, she alluded to there being some phrases that were utilized</p>
<p>in the interview and that that wasn&rsquo;t normal.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a normal vernacular for a child of that child&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>But investigators couldn&rsquo;t fully look into Anna&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>You see, the townhome where she said all of this happened had been torn down earlier that</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>So they couldn&rsquo;t even search it for physical evidence if they wanted to.</p>
<p>And since the search of the car back in June 2005 hadn&rsquo;t yielded any evidence that Timmy</p>
<p>Joe had been in the trunk, their skepticism only grew.</p>
<p>Still, just to be sure, they crossed all their Ts and dotted all their Is.</p>
<p>They brought Keisha in for an interview.</p>
<p>She even agreed to take a polygraph, which she passed.</p>
<p>And you all know how I feel about polygraphs and how unreliable they are.</p>
<p>But with those results and no physical evidence to implicate her, there wasn&rsquo;t a case against</p>
<p>Keisha.</p>
<p>But still, they decided to look into Jerome.</p>
<p>He was Keisha&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend who still hung out with her every once in a while.</p>
<p>And while investigators did track him down for an interview, Lt. Burbank wasn&rsquo;t sure</p>
<p>if they learned anything substantial.</p>
<p>I know they interviewed him, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any documentation as to what the interview</p>
<p>stated.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And there was no documentation of, like, a polygraph?</p>
<p>Not with this, not with this second person, no.</p>
<p>And this was a significant piece at the time.</p>
<p>It seemed like a pretty good lead.</p>
<p>Problem was, it just didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>
<p>Like I told you before, Keisha passed a polygraph.</p>
<p>Now, can you pass a polygraph and still be guilty?</p>
<p>Absolutely, you can.</p>
<p>But when you take into consideration all of the other stuff that was looked at, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appear that Keisha has anything to do with this.</p>
<p>She has no motive for doing it.</p>
<p>So investigators were back to square one, where they remained for months and then years.</p>
<p>They said they did their best to keep the search for Timmy Joe&rsquo;s killer going.</p>
<p>And Rosalynn kept her ear to the ground and brought up new names of people that she thought</p>
<p>might be involved.</p>
<p>But none of them panned out.</p>
<p>A few years after her initial claims, Rosalynn came forward and said that Anna made a shocking</p>
<p>confession to her.</p>
<p>She said, uh, oh yeah, Nana, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to talk to you about that.</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<p>You lied?</p>
<p>Yes, because I was mad mommy gave me up.</p>
<p>Oh, I said, so you made up that whole story?</p>
<p>Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>I said, I don&rsquo;t believe you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re going to be an adult and there&rsquo;s going to come a day that this is going to</p>
<p>come back and bite you in your butt.</p>
<p>Why are you lying?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my mother.</p>
<p>I have to protect my mother.</p>
<p>What are you protecting your mother from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my mother.</p>
<p>So one of my sons was here.</p>
<p>I said, so you&rsquo;re sitting here in the car.</p>
<p>I said, if I go in there right now and kill Elliot, your uncle Elliot, I said, is that</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Why are you protecting your mother?</p>
<p>Why are you lying?</p>
<p>Rosalind remained convinced that Keisha, at the very least, knew something about Timmy</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s murder, because she fully believes what her granddaughter told her in 2006.</p>
<p>And this is part of the investigation that did and still does deeply trouble Rosalind.</p>
<p>She thinks the police department made a horrible mistake not believing Anna simply because</p>
<p>she was a child using words other kids her age wouldn&rsquo;t use.</p>
<p>She said that was Anna, incredibly smart, with a vocabulary beyond her years.</p>
<p>And she suggested that the failure of police to listen to Anna&rsquo;s story points to a larger</p>
<p>issue within law enforcement, viewing children as unreliable witnesses just because of their</p>
<p>age.</p>
<p>Even as Rosalind clung to the story her granddaughter had told her, police moved on to a different</p>
<p>lead, one that they thought was more promising.</p>
<p>In 2012, they got a hit from CODIS on the DNA sample from the scene.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Burbrink wouldn&rsquo;t reveal the name of the man who was a match.</p>
<p>What we know is that he had been incarcerated for something else, hence his DNA being put</p>
<p>into CODIS.</p>
<p>But before they went to visit him, they told Rosalind his name and asked if she knew him.</p>
<p>Now, she said she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So they go see this guy, and during their interview, they ask this man if he had been</p>
<p>with or knew a man named Timmy Joe or a man who occasionally dressed in traditionally</p>
<p>feminine clothing.</p>
<p>This guy denied all of it, repeatedly.</p>
<p>That is, until they showed him a picture of Timmy Joe dressed in feminine fashion and</p>
<p>a wig.</p>
<p>But when she shows him a picture of Timmy Joe dressed as a woman, he has a visceral</p>
<p>reaction.</p>
<p>He has a reaction that shows.</p>
<p>Despite that reaction, the guy still claimed not to know anyone fitting Timmy Joe&rsquo;s description.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when investigators switched tactics.</p>
<p>They asked the man if he knew anyone named Rosalind, and he said yes.</p>
<p>He told investigators that in 2005, he&rsquo;d had a casual relationship with a woman named</p>
<p>Rosalind who lived in the same housing complex as Timmy Joe&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t enough to build a concrete connection.</p>
<p>The complex that she lived in was big.</p>
<p>There were like 500 residents at the time of the murder.</p>
<p>So they thought the chances of there being two Rosalinds living there in 2005 wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>totally out of the question, especially when Rosalind had already denied knowing this guy.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell based on the case file whether or not we know for a fact the Rosalind he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>speaking about is Rosalind Blair.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to assume his DNA is on Timmy Joe or something that Timmy Joe is carrying</p>
<p>simply because we think that this guy and Rosalind had some type of relationship.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that to be fact.</p>
<p>We went back to the DNA and asked Lieutenant Burbank about that, though.</p>
<p>And he said the DNA wasn&rsquo;t strong enough evidence on its own, because he said if this</p>
<p>man did know Timmy Joe&rsquo;s mom, then the DNA could have easily been a transfer due to proximity,</p>
<p>such as maybe sharing a laundry basket.</p>
<p>We start talking about DNA, and obviously that&rsquo;s a buzzword.</p>
<p>People hear DNA, they&rsquo;re like, DNA, man, they&rsquo;re going to knock this one down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of factors that go into where the DNA was located, how it could have been</p>
<p>located and how it could have been transferred from point A to point B.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough information from the return results on what we got.</p>
<p>And if we were ever able to determine whether or not this guy might have had a legitimate</p>
<p>reason to have DNA where we found the DNA.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m real hesitant on putting that out there because I don&rsquo;t have enough information</p>
<p>to be able to intelligently say this is what it was.</p>
<p>Now our reporter reached out to Rosalind to confirm whether she knew this guy.</p>
<p>And again, she said she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In fact, she said that she lived in Indiana in 2005, not the apartment complex police</p>
<p>claim she lived at.</p>
<p>So if the man did actually have a relationship with a woman named Rosalind at that complex,</p>
<p>it couldn&rsquo;t have been her.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Lieutenant Burbank makes it seem like the DNA could have ended up on</p>
<p>Timmy Joe in a totally innocent way, which doesn&rsquo;t seem possible if this guy and Rosalind</p>
<p>both say they don&rsquo;t know each other.</p>
<p>There are so many questions about this detail that I just don&rsquo;t have answers for, and investigators</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>After all of that, the lead just fizzled out.</p>
<p>The case went cold yet again, and it remains cold to this day.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Burbank was assigned the case in 2013 when he transferred to the Homicide Unit,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t able to stir up anything new.</p>
<p>Keisha isn&rsquo;t considered a suspect or even a person of interest by detectives, although</p>
<p>Rosalind remains convinced that she knows more than she&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>And while most people today wouldn&rsquo;t even blink at Timmy Joe&rsquo;s sexuality and expression,</p>
<p>the culture back in 2005 wasn&rsquo;t as open.</p>
<p>So our reporter asked Lieutenant Burbank if he&rsquo;s considered whether the murder could</p>
<p>have been a hate crime.</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;d be naive if I didn&rsquo;t believe that his lifestyle led to this in some capacity.</p>
<p>How much that is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is that sickening?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>But I think it does play a role in it.</p>
<p>But I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever to be able to say that with any definitiveness.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you, yes, this is absolutely a hate crime.</p>
<p>Of course, they can&rsquo;t 100% confirm that Timmy Joe&rsquo;s death was motivated by hate,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s unsolved.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know who did it.</p>
<p>But considering all the factors — he was gay, he was a black man in Kentucky in 2005</p>
<p>who dressed in traditionally feminine clothing — there are elements that make a hate crime</p>
<p>seem pretty strong.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t forget that Timmy Joe was harassed by that group of guys Dee Dee says they saw</p>
<p>outside the bar.</p>
<p>So if they were aggressive to him for just being himself, who&rsquo;s to say someone else</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do the same thing later that night?</p>
<p>Now if you remember Maggie Long&rsquo;s story that I told you a few weeks ago, they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sure that that was a hate crime either.</p>
<p>But they were able to look at the surrounding circumstances and say, we don&rsquo;t know for</p>
<p>sure, but there&rsquo;s a high probability that her race or gender had something to do with</p>
<p>the way she was killed.</p>
<p>So even though law enforcement isn&rsquo;t convinced, I&rsquo;m not ready to take it off the table.</p>
<p>And to top it all off, as of this recording, Timmy Joe&rsquo;s case isn&rsquo;t being investigated</p>
<p>at all.</p>
<p>The Louisville Metro Police Department&rsquo;s Cold Case Unit only has three people assigned</p>
<p>to more than 600 cases, and it&rsquo;s undergoing a total overhaul of its procedures for calculating</p>
<p>which cases to prioritize based on, quote, solvability.</p>
<p>Even with a positive DNA hit, Lt. Burbank told our reporter where Timmy Joe&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>falls on that list.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;d say that Timothy&rsquo;s case right now would rank towards the bottom.</p>
<p>And I hate to say that, but just to be 100% transparent and honest, that&rsquo;s where it would rank.</p>
<p>Policy and procedure don&rsquo;t matter to Rosalind, though.</p>
<p>For good reason, she was upset to hear Lt. Burbank straight up say that her son&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>is at the bottom of his unit&rsquo;s investigative priority list.</p>
<p>She suggested it&rsquo;s time for LMPD to bring Keisha and Anna back in for interviews since</p>
<p>so many years have gone by.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s time they re-interview the man whose DNA was found.</p>
<p>Since Lt. Burbank took the case, he and Rosalind have struck up a professional but strained</p>
<p>relationship as 17 years have passed with no closure for the family and no justice for</p>
<p>Timmy Joe.</p>
<p>17 years is a long time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Lt. Burbank told you how many times I&rsquo;ve called and he says, I just admire</p>
<p>your persistence.</p>
<p>Do you really think I&rsquo;m going to go away?</p>
<p>Not until the day I die, and you better hope I don&rsquo;t find that door back.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s a lot more to Tim&rsquo;s case that maybe Tim got mixed up in.</p>
<p>Maybe we can save some other people because we can&rsquo;t save my son because he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>These people need to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>And I am depending on Lt. Burbank and his gang and people out there that know what happened</p>
<p>to Timmy to come forward and tell the truth.</p>
<p>He has nieces and nephews that he&rsquo;s never seen.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t there when I had my lung surgery and I know he would have been there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d have been there with me.</p>
<p>Rosalind and all the other people who loved Timmy Joe deserve answers.</p>
<p>And someone out there has the answers to bring his loved ones some peace.</p>
<p>So please, if you have any information about Timothy Blair&rsquo;s murder in 2005, you can call</p>
