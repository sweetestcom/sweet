between a stroke or a heart attack which one would you rather have now of course you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want either but if you had to pick one which one would you rather have but go ahead and tell me in the comments down below i&amp;rsquo;m very curious a stroke is basically either a clot or plaquing that has dislodged somewhere in your body either in the carotid arteries through here or the heart and it&amp;rsquo;s gone up into your brain and it&amp;rsquo;s stopping blood flow now the heart attack we have a clot or a plaque that&amp;rsquo;s stopping blood flow in the heart muscle so in reality a stroke and a heart attack is really the exact same thing but in different locations in the body now for me i would much rather have a heart attack than a stroke because having half of your body being paralyzed and then having your spouse drag you around clean you bathe you take you everywhere oh my gosh that would be such a burden on your spouse and to be trapped in a body where half of your body is non-functional would be literally torture now with a heart attack which has a 12 mortality versus a stroke which has a 28 mortality we have become really good at keeping people alive so when people have a heart attack there&amp;rsquo;s really great emergency care that can recover a person but the number one cause of death is a heart attack and with a stroke that&amp;rsquo;s the fifth cause of death now they use this acronym for a stroke so f would be your face is drooping on one side you&amp;rsquo;re losing muscle control and a would stand for your arm on one side being weak or even paralyzed and then we have s for speech difficulty you&amp;rsquo;re splurring you can&amp;rsquo;t really articulate as well and then you have tea for time there&amp;rsquo;s no time for waste if someone has a stroke you want to call 9-1-1 get them into the hospital so they can quickly give you a certain medication to dissolve the clot usually you have up to six hours but the sooner the better now what&amp;rsquo;s really bizarre about a heart attack is 48 of the us population has a heart problem and many times they don&amp;rsquo;t even know it all right so you can get all these tests done and you can get your arteries scoped and you should you should get a test called the cac it stands for coronary artery calcification test or skin it&amp;rsquo;s a quick test to measure how much calcium is in the artery and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best predictors of heart attacks and obviously if there&amp;rsquo;s calcium there&amp;rsquo;s plaquing and some of that plaque can get dislodged and travel up to your brain but the underlying mechanism the root cause for both of these problems is exactly the same because they both originate in the heart well sometimes a stroke can originate from problems in your carotid arteries through your in your neck through here but most of the time it actually comes from your heart you have this piece of plaque that dislodges from the heart goes up to the brain so the mechanism is this you have inflammation in the inside of your arteries which is then creating a compensatory or compensating reaction where your body is going to try to heal with a band-aid the body&amp;rsquo;s band-aid is calcium cholesterol and certain proteins like fibrous tissue and that inflammation if you&amp;rsquo;ve been watching my videos is either coming from the over consumption of the bad carbs refined carbohydrates and sugar or too many omega-6 fatty acids which is in pretty much all the foods like the soy oil the corn oil the canola oil which is the majority of your salad dressing and deep fried foods and the list goes on and on and on and of course we switched over to these omega-6 fatty acids because we thought that saturated fats were bad for you when in fact they are not bad for you as long as you keep your carbs low now let&amp;rsquo;s say for example you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go get a test and you want other clues to know if you have inflammation in your arteries number one just do this right now stand up and look down at your toes if you happen to see something obstructing your view called your belly okay your belly sticking out chances are you have inflammation in your arteries because belly fat is a symptom of too much insulin and too much blood glucose and both of those are like steel wool or sandpaper for the inside of your arteries number two look in the mirror at your face do you have a swollen face look around the eyes are they puffy are your cheeks puffy do you have fat in your neck it&amp;rsquo;s a really good indication that you have too much insulin too much blood glucose and that means that your arteries are also inflamed all right number three are you a carbo junkie do you crave carbs do you eat chips late at night do you always have to have a dessert do you always have the fries when you order a hamburger do you basically do carbs if you do chances are you have inflammation in the arteries now there are three things i&amp;rsquo;m going to recommend number one i&amp;rsquo;m going to recommend you get some vitamin e immediately the type of vitamin e you need to get is called tocatrinos okay take about 300 milligrams every single day and that&amp;rsquo;s going to help reduce the oxidation or the free radicals that&amp;rsquo;s going on in the inside of your arteries vitamin e is the absolute best nutrient for the heart number two you want to lower your carbs okay that&amp;rsquo;s called the ketogenic plan and number three and this is actually just as important as number two you want to do intermittent fasting you want to stop the snacking you want to skip your breakfast because that will instantly lower the amount of insulin that&amp;rsquo;s being pumped through your body which i bet anything you&amp;rsquo;ve never had that tested there&amp;rsquo;s a great test to do it&amp;rsquo;s called homa ir and they usually are focused on the blood sugars but they don&amp;rsquo;t check the fasting insulin which is usually high way before you have high blood glucose in fact it&amp;rsquo;s the thing in the background that&amp;rsquo;s pushing your blood sugars down so when you get your blood sugars checked they appear to be normal which in fact the only reason that they&amp;rsquo;re normal is because the insulin is so high pushing your blood sugar down so anyway comment down below and tell me which condition you would rather have if you&amp;rsquo;re forced to have either so if you&amp;rsquo;re enjoying my content which i hope you are and you&amp;rsquo;re applying this knowledge

attack which one would you rather have now of  </p><p>course you wouldn&rsquo;t want either but if you had to 
pick one which one would you rather have but go  </p><p>ahead and tell me in the comments down below i&rsquo;m 
very curious a stroke is basically either a clot  </p><p>or plaquing that has dislodged somewhere in your 
body either in the carotid arteries through here  </p><p>or the heart and it&rsquo;s gone up into your brain and 
it&rsquo;s stopping blood flow now the heart attack we  </p><p>have a clot or a plaque that&rsquo;s stopping blood 
flow in the heart muscle so in reality a stroke  </p><p>and a heart attack is really the exact same thing 
but in different locations in the body now for me  </p><p>i would much rather have a heart attack than a 
stroke because having half of your body being  </p><p>paralyzed and then having your spouse drag you 
around clean you bathe you take you everywhere  </p><p>oh my gosh that would be such a burden on your 
spouse and to be trapped in a body where half of  </p><p>your body is non-functional would be literally 
torture now with a heart attack which has a 12  </p><p>mortality versus a stroke which has a 28 mortality 
we have become really good at keeping people alive  </p><p>so when people have a heart attack there&rsquo;s really 
great emergency care that can recover a person  </p><p>but the number one cause of death is a heart 
attack and with a stroke that&rsquo;s the fifth cause  </p><p>of death now they use this acronym for a stroke 
so f would be your face is drooping on one side  </p><p>you&rsquo;re losing muscle control and a would stand for 
your arm on one side being weak or even paralyzed  </p><p>and then we have s for speech difficulty you&rsquo;re 
splurring you can&rsquo;t really articulate as well  </p><p>and then you have tea for 
time there&rsquo;s no time for waste  </p><p>if someone has a stroke you want to call 9-1-1 
get them into the hospital so they can quickly  </p><p>give you a certain medication to dissolve the 
clot usually you have up to six hours but the  </p><p>sooner the better now what&rsquo;s really 
bizarre about a heart attack is 48  </p><p>of the us population has a heart problem and 
many times they don&rsquo;t even know it all right  </p><p>so you can get all these tests done and you 
can get your arteries scoped and you should  </p><p>you should get a test called the cac it stands 
for coronary artery calcification test or skin  </p><p>it&rsquo;s a quick test to measure how much calcium is 
in the artery and it&rsquo;s one of the best predictors  </p><p>of heart attacks and obviously if there&rsquo;s calcium 
there&rsquo;s plaquing and some of that plaque can  </p><p>get dislodged and travel up to your brain but 
the underlying mechanism the root cause for both  </p><p>of these problems is exactly the same because 
they both originate in the heart well sometimes  </p><p>a stroke can originate from problems in your 
carotid arteries through your in your neck through  </p><p>here but most of the time it actually comes from 
your heart you have this piece of plaque that  </p><p>dislodges from the heart goes up to the brain so 
the mechanism is this you have inflammation in the  </p><p>inside of your arteries which is then creating a 
compensatory or compensating reaction where your  </p><p>body is going to try to heal with a band-aid 
the body&rsquo;s band-aid is calcium cholesterol  </p><p>and certain proteins like fibrous tissue and that 
inflammation if you&rsquo;ve been watching my videos  </p><p>is either coming from the over consumption of 
the bad carbs refined carbohydrates and sugar  </p><p>or too many omega-6 fatty acids which is in pretty 
much all the foods like the soy oil the corn oil  </p><p>the canola oil which is the majority of your salad 
dressing and deep fried foods and the list goes on  </p><p>and on and on and of course we switched over to 
these omega-6 fatty acids because we thought that  </p><p>saturated fats were bad for you when in fact they 
are not bad for you as long as you keep your carbs  </p><p>low now let&rsquo;s say for example you don&rsquo;t want 
to go get a test and you want other clues  </p><p>to know if you have inflammation in your 
arteries number one just do this right now  </p><p>stand up and look down at your toes if you 
happen to see something obstructing your view  </p><p>called your belly okay your belly sticking out 
chances are you have inflammation in your arteries  </p><p>because belly fat is a symptom of too much 
insulin and too much blood glucose and both  </p><p>of those are like steel wool or sandpaper 
for the inside of your arteries number two  </p><p>look in the mirror at your face do you have a 
swollen face look around the eyes are they puffy  </p><p>are your cheeks puffy do you have fat in your 
neck it&rsquo;s a really good indication that you  </p><p>have too much insulin too much blood glucose and 
that means that your arteries are also inflamed  </p><p>all right number three are you a carbo junkie do 
you crave carbs do you eat chips late at night do  </p><p>you always have to have a dessert do you always 
have the fries when you order a hamburger do you  </p><p>basically do carbs if you do chances are you have 
inflammation in the arteries now there are three  </p><p>things i&rsquo;m going to recommend number one i&rsquo;m going 
to recommend you get some vitamin e immediately  </p><p>the type of vitamin e you need to get is called 
tocatrinos okay take about 300 milligrams every  </p><p>single day and that&rsquo;s going to help reduce the 
oxidation or the free radicals that&rsquo;s going on  </p><p>in the inside of your arteries vitamin e is the 
absolute best nutrient for the heart number two  </p><p>you want to lower your carbs okay that&rsquo;s called 
the ketogenic plan and number three and this is  </p><p>actually just as important as number two you want 
to do intermittent fasting you want to stop the  </p><p>snacking you want to skip your breakfast because 
that will instantly lower the amount of insulin  </p><p>that&rsquo;s being pumped through your body which i bet 
anything you&rsquo;ve never had that tested there&rsquo;s a  </p><p>great test to do it&rsquo;s called homa ir and they 
usually are focused on the blood sugars but they  </p><p>don&rsquo;t check the fasting insulin which is usually 
high way before you have high blood glucose  </p><p>in fact it&rsquo;s the thing in the background that&rsquo;s 
pushing your blood sugars down so when you get  </p><p>your blood sugars checked they appear to be 
normal which in fact the only reason that  </p><p>they&rsquo;re normal is because the insulin is so high 
pushing your blood sugar down so anyway comment  </p><p>down below and tell me which condition you would 
rather have if you&rsquo;re forced to have either so if  </p><p>you&rsquo;re enjoying my content which i hope you are 
and you&rsquo;re applying this knowledge to your health  </p><p>and you have a success i&rsquo;d really appreciate you 
sharing your success story so click the link down  </p><p>below to my website where you can upload your
