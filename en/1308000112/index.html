    <p>Hey, everybody, welcome to Episode 98 of the all in podcast with us again. The sultan of science,</p>
<p>the Queen of quinoa looks like he brought a trucker hat. What are you getting jealous of</p>
<p>the Montclair hat? Or are you just not bathing? No, I need a haircut. I haven&rsquo;t had a haircut</p>
<p>like six weeks. I&rsquo;m getting my haircut this afternoon. It&rsquo;s not going to make a difference.</p>
<p>I think what Freeberg is trying to tell us is that he is the Zodiac killer.</p>
<p>All right, there is the unibar. All right. And Montclair sacks is here with his $400</p>
<p>Montclair hat. And of course, the dictator himself. I asked Ron, I asked Ron to cut my</p>
<p>hair so that the white patch is more prominent. I think he did a good job.</p>
<p>Do you add the white patch with coloring? Or is it?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s natural. It&rsquo;s just there. It&rsquo;s just there. No, it looks so odd. If you</p>
<p>were doing it on purpose. It&rsquo;s super random. I like the way it looks. I like the way it looks.</p>
<p>Jay Leno had a look like that. I&rsquo;m about to go by the way, you know,</p>
<p>this in the fall in truffle season, I like to grow it so that it&rsquo;s more wavy</p>
<p>white for white truffle season. Got it. I needed to have a reset cut</p>
<p>so that then we could grow a wavy for the fall for truffle season.</p>
<p>Listen to math. The only thing less relevant to us than your cashmere sweaters is your haircut.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>All right, suck announced a hiring freeze and a reorg at meta. He also said meta will reduce</p>
<p>headcount for the first time in its history. Metas headcount in 2023 will be smaller than it was</p>
<p>this year, he called at the end of an era of rapid growth. This on top of Apple reporting and</p>
<p>Apple got walloped in the market for the first time in forever. Apple pullback iPhone production</p>
<p>for the 14 after slower than anticipated demand. As I mentioned on previous episodes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve kind of done a gentleman&rsquo;s layoff. Similar to, I think meta in that Apple said you have to</p>
<p>be back in the office three days a week, a bunch of people quit. So you don&rsquo;t have to pay them,</p>
<p>I guess huge packages when they quit that way. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also called out employees</p>
<p>in July, as you guys all read. And he wrote, there are real concerns that our productivity</p>
<p>as a whole is not where it needs to be for the headcount. We have Google, of course,</p>
<p>hundred and 74,000 employees. So I guess the question I have for you is, are these the last</p>
<p>towers to fall to mouth in this pullback that we&rsquo;ve seen, these are companies that don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to do the layoffs, they have tons of cash. So they&rsquo;re obviously doing that to maintain earnings,</p>
<p>one would, and to maybe send a signal to employees that they need to work harder,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your read on these this past week&rsquo;s shoes to drop?</p>
<p>Well, it definitely is the end of an era, I think it is sort of like the,</p>
<p>the end of this phase of big tech, where you had this, you know, unfettered growth,</p>
<p>where these business models were largely unassailable. And they,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re really just fighting to grow into their valuation and just generate more revenue</p>
<p>to justify where they where they traded at. And now it&rsquo;s this next phase where they have to</p>
<p>operate more like a cash cow business. And so you know, it&rsquo;s an acknowledgement that</p>
<p>the growth is tapering. It&rsquo;s an acknowledgement that they&rsquo;re going to trade on a pretty tight</p>
<p>band in terms of multiple, which means that they have to manage expenses much more tightly,</p>
<p>which means that they can&rsquo;t have a really broad based surface area in which to operate an</p>
<p>experiment, you have to keep the experiments small, you have to manage your expenses,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have employees basically, you know, run over the place management has to have a firm hand</p>
<p>in in dictating strategy and what people work on. So I think all of that signals that I actually</p>
<p>Jason, I don&rsquo;t think this is the end, I actually think it&rsquo;s the beginning, because these companies,</p>
<p>Apple, Facebook, Google, maybe a little bit Microsoft are the most sensitive to valuation,</p>
<p>because they are the most widely held, right? These are the these are the, you know, the</p>
<p>equivalent of us treasuries in the equity markets, the safest, most predictable, safe haven in times</p>
<p>of stress, if you want to own big, chunky cash flow generating businesses that you know, are</p>
<p>relatively unassailable, you couldn&rsquo;t pick for better businesses than those. And so the fact</p>
<p>that they see enough in the horizon, to say that we need to batten down the hatches should be a</p>
<p>warning to everybody else. Freeberg is it as simple as this, that the they&rsquo;re moving from top</p>
<p>line growth to bottom line, and they&rsquo;re going to need to look at the expenses. What&rsquo;s your read on</p>
<p>this for Silicon Valley? Well, I just want to zoom out for a second, because I remember I started</p>
<p>working in Silicon Valley in 2001. You guys are a little older than me, I think, but like we were</p>
<p>right at the kind of year one of the.com implosion, and all the fallout that happened from all the</p>
<p>funding that happened from 97 to 99 2000. And so from 01 to 03, it was super like deflationary,</p>
<p>everyone was cutting costs, and all the money that had been raised was kind of being pissed</p>
<p>away, or companies were liquidating, and you know, so on. And then starting in 2004, which is actually</p>
<p>when I joined Google, but there was also this big movement starting on 304 of like what people</p>
<p>called web two, then kind of new business models and new businesses started to emerge that seemed</p>
<p>to have real traction and real legs. And it was a different story, and a much more rational story</p>
<p>than what you saw leading up to kind of 2000 2001. And it was around that time when Google</p>
<p>started offering these crazy benefits, right? It was like, there&rsquo;s a gym and free food and all these</p>
<p>amazing workplace. And suddenly, everyone had to do that to keep up, right? Facebook obviously mimicked</p>
<p>it, all the other big companies mimicked it, and then it became mainstay. And they also raised</p>
<p>compensation in the valley significantly, because Google had really cracked the nut on how to extract</p>
<p>value from the internet. And it really changed everything in Silicon Valley and changed everything</p>
<p>in tech. Because suddenly, every tech company, whether you are enterprise software or hardware,</p>
<p>or an internet e commerce site, to be competitive and hire great talent, you have to have the same</p>
<p>sort of environment, high wages, great salaries, really share the value with your employees,</p>
<p>you know, gyms and free food and all this sort of stuff. So it&rsquo;s the first time I think in a</p>
<p>generation since like 2003 2004, that we&rsquo;re seeing things start to turn the other way,</p>
<p>where instead of adding more benefits, you know, making things more attractive,</p>
<p>giving more value to employees, we&rsquo;re really seeing the recession hit these kind of leading</p>
<p>indicators of how things are going to be in the valley. And as a result, I think we should expect</p>
<p>to see a similar impact on compensation, on benefits, on value share, and on kind of proclivity</p>
<p>to hire an opportunity to kind of jump jobs and you know, opportunities that we&rsquo;ve all kind of</p>
<p>taken for granted over the past 18 years. And this is going to be a real shock to a lot of</p>
<p>people that work in tech. And a lot of people that have gotten used to the idea that every company</p>
<p>offers great benefits, there&rsquo;s always another job to jump to, it&rsquo;ll pay you more. And that that as</p>
<p>that engine of growth that was really driven by these big companies by Google, Facebook, Apple</p>
<p>starts to slow, no one needs to compete with them anymore as much and the compensation bands get</p>
<p>tighter, and the option value gets tighter and the free stuff gets tighter. So it&rsquo;s the end of</p>
<p>an era. And I think it&rsquo;s a new world for tech and Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts here in terms of startups in relation to big tech,</p>
<p>maybe having these austerity measures kick in and refocusing on profitability?</p>
<p>The big takeaway here is just that nobody is safe. And it&rsquo;s not just startups have to,</p>
<p>you know, tighten their belts, it&rsquo;s these big companies too. And I think we&rsquo;re headed for</p>
<p>a broad based recession. That&rsquo;s what it seems like. You saw Druckenmiller&rsquo;s comments this week,</p>
<p>predicting a hard landing in 2023. No one&rsquo;s talking about soft landing anymore. In fact,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all wondering who&rsquo;s flying the plane. So I think we&rsquo;re headed for a pretty</p>
<p>big recession. And I just take it in a slightly different direction. I&rsquo;m down here in LA,</p>
<p>had dinner the other night with a friend who&rsquo;s a showrunner in Hollywood. And so a showrunner</p>
<p>basically is like the head writer, and they basically put together the writing team and</p>
<p>the content for a show, and then they sell them to networks. He said that like,</p>
<p>no one is buying anything anymore here. That last year, you had, there was tremendous</p>
<p>activity. And you saw like the Game of Thrones guys, you know, D&amp;D, they got like a $300 million</p>
<p>deal from Netflix and Shonda Rhimes got a $300 million deal. These are like the platform deals</p>
<p>they did, yeah. Yeah, they got like, there were massive multi hundred million dollar deals being</p>
<p>made last year. And that was just for like future writing deals. Like Netflix wasn&rsquo;t even buying</p>
<p>libraries when they did those deals. They were locking down talent for the next. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So all of that has stopped. And the reason is that Netflix&rsquo;s stock has been hammered, right?</p>
<p>And only so they not have the capital to do those kinds of crazy deals anymore. But they know that</p>
<p>Wall Street is watching them. And so fundamentally, they&rsquo;re questioning whether a business model even</p>
<p>works if they have to spend that much money on content. So then all of Netflix&rsquo;s competitors</p>
<p>basically have stopped. So this whole like frothy environment that you had for in Hollywood last</p>
<p>year, that&rsquo;s just over the faucets been turned off. And it&rsquo;s not even turned off to a trickle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just stopped. So you think that this like massive asset bubble that we had last year was</p>
<p>just in crypto and gross stocks. It&rsquo;s not I think it actually trickled down into the real economy</p>
<p>because Netflix was one of those gross stocks, the money then flowed into writers in Hollywood,</p>
<p>and then lots of other places. This is one small example, right, that that this asset bubble</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t purely just something that&rsquo;s gonna be localized to crypto, it affects real people</p>
<p>in the real economy. And we are just beginning to see the unwind of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s absolutely correct, I think is people were more risk taking, they had free capital,</p>
<p>they wanted to place more bets. And sure, why wouldn&rsquo;t you bet on the game with our own writers</p>
<p>for the next decade. But looking at this is going to be fantastic for startups. I mean,</p>
<p>the startups I&rsquo;ve worked with over the last five years have been, they always come to me,</p>
<p>oh, I got a developer, but this person&rsquo;s got three offers from, you know, Facebook, Google.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, how do I land this person, they got $300,000 a year, offering a million dollars</p>
<p>in RSUs. And basically, founders had to say, No, I can&rsquo;t get that person. And so they had to get</p>
<p>creative. And they would hire people, Ukraine, Uruguay, everywhere in between, to try to find</p>
<p>developer talent, and they had to get creative. Now, all of those people are not going to have</p>
<p>four job offers, they&rsquo;re going to have no job offers, they may have gotten laid off.</p>
<p>And those crazy, unrealistic out of school deals are going to be gone. And this means</p>
<p>massive consolidation of talent. You look at the startups community right now, tons of companies</p>
<p>are just going out of business, they&rsquo;re packing it in, those people are going to go work at the</p>
<p>other startups that are stronger. So whoever makes it out of this as a startup, this is how the cycle</p>
<p>restarts, is talent then consolidates on the winner. So it&rsquo;d be like taking the NBA and getting</p>
<p>rid of the bottom, you know, 10 teams, and just telling the best players there, move up to the</p>
<p>other teams, and everybody else, you&rsquo;re out of the league. So I think this is incredible setup for</p>
<p>2023, for startups to consolidate talent. So I&rsquo;m actually excited to see us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another data point that, again, I said it last week, I&rsquo;ll go out on a limb and predict</p>
<p>my equivalent November fall predictions. Last fall, it was at the markets, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>poop the bed. My prediction now is that I think the markets are bottoming and consolidating.</p>
<p>Yep. 100%.</p>
<p>And this is the time, I think, to start nibbling and start getting ready to really rip the money</p>
<p>in. And I think there&rsquo;s enough signals every day that kind of like, tell me at least that on the</p>
<p>margin. It&rsquo;s time because I think the markets do a reasonably good job of digesting news,</p>
<p>and then pricing the forward reality, right? Like today&rsquo;s price is really everything we</p>
<p>already know. And so the real guess is what&rsquo;s about to happen in the future. And from my</p>
<p>perspective, I&rsquo;m actually pretty starting to get a little constructive here. I think that</p>
<p>when companies like Facebook really do this, and, you know, like, if you think about it one way,</p>
<p>the financial markets have always had this thing that we have called a Fed put, what does that</p>
<p>mean a put is essentially the right to sell something. And what market participants have</p>
<p>always known for the last decade is that if things got very hairy, if there was uncertainty in the</p>
<p>market, the Federal Reserve would and they have consistently stepped in to create a buyer of last</p>
<p>resort. And so it always eliminated that last part of true, you know, supply demand balance,</p>
<p>because they would just come and say, Don&rsquo;t worry, in many ways in tech, what the big tech companies</p>
<p>were, were that, you know, you could never really find what the true market clearing price for an</p>
<p>engineer was, or what the true amount of expenses you should spend on office space, or, you know,</p>
<p>free services, because you always always had these companies, which was an escalating arms race,</p>
<p>you know, if one company had a massage, the next company had gyms and massage and physical</p>
<p>therapists, and the other company would have buses to take you to the gyms and massage,</p>
<p>and therapists, and the next company would have protein shakes that were freshly made,</p>
<p>you know, and it just kept escalating and escalating, because the costs didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And they wanted, if nothing else, to get that marginal engineer, or product manager, or business</p>
<p>person to work at their company, which eliminated the risk that they would actually start something</p>
<p>to disrupt them. Blocker strategies very real, you should have a blocker strategies</p>
<p>is very real. So when you take this big tech put out of the market, you will get true price</p>
<p>discovery. And you will find out what the real price should be. For this kind of an engineer,</p>
<p>that kind of a product manager, you&rsquo;ll find out what are the real expenses you need to bear in</p>
<p>order to build a real lasting business. And you&rsquo;ll be able to sort through all of that stuff out. So</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really good moment. And again, it&rsquo;s yet another indication to me that I think</p>
<p>broadly speaking, the markets are now starting to stabilize, all the irrational behavior is starting</p>
<p>to exit the system, the parties in the last few hours, volumes going down, the alcohol has been</p>
<p>taken away, people are hanging around with a little bit of lights are coming on, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been here a little too long. And I think that that&rsquo;s a very healthy process for an economy.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening right now. So I&rsquo;m constructive, I&rsquo;m a little bullish,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go I&rsquo;ll go out on a limb, I think, you know, we could be three to 5% from the lows,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re more near the lows than the highs. It certainly feels like the double bottoming</p>
<p>out process was the bouncing along the bottom. And yeah, who knows how hard the landing is. But</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great setup for startups and people who want to start companies. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you saw girly did a great interview that trended on the Twitter. And he&rsquo;s just saying this</p>
<p>is the best time to start a company. And I have to agree with him like you&rsquo;re going to have talent</p>
<p>available. And who are you competing against for buying ads like there&rsquo;s so many marketing</p>
<p>opportunities available. The first thing to go in a down market like this is</p>
<p>advertising and marketing. So and by the way, we will we will also relive what we have</p>
<p>empirically known to be true. And it&rsquo;s been it&rsquo;s been pretty well proven. The investments that one</p>
<p>makes in this period will probably be the best for many, many years to come because they&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>the most asymmetric upside. And that was true in 2008, nine and 10. It was true in you know,</p>
<p>2002, three and four. You I mean, you&rsquo;re talking incredible companies just in those two periods.</p>
<p>Think about this Atlassian, Tesla, Uber, Google, Airbnb, Uber, Instagram, WhatsApp,</p>
<p>incredible businesses that have created tremendous value. And so there are businesses</p>
<p>that have been invested in for the first time in 2022, and will be invested in for the first time</p>
<p>in 2023. And 24, which will be the leading winners of this next phase and this next leg up. And so</p>
<p>the real opportunity is to find out who those companies are and get behind them. I think 100%</p>
<p>as I always tell people fortunes are made in the down market, they&rsquo;re collected in the up market.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what are your thoughts here in terms of the startup community or company builder,</p>
<p>and talent, because that seems to be the piece that could be a silver lining on all of this</p>
<p>maelstrom that we&rsquo;re going through,</p>
<p>I mean, technology always marches forward. So there&rsquo;s always, you know, there&rsquo;s always progress</p>
<p>to be to be had and to be made. That&rsquo;s one universal truth about it&rsquo;s weird that we call</p>
<p>it an industry, because a lot of technology companies in Silicon Valley today, don&rsquo;t sell</p>
<p>technology to other companies, which is how Silicon Valley started. Nowadays, Silicon Valley</p>
<p>is reinventing other industries by being technology led. And that is certainly still</p>
<p>true, because there are so many, I hate using the term, but undisrupted industries</p>
<p>to pursue efficiency gains across and technology built in Silicon Valley can can can drive that</p>
<p>now, when I say Silicon Valley, I don&rsquo;t mean the physical location anymore. And that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>confounding factor here, which is that there does seem to be this distribution opportunity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also emerged at the same time, where people are doing remote work and work from home,</p>
<p>and distributed workforce models that seem to be highly effective. You guys talked about it last</p>
<p>year, and I don&rsquo;t think they ever had an office, right? I mean, don&rsquo;t most of the people work from</p>
<p>home there. And I think that the success that&rsquo;s been seen in software companies that have operated</p>
<p>that model also changes the calculus because not only are our wages lower, and therefore the cost</p>
<p>of operating is lower, not needing a fancy expensive office in San Francisco is needed.</p>
<p>But you can also access far more talent than you ever could before. You don&rsquo;t just need people to</p>
<p>live in the Bay Area or New York or LA or wherever you&rsquo;re operating from. So from a software</p>
<p>perspective, this is an amazing time. I&rsquo;ll tell you, there&rsquo;s a flip side to this, like in life</p>
<p>sciences, real estate is more expensive than it&rsquo;s ever been right now in the Bay Area. To get lab</p>
<p>space, there&rsquo;s a total dearth of space. So there&rsquo;s certain segments that I think are</p>
<p>why is ours lab space, like a specific specific designation, you know, I mean, there&rsquo;s a revolution</p>
<p>in genomics, that&rsquo;s totally transforming all of biology and human health. And what I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>you need a certain type of location that&rsquo;s sanctioned for that. Yeah, yeah, lab space</p>
<p>is a certain kind of build out. And it&rsquo;s not, you know, and so there&rsquo;s a certain amount of</p>
<p>square footage, and it&rsquo;s being built out a lot around the Bay Area. But the thing about life</p>
<p>sciences companies is you do have to operate physically, because you&rsquo;re doing some you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>building something physical. And so that is an industry that continues to remain very well funded</p>
<p>and very competitive. And I think, you know, there&rsquo;s still tremendous value. And by the way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of public companies to invest in, not on the primary basis, but that are tools</p>
<p>companies that are benefiting greatly from the continued demand and growth in spending in that</p>
<p>category. sex, let&rsquo;s talk about competition, you know, a lot of talk, you know, of these large</p>
<p>companies pursuing many different verticals, we talked about anti competitive stuff, Lena Khan,</p>
<p>the bundling in the suite of products at Microsoft other firms. Now you have all these being cut</p>
<p>death, death to the room. Death to the room. By the way, did you see that Elizabeth Warren,</p>
<p>of all the things she could send a letter to the FTC about, I guess she sent a letter about the</p>
<p>Roomba. I mean, Senator Karen is just too much, man. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of other stuff going</p>
<p>on, but you can let the room slide. That&rsquo;s not important. Oh, you know, all the things that are</p>
<p>going on right now in 2022. It&rsquo;s the Roomba that gets on the gets that&rsquo;s above the line.</p>
<p>At this point, I mean, my point is sleepwalking. Oh, my gosh, walking. What is going on? There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a fit. There&rsquo;s a famous history of World War One called the sleepwalkers, because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically what it felt like is they just slept walk their way to World War One. Basically,</p>
<p>what should have been a minor regional war, the third Balkans war that nobody should have cared</p>
<p>about. Nobody should have cared about this Franz Ferdinand guy, except for, you know, the Austrians.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. But the whole world basically got themselves invested in this thing.</p>
<p>And it feels and this is what we&rsquo;re worried about. We&rsquo;re worried about the Roomba</p>
<p>when the administration is sleepwalking its way into the next world war.</p>
<p>Well, I do not want Amazon, okay, to control my vacuum cleaner. I&rsquo;m just going to put that</p>
<p>on the record. Okay. Because what happens if they know where the dirt is? They know which</p>
<p>rooms are dirty? What happens if they get ahold of Roomba? I&rsquo;ll tell you what happens. The next</p>
<p>thing is they&rsquo;re going to go after Dyson. Okay. And then once they do that, they&rsquo;re going to put</p>
<p>chips in these things. And all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re going to know exactly what Jason said.</p>
<p>What are you eating? Where your dust bunnies are? Yeah, all of this stuff. It&rsquo;s this must be stopped.</p>
<p>Lena, come now. No, but to the point of competition, you&rsquo;re seeing cuts to, you know,</p>
<p>all the non core projects at these big companies. This is going to be great for startups, right?</p>
<p>Like the idea that Facebook could focus on, you know, a fourth, fifth, sixth thing is going to</p>
<p>go away. Yeah. Well, look, you&rsquo;re right that great companies are built during downturns.</p>
<p>PayPal was built largely during the downturn. The startup I created Yammer was built largely</p>
<p>during a downturn. So listen, there&rsquo;s going to be opportunities innovation doesn&rsquo;t stop just</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re in a recession or depression. But I gotta tell you, I, unlike Chamath, I&rsquo;m having a</p>
<p>hard time finding a silver lining right now. Part of it is the comments that Druckenmiller just made,</p>
<p>which and he&rsquo;s been right about this stuff. We&rsquo;ve been talking about his predictions for over a year</p>
<p>on this podcast, and he famously shorted the pound for George Soros. That was when he was first</p>
<p>getting started. But yeah, since then, he&rsquo;s one of the most successful macro traders in the world</p>
<p>and, you know, universally respected, and I think deservedly so. Remember, he said that this was in</p>
<p>mid 2021. He said that the Fed was engaged in a radical monetary policy, because even though we</p>
<p>were starting to get inflation, it was around 5% then, that they were still engaged in this bond</p>
<p>buying program. They&rsquo;re still bought like 160 billion of bonds. And he is the first one waving</p>
<p>the alarm bell saying, what are they doing? And now his predictions have come true. I mean, we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>an inflationary spiral. And his prediction now is his central outlook is that the Dow Jones will</p>
<p>be in the same place where it is today in 10 years. And he made the point that yes, equity markets do</p>
<p>go up in the long term, but how long term you&rsquo;re talking about from night from roughly 1966 to 1982,</p>
<p>the stock market was sideways, Japan had a lost decade as well. Like this is not unprecedented</p>
<p>after an asset bubble, right. And then from the Great Depression, it took until 1955 for the stock</p>
<p>market to recover. So in the long run, the stock market will go up, but it could be you know, we</p>
<p>could have a flat decade. This is his prediction, right? But he&rsquo;s very smart guy. And then on top</p>
<p>of that, that&rsquo;s not to say that you can&rsquo;t be one of the ones who make money during that period,</p>
<p>because lots of people do. But we&rsquo;re in for I think, a very tough economic period because</p>
<p>of just this radical, expansionary fiscal monetary policy we&rsquo;ve had, basically the Fed</p>
<p>and the administration printed the last two administrations, but especially this one,</p>
<p>printed $10 trillion over the last couple of years. And they had</p>
<p>most of that was under Trump, but continue. No, it&rsquo;s not. 100% I&rsquo;ll pull it up in a second. But</p>
<p>anyway, keep going. We had Biden basically kept digging this hole, we had the $2 trillion of</p>
<p>American rescue plan, which we didn&rsquo;t need. We just had another 2 trillion of the infrastructure</p>
<p>bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, 500 billion for student debt. Yeah, exactly. So Jason,</p>
<p>what are you talking about? And this was all after the emergency was over.</p>
<p>But I think I think that you guys are debating the wrong thing. I think that what Druckenmiller,</p>
<p>I think, by the way, just to be clear, both Druckenmiller and I can be right, which is he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>commenting on the real world economy going into a recession. What I&rsquo;m saying is that the stock</p>
<p>market tends to be nine to 12 months ahead of where we are, Nick, throw up that chart,</p>
<p>please, that I asked you guys to share, just to give you guys a sense of what I mean by this.</p>
<p>By the way, while you&rsquo;re doing that, Jamal, Jason, look, I will agree with you that a lot</p>
<p>of this point, I&rsquo;m just pulling him, he did 7.8 trillion, more than Biden, but fine.</p>
<p>A lot of the stimulus happened under Trump. You&rsquo;re right, because that&rsquo;s when basically COVID</p>
<p>happened. Remember, in the in that q2 of 2020 quarter, the economy shrank at a 30%</p>
<p>annualized rate, everyone thought we&rsquo;re going into a Great Depression. And that&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>passed all the stimulus by huge bipartisan margins. Druckenmiller&rsquo;s best point is that</p>
<p>this is all post vaccine, right? Yeah, so look, and I think we can definitely go back</p>
<p>and second guess what happened during the Trump administration. There&rsquo;s an old saying that</p>
<p>many of the worst ideas are bipartisan. And so, you know, the spending that happened in 2020 was</p>
<p>clearly bipartisan, and maybe it went way too far. But in the last two years, like Druck said,</p>
<p>it was post vaccine post emergency. And they kept spending and it&rsquo;s not just the administration,</p>
<p>it was the bond buying program of the Fed, where the economy was already fully back and they bought</p>
<p>another 160 billion of bonds. Yeah, I think I think the thing is that, you know, I think Stan</p>
<p>is a proven Republican. So maybe he is speaking a little bit of his book as well. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fair to say that both Trump and Biden did not help. But overwhelmingly, I think where the where</p>
<p>the problem stands is a central bank. That was the same through both of those administrations.</p>
<p>And I think we should probably focus on them because you&rsquo;re right, what they did was excessive.</p>
<p>And what they essentially said, is that if there is volatility beyond a certain amount,</p>
<p>and people cry uncle, we will not allow the markets to sort themselves out in an orderly way,</p>
<p>we will step in. And that&rsquo;s what you know, again, what we just talked about the central bank put,</p>
<p>in this case, the Fed interventions, and these interventions really pervert a market because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. And that has huge ramifications in the real economy. So,</p>
<p>Nick, if you just throw up this chart, the the thing that is really important here,</p>
<p>and what this chart shows is essentially all of the hiking cycles that we&rsquo;ve gone through since</p>
<ol start="1983">
<li>So 8387 894 9904 15, and the current one. And here&rsquo;s what I just want to call out for you</li>
</ol>
<p>guys. What&rsquo;s incredible is that other than the one in 83, so this is sort of like, you know,</p>
<p>that last big one. What we&rsquo;ve seen is that the stock market has a tendency</p>
<p>to immediately go to the conclusion very early on in a rate hiking cycle. And now why is that</p>
<p>important for normal folks listening to this thing? Well, the reason why that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>is right now we&rsquo;re in month seven of a cycle, we obviously don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>But the odds are improving every day that we&rsquo;re near the end versus the beginning.</p>
<p>And why that&rsquo;s important is again, if you&rsquo;re thinking about when to, you know, buy equities,</p>
<p>for example, this is a really instructive guide, because what it tells you is the closer we get to</p>
<p>the end. Or more importantly, the closer we psychologically know that the end is coming,</p>
<p>we start buying and that and that&rsquo;s just a broad based statement that has been true. So you know,</p>
<p>what you see right now, I think is really interesting, which is that despite all the</p>
<p>bad information, oh my gosh, the Nord Stream pipeline blew up. Could it have been sabotage?</p>
<p>Was it the CIA? Was it the Russians? Oh my gosh, big tech is slowing spending and firing people.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s in a coup. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that rumor. Yeah.</p>
<p>How about something more benign? You know, the the US, you know, US yuan is really trading in</p>
<p>a crazy way. The US euro is trading in a crazy way. The US pound is going crazy. Despite all of</p>
<p>that. Every time we trade down, the market consolidates very quickly. And we sort of like</p>
<p>so I think we&rsquo;re forming a bottom. I do think that Stan is right, we are going to see a hard</p>
<p>landing recession, something will break in 2023. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t affect a lot</p>
<p>of normal people. But it&rsquo;s likely but at the same time, define hard landing. So I&rsquo;ll tell you in a</p>
<p>second. But at the same time, I think what&rsquo;s happening is in the equity and financial markets,</p>
<p>we are consolidating a bottom because we&rsquo;re seeing through to that end state.</p>
<p>And this is where cheap equity gets bought. So why is there a reason to sell now? I think a lot</p>
<p>of the people that are selling the smart money sellers that I talked to are essentially right</p>
<p>now selling to book in capital losses to offset other capital gains from this year, a term that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called tax loss harvesting. And so if you have gains through this year, which some of us do,</p>
<p>this is the great moment to just sell the losers to book the loss to net it out so that you can</p>
<p>minimize your taxes for next year. That&rsquo;s probably I think where we are at. And I think that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still consolidated buying. So what is the hard landing Jason, if I had to predict,</p>
<p>I think what David said is absolutely right, you&rsquo;re going to see unemployment, get to an</p>
<p>awkward and uncomfortable number. Five 6%, I think could be something that we see.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re going to see a lot more companies pull way back on their spend,</p>
<p>because demand is going to really modulate. Oh, you know, I&rsquo;ll give you a crazy example.</p>
<p>You know, what happens to all the people in the United States that are on arm mortgages,</p>
<p>right, adjustable rate mortgages, when those things reset, they&rsquo;re going to reset to 300</p>
<p>basis points higher, their monthly payments are going are going to go nuclear. It&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>happened. I literally had a family member call me about this. And they were like, what do I do?</p>
<p>So in the UK, yeah, in the UK, 40% of all mortgage dollars are interest only arms</p>
<p>that will reset in January, to around 4% 40%. Can you imagine how upside down the UK economy</p>
<p>is going to be when people have to spend three and four times more to keep and then people have</p>
<p>to go to work. So people who have not been participating are going to have those bills</p>
<p>come in, and they&rsquo;re going to have to go to work, they&rsquo;re going to have to go to work.</p>
<p>Yeah. So free bird, what do you what do you think? hard landing here? And then what do you think 2023</p>
<p>looks like in that regard? It&rsquo;s looking pretty bleak.</p>
<p>Do you buy that we&rsquo;re bottoming out now as Chamath is sort of hypothesizing?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I was running some back of the envelope math.</p>
<p>You know how much debt there is in the world? Take a guess.</p>
<ol start="200">
<li>A couple 100 trillion. 200 trillion, about 300 trillion. Yeah, that&rsquo;s debt</li>
</ol>
<p>owed by governments, businesses, and households. And if in response to the inflation, which is</p>
<p>response to fiscal stimulus, which is a response to the entire economy of the world shutting down</p>
<p>for a couple of months, we end up raising rates from zero to 5%. That&rsquo;s a $15 trillion of annual</p>
<p>debt service, which is like 18% of global GDP. Like that, the debt service alone. But what does</p>
<p>that mean? That means that for every dollar transacted? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,</p>
<p>every dollar transacted. No means nothing. No, it means you have. What does it mean? Like, so? So</p>
<p>what? So I&rsquo;m saying that there&rsquo;s a massive squeeze hat, that&rsquo;s gonna happen, right. And so what ends</p>
<p>up happening ultimately, is because you could run this across local governments. I think it means</p>
<p>demand destruction. I mean, sovereign debt. Households. Yeah. No, no, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you about what it means. I&rsquo;m sorry, but it means nothing. And I&rsquo;ll tell you why these people</p>
<p>you can print more money, you print more money, I&rsquo;m sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But like,</p>
<p>it is not as if we have a law, a constitutional law, or it&rsquo;s not as if governments have</p>
<p>collectively decided that you cannot have debt to GDP above a certain number, that doesn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>guys, we passed 100 under Obama, and we&rsquo;ve just kept printing money. So whether we like it or not,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m a fan of this, or it&rsquo;s right, we are kicking the can down the road.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re extending the maturities, you know, you&rsquo;ll eventually have</p>
<p>hundred year government bonds, okay, just like you have, like now, you know, multi decade long</p>
<p>corporate bonds, we missed a chance for that. We missed it. Because brilliant Yellen actually said</p>
<p>no to that, when when rates were like near zero, and we had the opportunity to refinance the US</p>
<p>government debt, what using long term rates, basically long term bonds. And actually, it was</p>
<p>Trump, who, you know, crazy Trump, who suggested, let&rsquo;s basically shift the debt to 100 year bonds.</p>
<p>And she said, No, so we value the dollar, right? So the problem is that we have all the short term</p>
<p>debt. And look at what just happened in the UK, when Liz trust tried to prop up the bond rates by</p>
<p>basically intervening, she was basically an inflationary policy to fight inflation,</p>
<p>the markets puked all over that. And that&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re the pound hit, you know,</p>
<p>exactly. There&rsquo;s only so you have to have a buyer of the debt, right? I think the list</p>
<p>trusting is really actually a microcosm of how, unfortunately, Western governments are working,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a silver lining, like, she basically came in a day after she got elected</p>
<p>and said, Okay, guess what, guys, at the same time, I&rsquo;m going to massively cut taxes, and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to give you fiscal stimulus, I&rsquo;m going to cap your energy bills, and I&rsquo;m going to have these</p>
<p>huge transfer payments from the government into the hands of British citizens. I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>comment on whether that&rsquo;s right or right, right or wrong. But the financial markets to your point,</p>
<p>David absolutely hated it. And within a few days, you basically saw the pound get crushed.</p>
<p>But then what did you see? You saw the Bank of England decide that financial stability was more</p>
<p>important than financial viability, meaning the things that she wanted to do were not viable.</p>
<p>So you could have let the financial markets sort this out, which would have forced the Prime</p>
<p>Minister to basically abandon the policy. But instead, the BOE said, Now, we&rsquo;re an unlimited</p>
<p>buyer of UK guilt, which is the name of the UK bond. And everything snapped back, we&rsquo;re back to</p>
<p>where we were before her speech and before the Chancellor of the exchequer speech. And so it&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>if nothing happened. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so insane to me, which is that even though the Bank of</p>
<p>England, by the way, in the next week or two, we&rsquo;re going to raise rates 140 basis points,</p>
<p>140 basis points, almost double what the Fed has done the last three times.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing both at the same time, they&rsquo;re both raising rates, and they&rsquo;re acting as a backstop for</p>
<p>bad policy. And this is what&rsquo;s wrong right now in the world, we do not have a real check and balance.</p>
<p>So my point to Friedberg is just that I&rsquo;m like emotionally on your side. But the problem is,</p>
<p>with these folks keep getting bailed out, David, they&rsquo;re just going to keep doing this stuff. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no end in sight. Well, the the consumer doesn&rsquo;t get bailed out. So that if you look at</p>
<p>it on a micro basis, instead of a macro basis, you&rsquo;re correct, these governments will just bail</p>
<p>people out, even if they make bad decisions, as we&rsquo;re seeing. But then the person who&rsquo;s variable</p>
<p>interest mortgage just kicked in has $500 less a month in savings. So they&rsquo;re now not going to buy</p>
<p>an iPhone 14, they&rsquo;re not going to upgrade their car every six years, they&rsquo;re going to do it every</p>
<p>eight years. So the demand destruction that&rsquo;s happening is going to be quite severe. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to reduce money, then monetary velocity. And then we restart mark my words, the Federal</p>
<p>Reserve will intervene. This is why I think we&rsquo;re in a bottoming process. I think the the bleeding</p>
<p>edge of the smart financial actors are actually on Saksa side and Friedberg side. But then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking that next intellectual leap and saying, Okay, well, what happens when Apple basically</p>
<p>says, Hey, guys, I&rsquo;m gonna have to fire 15% of my employees. I think what happens is the Fed</p>
<p>intervenes. And I&rsquo;m just using Apple as an example. But there is a threshold of demand</p>
<p>destruction, Jason, I think you&rsquo;re right, where we have the Fed put come back on the table,</p>
<p>and the markets just go bonkers. So they instead of doing 75 basis points, two or three times,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just gonna be like, 50. We&rsquo;ll slow it down. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna they&rsquo;re gonna get to four and a half very quickly. And then this something&rsquo;s gonna break,</p>
<p>like all these guys are saying, I think they&rsquo;re right. And then the Fed put comes back on the</p>
<p>table. And we&rsquo;ll have this, we&rsquo;ll have the UK, you know, the UK thing happened in what six days.</p>
<p>Ours will play out over six or nine months. But it&rsquo;s going to play out the exact same way.</p>
<p>And Friedberg&rsquo;s right, you know, we should have capped debt at, you know, 100% of GDP or less.</p>
<p>And Saksa is right, we should have issued 100 year bonds and zero rates when we had the chance.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t do either. So incompetent sex. I mean, there was no need to have rates this low for that</p>
<p>long. And maybe they could just keep them at some average number, instead of going down to zero,</p>
<p>or that spiking back up and just steering, you know, spitting the steering wheel, you know,</p>
<p>so violently, why don&rsquo;t we have some basic concept of maybe not having zero rates and keeping them at</p>
<p>2% or something reasonable. So you have some dry powder?</p>
<p>Well, if you go back and listen to what the Fed said, and drug makes this point,</p>
<p>they were all worried that they got there was an inflation print a few years ago,</p>
<p>where it was at 1.7%. And they all started panicking about not being at 2%. So for a</p>
<p>0.3% move that they tried to engineer, they opened the floodgates. Okay, and that&rsquo;s basically what</p>
<p>happened. And that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s so critical of it. The other thing is the Fed, remember the Fed said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be data driven. But then the data came in last summer, we got that surprise 5.1%</p>
<p>print, and they dismissed it as transitory. So they said they&rsquo;re going to be data driven,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t they they were dismissive. Now, on what basis did they conclude transitory? Like,</p>
<p>what was the proof for that? There was no proof. That was a political consideration.</p>
<p>The administration and me and Yellen is big part of that immediately reacted to basically downplay</p>
<p>the news. I mean, they PR did I mean, they didn&rsquo;t want to admit there was a problem.</p>
<p>They went from transitory to this is permanent to now six months, but during and now we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>hard landing. Like, right, these people are not competent. Are they just not competent? No,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re really I think they are competent. But I think that they&rsquo;re a little bit fighting</p>
<p>with one hand tied behind their back. I think if you had to take the other side sacks, you know,</p>
<p>the problem is they have a very specific strain of data that they focus on. And that data has all</p>
<p>these weird anomalies to it. Like, you know, they should look at rent data. But the way that the</p>
<p>rent data works is that, you know, you bleed it in one sixth a month over six months, just as an</p>
<p>odd example, or like use car data only comes in a certain way. So I think they&rsquo;re driving in the</p>
<p>rearview mirror. I think there is something to that. I think it&rsquo;s simpler than this, which is</p>
<p>listen, I think all politicians do this, which is when they get bad news, they want to spin it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to delay acknowledging the bad news as long as possible. So what happened last</p>
<p>summer, when this inflation started, they all dismissed it, it was all a talking point. I mean,</p>
<p>every single one of them. And here&rsquo;s the crazy thing is J. Powell, he&rsquo;s the only Trump official</p>
<p>who got reappointed by Biden by a huge majority. How do you think that happened? And when did it</p>
<p>happen? It happened at the end of May last summer. So just when this inflation print came out,</p>
<p>and Yellen and the administration were saying it was transitory, that&rsquo;s when Powell was up for</p>
<p>renomination. And he swept through the only Trump appointment to basically be renominated</p>
<p>without even a question by Biden. Why? Because he got on board the talking points. He wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to basically buck them at that time. So he waited six months, he bought into the talking</p>
<p>points. That was 100% political. I told you, I read Paul, it&rsquo;s a very compelling argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really compelling. It&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s sad, but compelling.</p>
<p>Sachs, you should read the Paul Volcker book Keeping At It. He basically says Reagan</p>
<p>came to him off site where they knew they weren&rsquo;t recorded and told them do not raise rates. So this</p>
<p>idea that the Fed is independent, like history now has shown us it is not like the there is</p>
<p>massive political pressure on them. I think especially at the time driving in the review</p>
<p>mirror, clearly, the data they have is not great. And then all this data is nuanced. You know,</p>
<p>jobs and this massive amount of jobs we&rsquo;ve had in this country is because of you, we have a new</p>
<p>immigration policy, we don&rsquo;t let people into this country, we kick out PhDs that we trained.</p>
<p>And then housing, we have I buyers buying this. So to your point, Jamal, I think a lot of the data</p>
<p>has changed. And they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;ve got a bad data set, they have a bad dashboard, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>driving with bad information. They don&rsquo;t know their direction. They don&rsquo;t know their speed.</p>
<p>Perfect. If you went more fidelity on the data, you&rsquo;re right. If you went to a board of directors</p>
<p>meeting for your company and said, How&rsquo;s the business doing? And the CEO says, Well, you know,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re going to have data from six months ago. And it&rsquo;s like, Okay, I got that. But what</p>
<p>about like last week, you would fire that CEO to your point, Jason. And these things are knowable</p>
<p>today. Like there are businesses, for example, that are selling billions of dollars worth of</p>
<p>like IoT sensors here and there energy sensors here, everything is connected to the internet,</p>
<p>everything is automated, everything is running in code, you would think that the government would</p>
<p>say there&rsquo;s a national level directive here, to get this into some kind of a system that we can</p>
<p>use, because these decisions are becoming more and more important. I think that would be a wonderful</p>
<p>idea and a project and what had huge value. A Manhattan project for understanding the economy</p>
<p>on a very granular level, we you invested in a startup at one point, I remember I heard the pitch</p>
<p>where they had people around the world taking pictures of food prices, Africa, India, the United</p>
<p>States anywhere, and then putting them into a database normalizing them. So you could know the</p>
<p>price of tomatoes or potatoes on a global basis, you know, and normalizing all that data, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem to have this data there. They&rsquo;re talking about August data. And it&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>in October. It&rsquo;s a really odd situation. I think, you know, our friend, backers are made this point,</p>
<p>which was that, look, in this last FOMC meeting, the Fed raised their forecast for what the neutral</p>
<p>interest rate would be from three and a half to 4.6%. So in two months, they raised their forecast</p>
<p>by over 100 basis points. What is that based on? Like, is there a model? I assume there is a model,</p>
<p>I assume there&rsquo;s data. So why don&rsquo;t they just open source that? Why don&rsquo;t they let the markets,</p>
<p>like see the model they&rsquo;re using. So we have a little more predictability. Of course,</p>
<p>they always have the discretion to bucket or not follow it or whatever, or change it.</p>
<p>But like, you know, wouldn&rsquo;t that be a better approach is to like, let us see the data and</p>
<p>the models in real time as it&rsquo;s happening. And then the community, like like an open source</p>
<p>project could actually, like fork the model and actually create like better ones.</p>
<p>Well, to your point, to your point, like there&rsquo;s the the Fed is actually known as the gold standard</p>
<p>of transparency. So the IMF has kind of like a view and how all these central banks act last week,</p>
<p>they actually excoriated and this is good. This is hurts me to say Canada, because of their lack</p>
<p>of transparency. Apparently, Canada doesn&rsquo;t even put out minutes. And so they were like,</p>
<p>hey, Canada, you, you guys like, yeah, and you know, Canadians are I mean, the Canadian government,</p>
<p>at least like total moral virtue signalers, but they don&rsquo;t value transparency, apparently.</p>
<p>But to your point, David, there is a lot of opacity in these things that really determine</p>
<p>how the real world works and the impacts to individual people are going to go and get</p>
<p>ratcheted way up. And nobody really knows what to expect, even though the data is there,</p>
<p>sitting in plain sight. I think two things can be true. I think</p>
<p>the Fed, the process of setting central bank rates by the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>should be reset. I also think that it could be true that the Fed is not responsible</p>
<p>fully for a lot of the conditions we&rsquo;re now facing. We did have a bunch of policy decisions</p>
<p>that the whole world got swept up in and seemed to accept as appropriate at the time when we</p>
<p>shut the global economy down. And there was some weird assumption or belief that fiscal policy</p>
<p>would allow us to soft land or recover out of that. And at the end of the day, all that fiscal</p>
<p>policy did, and I remember I was speaking with a smart person at the time, and he said,</p>
<p>all the Fed&rsquo;s going to do is they&rsquo;re just going to inflate everything. And it&rsquo;s going to take a</p>
<p>while and everything will inflate. And that way, everyone will feel good for a while.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t just stop the spigot of capital moving, goods moving and services moving</p>
<p>for months on end, and assume that the repercussions will not actually be felt extremely</p>
<p>harshly. And at some point, things are going to come home to roost. And that is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>There was no winning solution for the Fed, or for any central banker. In light of the policy</p>
<p>decisions that were made to shut the global economy down, when COVID began, not to argue</p>
<p>whether or not that was appropriate, but that was simply a statement of fact. I said it before.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t understand if you were to take a first principles point of view on this today and say,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s create a central bank and how should it operate, you would take all the data from</p>
<p>Intuit, from PayPal, from Visa, from MasterCard from the internet, you would take all of that</p>
<p>data, you would let the algorithms or the AI or the software figure out what is most predictive</p>
<p>of certain inflationary recessionary, totally, and growth indicators, totally. And you would</p>
<p>basically say, look, x percent growth, x percent inflation, solve for what the central bank&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interest rate should be. And it should vary at 100% of a percent or a basis point every day.</p>
<p>And every day, the rate is reset, and the software resets it. And to have, you know,</p>
<p>some degree of human logic or oversight seems appropriate. But to have a decision made in</p>
<p>quarter percent increments, once every couple of weeks, seems seems kind of arcane. So I think both</p>
<p>things are true. The Fed isn&rsquo;t necessarily fully responsible, we all want to point fingers,</p>
<p>you know, we can point fingers at the, the mania that swept over the entire world, when we started</p>
<p>our podcast, and everyone was like, what the hell is going on? Why are we locking down the world?</p>
<p>And this is nuts. And it felt nuts. And the response may or may not have been appropriate.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, there was a cost and the cost is going to be born for very likely a</p>
<p>decade or more if we are able to get through it all. A lost decade is a possibility.</p>
<p>And central banks would be rewritten. So yeah,</p>
<p>well, I think there&rsquo;s actually two original sins of the economic crisis we&rsquo;re in. One is lockdowns.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. Like that was a fiasco. It didn&rsquo;t do anything to stop COVID. It was an economic</p>
<p>disaster. And then we overreacted to lockdowns by then printing all of this money, both fiscally and</p>
<p>through expansionist monetary policy. So Freeberg is right about that. But I think the other original</p>
<p>sin here is the the QE and the ZERP, right, the zero interest rate policy that began in 2008,</p>
<p>2009, we broke the glass in case of emergency. And then it just became standard, like it was</p>
<p>on autopilot. Why did we keep printing? Why did the government keep buying?</p>
<p>It was a long tail event that became the meme.</p>
<p>The problem is that every time government is a bad idea. I mean, it&rsquo;s just yeah, Milton</p>
<p>Friedman once said there&rsquo;s nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government program.</p>
<p>How many times have we seen this? Every time the government supposed to do something on a one off</p>
<p>emergency basis, like ZERP, it ends up becoming institutionalized. We still have kids in schools</p>
<p>in California wearing masks. I mean, that it&rsquo;s the same crazy thing that people cannot get off</p>
<p>these programs. The thing about ZERP, which if you look back, what really happened, if you think</p>
<p>about like how people live their lives every day, what what what has happened in our view of</p>
<p>government and politicians, it&rsquo;s really eroded since 2007 2008, right? There&rsquo;s huge amounts of</p>
<p>rancor, nobody gets along, everything tends to happen on partisan lines. And the reason I think</p>
<p>that that was allowed to happen or that accelerated is actually because of ZERP. Because if you think</p>
<p>about it, if you had failed policy, right, and the economy was completely broken, politicians would</p>
<p>actually have to get together and try to solve the problem themselves. And the last time they</p>
<p>really did that was actually in the great financial crisis. If you look at TARP, and if you look at</p>
<p>how all of these smart people actually had to get together in a bipartisan way to figure out how do</p>
<p>we bail out America and prevent a banking crisis, that was the last real effort that touched a lot</p>
<p>of people. But then David, as you said, at the on the heels of that, we broke the glass. And we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been fighting ever since. And the peak of that fighting was basically Donald Trump getting</p>
<p>elected. And so I think like what it shows is that if you have these irrational central bankers,</p>
<p>that will are that are willing to constantly bail people out, you will never get a high</p>
<p>functioning government because policy is irrelevant. Good policy doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I think policy doesn&rsquo;t matter if any of it goes wrong. The central banker will come in and bail</p>
<p>us out. Well, and the second and third order impact of these is can become quite acute. And</p>
<p>just for people who heard the word surf, like three times zero interest rate policy, basically</p>
<p>keeping interest rates very low, very dangerous to do, because you get shit like this, like,</p>
<p>look at the number of unemployed people per job opening. And if you just look at this,</p>
<p>like ratio, this is the number of jobs per unemployed person, it gets way out of whack.</p>
<p>And then if you look at this other chart, just in terms of the total number of job openings,</p>
<p>you know, we started we talked about this earlier in the pod, hitting 11 million to burn that office</p>
<p>crazy, then what happens if you have too many jobs, you don&rsquo;t let immigration you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a functioning immigration policy? Well, then you get this great, you know, people quitting their</p>
<p>jobs, quiet quitting, and then the boomers saw their net worth go up so high because of their</p>
<p>retirement accounts because of the stock market boom. And because of the housing boom, you had</p>
<p>all these rich parents now who are bailing out their kids who refuse to go to work and labor</p>
<p>participation goes from 70% down to 62%. These are the unintended consequences of Zerp that,</p>
<p>you know, now, how do you get a generation to go back to work? If their parents have, you know,</p>
<p>a $2 million home, and 3 million in stocks or a million dollar home, you have to break the economy.</p>
<p>Yeah. And that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;re gonna break this we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re gonna get Google and</p>
<p>Apple who have unlimited cash to do a riff. Those companies don&rsquo;t need to do a riff. They&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it because they have no choice now. Because they want to break the economy so hard boomers have</p>
<p>71 trillion in assets over March. I mean, the wealth transfer that&rsquo;s going to occur between</p>
<p>these two generations is crazy. Why would any us extra millennial with a boomer parent even go to</p>
<p>work if they&rsquo;ve got a million US boomers have $71 trillion in assets? Is that what you said?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s the number I have here. So an entire turn of global GDP</p>
<p>in savings. That&rsquo;s about one seventh of the world&rsquo;s total assets. It&rsquo;s just a lot of locked</p>
<p>up well. And this monetary policy was done by boomers 70 trillion controlled by 76.4 million</p>
<p>people. Yeah. So if you want to really talk about the, you know, the rich, in a global context,</p>
<p>the rich are very specifically us boomers. Yeah, that&rsquo;s one seventh of the world&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>seventh of the world&rsquo;s assets. It&rsquo;s controlled by 76 million people.</p>
<p>How much of it is their homes?</p>
<p>I mean, they were they were at Woodstock, they you know, they live the best life in the best times</p>
<p>they enjoyed the most of the peace dividend in the 80s in the 90s in the 2000s. They are the</p>
<p>ones that control everything. It&rsquo;s pretty crazy. It&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s less like Jeff Bezos and Gates</p>
<p>and Musk. It&rsquo;s boomers that if you want to go and really zoom out and get it right, it is boomers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1% of the global population that controls one seventh of the global wealth.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all in the US boomers hiding in plain sight, us boomers. There you are.</p>
<p>Well, once these housing prices decline in the stock market declines, that number is going to</p>
<p>shift. And that really is what&rsquo;s fundamentally happening with the fiscal policy and the effects</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s happening today. It&rsquo;s having today, which is a redistribution of that value, because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically deflating all those assets. Now we&rsquo;re deflating the average boomer assets, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to deflate real estate assets. I mean, if you just do the math on that back of the envelope,</p>
<p>these boomers are worth a billion $1 million each. Like, think about that. Like every boomer</p>
<p>is worth 900k a million something in that range. 1.2 million. I mean, it&rsquo;s bonkers. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>average. That&rsquo;s how much wealth they have. bonkers. You you two are a boomer. Jk. No, we&rsquo;re jacks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re Gen X. We had the worst we had the we had like we got really shafted. It&rsquo;s like we you know,</p>
<p>we grew up with flannel. We we have a channel and it&rsquo;s Morissette Alanis Morissette. Hold on.</p>
<p>Smashing pumpkins. I mean, 93 was probably the best year.</p>
<p>Smashing pumpkins ever did it for me. Billy Corgan&rsquo;s voice was always like,</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great. Really annoying rage against the machine. Can we do a quick shout out for</p>
<p>coolio? Sad to hear that he passed. We&rsquo;re here for you. Yeah, I mean, it was really sad. The guy</p>
<p>was how old was he? 50? Were you a big fan of coolios? I love his coolio story from the pod</p>
<p>when he said gangsters paradise. I feel you. Yeah. And then when I saw him at Saks his birthday last</p>
<p>year, I was like, dude, I love coolio. I mean, I cannot tell you what a big fan I am. What was</p>
<p>the line you said to him? You said I feel you. I said I appreciate you and appreciate you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I appreciate you. We fly down for the birthday. You know, they shuttle you on the</p>
<p>cars from the plane to the to the house. We get to the house. And you know, we&rsquo;re all waiting.</p>
<p>Of course, Saks is late two and a half hours to his own party. We&rsquo;re all hanging out starving.</p>
<p>But then we go into the party. And then they have like coolio shows up. So we&rsquo;re like sitting down</p>
<p>to dinner for course to all of a sudden pop comes out of the woodwork coolio I lose my shit.</p>
<p>I run up on the coolio fan. The dance floor. I grew up coolio like it&rsquo;s like high school</p>
<p>jams, man. I mean, that&rsquo;s like in the car cruising. And at this point, I&rsquo;m like seven</p>
<p>tequila watermelon tequilas in so I&rsquo;m like, Oh, my gosh. I&rsquo;m on the dance floor, you know,</p>
<p>jamming out to coolio. I think coolio thought I was Saks, you know, because he&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, Oh, two South African Jews. You guys all look the same. Coolio comes up starts</p>
<p>high fiving me and hugging me. And I&rsquo;m like, What&rsquo;s up, coolio? Oh, my God, this is like a</p>
<p>dream come true. He&rsquo;s like hugging me. His face is right next to my face. I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>And I like I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;ve had a little bit of tequila and I whisper in coolio&rsquo;s ear. I&rsquo;m like, Oh,</p>
<p>no, I appreciate I appreciate you. I didn&rsquo;t. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I think I saw Friberg throw his panties on stage too.</p>
<p>You are such a nerd. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I mean, what do you say?</p>
<p>Well, clearly, you don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>Yeah, my team, my team and TPB, they had a cameo made for me that coolio sent in.</p>
<p>It was super heartfelt and awesome. Saks posted it on the internet, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, I retweeted it.</p>
<p>Yeah, retweeted it. And it was I don&rsquo;t know, man, it was he was he was actually a super nice guy.</p>
<p>Great guy. And it was super sad.</p>
<p>Yo Dave, it&rsquo;s your friendly neighborhood coolio, bro.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out here on the golf course thinking about you.</p>
<p>I appreciate you, man. So I want to wish you a very, very, very happy birthday, man.</p>
<p>You feel me? I want you to drink good. I want you to smoke good.</p>
<p>I want you to eat good. I want you to have some fun, bro.</p>
<p>Go big, do it right.</p>
<p>Yo Dave, happy birthday, man, from coolio.</p>
<p>Shaka zoom, man.</p>
<p>Well, all the stories are coming out now and not your experience was not unique.</p>
<p>He touched everybody he met. Literally, he&rsquo;s college kids were like genuine, very kind, like</p>
<p>yeah, he was a real super friendly and like, you know, and and like wanted to ask about you.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like a very like, I could have been a politician if he didn&rsquo;t become a</p>
<p>music music superstar. And I guess he looked incredible.</p>
<p>He looked like he was 25. I mean, he literally went to these college kids met him.</p>
<p>He went to their like, you know, frat house. He cooked them dinner.</p>
<p>And then he got a guitar out with them. And he sang Gangster Paradise with them.</p>
<p>And he like orchestrated it with the crowd singing or whatever.</p>
<p>He was accessible. Then there was a video of him in Dublin on the bar singing.</p>
<p>Can I just say something to I&rsquo;ve given the message?</p>
<p>Before? Yeah.</p>
<p>Before, but like, you know,</p>
<p>take care of your health, you know,</p>
<p>take care of like, there, there, there are these incredible drugs, I just want to call out</p>
<p>health as well.</p>
<p>If Lipitor, for example, or Crestor, or these statins are not working for you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this next generation kind of drug called the PCSK9 inhibitor, which essentially is</p>
<p>effectively a gene therapy that&rsquo;s modeled after this very specific group of folks in the Nordics,</p>
<p>I believe, who actually have effectively immunity against heart disease.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s taken 20 years to refine this drug. But this drug is a wonder drug. And you know,</p>
<p>there are versions of it now that are injectable, you know, once every six months or whatever.</p>
<p>So go and ask your doctor if you&rsquo;re not if statins don&rsquo;t work for you look at the PCSK9</p>
<p>inhibitor. And then separately, after you&rsquo;re 45 or so, you should get a CT angiogram.</p>
<p>Because these things are really important, or you know, a heart flow,</p>
<p>where they actually inject a dye, they characterize all your veins, they give you a calcium score</p>
<p>may not prevent this, but at least if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s something cardiac related,</p>
<p>you can get to the bottom of it. And it&rsquo;s a knowable thing nowadays.</p>
<p>Yeah, rest in power to our friend. And yeah, take care of yourselves, your health.</p>
<p>And speaking of health, shout out to Gwyneth Paltrow, GPAL, who, in her goop newsletter</p>
<p>pointed out that she loves the all in pod, and has to be honest, she&rsquo;s obsessed with</p>
<p>the personalities a little bit. Anybody want to handicap that?</p>
<p>Listen, let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>If you want to live in health after a meal, the best thing to eat is a little dark chocolate.</p>
<p>Do you get your dark chocolate from goop? Do you have goop dark chocolate?</p>
<p>Jason, I was trying to make a story where I am the dark chocolate where I&rsquo;m saying that</p>
<p>I am her favorite personality, you fucking moron.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re handicapping that you&rsquo;re her favorite. She said she&rsquo;s obsessed with</p>
<p>plural. I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna where does she rank her besties? I need to know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna rank as Friedberg.</p>
<p>Oh, really? You think that makes that sound? Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Then me, then you. Okay, I&rsquo;ll take it. The fact that</p>
<p>Gwyneth Paltrow even understands like who we are is a win in my book. So I&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be number four on her list. But GPAL, if you could rank the besties in your next newsletter,</p>
<p>that would be appreciated. And we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll take your besties.</p>
<p>GPAL. All right, Sachs, you want some red meat? You I saw you wrote a piece. You want your red</p>
<p>meat? Should we throw it to you? Yeah, yeah. All right. Well, I mean, I think we we need a</p>
<p>Ukraine update because I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about all the reasons that there could be a</p>
<p>silver lining or the markets bottomed out. I don&rsquo;t think you can know for sure the markets</p>
<p>are going to bottom out unless you know that there&rsquo;s going to be a successful resolution of</p>
<p>this Ukraine war, at least a non escalation of it. And all the things that have happened in the last</p>
<p>couple weeks have been on the road towards escalation. Exactly. So in the last like just</p>
<p>few days, you&rsquo;ve had Zelensky saying that they want to be admitted to NATO. You&rsquo;ve got Putin</p>
<p>basically annexing or saying he&rsquo;s going to annex the Donbass. And somebody we don&rsquo;t know who but</p>
<p>according to Radek Sikorsky, who&rsquo;s the Polish foreign minister, he think the US somebody blew</p>
<p>up the Nord pipeline. So what is the common denominator? They say was blown up? Was it one</p>
<p>or two was this? I think it&rsquo;s Nord one. So it&rsquo;s the one that was actually like working. What is</p>
<p>the common denominator of all these things? They&rsquo;re all eliminating key elements of what a peace deal</p>
<p>would look like. So everyone understands that a peace deal would require Zelensky to give up on</p>
<p>NATO, it would require Putin to make some compromises, likely in the Donbass. And it would</p>
<p>require the sanctions to be lifted and the energy flows to be turned back on. Well, so now those</p>
<p>things basically have been removed from the table, or at least potentially, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see how you&rsquo;re going to get a peace deal now. And so if you remove all the off ramps,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s left escalation? Well, to me, this thing&rsquo;s just going to keep escalating.</p>
<p>I thought you wrote a good piece in the American conservative should America go all in on Ukraine,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t read it, it is 80% of rehash of what we&rsquo;ve talked about here for the last year.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s 20% new in it, I think. And I thought what was interesting, in terms of new stuff you</p>
<p>put in the piece, and it&rsquo;s a good summary of, you know, poker strategy versus what&rsquo;s going on here,</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve already proven, you know, if you did want to prove that Russia is not a threat,</p>
<p>with the exception of their nuclear, we now have proven that they&rsquo;re really not going to be able to</p>
<p>do a domino and go into all these different countries, with the exception of obviously,</p>
<p>the threat of nuclear power. So I thought that that was a point. Yeah, what I was really</p>
<p>responding to in that piece is the assertion by the media that Putin is bluffing. How do they</p>
<p>know that? You know, how do they know that, like, you know, I think all of us understand poker</p>
<p>pretty well. And none of us ever would have the confidence to assert that we know exactly what</p>
<p>cards our opponent holds in any given hand, and how exactly they&rsquo;ll play them. What do we do? What</p>
<p>do smart players do? We put our opponent on a range, a range of possible hands of possibilities.</p>
<p>And then we evaluate, what did their previous actions tell us? What story are they telling</p>
<p>through their previous actions? Well, what story has Putin been telling? This is not</p>
<p>a guy who bluffs, in my opinion, or at least that is not the story.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s a chance he would pop off a tactical new, it&rsquo;s a nonzero chance.</p>
<p>I think if that if his life is on the line, he is incentivized to use every weapon at his disposal</p>
<p>to try and prevent his violent life isn&rsquo;t on the line here, he can he can back out. Yeah,</p>
<p>but where&rsquo;s this thing headed? If there&rsquo;s no compromise?</p>
<p>I think they you know, I&rsquo;m going to stick with my original prediction that we wanted to</p>
<p>ankle Putin, we wanted to prove he didn&rsquo;t have, you know, as much strength as he did. And we</p>
<p>wanted to exhaust his resources. So we could finally basically get him out of office at</p>
<p>some point. So I do think regime change via exhausting him. And I think it seems to have</p>
<p>worked. We have exhausted. You&rsquo;re agreeing with me. I agree that we have exhausted his I mean,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s proven he can&rsquo;t fight a ground war, right? I mean, that that&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s escalating. Now. He&rsquo;s escalating. You think he&rsquo;s gonna roll over? He&rsquo;s not gonna roll</p>
<p>over. I think he but I think what we&rsquo;ve proven haven&rsquo;t we is that he can&rsquo;t fight a ground war</p>
<p>effectively. He doesn&rsquo;t have the army. He doesn&rsquo;t have the weapons compared to the West. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been exhausted, you know, and I think his he&rsquo;s spent now. The only thing he has left is what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about is the nuclear option, literally, no, no, well, no, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more intermediate options. First of all, he&rsquo;s just called for the, the mobilization of 300,000</p>
<p>more troops. So that&rsquo;s step one. People are leaving the country. Yeah, exactly. Look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be very high costs on the Russian side. Yeah, they&rsquo;re gonna be very high costs on</p>
<p>the Russian side. I would not assume that means that there&rsquo;s something in it for us.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is, even with this, you know, the the conscription he&rsquo;s doing this draft,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing forced draft. I mean, he is kind of redundant. But this conscription or draft,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it, has proven that he doesn&rsquo;t even actually have the standing inside his</p>
<p>own country. People are leaving, they&rsquo;re breaking, they&rsquo;re looking about to break their arms. Like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s pretty dark. I think you&rsquo;re making a lot of assumptions there, just like the media</p>
<p>who are saying that he is definitely bluffing. What I&rsquo;m saying is, we cannot know that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely bluffing. Now, the United States of America is blessed with being the most safe and</p>
<p>secure country in the world, and really in human history. And the history is full of humans</p>
<p>constantly being at war with each other. So that is a really valuable thing that we have. Why are</p>
<p>we so secure? We&rsquo;re surrounded by gigantic oceans. We have these gigantic moats. In addition, thanks</p>
<p>to the wisdom of the Monroe Doctrine, for 200 years, we have prevented any great powers from</p>
<p>getting a foothold in the Western Hemisphere. We are completely dominant here. And no one could</p>
<p>ever stage an invasion of the United States. We only have one vulnerability, just one ICBMs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really it. So what are we doing? We&rsquo;re basically engaging in a proxy war with the person</p>
<p>in the world who has the most ICBMs. And we are basically putting ourselves on an escalatory path</p>
<p>with him. This would be like if Achilles had gone in front of the walls of Troy and basically taken</p>
<p>off his armor and stuck his foot in the air and drawn a little bullseye around his, his heel.</p>
<p>That is what we&rsquo;re doing. Why in the world? Why would we do that? Why would we do that?</p>
<p>If they are the last real threat, and they are the Achilles heel, if we can,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not the last threat. They&rsquo;re not the last threat. We&rsquo;re never going to be out of threats.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, we got two major ones with ICBMs. But anyway, it looks like we&rsquo;re in the endgame. Now,</p>
<p>what do you think happens here? We&rsquo;re not in the endgame. We&rsquo;re on a path towards escalation,</p>
<p>because all the off ramps have been removed. That&rsquo;s my point. And instead of saying instead</p>
<p>of trying to find a diplomatic solution, first of all, we keep removing off ramps, and then we</p>
<p>blithely disregard the threat to ourselves by saying he must be bluffing. This is incredibly</p>
<p>stupid. The better question to ask is, hold on a second. The better question to ask is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in it for us? What&rsquo;s in it for the United States of America? What is the vital interest</p>
<p>that compels us to risk our security? There isn&rsquo;t one. This Donbass region, hold on,</p>
<p>this Donbass region is the Franz Ferdinand of this situation. It is not historically</p>
<p>important to us. We have invested in it all of this importance. And we are potentially</p>
<p>turning a regional war into a world war. We are sleepwalking towards this. Unless somebody finds</p>
<p>an off ramp, we are escalating our way into a much larger conflict. That is my point.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see how anyone I don&rsquo;t see anyone should reenter the markets with this geopolitical</p>
<p>risk hanging over our heads. Yeah, this is kind of like what I said a few weeks ago. And JP Morgan</p>
<p>put out an analyst report today saying that they were shifting from being, you know, call it roughly</p>
<p>positive, sort of like Chamath&rsquo;s point earlier about being a little bit constructive in the</p>
<p>markets right now and coming in and finding opportunities to buy to realizing that the sum</p>
<p>of the portfolio of tail risks right now, you know, outweighs the upside that may arise from</p>
<p>finding these low priced opportunities in the market. And that seems to be the prevailing</p>
<p>market sentiment right now, is that there are too many of these moments that while each one of them</p>
<p>is low probability, the impact is of such high severity that the aggregate value, expected value</p>
<p>or expected loss of all of them is actually quite significant. And that is heavily weighing on the</p>
<p>market. And so to Chamath&rsquo;s point, I think and to the question earlier about market conditions,</p>
<p>one catalyst for upside in the market while there is fiscal strain and economic strain and growth</p>
<p>strain, there is also this geopolitical strain in the market. If one or more of these things starts</p>
<p>to resolve, I think that weight starts to come off the markets. And you can see Oh, yeah, look,</p>
<p>I can see the market taken off like a rocket if Ukraine gets resolved. And I do think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right. It&rsquo;s all fat tail risk. That&rsquo;s about to get resolved. I think that can potentially be</p>
<p>the political motivation here, which is that enough people like Chamath and you start making</p>
<p>the calls to your representatives pointing out how strained the market is because of this tension.</p>
<p>In the region right now, that maybe there is some path to resolution that becomes more active</p>
<p>rather than passive. Because this may be a little controversial, so we can talk about it. But I</p>
<p>think that the markets would have reacted much, much more negatively to a nuclear incident three</p>
<p>months ago, than now, and may not even react as much as we may think it would three months from</p>
<p>now. What do you mean by nuclear incident? You mean a nuke goes off or just a threat?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying if Putin blows up a nuke, the markets may not react that much.</p>
<p>I think that the markets are basically ring fencing Russia, Ukraine risk in terms of</p>
<p>currency instability, but that&rsquo;s sort of now gone away. We&rsquo;ve ring fenced the energy risk,</p>
<p>because it looks like energy reserves in Europe are actually going to be pretty meaningful,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to spend whatever it takes. So all of the second and third order effects,</p>
<p>it would be a humanitarian crisis, which would be horrendous, okay. But the markets don&rsquo;t whether</p>
<p>we like it or not react to humanitarian crises, they react to the second and third order economic</p>
<p>impacts of those things. And if you actually try to think about what the second and third order</p>
<p>economic impacts are, you&rsquo;re seeing many of those things get solved. And so what it would be,</p>
<p>it would be a highly isolating effect, it would be a humanitarian atrocity, he would be completely</p>
<p>cornered from a from a worldwide perspective. The monetary and fiscal implications of that</p>
<p>may not be as meaningfully disruptive today as they would have been three months ago. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m saying. Well, one thing I should clarify, I like freebirds analysis of the fat tail risk,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s likely that this conflict goes nuclear, but I don&rsquo;t need there</p>
<p>to be a high likelihood in order for me to be very concerned about it because of how disastrous</p>
<p>an outcome that would be. So if you&rsquo;re doing an expected value analysis, it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to analyze the expected value or negative value of a of a low probability disastrous event,</p>
<p>right? That&rsquo;s the classic fat tail risk. I do think that if the markets think they have</p>
<p>priced in the effect of this war, then I think that&rsquo;s an argument for a lot of downside to this</p>
<p>market. Because it seems to me that we&rsquo;re on a one way ratchet here, all the off ramps for a piece,</p>
<p>or a diplomatic solution have been systematically taken away. And all that&rsquo;s left are potential</p>
<p>escalations. So no, I hear you. But how did those translate those escalations to outside of those</p>
<p>two countries and into economic terms for the rest of the world? Oh, my gosh. Well, I mean,</p>
<p>if the war spreads here, I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of scenarios. I mean, well, here&rsquo;s one, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just assuming that China&rsquo;s going to stay out of it. Imagine if you&rsquo;re China, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching what&rsquo;s happening, and you&rsquo;re worried that actually, Russia could lose this war so badly,</p>
<p>that it emboldens hawks in America who want to target China next, you know, who are basically</p>
<p>on this global struggle against autocracy, you&rsquo;re going to look at that and go, wait a second,</p>
<p>is it really in our interests for Putin and Russia to be completely toppled by this global</p>
<p>struggle against autocracy? It seems to me they could enter the Russian side, not militarily,</p>
<p>but in terms of support. So they would have an incentive, again, not to lose an ally. And then</p>
<p>by the same token, I think the Russians could lash out, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to go nuclear</p>
<p>right away. But I think they could pull a Grozny. I mean, don&rsquo;t you think that</p>
<p>well, when, you know, in the Chechen War, when Russia was losing, they just rubbled Grozny,</p>
<p>I mean, they basically leveled to the ground. So I mean, Putin hasn&rsquo;t done anything like that yet.</p>
<p>But if he&rsquo;s facing defeat, isn&rsquo;t that something that would be on the escalatory ladder is to</p>
<p>basically start leveling Ukrainian cities, destroy key infrastructure, all that. And then what is</p>
<p>the response to the West? Yeah, I know, I know. West may say, you know what, that&rsquo;s unacceptable</p>
<p>to I agree. No, no, I look, I&rsquo;m not debating how bad all of these things are. I&rsquo;m just asking the</p>
<p>question, what are the second and third order economic impacts, because the market doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>reflect human atrocities, we may want it to, but it just doesn&rsquo;t do a good job of that it does do</p>
<p>a reasonable job of reflecting a discounted set of events in the future related to economic events</p>
<p>and impacts. And all I&rsquo;m saying is that, you know, the most obvious impacts of this war have</p>
<p>been to currencies to commodities and to energy. And the world has had six or seven months to</p>
<p>reroute what they&rsquo;ve needed to roughly solve a large percentage of those problems. It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take the fact that this is a bad war, and it should end. I&rsquo;m not saying any of it.</p>
<p>Right, right. No, look, you make you make a good point, which is that look, the market discounts</p>
<p>cash flow. So how did the cash flows get impacted? You may be right that valuation multiples have</p>
<p>gotten close to correction. But I think the thing that we don&rsquo;t really know is what earnings and</p>
<p>profits and revenues are going to look like next year. And part of that is about the hard landing,</p>
<p>right? Like how inflated are all these companies revenues and earnings because of what I hear you,</p>
<p>I hear you. But this is why that chart is so important. Every other time,</p>
<p>except in 1983, in modern history, so the modern history that we have all lived,</p>
<p>says that the stock market bottoms in the first third of a process. And so if you think that this</p>
<p>process ends in 24, that&rsquo;s a roughly 24 month process, 21 month process, we&rsquo;re in month seven,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the power rally of what would map to the last six or seven patterns of behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I guess you may end up being right about this prediction. I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>that I personally would not want to enter the market until some of these fat tail risks are</p>
<p>taken off the table. Yeah, well, talking about nibbling in the market for a second. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying they&rsquo;re likely. I&rsquo;m just saying that. Yeah, I understand. Obviously, none of us want</p>
<p>this to happen. I&rsquo;m just asking a very specific question, which is and making an observation,</p>
<p>which is, I wonder how the markets would react. And I, I don&rsquo;t see it being down 1000 points.</p>
<p>And that may be wrong. But by the way, it&rsquo;s really shocking to see that. Yeah,</p>
<p>the diversity of views that you guys all share, I think, really represents the market.</p>
<p>There is no you do you have you to you have a view?</p>
<p>Dude, I like what the fuck?</p>
<p>But what is your view? Your is your view that we&rsquo;re okay, we&rsquo;re about to just go through the</p>
<p>toilet? Like, what is your view? From an equity markets point of view? Oh, just in general? Yeah,</p>
<p>like to equity markets, your temperature? How do you feel? Like, how do you feel?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m worried about money not moving. What does it mean? Money not moving? I&rsquo;m really anxious</p>
<p>about invested dollars, everyone seems. I think I mentioned a while ago that dollars were kind of</p>
<p>locked up in March. And then I went to this conference. And people were like, yeah, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>loosening up and making a plan again in July, because the market was kind of turning back up.</p>
<p>And now equity markets are turning down, bond markets have turned down, interest rates have</p>
<p>spiked. And there&rsquo;s a bunch of these currency problems. So I&rsquo;m very nervous about the flow of</p>
<p>capital, which I remember happening in a weight. And I remember happening when we were all joking</p>
<p>over text, when COVID happened. And we&rsquo;re like, hey, the market can only go down 10% a day for</p>
<p>so many days in a row. And everyone was kind of like, you know, Chamath was talking about wearing</p>
<p>jeans instead of he&rsquo;s like, I could just wear the same pair of jeans for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true demand destruction. When he started, you said that you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going out the jeans from like, he was at Mayfield. Yeah. Yeah. He&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>fancy clothes. I can just wear the same clothes. I have storage locker to pull those clothes out.</p>
<p>Right. That was that was the old for Chamath and Laura Piana on sale. Rent the rent.</p>
<p>You know, the CEO, the CEO of Laura Piana did send me a note after that podcast. He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>is everything okay? The rate of GDP crash? I will tell you guys, the biggest indicator of</p>
<p>economic health is the rate of rotation of Chamath&rsquo;s closet. Because that is big. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, you know what, I can take this season off. I&rsquo;ll just wear last summer&rsquo;s season. That&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>I would guess that the rate of rotation of Chamath&rsquo;s closet is probably predictive of IPO</p>
<p>market. No, I&rsquo;m you know what, I was I was there last week rotating in I&rsquo;m rotating in so maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing. The economy is about to rebound. I&rsquo;m ready to take some companies public.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;m buying I&rsquo;m buying stocks because I was at Chamath last week, and it was supposed</p>
<p>to be black truffles. And then he jumped the fence. All of a sudden white truffles over my</p>
<p>shoulder. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I was like, Chef, Chef, Chef. Chef, Chef, Chef. All</p>
<p>right, listen for the dictator. The Prince of panic attacks the Sultan of science, the Queen of</p>
<p>keen. Why himself see the Kevin Hart show if you&rsquo;re in San Francisco or San Jose.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hilarious. And for Montclair, Ambassador, David Sachs, the dictator himself.</p>
<p>I am the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator and we&rsquo;ll see you on Episode 99. Love you guys. Love you guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in. We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride. Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>And instead, we open sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you. I&rsquo;m the Queen of keen. Why? I&rsquo;m going all in. Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What? You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>What? You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
