    <p>Hey, everybody. Welcome back to the all in podcast. Besties have reunited. It&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a bestie summer. Chamath, how are you doing? You&rsquo;re back in America. Yes, I&rsquo;m back in America.</p>
<p>Back in America. It feels great. Good summer. Yes. I had an incredible summer. I had seven</p>
<p>weeks in Italy. It was really incredible. What is the vibe in Italy post pandemic? Obviously,</p>
<p>they had the roughest of any nation, I think, except for China and Wuhan with COVID-19.</p>
<p>No, it was incredible because they&rsquo;re so resilient. They basically decided that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t ever want to go through it again. Everybody wore a mask and people socially</p>
<p>distanced. There&rsquo;s lots of dinners outside. No restaurants were really seating people indoors.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d walk into a store and you&rsquo;d have to put some Purell on your hands and wear a mask. There</p>
<p>was 40, 50 cases a day. Then I keep looking at the news when I was there, 60,000 a day here. It</p>
<p>was just really sad. Then on top of that, to see the riots, the fires. It&rsquo;s been a disturbing summer</p>
<p>here. How are you doing, David Sachs? You&rsquo;re back in San Francisco. You got to spend a little bit</p>
<p>of time in an undisclosed location, as we know from the last couple episodes of the podcast.</p>
<p>How is San Francisco right now? How has your bestie summer been?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great. I guess I can now disclose that my undisclosed location was Mexico,</p>
<p>specifically Cabo. That was a great place to be for a couple of months.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert, nobody cares.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. Actually, it was a great place to be in the early stage of the pandemic because</p>
<p>everyone was wearing masks. They did take it really seriously. There were very few cases and</p>
<p>seemed like it was under control, at least in the area I was. Then we came back to San Francisco for</p>
<p>school, for the kids&rsquo; school, which I&rsquo;m not sure we have to be here, but that&rsquo;s where we came back.</p>
<p>Is the kids&rsquo; school actually open? Are they going to school or they keep pushing it out</p>
<p>two weeks like my kids are? Yeah, they&rsquo;re not going in person yet,</p>
<p>but I think they keep trying to figure out when they&rsquo;re going to be able to start doing that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all Zoom-based right now. Yeah, which means no learning, right?</p>
<p>I mean, do you think these kids are actually learning on Zoom or do you think it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>glorified babysitting? A little bit. I mean, a little bit. I think it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, we gave up on it. And Friedberg, are you there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here, Bay Area.</p>
<p>How has your bestie summer been during this crazy time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the Bay Area. I&rsquo;ve been crossing all seven layers of Dante&rsquo;s Inferno here in California,</p>
<p>moving from the outer layer of COVID to the middle layer of California&rsquo;s proposed wealth tax,</p>
<p>to the inner layers of extreme heat, smoke, and the absolute central layer of pain.</p>
<p>More recently, my three-year-old daughter decided 34 nights ago to not sleep anymore.</p>
<p>So yeah, we&rsquo;ve been living the life. It&rsquo;s been glorious.</p>
<p>And I wear a mask now for COVID and then I wear another mask on top of that mask for the smoke.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just living the California dream. What my parents immigrated here for, you know, paradise.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that&rsquo;s a good place to start. And just if anybody cares, I spent 10 days in Malibu</p>
<p>and had a great time. I guess nobody cares.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, how my bestie summer was, but we forgot.</p>
<p>Jason, how&rsquo;s your bestie summer? J. Cal, how&rsquo;s your bestie summer?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been lonely and I tweeted, I&rsquo;m lonely.</p>
<p>And I got about 50 phone calls from people who are like, I can&rsquo;t imagine J. Cal being sad,</p>
<p>but I actually had a talk with my wife and I said, what are the symptoms of depression?</p>
<p>Because I think I might have depression and I went through it and I was like, I don&rsquo;t have depression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I have great empathy for all the people suffering.</p>
<p>And, you know, I just being isolated, you guys know me very well, better than anybody.</p>
<p>Like I like to talk to people and it&rsquo;s been really difficult for me to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be totally candid to be isolated like this.</p>
<p>And the podcast is great and doing this podcast is great, but man, I miss people.</p>
<p>I just miss people.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of your depression? Just before you were self-diagnosing, I&rsquo;m just curious.</p>
<p>I was feeling like, um, just sad about watching the riots and watch people shoot each other.</p>
<p>And then watching, you know, the, the, the wildfires, watching people die unnecessarily,</p>
<p>and then watching the madness for the election.</p>
<p>It was just all becoming like, I wouldn&rsquo;t say overwhelming, but it just made me very sad that,</p>
<p>you know, so many people can&rsquo;t go back to work and then the stock market&rsquo;s ripping.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very, I don&rsquo;t know how you guys feel, but it feels very surreal, right?</p>
<p>Because in our world, and I don&rsquo;t know how your portfolios and investments are doing,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of the companies we&rsquo;ve invested in as angel investors,</p>
<p>um, are doing just wonderfully and we&rsquo;re investing more than ever.</p>
<p>But then you turn on the television and it&rsquo;s like the doom scrolling is crazy.</p>
<p>So I had to just stop doom scrolling.</p>
<p>I think that was the key thing Chamath was just looking at Twitter is that the trending topics</p>
<p>is so depressing and just so overwhelming at times that I took three days off this weekend</p>
<p>and went camping and I literally didn&rsquo;t pull up Twitter and I felt much better.</p>
<p>So I think it was really Twitter related, like just opening up the trending topics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you did that on your holiday in Italy, but it really is a quick way to get depressed.</p>
<p>The best thing is that I was using it in a different time zone.</p>
<p>And so I was basically out of the flow and it makes a huge difference because then you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in the emotional turmoil of people&rsquo;s immediate reaction.</p>
<p>And so you can just kind of move on.</p>
<p>And then also I just had a really fun summer because I really tried to detach and not use my phone.</p>
<p>I had, you know, I kept my meetings to a few hours a day and then otherwise I was doing things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want to know, you want to know my phone call to J-Cal?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey J-Cal, I saw on Twitter that you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re sad and lonely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, are you suicidal?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>Okay, goodbye.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too much of a narcissist to ever consider that.</p>
<p>But I do want to thank you, David, for having me down to Cabo and we got to have some good</p>
<p>times.</p>
<p>We watched some good movies.</p>
<p>Gladiator, Extended Cut was great.</p>
<p>Some other movies that we watched could get us canceled.</p>
<p>So we won&rsquo;t admit that we watched History of the World or any other Mel Brooks movies,</p>
<p>but we had a good time, played a couple of rounds of golf and that was good times.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about California because I think, you know, we&rsquo;re all residents currently</p>
<p>of California, but let me just put it out there.</p>
<p>How many people on the call are considering leaving California?</p>
<p>Anybody, is that going through anybody&rsquo;s mind right now?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s going through mine.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not for me, but I think that California is sort of emblematic of what could happen</p>
<p>if you actually have, you know, the legislative bodies plus, you know, the top sort of political</p>
<p>leader up and down on one ticket.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, you basically have like massive rife incompetence and it&rsquo;s been compounded.</p>
<p>You never ‚Äì I mean, you know, if people who are Democrats would have said, oh, the</p>
<p>best thing that can happen for Democrats is if you have, you know, local cities plus an</p>
<p>assembly plus the state senate plus the governor as a Democrat.</p>
<p>Republicans would have said the same thing for Republicans.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, it basically creates the worst outcomes.</p>
<p>And so instead, what you need is a little diversity of ideas and a little push and pull.</p>
<p>But California is like a bunch of clowns in a clown car right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to move.</p>
<p>Now, part of why I&rsquo;m not going to move is I ‚Äì you know, my taxes I&rsquo;ve set up in such a way</p>
<p>where California can&rsquo;t get access to most of my assets anyway.</p>
<p>So, you know, they can pound cent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>David, Saxe, how are you feeling about California right now and just the craziness in San Francisco,</p>
<p>the homelessness problem in San Francisco has become acute during this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really ‚Äì</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a disaster.</p>
<p>And then the wealth task on top of it and ‚Äì</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disaster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disaster.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not leaving or anything.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly a topic of conversation that&rsquo;s come up a lot.</p>
<p>And I do know people who have left.</p>
<p>I know a couple of people who ‚Äì you know, prominent people in</p>
<p>the venture community who&rsquo;ve recently moved to Austin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a horrible time for the city and state to be proposing all these new taxes.</p>
<p>Just take one example, because people are already realizing that because of COVID and</p>
<p>this new sort of work from home and Zoom business culture where you can kind of work from anywhere,</p>
<p>that people are realizing they don&rsquo;t need to be in San Francisco or in Silicon Valley anymore to be</p>
<p>in the technology industry.</p>
<p>And so, at precisely the time that people were re-evaluating where they wanted to be,</p>
<p>realizing that they could be anywhere, California is now, you know,</p>
<p>proposing to massively increase the cost of being here.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s horrible timing.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you do have this sort of seemingly chronic issue in San Francisco,</p>
<p>particularly with the sort of homeless problem.</p>
<p>It just seems to keep getting worse.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s sort of this weird hostility to technology and tech workers here that I think</p>
<p>has somehow used as a scapegoat to prevent the city from dealing with its real problems.</p>
<p>And what do you perceive those real problems to be in the city?</p>
<p>I mean, you used the term homeless.</p>
<p>I think most people looking at the problem, as one person candidly told me, you know,</p>
<p>what we have is not, and I won&rsquo;t say who said this, but it&rsquo;s a prominent person.</p>
<p>They said this, you know, Jason, the issue here is this isn&rsquo;t a homeless problem.</p>
<p>This is a junkie problem.</p>
<p>And they use specifics that I&rsquo;m using that term because that&rsquo;s the term to refer to people who</p>
<p>are addicted to opioids, methamphetamine, fentanyl.</p>
<p>And that if you were to actually unpack what we&rsquo;re calling a homeless crisis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a crisis of drug addiction, and specifically fentanyl.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw, we&rsquo;re going to hit something like 500 overdose deaths this</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like going to double last year, and it&rsquo;s all fentanyl, which is a particularly,</p>
<p>you know, deadly drug.</p>
<p>So, I mean, how much do you think that is the problem, David?</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re right that homelessness is not the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>That homelessness is the consequence of long-term drug addiction and mental illness.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the, it&rsquo;s the end state.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, the city is, it&rsquo;s not really tackling the underlying issues.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s kind of aiding and abetting them.</p>
<p>I mean, how many millions of needles does the city give away every year, and then it</p>
<p>only collects a small fraction of them with the remainder ending up on the streets?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s bonkers.</p>
<p>And I think part of the problem is that we keep saying that until we, is that we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>demand any improvement in the situation in terms of homeless people.</p>
<p>You know, we have this like poop squad in San Francisco that&rsquo;s literally cleaning poop</p>
<p>off the sidewalks because homeless people are using our sidewalks as like a latrine,</p>
<p>basically, as a bathroom.</p>
<p>And what you keep hearing is that, well, we can&rsquo;t do anything about that problem until</p>
<p>we solve the homeless problem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and certainly we should try to solve that problem, but it&rsquo;s a very long-term,</p>
<p>you know, difficult, intractable problem.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we can certainly do things like demand that homeless people not do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the policing seem to, there seems to be a distinct issue with policing right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>I watched the San Francisco Tenderloin Twitter account, David Freeburg, and they&rsquo;ve arrested</p>
<p>something like 260 meth and fentanyl dealers.</p>
<p>But we have a DA, Chessa, I believe his name is, who doesn&rsquo;t believe in prosecuting any</p>
<p>of those crimes related to drugs or petty crime.</p>
<p>Freeburg, what has the city turned into for you as somebody who&rsquo;s been a long-term investor</p>
<p>in the Bay Area?</p>
<p>Well, I moved here after I graduated college in 2001, and I loved San Francisco.</p>
<p>It was a quieter city and a quainter city.</p>
<p>I honestly, over the years have found the traffic and the congestion and the buildup</p>
<p>of the city to be frustrating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit of a anomaly in this sense, because I think a lot of people, you know,</p>
<p>think that the city should continue to grow and progress and build housing and so on.</p>
<p>Those are all, you know, fine objectives.</p>
<p>But I think the quality of life has degraded for some time in the city as infrastructure</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t kept up with the changing pace of companies growing here.</p>
<p>And as a result, we&rsquo;ve kind of got this ballooning, inflating budget that&rsquo;s been poorly managed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got, I forgot the statistic, but there&rsquo;s some number of thousand people plus that are</p>
<p>city government employees in San Francisco earning over $300,000 a year.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a chronic kind of bureaucratic issue that is the cancer that has caused,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of the follow-on crises that I think we&rsquo;re now experiencing acutely here</p>
<p>in the city.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of leaving to your earlier question, you know, I was really like, I&rsquo;ve just been</p>
<p>like everyone, you know, like I kind of talk about the Dante Inferno layers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also like, for me growing up, it&rsquo;s like a seven-layer burrito.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one layer of shit after another.</p>
<p>Start with the beans and in the middle, you got the sour cream.</p>
<p>And, you know, this city has just gotten kind of, and the state has gotten more and more</p>
<p>difficult to live in.</p>
<p>And I was certainly thinking and talking to my wife, like, we got to leave, her family&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here, so we&rsquo;re not going to leave the state.</p>
<p>But then I did a call last week that I think 18 of us were on with Governor Newsom.</p>
<p>And, you know, he made a couple of really interesting points that really did honestly</p>
<p>reset my perspective.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve tried to take a step back and think a little bit more broadly about the</p>
<p>long-term opportunity in California.</p>
<p>The way the state operates right now, it&rsquo;s the fifth largest economy in the world.</p>
<p>They ran a surplus.</p>
<p>They refinanced their debt.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done a great job kind of managing kind of the fiscal gap that&rsquo;s being created</p>
<p>by the COVID crisis.</p>
<p>And, you know, Governor Newsom made a point, like, we have had the California exodus story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s percolated and cycled really for decades.</p>
<p>He pointed out an article, which I&rsquo;ve not been able to find, but I&rsquo;ve been looking for</p>
<p>it from Time Magazine from 1959 that were like declared, this is the year everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to exodus out of the state.</p>
<p>And we hear it every couple of years, there&rsquo;s some crisis that precipitates the mass exodus.</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t happened because it is a great place to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a diversified industrial base.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just tech.</p>
<p>Tech is a lot of the growth, but there&rsquo;s a lot of industry here, largest ag producer,</p>
<p>largest military aerospace industry, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great diversified economy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great diversified cultural base.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by the oceans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by the mountains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible place to live and work.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think any of us want to give that up.</p>
<p>And the media has done a great job kind of magnifying these small stories that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really a story.</p>
<p>Governor Newsom made the case that this wealth tax proposal was one assembly member.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t even get into committee.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even really being considered, but it kind of created this press flourish and</p>
<p>everyone got involved and everyone I know kind of freaked out about it.</p>
<p>And it became this kind of another catalyzing event, but it wasn&rsquo;t really real.</p>
<p>So if we kind of broaden our perspective a little bit, both in terms of space and time,</p>
<p>I think we get a little more kind of comfortable with like of all the places to live and all</p>
<p>the places to work.</p>
<p>This is the best.</p>
<p>And you can go save some taxes and move to Austin, but I mean, then you got to go live</p>
<p>in Austin, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that it&rsquo;s the best in terms of climate, geography, natural beauty resources</p>
<p>and the industries that have developed here and have strong network effects.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the best politically.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s among the worst politically, and it seems like the politicians are doing</p>
<p>everything they can to mess it up.</p>
<p>I mean, I almost wonder if there&rsquo;s like a resource curse issue, particularly with San</p>
<p>Francisco, where, you know, there&rsquo;s this observable thing with governments that sometimes you</p>
<p>get a resource curse where if there&rsquo;s like a lot of oil in the country or something,</p>
<p>you end up with a government that&rsquo;s not very good because people just spend all their time</p>
<p>going to war to try and capture it.</p>
<p>And I kind of wonder if, you know, San Francisco has been the beneficiary of being proximate</p>
<p>to Silicon Valley, this enormous like wealth creation, prosperity, job creation ecosystem</p>
<p>that it had nothing to do with creating.</p>
<p>I would say two things to build on what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>The first is I think that when the economies in an environment are really, really good,</p>
<p>all the really, really smart people want to go into those economies.</p>
<p>And that leaves generally dumber people to do things like politics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s less true in places that have shittier economies.</p>
<p>Yeah, fascinating.</p>
<p>And I actually think that that&rsquo;s practically true.</p>
<p>We may not want to think it, and it may sound a little harsh, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And, you know, the way that you reverse it is what Singapore does, which is you make</p>
<p>the civil servants the highest paid people in the economy, right?</p>
<p>And you treat them like knowledge workers, and you say, wow, look, I&rsquo;m going to pay</p>
<p>this person $250,000, $300,000 a year.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re shocked at the quality of the person you get.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first comment I want to make.</p>
<p>The second one, though, is that unlike all these other times where I think people have</p>
<p>been, you know, sort of prognosticating the doom and gloom of California, the thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different now is that because it is such a dominant political environment for the Democrats,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much easier to judge if they actually know what they&rsquo;re doing and if they are going</p>
<p>to do things that are aligned with the sort of, like, the moral code of the party that</p>
<p>elected them.</p>
<p>And so, like, let&rsquo;s just talk, for example, about the fact that we are not going to have</p>
<p>police reform of any kind in California, which is where you&rsquo;d think would be the first state</p>
<p>where people got their act together and said, OK, if we really believe that we need to reform</p>
<p>police, we can do it in our own backyards, but that legislation is going to get blocked</p>
<p>because Californians have decided that they care more about the alignment to police unions</p>
<p>than they do to the right of law and to social justice for minorities and blacks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>We should be the most progressive, is your point on this, Chamath.</p>
<p>And the point is, to say it explicitly, is the politicians are in the pocket of the unions.</p>
<p>And because they&rsquo;re in the pocket of the police unions and the education unions,</p>
<p>we cannot make forward progress, even though we&rsquo;re supposed to be the most liberal of all</p>
<p>locations, correct?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in summary.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>We actually, if we believe that we have, you know, up and down the ticket, the ability</p>
<p>to implement justice, right, at least justice in the vein of the Democratic Party and what</p>
<p>that platform represents, or, for example, all of the people that were out protesting,</p>
<p>OK, during Black Lives Matter, during that entire movement, I suspect the overwhelming</p>
<p>majority are Democrats slash progressives, or, you know, let&rsquo;s just say the majority,</p>
<p>or at a minimum, the plurality, OK?</p>
<p>But then the idea that then you have a state, the most populous and the richest,</p>
<p>filled up and down the ticket with people who are theoretically aligned with those political values,</p>
<p>but then when push comes to shove and the legislation hits the floor, it basically</p>
<p>gets mothballed, to me is inexcusable and disgusting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the housing issue.</p>
<p>We just had a bill that was an incredibly simple bill.</p>
<p>I think it was 11, yeah, SB 1120.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you followed this one, but I&rsquo;ve been following it on the Twitter.</p>
<p>And it was a very simple piece of legislation.</p>
<p>Any single family home lot could have a duplex on it.</p>
<p>So you could have two homes on a single lot.</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t even pass that in a city where, you know, a firefighter, a teacher,</p>
<p>et cetera, cannot live within 90 minutes of where they work.</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t even pass that.</p>
<p>Well, also, there&rsquo;s also AB5, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Jason has Uber&rsquo;s third or fourth investor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you have something to say about that, right?</p>
<p>Well, they tell me third or fourth, but I think third or fourth.</p>
<p>But here we go to the VC Braggs controversy.</p>
<p>Yeah, can we just pin down exactly which one it is?</p>
<p>So you could just say you&rsquo;re the fourth investor or something like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much better to say third or fourth.</p>
<p>And that was a mistake, obviously.</p>
<p>You know, AB5 is another one.</p>
<p>Look at all the careers in which you can be, David Sachs, a freelancer.</p>
<p>And the more money you make, the more you get to dictate your schedule.</p>
<p>But if you are poor, and if you are in an entry-level job,</p>
<p>the California government will not let you, even though 70% of drivers for these services</p>
<p>want to be freelancers.</p>
<p>And the services themselves said they will put into a fund for healthcare.</p>
<p>Like they literally Uber, you know, Dara&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re going to put money into this, Lyft is going to put money into it.</p>
<p>They still will not let people decide for themselves what shift they want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>I mean, and you see-</p>
<p>It trickled into like journalists too.</p>
<p>I mean, they said now journalists, if you write 30 articles a year for a single outlet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re technically considered an employee, even though you&rsquo;re writing the articles on</p>
<p>your own time, with your own research, and you&rsquo;re getting paid for good articles that</p>
<p>are accepted.</p>
<p>And then there was this follow-on controversy about translators.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, translators takes five minutes to translate an article.</p>
<p>So why would 30 articles apply to a translator?</p>
<p>And obviously when you have that degree of confusion and complexity, something&rsquo;s off,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just such a-</p>
<p>It feels like virtue signaling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I think, well, I mean, the reason why AB5 happened is it was at the behest of the</p>
<p>Teamsters, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to unionize the Uber and Lyft drivers, and they can&rsquo;t do it unless they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>employees.</p>
<p>And so the author of the bill, Lorena Gonzalez, who&rsquo;s sort of in their back pocket, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why she put forward the bill.</p>
<p>And then the absurdity of it was that they realized after introducing it, that it would</p>
<p>ensnare all these other occupations, like the writers and journalists and photographers</p>
<p>and translators.</p>
<p>Real estate brokers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even people like manicurists and so on.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so what they&rsquo;ve been doing is they&rsquo;ve been now modifying the legislation to exclude</p>
<p>all of these categories.</p>
<p>And in the process, they&rsquo;re kind of laying bare what&rsquo;s really happening here, which is</p>
<p>this is all about either basically shutting down or forcing Uber and Lyft to comply with</p>
<p>the will of the Teamsters.</p>
<p>And it seems like the legislation blinked when Uber and Lyft said, well, we&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>shut the service down.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on when that happens, Sax?</p>
<p>What do you think will happen?</p>
<p>Who will win this AB5 showdown?</p>
<p>Well, Uber and Lyft, yeah, they threatened to basically stop service and they got a stay,</p>
<p>I think, from a judge.</p>
<p>So AB5 doesn&rsquo;t go into effect until November when, and there&rsquo;s a ballot initiative that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sponsoring to get AB5 overturned.</p>
<p>So I think, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s hard to predict whether it&rsquo;s going to win or not, but that</p>
<p>to me is like, if AB5 were defeated by a ballot initiative in November, that&rsquo;d be a really</p>
<p>positive sign for the state of California.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say there was, on this call with Governor Newsom last week, he did point out that AB5</p>
<p>was more of kind of a law of inevitability as a result of that whole Dynamex state Supreme</p>
<p>Court decision where the Supreme Court basically said, look, here&rsquo;s the criteria that defines</p>
<p>an employee versus an independent contractor.</p>
<p>They get to decide what work they do or what hours or whatever.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like some set of criteria.</p>
<p>And they said, look, Uber drivers and all these other kind of technically independent</p>
<p>contractors don&rsquo;t meet those criteria fully.</p>
<p>Therefore, they are employees.</p>
<p>And as a result, California Assembly tried to and had to effectively codify what it means</p>
<p>to be an employee versus an independent contractor.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not arguing for the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying what was conveyed by the governor last week on why this ended up coming</p>
<p>to bear.</p>
<p>Now, if they strike it down, there&rsquo;s going to be some other law that&rsquo;s going to pop up</p>
<p>because of the state Supreme ‚Äì the Dynamex decision.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of ‚Äì something&rsquo;s going to have to get written down.</p>
<p>So, Saxe, don&rsquo;t you think it ultimately ends up just being some sort of negotiated</p>
<p>point between all of these industry leaders and the state to kind of figure out, okay,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s everyone going to compromise on to get something written down that&rsquo;s law?</p>
<p>I mean, possibly.</p>
<p>I mean, Dynamex is not like constitutional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a constitutional decision.</p>
<p>So the legislature can do whatever it wants here.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And so if you were going to respond to Dynamex, you don&rsquo;t have to kind of enshrine it.</p>
<p>So ‚Äì and I guess there was certainly some question whether Dynamex would apply to Uber</p>
<p>and Lyft in this way.</p>
<p>You know, they could have made their arguments in front of a court, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Look, the problem is now and whatever applies to California applies to every state legislature.</p>
<p>How are these people supposed to figure this out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but like, you know, who are we entrusting here to go and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>understand the nuances of Lyft and Uber and really understand the job that they do versus</p>
<p>the translators versus the this person versus the that person versus the Dynamex decision?</p>
<p>Again, I think 20 years ago, I kind of would have believed that politicians were generally</p>
<p>some of the smartest people, you know, frankly, amongst us.</p>
<p>And it really did attract a certain level of intellectual person who cared about legislating.</p>
<p>But, you know, now, basically, you just have like, you know, Jerry Falwell Jr.&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>around.</p>
<p>I mean, these are ‚Äì they&rsquo;re all just running around until they get caught on Instagram</p>
<p>and get fired.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re just ‚Äì they&rsquo;re not the smartest people that we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>And so what was Gavin Newsom&rsquo;s answer to that is really what I would ‚Äì</p>
<p>You know, the Jerry Falwell Jr. point didn&rsquo;t come up, Chamath, but</p>
<p>we can follow up.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It does seem to me that if they do become full-time, this would be a tragedy for the</p>
<p>people who are trying to just do 10 to 20 to 30 hours of gig work.</p>
<p>Like what happens to those poor people who wanted to fill in between when they dropped</p>
<p>their kids off of school and pick them up and just grab a couple hours here or there</p>
<p>as a second gig?</p>
<p>Like if this actually does pass in their full-time ‚Äì</p>
<p>Honestly, guys.</p>
<p>Honestly, you guys are such ‚Äì you&rsquo;re honestly ‚Äì look, it won&rsquo;t affect them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll affect the long-term profitability in the margins of the companies that have</p>
<p>to hire them as full-time employees and they&rsquo;ll have to like, you know, make a bunch of rules</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But it has huge operational implications and it has really terrible OPEX implications</p>
<p>for a company.</p>
<p>But for the person that wants to work 10 hours, Jason, they&rsquo;ll still be able to work 10</p>
<p>hours.</p>
<p>So I think the point is that like ‚Äì</p>
<p>On a specific shift.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re going to have to come in at a certain shift time.</p>
<p>I think the point is like the entire public markets who all of a sudden think that a business</p>
<p>looks one way has to figure out that it&rsquo;s really a cost plus business.</p>
<p>And what it really means is if you were comfortable with a 60% or 70% reduction in the market</p>
<p>cap of some of these companies, you&rsquo;d be okay with AB5.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where the tension is, where the people that made the law don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care about the market cap because they don&rsquo;t own the stock anyways.</p>
<p>And the people that are reacting to AB5 are the ones that own the stock and are really</p>
<p>thinking about the market cap.</p>
<p>Well, but the drivers don&rsquo;t necessarily own the stock and they&rsquo;re against it.</p>
<p>No, the drivers own eight shares, David.</p>
<p>I mean, come on.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying is they&rsquo;re not shareholders for the most part.</p>
<p>But this really does reduce their flexibility to contract for their labor.</p>
<p>No, but I think what you&rsquo;re saying will happen, which is that they will create</p>
<p>a AB5 prime, which is a modification that&rsquo;s neither this nor what it was, but it seems</p>
<p>that the tailwinds are pretty clear, which is that we&rsquo;re moving to a place where these</p>
<p>companies have to get built in a very clever way.</p>
<p>And even if they are super clever in capturing consumer demand, the unit economics are going</p>
<p>to be pretty shitty.</p>
<p>And I just think we have to own that.</p>
<p>And probably what it means more than anything else is it&rsquo;s not a real venture kind of business.</p>
<p>And so you may be deficit financing it or building it in a very different way than we</p>
<p>used to.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying is, I think that this law will have very adverse consequences for their</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, I grant you that.</p>
<p>But why is the state interfering in the relationship between Uber and its drivers in this</p>
<p>way when everyone&rsquo;s happy with it?</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I think what actually is happening is the state is effectively capturing the excess</p>
<p>return of Uber and Lyft.</p>
<p>Meaning, I think if you just take a pure, unemotional economic view at this, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>any other market.</p>
<p>If there is a huge amount of margin available and there are not many competitors, what happens</p>
<p>is somebody comes in to take the excess margin.</p>
<p>And you think that&rsquo;s the government that wants to take it and the unions want to take it?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Should we let them then dictate what hours people work?</p>
<p>The thought exercise that I would ask, guys, if there was, in a market, 90 different</p>
<p>competitors for transportation, would AB5 have been written, passed, adopted?</p>
<p>And my answer to you would be that it would not have been.</p>
<p>So Uber and Lyft&rsquo;s and DoorDash&rsquo;s success is what leads to people wanting to get a cut</p>
<p>and get a slice.</p>
<p>The oligopolist model of success where not enough other companies are pulled through.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Well, that gives us a good segue into‚Äî</p>
<p>By the way, sorry, last point on this.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is the people who created the problem are the ones that hate it the</p>
<p>most, which are the investors.</p>
<p>Because they pile in the incremental dollars into the winners, trying to king make a winner</p>
<p>through capital.</p>
<p>And now what&rsquo;s happening is their rate of returns are basically getting taken away.</p>
<p>And I think that in a weird way, that&rsquo;s also kind of fair.</p>
<p>Well, I would just disagree slightly in the sense that just because this has big distributional</p>
<p>consequences, like basically who makes the surplus, doesn&rsquo;t mean it also doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a huge deadweight loss associated with it.</p>
<p>And whenever you prohibit people from engaging in the type of economic contracts relationship</p>
<p>that they want to engage in, you&rsquo;re reducing surplus.</p>
<p>And so I hear what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And I think this is all about regulatory capture, right?</p>
<p>This is the Teamsters trying to capture a big piece of the value of Uber through their</p>
<p>politicians in the legislature.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>But I also think that we should care about it, not just as Uber shareholders, but as</p>
<p>consumers of the product, because it&rsquo;s going to get worse.</p>
<p>Well, and also the product&rsquo;s going to go away in certain jurisdictions.</p>
<p>If Freiburg wants to get an Uber north of the Golden Gate Bridge or in the East Bay</p>
<p>somewhere, they&rsquo;re just not going to have the economics in some communities to even</p>
<p>operate the service.</p>
<p>So just like Uber Eats and Postmates stopped delivering to Treasure Island, a lot of the</p>
<p>drivers were in their local communities at home with Uber turned on or DoorDash.</p>
<p>And when they got a call, they would leave their house.</p>
<p>And that was part of the magic of it is you could just be sitting there Netflixing or</p>
<p>hanging out with your kids, and then a good call comes in, and then you leave your house.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you would have that one-minute pause, if you ever saw it, in an Uber ride,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, why isn&rsquo;t the car moving?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because that person&rsquo;s at home.</p>
<p>And they were capturing the one ride every hour in their local suburban area.</p>
<p>But if you force them to be hourly, Uber&rsquo;s going to say, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth having an eight-hour shift in whatever suburb, and the service will go</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>And then guess who&rsquo;s going to not have service and transportation?</p>
<p>I think Freiburg-</p>
<p>No, go ahead.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I was saying it was like Saxe&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>From a consumer perspective, or Chamath&rsquo;s point, if you end up with 90 of these service providers,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a consumer, I&rsquo;m less likely to order a cab or order a rideshare service,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m less likely to order food for delivery.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to deal with 50 fucking apps.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have to go find the one app that has the contract with the one restaurant.</p>
<p>Then the natural market dynamics, the way that the market naturally evolves,</p>
<p>is I want simplicity as a consumer.</p>
<p>I want efficiency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes me want to use it more.</p>
<p>And when you take that away, because you&rsquo;re interfering from a regulatory perspective</p>
<p>and how that market operates, the product sucks for me, and the shareholders ultimately suffer.</p>
<p>I think to your point, the way that that would probably get solved is you have people that</p>
<p>are higher order in the consumer behavior that own these relationships that enforce,</p>
<p>basically, a user experience.</p>
<p>For example, Facebook and Google and Apple essentially say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re abstracting all these services because there&rsquo;s 90 of you.</p>
<p>Google says, I&rsquo;m going to put all of you guys on the map view.</p>
<p>Yelp says the same thing.</p>
<p>Essentially, what happens is there&rsquo;s some open way where, essentially, a service provider can</p>
<p>turn themselves on and broadcast into a network that says, I&rsquo;m available to do A for B,</p>
<p>and it all gets fixed.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a future state.</p>
<p>Which was the original idea of Uber, by the way, was to make a marketplace like that.</p>
<p>And now Uber&rsquo;s talking about doing a franchise.</p>
<p>Exactly what you&rsquo;re saying, Chamath, is let some franchisee take the East Bay and then</p>
<p>provide their inventory to the Uber network.</p>
<p>I think franchising is a really, really smart business idea.</p>
<p>And I think that particularly in transportation and a lot of these services that have this</p>
<p>natural dynamic to be local, where there are an infinite sum of many local markets,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like a Burger King.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And the company that moves to a franchising model and then figures it out, I think will</p>
<p>be a huge winner.</p>
<p>And that will be a very asset light, really operationally sophisticated, very well-run,</p>
<p>highly profitable business, I think.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the public markets.</p>
<p>Wait, Jason, can we just talk about the police brutality thing in California?</p>
<p>I just want to get your guys&rsquo; take.</p>
<p>Sure, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>It really bothers me that California, I bet you there&rsquo;s going to be states that are</p>
<p>diverse in its Democratic and Republican composition, and some Republican states</p>
<p>that passed comprehensive police reform, and California will be one of the laggards.</p>
<p>What do you think, if you could wave a magic wand, Chamath, what are the one, two, and</p>
<p>three things, take a minute to think it through, and everybody on the call can, what are the</p>
<p>one, two, and three things you would do to change policing in the United States?</p>
<p>I have my own list, but I&rsquo;m curious what you guys think.</p>
<p>And I actually put a tweetstorm out about my number one thing.</p>
<p>What are the specific tactical things?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get tactical first.</p>
<p>I mean, the first one that I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan of, as I&rsquo;ve studied it at least</p>
<p>from 10,000 feet, is ending qualified immunity.</p>
<p>Explain why and what that is.</p>
<p>Qualified immunity is essentially that there is this immunity that certain individuals have,</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re not subject to prosecution.</p>
<p>And so they essentially have a carte blanche to behave in ways that can be good in some</p>
<p>cases, very, very bad in other cases, gray in other cases, yet there&rsquo;s no adjudication</p>
<p>of their behavior.</p>
<p>And so you have to allow people with solid, dispassionate, detached judgment to be able</p>
<p>to enter and say, hey, listen, you were way out of line here, and there are consequences</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>And people coming in, doing those jobs, need to understand those consequences versus you</p>
<p>have a carte blanche to basically do whatever you want.</p>
<p>And I think with that-</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk specifically about the shooting involving, I won&rsquo;t say murder right now,</p>
<p>because I think all the facts are not in, but Jacob Blake was shot in the back.</p>
<p>He was obviously not listening to the police.</p>
<p>The police then followed him to his car.</p>
<p>There was a discussion of if there was a knife on the floorboard, and point blank, they shot</p>
<p>him in the back multiple times.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard both sides of this.</p>
<p>This person is not listening to the police.</p>
<p>This person is going into the car.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reaching potentially for a weapon, and the cops had no choice.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the training of a police officer might actually be that that was a</p>
<p>legitimate shooting.</p>
<p>But that means maybe they have to rethink policing, because you could have easily taken</p>
<p>that person down with even the most modest of a chokehold or a tackle.</p>
<p>And when we see that, it feels like that&rsquo;s the Rorschach test right there of how you</p>
<p>look at shootings in police.</p>
<p>You saw that shooting, I take it, Chamath, of Jacob Blake?</p>
<p>I saw it, and I can&rsquo;t see these anymore.</p>
<p>They send me off the rails for days.</p>
<p>But yeah, I did see it.</p>
<p>I did see it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, when you look at something like that, that&rsquo;s clearly training has to</p>
<p>change, because I believe that based on police training and qualified immunity, this is going</p>
<p>to be considered, even though it&rsquo;s shocking to see it, I think it&rsquo;s going to be considered</p>
<p>an allowed shooting.</p>
<p>The person&rsquo;s not going to be prosecuted because the person was clearly not listening, and</p>
<p>there was a knife on the floor, and he was going for it.</p>
<p>It seems to me like we really need to change the actual training.</p>
<p>The average is six months of training.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s one of the top things that has to change is that these police officers</p>
<p>have to be trained not to fire first, but to use other tactics.</p>
<p>So for me, the first one is that.</p>
<p>The second one for me, which I&rsquo;m a really big fan of, is that there needs to be a new</p>
<p>way to actually intercept 911 calls.</p>
<p>And instead of deploying police officers, we have a separate branch of people that we</p>
<p>massively pay and train that are effectively social workers plus plus.</p>
<p>Negotiators, yeah.</p>
<p>And they should be deployed in all kinds of situations where I think that what people</p>
<p>want is a de-escalation, and I think that sometimes the words de-escalation and police</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really sync up.</p>
<p>And in a lot of people&rsquo;s minds, they think of escalation.</p>
<p>So people who are trained to de-escalate, I think.</p>
<p>And so, for example, like, you know, all of the mental health checks, all of the mental</p>
<p>health issues could probably be dealing with folks like this.</p>
<p>Domestic disturbances would probably go into that category.</p>
<p>The third one is I would very much rationalize drug use just because I think the amount of</p>
<p>low level offenses and arrests around drug use is antiquated for people&rsquo;s general views</p>
<p>on drugs.</p>
<p>And I think that it needs to sort of correlate to how society views it.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the last two that I would give you is that there&rsquo;s a concept of no-knock</p>
<p>warrants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Breonna Taylor was killed.</p>
<p>Insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of really scary, the idea that we could all be sitting in our houses right now</p>
<p>as we are, and literally the police can just charge in.</p>
<p>I mean, totally unnecessarily.</p>
<p>I mean, she was being for some like low level drug idea, they&rsquo;re going to knock the doors</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>And of course, the person is going to try to protect themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the domain house sacks.</p>
<p>What are they not?</p>
<p>They knocked the doors in and they were playing clothes wearing police officers.</p>
<p>So people are coming and they did it at like midnight when she was asleep.</p>
<p>So yeah, people busting into her house at midnight, screaming, making noise and not</p>
<p>dressed as cops.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what are we doing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the last one I would give you is militarization of police.</p>
<p>A lot of these ideas, by the way, are Justin Amash&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve retweeted and I followed, but he was the one that put me onto these things.</p>
<p>But you know, like you have all this excess military equipment in the army that gets</p>
<p>basically passed through and now directly sold into police department, especially post</p>
<p>911.</p>
<p>We basically militarized.</p>
<p>So those are my ideas.</p>
<p>What are your ideas around policing and how we should change it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard two months.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have more detailed ideas than than Chamath.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s given some good ones.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we definitely need better training.</p>
<p>And I think better oversight over the use of force.</p>
<p>The, the, the body cam idea, Jason, I&rsquo;ve seen you, you tweet about, I think that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>interesting too.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just explain that for a minute.</p>
<p>The body cam idea I had was I asked, does anybody know, and you know, does Black Live</p>
<p>Matter or another organization track which police departments, because we could get a</p>
<p>list of every police department that exists in some database somewhere.</p>
<p>Do we actually know what percentage actually have body cams and what model they use and</p>
<p>what percentage are working?</p>
<p>Because one of the things that I think has happened this year is, you know, the live</p>
<p>streaming and the live video and the number of smartphones out there has resulted in us</p>
<p>being able to see what black and brown people have been telling us for decades, which is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re murdered by cops.</p>
<p>And now we get to see it.</p>
<p>And, you know, when you see George Floyd get murdered, it&rsquo;s fairly obvious that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what happened.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a video or they have the video of Breonna Taylor getting murdered.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s from a cop webcam, I&rsquo;m sorry, body cam.</p>
<p>So I was thinking we should just start with that as a basic, which is every single cop</p>
<p>car should have a 360 degree camera in every cop.</p>
<p>It should be a federal mandate.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t exactly know how federal mandates work, Sax.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think there should be a federal mandate for just cameras and car cameras?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>I think the use of cameras is a good idea.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe not recording the police officers when they&rsquo;re sitting in their car, but every</p>
<p>time there&rsquo;s like a, you know, like, yeah, they pull somebody over sort of, you know,</p>
<p>like Fourth Amendment type search and seizure type situation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it would make sense to have that on video.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you got to think every police will behave better.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Freeberg.</p>
<p>There was a case the other day, a young guy, I think he was 19 years old, was shot in DC</p>
<p>named Dion K.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any of you guys watched the body cam footage.</p>
<p>And so he was a 19 year old black man.</p>
<p>He was shot.</p>
<p>He died.</p>
<p>But in the body cam footage, you can see that he pulls out this gun and throws it.</p>
<p>And when he pulls out the gun and flings his hand around, he&rsquo;s got the gun in his hand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the cop shot him.</p>
<p>And so there was about 100 protesters that showed up.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s largely become a non story as a result of the facts associated with the body cam</p>
<p>footage.</p>
<p>But I just want to propose something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit more radical.</p>
<p>Maybe my libertarian ideals kind of cross with my socialist ideals and forming this</p>
<p>concept.</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a socialist?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve never been accused of that.</p>
<p>But if we trace back, these systems are really chaotic.</p>
<p>Everything you&rsquo;re talking about is layers and layers of bureaucracy and ideas and shit</p>
<p>we should do to manage the problem.</p>
<p>But there is kind of one common butterfly effect, butterflies at the source of a lot</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re talking about, which is guns.</p>
<p>If there weren&rsquo;t any guns in the United States, I would not feel threatened as a police officer.</p>
<p>I would never have any reason to feel threatened.</p>
<p>And I would never have any reason to pull a gun.</p>
<p>The reason I always make to pull a gun as a police officer is my life is threatened.</p>
<p>And in the absence of firearms, I have no right to pull a gun.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the case in the UK, for example, where there are no police officer shootings</p>
<p>of civilians because they&rsquo;re never under threat of being killed by a gun.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a simple answer, which is get rid of the guns, but a little too controversial</p>
<p>and obviously many layers to that argument, especially from kind of both sides.</p>
<p>But I would say much of what&rsquo;s going to go on now and in the future is just chaos theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be building more layers of complexity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more entropy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more kind of associated complexity to try and resolve the underlying problem of</p>
<p>all of this, which is that we&rsquo;ve got guns on the streets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got guns in people&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>And therefore, there&rsquo;s always this threat against every individual that their life might</p>
<p>be taken by another.</p>
<p>Well, let me make a prediction right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not going to be any new gun control legislation for a generation because of the</p>
<p>looting and rioting that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Gun sales are at an all-time high.</p>
<p>I mean, every single gun store that you can possibly go to, you can&rsquo;t get guns, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get ammo.</p>
<p>And there are more first-time gun buyers in the United States in the last several months</p>
<p>than there&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>I mean, the ranks of the NRA must just be swelling right now.</p>
<p>And so, this idea that you&rsquo;re going to get gun reform, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t going to support it.</p>
<p>And I think you used the word, I think, idealistic.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s like a little bit naive to assume that you&rsquo;re going to be able to</p>
<p>get rid of all the guns in the hands of bad actors.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people in this country who feel the need to have a gun to protect</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>And the cops can&rsquo;t always get there quickly enough.</p>
<p>And a lot of people feel the need to have that for self-defense.</p>
<p>I also think the minimum amount of training for a police officer should not be six months.</p>
<p>I think they have to re&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, if we really want to have the society move forward and to solve our issue of race,</p>
<p>which is like the original sin of America, we&rsquo;re going to really need to start thinking</p>
<p>about making police go back to school for 18 months, 12 months, and rethink how we address</p>
<p>the situation.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just tragically unfair that one group of people&rsquo;s children has to worry when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re driving in a car, and other people on this call don&rsquo;t have to worry, right?</p>
<p>And that is just crazy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a hard shift to the economy, and then we&rsquo;ll go into the election.</p>
<p>What do you think, Chamath?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been talking a little bit about the economy and the stock market ripping again,</p>
<p>and we seem to have hit a pause.</p>
<p>But we did have a massive rip with Tesla and Apple, I guess, doing a stock split.</p>
<p>And we hit all-time records.</p>
<p>Why are we hitting all-time records, Chamath?</p>
<p>We have the most important thing that&rsquo;s happened, I think, in economics in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, gave this landmark speech, and he basically said,</p>
<p>we are going to keep rates at zero for the next half decade, basically.</p>
<p>Five years at zero, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, quite honestly, it could be a decade.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re going to let inflation run before they basically match it with rates.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no path to any near-term inflation of any kind whatsoever.</p>
<p>And so, Jason, my honest perspective is, you&rsquo;re basically going to get paid to be</p>
<p>long equities because your risk-free rate is zero and will soon be negative.</p>
<p>And what are you supposed to do if you&rsquo;re an asset manager?</p>
<p>What are you supposed to do if you take California back to using California?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say you&rsquo;re CalPERS, you&rsquo;re the California pension system, and you have</p>
<p>hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Then you need to generate 5% or 6% a year to make sure that your pension isn&rsquo;t insolvent.</p>
<p>And the government is paying you zero.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, that eliminates that option.</p>
<p>No treasuries for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re long equities.</p>
<p>And when everybody is in that situation, you&rsquo;re overwhelmingly long equities.</p>
<p>And you cannot fight the Fed.</p>
<p>And so, you cannot wait them out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you can say, oh, don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;re going to change their mind.</p>
<p>They will change their mind, but in reaction to market conditions that are out of your control.</p>
<p>So, all of these opportunities, in my opinion, are generally buying opportunities.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m generally bullish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more bullish now than I was before.</p>
<p>So, you can&rsquo;t put your money into treasuries.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t put it into a savings account, obviously.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like real estate or commercial real estate is a great bet right now.</p>
<p>So, your options are private companies or public companies.</p>
<p>Correct, Jamal?</p>
<p>I think it really is just public companies.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s private companies.</p>
<p>So, meaning, wherever capital is constrained, the returns, again, these excess returns are</p>
<p>getting eaten up.</p>
<p>And so, the most unimpeded market for gains right now is the public markets.</p>
<p>I mean, no offense, but I think that if you are a very good stock picker in the public</p>
<p>markets, you&rsquo;re generating better returns than Sequoia, Benchmark, name your best venture</p>
<p>fund.</p>
<p>I see all these people spouting off on Twitter about how good they are in the early stage</p>
<p>markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all kind of small dollars and not that meaningful.</p>
<p>You know I&rsquo;m on the call, right, Jamal?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the call.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re literally talking to the guys spouting off about hitting home runs.</p>
<p>Sax, what are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Private markets, obviously, is where we operate, both David&rsquo;s, Freeberg, and Sax.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re seeing great deals, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve invested in twice as many companies during the pandemic as I did before in the same six</p>
<p>month period.</p>
<p>What are you seeing in the private markets?</p>
<p>What is your take on Best DC&rsquo;s public markets, Sax?</p>
<p>Yeah, we saw some of the best deals that we&rsquo;ve seen during COVID.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very bullish about the state of entrepreneurship in the US.</p>
<p>I mean, just the number of interesting companies doing interesting things and the infrastructure</p>
<p>that makes it so easy for founders to get started and create new companies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much easier now to create a company than it was 10 years or 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s easy to point to all the ones that don&rsquo;t work or that don&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>good ideas.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many more experiments that are happening.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s going to&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very bullish about that part of the American economy.</p>
<p>And Freeberg, what are your thoughts on private markets?</p>
<p>And obviously, you&rsquo;re building private companies.</p>
<p>You have unlimited capital to build them, I take it, given your track record.</p>
<p>I spend most of my time accepting rejections from my very close investor friends in my</p>
<p>various projects.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t say that that ever becomes true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth.</p>
<p>Still selling every day, dialing for dollars.</p>
<p>But no, there are certainly more investors, more capital, more risk-taking, more valuation</p>
<p>extending than I think was the case pre-COVID.</p>
<p>I think Chamath&rsquo;s point is right, though.</p>
<p>There is so much more liquidity available through access to retail and international</p>
<p>market participants in a public setting than there is in a private setting.</p>
<p>And it is because of this liquidity premium and the easy access to putting capital in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just extraordinary how much&hellip;</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve watched close friends and companies and companies I&rsquo;ve invested in, and I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>you guys have done the same, transition from private to public, the valuation jump is</p>
<p>extraordinary on a metrics basis.</p>
<p>So whatever the metric might be, you get public.</p>
<p>There is this flurry of market participation.</p>
<p>As a result, it drives up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a multiple expansion.</p>
<p>Wait, I thought&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a beast.</p>
<p>Sorry, can I just say something?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an important, smart thing that Friedberg said.</p>
<p>So Jason, for example, all of us, we&rsquo;re all still in the private markets.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to take away from the private markets.</p>
<p>But what David said is so important.</p>
<p>If you used to look at a SaaS deal, you&rsquo;d price that SaaS deal 10 times ARR, right?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a little bit of inflation.</p>
<p>The rates go up.</p>
<p>The prices that people pay go up.</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re paying 12 times, 15 times.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s 20 times if you&rsquo;re growing 100% rate every year.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happened?</p>
<p>The market has become more efficient and the excess return is getting eaten up.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re like, okay, well, that&rsquo;s still really good.</p>
<p>And you wait four, five, six years, and you think you&rsquo;re going to get paid.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is like, once that company transitions to the public markets, I mean,</p>
<p>all of a sudden, if you actually turn the investor base over and you actually create</p>
<p>a float so that public market guys can buy it, they&rsquo;ll pay 30 times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>35 times, 40 times.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a massive multiple expansion.</p>
<p>So companies should be going public sooner.</p>
<p>If you think about this, like if I&rsquo;m trying to raise money for one of my companies,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to call on my 10, 20, 30 friends that I know that are investors in private</p>
<p>markets and say, hey, guys, do you want to look at this company?</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;ll get two or three interested parties.</p>
<p>And maybe we&rsquo;ll kind of agree on what a fair valuation would be.</p>
<p>If I could take that same company and instantly make it available to a million investors.</p>
<p>And all I need to do, by the way, is raise $10 million.</p>
<p>All I need is some small number of them to write a couple hundred dollar check.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m able to fill that round out.</p>
<p>The valuation as a result of the liquidity available in that market is so much higher</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s going to be much more participation and bidding.</p>
<p>And so what I think Chamath has tapped into with the SPAC vehicle and what Robinhood is</p>
<p>realizing, and I don&rsquo;t think that we all talk about this enough, but there&rsquo;s this massive,</p>
<p>massive, massive market of international investors, of small international retail</p>
<p>investors who are now rushing into US equities.</p>
<p>Freeberg, didn&rsquo;t we see that in the ICO craze as well?</p>
<p>Where I think if we took anything from the ICO craze, it was the global appetite for risk and</p>
<p>the dot-com boom before that.</p>
<p>And I think we have to give Best DC a lot of credit here for leading the SPAC movement.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your take on everybody copying you down the SPAC path, Chamath, at this point?</p>
<p>I had Desktop Metal as an early angel investment that just SPACed.</p>
<p>I did the pipe, too.</p>
<p>I co-led the pipe.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they told me that.</p>
<p>Thank you for the markup.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m getting inbound as an angel investor from, I literally got a cold email from some</p>
<p>high profile people and they&rsquo;re like, hey, do you have anything for us to SPAC?</p>
<p>I mean, this is the third or fourth time people are coming down to my dipshit level of angel</p>
<p>investing saying, can you introduce us to the calm guys?</p>
<p>Can you introduce us to Robin Hood?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I think you can go direct to them.</p>
<p>But what is your take on how many SPACs have been created since you literally single-handedly</p>
<p>restarted the SPAC movement, Chamath?</p>
<p>I think that-</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve ever gone on record about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud of what we did when we created this thing two years ago.</p>
<p>I said I want to basically create a new way of doing IPOs.</p>
<p>I called it IPO 2.0.</p>
<p>I reserved IPO A through Z on the NYSE.</p>
<p>I hope to fulfill that and I think I will.</p>
<p>But taking a step back for a second, in the year 2000, there were 8,000 public companies</p>
<p>in America on the American stock exchanges and in the year 2020, there are 4,000.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve shrunk in half the number of public companies while at the same time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve 10x the amount of capital and the number of people.</p>
<p>So, we don&rsquo;t have a large enough surface area in the public markets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why companies are better off going public because they&rsquo;re going to have a much</p>
<p>more receptive audience of people that are dying to own growth of any kind.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the earliest and the median that people should go public?</p>
<p>Well, so here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re one of 30 companies in a venture portfolio that&rsquo;s growing at 50 plus percent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of 30.</p>
<p>But when you go public, you&rsquo;re one of one.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re growing 50, 60 percent, you become very unique all of a sudden.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a sort of a 1% kind of a company.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an outlier and so you get treated incredibly well.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the backdrop.</p>
<p>I think a company should be going public around year five, year six.</p>
<p>What revenue footprint?</p>
<p>About 50 million.</p>
<p>At 50 million and when they&rsquo;re doubling, I think that they should be going up.</p>
<p>You know, it allows them to build capital slowly.</p>
<p>It allows them to basically contain control.</p>
<p>It minimizes dilution.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really powerful model.</p>
<p>And then on the number of SPACs, what I would say is I think it&rsquo;s really good that the market</p>
<p>is getting diversified.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s going to happen is like the thing with SPACs is it&rsquo;s going to be no different</p>
<p>than in some ways the banks that preceded us, which is that there&rsquo;s going to be a distribution.</p>
<p>You can go to Goldman Sachs and that&rsquo;ll mean one thing.</p>
<p>You can go to Merrill Lynch or B of A or UBS or Jeffries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll mean other things.</p>
<p>You can go to Allen &amp; Company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll mean yet another different set of things and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s going to be an organization</p>
<p>that is all about cost.</p>
<p>Some is going to be all about relationships.</p>
<p>So, I just think that&rsquo;s going to be the distribution.</p>
<p>My personal perspective, it&rsquo;s probably us and maybe one or two other people who really</p>
<p>dominate the space and I&rsquo;ll tell you the only reason why I say that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be really important when these people try to get these SPACs done,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going to realize is it&rsquo;s really hard and it&rsquo;s hard for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>Number one is you have to marry operational insight and public market sophistication.</p>
<p>And the founder will get really smart about being able to figure out whether this person</p>
<p>is just a financial arbitrager or if the person has enough operational experience to deeply</p>
<p>understand the business.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>You have to translate it to the public market as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one huge thing that I think that people will start to hone in on.</p>
<p>Anyways, there&rsquo;s a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>Are you now competing with a lot of people for these SPACs?</p>
<p>Does SACs agree with the $50 million number?</p>
<p>SACs agree, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cool with that.</p>
<p>I invest well before that.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d be happy for‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You probably have a bigger portfolio of $50 million investors.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great for me and Jason.</p>
<p>I think Tramont deserves a ton of credit on this whole SPAC thing.</p>
<p>It is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if all the listeners are aware of this, but the SPAC thing has become a huge</p>
<p>wave.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of people creating them.</p>
<p>Kevin Hartz has a new one.</p>
<p>Reid Hoffman has a new one.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the East Coast hedge fund guys.</p>
<p>Pincus and then the East Coast hedge funds like Bill Ackman, wherever, they&rsquo;re all creating</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>So, Tramont has really started a wave here.</p>
<p>And I think the appeal of a SPAC to a founder, I&rsquo;ll put in a plug of why I think it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>idea for a founder to consider this, is because you essentially‚Ä¶</p>
<p>What founders are used to is doing private rounds, right?</p>
<p>You agree on an amount raised and a valuation and it&rsquo;s a percent dilution and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple, right?</p>
<p>And when you IPO and need to raise money, it&rsquo;s not like that.</p>
<p>You have to then work with an investment bank.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll put together a book.</p>
<p>You do like a road show.</p>
<p>You do this whole dog and pony thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how much money you&rsquo;re going to get at the end of that process or what</p>
<p>the valuation is going to be.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, we know statistically, Bill Gurley has published all the stats, the</p>
<p>investment banks are going to rip you off.</p>
<p>So, what a SPAC does is it prices like a late-stage private round.</p>
<p>You just agree with a SPAC promoter on a valuation and an amount raised.</p>
<p>And then on top of it, you get kind of a direct listing along with it.</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden, you start trading as a public company.</p>
<p>And so, a SPAC is like a combination direct listing plus private round.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s going to be appealing to a lot of founders as they start to discover</p>
<p>this more and more.</p>
<p>SACs, in a way, you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s going to feel more like doing a Series D than it does</p>
<p>a road show.</p>
<p>And I think that comfort level for somebody like Robinhood, or Calm, or DataStax, or Thumbtack,</p>
<p>or any of these companies that you and I are investors in-</p>
<p>Every company in your portfolio, you just say,</p>
<p>Listen, I got two IPOs in two years.</p>
<p>I think this is going to be the new thing for early stage investors is we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to count unicorns anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to count SPACs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to count public listings, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably better.</p>
<p>By the way, the other thing that I&rsquo;ll say to founders is one is I think you need to</p>
<p>think about do these people have the combination of operational and financial acumen in the</p>
<p>public markets and investing experience in the public markets and the operational credibility</p>
<p>to describe the business.</p>
<p>And I think you can trade off one for the other if one is so deep, meaning if Warren</p>
<p>Buffett was doing his SPAC, you&rsquo;d say, Well, he has no operational experience, but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so credible in the public markets, then that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>
<p>But you need to be super, super deep in one or have a really brilliant and thoughtful</p>
<p>level of credibility in the publics.</p>
<p>Meaning an early stage investor who isn&rsquo;t married to somebody who can basically say,</p>
<p>I know how hedge funds work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made them money, and I&rsquo;m going to make them more money and mutual funds, et cetera,</p>
<p>is troublesome.</p>
<p>The second thing is for founders, you have to really make sure you understand what is</p>
<p>in it for the person that&rsquo;s doing the SPAC.</p>
<p>I mean, in every deal, I write a minimum of $100 million personally, and that&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s getting the game.</p>
<p>I feel very much at risk, and so I take a lot of time to make sure these things go well.</p>
<p>And then the third is that for the SPAC person, what I&rsquo;ll tell them is they are going to find</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a bunch of landmines.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to say it up front because I think it&rsquo;ll be fun for them to find out</p>
<p>themselves along the way.</p>
<p>But these things are hard.</p>
<p>The first one took me two and a half years.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>Hey, let&rsquo;s swing to the election now and talk a little bit about the flip-flopping we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all doing, because we&rsquo;ve gone from Trump&rsquo;s a lock to Trump&rsquo;s not a lock, and we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>many different theories.</p>
<p>But here we are.</p>
<p>Are we 60 days out now?</p>
<p>How many days till the election?</p>
<p>Is it exactly 60?</p>
<p>A little less.</p>
<p>The first debate is September 29th.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re at the 55 or 56 days, more to the taping of this.</p>
<p>And the first debate, I think, is September 30th.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re about three weeks away from Joe Biden and Trump going at it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s handicapping now?</p>
<p>The markets seem to be saying even money or a slight edge to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>What are our thoughts?</p>
<p>I think Biden&rsquo;s looked the crispest he&rsquo;s looked.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is that actually encouraging or not encouraging?</p>
<p>I think it really is, because I think he&rsquo;s a really good&hellip;</p>
<p>Like I said, he doesn&rsquo;t have to be better than Donald Trump.</p>
<p>He just has to not be Donald Trump for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And so he becomes a very good do-no-harm alternative, because to support Donald Trump,</p>
<p>you have to have a view.</p>
<p>To support Joe Biden, you can have no view.</p>
<p>And I think that, in general, that&rsquo;s a demand-maximizing thing to do.</p>
<p>So I think he&rsquo;s relatively well-positioned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the crispest I&rsquo;ve ever seen him on television.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less stuttering.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less, not stuttering, but less mental gaffes.</p>
<p>You know, the&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you think of the VP choice, Kamala?</p>
<p>I think safe.</p>
<p>So I agree with Tramont that that was kind of the take or theory on Biden</p>
<p>like a month or two ago, is that he could just run as a protest vote against Trump.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the basement strategy appeared to make sense,</p>
<p>is that he would say nothing, do nothing, go nowhere,</p>
<p>and just try to run as a protest vote against Trump.</p>
<p>And I think that was working a couple of months ago when,</p>
<p>you know, A, COVID seemed a lot worse.</p>
<p>B, the economy seemed a lot worse.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now down to about 8% unemployment.</p>
<p>We were at 13% or 14%.</p>
<p>And C, you know, Trump had seemed to kind of mishandle the reaction to Floyd.</p>
<p>He seemed to be inciting it.</p>
<p>But now we have this issue of the looting and violence</p>
<p>in predominantly Democrat-run cities.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, Trump has sort of found his sales pitch now</p>
<p>in opposing basically the radical left and these mobs and protests</p>
<p>and protests that seem to be, you know, causing tremendous unrest</p>
<p>and looting and violence in our cities.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s in combination with the improving conditions of the economy and COVID,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a winning pitch for him,</p>
<p>unless Biden finds a more compelling way of responding, which he has not to date.</p>
<p>I think, you know, somebody like Bill Clinton would know exactly how to respond.</p>
<p>I think he would, you know, in the-</p>
<p>Just better instincts, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I think, you know, he would pull a sister soldier to use a term from the</p>
<p>political dictionary where, you know, maybe he would take this crazy new book</p>
<p>in defense of looting and figure out, you know, and give a speech denouncing that.</p>
<p>I mean, he would find somebody to his left who represents,</p>
<p>you know, a fringe of the left that he presumably doesn&rsquo;t support</p>
<p>and find a way to distance himself or denounce them.</p>
<p>Like Antifa, maybe.</p>
<p>Like Antifa, like, you know, anyone, you know, any of the left-</p>
<p>Looting in Portland.</p>
<p>Looting in Portland.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of targets, certainly.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to support that.</p>
<p>And so Biden comes out and says, hey, we don&rsquo;t support that.</p>
<p>And it gives him that law and order vote.</p>
<p>But he hasn&rsquo;t done that.</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t really done that.</p>
<p>I mean, so two of my favorite political pundits right now are Andrew Sullivan and Matt Taibbi,</p>
<p>who are, you know, very, they&rsquo;re strong supporters of Biden.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very anti-Trump.</p>
<p>But they think he&rsquo;s failing on sort of this, these issues because he&rsquo;s not figuring out</p>
<p>the right way to denounce what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I think a lot of this has to do with when kids go back to school and the death rate</p>
<p>of COVID.</p>
<p>And as I was tweeting, and I got a lot of people angry at me about tweeting this,</p>
<p>but I said, I think this is a setup for Trump to go into the first debate</p>
<p>with, you know, well under, you know, six, 700 deaths a day.</p>
<p>And then the next debate in October with, you know, call it three or 400 deaths a day</p>
<p>and basically declare that he did solve COVID because we&rsquo;ve been trending down for five weeks</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>And he started wearing a mask six weeks ago, seven weeks ago, July 11th was the first day</p>
<p>he wore a mask.</p>
<p>A cynic would say he almost timed mask wearing, which is obviously what we talked about in the</p>
<p>first episode or two of All In podcast was our discussion about why is wearing a mask</p>
<p>so difficult for him.</p>
<p>And it seems like he slow played it.</p>
<p>He, you know, he set, he slow played, he hit a set on the turn and here he is.</p>
<p>Like he wore the mask on July 11th.</p>
<p>He wore it four months late, but guess what?</p>
<p>As Chamath was saying, everybody wears a mask and every, and these things go down in Italy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to come into the first debate.</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s 400 deaths a day?</p>
<p>And then the second debate, it&rsquo;s 200 deaths a day.</p>
<p>And then our kids are back in school in October, which seems to be the case, right?</p>
<p>All the schools are saying, you know, be ready for October to open.</p>
<p>And what if he actually does have a vaccine that has somewhat of credibility or any of</p>
<p>these high speed testing machines come on?</p>
<p>I mean, this could be a setup of all setups for him to just, you know, drop the microphone.</p>
<p>Hey, look, the economy has had an all-time high and COVID deaths are an all-time low.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, yeah, I think that to me seems like the trajectory.</p>
<p>I mean, we spent a long time on this pod talking about what a disaster</p>
<p>San Francisco and California are.</p>
<p>Those are one party states and cities.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, we&rsquo;re not just electing a person as president.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also electing a party and a movement and a governing philosophy.</p>
<p>And however much Trump is, you know, disliked by a lot of people, I think a lot of people</p>
<p>are looking at, you know, I think they may like Joe Biden personally and think that he</p>
<p>personally is safe, but they don&rsquo;t like the movement and the party and the governing philosophy</p>
<p>that is now associated with Biden.</p>
<p>So if you had to put your entire net worth on it, Chamath, Biden, or Trump?</p>
<p>Uh, Biden.</p>
<p>I think Biden&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Okay, and Sachs, entire net worth?</p>
<p>I would, I predict Trump at this moment.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, you predict, but you wouldn&rsquo;t put your entire net worth on it.</p>
<p>If you had to, I could see your hesitation.</p>
<p>You want Trump to win.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>But you wouldn&rsquo;t put your entire net worth on him?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, of course not.</p>
<p>You would put it on Biden?</p>
<p>This is about a 55% sort of thing.</p>
<p>So Biden has a 55% chance of winning.</p>
<p>So even though you&rsquo;re voting for Trump, you are not going, you would not put your fortune on</p>
<p>Biden, correct?</p>
<p>You asked me who I predict.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m predicting Trump.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll remember on the last pod, I predicted Biden.</p>
<p>So it moves depending on what I see happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m going to go with Biden by a nose.</p>
<p>Jason, I think a better way to get a better answer is not to force somebody to put their</p>
<p>entire net worth on the line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to say, who do you think is going to win?</p>
<p>Who do you think is going to win, Sachs?</p>
<p>How many times do I have to answer this question?</p>
<p>You think Trump&rsquo;s going to win?</p>
<p>You actually do?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I do, actually.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fascinating, huh?</p>
<p>And is Freeburg still there?</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve said this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the same as it was last time for me, and it has been most of this process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a coin flip, and it still is a coin flip.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of noise between here and 60 days from here.</p>
<p>All right, well, then if we do think it&rsquo;s a coin flip, Freeburg, what happens if Trump</p>
<p>is elected again?</p>
<p>Some people think this is all institutions are broken forever.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s broken forever.</p>
<p>Hyperbolic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the perception on both sides, right?</p>
<p>So the perception and the motivation on both sides is democracy is crumbling.</p>
<p>And the resultant action is to elect the person you think will restore democracy.</p>
<p>The reality is both candidates, to some degree, might move us a little bit further away from</p>
<p>democracy.</p>
<p>And some might argue that Trump makes us feel a little bit more like an autocratic dictatorial</p>
<p>regime, and some might say that Biden makes us feel a little bit more like an AOC socialist</p>
<p>regime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all the way as if we had Bernie in the seat, but the reaction isn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to the middle.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s become a centrist government.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have good political debate.</p>
<p>By the way, the one show I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of lately, just to nostalgia to Chamath&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tweet earlier today, make me feel better about life is West Wing, where Jed Bartlett is the</p>
<p>president, and he wants a great national debate.</p>
<p>We all want to have this intellectual exercise of coming to the truth and coming to the best</p>
<p>decision for the nation.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anyone feels like that&rsquo;s the case today, nor will that be the case</p>
<p>tomorrow with either of these guys in the seat.</p>
<p>And I think the point then becomes, well, who&rsquo;s going to better align with my values?</p>
<p>And it is really a crumbling democracy kind of motivation, I would guess, if you were</p>
<p>to survey people as to how they&rsquo;re making their choice.</p>
<p>If Trump is elected Freeberg, do you feel it is an acute existential crisis for America</p>
<p>as a democracy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think democracies end with a bang.</p>
<p>I think they end with a whimper.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s been the case historically.</p>
<p>And no democracy has lasted.</p>
<p>Our democracy in the US has lasted longer than many.</p>
<p>But democracies, I&rsquo;ll just tell you my point of view on this, democracies ultimately enable</p>
<p>freedom of operation and free markets that result in greater progress than any other</p>
<p>governing system.</p>
<p>The problem with progress is that progress is asymmetric.</p>
<p>You have some people who progress at a much greater rate than most, and it is that delta</p>
<p>that motivates the end of that system ultimately.</p>
<p>While everyone in the United States or the average and even the bottom quartile of the</p>
<p>population in the US is better off than they were 50 years ago in terms of income and healthcare</p>
<p>and shelter and access to food and access to all these things, the top 1% of the US</p>
<p>is further ahead than the median.</p>
<p>And it is that delta that motivates the end of democracy.</p>
<p>And it is that which is then perceived to be unfair about this governing system.</p>
<p>And that ultimately results in fascism or socialism.</p>
<p>And then fascism results, socialism ultimately restricts anyone from progression.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why fascism and socialism ultimately end up in some sort of democratic outcome.</p>
<p>And it is a cycle.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of in this awkward phase of trying to figure out what the hell we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be next.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that awkward phase is realized in the next presidential term.</p>
<p>But it is going to be realized in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a really good point.</p>
<p>I completely agree with that.</p>
<p>Go Biden.</p>
<p>Go, but please win.</p>
<p>Okay, wrapping up here.</p>
<p>Media selections of your bestie summer bestie book, bestie TV show, bestie binge.</p>
<p>What do you got?</p>
<p>You got a bestie book recommendation, Sachs?</p>
<p>You got a bestie?</p>
<p>Yeah, my recommendation is gonna be a little different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been subscribing to a lot of newsletters on Substack.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I found that to be pretty interesting.</p>
<p>And I mentioned two of my favorite writers, especially around politics and election time,</p>
<p>Andrew Sullivan and Matt Taibbi.</p>
<p>So check them out.</p>
<p>Is your Overton windows open enough to get to those two who are super polarized?</p>
<p>And they actually kicked Andrew Sullivan out of New York magazine for making other writers</p>
<p>at New York magazine feel unsafe with his words.</p>
<p>All my favorite writers seem to have been canceled at some previous publication.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;ve set themselves up on Substack.</p>
<p>So it is amazing how the Overton window has closed.</p>
<p>Bestie Seeds, you have a bestie binge, a bestie book, or a bestie newsletter,</p>
<p>or a bestie podcast you want to share with the besties?</p>
<p>I would give a shout out to a book called Americana, which is about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a history of American capitalism told in chapters for every call it like,</p>
<p>you know, five to seven or 10 year decade period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting for people into business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written by a guy named Boo Srinivasan.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Bestie Freeberg, what do you got?</p>
<p>Bestie Queen of Quinoa.</p>
<p>I took a week off and hung out at the beach.</p>
<p>And I binge watched Godfather 1, 2, and 3, as I&rsquo;ve done several times in my past.</p>
<p>I also watched one of my favorite top five films of all time,</p>
<p>There Will Be Blood by Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>
<p>Such a good film.</p>
<p>That opening scene is just crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just such a beautiful film.</p>
<p>I drink your milkshake.</p>
<p>It got me down.</p>
<p>Yeah, it got me down this research path on the Standard Oil Company.</p>
<p>And I ended up, first off, I ended up reading Mario Puzo&rsquo;s Godfather,</p>
<p>which is very graphic and interesting.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve seen the movie, I don&rsquo;t think you get much more from the book.</p>
<p>But then I started reading Ron Chernow&rsquo;s biography of Rockefeller.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone&rsquo;s made it through that 727 page too.</p>
<p>I got about 500 pages in.</p>
<p>It is detailed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s detailed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not probably, you won&rsquo;t gain as much from it as perhaps reading a Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>But the Standard Oil, the era, if you think about what technology is,</p>
<p>what we call technology in the U.S. today, in our world,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s mostly software and now increasingly biotech,</p>
<p>there have been different eras of technology and different eras of monopoly.</p>
<p>And just hearing the story of the railroads and Standard Oil</p>
<p>and what took place in this country, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so analogous to what&rsquo;s gone on and the outrage and the dissent</p>
<p>and the fake news that goes on about these people as they&rsquo;ve been successful.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>History teaches us everything.</p>
<p>Just in the era of Standard Oil, just learning about the stories of that time</p>
<p>and the people of that time, this is one book that&rsquo;s been an interesting part of the tale.</p>
<p>Besties, I got to go.</p>
<p>I love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you for a steak.</p>
<p>Jason and Friedburgers, I&rsquo;ll see you on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yeah, steak it up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give them on my closing, The Fish That Ate the Whale,</p>
<p>a book about Sam Zimmery, who was the Banana King,</p>
<p>and another interesting book you might like, I Love Capitalism by Ken Langone,</p>
<p>who built Home Depot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pretty great story about both stories of capitalism.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ll like them, Friedburg, if you like the books you were talking about.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, we&rsquo;ll see you next time.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to rate and subscribe.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll be taping another episode in another five, six, seven, or eight weeks,</p>
<p>hopefully earlier than that.</p>
<p>Take care, Sachs.</p>
<p>Take care, Friedburg.</p>
<p>Take care, Chamath.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see you all next time on The Olin Podcast.</p>
