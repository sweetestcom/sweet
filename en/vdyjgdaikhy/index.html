<p>maybe try that one filming I need a tan</p>
<p>yeah lighting now that didn&rsquo;t do it I</p>
<p>think must be light is everything when</p>
<p>you think that I</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s okay that&rsquo;s much better see</p>
<p>that good I usually am oh we just got</p>
<p>too many lights you know what guys</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna have to like that</p>
<p>complexion cuz it&rsquo;s a big spiky so</p>
<p>please type about how pale we are and</p>
<p>how I look like a cartoon character</p>
<p>and how thin we are ok good oh my gosh</p>
<p>crazy please comment below okay good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go Kay let&rsquo;s go to Aaron from San</p>
<p>Diego okay okay well this is good well</p>
<p>at least you know at least we look kind</p>
<p>of normal so I&rsquo;m gonna let you reboot</p>
<p>this and I&rsquo;m gonna great</p>
<p>well aaron has a question about</p>
<p>grass-fed versus grain-fed Graham be</p>
<p>totally on screen and so what I want to</p>
<p>do is I want to answer Aaron&rsquo;s question</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>rebooting something over here so what is</p>
<p>the difference the main difference is</p>
<p>the the grain fed unfortunately has a</p>
<p>lot of omega-6 fatty acids which are</p>
<p>very very damaging to the system and</p>
<p>Erin can you hear me right now I just</p>
<p>got you on okay great</p>
<p>let me just get your exact question from</p>
<p>you okay so because I know you had a</p>
<p>specific question go ahead good morning</p>
<p>huh Wow yeah interesting</p>
<p>so the go ahead</p>
<p>right yeah</p>
<p>good question and just for those people</p>
<p>on YouTube that can&rsquo;t hear the question</p>
<p>Aaron want to know you went to the store</p>
<p>and he bought some grass grass-fed beef</p>
<p>and I talked to the butcher and he said</p>
<p>it was grass-finished but I guess they</p>
<p>also used some grains in there before</p>
<p>they grass-finished it so unfortunately</p>
<p>for the problem you&rsquo;re gonna run into is</p>
<p>if it says grass-fed they could still</p>
<p>finish it off with grains so ideally the</p>
<p>best thing to do is to get something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grass-fed grass-finished and</p>
<p>organic that&rsquo;s the ideal situation</p>
<p>because if they gave the grains then at</p>
<p>least that would not be GMO grains okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>but if it usually says grass-fed</p>
<p>grass-finished it shouldn&rsquo;t involve</p>
<p>grains on the label so a lot of a lot of</p>
<p>manufacturing companies are going</p>
<p>towards that now because they know they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just say grass-fed so you want to</p>
<p>say grass-fed grass-finished finished</p>
<p>and then organic but other than that um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna have to cope if you go</p>
<p>to like wellness meets us us wellness</p>
<p>meets comm has they do have grass-fed</p>
<p>grass-finished and no grains at all so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one there were several sites they</p>
<p>have that but that&rsquo;s interesting that he</p>
<p>found a place that is grass-finished it</p>
<p>means that they know that a marketing</p>
<p>button is grass-finished so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking a shortcut and doing grain-fed to</p>
<p>fatten them up throwing them in a yard</p>
<p>for a week yep and so you have to do</p>
<p>your homework I guess that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>thanks Erin listen guys I have a really</p>
<p>cool announcement so I spent the last</p>
<p>two months putting together the most</p>
<p>amazing course on how to boost</p>
<p>bulletproof your immune system not just</p>
<p>boost a bit bullet proof your immune</p>
<p>system and the reason I&rsquo;m doing this is</p>
<p>because right now the big elephant in</p>
<p>the room is no one is emphasizing the</p>
<p>immune system they&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>strengthen the immune system it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about waiting for some hope some time</p>
<p>The Vaccines yeah but the point is that</p>
<p>the immune system is your best option</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s always boils down to your</p>
<p>immune system the biggest problems right</p>
<p>now our people without a good immune</p>
<p>system so this course is 21 video</p>
<p>lessons and I put a lot of energy into</p>
<p>it and I want to give it to you free but</p>
<p>when I give stuff free sometimes people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t value it so I just want to let you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s it is very valuable</p>
<p>so all I ask in return is you do three</p>
<p>things you share it with everyone you</p>
<p>know because can you imagine if we had</p>
<p>thousands of people actually sharing</p>
<p>this course and doing this course well</p>
<p>what kind of effect that would create</p>
<p>huge so how do you get it you just go to</p>
<p>dr. Berg comm /a gift okay and some of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna say well wait a second how</p>
<p>am I gonna go on this course because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s through messenger and and some</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t use messenger</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s a very very convenient for us</p>
<p>to use messenger as a platform to put</p>
<p>this course and integrate everything so</p>
<p>just sign up with messenger and if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to continue after the course</p>
<p>just delete it but it&rsquo;s through</p>
<p>messenger but number one spread it</p>
<p>complete the course and send us your</p>
<p>success stories those are the three</p>
<p>things and there&rsquo;s some other things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do as well for those people</p>
<p>that share it the most I want to</p>
<p>personally thank you for that and so</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m gonna do is the top three</p>
<p>people that share it the most they get a</p>
<p>little prize what&rsquo;s that say I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even see if it you supposed to read it</p>
<p>silently and be really cool about it</p>
<p>like whoa would you write I read it what</p>
<p>it says is remember the camera because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just talking to YouTube people</p>
<p>right because over here okay good hey</p>
<p>good point</p>
<p>remember camera right the top three</p>
<p>people that share this link the most I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do a one-hour one-on-one video</p>
<p>consult with me so that&rsquo;s cool and then</p>
<p>for like a contest</p>
<p>it is a challenge a challenge yeah I</p>
<p>want to make a game out of it because we</p>
<p>really need to get this out there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s an amazing course and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help just for you to learn it we need</p>
<p>everyone to learn it I was I workout I</p>
<p>brought in my bike in the woods and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see you people all day long riding a</p>
<p>bike with a mask there&rsquo;s no one around</p>
<p>and honestly some people are still</p>
<p>really in fear and so if once to have</p>
<p>the information about the immune system</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna handle not only the</p>
<p>susceptibility to this situation but</p>
<p>also the fear factor will go way way</p>
<p>down because now you know and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually just as worse as the virus cuz</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re filled with stress and stress</p>
<p>yeah wrecks the adrenals in the immune</p>
<p>system and so you have a double whammy</p>
<p>and you could even be relatively fit but</p>
<p>be so terrified that now your body is</p>
<p>challenged and more susceptible because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just terrified so knowledge is</p>
<p>the answer knowledge is knowledge is how</p>
<p>you can gain control over any situation</p>
<p>and you have to understand your body and</p>
<p>the immune system</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>yea-ah right</p>
<p>let me tell you - but let me tell you</p>
<p>YouTube what you just said Steve was in</p>
<p>the hospital he saw and talked to a</p>
<p>nurse and there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>were having anxiety going into the</p>
<p>hospital and that alone required like</p>
<p>you know ventilators and treatment and</p>
<p>so you know even if they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>positive for some illness right any</p>
<p>illness right it could be the flavor of</p>
<p>the month illness or it could be any</p>
<p>illness the point is you know illness is</p>
<p>over here we you know we don&rsquo;t treat</p>
<p>illness cure illness it&rsquo;s nothing about</p>
<p>but but being sick or the fear of being</p>
<p>sick can freak people out and stress</p>
<p>their immune system and the answer to</p>
<p>that and the whole purpose of this</p>
<p>channel and why dr. Berg does what he</p>
<p>does all the time with these videos is</p>
<p>to educate you so you understand the</p>
<p>body and you understand how to build a</p>
<p>strong body and this should be for</p>
<p>yourself and for your kids and for</p>
<p>everyone in your family and all your</p>
<p>friends you got to build a healthy body</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re not gonna have to worry</p>
<p>about that and if something does come</p>
<p>along you&rsquo;re gonna understand but it is</p>
<p>your homework you have to do your</p>
<p>homework you have to watch the videos</p>
<p>take advantage of all the courses and</p>
<p>and you survive it better and you have a</p>
<p>healthier happier life the end exactly</p>
<p>hey Matthew you&rsquo;ve been waiting</p>
<p>patiently you&rsquo;re from Michigan are you</p>
<p>there hi</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>good question let me repeat it on</p>
<p>YouTube so Matthew had a question he</p>
<p>bought some pickles and he found an</p>
<p>ingredient called calcium chloride</p>
<p>should I avoid that is that bad no that</p>
<p>one actually is a is an okay one to</p>
<p>consume it&rsquo;s actually it&rsquo;s very benign</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to create a problem it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even it was used in various remedies and</p>
<p>as a kind of extra thing that they added</p>
<p>that has some benefit with arthritis so</p>
<p>I think I would not worry about it at</p>
<p>all I think it&rsquo;s an okay thing to take</p>
<p>in your pickles so out of all the</p>
<p>preservatives that would be the least of</p>
<p>your problems</p>
<p>but thanks for watching my videos all</p>
<p>right and then Jason you&rsquo;re from Santa</p>
<p>Barbara California you had a question</p>
<p>about something go ahead ask your</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>very very good question okay Jason had a</p>
<p>question for people on YouTube is will</p>
<p>MCT oil break your fast and guess what I</p>
<p>just released a video on that if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken I think either released it or I</p>
<p>did a video I&rsquo;m not sure now but yeah it</p>
<p>I would not worry about it if we take a</p>
<p>look at the definition of breaking a</p>
<p>fast we want to really look at does it</p>
<p>interfere with your ketosis</p>
<p>well MCT oil is is gonna generate a lot</p>
<p>of ketones so it&rsquo;s not going to drop</p>
<p>your ketosis will it potentially inhibit</p>
<p>your weight-loss not necessarily maybe</p>
<p>for some people that have a very slow</p>
<p>metabolism because you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>taking these ketones and that means less</p>
<p>ketones out of your own fat you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>tapping in your own fat but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing when you actually take MCT oil</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually stimulating it</p>
<p>increasing your metabolism by a certain</p>
<p>amount so I think that may offset it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a personal thing try it out and see</p>
<p>if it interferes but I would not worry</p>
<p>about taking not taking I&rsquo;m secure I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a good thing but the problem</p>
<p>is that it does create some digestive</p>
<p>issues for some people but just have a</p>
<p>small amount I think it&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>now especially for your brain all right</p>
<p>Karen okay well since YouTube is staring</p>
<p>at you you can know well we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>share this okay okay but I do have but I</p>
<p>do have former Turk on Facebook says hi</p>
<p>dr. Berg I&rsquo;ve been doing keto for two</p>
<p>years and a half two and a half years</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been great my blood my sugar level</p>
<p>and blood pressure became normal until</p>
<p>last week I&rsquo;ve eaten a lot of high carbs</p>
<p>for three days then I decided to go back</p>
<p>to and clean keto diet but after three</p>
<p>days of going back my blood my blood</p>
<p>pressure went up and wants to know why</p>
<p>that is why would your blood pressure go</p>
<p>up after returning well here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that you need to know when you go on</p>
<p>keto off keto a lot that can read</p>
<p>slow things down to the point where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to take longer and longer to get</p>
<p>into ketosis some people will take this</p>
<p>data that says it well it&rsquo;s three days</p>
<p>to get in ketosis and use that as their</p>
<p>standard when in reality for most people</p>
<p>it could take seven days or even up to</p>
<p>two weeks to get into a full ketosis so</p>
<p>you need to stick with it longer you</p>
<p>need to actually work harder to keep</p>
<p>your carbs down fast longer and then</p>
<p>also take the nutrition to speed things</p>
<p>up but blood pressure is a really is two</p>
<p>things vitamin D in potassium those are</p>
<p>the two things that I would look at and</p>
<p>recommend and work with your doctor on</p>
<p>using um Karen we had our first quiz</p>
<p>here guys okay so what&rsquo;s the best way to</p>
<p>prevent kidney stones if you&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>high high doses of vitamin D now I just</p>
<p>want let you know you would have to take</p>
<p>like two or three hundred thousand IU&rsquo;s</p>
<p>of vitamin D per month to have this</p>
<p>happen but some people just want to you</p>
<p>know be able to use with this question</p>
<p>like oh they heard Oh vitamin D is gonna</p>
<p>create Kitty stones and what can I do</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s something you can do to</p>
<p>really prevent kidney stones really</p>
<p>simple so let&rsquo;s see if you guys actually</p>
<p>know that answer okay so while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>answering that question from Susan</p>
<p>answers Susan you&rsquo;re from Oregon and you</p>
<p>had a question about something go ahead</p>
<p>right Wow great</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>okay all right so I want to just tell</p>
<p>people on YouTube that are listening so</p>
<p>Susan had a question she had a sty in</p>
<p>the eye okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s viral fYI that&rsquo;s a nice little</p>
<p>right now okay so for three months and</p>
<p>then she&rsquo;s been on keto for three years</p>
<p>and it really helped get rid of the sty</p>
<p>and then it came back but she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>change your diet what could that be well</p>
<p>another thing that will will increase</p>
<p>viral loads it&rsquo;s any type of stress so</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a stress involved and you may</p>
<p>even not even might not notice until you</p>
<p>reflect back and go was there something</p>
<p>that happened just before you could have</p>
<p>a perfect diet and have this little</p>
<p>stress event could be anything watching</p>
<p>the news whatever and then I am the</p>
<p>virus kind of comes out I worked with a</p>
<p>lady for years okay on and she had this</p>
<p>every month this virus kept coming out</p>
<p>and going back and out coming out of her</p>
<p>body and coming back in and it was</p>
<p>related to a chronic stress her diet was</p>
<p>perfect so stress will be the factor you</p>
<p>need to actually look at and deal with</p>
<p>out of anything so isolate the source of</p>
<p>the stress do whatever you can through</p>
<p>to reduce it and then the other thing is</p>
<p>like a real good remedy would be this</p>
<p>the colloidal silver you put a couple</p>
<p>drops right in the eye itself and that</p>
<p>seems to kind of get into around the sky</p>
<p>and help you put that bars back in</p>
<p>remission and then also take colloidal</p>
<p>silver underneath your tongue hold it</p>
<p>for like 30 seconds and then swallow it</p>
<p>thanks Susan all right okay and first of</p>
<p>all there&rsquo;s some people on Facebook who</p>
<p>are on YouTube I think there must have</p>
<p>been an original youtube link sent out</p>
<p>some people maybe we&rsquo;re trying to use</p>
<p>that but then because of technical</p>
<p>difficulties here dr. berg had to go</p>
<p>youtube live on his phone so it is on</p>
<p>youtube it&rsquo;s just not on maybe that</p>
<p>original link</p>
<p>Yaga</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re cartoon characters we look like</p>
<p>cartoons</p>
<p>okay there are your options all right</p>
<p>what do we have okay well I have to say</p>
<p>and here you be the face of YouTube</p>
<p>because um at least on Facebook</p>
<p>everybody on Facebook watches your</p>
<p>videos everybody&rsquo;s dead lemon juice</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar and of course there</p>
<p>were answers of k2 and some people are</p>
<p>like yeah I watched it last night it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lemon juice it&rsquo;s lemon juice it&rsquo;s lemon</p>
<p>juice vinegar actually it&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>more than that validate how right they</p>
<p>are for that you&rsquo;re actually very well</p>
<p>done on the and the answer on there</p>
<p>because um you&rsquo;re right the lemon juice</p>
<p>will bind with the Ox let&rsquo;s for sure but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s the quantity of fluid why</p>
<p>because people said that okay because a</p>
<p>kidney stone occurs when there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called a super saturation a highly</p>
<p>concentrated amount of urine so if you</p>
<p>keep the urine diluted to some degree</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna develop a stone it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost impossible to develop a stone so</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking at least 2 to 2.5 liters</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a lot of fluid so that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I would recommend and that way you can</p>
<p>take the high D high amounts of D and</p>
<p>not really be concerned um simple point</p>
<p>if you put the lemon juice in there now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really gonna be taken to the next</p>
<p>level okay okay I got I have about five</p>
<p>more um actually four more questions</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get to but go ahead oh I just</p>
<p>wanted to say not a saying we want</p>
<p>translation into Arabic of the videos</p>
<p>well we have we have an Arabic channel</p>
<p>yeah if you just go to dr. Berg calm I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry my youtube channel</p>
<p>so you mean you just go right to you -</p>
<p>yeah then one of the channels is Arabic</p>
<p>and you just click channels and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see it right there</p>
<p>yeah and now it may not be all because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s over 5,000 they do seven a week</p>
<p>they release videos they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>working hard and they have a lot of</p>
<p>subscribers ya have over a million</p>
<p>subscribers yeah they are really doing</p>
<p>great so if you speak Arabic different</p>
<p>I check out that channel okay um now you</p>
<p>were gonna ask a question or did you</p>
<p>want me to that question yes well I just</p>
<p>wanted to say Jane said that she made</p>
<p>six loaves of kedo bread</p>
<p>Wow she can&rsquo;t get enough of it and Jane</p>
<p>I am I invested in a good number of</p>
<p>cookbooks and I am searching for what I</p>
<p>consider the best keto bread I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need a lot of bread but every once in a</p>
<p>while you know it&rsquo;s nice to have maybe a</p>
<p>grilled cheese in tomato or something</p>
<p>like that</p>
<p>so if I find another recipe I&rsquo;ll put it</p>
<p>on but I agree with you that that that</p>
<p>boule that crusty boule the best I also</p>
<p>want to say to Betty who&rsquo;s from the</p>
<p>villages in Florida if you are the same</p>
<p>person who connected up before I gave</p>
<p>the villages person a challenge to</p>
<p>create Aikido Club in the villages and</p>
<p>maybe several keto clubs throughout the</p>
<p>villages so if you follow dr. Berg and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re up for it</p>
<p>get something started down there and let</p>
<p>me know because that is a place we want</p>
<p>people who have nice long healthy lives</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s it so one question here from</p>
<p>patty she says do you have any advice</p>
<p>for someone with no colons okay so well</p>
<p>hopefully you have part of your colon</p>
<p>because sometimes people say I have a</p>
<p>crime no cold and it could be like they</p>
<p>were resected like a portion of it but</p>
<p>if you have absolutely no :</p>
<p>your body will compensate a little bit</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s definitely gonna be a</p>
<p>situation with the fermentation of the</p>
<p>fiber and the friendly bacteria they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to live in the small</p>
<p>intestine so you&rsquo;re gonna have to cope</p>
<p>as well as you you can so what does that</p>
<p>mean it means that you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>take more nutrients that are broken down</p>
<p>into the smallest particles and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna like for example protein you have</p>
<p>to take instead of protein you have to</p>
<p>take amino acids not some protein powder</p>
<p>but actual amino acids and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good one we have to call keto aminos</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t eat no they would</p>
<p>but the problems are going to a harder</p>
<p>time to really fully get the benefit of</p>
<p>the food because they&rsquo;re limited with</p>
<p>the breakdown essential fatty acid it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re gonna have to take maybe</p>
<p>more I mean I like about your three</p>
<p>fatty acids maybe more vitamin D but</p>
<p>vitamin A and the trace minerals for</p>
<p>sure plant-based trace minerals that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you could have to do and then you</p>
<p>take some outside of vinegar with this</p>
<p>so your stomach could be acid take some</p>
<p>bio salts enzymes you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>just work harder at that and probably</p>
<p>take you know some probiotics but not</p>
<p>too many now would that be the same</p>
<p>recommendation for people with</p>
<p>inflammation of the colon like Crohn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or colitis or these um you you have a</p>
<p>good point there because if you have</p>
<p>inflammation you have malabsorption</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna absorb the nutrients</p>
<p>like you would so the best thing to do</p>
<p>for inflammation is do longer fast and</p>
<p>consume things that reduce inflammation</p>
<p>like butyrate for example glutamine</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other news these are amino acids</p>
<p>and then also butyrate is something that</p>
<p>is made by your microbes that helps</p>
<p>reduce inflammation but you may have a</p>
<p>problem if you do too much fiber so you</p>
<p>might have to do like carnivore for a</p>
<p>while to to help yourself so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little complex but I would watch my</p>
<p>video on that because I have a lot of</p>
<p>videos on that but if you do if you cut</p>
<p>out the carbs and you longer in a minute</p>
<p>fasting you should see your inflammation</p>
<p>your gut go away and then definitely</p>
<p>test for a food allergy as well I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time for a quiz okay so there are</p>
<p>very powerful final nutrients in certain</p>
<p>foods like anti-cancer anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>properties I mean it&rsquo;s amazing I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like hundreds and thousands of</p>
<p>these they&rsquo;re called phytonutrients and</p>
<p>one big benefit is they actually have</p>
<p>significant benefits of reducing your</p>
<p>risk for cancer so the question is what</p>
<p>is the best way to maintain those</p>
<p>phytonutrients in the food that you eat</p>
<p>what can you do to maintain the maximum</p>
<p>amount of phyto nutrient</p>
<p>in the food so that&rsquo;s the question there</p>
<p>you go</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s take a question from</p>
<p>Christy from Austin Texas are you there</p>
<p>hi what&rsquo;s your question hi</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>go ahead Christie Christie what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do is I&rsquo;m gonna answer the</p>
<p>question right now I&rsquo;m gonna also repeat</p>
<p>it for Facebook I&rsquo;m at YouTube so for</p>
<p>those of you that are patiently looking</p>
<p>at me right now</p>
<p>so Christie had a question about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best way to improve the immune</p>
<p>system especially for asthma is there a</p>
<p>natural antibiotic because I talked</p>
<p>about that last last week well just what</p>
<p>happens Christie you are in luck because</p>
<p>I just created an entire course that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get free if you sign up and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on how to bulletproof your immune</p>
<p>system in that course you&rsquo;re gonna learn</p>
<p>all about what you just asked and so</p>
<p>instead of telling you everything I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just gonna have you take the course now</p>
<p>how do you get the course for those of</p>
<p>you that are listening that just popped</p>
<p>on you guys need to go to dr. Burke comm</p>
<p>forward slash gift and then you&rsquo;ll sign</p>
<p>up to messenger and then take the course</p>
<p>three requirements for this free course</p>
<p>that is 21 lessons and there&rsquo;s questions</p>
<p>and we will grade it I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>personally great every single one you</p>
<p>know yeah I won&rsquo;t do that but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what first requirement is we want you to</p>
<p>share it with everyone but to be active</p>
<p>complete the course and three sent us</p>
<p>your success story but as far as asthma</p>
<p>goes you that one you need to take a lot</p>
<p>of vitamin D I&rsquo;m talking maybe up to</p>
<p>50,000 IU&rsquo;s but I think your problem</p>
<p>Krissy is stress you need to I think</p>
<p>doing the course is gonna reduce your</p>
<p>stress honestly but the point is that</p>
<p>you got to isolate exactly where that</p>
<p>stress is coming from I would not be</p>
<p>watching the news I would take long</p>
<p>walks get your attention off that hang</p>
<p>out with people that supports you and</p>
<p>just you got to handle that stress</p>
<p>because that will suppress your immune</p>
<p>system way more than any nutritional</p>
<p>deficiency will okay Christy let me know</p>
<p>what happens after you take this course</p>
<p>hey Steve when we put the link for the</p>
<p>course on the bottom yeah</p>
<p>okay great minds all right good</p>
<p>yeah no let&rsquo;s take a question no oh you</p>
<p>want to answer all we need to acquire</p>
<p>the answer to the question right okay go</p>
<p>ahead okay so most people said raw or</p>
<p>lightly cooked vegetables there were a</p>
<p>handful of answers of eating vegetables</p>
<p>mm-hmm and then there were just a</p>
<p>smaller handful of cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables okay but the vast majority of</p>
<p>people were saying raw or steamed</p>
<p>vegetables now you want to repeat the</p>
<p>question yeah the question was how do</p>
<p>you maintain and retain all those</p>
<p>amazing anti-cancer phytonutrients from</p>
<p>different foods I&rsquo;m talking investable</p>
<p>and more specifically cruciferous out of</p>
<p>all the phytonutrients studied that are</p>
<p>anti-cancer the the cruciferous have</p>
<p>been studied mostly and all of you guys</p>
<p>are correct because the best way to</p>
<p>retain it is to consume them raw for</p>
<p>sure but let&rsquo;s say you want to steam</p>
<p>them what you can do if you cook dr.</p>
<p>Berg com4 / gift when you cut your</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables cut them up then</p>
<p>slightly steamed them because when you</p>
<p>cut them or crush them it releases an</p>
<p>enzyme that allows the conversion to</p>
<p>take place into the phytonutrient that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really easy to absorb as compared to</p>
<p>just taking them whole and then steaming</p>
<p>or cooking you&rsquo;re not going to nearly</p>
<p>get the full benefit of the spot of</p>
<p>nutrients so cut him up like we did last</p>
<p>night coleslaw</p>
<p>yeah so we cut it up you wait for about</p>
<p>seven minutes then you eat it okay but</p>
<p>we had it wrong so we actually had a</p>
<p>double wham and we just say - wrong we</p>
<p>crunched him and we chopped them up but</p>
<p>those enzymes are the phytonutrients act</p>
<p>to do a lot of things for cancer they</p>
<p>cause a cancer cell to commit suicide</p>
<p>they deactivate things that cause cancer</p>
<p>they provide an anti-inflammatory effect</p>
<p>they are anti oxidant effect I mean the</p>
<p>list goes on and on and on they stop the</p>
<p>blood flow to cancer so you don&rsquo;t need a</p>
<p>lot of them but you need at least about</p>
<p>a half a cup to two cups four or five</p>
<p>times a week to really create a nice</p>
<p>effect so we should do a coleslaw recipe</p>
<p>oh yes or several call simonkal sauce so</p>
<p>easy well don&rsquo;t you agree that I have</p>
<p>the best recipe for that ah</p>
<p>you have a good recipe you chopped your</p>
<p>you chop your food into squares that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right and very different ingredient I</p>
<p>like the shred okay but it&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>same food and I think everyone should</p>
<p>always have coleslaw in their</p>
<p>refrigerator fresh coleslaw oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah because cabbage is is a very unique</p>
<p>vegetable downtown you can add to cross</p>
<p>value like you did you know all kinds of</p>
<p>vegetables oh yeah I had a kill in it</p>
<p>and some lemon but so we will do a</p>
<p>recipe on that but that&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>to do it just eat it raw and or chop it</p>
<p>up and then steam it a little bit but oh</p>
<p>if you cook it as a whole thing for ten</p>
<p>minutes like a lot of people will make</p>
<p>broccoli and they don&rsquo;t chop it up</p>
<p>enough and they cook it for 10 minutes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s gone there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no more final nutrients and so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;ll take the entire cauliflower</p>
<p>head and they&rsquo;ll broccoli or broccoli or</p>
<p>cauliflower and they take the whole</p>
<p>thing and they cook it for 10 minutes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more phytonutrients they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get the benefits of those</p>
<p>phytonutrients what if you&rsquo;re making a</p>
<p>cauliflower mash then you&rsquo;re you chopped</p>
<p>it up right you you mash it up and what</p>
<p>I what you do is you chop it up in small</p>
<p>chunks wait for seven minutes then cook</p>
<p>it mash it mm-hmm okay</p>
<p>little tip but an important tip slightly</p>
<p>different than what you might have</p>
<p>thought before okay the next question</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna roll right into the next</p>
<p>question cuz we have a lot of things</p>
<p>that we want to show you guys</p>
<p>desk coffee in any way interfere with</p>
<p>your ketosis and etapa G does it inhibit</p>
<p>your etaf Aegean ketosis you want</p>
<p>explain nitrogen etapa G is your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to recycle damaged proteins when</p>
<p>you have damaged proteins from whatever</p>
<p>I like just living on this planet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very toxic to the body to keep those in</p>
<p>the body so your body recycles it gets</p>
<p>rid of it and it puts it into new little</p>
<p>amino acids so it&rsquo;s an anti-aging thing</p>
<p>so does true or false now not sure or</p>
<p>false just this coffee increase ketosis</p>
<p>and etapa G yes or no let&rsquo;s see what</p>
<p>happens with that question</p>
<p>alright right there yes it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things to think about a lot of things</p>
<p>going on okay I have a question yes some</p>
<p>are on Facebook made a statement the</p>
<p>keto and I have causes acid reflux so</p>
<p>they got this information from somewhere</p>
<p>but so you address that and then also</p>
<p>excuse me what would you do if you had</p>
<p>acid reflux okay so if you do keto</p>
<p>correctly and all of a sudden you get</p>
<p>acid reflux</p>
<p>what happens that means that your you</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t have something either in</p>
<p>your stomach or your gallbladder to</p>
<p>handle this change and sometimes you</p>
<p>have to look at what was the big</p>
<p>increase do you are you starting a lot</p>
<p>of protein now that you didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>before well in that case you need</p>
<p>contain how to chloride or outside of</p>
<p>vinegar pills that should handle it</p>
<p>right there that usually will handle the</p>
<p>acid reflux but also it could be a lack</p>
<p>of gallbladder help from the bile</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have enough bile one</p>
<p>thing about kedo Karen is when you</p>
<p>increase your fats and especially too</p>
<p>fast you may not actually have enough</p>
<p>bile to digest those fats so it might</p>
<p>feel like some indigestion or backup or</p>
<p>bloating so you might want to cut down</p>
<p>the fat a little</p>
<p>and just eat the fat with that normally</p>
<p>comes with the protein and then maybe</p>
<p>take some bile salts purified bile salts</p>
<p>and that way that problem will go away</p>
<p>okay all right so tell you what yeah let</p>
<p>me know when those answers are coming</p>
<p>through I&rsquo;m gonna go to Kathleen from</p>
<p>San Antonio Texas hey that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I went to my on-the-job</p>
<p>training in the Army for it</p>
<p>Fort Sam Houston Texas the Country Club</p>
<p>of the army and I lived in Gonzales</p>
<p>Texas</p>
<p>great Kathleen what was your question</p>
<p>yeah yeah</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay good good questions wouldn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t hurt yeah that wouldn&rsquo;t hurt</p>
<p>Kathleen but let me just repeat your</p>
<p>question for face no YouTube so Kathleen</p>
<p>had a question a very interesting</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>start Aikido it&rsquo;s not perfect a little</p>
<p>dirty Kido her cholesterol gone gone up</p>
<p>but also her LDL went up as well over</p>
<p>200 and she&rsquo;s a big concern she&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be doing some type of surgical</p>
<p>procedure involving I think you said</p>
<p>dancers pre-cancer cells of the cervix</p>
<p>and what should she be doing right now</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk to this take the cholesterol</p>
<p>question first we took your cholesterol</p>
<p>and fascinating because you had she had</p>
<p>very high LDL and you&rsquo;re like oh my gosh</p>
<p>is that the bad cholesterol but we did</p>
<p>an advanced lipid profile testing so</p>
<p>which measures the quality of</p>
<p>cholesterol and the combination of</p>
<p>everything and what we found was</p>
<p>something very fascinating with your</p>
<p>cholesterol we had very high good LDL</p>
<p>now LDL is supposed to be bad so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two types of LDL there&rsquo;s a small dense</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the large buoyant that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t create any type of bad thing for</p>
<p>your body at all</p>
<p>so women you cut down your carbs and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to that Kathleen for a</p>
<p>second</p>
<p>your your LDL may go up but it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the big kind that doesn&rsquo;t do any</p>
<p>damage to your arteries because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating more fat and it&rsquo;s flowing through</p>
<p>your bloodstream so I would not worry</p>
<p>about that if you have high LDL and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the large buoyant it&rsquo;s but I think</p>
<p>you need to do an advanced lipid profile</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find out but if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>dirty Aikido and you&rsquo;re sliding these</p>
<p>carbs the worst thing you can do is do a</p>
<p>high fat and a high carb diet</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying doing high carb but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to combine the carbs</p>
<p>especially sugar with fat or cholesterol</p>
<p>because that that could create a problem</p>
<p>all these my studies that show all these</p>
<p>problems that they say they&rsquo;re on a</p>
<p>high-fat diet</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on also on a high carb diet so</p>
<p>the definition Aikido is low carb so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the key so as far as this</p>
<p>abnormal perhaps they&rsquo;ll pre-pre cancer</p>
<p>cell if you&rsquo;re dealing with the cervix</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s going to be viral related a</p>
<p>human papillomavirus I did a video on</p>
<p>that you should watch that video on HPV</p>
<p>and the remedies that I recommend and</p>
<p>get on that immediately because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the number one trigger to cervical</p>
<p>cancer is that virus so there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>sorts of natural things you can do but</p>
<p>if you have abnormal cells first of all</p>
<p>you need to do the immune course number</p>
<p>one number two you need to bring down</p>
<p>your carbs very very low start doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting very periodically</p>
<p>and do the healthy version of keto that</p>
<p>I talked about immediately because I</p>
<p>think you could do a lot of good if you</p>
<p>start now the other thing is to start</p>
<p>consuming a lot of cruciferous food and</p>
<p>then watch the video that I did with an</p>
<p>ell gentleman that had a stage 4 cancer</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making any claims but just take</p>
<p>some tips that he recommends which is</p>
<p>based on common sense and good logic ok</p>
<p>all right Karen what do we have as far</p>
<p>as a the answer to the question about</p>
<p>coffee and etapa Gian right so repeat</p>
<p>the exact question because the answers</p>
<p>okay so does coffee help you in increase</p>
<p>ketosis in etapa G so there was a good</p>
<p>combination of yes and no straight</p>
<p>answer and then there were a few that</p>
<p>said it depends on the beans mm-hmm but</p>
<p>yes and nurse if I were to guess because</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t count I would say maybe a few</p>
<p>more yeses okay so the answer is yes</p>
<p>coffee actually does enhance etaf adji</p>
<p>and it does not interfere with ketosis</p>
<p>unless you add some sugar to it so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s is interesting because you would</p>
<p>think oh my gosh I&rsquo;m drinking something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna make it worse but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these called polyphenols in the coffee</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a vital nutrient that can help</p>
<p>increase your toffee g if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>overdo it because all the</p>
<p>caffeine will keep you from sleeping and</p>
<p>that will prevent your toffee gee so you</p>
<p>want to just do a small amount in the</p>
<p>morning and it could help you with your</p>
<p>toffee gee interesting an esophageal for</p>
<p>anti-aging also anti-cancer inflammation</p>
<p>collagen it&rsquo;s just really really</p>
<p>important okay so you have two more</p>
<p>questions right yes 12 minutes</p>
<p>okay so jugglers keep that in mind okay</p>
<p>yeah so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s first go to Connie</p>
<p>from Boston</p>
<p>are you there Connie hi</p>
<p>Wow great</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>well other than the Boston cream pie and</p>
<p>the Boston baked beans and the boss no I</p>
<p>think what I would do is I would I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming you&rsquo;re doing clean healthy</p>
<p>Quito I&rsquo;m assuming that okay but there</p>
<p>are some things that you can adjust to</p>
<p>reduce inflammation your gut and adjust</p>
<p>the fiber you may need to cut that way</p>
<p>down or you may need to increase it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually gonna cut to cut it down on</p>
<p>the neck that can create a lot of GI</p>
<p>issues especially when you in Quito and</p>
<p>following the program that I recommend</p>
<p>with you know mass amounts of greens</p>
<p>which you might not be able to digest so</p>
<p>I would look at that I would also avoid</p>
<p>two of the things that caused a lot of</p>
<p>GI problems in Quito number one is all</p>
<p>those sugar alcohols and all the keto</p>
<p>treats and the Quito bombs and all that</p>
<p>just next all those right now get rid of</p>
<p>them and then also MCT oil so you want</p>
<p>to avoid that the bulletproof coffee and</p>
<p>I think those three things should help</p>
<p>you I did a video on bloating and keto</p>
<p>you can watch that for more data but I</p>
<p>think Boston is a really great city so</p>
<p>we love Boston yes we do thanks Connie</p>
<p>all right you have a question or should</p>
<p>I go right to go for it all right so the</p>
<p>quiz guys there is actually any common</p>
<p>ingredient that is supposedly keto</p>
<p>friendly okay it&rsquo;s not Keitel unfriendly</p>
<p>that would literally match the damage</p>
<p>that sugar does to insulin resistance</p>
<p>and diabetes</p>
<p>so what other ingredient besides sugar</p>
<p>creates a similar effect to sugar and</p>
<p>really could mess with your ability to</p>
<p>stay in ketosis it&rsquo;s kind of a category</p>
<p>of sweetener no I can&rsquo;t give it away</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a sweet okay it&rsquo;s a category of</p>
<p>food okay so let&rsquo;s see what people say</p>
<p>ask the question it&rsquo;s a little more</p>
<p>involved there&rsquo;s we know that sugar and</p>
<p>refined grains destroy your body and</p>
<p>that it causes insulin resistance right</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something else that will do</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>sending a common category of ingredients</p>
<p>that will also do it and you said it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s marketed or thought to be keto</p>
<p>friendly it&rsquo;s not keto unfriendly let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just put it that way</p>
<p>according to you&rsquo;ll see okay okay so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what people come up and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking cap on</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m trying to get people to getting</p>
<p>what ingredients information general</p>
<p>category of ingredients okay and while</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about that let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>hump HMDA in Oregon oh I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>hi</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and this happened after giving birth</p>
<p>right okay so this is what you need to</p>
<p>do and for those people that are on</p>
<p>YouTube watching let me just explain so</p>
<p>this lady started to do well she did</p>
<p>actually she gave birth and all of a</p>
<p>sudden she started eating hot flashes</p>
<p>having pain all these issues and her</p>
<p>doctor told her hey listen there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>nutritional deficiency so we&rsquo;re good to</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like what can she do so this is</p>
<p>what you need to do I&rsquo;ll guarantee you</p>
<p>do have nutritional deficiencies because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna pick them up through</p>
<p>the blood anyway even if they did a test</p>
<p>because a lot of these nutrients are</p>
<p>intracellular especially the minerals</p>
<p>especially potassium and there&rsquo;s special</p>
<p>tests that you have to do for other</p>
<p>things as well the most likely thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re deficient in a basin what</p>
<p>you told me would be vitamin D and</p>
<p>vitamin E and both of those will can</p>
<p>help hot flashes immediately so I would</p>
<p>watch my videos on what to eat if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pregnant what to eat if you just gave it</p>
<p>you know just delivered because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a whole series of real key nutrients</p>
<p>that are going to be essential hopefully</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breastfeeding and that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help but you might need more B vitamins</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>the fat soluble vitamins more than</p>
<p>anything the other thing you could do</p>
<p>for hot flashes which which would make</p>
<p>sense is to take iodine like in seek</p>
<p>help because that will help balance your</p>
<p>estrogen and carrying a baby for nine</p>
<p>months or an and then delivering puts a</p>
<p>lot of stress on your nutrient reserves</p>
<p>and so you probably your your increase</p>
<p>your demand is a lot higher so you need</p>
<p>to start taking more of those things so</p>
<p>watch those videos on that thanks for</p>
<p>your question all right okay ask the</p>
<p>question again and then well okay so</p>
<p>what ingredient category of ingredients</p>
<p>would be comparable to sugar and refined</p>
<p>grains as far as damaging to your weight</p>
<p>your insulin diabetes your body overall</p>
<p>mainly specifically insulin resistance</p>
<p>okay so that maybe that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>completely keep changing the questions</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the question I don&rsquo;t know but it</p>
<p>was really all over the map we had a lot</p>
<p>of people say fructose well that&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>approve dose is keto unfriendly guys so</p>
<p>just FYI right well I&rsquo;m just saying okay</p>
<p>we had a lot of things and there were</p>
<p>some obvious wrong answers like wheat</p>
<p>and that kind of thing but there was a</p>
<p>stevia too much protein a lot of people</p>
<p>said too much protein some cheese</p>
<p>coconut sugar GMOs multi dextran a</p>
<p>couple of people said molted extra maybe</p>
<p>three and a couple of people said canola</p>
<p>oils and not bad oils and now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pointing at the one answer one person</p>
<p>said which is I&rsquo;m not gonna say this</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll be okay so I&rsquo;m gonna tell</p>
<p>you right now what it is in a general</p>
<p>category it&rsquo;s the vegetable oils right</p>
<p>and which are based to the category</p>
<p>would be vegetable oils and it includes</p>
<p>a lot of different oils and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really they&rsquo;re not really vegetables</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s seed oils the grain oils one</p>
<p>person did say okay they were correct so</p>
<p>the thing is that these seed oils these</p>
<p>are called unsaturated fatty acids are</p>
<p>very inflammatory their I animal</p>
<p>maintenance omega-6 fatty acids which is</p>
<p>different than omega-3 so that would be</p>
<p>the soy the corn oil the canola the</p>
<p>cottonseed and even and I talked about</p>
<p>the GMOs right but if we don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about GMOs we&rsquo;re still talking about the</p>
<p>safflower and the sunflower even the</p>
<p>peanut oil if you do too much of those</p>
<p>that could be an issue for your as long</p>
<p>as you balance them out with your</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids or fish oils and</p>
<p>that type of thing you&rsquo;re good but most</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t do that their liver will</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not gonna cook with cod liver</p>
<p>oil no but you can use coconut oil you</p>
<p>can use butter you can use palm oil</p>
<p>you know friendly so what about organic</p>
<p>canola I still won&rsquo;t do it because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>high in omega-6 the omega-6 fatty oils</p>
<p>are highly inflammatory which which</p>
<p>creates insulin resistance in fact take</p>
<p>a look at this camera we take a look at</p>
<p>the trends from 1970 now people just</p>
<p>automatically will say sugar and I used</p>
<p>to say this well like with this massive</p>
<p>increase in sugar and yes we have but</p>
<p>guess what what went way higher than</p>
<p>sugar as far as the amount the</p>
<p>difference of back then versus now the</p>
<p>quantity of the quantity sumption and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 400% spike which is actually</p>
<p>more than sugar and so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>unsaturated asked fatty acids which is</p>
<p>basically the vegetable oils that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that really significantly went up</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t talk about it often but</p>
<p>think about where this is located it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in your salad dressing it&rsquo;s in the food</p>
<p>that you eat the number one actual food</p>
<p>that has our rural high in omega-6 is</p>
<p>actually chicken so</p>
<p>we back in 1970s and 80s what we did is</p>
<p>we said saturated fat is bad start</p>
<p>consuming unsaturated fat yes and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the problem is and so I&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>you started with misinformation and then</p>
<p>it was being pumped into all the food</p>
<p>products and so now so many products</p>
<p>have that in it I I think that a lot of</p>
<p>the benefits from Kido in addition to</p>
<p>the low carb is the elimination of these</p>
<p>oils as well I think that creates huge</p>
<p>benefits on reducing inflammation</p>
<p>helping your incident be balanced and</p>
<p>losing weight so let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not losing weight and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still doing all these omega-6 oils and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know it</p>
<p>that could be why yeah and that also</p>
<p>includes I&rsquo;m going to tell you other</p>
<p>foods that omega-6 almond almonds almond</p>
<p>flour if you&rsquo;re doing way too much it</p>
<p>could be more influential now I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying don&rsquo;t do it I&rsquo;m just saying have</p>
<p>some of it but balance out with balance</p>
<p>it out with your omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>omega-3 are the anti-inflammatory the</p>
<p>fish oil is the column oil the actual</p>
<p>fish they&rsquo;re consuming you&rsquo;re maybe</p>
<p>threes you&rsquo;re eating fish you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>your cod liver yes you can have an</p>
<p>occasional thing with almond there is a</p>
<p>type of omega-3 fatty acid it&rsquo;s off in</p>
<p>almonds it&rsquo;s like a precursor but an</p>
<p>almond I mean it&rsquo;s not almonds walnuts</p>
<p>now Karen there&rsquo;s a quiz for you who</p>
<p>makes the best salmon on the planet</p>
<p>earth go ahead tell him doctor Meghan</p>
<p>thank you very much thank you very much</p>
<p>yeah I know you didn&rsquo;t see that one</p>
<p>coming did you no no I have one more</p>
<p>quiz and I&rsquo;ll take a question well I</p>
<p>think you should hold that to next week</p>
<p>and take the question okay yeah dan</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from New Jersey you had a</p>
<p>question go ahead hi</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>well let me let me give you some tips on</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m gonna give you some tips on</p>
<p>your your hair loss and just to repeat</p>
<p>YouTube this gal had just started keto</p>
<p>and then she lost her period ton of</p>
<p>weight she lost ton of weight she lost</p>
<p>her period and she&rsquo;s complaining about</p>
<p>that what he surprised and then she also</p>
<p>lost her hair or she&rsquo;s losing hair she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t lose all over here and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay what am I gonna do to get these</p>
<p>benefits back and there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things with hair that you want to make</p>
<p>sure and I&rsquo;m I don&rsquo;t know Dan if you did</p>
<p>this or not but when you do keto a lot</p>
<p>of times if you don&rsquo;t do certain types</p>
<p>of foods you&rsquo;re going to be missing the</p>
<p>the trace minerals especially zinc very</p>
<p>very important so you might want to</p>
<p>start having do keto with some oysters</p>
<p>or shellfish that will help you a lot</p>
<p>the other thing and it&rsquo;s not the carbs</p>
<p>you want to make sure that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>digesting protein with a good stomach</p>
<p>acids that&rsquo;s another point that you</p>
<p>might be having a problem with B</p>
<p>vitamins are needed nutritional yeast in</p>
<p>higher amounts and the last thing is</p>
<p>like the I think you might be</p>
<p>overtraining because you said you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exercising hardcore just make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting the sleep that you need I</p>
<p>would take one thing at a time and I</p>
<p>would maybe cut your workouts down to</p>
<p>maybe twice a week let yourself really</p>
<p>recover get a little more sleep and see</p>
<p>if that doesn&rsquo;t handle it because if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not sleeping and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>overtraining and you&rsquo;re more stressed</p>
<p>that alone will increase cortisol and</p>
<p>that can mess with your hair and</p>
<p>increase the antigens which you can lose</p>
<p>your hair so I would look at that and I</p>
<p>think that should help you and let us</p>
<p>know next week if that works</p>
<p>alright keto summit coming up at the end</p>
<p>of August okay and you know what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a link you need to take this</p>
<p>immune course and share it with everyone</p>
<p>you know on how to a bulletproof your</p>
<p>your immune system what I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>Karen is for the people that share it</p>
<p>the most of top three people they&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>consult one-on-one with them for an hour</p>
<p>a virtual one and anything they want to</p>
<p>talk about and then the other thing is</p>
<p>that for the top 100 people that share</p>
<p>this with the most people I&rsquo;m gonna do a</p>
<p>special webinar with that group in</p>
<p>addition I&rsquo;m gonna give them a free</p>
<p>ticket to the virtual summit in August</p>
<p>so at the end of August so all I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to do is motivate people to</p>
<p>spread it because the more people that</p>
<p>do this the better off everyone&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be it&rsquo;s a free course it&rsquo;s free course</p>
<p>free but if you want to pay for it you</p>
<p>can but it&rsquo;s very valuable to check it</p>
<p>out there&rsquo;s a link down below it&rsquo;s dr.</p>
<p>Burt comport slash gift it&rsquo;s my gift to</p>
<p>you and in that note have a wonderful</p>
