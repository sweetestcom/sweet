    <p>Two days ago. Oh, here we go. In the piazzetta, I got into a</p>
<p>fight. You got into a fight. I got into a fight. Like a</p>
<p>physical altercation. The physical altercation. Really?</p>
<p>This chick shows up wearing a white wife beater talking all</p>
<p>kinds of **** And I said, listen, lady, you zip it. And</p>
<p>she just kept jawing and jawing and here she is again. She&rsquo;s</p>
<p>back for more. And so, I was like, listen, now, have you</p>
<p>ever seen? Ah, there she is. Have you ever seen a one, a</p>
<p>onesie wife beater? Look at that little sweetie. Aw. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just gonna rub at you. And you just sit there. And then you</p>
<p>just sit there. And then look. There&rsquo;s your cold open</p>
<p>everybody. That&rsquo;s the good stuff right there. Say hi to</p>
<p>everybody. I know I&rsquo;m not a beagle. I know I&rsquo;m not a beagle</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m even better. I have my own thoughts. Sax, what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing here is called affection between a parent and a child.</p>
<p>Just let me know when it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the worst human being in the world. I don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>watch Chamath boost his Q rating by using his kids as</p>
<p>profs, okay? Oh, Freeberg, where&rsquo;s your puppy that you</p>
<p>saved from being tortured with Kim Kardashian&rsquo;s lip gloss?</p>
<p>Nick, we gotta get this guy in cuz he hasn&rsquo;t been in the show</p>
<p>in a while. There he is. There he is. Oh, Monty. Oh, your</p>
<p>belly rub. Get the props out of the shot.</p>
<p>Rain Man David Sax.</p>
<p>We open sources to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. Love you guys. Queen of Quinoa. Sax, what&rsquo;s up with</p>
<p>J.D. Vance in Ohio? Is he gonna pull this thing off or is he</p>
<p>getting beat up? I read an article about him getting beat</p>
<p>up with the Peter Thiel connection being he got</p>
<p>physically beat up. No, no, no. Like in the post. No, no, no,</p>
<p>no, no. No, I think J.D. should win. He&rsquo;s gonna win, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. And what about Blake Masters? These are</p>
<p>the two guys that TL is backing. Should we start the</p>
<p>show? We kinda did. Yeah. Can I just ask you a question? If any</p>
<p>of us entered porn, wouldn&rsquo;t one of our names be Blake</p>
<p>Masters? Like, it&rsquo;s just, wouldn&rsquo;t it be on the list?</p>
<p>Like, doesn&rsquo;t it sound like a great, isn&rsquo;t it a great name</p>
<p>for porn? It&rsquo;s a great name, Blake Masters. It&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>name. And J.D. Steele. I&rsquo;m sorry, Vance. Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>Explain what&rsquo;s going on with this mentoring candidate. Would</p>
<p>you, would you accuse him of without any evidence? I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>accusing anybody of anything. I&rsquo;m just saying, tell us about</p>
<p>your mentoring candidates. Go ahead. Well, so J.D.&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>won the primaries and I expect he will win. I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be, I think, a red wave in November and Ohio is a pretty</p>
<p>red state these days. Blake still has to win the primary in</p>
<p>Arizona. It&rsquo;s a little bit more of a toss up, but I think he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do well. All right. Well, I had a follow up question, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not allowed to mention the T word, so let&rsquo;s just get started.</p>
<p>Why is it such a big deal that like Peter supports candidates?</p>
<p>You got all these like crazy left-wing radicals. No, no, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s interesting. Soros gives unlimited amounts of</p>
<p>money to, you know, crazy progressives like Gascon in LA</p>
<p>and a zillion others. I mean, why is it such an obsession</p>
<p>that we have to focus on who Peter supports? No, no, I just</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s fascinating that he has articulated his rationale</p>
<p>for supporting these candidates and his objective for, you</p>
<p>know, changing government in a way that he thinks would</p>
<p>benefit the country. And Peter&rsquo;s been generally right. What is</p>
<p>the thesis, Rayburg? I think part of if you watch his speech</p>
<p>from the RNC during the last Trump cycle, I think he did a</p>
<p>good job kind of articulating that there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>inefficiencies in government and there&rsquo;s a lot of call it</p>
<p>accumulated fat. And we need someone to go in and we need</p>
<p>people to go in and really cut this up because so much of</p>
<p>politics is driven by what else I&rsquo;m going to give you, not</p>
<p>about what I&rsquo;m going to fix that&rsquo;s already being spent in an</p>
<p>inefficient way. And as a result, we see debt climb, we</p>
<p>see taxes climb, we see efficiency continue to decline</p>
<p>of every dollar invested by the government. And I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really important thesis to see someone actually try and</p>
<p>execute against because very few people are in the position</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s in to actually be able to like make that sort of</p>
<p>statement. Everyone wants something more from their</p>
<p>government versus trying to fix the government. I think his</p>
<p>views are more extreme than that. I think his views are more</p>
<p>that orthodoxy is ruining in America. And so you need forms</p>
<p>of heterodoxy to basically reset the status quo. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he believes more than what you just said. I think</p>
<p>that you need a wholesale reset. And in order to have a</p>
<p>wholesale reset, you need to have these very disruptive</p>
<p>candidates that basically start to change the norms. I mean, if</p>
<p>you think about what Trump did in one election cycle, is he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely sucked an entire cohort of people, Hispanics,</p>
<p>and, you know, moderates, and now, you know, a lot of</p>
<p>immigrants towards the right, because the Democrats have</p>
<p>vacated all of that space in having this massive Trump</p>
<p>derangement syndrome and tacking extremely to the left. And even</p>
<p>if Peter, we&rsquo;ll never know believed in Trump or didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe in Trump, it didn&rsquo;t matter. But the process of him</p>
<p>getting that candidate elected over the long arc of history may</p>
<p>actually serve to pull America back to the center. Pretty good</p>
<p>outcome.</p>
<p>Yeah. And look at the reason why I support JD and Blake, for</p>
<p>that matter, is they are, they represent this more populist</p>
<p>working class wing of the Republican Party, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dragging the Republican Party in a more working class</p>
<p>direction. I think that&rsquo;s the future of the party. I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the opportunity for the party to Chamas point, the</p>
<p>Democrats have seeded all the sort of this working class</p>
<p>territory by becoming this elite, progressive party. And</p>
<p>the face of the party right now, the Democratic Party is Paul</p>
<p>Pelosi. You know, let&rsquo;s talk about this. It&rsquo;s blatant and out</p>
<p>in the open. He&rsquo;s trading on chip stocks, like Nvidia and</p>
<p>Intel, and so forth. Like the week before, the House is going</p>
<p>to vote on a $52 billion subsidy for chip.</p>
<p>No, no, no, be more precise the week before his wife decides</p>
<p>when critical legislation goes to the floor of the House to be</p>
<p>voted upon. So you have the Speaker of the House, who&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>third most important person in government, introducing</p>
<p>legislation on her timetable. Her husband trades in those</p>
<p>specific equities days, and maybe even the same day. So</p>
<p>gross of that. They make three times her annual salary just in</p>
<p>one day. And then she and her husband decide to then fly, not</p>
<p>asked by the United States government or the State</p>
<p>Department to Taiwan to then talk about God knows what, which</p>
<p>would have created an international uproar. The Biden</p>
<p>administration and Tony Blinken had to basically call her and</p>
<p>say, Stand down. You should not go. We are not asking you to go.</p>
<p>It is not on the United States agenda for you to go. And all</p>
<p>that would have happened is an entire process and loop where</p>
<p>she controls the legislative agenda. Her husband controls</p>
<p>their private stock account, and he traffic&rsquo;s in the names.</p>
<p>And then they go to Taiwan to whip up the Fuhrer, which would</p>
<p>have actually positively impacted those same names even</p>
<p>more. It&rsquo;s inexcusable that kind of behavior. I mean, after</p>
<p>40 years, just she is so past the line, and she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize it. And by the way, sorry, let me just wait. Hold</p>
<p>on. And then on top of that, Jason, the mainstream media</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say shit. Now, by the way, I&rsquo;m not a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a complete goofball. But if Trump had tried</p>
<p>to pull this stuff in 2016, or 2017, or 2018, could you</p>
<p>imagine how much media coverage there would be? And today, how</p>
<p>much of that is covered by the mainstream media? Zero? Was it</p>
<p>mentioned on MSNBC? Nope. Was it mentioned in any of the press?</p>
<p>Nope. Let me just set the stage so people don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about. So on Tuesday, the Senate advanced a slim down</p>
<p>version of the original chips bill, if you don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>that is. It&rsquo;s basically a bill that&rsquo;s going to provide $52</p>
<p>billion in subsidies to move chip manufacturing here to the</p>
<p>United States, something we really need to do. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bipartisan bill, everybody kind of agrees on this. But this is</p>
<p>been kind of stuck in committee for a little bit. It comes a</p>
<p>year after the Senate first approved the $250 billion bill</p>
<p>to reinforce US chipmaking to compete with China.</p>
<p>The reason why this is strategically important is</p>
<p>because we have a huge chip dependency on Taiwan, which is</p>
<p>from China. So if chips are the new oil, you know, Taiwan is the</p>
<p>new Middle East or the new Persian Gulf. And it is a very</p>
<p>dangerous situation for us to be completely dependent on Taiwan.</p>
<p>Well, not completely, but like for over half our chips. So</p>
<p>onshoring, advanced chip manufacturing makes sense. But I</p>
<p>think this is an example of how you start with a legitimate</p>
<p>objective in Washington. And very rapidly, it turns into</p>
<p>corporate welfare and graft by politicians. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, just because we need to answer manufacturing</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that you give Intel and Nvidia giant handouts.</p>
<p>And then you got Paul Pelosi making millions trading and</p>
<p>video options. Yeah, it&rsquo;s something that is</p>
<p>sex to support on shoring of semiconductor manufacturing,</p>
<p>who would you give the money to? And how would it be kind of</p>
<p>dulled out? What would the terms of it be?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that you just give these companies money. I mean,</p>
<p>I think maybe what you do is you give them tax breaks or</p>
<p>various kinds of breaks. But I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>capital, they need capital to support that investment. Because</p>
<p>you know, if you look at the kind of ROIC on these companies,</p>
<p>I would I haven&rsquo;t looked, but I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>high teens or something mid to high teens. And they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be able to invest in some newfangled, you know, fab</p>
<p>project that may or may not actually have customers at the</p>
<p>end of the day, their board would never approve that on</p>
<p>an independent basis. They need to find ROIC, Friedberg,</p>
<p>return on invested capital. So if you&rsquo;re a big industrial</p>
<p>business, you know, one of the key metrics that your</p>
<p>shareholders look at is the the ultimate kind of profit,</p>
<p>profits that are generated from a big investment, you might</p>
<p>make. And so you know, you kind of look at that over time,</p>
<p>you look at the invested money over time, and the cash and</p>
<p>return over time, you come up with this metric. And so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>key metric for particularly capital intensive businesses.</p>
<p>And so a business like Intel or Nvidia, I would imagine is</p>
<p>going to have a pretty tough time selling their board on some</p>
<p>speculative on shoring fab project, that there really does</p>
<p>need to be capital and acceleration of capital.</p>
<p>Who feeds you this bullshit propaganda, Intel, in 2020,</p>
<p>approved a share purchase plan, where these guys had a hold of</p>
<p>$110 billion, and have spent all of it, except for 7.2 billion,</p>
<p>they have 6 billion left on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>I get it, but they&rsquo;re not going to put that money at risk,</p>
<p>right? Like, like, tomorrow, imagine you&rsquo;re on the board of</p>
<p>Intel. And they&rsquo;re like, hey, we want government. Okay, so</p>
<p>basically, hold on. But I make a ton of money. Yeah, this is</p>
<p>where it all comes from, right? I make a ton of money. I have no</p>
<p>better ideas of how to do it, including theoretically building</p>
<p>a chip factory. So I&rsquo;m going to go to the government for a</p>
<p>handout. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m going to take all the money that I had,</p>
<p>which I could have used to fund this thing. And I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>give it away to people who I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do with it. I would reframe it, I would say that the government</p>
<p>wants to see our industry onshore semiconductor</p>
<p>manufacturing, and they are going to the companies, not the</p>
<p>companies going to the government, they&rsquo;re saying, we</p>
<p>want you to onshore semiconductor manufacturing, do</p>
<p>that for us. Now, like in World War Two, we went to the</p>
<p>automobile manufacturers and said, the government said, we</p>
<p>want you to make airplanes, here&rsquo;s a bunch of money make</p>
<p>airplanes. And that&rsquo;s the question is, but who does that</p>
<p>who else would you give that money to besides the two best</p>
<p>chip makers in the world? David&rsquo;s right. If you just give</p>
<p>a capex subsidy, that&rsquo;s a one time effect that helps you in a</p>
<p>moment, it doesn&rsquo;t help your business, any reasonable</p>
<p>investor who can actually use a simple calculator sees through</p>
<p>that nonsense. So what David&rsquo;s right is if you had given them</p>
<p>sustained tax breaks, for being able to build a business line</p>
<p>that then supplies things for the duration, you know, 10s of</p>
<p>years, you&rsquo;re absolutely right, investors would lot it, it would</p>
<p>make a ton of sense, they would be over earning over a long</p>
<p>enough period of time where people would have to bake that</p>
<p>into their cash flow estimates, where when you discounted it</p>
<p>back, it would make the enterprise of Intel and Nvidia</p>
<p>worth more. And then people would then want to own that</p>
<p>stock more. Giving a capex subsidy is a meaningless way in</p>
<p>which you basically hand out good money to organizations who</p>
<p>have otherwise misallocated the money that they&rsquo;ve already had.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a much simpler solution to sexist point of like,</p>
<p>how do you do this and giving free money is not the way to do</p>
<p>it. The best way to do is to give an incredibly low interest</p>
<p>rate loan, like a 3040 50 year loan, that maybe was has some</p>
<p>warrants in it, just like a, you know, a Silicon Valley Bank or a</p>
<p>co America might give in a venture debt loan, where the</p>
<p>government actually could make money from this. And then you</p>
<p>incent them with something that is just too good not to take a</p>
<p>50 year loan of $5 billion to build factories, you have to use</p>
<p>it for that. So it&rsquo;s use it or lose it. And then you slowly pay</p>
<p>the government back. And then maybe we get some warrants in</p>
<p>Intel or whoever we give the money to. This is something that</p>
<p>Obama did with Solyndra Solyndra, which didn&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>but he also did it with Tesla. And Tesla paid all that money</p>
<p>back early. So these loans that the Department of Energy did</p>
<p>really did. And you got to give Barack Obama a lot of credit for</p>
<p>this. It really did help drive even though it wasn&rsquo;t perfect,</p>
<p>by the way, when did drive a lot of AV adoption, it did</p>
<p>really help Tesla become the company it is today.</p>
<p>Sorry, let me just respond. Because, you know, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how much we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve gone through the details of the bill.</p>
<p>But there are several components to this bill, including and I</p>
<p>just want to highlight if I&rsquo;m on the board of Intel, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to make a $10 billion fab investment. Because, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there may or may not be, you know, profits down the road</p>
<p>to justify that size of an investment. So if the</p>
<p>government comes along and says we will support we will cover</p>
<p>x percent of that investment, I can take on more risk. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>more willing to make that investment. And theoretically, I</p>
<p>can afford to pay people a higher wage or a higher salary</p>
<p>because I now have more capital freed up to support to do that.</p>
<p>And so there is an effect that that arises by having the</p>
<p>government come in, put some money into these projects</p>
<p>accelerate their outcomes. And it gives the business more</p>
<p>freedom. Should it be freeberg free money or in the form of a</p>
<p>loan? So what should the financial device be? I think is</p>
<p>the question that us sacks if I&rsquo;m interpreting correct. Yeah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that the loan because the loan doesn&rsquo;t resolve</p>
<p>the fact that they&rsquo;re having to put up money, right. And so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not necessarily going to make this on shoring</p>
<p>investment. The rational capitalist decision is to</p>
<p>offshore manufacturing for Intel. Yes, irrational for them</p>
<p>from a business perspective, from a board perspective, from</p>
<p>fiduciary perspective, to onshore manufacturing. So the</p>
<p>reason they&rsquo;re going to do it is not because they&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>loan where the interest rate is low, that doesn&rsquo;t really solve</p>
<p>the problem. It&rsquo;s the government saying we&rsquo;re going to put a $10</p>
<p>billion facility, we want you to build it and manage it for us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s effectively what&rsquo;s happening. And now by building</p>
<p>this $10 billion facility, we&rsquo;ve created security for the rest of</p>
<p>the US industry. It&rsquo;s worth it to the government to put that</p>
<p>money up and create security for our economy. No, it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t it create security if we if we have more on shoring</p>
<p>of chips?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say one more thing. There&rsquo;s also an investment tax</p>
<p>credit built into this bill sacks, which does provide over</p>
<p>time a bunch of incentives to continue to support and drive</p>
<p>the on shoring work that&rsquo;s proposed in the bill.</p>
<p>If you want the United States point of personal privilege,</p>
<p>can I request that Chamath add this one button to his shirt?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First, I had to watch Jason do the gun show. Now I gotta watch</p>
<p>Chamath show us your guns. Come on, pull up that sleeve and show</p>
<p>us what you want. Let&rsquo;s move on. I want to say one more thing</p>
<p>about the Pelosi stuff. So here&rsquo;s the data. I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you guys have looked at the full history of the Pelosi trading</p>
<p>data. Here&rsquo;s the link. She&rsquo;s all the trading that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>over the last couple years. So and over the past year, he has</p>
<p>bought Nvidia four different times each time in the same kind</p>
<p>of volume range. So the timing certainly may appear a suspect</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s certainly a terrible kind of thing to see. He&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>bought Apple in the last month, Microsoft, sorry, he sold Apple,</p>
<p>he bought Microsoft. He bought Alliance Bernstein earlier in</p>
<p>the year, he&rsquo;s made a few trades this year. But Nvidia, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually bought on four different occasions over the</p>
<p>past 12 months. For whatever that&rsquo;s worth, right? I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>trying to defend it. But I think we should be intellectually</p>
<p>honest about the fact that this guy, you know, does take points</p>
<p>of view in certain companies. He trades in a handful of</p>
<p>companies. Are we are we willing to be intellectually honest</p>
<p>enough to think that a husband talks to his wife? And vice</p>
<p>versa? Yeah, or does that not happen anymore? Depends on the</p>
<p>husband and wife. But yeah, I think this is blatant and out in</p>
<p>the open. I mean, it looks really at a minimum, the</p>
<p>appearance is of graft and corruption. Yeah, the appearance</p>
<p>of impropriety is impropriety. They shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to</p>
<p>trade, they should have to put their stuff into blind trusts,</p>
<p>or they should maybe trade once a year. And they should have to</p>
<p>announce their trades before the trades happen. Hey, here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on doing just like a CEO is planning on doing this</p>
<p>stuff. It&rsquo;s ridiculous that they can do this. And why does the</p>
<p>mainstream media cover this? They have Jason, do you think</p>
<p>that if Trump if this had happened during Trump, we would</p>
<p>have a lot more coverage than this policy. You remember a lot</p>
<p>of coverage on Trump, it really doesn&rsquo;t get covered. I mean, if</p>
<p>you just search for today, you&rsquo;ll see basically the only</p>
<p>media outlets covering it are like Fox News, and then zero</p>
<p>hedge. You know, that&rsquo;s it. I mean, that&rsquo;s how I found out</p>
<p>about it is like the zero hedge tweets about it.</p>
<p>Me too. So Daily Beast, you know, headline, you can go seven</p>
<p>hours ago, Dems quietly tried to jam Pelosi on stock trading</p>
<p>ban. But if you&rsquo;re asking me, you asked me a question. Chamath</p>
<p>is the media largely biased against Trump and gives a free</p>
<p>pass to the Dems? Yes. I would say that that is the trend. Yes.</p>
<p>I think that is intellectually honest of you.</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, I think the media is bankrupt. They&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going for clicks. And I think, you know, we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>this before. They saw Trump as an existential risk. And they</p>
<p>just did whatever it took to get him out of office, even</p>
<p>doing so they completely burned all of their credibility. They</p>
<p>lost a lot of credibility. And now the Dems are starting to</p>
<p>become increasingly detached and out of touch and maybe hated.</p>
<p>But then the result is that the mainstream media is just no</p>
<p>longer trusted. The media and the Democratic Party both have</p>
<p>the same problem, which is they suffer from what the Democratic</p>
<p>political scientist Roy to share is called professional class</p>
<p>hegemony. I mean, they are populated by college graduates</p>
<p>with degrees who basically have this very elitist progressive</p>
<p>agenda. And that is what is causing the Democratic the</p>
<p>working class to defect from the Democratic Party, their</p>
<p>historical base in droves. Look at Hispanics. Well, first of</p>
<p>all, if you go to the latest Biden polling numbers, he&rsquo;s down</p>
<p>to 31% approval, 60% disapprove. Okay, so the trends</p>
<p>is getting worse there. But you look at Hispanics, it&rsquo;s down to</p>
<p>19% approval, 70% disapproval. It&rsquo;s an even more intense</p>
<p>version of the same problem. You had Mayra Flores get elected</p>
<p>in that Texas seat. This is a district that went, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically a predominantly Mexican American district. They</p>
<p>went for Biden by 18 points just, you know, two years ago.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re voting for her by over 10 points. So you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Republicans winning that seat for the first time. So you have</p>
<p>these huge defections. Now, why is that happening? Because the</p>
<p>Democrats are appealing to the donor class on issues like</p>
<p>border, on issues like crime, and on issues like CRT in</p>
<p>schools. I mean, you know, the working class people in this</p>
<p>country, they don&rsquo;t want open borders, they want crime to be</p>
<p>prosecuted and cracked down on. And they do not want an</p>
<p>ideological education for their kids. Okay, it&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>But that basically is why the Democratic Party is losing</p>
<p>votes. Now, let me give you a couple other examples of the</p>
<p>Democrats cynically appealing to this sort of donor class. So</p>
<p>you recently there&rsquo;s an article about the Democrats have spent</p>
<p>$44 million this election cycle, basically running ads in favor</p>
<p>of the crazy MAGA candidate. In primaries, there&rsquo;s been a bunch</p>
<p>of reports of this where in competitive Republican primaries,</p>
<p>the Democrats will actually spend money on behalf of the</p>
<p>sort of the more perceived crazy, Republican, the MAGA</p>
<p>crazy Trump, the MAGA election denier, and so forth. Yeah,</p>
<p>because of the perception, they&rsquo;ll be easier to beat in</p>
<p>the general. But I think this is a case to be careful what you</p>
<p>wish for. Because, you know, if we have a red wave in November,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to end up with more of these candidates basically</p>
<p>winning. So it&rsquo;s a very cynical strategy. The other example, I</p>
<p>think of a very cynical strategy is you saw there was a vote in</p>
<p>the House this past week on gay marriage, and the House voted to</p>
<p>repeal DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act and support</p>
<p>basically codify Obergefell, right, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s</p>
<p>decision on gay marriage. Something like, you know, 60</p>
<p>Republicans voted for it. Look, I would have liked to have seen</p>
<p>more Republicans vote for this. I think it should be like, you</p>
<p>know, majority of the Republican Party should be voting for this.</p>
<p>But the point is that is there any intention of the Democrats</p>
<p>to bring this up in the Senate and pass it and codify</p>
<p>Obergefell when they have a chance? I think the answer is</p>
<p>no. Why? Because the Democrats would rather fundraise off this</p>
<p>issue. The same thing was true about Roe. The Democrats had</p>
<p>super majorities in the Senate under Obama, they could have</p>
<p>codified Roe, they never took the chance. Why? Because they</p>
<p>would rather fundraise off this issue from progressive elites,</p>
<p>the donor class in California and New York. So this is why</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to codify Obergefell.</p>
<p>You really think that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Obama said it on the record. Obama was asked, why were you</p>
<p>not, he campaigned on codifying Roe v. Wade. And then very</p>
<p>quickly into it, he was asked when he had the super majority</p>
<p>and built the house in the Senate, will you act on Roe v.</p>
<p>Wade? He goes, no, it is not a priority anymore. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>quote.</p>
<p>It absolutely could have been codified, just like Obergefell</p>
<p>could be codified tomorrow.</p>
<p>Look, there are there are 10 Republican votes. There are 10</p>
<p>Republican votes, at least for this in the Senate, you have a</p>
<p>filibuster proof, super majority in the Senate who would support</p>
<p>this, the same Republicans who supported the gun restriction</p>
<p>bill that Biden just signed, and that supported the</p>
<p>infrastructure bill.</p>
<p>You think they could codify abortion rights in this country</p>
<p>right now if they want?</p>
<p>No, that moment has passed. That moment&rsquo;s passed. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying Republicans would never give women the right. No, look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a super majority in the Senate anymore for for</p>
<p>codifying Roe. There is a super majority right now for</p>
<p>codifying Obergefell. They could do that right now. And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Chamath, you&rsquo;ve been a donor to the Democratic Party. Do you</p>
<p>believe that? Do you do you believe that the the abortion</p>
<p>issue drove you and others to put more money in and that</p>
<p>maybe not?</p>
<p>No, because because the leadership of the Democratic</p>
<p>Party focused on Trump in the last big cycle. It was all</p>
<p>Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. Do I think that more</p>
<p>grassroots fundraising focuses on that or gun rights or</p>
<p>abortion?</p>
<p>What Zach is saying is true that they actually held off on</p>
<p>trying to codify Roe so that they could continue to support</p>
<p>fundraising.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to give you the quote because there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no opinion needed. April 29th of 2009, President Barack Obama</p>
<p>says on Wednesday he favored abortion rights for women, but</p>
<p>that passing a law guaranteeing these rights were not his top</p>
<p>priority. I believe that women should have the right to choose.</p>
<p>Obama told a new conference marking his first 100 days in</p>
<p>office again when he had super majorities in both the House</p>
<p>and the Senate. But I think that the most important thing we</p>
<p>can do to tamp down some of the anger surrounding this issue is</p>
<p>to focus on those areas we can&rsquo;t agree on. So you make a</p>
<p>promise, you get into the seat of power, you have the decision</p>
<p>on what your legislative agenda should be. And he made that</p>
<p>calculation. And David is right, sadly, that it was in a moment</p>
<p>where we had a clear line of sight to codifying many of these</p>
<p>rights.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the question,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the question that freeberg is asking. He&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>do you think that they specifically did this to keep it</p>
<p>as an open issue to raise money off it? I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>believable. Yeah, absolutely. No way. No way. Absolutely. If you</p>
<p>want to talk about cynicism sacks, the truly cynical move</p>
<p>was, you know, Trump saying, I am going to get this in</p>
<p>evangelical vote to win the primaries to get those 20% who</p>
<p>want to take away the right for women to have an abortion. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stack the Supreme Court to actually achieve that</p>
<p>goal. That&rsquo;s the most cynical of all of the political stuff.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s define political.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Let&rsquo;s define terms. So</p>
<p>you may be opposed to what Trump did. But there wasn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t cynical. He stated what he was going to do when he went</p>
<p>for office. And then he did it. He lived up to his promise.</p>
<p>Somebody. He did not believe in that. He did not believe in</p>
<p>that. He did it specifically to get those votes. We all know he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t believe in it. We all know he believes in a women&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right to choose.</p>
<p>Jason, he he created a platform to get elected. Yes. That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying. When he was elected, he executed on that platform. I</p>
<p>think what David Sachs is saying is Obama had a platform to get</p>
<p>him elected. And when Obama chose had to choice, he chose to</p>
<p>not execute on the platform. And that is also true. And all I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just saying is, we owe it to ourselves to be intellectually</p>
<p>honest about what happened. That is what happened. Okay. Both of</p>
<p>these two guys made claims. Hold on one second. Both of these</p>
<p>two guys made claims acting in your own self interest. I</p>
<p>understand. But please, I want this on the record. Both of</p>
<p>these two guys made claims to become president. It turns out</p>
<p>that Trump actually did execute on most of his claims as</p>
<p>abhorrent as they were to some. Yeah. And Obama on some of the</p>
<p>most important issues of our time did not look what Trump did</p>
<p>was just simple coalition politics. He thought it was</p>
<p>important to win the religious right. He basically appealed to</p>
<p>them. He said that if you vote for me, I will nominate these</p>
<p>judges. He delivered, he delivered. He didn&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>it himself. Right. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about. At a</p>
<p>certain point doesn&rsquo;t matter. That&rsquo;s not cynical. People</p>
<p>should have for sure have principles. Okay, look, I know</p>
<p>that he doesn&rsquo;t have principles, but it matters to me that people</p>
<p>have. Okay, but Jason, what does it mean to have the principle</p>
<p>of saying that he&rsquo;s going to, he&rsquo;s going to pass and codify</p>
<p>Roe v. Wade and not do it? What is that then? I think he will</p>
<p>listen, I, the quote you gave doesn&rsquo;t give why he didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>it. He didn&rsquo;t make it a priority. It could also hold on,</p>
<p>let me finish. It could also be that he believed that it would</p>
<p>not get overturned. So he should spend his time on Obamacare and</p>
<p>other things. I&rsquo;m saying cynicism is when you believe one</p>
<p>thing, and then you do something to act in your own</p>
<p>self-interest. And that&rsquo;s what I think. Hold on a second. We</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to go back all the way to the Obama administration</p>
<p>because the issue I&rsquo;m talking about today is that in the past</p>
<p>week, they had a vote codifying Obergefell on gay marriage and</p>
<p>repealing DOMA. Okay. So now listen, I actually think there</p>
<p>were so many Republican votes in the house, even though I would</p>
<p>have liked to have seen more, there were enough that, that</p>
<p>this might shame Schumer into bringing up the vote because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be so obvious if he doesn&rsquo;t, that he is doing</p>
<p>this for a reason, right? Because they have the votes,</p>
<p>they can pass this just like they passed the gun bill a few</p>
<p>weeks ago, right? Just like they passed the infrastructure bill.</p>
<p>So if he, if Schumer doesn&rsquo;t bring this up, it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>cynical move.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s strategically to have that as an issue to phrase</p>
<p>funding. I get it.</p>
<p>Of course. And it&rsquo;s really proof. Listen, I think that</p>
<p>Both sides are cynical.</p>
<p>Of course. Both sides engage in politics. However, however,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m talking about is the type of cynicism. So I think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of issues on which the Democrats would</p>
<p>rather appeal to the donor class, basically that lives on</p>
<p>the coast in New York, California, and be able to keep</p>
<p>fundraising on that issue and basically scaremonger on that</p>
<p>issue. Instead of just winning the issue, they can just win</p>
<p>this issue right now.</p>
<p>Chamath, do you have less interest in supporting the</p>
<p>Democratic Party based on the principle you stated that in</p>
<p>the past, there have been kind of promises and capital raised</p>
<p>against, you know, codifying Roe and then it not happening.</p>
<p>Well, they never made those promises to me. So I never felt</p>
<p>like they lied to me. I want to be very clear. So then nobody</p>
<p>and I never asked for that to be a precondition of my donation.</p>
<p>Again, my capital was focused on one thing, which is I thought</p>
<p>that President Trump was not the right person to lead this</p>
<p>country. And I thought very clearly that the bright Democrat</p>
<p>could do a much, much better job. And I am glad that Biden</p>
<p>won. And I&rsquo;m glad that the money that I put in, maybe in no in</p>
<p>any small way, but hopefully in some reasonable, non trivial</p>
<p>way, helped. And I&rsquo;m glad that that money helped even out the</p>
<p>Senate. I&rsquo;m glad all of those things happened. And so I want</p>
<p>to be clear. They&rsquo;ve never made those kinds of promises to be</p>
<p>nor have I ever asked. I make a high level decision on who I</p>
<p>think the best candidate should be and support the party that</p>
<p>will get that best candidate affected what I was just trying</p>
<p>to make clear to you guys is that sometimes even a Democrat,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important for us to be intellectually honest about what</p>
<p>has happened. It&rsquo;s very easy to look at the other guy and find</p>
<p>all the ways in which they screwed up or tried to screw</p>
<p>you or, you know, is in a lack sympathy or lack sympathy, all</p>
<p>of these things. It&rsquo;s much harder oftentimes to look at</p>
<p>your own team and say, wait a minute, why didn&rsquo;t x, y and z</p>
<p>happen. And the reason I&rsquo;m bringing up what happened in</p>
<p>2009 is I think David is right. We have a moment in time where</p>
<p>the leadership of the Democratic Party can codify rights that</p>
<p>should be codified. And they should have in hindsight, they</p>
<p>should have done it. And just to be clear, no, it is still</p>
<p>open. We can do I&rsquo;m talking about Roe v. Wade. And yes, and</p>
<p>for the for the issue we&rsquo;re talking about now, it should be</p>
<p>codified. Absolutely. And just to be clear, I&rsquo;m an</p>
<p>independent, I would vote for a republican who was socially</p>
<p>progressive and fiscally conservative, as long as they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>for gay marriage, as long as they&rsquo;re pro women&rsquo;s right to</p>
<p>choose. And they were fiscally conservative, I would vote for a</p>
<p>republican, I&rsquo;m a moderate independent, I want to see less</p>
<p>government and more efficient government. And I want people I</p>
<p>want the government out of people&rsquo;s personal lives. And I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s where sacks and I are exactly the same. We both</p>
<p>want I mean, sacks, do you want the government involved in</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s personal lives? You&rsquo;re a Republican, by the way,</p>
<p>according to the Monmouth poll from a few weeks ago, you</p>
<p>represent 4% of the voting base. I do. That&rsquo;s an extreme. Yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an extreme minority that the the lowest self identifying</p>
<p>quadrant of fiscal conservative versus kind of fiscal liberal</p>
<p>social conservative social liberal is the fiscal</p>
<p>conservative social liberal. What are we all here? We&rsquo;re I</p>
<p>think we all fit this profile fiscally, we want the government</p>
<p>to be run conservatively, you know, and with less government</p>
<p>and we want progressive social change, right? I mean, I think</p>
<p>we all feel that don&rsquo;t put me in a corner government out of</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s personal. I&rsquo;m just asking you guys, if we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>insane, I wouldn&rsquo;t define my cultural positions as</p>
<p>progressive social change, because the change that</p>
<p>progressives are trying to do right now is radical. What I</p>
<p>favor is social tolerance. I think we need to be tolerant,</p>
<p>we need to be a tolerant society. America is a very</p>
<p>broad, diverse country, we need to find ways to live together</p>
<p>and find accommodation on issues that are very contentious. So</p>
<p>that includes tolerance for gay marriage. So look, I&rsquo;m on board</p>
<p>with that. But, you know, this radical, progressive agenda of</p>
<p>social change, which includes upending the criminal justice</p>
<p>system in favor of not favor that, yeah, what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>the schools with CRT, and the sort of hyper ideologized</p>
<p>education, look, they should just be teaching the basics,</p>
<p>reading, leave it up to parents to do the other stuff. Exactly.</p>
<p>I agree. So on down the line,</p>
<p>but maybe progressive is the wrong term, because that that</p>
<p>now has been co opted, less government involved in your</p>
<p>personal life and tolerance. I think we all agree on that. And</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re tolerant. It&rsquo;s a great word. Everybody agrees</p>
<p>with tolerance. It&rsquo;s a privileged position to want to</p>
<p>have less government involved in your life, right? I mean,</p>
<p>many people in the United States have been able to thrive</p>
<p>and survive because of the role that government has played in</p>
<p>their lives. And there&rsquo;s obviously on one end of the</p>
<p>spectrum, extreme grift. And on the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>extreme need that is being met by the wealthiest government in</p>
<p>the world. And it is a, you know, it is in that middle where</p>
<p>all of where do you stand? How would you describe your politics</p>
<p>in these two dynamics? Right? Are you also in this 4%</p>
<p>freebird? Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;m trying to be</p>
<p>thoughtful about this. Because, you know, I think it&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think that the government&rsquo;s role is to support</p>
<p>those in need, not those in want. And I think that the</p>
<p>government should be held accountable for performing that</p>
<p>role. And I think that those of us who can, that are sitting in</p>
<p>privileged positions and seats should enable the government to</p>
<p>perform that role well, and we should be positive actors,</p>
<p>meaning we should support, we should pay taxes, and we should</p>
<p>help people and institutions in need. And that are, you know,</p>
<p>kind of for the greater good. And then we should be holding</p>
<p>ourselves, our government and our, our politicians to account</p>
<p>for inefficiencies. And the biggest concern I have is less</p>
<p>about are the people in need needs being met as much as are</p>
<p>we holding our government to account for the performance of</p>
<p>its services and duties to the American people. And I really</p>
<p>like we are want, I like this want need concept here. Can you</p>
<p>give an example of where the government like people need</p>
<p>something, but then there&rsquo;s another group that wants</p>
<p>something and maybe we&rsquo;re overstretching and you know,</p>
<p>giving into wants when we should be focused on needs and</p>
<p>efficiency. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll give you a pretty</p>
<p>example I know reasonably well, which is the farm bill passes</p>
<p>every four years. And the farm bill in order to get it passed</p>
<p>in both the House and the Senate, it has components that</p>
<p>serve both farmers and support the the food stamp program. So</p>
<p>the food stamp program obviously supports millions of Americans</p>
<p>that are in need of food can&rsquo;t afford food, they get EBT cards,</p>
<p>they get support and buying food. And there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>programs and access that are enabled by that program. But in</p>
<p>order, but that mostly services the needs of urban areas of</p>
<p>cities. So it passes that that that element of the bill is</p>
<p>attractive and appealing to the representatives of cities found</p>
<p>in the house. On the other side, in order to get it passed in</p>
<p>the Senate, where the majority of senators come from rural</p>
<p>states, which are have significant farming populations,</p>
<p>the farming subsidies are planted in that same bill. And</p>
<p>as a result, because everyone&rsquo;s getting something, that bill as</p>
<p>a whole has now grown to a multi $100 billion bill that gets</p>
<p>passed every few years. Because in order for the Senate to pass</p>
<p>it, the house says, Okay, we&rsquo;ll give you all these farm</p>
<p>subsidies. In order for the house to pass it, the Senate</p>
<p>says, well, sorry, it&rsquo;s vice versa, right? We&rsquo;ll give you all</p>
<p>these food stamps. But But both of them now have incredible what</p>
<p>do they call it pork or fat or whatever? Yeah, the amount of</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s wasted, that isn&rsquo;t actually servicing the original</p>
<p>intention and need of either of the parties that are represented</p>
<p>by that bill is extraordinary. And I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in</p>
<p>the farm bill, I actually went with lobbyists years ago to DC,</p>
<p>and I actually met with the Senate and house ad committees,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone very deep into the bill and some of the programs in</p>
<p>that bill. And it&rsquo;s just shocking to me in the same way</p>
<p>that Palmer lucky shared in our online summit, how shocking it</p>
<p>is how defense spending works in this country. It&rsquo;s shocking to</p>
<p>me how some of the the programs work in the farm bill, how much</p>
<p>money and how much waste there is and how much grift there is.</p>
<p>And so yes, we are meeting the needs of populations in need in</p>
<p>this country. But so much more of the bill now is about people</p>
<p>wanting more in order to pass the bill, and it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bloated. Alright, so they&rsquo;re gonna come in and fix it,</p>
<p>because where&rsquo;s the incentive for anyone to come in and cut</p>
<p>that bill up? Where&rsquo;s the incentive to fix it? If both</p>
<p>sides are barbelling the grift, then there&rsquo;s no incentive</p>
<p>there. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re in a dance to maximize the grift.</p>
<p>Where do you stand now, if we if we were to sort of look at</p>
<p>politics without the Biden and Trump derangement syndrome</p>
<p>without the tribalism, just in terms of first principles, I</p>
<p>think what we&rsquo;re seeing here is we all want to see radical</p>
<p>competence in the government, social issues fight, you know,</p>
<p>and fiscally how we run the country, where do you stand? How</p>
<p>would you describe yourself now?</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I think of things in terms of risk.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I see. I see that there are a handful of issues</p>
<p>that remain in terms of social policy that just need to get</p>
<p>codified. Gay marriage is an example of one abortion rights</p>
<p>is an example of the other. Then, and I think like those are</p>
<p>And I think like those are like really to my to my perspective,</p>
<p>speak about human individual liberty, which I think should</p>
<p>trump everything. So everybody should be allowed to kind of</p>
<p>pursue the best version of themselves. However, that</p>
<p>manifests in the person you marry to in in the gender you</p>
<p>express, not these are like things where what you do to be</p>
<p>happy, you should be allowed to do period end of story. Then</p>
<p>there are issues where I think are much thornier. And as I get</p>
<p>older, I become increasingly ambivalent, or confused,</p>
<p>actually, is a better word. And gun control is a perfect example</p>
<p>of that, where I don&rsquo;t know what my right is to go and adjudicate</p>
<p>a change to the Constitution that&rsquo;s been there since the</p>
<p>founding of this country. That&rsquo;s a much more complicated</p>
<p>issue. And so I think we have to basically devolve that right to</p>
<p>the states, where individual states will have very different</p>
<p>laws and part of how you choose to express where you live will</p>
<p>be defined by some of those rules. So that&rsquo;s the social</p>
<p>side. Extreme tolerance is really how I would sum it up.</p>
<p>Economically, so but but I think that the risk to America</p>
<p>imploding, quote, unquote, because of an issue in that</p>
<p>surface area, in my opinion, is extremely limited. If I look on</p>
<p>the economic lens, however, I think there are enormous risks</p>
<p>to American leadership and exceptionalism. And we need a</p>
<p>wholesale reset of how we create incentives of how government</p>
<p>should work, of how regulatory capture should work, of how the</p>
<p>capital markets work. These rules are way too perverted. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s creating enormous stress in a system. And again, I go back</p>
<p>to the example I used last episode. The thing that if you</p>
<p>look, for example, like, you know, in that example of Sri</p>
<p>Lanka, Singapore, Jamaica, and how there were these three</p>
<p>completely different outcomes. Underneath the most successful</p>
<p>outcome was an incredibly clear, transparent and simple</p>
<p>financial framework. You cannot spend more than you have. You</p>
<p>need to invest in long term programs like education and</p>
<p>healthcare, you need to make them broadly available. And then</p>
<p>you need to have an absolute free market that gets the best</p>
<p>ideas to the top of the funnel. And if you can just incorporate</p>
<p>those things, the tax law could be four pages, you know, the</p>
<p>number of regulations could be 50 pages, you know, the simple</p>
<p>rule that says to the Federal Reserve, you can&rsquo;t just print</p>
<p>free money ad hoc. So I&rsquo;m much more concerned about the fiscal</p>
<p>future of America, I think that there&rsquo;s so much movement and</p>
<p>progress on the social side, including the freedom of</p>
<p>movement of people to different states. It is an important set</p>
<p>of issues. But in terms of what drives the outcome and future</p>
<p>success for our kids and our kids as kids, people should not</p>
<p>sleep on the economy, because if we get this wrong, that will be</p>
<p>the tinderbox that lights everything on fire.</p>
<p>Saks when you hear, you know, everybody sort of explain their</p>
<p>basic belief system, how far apart do you think we all are on</p>
<p>this podcast? Because I think that&rsquo;s been a an issue we see a</p>
<p>lot of the fans discussing you and I discussing, it feels like</p>
<p>on most of these issues, and I think that&rsquo;s people ask me how</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m friends with you all the time. And I&rsquo;m sure you get that</p>
<p>question as well. Yeah. And I love you. No, I love sacks like</p>
<p>a brother. And anytime we talk about basic issues, we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>much in sync. And then when we talk about politics, it feels</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re super, you know, you know, opposed, you know, in</p>
<p>opposition to each other, when you hear that we all have</p>
<p>essentially the same stack of fundamental beliefs, how do you</p>
<p>interpret this in terms of politics and America writ large</p>
<p>and how do we get consensus in this country to be more</p>
<p>effective in running the country for the citizens?</p>
<p>I think the media drives a lot of polarization, right? Because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re feeding us a bunch of bogus narratives, you look at</p>
<p>the polling around the trust in the traditional media has</p>
<p>absolutely plummeted through the floor. I mean, they basically</p>
<p>have, instead of just reporting objectively, the facts they, I</p>
<p>think the audience has recognized that they are</p>
<p>activists, they are basically pushing an agenda, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pushing a bunch of bogus narratives. And I think it does</p>
<p>drive the polarization. So that&rsquo;s part of it. To go back to</p>
<p>you know, what, what are the core issues that motivate me and</p>
<p>like who I support? Look, I think we could probably agree on</p>
<p>a lot of stuff. I want us to pursue more of an internationally</p>
<p>cautious, you know, agenda, less interventionist, because it</p>
<p>really hasn&rsquo;t worked out for us very well over the last 20 years</p>
<p>with all these wars that failed. I want us to be fiscally</p>
<p>responsible and promote a healthy economy, to what Jamal</p>
<p>said. And then third, I&rsquo;d like us to be socially tolerant. Now,</p>
<p>why does that leave me in this current environment to support</p>
<p>Republicans? Well, on international, on sort of</p>
<p>foreign policy, neither party is really very good. Both parties</p>
<p>are sort of pushing some version of book Bush doctrine</p>
<p>light where we&rsquo;re basically over involving ourselves in all</p>
<p>these countries all over the world. But the Republicans at</p>
<p>least have a faction that&rsquo;s in favor of realism and restraint.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to help kind of push that direction within the</p>
<p>party. The Democrats just are still very much in this liberal</p>
<p>interventionist mode. On fiscal issues, both parties are guilty</p>
<p>of overspending and creating this ruinous federal debt and</p>
<p>deficits that we have. However, there&rsquo;s no way to avoid the fact</p>
<p>that the Democrats are just worse. I mean, Biden wanted an</p>
<p>extra 4 trillion of spending on this whole build back better on</p>
<p>top of the 4 trillion he had. So listen, I know the Republicans</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have clean hands on this issue, but the progressives are</p>
<p>just worse. And as long as the progressives are calling the</p>
<p>shots, the Democratic Party, they&rsquo;re just worse on spending.</p>
<p>And then you got social tolerance. Listen, on the issues</p>
<p>on these sort of key rights issues that have been the kind</p>
<p>of the old social issues last 50 years, by and large, not on</p>
<p>all these things, by and large, I&rsquo;m with you guys, that I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>favor of sort of the socially tolerant position. But look at</p>
<p>who is pushing social intolerance today. I mean, the</p>
<p>progressives are the most intolerant group in America.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones pushing cancel culture. They&rsquo;re the ones</p>
<p>trying to shove their positions down the throats of ordinary</p>
<p>Americans. This is what&rsquo;s creating the backlash. You look</p>
<p>at issues today like CRT, like the progressive approach on</p>
<p>crime, on borders, the progressives are trying to</p>
<p>promote, I think, a social policy that is fundamentally</p>
<p>intolerant and doesn&rsquo;t accord any respect or room for</p>
<p>traditional Americans to live their lives the way they want</p>
<p>to. And you have to be tolerant of them as well. We&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to have peace in our society without some tolerance of</p>
<p>traditionalists.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wrap on this Chamath and then move to China.</p>
<p>I sent you guys a, this was a quote by Mike Solana, a tweet</p>
<p>from Mike Solana. The caption is, I&rsquo;ve been wondering how</p>
<p>they were going to spin this. And this builds exactly on what</p>
<p>David just said here. When the Quinnipiac poll came out and</p>
<p>about approve, disapprove about President Biden, you know, the</p>
<p>big outlier was the Hispanic population. 19% approve, 70%</p>
<p>disapprove. And the article in the Washington Post, which tries</p>
<p>to kind of sort of like clean this all up and whitewash it,</p>
<p>says fake news speaks many languages, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>particularly fond of Spanish. Essentially saying that, you</p>
<p>know, the fake news problem in the Spanish language has</p>
<p>basically gotten so bad that, you know, this sort of explains</p>
<p>why Hispanics have moved in droves. And it&rsquo;s like a whole</p>
<p>race baiting cheap shot article. But the point of all</p>
<p>of this is just to show that the left, this is what really</p>
<p>does kind of bum me out. They are, they are probably more</p>
<p>intolerant than they&rsquo;ve ever been. They are intellectual</p>
<p>dishonesty. Like if Rachel Maddow really wanted to increase</p>
<p>her standing and position, she would just start the next</p>
<p>program with Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s trades and say, listen, we all</p>
<p>know, let&rsquo;s call this what it is. It&rsquo;s not cool. And here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how it should change. She&rsquo;ll never do it. I know. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the disappointing part about all this. Okay, so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shift now. I think we</p>
<p>Well, can I say one final thing about this whole thing that we</p>
<p>can move on is, I think, I think if you are sort of purple and</p>
<p>centrist, I think the first two years of the Biden</p>
<p>administration were really a missed opportunity, because I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s sort of this conventional wisdom that the</p>
<p>parties are so polarized, they can&rsquo;t get anything done. I think</p>
<p>we saw actually, there&rsquo;s enough Republican votes or there were</p>
<p>in the in the previous Congress, this current Congress, they got</p>
<p>the infrastructure bill done, they got the gun bill done, you</p>
<p>know, with the red flag laws, and so forth that we talked</p>
<p>about, they can get codification of gay marriage done,</p>
<p>if they want to, they could have gotten the electoral count</p>
<p>act reform. So if Biden hadn&rsquo;t gone all the way with his</p>
<p>progressive voting rights agenda, and just focused on</p>
<p>reforming the electoral count act, then you could have</p>
<p>prevented a situation like we had on January 6, that what was</p>
<p>happening inside the Capitol, not outside. So there was a lot</p>
<p>of stuff they could have passed, and they didn&rsquo;t. Why? Because</p>
<p>in the first half of his administration, Biden&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>completely captive to the progressives. There&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing as well, you could get a child tax credit passed, you</p>
<p>could get Romney would basically be the floor leader on that. In</p>
<p>the Senate, they could pass a child tax credit. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most popular part of BBB. Why don&rsquo;t they peel that off and</p>
<p>vote on it?</p>
<p>You know, because they went for the whole thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. The progressives are holding it hostage saying</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not going to give that to you unless you do the</p>
<p>whole enchilada. And of course, there&rsquo;s no votes for that. So I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s, and so who ultimately is the culprit for</p>
<p>allowing this to happen? Well, partly Biden, but also Ron</p>
<p>Klain, the chief of staff. I mean, they&rsquo;ve made, instead of</p>
<p>triangulating to the center, they should have realized, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a 5050 president, right? I mean, we have a 5050 Senate, we</p>
<p>should be triangulating, we should be building a centrist</p>
<p>coalition. Ron Klain has been letting the progressives ride</p>
<p>the train.</p>
<p>Biden had a clear path to go right to the center, pull</p>
<p>everybody in, pull the working class in, that&rsquo;s been his</p>
<p>supporting base, working class, and so he is and he blew it by</p>
<p>going too far to the left. If he wants to save this presidency,</p>
<p>he should go straight to the middle and get all the working</p>
<p>class behind him.</p>
<p>Biden isn&rsquo;t the guy that went to some elite, you know, East</p>
<p>Coast liberal arts school where he got a master&rsquo;s in, you know,</p>
<p>fine arts and is 400,000 in debt. That&rsquo;s not Joe Biden, but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s let all these people run over the White House.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s too late now, because I think what&rsquo;s going to happen is</p>
<p>that, well, the Republicans are going to win the House, at</p>
<p>least. How much time did we spend talking about cancelling</p>
<p>student debt for who? Yeah, no, for a bunch of elite, elite rich</p>
<p>graduate degrees from. Yeah, it&rsquo;s at least listen, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grifters on both sides. It&rsquo;s disgusting. And we need to get</p>
<p>to a version of politics that maybe is more like our</p>
<p>conversations here. But let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s pivot to another society</p>
<p>that we thought was going to roll over ours. But and that</p>
<p>and that we were in, we were behind on in terms of</p>
<p>competition. China&rsquo;s in chaos right now, apparently, in terms</p>
<p>of slowing economic growth, bank protests, mortgage protests,</p>
<p>exactly what I predicted last year, when you guys were</p>
<p>talking about China was going to dunk on us. And I said, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s very hard to run these authoritarian countries</p>
<p>and the citizens like to protest when they get the short</p>
<p>end of the stick. And here we go. Chinese economy is growing</p>
<p>very slowly. They were going to do five and a half percent this</p>
<p>year. They were only point 4% in q2. COVID has a lot to do</p>
<p>with this. But there&rsquo;s been a series of bank protests and the</p>
<p>media has been trying to figure out exactly what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>here. To just set the stage here, rural banks in China, in</p>
<p>a couple of provinces, froze a bunch of people&rsquo;s withdrawals</p>
<p>in April. Okay, sounds like the crypto contagion. In many ways,</p>
<p>they had been offering unusually high interest rates.</p>
<p>Also sounding like the defy griff going on here.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s more like 2008. Jason, I think the</p>
<p>financial, I think it&rsquo;s more like the financial crisis in</p>
<ol start="2008">
<li>That was driven by the real estate bubble. Yes, they&rsquo;ve</li>
</ol>
<p>got their own real estate bubble, which is collapsing</p>
<p>there. Correct. And so there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s multiple things going</p>
<p>on at once. The authorities haven&rsquo;t said how much money is</p>
<p>frozen. Protesters claim it&rsquo;s billions of one, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hundreds of millions in the US. After weeks without a resolution,</p>
<p>customers have been began protesting. Plainclothes thugs</p>
<p>have been hitting and kicking the protesters. And as of</p>
<p>Wednesday, a video went viral of the CCP bringing in tanks to</p>
<p>protect the banks very evocative of Tiananmen Square. I</p>
<p>have a question. So good. Yeah. So China has a very explicit</p>
<p>zero tolerance policy on COVID. Why do you guys think they are</p>
<p>so extreme in that policy? Like any any ideas like had they</p>
<p>explained why it has to be zero tolerance? They have not</p>
<p>explained that. And if you believe that they&rsquo;re the origin</p>
<p>of COVID, maybe they have some insider information about long</p>
<p>haul COVID. And that was something I want to talk to</p>
<p>Friedberg about if he thinks this, you know, long term COVID</p>
<p>stuff is a really acute issue. But free bird, what do you</p>
<p>think? Yeah, I don&rsquo;t. Let me I don&rsquo;t want to answer. Can I</p>
<p>answer that? If you don&rsquo;t want to? Yeah. I think the answer is</p>
<p>very simple. But I do want to talk about the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. There&rsquo;s a lot to turn over to. Yeah, this is a</p>
<p>complex issue. There&rsquo;s a lot more going on there. So on zero</p>
<p>COVID, I think this is coming directly from Xi. This is his</p>
<p>policy. And I think that earlier in the pandemic, they were</p>
<p>hailing their response, which they saw as orderly and</p>
<p>effective at controlling COVID. And they were contrasting that</p>
<p>with a chaotic Western response. And so I think that the</p>
<p>credibility of the CCP and G himself got tied up in this</p>
<p>idea of stopping COVID entirely of zero COVID. And so I think</p>
<p>this is coming directly from the top, and it&rsquo;s having a huge</p>
<p>impact on their economy. And I think this is one of the</p>
<p>dangerous aspects of a autocratic system is you got one</p>
<p>guy at the top making the decisions. And if he&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not really a great feedback. And nobody can</p>
<p>question him. Yeah, there&rsquo;s no questioning the God King. Yeah,</p>
<p>you know, it sort of recalls a situation in China, I think</p>
<p>this is about 500 years ago, there was a Chinese emperor who</p>
<p>banned shipbuilding, and banning having a navy. And because of</p>
<p>that China shut itself off from global trade, and it fell well</p>
<p>behind the West, which then explored and captured the new</p>
<p>world. There&rsquo;s this question about, you know, the Chinese,</p>
<p>Chinese culture and civilization was much more</p>
<p>advanced than the West than Europe 1000 years ago, but</p>
<p>basically, it fell behind. And a big reason is because this</p>
<p>unilateral decision by one emperor to basically close</p>
<p>themselves off from the rest of the world. So you have to</p>
<p>wonder, does this autocratic move by G basically doom their</p>
<p>economy to a recession? It seems like they&rsquo;re not learning</p>
<p>from our experience, these lockdowns didn&rsquo;t work. I mean,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t stop the virus, it&rsquo;s eventually going to get out.</p>
<p>Even I saw Biden got the virus this week. I mean, it&rsquo;s out,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s gonna get it is basically what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making a bunch of heavy handed decisions like this. So you</p>
<p>had besides lockdowns, it was, it&rsquo;s also the crackdowns. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the crackdown on the tech industry.</p>
<p>Yeah. Venture funding has plummeted. And so has so LPS are</p>
<p>no longer investing in funds there with the exception of</p>
<p>sequoias, which seems to be struggling, but is still able to</p>
<p>raise the money. And then additionally, founders can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>raise money. And founders are questioning when they meet with</p>
<p>VCs if they can actually if the VCs are just meeting with them</p>
<p>theatrically, the story that came out this week in the FT,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re just meeting with them theatrically, because they</p>
<p>want to still hold out hope that there&rsquo;ll be a venture capital</p>
<p>industry, but there may not be a VC industry in China anymore.</p>
<p>Let me just give you the housing stuff. And then Freeberg, I know</p>
<p>you want to chime in on this. So there&rsquo;s also mortgage boycotts</p>
<p>happening at the same time as this fugazi bank stuff happened.</p>
<p>The bank stuff seems to be not the national banks. These are</p>
<p>local banks that apparently could have been running some</p>
<p>kind of grift where people deposited money. It looks a lot</p>
<p>like the savings and loan kind of behavior in the 90s. And these</p>
<p>are regional banks. To be clear, this isn&rsquo;t the national banks.</p>
<p>And so at the same time, the mortgage boycotts are happening</p>
<p>in three at 301 unfinished developments in 91 cities,</p>
<p>homeowners are accusing developers are failing to</p>
<p>deliver the apartments they&rsquo;ve already paid for, according to</p>
<p>Bloomberg, 70% of household wealth in China&rsquo;s tied up in</p>
<p>property much higher than the US.</p>
<p>This is downstream of the whole Evergrande thing, right? You got</p>
<p>Evergrande basically defaulted, and there were a whole bunch of</p>
<p>people who prepaid for their homes. And so they&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>paying mortgage, but Evergrande never finished the homes. And</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re rising up because they&rsquo;re saying, why should we</p>
<p>pay for a home that was never delivered?</p>
<p>Right. I just want to like take a zoom out because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth, you know, we can focus on any one of these particular</p>
<p>things that are happening, and try and diagnose them and</p>
<p>dissect them. But if you zoom out a little bit, I think it</p>
<p>paints a more interesting picture over the last 30 years,</p>
<p>right, the Chinese economy grew from 318 billion to in 1990 to</p>
<p>10 and a half trillion in 2020, right, incredible growth GDP per</p>
<p>capita, you know, grew kind of in a similar ratio, right? Now,</p>
<p>from 318 bucks per person to $12,500 in 30 years, I mean,</p>
<p>really unprecedented in the history of humanity. China now</p>
<p>accounts for 20% of global GDP from less than 2% 1990. Now, if</p>
<p>you look at historically, what drove that growth, we all talk</p>
<p>about manufacturing, right, manufacturing counts for about a</p>
<p>third of the economy. And manufacturing as a sector was</p>
<p>growing in China 25% year over year in 2008, and then only grew</p>
<p>6% in 2022. It&rsquo;s like basically, you know, kind of reaching an</p>
<p>all time low in recent years. So that&rsquo;s historically been the</p>
<p>driver for growth of this economy. And so much of the, you</p>
<p>know, the bargain between the people and the Chinese Communist</p>
<p>Party has been keep giving us a better life, keep growing our</p>
<p>economy, keep giving us more housing, more stuff, more food,</p>
<p>more safety, more security, will support the CCP. And the</p>
<p>challenge that the CCP is having is that a lot of that growth,</p>
<p>the core growth engine is starting to slow. So</p>
<p>manufacturing is slowing, then real estate was growing. And so</p>
<p>real estate accounts for 7% of the Chinese economy. And I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got a good stat for you guys here. In 2005, 250 million</p>
<p>square meters of real estate was sold in China. In 2021 1.5</p>
<p>billion was sold every year, it&rsquo;s been incrementing. So the</p>
<p>amount of real estate that&rsquo;s being produced and sold was</p>
<p>increasing like crazy. This year, it&rsquo;s collapsed. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all it&rsquo;s down like, you know, forecast to be about 1.25</p>
<p>billion now. So the first decline in real estate building</p>
<p>and sales. So that part of the driver of the of the economy in</p>
<p>China is now collapsing. And then the financial services</p>
<p>sector accounts for 8% of the economy. And that&rsquo;s been growing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s leveraged off manufacturing and real estate,</p>
<p>and all the capital that&rsquo;s flown in all of which is slowing</p>
<p>down and stopping, you know, this $58 trillion of assets in</p>
<p>China, generating about $700 billion of annual profits for</p>
<p>the financial services industry, insurance, banking, lending,</p>
<p>and so on. So a lot of the conflict and the things that are</p>
<p>starting to fall apart, which may just be the tip of the</p>
<p>iceberg, is a function of a fundamentally slowing economy.</p>
<p>And the forecast and the outlook for an economy that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the drivers it&rsquo;s had historically, and things</p>
<p>are starting to come off the wheels are starting to come off</p>
<p>a bit. And so you know, look, the advantage they have is</p>
<p>central planning, long term investments, being able to kind</p>
<p>of be thoughtful about this. But in order to do that, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certainly going to be a need for the CCP to keep people in</p>
<p>line, as some of the long term bets hopefully play out for</p>
<p>them, as they would say, in order to do that, they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have lockdowns and other sorts of mechanisms of</p>
<p>regulatory control over the people. But really, this could</p>
<p>be the beginning of some of the unwinding and real concern</p>
<p>about, you know, is there a core economic growth engine in</p>
<p>China that can save them? And what will it be?</p>
<p>I think all of this, if we look at what&rsquo;s happening in the</p>
<p>economy, writ large, Chamath, you know, the global slowdown</p>
<p>plus inflation is now causing a stress test on every country,</p>
<p>Sri Lanka stress test, you know, showed us what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with their farming issues and with corruption. And here in</p>
<p>China, it the stress test, I think you would agree showing</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in terms of, you know, banking, mortgages,</p>
<p>real estate, and obviously, this surging middle class and</p>
<p>what their expectations of life are. So what&rsquo;s your take on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in China? And are they, you know, how does</p>
<p>this add up in terms of our rivalry with them as our</p>
<p>contemporary?</p>
<p>At a very macro level, China has one massive, massive,</p>
<p>massive problem, which is one of population. It&rsquo;s hard to get</p>
<p>an accurate count. But it is an aggressively aging population,</p>
<p>which was the result of the one child policy for a very long</p>
<p>time. China has sort of been on their heels trying to adapt</p>
<p>that policy. But really, the last data I saw, I tweeted this</p>
<p>out, it was a little while ago, Nick, so maybe hard for you to</p>
<p>find in my Twitter feed. But it was a projection of China&rsquo;s</p>
<p>population, which essentially showed a contracting by almost</p>
<p>50% by 2100. So in the end, so that&rsquo;s a really, really bad</p>
<p>situation. Now, when you have a slowing population, then the</p>
<p>economy has to morph. Why is that, when you have a young</p>
<p>population, so for example, take what China was 20 years ago,</p>
<p>when it entered the WTO, or what India is today, when you have</p>
<p>lots of thoughts of young people, you can on ramp them</p>
<p>into economically productive activities like manufacturing.</p>
<p>The problem when those folks accumulate middle class income</p>
<p>and wealth, is that they age out of those kinds of jobs like</p>
<p>they did in America. And what we seek our services and service</p>
<p>level jobs, and you spend more money, you spend it in a</p>
<p>different way. So as populations age, your economy has to turn</p>
<p>over, unless you have a large bulwark of young people that is</p>
<p>constantly growing to take up more of the slack, the economic</p>
<p>slack to pay for these folks who have different lifestyles, more</p>
<p>savings, and different needs, specifically healthcare. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s enormously big problem. So when you see them talking</p>
<p>about 6% GDP targets, and you think, how does a country that</p>
<p>big even grow at 6%? It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re reverse</p>
<p>engineering for what they need to create economic vibrancy in</p>
<p>that country. And so when you start to look at 2%, which in</p>
<p>America, you&rsquo;d say, percent&rsquo;s great, we would like high fiving</p>
<p>each other for 2%. That&rsquo;s not a sustainable level of growth for</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening inside that country. It does not create</p>
<p>enough of expansion economically, to cover all these</p>
<p>folks, that is a really, really big issue. So as that happens, I</p>
<p>think what we need to do is figure out how to be</p>
<p>competitive. Now, this goes all the way back to our first</p>
<p>conversation. Subsidies don&rsquo;t make us more competitive. Things</p>
<p>that governments can do to make us more competitive are long</p>
<p>term drawn out tax incentives that change the earnings</p>
<p>capacity of companies. Why? Because in the capital markets</p>
<p>reward those businesses. Jason, you just mentioned it. Why is</p>
<p>the Chinese capital markets in difficulty? Nobody knows what</p>
<p>the long term earnings are. How do you forecast it? It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>simple anymore. It&rsquo;s not a model. It&rsquo;s not an interest</p>
<p>rate. It&rsquo;s not a discounted set of cash flows, right? And so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they need to refactor themselves. They need to have a</p>
<p>much larger population. If you don&rsquo;t have that, you have to</p>
<p>figure out how to do it with immigration. If you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that, what China has done is they&rsquo;ve tried to go to Southeast</p>
<p>Asia and to Africa. And they&rsquo;ve tried to create that synthetic</p>
<p>form of a growing pyramid, right? Now that can work as long</p>
<p>as the balance sheet of the country supports that because</p>
<p>ultimately, you&rsquo;re still talking about moving money offshore.</p>
<p>Okay. So I think they&rsquo;re in a little bit of a they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in a pretty difficult spot. The most difficult spot is the one</p>
<p>they that she put them in. If you get rid of entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>if you get rid of high growth companies that create the</p>
<p>opportunity on a global scale, and then you, you know, take DD</p>
<p>off the public markets, you don&rsquo;t let education companies</p>
<p>become public, or you basically get rid of their little</p>
<p>co-opting of capitalism, and venture capital, their whole</p>
<p>their whole society is going to become slow growth and slow</p>
<p>growth in a country that doesn&rsquo;t have safety nets is really</p>
<p>dangerous. sacks your thoughts, in terms of competition versus</p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>Okay, let me get to the competition in a second, just a</p>
<p>bill in which ma said the the birth rate that were the</p>
<p>fertility rate in China slipped to just 1.15. In 2021. So last</p>
<p>year, it takes 2.1 just to maintain your population or</p>
<p>replacement level. So and this is lower than even Japan, which</p>
<p>is also shrinking as it could Japan&rsquo;s about 1.3. The US</p>
<p>Australia are at 1.6. But we get above 2.1 because of</p>
<p>immigration and China doesn&rsquo;t have that. So they&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>huge demographic problem to most point, it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>something like, well, the population is shrinking by 40%</p>
<p>with every generation. That&rsquo;s what these numbers imply. And</p>
<p>saying the numbers are, it&rsquo;s gonna be under 600 million by</p>
<p>the year 2100. But I would, I don&rsquo;t understand how it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even be less than that, if it keeps going at this</p>
<p>rate. So they&rsquo;re in the commentator, Peter Zeehan has,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the right way of pronouncing Peter</p>
<p>Zion or something. Anyway, he&rsquo;s pointed out that China is</p>
<p>facing demographic collapse in the next decade or so. On top</p>
<p>of that, like you&rsquo;re saying, Jason, that you&rsquo;ve got G</p>
<p>emphasizing Maoist economics, he basically says he thinks</p>
<p>that the Chinese economy, again, he stresses the need for</p>
<p>socialist characteristics. And he seems to be bringing back</p>
<p>that sort of communist ideology to their economy. And they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>basically really cracked down on entrepreneurship and</p>
<p>venture capital. It&rsquo;s really a cell phone. I mean, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>moved away from the policies that have made them so</p>
<p>successful economically over the last 40 years. And then on</p>
<p>top of that, you got this debt crisis in this housing crisis.</p>
<p>So it really looks like the deck is stacked against all of</p>
<p>them. And you&rsquo;re asking, what does this mean for us? Well, I</p>
<p>think it depends on whether you look at it economically or</p>
<p>geopolitically, I think if you look at it, economically,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s bad for us, because our two economies are</p>
<p>economically linked, there&rsquo;s a lot of dependency, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>evolved together for a long period of time. And they&rsquo;re if</p>
<p>China has a collapse, then that they&rsquo;re so big now that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to have, I think, global repercussions, there&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be contagion. But the truth is, if you look at it</p>
<p>geopolitically, and geopolitics is more of a zero, the balance</p>
<p>of power is a zero sum game, economics can be a positive sum</p>
<p>game, but, but the balance of power is, it&rsquo;s definitely not a</p>
<p>positive sum game. You&rsquo;d have to say it&rsquo;s good for us. Because</p>
<p>the reason why China has become such a threat is because of its</p>
<p>growing economy over the last 40 years. Yep. And look, I mean,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;ve done and what they&rsquo;ve been doing over the last</p>
<p>decade or so is translating their economic might into</p>
<p>military might. And that has given them the capability to now</p>
<p>threaten their neighbors to become more belligerent, to</p>
<p>basically rattle the saber against Taiwan. And if their</p>
<p>growth, if their impressive economic growth continues for</p>
<p>the next couple of decades, as it has until now, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>question that they will, they will basically try to assert</p>
<p>their hegemony over East Asia. And Taiwan will be a huge</p>
<p>flashpoint. But there&rsquo;s also flashpoints in the East China</p>
<p>Sea with Japan over the</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going to need a bankroll to do that. So if they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, if their economy is not growing, they don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>bankroll to do it, they&rsquo;re going to have to look inward and say,</p>
<p>Hey, we got to fix these domestic problems. We got to get</p>
<p>people stop protesting these streets, we need to this middle</p>
<p>class is demanding of jobs. The great news for what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>in China. And I think this is why the people there are very</p>
<p>happy is the number of people living in poverty has plummeted,</p>
<p>you know, when they started tracking this data in the 80s,</p>
<p>you know, high 90% of people were living in extreme poverty</p>
<p>or poverty 99% of people were in poverty on the on the global</p>
<p>definition of it. And now, you know, it&rsquo;s just plummeted to,</p>
<p>you know, a couple 100 million people. So a couple of charts</p>
<p>for you here, but just in the data is obviously it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to understand what&rsquo;s going on in China, because a lot of it is</p>
<p>opaque. But just the number of people on a percentage basis</p>
<p>living in poverty has gone. And now the number of people who are</p>
<p>in the middle class has surged. That creates another dynamic,</p>
<p>those people want to have a great life, they want better</p>
<p>jobs, they don&rsquo;t want to work in factories, they want to have a</p>
<p>more information based economy and a better job than 60 hours a</p>
<p>week in a factory. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re moving their factories</p>
<p>to Africa and other places.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s absolutely true. I think that</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s manufacturing sector is, is aiming to evolve. So you</p>
<p>know, China has about 3 million factories or manufacturing</p>
<p>facilities throughout the country, employing about 112</p>
<p>million people, the US has about 300,000 factories and Paul</p>
<p>employing about 12 and a half million people, the output of</p>
<p>our factories is about 70% of the output of of China&rsquo;s</p>
<p>factories in aggregate, sorry, the total production output of</p>
<p>all the factories. So we have very high value outputs coming</p>
<p>out of our factories and high leverage. China is observing and</p>
<p>obviously recognizes that there&rsquo;s an opportunity probably</p>
<p>to evolve their manufacturing capacity to be higher leverage,</p>
<p>higher value output. And so there is going to be, you know,</p>
<p>from the long range perspective, planning, and investment in</p>
<p>technology that allows those factories to become much more</p>
<p>sophisticated and create much more higher value products</p>
<p>moving up from what is effectively just cheap labor, putting</p>
<p>things together in an assembly plant, to being things like</p>
<p>additive manufacturing, 3d printing, automated manufacturing,</p>
<p>biomanufacturing, etc. And I think this is particularly going</p>
<p>to be realized because China announced that they&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>400 nuclear power plants, that drops the cost of electricity to</p>
<p>under 5 cents a kilowatt hour. In the US, manufacturing</p>
<p>electricity typically costs around 11 cents per kilowatt hour</p>
<p>12 cents per kilowatt hour in that range. So if factories</p>
<p>become much more automated, they start to become a function of</p>
<p>the price of electricity in terms of what they can output,</p>
<p>China is going to have a huge advantage as these nuclear power</p>
<p>plants come online over the next couple of decades, and these</p>
<p>facilities get upgraded. So there is a plan, right? Remember,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t just a plan. And the reason they have that plan,</p>
<p>there is there&rsquo;s a question of, do they get there fast enough</p>
<p>to drive economic growth that actually supports all these</p>
<p>other industries like real estate and finance that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>become critically dependent on, because those industries only</p>
<p>work if there&rsquo;s a core economic driver core economic engine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s working here. So this energy infrastructure, this new</p>
<p>manufacturing infrastructure, these are things that, by the</p>
<p>way, they can do really effectively, because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>working on four year and six year political cycles, they can</p>
<p>take a 510 and 30 year outlook and make a make a plan and</p>
<p>invest against it what they did from night. So I wouldn&rsquo;t count</p>
<p>them out. But there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of challenges they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>facing right now. It&rsquo;s a big question mark right now, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen?</p>
<p>Well, and it to your point, factories in China are, you</p>
<p>know, factory workers getting paid over six bucks an hour now</p>
<p>in Vietnam three in India, even less. And that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing a lot of folks. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re seeing it in your</p>
<p>portfolios. But we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of folks looking at India,</p>
<p>Vietnam, and moving factories there. And obviously, Japan has</p>
<p>been incentivizing China&rsquo;s not going to just lose their</p>
<p>manufacturing edge. They&rsquo;re not just gonna say, hey, we give up</p>
<p>let let everyone go to Vietnam, they&rsquo;re going to try and upgrade</p>
<p>the capability of those factories and say, hey, instead</p>
<p>of just putting together, you know, parts for with $6 an hour</p>
<p>human labor, let&rsquo;s start to do the more sophisticated. So then</p>
<p>the next card that turns is well, what happens to those</p>
<p>factory workers if they&rsquo;ve been automated out? What do you do</p>
<p>with hundreds of millions of people working in factories who</p>
<p>now have been turned into robots? And then if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be in an in the answer is information economy, if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be an information economy, you need venture</p>
<p>capital, and you need new companies to create those jobs.</p>
<p>And they just killed that. So I don&rsquo;t know what strategy she is</p>
<p>pursuing here. But it seems like a bad one.</p>
<p>We could talk about this one at length. But we were going to</p>
<p>bring this up. But you know, generally speaking, technology</p>
<p>drives productivity gains, but it&rsquo;s deflationary.</p>
<p>Explain what that means on in like a practical sense, maybe,</p>
<p>you know, that the technology.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, let&rsquo;s say that you have to pay a bunch of people to</p>
<p>make a t shirt. And then a machine is built that makes the</p>
<p>t shirt, the cost of the t shirt goes down. Because one machine</p>
<p>can just print out 100 t shirts an hour, whereas it would take</p>
<p>five people, you know, 10 hours to make those hundred t shirts</p>
<p>or whatever it is, right. So a technology of kind of emerges.</p>
<p>And those people are now theoretically out of jobs. But</p>
<p>what ends up happening is those people transition into new jobs</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t exist before, and we end up seeing higher order</p>
<p>work take place. Think about the the world 200 years ago, do you</p>
<p>think we would have had any concept of people being uber</p>
<p>drivers, or people, you know, creating crafts and selling them</p>
<p>on Etsy, or YouTubers, content creators, people being yoga</p>
<p>teachers or yoga, or yoga teachers, psychotherapists, only</p>
<p>okay, well, there you go. Only fans or dog walkers, or all of</p>
<p>these, these service businesses, or, you know,</p>
<p>industries that simply did not exist before. And so the labor</p>
<p>that those that that percentage of the population was involved</p>
<p>in historically has gone away, because it&rsquo;s been automated. As</p>
<p>that automation has happened, it&rsquo;s allowed higher order</p>
<p>services jobs to emerge. And that will be the progression of</p>
<p>humanity forever. I will tell you guys, I was going to mention</p>
<p>this. Have you guys played with Dolly too? Yeah, the other day?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. I got the login. I was my brother in law was</p>
<p>visiting, we were playing with Dolly too. And making funny</p>
<p>kind of explain what it is. Yep. So Dolly too is developed</p>
<p>by open AI. We all know Sam Altman, he&rsquo;s been leading that</p>
<p>organization to great effect over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>And, and what they&rsquo;re doing is they basically scan the web for</p>
<p>images, tag them, and then applied, you know, machine</p>
<p>learning to, you know, to basically allow natural</p>
<p>language creation of images from scratch. So the AI can</p>
<p>generate an image. And you can go to, you know, the internet</p>
<p>and look at a bunch of these, but the imagery is incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, the creative output, what feels like creative output</p>
<p>from the system, where you just say, hey, you know, make me an</p>
<p>image of four guys doing a podcast on zoom in the style of</p>
<p>Van Gogh. And it creates this image that is unique has never</p>
<p>been created or seen on earth before, and is a function of</p>
<p>the, the learning that&rsquo;s been done in these neural networks to</p>
<p>develop this AI that can that can create novel stuff is really</p>
<p>amazing. And I started to think about like, what are the</p>
<p>implications for this over time? Think about, you know, the</p>
<p>original movie Ben Hur in today&rsquo;s dollars would have cost</p>
<p>a billion dollars to make, they had thousands of people, I think</p>
<p>10s of 1000s of people on that set, it took years to make, they</p>
<p>built giant sets, they can only, you know, make one film. It was</p>
<p>an incredible feat and an effort. That&rsquo;s what movie making</p>
<p>is, you know, still today, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s teams of people.</p>
<p>Now, what if you could speak to the AI and say, make photo</p>
<p>realistic, you know, Jason and Chamath having a battle on a</p>
<p>field in the middle of nowhere, and now an airplane flies over,</p>
<p>and you can instruct the AI and the AI can generate photo</p>
<p>realistic visuals, audio, the AI can even generate scripts and</p>
<p>narrative for you. It&rsquo;s really starts to change the role of the</p>
<p>creator, the director, the director is no longer doing this</p>
<p>thing where they have to get it just right, make the perfect 90</p>
<p>minutes, and then line up all the money and all the people to</p>
<p>do that work on that plan on that program, they can be much</p>
<p>more iterative, and they can be much more creative on the fly,</p>
<p>they can create a two hour movie by speaking to the AI, and</p>
<p>then edit the movie by speaking to the AI, change the actors,</p>
<p>change the color, change the voices, change the music, just</p>
<p>speaking to AI to generate creative output, and people will</p>
<p>consume that output. And I think it&rsquo;s amazing to think about what</p>
<p>creators will end up doing 10 years from now, as AI and these</p>
<p>tools proliferate, and you see version 12 of this, which is</p>
<p>version two, and what version 12 might enable. And so the role,</p>
<p>the number of people that can do that job goes from Steven</p>
<p>Spielberg, and Bob Zemeckis, and a few other people to suddenly</p>
<p>1000s or 10s of 1000s of people around the world making</p>
<p>incredible movies.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s Dolly&rsquo;s image was pull it up of four guys doing a</p>
<p>podcast. So we have a ways to go. But yeah, that is four guys</p>
<p>doing a podcast. I mean, and to your point, like, you know, this</p>
<p>is gonna we&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>So a lot of people are like, Oh, is this going to wipe out</p>
<p>graphic designers? Is it going to wipe out the creative</p>
<p>industry? But the reality is, the roles that those people are</p>
<p>in today will absolutely be gone, but they will emerge and</p>
<p>evolve into new roles that we never even thought imaginable,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have will really transform that industry and</p>
<p>society. And this is going to be true across everywhere that AI</p>
<p>touches. Yeah. And I think China, China, as China steps up</p>
<p>their technology in manufacturing, you&rsquo;ll see those,</p>
<p>you know, new markets evolve. Sorry, Jamal, go ahead.</p>
<p>designers will have less leverage to ask for all this</p>
<p>stupid snacks and offices of startups.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you need only look at designers are the worst,</p>
<p>my god.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the best. I love but anyway, in the 1940s, I mean,</p>
<p>there were literally hundreds of 1000s of telephone operators.</p>
<p>It was totally and totally, they&rsquo;re all gone now. And not</p>
<p>only that,</p>
<p>have you ever met a designer that didn&rsquo;t take themselves</p>
<p>incredibly seriously that didn&rsquo;t have like, you know, tea</p>
<p>that they would see the bad one, you know,</p>
<p>good one.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have like steel straws, you know, video game designers</p>
<p>are a little different. I&rsquo;m sorry, what did you say about</p>
<p>the steel straws?</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>I am eliminating waste in my life. I mentioned to you guys.</p>
<p>Last year, this video game I played over Christmas by Anna</p>
<p>Perna pictures, and the guy that runs the studio sent me a</p>
<p>DM, he loves the pod. Oh, that&rsquo;s nice. And they just launched a</p>
<p>new video game, which I started playing a couple nights ago</p>
<p>called stray. And you literally at you, you play the game as a</p>
<p>cat lost in some crazy world. You&rsquo;re literally a cat. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome. The imagery on this thing is unbelievable. Actually,</p>
<p>my favorite game right now saxes I play a cat and I&rsquo;m a stray</p>
<p>cat. And it&rsquo;s really amazing. The AI I you know, it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>hard to go play the game. Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna take a hard pass on</p>
<p>that. I like to play a game where I&rsquo;m a stray dog and I meet</p>
<p>another dog. And then we eat a bowl of pasta. But this long</p>
<p>string of pasta, we each come closer and closer, then we end</p>
<p>up kissing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to do we want to go BlackRock has lost $1.7</p>
<p>trillion in six months. VC funding is down. Or Amazon</p>
<p>acquires one medical for 3.9 billion. Which which one do we</p>
<p>want to go to next? Anybody have a favorite here? Sachs? You&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been a little quiet. You got one you want to go to?</p>
<p>We can talk about the BlackRock thing.</p>
<p>This is the largest amount of money lost by a single firm over</p>
<p>a six month period in history. BlackRock is the world&rsquo;s largest</p>
<p>asset manager. And it was the first firm to break $10 trillion</p>
<p>in AUM assets under management. Not right now they&rsquo;re at 8.4</p>
<p>trillion 2022 ranks as the worst start in 50 years for both</p>
<p>stocks and bonds. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry</p>
<p>Fink said on his earnings call at the end of June, only about a</p>
<p>quarter of its assets were actively managed to beat a</p>
<p>benchmark rather than track it seamlessly as passive strategies</p>
<p>are designed to do. Firm&rsquo;s passive equity holdings are now</p>
<p>10 times larger than its active holdings, although it does</p>
<p>operate some active multi asset and alternative strategies that</p>
<p>narrow the gap. Collapse in bond markets this year has shaken</p>
<p>money out of active fixed income funds.</p>
<p>Listen, I think there&rsquo;s less than meets the eye here with</p>
<p>this. I think this was a headline that was trying to grab</p>
<p>attention by saying biggest loss ever. Look, the reason why it</p>
<p>was the biggest loss ever is because BlackRock is so big. I</p>
<p>mean, and what is BlackRock? It&rsquo;s basically at this point,</p>
<p>their index funds, their ETFs, their index funds. They just</p>
<p>represent market indices. So, you know, the reason why it went</p>
<p>down 1.7 trillion is because it started with 10 trillion. So</p>
<p>the average index is down 17%. That&rsquo;s all it means. We know</p>
<p>this. The S&amp;P 500 is down 20%, 22% for the year. The Dow Jones</p>
<p>down 15 ish. The NASDAQ is down like 30. So this is just</p>
<p>reflecting what we already know, which is that the stock market</p>
<p>is down this year. Do you think it&rsquo;s another data point to</p>
<p>support the idea that active managers, generally speaking,</p>
<p>and maybe holistically speaking, over time, cannot be the, you</p>
<p>know, the market cannot beat indices. I mean, you have a</p>
<p>point of view on that as an investor sex.</p>
<p>Well, I think, you know, you&rsquo;re talking about public market</p>
<p>investors. I think it&rsquo;s very hard. I think it&rsquo;s very hard to</p>
<p>beat the public markets over a long period of time</p>
<p>consistently. I just think it is now. You know, the</p>
<p>contradiction, though, is if you have no active managers,</p>
<p>then the indices won&rsquo;t be efficient anymore. So you need</p>
<p>the participation of the active managers to help drive the</p>
<p>indices and make corrections to it. So and the fewer active</p>
<p>strategies you have, the more inefficient the markets will</p>
<p>become thereby inviting active strategies. So, you know, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a good question. I think there are some managers</p>
<p>who are who can probably do it. But I think it&rsquo;s a very tough</p>
<p>thing to do.</p>
<p>Tim off. What do you think you&rsquo;re a public investor, active</p>
<p>selector of</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this. I think that I</p>
<p>have disproportionately benefited from being at the</p>
<p>right place at the right time, backed by enormous amounts of</p>
<p>central bank money. And so I think we all have been. I think</p>
<p>it is very difficult to be a public market individual stock</p>
<p>picker in a world where the central banks are constantly</p>
<p>meddling. Because when they do, the best thing that you can do</p>
<p>is belong the market beta. And the more concentrated you are,</p>
<p>the better returns you would have delivered since 2008, when</p>
<p>the central bank started to get very aggressively involved.</p>
<p>When individual stock pickers reigned, the universe was when</p>
<p>central banks were largely on the sidelines. And so there was</p>
<p>all kinds of dispersion, right dispersion, meaning good</p>
<p>outcomes, bad outcomes, lots of alpha, right, meaning your</p>
<p>performance was independent of the market. But since 2008, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>largely been beta that&rsquo;s driven the market. And the folks that</p>
<p>have done exceedingly well were those in tech because we</p>
<p>delivered the best beta. And every time we confuse alpha and</p>
<p>beta, we get over our ski tips. And there&rsquo;s always some big out,</p>
<p>you know, blow up.</p>
<p>So I think my general takeaway is that if the central banks stay</p>
<p>on the sidelines, individual stock picking reigns, and active</p>
<p>management can win. If they continue to be involved, and do</p>
<p>quantitative easing and all of this other stuff.</p>
<p>Index funds that are long concentrated market beta will</p>
<p>always outperform in the long run.</p>
<p>I was watching Warren Buffett answer some questions. And one</p>
<p>of the questions, and this goes to the law of big numbers, like</p>
<p>BlackRock, he was saying, Listen, the reason I did better</p>
<p>earlier in my career than later in my career on a percentage</p>
<p>basis is because I was placing at a smaller amount of capital.</p>
<p>And I was placing it on smaller bets, smaller ideas and themes.</p>
<p>And then as I had a bigger chip sack, I had to find bigger ideas</p>
<p>to put more money to work. And therefore more people were</p>
<p>looking at those. And so those assets were not undervalued. And</p>
<p>so I found that very, like, insightful, in terms of when you</p>
<p>participate in the market, if you&rsquo;re trying to pick between</p>
<p>very large bets, like CO2, and TPG, and Tiger, we&rsquo;re doing in</p>
<p>the growth space acts. Like, now, everybody knows that these</p>
<p>companies, everybody knows stripes a winner, everybody knew</p>
<p>Airbnb and Uber were winners, you know, in the late stage of</p>
<p>the private, everybody knew Facebook was a winner in late</p>
<p>stage private market. If you&rsquo;re battling that out, you know,</p>
<p>URI Milner is going to come over the top and pay 2 billion</p>
<p>more than you or Masi Yoshi son is going to pay five or $10</p>
<p>billion more than you. Where is the alpha there? You know, where</p>
<p>where is the gain? And I was in the fees. Okay, there you go.</p>
<p>And so they were playing a different game. And that&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, I started trading this past two weeks, because I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never traded public stocks, and I wanted to add it as a skill</p>
<p>set. So I put a couple million bucks into an account. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just trying to actively figure out how does value work there.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m just starting to make trades that I want to</p>
<p>hold for 10 or 20 years. And we&rsquo;ll see if I can beat the</p>
<p>market. That&rsquo;s the other thing is, what do you want to spend</p>
<p>your life doing if the index, if you can put money in a passive</p>
<p>index, and not do any work? Well, you know, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attractive as well. So sacks, what do you think in terms of</p>
<p>active management? You know, in these public markets and the</p>
<p>size of the bets that have to be said, I think it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to beat the market consistently. I think it&rsquo;s a very tough</p>
<p>profession. I&rsquo;m sure there are people who can do it. But I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s easy to predict who those people are. So</p>
<p>look, I, you know, I think it&rsquo;s something that can be done. But</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a tough, tough game. I mean, what we do as</p>
<p>private investors is a little different, right? Because not</p>
<p>everybody is in a position to buy shares, right? So not</p>
<p>available to you don&rsquo;t even know the company access is limited,</p>
<p>and information is limited. And in exchange for that sort of</p>
<p>preferential access that we get, we actually have to do</p>
<p>work. So when you&rsquo;re when Yeah, when you&rsquo;re a public investor,</p>
<p>in a company, Disney, or whatever, you don&rsquo;t do any work,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not involved at all. We do a lot of work for the</p>
<p>companies. And that&rsquo;s why they choose us. And so it&rsquo;s not, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re not competing against the whole world. I</p>
<p>think the public markets are just so competitive.</p>
<p>Are you tempted, though, looking at these prices, and</p>
<p>because I was looking at a company that was trading at 50</p>
<p>times revenue last year, they&rsquo;re raising again, they double</p>
<p>their revenue. So now they&rsquo;re at 2025 times revenue, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>raising out last year&rsquo;s valuation. And then I looked at</p>
<p>the public market comps, and they&rsquo;re trading at six times. So</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m like, wait a second.</p>
<p>You gotta look at the growth rate, you gotta look at the</p>
<p>growth rate was three, the growth rate in this example was</p>
<p>three times fat greater than the public market comps. So how</p>
<p>would you assess that then?</p>
<p>Well, what we&rsquo;re seeing right now is that pretty good SaaS</p>
<p>companies that are growing, you know, maybe on a trailing basis,</p>
<p>they grew three x, and you know, prospectively, they&rsquo;re growing,</p>
<p>call it two and a half x, they&rsquo;re trading right now, not</p>
<p>trading, but basically deals are getting done at 20 times ar 20,</p>
<p>which are this year&rsquo;s current run rate. Yeah, the current ARR</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting that like bonus, like, here&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>projected next year, we&rsquo;re going to give it based on that this</p>
<p>is current. No, no current ARR is about 2022 23 times ARR.</p>
<p>Down from what last year 100.</p>
<p>It was like 100 times was the rule of thumb. So now there are</p>
<p>some where they&rsquo;re, you know, deals are getting done in the</p>
<p>high 20s, I&rsquo;d say, or even 30. If they&rsquo;re, if you believe that</p>
<p>by the end of the year, it&rsquo;ll be more like 20. So but I think</p>
<p>the new levels are landing at 2020 something times ARR. Now,</p>
<p>why does that make sense relative to the public SaaS</p>
<p>companies? Well, like you said, the SAS index is trading at</p>
<p>roughly six times, but that&rsquo;s only 20% average growth, right?</p>
<p>And so, you know, if you&rsquo;re talking about 10 times the</p>
<p>growth, right, and the high growth SaaS companies are</p>
<p>trading at like seven times. That&rsquo;s for like a 40% grower.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this before. So listen, if you&rsquo;re tripling</p>
<p>year over year, and you pay 20 times, that&rsquo;ll be a seven times</p>
<p>next year. But if you&rsquo;re growing to two and a half, three x next</p>
<p>year, that&rsquo;s way faster. So yeah, I think there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>an arbitrage there. I mean, this is why we&rsquo;d like doing private</p>
<p>SaaS investing right now.</p>
<p>Deals are getting done. I will say that the people who I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>seeing who are really struggling, Friedberg are the</p>
<p>people who didn&rsquo;t turn on I&rsquo;m talking about the very early</p>
<p>stage, they didn&rsquo;t turn on revenue, they were making</p>
<p>progress in team building and culture and features, but they</p>
<p>just weren&rsquo;t focused on the revenue side. And my Lord,</p>
<p>people got a lot of credit. I mean, 50 million $100 million</p>
<p>valuations without the revenue turned on. And that now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>faced with not being able to raise money full stop. What are</p>
<p>you seeing on your side, Friedberg in terms of deal flow</p>
<p>in the private markets? Yeah, it&rsquo;s and raising money. Yeah,</p>
<p>because you have to raise money for your company. It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>Okay, unpack it. What&rsquo;s not, you know, well, what are the</p>
<p>conversations like? Give us the anecdotal information.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen a number of term sheets get pulled. So I</p>
<p>think really, yeah, we&rsquo;ve heard a lot about companies that kind</p>
<p>of during the q1 early q2 timeframe, had term sheets</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t closing, got the laid out. And there&rsquo;s a number of</p>
<p>kind of examples of repricing, where the investors come back,</p>
<p>markets have changed, let&rsquo;s reprice the thing. Or, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to do this deal anymore. We&rsquo;re going to sit on</p>
<p>the sidelines and wait till the market settles. Or our LPs</p>
<p>actually aren&rsquo;t going to let us fund new stuff. So there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of those last one for people. What does that mean?</p>
<p>You know, investor, you know, investors have LPs, they have</p>
<p>investors themselves, and their LPs are coming to them and</p>
<p>saying, do not put more money out right now, we are telling</p>
<p>you, we are not going to wire our money to you, we need you to</p>
<p>wait until even though they&rsquo;re contractually obligated to</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re telling you, theoretically, they don&rsquo;t may</p>
<p>not be contractually obligated to, but obviously, these are</p>
<p>long term partnerships. And so when an LP, you know, or a group</p>
<p>of LP says, guys, we&rsquo;re not comfortable with you deploying</p>
<p>money right now, you know, you&rsquo;re in a 10 year partnership,</p>
<p>15 year partnership with them, you&rsquo;re gonna as an as an</p>
<p>investor as a fund, you&rsquo;re gonna say, Okay, I&rsquo;m going to kind of</p>
<p>listen to that right now. Now, the bigger issues in series B,</p>
<p>C, and D, where companies, you know, have some traction, have</p>
<p>some performance have raised a bunch of capital have done a</p>
<p>bunch of work, and investors don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re worth.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, hey, is this thing worth 25 million or 125</p>
<p>million or 500 million? Last year, you could have raised</p>
<p>money at 500 million. I mean, look at what happened with one</p>
<p>of those crypto things. Those crypto trading platforms, they</p>
<p>raised $500 million last July, and they just sold the business</p>
<p>for a reported $25 million after being valued at 5 billion a</p>
<p>year ago. Yeah. So the whole truth might have been more like</p>
<p>275 million. Yeah, we don&rsquo;t know. Yeah. And, and so but</p>
<p>but serious series, a people seem to be pretty active again.</p>
<p>And so active again, but the price is now for seed rounds.</p>
<p>Yeah. But it&rsquo;s a lot easier happening six to 15 series is</p>
<p>happening 15 to 25. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get a deal done in a</p>
<p>series A because people say, Hey, look, I&rsquo;m gonna give you</p>
<p>this. You say, Okay, I&rsquo;ll take it. I need the money. Series B,</p>
<p>C and D is where there&rsquo;s this whole fight because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>existing investors, existing shareholders who are saying I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to take a 50% write down a 70% write down a 30%</p>
<p>write down over the last round, and fighting and then doing</p>
<p>inside rounds and bridge notes, and all sorts of other</p>
<p>shenanigans to not have to take a negative book. Yeah, well,</p>
<p>one thing that&rsquo;s interesting here is that you think about</p>
<p>like where the opportunity is in the market right now. And I</p>
<p>think one of the things that happened in the boom is that</p>
<p>everyone got pushed to go earlier and earlier because</p>
<p>deals were so competitive. And so, you know, in the SaaS</p>
<p>business, normally 1 million of ARR was considered the rule of</p>
<p>thumb for getting a series for basically graduating to a series</p>
<p>A that you&rsquo;re ready to go from C to series A when you had a</p>
<p>million of ARR. As we know, during the boom last year, that</p>
<p>number kept going down, you know, yeah, 300,000. And then</p>
<p>you would see crazy deals get done that were pre revenue with</p>
<p>price at 100. Plus, we never did any of those kinds of deals</p>
<p>because we just thought they&rsquo;re too crazy, but they definitely</p>
<p>happen. Well, think about the dynamic now, which is, let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>that that SaaS startup that has a million of ARR, they can do a</p>
<p>series A at 50. Or we can just wait until they get to 5 million</p>
<p>of ARR, and then pay 20 times and do it at 100 pre, which of</p>
<p>those is the better risk adjusted return? Let me tell you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of risk in going from 1 million ARR to 5 million</p>
<p>ARR. It&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s hard. There&rsquo;s a lot of things. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just you&rsquo;re not doing it through the founders. Yeah, you need to</p>
<p>start scaling a team, you need a real sales capacity. But also,</p>
<p>a lot of startups that could sort of hack together and</p>
<p>cobble together 1 million of ARR, based on non scalable</p>
<p>techniques that various startup incubators teach like, you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do things that don&rsquo;t scale. It&rsquo;s okay to do that from</p>
<p>zero to one, but not one to 10. Right? Well, well, or it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not okay. It&rsquo;s just that it doesn&rsquo;t work, right?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to cobble together 5 million of</p>
<p>ARR, you can cobble together 1 million of ARR, you can use the</p>
<p>cheat code to get there. So what I&rsquo;m saying is, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>risk in going from one to five, you find out whether the</p>
<p>product&rsquo;s really scalable. So what is the better deal? Wait</p>
<p>till 100. Wait till it&rsquo;s priced at 100 or 120 million pre or</p>
<p>doing the deal at 40 to 50. Now, if you love that, if you love</p>
<p>the company, you want to get in as early as possible. But I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re going to start seeing a dynamic where in the</p>
<p>same way that last year, everyone earlier and earlier,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see VC start to sit back and go a little later</p>
<p>and later prove it to us. A dead man&rsquo;s own. Nobody should be</p>
<p>putting money into deals right now. What is it? Why? What does</p>
<p>it do? Unless unless you&rsquo;re in the business, unless you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the business of running a fee generating machine, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really trying to generate alpha, you have to have a sense</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s actually happening in the world right now. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just trying to deliver the market beta and run an index,</p>
<p>then yeah, you&rsquo;re right, you should ignore this idea that</p>
<p>there could be more price adjustments. But if you look at</p>
<p>the public markets, which is again, the ultimate terminal</p>
<p>buyer, they have more cash than they ever had since 2008. Which</p>
<p>means that there is no reason to buy. You&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>private companies, it all ultimately ends up in the</p>
<p>public markets. And so if the public markets are saying there</p>
<p>is no reason to buy this stuff, it trickles down. So then the</p>
<p>crossover investor who has a public private business says,</p>
<p>you know what, on the public side, I&rsquo;m completely de-risked</p>
<p>and in cash. And so on the private side, I&rsquo;ll just be a</p>
<p>little bit more circumspect and wait, as David said, I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>wait six months and put even more money in later, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually have a better IRR, and I&rsquo;ll make the same profit</p>
<p>dollars. So then the series B and C firm who used to feed</p>
<p>those deals to the crossover folks are like, oh, well, if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waiting, I don&rsquo;t want to have to write a check to</p>
<p>support these folks. My whole point was to have you mark up</p>
<p>the deal so I could raise a new fund. They slow down. And then</p>
<p>that goes back to the series A person who&rsquo;s like, well, wait a</p>
<p>minute. You know, the reason I paid it at 50 pre was because I</p>
<p>thought you&rsquo;d step in and buy it at 100. And then they slow</p>
<p>down. So all I&rsquo;m saying is, I think that we are at the point</p>
<p>of the cycle where constipation is setting it. And this is why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing such a downtick in deal velocity and dollars put</p>
<p>to work. This is great advice. I want everybody to take, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to take the opposite advice. And I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>twice as many deals in the seed stage as everybody else. But I</p>
<p>encourage every venture capitalist and seed fund to take</p>
<p>advice. I&rsquo;m doing the opposite because a five person company,</p>
<p>this is an advice. This is just a market observation. I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>telling you, I hope everybody takes that as the truth. Because</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m seeing is the founders who are raising and who have</p>
<p>real businesses are so sharp right now and so focused on</p>
<p>costs, and profits, and what matters and they have eliminated</p>
<p>all the shit that doesn&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s a whole contingent. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re seeing it sacks. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s one out of</p>
<p>five, one out of four that are like, I understand what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening here. And I&rsquo;m going to take advantage of this moment</p>
<p>in time. And I&rsquo;m going to just drive revenue and profit. What</p>
<p>happens to the $250 billion that&rsquo;s been put to work in the</p>
<p>last two years that need to get up rounds? Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter to me. All I care about is meeting young companies that</p>
<p>are growing with revenue. But I think they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>trying to have I&rsquo;m not trying to have a conversation. Yeah,</p>
<p>yeah. No, I know. I&rsquo;m just that&rsquo;s a lot of indigestion.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re gonna have to cut their staffs by half and get to</p>
<p>profitability. Ultimately, the way that valuations matter, or</p>
<p>price levels matter is there&rsquo;s an entry price and an exit</p>
<p>price. And ideally, if you can time it right, you want to</p>
<p>invest when valuation levels are low. And you want to exit when</p>
<p>valuation levels are high. If you were a VC last year, you</p>
<p>should have been realizing as much as you can, because</p>
<p>valuation levels are really high. There was a good tweet by</p>
<p>one of Breckers&rsquo;s colleagues at Altimeter, basically saying she</p>
<p>was talking to LPS and asking what they care about. And what</p>
<p>she reported LPS is saying is that if you&rsquo;re a fund, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more than five years old, and you didn&rsquo;t distribute during the</p>
<p>best Yep, window ever, which was 2018 to 2021. It&rsquo;s a hard No,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re not going to be re upping with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it even more. If you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re a venture investor who</p>
<p>took a longitudinal view on public market stocks, and then</p>
<p>have now seen 60 to 70% write downs of those same stocks that</p>
<p>you could have distributed, you should still have something to</p>
<p>answer to that makes no sense. It turns out that the skill of</p>
<p>private market investing and the skill of public market</p>
<p>investing are different. Even if all you&rsquo;re doing is delivering</p>
<p>the market beta, it&rsquo;s still different. And we had this</p>
<p>discussion last year, remember, I was saying, should I</p>
<p>distribute the shares of Robin Hood? Should I hold them? What</p>
<p>should I be doing? We told you to distribute and I distributed</p>
<p>I distributed everything, you know, and, and in terms of</p>
<p>secondary, I feel particularly like a genius now, because your</p>
<p>LP should say thank you, Jason. No, I mean, some of them are</p>
<p>saying that what I feel smart about, I&rsquo;ll be honest is, we</p>
<p>had, I think, let&rsquo;s just say, I&rsquo;m making up a number four to</p>
<p>five times, we were offered the opportunity to trim our</p>
<p>positions in secondary, with our winners, from people who wanted</p>
<p>to buy secondary shares, I did it probably four to five times.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just kicking myself, I didn&rsquo;t do it the fifth, or I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t ask if they would take more. Because my god, we were</p>
<p>able to clear some positions at very high valuations that are</p>
<p>now lower than that in the private markets and send cash</p>
<p>to our LPS and get our, you know, get over our hurdles in</p>
<p>our first two funds. Which, you know, I feel smart about, I</p>
<p>think that you should feel so, so good about that. That is,</p>
<p>that is really hard what you did. And I think people</p>
<p>underestimate how hard it is, it is really hard to actually</p>
<p>return more money than you have taken it. Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just what I&rsquo;m focused on that simple statement. And, and by</p>
<p>the way, it was hard in the last 10 years, where we&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>basically a massive upmarket and the four of us, frankly</p>
<p>benefited from the extraordinary luck of being in</p>
<p>tech. Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s super lucky. I think the big thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to happen right now, I&rsquo;m seeing it all over the</p>
<p>place is M&amp;A, I think is going to start ticking up just today,</p>
<p>Amazon acquired one medical for 3.9 billion, one medical</p>
<p>operates a network of clinics, if you don&rsquo;t know $3.9 billion</p>
<p>enterprise value for 182 franchises, which is 21 million</p>
<p>a franchise, look at what happened to their look what</p>
<p>happened to their stock price. No, I know I went from 60 in the</p>
<p>peak in February of 2021 to seven in May, and they bought it</p>
<p>basically bought it the same price it was trading out in</p>
<p>January. No, my point is, you could buy a McDonald&rsquo;s franchise</p>
<p>for 2 million, or you could buy the company that fixes the</p>
<p>people that needed McDonald&rsquo;s for 21 million. That&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>got by the way, at McDonald&rsquo;s, you can&rsquo;t make money selling</p>
<p>pharmaceuticals and upselling, you know, other stuff that</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s gonna certainly I think it&rsquo;s super interesting that I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s super interesting that Amazon&rsquo;s getting into this</p>
<p>business. Wow. I mean, they clearly have a an economic model</p>
<p>that shows some significant footprint and retail footprint.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and there may also be kind of a supplement</p>
<p>pharmaceutical kind of upgrade opportunity. There&rsquo;s synergy in</p>
<p>this business. And think about the synergy between what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting is also not just the physical locations, but a</p>
<p>network of doctors that can do telehealth. I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>guys have ever used one medical, but they do really, you know,</p>
<p>easy zoom telehealth services. And so you could hop on, get a</p>
<p>prescription, have it fulfilled by Amazon, it shows up at your</p>
<p>doorstep in under an hour genius, it&rsquo;ll be an incredible</p>
<p>synergy for that business, and probably a real value driver,</p>
<p>not just at the core units, but with respect to other things</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to sell through your one medical doctor will</p>
<p>provision a blood test, he or she will analyze those blood</p>
<p>tests over a telehealth, they will prescribe a better diet</p>
<p>that will be sent to Whole Foods, who will then I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious. And then medicine is eating at home, Amazon, it</p>
<p>makes so much sense for Amazon to expand into built out retail</p>
<p>footprints, because that business model now gets more and</p>
<p>more complete by the day where you become so ingrained and</p>
<p>enmeshed in this. This is really about at the end of the day is</p>
<p>the subscription business, Amazon Prime is the driver of</p>
<p>Amazon. That&rsquo;s gonna be yet another Amazon Prime lock in. So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re I know it sounds silly, but today, it&rsquo;s all about your</p>
<p>subscription. But I will bet you got I will bet you guys $1</p>
<p>that within a year after closing the deal, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>massively expand the telehealth footprint of what we&rsquo;re medical</p>
<p>is doing percent because one medical had to go out and do</p>
<p>customer acquisition to go and acquire customers to make money</p>
<p>doing telehealth services. And they&rsquo;re spending $1,000 probably</p>
<p>CPA to acquire these customers. Amazon wanted to do this. Why</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t Google Amazon&rsquo;s already got the Amazon&rsquo;s already got the</p>
<p>customers. They&rsquo;ve got 70 million everybody. By the way,</p>
<p>I think another thing I know another doesn&rsquo;t know how to do</p>
<p>messy things in the physical world. They don&rsquo;t know how to do</p>
<p>service. I mean, Amazon&rsquo;s been working warehouses. What about</p>
<p>Apple? Apple knows how to do stores. They know how to do</p>
<p>four products in a beautifully designed $20 billion services</p>
<p>business. Amazon knows how to get in the nitty gritty and the</p>
<p>nuts and bolts. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, real world stuff. The</p>
<p>other thing that&rsquo;s really interesting about this Amazon</p>
<p>deal is that it was done with Bezos not at the helm. And I</p>
<p>think it really, you know, begs the question and begs an answer</p>
<p>around, are these guys going to continue to innovate like this?</p>
<p>And I think right now the jury&rsquo;s saying yes, they are going to</p>
<p>continue to push the synergies they can drive from this</p>
<p>business by expanding into ancillary services and industry.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really impressive to see them doing this without</p>
<p>without Bezos running the day to day as a shareholder. I feel</p>
<p>that. So really great to see. Yeah, I mean, this is where like</p>
<p>they could buy DoorDash, Uber, Lyft, those kind of real world</p>
<p>services. They&rsquo;re buying a cheap asset. They&rsquo;re buying it just</p>
<p>like they did with Whole Foods. They&rsquo;re buying an asset that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get tremendous leverage and synergy out of very</p>
<p>cheap. They&rsquo;re buying this company at the same price. It</p>
<p>was trading at a few months ago. Yeah, no, no, it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>deal. They have a great CEO at One Medical who&rsquo;s a friend of</p>
<p>mine, Amir Rubin. Congrats. Shout out. Congrats. Yeah. All</p>
<p>right, everybody. Did you wet your beak sucks? No, I never I</p>
<p>never wet my beak in this deal. Dry beak syndrome. No, I would</p>
<p>just learn from DBS. By the way, I&rsquo;d be taking a victory lap</p>
<p>right now if I was in that company. I missed it. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>shocked. We haven&rsquo;t seen the J Cal victory lap. He goes on some</p>
<p>podcast tells Bloomberg that VCs are going to get pinched for</p>
<p>insider trading all these tokens and lo and behold on the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal. Three guys, I guess a guy at Coinbase got</p>
<p>pinched for basically insider trading these token sales</p>
<p>front running it by buying them in his wallet and stuff. And so</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your victory?</p>
<p>That would be our reoccurring joke.</p>
<p>Do you want to take your victory lap? Well, no, I mean, I told</p>
<p>everybody like if it&rsquo;s if it smells like a security and</p>
<p>people are buying it for that reason for it to appreciate</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be surprised if the SEC, you know, starts having tips</p>
<p>dropped on them that different VC firms in cahoots with law</p>
<p>firms in cahoots with everybody were liquidating their</p>
<p>positions. We talked about liquidating positions as being</p>
<p>the goal of venture capital. They created a shadow economy</p>
<p>next to securities law and said we&rsquo;re going to just start</p>
<p>liquidating these things but under what they made the rules</p>
<p>up under which they could liquidate them. I&rsquo;m not picking</p>
<p>on any firm or anybody we&rsquo;ll see over time who gets pinched. But</p>
<p>you know, if you decide you&rsquo;re going to talk yourself into</p>
<p>this is not a security, even though it kind of feels like</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s on you. That&rsquo;s on you as the person buying the</p>
<p>tokens, issuing the tokens, giving the legal briefs on the</p>
<p>tokens. I think people suspended disbelief and talk themselves</p>
<p>into thinking that they weren&rsquo;t trading securities. And I think</p>
<p>the SEC now that everybody&rsquo;s lost their money is going to</p>
<p>just tick off one firm after another, and it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>massive settlements, it&rsquo;s going to be three or four years of</p>
<p>litigation. So it&rsquo;s not a victory lap. It&rsquo;s just it was</p>
<p>such an obvious observation. We all saw it. I mean, how do you</p>
<p>liquidate up your shares in a company that has no product in</p>
<p>the world? Like, come on. Come on people knew what they were</p>
<p>doing. And if they get the book thrown out on they deserve it.</p>
<p>All right, everybody. This has been another amazing episode,</p>
<p>even though sacks is going to say it&rsquo;s the worst one. I like</p>
<p>it. I do. That&rsquo;s a lake. Is that real? That&rsquo;s late? Is that a</p>
<p>zoom background? Can I get that new zoom pack? Take a photo so</p>
<p>we can all use it. Love you, boys. Love you besties. All</p>
<p>right, we&rsquo;re back. Back at you.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
