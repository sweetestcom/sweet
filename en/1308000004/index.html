with Jason Kalacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya.
We record this podcast, well,
on a really unique schedule, Chamath.
What&amp;rsquo;s our schedule right now, whenever we feel like it?
Basically, it is whenever our significant others
get so sick of us that they kick us off
and say, don&amp;rsquo;t come back.
Yeah, we get thrown to the pool house.
We decide to pop up the podcast.'>

    <p>Hey, everybody, welcome to the All In Podcast</p>
<p>with Jason Kalacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>We record this podcast, well,</p>
<p>on a really unique schedule, Chamath.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s our schedule right now, whenever we feel like it?</p>
<p>Basically, it is whenever our significant others</p>
<p>get so sick of us that they kick us off</p>
<p>and say, don&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>Yeah, we get thrown to the pool house.</p>
<p>We decide to pop up the podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in Atherton.</p>
<p>I am in the city in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Thank you, Duke of Discretion.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like to do?</p>
<p>Tell them my address, my gate code.</p>
<p>Gate code, out the fence.</p>
<p>You know, we had two guests on</p>
<p>that people just went absolutely crazy for,</p>
<p>the two Davids. But they weren&rsquo;t available, so.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna talk shit about them.</p>
<p>No, we have two amazing Davids in our lives,</p>
<p>David Friedberg and David Sachs,</p>
<p>and they are super smart, super effective at their work,</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;re not, Chamath.</p>
<p>And so we thought we&rsquo;d bring them back on the podcast,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll do a little round table here</p>
<p>and talk about life in the age of Corona.</p>
<p>So welcome back to the podcast, David Sachs.</p>
<p>Yeah, good to be back with you.</p>
<p>And also David Friedberg.</p>
<p>Thank you guys, happy to be here.</p>
<p>All right, fantastic.</p>
<p>So I just wanna start off with our quar check.</p>
<p>How is everybody doing in this quarantine?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s mental health?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with you, Sachs.</p>
<p>Well, as you might be able to see,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve moved our bunker to a undisclosed Mexican location.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been great.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really kind of sad</p>
<p>because where we&rsquo;re at is a tourist city</p>
<p>that would normally be at peak season,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just deserted right now.</p>
<p>All the construction stopped.</p>
<p>Normally you see lots of hotels and houses being built,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all stopped.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no tourists,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s all just kind of cleared out.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s quite safe.</p>
<p>Every worker that I&rsquo;ve seen here</p>
<p>since we landed at the airport got transported</p>
<p>to the community we&rsquo;re at has been wearing a mask,</p>
<p>much more consistent than I think in the US.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s been fine.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you founded the Kraft Venture Capital firm,</p>
<p>and people know before that you obviously did Yammer</p>
<p>and sold that to Microsoft for a billion dollars plus.</p>
<p>And before that, you were the COO at PayPal.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with your business?</p>
<p>Are you actively investing?</p>
<p>And how is your firm running remote?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worked very well.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve always been super collaborative as a firm.</p>
<p>We were already on Zoom,</p>
<p>and we share everything on Yammer.</p>
<p>And so for us, just moving to Zoom wasn&rsquo;t that difficult.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done four or five deals, I think,</p>
<p>since the whole kind of quarantine started.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Did you say that you actually use Yammer now in 2020?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still using it.</p>
<p>Oh my God, is Yammer still available?</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of gotten a little bit buried</p>
<p>inside of Microsoft, but you can certainly still get it.</p>
<p>And no, we love it.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole firm kind of works in Yammer,</p>
<p>and it works very well for us.</p>
<p>And now what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>with this incredible office that you have,</p>
<p>this beautiful office you have in San Francisco</p>
<p>in commercial real estate,</p>
<p>now that are you going to come back to work?</p>
<p>We saw Twitter and Square, the Jack collection of companies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to come back to their offices.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll work from home primarily going forward.</p>
<p>What are you going to do?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;ll be a great asset for us in the year 2025</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>No, I mean, we will eventually go back to work there.</p>
<p>I think that the team still likes having an office.</p>
<p>I think, you know, the idea that everyone wants to work out</p>
<p>of like a small room and, you know,</p>
<p>extra room in their house,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably getting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a little overrated.</p>
<p>I think people would like to get back to the office.</p>
<p>But do we have to have one?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think we&rsquo;ve proven</p>
<p>that we can do our jobs via Zoom.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;ve done a lot of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done, like I said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done four or five deals since this started</p>
<p>where we haven&rsquo;t met with the entrepreneur in person.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s all been done via Zoom and it&rsquo;s worked great.</p>
<p>All right, Chamath, how are you doing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your mental health like?</p>
<p>You know, I get to see you once in a while</p>
<p>on CNBC throwing bombs, but how are you doing?</p>
<p>I was really excited for phase two of the shelter in place</p>
<p>to start here in San Mateo County.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been really good.</p>
<p>A new poker table that I had built arrived today,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll be installing after this.</p>
<p>And what I mean by I&rsquo;ll be installing-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be supervising.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be supervising.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be watching as people do real work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be watching and-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful table.</p>
<p>I saw the pictures of it.</p>
<p>Does it have an infinity edge?</p>
<p>Is it an infinity edge poker table?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll send you a picture when it&rsquo;s all done,</p>
<p>but it just looks stunning.</p>
<p>And I really want to try to organize a game soon</p>
<p>so that I can get you guys back into my little cave here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I am ready for this shelter in place to end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just be honest.</p>
<p>And I think that my sentiments</p>
<p>are the sentiments of a lot of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough, really, really tough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing all my motivation, to be quite honest.</p>
<p>It is weird to not see people,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re an extrovert, David.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an introvert.</p>
<p>And then David Freeberg also on the line.</p>
<p>David, how are you handling all of this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that made a huge difference</p>
<p>for me is the creating a rhythm in the day,</p>
<p>because there isn&rsquo;t one when you kind of normally get up</p>
<p>and you go to work,</p>
<p>and then you come home at the end of the day from work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a rhythm,</p>
<p>and you kind of get kind of adjusted to it.</p>
<p>So not having that,</p>
<p>a lot of people I&rsquo;ve been hearing are struggling with that.</p>
<p>I was certainly struggling with it, having sleep issues.</p>
<p>And I sit on about a dozen boards,</p>
<p>some of which are small companies,</p>
<p>some of which have a couple hundred employees.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been hearing pretty consistently</p>
<p>mental health issues across all the companies.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just been really grating on people.</p>
<p>I think it, number one kind of says,</p>
<p>we probably do need to be together and have social space.</p>
<p>As David said, like being in the same office,</p>
<p>people really miss that.</p>
<p>And you get a lot of value from that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been getting up every day in the last couple</p>
<p>of weeks and going offsite, going out of my house to go work</p>
<p>or actually working on another place</p>
<p>that I have like a little office there,</p>
<p>and I go kind of work there.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s made a huge impact, honestly,</p>
<p>on my mental health, being able to do that every day.</p>
<p>So just doing that, it&rsquo;s been helpful.</p>
<p>Not everyone has that privilege,</p>
<p>but I think it speaks a lot to why we&rsquo;re going to need</p>
<p>to go back to offices when this is all done.</p>
<p>And what do you think about,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with your businesses?</p>
<p>Obviously you&rsquo;re running a startup studio,</p>
<p>I guess would be one way to describe it,</p>
<p>where you create companies and then spin them out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been the business interruption, if any?</p>
<p>We have a couple of hardware and lab companies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s most of what we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>And so those operations are paused.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been really frustrating.</p>
<p>The teams have all found ways to adjust and work from home.</p>
<p>So our companies are not predominantly software-based.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of software,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not predominantly software.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been difficult on those scientists and engineers</p>
<p>that work in a lab or in a physical environment</p>
<p>that they have to go to to do their work.</p>
<p>The larger companies,</p>
<p>we have a number of food businesses</p>
<p>that happen to be in the food supply chain</p>
<p>one way or another.</p>
<p>Frankly, those businesses are doing fantastically well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been just this incredible success</p>
<p>in the era of COVID on kind of a focus on fundamentals</p>
<p>like food, supply chain, efficiency,</p>
<p>availability of things that people need.</p>
<p>And we were doing a lot in human health</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve kind of benefited from that.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think there&rsquo;s kind of a mix for us,</p>
<p>but I think every business is bifurcated one way or another</p>
<p>during this kind of moment of punctuated equilibrium.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think one thing I&rsquo;d like to sort of talk about</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ve had you both on the podcast early on</p>
<p>at the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m curious, Chamath, now that we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>over two months in quarantine, sheltering in place,</p>
<p>and a lot of information,</p>
<p>a lot of cards have turned over here, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the flop, I think.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen the turn in the river, so to speak.</p>
<p>What is your assessment of what we were talking about</p>
<p>a month or two ago and what we thought about this</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s become reality and what hasn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>What are you more optimistic about?</p>
<p>What are you more pessimistic about?</p>
<p>Chamath, let&rsquo;s start with you.</p>
<p>I think that we will have this pandemic</p>
<p>or this disease well in hand within two years.</p>
<p>And so whether it&rsquo;s a combination</p>
<p>of a therapeutic and a vaccine</p>
<p>or just a therapeutic,</p>
<p>I just think that we&rsquo;re gonna kick its ass.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s made me more optimistic.</p>
<p>I think that the thing that&rsquo;s made me more pessimistic,</p>
<p>though, is the return to normalcy</p>
<p>has been sort of cut on political lines.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been so massively politicized.</p>
<p>I mean, when David talks about the fact that</p>
<p>you can go to a developing country like Mexico</p>
<p>and all of a sudden everybody can get around</p>
<p>the idea of masks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because that there&rsquo;s a level of common sense there</p>
<p>that trumps politics.</p>
<p>And in the United States, that just isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re seeing in this crazy way,</p>
<p>I think, is sort of the center left and the left</p>
<p>probably sticking very firmly to the ideology</p>
<p>of sheltering in place and a lockdown,</p>
<p>probably on the sort of hope</p>
<p>that it gets Trump out of office.</p>
<p>And on the other side, sort of the red states,</p>
<p>I think have basically said,</p>
<p>hey, I would rather get sick from coronavirus</p>
<p>and take my chances</p>
<p>than the 100% chance of failure</p>
<p>that I have in my professional life</p>
<p>if you leave me at home</p>
<p>for another week or month or what have you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been a huge disappointment</p>
<p>of how political this whole thing has gotten.</p>
<p>And Saxe, you&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>like common sense procedures,</p>
<p>sort of same question to you.</p>
<p>What you first thought,</p>
<p>and you had been talking about,</p>
<p>you thought an L-shaped recovery.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll get into also the economy here,</p>
<p>but in terms of the disease,</p>
<p>what did you think two months ago</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t think now?</p>
<p>And what do you think?</p>
<p>Well, in preparation for this,</p>
<p>I kind of went through my Twitter feed</p>
<p>to see what I was saying the last time I was on the pod</p>
<p>and how well it was holding up.</p>
<p>And two months ago today,</p>
<p>I tweeted that the pandemic,</p>
<p>that underreaction caused the pandemic</p>
<p>and overreaction will cause the depression.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of where we are right now.</p>
<p>We still have this pandemic with us,</p>
<p>but now we&rsquo;re also potentially facing,</p>
<p>I think, a potential depression</p>
<p>because of the way we&rsquo;re overreacting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still in lockdowns</p>
<p>in huge swaths of the country.</p>
<p>And no one can quite understand why.</p>
<p>I mean, the original reason for the lockdowns</p>
<p>was to buy us time</p>
<p>so that the hospitals wouldn&rsquo;t become overwhelmed like Italy.</p>
<p>Well, nowhere in the country</p>
<p>do the hospitals get overwhelmed</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still in these lockdowns.</p>
<p>And so, I think that it&rsquo;s long overdue for it to end.</p>
<p>Now, at the same time,</p>
<p>I agree with Chamath</p>
<p>that this whole thing&rsquo;s become politicized</p>
<p>where the people who generally wanna get us out of lockdowns</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe in doing anything.</p>
<p>A lot of them aren&rsquo;t even willing to wear masks,</p>
<p>which I think is just kind of insane.</p>
<p>So, where I come out on this thing</p>
<p>is that I think we should end lockdowns, but wear masks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to find anybody</p>
<p>in the political spectrum who agrees with that</p>
<p>because one side wants to keep lockdowns going indefinitely</p>
<p>and the other doesn&rsquo;t want us to wear masks.</p>
<p>And it makes no logical sense, obviously.</p>
<p>And if you think about our political system,</p>
<p>the left is so far left that the moderates on the left side</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a place to live anymore.</p>
<p>And then on the right, the conservatives,</p>
<p>which I would put you in the group of</p>
<p>who were looking for fiscal conservatives,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a home anymore either.</p>
<p>And so, the most reasonable approach</p>
<p>is clearly to start going back to work</p>
<p>for people who are not at risk and who wear a mask.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>since the last pod that we did together,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s been three kind of major discoveries</p>
<p>or sets of facts that have come out about the virus.</p>
<p>Number one, the official fatality rate has been over,</p>
<p>which is about 6%.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a very high fatality rate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty scary.</p>
<p>But we now know that that&rsquo;s overstated</p>
<p>by probably at least 10x</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t take into account</p>
<p>all the asymptomatic cases or mild cases</p>
<p>that just never got tested.</p>
<p>And this is the fatality rate of people</p>
<p>who contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Right, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>As opposed to people whose case,</p>
<p>the problem with the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a debate between the IFR versus the CFR,</p>
<p>the infection fatality rate versus the case fatality rate.</p>
<p>The problem with kind of the official CFR numbers</p>
<p>is that only the people who got really sick</p>
<p>you know, never got tested.</p>
<p>And, you know, Freiburg was the earliest person</p>
<p>I know to start talking about the need</p>
<p>for wide scale population testing</p>
<p>and these blood serology tests</p>
<p>and other kinds of tests to establish</p>
<p>what the real baseline is.</p>
<p>But regardless of like,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been a whole bunch of different tests</p>
<p>with different results, you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know exactly what the true IFR is to this day,</p>
<p>but we do know it&rsquo;s probably closer to half a percent</p>
<p>than to 5%.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of discovery number one.</p>
<p>I think discovery number two is,</p>
<p>and we knew a little bit,</p>
<p>we saw a little bit of this from the Wuhan data,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s really clear</p>
<p>that which populations are at risk.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>the data seems to suggest that people under 60</p>
<p>who are healthy don&rsquo;t have sort of preexisting conditions</p>
<p>are 50 times less likely to develop,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a 50X greater chance for those over 60</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, having a really bad outcome.</p>
<p>And so for people under 60</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have these preexisting conditions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s just not,</p>
<p>yes, there&rsquo;s always, you know, examples to the contrary,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not this sort of gigantic risk.</p>
<p>And so for two thirds of the population,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a huge risk</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still locking them down.</p>
<p>I think the third thing, the third study,</p>
<p>not just studies, there&rsquo;s been studies</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been models,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ve also seen practice,</p>
<p>is that wide-scale use of masks</p>
<p>or ubiquitous mask wearing</p>
<p>is sufficient to control the virus,</p>
<p>meaning to stop the exponentiality of the virus.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen, you know, in the Asian countries</p>
<p>or Czechoslovakia, other places,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been able to get the, you know,</p>
<p>the so-called R-naught, the viral coefficient</p>
<p>to go below one with, you know, wide-scale use of masks.</p>
<p>And so we have a way</p>
<p>to prevent the virus from going exponential</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require lockdowns.</p>
<p>And so the thing, you know, I blogged about</p>
<p>the last time I was on your show</p>
<p>was why would you do this most severe thing,</p>
<p>these lockdowns, and not do this easy thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just merely inconvenient, which is a mask.</p>
<p>Freeberg, when you look at it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the, I think have the deepest science,</p>
<p>clearly have the deepest science background of all of us,</p>
<p>how do you look at this pandemic</p>
<p>now that we&rsquo;re 75 days into it here in the Bay Area?</p>
<p>And obviously, you know, this started in December,</p>
<p>it looks like, in China.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your take on it now?</p>
<p>What did you get right early?</p>
<p>And what have you changed your mind about recently?</p>
<p>I think, I&rsquo;m actually funny when you say that.</p>
<p>I just pulled up the original WHO joint mission</p>
<p>on COVID final report.</p>
<p>And the date of this report, by the way, is February 20th.</p>
<p>So there was this big thing they published</p>
<p>40 pages long from the WHO.</p>
<p>And in it, they highlighted, you know,</p>
<p>this fatality rate estimate inside of Hubei,</p>
<p>you know, Wuhan and outside of Hubei.</p>
<p>You know, we knew from this data very early on</p>
<p>that we were at about a half percent fatality rate.</p>
<p>And then, you know, we saw all of this other stuff</p>
<p>happen with Korea and the Princess cruise ship</p>
<p>and the NBA players very early on.</p>
<p>We saw all these people that were roughly asymptomatic.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re starting to get two kind of explanations</p>
<p>for why that is.</p>
<p>But from the beginning, I felt really like, you know,</p>
<p>this is gonna be a largely asymptomatic</p>
<p>kind of spreading infectious factor.</p>
<p>What I got wrong was when we went into lockdown,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Chamath, if you remember this</p>
<p>when we talked the first time on Jason&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>on your guys&rsquo; podcast, I asked you guys,</p>
<p>or you guys asked me when I thought we&rsquo;d be back.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, April 7th, we&rsquo;ll be back at work.</p>
<p>And I also had a bet going with you guys.</p>
<p>And I said, we&rsquo;re gonna have less than 20,000 deaths</p>
<p>in the US.</p>
<p>I so overestimated the effectiveness of the lockdown.</p>
<p>And I think that was kind of, you know,</p>
<p>one of the more kind of like striking things to me</p>
<p>is the quote unquote lockdown.</p>
<p>And I just sent the video to Nick.</p>
<p>Nick, do you have it?</p>
<p>Can you queue it up?</p>
<p>So basically, this is what I think has happened</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>Like pull this thing up.</p>
<p>I was in Berkeley on Saturday and I went to play,</p>
<p>to meet some buddies and we played Frisbee golf on campus</p>
<p>and had a beer, some college buddies of mine.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m walking around in Berkeley</p>
<p>and there is frat party after frat party going on.</p>
<p>No masks, everyone&rsquo;s on top of each other.</p>
<p>You can see the video right here.</p>
<p>I took a video of one of the frat parties.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s beer pong.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re all paying beer pong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like girls and drinking</p>
<p>and people are passing around bottles of vodka</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no mask.</p>
<p>And this was the entire campus of Berkeley.</p>
<p>Like, and I think this is what&rsquo;s gone on</p>
<p>like around the country.</p>
<p>So the belief that you could just kind of like</p>
<p>lock away the virus, I believe like, oh my God,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so extreme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so draconian.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to shut down the world</p>
<p>and this thing is going to get stopped in 30 days</p>
<p>like happened in China.</p>
<p>That is not what happened in the United States of America.</p>
<p>Like people want to be free.</p>
<p>People want to party.</p>
<p>People want to live their life.</p>
<p>They want to go to work.</p>
<p>They want to see their friends and family.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not used to being told no by the government.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s been to me,</p>
<p>the biggest surprise is just like how ineffective</p>
<p>the quote unquote lockdown has been.</p>
<p>And I think it really speaks to the need</p>
<p>that David mentioned, which is this lockdown isn&rsquo;t binary.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say lock everyone down or let them all out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to nuance your way to a solution,</p>
<p>which means like masks,</p>
<p>which means watching out for nursing homes,</p>
<p>which means temperature checking</p>
<p>before letting people into buildings of over 100 people.</p>
<p>Like all the stuff that I think needs to be done</p>
<p>for this to be kind of effective at tracking and tracing.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t just assume that a quote unquote lockdown</p>
<p>is going to keep people inside</p>
<p>and keep this thing from spreading</p>
<p>because the frat party, as you&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>is the perfect representation</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s really going on out there.</p>
<p>All right, circling back around to you Chamath,</p>
<p>what do you think of what the two Davids</p>
<p>sort of outlined there in terms of the path forward</p>
<p>and how we all handicapped what was going on?</p>
<p>Well, I think the reality is that by hook or crook,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to basically exit this lockdown</p>
<p>sooner than we think,</p>
<p>because I think people just can&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no point in having a shelter in place order</p>
<p>if everybody&rsquo;s running around playing beer pong.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not doing anything.</p>
<p>And so you might as well get the productive value</p>
<p>of the economy going again</p>
<p>by letting people go back to work.</p>
<p>And just finding some simple ways</p>
<p>that people can look past the politics</p>
<p>and just do the right thing.</p>
<p>Wear a goddamn mask and shut the fuck up</p>
<p>and go back to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really like, I mean, when you think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, why is this such a big deal?</p>
<p>Get everything you want</p>
<p>and just put a little bit of cloth over your face.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of the folks that push back on this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re better off wearing the mask.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it is pretty striking</p>
<p>when you watch the protests</p>
<p>and you see a bunch of people who are obviously older</p>
<p>and obviously obese.</p>
<p>Those are not the best looking knives in the drawer,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just put it that way.</p>
<p>Definitely not.</p>
<p>Little dull and rusty is what I would say.</p>
<p>Well, and you know, they&rsquo;re carrying guns</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve never served a day in the army.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re literally cosplaying Marines.</p>
<p>I have nothing to say about that.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is this whole mask thing</p>
<p>is not such a big deal.</p>
<p>Just if you can wear a mask</p>
<p>and get back to being productive and get back to a job,</p>
<p>I think you should be allowed to.</p>
<p>All right, so we had a big debate,</p>
<p>V-shaped, W-shaped, U-shaped, L-shaped recovery.</p>
<p>I was in the, I&rsquo;m aspirationally V-shaped,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m expecting a U.</p>
<p>I think for Sachi, you were the L</p>
<p>and I think Chamath, you were the W,</p>
<p>the U or the L.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a V.</p>
<p>How do you explain, Chamath,</p>
<p>what is going on in the stock market?</p>
<p>Because you said it was the end of days.</p>
<p>You said this is gonna be a disaster.</p>
<p>Is it going to be a disaster?</p>
<p>Is this the end of the days</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got some false rebound</p>
<p>and this V-shaped recovery is not sustainable?</p>
<p>How do you explain this inexplicable V-shaped response?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First of all, the economy is completely fucked.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t look at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft,</p>
<p>Google and a handful of internet SaaS companies</p>
<p>and kid yourself.</p>
<p>We have 30 million American men and women out of work.</p>
<p>That is every fifth person you see</p>
<p>walking down the street does not have a job.</p>
<p>What happens when lockdown ends?</p>
<p>If the lockdown ends in June,</p>
<p>as expected for most people,</p>
<p>how many people are, how many rebound?</p>
<p>No, so look, here&rsquo;s the thing that we&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had trillions of dollars of money</p>
<p>printed into the system.</p>
<p>And when you print that money into the system,</p>
<p>which the Federal Reserve has done,</p>
<p>it hits the asset markets</p>
<p>and it has basically stabilized the bond market</p>
<p>and the incremental dollar sits in the hands</p>
<p>of an individual who must put the money to work.</p>
<p>Because when you look back on this,</p>
<p>this is not a random person managing their 401k.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of money</p>
<p>sits in the hands of hedge funds or pension funds</p>
<p>or sovereign wealth funds or mutual funds.</p>
<p>They have a job to do.</p>
<p>And so you have to think about</p>
<p>what is their incremental decision.</p>
<p>So even if the stock market made no sense</p>
<p>on any valuation metric,</p>
<p>the incremental dollar that they have,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re paid to put to work will get put to work.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;ve actually seen is a dispersion.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is if you graph</p>
<p>the S&amp;P 500 index versus the unweighted S&amp;P 500 index,</p>
<p>which basically means the first one</p>
<p>ranks companies by market cap</p>
<p>and gives the biggest companies more weight.</p>
<p>The other one ranks every company equally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a massive split, a dispersion.</p>
<p>And what it really shows is that</p>
<p>companies that traffic in bits,</p>
<p>so software businesses have a bid</p>
<p>and companies that traffic in atoms</p>
<p>have gotten completely decimated</p>
<p>and they are literally worthless.</p>
<p>And so when you put all these things together,</p>
<p>the real economy is in the toilet.</p>
<p>There are tens of millions of men and women out of work.</p>
<p>The earnings power of real companies</p>
<p>that do physical things in the world</p>
<p>are cheaper and lower than they&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the companies that have high velocity,</p>
<p>high margin software driven businesses</p>
<p>have gone to the moon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unfair to look at 30 or 40 businesses</p>
<p>and paint that as a V-shaped recovery.</p>
<p>It is a equity market that is buoyed by Fed dollars</p>
<p>that is not mapping to the reality</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening on the ground.</p>
<p>Okay, so Sax, you&rsquo;re pretty plugged into the economy</p>
<p>and you think about this a lot.</p>
<p>What do you think the recovery looks like?</p>
<p>Is this going to be two, three, four, five quarter recession?</p>
<p>Is it going to be depression era</p>
<p>like some people are apt to say?</p>
<p>What keeps you up at night thinking about the economy</p>
<p>and what gives you hope?</p>
<p>Well, it kind of depends if there are other shoes to drop.</p>
<p>So I agree with Tramath that the state of the economy</p>
<p>right now is terrible</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s divorced from the financial markets</p>
<p>because of all the money printing and interventions</p>
<p>that the Fed and Treasury have been doing.</p>
<p>One way to think about it as well,</p>
<p>the stock market&rsquo;s denominated in U.S. dollars</p>
<p>and if they just printed a whole bunch more of them,</p>
<p>those dollars are worth less</p>
<p>and so the price of the stocks are going to rise.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think looking forward,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably going to be a two to three year process</p>
<p>to get out of this unless some other shoe drops</p>
<p>which could make it much worse.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re betting on two to three years</p>
<p>to get back to let&rsquo;s call it single digit unemployment.</p>
<p>Um, well let&rsquo;s see, we&rsquo;re at like what,</p>
<p>15% right now or something like that?</p>
<p>So, you know-</p>
<p>35 million people, you get down to 10 million again,</p>
<p>20 million?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a long time to create all those jobs.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of these businesses</p>
<p>are not just going to come racing right back.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it&rsquo;s probably like a two to three year</p>
<p>process to get back to some sort of, you know-</p>
<p>And by the way, the thing you have to remember is like,</p>
<p>look, the unemployment numbers that we have had</p>
<p>in the last probably seven or eight years,</p>
<p>so during Obama and Trump,</p>
<p>have been completely manipulated</p>
<p>because the number of people</p>
<p>that are entirely leaving the workforce is quite high.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it&rsquo;s not just a numerator problem.</p>
<p>We have a denominator problem too.</p>
<p>There are fewer and fewer workers that, you know,</p>
<p>are willing to work because some of them just give up.</p>
<p>Right, or it&rsquo;s just not worth it</p>
<p>for the pay that&rsquo;s available is another stated reason.</p>
<p>So the thing that we&rsquo;re going to have to figure out</p>
<p>is like how many of the people</p>
<p>that are leaving the workforce may never come back.</p>
<p>And that has a societal toll</p>
<p>and weight that we all have to bear.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of people</p>
<p>who maybe are in their 60s or maybe even late 50s,</p>
<p>they got 10, 20 years left</p>
<p>that they could be working in management,</p>
<p>sales, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And they just say, you know what, it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go try to find a place to stay</p>
<p>and maybe not rejoin the workforce.</p>
<p>Early retirement or just capitulation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and, but, you know,</p>
<p>remember what I said about other shoes dropping.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re still in the early,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re still in the early stages</p>
<p>seeing the repercussions of what, you know,</p>
<p>but two, three months shut down the economy,</p>
<p>you know, what that&rsquo;s going to look like.</p>
<p>And so the, you know, the wave of defaults is just beginning</p>
<p>and, you know, who knows what happens with cities and states</p>
<p>and so on down the line.</p>
<p>I mean, who knows, you know,</p>
<p>do the debt markets have kind of an inexhaustible,</p>
<p>you know, desire to buy US debt</p>
<p>or could we reach some sort of saturation point?</p>
<p>And then that triggers the next, you know, set of crises.</p>
<p>So we just don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>I would say like the two to three year outlook</p>
<p>is the one that&rsquo;s kind of like what it looks like today.</p>
<p>But if there are these other big shoes to drop,</p>
<p>it could turn into something much worse.</p>
<p>I think, Friedberg, we&rsquo;re all in agreement</p>
<p>that there will be a second wave of some type,</p>
<p>just depends on how big the spike is.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be another</p>
<p>New York City level outbreak where we&rsquo;ll see, you know,</p>
<p>2000 people, 1500 people dying in a certain region every day</p>
<p>for some sustained period of time?</p>
<p>What are the chances of that happening, Friedberg?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I think going forward, the, you know,</p>
<p>the New York situation, people&rsquo;s behaviors have been shocked.</p>
<p>So, you know, to the points earlier,</p>
<p>the most effective thing you can do is stop coughing</p>
<p>on your hand, touching a railing.</p>
<p>Someone else touches the railing and touches their mouth.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of how this goes.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s been early on some weird,</p>
<p>like aerosolized studies that they&rsquo;ve kind of said,</p>
<p>hey, this thing spreads in the air and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, you know,</p>
<p>you gotta be in a closed kind of confined space.</p>
<p>So people are wearing masks now.</p>
<p>So the likelihood of the transmission happening</p>
<p>at the rate that we saw in New York,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great paper out of MIT, by the way,</p>
<p>that shows how this happened on the subway.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Describe it.</p>
<p>Identified the subway as kind of the primary vector</p>
<p>that drove transmission in New York City.</p>
<p>That was always my thesis.</p>
<p>And I remember talking about it and saying,</p>
<p>how is this not obvious to everybody</p>
<p>that 8 million people ride that thing every day</p>
<p>or something?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s so obvious.</p>
<p>And they did an incredible job proving it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like people running in Central Park</p>
<p>or spreading coronavirus to each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everyone in these confined spaces coughing in the air,</p>
<p>and then you kind of get this stuff.</p>
<p>And 20 people get on and off at every stop.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not just a bunch of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an airplane where you have X number of people</p>
<p>going in one direction for three, four, five hours.</p>
<p>This is 20 people getting on and off every five minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you couldn&rsquo;t design</p>
<p>a better incubator for it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think a city in the United States</p>
<p>approaches the density that you have in New York.</p>
<p>So remember, these are not deterministic factors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a spectrum, a probabilistic spectrum here.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of people,</p>
<p>they have a certain type of behavior,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not wearing masks.</p>
<p>You kind of add these up,</p>
<p>and you end up with this really high kind of vector</p>
<p>that drives this rapid spread, as we saw in New York City.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna see that in Dallas.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna see that in Houston.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna see that in San Diego.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have more of the slow, steady burn</p>
<p>as some risk is taken in the environment.</p>
<p>Some risk is taken by frat parties</p>
<p>and people not wearing masks and people touching their mouth.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not gonna have the same sort of massive effect</p>
<p>you saw in New York.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t expect us to have a New York style</p>
<p>second wave.</p>
<p>I do expect there to continue to be this like slow burn,</p>
<p>going forward of new cases.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly gonna be more obvious</p>
<p>now that we&rsquo;re testing a lot more.</p>
<p>And so Chamath, at this point,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re basically putting a price on life and saying,</p>
<p>hey, some amount of deaths is worth taking the risk.</p>
<p>And as Americans, a unique group of people in the world</p>
<p>in how we look at personal freedom,</p>
<p>Americans are just making the choice.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, if you don&rsquo;t wanna take the risk, stay home.</p>
<p>But the rest of us, if we wanna take the risk,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go take the risk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this has come down to in your mind, Chamath?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that it&rsquo;s very difficult for Americans</p>
<p>to envision a world where their personal freedoms</p>
<p>are infringed upon.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s sort of like one of the founding principles</p>
<p>of the entire country.</p>
<p>This is why I think that the tragedy of this thing</p>
<p>is that the way to get everybody what they want</p>
<p>is so simple.</p>
<p>As David said, it&rsquo;s like above 65, you stay home,</p>
<p>you work remotely.</p>
<p>Under 65, you temperature check and wear a mask</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re 95% of the way there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s become a left versus right decision to do it.</p>
<p>The mask wearers are still in a lockdown</p>
<p>and the non-mask wearers wanna get back to work.</p>
<p>And basically, it&rsquo;s just another kind of culture war</p>
<p>between the left and the right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just shocking to me.</p>
<p>I mean, for what it&rsquo;s worth, I am a betting man,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll just tell you.</p>
<p>My line now is that I think that Donald Trump</p>
<p>is overwhelmingly likely to win</p>
<p>as a function of people&rsquo;s frustration about the lockdowns.</p>
<p>And I think that the Democrats&rsquo; best hope</p>
<p>of winning in November is ending these things</p>
<p>sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing we&rsquo;re talking about a pandemic,</p>
<p>a once in a hundred year pandemic, it looks like,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re literally looking at our reaction to it</p>
<p>through the lens of this president being reelected</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>Literally, that&rsquo;s the determining factor</p>
<p>on the advice we&rsquo;re giving to people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re telling people they can&rsquo;t go to the beach,</p>
<p>but they can be on an airplane.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t go to the Tesla factory,</p>
<p>but they can ride the subway.</p>
<p>I mean, on a communication basis,</p>
<p>is there any worse way we could have communicated this</p>
<p>to the populace?</p>
<p>Well, the communication was bad,</p>
<p>but I think the bigger problem, quite honestly,</p>
<p>is that the Republican Democratic governors</p>
<p>in the United States can&rsquo;t get on the same page.</p>
<p>And at the same time, there&rsquo;s just a tendency</p>
<p>to support Donald Trump or not support him</p>
<p>in a very reflexive, instinctive way</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t helpful right now.</p>
<p>And there just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be enough</p>
<p>political wherewithal and courage to just stand up</p>
<p>and do the right thing,</p>
<p>independent of what your political persuasion is.</p>
<p>But I think on the margin now,</p>
<p>I think you have different</p>
<p>but very similar boundary conditions</p>
<p>to 2016, where there are all these people</p>
<p>that kind of like told you one thing and did another.</p>
<p>There are all these people right now</p>
<p>that probably are preference falsifying as we speak,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll show up into the voting booth</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be angry if they&rsquo;re not back in their jobs,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;ve been laid off</p>
<p>as a result of not being able to get back.</p>
<p>And they would blame that on the Democrats,</p>
<p>not the Republicans, and therefore Trump gets his next term.</p>
<p>Well, because it&rsquo;s the Democratic states</p>
<p>that are pushing the hardest to basically like,</p>
<p>you saw the craziness in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>but like Eric Garcetti was basically like,</p>
<p>we will enter the shelter in place in December of 2022.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, this is, it&rsquo;s Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Players gotta play.</p>
<p>I mean, like, this is just, this is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I do, I agree.</p>
<p>The lockdowns, or the unwillingness to end the lockdowns</p>
<p>gives Trump an issue for November,</p>
<p>assuming this continues,</p>
<p>that supersedes the incompetence of the COVID response,</p>
<p>which is that, you know, our lives and livelihoods</p>
<p>are not owned by politicians to, you know,</p>
<p>meter out and give back to us in drips and drabs.</p>
<p>And as they see fit,</p>
<p>that is the issue that the lockdown crowd</p>
<p>is giving to Trump.</p>
<p>And I do think it will,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s still the issue in November,</p>
<p>it will supersede the, you know,</p>
<p>the initial incompetence of the COVID response.</p>
<p>And what did you think of this whole,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the drug that Trump said he was taking, David Sachs?</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, or Friedberg, maybe you take it.</p>
<p>We talked about that early on,</p>
<p>and that, and I think you properly said,</p>
<p>like, if you took it early, this could be,</p>
<p>you know, could, has potential,</p>
<p>taking it later, it&rsquo;s probably too late.</p>
<p>I think you nailed that on the pod last time.</p>
<p>Why has this become such a political issue?</p>
<p>And what are your thoughts on that drug specifically</p>
<p>and its potential efficacy?</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not a doctor,</p>
<p>but it, from what I understand is there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>so just so you know, there&rsquo;s like side effects to this drug</p>
<p>for a small percentage of the population.</p>
<p>And this drug can actually inhibit energy production</p>
<p>in certain cells, which can cause organs to dysfunction.</p>
<p>And it particularly shows up in the heart.</p>
<p>So people end up with what&rsquo;s called a long QT interval</p>
<p>and potentially some heart issues</p>
<p>that can be pretty dangerous and deadly,</p>
<p>depending on your body.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really a little bit of an unknown.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also issues longer term with vision impairment,</p>
<p>can damage your retinal cells and cause vision loss.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s risk to this drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like taking, you know, an Advil.</p>
<p>It is a measured risk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a low probability, but the severity can be high.</p>
<p>And so typically with a scenario like that,</p>
<p>doctors and scientists like to see, you know,</p>
<p>phased clinical trials and you kind of do, you know,</p>
<p>randomized and you have placebo and testing.</p>
<p>And so that hasn&rsquo;t necessarily been done</p>
<p>for this particular virus, this particular condition.</p>
<p>And often the design of those studies matters a lot.</p>
<p>So you could give it to a bunch of quote unquote,</p>
<p>COVID patients, but if it&rsquo;s not being given</p>
<p>to COVID patients either before</p>
<p>or right as they&rsquo;re getting sick,</p>
<p>maybe it doesn&rsquo;t show the results that you would expect</p>
<p>from a prophylactic treatment,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re getting it before you&rsquo;re really sick.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it may be the most efficacious.</p>
<p>And so some people are saying, wait, we don&rsquo;t know enough.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth the risk because of that small percentage,</p>
<p>high severity problem.</p>
<p>While others are saying, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally worth the risk.</p>
<p>Cause the downside, if you get coronavirus</p>
<p>can be really bad.</p>
<p>And you know, so there&rsquo;s a lot of room for debate here.</p>
<p>And when there&rsquo;s a lot of room for debate,</p>
<p>you usually kind of revert to some sort of base belief</p>
<p>or some base kind of political point of view or something.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s gone on here.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a clear cut.</p>
<p>The sun is yellow and the sky is blue kind of conversation.</p>
<p>This is like, I can interpret this a lot of different ways.</p>
<p>It does seem that like, look, this drug, you know,</p>
<p>like a lot of, has an effect in the same way</p>
<p>that a lot of other, that this drug might have</p>
<p>on a lot of other viruses.</p>
<p>And this especially plus zinc, you know,</p>
<p>and this Z-Pak, this azithromycin, which is an antibiotic,</p>
<p>together may be really effective.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, if you weigh the downside</p>
<p>and the probability of that downside for a patient,</p>
<p>against what the potential upside would be,</p>
<p>depending on their risk factors,</p>
<p>now that we know those better for COVID,</p>
<p>you can make an educated decision</p>
<p>and maybe it should just be left in the hands of doctors</p>
<p>versus like have some national statement about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s certainly a lot of room for debate</p>
<p>and thus a lot of kind of, you know,</p>
<p>political engagement on this.</p>
<p>Saks, there was a lot of talk about</p>
<p>what the Bay Area looks like after this,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s commercial real estate with Twitter and Square</p>
<p>going full work from home</p>
<p>and people not wanting to work in cities.</p>
<p>What are your general thoughts on</p>
<p>what the world looks like a year from now</p>
<p>and maybe five years from now,</p>
<p>if there is going to be some permanent change,</p>
<p>what do you think it would be?</p>
<p>Well, there could be a big resorting.</p>
<p>I mean, it kind of depends if the virus becomes endemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something we kind of end up living with.</p>
<p>But, you know, so if it does, I mean,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like over 70,</p>
<p>are you really going to want to stay in a place</p>
<p>like New York City</p>
<p>or are you going to want to go somewhere else?</p>
<p>And so I could imagine if this does become</p>
<p>this long-term thing that&rsquo;s just a endemic,</p>
<p>you know, if we don&rsquo;t have a vaccine,</p>
<p>I could see cities resorting where, you know,</p>
<p>New York is people who are comfortable with COVID risk.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s, I think San Francisco,</p>
<p>the big issue with San Francisco</p>
<p>is that there are always a bunch of reasons</p>
<p>not to want to live there.</p>
<p>I mean, the city just seems like chronically mismanaged.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge-</p>
<p>Feces, lots of poop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge homeless problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, public health issues with that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of crime</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t responded to properly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all these like reasons not to live there.</p>
<p>But the reason why people chose to live there</p>
<p>is because the tech industry</p>
<p>had a very strong network effect</p>
<p>and you needed to be in Silicon Valley or San Francisco</p>
<p>in order to have access to these jobs and opportunities.</p>
<p>And if those jobs and opportunities</p>
<p>are now available via Zoom</p>
<p>and you can be doing them from anywhere,</p>
<p>are people still gonna choose to live in San Francisco?</p>
<p>You know, with the cost of living</p>
<p>and housing and apartments and all the rest of it</p>
<p>that goes along with it.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, I think there is some chance</p>
<p>that this whole remote work thing</p>
<p>could break Silicon Valley&rsquo;s network effect.</p>
<p>And that would be really bad for places like San Francisco,</p>
<p>which otherwise might not be the greatest places to live.</p>
<p>Yeah, my thesis on this</p>
<p>in terms of getting out of the recession,</p>
<p>I think remote work could lead to a level of efficiency</p>
<p>and profitability in the companies</p>
<p>that we have never seen before.</p>
<p>If you think just about every manager now</p>
<p>knows how to manage remote workers, right?</p>
<p>You learn that in like three, four weeks.</p>
<p>You figure out how to manage people remote.</p>
<p>Even people who hated managing people remote,</p>
<p>all these Gen Xers and boomers who are managing,</p>
<p>you know, millennials and earlier Gen Xers,</p>
<p>they now know how to do it.</p>
<p>And what they quickly learn is,</p>
<p>these three or four people in my team are crushing it.</p>
<p>These two or three people don&rsquo;t need to be here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually adding any value.</p>
<p>So I think what&rsquo;s gonna happen is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna cut the bottom people.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re gonna cut their office space.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve removed, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>call it 30% of the cost basis of the business, 40%.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s operating better and people are happier.</p>
<p>And then when you do hire somebody,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be more talent available.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve just opened it up that you can hire somebody</p>
<p>anywhere in the world without an office.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to relocate them.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to pay,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you guys think the average</p>
<p>additional cost is to be in San Francisco,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna say $30,000.</p>
<p>So a $40,000 a year job or a $50,000 a year job</p>
<p>becomes a 70 or 80, something like that.</p>
<p>And if all that happens,</p>
<p>these companies are gonna be so profitable</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna start growing.</p>
<p>And that leads us out of the economic downturn.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on my thesis?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a thesis, that&rsquo;s a hope.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hope&rsquo;s not a fucking strategy, Jason.</p>
<p>Well, I just think it&rsquo;s a potential way out.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you think in general</p>
<p>about this trend of remote then, Jamal?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re realizing that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no monopoly on innovation</p>
<p>and companies can be really productive remotely</p>
<p>that most of the work in an office is busy work and politics</p>
<p>and you can cut it all out.</p>
<p>And you can do the same amount of work in much less time,</p>
<p>which gives you more time to frankly be with your family</p>
<p>or take up a hobby or learn a second language</p>
<p>or a third language.</p>
<p>I mean, I just think it&rsquo;s so much better</p>
<p>for people to realize like we gotta,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, it&rsquo;s not 1820 or 1920, it&rsquo;s 2020.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna live to a hundred years old.</p>
<p>Like we have a long time to be in the grind.</p>
<p>And so, working and accomplishing what you used to</p>
<p>in half the time and not having to commute</p>
<p>and being able to live where you want</p>
<p>and your people you like,</p>
<p>man, that has a huge positive impact to your kids,</p>
<p>you, your community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just way better.</p>
<p>I just think offices are just complete</p>
<p>kind of like, it&rsquo;s all Shakespearean theater in the end</p>
<p>and cutting it all out is great.</p>
<p>And specifically San Francisco</p>
<p>is just a complete cesspool dump of shit.</p>
<p>And so, being able to just get out of that city is just-</p>
<p>All right, everybody, welcome to the,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re listening to the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>I read some stats yesterday</p>
<p>that were just so unbelievably shocking.</p>
<p>Like the number of break-ins, the number of-</p>
<p>Number one in the country.</p>
<p>Number one in the country.</p>
<p>The amount of disease that like communicable disease,</p>
<p>like typhoid.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, typhoid?</p>
<p>I was born in a country and scratched and clawed</p>
<p>to emigrate as a refugee</p>
<p>to leave a country that had typhoid as a disease.</p>
<p>Welcome home, Jermoth.</p>
<p>Just to end up back in that in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Did you break it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>You brought it with you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an absolute joke.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, the idea that I&rsquo;d never have to go</p>
<p>to San Francisco ever again is,</p>
<p>oh my God, it brings joy to me.</p>
<p>It is an unmitigated disaster.</p>
<p>And I think this will be part of the boom-bust cycle</p>
<p>that, you know, David, you were part of</p>
<p>when you were here at Stanford,</p>
<p>you know, getting an office in San Francisco</p>
<p>or having an apartment.</p>
<p>It was cheaper, I think, in the city</p>
<p>than it was down in Palo Alto, was it not?</p>
<p>Well, back in, yeah, when we moved Yammer</p>
<p>to San Francisco, which was 2009,</p>
<p>I think we were able to get space for $20 a foot per year.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I paid, 2007, 2008.</p>
<p>I read a crazy article.</p>
<p>It was about the Kushners and this building that they own,</p>
<p>that Brookfield Asset Management was gonna buy.</p>
<p>And it said that they bought this building</p>
<p>and so the Kushners moved to like Park Avenue,</p>
<p>the General Motors building overlooking Central Park</p>
<p>or something, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful building.</p>
<p>And it actually quoted in there</p>
<p>the price that they were paying.</p>
<p>And it was incredible because it was like 100 bucks</p>
<p>at a square foot per year.</p>
<p>And I realized, oh my God, they&rsquo;re paying less</p>
<p>for Central Park views in New York</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;m paying for a warehouse in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>This makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;d be supply and demand right there.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself, like, this is crazy.</p>
<p>Like, California is so expensive.</p>
<p>The taxes are so high.</p>
<p>I think people are gonna leave in droves, honestly.</p>
<p>What do we think of Elon selling all his homes</p>
<p>and then actually saying he&rsquo;s gonna move Tesla out?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a practical reality</p>
<p>to move Tesla out of California.</p>
<p>I think that the incremental facilities can be built</p>
<p>wherever he wants them to be built</p>
<p>based on where he gets the tax incentives.</p>
<p>Well, but I think the Tesla Fremont</p>
<p>was a really good example of this sort of like culture war</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on, this political battle over lockdowns.</p>
<p>And, you know, you had kind of a mid-level</p>
<p>health department bureaucrat in Fremont</p>
<p>padlocking their factory</p>
<p>and saying they couldn&rsquo;t go back to work.</p>
<p>Whereas if he was in Texas, he could.</p>
<p>And then, you know, around the same time</p>
<p>you had this whole like chilly Luther thing in Texas</p>
<p>where she was a small business owner, you know,</p>
<p>owns like a haircut place.</p>
<p>And she was basically gonna be put in jail for a week</p>
<p>for giving somebody a haircut.</p>
<p>And there was like a, you know, dust up over that.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think that like, you know,</p>
<p>the country is certainly ready to get back to work.</p>
<p>And if this is the political debate, you know, in November,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it will be</p>
<p>because six months is a really long time from now,</p>
<p>but, or was it four or five months?</p>
<p>But if this is a political debate, I, you know,</p>
<p>this will be the way that Trump gets reelected.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s gonna be some pretty</p>
<p>significant benefits</p>
<p>because of the reaction you guys are speaking to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about people moving,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a reaction to regulation.</p>
<p>And that could have some pretty profound effects</p>
<p>that could benefit certain sectors and businesses</p>
<p>and accelerate new outcomes.</p>
<p>One of the things that, you know,</p>
<p>I have a strong belief in is like,</p>
<p>I think in 20 years,</p>
<p>we could kind of eradicate all infectious disease.</p>
<p>The only thing holding that up is regulation</p>
<p>because the science is known,</p>
<p>the engineering is basically there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s simply a function of getting these things approved</p>
<p>and getting across the finish line.</p>
<p>Doing gene editing in humans for genetic mutations</p>
<p>that cause harm to humans</p>
<p>is a technique that we&rsquo;ve known for 20 years.</p>
<p>And there was a guy, a patient that died in 1999</p>
<p>from one of the first AAV treatments,</p>
<p>the viral vector gene editing treatments.</p>
<p>After that, there was this clamp down</p>
<p>and suddenly everything stopped</p>
<p>and there was like no longer any progress in the space.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just now starting to come back.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>really interesting technology</p>
<p>that has been kind of hindered.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, not being able to put Teslas out,</p>
<p>I think is the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>of what people are seeing regulation can do to businesses.</p>
<p>And look, I&rsquo;m by no stretch, you know,</p>
<p>a libertarian party card carrier,</p>
<p>but I do think, and I see it in businesses</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m involved in all the time,</p>
<p>that this, you know, incredibly onerous,</p>
<p>like overreaching regulatory burden and bureaucrats</p>
<p>really hinder great new things from happening in the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just become so frigging apparent</p>
<p>how inept the people are that are making the decisions</p>
<p>that are doing this to us are during this crisis.</p>
<p>And I think it could have a profound benefit</p>
<p>on kind of deregulation and accelerating</p>
<p>the adoption of new tools and new technologies</p>
<p>that could really help us all.</p>
<p>So I view the positive side of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like, everyone&rsquo;s gonna leave California.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s inept bureaucrats</p>
<p>and overregulation everywhere.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk geopolitics for a moment.</p>
<p>Chamath, you know, you heard the president call it</p>
<p>the Wuhan virus.</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s no doubt that it came from there.</p>
<p>There is a debate.</p>
<p>Was this something that was not created in a lab,</p>
<p>but that was being studied in a lab</p>
<p>and accidentally got out and that&rsquo;s how the jump happened.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some tension there between China and the US.</p>
<p>What do you think the global reaction is gonna be</p>
<p>and the fallout will be for China, if any,</p>
<p>Japan is paying factories, I read,</p>
<p>and helping subsidize them to move factories out of China</p>
<p>so they can move that dependency.</p>
<p>We obviously saw the dependency on PPE</p>
<p>and drugs being made actually in Wuhan in that area</p>
<p>and how we don&rsquo;t have a supply chain</p>
<p>that we can rely on for really mission critical stuff.</p>
<p>How will we look at this Chinese relationship</p>
<p>in the United States and global post pandemic?</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the modern Cold War.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s America versus China,</p>
<p>except that China is a much more worthy adversary for us</p>
<p>than the USSR was at their peak.</p>
<p>And the reason is because China has been making</p>
<p>strategic investments for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>You know, the biggest thing that prevents China</p>
<p>from really going guns blazing,</p>
<p>broadside attack on the US is that the US dollar</p>
<p>is still the reserve currency of the world.</p>
<p>But even there, China, you know,</p>
<p>is trying to do a digital currency and a stable coin.</p>
<p>And these are all these state sponsored initiatives</p>
<p>that come from frankly, just strategic decision-making</p>
<p>to try to usurp the United States</p>
<p>as the most powerful country in the world.</p>
<p>And so again, it goes back to, is this a political issue</p>
<p>or is this an ideological issue</p>
<p>or is this an exceptionalism issue</p>
<p>or is this just the practical reality</p>
<p>that we do not want another country being number one?</p>
<p>And can we all agree?</p>
<p>And if we can all agree, then I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll win.</p>
<p>Where do you sit on it?</p>
<p>For you, is it practical?</p>
<p>Is it ideological?</p>
<p>Completely practical.</p>
<p>I have zero, like, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot</p>
<p>because I have not done any investments</p>
<p>and I just did my first.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been three months and it was a credit deal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not even equity.</p>
<p>And, you know, I was, and I was reflecting on</p>
<p>what am I trying to do?</p>
<p>Because I felt myself frenetically, you know,</p>
<p>spending and working too much and, you know,</p>
<p>looking at all these different opportunities.</p>
<p>And I realized, wait a minute,</p>
<p>like my job here is not to win some finite game.</p>
<p>Like this is not ending like a basketball game</p>
<p>or a soccer match.</p>
<p>This is like, I&rsquo;m trying to be in this thing for 50 years.</p>
<p>So my goal is to survive.</p>
<p>And the reason why I say that is my ideology is very fluid.</p>
<p>I have to be able to adapt to market conditions</p>
<p>as they change, because if I want to be a relevant,</p>
<p>you know, person in the world in 50 years from now,</p>
<p>first rule of business is don&rsquo;t go out of business.</p>
<p>Second rule of business is don&rsquo;t forget rule number one.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>So in that context, I think it&rsquo;s a very practical thing</p>
<p>that we just have to deal with China</p>
<p>and make sure that they do not usurp America&rsquo;s</p>
<p>standing in the world</p>
<p>as the most important country of the world.</p>
<p>Just for me, it&rsquo;s ideological.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want a communist country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about that.</p>
<p>That is torturing their citizens</p>
<p>as the number one country in the world.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>I have a real issue with this.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think you have the right to judge.</p>
<p>Just like Californians can&rsquo;t judge Texans</p>
<p>and Texans can&rsquo;t judge Floridians.</p>
<p>Oh no, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>You absolutely should judge people who are torturing people</p>
<p>and not allowing people to have freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should judge them, actually.</p>
<p>Actually, human rights violations,</p>
<p>I think you should judge people.</p>
<p>I think that we, there&rsquo;s a lot of that stuff in America</p>
<p>that you stay silent on.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I am absolutely for cannabis.</p>
<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s arrested for cannabis violations</p>
<p>and low-level drug things,</p>
<p>I think they should be let out of jail</p>
<p>just like J.B. Pritzker did in Chicago.</p>
<p>I mean, and I think the death penalty should be repealed here</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t apply it properly.</p>
<p>Those are the number one and two things,</p>
<p>probably in the United States,</p>
<p>that go against the human rights,</p>
<p>the Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually very pro-fixing those things.</p>
<p>I was totally against waterboarding</p>
<p>and I think that was the worst moment</p>
<p>in modern American history.</p>
<p>I honestly think that China&rsquo;s gonna do China.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s gonna be India.</p>
<p>And instead of getting caught up in our own ideology,</p>
<p>you should change it in your own country</p>
<p>and then make sure that the other country doesn&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Well, and that&rsquo;s my point is,</p>
<p>do you believe engagement with China</p>
<p>leads them towards democracy</p>
<p>and better human rights conditions</p>
<p>for their citizens or not?</p>
<p>And I think-</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s the fool&rsquo;s errand.</p>
<p>That is an absolute-</p>
<p>Well, it worked for East Berlin</p>
<p>and it did work in saving Europe from the Nazis.</p>
<p>But the boundary conditions are entirely different</p>
<p>and China has proven that it works.</p>
<p>Europeans were genetically bred to be lazy oligarchs.</p>
<p>They just needed an excuse.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody.</p>
<p>I think we just got kicked out of the iTunes store.</p>
<p>Saxy poo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>China.</p>
<p>Hawk, dove, engagement, isolation.</p>
<p>Where do you stand?</p>
<p>You heard Chamath say his position.</p>
<p>Where do you stand?</p>
<p>Yeah, decoupling from China</p>
<p>is gonna be a bipartisan issue now.</p>
<p>I think both candidates now will be-</p>
<p>Well, Trump is gonna run blaming China for what happened.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think Biden&rsquo;s gonna be defending China.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;re gonna try and peg him</p>
<p>with the whole Beijing Biden label</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s probably gonna need to try</p>
<p>and out-Trump Trump on China.</p>
<p>So decoupling is gonna happen.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really make sense for us to be dependent on China</p>
<p>for our antibiotics, for our medicines, for our PPE,</p>
<p>for any of these products</p>
<p>that are important for national survival.</p>
<p>I think all that stuff is gonna come back home.</p>
<p>I think trading with them for other things</p>
<p>might be toys, apparel,</p>
<p>things that start fundamentally strategic the same way.</p>
<p>I think that can continue.</p>
<p>But the thing about trade is it creates interdependence.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that this country</p>
<p>is gonna wanna be dependent on China</p>
<p>for anything strategic anymore.</p>
<p>Two questions for you, David.</p>
<p>What is China&rsquo;s liability, if any, at this point</p>
<p>with this pandemic?</p>
<p>Obviously, if they withheld information</p>
<p>or silenced whistleblowers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole different level.</p>
<p>And then TikTok.</p>
<p>Should we allow TikTok in this country?</p>
<p>Should we, if we&rsquo;re not allowed to have Facebook</p>
<p>or Twitter in China?</p>
<p>Take those questions either way you want.</p>
<p>Well, on liability, I mean, I think,</p>
<p>yeah, their liability is huge.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s still a bunch of questions</p>
<p>we gotta answer around where exactly the virus came from.</p>
<p>But the really fateful decision that I think China made</p>
<p>is when they shut down travel to Wuhan,</p>
<p>to and from Wuhan with respect to other parts of China,</p>
<p>but they let people from Wuhan just kinda leave</p>
<p>to go all over the world.</p>
<p>And so they weren&rsquo;t letting people from Wuhan</p>
<p>go to other parts of China,</p>
<p>but they were able to come to the US.</p>
<p>And so I think they do have a huge liability,</p>
<p>but are we gonna hold them to it?</p>
<p>No, I mean, as a practical matter,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna, it&rsquo;d be a mistake</p>
<p>to try and change the principle of sovereign immunity</p>
<p>in the courts.</p>
<p>But I think in terms of popular opinion, they do have.</p>
<p>There are other ways to,</p>
<p>there are other ways to quote, unquote, punish them.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, and the US is already doing it.</p>
<p>So, for example, the US is limiting</p>
<p>and constraining Huawei&rsquo;s ability to get access to 5G.</p>
<p>And so it really forces China</p>
<p>to either buy European and American equipment,</p>
<p>which is essentially to say that the five eyes</p>
<p>will be able to basically spy into China,</p>
<p>or they have to basically storm into Taiwan</p>
<p>and take over TSMC.</p>
<p>I mean, so there are all these other gambits and strategies</p>
<p>that one can take without getting ideologically caught up</p>
<p>in Chinese human rights,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not gonna change.</p>
<p>I mean, look, all wealth comes from trade,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s at the level of individuals or nations,</p>
<p>wealth comes from trade.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;d be silly for us to say</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just never gonna have trade with China.</p>
<p>But I think that trade also creates interdependence.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re not gonna, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>continue to engage and to depend on them</p>
<p>for things that are vital to our national survival.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s gonna be the change.</p>
<p>And the other thing is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna demand that the trade be more reciprocal.</p>
<p>Take the TikTok example.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s probably gonna happen is that TikTok</p>
<p>will probably be caught up in some larger negotiation.</p>
<p>And is the quid pro quo,</p>
<p>well, Tesla gets to sell cars in China</p>
<p>and TikTok gets to operate in the US, maybe.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think TikTok sort of falls into the,</p>
<p>necessary for national survival category.</p>
<p>It really falls into the reciprocity principle.</p>
<p>And the question, I guess, will be,</p>
<p>are we getting enough in return</p>
<p>to allow them to operate here?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the way that all this commerce</p>
<p>is gonna start working.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>at least we can confront our hypocrisy.</p>
<p>So Jason, I don&rsquo;t disagree with you</p>
<p>about how gross the human rights record is.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a joke that we all sort of cry foul,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the biggest thing in the world</p>
<p>when we can&rsquo;t even clean up our own backyard.</p>
<p>And then meanwhile, we continue to trade with them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just utterly, utterly.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s why I think we have to continue to work</p>
<p>on cleaning our backyard while continuing to enable</p>
<p>the freedom fighters.</p>
<p>First, we gotta clean up our own backyard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, win the game against China.</p>
<p>And winning the game is not basically pushing</p>
<p>for human rights reforms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making sure, as David said,</p>
<p>we have a better trade balance</p>
<p>and making sure that the critical parts</p>
<p>of the supply chain and infrastructure</p>
<p>that America needs for national security</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t dependent on a third party</p>
<p>who have completely different incentives than we do.</p>
<p>Well, and then there&rsquo;s also like soft things</p>
<p>like why is the, you know,</p>
<p>why are we taking American movies and changing the ends</p>
<p>in order to have them sold in China?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re literally corrupting our art</p>
<p>and that incremental dollar that Hollywood&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>or whichever, you know, person trading with China&rsquo;s getting,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not worth giving up</p>
<p>what makes America unique and a leader in the world.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you have any thoughts on China?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s about 112 million people in China</p>
<p>that work in factories.</p>
<p>Factories in China are purpose-built.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re built to make a thing.</p>
<p>And then they got to get retooled</p>
<p>if you want to make another thing.</p>
<p>You take those two facts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to kind of replace China</p>
<p>as a source of production</p>
<p>for a lot of what we consume in this country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two ways you could go.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s two kind of necessities</p>
<p>and you end up with a matrix of like two by two.</p>
<p>You could decouple from China</p>
<p>and basically recreate that same production system</p>
<p>here in the United States</p>
<p>and that just wouldn&rsquo;t fucking be possible.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t have enough people to work.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the ability to do that.</p>
<p>The cost of everything would go up by five X.</p>
<p>We could invent new systems of production</p>
<p>which we have the ability to,</p>
<p>3D printing, biomanufacturing,</p>
<p>all these other kind of really interesting ways</p>
<p>of making stuff that could replace the old factories</p>
<p>that are run in China.</p>
<p>Similar to kind of what maybe Elon has tried to do</p>
<p>with his automated factory with Tesla.</p>
<p>And so through automation, through 3D printing,</p>
<p>through biomanufacturing,</p>
<p>you can kind of change the methods of doing this stuff.</p>
<p>If we could do that, then we could decouple from China.</p>
<p>So the reality is like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know like how we continue to consume things</p>
<p>at the, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a percentage of wallet share that come from China</p>
<p>without rebuilding how you make stuff.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>By the way, I think the reason why that&rsquo;s valuable</p>
<p>is that that&rsquo;s the best way for us to actually get back</p>
<p>to an inflationary cycle as well.</p>
<p>So I completely agree with you.</p>
<p>It is incredibly inefficient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be incredibly costly,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where I think you shift the balance of power</p>
<p>so that instead of all the power sitting</p>
<p>on the side of capital,</p>
<p>you shift it to the side of labor,</p>
<p>labor demands for wages,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden costs go up,</p>
<p>input costs go up, prices go up, inflation exists.</p>
<p>And that fixes a lot of our debt problems.</p>
<p>It fixes our deflationary super cycle.</p>
<p>It fixes a lot of things.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>So if things got more expensive,</p>
<p>it would be good for the economy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be very good.</p>
<p>Yeah, but even, look,</p>
<p>even with maximal, like, look,</p>
<p>that replaced 112 million workers in China</p>
<p>with some number of Americans,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m not sure you could make all the stuff</p>
<p>you need to make here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s other countries too.</p>
<p>I mean, I think people are moving,</p>
<p>Japanese are moving factories to Taiwan and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if we create new methods of production,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re uniquely positioned to do,</p>
<p>we can completely reinvent the wheel</p>
<p>in a lot of industries</p>
<p>and actually produce for the world.</p>
<p>Right now, you know,</p>
<p>China exports physical goods,</p>
<p>the US exports virtual goods.</p>
<p>And if we want to get into the business</p>
<p>of making physical goods,</p>
<p>we have to just do it 10x better.</p>
<p>We have the ability to do that.</p>
<p>We just got to get the fucking will.</p>
<p>So if I were to take $3 trillion of federal money</p>
<p>and, you know, treasury bonds</p>
<p>and hope that they don&rsquo;t turn into junk bonds,</p>
<p>I would basically turn that money</p>
<p>into reinventing the systems of like,</p>
<p>how do we make stuff using these new technologies</p>
<p>that the US is uniquely positioned to capitalize on.</p>
<p>And, you know-</p>
<p>I love this Friedberg leapfrog strategy.</p>
<p>One US worker could make the same thing</p>
<p>that 100 Chinese workers make.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where we got to.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re into this.</p>
<p>Friedberg, you win, you got the best.</p>
<p>And then you got the hottest take in the whole group is,</p>
<p>if we are going to bring back manufacturing,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s leapfrog it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go, let&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to keep letting them make,</p>
<p>you know, socks or iPhones,</p>
<p>but, you know, let&rsquo;s make the next automated factories</p>
<p>and the 3D printing factories here.</p>
<p>And buy a manufacturer.</p>
<p>Anybody have anything they need to promote</p>
<p>or plug at the end of the podcast?</p>
<p>Anything they&rsquo;re working on that people should know about?</p>
<p>No, but I love you guys.</p>
<p>I fucking miss you.</p>
<p>I want to kiss all of you on the mouth.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Just exactly what I was thinking, Chamath.</p>
<p>I was about to, so back at you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been locked down for three months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lost my mind.</p>
<p>I mean, this is May 12th for me.</p>
<p>I think we all got to go to Mexico and see Saks for a,</p>
<p>for a little bit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>I had some friends come down and we play golf</p>
<p>and no one wore masks within our little circle</p>
<p>and nobody got sick.</p>
<p>And, you know.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re all been tested.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t been tested, but we haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have any symptoms.</p>
<p>I got tested twice.</p>
<p>Negative both times.</p>
<p>And it was a very weird thing.</p>
<p>Cause I think I&rsquo;m, Freeberg, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>I would, I should be rooting that I had it</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t do anything to me, right?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>By the way, let me just say one more thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting finding.</p>
<p>This paper came out a few days ago</p>
<p>that shows that 40 to 60% of the population</p>
<p>that has never been exposed to SARS coronavirus two,</p>
<p>the current coronavirus,</p>
<p>already have activated T cells to the virus.</p>
<p>And the reason is that they&rsquo;ve had other coronaviruses</p>
<p>through a common cold</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve developed this immune response.</p>
<p>So this may explain why a large percentage of people</p>
<p>are just so asymptomatic and totally fine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a pretty astounding finding.</p>
<p>And so you could get checked for those other antibodies</p>
<p>or these activated T cells</p>
<p>and know if you&rsquo;re in a good position</p>
<p>to kind of ward off the coronavirus.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing we should probably do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 60% of people that already have this.</p>
<p>By the way, that won&rsquo;t stop the spreading.</p>
<p>That person will still get infected and spread,</p>
<p>but their immune response is such</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll shut the thing down pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So would you call this like some parallel</p>
<p>or shadow herd immunity or individual immunity?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s individual immunity,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s related to just cross-reactivity</p>
<p>with other coronaviruses.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve already developed an immune response</p>
<p>to other coronaviruses that gives us seemingly</p>
<p>a pretty good response to this coronavirus</p>
<p>for more than half, up to half the population.</p>
<p>David, on a percentage basis,</p>
<p>how much do we know about this virus</p>
<p>just as we wrap up here?</p>
<p>If you had to state a percentage of like,</p>
<p>in two years, we&rsquo;re gonna know 100%</p>
<p>or 90% about the virus, whatever it is.</p>
<p>What do we know now?</p>
<p>We know everything about the virus itself.</p>
<p>We are very, like with any virus,</p>
<p>we know very little about how it affects</p>
<p>a specific human based on their genotype,</p>
<p>meaning based on your health and your genes,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what this virus is gonna do to your body.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not gonna know that in two years,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not gonna know that,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know that for most viruses for humans today.</p>
<p>The matching of genotype to genotype</p>
<p>viral to-</p>
<p>But if we understand X amount about the HIV virus</p>
<p>or Ebola, what do we know now?</p>
<p>I mean, maybe Ebola would be the best one.</p>
<p>Like we have pretty good knowledge of that</p>
<p>after X number of years.</p>
<p>What do we know now on a percentage basis</p>
<p>of coronavirus?</p>
<p>We had to guess.</p>
<p>Again, we know everything about the virus itself,</p>
<p>like 100%.</p>
<p>Or okay, about this pandemic.</p>
<p>Yeah, the human response to the virus</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s causing these weird symptoms</p>
<p>with different people and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re probably, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>40%, 30%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve kind of mapped the outcome,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t mapped the progress to the outcome</p>
<p>in the human body.</p>
<p>Fascinating, all right.</p>
<p>All right, listen, great job, Chamath.</p>
<p>Great job, David Sachs.</p>
<p>Great job, David Freeberg.</p>
<p>If you want to subscribe to the podcast,</p>
<p>type in all in with Chamath.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>I love you guys, besties.</p>
<p>All right, shuffle up in DL.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to see that new table.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you in a few minutes, I go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to work.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to work.</p>
<p>Wear your goddamn masks, people.</p>
<p>Wear a mask.</p>
<p>Wear a mask. Be safe.</p>
<p>Okay, be safe.</p>
