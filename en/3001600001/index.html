    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>For nearly four decades</p>
<p>Moore‚Äôs Law has been the governing dynamics of the computer industry</p>
<p>which in turn has impacted every industry.</p>
<p>The exponential performance increase at constant cost and power has slowed.</p>
<p>Yet, computing advance has gone to lightspeed.</p>
<p>The warp drive engine is accelerated computing and the energy source is AI.</p>
<p>The arrival of accelerated computing and AI is timely</p>
<p>as industries tackle powerful dynamics</p>

<p>and composed the melody.</p>
<p>I am AI.</p>
<p>Brought to life by NVIDIA, deep learning, and brilliant minds everywhere.</p>
<p>NVIDIA invented accelerated computing to solve problems that normal computers can‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing is not easy</p>
<p>it requires full-stack invention from chips, systems, networking,</p>
<p>acceleration libraries, to refactoring the applications.</p>
<p>Each optimized stack accelerates an application domain</p>
<p>from graphics, imaging, particle or fluid dynamics</p>
<p>quantum physics, to data processing and machine learning.</p>
<p>Once accelerated, the application can enjoy incredible speed-up, as well as scale-up across many computers.</p>
<p>The combination of speed-up and scale-up has enabled us to achieve a million-X</p>
<p>for many applications over the past decade</p>
<p>helping solve problems previously impossible.</p>
<p>Though there are many examples, the most famous is deep learning.</p>
<p>In 2012, Alex Kerchevsky, Ilya Suskever, and Geoff Hinton needed an insanely fast computer</p>
<p>to train the AlexNet computer vision model.</p>
<p>The researchers trained AlexNet with 14 million images on GeForce GTX 580</p>
<p>processing 262 quadrillion floating-point operations,</p>
<p>and the trained model won the ImageNet challenge by a wide margin, and ignited the Big Bang of AI.</p>
<p>A decade later, the transformer model was invented.</p>
<p>And Ilya, now at OpenAI, trained the GPT-3 large language model to predict the next word.</p>
<p>323 sextillion floating-point operations were required to train GPT-3.</p>
<p>One million times more floating-point operations than to train AlexNet.</p>
<p>The result this time ‚Äì ChatGPT, the AI heard around the world.</p>
<p>A new computing platform has been invented.</p>
<p>The iPhone moment of AI has started.</p>
<p>Accelerated computing and AI have arrived.</p>
<p>Acceleration libraries are at the core of accelerated computing.</p>
<p>These libraries connect to applications which connect to the world‚Äôs industries, forming a network of networks.</p>
<p>Three decades in the making, several thousand applications are now NVIDIA accelerated</p>
<p>with libraries in almost every domain of science and industry.</p>
<p>All NVIDIA GPUs are CUDA-compatible, providing a large install base and significant reach for developers.</p>
<p>A wealth of accelerated applications attract end users, which creates a large market for cloud service providers</p>
<p>and computer makers to serve.</p>
<p>A large market affords billions in R&amp;D to fuel its growth.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has established the accelerated computing virtuous cycle.</p>
<p>Of the 300 acceleration libraries and 400 AI models that span ray tracing and neural rendering</p>
<p>physical, earth, and life sciences, quantum physics and chemistry, computer vision</p>
<p>data processing, machine learning and AI, we updated 100</p>
<p>we updated 100 this year that increase performance and features for our entire installed base.</p>
<p>Let me highlight some acceleration libraries that solve new challenges and open new markets.</p>
<p>The auto and aerospace industries use CFD for turbulence and aerodynamics simulation.</p>
<p>The electronics industry uses CFD for thermal management design.</p>
<p>This is Cadence‚Äôs slide of their new CFD solver accelerated by CUDA.</p>
<p>At equivalent system cost, NVIDIA A100 is 9X the throughput of CPU servers.</p>
<p>Or at equivalent simulation throughput, NVIDIA is 9X lower cost or 17X less energy consumed.</p>
<p>Ansys, Siemens, Cadence, and other leading CFD solvers are now CUDA-accelerated.</p>
<p>Worldwide, industrial CAE uses nearly 100 billion CPU core hours yearly.</p>
<p>Acceleration is the best way to reclaim power and achieve sustainability and Net Zero.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is partnering with the global quantum computing research community.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA Quantum platform consists of libraries and systems for researchers to advance quantum programming models,</p>
<p>system architectures, and algorithms.</p>
<p>cuQuantum is an acceleration library for quantum circuit simulations.</p>
<p>IBM Qiskit, Google Cirq, Baidu Quantum Leaf, QMWare, QuEra, Xanadu Pennylane, Agnostiq, and AWS Bracket</p>
<p>have integrated cuQuantum into their simulation frameworks.</p>
<p>Open Quantum CUDA is our hybrid GPU-Quantum programming model.</p>
<p>IonQ, ORCA Computing, Atom, QuEra, Oxford Quantum Circuits, IQM, Pasqal, Quantum Brilliance, Quantinuum, Rigetti,</p>
<p>Xanadu, and Anyon have integrated Open Quantum CUDA.</p>
<p>Error correction on a large number of qubits is necessary to recover data from quantum noise and decoherence.</p>
<p>Today, we are announcing a quantum control link, developed in partnership with Quantum Machines</p>
<p>that connects NVIDIA GPUs to a quantum computer to do error correction at extremely high speeds.</p>
<p>Though commercial quantum computers are still a decade or two away, we are delighted to support this large and vibrant</p>
<p>research community with NVIDIA Quantum.</p>
<p>Enterprises worldwide use Apache Spark to process data lakes and warehouses</p>
<p>SQL queries, graph analytics, and recommender systems.</p>
<p>Spark-RAPIDS is NVIDIA‚Äôs accelerated Apache Spark data processing engine.</p>
<p>Data processing is the leading workload of the world‚Äôs $500B cloud computing spend.</p>
<p>Spark-RAPIDS now accelerates major cloud data processing platforms, including GCP Dataproc</p>
<p>Amazon EMR, Databricks, and Cloudera.</p>
<p>Recommender systems use vector databases to store, index, search, and retrieve massive datasets of unstructured data.</p>
<p>A new important use-case of vector databases is large language models to retrieve domain-specific or proprietary facts</p>
<p>that can be queried during text generation.</p>
<p>We are introducing a new library, RAFT, to accelerate indexing, loading the data</p>
<p>and retrieving a batch of neighbors for a single query.</p>
<p>We are bringing the acceleration of RAFT to Meta‚Äôs open-source FAISS AI Similarity Search, Milvus open-source vector DB</p>
<p>used by over 1,000 organizations, and Redis with over 4B docker pulls.</p>
<p>Vector databases will be essential for organizations building proprietary large language models.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years ago, operations research scientists Li and Lim posted a series of challenging pickup and delivery problems.</p>
<p>PDP shows up in manufacturing, transportation, retail and logistics, and even disaster relief.</p>
<p>PDP is a generalization of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and is NP-hard</p>
<p>meaning there is no efficient algorithm to find an exact solution.</p>
<p>The solution time grows factorially as the problem size increases.</p>
<p>Using an evolution algorithm and accelerated computing to analyze 30 billion moves per second</p>
<p>NVIDIA cuOpt has broken the world record and discovered the best solution for Li&amp;Lim‚Äôs challenge.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T routinely dispatches 30,000 technicians to service 13 million customers across 700 geographic zones.</p>
<p>Today, running on CPUs, AT&amp;T‚Äôs dispatch optimization takes overnight.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T wants to find a dispatch solution in real time that continuously optimizes for urgent customer needs</p>
<p>and overall customer satisfaction, while adjusting for delays and new incidents that arise.</p>
<p>With cuOpt, AT&amp;T can find a solution 100X faster and update their dispatch in real time.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has adopted a full suite of NVIDIA AI libraries.</p>
<p>In addition to Spark-RAPIDS and cuOPT, they‚Äôre using Riva for conversational AI and Omniverse for digital avatars.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T is tapping into NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI for sustainability, cost savings, and new services.</p>
<p>cuOpt can also optimize logistic services. 400 billion parcels are delivered to 377 billion stops each year.</p>
<p>Deloitte, Capgemini, Softserve, Accenture, and Quantiphi are using NVIDIA cuOpt to help customers optimize operations.</p>
<p>NVIDIA‚Äôs inference platform consists of three software SDKs.</p>
<p>NVIDIA TensorRT is our inference runtime that optimizes for the target GPU.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Triton is a multi-framework data center inference serving software supporting GPUs and CPUs.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office and Teams, Amazon, American Express, and the U.S. Postal Service</p>
<p>are among the 40,000 customers using TensorRT and Triton.</p>
<p>Uber uses Triton to serve hundreds of thousands of ETA predictions per second.</p>
<p>With over 60 million daily users, Roblox uses Triton to serve models for game recommendations</p>
<p>build avatars, and moderate content and marketplace ads.</p>
<p>We are releasing some great new features ‚Äì model analyzer support for model ensembles, multiple concurrent model serving,</p>
<p>and multi-GPU, multi-node inference for GPT-3 large language models.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Triton Management Service is our new software that automates the scaling and orchestration</p>
<p>of Triton inference instances across a data center.</p>
<p>Triton Management Service will help you improve the throughput and cost efficiency of deploying your models.</p>
<p>50-80% of cloud video pipelines are processed on CPUs</p>
<p>consuming power and cost and adding latency.</p>
<p>CV-CUDA for computer vision, and VPF for video processing, are new cloud-scale acceleration libraries.</p>
<p>CV-CUDA includes 30 computer vision operators for detection, segmentation, and classification.</p>
<p>VPF is a python video encode and decode acceleration library.</p>
<p>Tencent uses CV-CUDA and VPF to process 300,000 videos per day.</p>
<p>Microsoft uses CV-CUDA and VPF to process visual search.</p>
<p>Runway is a super cool company that uses CV-CUDA and VPF to process video</p>
<p>for their cloud Generative AI video editing service.</p>
<p>Already, 80% of internet traffic is video.</p>
<p>User-generated video content is driving significant growth and consuming massive amounts of power.</p>

<p>CV-CUDA and VPF are in early access.</p>
<p>NVIDIA accelerated computing helped achieve a genomics milestone</p>
<p>now doctors can draw blood and sequence a patient‚Äôs DNA in the same visit.</p>
<p>In another milestone, NVIDIA-powered instruments reduced the cost of whole genome sequencing to just $100.</p>
<p>Genomics is a critical tool in synthetic biology with applications ranging from drug discovery</p>
<p>and agriculture to energy production.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Parabricks is a suite of AI-accelerated libraries for end-to-end genomics analysis in the cloud or in-instrument.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Parabricks is available in every public cloud and genomics platforms like Terra, DNAnexus, and FormBio.</p>
<p>Today, we‚Äôre announcing Parabricks 4.1 and will run on NVIDIA-accelerated genomics instruments</p>
<p>from PacBio, Oxford Nanopore, Ultima, Singular, BioNano, and Nanostring.</p>
<p>The world‚Äôs $250B medical instruments market is being transformed.</p>
<p>Medical instruments will be software-defined and AI powered.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Holoscan is a software library for real-time sensor processing systems.</p>
<p>Over 75 companies are developing medical instruments on Holoscan.</p>
<p>Today, we are announcing Medtronic, the world leader in medical instruments, and NVIDIA are building their AI platform</p>
<p>for software-defined medical devices.</p>
<p>This partnership will create a common platform for Medtronic systems, ranging from surgical navigation</p>
<p>to robotic-assisted surgery.</p>
<p>Today, Medtronic announced that its next-generation GI Genius system, with AI for early detection of colon cancer</p>
<p>is built on NVIDIA Holoscan and will ship around the end of this year.</p>
<p>The chip industry is the foundation of nearly every industry.</p>
<p>Chip manufacturing demands extreme precision, producing features 1,000 times smaller than a bacterium</p>
<p>and on the order of a single gold atom or a strand of human DNA.</p>
<p>Lithography, the process of creating patterns on a wafer, is the beginning of the chip manufacturing process</p>
<p>and consists of two stages ‚Äì photomask making and pattern projection.</p>
<p>It is fundamentally an imaging problem at the limits of physics.</p>
<p>The photomask is like a stencil of a chip. Light is blocked or passed through the mask</p>
<p>to the wafer to create the pattern.</p>
<p>The light is produced by the ASML EUV extreme ultraviolet lithography system.</p>
<p>Each system is more than a quarter-of-a-billion dollars.</p>
<p>ASML EUV uses a radical way to create light.</p>
<p>Laser pulses firing 50,000 times a second at a drop of tin, vaporizing it, creating a plasma that emits 13.5nm EUV light</p>
<p>nearly X-ray.</p>
<p>Multilayer mirrors guide the light to the mask.</p>
<p>The multilayer reflectors in the mask reticle take advantage of interference patterns of the 13.5nm light</p>
<p>to create finer features down to 3nm.</p>
<p>Magic.</p>
<p>The wafer is positioned within a quarter of a nanometer and aligned 20,000 times a second to adjust for any vibration.</p>
<p>The step before lithography is equally miraculous.</p>
<p>Computational lithography applies inverse physics algorithms to predict the patterns on the mask</p>
<p>that will produce the final patterns on the wafer.</p>
<p>In fact, the patterns on the mask do not resemble the final features at all.</p>
<p>Computational lithography simulates Maxwell‚Äôs equations of the behavior of light passing through optics</p>
<p>and interacting with photoresists.</p>
<p>Computational lithography is the largest computation workload in chip design and manufacturing</p>
<p>consuming tens of billions of CPU hours annually.</p>
<p>Massive data centers run 24/7 to create reticles used in lithography systems.</p>
<p>These data centers are part of the nearly $200 billion annual CAPEX invested by chip manufacturers.</p>
<p>Computational lithography is growing fast as algorithm complexity increases</p>
<p>enabling the industry to go to 2nm and beyond.</p>
<p>NVIDIA today is announcing cuLitho, a library for computational lithography.</p>
<p>cuLitho, a massive body of work that has taken nearly four years, and with close collaborations with TSMC,</p>
<p>ASML, and Synopsys, accelerates computational lithography by over 40X.</p>
<p>There are 89 reticles for the NVIDIA H100.</p>
<p>Running on CPUs, a single reticle currently takes two weeks to process.</p>
<p>cuLitho, running on GPUs, can process a reticle in a single 8-hour shift.</p>
<p>TSMC can reduce their 40,000 CPU servers used for computational lithography by accelerating with cuLitho</p>
<p>on just 500 DGX H100 systems, reducing power from 35MW to just 5MW.</p>
<p>With cuLitho, TSMC can reduce prototype cycle time, increase throughput</p>
<p>and reduce the carbon footprint of their manufacturing, and prepare for 2nm and beyond.</p>
<p>TSMC will be qualifying cuLitho for production starting in June.</p>
<p>Every industry needs to accelerate every workload, so that we can reclaim power and do more with less.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, cloud computing has grown 20% annually into a massive $1T industry.</p>
<p>Some 30 million CPU servers do the majority of the processing.</p>
<p>There are challenges on the horizon.</p>
<p>As Moore‚Äôs Law ends, increasing CPU performance comes with increased power.</p>
<p>And the mandate to decrease carbon emissions is fundamentally at odds with the need to increase data centers.</p>
<p>Cloud computing growth is power-limited.</p>
<p>First and foremost, data centers must accelerate every workload.</p>
<p>Acceleration will reclaim power.</p>
<p>The energy saved can fuel new growth.</p>
<p>Whatever is not accelerated will be processed on CPUs.</p>
<p>The CPU design point for accelerated cloud datacenters differs fundamentally from the past.</p>
<p>In AI and cloud services, accelerated computing offloads parallelizable workloads, and CPUs process other workloads,</p>
<p>like web RPC and database queries.</p>
<p>We designed the Grace CPU for an AI and cloud-first world, where AI workloads are GPU-accelerated</p>
<p>and Grace excels at single-threaded execution and memory processing.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not just about the CPU chip. Datacenter operators optimize for throughput and total cost of ownership of the entire datacenter.</p>
<p>We designed Grace for high energy-efficiency at cloud datacenter scale.</p>
<p>Grace comprises 72 Arm cores connected by a super high-speed on-chip scalable coherent fabric that delivers 3.2 TB/sec</p>
<p>of cross-sectional bandwidth.</p>
<p>Grace Superchip connects 144 cores between two CPU dies over a 900 GB/sec low-power chip-to-chip coherent interface.</p>
<p>The memory system is LPDDR low-power memory, like used in cellphones, that we specially enhanced for use in datacenters.</p>
<p>It delivers 1 TB/s, 2.5x the bandwidth of today‚Äôs systems at 1/8th the power.</p>
<p>The entire 144-core Grace Superchip module with 1TB of memory is only 5x8 inches.</p>
<p>It is so low power it can be air cooled.</p>
<p>This is the computing module with passive cooling.</p>
<p>Two Grace Superchip computers can fit in a single 1U air-cooled server.</p>
<p>Grace‚Äôs performance and power efficiency are excellent for cloud and scientific computing applications.</p>
<p>We tested Grace on a popular Google benchmark, which tests how quickly cloud microservices communicate</p>
<p>and the Hi-Bench suite that tests Apache Spark memory-intensive data processing.</p>
<p>These kinds of workloads are foundational for cloud datacenters.</p>
<p>At microservices, Grace is 1.3X faster than the average of the newest generation x86 CPUs</p>
<p>and 1.2X faster at data processing</p>
<p>And that higher performance is achieved using only 60% of the power measured at the full server node.</p>
<p>CSPs can outfit a power-limited data center with 1.7X more Grace servers, each delivering 25% higher throughput.</p>
<p>At iso-power, Grace gives CSPs 2X the growth opportunity.</p>
<p>Grace is sampling.</p>
<p>And Asus, Atos, Gigabyte, HPE, QCT, Supermicro, Wistron, and ZT are building systems now.</p>
<p>In a modern software-defined data center, the operating system doing virtualization, network, storage, and security can</p>
<p>consume nearly half of the datacenter‚Äôs CPU cores and associated power.</p>
<p>Datacenters must accelerate every workload to reclaim power and free CPUs for revenue-generating workloads.</p>
<p>NVIDIA BlueField offloads and accelerates the datacenter operating system and infrastructure software.</p>
<p>Over two dozen ecosystem partners, including Check Point, Cisco, DDN, Dell EMC</p>
<p>Juniper, Palo Alto Networks, Red Hat, and VMWare,</p>
<p>use BlueField‚Äôs datacenter acceleration technology to run their software platforms more efficiently.</p>
<p>BlueField-3 is in production and adopted by leading cloud service providers, Baidu, CoreWeave, JD.com, Microsoft Azure,</p>
<p>Oracle OCI, and Tencent Games, to accelerate their clouds.</p>
<p>NVIDIA accelerated computing starts with DGX the world‚Äôs AI supercomputer</p>
<p>the engine behind the large language model breakthrough.</p>
<p>I hand-delivered the world‚Äôs first DGX to OpenAI.</p>
<p>Since then, half of the Fortune 100 companies have installed DGX AI supercomputers.</p>
<p>DGX has become the essential instrument of AI.</p>
<p>The GPU of DGX is eight H100 modules.</p>
<p>H100 has a Transformer Engine designed to process models like the amazing ChatGPT,</p>
<p>which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformers.</p>
<p>The eight H100 modules are NVLINK‚Äôd to each other across NVLINK switches to allow fully non-blocking transactions.</p>
<p>The eight H100s work as one giant GPU.</p>
<p>The computing fabric is one of the most vital systems of the AI supercomputer.</p>
<p>400 Gbps ultra-low latency NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand</p>
<p>with in-network processing</p>
<p>connects hundreds and thousands of DGX nodes</p>
<p>into an AI supercomputer.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DGX H100 is the blueprint for customers building AI infrastructure worldwide.</p>
<p>It is now in full production.</p>
<p>I am thrilled that Microsoft announced Azure is opening private previews to their H100 AI supercomputer.</p>
<p>Other systems and cloud services will soon come from Atos, AWS, Cirrascale, CoreWeave, Dell, Gigabyte, Google, HPE,</p>
<p>Lambda Labs, Lenovo, Oracle, Quanta, and SuperMicro.</p>
<p>The market for DGX AI supercomputers has grown significantly.</p>
<p>Originally used as an AI research instrument, DGX AI supercomputers are expanding into operation</p>
<p>running 24/7 to refine data and process AI.</p>

<p>ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney have awakened the world to Generative AI.</p>
<p>These applications‚Äô ease-of-use and impressive capabilities attracted over a hundred million users in just a few months</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT is the fastest-growing application in history.</li>
</ul>
<p>No training is necessary. Just ask these models to do something.</p>
<p>The prompts can be precise or ambiguous. If not clear,</p>
<p>through conversation, ChatGPT learns your intentions.</p>
<p>The generated text is beyond impressive.</p>
<p>ChatGPT can compose memos and poems, paraphrase a research paper, solve math problems,</p>
<p>highlight key points of a contract, and even code software programs.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is a computer that not only runs software but writes software.</p>
<p>Many breakthroughs led to Generative AI.</p>
<p>Transformers learn context and meaning from the relationships and dependencies of data, in parallel and at large scale.</p>
<p>This led to large language models that learn from so much data</p>
<p>they can perform downstream tasks without explicit training.</p>
<p>And diffusion models, inspired by physics, learn without supervision to generate images.</p>
<p>In just over a decade, we went from trying to recognize cats to generating realistic images of a cat</p>
<p>in a space suit</p>
<p>walking on the moon.</p>
<p>Generative AI is a new kind of computer ‚Äî one that we program in human language.</p>
<p>This ability has profound implications. Everyone can direct a computer to solve problems.</p>
<p>This was a domain only for computer programmers.</p>
<p>Now everyone is a programmer.</p>
<p>Generative AI is a new computing platform like PC, internet, mobile, and cloud.</p>
<p>And like in previous computing eras, first-movers are creating new applications</p>
<p>and founding new companies to capitalize on Generative AI‚Äôs ability to automate and co-create.</p>
<p>Debuild lets users design and deploy web applications just by explaining what they want.</p>
<p>Grammarly is a writing assistant that considers context.</p>
<p>Tabnine helps developers write code.</p>
<p>Omnekey generates customized ads and copy.</p>
<p>Kore.ai is a virtual customer service agent.</p>
<p>Jasper generates marketing material. Jasper has written nearly 5 billion words,</p>
<p>reducing time to generate the first draft by 80%.</p>
<p>Insilico uses AI to accelerate drug design.</p>
<p>Absci is using AI to predict therapeutic antibodies.</p>
<p>Generative AI will reinvent nearly every industry.</p>
<p>Many companies can use one of the excellent Generative AI APIs coming to market.</p>
<p>Some companies need to build custom models, with their proprietary data, that are experts in their domain.</p>
<p>They need to set up usage guardrails and refine their models to align</p>
<p>with their company‚Äôs safety, privacy, and security requirements.</p>
<p>The industry needs a foundry, a TSMC, for custom large language models.</p>
<p>Today, we announce the NVIDIA AI Foundations</p>
<p>a cloud service for customers needing to build, refine, and operate</p>
<p>custom LLMlarge language models and Generative AI</p>
<p>trained with their proprietary data</p>
<p>and for their domain-specific tasks.</p>
<p>NVIDIA AI Foundations comprises Language,</p>
<p>Visual, and Biology model-making services.</p>
<p>NVIDIA Nemo is for building custom language text-to-text</p>
<p>generative models.</p>
<p>Customers can bring their model or start with the Nemo pre-trained language models, ranging from GPT-8, GPT-43</p>
<p>and GPT-530 billion parameters.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire process, NVIDIA AI experts will work with you, from creating your proprietary model to operations.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look.</p>
<p>Generative models, like NVIDIA‚Äôs 43B foundational model, learn by training on billions of sentences</p>
<p>and trillions of words.</p>
<p>As the model converges, it begins to understand the relationships between words and their underlying concepts</p>
<p>captured in the weights in the embedding space of the model.</p>
<p>Transformer models use a technique called self attention: a mechanism designed to learn dependencies and relationships</p>
<p>within a sequence of words.</p>
<p>The result is a model that provides the foundation for a ChatGPT-like experience.</p>
<p>These generative models require expansive amounts of data</p>
<p>deep AI expertise for data processing and distributed training</p>
<p>and large scale compute to train, deploy and maintain at the pace of innovation.</p>
<p>Enterprises can fast-track their generative AI adoption</p>
<p>with NVIDIA NeMo service running on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.</p>
<p>The quickest path is starting with one of NVIDIA‚Äôs state-of-the-art</p>
<p>pre-trained foundation models.</p>
<p>With the NeMo service, organizations can easily customize a model</p>
<p>with p-tuning to teach it specialized skills</p>
<p>like summarizing financial documents</p>
<p>creating brand-specific content</p>
<p>and composing emails with personalized writing styles.</p>
<p>Connecting the model to a proprietary knowledge base</p>
<p>ensures that responses are accurate, current</p>
<p>and cited for their business.</p>
<p>Next, they can provide guardrails by adding logic</p>
<p>and monitoring inputs, outputs, toxicity, and bias thresholds</p>
<p>so it operates within a specified domain</p>
<p>and prevents undesired responses.</p>
<p>After putting the model to work, it can continuously improve</p>
<p>with reinforcement learning based on user interactions.</p>
<p>And NeMo‚Äôs playground is available for rapid prototyping before moving to the cloud API</p>
<p>for larger-scale evaluation and application integration.</p>
<p>Sign up for the NVIDIA NeMo service today</p>
<p>to codify your enterprise‚Äôs knowledge into a personalized</p>
<p>AI model that you control.</p>

<p>Our third language domain is biology.</p>
<p>Drug discovery is a nearly $2T industry</p>
<p>with $250B dedicated to R&amp;D.</p>
<p>NVIDIA‚Äôs Clara is a healthcare application framework for imaging</p>
<p>instruments, genomics, and drug discovery.</p>
<p>The industry is now jumping onto generative AI to discover disease targets</p>
<p>design novel molecules or protein-based drugs, and predict the behavior of the medicines in the body.</p>
<p>Insilico Medicine, Exscientia, Absci, and Evozyme, are among hundreds of new AI drug discovery start-ups.</p>
<p>Several have discovered novel targets or drug candidates and have started human clinical trials.</p>
<p>BioNeMo helps researchers create</p>
<p>fine-tune, and serve custom models with their proprietary data.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look.</p>
<p>There are 3 key stages to drug discovery</p>
<p>discovering the biology that causes disease</p>
<p>designing new molecules - whether those are small-molecules, proteins or antibodies</p>
<p>and finally screening how those molecules interact with each other.</p>
<p>Today, Generative AI is transforming every step of the drug discovery process.</p>
<p>NVIDIA BioNeMo Service provides state-of-the-art</p>
<p>generative AI models for drug discovery.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs available as a cloud service, providing instant and easy access to accelerated drug discovery workflows.</p>

<p>NVIDIA AI Foundations, a cloud service, a foundry, for building custom language models and Generative AI.</p>
<p>Since AlexNet a decade ago, deep learning has opened giant new markets ‚Äî automated driving, robotics, smart speakers,</p>
<p>and reinvented how we shop, consume news, and enjoy music.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>AI is at an inflection point as Generative AI has started a new wave of opportunities, driving a step-function increase</p>
<p>in inference workloads.</p>
<p>AI can now generate diverse data, spanning voice, text, images, video, and 3D graphics to proteins and chemicals.</p>
<p>Designing a cloud data center to process Generative AI is a great challenge.</p>
<p>On the one hand, a single type of accelerator is ideal, because it allows the datacenter to be elastic</p>
<p>and handle the unpredictable peaks and valleys of traffic.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no one accelerator can optimally process the diversity of algorithms, models, data types, and sizes.</p>
<p>NVIDIA&rsquo;s One Architecture platform offers both acceleration and elasticity.</p>
<p>Today, we are announcing our new inference platform - four configurations - one architecture - one software stack.</p>
<p>Each configuration is optimized for a class of workloads.</p>
<p>For AI video workloads, we have L4 optimized for video decoding and transcoding, video content moderation,</p>
<p>and video call features like background replacement, relighting, making eye contact,</p>
<p>transcription, and real-time language translation.</p>
<p>Most cloud videos today are processed on CPUs.</p>
<p>One 8-GPU L4 server will replace over a hundred dual-socket CPU servers for processing AI Video.</p>
<p>Snap is a leading user of NVIDIA AI for computer vision and recommender systems.</p>
<p>Snap will use L4 for AV1 video processing, generative AI, and augmented reality.</p>
<p>Snapchat users upload hundreds of millions of videos every day.</p>
<p>Google announced today NVIDIA L4 on GCP.</p>
<p>NVIDIA and Google Cloud are working to deploy major workloads on L4.</p>
<p>Let me highlight five.</p>
<p>First, we‚Äôre accelerating inference for generative AI models for cloud services like Wombo and Descript.</p>
<p>Second, we‚Äôre integrating Triton Inference Server with Google Kubernetes Engine and VertexAI.</p>
<p>Third, we‚Äôre accelerating Google Dataproc with NVIDIA Spark-RAPIDS.</p>
<p>Fourth, we‚Äôre accelerating AlphaFold, and UL2 and T5 large language models.</p>
<p>And fifth, we are accelerating Google Cloud‚Äôs Immersive Stream that renders 3D and AR experiences.</p>
<p>With this collaboration, Google GCP is a premiere NVIDIA AI cloud.</p>
<p>We look forward to telling you even more about our collaboration very soon.</p>
<p>For Omniverse, graphics rendering and generative AI like text-to-image and text-to-video, we are announcing L40.</p>
<p>L40 is up to 10 times the performance of NVIDIA‚Äôs T4, the most popular cloud inference GPU.</p>
<p>Runway is a pioneer in Generative AI.</p>
<p>Their research team was a key creator of Stable Diffusion and its predecessor, Latent Diffusion.</p>
<p>Runway is inventing generative AI models for creating and editing content.</p>
<p>With over 30 AI Magic Tools, their service is revolutionizing the creative process, all from the cloud.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>Runway is making amazing AI-powered video editing and image creation tools accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Powered by the latest generation of NVIDIA GPUs running locally or in the cloud, Runway makes it possible</p>
<p>to remove an object from a video with just a few brush strokes.</p>
<p>Or apply different styles to video using just an input image.</p>
<p>Or change the background or the foreground of a video.</p>
<p>What used to take hours using conventional tools can now be completed with professional broadcast quality results</p>
<p>in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Runway does this by utilizing CV-CUDA, an open-source project that enables developers to build highly efficient</p>
<p>GPU-accelerated pre- and post-processing pipelines for computer vision workloads and scale them into the cloud.</p>
<p>With NVIDIA technology, Runway is able to make impossible things to give the best experience to content creators.</p>
<p>What previously limited pros can now be done by you.</p>
<p>In fact, Runway is used in Oscar-nominated Hollywood films and we are placing this technology</p>
<p>in the hands of the world&rsquo;s creators.</p>
<p>Large language models like ChatGPT are a significant new inference workload.</p>
<p>GPT models are memory and computationally intensive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, inference is a high-volume, scale-out workload and requires standard commodity servers.</p>
<p>For large language model inference, like ChatGPT, we are announcing a new Hopper GPU ‚Äî the PCIE H100</p>
<p>with dual-GPU NVLINK. The new H100 has 94GB of HBM3 memory.</p>
<p>H100 can process the 175-billion-parameter GPT-3</p>
<p>and supporting commodity PCIE servers make it easy to scale out.</p>
<p>The only GPU in the cloud today that can practically process ChatGPT is HGX A100.</p>
<p>Compared to HGX A100 for GPT-3 processing, a standard server with four pairs of H100 with dual-GPU NVLINK</p>
<p>is up to 10X faster.</p>
<p>H100 can reduce large language model processing costs by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Grace Hopper is our new superchip that connects Grace CPU and Hopper GPU over a high-speed 900 GB/sec</p>
<p>coherent chip-to-chip interface.</p>
<p>Grace Hopper is ideal for processing giant data sets like AI databases for recommender systems</p>
<p>and large language models.</p>
<p>Today, CPUs, with large memory, store and query giant embedding tables then transfer results to GPUs for inference.</p>
<p>With Grace-Hopper, Grace queries the embedding tables and transfers the results directly to Hopper</p>
<p>across the high-speed interface ‚Äì 7 times faster than PCIE.</p>
<p>Customers want to build AI databases several orders of magnitude larger.</p>
<p>Grace-Hopper is the ideal engine.</p>
<p>This is NVIDIA&rsquo;s inference platform ‚Äì one architecture for diverse AI workloads,</p>
<p>and maximum datacenter acceleration and elasticity.</p>
<p>The world‚Äôs largest industries make physical things, but they want to build them digitally.</p>
<p>Omniverse is a platform for industrial digitalization that bridges digital and physical.</p>
<p>It lets industries design, build, operate, and optimize physical products and factories digitally,</p>
<p>before making a physical replica.</p>
<p>Digitalization boosts efficiency and speed and saves money.</p>
<p>One use of Omniverse is the virtual bring-up of a factory, where all of its machinery is integrated digitally</p>
<p>before the real factory is built.</p>
<p>This reduces last-minute surprises, change orders, and plant opening delays.</p>
<p>Virtual factory integration can save billions for the world‚Äôs factories.</p>
<p>The semiconductor industry is investing half a trillion dollars to build a record 84 new fabs.</p>
<p>By 2030, auto manufacturers will build 300 factories to make 200 million electric vehicles.</p>
<p>And battery makers are building 100 more mega factories.</p>
<p>Digitalization is also transforming logistics, moving goods through billions of square feet of warehouses worldwide.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at how Amazon uses Omniverse to automate, optimize, and plan its autonomous warehouses.</p>
<p>Amazon Robotics has manufactured and deployed the largest fleet of mobile industrial robots in the world.</p>
<p>The newest member of this robotic fleet is Proteus, Amazon&rsquo;s first fully autonomous warehouse robot.</p>
<p>Proteus is built to move through our facilities using advanced safety, perception, and navigation technology.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how NVIDIA Isaac Sim, built on Omniverse is creating physically accurate, photoreal simulations</p>
<p>to help accelerate Proteus deployments.</p>
<p>Proteus features multiple sensors that include cameras, lidars, and ultrasonic sensors</p>
<p>to power it‚Äôs autonomy software systems.</p>
<p>The Proteus team needed to improve the performance of a neural network that read fiducial markers and helped the robot</p>
<p>determine its location on the map.</p>
<p>It takes lots of data‚Äîand the right kind‚Äîto train the ML models that are driven by the robot sensor input.</p>
<p>With Omniverse Replicator in Isaac Sim, Amazon Robotics was able to generate large photoreal synthetic datasets that improved</p>
<p>the marker detection success rate from 88.6% to 98%.</p>
<p>The use of the synthetic data generated by Omniverse Replicator also sped up development times, from months to days,</p>
<p>as we were able to iteratively test and train our models much faster than when only using real data.</p>
<p>To enable new autonomous capabilities for the expanding fleet of Proteus robots, Amazon Robotics is working towards</p>
<p>closing the gap from simulation to reality, building large scale multi-sensor, multi-robot simulations.</p>
<p>With Omniverse, Amazon Robotics will optimize operations with full fidelity warehouse digital twins.</p>
<p>Whether we&rsquo;re generating synthetic data or developing new levels of autonomy, Isaac Sim on Omniverse</p>
<p>helps the Amazon Robotics team save time and money as we deploy Proteus across our facilities.</p>
<p>Omniverse has unique technologies for digitalization.</p>
<p>And Omniverse is the premier development platform for USD, which serves as a common language that lets teams collaborate</p>
<p>to create virtual worlds and digital twins.</p>
<p>Omniverse is physically based, mirroring the laws of physics.</p>
<p>It can connect to robotic systems and operate with hardware-in-the-loop.</p>
<p>It features Generative AI to accelerate the creation of virtual worlds.</p>
<p>And Omniverse can manage data sets of enormous scale.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made significant updates to Omniverse in every area.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look.</p>
<p>Nearly 300,000 creators and designers have downloaded Omniverse.</p>
<p>Omniverse is not a tool, but a USD network and shared database,</p>
<p>a fabric connecting to design tools used across industries.</p>
<p>It connects, composes, and simulates the assets created by industry-leading tools.</p>
<p>We are delighted to see the growth of Omniverse connections.</p>
<p>Each connection links the ecosystem of one platform to the ecosystems of all the others.</p>
<p>Omniverse‚Äôs network of networks is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>Bentley Systems LumenRT is now connected.</p>
<p>So are Siemens Teamcenter, NX, and Process Simulate, Rockwell Automation Emulate 3D, Cesium, Unity, and many more.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at the digitalization of the $3T auto industry</p>
<p>and see how car companies are evaluating Omniverse in their workflows.</p>
<p>Volvo Cars and GM use Omniverse USD Composer to connect and unify their asset pipelines.</p>
<p>GM connects designers, sculptors, and artists using Alias, Siemens NX, Unreal, Maya, 3ds Max,</p>
<p>and virtually assembles the components into a digital twin of the car.</p>
<p>In engineering and simulation, they visualize the power flow aerodynamics in Omniverse.</p>
<p>For next-generation Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover vehicles, engineers use Drive Sim in Omniverse to generate</p>
<p>synthetic data to train AI models, validate the active-safety system against a virtual NCAP driving test,</p>
<p>and simulate real driving scenarios.</p>
<p>Omniverse‚Äôs generative AI reconstructs previously driven routes into 3D</p>
<p>so past experiences can be reenacted or modified.</p>
<p>Working with Idealworks, BMW uses Isaac Sim in Omniverse to generate synthetic data</p>
<p>and scenarios to train factory robots.</p>
<p>Lotus is using Omniverse to virtually assemble welding stations.</p>
<p>Toyota is using Omniverse to build digital twins of their plants.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz uses Omniverse to build, optimize, and plan assembly lines for new models.</p>
<p>Rimac and Lucid Motors use Omniverse to build digital stores from actual design data that faithfully represent their cars.</p>
<p>BMW is using Omniverse to plan operations across nearly three dozen factories worldwide.</p>
<p>And they are building a new EV factory, completely in Omniverse, two years before the physical plant opens.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>The world‚Äôs industries are accelerating digitalization with over $3.4 trillion being invested in the next three years.</p>
<p>We at BMW strive to be leading edge in automotive digitalization.</p>
<p>With NVIDIA Omniverse and AI we set up new factories faster and produce more efficiently than ever.</p>
<p>This results in significant savings for us.</p>
<p>It all starts with planning ‚Äì a complex process in which we need to connect many tools,</p>
<p>datasets and specialists around the world.</p>
<p>Traditionally, we are limited, since data is managed separately in a variety of systems and tools.</p>
<p>Today, we‚Äôve changed all that.</p>
<p>We are developing custom Omniverse applications to connect our existing tools, know-how and teams</p>
<p>all in a unified view.</p>
<p>Omniverse is cloud-native and cloud-agnostic enabling teams to collaborate across our virtual factories from everywhere.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm about to join a virtual planning session for Debrecen in Hungary ‚Äì our new EV factory ‚Äì opening in 2025.</p>
<p>Let ºs jump in.</p>
<p>Planner 1: Ah, Milan is joining.</p>

<p>Matthias, tell us what‚Äôs happening ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Matthias: So, we just learned the production concept requires some changes.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre now reconfiguring the layout to add a new robot into the cell.</p>
<p>Planner 2: Ok, but if we add a new robot, on the logistics side, we‚Äôll need to move our storage container.</p>
<p>Planner 3: Alright, let&rsquo;s get this new robot in.</p>
<p>Matthias: That‚Äôs perfect. But let‚Äôs double-check - can we run the cell?</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Jensen: Milan, this is just incredible!</p>
<p>Virtual factory integration is essential for every industry.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm so proud to see what our teams did together. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Milan: We are working globally to optimize locally.</p>
<p>After planning, operations is king, and we‚Äôve already started!</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of our virtual plant, I‚Äôd like to invite you to open the first digital factory with me.</p>
<p>Jensen: I‚Äôd be honored. Let‚Äôs do it!</p>
<p>Car companies employ nearly 14 million people.</p>
