    <ul>
<li>Good afternoon, everybody.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison, I&rsquo;m the Dean</p>
<p>of the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series,</p>
<p>which today is co-sponsored by the Berkeley Culture Center.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really truly excited to introduce today&rsquo;s speaker</p>
<p>and a Haas alum, go Bears, Mike Smith.</p>
<p>Mike is a proud graduate of our full-time MBA program.</p>
<p>He currently serves as General Partner and Co-Founder</p>
<p>of Footwork, an early stage venture capital firm.</p>
<p>Footwork was launched in April 2021 with a $175 million fund</p>
<p>and has since invested in eight companies.</p>
<p>Much of Mike&rsquo;s career has been focused</p>
<p>on scaling consumer businesses.</p>
<p>Before launching Footwork, he was an early employee</p>
<p>at Stitch Fix and he helped grow the startup</p>
<p>into a public company.</p>
<p>He served as Stitch Fix&rsquo;s President and COO all the way</p>
<p>from the idea to the IPO stage and beyond</p>
<p>where he oversaw operations, styling, client experience,</p>
<p>merchandise and finance.</p>
<p>Prior to Stitch Fix, Mike was COO at Walmart.com,</p>
<p>overseeing all operations for a $5 billion division,</p>
<p>including one of the most successful multichannel offerings</p>
<p>in the industry.</p>
<p>He currently serves on the boards of MillerKnoll,</p>
<p>Food52, Stitch Fix and Ulta Beauty.</p>
<p>As an alum, I&rsquo;d like to also say a couple words</p>
<p>about how Mike has been an exemplar</p>
<p>of going beyond yourself.</p>
<p>Among a number of things, he&rsquo;s hosted Haas students</p>
<p>for an entrepreneurship immersion visit</p>
<p>and for our executive education program,</p>
<p>he has taught a very successful new black venture VC program</p>
<p>in that program.</p>
<p>Mike, thank you so much for all that you do for Haas</p>
<p>and for taking the time to speak with us today.</p>
<p>We are really grateful to have you back on campus</p>
<p>and we really look forward to a lively</p>
<p>and informative discussion.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s talk will be led by Jenny Chatman,</p>
<p>a well-known professor here and the Co-Director</p>
<p>of the Berkeley Culture Center.</p>
<p>(audience applauds) - Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thanks, Ann.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi. - Hi.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, Mike, I treasure our&hellip;</p>
<p>I was counting how many years it is.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been friends for 25 years or close to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mike] That&rsquo;s right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And you were a student in my Leading People class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Mike] I was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A memorable student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Mike] Well, I hope so</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs) in a good way, hopefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, in a good way.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to complete the cycle, your wife, Kelly,</p>
<p>was my daughter&rsquo;s fourth grade teacher.</p>
<p>So we have that.</p>
<p>We wrote a case about you based on your unbelievable work</p>
<p>at Walmart.com, like the innovative site-to-store process</p>
<p>which you originated and did so much to make happen,</p>
<p>your massive success there.</p>
<p>It was so successful that Walmart spun back in Walmart.com</p>
<p>and then wouldn&rsquo;t let us publish the case.</p>
<p>So that was good and bad in how it worked out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve inspired perhaps at this point thousands</p>
<p>of our MBA students by coming to class</p>
<p>and talking to them about your career.</p>
<p>And most importantly, because of your focus at Stitch Fix</p>
<p>in men&rsquo;s, my husband is now very well dressed,</p>
<p>which is probably the thing that I&rsquo;m most thankful for.</p>
<p>So let me start by thanking you for your support</p>
<p>of the school and for conveying to you just how proud we are</p>
<p>of all you&rsquo;ve accomplished.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thrilled to be hosting you here today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, thank you and I will say she&rsquo;s become Jenny to me,</li>
</ul>
<p>but Professor Chatman taught me everything I think I needed</p>
<p>to know about leadership in your class.</p>
<p>And so I am grateful to be a Haas alum</p>
<p>and excited to be here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, thanks.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s completely not true</p>
<p>because with students like you,</p>
<p>all we try to do is try not to mess up the raw material</p>
<p>and that maybe happened in this case.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna go through and ask some questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask some questions of Mike and then about 1:10,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna turn it over for audience questions,</p>
<p>so you all will have a chance to ask some questions as well.</p>
<p>But let me start with a really broad question,</p>
<p>which is for people who don&rsquo;t yet know you,</p>
<p>if you could lay out your career a little bit</p>
<p>and what the stages were</p>
<p>since you were a student here at Haas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, so I graduated from Haas in 1998 and I&rsquo;d say</li>
</ul>
<p>that the first six years of my career was really trying</p>
<p>to find my way in terms of my career lane</p>
<p>and what my calling was, so to speak.</p>
<p>And so I worked two years on Wall Street and then two years</p>
<p>at an early stage company that wasn&rsquo;t in the bio,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good story offline of failure</p>
<p>and actually learning a lot from said adventure.</p>
<p>And then worked in corporate development</p>
<p>at a software company.</p>
<p>And so claim to fame I think was nine years at Walmart.com</p>
<p>and then nine years at Stitch Fix.</p>
<p>And I think what I most appreciate about the journey</p>
<p>and the arc is just some of the leadership principles</p>
<p>that I felt like I learned here and certainly show up</p>
<p>in the leadership values of the school.</p>
<p>Student always I think is something I&rsquo;m really&hellip;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t codified at the time I was here, I don&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>And then confidence without attitude, I think is just one</p>
<p>that I think is just an interesting</p>
<p>and important leadership principle.</p>
<p>And so the one thing I&rsquo;d say is</p>
<p>that these journeys are super windey,</p>
<p>they are rarely up and to the right.</p>
<p>I joke that I literally did this at 16 years old</p>
<p>wrote out on a piece of paper how I was gonna go</p>
<p>from a 16-year-old high school student</p>
<p>to be a public company CEO by age 40 to 42.</p>
<p>I gave myself a range there.</p>
<p>And it just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not the way these things work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m grateful that I had plenty of people</p>
<p>along my journey that helped me see the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I remember you telling me that</li>
</ul>
<p>at that diner over in San Francisco.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Mike] Yep. Yeah.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Mike laughs)</p>
<p>So you were COO at Walmart.com and instrumental</p>
<p>in helping Walmart become digital.</p>
<p>You were one of the first five employees at Stitch Fix</p>
<p>and in both cases, you were a primary force</p>
<p>in scaling up the companies.</p>
<p>Walmart.com as I said was spun back in</p>
<p>and dramatically bolstered by the success</p>
<p>that you had created.</p>
<p>You took Stitch Fix public.</p>
<p>And so a broad question about what did you keep in mind</p>
<p>when growing talent at each company</p>
<p>and what lessons have you learned about talent management</p>
<p>and who you wanna bring on the bus with you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, a few lessons.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say first and foremost, there&rsquo;s so many leaders</p>
<p>that talk about this concept of hiring better or smarter</p>
<p>than yourself and I think very, very few leaders do that.</p>
<p>I understand academically why that&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>It requires you to be self-aware,</p>
<p>to know what you&rsquo;re good at, what you&rsquo;re not good at</p>
<p>and to try to hire to gaps and frankly,</p>
<p>hire smarter and better than you are,</p>
<p>which is intimidating at times.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna hire someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s actually smarter than you</p>
<p>and you give them the stage,</p>
<p>then your boss probably wonders why you have your job.</p>
<p>And I do think that that was just something</p>
<p>that I tried to do in my career</p>
<p>and really think about talent that way.</p>
<p>I also&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, there&rsquo;s a very good friend in the audience</p>
<p>who worked in my group, but I used to talk</p>
<p>about how I like to hire PITAs, which are pains in the arse.</p>
<p>And what PITAs do when you work with them</p>
<p>is they drive you to be a great leader.</p>
<p>They really demand a lot of you, they have high expectations</p>
<p>for themselves and who you are as a leader</p>
<p>and they just don&rsquo;t accept not being good at the job.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another I think philosophy</p>
<p>that I had hopefully is trying to hire PITAs</p>
<p>because it forces you to be a great leader.</p>
<p>And then I think there&rsquo;s a lot around intentionality</p>
<p>around talent development that I hopefully did,</p>
<p>which was have these 24 vision and value statements</p>
<p>that I share with my direct reports</p>
<p>when I start working with them.</p>
<p>And one of them is seeking a social contract</p>
<p>with people I work with.</p>
<p>And the goal is that here&rsquo;s a very tangible example</p>
<p>of where I never wanna be surprised</p>
<p>by someone leaving the company.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever wanna get two weeks notice as an example.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to avoid that situation is really honest conversations</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re doing well, what you&rsquo;re not doing well,</p>
<p>where do you wanna go in your career</p>
<p>so that you can be an enabler of where they wanna go,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not in your current company.</p>
<p>And so I fortunately, I&rsquo;ve had one incident</p>
<p>where I was surprised.</p>
<p>So I do really believe strongly that&rsquo;s a failure</p>
<p>of the leader when you get surprised like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just something I think philosophically</p>
<p>that I sought when working with the folks,</p>
<p>the wonderful folks I&rsquo;ve gotten to work with over the years.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do you find PITAs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They find you in some ways.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, I think in some ways, you get known as someone</p>
<p>that is really open to hiring smarter</p>
<p>and better than yourself.</p>
<p>And then they have friends, they hang out in circles</p>
<p>of wanting to be challenged.</p>
<p>And then I think you can also find them</p>
<p>at great business schools, a lot of Haas folks</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve worked with over the years.</p>
<p>And they show up really early</p>
<p>in an interview process, they do.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s an element of I don&rsquo;t want&hellip;</p>
<p>If I have seven direct reports,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want everyone being challenging all at the same time</p>
<p>at the same rate because that is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>And I make it very clear where my line is</p>
<p>of how much PITA I will allow</p>
<p>in the time that we&rsquo;re allowing it.</p>
<p>But overall, I think they&rsquo;re easy to spot.</p>
<p>I felt like I was one, too, to be honest.</p>
<p>I demanded a lot of my bosses, I had high expectations</p>
<p>for myself and for the company and for any leader</p>
<p>that I got to work with.</p>
<p>And so I think they self-identify in a lot of ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I remember that in class, actually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Mike] Oh wow, nice!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Mike laughs) (audience laughs)</p>
<p>I do, I think that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>(Mike laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, so Stitch Fix goes public</li>
</ul>
<p>and you were there a couple more years</p>
<p>and then you decide to leave to start Footwork.</p>
<p>What were your motives for making that move?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, it was unusual, I would say,</li>
</ul>
<p>in that if folks that knew me</p>
<p>had talked to me between call it 2012 and 2020</p>
<p>when I made the decision if I would ever work</p>
<p>in venture capital, let alone start my own firm,</p>
<p>they would&rsquo;ve said, no way.</p>
<p>I had a very challenging relationship</p>
<p>with the ecosystem as we were trying</p>
<p>to raise money for Stitch Fix, it was very challenging.</p>
<p>Katrina Lake, the Founder and CEO of Stitch Fix,</p>
<p>has talked openly about this in different podcasts.</p>
<p>And it just wasn&rsquo;t well received and frankly, our experience</p>
<p>with the ecosystem was rough, to say the least.</p>
<p>And so I think what end up happening in 2020,</p>
<p>a few things happened.</p>
<p>One, there was a lot of racial unrest</p>
<p>with the George Floyd murder and other things</p>
<p>that made me take pause and really think</p>
<p>about a little bit like legacy and impact and bigger things</p>
<p>and just what I wanna work on every day.</p>
<p>There was my partner, Nikhil Basu Trivedi, who reached out</p>
<p>and asked if I was interested in starting a firm with him</p>
<p>and I knew that I was very aligned in core values</p>
<p>and principles with Nikhil and very grateful</p>
<p>that he was even willing to chat with me about it.</p>
<p>And then I just, instead of&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is a good analogy,</p>
<p>but I remember in different jobs that I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>where I had challenges with a function</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t responsible for where I was like,</p>
<p>why is that function not operating well?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the classic, well, if you think you know better,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you run it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in charge of it.</p>
<p>And I think there was an element</p>
<p>of I&rsquo;ve had so much challenge with the ecosystem,</p>
<p>meaning not as many black and brown and women founders,</p>
<p>not as many black, brown and women check writers.</p>
<p>And certainly on the LP or the investor side,</p>
<p>finding the same case.</p>
<p>People that were investing in venture funds</p>
<p>not seeing enough underrepresented folks.</p>
<p>Instead of complaining about it,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you try to do something about it?</p>
<p>And so I think it was just this combination and cocktail</p>
<p>of wanting to have impact given what was going on</p>
<p>in the world, really loving most of the ecosystem</p>
<p>in terms of the founder perspective</p>
<p>and what innovation exists out</p>
<p>in the Bay Area in particular.</p>
<p>And then instead of just talking about it,</p>
<p>trying to do something different.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you started the company with Nikhil</li>
</ul>
<p>and the two of you came together</p>
<p>with really different backgrounds and perspectives.</p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit about how that&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>and how you make a partnership like that work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, we were very intentional that we wanted</li>
</ul>
<p>to have differences in everything.</p>
<p>So one of our core pillars of the firm</p>
<p>and what we think is our differentiation,</p>
<p>one of the few areas of differentiation</p>
<p>is this operator-investor combination</p>
<p>being the killer combination that really helps founders</p>
<p>and founding teams scale themselves.</p>
<p>And Nikhil, for those that don&rsquo;t know him,</p>
<p>went to Princeton, he has been an investor for 11 years.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s grown up as an investor architect</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an amazing investor.</p>
<p>And I had never invested.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have an angel portfolio,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never been an investor.</p>
<p>And I think we think that those differences</p>
<p>actually are very, very helpful.</p>
<p>Nikhil is amazing at understanding product market fit</p>
<p>of a company and really understanding what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>from a metrics perspective to get to the next round.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s seen so many different companies</p>
<p>and invested in so many different amazing companies</p>
<p>that have achieved amazing success,</p>
<p>like Farmer&rsquo;s Dog and Frame.io and Imperfect Foods.</p>
<p>And so he has seen a range of things</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been very focused on eCommerce</p>
<p>in Walmart.com and Stitch Fix.</p>
<p>And I do think that having seen two hypergrowth companies,</p>
<p>one that we called a startup at Walmart.com,</p>
<p>but the reality was just like</p>
<p>when you actually don&rsquo;t have to raise capital,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really a startup.</p>
<p>Where at Stitch Fix, we actually had</p>
<p>to raise capital to achieve.</p>
<p>And so you just have different learnings</p>
<p>and I think experiences</p>
<p>that you can bring to bear as an operator.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re different on lots of different dimensions,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s a lot younger than I am, he went</p>
<p>to a fancy school I like to make fun of in Princeton.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jenny] We&rsquo;re fancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re fancy, true.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A little fancy here. (audience laughs)</p>
<p>We have different styles.</p>
<p>We talk about he&rsquo;s pretty intense,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sometimes overly chill</p>
<p>and we learn that when he&rsquo;s really intense</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really chill,</p>
<p>we need to work on our partnership there</p>
<p>and I need to come closer to him</p>
<p>and he needs to come closer to me.</p>
<p>So it is like a marriage.</p>
<p>You have to work at making it work.</p>
<p>But we are super grateful to be in business together.</p>
<p>We have amazing investors that put us in business</p>
<p>in April of last year and it&rsquo;s been a blast.</p>
<p>And I do think some of the core pillars and differentiation</p>
<p>that we thought would show up in terms of how we work</p>
<p>with founders has been very true and we&rsquo;re excited about&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, we have a lot to prove,</p>
<p>but it we&rsquo;re excited about our start so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, so you have now seen and been part of organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>at different stages of growth and different sizes.</p>
<p>So when you think about forming a culture</p>
<p>in a startup organization, like as you look</p>
<p>at a potential firm that you might invest in,</p>
<p>what are some of the things that you&rsquo;re looking for?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I can certainly answer the question</li>
</ul>
<p>in a few different ways.</p>
<p>So first, when we look at companies, we are evaluating</p>
<p>whether there are signs of product market fit,</p>
<p>whether is it a good market for their product or service</p>
<p>and we evaluate the founder.</p>
<p>And we have these three things that we basically look for,</p>
<p>which is hungry and humble, know your business inside</p>
<p>and out and if someone is a talent magnet.</p>
<p>I would say trying to figure out whether</p>
<p>they have a good culture at the existing time</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to make this decision is a sub-bullet</p>
<p>underneath how we&rsquo;re evaluating the founder.</p>
<p>But our strategy is to lead rounds,</p>
<p>so we try to be the biggest check and lead either a seed</p>
<p>or series A investment and we take board seats.</p>
<p>And part of the reason we do that</p>
<p>is because we wanna be very active in company-building</p>
<p>and very active in culture definition.</p>
<p>And I do think, we only have eight investments,</p>
<p>but I think all of our companies</p>
<p>and founders lean on us pretty heavily</p>
<p>for company-building and culture.</p>
<p>And I like that level of accountability,</p>
<p>both that we can drive, but also that we&rsquo;re accountable</p>
<p>for as fiduciaries as board members.</p>
<p>But in the evaluation process,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re mostly only spending time with the founding team</p>
<p>and not going as deep in the company</p>
<p>because these processes are super fast.</p>
<p>The best companies are getting from talking to investors</p>
<p>to signing a term sheet, it could be as fast as two weeks</p>
<p>or as fast as a week.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t have as much time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s super important to us</p>
<p>to make sure that the companies that we back</p>
<p>and the founders we back care deeply about these issues</p>
<p>and create great cultures to work in.</p>
<p>And I think the board seat and just the way we work</p>
<p>with founders helps us have a better chance</p>
<p>of succeeding on that.</p>
<ul>
<li>And so how would you define a great culture,</li>
</ul>
<p>taking all your experience together?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a big question</li>
</ul>
<p>that I probably don&rsquo;t have a great answer for,</p>
<p>other than I think cultures need to be super intentional</p>
<p>and you actually have to work at them.</p>
<p>I remember at different points at Stitch Fix,</p>
<p>one of my favorite people, this woman, Margo Downs,</p>
<p>would be asked this question in our onboarding process.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the culture like</p>
<p>&ldquo;and how are you going to continue to drive it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she would say, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just be a consumer</p>
<p>&ldquo;of the culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You actually have to help develop the culture</p>
<p>&ldquo;and drive accountability of the culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be passive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think cultures can be or should be passive.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re really important to be clear.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an important part of culture.</p>
<p>I think one of the things that drives me crazy is</p>
<p>where if the senior folks don&rsquo;t live and breathe</p>
<p>and show up as the culture as defined,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I loved about Stitch Fix</p>
<p>in the early days is that Katrina really wanted</p>
<p>to develop that culture early.</p>
<p>So we did a culture-defining exercise</p>
<p>with four full-time people at the company and six interns</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how much she cared</p>
<p>about being clear about that.</p>
<p>Now, what I loved about it the most was that,</p>
<p>okay, now we have definition of what good looks like</p>
<p>in terms of what our expectations are.</p>
<p>And what I especially loved about it</p>
<p>is now we have a definition of how leaders show up</p>
<p>and managers show up.</p>
<p>And you could have language</p>
<p>around if we weren&rsquo;t showing up that way</p>
<p>to be able to drive better accountability</p>
<p>on those dimensions.</p>
<p>So I think I don&rsquo;t have a great answer,</p>
<p>but I do think it&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>I think you need to be intentional, I think you have</p>
<p>to drive accountability to make sure</p>
<p>that it lives up every day.</p>
<p>And I do think some of the more challenging companies</p>
<p>are the ones that allow leaders to show up different</p>
<p>than what the cultural norms should be</p>
<p>or the way they&rsquo;re defined.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, well, and there&rsquo;s actually research that shows</li>
</ul>
<p>that startups that are intentional about their cultures,</p>
<p>there was actually a study done at Stanford</p>
<p>where when founders were intentional about culture,</p>
<p>faster to IPO, came out at a higher price.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of financial gains as a result of that.</p>
<p>So that dovetails closely with what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mike] No tough ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve answered a bunch of them,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so I have to skip down here.</p>
<p>Ah, so you&rsquo;ve mentioned in the past</p>
<p>that Footwork is interested in investing</p>
<p>in firms led by people of color and women,</p>
<p>perhaps people who have been less represented</p>
<p>in the business community.</p>
<p>Why is it important to you</p>
<p>to prioritize diversity in business?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think fundamentally, Nikhil and I believe</li>
</ul>
<p>the academic work that diverse teams drive better outcomes.</p>
<p>And he is a British Indian immigrant, I&rsquo;m African American.</p>
<p>Diversity across every dimension is one of the core pillars.</p>
<p>Diversity across every dimension</p>
<p>being a competitive advantage is one of our core principles</p>
<p>of the firm&rsquo;s founding.</p>
<p>We do not have inputs</p>
<p>to saying we only wanna back underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>We do expect based on our core pillars</p>
<p>and the way we look for founders that the output is</p>
<p>that we have a very diverse portfolio.</p>
<p>And that has been true.</p>
<p>The N is super small, so it&rsquo;s not statistically significant</p>
<p>with eight portfolio companies.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re proud of the fact that the majority</p>
<p>of our investments are led by people of color or women.</p>
<p>So we wanted to be the output, but I think it just comes</p>
<p>from just truly believing what we&rsquo;ve seen in operating,</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s seen in investing,</p>
<p>that diverse teams produce better results.</p>
<p>And we understand some of the challenges that diverse teams</p>
<p>as I think I learned in your class, too,</p>
<p>sometimes you have to move slower</p>
<p>because you wanna take everyone&rsquo;s point of view,</p>
<p>but that driving, hearing all these different perspectives,</p>
<p>especially in the world we&rsquo;re in today and trying to get</p>
<p>to best product, best service, you really do need to think</p>
<p>about more perspectives than just one narrow either gender</p>
<p>or race perspective to get to the best ideas.</p>
<p>And so we just believe that in our core.</p>
<p>We started the firm with that belief and the output</p>
<p>of our investments so far have lived up to that.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t hear anything</li>
</ul>
<p>after he said he learned that in my class.</p>
<ul>
<li>I know, I know. (Jenny laughs)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Mike laughs) (audience laughs)</p>
<p>I did, though.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you for that. - You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you. - I heard it all actually.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It was accurate, you would&rsquo;ve gotten an A.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you. (audience laughs)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I got an A in your class, though.</p>
<p>I think I gotta go back and look.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I think it was an A-minus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s what I thought, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, is there a HIPAA rule on that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with that.</p>
<p>I just granted it to you, so it&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<ul>
<li>And it was before we had codified,</li>
</ul>
<p>questioned the status quo and just on that point,</p>
<p>we cultivate questioning the status quo not just</p>
<p>among our students, but among the faculty</p>
<p>and among the staff.</p>
<p>And I gotta tell you, it&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>
<p>It is exhausting.</p>
<p>People are constantly looking for better ways</p>
<p>of doing things and they&rsquo;re pushing ideas,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s totally worth it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way that you get the cutting edge ideas</p>
<p>and the best innovation.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is, but I do think you also have draw lines and say&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the phrases that probably was not the most&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a tough phrase, like, hey, we gotta just do our jobs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done talking about stuff,</p>
<p>we actually need to get it done.</p>
<p>And so you have to allow collaboration and different points</p>
<p>of view and challenge the status quo,</p>
<p>but if you spend all your time challenging the status quo,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to get things done and execute.</p>
<p>And in the fast-moving world of today,</p>
<p>you actually have to make a decision and move forward.</p>
<p>Happiness is not what&hellip;</p>
<p>Collective happiness I think is hard to achieve.</p>
<p>You actually need to, if you&rsquo;re gonna allow diverse opinions</p>
<p>and allow challenge, there are gonna be people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t love the final decision that you make.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s unacceptable is not having voices heard.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve hopefully tried to emulate allowing voices</p>
<p>to be heard and different points of view, but ultimately,</p>
<p>we make a decision and we have to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna deviate just slightly</li>
</ul>
<p>and ask you if you&rsquo;d be willing to share</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve come to some of my classes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked to students about some</p>
<p>of the failure experiences that you had.</p>
<p>And I remember you coining the term, pity city.</p>
<p>You can go to pity city, but you can&rsquo;t stay there very long.</p>
<p>I thought that was so helpful as a metaphor.</p>
<p>For our students who are pushing through careers</p>
<p>that are unlikely to be linear,</p>
<p>how do you have the resilience to move to the next step</p>
<p>and absorb the disappointments?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can give an example</p>
<p>and talk about how you dealt with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, and I think it changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the more experience you have with failure,</p>
<p>the more resilient you obviously get.</p>
<p>And you can then go back and be like, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad</p>
<p>when I worked at a digital smell company</p>
<p>in the dot com bust and my boss at the next job,</p>
<p>every time I see him, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smell-O-Vision, it&rsquo;s Mike Smith from Smell-O-Vision!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Jenny laughs) (audience laughs)</p>
<p>You have to be okay with that and fail.</p>
<p>And I think you learn that you don&rsquo;t have to&hellip;</p>
<p>Not only is pity city not that bad,</p>
<p>you can learn a lot from those failures.</p>
<p>So a couple things, one, that phrase,</p>
<p>I wrote about it recently in LinkedIn</p>
<p>and it had some ridiculous amount of impressions</p>
<p>from telling this story about getting passed over</p>
<p>for the CEO job at Walmart.com,</p>
<p>but I should give credit to where credit is due.</p>
<p>Marka Hansen, the former President of Gap North America,</p>
<p>talked about that and she&rsquo;s a long-time mentor of mine</p>
<p>and basically said, &ldquo;You can go to pity city,</p>
<p>&ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t take up residence there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You actually have to get over the tough thing.</p>
<p>So the two very tangible examples for me were going</p>
<p>to an early stage company, leaving Morgan Stanley,</p>
<p>going to an early stage company,</p>
<p>basically telling my parents I was leaving</p>
<p>this big great Wall Street job and go into this company</p>
<p>that was producing, creating a box</p>
<p>that would produce smells.</p>
<p>My parents thought I was, as they should, cuckoo crazy,</p>
<p>like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>You went to business school to get this fancy job</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re gonna go do that.</p>
<p>And it was a complete failure.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It was product market fit problems,</p>
<p>we had culture challenges.</p>
<p>There were a lot of things that just didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>about unfortunately the idea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to get a job after you&rsquo;ve worked in that.</p>
<p>Now, I think this is an area of the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very special.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no badge of honor that comes with it,</p>
<p>but there are lots of&hellip;</p>
<p>I think with innovation comes an okay with failing</p>
<p>and moving forward and the common, fail fast, fail forward.</p>
<p>And I was fortunate enough that I had a good network</p>
<p>from Haas and allowed me to get back on my feet</p>
<p>and get a great job the next time.</p>
<p>And the other one was the one I wrote about,</p>
<p>which is feeling like I was preparing myself</p>
<p>for being CEO of Walmart.com,</p>
<p>being told I was gonna become the MC at Walmart.com</p>
<p>and then not getting that job was extremely painful.</p>
<p>It was so hard.</p>
<p>But no one&rsquo;s gonna feel sorry for me to go to Stitch Fix</p>
<p>and be employee number five</p>
<p>and be a really senior person there and helping build that</p>
<p>with Katrina and an amazing team from five people</p>
<p>to 10,000 people and going public in 2017,</p>
<p>and so all the good fortunes that have come as a result</p>
<p>of that experience.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s just a little bit of understanding</p>
<p>that it really is okay that it&rsquo;s not linear.</p>
<p>I think that was hard for me in the first decade</p>
<p>of my career.</p>
<p>I just, because I had written down</p>
<p>exactly what jobs I was gonna have from 16 to 40 to 42,</p>
<p>some deviation of that was hard for me</p>
<p>to be like, oh, this isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>And then I think the other big learning for me was</p>
<p>being again fortunate to have amazing people around me</p>
<p>that knew me at the core, knew what I wanted</p>
<p>and actually supported helping me find things</p>
<p>that were amazing.</p>
<p>The reason I got the job at Walmart.com</p>
<p>is because I think four of the first 15 people</p>
<p>at Walmart.com are Haas grads, three in my cohort here.</p>
<p>And they were like,</p>
<p>hey, I know he doesn&rsquo;t have retail experience,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I know he doesn&rsquo;t have ops experience, but he&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And they helped me get the job.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of cultivating that network,</p>
<p>but also having people that would stick their neck out,</p>
<p>frankly, to help support me get to the next job.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I hope you all will continue</li>
</ul>
<p>to promote your colleagues as well.</p>
<p>So I wanted to come back to the theme</p>
<p>of diversity and inclusiveness,</p>
<p>which seem to be core values of Footworks.</p>
<p>What is your position on&hellip;</p>
<p>I think organizations are really struggling</p>
<p>to figure out how to create inclusive environments.</p>
<p>I think there is more certainty out there</p>
<p>that this is a good thing, but I think there&rsquo;s still a gap</p>
<p>in actually being able to put it into practice.</p>
<p>So what are some insights that you have</p>
<p>about inclusiveness in particular</p>
<p>once people have joined organizations</p>
<p>or setting up your entrepreneurs in a network</p>
<p>that enables them to be successful,</p>
<p>how do you make things like that happen?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I&rsquo;d probably go to more of a bottoms-up answer to it</li>
</ul>
<p>of giving tangible examples</p>
<p>of where I&rsquo;ve seen companies do it well</p>
<p>and companies and leaders that don&rsquo;t do as well.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s the old adage that you have two ears</p>
<p>and one mouth and you should use them proportionately.</p>
<p>And I believe that that adage</p>
<p>really helps drive inclusivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jenny] What was that, two years?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two ears and one mouth</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and you should use them proportionately,</p>
<p>just listen more than talk.</p>
<p>And I think if you organically people listen,</p>
<p>if they listen more than they talk,</p>
<p>it allows for more voices to be heard</p>
<p>and you seek out other people&rsquo;s opinions</p>
<p>because you want to learn from them</p>
<p>or you feel like they have something valuable to share.</p>
<p>And so I look for teams and in my own operating model,</p>
<p>how much am I talking versus listening</p>
<p>and making sure that voices are heard?</p>
<p>This is again a very minute example, but in the world</p>
<p>of Zoom, if someone comes off mute but I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking, I&rsquo;m talking and someone comes off mute,</p>
<p>I wanna make sure that that person</p>
<p>actually gets their voice heard.</p>
<p>So many times, I just watch it.</p>
<p>Someone comes off mute and the person just keeps talking</p>
<p>and you never go back to the person that came off mute</p>
<p>to figure out what their perspective is.</p>
<p>I was in a board meeting three weeks ago</p>
<p>where I was getting ready to say something</p>
<p>and someone jumped ahead.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t malice, it wasn&rsquo;t poor intentions,</p>
<p>but the CEO asked later,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mike, did you have a point that you wanted to raise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That felt super inclusive to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that happens most of the time.</p>
<p>I think people just move on.</p>
<p>And so I think being observant and listening</p>
<p>and calling on people when you feel like</p>
<p>they have something really important to say</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause you&rsquo;ve heard it in a one-on-one</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve had with them or you&rsquo;ve heard it</p>
<p>in another meeting and you think they have a perspective</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll really help, even if they&rsquo;re more junior</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re shy or whatever.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna make them uncomfortable, but you definitely,</p>
<p>if you know that they have a point of view</p>
<p>that would really advance the conversation,</p>
<p>just ask for them to share it.</p>
<p>And I think very few people do that effectively.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to pretend</p>
<p>that I do it great all the time either,</p>
<p>but I do think if you have a belief</p>
<p>that you want the right people around the table,</p>
<p>you want diverse opinions, you want to hear about those,</p>
<p>then your behavior should match including those voices</p>
<p>and your actions should show that, too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, and that&rsquo;s a very cultural way</li>
</ul>
<p>of thinking about inclusiveness,</p>
<p>which seems like this big huge challenge,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re breaking it down into the behavioral norms</p>
<p>that you wanna put in place</p>
<p>so that people regularly are listening to each other</p>
<p>and circling back and the rest of it, super helpful.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re close to our time.</p>
<p>Last time question from me is what advice do you have</p>
<p>for our students who are gonna be graduating</p>
<p>in the next year or two?</p>
<p>What are some of the kernels</p>
<p>of expertise you wanna offer to them?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a daunting question.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a daunting question because I remember when I sat</li>
</ul>
<p>in that seat, I definitely had a little bit of judgment</p>
<p>about people like me answering that question.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>Do you know how hard my life is</p>
<p>and you think you&rsquo;ve done all these great things&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jenny] How old is that guy anyway?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, I was a PITA in your class, remember?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, exactly. (Jenny laughs)</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s probably two things that I would share.</p>
<p>One, I touched on.</p>
<p>One is I did not buy into this from 22 to mid-30s,</p>
<p>but this idea that your career isn&rsquo;t linear</p>
<p>and that you should embrace the zigzags</p>
<p>and you should be willing to take a lateral job</p>
<p>in the same company to learn something new and different,</p>
<p>that you should be intentional about getting skill sets</p>
<p>that will really help you be better at the next job,</p>
<p>even if it feels like it&rsquo;s less money</p>
<p>or less prestige or all of that stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do a great job of it from 22</p>
<p>to like I said mid-30s.</p>
<p>But I think if you just at your core recognize</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not linear.</p>
<p>You talk to any successful person, not that I&rsquo;m one,</p>
<p>but if you talk to any successful person</p>
<p>and almost none of them have that 16-year-old</p>
<p>to 40 to 42 promotion every two years career.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not the way they work.</p>
<p>And so the earlier you recognize that,</p>
<p>I think the better off you will be</p>
<p>and the less crazy you&rsquo;ll drive yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one piece of advice.</p>
<p>The second that I can&rsquo;t even tell you</p>
<p>how beneficial mentoring has been to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say it was sideways, up and down.</p>
<p>I would say that I mentor a lot of people</p>
<p>and I do learn as much from the people I mentor as I do</p>
<p>from the people that mentor me.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s very underappreciated is peer mentoring.</p>
<p>And I talk about it any chance I get,</p>
<p>which is having someone that&rsquo;s around the same level,</p>
<p>not in the same group as you that you trust enough</p>
<p>where you share, hey, this is what I&rsquo;m good at</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s where I have areas of improvement</p>
<p>from my performance review and from what you&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>And they are so committed to you and your career</p>
<p>that when they&rsquo;re seeing you in these forums on the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not particularly good at, they pull you aside</p>
<p>after the meeting and say, hey, you weren&rsquo;t great again.</p>
<p>They are not shy about giving you feedback on what needs</p>
<p>to be better and giving you specific insights</p>
<p>to what you could&rsquo;ve done differently in that situation.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been a major benefactor of peer mentors</p>
<p>that cared so deeply about my career that they just wanted</p>
<p>to make sure that recent feedback after performance,</p>
<p>good or bad, that they gave me feedback.</p>
<p>And then obviously more senior mentors</p>
<p>that are a little bit further in their career,</p>
<p>but again, you have to have trust</p>
<p>and vulnerability with them,</p>
<p>I have been a huge, again, benefactor of.</p>
<p>And I think that one thing that I would offer</p>
<p>is be really surgical is the word I&rsquo;d use</p>
<p>on terms of mentors</p>
<p>because I think too often people pick mentors based on title</p>
<p>or you wanna go into investing banking,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re an investment banker.</p>
<p>That is too narrow a way to pick a mentor.</p>
<p>Really evaluate what you&rsquo;re good at,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re not good at, seek out those</p>
<p>that are better at the things you&rsquo;re not good at</p>
<p>and it has to be someone that you can build trust with.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be someone that you can&rsquo;t talk about the things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t working for you.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be this transactional relationship.</p>
<p>It needs to be a super human, very vulnerable relationship.</p>
<p>And I have been extremely lucky that I have four</p>
<p>or five folks in my network that even today if I call</p>
<p>or text them today, today, they will call me back</p>
<p>this afternoon and be willing to talk,</p>
<p>regardless of where they are.</p>
<p>I remember one of my mentors, Carter Cast, who teaches</p>
<p>at Kellogg, and I think I texted him,</p>
<p>hey, Carter, I&rsquo;d love to talk in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>And he was literally on the road, some major highway</p>
<p>with his family and yes, he asked his family for permission</p>
<p>if he could call me, but he wanted to make sure</p>
<p>that he met the need &lsquo;cause he felt my urgency.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just lucky that I have those kinds of folks</p>
<p>in my life that are really willing to work.</p>
<p>I have to work at it and he&rsquo;s gotta be willing.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say having great mentors, being a great mentor</p>
<p>to people, having peer mentors</p>
<p>and then having more senior mentors</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really thoughtful that you can build trust with</p>
<p>is the last piece of advice I&rsquo;d give.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, that&rsquo;s fabulous, fabulous advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have time for some question for Mike.</p>
<p>It looks like we have a microphone set up there</p>
<p>if you wanna step up to the microphone and ask a question.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ellen] Hello. - Hi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, thanks, Mike, this is awesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Jenny] Do you wanna introduce yourself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh sure, yeah, my name&rsquo;s Ellen Quigg, she/hers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My question is about I think the advice about zigzagging</p>
<p>and being comfortable going linearly, not linearly, sideways</p>
<p>in your career is great advice</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m curious if you would talk a little bit</p>
<p>about specific times you made that decision</p>
<p>and what you did and what you feel like you got out</p>
<p>of what you did there?</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a very good question, thank you for asking.</li>
</ul>
<p>So at Stitch Fix, I was Chief Operating Officer</p>
<p>and I was lucky enough based on the success of the company</p>
<p>and wanting to be on boards that I was starting</p>
<p>to get some public and private board offers.</p>
<p>And then I decided to talk to Katrina, my boss,</p>
<p>about a job I really wanted at Stitch Fix,</p>
<p>which was to launch our men&rsquo;s business.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yay! (Jenny applauds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yay, Russell! (Jenny laughs)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the title was gonna be General Manager of Men&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So it was not a C-level title.</p>
<p>It was to help me get better at merchandising</p>
<p>because ultimately I wanted to be a CEO</p>
<p>and I had never done a demand gen job,</p>
<p>meaning I&rsquo;d never worked in merchandising or marketing.</p>
<p>And I said I wanna do it.</p>
<p>Now, the reason I bring up the public</p>
<p>and private boards is I was in a process with a public board</p>
<p>and they said, the recruiter, &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I said, &lsquo;cause I wanna learn this.</p>
<p>They said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re out of the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, why?</p>
<p>They said, &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not a C-level exec anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, well, I still report to Katrina</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m on the senior team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, it&rsquo;s the COO title is why we liked you</p>
<p>&ldquo;for this role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so I knew that I was taking some risk in it.</p>
<p>That one was one that I had not predicted</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d not be able to get on a public company board,</p>
<p>but great, I would do that all day long</p>
<p>because it just broadened my skill set</p>
<p>and it made me I think a better president</p>
<p>when I got the role and was overseeing all of merchandising</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d helped with a team build that up.</p>
<p>And so I think some of that move was lucky, not intentional,</p>
<p>but I never thought about moves like that</p>
<p>as anything other than learning.</p>
<p>And so I had this very simple framework</p>
<p>up until I think I was managing a lot more people</p>
<p>of learning and people.</p>
<p>So am I gonna learn a lot and am I gonna work with a tribe</p>
<p>and the people that I wanna work with</p>
<p>and are those people who are gonna push me?</p>
<p>And then when I became a manager, I added impact.</p>
<p>So it was learning, people and impact.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still how I make decisions very simply.</p>
<p>But title, comp, those things, I tried not to have</p>
<p>as strong a vector in terms of how I made decisions.</p>
<p>So but that one, yeah, it&rsquo;s good learning,</p>
<p>bad for public company boards.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thanks, please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, my name&rsquo;s Carissa, I&rsquo;m an undergrad student.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to thank you first for coming out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Mike] Sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I saw on the news that they&rsquo;re thinking</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>of removing affirmative action at schools like UNC,</p>
<p>but this more so begs the question of I guess equality</p>
<p>in terms of opportunity.</p>
<p>So for your VC, when you&rsquo;re thinking of people</p>
<p>that you wanna support, how do you balance the idea</p>
<p>of them not particularly having the resources</p>
<p>versus not working as hard?</p>
<p>So how do you make that differentiation?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, if I understand the question, I don&rsquo;t differentiate.</li>
</ul>
<p>I look for people that are going to work very hard</p>
<p>and might have come from places</p>
<p>where they didn&rsquo;t have as many resources as I did</p>
<p>or other people did.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>I think you can find amazing people</p>
<p>that come from different backgrounds</p>
<p>that will do amazing work in venture</p>
<p>or in an operating job or what have you.</p>
<p>And so I think one of the things that people,</p>
<p>especially I&rsquo;d just say as a black man,</p>
<p>I have to be excellent every day.</p>
<p>I feel that burden and I&rsquo;m happy to have that burden,</p>
<p>feel it all the time because I just recognize, look,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t make use of venture, if I don&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>in venture, then it messes up the whole&hellip;</p>
<p>Not the whole, it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m the only black person</p>
<p>in venture, but there&rsquo;s not that many of us.</p>
<p>Then people start to question</p>
<p>why should we have a diverse team,</p>
<p>why should we support diverse or more emerging managers?</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s just important to be excellent</p>
<p>and seek people that see that as the guiding principle</p>
<p>of who they are, whether it&rsquo;s in venture</p>
<p>or in an operating company.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can I rephrase the question?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Mike] Sure, yeah, yeah, if I missed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s more so like those that don&rsquo;t have the resources,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>those who are at San Jose State University</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t really surrounded by opportunities like this</p>
<p>to see what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>How do you make sure that they get equipped</p>
<p>to be able to have opportunities like that?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think there are a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think, using venture capital as an example,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s becoming less and less en vogue to only recruit</p>
<p>and only seek founders from fancy traditional schools.</p>
<p>I think there are so many people</p>
<p>that come from all these different places.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s incumbent upon us as investors</p>
<p>to go find the best founders from across a spectrum</p>
<p>of where they go to school.</p>
<p>I think when I first graduated from Haas,</p>
<p>I would meet venture capitalists, as an example,</p>
<p>that would only invest in Northern California.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t invest in&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a great founder in Ohio,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t spend any time there &lsquo;cause what they said</p>
<p>is they didn&rsquo;t wanna get on a plane and go to Ohio.</p>
<p>But I think that is being very much put to pass</p>
<p>because you see amazing companies</p>
<p>being built all over the place.</p>
<p>And you see amazing founders starting companies everywhere.</p>
<p>But I do think it requires the industry,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s, again, a company or the business ecosystem</p>
<p>or a venture to be actively looking</p>
<p>for those opportunities outside of their little pool.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Carissa] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sure. - Thanks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Mike. - Hi.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Aria, I&rsquo;m a senior at Haas.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been in so many different environments</p>
<p>specifically within the corporate world</p>
<p>and then now you&rsquo;re in VC.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for us, we&rsquo;re about to go</p>
<p>into the workforce, about to go into the corporate world</p>
<p>in terms of navigating the corporate environment</p>
<p>and succeeding?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think and I didn&rsquo;t learn this, it took me a little bit</li>
</ul>
<p>to learn this, too, but I think one major piece of advice</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d give you is understanding how</p>
<p>to know the difference between not performing well</p>
<p>at your job, performing well at your job</p>
<p>and performing exceptionally at your job and being clear</p>
<p>in defining that with your boss.</p>
<p>The reason that matters is because I always wanted to,</p>
<p>and it took me awhile to figure this out,</p>
<p>have very objective conversations about how I was doing</p>
<p>or whether I should get promoted</p>
<p>or whether I should make more money.</p>
<p>And the only way to try to get it as objective as possible</p>
<p>is to try to define what exceptional looks like upfront</p>
<p>or try to define where I&rsquo;m not performing upfront,</p>
<p>so that I&rsquo;m not surprised.</p>
<p>I can always tell my boss that,</p>
<p>yeah, I didn&rsquo;t have a good day.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a good day.</p>
<p>And so I would say trying to have that conversation early</p>
<p>in your career and hopefully find leaders that you work for</p>
<p>that are aligned to that definition and trying to get</p>
<p>to objectivity was something I would advise you to do</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause then it becomes really simple.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less emotion I think that goes</p>
<p>with the tougher conversations around promotion</p>
<p>and compensation if you define some of that stuff upfront.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Aria] Thank you very much,</li>
</ul>
<p>appreciate it. - You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, other questions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please, yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Melissa] My name&rsquo;s Melissa.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the full-time program.</p>
<p>I was curious because you talked about&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>[Assistant] Could you go the microphone</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah, we have a huge audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, my name&rsquo;s Melissa, I&rsquo;m in the full-time MBA program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was curious what you&rsquo;re most excited about learning</p>
<p>about next given that you have come into roles not because</p>
<p>of the title or the compensation,</p>
<p>but because of the learning?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, for me, venture capital just as an industry</li>
</ul>
<p>is amazing for that question.</p>
<p>What am I most excited about next?</p>
<p>I am excited about learning</p>
<p>what climate solutions might exist</p>
<p>to help the climate challenge that we&rsquo;re in today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited about learning about healthcare.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never operated in healthcare.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a consumer of healthcare,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never worked in anything in healthcare.</p>
<p>But we have a bias to doing something in healthcare</p>
<p>at Footwork and I&rsquo;m excited to learn about that.</p>
<p>So honestly, it feels like every day scratches that itch</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m most excited about.</p>
<p>And I think the biggest challenge I have is trying</p>
<p>to narrow all the excitement that I have</p>
<p>for all the different opportunities that you can invest in,</p>
<p>rather than broaden it.</p>
<p>I mean, it literally is every day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning about something new.</p>
<p>And so for people that are lifelong learners</p>
<p>or students always, it&rsquo;s a perfect job honestly for that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Melissa] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sure. - Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi, my name&rsquo;s Kira.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing part of my master&rsquo;s degree here at Haas,</p>
<p>over from Europe actually.</p>
<p>And following onto that question,</p>
<p>I wanted to ask how do you learn?</p>
<p>What do you do to learn about new topics,</p>
<p>what are your methods, who do you talk to,</p>
<p>how do you go about it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I&rsquo;m less of a reading learner</li>
</ul>
<p>and more of an experience learner and asking questions</p>
<p>and having people in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>So if I wanna learn about&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the things Nikhil and I have thesis areas,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to learn about aging &lsquo;cause I wanna see</p>
<p>if there are investment opportunities there.</p>
<p>And so my parents are aging and my wife&rsquo;s mom is aging</p>
<p>and I talk to other investors that are in aging just</p>
<p>to understand why they invested in the space broadly</p>
<p>and what are the challenges.</p>
<p>I think for me, I&rsquo;m a much better experiential learner</p>
<p>and listening learner than I am reading white paper learner.</p>
<p>And so I think clearly understanding your best mode</p>
<p>of learning as quickly and efficiently as you can</p>
<p>is important, especially in this job.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how I do is just ask a lot of questions of people</p>
<p>that have been in and around the space for awhile.</p>
<p>And I try to do that and if someone&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to learn about eCommerce or operations</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re an experience learner, sharing perspectives</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had from having done it for awhile.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my best mode of learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So are these your folks who&ndash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, so, yeah, there&rsquo;s some.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Johnny, you have to raise your hand now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah, do you have some stories, John?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[John] Oh, I have lots.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Mike laughs) (Jenny laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, John, especially John had the unfortunate,</li>
</ul>
<p>but we drove to Walmart.com together for a number of years.</p>
<p>So not only did we work in the same division,</p>
<p>we had long commutes down.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That was a long drive, down by SFO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, together in our&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I said our Prius because we basically shared,</p>
<p>co-owned this Prius together</p>
<p>that we got to spend time together.</p>
<p>But I think when we stopped commuting, I thought we signed</p>
<p>in blood that you couldn&rsquo;t tell any stories about me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What was said in the Prius stays in the Prius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s said in the Prius,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>stays in the Prius, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good, well, listen, Mike, every time we get together,</li>
</ul>
<p>I learn so much from you.</p>
<p>You are a really deliberate organized thinker</p>
<p>about everything important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a gift to have you in my ecosystem.</p>
<p>And I think you offered great insights for our students</p>
<p>and colleagues who came to visit today,</p>
<p>here and in the ether.</p>
<p>So I just wanna thank you.</p>
<p>I think Mike&rsquo;s gonna stay around for a little bit</p>
<p>if you have follow-up questions,</p>
<p>but thank you for coming back to Haas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I have to say thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>I live five minutes from here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I love the ecosystem so much and super grateful</p>
<p>for you being my professor and you inviting me to class</p>
<p>and getting to stay a part</p>
<p>of this amazing ecosystem at BerkeleyHaas.</p>
<p>And just like, again, the leadership principles</p>
<p>that I think helped shape me</p>
<p>and hopefully hold me accountable</p>
<p>to continuing to be a good steward out there.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>You make us so proud, I&rsquo;ll just say it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>So thanks to Mike Smith.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>[Mike] Thanks. (audience applauds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you. - Nicely done.</p>
