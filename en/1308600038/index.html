    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk all about</p>
<p>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about normal levels of focus.</p>
<p>What are normal levels of focus?</p>
<p>And how all of us,</p>
<p>whether or not we have ADHD or not,</p>
<p>can improve our ability to focus,</p>
<p>our ability to rule out distraction,</p>
<p>turns out those are two separate things,</p>
<p>as well as remember information better.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about</p>
<p>how we can learn to relax while focusing,</p>
<p>which turns out to be a critical component</p>
<p>of learning new information</p>
<p>and for coming up with new creative ideas.</p>
<p>So whether or not you have ADHD or know someone who does,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re somebody who feels that they do not have ADHD,</p>
<p>but would simply like to improve their ability to focus</p>
<p>or to be more creative,</p>
<p>this episode is definitely for you as well.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about</p>
<p>drug-based tools that are out there.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about behavioral tools.</p>
<p>We will talk about the role of diet and supplementation,</p>
<p>and we will talk about</p>
<p>new emerging brain machine interface devices</p>
<p>things like transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what that is, don&rsquo;t worry,</p>
<p>I will explain it to you.</p>
<p>These are non-invasive methods for rewiring your brain</p>
<p>in order to make focusing more natural for you</p>
<p>and to teach you how to increase your depth of focus.</p>
<p>Now, just a quick reminder</p>
<p>that anytime we discuss a psychiatric disorder,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that we remember</p>
<p>that all of us have the temptation to self-diagnose</p>
<p>or to diagnose others.</p>
<p>So as I list off some of the symptomology of ADHD,</p>
<p>some of that symptomology might resonate with you.</p>
<p>You might think, oh, maybe I have ADHD,</p>
<p>or you might decide that someone you know</p>
<p>definitely has ADHD.</p>
<p>However, it is very important that you don&rsquo;t self-diagnose</p>
<p>or diagnose somebody else.</p>
<p>The clear and real diagnosis of ADHD</p>
<p>really should be carried out by a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>a physician, or a very well-trained clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>There are clear criteria</p>
<p>for what constitutes full-blown ADHD.</p>
<p>However, many of us have constellations of symptoms</p>
<p>that make us somewhat like somebody with ADHD.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re struggling with focus nowadays,</p>
<p>as a lot of people are, because of stress,</p>
<p>because of smartphone use,</p>
<p>which turns out can induce adult ADHD,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about that,</p>
<p>well, then pay attention to the symptomology.</p>
<p>You may actually require professional treatment.</p>
<p>You might not.</p>
<p>Equally important is to remember</p>
<p>that some of the terms that we cover,</p>
<p>like impulse control and attention and concentration</p>
<p>are somewhat subjective, and they can change over time.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have a better level of attention than others.</p>
<p>Maybe it depends on how we slept</p>
<p>or other events going on in our life,</p>
<p>or something that we&rsquo;re entirely unaware of.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember</p>
<p>is that we can all improve our attentional capacity.</p>
<p>We can all rewire the circuits</p>
<p>that make heightened levels of focus more accessible to us.</p>
<p>We can do that through multiple types of interventions,</p>
<p>and we are going to cover all those interventions today.</p>
<p>Before we march into the material,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to remind that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise.</p>
<p>Our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about ADHD,</p>
<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also talk about focus and attention</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s ability to focus and attend,</p>
<p>not just people with ADHD.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about tools</p>
<p>that would allow anyone, whether or not they have ADHD</p>
<p>or not, to enhance their level of concentration and focus.</p>
<p>Now, ADHD used to be called ADD,</p>
<p>Attention Deficit Disorder.</p>
<p>We have record of ADD in the medical literature</p>
<p>dating back to as early as 1904.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s nothing special about 1904.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the first time that it showed up</p>
<p>in the standard medical literature.</p>
<p>We have to believe that ADD, which we now call ADHD,</p>
<p>existed before 1904 and probably long before 1904.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because it has a strong genetic component.</p>
<p>If you have a close relative that has ADHD,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a much higher probability that you will have ADHD.</p>
<p>And that probability goes up</p>
<p>depending on how closely related to that person</p>
<p>you happen to be.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re an identical twin</p>
<p>and your twin has ADHD,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very high concordance, as we say,</p>
<p>a very high probability that you will have ADHD,</p>
<p>up to 75% chance.</p>
<p>If you have a fraternal twin with ADHD,</p>
<p>that number goes down a bit in the 50 to 60% range</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>If you have a parent with ADHD,</p>
<p>that number ranges anywhere from 10 to 25% likelihood</p>
<p>that you will have ADHD.</p>
<p>If you have two parents and so on and so on.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a genetic component.</p>
<p>That genetic component, it turns out,</p>
<p>relates directly to how specific neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain wire up, the chemicals they use</p>
<p>and the way they use those chemicals,</p>
<p>a topic that we are going to discuss in depth today.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a close relative with ADHD,</p>
<p>that does not mean that you are fated to have ADHD.</p>
<p>And if you happen to have ADHD,</p>
<p>there are ways to overcome those symptoms</p>
<p>of lack of attention, impulsivity, and so on.</p>
<p>Another important point about ADHD</p>
<p>is that it has nothing to do with intelligence.</p>
<p>Whether or not we&rsquo;re talking about intelligence</p>
<p>measured by a standard IQ test,</p>
<p>a rather controversial issue, as many of you probably know,</p>
<p>there are lots of forms of intelligence</p>
<p>that a standard IQ test just wouldn&rsquo;t pick up.</p>
<p>Emotional intelligence, musical intelligence,</p>
<p>spatial intelligence, all sorts of intelligences.</p>
<p>None of them are related to ADHD.</p>
<p>Being very high functioning</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you more likely to have ADHD.</p>
<p>And being ADHD doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that you have a low IQ.</p>
<p>So there are people with ADHD who have low IQs,</p>
<p>people with ADHD with high IQs,</p>
<p>people with ADHD with high emotional IQ</p>
<p>or with low IQ in the emotional scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all over the place.</p>
<p>The important point is that your ability to attend and focus</p>
<p>does not relate to how smart you are</p>
<p>or your IQ of any type, not just a standard IQ.</p>
<p>The renaming of ADD to ADHD</p>
<p>took place in the mid to late 1980s</p>
<p>when the psychiatric community</p>
<p>and the psychological community</p>
<p>started taking better notice of the fact</p>
<p>that so-called hyperactive kids also had attentional issues.</p>
<p>This might seem obvious,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s been extensive and ongoing revision</p>
<p>of the criteria for designating a psychiatric disorder.</p>
<p>And this is still an ongoing process even today.</p>
<p>So in the mid 80s, we started hearing about ADHD</p>
<p>and then gradually that term ADD has been dropped away.</p>
<p>However, just the renaming of ADD to ADHD</p>
<p>has led to much better diagnosis and detection of ADHD.</p>
<p>So right now, the current estimates</p>
<p>are that about one in 10 children</p>
<p>and probably more have ADHD.</p>
<p>The current estimates are anywhere from 10%, one in 10,</p>
<p>to as high as 12%.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, about half of those will resolve</p>
<p>with proper treatment,</p>
<p>but the other half typically don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The other thing that we are seeing a lot nowadays</p>
<p>is increased levels of ADHD in adults.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some question</p>
<p>as to whether or not those adults had ADHD</p>
<p>that went undetected during their childhood,</p>
<p>or whether or not ADHD is now cropping up in adulthood</p>
<p>due to the way that we are interacting with the world.</p>
<p>In particular, smartphone use,</p>
<p>the combination of email, text, real world interactions,</p>
<p>multiple apps and streams of media and social media</p>
<p>all coming in at once, trying to manage life,</p>
<p>all of the things that are going on</p>
<p>are creating a kind of cloud of pulls on our attention.</p>
<p>And so there is this question</p>
<p>to whether or not we are creating ADHD in adults</p>
<p>that never had ADHD prior to being an adult.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about attention.</p>
<p>And first, let&rsquo;s just define what we mean by attention.</p>
<p>Out there in the scientific literature</p>
<p>and in discussions about ADHD,</p>
<p>we will hear things like attention and focus</p>
<p>and concentration and impulse control.</p>
<p>For sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>attention, focus and concentration</p>
<p>are essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>Okay, we could split hairs</p>
<p>and the scientific literature does split hairs about these,</p>
<p>but if we want to understand the biology</p>
<p>and we want to have a straightforward conversation</p>
<p>about ADHD, if I say attention or focus,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically referring to the same thing</p>
<p>unless I specify otherwise, okay?</p>
<p>So people with ADHD have trouble holding their attention.</p>
<p>What is attention?</p>
<p>Well, attention is perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we are perceiving the sensory world.</p>
<p>So just a little bit of neurobiology 101,</p>
<p>we are sensing things all the time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s information coming into our nervous system</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>For instance, right now, you&rsquo;re hearing sound waves.</p>
<p>You are seeing things,</p>
<p>you are sensing things against your skin,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re only paying attention to some of those.</p>
<p>And the ones that you&rsquo;re paying attention to</p>
<p>are your perceptions.</p>
<p>So if you hear my voice, you are perceiving my voice.</p>
<p>You are not paying attention</p>
<p>to your other senses at the moment, okay?</p>
<p>You might even be outside in a breeze.</p>
<p>And until I said that,</p>
<p>you might not be perceiving that breeze,</p>
<p>but your body was sensing it all along.</p>
<p>So attention and focus are more or less the same thing,</p>
<p>but impulse control is something separate</p>
<p>because impulse control requires pushing out</p>
<p>or putting the blinders on</p>
<p>to sensory events in our environment.</p>
<p>It means lack of perception.</p>
<p>Impulse control is about limiting our perception.</p>
<p>People with ADHD have poor attention</p>
<p>and they have high levels of impulsivity.</p>
<p>They are easily distractible.</p>
<p>But the way that shows up is very surprising.</p>
<p>You might think that people with ADHD</p>
<p>just simply can&rsquo;t attend to anything.</p>
<p>They really can&rsquo;t focus, even if they really want to,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>People with ADHD, yes, they are distractible.</p>
<p>Yes, they are impulsive.</p>
<p>Yes, they are easily annoyed</p>
<p>by things happening in the room.</p>
<p>They sometimes have a high level of emotionality as well,</p>
<p>not always, but often.</p>
<p>However, people with ADHD can have a hyper-focus,</p>
<p>an incredible ability to focus on things</p>
<p>that they really enjoy or are intrigued by.</p>
<p>Now, this is a very important point</p>
<p>because typically we think of somebody with ADHD</p>
<p>as being really wild and hyperactive</p>
<p>or having no ability whatsoever to sit still and attend.</p>
<p>And while that phenotype, as we call it,</p>
<p>that contour of behavior and cognition can exist,</p>
<p>many people, if not all people with ADHD,</p>
<p>if you give them something they really love,</p>
<p>like if the child loves video games</p>
<p>or if a child loves to draw</p>
<p>or if an adult loves a particular type of movie</p>
<p>or a person very much,</p>
<p>they will obtain laser focus without any effort.</p>
<p>So that tells us that people with ADHD</p>
<p>have the capacity to attend,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t engage that attention</p>
<p>for things that they don&rsquo;t really, really want to do.</p>
<p>And as we all know, much of life,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re a child or an adult</p>
<p>involves doing a lot of things that we don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>Much of our schooling involves doing things</p>
<p>that we would prefer not to do</p>
<p>and sort of forcing ourselves to do it, to attend,</p>
<p>even though we are not super interested</p>
<p>in what we are attending to.</p>
<p>There are a couple other things</p>
<p>that people with ADHD display quite often.</p>
<p>One is challenges with time perception.</p>
<p>Now, time perception is a fascinating aspect</p>
<p>of how our brain works.</p>
<p>And later, we&rsquo;re going to talk about time perception</p>
<p>and how you can actually get better at time perception.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that right now you are doing things</p>
<p>that get in the way of optimal time perception.</p>
<p>And I will tell you how to adjust your ability</p>
<p>to measure time with your brain.</p>
<p>People with ADHD often run late.</p>
<p>They often procrastinate.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting and surprising</p>
<p>is that if they are given a deadline,</p>
<p>they actually can perceive time very well.</p>
<p>And they often can focus very well</p>
<p>if the consequences of not completing a task</p>
<p>or not attending are severe enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like the way that people with ADHD</p>
<p>can really focus if they like something.</p>
<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re scared enough</p>
<p>about the consequences of not attending,</p>
<p>oftentimes, not always, but oftentimes they can attend.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not really concerned</p>
<p>about a deadline or a consequence,</p>
<p>well, then they tend to lose track of time</p>
<p>and they tend to underestimate how long things will take.</p>
<p>Now, many people do that, not just people with ADHD,</p>
<p>but people with ADHD have challenges</p>
<p>understanding how to line up the activities of their day</p>
<p>in order to meet particular deadlines.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s just a simple thing</p>
<p>like finishing one set of tasks before lunch.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, they will remember</p>
<p>that lunch starts at noon,</p>
<p>but somehow they aren&rsquo;t able to fill the intervening time</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s productive.</p>
<p>And they can obsess about the upcoming deadline,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>We will talk about how to remedy this.</p>
<p>In addition, their spatial organization skills</p>
<p>are often subpar, not always,</p>
<p>but often you will find that somebody with ADHD</p>
<p>uses what&rsquo;s called the pile system</p>
<p>in order to organize things.</p>
<p>They will take many belongings,</p>
<p>and this could be in the kitchen or in their bedroom</p>
<p>or in their office or in any space,</p>
<p>and they will start piling things up</p>
<p>according to a categorization system</p>
<p>that makes sense to them and only them.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really have any logical framework.</p>
<p>Now, many people use the pile system,</p>
<p>and if you use the pile system,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have ADHD.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&rsquo;re unpacking a house</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve moved recently</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve received a lot of presents recently,</p>
<p>the pile system makes perfect sense to organize your space.</p>
<p>But people with ADHD tend to organize things</p>
<p>according to the pile system all the time,</p>
<p>and that pile system doesn&rsquo;t work for them.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the key distinction,</p>
<p>that they use a filing system, and it&rsquo;s not really files.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re piling things up in a way that makes sense to them,</p>
<p>but then it doesn&rsquo;t work for them</p>
<p>in terms of what tasks they actually need to perform.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find things, or if anyone moves one thing,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s very disruptive to their overall plan</p>
<p>because their overall plan</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really work in the first place.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a common phenotype, as we call it.</p>
<p>A phenotype, by the way,</p>
<p>is just an expression of a particular set</p>
<p>of underlying genetic or psychological components, okay?</p>
<p>So we say the phenotype.</p>
<p>So a phenotype could be brown hair and green eyes.</p>
<p>Like for me, a phenotype could also be</p>
<p>that somebody uses the piling system, okay?</p>
<p>The other thing that people with ADHD</p>
<p>have real trouble with is so-called working memory.</p>
<p>Now, you might think that people with ADHD</p>
<p>would have really poor memories,</p>
<p>but in fact, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>People with ADHD often can have a terrific memory</p>
<p>for past events.</p>
<p>They can remember upcoming events quite well.</p>
<p>Their memory is clearly working.</p>
<p>However, one aspect of memory in particular</p>
<p>that we call working memory is often disrupted.</p>
<p>Working memory is the ability</p>
<p>to keep specific information online,</p>
<p>to recycle it in your brain over and over again</p>
<p>so that you can use it in the immediate or short term.</p>
<p>A good example of this would be you meet somebody,</p>
<p>they tell you their name,</p>
<p>they give you their phone number verbally,</p>
<p>and you have to walk back to your phone</p>
<p>and enter it into your phone.</p>
<p>People without ADHD might have to put some effort into it.</p>
<p>It might feel like a bit of a struggle,</p>
<p>but typically they would be able to recite</p>
<p>that phone number in their mind over and over</p>
<p>and then put it into their phone.</p>
<p>People with ADHD tend to lose the ability</p>
<p>or lack the ability to remember things</p>
<p>that they just need to keep online</p>
<p>for anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or two, okay?</p>
<p>So a string of numbers like 643781</p>
<p>for most people would be pretty easy,</p>
<p>643781, 643781.</p>
<p>You could probably remember that a minute from now</p>
<p>without writing it down.</p>
<p>But if you add one more number to that 6437813,</p>
<p>it gets tougher, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a reason why phone numbers</p>
<p>typically have seven digits in them.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s an area code,</p>
<p>but remembering information</p>
<p>that strings out longer than seven numbers</p>
<p>or a sentence or two, that&rsquo;s challenging for most people.</p>
<p>People with ADHD have severe challenges</p>
<p>even with much smaller batches of information</p>
<p>over even much smaller batches of time.</p>
<p>Deficits in working memory are also something</p>
<p>that we see in people who have frontotemporal dementia,</p>
<p>so damage to the frontal lobes</p>
<p>or age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>And so it will come as no surprise</p>
<p>that later when we discuss treatments,</p>
<p>supplements, and other tools for ADHD,</p>
<p>that many of those treatments, supplements,</p>
<p>and tools for ADHD are similar to the ones</p>
<p>that work for age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve more or less established</p>
<p>the kind of menu of items that people with ADHD tend to have.</p>
<p>Some have all of them, some have just a subset of them.</p>
<p>Their severity can range from very intense to mild,</p>
<p>but in general, it&rsquo;s challenges with attention and focus,</p>
<p>challenges with impulse control.</p>
<p>They get annoyed easily.</p>
<p>They have kind of an impulsivity.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t stay on task.</p>
<p>Time perception can be off.</p>
<p>They use the piling system or a system</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t work well for them</p>
<p>in order to organize their things in physical space.</p>
<p>And they have a hard time with anything that&rsquo;s mundane</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not really interested in.</p>
<p>But again, I just want to highlight</p>
<p>that people with ADHD are able to obtain</p>
<p>heightened levels of focus, even hyper-focus,</p>
<p>for things that are exciting to them</p>
<p>and that they really want to engage in.</p>
<p>So now you have the contour of what ADHD is.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody who doesn&rsquo;t have ADHD,</p>
<p>you should also be asking yourself</p>
<p>which aspects of ADHD are similar</p>
<p>to things I&rsquo;ve experienced before.</p>
<p>Because what we know about the healthy brain</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s also a range of abilities to focus.</p>
<p>Some people focus very well on any task.</p>
<p>You give them a task, they can just laser in on that task.</p>
<p>Other people, they have to kind of fight an internal battle.</p>
<p>They have to convince themselves</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s important or interesting.</p>
<p>They have to kind of incentivize themselves internally.</p>
<p>Other people, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>They could be bored to tears with the information,</p>
<p>but they can do it just because they are quote unquote,</p>
<p>very disciplined people.</p>
<p>We tend to admire those people,</p>
<p>but as you&rsquo;ll see a little bit later,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear that that&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>to run your attentional system.</p>
<p>There might be something to this business</p>
<p>of having heightened levels of attention</p>
<p>for the things that you are most interested or excited by.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s drill into this issue of why people with ADHD</p>
<p>actually can focus very intensely</p>
<p>on things that they enjoy and are curious about.</p>
<p>Now, enjoyment and curiosity are psychological terms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not even really psychological terms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just the way that we describe</p>
<p>our human experience of liking things,</p>
<p>wanting to know more about them.</p>
<p>But from a neurobiological perspective,</p>
<p>they have a very clear identity and signature,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is released from neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we call a neuromodulator.</p>
<p>And as a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>it changes the activity of the circuits in the brain</p>
<p>such that certain circuits are more active than others.</p>
<p>And in particular,</p>
<p>dopamine creates a heightened state of focus.</p>
<p>It tends to contract our visual world,</p>
<p>and it tends to make us pay attention</p>
<p>to things that are outside</p>
<p>and beyond the confines of our skin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we call exteroception.</p>
<p>Dopamine also tends to put us in a state of motivation</p>
<p>and wanting things outside the confines of our skin.</p>
<p>So whether or not we&rsquo;re pursuing</p>
<p>something physical in our world,</p>
<p>or whether or not we&rsquo;re pursuing information</p>
<p>in our outside world,</p>
<p>dopamine is largely responsible for our ability</p>
<p>and our drive to do that.</p>
<p>But dopamine as a neuromodulator</p>
<p>is also involved in changing the way</p>
<p>that we perceive the world.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>you have all these senses coming in,</p>
<p>and you can only perceive some of them</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re only paying attention to some of them.</p>
<p>Dopamine, when it&rsquo;s released in our brain,</p>
<p>tends to turn on areas of our brain</p>
<p>that narrow our visual focus and our auditory focus.</p>
<p>So it creates a cone of auditory attention</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very narrow,</p>
<p>creates a tunnel of visual attention that&rsquo;s very narrow.</p>
<p>Whereas when we have less dopamine,</p>
<p>we tend to view the entire world.</p>
<p>We tend to see the whole scene that we are in.</p>
<p>We tend to hear everything all at once.</p>
<p>So as I describe this,</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;re already starting to see and understand</p>
<p>how having dopamine release can allow a person,</p>
<p>whether or not they have ADHD or not,</p>
<p>to direct their attention to particular things</p>
<p>in their environment, right?</p>
<p>So now what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re moving away from attention</p>
<p>as this kind of vague, ambiguous term,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re giving it a neurochemical identity, dopamine,</p>
<p>and we are giving it a neural circuit identity.</p>
<p>And just to put a little bit of flavor and detail</p>
<p>on which neural circuits those are,</p>
<p>I want to discuss two general types of neural circuits</p>
<p>that dopamine tends to enhance.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk neural circuits.</p>
<p>And for those of you that love</p>
<p>hearing neuroscience nomenclature,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to eat this part up.</p>
<p>And for those of you that don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>a lot of names of brain areas,</p>
<p>I invite you to tune out</p>
<p>or just try and grab the top contour of this.</p>
<p>I will describe it in pretty general terms,</p>
<p>but I will give some detail</p>
<p>because I know there are some of you out there</p>
<p>who really want to dig deeper into</p>
<p>what the exact structures and connectivities are.</p>
<p>So there are two main types of circuits</p>
<p>that we need to think about with respect to ADHD,</p>
<p>attention, and dopamine.</p>
<p>The first one is called the default mode network.</p>
<p>The default mode network is the network of brain areas</p>
<p>in your brain, in my brain, and in everybody&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>that is active when we&rsquo;re not doing anything,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re just sitting there idle at rest.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s very hard to not think about anything,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re not engaged in any type of specific task,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not driving, you&rsquo;re not playing a video game,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not trying to study, you&rsquo;re not trying to listen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just sitting there,</p>
<p>letting your brain kind of go wherever it wants to go,</p>
<p>your default mode network underlies that state of mind.</p>
<p>The other set of circuits that we&rsquo;re going to think about</p>
<p>and talk about with respect to ADHD are the task networks,</p>
<p>the networks of the brain that make you goal-oriented</p>
<p>or that are at least trying to make you goal-oriented.</p>
<p>And those are a completely different set of brain areas.</p>
<p>However, the default mode network and these task networks</p>
<p>are communicating with one another,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing that in very interesting ways.</p>
<p>So first I want to describe how these two sets</p>
<p>of brain areas, the default mode network</p>
<p>and the task networks normally interact, okay?</p>
<p>So little bit of naming here.</p>
<p>Again, feel free to ignore it</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want this level of detail,</p>
<p>but the default mode network includes an area</p>
<p>called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Frontal cortex, no surprises in the front,</p>
<p>and you have a dorsal, the top and side lateral part,</p>
<p>dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>You got one on each side of your brain, right?</p>
<p>And then you have a brain area</p>
<p>called the posterior cingulate cortex.</p>
<p>And then you have an area called the lateral parietal lobe.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t need to remember these names,</p>
<p>but these are three brain areas</p>
<p>that normally are synchronized in their activity.</p>
<p>So when one of these areas is active in a typical person,</p>
<p>the other areas would be active as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit like a symphony</p>
<p>or a band, like a three-piece band.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like drums, guitar, and bass.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re playing together, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it is in a typical person,</p>
<p>in a person with ADHD,</p>
<p>or even a person who has subclinical ADHD,</p>
<p>or in any human being who hasn&rsquo;t slept well,</p>
<p>what you find is the default mode network</p>
<p>is not synchronized.</p>
<p>These brain areas are just not playing well together.</p>
<p>Now, the task networks include a different set of structures.</p>
<p>It still involves the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different part of the prefrontal cortex, okay?</p>
<p>Tends to be the medial prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And there are some other brain areas</p>
<p>that the medial prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is communicating to all the time,</p>
<p>mainly to suppress impulses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shutting down the desire to stand up</p>
<p>or to scratch the side of your cheek or your nose,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying not to do that.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re restricting your behavior,</p>
<p>these task-directed networks are very active, okay?</p>
<p>Now, normally, in a person without ADHD,</p>
<p>the task networks and the default mode networks</p>
<p>are going in kind of see-saw fashion.</p>
<p>They are actually what we call anti-correlated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that they are not correlated,</p>
<p>they are actually opposing one another.</p>
<p>They are anti-correlated.</p>
<p>In a person with ADHD,</p>
<p>the default mode networks and the task networks</p>
<p>are actually more coordinated.</p>
<p>That might come as surprising.</p>
<p>I think that we all have this tendency</p>
<p>to kind of jump to conclusion</p>
<p>and assume that somebody who doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>an easy time paying attention or has ADHD,</p>
<p>that their brain must be completely incoherent,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not working well</p>
<p>because everything&rsquo;s out of whack.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something interesting about people with ADHD</p>
<p>whereby the task networks and the default mode networks</p>
<p>are actually working together in a way that&rsquo;s correlated</p>
<p>and that is what&rsquo;s abnormal.</p>
<p>So this would be like the guitar, bass, and the drums</p>
<p>playing together in a way</p>
<p>where the bass isn&rsquo;t keeping the backbeat</p>
<p>and the drums aren&rsquo;t keeping the backbeat,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re playing together,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all playing the melodies and harmonies</p>
<p>in a way that just doesn&rsquo;t sound right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on in the brain of somebody with ADHD.</p>
<p>And we can now confidently say,</p>
<p>based on brain imaging studies,</p>
<p>that when somebody gets better when they&rsquo;re treated for ADHD</p>
<p>or when they age out of ADHD, as sometimes is the case,</p>
<p>that the default mode networks and the task networks</p>
<p>tend to become anti-correlated again, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the underlying neurobiology.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll notice that I didn&rsquo;t mention dopamine at all.</p>
<p>What dopamine is doing in this context</p>
<p>is dopamine is acting like a conductor.</p>
<p>Dopamine is saying this circuit should be active,</p>
<p>then that circuit should be active.</p>
<p>It should be default mode network</p>
<p>and then when the default mode network is not active,</p>
<p>then it should be the task network.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really acting as a conductor saying,</p>
<p>you go, now you go, now you go, now you go.</p>
<p>And in ADHD, there&rsquo;s something about the dopamine system</p>
<p>that is not allowing it to conduct these networks</p>
<p>and make sure that they stay what, you know,</p>
<p>the engineers or physicists or mathematicians</p>
<p>would say out of phase to be anti-correlated, okay?</p>
<p>Out of phase and anti-correlate,</p>
<p>essentially the same thing,</p>
<p>at least for purposes of this discussion.</p>
<p>So that raises two questions.</p>
<p>Could it be that dopamine is not</p>
<p>at sufficiently high levels</p>
<p>or could it be the dopamine is just doing it all wrong?</p>
<p>In other words, is there no conductor</p>
<p>or is the conductor playing with like little tiny toothpicks</p>
<p>and so the instruments can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re supposed to do.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t get the instruction</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just not loud enough, so to speak.</p>
<p>Or could it be that the information is getting out</p>
<p>but the information that&rsquo;s getting out is wrong.</p>
<p>The conductor is there</p>
<p>but the conductor isn&rsquo;t very good at conducting.</p>
<p>Now we can gain insight into how this system works</p>
<p>and fails and how to treat it by looking at some</p>
<p>of the current and previous treatments for ADHD,</p>
<p>as well as some of the recreational drugs</p>
<p>that people with ADHD tend to pursue and like.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m certainly not a proponent of people</p>
<p>with ADHD taking drugs recreationally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what this is about.</p>
<p>But if you look at their drug seeking behavior</p>
<p>and you couple that drug seeking behavior</p>
<p>to their desire to remedy their attention deficit,</p>
<p>you start gaining some really interesting insight</p>
<p>into how dopamine is regulating these circuits</p>
<p>in normal circumstances and in people with ADHD.</p>
<p>So what exactly is going on with the dopamine system</p>
<p>in people with ADHD?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s going on with the dopamine system</p>
<p>in people that have terrific levels</p>
<p>of attention for any task?</p>
<p>Well, in the year 2015, an important paper came out.</p>
<p>The first author is Spencer and it came out</p>
<p>in a journal called Biological Psychiatry.</p>
<p>And it formalized the so-called low dopamine hypothesis</p>
<p>of ADHD.</p>
<p>The idea that dopamine was somehow involved</p>
<p>or not at the appropriate levels in people with ADHD</p>
<p>had been around for a pretty long time.</p>
<p>But a formal proposition of the low dopamine hypothesis</p>
<p>led to some really important experiments</p>
<p>and understanding of what goes wrong in ADHD.</p>
<p>It turns out that if dopamine levels are too low</p>
<p>in particular circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>that it leads to unnecessary firing of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that are unrelated to the task that one is trying to do</p>
<p>and that is unrelated to the information</p>
<p>that one is trying to focus on.</p>
<p>So if you think back before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this default mode network</p>
<p>and a task related network,</p>
<p>and they need to be in this kind of concert</p>
<p>of anti-correlation and in ADHD,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re firing together.</p>
<p>Well, the problem seems to be that when dopamine is low,</p>
<p>certain neurons are firing when they shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>This is like a band, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go back to our band,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a guitar, a bass and a person playing the drums.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s as if one of those or several of those instruments</p>
<p>are playing notes when they shouldn&rsquo;t be playing, right?</p>
<p>The pauses in music are just as important</p>
<p>as the actual playing of notes.</p>
<p>When dopamine is too low,</p>
<p>neurons fire more than they should</p>
<p>in these networks that govern attention.</p>
<p>This is the so-called low dopamine hypothesis.</p>
<p>And if you start looking anecdotally</p>
<p>at what people with ADHD have done for decades,</p>
<p>not just recently since the low dopamine hypothesis</p>
<p>has been proposed,</p>
<p>but what they were doing in the 1950s</p>
<p>and then the 1940s and the 1960s,</p>
<p>what you find is that they tend to use recreational drugs</p>
<p>or they tend to indulge in non-drug stimulants.</p>
<p>So things like drinking six cups of coffee</p>
<p>or quadruple espressos,</p>
<p>or when it was more prominent,</p>
<p>smoking a half a pack of cigarettes</p>
<p>and drinking four cups of coffee a day.</p>
<p>Or if the person had access to it,</p>
<p>using cocaine as a recreational drug</p>
<p>or amphetamine as a recreational drug.</p>
<p>All of those substances that I just described,</p>
<p>in particular, cocaine and amphetamine,</p>
<p>but also coffee and cigarettes,</p>
<p>increased levels of multiple neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>but all have the quality of increasing levels of dopamine</p>
<p>in the brain and in particular,</p>
<p>in the regions of the brain that regulate attention</p>
<p>and these task-related and default mode networks, okay?</p>
<p>Now, young children, fortunately,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have access to those kinds of stimulants.</p>
<p>Most of the time.</p>
<p>And those stimulants all have high potential</p>
<p>for abuse in adults.</p>
<p>So we will talk about the potential for abuse</p>
<p>in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But if you look at children,</p>
<p>even very young children with ADHD,</p>
<p>they show things like preference for sugary foods,</p>
<p>which also act as dopamine inducing stimulants.</p>
<p>Now, of course, once they get access to soda pop</p>
<p>and coffee and tea,</p>
<p>they start to indulge in those more than other people.</p>
<p>For a long time, it was thought that children with ADHD</p>
<p>consumed too many sugary foods or drank too much soda,</p>
<p>or adults with ADHD would take recreational drugs</p>
<p>like methamphetamine or cocaine,</p>
<p>or would drink coffee to excess</p>
<p>or smoke cigarettes to excess</p>
<p>because they had poor levels of attention</p>
<p>and because they couldn&rsquo;t make good decisions.</p>
<p>They were too impulsive and so forth.</p>
<p>And while that certainly could be the case,</p>
<p>knowing what we now know about dopamine</p>
<p>and the fact that having enough dopamine is required</p>
<p>in order to coordinate these neural circuits</p>
<p>that allow for focus and quality decision-making,</p>
<p>an equally valid idea is that these children</p>
<p>and these adults are actually trying to self-medicate</p>
<p>by pursuing these compounds, right?</p>
<p>Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>Well, what happens when somebody with ADHD takes that drug?</p>
<p>It turns out they actually obtain</p>
<p>heightened levels of focus.</p>
<p>Their ability to focus on things</p>
<p>other than things they absolutely care intensely about</p>
<p>goes up.</p>
<p>Likewise, children who consume anything</p>
<p>that increases their levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer.</p>
<p>They tend to be able to focus more.</p>
<p>Now, this is very different</p>
<p>than children who do not have ADHD.</p>
<p>When they consume too much sugar,</p>
<p>they tend to become super hyperactive.</p>
<p>When they consume any kind of stimulant,</p>
<p>they tend to go wild and run around like crazy.</p>
<p>I actually have an anecdote about this,</p>
<p>just to illustrate it.</p>
<p>I have a friend, he has two children</p>
<p>that are now in their teens and 20s,</p>
<p>but when they were little,</p>
<p>one time I brought them some chocolate just as a gift</p>
<p>when I showed up at their house,</p>
<p>and within 30 minutes,</p>
<p>the kids were running around like crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, they were pretty high energy kids,</p>
<p>but they were going bonkers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually when the mother,</p>
<p>my friend at the time, unfortunately still now,</p>
<p>looked at the chocolate and realized</p>
<p>that it was chocolate with espresso beans in it.</p>
<p>It was like dark chocolate, espresso beans.</p>
<p>So I was really at fault there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to give kids dark chocolate</p>
<p>with espresso beans,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re really seeing, that hyperactivity,</p>
<p>that is dopamine, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sugar combined with the caffeine in this case,</p>
<p>combined with a few other compounds that exist in chocolate</p>
<p>that really increase our levels of alertness</p>
<p>and our tendency to want to move around a lot.</p>
<p>Okay, so dopamine and low levels of dopamine</p>
<p>apparently are what&rsquo;s wrong in people with ADHD.</p>
<p>That dopamine hypothesis is what led to the idea</p>
<p>that treating people, children and adults included,</p>
<p>with dopaminergic compounds</p>
<p>would somehow increase their ability to focus.</p>
<p>And if you look at the major drugs that were developed</p>
<p>and now marketed by pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>for the treatment of ADHD,</p>
<p>those drugs have names like Ritalin.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s typically things like Adderall,</p>
<p>modafinil and some of the other derivatives.</p>
<p>They all serve to increase levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>in particular dopamine in the networks</p>
<p>that control task-directed behavior</p>
<p>and that coordinate the default mode network</p>
<p>and these task-related networks.</p>
<p>So many of you have probably heard of Ritalin.</p>
<p>Ritalin is a prescription stimulant</p>
<p>that is prescribed for ADHD as well as for narcolepsy.</p>
<p>Narcolepsy is a condition</p>
<p>in which people tend to fall asleep during the daytime</p>
<p>quite a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s excessive daytime sleepiness,</p>
<p>not due to lack of sleep at night,</p>
<p>but also tend to fall asleep when they get excited.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re really emotionally excited or about to eat</p>
<p>or any other kind of activity</p>
<p>that would normally get somebody really aroused and alert,</p>
<p>people with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep</p>
<p>or they tend to become what&rsquo;s called cataplectic.</p>
<p>They tend to just sort of go limp in the muscles.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this invasion of sleep into the daytime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dysregulated by emotion.</p>
<p>You can imagine why a stimulant,</p>
<p>something that would wake you up,</p>
<p>make you very alert, focused, and motivated</p>
<p>would be a good treatment for narcolepsy.</p>
<p>Adderall also is used to treat ADHD</p>
<p>and to treat narcolepsy.</p>
<p>Things like modafinil also used to treat ADHD</p>
<p>and narcolepsy.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re sensing a theme here.</p>
<p>So what are the differences and similarities</p>
<p>between these drugs?</p>
<p>And what can that tell us about ADHD?</p>
<p>Well, Ritalin was one of the first generation drugs</p>
<p>that was prescribed for ADHD</p>
<p>in order to deal head-on with this dopamine hypothesis,</p>
<p>this idea that in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Adderall is the more typically prescribed drug</p>
<p>for ADHD.</p>
<p>That has to do with some of the so-called pharmacokinetics,</p>
<p>the rate at which those drugs enter the system</p>
<p>and how long they last in the system.</p>
<p>So for instance, Ritalin was a drug</p>
<p>that was packaged into various time-release formulas,</p>
<p>whereas initially Adderall was only released</p>
<p>in a form that had a very short life.</p>
<p>So meaning that it wasn&rsquo;t in the bloodstream very long</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t affect the brain for very long.</p>
<p>And so the dosages could be controlled</p>
<p>in a more typical way</p>
<p>without going into a lot of tangential detail.</p>
<p>As you all know, at different times of day,</p>
<p>you tend to be more or less alert.</p>
<p>So a long sustained release drug</p>
<p>while that might sound like a really terrific thing,</p>
<p>if that drug is having an effect of making you more alert</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s released across very many hours of your day,</p>
<p>there might be periods of your day when you feel too alert,</p>
<p>periods of your day when you feel just right,</p>
<p>and periods of your day</p>
<p>when you wished that you were more alert.</p>
<p>These are some of the pharmacokinetics,</p>
<p>kinetics meaning movement,</p>
<p>of the different compounds within the bloodstream and brain</p>
<p>that you could imagine in a very real way</p>
<p>would impact whether or not someone would feel really good</p>
<p>on one of these drugs</p>
<p>or whether or not they would feel too anxious</p>
<p>or too sleepy and so on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step back for a second</p>
<p>and just ask what are these drugs?</p>
<p>We know they increase dopamine, but what are they really?</p>
<p>Well, Ritalin, also called methylphenidate,</p>
<p>is very similar to amphetamine, speed,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s typically called speed</p>
<p>in the street drug nomenclature.</p>
<p>Adderall, which goes by various other names, okay?</p>
<p>So Adderall, Adderall-XR, Midas,</p>
<p>Midiasis, things like that.</p>
<p>Adderall is basically a combination of amphetamine</p>
<p>and dextroamphetamine.</p>
<p>Now, some of you probably realize this,</p>
<p>that Adderall is amphetamine,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing that there are a good number of you</p>
<p>out there, perhaps even parents and kids,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t realize that these drugs</p>
<p>like cocaine and amphetamine, methamphetamine,</p>
<p>which are incredibly dangerous</p>
<p>and incredibly habit-forming</p>
<p>and have high potential for abuse.</p>
<p>Well, the pharmaceutical versions of those</p>
<p>are exactly what are used to treat ADHD.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re not exactly like cocaine or methamphetamine,</p>
<p>but they are structurally and chemically very similar,</p>
<p>and their net effect in the brain and body</p>
<p>is essentially the same,</p>
<p>which is to increase dopamine primarily,</p>
<p>but also to increase levels of a neuromodulator</p>
<p>called epinephrine or norepinephrine,</p>
<p>also called noradrenaline.</p>
<p>Those names are the same.</p>
<p>And to some extent, to increase levels of serotonin</p>
<p>in the brain and blood, but not so much serotonin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just kind of a small smidgen of effect, okay?</p>
<p>So dopamine way up, norepinephrine and adrenaline way up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s motivation, drive, focus, and energy.</p>
<p>And to some extent, a little bit of serotonin,</p>
<p>which is really more about feeling calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>And you could imagine why that would be</p>
<p>a good balancing effect for dopamine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m essentially saying is that the drugs</p>
<p>that are used to treat ADHD are stimulants,</p>
<p>and they look very much like, in fact,</p>
<p>nearly identical to some of the so-called</p>
<p>street drug stimulants that we all hear are so terrible.</p>
<p>However, I do want to emphasize</p>
<p>that at the appropriate dosages</p>
<p>and working with a quality psychiatrist</p>
<p>or neurologist or family physician</p>
<p>that does have to be a board certified MD</p>
<p>that prescribes these things,</p>
<p>many people with ADHD achieve excellent relief</p>
<p>with these drugs.</p>
<p>Not all of them, but many of them do,</p>
<p>especially if these treatments are started early in life.</p>
<p>So now knowing what these drugs are,</p>
<p>I want to raise the question of why prescribe these drugs.</p>
<p>I mean, everyone has to make a decision for themselves</p>
<p>or for their child as to whether or not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to take these things or not.</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge that many people out there,</p>
<p>many, many people out there are taking these drugs,</p>
<p>even though they have not been clinically diagnosed</p>
<p>with ADHD.</p>
<p>When I say these drugs,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m specifically referring to ritalin and Adderall</p>
<p>and modafinil, but more typically it&rsquo;s Adderall, okay?</p>
<p>People using cocaine and amphetamine</p>
<p>for recreational purposes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a completely different beast,</p>
<p>and it is indeed a beast,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that I strongly discourage.</p>
<p>However, I am aware that up to 25% of college students</p>
<p>and perhaps as many as 35% of all individuals</p>
<p>between the ages of 17 and 30 are taking Adderall</p>
<p>on a regular or semi-regular basis in order to work,</p>
<p>in order to study, and in order to function</p>
<p>and focus in their daily life,</p>
<p>even though they have not been diagnosed with ADHD.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole black market for this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting it from people with prescriptions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to pass judgment.</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize how these drugs work,</p>
<p>some of the things that they do to enhance cognition</p>
<p>and focus that actually serve the brain well</p>
<p>in certain individuals,</p>
<p>and how they can be very detrimental in other individuals.</p>
<p>I sort of blew right past it,</p>
<p>but the fact that in upwards of 25% of young people</p>
<p>are taking things like Adderall,</p>
<p>despite not having a clinical diagnosis of ADHD,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a ridiculously high number.</p>
<p>A few years ago, it was estimated that Adderall use</p>
<p>and Ritalin use without diagnosis of ADHD</p>
<p>was second in incident only to cannabis.</p>
<p>But actually now the consumption of Adderall</p>
<p>without prescription is higher than the consumption</p>
<p>of cannabis in that age group.</p>
<p>So what that means is that there&rsquo;s a lot of stimulant use</p>
<p>in that age group.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of adults also using</p>
<p>and abusing stimulants in order to gain focus.</p>
<p>Now we could have a whole discussion</p>
<p>about whether or not life is becoming more demanding,</p>
<p>whether or not the need for focus is excessive,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why people are doing that.</p>
<p>Frankly, it&rsquo;s an interesting discussion,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not one that would deliver us to any answers.</p>
<p>Rather, I&rsquo;d like to focus on the ways that people now</p>
<p>and people have always been self-medicating</p>
<p>to increase focus, right?</p>
<p>Caffeine, which I indulge some,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think to access,</p>
<p>has long been used as a stimulant to increase dopamine,</p>
<p>increase norepinephrine, increase focus and energy.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>it works through the so-called cyclic AMP,</p>
<p>phosphodiesterase pathway.</p>
<p>Remember anytime you hear an ASE, that&rsquo;s an enzyme.</p>
<p>Phosphodiesterase is involved in the conversion</p>
<p>of things like cyclic AMP into energy for cells</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>Basically coffee gives you energy, it makes you feel good.</p>
<p>And it increases focus because of the circuits</p>
<p>that it engages in the brain.</p>
<p>People have been taking caffeine</p>
<p>and continue to take caffeine for ages.</p>
<p>People also used to smoke cigarettes, nicotine,</p>
<p>in order to gain focus.</p>
<p>Nowadays, that&rsquo;s less common because of the concerns,</p>
<p>quite valid concerns about lung cancer from smoking,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of vaping out there.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people now consuming nicotine,</p>
<p>which is the active substance in cigarettes</p>
<p>and in most nicotine vapes that stimulates the brain</p>
<p>to be more focused and more alert.</p>
<p>So the idea of taking stimulants, of consuming things</p>
<p>or smoking things in order to increase alertness</p>
<p>is not a new idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that in ADHD,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s surprising that these things would work, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if the problem is attention deficit</p>
<p>hyperactivity disorder,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really talking about here are children</p>
<p>that are prescribed a drug</p>
<p>that ought to be a stimulant.</p>
<p>It ought to make them hyper, hyperactive.</p>
<p>And rather than doing that,</p>
<p>it actually somehow serves to calm them a bit</p>
<p>or at least allow them to focus.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the reason.</p>
<p>Children have a brain that&rsquo;s very plastic,</p>
<p>meaning it can remodel itself and change in response</p>
<p>to experience very, very quickly compared to adults.</p>
<p>Taking stimulants as a child,</p>
<p>if you are a child diagnosed with ADHD,</p>
<p>allows that forebrain task-related network to come online,</p>
<p>to be active at the appropriate times.</p>
<p>And because those children are young,</p>
<p>it allows those children to learn what focus is</p>
<p>and to sort of follow or enter that tunnel of focus.</p>
<p>Now, by taking a drug, it&rsquo;s creating focus artificially.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not creating focus</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re super interested in something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s chemically inducing a state of focus.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s face it, a lot of childhood and school</p>
<p>and becoming a functional adult</p>
<p>is about learning how to focus</p>
<p>even though you don&rsquo;t want to do something.</p>
<p>In fact, when I was in college,</p>
<p>I had this little trick that may or may not work</p>
<p>for some of you, which is,</p>
<p>if I couldn&rsquo;t focus on the material I was trying to learn,</p>
<p>I would delude myself into thinking</p>
<p>that it was the most interesting thing in the world.</p>
<p>I would just kind of lie to myself and tell myself,</p>
<p>okay, this, I won&rsquo;t mention the subjects.</p>
<p>I absolutely love this.</p>
<p>I would just, I would tell myself that I loved it.</p>
<p>And I noticed that just that selective</p>
<p>or deliberate engagement of that desire to know circuit,</p>
<p>whatever that is in my brain, no doubt involves dopamine,</p>
<p>allowed me to focus and remember the information.</p>
<p>And somewhat surprisingly, or perhaps not surprisingly,</p>
<p>I would often fall in love with the information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d find that that was my favorite class.</p>
<p>It was what I wanted to learn the most.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way you can do it artificially,</p>
<p>but kids with ADHD, they can&rsquo;t do that, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re told to sit still</p>
<p>and they end up getting up 11 times.</p>
<p>They are told that they can&rsquo;t speak out in class</p>
<p>or that they have to remain in their seats for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And they just, despite their best effort,</p>
<p>they simply cannot do it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re highly distractible.</p>
<p>So what are we to make of this whole picture</p>
<p>that we need more dopamine, but these kids with ADHD,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting their dopamine by way of a drug,</p>
<p>which is for all the world, amphetamines, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s speed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what it is.</p>
<p>What are the long-term consequences?</p>
<p>What are the short-term consequences?</p>
<p>And what should we make of people taking these drugs</p>
<p>without a clinical need?</p>
<p>What are the consequences there?</p>
<p>Well, in order to get to some of those answers,</p>
<p>I went to one of my colleagues.</p>
<p>This is a colleague that I&rsquo;ve actually known</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>I was their teaching assistant</p>
<p>when they were an undergraduate.</p>
<p>They went on to get an MD, a medical degree,</p>
<p>as well as a PhD and have become a pediatric neurologist</p>
<p>that specializes in the treatment of epilepsy and ADHD</p>
<p>in kids of all ages, from age three to 21.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the age range, pretty broad age range,</p>
<p>and has extensive knowledge in this.</p>
<p>And what makes them particularly interesting</p>
<p>for sake of this discussion is that they have a child,</p>
<p>a young boy, who&rsquo;s now showing signs of ADHD,</p>
<p>and they are on the threshold of trying to decide</p>
<p>whether or not they will prescribe Adderall</p>
<p>or something similar.</p>
<p>So we had a discussion about this,</p>
<p>and prior to learning that their child may have ADHD,</p>
<p>I asked the following questions.</p>
<p>First of all, I asked,</p>
<p>what do you think about giving young kids amphetamine?</p>
<p>And their answer was, you know, on the face of it,</p>
<p>it seems crazy,</p>
<p>but provided that the lowest possible dose is used</p>
<p>and that that dosage is modulated as they grow older</p>
<p>and develop those powers of attention,</p>
<p>their observation was that they&rsquo;ve seen more kids benefit</p>
<p>than not benefit from that.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m certainly not saying what people should do.</p>
<p>You obviously have to go to a doctor</p>
<p>because as I always say, I&rsquo;m not a doctor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor, so I profess things.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m professing that you talk to your doctor</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re considering giving Ritalin or Adderall</p>
<p>or any type of stimulant to your child, of course.</p>
<p>What could be more important than the health of your child?</p>
<p>But it was a very interesting answer</p>
<p>because typically we hear yes, medicate or don&rsquo;t medicate.</p>
<p>Rarely do we hear that the medication should be adjusted</p>
<p>across the lifespan and in any particular kind of way.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that this person,</p>
<p>this now friend of mine and colleague of mine</p>
<p>has so much expertise in the way that the brain works</p>
<p>and is considering putting their child on such medication,</p>
<p>I said, you know,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you wait until your kid reaches puberty?</p>
<p>I mean, we know that in boys and in girls,</p>
<p>there are increases in testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>during puberty that dramatically change</p>
<p>the way that the body appears,</p>
<p>but also that dramatically change the way</p>
<p>that the brain functions.</p>
<p>In particular, we know this,</p>
<p>that puberty triggers the activation</p>
<p>of so-called frontotemporal task-related</p>
<p>executive functioning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just fancy science speak for being able to focus,</p>
<p>being able to direct your attention,</p>
<p>being able to control your impulses.</p>
<p>Look at a small child or look at a puppy</p>
<p>and then look at an older child</p>
<p>or look at a dog.</p>
<p>Very different levels, patterns of spontaneous behavior.</p>
<p>Young children move around a lot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t want to say shifty</p>
<p>because that makes it sound like they&rsquo;re up</p>
<p>to something bad, which they might be,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have to be up to something bad.</p>
<p>They fidget a lot.</p>
<p>So do puppies.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s a stimulus.</p>
<p>As animals and humans get older,</p>
<p>they learn how to control their behavior and sit still,</p>
<p>listen and focus, even if they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>So giving a drug that allows a child</p>
<p>to access that stillness early on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thought will allow them to maintain that ability</p>
<p>as time goes on.</p>
<p>But I decided to push a little bit further.</p>
<p>I said, well, why would you do it now</p>
<p>as opposed to during puberty or after puberty?</p>
<p>And their answer was very specific</p>
<p>and I think very important.</p>
<p>What they said was, look,</p>
<p>neuroplasticity is greatest in childhood</p>
<p>and tapers off after about age 25,</p>
<p>but neuroplasticity from age three</p>
<p>until age 12 or 13 is exceedingly high.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>When you sit back and you look at the literature</p>
<p>on neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say childhood plasticity and young adult plasticity</p>
<p>is much greater than adult plasticity,</p>
<p>but that early childhood plasticity</p>
<p>is far and away the period in which</p>
<p>you can reshape the brain at an accelerated rate.</p>
<p>So this lines up really well with the clinical literature,</p>
<p>not surprisingly, they&rsquo;re a clinician,</p>
<p>that early treatment is key.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity to work with a quality physician</p>
<p>and treat these things early,</p>
<p>these drugs can allow these frontal circuits,</p>
<p>these task-related circuits</p>
<p>to achieve their appropriate levels of functioning</p>
<p>and for kids to learn how to focus</p>
<p>in a variety of different contexts.</p>
<p>Now, is that the only thing that they should be doing?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>So the next question I asked was,</p>
<p>what should we make of all this diet-related stuff, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard before that the so-called elimination diet</p>
<p>or ingesting no sugars or no dairy or no gluten,</p>
<p>that all of these things have been purported</p>
<p>to improve symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>And people and parents with ADHD go to fanatic lengths</p>
<p>to try and find the exact foods that are causing problems</p>
<p>and the exact foods that the kids can eat</p>
<p>in order to try and get their brain wired up right</p>
<p>and correctly and to avoid lifelong ADHD.</p>
<p>And their answer was really interesting.</p>
<p>But before I tell you their answer,</p>
<p>I want to tell you the studies</p>
<p>and the data related to this question</p>
<p>of whether or not food and the constellation of foods</p>
<p>that one avoids and will eat</p>
<p>has anything to do with our levels of attention</p>
<p>and in particular, whether or not that can be used</p>
<p>as a leverage point to treat ADHD.</p>
<p>So you can imagine the challenges of exploring the role</p>
<p>of diet and nutrition in any study,</p>
<p>but especially in a study on ADHD.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>children with ADHD and it turns out adults with ADHD</p>
<p>tend to pursue sugary foods or any types of food</p>
<p>that increase their levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>They are naturally drawn to those foods,</p>
<p>whether or not they realize it or not,</p>
<p>presumably as a way to try and treat</p>
<p>their lack of focus and impulsivity.</p>
<p>So in this study that I&rsquo;m about to share with you,</p>
<p>there was no drug treatment.</p>
<p>It was just a study manipulating diet</p>
<p>and involved a hundred children,</p>
<p>50 in the so-called elimination diet group,</p>
<p>the special diet where certain foods were eliminated</p>
<p>and 50 in the so-called control group.</p>
<p>However, being a well-designed randomized controlled trial,</p>
<p>the study also included a crossover,</p>
<p>meaning where the kids would serve as their own control</p>
<p>or control group at a certain portion of the studies.</p>
<p>They would be in one group</p>
<p>where they eliminated certain foods.</p>
<p>And then after a period of time in the study,</p>
<p>they would swap to the other group.</p>
<p>This is a powerful way to design a study</p>
<p>for reasons that you can imagine</p>
<p>because you start to eliminate changes</p>
<p>and effects due to individual differences.</p>
<p>In any case, a hundred children total,</p>
<p>50 in each group at any one period in time.</p>
<p>And the effects that they observed were extremely dramatic.</p>
<p>In the world of statistics and analysis of scientific data,</p>
<p>we talk about P values, probability values.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the likelihood that something could happen</p>
<p>according to chance?</p>
<p>And typically the cutoff would be something</p>
<p>like P less than 0.05.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s less than 0.05 chance,</p>
<p>essentially of the effect being due to chance.</p>
<p>However, in this study,</p>
<p>every single one of the effects is P less than 0.0001.</p>
<p>Very, very infinitesimally small probability</p>
<p>that the effect observed could be due to chance.</p>
<p>So what were these effects?</p>
<p>These effects were enhanced ability to focus,</p>
<p>less impulsivity, even less tendency to move</p>
<p>when trying to sit still.</p>
<p>So everything from mental focus</p>
<p>to the ability to control their bodies</p>
<p>improved when they were in the elimination diet group.</p>
<p>What was eliminated?</p>
<p>Well, the elimination diet in this particular study</p>
<p>was a so-called oligoantigenic diet.</p>
<p>It was a diet in which each kid took a test</p>
<p>to determine which foods they had antibodies for,</p>
<p>meaning that they were mildly allergic to.</p>
<p>Now in this study,</p>
<p>it was very important that the kids</p>
<p>not be extremely allergic to any food</p>
<p>because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>they actually served as a control at one point in the study</p>
<p>where they were eating all sorts of foods,</p>
<p>including foods that they had mild allergies to.</p>
<p>So basically what this study said</p>
<p>was that eliminating foods to which children have allergies</p>
<p>can dramatically improve their symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>And this study, not surprisingly,</p>
<p>because it was published in such a high quality journal,</p>
<p>Lancet, et cetera, large number of subjects,</p>
<p>set the world on fire.</p>
<p>People were extremely excited about these results</p>
<p>because here in the absence of any drug treatment,</p>
<p>there was a significant improvement</p>
<p>in ADHD symptoms observed.</p>
<p>And then came the criticisms.</p>
<p>So many papers were published after this,</p>
<p>specifically dealing with reanalysis of these data.</p>
<p>And I want to be fair in saying that</p>
<p>the data in the paper look good,</p>
<p>but there are criticisms</p>
<p>of the overall structural design of the study.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into all the details exactly</p>
<p>because it gets really nuanced</p>
<p>about some of the statistics</p>
<p>and the way that one examines these types of data,</p>
<p>but there was skepticism.</p>
<p>And in science, skepticism is healthy,</p>
<p>especially when making decisions</p>
<p>about whether or not to treat or feed children</p>
<p>one food or another, or give them one drug or another.</p>
<p>Now I want to return to the story of my friend</p>
<p>who is a pediatric neurologist and treats ADHD</p>
<p>and has a child who is on the precipice</p>
<p>of perhaps starting to take drugs for the treatment of ADHD.</p>
<p>I asked the simple question,</p>
<p>do you see an effect of diet?</p>
<p>Meaning when parents control the diet of their children,</p>
<p>does it make a positive or negative or no difference</p>
<p>in terms of the way that the kids respond to ADHD drugs</p>
<p>like Ritalin and Adderall,</p>
<p>or whether or not it can help them avoid</p>
<p>treating with those drugs entirely.</p>
<p>And her response was very straightforward.</p>
<p>She said, elimination of simple sugars</p>
<p>has a dramatic and positive effect.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s observed that over and over and over again</p>
<p>in many dozens, if not hundreds of patients.</p>
<p>Okay, now that&rsquo;s not a peer reviewed study.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a statement that I&rsquo;m conveying to you anecdotally,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a highly, highly informed one.</p>
<p>I said, what about these elimination diets?</p>
<p>She said, and I found other sources to support this,</p>
<p>that these oligo-antigenic diets are controversial.</p>
<p>There are many people who really believe</p>
<p>in identifying all the things that you&rsquo;re allergic to</p>
<p>and making sure that you and especially your kids</p>
<p>avoid those foods.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s another camp that&rsquo;s starting to emerge</p>
<p>in the peer reviewed scientific literature,</p>
<p>showing that when kids are not exposed to certain foods,</p>
<p>in particular nuts and things of that sort,</p>
<p>they develop allergies to those foods.</p>
<p>And then when exposed to them later,</p>
<p>they cause real problems.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole galaxy of discussion and controversy</p>
<p>and outright fighting about allergies in kids</p>
<p>and whether or not the oligo-antigenic diet</p>
<p>is the appropriate one.</p>
<p>However, out of the four neurologists and psychiatrists</p>
<p>that I spoke to about ADHD in preparation for this,</p>
<p>every single one said, children with ADHD,</p>
<p>as much as possible should be encouraged to avoid</p>
<p>high sugar and simple sugar foods of most kinds.</p>
<p>And if they can find particular foods</p>
<p>that exacerbate their symptoms,</p>
<p>obviously eliminating those foods is beneficial.</p>
<p>And the foods that exacerbate their symptoms</p>
<p>change over time.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t like giving a complicated answer,</p>
<p>but I also don&rsquo;t like giving an incomplete answer.</p>
<p>What this tells me is that children,</p>
<p>and especially young children who have ADHD</p>
<p>should probably not eat much sugar</p>
<p>in particular simple sugars.</p>
<p>In addition to that, exploring whether or not</p>
<p>they have existing allergies to foods they already consume</p>
<p>might be a good idea.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what this paper,</p>
<p>the Pelser et al Lancet paper seems to speak to.</p>
<p>And I should mention that that paper was published in 2011.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been many dozens of studies</p>
<p>exploring the same thing,</p>
<p>as well as meta-analyses of all those data.</p>
<p>And it does appear that diet can have</p>
<p>a highly significant role in eliminating</p>
<p>or at least reducing the symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>So much so that some of the children</p>
<p>are able to not take medication at all</p>
<p>or eventually wean themselves off medication</p>
<p>as young adults and as adults.</p>
<p>One interesting question is whether or not</p>
<p>adults should modify their diet</p>
<p>in order to increase their levels of focus</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re already having normal levels of focus,</p>
<p>but would like more,</p>
<p>or would like to reduce existing adult ADHD.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting and even more controversial topic.</p>
<p>It brings us right into the realm</p>
<p>of what are called omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times on this podcast</p>
<p>about the known benefits of omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>in particular, getting one gram, 1,000 milligrams or more,</p>
<p>even as much as 2,000 milligrams each day</p>
<p>of the so-called EPA component of omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>known to have antidepressant effects,</p>
<p>mood elevating effects,</p>
<p>known to have important effects</p>
<p>protecting the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s now clear</p>
<p>that the immune system also benefits</p>
<p>that omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>that include a gram or more of EPAs are very beneficial.</p>
<p>Typically, that&rsquo;s done through fish oil.</p>
<p>Liquid fish oil is going to be the most cost-efficient,</p>
<p>but there are capsule forms.</p>
<p>For those of you that don&rsquo;t like fish oil,</p>
<p>you can ingest this through other means.</p>
<p>You can get it from certain algaes or krill, et cetera.</p>
<p>You have to make it compatible with your particular diet,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re vegan or vegetarian</p>
<p>or omnivore, et cetera.</p>
<p>Omega-3s have been shown</p>
<p>to have all these positive health benefits.</p>
<p>Do they have positive effects on focus and attention?</p>
<p>And the answer is you can find studies</p>
<p>that support that statement,</p>
<p>and the effects are significant,</p>
<p>but the effects are modest.</p>
<p>You can also find studies that show no effect.</p>
<p>However, much like with omega-3s and antidepressants,</p>
<p>whereby ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>of a gram or more of EPA per day</p>
<p>allows people with major depression</p>
<p>to get away with taking lower doses</p>
<p>of antidepressant medication,</p>
<p>it does seem that ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>in adults that include EPAs of 1,000 milligrams or more</p>
<p>can allow adults with ADHD</p>
<p>or mild attention deficit issues</p>
<p>to function well on lower doses of medication</p>
<p>and in rare cases to eliminate medication entirely.</p>
<p>So what this says is once again</p>
<p>that the omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial.</p>
<p>Will they cure or eliminate ADHD?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say no.</p>
<p>They are playing a supportive</p>
<p>or what we call a modulatory role.</p>
<p>Just like good sleep plays a supportive</p>
<p>and modulatory role for essentially everything,</p>
<p>your immune system, your ability to think,</p>
<p>your ability to regulate your emotion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s modulating that process.</p>
<p>This component of modulation</p>
<p>is extremely important to highlight,</p>
<p>and I think I want to spend a moment on it</p>
<p>because this is especially important</p>
<p>in the context of ADHD</p>
<p>and all the information that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>There are biological processes</p>
<p>that are mediated by particular compounds like dopamine.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>the ability to feel motivated and to attend to focus</p>
<p>is mediated by the circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that release dopamine.</p>
<p>However, attention is also modulated by how rested you are.</p>
<p>If you want to eliminate your ability to think well at all,</p>
<p>just stay up for two nights and don&rsquo;t sleep at all, right?</p>
<p>If you do that,</p>
<p>you will have modulated the circuits in your brain</p>
<p>that respond to various things</p>
<p>and you will be highly distractible.</p>
<p>You will be highly emotional.</p>
<p>You will feel like garbage,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that sleep</p>
<p>mediates focus and attention.</p>
<p>It modulates it indirectly.</p>
<p>Likewise, I think these omega-3 fatty acids,</p>
<p>in particular the EPAs,</p>
<p>which are so beneficial for mood</p>
<p>and apparently also for attention,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t directly mediate attention and mood.</p>
<p>What they do is they modulate those circuits.</p>
<p>They make dopamine more available.</p>
<p>They make whatever dopamine is available</p>
<p>more likely to bind to the various receptors</p>
<p>that are present on neurons and so forth.</p>
<p>And I think this is very important because likewise,</p>
<p>diet and any discussion about nutrition</p>
<p>has to include this framework of,</p>
<p>is the diet, the elimination diet,</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s some other diet</p>
<p>or esoteric diet, ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>is it modulating or mediating a process?</p>
<p>And most likely in the context of ADHD,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s modulating that process.</p>
<p>So if the ADHD is mild or if it&rsquo;s caught early enough,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s in conjunction with pharmacology,</p>
<p>with a prescription treatment,</p>
<p>well, then it might help guide the child or adult</p>
<p>to a better place of being able to focus.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not going to be the switch that flips everything.</p>
<p>Now, that does not mean that consuming the wrong foods,</p>
<p>sugary foods or foods that you happen to be allergic to</p>
<p>is a good idea.</p>
<p>It will still be detrimental.</p>
<p>So I hope that conceptual framework helps</p>
<p>because if you go online,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody with ADHD or not,</p>
<p>you are going to be bombarded with the ADHD diet,</p>
<p>the oligoantigenic diet, the elimination,</p>
<p>this supplement, that EPA.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>something mediating a process or modulating a process.</p>
<p>Now, drugs like Ritalin, drugs like Adderall,</p>
<p>they are tapping into the circuitries</p>
<p>and the neurochemistries that mediate attention and focus.</p>
<p>They are not the only alternatives</p>
<p>or the only choices rather for treatment of these circuits</p>
<p>and enhancement of the circuits for focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about other alternatives</p>
<p>and some behavioral alternatives that are not very well known</p>
<p>but are very, very effective in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But I really want to make this clear distinction</p>
<p>between modulation and mediation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s vital for anyone that&rsquo;s trying to modulate</p>
<p>or mediate anything within their own brain.</p>
<p>If any of you are interested in this oligoantigenic diet</p>
<p>as it relates to ADHD,</p>
<p>and you want to explore a more recent study,</p>
<p>besides that classic 2011 Lancet study</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rather controversial,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a paper that was published</p>
<p>in Frontiers in Psychiatry just last year, 2020.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Oligoantigenic Diet Improves Children&rsquo;s ADHD Rating</p>
<p>Scale Scores Reliably in Added Video Rating.</p>
<p>The added video rating is just that they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>an additional measure of focus and attention.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s Frontiers in Psychiatry, 2020.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a link to it in the caption.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a more recent study for you to peruse.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about the neural circuits of focus</p>
<p>and the chemistry of focus,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t talked yet about</p>
<p>what would make us better at focusing</p>
<p>and what focusing better really is.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a step back and think about how we focus</p>
<p>and how to get better at focus.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to share with you a tool</p>
<p>for which there are terrific research data</p>
<p>that will allow you in a single session</p>
<p>to enhance your ability to focus in theory forever.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to read you is from an excellent book</p>
<p>that I recommend if any of you are interested</p>
<p>in neuroscience and things like meditation</p>
<p>and default mode networks and things of that sort.</p>
<p>The book is called Altered Traits.</p>
<p>Science Reveals How Meditation Changes</p>
<p>Your Mind, Brain and Body.</p>
<p>And no, I&rsquo;m not going to try and convince you to meditate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to share with you a small passage in the book</p>
<p>that relates some research data</p>
<p>related to focus that are very important.</p>
<p>If you want to meditate, that&rsquo;s your choice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a separate matter.</p>
<p>This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that Goleman</p>
<p>is a well-known author.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s written books on emotional intelligence and so forth.</p>
<p>Richard Davidson is also a PhD.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor of psychology and psychiatry.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s at a University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done terrific work on brain states</p>
<p>and modulation of brain states and so forth.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re about to talk about is when attention works</p>
<p>and when attention falters.</p>
<p>And what we are specifically going to talk about</p>
<p>are what are called attentional blinks,</p>
<p>not actual eye blinks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about that in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to talk about attentional blinks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here</p>
<p>because Goleman and Davidson wrote about this so beautifully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather paraphrase from them</p>
<p>than try and just make up a new way to say it</p>
<p>that is less interesting or less good,</p>
<p>but I want to credit them.</p>
<p>Attentional blinks are really easy to understand</p>
<p>if you think about a where&rsquo;s Waldo task.</p>
<p>You know this task, where&rsquo;s Waldo,</p>
<p>where there are a bunch of people and objects</p>
<p>and things in a picture.</p>
<p>And somewhere in there is Waldo with the striped hat</p>
<p>and the glasses and kind of a skinny dude.</p>
<p>And you have to find Waldo.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a visual search.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s visual search for an object</p>
<p>that has distinct features,</p>
<p>but is embedded in this ocean of other things</p>
<p>that could easily be confused as Waldo.</p>
<p>So you tend to look, look, look, look, look, look, look,</p>
<p>and then you find Waldo.</p>
<p>Kids can do this.</p>
<p>They enjoy doing this.</p>
<p>Adults may or may not enjoy it, but they can do it too.</p>
<p>They find Waldo.</p>
<p>When you find Waldo,</p>
<p>or when you search for a target</p>
<p>in some other visual search task,</p>
<p>at that moment, your nervous system celebrates a little bit.</p>
<p>And it celebrates through the release of neurochemicals</p>
<p>that make you feel good.</p>
<p>You found it and you pause.</p>
<p>Now the pause is interesting because when you pause,</p>
<p>what we know from many experiments</p>
<p>is that in that moment of pause and mild celebration,</p>
<p>however mild,</p>
<p>you are not able to see another Waldo</p>
<p>sitting right next to it.</p>
<p>So what this means is in attending to something,</p>
<p>in searching and in identifying a visual target,</p>
<p>your attention blinked.</p>
<p>It shut off for a second.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a more formal and more laboratory type way</p>
<p>that we look at this.</p>
<p>The more typical way to do this</p>
<p>is to give someone a string of letters</p>
<p>or a string of numbers.</p>
<p>And beforehand, you tell them,</p>
<p>be on the lookout for the letters R and Z.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re just going to watch</p>
<p>this string of numbers go by,</p>
<p>and there will be a letter R in there,</p>
<p>and there will be a letter Z in there,</p>
<p>and try and spot them both.</p>
<p>And what you find is when you present that string of numbers</p>
<p>and then they see the R, they see the R,</p>
<p>they register it consciously,</p>
<p>and they tend to miss the Z,</p>
<p>just like in the Waldo type example.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the numbers are going by pretty quickly,</p>
<p>but they can spot the R.</p>
<p>They could also spot the Z if you told them beforehand,</p>
<p>just spot the Z.</p>
<p>And the numbers are moving through at the same rate</p>
<p>in both conditions.</p>
<p>So what that means is that in every case,</p>
<p>you are capable of seeing the R or the Z.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you try and see both</p>
<p>that seeing the first one prevents you</p>
<p>from seeing the second one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we call an attentional blink.</p>
<p>We do this all the time,</p>
<p>and people with ADHD tend to have many more</p>
<p>attentional blinks than people that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And this is true for children and for adults.</p>
<p>This is an important point,</p>
<p>so important that I want to emphasize it twice</p>
<p>in case you attentionally blinked.</p>
<p>If you see something that you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re very interested in something,</p>
<p>you are definitely missing other information,</p>
<p>in part because you&rsquo;re over-focusing on something.</p>
<p>And this leads to a very interesting hypothesis</p>
<p>about what might go wrong in ADHD,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve always thought that they cannot focus,</p>
<p>and yet we know they can focus on things</p>
<p>they care very much about.</p>
<p>Well, maybe, just maybe,</p>
<p>they are experiencing more attentional blinks</p>
<p>than people who do not have ADHD.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are data now to support the possibility</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s actually what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And that should be exciting to anyone that has ADHD.</p>
<p>It should also be exciting to anyone</p>
<p>that cares about increasing their focus</p>
<p>and their ability to attend.</p>
<p>What this is saying is that these circuits</p>
<p>that underlie focus and our ability to attend</p>
<p>and our ability to eliminate distraction,</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t just failing to focus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a semantic way of describing the outcome.</p>
<p>They are over-focusing on certain things</p>
<p>and thereby missing other things.</p>
<p>And so our distractibility or the distractibility</p>
<p>of somebody with ADHD could exist</p>
<p>because they are over-focusing on certain elements</p>
<p>and they are therefore missing other elements</p>
<p>that they should be attending to.</p>
<p>So what they really need is this property</p>
<p>that we call open monitoring.</p>
<p>Now, open monitoring is something that&rsquo;s described</p>
<p>in the book that I just referred to.</p>
<p>And that typically is associated with people</p>
<p>who have done a lot of meditation,</p>
<p>so-called Vipassana meditation,</p>
<p>or have spent a lot of time learning how to do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called open gaze visual analysis</p>
<p>and open gaze thinking.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a simpler version of this</p>
<p>that allows us to bypass all that.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>your visual system has two modes of processing.</p>
<p>It can be highly focused, a soda straw view.</p>
<p>So looking for the R in this string of numbers</p>
<p>in the example that I just gave,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re very excited about something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in that soda straw view of the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re missing other things, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s high levels of attention.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s also a property of your visual system</p>
<p>that allows you to dilate your gaze,</p>
<p>to be in so-called panoramic vision.</p>
<p>Panoramic vision is something you can do right now,</p>
<p>no matter where you are.</p>
<p>And I can do it right now.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m doing it,</p>
<p>but even though I&rsquo;m still looking directly at you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m consciously dilating my gaze</p>
<p>so that I can see the ceiling, the floor,</p>
<p>and the walls all around me.</p>
<p>That panoramic vision is actually mediated</p>
<p>by a separate stream or set of neural circuits</p>
<p>going from the eye into the brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a stream or set of circuits</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t just wide angle view.</p>
<p>It also is better at processing things in time.</p>
<p>Its frame rate is higher.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve seen slow motion video</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve seen standard video.</p>
<p>Slow motion video gives you that slow motion look</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a higher frame rate,</p>
<p>your thin slicing time, okay?</p>
<p>You can use panoramic vision to access the state</p>
<p>that we call open monitoring.</p>
<p>When people do that,</p>
<p>they are able to attend to and recognize multiple targets</p>
<p>within this string of numbers.</p>
<p>They can see the R and they can see the Z</p>
<p>and they can see additional things.</p>
<p>So this is something that can be trained up</p>
<p>and people can practice whether or not they have ADHD or not.</p>
<p>What it involves is learning</p>
<p>how to dilate your gaze consciously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually quite easy for most people.</p>
<p>Whether or not you wear corrective lenses</p>
<p>or contacts or not,</p>
<p>you can consciously go into open gaze</p>
<p>and then you can contract your field of view as well.</p>
<p>There have also been studies done</p>
<p>where people were taught to think in a particular way</p>
<p>for a very short period of time</p>
<p>and that forever changed their ability</p>
<p>to limit or reduce the number of these attentional blinks.</p>
<p>There are now published accounts in the literature</p>
<p>of a simple practice done for about 15 minutes</p>
<p>where subjects were asked to just sit quietly,</p>
<p>eyes closed and do what is sort of akin to meditation</p>
<p>but to not direct their mind</p>
<p>into any particular state or place,</p>
<p>but simply to think about their breathing</p>
<p>and to focus on their so-called interoception,</p>
<p>focus on how their body feels,</p>
<p>if their mind drifted to bring it back.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s basically meditation for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>That might not seem like a significant or unusual practice</p>
<p>or that it would have any impact at all,</p>
<p>but remarkably, just doing that once for 17 minutes</p>
<p>significantly reduced the number of attentional blinks</p>
<p>that people would carry out.</p>
<p>In other words, their focus got better</p>
<p>in a near permanent way without any additional training.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that practice</p>
<p>of reducing the amount of visual information coming in</p>
<p>and learning to pay attention to one&rsquo;s internal state,</p>
<p>what we call interoception,</p>
<p>that allowed them an awareness</p>
<p>such that when they needed to look for visual targets,</p>
<p>when they need to focus on multiple things in sequence,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t experience the same number of attentional blinks.</p>
<p>And I should mention, not incidentally,</p>
<p>as people age and their working memory gets worse</p>
<p>and their ability to focus gets worse,</p>
<p>the number of attentional blinks</p>
<p>that they carry out goes up.</p>
<p>And there are now studies exploring</p>
<p>whether or not this simple meditation-like practice</p>
<p>of 15 to 20 minutes or so of sitting</p>
<p>and just quietly resting and paying attention</p>
<p>to one&rsquo;s breathing and internal state</p>
<p>can also offset some of that age-related,</p>
<p>what is called cognitive decline.</p>
<p>So what these data tell me is that</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re a child</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re an adult, whether or not you have ADHD or not,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>or you would simply like to avoid</p>
<p>age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>a simple practice of taking 17 minutes,</p>
<p>sitting and paying attention to your internal state,</p>
<p>just interocepting, registering your breathing,</p>
<p>registering the contact of your skin</p>
<p>with whatever surface you&rsquo;re on,</p>
<p>can forever rewire your brain to be able to attend better</p>
<p>and possibly even offset</p>
<p>some of that age-related attentional drift.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t expect anyone to start meditating regularly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect anyone to do anything they don&rsquo;t want to do,</p>
<p>but I think most of us could handle one meditation session</p>
<p>of 17 minutes or so.</p>
<p>And so if ever there was a tool that stood to rewire</p>
<p>our attentional circuitry in a powerful way,</p>
<p>this seems to be it.</p>
<p>And in addition, the ability to engage in panoramic vision,</p>
<p>to dilate our gaze, this so-called open monitoring</p>
<p>that allows the brain to function in a way</p>
<p>that it can detect more information faster,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a powerful tool as well.</p>
<p>And the beauty of that tool is that it works the first time</p>
<p>and it works every time.</p>
<p>Now, how exactly it works is a little bit unclear.</p>
<p>Is it, for instance, orchestrating this synchrony</p>
<p>or asynchrony between the default mode network</p>
<p>and the task-related networks?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Those studies have not yet been carried out.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the effects are significant.</p>
<p>They are long-lasting and they appear to exist</p>
<p>after just one session</p>
<p>of this quiet 17-minute interoception,</p>
<p>which to me makes it seem like a very worthwhile thing</p>
<p>to do for everybody.</p>
<p>So we just talked about attentional blinks,</p>
<p>which are essentially blinks of thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your mind shutting off for a moment</p>
<p>and missing information.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about actual blinks,</p>
<p>the sort that you do with your eyelids.</p>
<p>Now, this might come across as somewhat obvious,</p>
<p>but you can do fast, what are called spontaneous blinks,</p>
<p>and they are always coordinated between the two eyes,</p>
<p>or you can do long blinks,</p>
<p>like when you go to sleep at night,</p>
<p>you do one very long blink, and I&rsquo;m not being facetious.</p>
<p>When you go to sleep at night, you are shutting your eyelids</p>
<p>and you are limiting the amount of information coming in,</p>
<p>and your perception of time starts to drift</p>
<p>as you go into sleep.</p>
<p>Your perception of time changes from very fast</p>
<p>at one moment to very slow,</p>
<p>meaning the frame rate at which you are analyzing</p>
<p>information, dreaming, et cetera,</p>
<p>is variable when you are in sleep.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s very fast,</p>
<p>meaning you experience things in slow motion,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s very fast.</p>
<p>In waking too, your experience of time</p>
<p>can sometimes be very fast, sometimes be very slow.</p>
<p>Typically, the more alert you are,</p>
<p>the higher the frame rate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thin slicing your experience.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably had this happen</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ever very stressed</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re waiting for something or somebody,</p>
<p>it seems like it takes forever</p>
<p>because your frame rate is higher,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re analyzing time more finely.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you are very relaxed or even sleepy,</p>
<p>you wake up and you have to think about</p>
<p>all the things you have to do,</p>
<p>it will seem like the world is going by very, very fast</p>
<p>and that you are moving very slow.</p>
<p>Time is going at the same rate,</p>
<p>but your perception of time is what&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>Believe it or not,</p>
<p>your perception of time is also changed on a rapid basis,</p>
<p>moment to moment basis by how often you blink.</p>
<p>This is a well-established literature</p>
<p>in the world of neuroscience</p>
<p>that unlike the literature and claims</p>
<p>about blinking and sociopathy, which have no basis,</p>
<p>the science of blinking as it relates to time perception</p>
<p>has some very good data to support it.</p>
<p>I want to just emphasize one study in particular,</p>
<p>which is quite appropriately titled</p>
<p>Time Dilates After Spontaneous Blinking.</p>
<p>This is a paper that was published in Current Biology.</p>
<p>The first author is Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful paper.</p>
<p>They examined the relationship between fluctuations</p>
<p>in timing and blinking.</p>
<p>And to make a long story short,</p>
<p>what they found is that right after blinks,</p>
<p>we reset our perception of time, okay?</p>
<p>So blinks in that sense are a little bit</p>
<p>like the curtain coming down on a scene</p>
<p>between scenes in a play or takes in a movie.</p>
<p>You know, when they clap, the clap thing,</p>
<p>they start it, take, you know, or what do they say?</p>
<p>Action.</p>
<p>And then at the end they do the thing</p>
<p>and they click it down and they say, it&rsquo;s a take.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one take.</p>
<p>When you blink, it&rsquo;s a take, okay?</p>
<p>Now what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>and will immediately make sense to you</p>
<p>as to why this is important</p>
<p>is that the rate of blinking is controlled by dopamine.</p>
<p>So what this means is that dopamine is controlling attention</p>
<p>blinks relate to attention and focus.</p>
<p>And therefore the dopamine and blinking system</p>
<p>is one way that you constantly modulate</p>
<p>and update your perception of time.</p>
<p>And fortunately, it&rsquo;s also one that you can control.</p>
<p>So the basic takeaway of this study</p>
<p>was that blinking controls time perception,</p>
<p>but also that levels of dopamine</p>
<p>can alter your sense of time.</p>
<p>And stay with me here.</p>
<p>And that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>They are working together to control your attention.</p>
<p>When dopamine levels go up,</p>
<p>people tend to overestimate how long something lasted.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they are processing time more finely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s slow motion mode.</p>
<p>When dopamine levels are lower,</p>
<p>they tend to underestimate time intervals.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s remember back to the very beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in people with ADHD.</p>
<p>They are not good at managing their time.</p>
<p>They tend to run late or they are disorganized.</p>
<p>They are not just disorganized in space,</p>
<p>meaning in the physical space around them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re disorganized in time.</p>
<p>Their dopamine is low.</p>
<p>We know that as well.</p>
<p>And so they are underestimating time intervals.</p>
<p>And so it makes perfect sense that they would be late.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that they would lose track of time</p>
<p>or the ability to focus.</p>
<p>This is really exciting because what it means is that</p>
<p>children with ADHD, adults with ADHD,</p>
<p>or people with normal levels of focus</p>
<p>that want to improve their ability to focus</p>
<p>can do so through a training that involves</p>
<p>learning how often to blink and when,</p>
<p>and how to keep their visual focus on a given target.</p>
<p>And it turns out this study has actually been done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study, again, I&rsquo;ll link to this study,</p>
<p>entitled Improvement of Attention</p>
<p>in Elementary School Students</p>
<p>Through Fixation-Focused Training Activity.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go through all the details,</p>
<p>but what they found was a short period of</p>
<p>focusing on a visual target</p>
<p>allowed these school children to greatly enhance</p>
<p>their ability to focus on other types of information.</p>
<p>And a significant component of the effect</p>
<p>was due to the way that they were</p>
<p>controlling the shutters on their eyes, their eyelids,</p>
<p>and controlling their blinks.</p>
<p>So what they did in this study is they had these kids</p>
<p>focus their visual attention on some object</p>
<p>that was relatively close, like their hand,</p>
<p>for a minute or so, which actually takes some effort</p>
<p>if you try and do that.</p>
<p>They were allowed to blink.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s known from other work</p>
<p>that if people can consciously override the desire to blink,</p>
<p>at least to the point where they feel like they have to,</p>
<p>or else their eyes would dry out,</p>
<p>that actually can increase attention even further.</p>
<p>And they had conditions where they would look</p>
<p>at a point further across the room</p>
<p>and even further across the room.</p>
<p>It only took a few minutes each day to do this,</p>
<p>30 seconds in one condition, or maybe a minute,</p>
<p>and then at another station</p>
<p>of looking a little bit further out</p>
<p>and a little bit further out.</p>
<p>However, there was an important feature of this study</p>
<p>that is definitely worth mentioning,</p>
<p>which is before they did this visual focus task or training,</p>
<p>they did a series of physical movements with the kids</p>
<p>so that the kids could sort of eliminate or move out</p>
<p>some of their desire to move</p>
<p>and would thereby enhance their ability to sit still.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s long been known that kids need a recess.</p>
<p>They need time to run around and play and roll around,</p>
<p>do whatever it is that they do</p>
<p>in order to be able to sit still at all.</p>
<p>Adults probably need this too, frankly,</p>
<p>but kids need it more because the circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that control reflexive movements</p>
<p>and as we say, kind of rhythmic undulating behavior</p>
<p>and things like that, that&rsquo;s an active suppression.</p>
<p>And kids have less of that circuitry built up</p>
<p>until they hit about age 15 or 16.</p>
<p>So they had the kids move around a bit</p>
<p>and then do this focus training.</p>
<p>That brings me to another treatment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actively used nowadays in schools</p>
<p>for kids with ADHD,</p>
<p>but also starting to be used by many kids and by parents</p>
<p>in order to keep their kids focusing</p>
<p>and not going crazy in the car or not acting out in general.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the prevalence of these so-called fidgeter toys</p>
<p>or things that kids can do actively and repetitively</p>
<p>in order to move out some of their underlying</p>
<p>reverberatory activity in their nervous system.</p>
<p>So what you will find is that some kids with ADHD</p>
<p>are now given a rubber band on their desk,</p>
<p>literally a rubber band that&rsquo;s attached to their desk</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to pull on it,</p>
<p>even snap it against the desk.</p>
<p>If I had done that when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I think my teachers would have thrown me out of class,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s great that they&rsquo;re allowing them</p>
<p>to do this now as a way of moving</p>
<p>some of their physical energy out</p>
<p>or engage their physical energy rather,</p>
<p>as opposed to trying to sit statue still</p>
<p>all the time and attend.</p>
<p>And it turns out that does enhance</p>
<p>these children&rsquo;s ability to focus mentally</p>
<p>when they have some physical activity to attend to.</p>
<p>And it turns out it also can work for adults.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share with you a related anecdote</p>
<p>because it illustrates the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the great privilege of being able to do</p>
<p>a number of surgeries, brain surgeries during my career.</p>
<p>So one thing you find when you do brain surgeries</p>
<p>is that the brain&rsquo;s pretty small,</p>
<p>regardless of the species that you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in there and you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>something very specific.</p>
<p>And the more you try and hold your hands really steady,</p>
<p>the more they want to shake, all right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not natural for any of our limbs</p>
<p>to sit perfectly still,</p>
<p>depending on how much coffee you&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>how well rested you are,</p>
<p>and your sort of baseline level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>Some of you may find that you can hold out your hand</p>
<p>at absolutely rock solid.</p>
<p>Others will shake a little bit more.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re nervous if you&rsquo;re shaking,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re calm if you&rsquo;re still.</p>
<p>What it relates to is the amount of what we call</p>
<p>premotor activity, the number of commands to move</p>
<p>that are being sent through the system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I mean by reverberatory activity.</p>
<p>And it does seem that kids with ADHD and adults with ADHD</p>
<p>have a lot of reverberatory activity</p>
<p>in their nervous system.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s that constant desire to move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for them to sit still,</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s hard for them to attend</p>
<p>to harness their attention.</p>
<p>When you do a surgery and you find that your hands</p>
<p>are shaking, what you learn from your mentors,</p>
<p>which I did, and what works extremely well,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re doing a surgery or not,</p>
<p>is that you simply tap your foot</p>
<p>or you bounce your knee a little bit,</p>
<p>which you might think would make your handshake even more,</p>
<p>but provided that it&rsquo;s subtle,</p>
<p>what it does is it actually shuttles some of the activity</p>
<p>from those premotor circuits to elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re able to sit much more still with your hand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re able to perform the surgery</p>
<p>with much more precision.</p>
<p>You are able to write with much better handwriting.</p>
<p>And for those of you who engage in public speaking,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ever too nervous,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why pacing while you public speak helps.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re nervous, that&rsquo;s why bouncing your knee</p>
<p>behind the podium works as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why nodding your head and gesticulating can help.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of quote unquote,</p>
<p>moving energy out of the body.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t actually happen.</p>
<p>What it is is you&rsquo;re engaging those premotor circuits</p>
<p>that are sending through commands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like trying to stuff a bunch of stuff through a funnel</p>
<p>and it creates this tension.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re giving it an outlet for the neural circuitry</p>
<p>to be able to move something so that you can keep</p>
<p>other components of your body and your mental attention</p>
<p>engaged and locked onto something, what we call focus.</p>
<p>One thing related to this whole business of blinking</p>
<p>and focus and training yourself to focus</p>
<p>and not blinking, et cetera,</p>
<p>is that most all of the drugs,</p>
<p>Ritalin, Adderall, and recreational drugs</p>
<p>that increase dopamine, even coffee and tea</p>
<p>and other forms of caffeine,</p>
<p>they tend to make us blink less.</p>
<p>And when we get tired, we tend to blink more.</p>
<p>Now, this is sort of a duh, right?</p>
<p>But being wide-eyed with excitement or fear,</p>
<p>or with your eyes barely being able to keep them open,</p>
<p>now it should make perfect sense that these shutters</p>
<p>on the front of your eyes,</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t just there for winking</p>
<p>and they aren&rsquo;t just there for cosmetic purposes.</p>
<p>They are there to regulate the amount of information</p>
<p>going into your nervous system.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re there to regulate how long</p>
<p>you are bringing information into your nervous system.</p>
<p>And in what bins, how widely or finely you are binning time</p>
<p>is set by how often you blink,</p>
<p>and how widely or specifically you are grabbing attention</p>
<p>from the visual world is set by whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re viewing things very specifically,</p>
<p>like a crosshair or through a soda straw view like this,</p>
<p>or whether or not you are in this panoramic</p>
<p>sort of whole environment mode,</p>
<p>this kind of fisheye lens or wide angle lens mode.</p>
<p>And in fairness to the pharmacology and the circuitry,</p>
<p>while dopamine and heightened levels of alertness</p>
<p>and excitement tend to make us blink less and attend more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually a study that&rsquo;s looked at</p>
<p>the other neurochemical systems and drugs</p>
<p>and how those relate to blinking.</p>
<p>And so this will all be obvious by the title of the paper</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to share with you.</p>
<p>This is a paper entitled</p>
<p>Decreased Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates</p>
<p>in Chronic Cannabis Users,</p>
<p>Evidence for Striatal Cannabinoid Dopamine Interactions.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m not going to go into all the details here,</p>
<p>but one thing that is somewhat surprising</p>
<p>is that many people with ADHD use or abuse cannabis.</p>
<p>You might think, well, why would they do that?</p>
<p>Because I thought that a increase in dopamine</p>
<p>is actually what&rsquo;s going to lead</p>
<p>to heightened levels of attention,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what these people and children crave.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that cannabis</p>
<p>also increases dopamine transmission in the brain,</p>
<p>but because of the other chemicals it increases,</p>
<p>namely serotonin and some components</p>
<p>of the cannabinoid and opioid system,</p>
<p>it creates that kind of alert, but mellow feel.</p>
<p>And again, here, I&rsquo;m not a proponent of this.</p>
<p>I personally am not a THC or cannabis user.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not my thing.</p>
<p>And obviously it&rsquo;s illegal some places,</p>
<p>and so you have to determine that for yourself.</p>
<p>It does have medical purposes and in some places</p>
<p>it is legal, but THC increases dopamine</p>
<p>and increases neurochemicals</p>
<p>that can also create a state of calm.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that sort of middle ground.</p>
<p>And this paper has a beautiful demonstration</p>
<p>whereby not just while people are using cannabis,</p>
<p>but depending on how long they&rsquo;ve been using cannabis</p>
<p>across their lifespan, the rates of eye blinking change.</p>
<p>So if you look at the number of years</p>
<p>that people have been using cannabis on a regular basis,</p>
<p>either daily or up to, excuse me, weekly or up to daily,</p>
<p>what you find is that for people</p>
<p>that have not been using cannabis at all</p>
<p>or have only been using it for about two years,</p>
<p>their rates of eye blinks are much higher</p>
<p>than people who&rsquo;ve been using it chronically for 10 years.</p>
<p>In other words, people who&rsquo;ve been using cannabis</p>
<p>for 10 years don&rsquo;t blink very often at all.</p>
<p>Now, cannabis has well-known effects in depleting memory,</p>
<p>but it does seem to engage the focus and blinking system</p>
<p>in a way that increases focus.</p>
<p>So basically what I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>marijuana seems to increase people&rsquo;s focus,</p>
<p>but then they can&rsquo;t remember what they were focusing on.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;d like to discuss just briefly</p>
<p>is the so-called interoceptive awareness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s present in people with ADHD,</p>
<p>both children and adults.</p>
<p>Interoceptive awareness is one sense</p>
<p>of one&rsquo;s own internal state,</p>
<p>heartbeat, breathing, contact of skin with a given surface.</p>
<p>For a long time, there was this hypothesis,</p>
<p>this idea that people with ADHD</p>
<p>were just not in touch with how they felt,</p>
<p>that somehow they weren&rsquo;t registering</p>
<p>all the stuff that was going on inside them,</p>
<p>changes in heart rate and so forth.</p>
<p>And so they were behaving in a way that was dysregulated</p>
<p>or appeared dysregulated.</p>
<p>And that if they could just learn to attend</p>
<p>to their internal state better,</p>
<p>that somehow they would function better in the world.</p>
<p>Now, before we described a process,</p>
<p>literally a 17 minute interoceptive exercise</p>
<p>that does seem to lead to improvements</p>
<p>in one&rsquo;s ability to focus for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s very unlikely that that was due</p>
<p>to increasing interoceptive awareness per se.</p>
<p>It probably wasn&rsquo;t because people gain a much heightened</p>
<p>or improved ability to understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on internally.</p>
<p>In fact, you can imagine how that might actually prevent</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s ability to pay attention to things</p>
<p>in the outside world.</p>
<p>So while there is benefit to just sitting there</p>
<p>and being in stillness, as they say,</p>
<p>or focusing on one&rsquo;s breathing and internal state</p>
<p>for sake of then accessing information</p>
<p>in the external world,</p>
<p>a really nice study called Interoceptive Awareness</p>
<p>in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</p>
<p>explored whether or not interoceptive awareness</p>
<p>was different in people with ADHD or did not have ADHD.</p>
<p>And the findings were essentially</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no difference,</p>
<p>that people with ADHD, children and adults,</p>
<p>they are aware of what&rsquo;s going on inside them</p>
<p>just as much as anyone else is.</p>
<p>And the typical measure of interoceptive awareness</p>
<p>is one&rsquo;s ability to count their own heartbeats.</p>
<p>This is actually challenging for some individuals</p>
<p>and very easy for other individuals,</p>
<p>regardless of their attentional capacity.</p>
<p>Some people just can really feel their heartbeat</p>
<p>without taking their pulse, other people cannot.</p>
<p>And these studies are pretty straightforward to do.</p>
<p>You ask people to sit there and to count their heartbeats,</p>
<p>and then you are monitoring their heartbeats</p>
<p>and you get to gauge how accurate they are.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to understand that people with ADHD</p>
<p>are in touch with how they feel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a question of whether or not</p>
<p>they can take the demands that are placed upon them</p>
<p>and enter a cognitive state, a mental state</p>
<p>that allows them to access the information</p>
<p>they need to access.</p>
<p>In other words, whether or not they can focus.</p>
<p>But it is absolutely wrong to think that the child</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s getting up 11 times during a short six minute</p>
<p>interaction at the table, or whether or not a child</p>
<p>who somehow has to venture off every moment</p>
<p>or a coworker of yours who&rsquo;s an adult</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s constantly fidgeting or moving things around</p>
<p>that somehow they are unaware that they are oblivious.</p>
<p>They are not oblivious to how they feel.</p>
<p>Chances are they are very challenged</p>
<p>in the situations that they&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing everything they can</p>
<p>to try and regulate their attention.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s an important study to highlight</p>
<p>because it really underscores the fact</p>
<p>that something else is going on,</p>
<p>and that something else has everything to do</p>
<p>with this ability to coordinate these task-directed networks</p>
<p>and to coordinate that in the proper way</p>
<p>with that default mode network.</p>
<p>And that is a process, as you now know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s regulated exquisitely by certain neurochemicals,</p>
<p>and in particular, the neurochemicals dopamine,</p>
<p>norepinephrine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>And a fourth one I&rsquo;d like to throw into the mix,</p>
<p>which is acetylcholine, which is very vital</p>
<p>for cognitive focus.</p>
<p>So now I want to switch back to talking about</p>
<p>some of the drugs that are typically used</p>
<p>to access those systems, prescription drugs,</p>
<p>and I want to talk about some of the new</p>
<p>and emerging non-prescription approaches</p>
<p>to increasing the levels of dopamine, acetylcholine,</p>
<p>and serotonin in the brain</p>
<p>using various supplement-type compounds,</p>
<p>because several of them are showing</p>
<p>really remarkable efficacy in excellent peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>So before moving to some of the newer atypical compounds</p>
<p>and things sold over the counter,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just briefly return to the classic drugs</p>
<p>that are used to treat ADHD.</p>
<p>These are the ones I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>methylphenidate, also called ritalin,</p>
<p>modafinil, armodafinil is another one, and Adderall.</p>
<p>Again, all of these work by increasing levels</p>
<p>of dopamine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Typically, they are taken orally in pill form,</p>
<p>or sometimes in capsule form.</p>
<p>The dosages that are appropriate</p>
<p>vary according to severity of the condition</p>
<p>for a given person and the age of the person.</p>
<p>This is a complicated landscape for each individual.</p>
<p>They have to figure out the pharmacology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s best for them.</p>
<p>Some individuals are even layering long</p>
<p>or time-to-release ritalin with Adderall in smaller doses.</p>
<p>It can get quite complex,</p>
<p>or it can be quite straightforward.</p>
<p>If you are really interested in these drugs</p>
<p>and how they work, and you&rsquo;d like to get a glance</p>
<p>at a table of all the results from all the studies</p>
<p>of which there are now hundreds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an excellent review about these drugs</p>
<p>and their use and their comparison</p>
<p>to similarly structured drugs,</p>
<p>in particular MDMA and cocaine and amphetamine,</p>
<p>meaning street amphetamine,</p>
<p>to really illustrate the similarities of action</p>
<p>and some of the problems associated with long-term use.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect you to read this article in full.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here so that you don&rsquo;t have to go read these articles,</p>
<p>but in case you want a ton of information,</p>
<p>the paper is Esposito et al., Frontiers in Biosciences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent, excellent review</p>
<p>of the entire literature.</p>
<p>It is quite long.</p>
<p>I can put a link to that study in our caption.</p>
<p>And it essentially describes all the studies</p>
<p>that have been done, peer-reviewed, and published.</p>
<p>It refers to these drugs in an interesting way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just refer to these drugs</p>
<p>as for treatment of ADHD.</p>
<p>It actually refers to them using language</p>
<p>that ordinarily I&rsquo;m not very fond of,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll agree to here,</p>
<p>which is so-called smart drugs or nootropics.</p>
<p>It also covers caffeine, which again,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier, increases dopamine, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>and to some extent, serotonin.</p>
<p>But what I like about this review so much</p>
<p>is that in putting these drugs of abuse,</p>
<p>methamphetamine and cocaine,</p>
<p>right alongside these drugs like Ritalin and Adderall</p>
<p>and also caffeine, we start to realize</p>
<p>that the distinction between drugs of abuse</p>
<p>and the distinction between drugs of treatment</p>
<p>is actually a very fine and sometimes even a blurry line.</p>
<p>And in thinking about whether or not</p>
<p>one wants to use these prescription,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize prescription, not drugs of abuse,</p>
<p>but prescription drugs for treatment</p>
<p>of one&rsquo;s own attentional capacity,</p>
<p>I think it is important to understand</p>
<p>the extent to which they all carry</p>
<p>more or less the same side effects.</p>
<p>The one exception being caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine side effects can be anxiety</p>
<p>if you ingest too much of it, insomnia,</p>
<p>if you drink it too late in the day,</p>
<p>but typically it will not cause the major side effects</p>
<p>of the other drugs,</p>
<p>such as high propensity for addiction and abuse.</p>
<p>Amphetamines of any kind, as well as cocaine,</p>
<p>can cause sexual side effects</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re vasoconstrictors.</p>
<p>So, you know, men have trouble achieving erection.</p>
<p>There can often be the intense desire or libido for sex,</p>
<p>but an inability to actually perform.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an issue with any kind of stimulant.</p>
<p>So these drugs are not without their consequences.</p>
<p>In addition, and here I&rsquo;d lump caffeine back into the mix.</p>
<p>In addition, they almost all carry cardiac effects, right?</p>
<p>They increase heart rate,</p>
<p>but they also have effects on constriction of blood vessels</p>
<p>and arteries and veins and so forth</p>
<p>in ways that can create cardiovascular problems.</p>
<p>Now, caffeine is a bit of a complicated one.</p>
<p>I talked about this on a podcast long ago,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just remind you that it turns out</p>
<p>that if you are caffeine adapted,</p>
<p>in other words, if you are used to drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>then the ingestion of caffeine</p>
<p>most often will cause vasodilation.</p>
<p>It will actually allow more blood flow through.</p>
<p>However, if you are not caffeine adapted,</p>
<p>it will cause vasoconstriction</p>
<p>due to an increased stress response.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re familiar with caffeine,</p>
<p>caffeine can actually have a little bit more</p>
<p>of a relaxation response.</p>
<p>Although if you drink enough of it,</p>
<p>it will make you amped up.</p>
<p>These other drugs almost always lead to vasoconstriction,</p>
<p>increased heart rate, dilation of the pupils,</p>
<p>less blinking, heightened levels of attention,</p>
<p>which looks very much like stress.</p>
<p>And at its extremes, looks very much like</p>
<p>the effects of street drugs like cocaine and amphetamine.</p>
<p>Because of the large amounts of dopamine</p>
<p>that are released in the brain,</p>
<p>people tend to crave that state over and over,</p>
<p>and yet with each subsequent use,</p>
<p>are able to get less and less of that euphoric feeling</p>
<p>or that really, really focused feeling.</p>
<p>So one thing that&rsquo;s being explored quite extensively now</p>
<p>in the treatment of ADHD are drug schedules,</p>
<p>whether or not people should take Adderall every day</p>
<p>or every other day,</p>
<p>whether or not they should take it</p>
<p>only every once in a while,</p>
<p>whether or not young children can take it just a few times</p>
<p>and engage in behavioral training of the sort</p>
<p>that I talked about before,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a 17 minute meditation type exercise,</p>
<p>but more likely it would be the movement</p>
<p>followed by the visual focusing,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s only done for 20 or 30 or 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Well, in a chemically enhanced state,</p>
<p>your brain is more plastic.</p>
<p>The circuits are able to modify and learn better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the optimal time to engage in focus</p>
<p>in a very deliberate way.</p>
<p>So just taking a drug and expecting focus</p>
<p>to just work at any point</p>
<p>and being able to turn focus on and off at will,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an unrealistic expectation, right?</p>
<p>More likely the best use of things like Adderall,</p>
<p>modafinil, armodafinil and Ritalin</p>
<p>is going to be to combine those treatments</p>
<p>with behavioral exercises</p>
<p>that actively engage the very circuits</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to train up and enhance.</p>
<p>And then perhaps, I want to highlight perhaps,</p>
<p>tapering off those drugs</p>
<p>so that then one can use those circuits</p>
<p>without any need for chemical intervention.</p>
<p>So despite any controversy that might be out there,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that the consumption</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids can positively modulate</p>
<p>the systems for attention and focus.</p>
<p>So then the question becomes how much EPA,</p>
<p>how much DHA, does that differ</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s helpful for depression, et cetera?</p>
<p>And actually it does differ.</p>
<p>In reviewing the studies for this,</p>
<p>it appears that a threshold level of 300 milligrams of DHA</p>
<p>turns out to be an important inflection point.</p>
<p>So typically fish oils or other sources of omega-3s</p>
<p>will have DHA and EPA.</p>
<p>And typically it&rsquo;s the EPA</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s harder to get at sufficient levels,</p>
<p>meaning you have to take quite a lot of fish oil</p>
<p>in order to get above that 1,000 milligram</p>
<p>or 2,000 milligram threshold to improve mood</p>
<p>and other functions.</p>
<p>But for sake of attention,</p>
<p>there are 10 studies that have explored this in detail.</p>
<p>And while the EPA component is important,</p>
<p>the most convincing studies point to the fact</p>
<p>that getting above 300 milligrams per day of DHA</p>
<p>is really where you start to see the attentional effects.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, if you&rsquo;re getting sufficient EPA</p>
<p>for sake of mood and other biological functions,</p>
<p>almost without question,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting 300 milligrams or more of DHA.</p>
<p>So that usually checks that box just fine.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that there&rsquo;s another compound,</p>
<p>phosphatidylsterine, that has been explored</p>
<p>for its capacity to improve the symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t think this is any direct way,</p>
<p>but rather in a modulatory way.</p>
<p>But it appears that phosphatidylsterine</p>
<p>taken for two months for 200 milligrams per day</p>
<p>was able to reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children.</p>
<p>It has not been looked at in adults yet,</p>
<p>at least as far as I know,</p>
<p>but that this effect was greatly enhanced</p>
<p>by the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re starting to see synergistic effects</p>
<p>of omega-3 fatty acids and phosphatidylsterine.</p>
<p>Again, that was 200 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>This is something that sold over the counter in capsule form</p>
<p>at least in the US.</p>
<p>There were two studies, both were double blind studies,</p>
<p>carried out for anywhere from one to six months</p>
<p>on both boys and girls.</p>
<p>And it really was boys and girls, not men and women.</p>
<p>This was kids age one to six or seven to 12.</p>
<p>And it was a fairly large number of subjects.</p>
<p>So 147 subjects in one case and 36 in the other.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that getting sufficient levels of EPAs,</p>
<p>in particular, this 300 milligram threshold of DHA,</p>
<p>plus if you are interested in it and it&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of phosphatidylsterine</p>
<p>can be an important augment</p>
<p>for improving the symptoms of ADHD.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also find literature out there</p>
<p>and many claims about so-called ginkgo bilboa,</p>
<p>which has been shown to have minor effects</p>
<p>in improving the symptoms of ADHD,</p>
<p>not nearly as effective as ritalin and Adderall.</p>
<p>Ginkgo bilboa is not appropriate for many people.</p>
<p>I am one such person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have ADHD, but when I&rsquo;ve taken ginkgo,</p>
<p>even at very low doses,</p>
<p>I get absolutely splitting headaches.</p>
<p>Some people do not experience those headaches,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s known to have very potent vasoconstrictive</p>
<p>and vasodilating properties that vary</p>
<p>depending on when you took the compound.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are exploring ginkgo bilboa,</p>
<p>and you will see a lot of claims about ginkgo bilboa</p>
<p>for attention in ADHD,</p>
<p>definitely take the vasodilation, vasoconstriction,</p>
<p>headache issue into consideration.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to talk about the drug modafinil</p>
<p>and the closely related drug armodafinil,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s A-R modafinil,</p>
<p>because modafinil and armodafinil</p>
<p>are gaining popularity out there</p>
<p>both for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy,</p>
<p>but also for communities of people</p>
<p>that are trying to stay awake long periods of time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actively used in the military by first responders,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gaining popularity on college campuses,</p>
<p>and people are using it more and more as an alternative</p>
<p>to Adderall and Ritalin and excessive amounts of coffee.</p>
<p>It does increase focus and to a dramatic extent.</p>
<p>Modafinil typically was very expensive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s still this expensive,</p>
<p>but when one has a prescription for it,</p>
<p>it could still cost as much as eight or $900</p>
<p>or even a thousand dollars a month.</p>
<p>Armodafinil is a far less expensive version</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s chemically slightly different than modafinil.</p>
<p>Regardless of price,</p>
<p>people are taking modafinil and armodafinil.</p>
<p>Want to emphasize that unlike Ritalin and Adderall,</p>
<p>modafinil and armodafinil</p>
<p>are weak dopamine reuptake inhibitors,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how they lead to increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>So whereas Ritalin and Adderall,</p>
<p>amphetamine and cocaine lead to big increases in dopamine,</p>
<p>also through reuptake mechanisms and so forth,</p>
<p>modafinil is a weaker dopamine reuptake stimulator.</p>
<p>And so what that means is that it leaves more dopamine</p>
<p>around to be active at the synapse,</p>
<p>the gaps between neurons.</p>
<p>However, it also activates other systems.</p>
<p>It acts on the orexin system,</p>
<p>which is actually a peptide that we talked about</p>
<p>in the episode on hunger,</p>
<p>because it regulates hunger and appetite,</p>
<p>and it regulates sleepiness and feelings of sleepiness.</p>
<p>In fact, the, excuse me,</p>
<p>orexin also called hypocretin system,</p>
<p>the orexin-hypocretin system</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s disrupted in narcolepsy.</p>
<p>That was the important discovery of my colleagues,</p>
<p>Emmanuel Mignon and Seiji Nishino at Stanford some years ago.</p>
<p>They identified the biological basis of narcolepsy,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a disruption in this orexin-hypocretin system.</p>
<p>And modafinil is one of the primary treatments</p>
<p>for narcolepsy.</p>
<p>It also has these other effects on the dopamine system</p>
<p>and on the norepinephrine system.</p>
<p>Even though it doesn&rsquo;t lead to quite as intense levels</p>
<p>of dopamine and arousal and focus,</p>
<p>it does have the property</p>
<p>of raising levels of attention and focus,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why people are using it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a somewhat milder form of Adderall.</p>
<p>Our modafinil for some people works as well as modafinil,</p>
<p>and as I mentioned before, it&rsquo;s much lower cost.</p>
<p>For other people, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I have an experience, meaning I do have an experience</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll share with you with our modafinil.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was suffering from jet lag</p>
<p>really terribly, and I was traveling overseas.</p>
<p>I went to a meeting to give a talk.</p>
<p>I took half of the prescribed dose of our modafinil.</p>
<p>It was prescribed to me.</p>
<p>I took that half dose, and I gave my lecture,</p>
<p>and then I stayed around to answer questions.</p>
<p>And then four hours later, a friend of mine came up to me</p>
<p>and said, you know, you&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>for four and a half hours,</p>
<p>and there are only a few people still here.</p>
<p>Luckily, there were still a few people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a lot weirder if the room was completely empty,</p>
<p>since it wasn&rsquo;t being recorded.</p>
<p>So I have firsthand knowledge</p>
<p>of the sorts of cognitive effects that it can create.</p>
<p>I personally would not want to be in that state</p>
<p>for sake of studying or learning</p>
<p>or for doing this podcast, for instance.</p>
<p>And I can honestly say that today,</p>
<p>all I&rsquo;ve ingested is some coffee</p>
<p>and some yerba mate tea and some water.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not on any of the compounds that I&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>during the course of today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>You might ask why I took half the recommended dose</p>
<p>of armodafinil, and the reason is that I&rsquo;m somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s fairly hypersensitive to medication of any kind.</p>
<p>What you find if you look in the literature</p>
<p>is that about 5% of people</p>
<p>are hyper, hypersensitive to medication.</p>
<p>They require far lower doses of any medication</p>
<p>than other people in order to experience the same effects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody that I think is sort of modest, hyper,</p>
<p>if that sort of oxymoronic statement,</p>
<p>but a modest hypersensitivity to medication.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve almost always been able to get by</p>
<p>on taking less of whatever was prescribed for me</p>
<p>and feel just fine, or in this case,</p>
<p>to feel like it was still too much.</p>
<p>It turned out that the right dose of armodafinil for me</p>
<p>was zero milligrams.</p>
<p>Now, you may notice that I haven&rsquo;t talked much</p>
<p>about acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that at the neuron to muscle connections,</p>
<p>the so-called neuromuscular junctions,</p>
<p>is involved in generating muscular contractions</p>
<p>of all kinds for all movements.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is also released from two sites in the brain.</p>
<p>So a little bit of nomenclature here.</p>
<p>Again, feel free to ignore the nomenclature,</p>
<p>but there is a collection of neurons in your brainstem</p>
<p>that send projections forward,</p>
<p>kind of like a sprinkler system that&rsquo;s very diffuse</p>
<p>to release acetylcholine.</p>
<p>And those neurons reside in an area or a structure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the pedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a separate collection of neurons</p>
<p>in the basal forebrain</p>
<p>called unimaginatively nucleus basalis,</p>
<p>the nucleus at the base.</p>
<p>And they also hose the brain with acetylcholine,</p>
<p>but in a much more specific way.</p>
<p>So one is sort of like a sprinkler system,</p>
<p>and the other one is more like a fire hose</p>
<p>to a particular location.</p>
<p>And those two sources of acetylcholine</p>
<p>collaborate to activate particular locations in the brain</p>
<p>and really bring about a tremendous degree of focus</p>
<p>to whatever is happening at those particular synapses.</p>
<p>So it could be a focus on visual information</p>
<p>or auditory information.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening closely to what I&rsquo;m saying right now,</p>
<p>or you just heard closely,</p>
<p>step out from the rest of my sentence.</p>
<p>No doubt there was acetylcholine released at the sites</p>
<p>in your brain where the neurons</p>
<p>that represent your recognition of the word closely</p>
<p>occurred, okay?</p>
<p>So now you have an example and you have an understanding</p>
<p>and hopefully a picture in your mind</p>
<p>of how all this is working.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly then,</p>
<p>drugs that increase cholinergic</p>
<p>or acetylcholine transmission</p>
<p>will increase focus and cognition.</p>
<p>One such compound is so-called alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>which is a form of choline</p>
<p>and increases acetylcholine transmission.</p>
<p>Dosages as high as 1200 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>which is a very high dosage spread out.</p>
<p>Typically it&rsquo;s 300 or 400 milligrams spread out</p>
<p>throughout the day,</p>
<p>have been shown to offset some of the effects</p>
<p>of age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>improve cognitive functioning.</p>
<p>People that don&rsquo;t have age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very high dose.</p>
<p>Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study</p>
<p>or to enhance learning of any kind,</p>
<p>they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligrams.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more typical.</p>
<p>Again, you have to check with your doctor.</p>
<p>You have to decide if the safety margins</p>
<p>are appropriate for you.</p>
<p>Obviously you&rsquo;ll want to check that out,</p>
<p>but alpha-GPC is effective in creating more focus</p>
<p>by way of this cholinergic system.</p>
<p>It stimulates acetylcholine release</p>
<p>from both of those locations,</p>
<p>the PPN in the back of the brain</p>
<p>and nucleus basalis in the front of the brain.</p>
<p>There are two other over-the-counter compounds</p>
<p>that are in active use out there for treatment of ADHD</p>
<p>and in use for simply trying to improve focus.</p>
<p>And the first one is L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amino acid that acts as a precursor</p>
<p>to the neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>And now knowing everything you know about dopamine attention</p>
<p>and the circuits involved,</p>
<p>it should come as no surprise as to why people</p>
<p>are exploring the use of L-tyrosine for that purpose.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine does lead to increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>They are fairly long-lived</p>
<p>and L-tyrosine can improve one&rsquo;s ability to focus.</p>
<p>However, the dosaging can be very tricky to dial in.</p>
<p>Sometimes it makes people feel too euphoric</p>
<p>or too jittery or too alert</p>
<p>that they are then unable to focus well.</p>
<p>So the dosage ranges are huge.</p>
<p>You see evidence for 100 milligrams</p>
<p>all the way up to 1200 milligrams.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that really should be approached</p>
<p>with caution, especially for people</p>
<p>that have any kind of underlying psychiatric</p>
<p>or mood disorder, because dysregulation</p>
<p>of the dopamine system is central to many</p>
<p>of the mood disorders such as depression,</p>
<p>but also especially mania, mania bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>schizophrenia, things of that sort.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that really should be approached</p>
<p>with caution.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in exploring what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>and even some studies online that were done</p>
<p>either animal studies or human studies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that L-tyrosine is being explored</p>
<p>for that purpose, as is PEA and phenolethylamine,</p>
<p>which is essentially PEA, but some related compounds.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole class of dopaminergic</p>
<p>or dopamine stimulating supplements that people are using</p>
<p>to try and get their dopamine levels up.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s kind of a fine line</p>
<p>between too little, enough, and too much.</p>
<p>If you want to get the literature on those two compounds,</p>
<p>there, I will refer you to this great website</p>
<p>at examine.com, just as it sounds,</p>
<p>and you can put in L-tyrosine or PEA,</p>
<p>and you can get the details on that.</p>
<p>But I highly recommend also going to their section</p>
<p>on ADHD to see how those particular compounds</p>
<p>relate specifically to ADHD and cognitive focus.</p>
<p>And last but not least,</p>
<p>in terms of these different compounds,</p>
<p>I do want to mention the racetams.</p>
<p>These are somewhat esoteric,</p>
<p>and probably most of you haven&rsquo;t heard about them,</p>
<p>but some of you probably know a lot about them,</p>
<p>and they are becoming more popular.</p>
<p>They go by names like Nupept and things of that sort.</p>
<p>The racetams are illegal in certain countries.</p>
<p>They are gray market in other countries,</p>
<p>and they are sold over the counter</p>
<p>in this country, in the US.</p>
<p>So they have different margins for safety.</p>
<p>You definitely need to consult your doctor,</p>
<p>especially if you have ADHD.</p>
<p>But Nupept has been shown,</p>
<p>when taken at 10 milligrams twice daily,</p>
<p>can be more effective than some of the other racetams.</p>
<p>What is Nupept?</p>
<p>Nupept taps into the cholinergic system,</p>
<p>the acetylcholine system,</p>
<p>in ways very similar to alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>but seems to have a slightly higher affinity</p>
<p>for some of the receptors involved</p>
<p>and can lead to those heightened states</p>
<p>of cognitive capacity.</p>
<p>And there are these studies,</p>
<p>one in particular,</p>
<p>comparative studies of Nupept and racetam</p>
<p>and the treatment of patients</p>
<p>with mild cognitive disorders</p>
<p>and brain disease of vascular and traumatic origin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mouthful.</p>
<p>What this study basically points to</p>
<p>is the fact that people who are experiencing</p>
<p>some degree of inability to focus</p>
<p>due to prior concussion or some vascular event,</p>
<p>a stroke or ischemia of any kind,</p>
<p>because neurons need blood</p>
<p>when the blood supply is cut off to neurons</p>
<p>or when there&rsquo;s a bleed in the brain.</p>
<p>Subsequent to that,</p>
<p>often there are challenges in maintaining focus.</p>
<p>This is very common for people that have done sports</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of running into each other</p>
<p>with your head, like rugby, football, hockey, and so forth,</p>
<p>but also people who have experienced head blows</p>
<p>or often overlooked is the fact</p>
<p>that most traumatic head injury</p>
<p>is not actually from sports, even football.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from things like construction work,</p>
<p>from high-impact work of that kind.</p>
<p>So there does seem to be some efficacy</p>
<p>of Nupept and paracetam and things like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an emerging area.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned in the US,</p>
<p>these things are sold over the counter.</p>
<p>Again, you have to figure out if it&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>but they are beginning to show some promise.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m intrigued by them because of the way</p>
<p>that they tap into the cholinergic system,</p>
<p>which is both directly involved in focus</p>
<p>and the ability to focus,</p>
<p>but is also important for things related</p>
<p>to age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p>So a decline in cholinergic transmission</p>
<p>or acetylcholine as we call it in the brain</p>
<p>is one of the things associated with cognitive decline.</p>
<p>And it does seem that increasing cholinergic transmission</p>
<p>can offset some of that cognitive decline</p>
<p>and perhaps even more so in conditions</p>
<p>such as vascular damage or concussion to the brain.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in atypical treatments for ADHD,</p>
<p>compounds to improve focus and related themes,</p>
<p>and you like reading about this stuff,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an excellent review article</p>
<p>that I can refer you to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by Ahn et al., A-H-N.</p>
<p>It was published in 2016.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit behind the times,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s surprisingly comprehensive given that,</p>
<p>which lines up all the various drugs that I&rsquo;ve discussed,</p>
<p>racetams and Adderall and Ritalin</p>
<p>and various forms of dopaminergic agents</p>
<p>and cholinergic agents,</p>
<p>spells out whether or not they are sold over the counter</p>
<p>by prescription and really lines them up</p>
<p>and all their effects, their drawbacks, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll refer you to that study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available in its full length form online for free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Ahn et al.</p>
<p>The journal is Neuroplasticity, Neuroplasticity 2016.</p>
<p>Should be very easy to find if you put those keywords in.</p>
<p>And while it is a review, it is a very comprehensive review.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re really into this stuff</p>
<p>and you also want to learn a thing or two</p>
<p>about how these things interact with neurofeedback, et cetera,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some information in there as well.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve already covered a lot of information,</p>
<p>but there is one more category of technology</p>
<p>for the treatment of ADHD</p>
<p>and for enhancement of focus in anyone</p>
<p>that I would like to emphasize.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation, also called TMS,</p>
<p>is achieving increasing popularity nowadays</p>
<p>for the treatment of all sorts of neurologic conditions</p>
<p>and psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>It is a non-invasive tool.</p>
<p>It involves taking a coil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a device with a coil</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s placed over particular locations in the brain</p>
<p>and then sends magnetic stimulation into the brain.</p>
<p>It can actually pass through the skull</p>
<p>without having to drill through the skull.</p>
<p>And nowadays can be used to both lower the amount</p>
<p>of activity or increase the amount of activity</p>
<p>in specific brain areas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spatial precision is not remarkable.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not of use,</p>
<p>but it is not a super fine grain tool, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a cannon, but it&rsquo;s also not a needle.</p>
<p>It is somewhere in between.</p>
<p>It can direct the activity of particular brain regions</p>
<p>at particular depths.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned,</p>
<p>it can increase or decrease that activity.</p>
<p>So for instance, I&rsquo;ve had a TMS coil placed on my head,</p>
<p>not for therapeutic purposes,</p>
<p>even it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you,</p>
<p>but rather just for, well, I&rsquo;m a neuroscientist</p>
<p>and I worked in a lab with one</p>
<p>for entertainment exploratory purposes.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t do this at home.</p>
<p>It was placed over my motor cortex,</p>
<p>which generates voluntary action.</p>
<p>And it was a coil that at that time</p>
<p>could only inhibit neurons.</p>
<p>And so what I was doing is I was moving objects around</p>
<p>on a table, just like I am now.</p>
<p>It was actually a pencil, not a pen.</p>
<p>And I was tapping the pencil</p>
<p>and then the TMS coil was turned on.</p>
<p>And for the life of me, I could not move that pencil, okay?</p>
<p>Because it was inhibiting my upper motor neurons</p>
<p>in the portion of my cortex</p>
<p>that controls voluntary activity.</p>
<p>As soon as the coil was turned off,</p>
<p>I could return to tapping the pencil again.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s possible to stimulate motor cortex</p>
<p>or any area of the brain with some degree of precision</p>
<p>that could create the impulse to move</p>
<p>without actually making the decision to move.</p>
<p>So you can literally engage certain neural circuits</p>
<p>and therefore behaviors and certain thought</p>
<p>and emotional patterns</p>
<p>by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>
<p>This has far reaching and vast implications</p>
<p>as you can probably imagine.</p>
<p>In discussing ADHD with a colleague that uses TMS,</p>
<p>what they are doing is they are taking the TMS coil</p>
<p>to children and adults that have ADHD.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re using it to stimulate the portions</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>that engage task-directed focused states.</p>
<p>So rather than using a drug that generally increases dopamine</p>
<p>and some of the other chemicals involved,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using directed TMS stimulation of these circuits.</p>
<p>And fortunately, I was quite relieved to hear this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re combining that with a focused learning task.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re literally teaching the brain to learn</p>
<p>in a non-invasive way, no drug at all.</p>
<p>And right now there are experiments,</p>
<p>clinical trials going on comparing TMS of this sort</p>
<p>to the drug treatments of the sort that we described earlier</p>
<p>that engage these circuits through pharmacologic mechanisms.</p>
<p>So very exciting times for TMS,</p>
<p>very exciting times for pharmacology related to ADHD</p>
<p>and for enhancing focus in general.</p>
<p>And when I say very exciting times,</p>
<p>I mean, no drug is perfect,</p>
<p>but the constellation of drugs that&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>is getting much larger.</p>
<p>But because they tap into different aspects</p>
<p>of their circuitry, I do think that we are well on our way</p>
<p>to identifying the ideal combinations of drug treatments,</p>
<p>technological treatments, and behavioral paradigms</p>
<p>for increasing focus in both children and adults with ADHD.</p>
<p>And as a final, final point,</p>
<p>I also want to mention something about technologies</p>
<p>that are making it harder for all of us to focus</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not we have preexisting ADHD</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>You can probably guess where this is going.</p>
<p>Everybody nowadays seems to have a smartphone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are a few individuals out there</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have a smartphone.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, most people have them.</p>
<p>Most kids want one as soon as they can get them.</p>
<p>And they are small.</p>
<p>They grab our attention entirely,</p>
<p>but within that small box of attention,</p>
<p>there are millions of attentional windows scrolling by.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So just because it&rsquo;s one device that we look at</p>
<p>does not mean that we are focused.</p>
<p>We are focused on our phone,</p>
<p>but because of the way in which context switches up so fast</p>
<p>within the phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thought that the brain is struggling now</p>
<p>to leave that rapid turnover of context, right?</p>
<p>Many, many shows, many, many Instagram pages,</p>
<p>many, many Twitter feeds, many, many websites.</p>
<p>Basically the whole world, at least in virtual format,</p>
<p>is available within that small box.</p>
<p>Unlike any other technology humans</p>
<p>have ever dealt with before.</p>
<p>Even though there are trillions,</p>
<p>infinite number of bits of information</p>
<p>in the actual physical world,</p>
<p>your attentional window, that aperture of constriction</p>
<p>and dilating that visual window</p>
<p>is the way in which you cope</p>
<p>with all that overwhelming information typically.</p>
<p>Well, within the phone,</p>
<p>your visual aperture is set to a given width.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about this big.</p>
<p>Typically the phone seemed to be getting bigger,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, it&rsquo;s about that big.</p>
<p>And within there,</p>
<p>your attentional window is grabbing</p>
<p>a near infinite number of bits of information,</p>
<p>colors, movies.</p>
<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words,</p>
<p>a movie is worth a billion pictures.</p>
<p>The brain loves visual motion.</p>
<p>And so the question is,</p>
<p>does that sort of interaction on a regular basis</p>
<p>lead to deficits in the types of attention</p>
<p>that we need in order to perform well</p>
<p>in work and school relationships, et cetera?</p>
<p>And the short answer is, yes, it does appear so.</p>
<p>We are inducing a sort of ADHD.</p>
<p>And while the studies on this are ongoing</p>
<p>because prominent use of smartphones</p>
<p>really took off right around 2010,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re only in 2021,</p>
<p>longstanding studies take time,</p>
<p>which is essentially to say the same thing as longstanding.</p>
<p>There are some studies,</p>
<p>and one in particular that I&rsquo;d like to highlight.</p>
<p>One was actually carried out pretty early in 2014.</p>
<p>This is a study that explored smartphone use,</p>
<p>at the time they called it mobile phone use,</p>
<p>but smartphone use,</p>
<p>and inattention, difficulties in attending</p>
<p>in 7,102 adolescents.</p>
<p>This is a huge study,</p>
<p>a population-based cross-sectional study.</p>
<p>And you will be probably surprised and somewhat dismayed</p>
<p>to hear that in order to avoid</p>
<p>this decrease in attentional capacity,</p>
<p>adolescents needed to use their smartphone</p>
<p>for less than 60 minutes per day</p>
<p>in order to stay focused and centered on their other tasks.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they started to really run</p>
<p>into significant issues.</p>
<p>So 60 minutes is not much.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that most young people</p>
<p>are using their phone more than 60 minutes per day.</p>
<p>I know I am.</p>
<p>I think for adults, the number is probably higher,</p>
<p>meaning if you&rsquo;re an adult,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just extrapolate from what I read in this study.</p>
<p>It seems that probably two hours a day on the phone</p>
<p>would be the upper limit</p>
<p>beyond which you would probably experience</p>
<p>pretty severe attentional deficits.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Cal Newport,</p>
<p>who wrote the book, Deep Work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also written the excellent book,</p>
<p>A World Without Email.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met him, but I&rsquo;m a huge admirer of his work.</p>
<p>And I will paraphrase something</p>
<p>that he said far more eloquently than I ever could,</p>
<p>which is that the brain does not do well</p>
<p>with constant context switching,</p>
<p>meaning it can do it,</p>
<p>but it diminishes our capacity</p>
<p>to do meaningful work of any other kind.</p>
<p>And so Cal, as I understand, is very,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a computer science professor at Georgetown, by the way,</p>
<p>is very structured and very disciplined</p>
<p>in his avoidance of cell phone use.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all striving to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to tell you what to do,</p>
<p>but I think whether or not you have ADHD or not,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an adolescent,</p>
<p>limiting your smartphone use to 60 minutes per day or less,</p>
<p>and if you are an adult to two hours per day or less</p>
<p>is going to be among the very best ways to maintain,</p>
<p>just to maintain your ability to focus</p>
<p>at whatever level you can now.</p>
<p>And as I always say,</p>
<p>most of the things that we get recognized for in life,</p>
<p>success in life, in every endeavor,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s school, relationships, sport,</p>
<p>creative works of any kind</p>
<p>are always proportional to the amount of focus</p>
<p>that we can bring that activity.</p>
<p>It is important to rest, of course, to get proper sleep,</p>
<p>but I stand behind that statement.</p>
<p>And I leave you with that study</p>
<p>about attention and cell phones</p>
<p>and how cell phones are indeed eroding</p>
<p>our attentional capacities.</p>
<p>So I realized I covered a lot of information about ADHD</p>
<p>and the biology of focus and how to get better at focusing.</p>
<p>We talked about the behavioral</p>
<p>and psychological phenotypes of ADHD.</p>
<p>We talked about the underlying neural circuitry.</p>
<p>We also talked about the neurochemistry</p>
<p>and we talked about the various prescription drug treatments</p>
<p>that are aimed at that neurochemistry</p>
<p>and aimed at increasing focus in children</p>
<p>and adults with ADHD.</p>
<p>We also talked about over-the-counter compounds,</p>
<p>the role of particular types of diets and elimination diets.</p>
<p>And we talked about interactions</p>
<p>between these various features</p>
<p>in dictating outcomes for ADHD</p>
<p>and enhancing focus in general.</p>
<p>We also talked a little bit about</p>
<p>emerging neurotechnologies</p>
<p>and how certain technologies like the smartphone</p>
<p>are no doubt hindering our ability to focus</p>
<p>and put us at greater risk of developing ADHD at all ages.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge the irony</p>
<p>and somewhat the contradiction</p>
<p>of doing a two-hour plus episode on ADHD,</p>
<p>if indeed people who are watching this</p>
<p>have challenges with attention.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that this podcast,</p>
<p>like all of our podcast episodes,</p>
<p>are timestamped for a specific reason.</p>
<p>They are designed to be digested</p>
<p>in whatever batch one chooses, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to watch or listen</p>
<p>to the entire thing all at once.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;ve gotten to this point in the podcast,</p>
<p>I want to thank you.</p>
<p>I do hope that you&rsquo;ve learned a lot about this condition.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve also learned a lot</p>
<p>about your own capacity to focus</p>
<p>and things that you can do to enhance your focus.</p>
<p>We even talked about a tool</p>
<p>that takes just one 17-minute session</p>
<p>to enhance your ability to focus thereafter,</p>
<p>presumably forever.</p>

<p>at the beginning of the podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrific way to support us.</p>
<p>And for those of you that would like to support research</p>
<p>on stress, neurobiology, and human performance,</p>
<p>you can go to hubermanlab.stanford.edu,</p>
<p>and there you can make a tax-deductible donation</p>
<p>for research on neurobiology in my laboratory.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality,</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>And finally, I want to thank you for your time</p>
<p>and your attention, and as always,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
