the real cool benefit of rebound exercise nasa has done quite a bit of research on rebounding and i&amp;rsquo;m going to put some links down below but it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite fascinating that they&amp;rsquo;re doing research on rebounding because what they found is when you&amp;rsquo;re in space without gravity you start losing your bone tissue and your muscle tissue so they&amp;rsquo;re trying to come up with ways to counter that but rebounding exercise is jumping on a trampoline now if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do rebounding and you&amp;rsquo;re a little bit older i would always recommend doing it with some type of support structure so you can hold yourself because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be jumping on this trampoline and jumping off and you know falling or injuring yourself but there&amp;rsquo;s quite a few benefits to rebounding exercise it&amp;rsquo;s convenient it improves your mobility your posture your balance your gait it improves the fear of falling it can even reduce your risk of osteoporosis but i think the biggest benefit has to do with this right here stimulating the lymphatic system so let me make this very very simple what is the lymphatic system you have the blood vessels throughout the body the vascular system right and they go from large vessels to smaller vessels to eventually to tiny little blood vessels called capillaries in the tissue now in that same tissue next to the capillaries you have the beginning of the lymphatic system some of the plasma in the blood leaks out into the tissues and it goes right into the lymphatic system so the fluid in the lymphatic system called lymph is made up of plasma and several other things which i don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into at this point and then the lymph system travels through the body and then eventually dumps back into the vascular system the venous part of the vascular system so it&amp;rsquo;s this whole continual loop so one function of your lymphatic system is to act as a backup for your vascular system so if there&amp;rsquo;s too much blood for example the lymph system can handle that overflow but the thing you need to know about your lymphatic system is it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a pump like the vascular system does so it needs movement or else there&amp;rsquo;s no pump the lymph becomes stagnant or congested the two big purposes of the lymphatic system are number one to support the immune system because you have all these lymph nodes and you have all these t cells and b cells that help to capture and consolidate pathogens that have invaded the system and deal with them kill them and just disregard them as well as to help recycle old red blood cells and damage red blood cells and recycle them that&amp;rsquo;s what the spleen does the spleen is a very large lymphatic node and the other function of the lymphatic system that a lot of people are unaware of is that it helps to transport fat to the body so when you eat dietary fat and it goes into your intestines it goes directly into the lymphatic system not into your blood vessels fat in water do not mix so the body has to package this fat in a way that can be transported easily through the system so one way that it packages the fat is through something called a kylo micron the word kylo means juice and microns mean small particles so a kylomicron is very simply the grocery bag that carries the fat to the various parts of the body for both energy and as a precursor or material to build hormones especially adrenal hormones to counter stress all of the hormones in the gonads the testosterone estrogen progesterone are made from fat and cholesterol the cellular membranes need fat the nervous system the brain needs fat bile comes from cholesterol vitamin d comes from cholesterol so in other words this fat is very very important to supporting body tissue as well as giving you energy and one very common thing that i hear over and over and over when people start doing rebounding exercise is their energy goes straight up and vertical i think it has a lot to do with the fat being more activated in the lymphatic system so the biggest benefit of rebounding exercise has to do with supporting the immune system and to help the transportation of fat through the chylomicrons now as a little side note since we&amp;rsquo;re on the topic of chylomicrons i want to just help you understand this a little bit better when you get a cholesterol test you usually get your total cholesterol you get ldl hdl right now let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at this a little bit deeper when someone talks about ldl or hdl they&amp;rsquo;re not talking about cholesterol they&amp;rsquo;re talking about the carrier bag okay the the grocery bag that&amp;rsquo;s carrying the fat through the body and so we have different densities of these bags different sizes and different densities so when we&amp;rsquo;re going from a kylo micron that&amp;rsquo;s the largest bag it&amp;rsquo;s also called the ultra low density lipoprotein and they&amp;rsquo;re calling it ultra low because it&amp;rsquo;s basically filled with fat and very little protein and if we look at the relationship between this all the way down to hdl you can see this is a lot smaller this is the most dense this is the least dense okay so this has the least amount of fat the most protein this has the most amount of fat and the least amount of protein so when we go this direction more dense more protein less lipids why because these are carrier bags that are going to be dumping off fat into various parts of your body so we go from a cola micron which is an ultra low dense lipoprotein to a vldl that means very low density lipoprotein and then there&amp;rsquo;s a little extra step right here called intermediate density lipoprotein and eventually we get to the low density lipoprotein and most people think this is the bad one but there&amp;rsquo;s actually two types of ldl there&amp;rsquo;s one that&amp;rsquo;s more pathogenic and one that is non-pathogenic if you&amp;rsquo;re interested i put some links down below about that and then we get the hdl which is a carrier bag that takes the cholesterol from the body tissue and brings it back into the liver these other ones are going to the liver anyway sorry i got sidetracked there for a minute the main thing you need to know about rebounding is it&amp;rsquo;s really good for your lymphatic system especially if you have lymphedema all right thanks for watching before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some

rebound exercise nasa has done quite a bit  </p><p>of research on rebounding and i&rsquo;m going to 
put some links down below but it&rsquo;s actually  </p><p>quite fascinating that they&rsquo;re doing research 
on rebounding because what they found is when  </p><p>you&rsquo;re in space without gravity you start losing 
your bone tissue and your muscle tissue so they&rsquo;re  </p><p>trying to come up with ways to counter that but 
rebounding exercise is jumping on a trampoline  </p><p>now if you&rsquo;re going to do rebounding and you&rsquo;re 
a little bit older i would always recommend  </p><p>doing it with some type of support structure so 
you can hold yourself because you don&rsquo;t want to  </p><p>be jumping on this trampoline and jumping off and 
you know falling or injuring yourself but there&rsquo;s  </p><p>quite a few benefits to rebounding exercise it&rsquo;s 
convenient it improves your mobility your posture  </p><p>your balance your gait it improves the fear 
of falling it can even reduce your risk of  </p><p>osteoporosis but i think the biggest benefit 
has to do with this right here stimulating the  </p><p>lymphatic system so let me make this very 
very simple what is the lymphatic system  </p><p>you have the blood vessels throughout 
the body the vascular system right  </p><p>and they go from large vessels to smaller vessels 
to eventually to tiny little blood vessels called  </p><p>capillaries in the tissue now in that same 
tissue next to the capillaries you have the  </p><p>beginning of the lymphatic system some of the 
plasma in the blood leaks out into the tissues  </p><p>and it goes right into the lymphatic system so 
the fluid in the lymphatic system called lymph  </p><p>is made up of plasma and several other things 
which i don&rsquo;t want to get into at this point  </p><p>and then the lymph system travels through 
the body and then eventually dumps back  </p><p>into the vascular system the venous part 
of the vascular system so it&rsquo;s this whole  </p><p>continual loop so one function of your lymphatic 
system is to act as a backup for your vascular  </p><p>system so if there&rsquo;s too much blood for example 
the lymph system can handle that overflow  </p><p>but the thing you need to know about your 
lymphatic system is it doesn&rsquo;t have a pump  </p><p>like the vascular system does so it needs movement 
or else there&rsquo;s no pump the lymph becomes stagnant  </p><p>or congested the two big purposes of the lymphatic 
system are number one to support the immune system  </p><p>because you have all these lymph nodes and you 
have all these t cells and b cells that help to  </p><p>capture and consolidate pathogens that have 
invaded the system and deal with them kill them  </p><p>and just disregard them as well as to help recycle 
old red blood cells and damage red blood cells and  </p><p>recycle them that&rsquo;s what the spleen does the 
spleen is a very large lymphatic node and the  </p><p>other function of the lymphatic system that a 
lot of people are unaware of is that it helps  </p><p>to transport fat to the body so when you eat 
dietary fat and it goes into your intestines  </p><p>it goes directly into the lymphatic system not 
into your blood vessels fat in water do not  </p><p>mix so the body has to package this fat in a way 
that can be transported easily through the system  </p><p>so one way that it packages the fat is through 
something called a kylo micron the word kylo means  </p><p>juice and microns mean small particles 
so a kylomicron is very simply  </p><p>the grocery bag that carries the fat to the 
various parts of the body for both energy and  </p><p>as a precursor or material to build hormones 
especially adrenal hormones to counter stress  </p><p>all of the hormones in the gonads the 
testosterone estrogen progesterone are made from  </p><p>fat and cholesterol the cellular membranes 
need fat the nervous system the brain  </p><p>needs fat bile comes from cholesterol vitamin d 
comes from cholesterol so in other words this fat  </p><p>is very very important to supporting body tissue 
as well as giving you energy and one very common  </p><p>thing that i hear over and over and over when 
people start doing rebounding exercise is their  </p><p>energy goes straight up and vertical i think it 
has a lot to do with the fat being more activated  </p><p>in the lymphatic system so the biggest benefit of 
rebounding exercise has to do with supporting the  </p><p>immune system and to help the transportation of 
fat through the chylomicrons now as a little side  </p><p>note since we&rsquo;re on the topic of chylomicrons i 
want to just help you understand this a little  </p><p>bit better when you get a cholesterol test you 
usually get your total cholesterol you get ldl  </p><p>hdl right now let&rsquo;s take a look at this a little 
bit deeper when someone talks about ldl or hdl  </p><p>they&rsquo;re not talking about cholesterol they&rsquo;re 
talking about the carrier bag okay the the  </p><p>grocery bag that&rsquo;s carrying the fat through the 
body and so we have different densities of these  </p><p>bags different sizes and different densities so 
when we&rsquo;re going from a kylo micron that&rsquo;s the  </p><p>largest bag it&rsquo;s also called the ultra low density 
lipoprotein and they&rsquo;re calling it ultra low  </p><p>because it&rsquo;s basically filled with fat and very 
little protein and if we look at the relationship  </p><p>between this all the way down to hdl you can 
see this is a lot smaller this is the most dense  </p><p>this is the least dense okay so this has the 
least amount of fat the most protein this has  </p><p>the most amount of fat and the least amount of 
protein so when we go this direction more dense  </p><p>more protein less lipids why because these are 
carrier bags that are going to be dumping off  </p><p>fat into various parts of your body so we 
go from a cola micron which is an ultra low  </p><p>dense lipoprotein to a vldl that means very 
low density lipoprotein and then there&rsquo;s a  </p><p>little extra step right here called intermediate 
density lipoprotein and eventually we get to the  </p><p>low density lipoprotein and most people think this 
is the bad one but there&rsquo;s actually two types of  </p><p>ldl there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s more pathogenic and one 
that is non-pathogenic if you&rsquo;re interested  </p><p>i put some links down below about that and 
then we get the hdl which is a carrier bag  </p><p>that takes the cholesterol from the body tissue 
and brings it back into the liver these other  </p><p>ones are going to the liver anyway sorry i got 
sidetracked there for a minute the main thing  </p><p>you need to know about rebounding is it&rsquo;s really 
good for your lymphatic system especially if you  </p><p>have lymphedema all right thanks for watching 
before you go if you have a question about a  </p><p>product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to 
know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and  </p><p>you need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth 
i have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p><p>this is just for the people in the us hopefully in 
the future we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
