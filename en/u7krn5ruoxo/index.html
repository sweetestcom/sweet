<p>welcome back everyone anything that i</p>
<p>say is definitely not meant to diagnose</p>
<p>you just to give you</p>
<p>general information check with your</p>
<p>doctor before implementing any of these</p>
<p>things that we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;re they may oppose</p>
<p>conventional medical care</p>
<p>all right steve well can you hear me i</p>
<p>sure can and audience thanks for your uh</p>
<p>patience with us our show blew up on the</p>
<p>launch pad last week but we were all</p>
<p>bigger and better and uh we were</p>
<p>unfortunately not able to answer uh</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>julian was it</p>
<p>is it julia&rsquo;s so let me go through that</p>
<p>steve because um julian had a question i</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t able to answer so we&rsquo;re finally</p>
<p>going to get to his question</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing keto he&rsquo;s consuming a certain</p>
<p>amount of protein and he had a question</p>
<p>about his protein so</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>showed me the formula you need um 0.7</p>
<p>grams of protein</p>
<p>per</p>
<p>pound of body weight okay to come up</p>
<p>with this</p>
<p>his formula to figure out his proteins</p>
<p>which is i think um he just just keeps</p>
<p>having too much protein right so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i i found an error in his math it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s 0.7 grams of protein per</p>
<p>kilogram not per pound body weight</p>
<p>so that changes everything so he weighs</p>
<p>160 pounds</p>
<p>so that means he&rsquo;s 73 kilograms so if we</p>
<p>do the math on that</p>
<p>just 73 kilograms times 0.7 grams of</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>that only comes down to 50.9 grams of</p>
<p>protein he needs instead of the</p>
<p>you know over a hundred</p>
<p>so he was doing he was consuming like a</p>
<p>dozen eggs and</p>
<p>he was consuming um i guess</p>
<p>sardines and additional proteins so so</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>julian what you need to do is um you</p>
<p>only need to have seven</p>
<p>point two eggs per day to get your</p>
<p>amount of protein you need so</p>
<p>you just have to work it out in</p>
<p>kilograms um</p>
<p>so that should answer your question</p>
<p>because if you have too much protein um</p>
<p>and even using eggs which give you the</p>
<p>best quality of protein that means like</p>
<p>half</p>
<p>a little bit over half of that protein</p>
<p>converts to sugar so</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the problem with doing</p>
<p>too much protein</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like eating sugar for sure but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely it&rsquo;s going to be turning</p>
<p>into waste ore</p>
<p>or glucose as energy so</p>
<p>any</p>
<p>way</p>
<p>that would answer your question and</p>
<p>clarify</p>
<p>that challenge that you&rsquo;re running into</p>
<p>wonderful thanks doc and i know julian&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been very patient with us so we</p>
<p>appreciate getting that out to him steve</p>
<p>not me from facebook how much mct oil</p>
<p>should i put in my coffee and will it</p>
<p>break my fast</p>
<p>i would do um a tablespoon a tablespoon</p>
<p>of mct if you do too much you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>diarrhea or loose bowels um but yeah you</p>
<p>can do a tablespoon</p>
<p>if you exercise you know add another</p>
<p>tablespoon it&rsquo;ll give you more energy</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to generate ketones</p>
<p>if you go too much too much mct oil</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to burn that</p>
<p>as your fuel</p>
<p>more than your own body fat and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>increase your weight or maintain your</p>
<p>weight then that&rsquo;s totally fine but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight uh you want</p>
<p>be careful about these extra added fats</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great and anush</p>
<p>from youtube in this case</p>
<p>and this is an off to ask question and i</p>
<p>know what you&rsquo;re going to say do how do</p>
<p>i calculate my daily calorie intake to</p>
<p>lose weight and reverse a fatty liver</p>
<p>anush weighs 157 pounds and is a</p>
<p>four point nine four a feet nine inches</p>
<p>you know i think the best way to answer</p>
<p>that is to go to our website drbird.com</p>
<p>and i just happen to</p>
<p>have a new</p>
<p>keto calculator which you&rsquo;ll you can</p>
<p>fill out and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the drop down menu under uh</p>
<p>ketos ketone keto i think it is and you</p>
<p>just basically take that quiz and it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually get information from you</p>
<p>your age</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>your weight</p>
<p>your height</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>a good idea of how many calories you</p>
<p>really should be consuming based on</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet so it&rsquo;s a keto</p>
<p>calculator it&rsquo;s new i haven&rsquo;t promoted</p>
<p>it because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i wanted to just really make sure all</p>
<p>the bugs are worked out it doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>like there is a lot of bugs but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you want to go there and check it out</p>
<p>definitely check it out because that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you about the calories even though</p>
<p>calories are not um</p>
<p>really as important as just you know</p>
<p>eating and just feeling satisfied</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s wonderful listen we have</p>
<p>coming to us all the way from</p>
<p>centerville iowa a nice guy named uh</p>
<p>adam and he&rsquo;s on with you in the dr</p>
<p>burke show go ahead with your question</p>
<p>adam</p>
<p>okay gotta unmute yourself sir</p>
<p>sorry about that hello dr berg hello i</p>
<p>have uh been doing keto since</p>
<p>thanksgiving</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve lost about</p>
<p>70 pounds intermittent fasting and keto</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>a little frozen up we&rsquo;ll wait for him</p>
<p>hopefully he&rsquo;ll come through</p>
<p>lost about 70 pounds and have been</p>
<p>watching your videos following you and</p>
<p>what you have</p>
<p>i do want to lose about another</p>
<p>20 or 30 pounds but i&rsquo;ve had a couple</p>
<p>issues that have come up</p>
<p>for starters</p>
<p>about the last three three and a half</p>
<p>weeks my weight hasn&rsquo;t dropped</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i have</p>
<p>the more i&rsquo;ve been listening to you the</p>
<p>more i&rsquo;ve understood more on health</p>
<p>than just weight loss and so i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>trying to put priority on that</p>
<p>uh however since i&rsquo;ve started this i</p>
<p>have noticed</p>
<p>that i have times that happened that</p>
<p>happen daily uh where i am dizzy almost</p>
<p>fainty</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>uh and so by the time i eat my daily</p>
<p>meal and i&rsquo;m down to one meal a day by</p>
<p>the time i</p>
<p>dr burke i&rsquo;m going to mute him go ahead</p>
<p>and eat my daily meal i feel like i i</p>
<p>need to just lay down and rest</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>well yeah over</p>
<p>yeah so um</p>
<p>the most likely</p>
<p>okay so um it&rsquo;s not coming through but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna i know i think i know what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to ask</p>
<p>yeah i think um um you have to</p>
<p>i think that you definitely need</p>
<p>electrolytes but it could be you need</p>
<p>more salt um and sea salt um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the key thing with feeling</p>
<p>dizzy and disoriented especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drinking a lot of water and you</p>
<p>start keto because you dump all this</p>
<p>fluid and now we also dump all the</p>
<p>electrolytes so if you&rsquo;re already doing</p>
<p>um sea salt then i would do the</p>
<p>potassium electrolyte drink um and of</p>
<p>course</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to recommend mine but</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing with sea salt they</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>you do that</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>okay of salt</p>
<p>of your</p>
<p>electrolyte potassium okay are you doing</p>
<p>sea salt</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve used sea salt on my food eggs</p>
<p>and uh even a little bit on my salad</p>
<p>okay then then this is really simple i</p>
<p>think i would just um</p>
<p>beef up no pun intended more sea salt</p>
<p>and that will</p>
<p>help you and so there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s also you</p>
<p>can get sea salt tablets i i only</p>
<p>recommend that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re very deficient but i think</p>
<p>you may want to just um with the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder</p>
<p>take about</p>
<p>an eighth of a teaspoon of sea salt</p>
<p>and dissolve that into the electrolyte</p>
<p>powder because it sounds like you need</p>
<p>more sodium if you feel kind of dizzy</p>
<p>and things like that so</p>
<p>do that a few times a day</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s the thing if you actually</p>
<p>take a lot of potassium without that</p>
<p>sodium um that will make your sodium a</p>
<p>little bit</p>
<p>lower</p>
<p>so that so anything with dizziness low</p>
<p>blood pressure um i would go with that</p>
<p>the other thing you want to do realize</p>
<p>is that you might need b1 b1 could also</p>
<p>create that dizziness especially if you</p>
<p>get up and you feel disoriented</p>
<p>and like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called um pots</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really a b1 deficiency</p>
<p>if you feel light-headed especially if</p>
<p>you get up too quickly</p>
<p>those are two things that normally</p>
<p>should fix that problem</p>
<p>um if you still have a problem then we</p>
<p>need to get more information and come on</p>
<p>next week and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>dissect a little bit more but i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would do</p>
<p>sodium and b1</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t forget a little nutrition i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do that a little nutritional yeast there</p>
<p>andy i personally recommend it great</p>
<p>stuff calm you right down sorry we had</p>
<p>trouble with your transmission but i</p>
<p>hope uh dr berg was able to answer your</p>
<p>question and let&rsquo;s go on to</p>
<p>another question often well not tell you</p>
<p>what why don&rsquo;t we talk about who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming to us and from where first of all</p>
<p>we will be having oscar who&rsquo;s in mexico</p>
<p>city with us</p>
<p>we will also have</p>
<p>monica who&rsquo;s coming from slovakia i</p>
<p>think and then you know people all over</p>
<p>the place but in the meantime other</p>
<p>people coming to us are from the uk</p>
<p>canada india france philippines norway</p>
<p>greece israel mexico high mexico bermuda</p>
<p>south africa italy pakistan saudi arabia</p>
<p>sweden egypt cameroon chile</p>
<p>algeria morocco germany japan ghana</p>
<p>taiwan and all across these united</p>
<p>states and uh he already said canada so</p>
<p>welcome everybody thanks for joining the</p>
<p>show</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s move on okay rubia from</p>
<p>youtube i&rsquo;m doing keto and i</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and adding apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar before i break my fast i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still getting</p>
<p>right shoulder pain and gall bladder</p>
<p>discomfort any suggestions</p>
<p>yeah you what you&rsquo;re going to need is</p>
<p>more of a bile salt</p>
<p>a purifier salt the gallbladder formula</p>
<p>and you want to take that</p>
<p>with food and also on the empty stomach</p>
<p>and you may need</p>
<p>to take two an empty stomach twice a day</p>
<p>to kind of open up the bile ducts and to</p>
<p>get more flow through there because that</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar will</p>
<p>increase your production of bile but you</p>
<p>might need just more bile to get you</p>
<p>started</p>
<p>speaking about bile steve you know</p>
<p>normally when i have breakfast</p>
<p>i it&rsquo;s always important</p>
<p>to read the labels i always like to read</p>
<p>labels and i couldn&rsquo;t could you believe</p>
<p>a i mean this has like two grams of fat</p>
<p>incredible but the good thing is it has</p>
<p>no cholesterol at all so i&rsquo;m excited</p>
<p>about that</p>
<p>um but the reason i&rsquo;m just showing you</p>
<p>the label on this is that i found</p>
<p>something that i&rsquo;m gonna i just did a</p>
<p>video this morning if you look at the</p>
<p>back of the label or the side of the</p>
<p>label on some of these products recent</p>
<p>recently you&rsquo;ll see it says contains</p>
<p>bio</p>
<p>now bio-engineered</p>
<p>food ingredients</p>
<p>yum bio-engineered food ingredients</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>an interesting video for people because</p>
<p>uh steve have you ever heard of that</p>
<p>before</p>
<p>uh no i don&rsquo;t believe i have</p>
<p>this is a nicer way of saying it has gmo</p>
<p>foods</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>what there&rsquo;s a lot of loopholes or some</p>
<p>really interesting information about it</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>stay tuned for the video that i&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to release in about two days on</p>
<p>genetically modified because they were</p>
<p>going to just about to</p>
<p>pass a law that</p>
<p>you know more and more states need to</p>
<p>label and be more transparent gmo but</p>
<p>the food manufacturing companies beat</p>
<p>them to the punch and came up with a new</p>
<p>term so now</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t sound like gmo foods it</p>
<p>sounds a little bit better in the and</p>
<p>the little symbol that they&rsquo;ll use is</p>
<p>this beautiful sun the sun with a</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like a little plant with a nice farm</p>
<p>seems really nice so that way you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a really great health</p>
<p>food product</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>well anyway it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>thing start you have to start reading</p>
<p>labels</p>
<p>and really uh</p>
<p>understand what what you&rsquo;re putting in</p>
<p>your mouth</p>
<p>now remember doc tricks are for kids now</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how many people in the</p>
<p>audience are old enough to remember that</p>
<p>slogan but anyway they do put all these</p>
<p>euphemistic things up right to make you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re getting the best stuff but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go with our first quiz question</p>
<p>doc</p>
<p>all right all right which type of food</p>
<p>is missing if you have</p>
<p>dry</p>
<p>lips</p>
<p>dry lips audience dig into that and</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we go to mexico city</p>
<p>and uh go with oscar hang on just a</p>
<p>second oscar unmute yourself and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on with dr berg</p>
<p>there you go</p>
<p>hello hi oscar</p>
<p>how are you great</p>
<p>great well first of all thanks for</p>
<p>everything that you do dr burke and let</p>
<p>me tell you about my situation my</p>
<p>question i have been experiencing now i</p>
<p>think that is restless leg syndrome for</p>
<p>the past three years and it has really</p>
<p>affected the quality of my life and</p>
<p>while living in mexico city with this</p>
<p>syndrome has been challenging because i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t found any doctor that knows</p>
<p>about this condition and i have done</p>
<p>every possible blood test for instance</p>
<p>of my body and every exam that i have</p>
<p>been told and well i haven&rsquo;t found</p>
<p>anything wrong in my body</p>
<p>but the pain continues in my legs and</p>
<p>even one doctor</p>
<p>suggested me to use expect drugs because</p>
<p>they thought that it was something</p>
<p>related to emotions or things like that</p>
<p>and well last december it was when i</p>
<p>found the information about restless</p>
<p>legs and i was like okay that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>symptoms that i&rsquo;ve been feeling now now</p>
<p>it has a name right</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how research about this</p>
<p>syndrome i found your videos</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s it has been a month and a</p>
<p>half that i have been taking four</p>
<p>thousand and seven hundred milligrams of</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>a spoon of magnesium and uh apple</p>
<p>vinegar twice a day</p>
<p>and also it has been a week that i</p>
<p>started taking nutritional genes twice a</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>and well i haven&rsquo;t really felt any</p>
<p>improvement but i still think that this</p>
<p>is a restless leg syndrome due to the</p>
<p>fact that doctors have told me that</p>
<p>there is nothing wrong with my body</p>
<p>and also the pain</p>
<p>feels like almost everything and the</p>
<p>websites share uh several less right and</p>
<p>well my question</p>
<p>is that i am wondering if i am missing</p>
<p>anything</p>
<p>any data or how can i improve condition</p>
<p>as it prevents</p>
<p>new symptoms in my feet when i am</p>
<p>walking is of restless legs or is or if</p>
<p>it is something else so i was wondering</p>
<p>if you can tell me something to to guide</p>
<p>me towards to answers or towards to a</p>
<p>solution sure what what time is it now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in mexico right</p>
<p>yeah in mexico it is 10 24</p>
<p>pm or am</p>
<p>am okay</p>
<p>um yesterday</p>
<p>um what did you eat yesterday what was</p>
<p>the foods that you ate yesterday</p>
<p>yesterday i ate a chicken</p>
<p>chicken i i am now eating a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>i stopped eating i don&rsquo;t know how to say</p>
<p>in english but um</p>
<p>but like sausages and things with with</p>
<p>salt</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>like yesterday i stopped eating things</p>
<p>that have like salt and i&rsquo;m just i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just eating salt but</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>ocean salt i don&rsquo;t know how to say it</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>and well that that&rsquo;s it but and also</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah but i&rsquo;m taking care of of</p>
<p>my</p>
<p>of the food that i am meeting</p>
<p>okay so um recently have you been eating</p>
<p>any carbohydrates like um like any type</p>
<p>of um</p>
<p>carbohydrates that could be like sugars</p>
<p>or or flour products anything like that</p>
<p>yeah i mean carbohydrates</p>
<p>like pasta</p>
<p>pasta and</p>
<p>but rice</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t eat a lot of like sugar</p>
<p>things let&rsquo;s say like every once in a</p>
<p>while i take the the half of a donut</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>but not regularly</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>you drink any soda</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>okay good</p>
<p>uh any alcohol</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>okay good</p>
<p>so this is a really good example of like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>someone has a a symptom and they want a</p>
<p>remedy for it</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to have to do to fix</p>
<p>this is you&rsquo;re going to have to get</p>
<p>on the basic healthy version of the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet that i recommend because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the remedies but the</p>
<p>foundation isn&rsquo;t created enough those</p>
<p>refined carbohydrates in the form of the</p>
<p>rice and the pasta unfortunately deplete</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>of vitamin b1</p>
<p>not to mention potassium so really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the b1 that you need because that</p>
<p>actually helps you get rid of the what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called lactic acid in your legs</p>
<p>um but if you&rsquo;re still doing the carbs</p>
<p>that is going to</p>
<p>kind of negate or or nullify</p>
<p>those supplements so</p>
<p>this is going to be very very simple</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>get my book</p>
<p>start reading on how to do this right</p>
<p>get off those carbs</p>
<p>and give it a little bit of time</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>watch what happens to your less restless</p>
<p>legs cause i used to have that condition</p>
<p>really to the point where i was pounding</p>
<p>my legs at night because it the middle</p>
<p>night i&rsquo;m like i can&rsquo;t sleep and i had</p>
<p>to go run to get this energy out it was</p>
<p>driving crazy um but i was doing a lot</p>
<p>of the breads of pasta cereal crackers</p>
<p>biscuits waffles pancakes right now i</p>
<p>know um</p>
<p>for some people watching it might be</p>
<p>hard to believe that in mexico they do</p>
<p>carbs but they do sometimes like carbs</p>
<p>tortillas and rice and yeah totally</p>
<p>occasionally but</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s gonna have to you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to find an alternative to</p>
<p>that like um</p>
<p>some keto friendly breads</p>
<p>perfect perfect so so the idea is to</p>
<p>that is that&rsquo;s the only thing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing uh and you probably will find</p>
<p>out you don&rsquo;t even need any supplements</p>
<p>because that foundation is um</p>
<p>not not put in there yet</p>
<p>perfect</p>
<p>so the way to go with that</p>
<p>is for books that let&rsquo;s say yeah but in</p>
<p>the meantime if you just go to my</p>
<p>website</p>
<p>right on my website on the front page dr</p>
<p>brewer.com and scroll down there should</p>
<p>be a um what to eat uh document and you</p>
<p>can download that and start today</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i putting that</p>
<p>like a guy perfect</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>okay so thank you thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>and keep you posted okay let me know</p>
<p>go oscar go</p>
<p>uh mexico city all right let&rsquo;s see where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at here uh we&rsquo;re still waiting for</p>
<p>our answer to the first question but in</p>
<p>the meantime allison from facebook</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best way to address</p>
<p>hypothyroidism</p>
<p>most hypothyroidism is hashimoto&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an autoimmune</p>
<p>and the key mineral that you would want</p>
<p>to take is not iodine it&rsquo;s selenium</p>
<p>selenium helps you convert</p>
<p>but also you need to</p>
<p>make sure you have no gluten in the diet</p>
<p>gluten</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>can mimic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>certain things and mimic</p>
<p>the thyroid so your body then will</p>
<p>attack attack it as a</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>a foreign thing</p>
<p>and um it kind of makes things worse</p>
<p>basically um not to mention messes with</p>
<p>your gut</p>
<p>so watch my video on hashimoto&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>several other things you need to do but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really not a thyroid problem it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>secondary problem it&rsquo;s an immune problem</p>
<p>so if you keep treating treating it as a</p>
<p>thyroid and just take</p>
<p>synthroid or t4 or whatever</p>
<p>and wonder why you don&rsquo;t get better</p>
<p>it could be because you&rsquo;re treating</p>
<p>uh the symptom and not the underlying</p>
<p>root problem which really um with</p>
<p>hashimoto&rsquo;s you want better conversion</p>
<p>of that t4 to t3 the active form of the</p>
<p>thyroid hormone i have a lot of videos</p>
<p>on it so um you can go into that and do</p>
<p>a deep dive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific okay doc speaking of the</p>
<p>first quiz question we do have some</p>
<p>answers and it was asking which type of</p>
<p>food is missing</p>
<p>uh if you have dry lips and the audience</p>
<p>suggested 30 percent say omega-3s or</p>
<p>fatty fish 25 say foods with magnesium</p>
<p>20 say vitamin</p>
<p>b vitamin foods 20 safe foods with</p>
<p>magnesium boy a lot of answers five</p>
<p>percent say vitamin c foods and five</p>
<p>percent finally say vitamin a foods</p>
<p>terry thank you for that great breakdown</p>
<p>okay so when you get to dry lips um you</p>
<p>have um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a lack of water it&rsquo;s a lack of</p>
<p>fats and omega-3</p>
<p>a lot of times will help vitamin d will</p>
<p>help and vitamin d is in the fatty foods</p>
<p>so um you want the seafood</p>
<p>with fatty fish would be really good to</p>
<p>help you um</p>
<p>lubricate your lips so um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the essential fatty acid</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acid and sometimes vitamin</p>
<p>d</p>
<p>that will prevent the the cracked lips</p>
<p>or the chapped lips and the dry lips</p>
<p>wonderful okay cod liver oil is another</p>
<p>one too</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s gross though but if you can</p>
<p>get it down i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very good for</p>
<p>you let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go to</p>
<p>uh paul from dallas he&rsquo;s been very</p>
<p>patient with us and even switched</p>
<p>computers so that uh he looks great on</p>
<p>the air paul you&rsquo;re on with dr burr</p>
<p>hi dr burke hi</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see keep this quick uh back in</p>
<p>2018 i had a staph infection i had to go</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>for months of</p>
<p>antibiotics</p>
<p>in the middle of it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i started in</p>
<p>june and in</p>
<p>august</p>
<p>had a physical tsh t4 t3 all normal</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i elevated a liver enzymes</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the cholesterol high of course you know</p>
<p>300 but</p>
<p>for triglycerides were low so i just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do anything about that um</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>november</p>
<p>i noticed</p>
<p>i was gaining like a big potbelly i had</p>
<p>three of the</p>
<p>indicators of liver problems so december</p>
<p>i started</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>uh watching you at berg and cola</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>started doing great do the by</p>
<p>february i was able to do</p>
<p>48 hour fast</p>
<p>after the third one i noticed other</p>
<p>problems like joint pain</p>
<p>uh tennis elbow which i had for years</p>
<p>would never go away and anything i did</p>
<p>would never go away</p>
<p>suddenly was gone</p>
<p>i was able to get out and ride my bike</p>
<p>again</p>
<p>and then um stayed on keto</p>
<p>um kind of rolled in and out after a</p>
<p>year</p>
<p>then by</p>
<p>december</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i went to fur physical and my tsh level</p>
<p>was 15</p>
<p>which is super high</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i was taking quercetin because of the</p>
<p>you know the c19 going around and</p>
<p>i had to travel for work and</p>
<p>was getting exposed</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;d been taken for six months so i</p>
<p>thought maybe that&rsquo;s causing it and i</p>
<p>stopped taking it</p>
<p>um after my my staph infection was on</p>
<p>the face and after the facial creams</p>
<p>like pepperonis</p>
<p>left me with rosacea</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been taking putting creams on my</p>
<p>face a couple of times and we take that</p>
<p>under control</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see it was march another test</p>
<p>uh it dropped down to 11. t4 was one</p>
<p>month later</p>
<p>um down to 11</p>
<p>but the t4 was down to 0.87</p>
<p>now the doc says um</p>
<p>and i told the doc about the</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>the problem with the hype tsh and he</p>
<p>thought maybe i have hashimoto&rsquo;s so he</p>
<p>did the test</p>
<p>and the test i&rsquo;ll show negative for</p>
<p>hashimoto&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>i avoid gluten like to play</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;ve been for</p>
<p>over a year now</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>anyway so he prescribed the synthetic t4</p>
<p>says oh you&rsquo;ve got hypothyroidism</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i was looking and i do take</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>nutritional yeast and i take powdered</p>
<p>nutritional yeast mix that in</p>
<p>and those are high in biotin so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the biotin that may</p>
<p>be causing that or</p>
<p>or is that but i&rsquo;ve cut down on</p>
<p>the uh</p>
<p>nutritional yeast with the high biotin</p>
<p>i got it so um let me just kind of give</p>
<p>you some tips on um</p>
<p>that uh</p>
<p>all that information that i have of</p>
<p>course there&rsquo;s probably a lot more we</p>
<p>could kind of dig but dig into but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing with the thyroid um it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound like you don&rsquo;t look like a</p>
<p>hypothyroid type case you just you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so a lot of these</p>
<p>the the you gotta look at it like an</p>
<p>indicator that there has to be something</p>
<p>else going on um the thing that you told</p>
<p>me is you have a staph infection on the</p>
<p>face and you&rsquo;re using certain creams um</p>
<p>which gives me a little clue on your</p>
<p>microbiome could be off like the gut and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about</p>
<p>the gut</p>
<p>the microbes that also relate to</p>
<p>your microbes on your superficial part</p>
<p>of your face is that one can affect the</p>
<p>other so let&rsquo;s say for example there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lack of</p>
<p>diversity of</p>
<p>gut microbiome well guess what they make</p>
<p>bile salts</p>
<p>they make bile salts and so bile is</p>
<p>really necessary also in the conversion</p>
<p>of your thyroid hormones</p>
<p>so if your</p>
<p>gut is off</p>
<p>the thyroid is going to be off too not</p>
<p>to mention the liver</p>
<p>if the liver was fatty</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>but the liver also makes bile salt so</p>
<p>your microbes make bile salts</p>
<p>your liver makes bile salts and so</p>
<p>either one of those can greatly affect</p>
<p>the thyroid because um 80</p>
<p>of the thyroid hormones are dependent on</p>
<p>the liver</p>
<p>to be converted to the active form of</p>
<p>the thyroid hormone so if there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>type of</p>
<p>blockage or in your bile ducts or</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>a problem with the microbes in your gut</p>
<p>that can affect your thyroid so those</p>
<p>are the two areas i would really look at</p>
<p>i would start with something called</p>
<p>tutka which is going to help the liver</p>
<p>just work a lot better and then let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see what happens to your thyroid once</p>
<p>you do that and then also at the same</p>
<p>time i would do something to</p>
<p>fortify your gut microbes because</p>
<p>um that staph</p>
<p>problem you have</p>
<p>the way to do it you can kill the staff</p>
<p>off but then</p>
<p>those microbes become even stronger so</p>
<p>instead we just fortify you we increase</p>
<p>the microbiome uh systemically and that</p>
<p>way</p>
<p>your microbes don&rsquo;t um</p>
<p>start becoming um</p>
<p>resistant to that very soon i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say i i shouldn&rsquo;t say very soon but</p>
<p>probably in about a month or two we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>micro buy</p>
<p>micro micro uh cream that you can put on</p>
<p>your face that&rsquo;s really good for</p>
<p>balancing out</p>
<p>pathogens</p>
<p>but stay tuned for that but in the</p>
<p>meantime i would do a probiotic and</p>
<p>tutka to help your situation</p>
<p>okay thanks a lot paul we&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>fighting the clock here but i hope that</p>
<p>uh information helped and uh we wish you</p>
<p>all a luck and we hope that you&rsquo;ll call</p>
<p>us back</p>
<p>and let us know how you did all right dr</p>
<p>berg let&rsquo;s get on with another slide</p>
<p>here another quiz and there you have it</p>
<p>all right what</p>
<p>does smoking do to your lips</p>
<p>what are the effects of smoking</p>
<p>how does that affect your lips</p>
<p>well what a great question i am uh 68</p>
<p>and it just shocks me now when i see the</p>
<p>old movies everybody in in the world had</p>
<p>a cigarette dangling out of their lips</p>
<p>when in the 70s or 60s</p>
<p>and i guess everybody had whatever that</p>
<p>does to the lips but fascinating when i</p>
<p>see an old movie now and everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smoking in an elevator in a room it just</p>
<p>seems so foreign to me even though i was</p>
<p>one of them i quit about 30 years ago</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>yeah well i recently did a video on on</p>
<p>diagnosing um</p>
<p>kind of the inside of your body based on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with the lips so this</p>
<p>these questions are based on that video</p>
<p>that apparently some people watch some</p>
<p>people haven&rsquo;t but it&rsquo;s a you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i i think it&rsquo;s important to just</p>
<p>kind of teach people on little different</p>
<p>indicators of looking at the face the</p>
<p>lips the teeth and to see what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on internally so you have more</p>
<p>information on that</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an interesting one tammy from</p>
<p>youtube please</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>please discuss what&rsquo;s behind sulfate</p>
<p>sensitivity</p>
<p>by their wine maker by profession and</p>
<p>this condition is causing havoc for me</p>
<p>i know i know because uh they have to</p>
<p>use that uh</p>
<p>sulfite to as a preservative or things</p>
<p>will turn to vinegar</p>
<p>so um here you are trying to drink</p>
<p>trying to enjoy just wine you know on a</p>
<p>regular basis and darn it you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sometimes because you have this</p>
<p>sulfate or sulfite</p>
<p>sensitivity</p>
<p>well i guess what you have to do is try</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>do the kombucha tea as your new wine</p>
<p>alternative</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>you know the sulphites are also in</p>
<p>other things like dried fruit and</p>
<p>as far as what causes that sensitivity</p>
<p>i think the body is rejecting these uh</p>
<p>sulphites that are added to food</p>
<p>primarily because</p>
<p>they do have a negative effect on our</p>
<p>bodies so our body&rsquo;s rejecting it but</p>
<p>some people have more sensitivities to</p>
<p>other other things but or than other</p>
<p>people but if you want to improve</p>
<p>sensitivities to anything or improve</p>
<p>allergy type symptoms the best way to do</p>
<p>it is through</p>
<p>regular intermittent fasting as well as</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting that will</p>
<p>help your immune system you&rsquo;ll have less</p>
<p>sensitivities</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll be able to drink large</p>
<p>copious amounts of wine</p>
<p>on a nightly basis</p>
<p>wonderful well i tell you what our</p>
<p>audience does not mess around because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already come up with an answer</p>
<p>what does smoking do to the lips and a</p>
<p>hundred percent of their they&rsquo;re rolling</p>
<p>uh putting all the money down on on this</p>
<p>one number say</p>
<p>wrinkled or darkened lips</p>
<p>okay you are correct um but primarily it</p>
<p>turns the lips um on the gray side it</p>
<p>does darken it but it does turn it on</p>
<p>the gray side</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really shutting down the circulation so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to turn blue but it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>turn on the gray side so</p>
<p>you know if you want gray lips just keep</p>
<p>smoking right</p>
<p>well i guess everybody used to have them</p>
<p>debbie from facebook since i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>intermittent fasting i have developed</p>
<p>severe bad breath heard that</p>
<p>and the heel on my right foot has turned</p>
<p>orange are they connected</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>your heels have turned orange uh just</p>
<p>one of them just one of them the right</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>okay um i&rsquo;m not sure about that um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m definitely not sure about that but i</p>
<p>will say that if the breath</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is quite odorous when you do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in some deep ketosis right and so</p>
<p>what you could do to really resolve that</p>
<p>is to take a probiotic and you can take</p>
<p>this on an empty stomach it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>interfere with your fasting</p>
<p>but it will greatly help purify</p>
<p>the gut and i would of course i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>mine because it&rsquo;s a liquid</p>
<p>and uh it&rsquo;s a great way to</p>
<p>counter</p>
<p>um the effect of any bad breath at all</p>
<p>and in fact even if the cause is coming</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>a bacterial issue</p>
<p>or a gut issue or an excessive ketone</p>
<p>issue that probik you take it right</p>
<p>before bed</p>
<p>you can also dilute it and use it for</p>
<p>other things as well you can use it</p>
<p>cleaning mold around your house you can</p>
<p>put in a spray bottle dilute it and</p>
<p>spray it into your septic tank it just</p>
<p>takes the smell out so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great way to um</p>
<p>to handle that we also use it</p>
<p>in our chicken feed when we ferment it</p>
<p>to keep the mold growth down so it kind</p>
<p>of these microbes</p>
<p>they eat the bad stuff and they they get</p>
<p>rid of different smells so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great great thing wonderful okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to our green room and we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>monica coming to us all the way from</p>
<p>slovakia</p>
<p>and uh and that&rsquo;s on the border of the</p>
<p>ukraine so we wish her all the best and</p>
<p>all the safety in the world and you are</p>
<p>on monica with dr berg</p>
<p>thank you hi dr burke um</p>
<p>i started um i started keto diet just</p>
<p>about two weeks ago and i have to say</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m feeling great i&rsquo;ve got lots of</p>
<p>energy so i&rsquo;m really pleased about the</p>
<p>positive effect of it</p>
<p>the reason why i started keto is because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to lose belly fat i&rsquo;m generally</p>
<p>a slim person but i&rsquo;ve got very fat</p>
<p>and the second reason is fibroids</p>
<p>in my uterus</p>
<p>i for years i&rsquo;ve been trying to find a</p>
<p>diet that would address it</p>
<p>no gluten no dairy</p>
<p>very healthy fruit veg eating but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just not</p>
<p>done anything</p>
<p>i have a condition</p>
<p>with my liver i had a liver operation</p>
<p>and i know that i was first high on</p>
<p>estrogen then my estrogen went</p>
<p>down and i was told that potentially the</p>
<p>two adulated so the liver and also</p>
<p>fibroids</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;ve got my methylation is is</p>
<p>not very good so those are just really</p>
<p>the basic facts</p>
<p>and just to help you maybe just to think</p>
<p>about what</p>
<p>and really it&rsquo;s just how do i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re i think you&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>um and of course with that keto plan uh</p>
<p>definitely start doing more and more</p>
<p>intermittent fasting because the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>is good for anything tumors okay so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll actually shrink tumors and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what a fibroid is it&rsquo;s a benign</p>
<p>tumor</p>
<p>the other thing is um the tumor needs a</p>
<p>blood supply and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called uh</p>
<p>angiogenesis and so</p>
<p>there are foods that are</p>
<p>anti-angiogenesis that will shrink this</p>
<p>uh the circulation to these fibroids and</p>
<p>it just so happens to be the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables so the cabbage the</p>
<p>cauliflower the kale you should be</p>
<p>including that in your keto</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>those foods are going to help you</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also anti-estrogenic</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m glad that you you stopped the dairy</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a really key point</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>you know the sugar as well because those</p>
<p>are so those are just you know dairy um</p>
<p>sugar increases insulin so we have</p>
<p>estrogen those are all um</p>
<p>anabolic they make things grow in the</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re going to be on the right track</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re doing i just would add</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables and do more</p>
<p>fasting those two things with</p>
<p>this diet um</p>
<p>are going to be very very helpful for</p>
<p>you so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah and just give it more time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really all you have to do is give it</p>
<p>more time and</p>
<p>it should work really nicely</p>
<p>okay thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thanks for representing</p>
<p>slovakia so well monica and let&rsquo;s keep</p>
<p>it up with the green room here why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go next to juan who is calling in</p>
<p>from florida and let me unmute you juan</p>
<p>here and get you on the air and you are</p>
<p>on with dr berg juan go ahead with your</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>good morning dr berg good morning</p>
<p>uh first of all i&rsquo;ve been doing keto for</p>
<p>since</p>
<p>2019 i dropped</p>
<p>about 20 pounds</p>
<p>feeling more energetic</p>
<p>i started consuming</p>
<p>the apple cider vinegar twice a day</p>
<p>and then a few months back i decided to</p>
<p>buy one of those gadgets to track your</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>uh found out that my deep sleep uh</p>
<p>let me put it this way i don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>enough deep sleep i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>anything between</p>
<p>five minutes to 30 minutes max</p>
<p>somehow i i did some research i found</p>
<p>out that sometimes the apple cider</p>
<p>at night it&rsquo;s not a very good idea it</p>
<p>could</p>
<p>trigger the the lack of deep sleep so</p>
<p>long story short my question is how can</p>
<p>i improve</p>
<p>my deep sleep in doing keto</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that you can do</p>
<p>that i would experiment on</p>
<p>taking</p>
<p>vitamin d right before bed</p>
<p>can greatly help</p>
<p>reset your circadian rhythms</p>
<p>being out in the sun</p>
<p>more during the day</p>
<p>can actually give you more melatonin to</p>
<p>help the deep sleep at night</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re in an office or in a</p>
<p>indoors in the majority of day that is</p>
<p>the problem that&rsquo;s the problem with your</p>
<p>sleep so being outside physical work is</p>
<p>going to be really really huge going for</p>
<p>long walks doing more exercise will help</p>
<p>your deep sleep also before you go to</p>
<p>sleep there&rsquo;s a protocol that</p>
<p>i use to get even more sleep like i was</p>
<p>doing this for a while i&rsquo;m not doing it</p>
<p>now but i was trying to get nine hours</p>
<p>of sleep and it was quite great because</p>
<p>it was like oh my gosh i feel so much</p>
<p>better so i took a vitamin d i took zinc</p>
<p>and i took my uh</p>
<p>sleep aid right before bed</p>
<p>uh boy that just puts you into the a</p>
<p>real nice deep delta wave sleep</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the first part of the sleep is going to</p>
<p>be mainly</p>
<p>the deep sleep uh the delta wave but</p>
<p>then the second half of sleep is going</p>
<p>to be the rem sleep which is</p>
<p>just as important to</p>
<p>rejuvenate mental stress so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>waking up and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not necessarily just rejuvenating</p>
<p>just physical stress but the mental</p>
<p>stress you wake up feeling like i feel</p>
<p>just really ready to go i can face life</p>
<p>and i feel good so these are all things</p>
<p>that i would look at i have done a lot</p>
<p>of videos on sleep because i had</p>
<p>severe problems with sleep and i that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what got me interested in it so um</p>
<p>there was</p>
<p>times in my past where i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>sleep one</p>
<p>second</p>
<p>all night long i&rsquo;m laying there just</p>
<p>literally in a torture chamber just</p>
<p>when am i gonna go to sleep and so that</p>
<p>haunted me for about 12 years until i</p>
<p>figured it out but um</p>
<p>so i have a reality on that so you you</p>
<p>can watch the videos but those are the</p>
<p>things that i would recommend to help</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;m getting as an example last</p>
<p>night i got</p>
<p>39 minutes of deep sleep</p>
<p>but i got two hours and 14 minutes of um</p>
<p>hey you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not terrible um the</p>
<p>other thing that uh</p>
<p>you have to realize those those tests</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t always the most accurate way of</p>
<p>really measuring</p>
<p>uh the delta wave especially since you</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>probes going into your brain</p>
<p>uh they&rsquo;re probably it&rsquo;s probably going</p>
<p>to be evaluating</p>
<p>your motion</p>
<p>of your body</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of an indirect way of</p>
<p>measuring it so</p>
<p>i would go with how you feel when you</p>
<p>wake up too um okay</p>
<p>as the best indicator but also one last</p>
<p>little remedy is that some calcium</p>
<p>before bed also will help</p>
<p>especially if you have cramps at night</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re let&rsquo;s say your head is</p>
<p>tired okay but you can&rsquo;t go to sleep uh</p>
<p>calcium will just like put you out</p>
<p>okay perfect</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>sure thank you so much juan i appreciate</p>
<p>it and let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t get one</p>
<p>other question answered today then we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go back and wrap it up with our guests</p>
<p>in the green room and dr berg uh here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your question</p>
<p>okay so what is the highest quality of</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>you can possibly eat</p>
<p>okay get on it uh audience and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>olivia is still waiting for us and</p>
<p>olivia you are on with dr berg</p>
<p>go ahead with your question please</p>
<p>hello dr byrne hello</p>
<p>my question</p>
<p>some years ago i had these stomach aches</p>
<p>uh very burning stomachaches they were</p>
<p>brief sometimes anyways after that i</p>
<p>went to my doctor and they</p>
<p>diagnosed that i had stones in my</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>not being sure that was the cause of my</p>
<p>stomach pains they took it out</p>
<p>the stomach pains continue</p>
<p>years after they i went back to their uh</p>
<p>gastroenterologist</p>
<p>and they found out that i had a sun in</p>
<p>my bile duct</p>
<p>which they tried four times to take it</p>
<p>out which was very hard at the fourth</p>
<p>try they did take it out</p>
<p>i felt my stomach case disappear however</p>
<p>a few months later they diagnosed me</p>
<p>with acid reflux</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have heartburn i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>those symptoms that most people have</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>i feel that my stomach digests food</p>
<p>very slow</p>
<p>um because i feel it i don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>uncomfortable i don&rsquo;t feel bad however</p>
<p>in the morning i feel the food sometimes</p>
<p>in my throat</p>
<p>and then later on i developed this bad</p>
<p>um flavor in my mouth</p>
<p>and later on dry very dry mouth at night</p>
<p>not during the day and lately dry nose</p>
<p>um my sleep is like has been really bad</p>
<p>um i some nights i don&rsquo;t sleep at all</p>
<p>some nights i sleep maybe six hours some</p>
<p>nights i sleep eight hours</p>
<p>and you were saying your body will tell</p>
<p>you if you have a good night&rsquo;s sleep and</p>
<p>when i sleep at least six hours i feel</p>
<p>great i have a lot of energy i have been</p>
<p>listening to you for the past year i</p>
<p>really like everything that you say and</p>
<p>i have tried some things for</p>
<p>for uh this acid reflux which is flames</p>
<p>the one that bothered me the most in the</p>
<p>back of my throat i feel this drainage</p>
<p>however i don&rsquo;t have a congestion nose i</p>
<p>breathe very well it&rsquo;s just that is very</p>
<p>constantly clearing my throat and having</p>
<p>this dry cough once in a while and i see</p>
<p>that when i eat certain foods</p>
<p>it gets worse</p>
<p>so i heard you saying like radishes with</p>
<p>ginger and lemon i tried that one time i</p>
<p>heard you and i did it and it helped</p>
<p>actually excel and i said oh my gosh his</p>
<p>doctor is god so i really admire you for</p>
<p>a lot of things that you do but this is</p>
<p>bothering me too much and also maybe</p>
<p>related to my stomach problems</p>
<p>dry skin each screen skin that i feel</p>
<p>that maybe are allergies</p>
<p>uh especially my fingers and certain</p>
<p>foods that i eat i noticed that maybe it</p>
<p>is more so listening to you have stopped</p>
<p>like eating nuts and other things and</p>
<p>sometimes i don&rsquo;t have any itching at</p>
<p>all but sometimes i do still</p>
<p>lately uh in the last six months</p>
<p>i started seeing a spot in one of my</p>
<p>legs white spot and then i went to the</p>
<p>dermatologist he said that he wants to</p>
<p>treat it like with light he may be</p>
<p>meant illegal i never heard of it</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know i think i feel that</p>
<p>everything is related to the stomach</p>
<p>issue</p>
<p>okay good so let me just kind of um</p>
<p>recommend i&rsquo;m assuming i always assume</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing the healthy version of</p>
<p>ketogenic diet that i recommend so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just let&rsquo;s just pretend that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing that um the other thing is that um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve released a video just recently that</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t watched it you definitely</p>
<p>need to watch it it has to do with mucus</p>
<p>in the back of the throat but really</p>
<p>that video is all about</p>
<p>acid reflux</p>
<p>problems in the lower digestive tract</p>
<p>that you you should watch that</p>
<p>because that could explain some of your</p>
<p>symptoms</p>
<p>the thing that</p>
<p>the big clue that you gave me was that</p>
<p>stone in your bile ducts that tells us</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re low in bile salts</p>
<p>so that also tells me that the liver</p>
<p>probably needs some help to make more</p>
<p>bile because bio</p>
<p>bile um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry gallstones are</p>
<p>a combination of too much</p>
<p>cholesterol versus not enough bile</p>
<p>so instead of reducing cholesterol i</p>
<p>would increase your bile salts i would</p>
<p>go out and get a product called tutka</p>
<p>start taking two on an empty stomach in</p>
<p>the morning two in the afternoon an</p>
<p>empty stomach and that will start to</p>
<p>increase your ability</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um digest fats</p>
<p>like vitamin a that supports</p>
<p>the the dryness of the mucous membranes</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re that you have a problem with</p>
<p>um also vitamin d</p>
<p>which will help um a lot of the other</p>
<p>symptoms that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re expressing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so i think you&rsquo;re having a hard time</p>
<p>extracting these fat soluble nutrients</p>
<p>because you need more bile</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so cut cut will assist you to speed</p>
<p>things up and also if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough of</p>
<p>the bile</p>
<p>you could get a regurgitation</p>
<p>of not acid but bile that that actually</p>
<p>gives you the same symptoms</p>
<p>as acid so it could be a</p>
<p>bile reflux issue as well so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the question is how do we fix the</p>
<p>stomach well um</p>
<p>i would go back to my eating plan and</p>
<p>really make sure you&rsquo;re doing exactly</p>
<p>like i said because</p>
<p>i think a lot of people they try the</p>
<p>remedies that i recommend but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting the basic eating plan</p>
<p>long enough consistent enough for it to</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>um they kind of sort of do it off the</p>
<p>cuff</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not exactly done right and so now</p>
<p>they think well that didn&rsquo;t work i&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>down to the next thing so just make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that getting the basic</p>
<p>eating plan correct with the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting which will probably</p>
<p>give you more</p>
<p>relief than anything um</p>
<p>but um but definitely try some tatka</p>
<p>that will help you and um</p>
<p>um i think that&rsquo;s what you need to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a bile deficiency issue</p>
<p>how do you where did i get that from you</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>no you can uh uh look it up online i</p>
<p>think probably amazon</p>
<p>how do you know that it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>t u</p>
<p>tutcom</p>
<p>t-u-d-c-a</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay yeah</p>
<p>thank you all right thanks so much that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a little bit out of time there</p>
<p>olivia so we&rsquo;re going to have to roll</p>
<p>but we do have another gentleman that</p>
<p>kind of popped in on us mid show and i</p>
<p>want to make sure we don&rsquo;t uh ignore him</p>
<p>and is it uh</p>
<p>giulio with a g how do you say your name</p>
<p>sir</p>
<p>yes julio julia all right you are on</p>
<p>with dr byrd</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>uh first of all i want to thank you</p>
<p>because i had amazing results with the</p>
<p>acupressure</p>
<p>and i solved</p>
<p>really bad problems i had with knots on</p>
<p>my muscles</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>thank you thank you for that</p>
<p>the the question i have is um</p>
<p>every day when i wake up i am</p>
<p>super tired even if i have</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>eight nine hours of sleep</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very very tired when i when i wake up</p>
<p>and to the point that</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>i really had to have to fight to get up</p>
<p>from the bed</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>saw all the videos on the channel about</p>
<p>sleep and</p>
<p>all this stuff but i couldn&rsquo;t find a</p>
<p>solution so</p>
<p>can you help me with that</p>
<p>um a question i have did you start the</p>
<p>keto plan that i recommend with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting yet</p>
<p>i did</p>
<p>actually i&rsquo;m on paleo</p>
<p>kind of paleokido</p>
<p>but i do have some grains because i</p>
<p>summarize because i work out so i need</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>and i tried intermediate fasting in the</p>
<p>past</p>
<p>but i</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t resolve this problem and i have</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>this problem since i can remember so</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s one tip i&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to give you um</p>
<p>paleo is basically</p>
<p>keto but allowing more carbs</p>
<p>and so those little bit of carbs</p>
<p>especially if you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance which it sounds like you do</p>
<p>can keep you kind of in a state of</p>
<p>fatigue and tiredness all the time i had</p>
<p>that problem so unless i bring my carbs</p>
<p>down and eliminate those the rice and</p>
<p>the fruit that type of thing</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t really experience the energy</p>
<p>that i really need to be in to be able</p>
<p>to convert to full keto so now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really burning fat and you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>the energy from that new fuel</p>
<p>you have to bring the carbs down low</p>
<p>enough which you might not be low enough</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s your big problem um</p>
<p>i would do that and in fact just do it</p>
<p>for one to two weeks okay to prove it to</p>
<p>yourself</p>
<p>cut out those little carbs i know</p>
<p>one of the reasons you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>keep your weight up right now but maybe</p>
<p>you just increase more</p>
<p>food right now and exercise a little bit</p>
<p>harder and</p>
<p>just to get more calories more fat</p>
<p>than the carb and then see what happens</p>
<p>with your energy i think that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s missing i do know if i go</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re eating right now i will</p>
<p>feel very similar i feel like i just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the energy that i should</p>
<p>um from the sleep that i get</p>
<p>and then when you experience that then</p>
<p>you can decide wow okay this is what i</p>
<p>want to do and then make some decisions</p>
<p>anyway thank everyone on the in the</p>
<p>green room and everyone listening i</p>
<p>appreciate all of your wonderful</p>
<p>questions</p>
<p>stay tuned for some really interesting</p>
<p>videos coming up this next week and we</p>
<p>will see you next friday</p>
<p>morning or actually whatever time it</p>
<p>will be 11 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
