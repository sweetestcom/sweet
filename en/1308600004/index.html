    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>Along those lines,</p>
<p>I want to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system,</p>
<p>with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s element.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlment.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs</p>
<p>in the sense that I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any one substance or collection of substances</p>
<p>that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>Today is episode three of the podcast,</p>
<p>and it is office hours.</p>
<p>Office hours, as many of you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where students come to the office of the professor,</p>
<p>sit down and ask questions,</p>
<p>requesting clarification about things that were confusing,</p>
<p>or to simply go down the route of exploring a topic</p>
<p>with more depth and detail.</p>
<p>I asked for your questions to be listed</p>
<p>in the comment section of the previous two episodes</p>
<p>of the podcast on YouTube, as well as on Instagram.</p>
<p>And I, first of all, just want to thank you</p>
<p>for the many questions.</p>
<p>They are excellent.</p>
<p>We read them all.</p>
<p>We distilled from that large batch of questions</p>
<p>to two types of questions,</p>
<p>questions that were asked very often</p>
<p>and were liked very often,</p>
<p>with a little thumbs up like tab,</p>
<p>as well as questions that we thought could really expand</p>
<p>on the topics that we&rsquo;ve covered previously.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to cover both of those.</p>
<p>If we did not get to your question,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t despair.</p>
<p>We will keep track of those,</p>
<p>and we have several more episodes devoted to this topic</p>
<p>of sleep and wakefulness and learning</p>
<p>during the month of January,</p>
<p>maybe even leaking over a little bit</p>
<p>into the month of February.</p>
<p>So we have time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the unique formats of this podcast</p>
<p>is that we have time for dialogue.</p>
<p>We have time for your questions,</p>
<p>and we have time to really go deep into these topics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s official, Costello&rsquo;s sleeping in the background.</p>
<p>So if you hear snoring,</p>
<p>Costello is going to be keeping time</p>
<p>with his deep and melodic snoring.</p>
<p>There he goes.</p>
<p>So the questions that we received,</p>
<p>I batched crudely into a couple of different categories.</p>
<p>Light, exercise, supplementation,</p>
<p>temperature, learning, plasticity,</p>
<p>and mood and sort of mood-related disorders.</p>
<p>There were a lot of questions about those.</p>
<p>Before we begin any of this,</p>
<p>I want to point out something that I always say.</p>
<p>It sounds like boilerplate,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important not just to protect me,</p>
<p>but to protect you,</p>
<p>which is that I am not a physician.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything,</p>
<p>including behavioral protocols.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor, so I profess a lot of things</p>
<p>based on quality peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>You should take that information.</p>
<p>You should filter it through whatever it is</p>
<p>that you currently happen to be dealing with,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s health or illness.</p>
<p>You should consult with a licensed healthcare professional</p>
<p>before you add or remove anything</p>
<p>from your daily life protocol.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not responsible for your health.</p>
<p>You are, so be smart with this information</p>
<p>and be a stringent filter, as we say.</p>
<p>Okay, very well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started on the actual material.</p>
<p>Somebody asked,</p>
<p>what is the role of moonlight and fire?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m presuming they mean fireplace or candle</p>
<p>or things of that sort, in setting circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Is it okay to view moonlight at night</p>
<p>or will that wake me up?</p>
<p>Will a fire in my fireplace or using candlelight</p>
<p>be too much light?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Also offers me the opportunity to share with you</p>
<p>what I think is a quite beautiful definition</p>
<p>of what light is in a quantitative sense.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve mentioned a few times the use of apps</p>
<p>and light meters and things to measure things like lux,</p>
<p>which sometimes are also described in terms of candelas.</p>
<p>So those are the two units for measuring light intensity.</p>
<p>Typically lux, L-U-X, is the unit.</p>
<p>And so before we go forward and discuss this many lux</p>
<p>or that many lux, I want to just tell you what a lux is,</p>
<p>because it relates to this question.</p>
<p>One lux equals the illumination of one square meter surface</p>
<p>at one meter away from a single candle.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>So somebody actually decided at some point</p>
<p>that the amount of illumination at one square meter surface,</p>
<p>one meter away from a single candle, that equals one lux.</p>
<p>So when we talk about 6,000 lux of light intensity</p>
<p>or 10,000 lux of light intensity,</p>
<p>now you have a kind of a reference or a framework</p>
<p>that would be the equivalent of,</p>
<p>you could think of it as 6,000 candles</p>
<p>all with their light intensity shown on one square meter</p>
<p>from one meter&rsquo;s distance away.</p>
<p>Or of course, if it was a different number of lux,</p>
<p>it would be a different number of candles.</p>
<p>So you get the idea.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the great thing.</p>
<p>Turns out that moonlight, candlelight,</p>
<p>and even a fireplace,</p>
<p>if you have one of these roaring fires</p>
<p>going in the fireplace,</p>
<p>do not reset your circadian clock at night</p>
<p>and trick your brain into thinking that it&rsquo;s morning.</p>
<p>Even though if you&rsquo;ve ever sat close to a fireplace</p>
<p>or even a candle, that light seems very bright.</p>
<p>And there are two reasons for that that are very important.</p>
<p>The first one is that these neurons in your eye</p>
<p>that I discussed in the previous episode,</p>
<p>these melanopsin ganglion cells,</p>
<p>also called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells,</p>
<p>those cells adjust their sensitivity across the day.</p>
<p>And those cells respond best to the blue-yellow contrast</p>
<p>present in the rising and setting sun,</p>
<p>so-called low solar angle sun,</p>
<p>also discussed in the previous episode.</p>
<p>But those cells adjust their sensitivity</p>
<p>such that they will not activate the triggers in the brain</p>
<p>that convey daytime signals when they view moonlight,</p>
<p>even a full moon, a really bright moon, or fire.</p>
<p>Now, this does raise an interesting kind of thought point,</p>
<p>which is a lot of people have talked about lunacy</p>
<p>and the fact that when there&rsquo;s a full moon out,</p>
<p>people act differently and behave differently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of lore around that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a little bit of quality science around that</p>
<p>that maybe we can address in the future.</p>
<p>But moonlight is typically not going to wake us up too much,</p>
<p>except maybe if the moon is really full and really bright,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s possibility for that.</p>
<p>So provided you&rsquo;re not going to burn down</p>
<p>the structure you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to burn down the forest,</p>
<p>enjoy your fireplaces, enjoy your lights from candles,</p>
<p>and those are perfectly safe</p>
<p>without disrupting your circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Because we talked about just how crucial it is</p>
<p>to avoid bright lights</p>
<p>between the hours of about 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>except when you need to view things for sake of safety</p>
<p>or work and so forth.</p>
<p>I also received a lot of questions about red light.</p>
<p>Now, I think I was asked those questions</p>
<p>because red light is used</p>
<p>in a number of different commercial products</p>
<p>where these products tend to include a sheet</p>
<p>of very bright red lights</p>
<p>that one is supposed to view early in the day.</p>
<p>And there are various claims</p>
<p>attached to these red light devices,</p>
<p>that they improve mitochondrial function,</p>
<p>that they improve metabolism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be really honest,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t name brands,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to name particular studies,</p>
<p>because what I&rsquo;m about to say about these studies</p>
<p>is not particularly unkind,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just say that none of the studies that I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>except for one that I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>pointing to the positive effects of red light</p>
<p>on the visual system,</p>
<p>are published in blue ribbon journals.</p>
<p>They tend to be published in journals</p>
<p>that I had to work hard to find.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the peer review instringency level is.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say red light isn&rsquo;t beneficial,</p>
<p>because there is one study in particular</p>
<p>that came from Glenn Jeffrey&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at the University of College London.</p>
<p>It was published last year.</p>
<p>Glenn is somebody I happen to know.</p>
<p>He has an excellent reputation, excellent vision scientist.</p>
<p>What this study essentially showed,</p>
<p>and again, this is a study that I very much like the data</p>
<p>and think it was done with very high standards.</p>
<p>What this study shows is that viewing red light</p>
<p>for a few minutes each morning</p>
<p>can have positive effects on mitochondria</p>
<p>in a particular retinal cell type</p>
<p>that tends to degenerate or decline in function</p>
<p>with age in humans,</p>
<p>and that cell type is the photoreceptor.</p>
<p>The photoreceptor is a type of cell in your eye</p>
<p>that sits at the back of the eye.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of some distance away from the ganglion cells,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the cell that converts light information</p>
<p>into electrical signals that the rest of the retina</p>
<p>and brain can understand.</p>
<p>These are vitally important cells.</p>
<p>Without them, people are blind,</p>
<p>and many people&rsquo;s vision gets worse with age,</p>
<p>in particular, age-related macular degeneration,</p>
<p>but also related to some other factors,</p>
<p>including photoreceptor functionality</p>
<p>just getting worse with time,</p>
<p>and what Glenn showed was that red light flashes</p>
<p>delivered in particular early in the day,</p>
<p>but not late in the day,</p>
<p>can help repair the mitochondria.</p>
<p>Now, this study needs more support</p>
<p>from additional studies, of course.</p>
<p>They are doing a clinical trial.</p>
<p>They did report on what, I think it was 12 patients,</p>
<p>and so the work is ongoing, but that was very interesting,</p>
<p>and it points to some potentially</p>
<p>really useful things about red light.</p>
<p>However, most of the questions I got about red light</p>
<p>for sake of office hours</p>
<p>were about the use of red light later in the day,</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>In principle, red light will not stimulate</p>
<p>the melanopsin retinal neurons</p>
<p>that wake up the brain and circadian clock</p>
<p>and signal daytime.</p>
<p>However, most of the red lights,</p>
<p>in particular, the red lights</p>
<p>that come on these sheets of these products</p>
<p>that people are supposed to view</p>
<p>in order to access a number of proclaimed health effects,</p>
<p>those are way too bright</p>
<p>and would definitely wake up your body and brain,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re going to use those products,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not suggesting you do or you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>you would want to use those early in the day.</p>
<p>Who knows, you might even derive some benefit</p>
<p>on mitochondrial function in these photoreceptors,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re thinking about red light</p>
<p>for sake of avoiding the negative effects of light</p>
<p>later in the day and at night,</p>
<p>then you want that red light to be very, very dim,</p>
<p>certainly much dimmer than is</p>
<p>on most of those commercial products.</p>
<p>Now, do you need red lights?</p>
<p>No, although red lights are rather convenient</p>
<p>because you can see pretty well with them on,</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re dim,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t wake up the circadian clock,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t have this dopamine disrupting thing</p>
<p>that we talked about in the previous podcast.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a role for red light</p>
<p>potentially early in the day</p>
<p>and for mitochondrial repair in the photoreceptors,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a role for dim red light</p>
<p>later in the day and at night.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re starting to notice a theme here,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s no immediate prescription</p>
<p>of look at these lights,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s look at these lights potentially</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you want to do at particular times of day</p>
<p>and with particular intensities.</p>
<p>It brings us back to the blue light issue,</p>
<p>which is so many people are obsessed</p>
<p>with avoiding blue light,</p>
<p>but you actually want a ton of blue light</p>
<p>early in the day and throughout the day,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t wear your blue blockers then,</p>
<p>or maybe even don&rsquo;t wear them at all.</p>
<p>And at night, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have blue blockers on</p>
<p>if the lights are bright enough,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re still going to be activating</p>
<p>these cells and mechanisms.</p>
<p>I just want to add something</p>
<p>since about the science behind the blue blocker confusion.</p>
<p>So these melanopsin retinal cells do react to blue light,</p>
<p>that is the best stimulus</p>
<p>for one of these melanopsin cells,</p>
<p>which led to the belief that blue blockers</p>
<p>would be a good thing for preventing resetting</p>
<p>of the circadian clock at night</p>
<p>and deleterious effects of screens, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, the people that made these products</p>
<p>failed to actually read the papers start to finish,</p>
<p>or if they did, they didn&rsquo;t comprehend a critical element,</p>
<p>which is that most of those papers early on</p>
<p>took those neurons out and put them in a dish.</p>
<p>And when they did that,</p>
<p>they divorced those neurons</p>
<p>from their natural connections in the eye.</p>
<p>Turns out in your eye and my eye right now,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we care about,</p>
<p>these cells exist and these cells respond to blue light,</p>
<p>but also to other wavelengths of light</p>
<p>because they not only respond directly to light</p>
<p>as they do in a dish,</p>
<p>they also respond to input from photoreceptors.</p>
<p>So if you talk to anyone in the circadian biology field,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell you, oh yeah,</p>
<p>this blue light thing has really gotten out of control</p>
<p>because people assume that blue light is the culprit</p>
<p>because blue light is the best stimulus.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that blue light is the only stimulus</p>
<p>that will trigger these cells, okay?</p>
<p>So like many things,</p>
<p>a scientific paper can be accurate without being exhaustive.</p>
<p>And a lot of claims about products</p>
<p>can be accurate, but not exhaustive.</p>
<p>So blue light during the day is great.</p>
<p>Get that screen light, get that sunlight,</p>
<p>especially getting overhead lights.</p>
<p>I talk about all this in the previous podcast.</p>
<p>But at night, you really want to avoid those bright lights.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s blue light or something else.</p>
<p>And so there was a real confusion about the papers</p>
<p>and the data when most of those product recommendations</p>
<p>were made.</p>
<p>Okay, while we&rsquo;re on that topic,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about light in other orifices of the body.</p>
<p>I made kind of a joke about this the last podcast episode,</p>
<p>but a couple of people wrote to me and said,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ve seen some claims that light delivered</p>
<p>to the ears, into the ears or the roof of the mouth</p>
<p>or up the nose can be beneficial</p>
<p>for setting circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>You know, not directly anyway.</p>
<p>And this is a great opportunity for us to distinguish</p>
<p>between what is commonly called the placebo effect,</p>
<p>but a more important way to think about any manipulation,</p>
<p>behavioral or otherwise, that you might do</p>
<p>is the difference between modulation and mediation.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that will modulate your biology.</p>
<p>Putting a couple of lights up your nose,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t do this, might modulate your biology</p>
<p>by way of the stress hormone that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>when you stuff those things up your nose.</p>
<p>Remember earlier, previous podcast,</p>
<p>I said that virtually anything will phase shift</p>
<p>to your circadian rhythm</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s different and dramatic enough.</p>
<p>So the question is, is it the light delivered up the nose</p>
<p>or through the ears or some other orifice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mediating the process?</p>
<p>Is it actually tapping into the natural biology</p>
<p>of the system that you&rsquo;re trying to manipulate?</p>
<p>And this is where I like to distinguish</p>
<p>between real biology and hacks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the word hack</p>
<p>or frankly neurohacking or biohacking.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like the term</p>
<p>because a hack is using something for a purpose</p>
<p>for which it was not intended, right?</p>
<p>But where you can kind of, it&rsquo;s a kind of a cheat</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not how biology works well.</p>
<p>So I try and distinguish between things</p>
<p>that really mediate biological processes</p>
<p>and things that modulate them.</p>
<p>There are a number of commercial products out there</p>
<p>with some studies attached to them</p>
<p>claiming that light delivered to the ears</p>
<p>or wherever can adjust your wakefulness</p>
<p>or adjust your sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at those papers.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m probably gonna lose some friends by saying this</p>
<p>but maybe I&rsquo;ll gain a few as well.</p>
<p>Not blue ribbon journals, frankly.</p>
<p>Oftentimes read the small print.</p>
<p>There was a conflict of interest clause there</p>
<p>related to commercial interests.</p>
<p>If somebody disagrees with me outright on this</p>
<p>and can send to me a peer reviewed paper</p>
<p>or publish in a quality journal about light delivered</p>
<p>anywhere but the eyes of humans</p>
<p>that can mediate circadian rhythms, wakefulness, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more than happy to take a look at that</p>
<p>and change my words and stance on this</p>
<p>and do it publicly, of course.</p>
<p>But until then, I&rsquo;m guessing that the proper controls</p>
<p>were not done of adjusting for heat that could be delivered</p>
<p>which can definitely shift circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna talk about temperature</p>
<p>and other things like that.</p>
<p>So light to the eyes folks</p>
<p>is where these light effects work in humans.</p>
<p>In other animals,</p>
<p>they have extraocular photoreception, in humans, no.</p>
<p>And just be mindful.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not trying to encourage people</p>
<p>to avoid certain products in particular</p>
<p>but just be mindful of this difference</p>
<p>between modulation and mediation.</p>
<p>And mediating a process through a hardwired</p>
<p>or longstanding biological mechanism</p>
<p>is really where you&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>the powerful effects over time.</p>
<p>I also, as you&rsquo;ve probably noticed,</p>
<p>I really tend to favor behavioral tools</p>
<p>and zero cost tools first</p>
<p>and getting those dialed in before you start,</p>
<p>you know, plugging in and swallowing</p>
<p>and, you know, putting things in various places</p>
<p>just to really figure out how your biology works</p>
<p>and explore that,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s of course a clinical need</p>
<p>to take a prescribed drug,</p>
<p>in which case by all means, listen to your doctor.</p>
<p>Okay, a huge number of people asked me about,</p>
<p>what about light through windows?</p>
<p>And I actually did an Instagram post about this.</p>
<p>Look, setting your circadian clock</p>
<p>with sunlight coming through a window</p>
<p>is gonna take 50 to 100 times longer.</p>
<p>If you want the date on that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to send you to the various papers</p>
<p>that were described in the previous podcast</p>
<p>that Jamie Zeitzer from Stanford</p>
<p>and I have discussed also elsewhere.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s really the key thing with this.</p>
<p>Do the experiment.</p>
<p>You can download the free app Light Meter.</p>
<p>You can have a bright day outside</p>
<p>or some sunlight, hold up that app, take a picture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll tell you how many lux.</p>
<p>Now you know what lux are.</p>
<p>It will tell you how many lux are in that environment.</p>
<p>Now close the window.</p>
<p>And if you want, close the screen or don&rsquo;t open the screen.</p>
<p>You can do all sorts of experiments.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see that it will at least half</p>
<p>the amount of lux.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t scale linearly,</p>
<p>meaning let&rsquo;s say I get 10,000 lux outside,</p>
<p>5,000 looking out through an open window,</p>
<p>and then I close the window and it&rsquo;s 2,500 lux.</p>
<p>It does not mean that you just need to view that sunlight</p>
<p>for twice as long if it&rsquo;s half as many lux, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like 2,500 lux means you need to look</p>
<p>for 10 minutes and 5,000 lux means you look for five minutes.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t scale that way just because the biology</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>Best thing to do is to get outside if you can.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, next best thing to do is to keep</p>
<p>that window open.</p>
<p>It is perfectly fine to wear prescription lenses</p>
<p>and contacts.</p>
<p>Why is it okay to wear prescription lenses and contacts</p>
<p>when those are glass also,</p>
<p>but looking through a window diminishes the effect?</p>
<p>Well, we should think about this.</p>
<p>The lenses that you wear in front of your eyes</p>
<p>by prescription or on your eyes are designed</p>
<p>to focus the light onto your neural retina.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s what nearsightedness is,</p>
<p>is when the image, because your lens doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>quite right, the image falls in front of the neural retina.</p>
<p>Wearing a particular lens in front of that focuses</p>
<p>the lens onto your retina, onto these very neurons</p>
<p>so they can communicate that to the brain.</p>
<p>Costello is loving this, he&rsquo;s deep in sleep.</p>
<p>And if we, maybe we could play him some tones</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll remember it later based on the studies</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about in a little bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;d know if he remembered it or not,</p>
<p>but prescription lenses are fine.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;re great for this reason.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually focusing the light onto the retina.</p>
<p>So think about this logically and all of a sudden</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Your glass window or your windshield or the side window</p>
<p>of your car, it isn&rsquo;t optically perfect to bring the image</p>
<p>and the light onto your retina.</p>
<p>In fact, what it&rsquo;s doing is it&rsquo;s scattering</p>
<p>and filtering light, in particular the wavelengths</p>
<p>of light that you want.</p>
<p>So if you live in a low light environment,</p>
<p>lots of questions about this.</p>
<p>We talked about this, the previous podcast,</p>
<p>but just get outside for longer</p>
<p>or and or use really bright lights inside.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s think about why I&rsquo;m making some</p>
<p>of these recommendations because I think it can really</p>
<p>empower you with the ability to change your behavior</p>
<p>in terms of light viewing and other things,</p>
<p>depending on time of year,</p>
<p>depending on other lifestyle factors.</p>
<p>The important point to understand is that early in the day,</p>
<p>your central circadian clocks and all these mechanisms</p>
<p>are looking for a lot of light.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t have a mind of their own,</p>
<p>but it needs a lot of light to trigger this daytime signal,</p>
<p>alertness, et cetera.</p>
<p>And early in the day, but not in the middle of the day,</p>
<p>you can sum or add photons.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this brief period of time early in the day</p>
<p>when the sun is low in the sky,</p>
<p>when your brain and body are expecting</p>
<p>a morning wake-up signal,</p>
<p>where let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s not that bright outside.</p>
<p>Someone sent me a picture or a little movie</p>
<p>of their walk in England, and it was pretty overcast</p>
<p>and they were using light meter and they said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only about 700 lux or maybe even less.</p>
<p>And I said, well, stay outside longer,</p>
<p>but when you get inside, turn on the lights really bright</p>
<p>and overhead lights in particular,</p>
<p>because those will be best for stimulating these mechanisms.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because at least for the first few hours</p>
<p>of the day, you can continue to sum or add photon activation</p>
<p>of these cells in the eye and the brain.</p>
<p>In the middle of the day, once the sun is overhead,</p>
<p>or even if you stay inside all morning</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re in the circadian dead zone,</p>
<p>which sounds terrible and it is terrible</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you get a ton</p>
<p>of artificial light or even sunlight,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to shift your circadian clock,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to get that wake-up signal.</p>
<p>And then in the evening,</p>
<p>you want to think about this whole system</p>
<p>as being vulnerable to even a few photons of light</p>
<p>because your sensitivity to light really goes up at night.</p>
<p>And I talked last time about how you can protect</p>
<p>against that sensitivity by looking at the setting sun</p>
<p>and watching the evening sun,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not crossing the horizon</p>
<p>around the time of sunset.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it adjusts your retinal sensitivity</p>
<p>and your melatonin pathway so that light is not</p>
<p>as detrimental to melatonin at night.</p>
<p>Think about the afternoon sunlight viewing as kind of a,</p>
<p>I think of it as kind of a Netflix inoculation.</p>
<p>It allows me to watch a little bit of Netflix</p>
<p>in the evening, although it&rsquo;s very hard to watch</p>
<p>a little bit of anything on Netflix.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s some other neurobiological process</p>
<p>going on there where I have to watch episode</p>
<p>after episode after episode.</p>
<p>But in any case, you can protect yourself</p>
<p>against some of that bad effect of light at night</p>
<p>by looking at light in the evening.</p>
<p>It really does adjust down the sensitivity of the system.</p>
<p>Okay, I want to talk about seasonal changes</p>
<p>in all these things as they relate to mood and metabolism.</p>
<p>So depending on where you are in the world,</p>
<p>Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere,</p>
<p>at the equator or closer to the poles,</p>
<p>the days and nights are going to be different lengths.</p>
<p>That just makes sense.</p>
<p>But that translates to real biological signals</p>
<p>that impact everything from wakefulness and sleep times,</p>
<p>but also mood and metabolism.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how this works.</p>
<p>Now, after seeing the previous episode of the podcast</p>
<p>and paying attention here, you are armed with the knowledge</p>
<p>to really understand how it is that believe it or not,</p>
<p>every cell in your body is tuned to the movement</p>
<p>of the planet relative to the sun.</p>
<p>So as all of you know,</p>
<p>the earth spins once every 24 hours on its axis.</p>
<p>So part of that day we&rsquo;re bathed in sunlight,</p>
<p>depending on where we are,</p>
<p>the other half of the day or part of the day</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in darkness.</p>
<p>The earth also travels around the sun.</p>
<p>365 days is the time that it takes, one year,</p>
<p>to travel around that sun.</p>
<p>The earth is tilted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfectly upright.</p>
<p>So the earth is tilted on its axis.</p>
<p>So depending on where we are in that 365 day journey,</p>
<p>and depending on where we are in terms of hemisphere,</p>
<p>northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere,</p>
<p>some days of the year are longer than others.</p>
<p>Some are very short, some are very long.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at the equator,</p>
<p>you experience less variation in day length</p>
<p>and therefore night length.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re closer to the poles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to experience some very long days.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also going to experience some very short days,</p>
<p>depending on which pole you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>and what time of year it is.</p>
<p>A simple way to put this is depending on time of year,</p>
<p>the days are either getting shorter or getting longer.</p>
<p>Now, every cell in your body adjusts its biology</p>
<p>according to day length,</p>
<p>except your brain body and cells</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually know anything about day length.</p>
<p>It only knows night length.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Light inhibits melatonin powerfully.</p>
<p>If days are long and getting longer,</p>
<p>that means melatonin is reduced.</p>
<p>The total amount of melatonin is less</p>
<p>because light is more, therefore melatonin is less.</p>
<p>If days are getting shorter,</p>
<p>light can&rsquo;t inhibit melatonin as much</p>
<p>through the summing of photon mechanisms</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>and that melatonin signal is getting longer.</p>
<p>So every cell in your body actually knows</p>
<p>external day length and therefore time of year</p>
<p>by way of the duration of the melatonin signal.</p>
<p>And in general, it&rsquo;s fair to say that in diurnal animals,</p>
<p>meaning animals like us that tend to be awake</p>
<p>during the daytime and not nocturnal animals,</p>
<p>which tend to be awake at night,</p>
<p>the longer the melatonin signal, the more depressed,</p>
<p>not necessarily clinically depressed,</p>
<p>although that can happen,</p>
<p>but the more depressed our systems tend to be.</p>
<p>Reproduction, metabolism, mood,</p>
<p>turnover rates of skin cells and hair cells</p>
<p>all tend to be diminished</p>
<p>compared to the spring and summer months for some,</p>
<p>northern hemisphere spring and summer months,</p>
<p>or the times in which days are very long</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s less melatonin that tends to,</p>
<p>in almost all animals, including humans,</p>
<p>more breeding, more hormone elevation</p>
<p>of the hormones that stimulate breeding,</p>
<p>reproduction, and fertility.</p>
<p>Metabolism is up.</p>
<p>Lipid metabolism, fat burning is up.</p>
<p>Protein synthesis is up.</p>
<p>These things tend to correlate with the seasons.</p>
<p>Now, some people are very, very strongly tied</p>
<p>to the seasons.</p>
<p>They get depressed, clinically depressed in winter,</p>
<p>and light therapies are very useful for those people.</p>
<p>Some people love the winter and they&rsquo;re happiest in winter</p>
<p>and they feel kind of depressed in summer,</p>
<p>although that is far more rare.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean depression cannot exist in the summer,</p>
<p>but when we&rsquo;re talking about seasonal depression,</p>
<p>that tends to be true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more depression in winter.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s other things that correlate with seasonality.</p>
<p>Suicide rates tend to be highest in the spring,</p>
<p>not in the winter,</p>
<p>but that has to do with some of the more complicated</p>
<p>and unfortunately tragic aspects of suicide,</p>
<p>which is that oftentimes people will commit suicide</p>
<p>not at the very depths of their energy levels,</p>
<p>but as they&rsquo;re emerging from those depths of low energy.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about suicidality and mood disorders</p>
<p>in a later podcast season, meaning a month later,</p>
<p>but for now, just understand that everybody</p>
<p>is going through these natural fluctuations</p>
<p>depending on the duration of the melatonin signal.</p>
<p>Now, this might lead you to say,</p>
<p>well, then I should just really get as much light</p>
<p>as I can all the time and reduce melatonin</p>
<p>and feel great all the time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way</p>
<p>because melatonin also has important effects</p>
<p>on the immune system.</p>
<p>It has important effects on transmitter systems</p>
<p>in the brain, et cetera.</p>
<p>So everybody needs to figure out for themselves</p>
<p>how much light they need early in the day</p>
<p>and how much light they need to avoid late in the day</p>
<p>in order to optimize their mood and metabolism.</p>
<p>There is no one size fits all prescription</p>
<p>because there is a range of melatonin receptors.</p>
<p>There are a range of everything from metabolic types</p>
<p>to genetic histories, family histories, et cetera.</p>
<p>There is no one size fits all prescription,</p>
<p>but by understanding that light and extended day length</p>
<p>inhibit melatonin and melatonin tends to be associated</p>
<p>with a more depressed or reduced functioning</p>
<p>of these kind of activity driving and mood elevating signals</p>
<p>and understanding that you have some control</p>
<p>over melatonin by way of light,</p>
<p>including sunlight, but also artificial light.</p>
<p>That should empower you, I believe,</p>
<p>to make the adjustments that if you&rsquo;re feeling low,</p>
<p>you might ask, how much light am I getting?</p>
<p>When am I getting that light?</p>
<p>Because sleep is also important for restoring mood, right?</p>
<p>So you need sleep.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just crush melatonin across the board</p>
<p>and expect to feel good</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re not going to fall asleep</p>
<p>and stay asleep.</p>
<p>Melatonin, not incidentally, comes from,</p>
<p>is synthesized from serotonin.</p>
<p>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is associated</p>
<p>with feelings of wellbeing provided to proper levels,</p>
<p>but wellbeing of a particular kind,</p>
<p>wellbeing associated with quiescence and calm</p>
<p>and the feeling that we have enough resources</p>
<p>in our immediate kind of conditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the kind of thing that comes from a good meal</p>
<p>or sitting down with friends or holding a loved one</p>
<p>or conversing with somebody that you really bond with.</p>
<p>Serotonin does not stimulate action.</p>
<p>It tends to stimulate stillness.</p>
<p>Very different than the neuromodulator dopamine,</p>
<p>which is a reward, feel-good neuromodulator</p>
<p>that stimulates action.</p>
<p>And actually dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine,</p>
<p>to adrenaline, which actually puts us into action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually made from dopamine, right?</p>
<p>So you can start to think about light as a signal</p>
<p>that is very powerful for modulating things</p>
<p>like sleep and wakefulness,</p>
<p>but also serotonin levels, melatonin levels.</p>
<p>And I talked about this previously,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll mention once more</p>
<p>that light in the middle of the night</p>
<p>reduces dopamine levels to the point</p>
<p>where it can start causing problems</p>
<p>with learning and memory and mood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one powerful reason to avoid bright light</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Seasonal rhythms have a number of effects,</p>
<p>but humans are not purely seasonal breeders.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of animals, we breed all year long.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a preponderance</p>
<p>of September babies in my life.</p>
<p>Not actual babies, people that are born in September,</p>
<p>which means that they were conceived in December.</p>
<p>Without knowing the details, we can fairly assume that.</p>
<p>And December, at least in the Northern hemisphere,</p>
<p>days tend to be shorter and nights tend to be longer.</p>
<p>So clearly humans aren&rsquo;t seasonal breeders,</p>
<p>but there are shifts in breeding and fertility</p>
<p>that exist in humans,</p>
<p>but also much more strongly in other animals.</p>
<p>So seasonal effects vary.</p>
<p>Some of you will experience very strong seasonal effects.</p>
<p>Others of you will not.</p>
<p>I think everybody should be taking care</p>
<p>to get adequate sunlight and to avoid bright light at night</p>
<p>throughout the year, if possible.</p>
<p>Throughout this podcast and in previous episodes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been mentioning neuromodulators,</p>
<p>things like serotonin and dopamine,</p>
<p>which tend to bias certain brain circuits</p>
<p>and things in our body to happen</p>
<p>and certain brain circuits and things in our body</p>
<p>not to happen.</p>
<p>One of the ones I&rsquo;ve mentioned numerous times</p>
<p>is epinephrine, which is a neuromodulator</p>
<p>that tends to put us into action, make us want to move.</p>
<p>In fact, when it&rsquo;s released in high amounts</p>
<p>in our brain and body, it can lead to what we call stress</p>
<p>or the feeling of being stressed.</p>
<p>Several people ask me,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between epinephrine and adrenaline?</p>
<p>Adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands,</p>
<p>which sit right above our kidneys.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is the exact same molecule</p>
<p>except that it&rsquo;s released within the brain.</p>
<p>And so people use these phrases</p>
<p>or these words rather interchangeably.</p>
<p>Epi means near or on top of sometimes</p>
<p>and neph, neph, anytime you see nephron or eph,</p>
<p>it means kidney.</p>
<p>So it means near the kidney.</p>
<p>So epinephrine actually means near the kidney.</p>
<p>So it was used originally to describe adrenaline,</p>
<p>but epinephrine and adrenaline are basically the same thing</p>
<p>and they tend to stimulate agitation</p>
<p>and the desire to move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the topic of exercise.</p>
<p>Got a lot of questions about exercise.</p>
<p>What forms of exercise are best for sleeping well?</p>
<p>When should I exercise, et cetera?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of individual variability around this,</p>
<p>but I can talk about what I know from the science literature</p>
<p>and what I happen to do myself.</p>
<p>There are basically two forms of exercise</p>
<p>that we can talk about.</p>
<p>Although, of course,</p>
<p>I realize there are many different forms of exercise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more nuance to this,</p>
<p>but we can talk about cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>where the idea is to repeat a movement</p>
<p>over and over and over continuously.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;d be like running, biking, rowing, cycling,</p>
<p>this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a resistance exercise where you&rsquo;re moving,</p>
<p>lifting, presumably putting down also,</p>
<p>things of progressively heavier and heavier weight</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t do continuously for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>is typically the more aerobic type exercise</p>
<p>and resistance exercise, of course,</p>
<p>is the more anaerobic type exercise.</p>
<p>And yes, there&rsquo;s variation between the two.</p>
<p>Most studies of exercise have looked at aerobic exercise</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s basically the thing</p>
<p>that you can get a rat or a mouse to do.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s really weird about rats and mice?</p>
<p>They like to run on wheels so much</p>
<p>that someone actually did this study.</p>
<p>It was published in Science.</p>
<p>They put a wheel, a running wheel,</p>
<p>in the middle of a field and mice ran to that wheel</p>
<p>and ran on the wheel.</p>
<p>They, turns out that what they like</p>
<p>is the passage of the visual image of the bars</p>
<p>in front of their face,</p>
<p>which I find kind of remarkable and troubling</p>
<p>because it seems so like trivial.</p>
<p>But anyway, they love aerobic exercise.</p>
<p>And so most of the studies were done on these mice</p>
<p>that love running on wheels.</p>
<p>Whereas so far, it&rsquo;s been challenging to find conditions</p>
<p>in which mice really like to lift weights</p>
<p>or will do it in a laboratory.</p>
<p>So any weight-bearing exercise studies</p>
<p>really have to be done in humans.</p>
<p>And since humans are what we&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>there are some studies looking at these two things</p>
<p>and when they tend to work best.</p>
<p>Now you will see some places aerobic exercise</p>
<p>is best done in the morning</p>
<p>and weight training is best done in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s far more individual variation than that.</p>
<p>I think there are, however, a couple of windows</p>
<p>that the exercise science literature</p>
<p>and the circadian literature points to</p>
<p>as windows related to body temperature</p>
<p>in which performance is optimized,</p>
<p>injury is reduced, and so on.</p>
<p>And those tend to be 30 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>And that probably correlates with the inflection</p>
<p>in cortisol associated with waking,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;ve gotten light or not.</p>
<p>Three hours after waking,</p>
<p>which probably correlates to the rise in body temperature,</p>
<p>sometime right around waking.</p>
<p>And the later afternoon, usually 11 hours after waking,</p>
<p>which is when temperature tends to peak.</p>
<p>So some people like to exercise in the morning.</p>
<p>Some people like to exercise in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It really depends.</p>
<p>I think for those of us with very busy schedules,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s advantageous to be able to do your training</p>
<p>whenever you have the opportunity to do it,</p>
<p>unless you can really control your schedule.</p>
<p>And so I would never want these recommendations</p>
<p>to seem like recommendations.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m really describing is some opportunities</p>
<p>30 minutes after waking, three hours after waking,</p>
<p>or 11 hours after waking has been shown,</p>
<p>at least in some studies, to optimize performance,</p>
<p>reduce injury, and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>But you really have to figure out what works for you.</p>
<p>A note about working out first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Last time we talked about non-photic phase shifts.</p>
<p>If you exercise first thing in the morning,</p>
<p>your body will start to develop an anticipatory circuit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually plasticity in these circadian circuits</p>
<p>that will lead you to want to wake up</p>
<p>at the particular time that you exercised</p>
<p>the previous three or four days.</p>
<p>So that can be a powerful tool,</p>
<p>but you still want to get light exposure</p>
<p>because it turns out that light and exercise converge</p>
<p>to give an even bigger wake-up signal to the brain and body.</p>
<p>So you might want to think about that.</p>
<p>Some people find if they exercise late in the day,</p>
<p>they have trouble sleeping.</p>
<p>In general, intense exercise does that,</p>
<p>whereas the kind of lower intensity exercise doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I found some interesting literature</p>
<p>that talked about sleep need and exercise.</p>
<p>I found this fascinating that if one is waking,</p>
<p>not feeling rested and recovered from,</p>
<p>and yet sleeping the same amount that they typically have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite possible that the intensity of exercise</p>
<p>in the preceding two or three days is too high.</p>
<p>Whereas if one can&rsquo;t recover</p>
<p>no matter how much sleep they get,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just sleepy all the time,</p>
<p>I realize these things are correlated,</p>
<p>that the volume of training might be too high.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not an exercise scientist.</p>
<p>We should probably get Andy Galpin or somebody else on here</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really an expert in this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I do realize as soon as anyone talks about exercise</p>
<p>or nutrition publicly,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically opening themselves up</p>
<p>to all sorts of challenges</p>
<p>because you can basically find support</p>
<p>for almost any protocol in the literature.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve looked at was two journals in particular,</p>
<p>International Journal of Chronobiology</p>
<p>and Journal of Biological Rhythms, excuse me,</p>
<p>to assess these parameters</p>
<p>that I mentioned just a moment ago,</p>
<p>because the studies tended to be done in humans.</p>
<p>They were fairly recent and they came from groups</p>
<p>that I recognized as well as knowing</p>
<p>that those journals are peer reviewed.</p>
<p>Many of your questions were about neural plasticity,</p>
<p>which is the brain and nervous system&rsquo;s ability to change</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>There was a question that asked whether or not</p>
<p>these really deep biological mechanisms</p>
<p>around wakefulness, time of waking, sleep, et cetera,</p>
<p>were subject to neural plasticity, and indeed they are.</p>
<p>Some of that plasticity is short-term</p>
<p>and some of it is more long-term.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really good analogy here,</p>
<p>which is if you happen to eat on a very tight schedule</p>
<p>where every day, say at 8 a.m., noon, and 7 p.m.</p>
<p>is when you eat your food, not suggesting you do this,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you were to do that for a couple days.</p>
<p>After a few days, you would start to anticipate</p>
<p>those mealtimes where no matter where you were in the world,</p>
<p>no matter what was going on in your life,</p>
<p>about five to 10 minutes before those mealtimes,</p>
<p>you would start to feel hungry and even a little agitated,</p>
<p>which is your body&rsquo;s way of trying to get you</p>
<p>to forage for food.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of some peptide signals</p>
<p>that come from the periphery from your body,</p>
<p>things like hypocretinorexin,</p>
<p>that signal to the hypothalamus and brainstem</p>
<p>to make you active and alert and look for food</p>
<p>and feel hungry.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of an anticipatory circuit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a chemical circuit, but eventually over time,</p>
<p>the neurons, the neural circuits</p>
<p>that control hypocretinorexin would get tuned</p>
<p>to the neural circuits that are involved in eating</p>
<p>and maybe even smell and taste</p>
<p>to create a kind of eating circuit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unique to your pattern, to your rhythms.</p>
<p>The same thing is true for these waking and exercise</p>
<p>and other schedules, including ultradian schedules.</p>
<p>If you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and start getting your sunlight,</p>
<p>you start exercising in the morning</p>
<p>or you exercise in the afternoon,</p>
<p>pretty soon your body will start to anticipate that</p>
<p>and start to secrete hormones and other signals</p>
<p>that prepare your body for the ensuing activity</p>
<p>of waking up or going to sleep.</p>
<p>So if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm,</p>
<p>even if that rhythm isn&rsquo;t down to the minute,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that there&rsquo;s plasticity in these circuits</p>
<p>and it becomes easier to wake up early if that&rsquo;s your thing</p>
<p>or exercise at a particular day if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of neural plasticity.</p>
<p>A number of people ask what can I do to increase plasticity?</p>
<p>And that really comes in two forms.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plasticity that we can access in sleep</p>
<p>to improve rates of learning and depth of learning</p>
<p>from the previous day or so.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this NSDR, non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>that can be done without sleeping</p>
<p>to improve rates of learning and depth of retention,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider those both</p>
<p>and you can incorporate these protocols if you like.</p>
<p>Again, these are based on quality peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about learning in sleep.</p>
<p>This is based on some work</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll provide the reference for</p>
<p>that was published in the journal Science.</p>
<p>Excellent journal.</p>
<p>Matt Walker also talks about some of these studies</p>
<p>done by others in his book, Why We Sleep.</p>
<p>The studies, just to remind you,</p>
<p>are structured the following way.</p>
<p>An individual is brought into a laboratory,</p>
<p>does a spatial memory task.</p>
<p>So there tends to be a screen</p>
<p>with a bunch of different objects</p>
<p>popping up on the screen in different locations.</p>
<p>So it might be a bulldog&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>there might be a cat, then it might be an apple,</p>
<p>then it might be a pen in different locations.</p>
<p>And that sounds trivially easy,</p>
<p>but with time you can imagine it gets pretty tough</p>
<p>to come back a day later and remember</p>
<p>if something presented in a given location</p>
<p>was something you&rsquo;ve seen before</p>
<p>and whether or not it was presented in that location</p>
<p>or a different location.</p>
<p>If you had enough objects and changed the locations enough,</p>
<p>this can actually be quite difficult.</p>
<p>In this study, the subjects</p>
<p>either just went through the experiment</p>
<p>or a particular odor was released into the room</p>
<p>while they were learning</p>
<p>or a tone was played in the room while they were learning.</p>
<p>And then during the sleep of those subjects</p>
<p>the following night and the following night,</p>
<p>this was done repeatedly for several nights,</p>
<p>the same odor or tone was played</p>
<p>while the subjects were sleeping.</p>
<p>They did this in different stages of sleep,</p>
<p>non-REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, REM sleep.</p>
<p>They did this with just the tone in sleep</p>
<p>if the subjects had the odor, but not the tone.</p>
<p>They did it with putting the tone</p>
<p>if they had had the odor while learning.</p>
<p>So basically all the controls,</p>
<p>all the things you&rsquo;d want to see done</p>
<p>to make sure that it wasn&rsquo;t some indirect effect,</p>
<p>some modulatory effect, okay?</p>
<p>And what they found was that providing the same stimulus,</p>
<p>the odor if they smelled an odor or a tone</p>
<p>if the subjects heard a tone while learning,</p>
<p>if they just delivered that odor or tone</p>
<p>while the subjects slept,</p>
<p>rates of learning and retention of information</p>
<p>was significantly greater.</p>
<p>This is pretty cool.</p>
<p>What this means that you can cue the subconscious brain,</p>
<p>the asleep brain to learn particular things better</p>
<p>and faster.</p>
<p>So how might you implement this?</p>
<p>Well, you could play with this if you want.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any real challenge to this</p>
<p>provided the odor is a safe one</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t wake you up</p>
<p>and the tone is a safe one and doesn&rsquo;t wake you up.</p>
<p>You could do this by having a metronome, for instance,</p>
<p>while learning something,</p>
<p>playing in the background or particular music,</p>
<p>and then have that very faintly while you sleep.</p>
<p>So you could apply this if you like and try this.</p>
<p>There are a number of groups I think now</p>
<p>that are trying this using tactile stimulation.</p>
<p>So slight vibration on the wrist during learning</p>
<p>and then the same vibration on the wrist during sleep.</p>
<p>It does not appear that the sensory modality,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s odor or auditory tone</p>
<p>or tactile stimulation, somatosensory stimulation,</p>
<p>whether or not it matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable because it really shows</p>
<p>that sleep is an extension of the waking state.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve known that for a long time,</p>
<p>but this really tethers those two</p>
<p>in a very meaningful and actionable way.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll report back to you</p>
<p>as I learn more about these studies,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I know about them at this point.</p>
<p>As long as we&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>we might as well talk about dreaming</p>
<p>because I got so many questions about dreams.</p>
<p>A couple of you want to ask me what their dreams meant.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t even know what my dreams mean half the time.</p>
<p>I occasionally will wake up from a dream and remember it.</p>
<p>If you want to remember your dreams better,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who has challenges</p>
<p>remembering your dreams,</p>
<p>you can set your alarm so that you wake up</p>
<p>in the middle of one of these 90 minute cycles,</p>
<p>which toward morning tend to be occupied</p>
<p>almost exclusively by REM sleep.</p>
<p>Remember early in the night,</p>
<p>you have less REM sleep than later in the night,</p>
<p>but you want to get as much sleep as you can</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s healthy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know that you want to wake yourself up.</p>
<p>Some people find that writing down their thoughts</p>
<p>immediately first thing in the morning</p>
<p>allows them to later spontaneously</p>
<p>remember their dream they had.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some literature on that.</p>
<p>The meaning of dreams is a little bit controversial.</p>
<p>Some people believe they have strong meaning.</p>
<p>Other people believe that they can be</p>
<p>just spontaneous firing of neurons</p>
<p>that were active in the waking state</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have any meaning.</p>
<p>There are good data to show</p>
<p>that when you learn new spatial environments,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a replay of those environments,</p>
<p>so-called place cells that fire in your brain</p>
<p>only when you enter a particular environment,</p>
<p>that those are replayed in sleep</p>
<p>in almost direct fashion to the way that</p>
<p>things were activated</p>
<p>when you were learning that spatial task.</p>
<p>Dreams are fascinating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re paralyzed during dreams,</p>
<p>which brings us to another question.</p>
<p>Somebody asked about sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>We are paralyzed for much of our sleep, so-called atonia,</p>
<p>presumably so we don&rsquo;t act out our dreams.</p>
<p>Some people wake up and they&rsquo;re still paralyzed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had this happen to me,</p>
<p>not very many times, but a few times,</p>
<p>and then they jolt themselves awake.</p>
<p>And it actually is quite terrifying,</p>
<p>I can say from personal experience,</p>
<p>to wake up, be wide awake,</p>
<p>and you cannot move your body at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite frightening.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that will increase</p>
<p>the intrusion of atonia into the wakeful state,</p>
<p>which is essentially means you&rsquo;re waking up,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>One is marijuana, THC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a marijuana smoker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a cop, or I don&rsquo;t know the legality where you live,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not saying one thing or another about marijuana.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, the fact that I had that experience</p>
<p>without marijuana means that it can happen regardless.</p>
<p>But marijuana smokers, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>maybe it has something to do with the cannabinoid receptors</p>
<p>or the serotonin receptors</p>
<p>downstream of the motor pathways.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any literature on this,</p>
<p>but marijuana smokers report higher frequency</p>
<p>of this kind of paralysis and wakefulness</p>
<p>as you transition from sleep to wakefulness.</p>
<p>I suppose probably one could learn</p>
<p>to get comfortable with it.</p>
<p>For me, it was terrifying,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just used to being able</p>
<p>to move my limbs, fortunately,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t able to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite a thing, let me tell you.</p>
<p>Okay, some other questions about neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So the other form of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>is not the neuroplasticity that you&rsquo;re amplifying</p>
<p>by listening to tones or smelling odors in sleep,</p>
<p>but the neuroplasticity that you can access</p>
<p>with non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>So NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>as well as short 20-minute naps,</p>
<p>which are very close to non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>because people rarely drop into deep states of sleep</p>
<p>during short naps, unless they&rsquo;re very sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>NSDR has been shown to increase rates of learning</p>
<p>when done for 20-minute bouts</p>
<p>to match an approximately 90-minute bout of learning.</p>
<p>So what am I talking about?</p>
<p>90-minute cycles are these ultradian cycles</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about previously,</p>
<p>and we tend to learn very well</p>
<p>by taking a 90-minute cycle,</p>
<p>transitioning into some focus mode early in the cycle</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s hard to focus,</p>
<p>and then deep focus and learning</p>
<p>feels almost like agitation and strain,</p>
<p>and then by the end of that 90-minute cycle,</p>
<p>it becomes very hard to maintain focus</p>
<p>and learn more information.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study published in Cell Reports last year,</p>
<p>great journal, excellent paper,</p>
<p>showing that 20-minute naps or light sleep</p>
<p>of the sort of non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>taken immediately after or close to,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be immediately</p>
<p>after you finish the last sentence of learning</p>
<p>or whatever it is or bar of music,</p>
<p>but a couple minutes after transitioning</p>
<p>to a period of non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re turning off the analysis</p>
<p>of duration, path, and outcome</p>
<p>has been shown to accelerate learning</p>
<p>to a significant degree,</p>
<p>both the amount of information</p>
<p>and the retention of that information.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty cool because this is a cost-free,</p>
<p>drug-free way of accelerating learning</p>
<p>without having to get more sleep,</p>
<p>but simply by introducing these 20-minute bouts.</p>
<p>I would encourage people if they want to try this</p>
<p>to consider the 20 minutes per every 90 minutes</p>
<p>of ultradian learning cycle.</p>
<p>There, you&rsquo;re incorporating a number</p>
<p>of different neuroscience-backed tools,</p>
<p>90-minute cycles for focused learning.</p>
<p>It could be motor, it could be cognitive,</p>
<p>could be musical, whatever,</p>
<p>and then transition to a 20-minute</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest protocol.</p>
<p>Just want to cue you to the fact that in last episode</p>
<p>in the caption on YouTube,</p>
<p>we provided links to two different yoga nidra</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest protocols,</p>
<p>as well as hypnosis protocols that are clinically backed</p>
<p>from my colleague, David Spiegel</p>
<p>at Stanford&rsquo;s psychiatry department.</p>
<p>All those resources are free.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of other hypnosis scripts out there.</p>
<p>I like the ones from Michael Sealy, S-E-A-L.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s E-Y, although maybe it&rsquo;s just L-Y.</p>
<p>You can find them easily on YouTube,</p>
<p>clinical hypnosis scripts, meaning not stage hypnosis.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not designed to get you to do anything.</p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;re just designed</p>
<p>to help rewire your brain circuitry.</p>
<p>Now, how does hypnosis work that way?</p>
<p>This has a lot to do with sleep</p>
<p>because it engages neuroplasticity</p>
<p>by bringing together two things</p>
<p>that normally are separate from one another.</p>
<p>One is the alert, focused, wakeful state</p>
<p>where you activate the learning,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the deep rest</p>
<p>where the actual reconfiguration of the neurons</p>
<p>and synapses takes place.</p>
<p>Hypnosis brings both the focus</p>
<p>and the deep rest component into the same</p>
<p>compartment of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very unique state in that way.</p>
<p>So hypnosis kind of maximizes the learning bout</p>
<p>and the non-sleep deep rest bout and combines them.</p>
<p>But of course, that requires some guidance</p>
<p>from a script or from a hypnotist,</p>
<p>clinically trained hypnotist,</p>
<p>and it becomes hard to acquire detailed information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about shifts in state,</p>
<p>like fear to states of calm</p>
<p>or quitting smoking,</p>
<p>anxiety around a trauma to release of anxiety</p>
<p>around a trauma,</p>
<p>rather than specific information learned in hypnosis, okay?</p>
<p>So hypnosis seems more about modulating the circuits</p>
<p>that underlie state as opposed to specific information.</p>
<p>Although I would not be surprised</p>
<p>if there weren&rsquo;t certain forms of hypnosis</p>
<p>that could increase retention</p>
<p>and learning of specific information,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not aware of any of those protocols out there yet,</p>
<p>which brings us to the next thing</p>
<p>about learning and plasticity,</p>
<p>which is nootropics, AKA smart drugs.</p>
<p>This is a big topic.</p>
<p>That sigh was a sigh of concern</p>
<p>about how to address nootropics in a thorough enough,</p>
<p>but thoughtful enough way.</p>
<p>Look, I have a lot of thoughts about nootropics.</p>
<p>First of all, it means smart drugs, I believe.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like that phrase</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s just take a step back</p>
<p>and think about exercise.</p>
<p>You just say, I want to be more physically fit.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Does it mean, I would ask for more specificity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, do you want to be stronger?</p>
<p>Okay, maybe you need to lift heavier objects progressively.</p>
<p>Do you want more endurance?</p>
<p>Very different protocol to access endurance.</p>
<p>Do you want flexibility?</p>
<p>Do you want explosiveness or suppleness?</p>
<p>Huge range of things that we call physical fitness.</p>
<p>Maybe you want all of those.</p>
<p>If we were talking about emotional fitness,</p>
<p>we would say, well, an ability to feel empathy,</p>
<p>but probably also to disengage from empathy</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to be tethered</p>
<p>to other people&rsquo;s emotions all the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not healthy either.</p>
<p>You would think about being able to access</p>
<p>a range of emotions, but for some people,</p>
<p>their range into the sadness regime is really quite vast,</p>
<p>but their range into the happiness regime</p>
<p>might be kind of limited.</p>
<p>For other people who are in a manic state,</p>
<p>it might be they can access all the happy stuff,</p>
<p>but not the sadder stuff.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m speaking by way of analogy here,</p>
<p>but if we say, we&rsquo;re talking about cognitive abilities,</p>
<p>we have to ask, okay, creativity, memory.</p>
<p>We tend to associate intelligence with memory.</p>
<p>I think this goes back to like spelling bees or something,</p>
<p>the ability to retain a lot of information</p>
<p>and just regurgitate information,</p>
<p>which will get you some distance in some disciplines of life,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t allow you creative thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessary for creative thinking.</p>
<p>You need a knowledge base, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just look up everything on Google</p>
<p>despite what certain educators or so-called educators say.</p>
<p>You need a database so that you could have</p>
<p>the raw materials with which to be creative.</p>
<p>So necessary to have memory,</p>
<p>but not sufficient to be creative, right?</p>
<p>The creative could have a poor memory for certain things,</p>
<p>but certainly not for everything.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t have interrogate and retrograde amnesia.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like the goldfish</p>
<p>that every time around the tank,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t remember where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>that experiment by the way,</p>
<p>but so no disrespect to goldfish, but you know.</p>
<p>So you get the idea, you&rsquo;ve got creativity,</p>
<p>you have memory, you have the ability to task switch, right?</p>
<p>You have the ability to strategy develop</p>
<p>and strategy implement.</p>
<p>So the problem I have with the concept of a nootropic</p>
<p>or a smart drug is it&rsquo;s not specific</p>
<p>as to what cognitive algorithm you&rsquo;re trying to engage.</p>
<p>We need more specificity.</p>
<p>That said, there are elements to learning</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve discussed here before that are very concrete.</p>
<p>Things like the ability to focus and put the blinders</p>
<p>onto everything else that&rsquo;s happening around you</p>
<p>and in your head mainly, right?</p>
<p>Distractions about things you should be doing,</p>
<p>could be doing, or might be doing</p>
<p>and focus on what you need to do.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s required for triggering</p>
<p>that acetylcholine neuromodulator</p>
<p>that will then allow you to highlight</p>
<p>the particular synapses that will then later change</p>
<p>in sleep.</p>
<p>So nootropic allows you to bypass the need</p>
<p>for sleep and deep rest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important to understand.</p>
<p>So I daydream about a day</p>
<p>when people will be able to access compounds that are safe,</p>
<p>that will allow them to learn better,</p>
<p>meaning to access information, focus better,</p>
<p>as well as to sleep better and activate the plasticity</p>
<p>from the learning bout.</p>
<p>Right now, most nootropics tend to bundle</p>
<p>a bunch of things together.</p>
<p>Most of them include some form of stimulant, caffeine.</p>
<p>Episode two, I tell you more probably</p>
<p>than you ever wanted to know about caffeine,</p>
<p>adenosine and how that works.</p>
<p>So refer there for how caffeine works.</p>
<p>But stimulants will allow you to increase focus</p>
<p>up to a particular point.</p>
<p>If you have too little alertness in your system,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t focus too much.</p>
<p>However, you start to cliff and focus drifts, okay?</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t just ingest more stimulant to be more focused.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>Most nootropics also include things that increase</p>
<p>or are designed to increase acetylcholine,</p>
<p>things like alpha-GPC and other things of that sort.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that they can increase acetylcholine.</p>
<p>I refer you again to examine.com, the website,</p>
<p>to evaluate any supplements or compounds for their safety</p>
<p>and their effects in humans and animals.</p>
<p>Free website, as well as with links to studies.</p>
<p>So we need the focus component.</p>
<p>We need the alertness component.</p>
<p>The alertness component comes from epinephrine,</p>
<p>traditionally from caffeine stimulation.</p>
<p>The acetylcholine stimulation traditionally comes</p>
<p>from choline donors or alpha-GPC, things of that sort.</p>
<p>And then you would want to have some sort of off switch</p>
<p>because anything that&rsquo;s going to really stimulate</p>
<p>your alertness that then provides a crash,</p>
<p>that crash is not a crash into the deep kind</p>
<p>of restful slumber that you would want for learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crash into the kind of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call it lopsided sleep,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s deep sleep, but it lacks certain spindles</p>
<p>and other elements of the physiology, sleep spindles,</p>
<p>that really engage the learning process</p>
<p>and the reconfiguration of synapses.</p>
<p>So right now, my stance on nootropics</p>
<p>is that maybe, maybe for occasional use,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s safe for you, I&rsquo;m not recommending it,</p>
<p>but in general, it tends to use more of a shotgun approach</p>
<p>than is probably going to be useful</p>
<p>for learning and memory in the long run.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask about modafinil or armodafinil,</p>
<p>which was designed for treatment of narcolepsy.</p>
<p>So right there, it tells you it&rsquo;s a stimulant.</p>
<p>And yes, there is evidence</p>
<p>it will improve learning and memory.</p>
<p>Modafinil is very expensive.</p>
<p>Last time I checked, armodafinil, I think,</p>
<p>is the recent released generic version of this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s far less expensive.</p>
<p>Most of these things look a lot like amphetamine,</p>
<p>and many of them have the potential for addiction</p>
<p>or it can be habit-forming, but more importantly,</p>
<p>a lot of those things also can create metabolic effects</p>
<p>by disruption to insulin receptors and so forth.</p>
<p>So you want to approach those</p>
<p>with a strong sense of caution.</p>
<p>Now, there are the milder things that act as nootropics.</p>
<p>I mentioned some of them, like alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>Some people like ginkgo.</p>
<p>Ginkgo gives me vicious headaches, so I don&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>So, you know, people really differ.</p>
<p>Last podcast, I recommended magnesium threonate</p>
<p>if you were exploring supplements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending anything directly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying if you&rsquo;re exploring supplements,</p>
<p>magnesium threonate seems, among the magnesiums,</p>
<p>to be one of the more bioavailable and useful for sleep.</p>
<p>I recommended it actually to a good friend of mine.</p>
<p>It gave him, at very low dose, he had stomach issues with it.</p>
<p>He just had to simply stop taking it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s variability there.</p>
<p>It gave him some stomach cramping</p>
<p>and just didn&rsquo;t feel good on it.</p>
<p>Stopped it, he felt better.</p>
<p>Other people take magnesium threonate and feel great.</p>
<p>I was asked, do magnesium need to be taken</p>
<p>with or without food, daytime or before sleep?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go that route,</p>
<p>it should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before sleep</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s designed to make you sleepy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not aware that it has to be taken with food,</p>
<p>but again, all of this has to be run by your doctor</p>
<p>and this is your healthcare to govern.</p>
<p>These are not strict recommendations, so look into it.</p>
<p>But magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>most people I&rsquo;ve recommended it to</p>
<p>have benefit from it tremendously.</p>
<p>Some people can&rsquo;t tolerate it, so you have to find out.</p>
<p>There were a number of questions about other supplements</p>
<p>designed to access deep sleep,</p>
<p>in part to access neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m just sort of transitioning</p>
<p>from neuroplasticity to these compounds</p>
<p>that can regulate sleep.</p>
<p>One of them that I discussed at the end of the last podcast,</p>
<p>I got a lot of questions about is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N.</p>
<p>Apigenin, if you look in the literature,</p>
<p>the way it works is it increases some of the enzymes</p>
<p>associated with GABA metabolism.</p>
<p>It actually, GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the neurotransmitter that is increased</p>
<p>after a couple drinks containing alcohol</p>
<p>and that shut down the forebrain.</p>
<p>Apigenin is a derivative of the chamomile.</p>
<p>I think that the proper pronunciation of this</p>
<p>is matricaria chamomila,</p>
<p>although I always feel like I should be using</p>
<p>a Spanish accent whenever I say something like that.</p>
<p>Other related things that impact the GABA system</p>
<p>and increase GABA are things like passion flower,</p>
<p>which is passiflora incurata.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the Italian, is that Italian?</p>
<p>Anyway, my Italian colleagues, please forgive me.</p>
<p>I have some very close Italian friends</p>
<p>and colleagues in Genoa.</p>
<p>I butchered the Italian, sorry.</p>
<p>In any event, apigenin and passion flower</p>
<p>found in a lot of supplements</p>
<p>designed to increase sleepiness and sleep</p>
<p>and they work presumably because they increase GABA.</p>
<p>Actually, they work on chloride channels</p>
<p>rather than give you a whole lecture</p>
<p>on membrane biophysics and neurons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say that when neurons are really active,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because sodium ions, salt,</p>
<p>rushes into the cells and causes them to fire electrically.</p>
<p>The cells tend to become less active as more chloride,</p>
<p>which is a negatively charged ion.</p>
<p>This is probably taking some of you back</p>
<p>to either the wonderful times or traumas</p>
<p>of high school physics.</p>
<p>The chloride is negatively charged,</p>
<p>so it tends to make cells less electrically positive</p>
<p>because it carries a negative charge</p>
<p>and hyperpolarizes the neuron.</p>
<p>So apigenin works through these,</p>
<p>increasing the activity of these chloride channels.</p>
<p>Passion flower works by increasing</p>
<p>the activity of these chloride channels</p>
<p>and GABA transmission.</p>
<p>It tends to increase this inhibitory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that shuts off our thinking,</p>
<p>our analysis of duration, path, and outcome.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to explore these things,</p>
<p>I suggest you at least know how they work.</p>
<p>You at least go to examine.com,</p>
<p>that you talk to your doctor about them.</p>
<p>Some people asked about serotonin</p>
<p>for getting to sleep and staying asleep.</p>
<p>Now, I understand the rationale here,</p>
<p>just like I understand the rationale</p>
<p>of taking something like mucunipurines or L-DOPA</p>
<p>to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>But sometimes what works on paper</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really work in the real world.</p>
<p>I personally have tried taking a supplement,</p>
<p>which was L-tryptophan,</p>
<p>which is the precursor to serotonin,</p>
<p>or 5-HTP, which is designed to increase.</p>
<p>It is serotonin, basically.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just one biochemical step away</p>
<p>from taking actual serotonin.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be honest,</p>
<p>the sleep that I had with increased serotonin</p>
<p>by way of tryptophan or 5-HTP was dreadful.</p>
<p>I fell asleep almost immediately.</p>
<p>You say, well, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And 90 minutes later, I woke up</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep almost for 48 hours.</p>
<p>Now, that was me.</p>
<p>I have a pretty sensitive system to certain things</p>
<p>and not to other things.</p>
<p>Some people love these things.</p>
<p>So you really have to be thoughtful and explore them</p>
<p>with that kind of awareness of being thoughtful</p>
<p>and realizing that what works for you</p>
<p>might not work for everybody</p>
<p>and what works for everybody might not work for you.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;d like to continue</p>
<p>by talking about the role of temperature</p>
<p>in sleep, accessing sleep, staying asleep, and wakefulness.</p>
<p>But first I want to tell a joke</p>
<p>because I think this joke really captures</p>
<p>some of the critical things to understand</p>
<p>about any self-experimentation that you might do.</p>
<p>So this is a story that was told to me</p>
<p>by a colleague of mine who&rsquo;s now a professor of Caltech,</p>
<p>not to be named.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a scientist and they&rsquo;re in their lab</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to understand</p>
<p>how the nervous system works.</p>
<p>So they go over to a tank and they pick up a frog</p>
<p>and they take the frog and they put it down on the table</p>
<p>and they clap and the frog jumps.</p>
<p>So they think for a while and they pick up the frog.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They go over to the cabinet</p>
<p>and they take out a little bit of a paralytic drug</p>
<p>and they inject it locally into the back leg,</p>
<p>set it down and clap and the frog jumps,</p>
<p>but it kind of like jumps to the side a little bit.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, they pick it up.</p>
<p>They inject the paralytic into the other back leg.</p>
<p>They clap again.</p>
<p>The frog jumps, but it really doesn&rsquo;t jump well that time.</p>
<p>It kind of drags itself forward.</p>
<p>So they pick it up and they inject the paralytic</p>
<p>into the remaining two legs.</p>
<p>They set it down and they clap and the frog doesn&rsquo;t jump.</p>
<p>They go, oh my goodness.</p>
<p>The legs are used for hearing.</p>
<p>Now they publish the paper.</p>
<p>Paper comes out in a great journal, news releases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really big deal.</p>
<p>Their career takes off.</p>
<p>20 years later, a really smart graduate student</p>
<p>comes along and says, yeah, but that&rsquo;s loss of function.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really show gain of function.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>
<p>So they repeat the first experiment and it checks out.</p>
<p>Everything happens the same way.</p>
<p>But then they take the frog</p>
<p>and they inject a drug into all four legs</p>
<p>that turns off the paralytic, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an antagonist.</p>
<p>They set the frog down, they clap and the frog jumps.</p>
<p>They go, oh my goodness, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The legs really are for hearing.</p>
<p>Now, first of all, I want to make the point</p>
<p>that this is not to illustrate</p>
<p>that science is not a good practice.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>We need to do loss of function</p>
<p>and gain in function experiments.</p>
<p>But just to show that correlation</p>
<p>and causation is complicated,</p>
<p>you need to do a variety of control experiments</p>
<p>and you really need to figure out what works for you.</p>
<p>And so while science can provide answers</p>
<p>about what works under very controlled conditions,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t and can never address all the situations</p>
<p>in which a given compound, a given practice</p>
<p>will or won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just individual variability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that there are a number of different factors.</p>
<p>You all of course know that light can activate</p>
<p>and shift your circadian rhythm,</p>
<p>but so can exercise, so can food.</p>
<p>The last point I want to make is an important one,</p>
<p>which is that no frogs were hurt</p>
<p>in the telling of this joke.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s continue.</p>
<p>I want to talk about temperature.</p>
<p>Temperature is super interesting</p>
<p>as it relates to circadian rhythms</p>
<p>and wakefulness and sleep.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>to our body temperature across each 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>In general, our temperature tends to be lowest</p>
<p>right around 4 a.m. and starts creeping up</p>
<p>around 6 a.m., 8 a.m. and peaks sometime</p>
<p>between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Now, that varies from person to person,</p>
<p>but in general, if we were to continuously monitor</p>
<p>or occasionally monitor temperature,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we would see.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting is that even in the absence</p>
<p>of any light cues or meal cues, we would have a shift.</p>
<p>We would have an oscillation or a rhythm</p>
<p>in our temperature that would go from high to low.</p>
<p>This is why the idea that we&rsquo;re all 96.8</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s our correct temperature, forget that.</p>
<p>That is no longer true.</p>
<p>It never was true.</p>
<p>It depends on what time of day you measure temperature.</p>
<p>However, there is a range, which is within normal range.</p>
<p>I think most of us associate fever</p>
<p>with somewhere around 100, 101, 103.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s concerning.</p>
<p>And we will be very concerned</p>
<p>if temperature dropped too low as well.</p>
<p>The way that the temperature rhythm that&rsquo;s endogenous,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s within us and rhythmic no matter what,</p>
<p>the way it gets anchored to the pattern I described before</p>
<p>of being lowest at 4 a.m. and increasing again</p>
<p>around through the day until about 4 to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>is by way of entrainment or matching to some external cue,</p>
<p>which is almost always going to be light, but also exercise.</p>
<p>Now, you may have experienced this temperature rhythm</p>
<p>and how quickly it can become unentrained</p>
<p>or it can fall out of entrainment.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an experiment I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to do,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve probably experienced this before,</p>
<p>where you wake up, it&rsquo;s sunny outside,</p>
<p>and maybe you have some email or some things to take care of,</p>
<p>or maybe you didn&rsquo;t sleep that well the night before,</p>
<p>and so you stay indoors.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t change anything about your breakfast.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t change anything</p>
<p>about your within home temperature or anything like that.</p>
<p>And somewhere right around 10 or 11 o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>you start feeling kind of chilled, like you&rsquo;re cold.</p>
<p>Well, what happened was the oscillators,</p>
<p>the clocks in your various tissues</p>
<p>that are governed by temperature and circadian rhythm</p>
<p>are starting to split away</p>
<p>from your central clock mechanisms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually important</p>
<p>that your temperature match day length.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another way in which temperature matches,</p>
<p>or daytime, excuse me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an important way</p>
<p>in which temperature matches day length.</p>
<p>In general, as days get longer, it tends to be hotter out.</p>
<p>Not always, but in general, that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>And as days get shorter, it tends to be colder outside.</p>
<p>So temperature and day length are also linked,</p>
<p>metabolically they&rsquo;re linked,</p>
<p>biologically they&rsquo;re linked, excuse me,</p>
<p>and atmospherically they&rsquo;re linked</p>
<p>for the reasons that we talked about before</p>
<p>about duration of day length</p>
<p>and other climate features and so forth.</p>
<p>So one of the most powerful things</p>
<p>about setting your circadian rhythm properly</p>
<p>is that your temperature will start to fall</p>
<p>into a regular rhythm.</p>
<p>And that temperature has a very strong effect</p>
<p>on things like metabolism</p>
<p>and when you will feel most willing</p>
<p>and interested in exercising.</p>
<p>Typically, the willingness to exercise and engage</p>
<p>in any kind of activity, mental or physical,</p>
<p>is going to be when that rise in temperature is steepest,</p>
<p>when the slope of that line is greatest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why 30 minutes after waking</p>
<p>is one of those key windows,</p>
<p>as well as three hours after waking,</p>
<p>and then when temperature actually peaks,</p>
<p>which is generally, generally,</p>
<p>about 11 hours after waking.</p>
<p>So this is why we say that temperature</p>
<p>and circadian rhythm are linked,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually even more linked than that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked before about how light enters the eye,</p>
<p>triggers activation of these melanopsin cells,</p>
<p>which then triggers activation</p>
<p>of the suprachiasmatic nucleus,</p>
<p>the master circadian clock.</p>
<p>And then I always say the master circadian clock</p>
<p>informs all the cells and tissues of your body</p>
<p>and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve never answered</p>
<p>was how it actually puts them into that rhythm.</p>
<p>And it does it two ways.</p>
<p>One is it secretes a peptide.</p>
<p>A peptide is just a little protein</p>
<p>that floats through the bloodstream</p>
<p>and signals to the cells,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re tuning your clock,</p>
<p>kind of like a little, you know, in a watch store,</p>
<p>the watch store owner would tune the clocks.</p>
<p>But the other way is it synchronizes the temperature</p>
<p>under which those cells exist.</p>
<p>So temperature is actually the effector</p>
<p>of the circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Now, this is really important</p>
<p>because changes in temperature by way of exercise,</p>
<p>by way of eating, but especially by way of exercise</p>
<p>can start to shift our circadian rhythm pretty dramatically.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s even go to a more extreme example.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s some interest in cold showers</p>
<p>and ice baths.</p>
<p>Not everybody is doing this, I realize.</p>
<p>People seem to either love this or hate this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind the cold dunk thing.</p>
<p>I get regular about this from time to time and I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been doing it recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always painful to do the first couple of times</p>
<p>and then you get kind of used to it.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve taken people to a cold dunk or an ice bath.</p>
<p>I have a family member</p>
<p>who wouldn&rsquo;t get in literally past her toes.</p>
<p>She was like, this is just too aversive for me.</p>
<p>Some people really like the cold, people very tremendously.</p>
<p>Getting into an ice bath is very interesting</p>
<p>because you have a rebound increase in thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Now you should know from the previous episode</p>
<p>that as that temperature increases,</p>
<p>it will shift your circadian rhythm</p>
<p>and which direction it shifts your circadian rhythm</p>
<p>will depend on whether or not you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>during the daytime or late in the day.</p>
<p>If you do it after 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to make your day longer, right?</p>
<p>Because your body and your central clocks</p>
<p>are used to temperature going up early in the day</p>
<p>and throughout the day and peaking in the afternoon.</p>
<p>If you then increase that further</p>
<p>or you simply increase it over its baseline at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>after temperature was already falling,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just by a half a degree or a couple of degrees</p>
<p>or you do that with exercise,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be with the ice bath,</p>
<p>you are extending, you are shifting forward.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re phase delaying your clock.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re convincing your clock</p>
<p>and therefore the rest of your body</p>
<p>that the day is still going, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving it the perception,</p>
<p>the cellular and physiological perception</p>
<p>that the day is getting longer</p>
<p>and you will want to naturally stay up later</p>
<p>and wake up later.</p>
<p>Now you might say, wait, I do an ice bath late at night</p>
<p>and I feel great and I fall deeply asleep.</p>
<p>Well, cold can trigger the release of melatonin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a rebound increase in melatonin.</p>
<p>So that could be the cause of that effect.</p>
<p>You have to see what works for you.</p>
<p>But if you do the ice bath early in the day</p>
<p>and then get out, you will experience a more rapid rise</p>
<p>or cold shower early in the day,</p>
<p>a more rapid rise in your body temperature</p>
<p>that will phase advance your clock</p>
<p>and make it easier to get up early the following day.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are having trouble getting up,</p>
<p>and this is going to almost sound laughable,</p>
<p>but a cold shower first thing in the morning</p>
<p>will wake you up,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s waking you up in the short term</p>
<p>because of a different mechanism,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>but it also is shifting your clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s phase advancing your clock</p>
<p>in a way that makes you more likely</p>
<p>to get up earlier the next day, okay?</p>
<p>So in other words, increasing your temperature</p>
<p>by getting in an ice bath or cold shower,</p>
<p>or exercising, which causes a compensatory increase</p>
<p>in body temperature.</p>
<p>Think about the normal pattern of body temperature,</p>
<p>low around 4.35 AM, starts to peak right around waking,</p>
<p>excuse me, starts to increase right around waking,</p>
<p>then steep slope, steep slope to a peak</p>
<p>around four to 6 PM and then drops off.</p>
<p>If you introduce an increase in body temperature</p>
<p>by way of cold exposure early in the day,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 6 AM or 5 AM,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re masochistic enough to get into a cold shower</p>
<p>at that time, more power to you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to make you want to wake up</p>
<p>about half hour to an hour earlier the next day</p>
<p>than you normally would.</p>
<p>Whereas if you do it while your temperature is falling,</p>
<p>it will tend to delay and make your body perceive</p>
<p>as if the day is getting longer.</p>
<p>These are phase advances and phase delays.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get into this in far more detail</p>
<p>when we talk about jet lag and shift work in episode four,</p>
<p>as well as other things.</p>
<p>But temperature is, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just one tool to manipulate wake up time</p>
<p>and circadian rhythm and metabolism.</p>
<p>It is the effector.</p>
<p>It is the way that the central circadian clock</p>
<p>impacts all the cells and tissues of your body.</p>
<p>If you want to read further about this,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really curious about the role of temperature,</p>
<p>work by Joe Takahashi,</p>
<p>who used to be at Northwestern University</p>
<p>and is now at UT Southwestern in Dallas,</p>
<p>incredible scientist,</p>
<p>and has really worked out a lot of the mechanisms</p>
<p>around temperature and circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>You can just Google his name</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see a whole bunch of studies there.</p>
<p>I want to talk about cold and cold exposure</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a great misconception about this</p>
<p>that actually you can leverage once you understand</p>
<p>how to use cold to either increase thermogenesis</p>
<p>and fat loss metabolism,</p>
<p>or you can use it for stress mitigation and mood.</p>
<p>And it really depends on one simple feature</p>
<p>of how you approach the ice bath or cold shower.</p>
<p>If you get into an ice bath or cold shower</p>
<p>and you are calming yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actively calming the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>maybe through some deep breathing,</p>
<p>maybe through visualization,</p>
<p>maybe you sing a song, you know, people do this stuff.</p>
<p>They use various tools.</p>
<p>Some people find paying attention</p>
<p>to an external stimulus is more helpful.</p>
<p>You know, thinking about something</p>
<p>not the experience of the cold.</p>
<p>Other people find that directly experiencing the cold</p>
<p>in its most intense form</p>
<p>and kind of going into the cold, quote unquote,</p>
<p>is the best way to approach it.</p>
<p>It really varies for people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no right or wrong way to go about this.</p>
<p>But the goal of using cold exposure for stress inoculation</p>
<p>and to raise your stress threshold</p>
<p>to be able to tolerate heightened levels</p>
<p>of real life stress, not the ice bath,</p>
<p>but real life stress like work stress</p>
<p>and relational stress, et cetera,</p>
<p>is by suppressing the activation</p>
<p>of the so-called sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>meaning the alertness or stress system.</p>
<p>That involves buffering</p>
<p>or trying to resist the shiver response.</p>
<p>The shiver response is an autonomic response</p>
<p>designed to generate heat, presumably,</p>
<p>and actually that is what it does,</p>
<p>in order to counter the cold.</p>
<p>So when you use cold exposure</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of muscling through it</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re learning to relax within it</p>
<p>as a form of stress inoculation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great and works quite well for that purpose.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason why cold exposure is used</p>
<p>in a variety of forms of military stress inoculation,</p>
<p>most famous of which, of course,</p>
<p>is the Navy SEAL BUDS test, really,</p>
<p>which is screening procedure for becoming a SEAL,</p>
<p>involves a lot of exposure to cold water.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re interested in using cold exposure</p>
<p>for fat loss and thermogenesis,</p>
<p>you want to do the exact opposite thing.</p>
<p>There was a paper published in Nature two years ago,</p>
<p>which showed that cold-induced shiver,</p>
<p>the actual physical shiver,</p>
<p>activates the release of a chemical in the body</p>
<p>from muscle called succinate, S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E.</p>
<p>Succinate travels in the bloodstream</p>
<p>and then goes and activates a particular category of fat,</p>
<p>not the typical kind of pink or white fat</p>
<p>that we think of as like blubber in humans,</p>
<p>the stuff that people seem to generally want less of,</p>
<p>except for those genetic freaks</p>
<p>that seem to have none of it,</p>
<p>depending on what they consume, congratulations.</p>
<p>Brown fat is called brown fat</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually dark under the microscope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rich with mitochondria</p>
<p>and it exists mostly between the scapulae</p>
<p>and in the upper neck.</p>
<p>And it generates thermogenesis and heat in the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rich with a certain category of adrenergic receptor.</p>
<p>Incidentally, epinephrine binds to adrenergic receptors.</p>
<p>These brown fat cells increase metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called brown fat thermogenesis and cause fat burning,</p>
<p>burning of other kinds of fat, the pink and white fat.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean?</p>
<p>This means if you want to use the ice bath</p>
<p>in order to increase metabolism, shiver away.</p>
<p>If you want to use the ice bath or cold shower</p>
<p>in order to stress inoculate, resist the shiver</p>
<p>and learn to stay calm or quote unquote muscle through it.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know that anyone&rsquo;s ever really talked</p>
<p>about this publicly because I think the data are so new.</p>
<p>And I think that people assume</p>
<p>that the ice bath or cold exposure is just one thing.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;ve talked about it three ways</p>
<p>to shift your circadian rhythm</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re doing it early in the day</p>
<p>while your temperature is still rising or at its peak</p>
<p>or after that peak in order to extend the perception</p>
<p>of your day as continuing and make you want</p>
<p>to go to sleep later and wake up later.</p>
<p>Now, and then the third way of course</p>
<p>is to either activate brown fat thermogenesis</p>
<p>and increase metabolism.</p>
<p>I suppose the fourth way would be</p>
<p>to increase stress tolerance or stress threshold.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But remember, temperature is the effector</p>
<p>of circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Light is the trigger.</p>
<p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master circadian clock</p>
<p>that mediates all these changes.</p>
<p>Also influenced by non-photic influence</p>
<p>like exercise and feeding and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But temperature is the effector.</p>
<p>Now, you can also shift your circadian rhythm with eating.</p>
<p>When you travel and you land in a new location</p>
<p>and your schedule is inverted 12 hours,</p>
<p>one way that we know you can shift your rhythm more quickly</p>
<p>is to get onto the local meal schedule.</p>
<p>Now, that probably has to do with two effects.</p>
<p>One are changes in temperature,</p>
<p>eating-induced increases in body temperature.</p>
<p>Now you should understand why that would work.</p>
<p>As well as eating has this anticipatory secretion</p>
<p>of beta, of hypocretin orexin</p>
<p>that I talked about it earlier.</p>
<p>So if this is getting a little too down in the weeds,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>I will get more into this in episode four</p>
<p>of how to shift one&rsquo;s rhythm.</p>
<p>But I would love for people to understand</p>
<p>that light and temperature are the real heavy duty levers</p>
<p>when it comes to moving your circadian rhythm</p>
<p>and sleep times and activity schedules.</p>
<p>And exercise and feeding can help,</p>
<p>but really temperature and light</p>
<p>with light being the primary one are the most important</p>
<p>when it comes to sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>Many people asked questions about food and neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and how those relate to sleep, wakefulness and mood,</p>
<p>which is essentially 25 hours of content for me to cover.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to try and distill out</p>
<p>the most common questions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about neuromodulators</p>
<p>like dopamine, acetylcholine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>You may notice in those discussions</p>
<p>that the precursors to say serotonin is tryptophan.</p>
<p>Tryptophan actually comes from the diet.</p>
<p>It comes from the foods that we eat.</p>
<p>Tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>It comes from the foods that we eat.</p>
<p>And then once we ingest them,</p>
<p>that those compounds circulate</p>
<p>to a variety of different cells and tissues.</p>
<p>But it is true that our food</p>
<p>and the particular foods we eat can influence</p>
<p>things like neuromodulator levels to some extent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only way</p>
<p>because there are also enzymes and biochemical pathways</p>
<p>that are going to regulate how much tyrosine</p>
<p>gets converted into dopamine.</p>
<p>And there are elements of the dopaminergic neurons,</p>
<p>the dopamine neurons themselves that are electrical</p>
<p>that have influence on this as well.</p>
<p>But there are a couple fair assumptions that we can make.</p>
<p>First of all, nuts and meats in particular red meats</p>
<p>tend to be rich in things like tyrosine, right?</p>
<p>That tells you right there</p>
<p>that because tyrosine is the precursor of dopamine</p>
<p>and dopamine is the precursor of norepinephrine</p>
<p>and epinephrine,</p>
<p>that those foods tend to lend themselves</p>
<p>toward the production of dopamine and epinephrine</p>
<p>and the sorts of things</p>
<p>that are associated with wakefulness.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the volume of food that we eat</p>
<p>also impacts our wakefulness.</p>
<p>If we eat a lot of anything,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s ribeye steaks, rice or cardboard,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t eat cardboard,</p>
<p>your stomach if it&rsquo;s very distended</p>
<p>will draw a lot of blood into your gut</p>
<p>and you will divert blood from other tissues</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll become sleepy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about food content,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about food volume, all right?</p>
<p>Fasting states generally are associated</p>
<p>with more alertness, epinephrine and so forth.</p>
<p>And fed states are generally associated</p>
<p>with more quiescence and relaxation,</p>
<p>serotonin and the kind of things</p>
<p>that lend themselves more towards sleep</p>
<p>and less toward alertness.</p>
<p>Foods that are rich in tryptophan</p>
<p>tend to be things like white meat turkey</p>
<p>but also complex carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So if you like, you can start experimenting</p>
<p>depending on what foods you eat.</p>
<p>You can start experimenting with carbohydrate rich meals</p>
<p>for accessing sleep and more depth of sleep.</p>
<p>This is actually something I personally do.</p>
<p>I tend to eat pretty low carb-ish during the day.</p>
<p>I actually fast for until about noon,</p>
<p>not because I have to work to do that</p>
<p>but because I&rsquo;d rather just drink caffeine and water</p>
<p>during that time.</p>
<p>And then sometime around noon,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take it anymore and I&rsquo;m hungry</p>
<p>and I eat and I try and eat low carb-ish</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;ve worked out extremely hard</p>
<p>in the previous two hours, which I rarely do,</p>
<p>although I do sometimes.</p>
<p>And that meal is then designed to prolong</p>
<p>my period of wakefulness into the late afternoon.</p>
<p>And then sometime around dinnertime,</p>
<p>which for me is around 6.30, 7 p.m, 8 p.m,</p>
<p>sometimes as late as 9 p.m,</p>
<p>I tend to eat things like white meat, fish, pastas, rice,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>My favorite food of all for accessing tryptophan</p>
<p>is actually a starch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a vegetable, it&rsquo;s the croissant,</p>
<p>which is my favorite vegetable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat those all the time, but I love them.</p>
<p>And they seem to increase dopamine as well.</p>
<p>Never actually done the mass spectrometry on a croissant,</p>
<p>but they definitely increase tryptophan</p>
<p>and relaxation for me.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, low carbohydrate</p>
<p>slash fasted slash ketogenic diets</p>
<p>tend to lend themselves toward wakefulness</p>
<p>by way of increasing epinephrine, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline, dopamine, and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Carbohydrate-rich meals,</p>
<p>and I suppose we should talk about meals as opposed to diet,</p>
<p>tend to lend themselves more toward tryptophan, serotonin,</p>
<p>and more lethargic states.</p>
<p>There is very limited evidence that I am aware of</p>
<p>that carbohydrates should be eaten at one time a day</p>
<p>as it relates to metabolism, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that will open up a certain amount of debate.</p>
<p>If you work out very hard and you deplete glycogen,</p>
<p>then this all changes.</p>
<p>So some people are working out very hard</p>
<p>and depleting glycogen, other people are not.</p>
<p>That gets way outside the context</p>
<p>of this particular podcast.</p>
<p>But yes, indeed, different foods can bias</p>
<p>different neuromodulators and thereby can modulate</p>
<p>our waking or our feelings of lethargy and sleepiness.</p>
<p>There are a couple effects of food that are independent,</p>
<p>or I should say a couple effects of eating,</p>
<p>because the food won&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s sitting across the table,</p>
<p>but of eating that are powerful for modulating</p>
<p>circadian rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because every time we eat,</p>
<p>we get eating-induced thermogenesis</p>
<p>regardless of what we eat.</p>
<p>Now, the eating-induced thermogenesis</p>
<p>and increase in metabolism,</p>
<p>which is an increase in temperature, really,</p>
<p>is probably greatest for amino acid-rich foods like meats,</p>
<p>but also other types of foods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a minimal increase in body temperature</p>
<p>compared to, say, cold exposure or exercise.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not it&rsquo;s a quarter of a degree</p>
<p>or a half a degree or a degree,</p>
<p>it really depends on the individual.</p>
<p>And of course, there are blood sugar effects.</p>
<p>There are things like whether or not</p>
<p>you are type 1 or type 2 diabetic,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re insulin resistant,</p>
<p>whether or not, like, there&rsquo;s a kid</p>
<p>who interns on the podcast here who&rsquo;s 17 years old,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m convinced that he can eat anything,</p>
<p>and he just seems to burn it up, and he&rsquo;s growing.</p>
<p>Every time, actually, the other day,</p>
<p>he walked into the other room, and two days later,</p>
<p>he walked out of the same room.</p>
<p>He came out in between, of course,</p>
<p>but, and I was like, you grew.</p>
<p>He was like, you know, but he&rsquo;s at that stage</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s just growing.</p>
<p>Food is going to affect a teenager very differently</p>
<p>than it&rsquo;s going to affect a full-grown person.</p>
<p>So in general, starchy carbohydrates,</p>
<p>white meat such as turkey, some fish,</p>
<p>increased tryptophan, therefore serotonin,</p>
<p>therefore more lethargic states, more calm.</p>
<p>Meat, nuts, and there are probably some plant-based foods</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not aware of, and I apologize,</p>
<p>I should read up on this, that also are high in tyrosine</p>
<p>that can increase things like dopamine,</p>
<p>norepinephrine, epinephrine, alertness.</p>
<p>So you can vary these however you like.</p>
<p>Most people, I think, are eating a variety of these things</p>
<p>in given meals, and there are other parameters</p>
<p>of nutrition that are important too.</p>
<p>Volume of food, for the reason I mentioned before,</p>
<p>the volume of food in the gut.</p>
<p>Less food in the gut, whether or not it&rsquo;s empty</p>
<p>or a small amount of food,</p>
<p>will tend to correlate with wakefulness.</p>
<p>Large volumes of food of any kind</p>
<p>will tend to correlate and drive the calming response,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s by way of this nerve pathway called the vagus.</p>
<p>We actually have sensory fibers in the gut</p>
<p>that communicate to a little protrusion of neurons</p>
<p>that sit right next to the jugular</p>
<p>called the no-dose ganglia, N-O-D-O-S-E.</p>
<p>Unlike Costello, it&rsquo;s no-dose, right now he&rsquo;s all-dose.</p>
<p>No-dose actually means having many protrusions,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like kind of a lumpy collection of neurons.</p>
<p>A ganglia is just a collection of neurons,</p>
<p>and then it goes into the brain stem,</p>
<p>and then forward in the brain to the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in production of various neuromodulators.</p>
<p>So what we eat and the volume of food</p>
<p>are both signaling to the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one or the other.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also this eating-induced thermogenesis,</p>
<p>and now you know from the discussion about temperature</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re eating early in the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tending to shift your rhythm earlier</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;ll want to wake up earlier the next day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating very late in the day,</p>
<p>even if you can fall asleep after that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tendency for you</p>
<p>to want to sleep later the next day.</p>
<p>Now, this, of course, is all going to be constrained</p>
<p>by when your kids need to eat,</p>
<p>when your spouse needs to eat,</p>
<p>when your friends need to eat, or if you live alone,</p>
<p>or what other things you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me and you kind of don&rsquo;t eat until noon,</p>
<p>then eat sometime around noon,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m terrible about meals.</p>
<p>I just start eating the ingredients</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m supposed to be cooking,</p>
<p>and then eventually they&rsquo;re all gone,</p>
<p>and I guess that&rsquo;s a meal.</p>
<p>It varies.</p>
<p>Some people are neurotically attached</p>
<p>to a particular meal schedule.</p>
<p>Some people are not.</p>
<p>I take my light exposure schedule</p>
<p>far more seriously than I take my meal schedule,</p>
<p>although, in general, I try and eat healthy foods</p>
<p>for the most part, croissants included.</p>
<p>I was asked several times whether or not</p>
<p>men and women, or males and females,</p>
<p>differ in terms of these neurotransmitter phenotypes</p>
<p>and the rhythms of sleep and temperature.</p>
<p>You know, we could probably devote a whole month,</p>
<p>and we probably will devote an entire month</p>
<p>to what are called sex differences,</p>
<p>because those tend to be related to things</p>
<p>we absolutely know, like XX or XY chromosomes,</p>
<p>or XYY in some cases, or XX chromosomes,</p>
<p>as opposed to gender, sex, and karyotype, as we call it.</p>
<p>Genetic makeup is crystal clear.</p>
<p>There are things that correlate with one or the other,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s complicated, and it&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been explored in what I think is enough detail.</p>
<p>Actually, recently, I guess it was about five years ago,</p>
<p>the National Institutes of Health made it a mandate</p>
<p>that all studies use sex as a biological variable,</p>
<p>and actually explore both sexes of mice,</p>
<p>both sexes of humans when doing any kind of study,</p>
<p>because there was a bias towards only using male animals</p>
<p>or male subjects prior to that time.</p>
<p>So a lot of data are now coming out</p>
<p>revealing important sex differences</p>
<p>that I think are going to have powerful impact</p>
<p>on health practices, et cetera, response to drugs,</p>
<p>response to different sleep schedules, et cetera.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most salient and obvious one</p>
<p>is that during pregnancy,</p>
<p>females experience a whole range</p>
<p>of endocrine and neuro effects,</p>
<p>and we definitely will devote a month to pregnancy</p>
<p>and childbirth and child rearing.</p>
<p>And for that, I&rsquo;d really like to bring in some experts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got terrific colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere</p>
<p>that work on these things,</p>
<p>so that we can go into those in more depth.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not blowing off those questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kind of pushing them down on the road a little bit</p>
<p>where I can give you a more thorough answer.</p>
<p>So as we finish up,</p>
<p>I just want to offer you the opportunity to do an experiment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about a lot of variables</p>
<p>that can impact sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>And in keeping with the theme of the podcast,</p>
<p>we are going to continue to talk about sleep and wakefulness</p>
<p>and tools for those and the science behind those tools</p>
<p>as we go forward.</p>
<p>But there are really just four simple parameters</p>
<p>that you have control over</p>
<p>that you can immediately start to record</p>
<p>and take note of</p>
<p>just to see how you&rsquo;re doing with these things</p>
<p>with no judgment or perhaps no change</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re actually doing.</p>
<p>It might be interesting, just a suggestion,</p>
<p>to write down for each day</p>
<p>when you went outside to get sunlight</p>
<p>and when you did that relative to waking.</p>
<p>So you would write down,</p>
<p>the way I do this on my calendar is I&rsquo;ll write down that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get exact about it.</p>
<p>I might say, I woke up at 6.15</p>
<p>and then I, it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll put a W, 6.15</p>
<p>and then SL for sunlight.</p>
<p>Now you sometimes get outside right away.</p>
<p>Other times I&rsquo;m less good at that</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go out around, I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s say seven.</p>
<p>And for how long?</p>
<p>Maybe like 10, 15 minutes or so.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll put a little check</p>
<p>at roughly the times that I eat my so-called meals.</p>
<p>Although as I mentioned,</p>
<p>sometimes my meals are a bunch of small checks</p>
<p>that just kind of extend through the late hours of the day.</p>
<p>Yours might be more confined to certain times.</p>
<p>And then you might just take note of when you exercised,</p>
<p>just put down an E for when you exercise,</p>
<p>weight training or aerobic exercise.</p>
<p>And you might note when you might&rsquo;ve felt chilled or cold</p>
<p>if you do, or you might&rsquo;ve felt particularly hot</p>
<p>or if you woke up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>when you felt particularly hot.</p>
<p>And then the last thing you might want to do</p>
<p>is just write down if and when</p>
<p>you did a non-sleep deep rest protocol, NSDR protocol,</p>
<p>that could be meditation, that could be yoga nidra,</p>
<p>that could be hypnosis,</p>
<p>anything that you&rsquo;re using to deliberately</p>
<p>teach your nervous system how to go from more alertness</p>
<p>to more calmness in the waking state.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and doing an NSDR protocol or in the afternoon</p>
<p>or first thing in the morning to recover some sleep</p>
<p>and ability to perform DPOs that you might&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>from a minimal or poor night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna write down when you woke up,</p>
<p>when you viewed sunlight,</p>
<p>that might be in the morning and the evening</p>
<p>or just the morning,</p>
<p>hopefully it&rsquo;s the morning and the evening,</p>
<p>when you exercised, when you ate your meals</p>
<p>and using a simple record-keeping scheme</p>
<p>like W for waking, SL for sunlight.</p>
<p>Maybe you come up with a system where it&rsquo;s a check</p>
<p>or an X or something for exercise.</p>
<p>This is not designed to make you neurotically attached</p>
<p>to tracking all your behaviors and everything you do.</p>
<p>I, for instance, don&rsquo;t track what I eat in particular.</p>
<p>I kind of know what works for me</p>
<p>and I just try and stay within that range.</p>
<p>But by doing this,</p>
<p>you can start to reveal some really interesting patterns.</p>
<p>Patterns that no answer that I could provide you</p>
<p>about any existing tool or protocol could counter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about taking the patterns of behaviors</p>
<p>of waking and light viewing and eating and exercise</p>
<p>and superimposing that on what you&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>in this podcast and elsewhere, of course,</p>
<p>and what you already know.</p>
<p>And trying to see where certain problems</p>
<p>or pain points might be arising.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re eating really late in the day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re waking up in the middle of the night really warm.</p>
<p>Well, now you would say, well, that could be due</p>
<p>to kind of an increase in temperature</p>
<p>that is extending my day.</p>
<p>Or maybe you start to find that using cold exposure</p>
<p>early in the day is great for you, but using it late,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s too late in the day, that&rsquo;s not great.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re into the sauna or even like some people,</p>
<p>including myself, if I take a hot shower</p>
<p>or sit in a hot tub or a sauna late at night,</p>
<p>well, then I get a compensatory decrease in body temperature</p>
<p>and I sleep great, provided I hydrate well enough</p>
<p>because that can be kind of a dehydrating thing</p>
<p>to sit in hot conditions.</p>
<p>But if I do the sauna early in the day,</p>
<p>unless I exercise immediately afterward,</p>
<p>then I tend to get the temperature drop,</p>
<p>which makes sense because we can get in the sauna,</p>
<p>you get vasodilation, you throw off a lot of heat,</p>
<p>and then you generally get a compensatory drop</p>
<p>in temperature.</p>
<p>If you do that early in the day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right about the time that that temperature</p>
<p>is trying to entrain the circadian clocks of your body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens to me.</p>
<p>Other people, it might be slightly different.</p>
<p>And some people have more resilient systems than others.</p>
<p>So I just encourage you to start becoming scientists</p>
<p>of your own physiology, of your own brain and body,</p>
<p>and seeing how the various tools that you may</p>
<p>or may not be using are affecting your patterns of sleep,</p>
<p>your patterns of attention and wakefulness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vitally important that if you do this,</p>
<p>that you know that it&rsquo;s not about trying to get</p>
<p>onto an extremely rigid schedule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about trying to identify variables</p>
<p>that are most powerful for you,</p>
<p>and that push you in the direction that you want to go,</p>
<p>and changing the variables that are pushing your body</p>
<p>and your mind in the directions that you don&rsquo;t want to go.</p>
<p>Self-experimentation is something that should be done</p>
<p>slowly, carefully.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be reckless about this.</p>
<p>And this is where I would say manipulating</p>
<p>one or two variables at a time is really going to be best,</p>
<p>as opposed to changing a dozen things all at once,</p>
<p>to really identify what it is that&rsquo;s most powerful for you.</p>
<p>As always, thank you so much for your questions.</p>
<p>We are going to continue to answer questions.</p>
<p>I certainly didn&rsquo;t get to all of them,</p>
<p>but we tried to get to most all of the ones</p>
<p>that were frequently asked.</p>
<p>Episode four of the podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get into shift work, jet lag,</p>
<p>and age-dependent changes in sleeping and wakefulness</p>
<p>and cognition.</p>
<p>So for those of you with kids,</p>
<p>for those of you that are kids,</p>
<p>for those of you with older relatives,</p>
<p>or who might be older, meaning probably when you start</p>
<p>to get into late 60s, 70s, and 80s,</p>
<p>is when there&rsquo;s some marked biological shifts</p>
<p>in temperature regulation and things that relate to sleep.</p>
<p>And for those of you that travel,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about jet lag.</p>
<p>The shift work discussion might seem only relevant</p>
<p>to those that work nights, but actually that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Most people, because of the way they&rsquo;re interacting</p>
<p>with devices, are actually in a form of shift work now,</p>
<p>where the days are certainly not nine to five,</p>
<p>so-called banker&rsquo;s hours, and then the lights are out</p>
<p>at nine and they&rsquo;re asleep until 5 a.m.</p>
<p>Some people have that schedule, most people do not.</p>
<p>So episode four, we will go deeply into shift work,</p>
<p>jet lag, age-dependent changes in sleep alertness</p>
<p>and cognition, and I will touch back</p>
<p>on a few of your questions.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t think that if your question wasn&rsquo;t answered</p>
<p>during these office hours that we won&rsquo;t get to it.</p>
<p>I absolutely will at some point.</p>
<p>In addition to that, several of you have graciously asked</p>
<p>how you can help support the podcast,</p>
<p>and we very much appreciate that.</p>
<p>You can support the podcast by liking it on YouTube,</p>
<p>by subscribing on YouTube,</p>
<p>by recommending the YouTube videos to others,</p>
<p>as well as subscribing and downloading the podcast on Apple,</p>
<p>where you can also leave a review,</p>
<p>and on Spotify, or all three, if you like.</p>
<p>You can also help us by supporting our sponsors.</p>
<p>So check out some of the sponsor links that were described</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>And in general, recommending the podcast to people</p>
<p>that you know and that you think would benefit</p>
<p>from the information would be terrific.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality,</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>As always, I will be continuing to post on Instagram.</p>
<p>You can expect another podcast episode out next Monday</p>
<p>about the topics that we&rsquo;ve been discussing this month.</p>
<p>And above all, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
