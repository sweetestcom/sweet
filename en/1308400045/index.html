    <p>Hi friends! So this week I want to talk about trusting yourself. And we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start off talking about how to actually repair the relationship with yourself</p>
<p>and how to actually trust yourself. And then I&rsquo;m gonna dive into learning how to</p>
<p>trust your own judgment so that other people&rsquo;s opinions don&rsquo;t fuck with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna teach you my tricks that I&rsquo;ve found for that. Because a lot of people</p>
<p>be hurting my goddamn feelings all the time. Well they used to. Now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>impenetrable. You can&rsquo;t hurt my goddamn feelings. So I&rsquo;m gonna give you all my</p>
<p>hacks and all my little cheat sheets for that. And then at the end I have three</p>
<p>scenarios for what would Leo do. And that&rsquo;s where you guys write in and you</p>
<p>ask for advice on your situation or whatever you&rsquo;re going through. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like what would Leo do? I give you advice on how I would handle what you guys are</p>
<p>going through. Like my little hot take on your situation. So that&rsquo;s coming at the</p>
<p>end. But first we got to talk about trusting yourself. And the first thing I</p>
<p>want to do is flip your perspective around this for a second. Because a lot</p>
<p>of people are like well how do I trust myself? Like you don&rsquo;t know what to</p>
<p>fucking do. Because that&rsquo;s where I was for so long. Y&rsquo;all I&rsquo;m never making fun</p>
<p>of you. Okay? Because I used to be that motherfucker. But the way that I can flip</p>
<p>this perspective for you and the thing that helped me the most was looking at</p>
<p>okay if you want to trust yourself and you don&rsquo;t really know how to go about it</p>
<p>look at what would it take for you to trust someone else. Like what would</p>
<p>someone else have to do? How would they have to behave? How would they have to</p>
<p>treat you in order for you to feel like you can trust them and rely on them? This</p>
<p>is gonna give you a whole new awareness about how you need to fucking behave</p>
<p>towards yourself. Alright? And it&rsquo;s not gonna be fun. It&rsquo;s really not. It&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>become like a full-time job for you to repair your relationship with yourself</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re someone that doesn&rsquo;t trust themselves. So it&rsquo;s a lot but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>manageable. And what I tell you in this episode is gonna help you a whole bunch.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t get overwhelmed. But like you do have to understand you are in a</p>
<p>relationship with yourself. And you have a relationship to everything. You have a</p>
<p>relationship to money. You have a relationship to food. You have a</p>
<p>relationship to friends. You have a relationship to your job. You have a</p>
<p>relationship to having relationships. Everything in your life is about</p>
<p>relationships. So that&rsquo;s realization number one. But that&rsquo;s the main thing</p>
<p>that I do when I coach people one-on-one is I repair their relationships with</p>
<p>different areas. So some people need their relationship with themselves</p>
<p>repaired. Some people need their relationship with money repaired or</p>
<p>their joy or their feelings. Like there&rsquo;s so many relationships that you need to</p>
<p>acknowledge and fix in order to notice a difference. But the main point I want to</p>
<p>hit on for saying what would it take for you to trust someone else and then</p>
<p>flipping that towards yourself. If someone made a promise to you, you would</p>
<p>want them to keep it no matter what. You wouldn&rsquo;t feel like their excuse was</p>
<p>worth shit if someone came to you and was like, oh I went back on my word or I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do what I promised I was gonna do to you because I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
<p>Because I was upset. Because I was this. Because I was that. You&rsquo;re gonna start</p>
<p>being able to weed through a lot of your bullshit fucking excuses because you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be comfortable with someone breaking a promise to you for something</p>
<p>small. They best have a big fucking reason. They best have something</p>
<p>substantial to give you as explanation for why they didn&rsquo;t keep their promise</p>
<p>to you or you&rsquo;re not gonna trust them. So that&rsquo;s step one is you got to be able to</p>
<p>like call yourself on the bullshit excuses you give yourself and stop</p>
<p>giving yourself excuses. So if you make a promise to yourself and you say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do something, think of what would I be okay with someone else breaking this</p>
<p>promise to me and what would I not? Like what would not be a valid excuse for</p>
<p>someone else to break this promise? And that will kind of give you a guide of</p>
<p>like how to call bullshit on yourself. Like because you didn&rsquo;t feel like it, you</p>
<p>was tired, okay? You didn&rsquo;t do what you said you were gonna do because you were</p>
<p>tired. You didn&rsquo;t eat clean because you were hungry and you just gave in to the</p>
<p>way that you felt and you just discarded a diet. You said fuck that, fuck eating</p>
<p>healthy, fuck your fitness goals and you just ate how you wanted. If you agreed to</p>
<p>be somewhere at a certain time but you&rsquo;re just like, eh, like you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prioritize your time good enough. Like there&rsquo;s no excuse really. So my tip with</p>
<p>keeping promises to yourself basically is just look at when I am about to not</p>
<p>do something I told myself I was gonna do, would I accept that excuse from</p>
<p>someone else? So the next part of trusting yourself more comes to when you</p>
<p>fuck up. Like when you say you&rsquo;re gonna do something or you say you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>behave in a certain way towards yourself or like whatever it is you make a</p>
<p>promise and you break it, you have to make up when you fuck up. So if you do</p>
<p>something against what you said you were gonna do, what would you expect</p>
<p>someone else to do that hurt you or broke a promise to you? You would expect</p>
<p>them and would hope that they would put effort into fixing whatever damage they</p>
<p>caused or put effort into showing you that they care that they hurt you or let</p>
<p>you down. You&rsquo;d want someone to show effort. So when you fuck up with yourself,</p>
<p>show yourself by putting in effort to make up for it. Like if you fuck</p>
<p>something up, make up for it. Like make it up to yourself that you fucked up.</p>
<p>Because when this happens there&rsquo;s two parts of you. It&rsquo;s like if you have a</p>
<p>goal, there&rsquo;s part of you that wants that goal more than anything and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>part of you that&rsquo;s like, like I guess, like I want it too but like I want to do</p>
<p>other shit too. That&rsquo;s like conflicting with what it&rsquo;s gonna take to get you</p>
<p>there. So if you do fuck up and you don&rsquo;t do what it&rsquo;s gonna take to get you to</p>
<p>that goal, there&rsquo;s part of you that still wants to get there and feels betrayed by</p>
<p>you. But if all you do is just comfort this part and tell yourself, oh it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>that you fucked up, oh it&rsquo;s alright, it&rsquo;s fine, you have to stop comforting</p>
<p>yourself when you fuck something up that you want. Because you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>comforting this part and saying it&rsquo;s okay that you just betrayed this part</p>
<p>that needs you to get to where it wants to go. Parts work is a very tricky thing</p>
<p>but I hope this is all making sense because it makes sense in my brain but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to formulate it into words and it always is like a little different.</p>
<p>So like I said, when you do something that you know you weren&rsquo;t supposed to</p>
<p>fucking do, if all you do is comfort yourself and tell yourself it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine, you&rsquo;re basically saying it&rsquo;s okay that you just betrayed yourself and</p>
<p>what you said you were gonna do. You&rsquo;re never gonna feel like you can trust</p>
<p>yourself. What you have to do is own up to the reality of the situation and be</p>
<p>like, okay I said I wanted this thing and then I acted in this way. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna get me there. I fucked up. So what am I gonna do now that I am aware that I</p>
<p>fucked up? Like I&rsquo;m not just comforting myself and telling myself it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for it but don&rsquo;t overly comfort yourself. Like sit in the</p>
<p>discomfort and face the reality that you just fucked up what you said you were</p>
<p>gonna do. So like I said, when you fuck up, make up. And don&rsquo;t just discard this</p>
<p>part of you that desperately wants this goal you have because if all you do is</p>
<p>comfort this part of you and say no it&rsquo;s okay that you betrayed that part, the</p>
<p>likelihood of it happening again is very high. So I&rsquo;m gonna give you a couple of</p>
<p>examples of this dynamic. So like the one thing that relates to me right now is</p>
<p>like diet. Alright I&rsquo;m on a very strict meal plan right now because I have goals</p>
<p>for the way that I want my body to look. And when I go over my calories or like</p>
<p>if I just have like a moment where I&rsquo;m like fuck it like and I eat something</p>
<p>like extra, what I&rsquo;m doing right there is like putting myself at odds with myself.</p>
<p>Okay I ate more on my meal plan than I should have and I&rsquo;ve just thrown my</p>
<p>goals off. So given this situation, given I have to face reality of what my</p>
<p>actions just did, I just fucked this up. What can I do to repair it? I&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>get my ass on the fucking treadmill and do some extra cardio to burn off the</p>
<p>extra that I ate. There&rsquo;s a way to repair it and you need to do it. You can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>become okay and allow yourself to consistently fuck up. You have to make up</p>
<p>for it but the only way that you allow yourself to consistently fuck up is by</p>
<p>not facing the consequences of your actions and just ignoring it and acting</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not a big deal. It is a big deal because my whole thing with my</p>
<p>caloric deficit that I&rsquo;m eating in, I&rsquo;m eating less so I can like lean down. I</p>
<p>have to be in the deficit for like over the week and if I fuck up and I eat 500</p>
<p>calories extra one day, that&rsquo;s just fucked up like a few days worth of work.</p>
<p>So if you do that consistently, I&rsquo;m not gonna lose weight. If I just shovel shit</p>
<p>into my mouth, it&rsquo;s gonna totally conflict what I&rsquo;m doing and like negate</p>
<p>it. Like all my work is gonna be for fucking nothing if I can&rsquo;t control what</p>
<p>I put into my mouth. So if I run into a situation where I have a moment of</p>
<p>weakness where I eat a little too much or I&rsquo;m like fuck it I want a cookie, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go get my ass on a treadmill afterward and burn the cookie off. One, so</p>
<p>that I feel better. I don&rsquo;t have that guilt. I don&rsquo;t have that like fuck I just</p>
<p>fucked up all my goals. Like you have to face reality of like you did just fuck</p>
<p>up what you were trying to work toward. So you can choose to sit there and bitch</p>
<p>and whine and be like oh my god it&rsquo;s fucked up there oh my god way or you can</p>
<p>look at what can I do to rectify it. Can I correct this in any way? And then</p>
<p>putting the effort into correcting it shows yourself you can trust yourself.</p>
<p>Because if you do fuck up you put the effort into mending that. That&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>trust someone and that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;ll trust yourself. So sure it&rsquo;s totally fine</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s totally normal to have moments of weakness. Nobody&rsquo;s a fucking robot.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s perfect all the time. But like I said the relationship with yourself you</p>
<p>have to show yourself that you care about what you want and your actions</p>
<p>are gonna be in line with that. So if you fuck up make up and I&rsquo;m gonna keep</p>
<p>saying that. Another example for this is like if you have a to-do list of a lot</p>
<p>of things that you know you need to get done and you push them off and you fuck</p>
<p>off and you don&rsquo;t really like put effort into getting them done you&rsquo;re like eh</p>
<p>whatever. You have to face the reality of like you had that checklist of things to</p>
<p>do because you are trying to achieve something in a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a goal or whether it&rsquo;s just like you need to fucking clean your</p>
<p>house. There&rsquo;s plenty of reasons why you&rsquo;d be doing something but the whole</p>
<p>thing is like timing. You&rsquo;re slowing yourself down by not doing what you know</p>
<p>you need to do and what you&rsquo;ve agreed to do when you made this list. So at the end</p>
<p>of the night if you fucked off all day and you didn&rsquo;t do your to-do list do</p>
<p>whatever you can do on that list or the next day make sure you get everything</p>
<p>done because if you don&rsquo;t if you just like slack off you&rsquo;re slowing your</p>
<p>progress. You have to face the reality of your actions. If you do not do what</p>
<p>you said you were gonna do to track it you&rsquo;re gonna slow yourself down and are</p>
<p>you gonna allow yourself to be slowed down or are you gonna rise to the</p>
<p>occasion and fucking fix it? And if there&rsquo;s ever a situation where you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>create repair or like fix damage that you&rsquo;ve done like with eating or like</p>
<p>fucking up your to-do list that&rsquo;s totally fine. There&rsquo;s ways to make up for</p>
<p>that but there are situations that you can&rsquo;t make up for like let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you see someone out in public that you&rsquo;re really interested in you</p>
<p>like them you&rsquo;re like oh my god like they caught your attention but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>too nervous you&rsquo;re too shy to go up and talk to them. If you don&rsquo;t go up and talk</p>
<p>to them and you just leave wherever you&rsquo;re at there is no undo. There is no</p>
<p>command Z. There is no retry. There is no like make up for that situation. If you</p>
<p>wanted to go talk to this person and you just didn&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s just a stranger</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna see them again. If you didn&rsquo;t talk to them and you leave very</p>
<p>unlikely you&rsquo;re gonna see them again but sit in that panic for a second and</p>
<p>that guilt of like fuck like I should have just went and talked to them I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never gonna get the chance to do it again like you&rsquo;re gonna notice you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>beating yourself up for not taking the action you&rsquo;re gonna feel like shit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel discouraged you&rsquo;re gonna be like damn it you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>kind of disappointed in yourself. So in that situation there&rsquo;s nothing you can</p>
<p>do to fix it but what you can do is realize in that situation how you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling and commit to yourself. I&rsquo;m not letting you go through that again. So</p>
<p>next time you see somebody in public we&rsquo;re going to go up and talk to them</p>
<p>because I would rather you get the peace of mind and going to talk to them than</p>
<p>going home after because you didn&rsquo;t talk to them and beat yourself up mentally. So</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s no way to create repair in the exact situation you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>wait until another situation presents itself for you to rise to the occasion</p>
<p>and step up and do it but the first situation had to happen so that you</p>
<p>could feel that fucking shit and be like all right I&rsquo;m not gonna let myself</p>
<p>feel that again I&rsquo;m gonna wait for the next opportunity and then I&rsquo;m gonna act</p>
<p>on it and then once you act on it the next time it comes up the next time you</p>
<p>see somebody attractive in public and you go talk to them you&rsquo;re gonna trust</p>
<p>yourself like oh my god you didn&rsquo;t make me go home and fucking wish and what if</p>
<p>and think and like feel like shit and disappointed like you&rsquo;re gonna learn to</p>
<p>trust yourself of like you&rsquo;re not gonna allow yourself to feel those negative</p>
<p>states when it&rsquo;s in your control like you going up to talk to somebody is</p>
<p>fully in your control so do you want to choose to go have peace of mind that it</p>
<p>could have worked or could have not worked or would you rather go home and</p>
<p>be like what if for the rest of your life if the motherfucker at Trader Joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>would have been like the one okay so my next tip for trusting yourself is you</p>
<p>have to act in line with your best interests and what you want so to sit</p>
<p>around and be like oh I want this thing I want that thing cool bitch like if you</p>
<p>just sit around and say you want this you want that okay cool like but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no trust that&rsquo;s gonna come with you or with anything that you feel like you</p>
<p>will actually get what it is that you want if all you do is ever just sit</p>
<p>around and ask for shit and say that you want shit you have to stack your actions</p>
<p>with it so when you discover that you want something you need to put your</p>
<p>actions in line with getting it you need to put effort into getting what you want</p>
<p>that will build so much trust in you than you even know to say I want</p>
<p>something and then to see yourself actually working toward it that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>self-esteem boosting and like that builds so much trust in yourself of like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be scared to want things anymore because a lot of people</p>
<p>are like scared to like want more and desire more like a lot of people hate</p>
<p>that the fact that they want shit but if you would just flip it and start</p>
<p>realizing okay when I have a desire I can change my actions to put me on</p>
<p>course with getting that and then you will be shocked by how much you achieve</p>
<p>by actually going for it I know it&rsquo;s scary I know there&rsquo;s a lot more that</p>
<p>goes to it but when you say you want something show yourself that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna prioritize and try to get it like try to fucking get what it is you want</p>
<p>take it into consideration take the fact that you want something into</p>
<p>consideration and put your actions in line with it even if you don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to get there motherfucker just start walking in a certain direction and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll figure out am I getting there am I not getting there but just doing</p>
<p>anything in your control that will allow you to get to what you want it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>build yourself trust so much okay next we&rsquo;re gonna talk about feelings</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s my favorite I love emotions I love feelings really I</p>
<p>fucking hate them but I&rsquo;m a Pisces so I feel all of them I have fucking plenty</p>
<p>you want some you can you could take some off my plate that&rsquo;s totally fine</p>
<p>but you have to care about the way that you feel that period point-blank done</p>
<p>like nothing further than that you have to start caring that you feel certain</p>
<p>things you have to care if you feel upset or hurt or uncomfortable or</p>
<p>disappointed and you also have to care if you feel happy or not like you should</p>
<p>want yourself to feel happy so it&rsquo;s not about just caring about the bad things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s caring about the good things too like you care that you get to feel the</p>
<p>good shit and you&rsquo;ll do things to make sure that you get to feel good but</p>
<p>definitely with the negative emotions with the feeling uncomfortable with the</p>
<p>feeling upset you have to care that you feel upset you have to put your fucking</p>
<p>brakes on like back the truck up and be like hang on why did I just get upset</p>
<p>what just bothered me don&rsquo;t just breeze past the fact that you&rsquo;re upset by</p>
<p>something look at the situation for a second and be like okay the fact that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>uncomfortable does not sit right with me like hang on let me look at this</p>
<p>situation what just caused me to feel this way and what am I gonna do about it</p>
<p>like just genuinely taking an understanding of why you feel the way</p>
<p>that you do and not just attacking yourself or dismissing yourself so if</p>
<p>you have a situation happen and you get upset or you get sad instead of just</p>
<p>being like I&rsquo;ll quit being a fucking bitch like sometimes you have to do that</p>
<p>but look at wait why did I just get upset by that even if it seems small or</p>
<p>seems stupid take a genuine like curiosity standpoint and try to</p>
<p>understand what just happened there why am I feeling upset because as soon as</p>
<p>you see why you&rsquo;re upset you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s very much valid and you&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to move forward but if you just ignore the fact that you&rsquo;re upset you&rsquo;re never</p>
<p>gonna trust yourself ever because when you get upset you just sweep it under</p>
<p>the rug you don&rsquo;t give a fuck how you feel you&rsquo;re never gonna trust someone</p>
<p>like that you would never trust someone else who just discarded the way that you</p>
<p>felt and did not care that you were upset like if someone so walked in and</p>
<p>saw you fucking bawling your eyes out and they just walked in and was like oh</p>
<p>and they went in the kitchen and started making food like they&rsquo;re just not gonna</p>
<p>acknowledge you or like anything it&rsquo;s like are you done yet like if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just gonna look at you like that and dismiss the fact that you&rsquo;re upset</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna trust that person you&rsquo;re never gonna feel like they care</p>
<p>about you you&rsquo;re never gonna feel good around them but if they walk in the door</p>
<p>and show concern that you&rsquo;re upset but what happened why are you upset what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on that&rsquo;s a whole different energy so you have to have that toward</p>
<p>yourself too you have to care that you&rsquo;re upset or that you feel anything</p>
<p>and with that comes my next point about trusting yourself which is if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>uncomfortable show yourself you will change something and that can take a lot</p>
<p>of fucking forms all right and also it&rsquo;s like standing up for yourself but I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get to that in a second like you have to show yourself that when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>uncomfortable you care about that and you want to change that you have to</p>
<p>show yourself no I want you to feel better in this situation I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>you to just sit there and suffer but then the standing up for yourself part</p>
<p>comes in with showing yourself that you care enough about the way that you feel</p>
<p>to take on the consequences of you making a change so this is just a stupid</p>
<p>fucking example I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve talked about it before on the podcast</p>
<p>but before I started my whole like caring about myself journey like when I</p>
<p>would be on a flight like on a plane I like to sit on the inside I get like</p>
<p>away from the aisle like by the window one I&rsquo;m very big I&rsquo;m 6 foot 7 so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very broad so like when I&rsquo;m in the fucking aisle seat people be bumping</p>
<p>into me and putting their shit all over me I don&rsquo;t want to fucking be touched</p>
<p>and I like a little window yeah I like to just look out the window and like see</p>
<p>things so whenever I get on a plane I&rsquo;m in the inside seat so someone&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>sitting next to me so if I want to get up and do anything the other person has</p>
<p>to get up cuz like I said I&rsquo;m 6 foot 7 I there is no squeeze by bitch it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>my ass is gonna be in your fucking face if I try and just go in front of you so</p>
<p>anytime I need something out of my bag or I have to go to the bathroom I would</p>
<p>have to inconvenience the person next to me and be like hey can you get up and</p>
<p>like I would have to make them get up and I carried so much guilt about that</p>
<p>for so long but the realization hit me one day I was sitting in a seat and it</p>
<p>was when I started to care about the way that I felt I was like okay I have to</p>
<p>fucking piss right now like I have to fucking piss bad I think I was on like a</p>
<p>four-hour flight and I had like two hours left and I was like Leo just hold</p>
<p>it and then the new part of me was like nah I care that you&rsquo;re uncomfortable I</p>
<p>care that you&rsquo;re like borderline in fucking pain right now and you have to</p>
<p>pee so I was faced with a decision of choose to force myself to sit there and</p>
<p>suffer and feel good that I didn&rsquo;t inconvenience this person or simply ask</p>
<p>them to get up so that I can go pee it&rsquo;s basically me or them but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even like me or them it&rsquo;s am I willing to suffer to not look like an asshole</p>
<p>but I thought like inconveniencing anyone in any way was like being an</p>
<p>asshole but it&rsquo;s really not because if I had someone next to me that had to</p>
<p>fucking pee I would have no problem getting up like at all it&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>hang on like let me get my shit like if I&rsquo;m eating my little meal or whatever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like hang on like I&rsquo;ll get up like I would not want someone next to me to</p>
<p>sit there in pain just because they don&rsquo;t want to like make me get up like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll gladly get up but I just carried so much guilt for so long to like</p>
<p>inconvenience people so a lot of times I would just sit on planes having to</p>
<p>fucking piss like a horse and just hold it like I would just make myself hold it</p>
<p>but carrying how I felt started in that moment I was like uh-uh like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna sit here and suffer for no fucking reason or you can show yourself</p>
<p>that you care that you&rsquo;re uncomfortable and ask them to get up so you can go pee</p>
<p>are you gonna take the actions that are in support of you feeling better and my</p>
<p>whole like shift happened when I started doing that like yes I am gonna show</p>
<p>myself that I don&rsquo;t want myself to be uncomfortable I&rsquo;m not just gonna make</p>
<p>you sit here and fucking hold your pee and fucking like have your stomach</p>
<p>fucking hurt so now I ask people to get up and like allow myself to go pee and I</p>
<p>know that sounds like a stupid fucking example but it&rsquo;s so important and like</p>
<p>my trust in myself built so much after I started doing this because it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>small moments it&rsquo;s in everything little like it&rsquo;s such a huge thing it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like these giant moments where you&rsquo;re gonna be like yes I trust myself it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the small moments where it builds and you show yourself shit like that like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna let you be uncomfortable whether it&rsquo;s in a relationship and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna leave your fucking ass or I&rsquo;m gonna get up and go pee cuz I gotta pee</p>
<p>but then also with a situation like that you have to take on the consequences of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen when you try and stand up for yourself so I&rsquo;m lucky where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very strong and I&rsquo;m I have no problem standing up for myself when I</p>
<p>feel justified like as soon as someone dismisses me or hurts me I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>literally stand up for myself so hard you&rsquo;re gonna feel like I&rsquo;m attacking you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if I say hey can I go to the bathroom real quick do you mind if I</p>
<p>say something like that and I&rsquo;m being polite and they want to cop a fucking</p>
<p>attitude now I&rsquo;m gonna look at you and say now get the fuck up before I throw</p>
<p>you at this goddamn seat okay like I&rsquo;m gonna try and be polite but if you try</p>
<p>and like back me down or something and like you&rsquo;re not gonna take me into</p>
<p>consideration like I was being polite to you I just didn&rsquo;t tell you to get the</p>
<p>fuck up like I was being sweet and letting you know like I didn&rsquo;t like want</p>
<p>to bother you you know what I mean like if I&rsquo;m gonna show you consideration show</p>
<p>it back to me but if I ever feel like there&rsquo;s a consequence for me standing up</p>
<p>for myself I&rsquo;ll fully face that shit whatever comes along with it but I do</p>
<p>have that protector aspect of me that I told y&rsquo;all came out when I got bullied a</p>
<p>lot and he just he takes over and he just takes care of everything but yeah</p>
<p>you have to face the consequences that come with standing up for yourself and</p>
<p>wanting to make a change when you&rsquo;re uncomfortable so even if someone thinks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking crazy or they think you&rsquo;re rude or they think you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>asshole or they&rsquo;re like pissed off at you so what so fucking what do I care</p>
<p>that miss little Betty boop next to me on the plane is like pissy that she had</p>
<p>to get up excited to pee shut the fuck up bitch get over it we&rsquo;re all human we</p>
<p>all got a fucking pee I&rsquo;ve never had someone like have a negative reaction</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to give you an example with that one of like you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>to face the consequences but one more example I want to give around like</p>
<p>standing up for yourself is if you&rsquo;re gonna pay for something you have to show</p>
<p>yourself that you&rsquo;re gonna stand up for yourself and make sure you get what you</p>
<p>paid for like there&rsquo;s no reason for you to not get what you paid for and I used</p>
<p>to be like I will take what people give me I don&rsquo;t give a fuck I&rsquo;m not being an</p>
<p>inconvenience I&rsquo;m not being that asshole that will like send food back or send</p>
<p>drinks back like if I was at Starbucks or something and they made my fucking</p>
<p>order wrong I would not say shit like I would just take it like thanks like if I</p>
<p>ordered a coffee and they gave me some green tea bullshit I&rsquo;ll be like oh</p>
<p>thanks cool and just pretend like it was fine because I felt like such a fucking</p>
<p>like asshole to God forbid stand up for myself but the whole mindset shift</p>
<p>happened where I was like I paid for this thing and I&rsquo;m not an asshole for</p>
<p>making sure that I get that like if the barista barista whatever you are like if</p>
<p>they ordered something at an establishment they would want to get</p>
<p>what they paid for too so if I order a coffee and you hand me some fucking</p>
<p>green drink I&rsquo;m not a dick for actually correcting it and asking for what I</p>
<p>ordered like letting them know politely like hey like that doesn&rsquo;t look like</p>
<p>what I got I got the coffee whatever the fuck like whatever you got politely just</p>
<p>help them recognize that there&rsquo;s been a mistake and you didn&rsquo;t get what you</p>
<p>ordered you&rsquo;re not a fucking dick for doing that and so much shifted in me</p>
<p>once I started being like this like I am on people&rsquo;s fucking ass now like bitch I</p>
<p>fucking paid for something now give it to me I know when it&rsquo;s like you act like</p>
<p>a dick and you&rsquo;re entitled I&rsquo;m very polite and I&rsquo;m very like cool but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let nobody fuck on me like you&rsquo;re never gonna fuck me around and like toy</p>
<p>with me like bitch you&rsquo;re gonna come correct or you&rsquo;re gonna make up for it</p>
<p>like I ordered a couch like two months ago and it said it was gonna be delivered</p>
<p>in five to seven days that fucking couch did not come for a month and a half and</p>
<p>you know what I did every week I was calling them where is my couch where the</p>
<p>fuck is the couch and then after a month like I gave them they said it was</p>
<p>gonna be delivered in like basically one to two weeks and after four weeks I</p>
<p>called them and said okay so what I ordered what I paid for and what I</p>
<p>clicked checkout on what was advertised was I&rsquo;m getting this couch in one to two</p>
<p>weeks five to seven days but I&rsquo;m giving you extra if I say two weeks but like</p>
<p>five to seven days is what I ordered it&rsquo;s been a month so what you guys</p>
<p>advertised and what I chose to pay for is not what I&rsquo;ve received the product is</p>
<p>separate from the time you made a promise on time and a product you did</p>
<p>not uphold what you promised on time so what are we gonna do to correct this</p>
<p>because now I&rsquo;m unsatisfied now I&rsquo;m like piss the fuck off like y&rsquo;all have fucked</p>
<p>me around for like every week they would tell me oh three more days three more</p>
<p>days three more days like I was three days to death like motherfucker where is</p>
<p>my shit where&rsquo;s my goddamn couch so I asked them what can be done about this</p>
<p>like what compensation can it be had like what can go on about this and I no</p>
<p>longer felt like a dick for it because like I waited the time that I was</p>
<p>expected to like get like I waited the two weeks I waited the four weeks and</p>
<p>then I demanded something like I&rsquo;m not just gonna make myself get fucked on</p>
<p>like that and make myself take it like nah bitch what I got is not what I paid</p>
<p>for so somebody&rsquo;s gonna correct it like I&rsquo;m not just gonna make myself swallow</p>
<p>that and sit here and be pissed off and secretly resentful at my couch because</p>
<p>of the whole process like they sent me some money back and now I feel better</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like cool I got the couch it took two fucking goddamn months but they</p>
<p>corrected the situation like I feel better about the situation it&rsquo;s like if</p>
<p>you have something go on and you feel negatively don&rsquo;t make yourself leave</p>
<p>that situation feeling negative so that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna leave that that</p>
<p>was a whole fucking around the bush and a lot of examples but I want to reassure</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re not a fucking dick for making sure you get what you pay for like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>expected anybody else in your shoes would do the same thing like you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>an asshole you&rsquo;re not like inconvenient you&rsquo;re not wrong to give you paid for</p>
<p>something make sure that you get what you pay for don&rsquo;t just make yourself eat</p>
<p>the loss like fuck that that especially is gonna show yourself that you can</p>
<p>trust yourself like you&rsquo;re not just gonna be at the mercy of everyone and</p>
<p>everything like if something doesn&rsquo;t go right like if they keep fucking up your</p>
<p>drinks or you keep buying shit and they&rsquo;re sending you the wrong stuff</p>
<p>like show yourself that you&rsquo;re not at the mercy of anyone and you will have it</p>
<p>fixed so that you make sure you get what you want okay so now let&rsquo;s jump into</p>
<p>learning to trust your own judgment of things so that other people&rsquo;s opinions</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hurt your feelings okay so the first thing is you have to look at and</p>
<p>decide what you like and what you don&rsquo;t like like you have to look at what you</p>
<p>think of things check in with yourself first check in with your own opinion if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re comfortable with something if you like something or if you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;m gonna give you a stupid ass example but like a vape okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>green it&rsquo;s like if I say okay I like this color this is a nice color of green</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not weird like okay you have an opinion that&rsquo;s good you like green I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already decided I like this color and now it&rsquo;s like if someone comes up and</p>
<p>says that&rsquo;s the ugliest fucking color I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowed to have their opinion you don&rsquo;t have to switch yours all of a sudden</p>
<p>just because someone disagrees you&rsquo;re allowed to disagree with someone and</p>
<p>still not lose them and that&rsquo;s a lot of people&rsquo;s biggest fear with like</p>
<p>disagreement and they just want to people please and go along with shit but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to like green okay you&rsquo;re allowed to like this color even if</p>
<p>somebody else fucking hates it but the whole point with like touching in on</p>
<p>what you like first what you think first allows you to still have a sense of self</p>
<p>and a sense of identity and a sense of preference with other people involved so</p>
<p>like if someone says that&rsquo;s fucking ugly if you decided you like it well I like</p>
<p>it if someone says that you&rsquo;re fucking stupid like are you blind that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ugliest fucking color ever be like okay girl like I fucking like it I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cute it&rsquo;s green you have to look at your own reasons for liking something so I</p>
<p>have my own reasons for why I like this fucking color and somebody else might</p>
<p>not but checking in on like why you like something or why you don&rsquo;t is up to</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s like my opinion on open relationships I&rsquo;m so fucking against</p>
<p>open relationships personally if other people want to go do them go do them</p>
<p>someone I&rsquo;m dating is never going to enjoy someone else sexually while I</p>
<p>breathe I will cut a limb off of you motherfucker like it&rsquo;s not happening I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how people do it but other people have an opinion that open</p>
<p>relationships work great for them and they like it they&rsquo;re totally fine to</p>
<p>have that I have the opinion of I would never fucking be okay with it and I</p>
<p>would never like that and I&rsquo;m against that like if you want to do it do it but</p>
<p>like I personally would never before that neither of us are wrong but I have</p>
<p>my own opinion of what I think about open relationships I know myself I know</p>
<p>the way that I feel I have my own reasons for having that opinion other</p>
<p>people might have a different opinion but when you look at your own reasons</p>
<p>and you check in with yourself of like why you do or don&rsquo;t like something when</p>
<p>someone else comes up like I&rsquo;m against open relationships when someone that is</p>
<p>for open relationships comes in I&rsquo;m not immediately just gonna bend to their</p>
<p>perspective and agree with them and go along with them because I want to be</p>
<p>accepted like I have my own reasons and I&rsquo;m gonna stand in them like I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mad at you for choosing that but we can agree to disagree like we can totally</p>
<p>respect each other&rsquo;s opinions you don&rsquo;t have to just give yourself up in order</p>
<p>to be close to people you don&rsquo;t have to just give up your opinions nobody likes</p>
<p>a copycat nobody likes someone that goes with the fucking flow and doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>their own opinion that&rsquo;s one thing I know a lot of people are scared of like</p>
<p>isolation so that&rsquo;s the whole part about like just molding to everyone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>opinion but as soon as other people come around if you throw away all your</p>
<p>beliefs all your likes all your dislikes all your thoughts all your opinions</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna trust yourself around people you&rsquo;re never gonna trust yourself</p>
<p>period because what you&rsquo;re gonna be looking to is the outside world to</p>
<p>determine what you like and don&rsquo;t like like you&rsquo;re never gonna feel a sense of</p>
<p>stability or a sense of safety with yourself you will never trust yourself</p>
<p>so when you have all of that on your own you&rsquo;re more stable and you&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>secure because you trust and you know what you think what you feel and what</p>
<p>you believe so the next kind of part with that is like you have to be able to</p>
<p>hold space for other people&rsquo;s opinions without attacking yourself for having a</p>
<p>different one like you&rsquo;re allowed to have different opinions than other</p>
<p>people that&rsquo;s totally okay and you don&rsquo;t have to bend your opinion just</p>
<p>because someone else has a different one like you&rsquo;re allowed to have differing</p>
<p>opinions and you will one day come across someone that does not attack you</p>
<p>for not agreeing with them like when people don&rsquo;t agree with me I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>cool bitch like if you don&rsquo;t agree I don&rsquo;t mind like you&rsquo;re allowed to not</p>
<p>agree but if you try and attack me for my opinion I&rsquo;m gonna tell you to get</p>
<p>fucked and shove it like I don&rsquo;t want to fucking hear your mouth I&rsquo;m not over</p>
<p>here preaching my shit on to you it&rsquo;s like people that are religious shut the</p>
<p>fuck up shut up about what I&rsquo;m doing what I&rsquo;m doing is against what you</p>
<p>believe what I&rsquo;m doing is not against what I believe you think you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t give a fuck okay so like I&rsquo;m so against like people trying to push</p>
<p>their views on everybody just shut the fuck up let everybody do what the fuck</p>
<p>they want to do like if I want to be gay leave me I don&rsquo;t want to be gay but how</p>
<p>you gonna tell me I&rsquo;m going to hell for being gay bitch I didn&rsquo;t fucking choose</p>
<p>it okay so if I&rsquo;m going to hell for that so be it I&rsquo;m gonna be in my window seat</p>
<p>on the plane like I talked about so I&rsquo;m gonna give you an example personally</p>
<p>because I have my own opinions of things and getting on social media has made me</p>
<p>a very strong person because I have people talking shit on me non-fucking</p>
<p>stop anyone that disagrees with me make sure to let me know and they make sure</p>
<p>to let me know that my hairlines fucked and I&rsquo;m ugly and I have one crooked</p>
<p>tooth it&rsquo;s like girl okay okay cool like do you feel better</p>
<p>peewee that I fucking said something that triggered you so hard that you felt</p>
<p>the need to attack me leave me the fuck be I don&rsquo;t care I literally don&rsquo;t give a</p>
<p>shit like I&rsquo;m impenetrable now you can&rsquo;t fuck with me and the way that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten to this point I&rsquo;m gonna give you the process that I go through with this</p>
<p>shit so I had some fucking dumbass and I&rsquo;m gonna emphasize dumbass comment on</p>
<p>my green flags podcast episode and say Leo like all I learned from this is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking immature I would never take advice from you you have a lot of</p>
<p>growing up to do you&rsquo;re toxic you&rsquo;re this you&rsquo;re that and they like discarded</p>
<p>everything I said in the episode because they didn&rsquo;t agree with it now at first I</p>
<p>was like oh my god like it made me like hesitate I was like wait that I post a</p>
<p>bad episode like that I say some fucked up shit or what so instead of</p>
<p>immediately attacking myself and being like and like freaking the fuck out and</p>
<p>thinking that this person was right I said hang on let me go rewatch my</p>
<p>episode and I&rsquo;m gonna assess my own judgment of what I said so I went back</p>
<p>and I rewatched my episode and there are certain things that I understand would</p>
<p>be triggering for people I get not everybody&rsquo;s gonna agree with everything</p>
<p>that I say and you don&rsquo;t have to this is just what you watch me cuz you want to</p>
<p>know what the fuck I think what the hell but I rewatched my episode and I was</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s things I could see people would disagree with but a lot of the</p>
<p>things that I said were like next level fucking mature and next level awareness</p>
<p>like people aren&rsquo;t spitting the shit that I fucking spit on YouTube or on the</p>
<p>internet these people are fucking dumb they read a fucking self-help book I</p>
<p>think they know it all I&rsquo;ve been through real life I went to the school of</p>
<p>fucking life again your shit fucked up with no one to help you when you have to</p>
<p>save yourself is when you know what the fuck I know so I was watching my episode</p>
<p>back and I was like okay I can see how he would disagree with these things but</p>
<p>all the rest of my episode like it was such good information I&rsquo;m like okay so</p>
<p>clearly he&rsquo;s just a triggered little fucking bitch that needs to discredit me</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna say I disagree with some of the things you said fine but the fact</p>
<p>that this dude took it upon himself to say your entire episode was toxic your</p>
<p>entire episode was immature right there I cannot trust your judgment you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking idiot cuz like I said I understand a couple of things you</p>
<p>disagree with but to try and write off my whole episode as fucked up and toxic</p>
<p>and immature grow the fuck up bitch cuz if you actually listen to that episode</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much wise shit in it so that&rsquo;s where I immediately threw that</p>
<p>comment out of my mind and I was like he can go fuck himself like I didn&rsquo;t let it</p>
<p>affect me anymore because I assessed the episode and watched it and with my own</p>
<p>logic and my own reasoning and my own opinions I decided okay it&rsquo;s not a bad</p>
<p>episode and for him to make a claim like everything I said was immature it does</p>
<p>not make sense because I spit some of the most mature shit you can do in a</p>
<p>relationship and so for someone to throw a fucking label on the whole thing wipes</p>
<p>out their opinion completely and that&rsquo;s how I let it not affect me like I have</p>
<p>people talk shit on everything I post like every single thing I post on the</p>
<p>internet someone is running the little rat fucking mouth about it and I have to</p>
<p>reassess everything I post all the time like I am aware when people have valid</p>
<p>points like I get it bitch like sometimes people is right I&rsquo;m a lot more</p>
<p>right but I do fuck up sometimes and I do say some shit where I&rsquo;m like all</p>
<p>right like my last episode like I was so aggressive about checking people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phones but after thinking about it I was like okay I understand where people are</p>
<p>at when they don&rsquo;t want to go through someone&rsquo;s phone like they are scared of</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re gonna find and people are not like against going through people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phones because they&rsquo;re stupid or immature they&rsquo;re scared of what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find they&rsquo;re genuinely terrified and they&rsquo;re scared to get hurt so for me</p>
<p>to be screaming and flailing about and yelling that you&rsquo;re fucking stupid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the best approach because I can see where they&rsquo;re at like I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>when I fuck up I&rsquo;m aware when like I&rsquo;m too harsh but with that I&rsquo;m also aware</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m fucking right and like the situation with this dip shit commented</p>
<p>on my green flags video like now I just think it&rsquo;s so funny and I hope you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still watching me bitch I hope you&rsquo;re still fucking watching that&rsquo;s weird to</p>
<p>me why my middle finger is still up like for you to have someone you disagree</p>
<p>with so heavily and you&rsquo;re watching all my shit you need to go get checked out a</p>
<p>screw is loose probably multiple you might even be missing a few because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird fucking behavior I&rsquo;m not gonna watch someone I hate I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>spend my time on this earth watching someone that I fucking despise you got</p>
<p>issues babe and that&rsquo;s beyond your fucking awareness but like I said if</p>
<p>someone says something address it for yourself assess what they&rsquo;re claiming</p>
<p>before you immediately assume that they&rsquo;re right like you can&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>people I know I always say don&rsquo;t trust nobody but I trust no one it&rsquo;s tattooed</p>
<p>on my hand for a fucking reason in this life you&rsquo;re meant to like learn to trust</p>
<p>people older than you and like you&rsquo;re supposed to be able to rely on other</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s opinions but people have their own fucked up shit like they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s best for you they&rsquo;re intimidated if you&rsquo;re better than them they will</p>
<p>guide you in the wrong spot people have ill intentions like there&rsquo;s so much you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t trust and people are fucking stupid sometimes and sometimes they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the mental bandwidth to even grasp what the fuck you&rsquo;re talking about so</p>
<p>their opinions not gonna be relevant their judgment is not gonna be relevant</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t trust other people&rsquo;s judgments and that&rsquo;s like a sad thing to</p>
<p>learn because like the typical thing is like you trust your elders you trust</p>
<p>people who are older than you because they can guide you but I&rsquo;ve surpassed a</p>
<p>lot of fucking older people than me like I&rsquo;m 24 operating at 54 mentally</p>
<p>like I was in shit where no one could help me and I learned that you can</p>
<p>really trust no one just because someone&rsquo;s older you still have to</p>
<p>evaluate what the fuck they&rsquo;re saying so don&rsquo;t just automatically assume</p>
<p>everyone is right about anything do your own research come to your own opinions</p>
<p>but certain situations listen god damn it like the doctor like go listen to</p>
<p>the what the fuck the doctor says go to like five don&rsquo;t ever just trust one</p>
<p>opinion from a doctor go to like five and get like a consensus but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain areas where you need to just trust what people are saying but when</p>
<p>someone is criticizing you evaluate that first why would someone need to be</p>
<p>saying this and is it even fucking true cuz like I said the whole episode was</p>
<p>not shitty there&rsquo;s just parts you didn&rsquo;t agree with and you didn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>deal with yourself cuz you were triggered not my fucking problem all</p>
<p>right now let&rsquo;s jump into what would Leo do I&rsquo;m gonna read three situations that</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all wrote in and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you what I would do and give you my little</p>
<p>guidance on it so the first one is a girl who feels really stuck in life and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s wanting to move somewhere else and she&rsquo;s working in real estate and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like overwhelmed by all the shit she&rsquo;s got going on and she feels stuck cuz she</p>
<p>wants to move and like make a transition and like level herself up but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worried about everything going on and she feels really stuck in life so my</p>
<p>advice to anyone that&rsquo;s stuck in life where you feel stuck number one is the</p>
<p>awareness you&rsquo;re not actually stuck and I know it&rsquo;s a lot easier said than done</p>
<p>cuz like I could choose to jump out this fucking window right now but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>choosing not to like if I feel stuck but I could just jump out right now like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in control you have free will you can do whatever you want at any moment</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of fucking stupid to say like a lot of people just act like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the answer it&rsquo;s not the fucking answer because it doesn&rsquo;t feel that good</p>
<p>but the reality of the situation when you feel stuck is you&rsquo;re standing in a</p>
<p>place where with any move you make you feel there is gonna be negative</p>
<p>consequences for it so you don&rsquo;t move it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s safer to just not decide</p>
<p>because you get to avoid the pain that&rsquo;s gonna come with either decision so like</p>
<p>with this girl for her to go for her career and move she&rsquo;s gonna have to</p>
<p>leave her family and move away from them who she&rsquo;s very close to but to stay with</p>
<p>her family she has to choose to limit herself in her career and what she wants</p>
<p>for her life so if you truly want to get unstuck I want you to make a list of</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s gonna come with any decision that you make any fear that you</p>
<p>have any worries that you have literally write it down in a list cuz when you get</p>
<p>shit out of your head and you can look at it it&rsquo;s a lot less overwhelming so if</p>
<p>you have a full list of like the pros and cons of each decision you can then</p>
<p>look at okay which list of consequences am I more willing to choose because you</p>
<p>have to choose you have to pick one universe ain&rsquo;t gonna let you stay still</p>
<p>but also in order to build trust with yourself you have to see you&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>position where you&rsquo;re very uncomfortable you feel stuck and it&rsquo;s not an enjoyable</p>
<p>sensation like you&rsquo;re holding yourself back from either Avenue which is not fun</p>
<p>so in order to show yourself you can trust yourself you have to make a move</p>
<p>you have to make a decision because not making the decision makes you sit in a</p>
<p>place of indecision until something is chosen for you by whatever happens</p>
<p>whatever circumstance that&rsquo;s gonna switch and you&rsquo;re forced into one of the</p>
<p>other that&rsquo;s not a situation where you&rsquo;re gonna build self-trust the way</p>
<p>you build self-trust is taking an action and choosing your action and choosing</p>
<p>your consequences and not just allowing some like greater force or different</p>
<p>circumstances lining up where it one&rsquo;s no longer an option you don&rsquo;t just wait</p>
<p>for shit to happen to you you choose it and you propel yourself forward in the</p>
<p>direction of what you want and doing that puts you in an empowered place and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel safe with yourself and you learn to trust yourself okay so</p>
<p>situation number two there&rsquo;s a girl who is in nursing school and she&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>busy and she swore off relationships but this guy came along and she said don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mind if I do so she&rsquo;s pursuing this guy and she&rsquo;s been seeing this guy but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extremely busy and she&rsquo;s not able to see him more than like once to twice a week</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s concerned and worried that her inability to see him all the time and be</p>
<p>super attentive is gonna make him want to leave her so first thing I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>say is valid concern it&rsquo;s totally normal to feel scared about that it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>normal to be worried about that but first thing I would do in your situation</p>
<p>is address that concern with the guy be like yo like I look I know I&rsquo;m super</p>
<p>fucking busy but it makes me anxious and it makes me concerned that like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna pull off or like you&rsquo;re I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to be as present as you</p>
<p>want me to be like I have a concern that you&rsquo;re gonna like up and leave so first</p>
<p>thing is talking to him about it and then in order to repair the relationship</p>
<p>with yourself I want you to look at what about you makes it hard for you to just</p>
<p>discard why is it hard to leave you so why would someone be willing to only see</p>
<p>you once or twice a week what about you would make them be able to say yes like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to see you a little bit less as long as I get to see you I want</p>
<p>you to go on a scavenger hunt for all your positive traits and all the needs</p>
<p>you can meet for someone that will make them want you enough to not get to see</p>
<p>you all the time so basically look for what you&rsquo;re worth holding on to for why</p>
<p>are you worth holding on to and I want to set your mind free with that and just</p>
<p>let it run wild let it feed you anything you can think of and that&rsquo;s gonna flip</p>
<p>the situation from feeling very insecure like oh my god he could leave me ah and</p>
<p>being like anxious to solidifying your self-esteem but okay I see my value I</p>
<p>recognize it I understand why someone would want to be with me and that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have a lot more empowered sense of moving forward than</p>
<p>like the shaky one of like oh my god he could leave me if I like I don&rsquo;t see him</p>
<p>more than like twice a week okay for our last situation for what would Leo do</p>
<p>this week this girl is realizing that she self sabotages with relationships so</p>
<p>when she has someone that seems like good come along she&rsquo;ll fuck it up she&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>leave or she&rsquo;ll like just abandon the whole thing but if you meet someone that</p>
<p>you think is like too good to be true or you think that they&rsquo;re better than you</p>
<p>or whatever it is they see something in you that you just might not be seeing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worth their attention you&rsquo;re worth being cared about by them because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been lined up with it for a reason so number one is you got to</p>
<p>become aware of that like open yourself up to discovering the ways that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually a match to this person and you&rsquo;re kind of like equal like what are</p>
<p>you able to contribute them like do the scavenger hunt that I talked about for</p>
<p>the last girl but with the situation of meeting someone that you feel like is</p>
<p>better than you or is like on your level and it intimidates you what you&rsquo;re faced</p>
<p>with in that situation is feeling like you&rsquo;re a little bit beneath it and you</p>
<p>get to decide you can run or you can rise to the occasion and improve</p>
<p>yourself and level up to make this work because your relationships are your</p>
<p>biggest teachers your relationships people are your biggest fucking teachers</p>
<p>from the universe from God whoever you want to believe in yeah but like</p>
<p>relationships are your biggest teachers they&rsquo;re your biggest mirror of self</p>
<p>awareness and what you need to become aware of what you need to fix and change</p>
<p>and like they&rsquo;re your ticket for improvement so next time you&rsquo;re faced</p>
<p>with someone that you feel like it&rsquo;s better than you if you notice you feel</p>
<p>the need to run away it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the safer option you don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually able to rise to the occasion or not so give it a fucking</p>
<p>shot but I want to give you the reassurance of you would not be a match</p>
<p>to this person if you weren&rsquo;t ready for it like if someone is pursuing you and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ready for you and you feel like you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re being faced with all</p>
<p>the things that you know you now need to do and change and improve to feel ready</p>
<p>for it like just start leveling yourself up whatever you&rsquo;re insecure about start</p>
<p>flipping it if you&rsquo;re insecure about how much money you make start trying to make</p>
<p>more insecure about your body fix that shit start eating right go to the gym</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worried about your intellect start reading start educating yourself</p>
<p>all the different levels you can level up yourself is gonna be reflected and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna come through insecurities so any insecurity you notice pop up use it</p>
<p>as fuel to flip it and change it and rise to the occasion to fix it and</p>
<p>strengthen it instead of just seeing something that you desperately want and</p>
<p>then running from it because you don&rsquo;t feel good enough look at yourself and</p>
<p>say okay we can do this we can rise to this occasion and then do it if you want</p>
<p>to be featured in a future segment of what would Leo do you can leave a</p>
<p>comment on this YouTube video or you can DM me on Instagram my Instagram is the</p>
<p>Leo Skeppy so just send me your situation and I&rsquo;ll give you my hot take</p>
<p>on it like this it&rsquo;s always anonymous it&rsquo;s always gonna be anonymous I&rsquo;m never</p>
<p>gonna rat you out I&rsquo;ll let nobody know your fucking business I just go general</p>
<p>so that I can give you the advice but if you enjoyed this video leave it a thumbs</p>
<p>up and if you want to be more aware and less aggravated hit the subscribe button</p>
