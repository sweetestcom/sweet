    <p>If you get into the sauna the way I just described,</p>
<p>not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,</p>
<p>twice a week or three times per week,</p>
<p>you reduce the likelihood of dying</p>
<p>of a cardiovascular event by 27%.</p>
<p>If you do it four or more times per week,</p>
<p>you reduce the probability of dying by 50%.</p>
<p>Is there any scientific evidence</p>
<p>that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?</p>
<p>Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I&rsquo;ll have to read up on that.</p>
<p>I think Dorothy Parker said,</p>
<p>the cure for boredom is curiosity.</p>
<p>There is no cure for curiosity.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>his third time on this podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant neuroscientist at Stanford University</p>
<p>and the host of one of the best,</p>
<p>the best, if you ask me,</p>
<p>health and science podcasts in the world</p>
<p>called Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Check him out on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Andrew is a great human being</p>
<p>and has quickly become a great friend.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Riebman Podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>We meet again, my friend.</p>
<p>We should talk on each other&rsquo;s podcast once a year.</p>
<p>I think we should make a deal.</p>
<p>I was just talking to the guys,</p>
<p>this is a show called Louie, I don&rsquo;t know if you know it.</p>
<p>And yeah, with Louie CK.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this thing called Bang Bang,</p>
<p>which people that are probably watching</p>
<p>know exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this worst possible thing you can do</p>
<p>in terms of meals, which is you go to a restaurant,</p>
<p>do a full meal, and then you go to another restaurant</p>
<p>and do a full meal and you pet me.</p>
<p>You, exactly.</p>
<p>So they go Mexican, Italian, sushi, pizza, barbecue,</p>
<p>IHOP, that one is disgusting.</p>
<p>This kind of thing reminds me of the joy of food.</p>
<p>Last time we were hanging out,</p>
<p>we went to see Joe Do Comedy</p>
<p>and then we went to eat Russian food.</p>
<p>And it was a particularly fun experience</p>
<p>to go to a Russian restaurant.</p>
<p>I was the only person there that didn&rsquo;t speak Russian</p>
<p>and eat Russian food with you.</p>
<p>And because I felt walking in, they trusted you.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t trust me.</p>
<p>Yeah, the funny thing about the people there,</p>
<p>they were talking to you in Russian</p>
<p>and then they refused to sort of switch to English,</p>
<p>even though they understood you speak no Russian.</p>
<p>This is Russian House in Austin, by the way.</p>
<p>Anyway, by way of question, what&rsquo;s the worst or the best,</p>
<p>depending on your perspective, cheap meal?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a pigging out meal,</p>
<p>but it could be a cheap meal that you&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>or you want to have that&rsquo;s like on the bucket list</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s in the past,</p>
<p>where you did something like a Bang Bang,</p>
<p>which is like, you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>multiple thousands of calories</p>
<p>that you just feel horrible about yourself</p>
<p>but you still keep eating because it&rsquo;s delicious,</p>
<p>but also great company.</p>
<p>Something about the atmosphere is just right.</p>
<p>Screw the diet, screw all the things,</p>
<p>like you should be doing,</p>
<p>but just throw it all out the window.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that several times.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t do this anymore,</p>
<p>but the entire time I was a postdoc, so five years,</p>
<p>and the entire time I was a pretenured professor,</p>
<p>so five years, so I basically followed</p>
<p>the Tim Ferriss slow carb diet,</p>
<p>which is, people can look it up, but it worked really well.</p>
<p>It was basically some good animal proteins,</p>
<p>fish and meat and things like that.</p>
<p>Why slow carb?</p>
<p>Because slow carb is like low glycemic stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly lentils and beans and things and vegetables,</p>
<p>no dairy, no, anyway, but then one day.</p>
<p>Is pasta in there?</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>No, no pasta.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t low carb, but it was low glycemic carb.</p>
<p>And I did that and it worked terrifically well</p>
<p>just for energy levels,</p>
<p>cause I want to be able to train and work.</p>
<p>And then one day a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to go full cheat day.</p>
<p>And so I would do what used to be 12 hours,</p>
<p>but then it became 24,</p>
<p>you can start to redefine what the day is.</p>
<p>And I would, and that was when Costello was pretty young</p>
<p>and we would do it together.</p>
<p>So I would get pizzas and croissants and donuts,</p>
<p>and I would just do the full thing.</p>
<p>And by the end of the day,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to look at an item of food.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just repulsed by food.</p>
<p>The only modification I made was the next day,</p>
<p>I would fast completely,</p>
<p>just to avoid the gastric distress of eating anything.</p>
<p>And so I would do them on Sundays</p>
<p>and then Mondays I&rsquo;d fast all day.</p>
<p>And then by Tuesday, I felt pretty good again,</p>
<p>but Sunday and Monday,</p>
<p>or you just feel like you&rsquo;re sliding down the slope</p>
<p>of just blood sugar disaster.</p>
<p>Terrible idea or a good idea?</p>
<p>You know, at the time I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I love donuts, croissants, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is after stopping that whole protocol,</p>
<p>now I just try and eat well each day.</p>
<p>Protocol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a protocol.</p>
<p>Now I basically, I do a pseudo intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really strict, but I&rsquo;ll start at eating around 11,</p>
<p>eat my first meal around 11,</p>
<p>I usually train in the morning,</p>
<p>eat my last bite of food somewhere around eight or nine,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not super strict.</p>
<p>I might have some berries or something late at night.</p>
<p>Three meals, two meals?</p>
<p>Two meals.</p>
<p>And then maybe a little bit of snacking on some nuts</p>
<p>or something in the middle.</p>
<p>Ever fast, 24 hour?</p>
<p>Never done a long fast,</p>
<p>except when I was doing the cheat days.</p>
<p>And then, and actually there are a couple different ways</p>
<p>to do cheat days that were fun.</p>
<p>Like if you were in a new city,</p>
<p>you could try all the restaurants that you wanted.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think Tim and our mutual friend,</p>
<p>John Romanello did a,</p>
<p>I think it was like a cheat day marathon where they did,</p>
<p>you know, marathon&rsquo;s 26.3 miles.</p>
<p>They went to 26.3 different locations in New York.</p>
<p>They put it on a map and I never took it to that extreme,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Over how many days?</p>
<p>One day.</p>
<p>That was their cheat day.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Just cause they were, you know.</p>
<p>Just a little bit of something at each place.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, there are things that guys do in their thirties</p>
<p>that you just shouldn&rsquo;t do in your forties.</p>
<p>I can say that cause I&rsquo;m in my forties.</p>
<p>And now I just try and eat well most days.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is about 12 to 14 months ago,</p>
<p>I completely lost all appetite for sweets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>I still love savory food.</p>
<p>So meat and butter and cheese,</p>
<p>and I love vegetables too.</p>
<p>I love fruit also, but lost all appetite.</p>
<p>So if you put a donut in front of me or ice cream</p>
<p>or something like that, I just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost aversive to me and I don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a scientific explanation.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It has to do maybe with habit.</p>
<p>Neuron loss, dementia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The sugar, the desire for that rush maybe is gone</p>
<p>from your soul.</p>
<p>So what was the most delicious things, croissant donuts?</p>
<p>Is there a thing that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a place in Portland.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s still open called Little T&rsquo;s Bakery.</p>
<p>And they have croissants that easily rival</p>
<p>the croissants in Paris.</p>
<p>People make a lot of the pastry in Paris,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really the bread in Paris that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>We lived there when I was a kid and we did a sabbatical</p>
<p>there and you know, there they do the baguette,</p>
<p>morning bake and afternoon bake.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing like the bread in Paris or the people,</p>
<p>you know, and, but if you&rsquo;re in the Pacific Northwest,</p>
<p>you know, you can find amazing croissants there.</p>
<p>What do you do with the croissant?</p>
<p>What do you do with the bread?</p>
<p>Butter or is it just?</p>
<p>I actually used to, I don&rsquo;t eat them anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much of an appetite for them,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re not a sweet food,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m always putting butter on the croissant.</p>
<p>Butter on the butter croissant.</p>
<p>No jam.</p>
<p>I would never adulterate my croissant.</p>
<p>I have to actually be honest about this</p>
<p>because people talk about steak and they talk about bread</p>
<p>with the butter.</p>
<p>I feel like butter is cheating.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re disrespecting the fundamental food</p>
<p>by adding butter.</p>
<p>Cause butter, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a elite version of ketchup.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Well there we diverge because for me,</p>
<p>bread is just a vehicle for butter.</p>
<p>A cracker is just a vehicle for cheese.</p>
<p>Oh, so that&rsquo;s just the,</p>
<p>the cracker and the bread is just texture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that people look at you funny</p>
<p>if you, if you just eat the butter straight,</p>
<p>which occasionally I do.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>So I put a little piece of bread underneath it,</p>
<p>not because I&rsquo;m low carb, strictly low carb,</p>
<p>but just because otherwise you get some funny looks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like pasta is a vehicle for pasta sauce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, but like Indian non bread,</p>
<p>you have, you have the bread.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of soul searching</p>
<p>on which part of Indian is, brings me so much joy.</p>
<p>Is it the bread or is it all the sauces</p>
<p>that come with the bread?</p>
<p>Well, there we diverge again,</p>
<p>because for whatever reason, no disrespect to anyone,</p>
<p>but Indian food doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a lucky man</p>
<p>because the number of calories in that food,</p>
<p>it sneaks like non bread.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how non bread is made,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s just soaked in oil</p>
<p>and it just very intensely,</p>
<p>like the density of calories is very, very high.</p>
<p>For me, barbecue, I would say is probably the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Anytime I&rsquo;m in Austin, I start thinking about barbecue.</p>
<p>I do love, you know, I do love meat.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s Argentine.</p>
<p>I mean, I love steak.</p>
<p>I love meat.</p>
<p>I mean, Argentina chorizo sausage</p>
<p>is an appetizer before you have steak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meat on top of meat.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just, you know, it&rsquo;s not just the men, right?</p>
<p>You see women, sometimes very petite women</p>
<p>eating steaks that are bigger than their skull size.</p>
<p>You know, slowly, they eat very slowly there.</p>
<p>And they all eat dessert too, which is interesting.</p>
<p>And they generally do the sort of one meal per day</p>
<p>and do that kind of real flexibly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think about it.</p>
<p>Cause I often eat one meal a day,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m traveling.</p>
<p>It feels like a cheap meal because it allows,</p>
<p>it gives you a bit of more freedom</p>
<p>to just lose yourself in the quantity of the food.</p>
<p>I did the three day fast and I ate chicken breast,</p>
<p>like literally chicken breast with nothing else,</p>
<p>just grilled.</p>
<p>And it was the most delicious piece of meat I&rsquo;ve ever eaten.</p>
<p>And that, and that gives you,</p>
<p>the problem is when you fast the three days,</p>
<p>you really can&rsquo;t pig out.</p>
<p>You really shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Your stomach will shrink in size already.</p>
<p>Your gut microbiome is almost completely</p>
<p>depleted by fasting.</p>
<p>A lot of people think, oh,</p>
<p>cleanses and fasts are great for the microbiome.</p>
<p>They quash your microbiome.</p>
<p>However, when you start eating again,</p>
<p>the microbiome comes back better</p>
<p>than it was before your fast.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, Sergey and Todd are on the call.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of pulling stuff up.</p>
<p>They just pulled up Phelps with the,</p>
<p>I forget how many calories he was eating, 10,000.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, some cool physiology around this.</p>
<p>The reason he needed to eat so much</p>
<p>is not that he was burning that many calories</p>
<p>in pure movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that when you do exercise in water,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s warm water,</p>
<p>the heat transfer in water is greater.</p>
<p>So you burn far more calories.</p>
<p>And again, here, I&rsquo;m admittedly lifting that</p>
<p>from knowledge that was passed on to me by Tim Ferriss.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, so, but I checked it out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>So if you exercise in water,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not really cold water,</p>
<p>your caloric needs go way up,</p>
<p>which is why you get out of the pool</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re often really hungry.</p>
<p>And for fans of the Human Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not a fan,</p>
<p>what are you doing with your life?</p>
<p>You would probably chuckle at the fact</p>
<p>that Andrew just cited his sources,</p>
<p>even on that statement,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so good at,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how your memory works,</p>
<p>but the only person whose memory</p>
<p>is better than Joe Rogan is yours.</p>
<p>But my colleagues joke,</p>
<p>you know, PubMed sort of scrolls through my mind.</p>
<p>Also in science, as you know,</p>
<p>attribution is so baked into what we do.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because now spending a lot of time on social media,</p>
<p>attribution is not as common.</p>
<p>And, but in academia, you learn really early on</p>
<p>that if you give a talk about your data</p>
<p>and you cite all these amazing sources,</p>
<p>all it does is make you look better, right?</p>
<p>Whereas in social media and elsewhere</p>
<p>in the business sector,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like citing other people,</p>
<p>people feel as if it&rsquo;s going to take away</p>
<p>some of the credit.</p>
<p>All it does is place you in the company</p>
<p>of people that do really nice work.</p>
<p>So I have tremendous,</p>
<p>and I have genuine and tremendous respect for Tim.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been about 10 years ahead</p>
<p>on a huge number of health related things</p>
<p>and other things and extremely kind person,</p>
<p>very thoughtful person.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also just a pleasure to shine light</p>
<p>on other people.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I actually, to push back,</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s a culture of if you write a paper,</p>
<p>standing on the shoulders of giants is a powerful thing,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a culture of not giving credit</p>
<p>to the strongest idea in your paper.</p>
<p>And instead say it&rsquo;s kind of, or imply that it&rsquo;s original.</p>
<p>There is a culture of kind of not celebrating others.</p>
<p>I think people get most competitive in all walks of life,</p>
<p>but especially in science when they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the closer they get in the exact thing they work on.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this dance,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a few researchers</p>
<p>in each of the individual little things that you work on.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re studying a particular kind of ant,</p>
<p>you know that other asshole</p>
<p>that also is studying that particular ant,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re not going to often give credit</p>
<p>for the brilliant ideas that that other researcher is doing.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things you&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>and just as part of your nature,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s really great that you have an audience</p>
<p>and you inspire others to do the same,</p>
<p>is you celebrate that other ant studier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great and everybody wins, it raises all boats.</p>
<p>But that initial instinct to be like,</p>
<p>what is it in Borat?</p>
<p>Like my neighbor gets a toaster, I get a bigger toaster.</p>
<p>Yeah, that mindset to, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not competitive in certain domains,</p>
<p>but yeah, I get great pleasure</p>
<p>from sharing things that I find.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re as strong as your community</p>
<p>and you can build a wonderful community</p>
<p>just by pointing out things that you love.</p>
<p>Like these are all just loves.</p>
<p>I see a paper and I love it.</p>
<p>Only rarely do I think, oh, I wish we had done that.</p>
<p>I usually think, fantastic,</p>
<p>now I can just focus on something else</p>
<p>because they checked off that box.</p>
<p>And by the way, you mentioned PubMed and barbecue.</p>
<p>I should mention that I got a chance to hang out</p>
<p>with Rick Rubin, thanks to you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a friend of yours and you made the connection.</p>
<p>That was a huge gift to my spirit, I guess.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a truly, truly special human being.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot I could say</p>
<p>about why he&rsquo;s a special human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to learn how you met him,</p>
<p>but I should also just mention on the PubMed thing,</p>
<p>it was so interesting talking to him about music</p>
<p>and both on the podcast and privately</p>
<p>and just listening to music together.</p>
<p>Because when you mention a song,</p>
<p>he does this thing where he like closes his eyes</p>
<p>and he finds that song in the album that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>and he steps through the album.</p>
<p>You could see the brain like stepping</p>
<p>through individual songs to find that song in the album.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that kind of lookup process.</p>
<p>And then he puts himself mentally in that space</p>
<p>of like, okay, this is, you know, whatever the album is.</p>
<p>And not just the ones he produced,</p>
<p>but all of these in the encyclopedia of music.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>It also, the thing I really love about him</p>
<p>is something like a calmness that radiates from him.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s okay to close your eyes and place yourself</p>
<p>in the place where that album was recorded,</p>
<p>in the feeling of that album and like that silence.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there, let&rsquo;s go there together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Alice in Wonderland and we&rsquo;ll go there together.</p>
<p>You do a good Rick Rubin, minus the beard.</p>
<p>Minus the beard.</p>
<p>His beard is epic, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fake a beard like that, you know.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you guys meet?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, Rick, I&rsquo;m very blessed to consider a close friend.</p>
<p>Rick and I got introduced through a common friend</p>
<p>during the pandemic.</p>
<p>And we started doing some FaceTime together</p>
<p>and just talking about things related to science and health.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a musician, I have no musical ability or talent.</p>
<p>I have a good ability to memorize lyrics</p>
<p>and I love lyrics and I love poetry.</p>
<p>So I asked him a lot of questions about musicians</p>
<p>that I happen to love that he&rsquo;s worked with and knows.</p>
<p>And so he would give me stories about musicians</p>
<p>and I would talk to him about health.</p>
<p>And then eventually we formed a friendship</p>
<p>where we would talk about any number</p>
<p>of different topics in life.</p>
<p>And then we started spending time together in person</p>
<p>when he was in town or nearby.</p>
<p>And as you now know, you know, Rick,</p>
<p>in addition to all his incredible accomplishments,</p>
<p>has an incredible understanding</p>
<p>of how to get the brain and body into state, right?</p>
<p>And as you pointed out, he&rsquo;s willing to do the things</p>
<p>that allow him to help these incredible artists</p>
<p>get into the best state to do their craft.</p>
<p>And so if he needs to sit there and be quiet</p>
<p>with his eyes closed for a minute or two or more,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>He has routines to allow himself to get into state.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really inspired me to think about states of mind</p>
<p>as something that, you know, we&rsquo;d all love</p>
<p>to just flip the switch and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re focused or we&rsquo;re creative,</p>
<p>but to actually ratchet through the challenging steps</p>
<p>in order to do that and to figure out</p>
<p>what one needs to do on a regular basis</p>
<p>to get into a proper state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just gonna come from a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>you know, a lamp of a particular wavelength or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be those things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also going to be really teaching oneself</p>
<p>how to get into proper state.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did an episode on hypnosis.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a kind of self hypnosis?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Because hypnosis is a, you limit the context,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very alert and you&rsquo;re very calm.</p>
<p>And he has a number of these different practices.</p>
<p>And so we would talk about those.</p>
<p>And then we also have enjoyed a lot of discussions</p>
<p>about deep neuroscience.</p>
<p>In fact, I introduced Rick to a friend of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve become friendly.</p>
<p>You know, Rick is one of these people</p>
<p>that he sort of defies definition, incredibly kind,</p>
<p>incredibly private person too.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m being respectful of that.</p>
<p>But, and then of course he&rsquo;s a fan of your podcast.</p>
<p>And so when I learned that,</p>
<p>I just made natural sense to introduce you.</p>
<p>And I know he really enjoyed meeting you.</p>
<p>And we talk about you a lot.</p>
<p>And of course, in a positive light, you know,</p>
<p>I think his dedication to getting into these states of mind</p>
<p>and his willingness to do that</p>
<p>has completely transformed my routines around life.</p>
<p>Like for instance,</p>
<p>before doing a very long podcast recording,</p>
<p>the solo ones, which often take me several hours or more,</p>
<p>six hours to record, sometimes more, sometimes less.</p>
<p>I realized that there&rsquo;s a certain brain state</p>
<p>associated with that.</p>
<p>So I have to really limit the kind of interactions I have</p>
<p>for the two hours before.</p>
<p>I actually walk and talk out loud through my neighborhood.</p>
<p>People think I&rsquo;m crazy,</p>
<p>but I live in a neighborhood</p>
<p>where there are a lot of crazy creatives anyway.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Are you saying you&rsquo;re not crazy?</p>
<p>Well, at least not institutionally defined as crazy yet.</p>
<p>But, you know, getting into state of mind</p>
<p>is something that we&rsquo;d all just imagine we flip the switch,</p>
<p>but Rick really convinced me,</p>
<p>you have to do the work to do the work.</p>
<p>Can you maybe linger on that,</p>
<p>elucidate a little bit more of your process</p>
<p>of how you get in that space?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Cause I have to admit,</p>
<p>I do everything last minute before a podcast.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of anxiety because like whatever,</p>
<p>if I have to pack, if I have to set up stuff,</p>
<p>you were luckily a few minutes,</p>
<p>you showed up a few minutes later.</p>
<p>Which for an academic is right on time.</p>
<p>Right on time.</p>
<p>But the stress is immense.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>you look at like a situation with Rick Rubin,</p>
<p>is I had to set up microphones in front of him</p>
<p>and just that stress, the anxiety.</p>
<p>He knows a lot about microphones.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>Which I really loved.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, how close do you like the microphone to be?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very Rick Rubin kind of thing, right?</p>
<p>That the details really matter.</p>
<p>The details really matter,</p>
<p>right down to your relationship to the microphone, right?</p>
<p>Distance and whether or not it brings out the timbre</p>
<p>in your voice.</p>
<p>But of course that&rsquo;s what he does.</p>
<p>He produces music.</p>
<p>But he also said like, you know, he is the professional.</p>
<p>He said, how close do you like it to be?</p>
<p>And he said it with a gentleness</p>
<p>where I had like an existential crisis.</p>
<p>Where I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He gave me so much like, wow.</p>
<p>Like he made me feel like an artist.</p>
<p>Like that the microphone distance</p>
<p>is a decision you&rsquo;re supposed to make.</p>
<p>Well, I have to say, and this has actually come up</p>
<p>in some of our conversations about you.</p>
<p>I mean, you are, you are an artist.</p>
<p>And actually Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>once I heard him talking about podcasting</p>
<p>and the fact that he&rsquo;s always trying to get better at it,</p>
<p>you know, and he described podcasting at one moment</p>
<p>as an art, right?</p>
<p>And it is, it&rsquo;s a certain medium of communication</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a cadence and a rhythm that when it&rsquo;s working,</p>
<p>it really can facilitate the transfer of information.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s not, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously Joe just being himself</p>
<p>has tapped into that cadence that allows</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s made so many people excited to hear him talk.</p>
<p>Well, in his case and in general,</p>
<p>I think part of the art is refusing the world</p>
<p>as you get a bigger audience, change who you are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one quote that I&rsquo;ve seen out there where he says,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m like the, talking about himself, he says,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m like the fish that got through the net.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no stage version of me, right?</p>
<p>How he is in person is how he is, you know,</p>
<p>out in the world.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s nuance to his life, right?</p>
<p>And his different relationships, of course, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve had the, you know,</p>
<p>the great fortune of spending time with him</p>
<p>out away from the microphones, so to speak.</p>
<p>Joe is Joe.</p>
<p>So can you speak to your, that process you mentioned,</p>
<p>the walking and the talking to yourself?</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try and do a couple of things.</p>
<p>First of all, when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I had a little bit of a grunting tick.</p>
<p>When I was five or six,</p>
<p>I would feel this buildup of tension in my throat</p>
<p>and I would do this grunting tick.</p>
<p>If I get very tired, I start to do it still.</p>
<p>We actually know that this is related</p>
<p>to these basal ganglia circuits for go, no go.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got an accelerator and a brake basically</p>
<p>in your neural circuitry and kids with Tourette&rsquo;s and OCD,</p>
<p>the brake doesn&rsquo;t work quite as well.</p>
<p>And so one thing that happens is if I wake up</p>
<p>in the morning and especially if I&rsquo;m well rested,</p>
<p>well, if I&rsquo;m not well rested, I do a hypnosis</p>
<p>or yoga nidra in order to recover my sleep.</p>
<p>That works really well.</p>
<p>But then once I&rsquo;m into the process of preparing the podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already gone through my notes.</p>
<p>I know what I want to say more or less</p>
<p>in a kind of general contour.</p>
<p>And then I take a walk and I try to, so no phone with me.</p>
<p>And I try to assess whether or not my energy is too high</p>
<p>or too low for podcasting.</p>
<p>Because when you podcast, as you know,</p>
<p>you have to punch out a lot of material,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s times when you really need to slow down</p>
<p>and emphasize and articulate.</p>
<p>And so what I do, I&rsquo;ve never revealed this.</p>
<p>What I do actually is I will recite the lyrics of songs</p>
<p>for about 10 minutes, songs I love while I walk out loud.</p>
<p>It calms you and focuses you, what does it do for you?</p>
<p>I think it gets my vocal cords warmed up and it also.</p>
<p>Do you sing or speak them?</p>
<p>I often sing them and fortunately nobody hears.</p>
<p>And as I do this, I start to evaluate</p>
<p>whether or not I&rsquo;m straining to get the words out</p>
<p>or whether or not I&rsquo;m straining to make them slow enough</p>
<p>so that I can articulate them.</p>
<p>So there are days when I have so much energy</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to speak faster than I should</p>
<p>in order to articulate properly.</p>
<p>There are other days when I&rsquo;m tired</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t sort of keep up with my thoughts.</p>
<p>And so what I try and do is assess that</p>
<p>and then adjust the transmission, the RPM, so to speak.</p>
<p>For instance, I can speak very quickly</p>
<p>and then I can slow down.</p>
<p>So I can change the cadence of my voice.</p>
<p>And when you teach in the classroom,</p>
<p>you learn as you know,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re an excellent teacher,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched your lectures in the classroom.</p>
<p>As you teach in the classroom, when you want to slow down,</p>
<p>every teacher knows you turn to the whiteboard or chalkboard</p>
<p>and you start writing, right?</p>
<p>It gives you a break.</p>
<p>And then you turn around and you fire back</p>
<p>the kind of machine gun fire of information.</p>
<p>And then you slow down or you underline something.</p>
<p>When you podcast, you don&rsquo;t have that opportunity, right?</p>
<p>There are no visuals in my podcast.</p>
<p>So what I try and do is always get my voice warmed up</p>
<p>and make sure that I&rsquo;m thinking and speaking</p>
<p>at approximately the same rate.</p>
<p>And then I also do this thing of as I put my vision</p>
<p>into panoramic vision when I walk, which is very calming.</p>
<p>And then I actually start to remind myself</p>
<p>of the purpose of podcasting.</p>
<p>This sounds very mission statementy,</p>
<p>but you asked what I do.</p>
<p>I remind myself first and foremost</p>
<p>that what I want to communicate,</p>
<p>what I want to come through is the beauty</p>
<p>and utility of biology.</p>
<p>And I only feel comfortable saying the word beauty</p>
<p>publicly now about science things thanks to you,</p>
<p>because I think.</p>
<p>Love and beauty.</p>
<p>Yeah, love and beauty.</p>
<p>Dr. Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>Love and beauty, but also darkness and hatred.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re talking about the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>you have to adjust,</p>
<p>you have to address the shadow also, the shadow side.</p>
<p>But I think about the,</p>
<p>I want to communicate the beauty and utility of biology.</p>
<p>And then I check my emotional state.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that I&rsquo;m not angry about anything.</p>
<p>And certainly if I am that I&rsquo;m going to set it aside</p>
<p>for the podcast,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not a place for my,</p>
<p>whatever I might be dealing with.</p>
<p>I also really start to feel into the parts of the research</p>
<p>and the papers I found that I really love,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the part of me that I like the most frankly.</p>
<p>And on the podcast, if there&rsquo;s a paper,</p>
<p>like for instance, we have a paper, excuse me,</p>
<p>a podcast coming out soon about heat as a tool,</p>
<p>sauna, but some other things.</p>
<p>And in researching this,</p>
<p>I learned so much about these heat shock proteins</p>
<p>and the use of sauna in Finland</p>
<p>for increasing growth hormone,</p>
<p>but also for the treatment of mental illness.</p>
<p>And I realized I fell in love with this literature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a beautiful literature.</p>
<p>These people are true pioneers for doing this work.</p>
<p>Now everyone&rsquo;s in the sauna, but this was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>The way the experiments were done were amazing</p>
<p>with all these Finnish people with thermocouples up there,</p>
<p>rectum to measure temperature, swimming in pools.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious and great.</p>
<p>And so I start to think about, and I think,</p>
<p>I just start to really access my love of the work.</p>
<p>And then when we finally sit down,</p>
<p>meaning my producer Rob and I and record,</p>
<p>I just sort of want to just bask in sharing it.</p>
<p>Just like the little version of me when I was six or seven,</p>
<p>I used to spend all weekend reading the encyclopedia,</p>
<p>Guinness Book of World Records,</p>
<p>making my mother drive me places to introduce me to,</p>
<p>I had this obsession with trapping animals</p>
<p>when I was a kid, meet these people.</p>
<p>And then on Monday, I would insist on giving a lecture</p>
<p>in class, which as a little kid.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s basically what it is.</p>
<p>I just try and access that childlike energy.</p>
<p>And so I want to be clear.</p>
<p>The goal is always to make the information interesting,</p>
<p>clear and actionable.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s also surprising, then that&rsquo;s a bonus.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s basically the process.</p>
<p>But yeah, I&rsquo;m singing and talking and getting into state.</p>
<p>And I used to feel very sheepish about sharing any of this.</p>
<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever shared it out loud,</p>
<p>but Rick was the one who encouraged me</p>
<p>to find a process that works</p>
<p>and continue to develop that process</p>
<p>and not let anything get near that process.</p>
<p>People in my personal life know this.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what else is going on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving into that brain state.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably a process like that</p>
<p>for anything that you do in life that you take seriously.</p>
<p>So the people that have perfected this is athletes.</p>
<p>Like if Olympic level athletes,</p>
<p>they have to have a process like this.</p>
<p>You know what, I think Tiger Woods actually</p>
<p>was taught self hypnosis quite young</p>
<p>and use self hypnosis often during his tournaments,</p>
<p>sometimes to great success and other times less so.</p>
<p>Is there other places in life that you use</p>
<p>kind of a protocol, like a mental protocol to get ready?</p>
<p>Many of the best areas of life</p>
<p>are their own form of hypnosis, right?</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>You know that you&rsquo;re in hypnosis,</p>
<p>if for instance, you&rsquo;re in a movie and something happens</p>
<p>and you feel the emotional lift</p>
<p>without being self conscious about it.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that one thing that we&rsquo;ve tried to do</p>
<p>in our house is around meal times to try and set a state</p>
<p>that food isn&rsquo;t just something</p>
<p>that we just throw down our throats.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fortunate that my partner cooks really well.</p>
<p>And so I try and give her the space to do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the whole thing of her getting into state.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>For the cooking.</p>
<p>The preparation of all the.</p>
<p>I can just see it.</p>
<p>I just see the way she approaches the whole thing</p>
<p>and the pleasure in serving it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m an eater, not a cooker.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Both are important roles.</p>
<p>You could be a very good eater.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>is there anything better in this world than that feeling?</p>
<p>Especially if it&rsquo;s a family, getting around a table.</p>
<p>Just the warmth of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the cold outside of the cruel world</p>
<p>cannot touch you in this place that you&rsquo;ve returned to.</p>
<p>And if.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Did you grow up eating meals as a family?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>No television?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really have television period outside of meals.</p>
<p>So most of my time was spent, you know,</p>
<p>like a stray cat outdoors, just running around,</p>
<p>playing soccer.</p>
<p>I imagine you in this like dirt or concrete lot</p>
<p>between two very high rise buildings playing soccer</p>
<p>in like athletic gear that you only see in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>You know how like you come to the States</p>
<p>and people wear their athletic gear.</p>
<p>You go to Europe and you see, maybe it&rsquo;s the soccer culture,</p>
<p>but you see athletic gear</p>
<p>that you just don&rsquo;t see anywhere else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I grew up pretty poor.</p>
<p>So first of all, I was always wearing my brother&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an older brother, brother&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>And they were like old, like my favorite things</p>
<p>were American things that I didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It would be like a Pepsi shirt or something.</p>
<p>And it was just, that was the gear.</p>
<p>And it was like too large for me,</p>
<p>but I thought I was the coolest person ever</p>
<p>just wearing this fancy like Kanye like type of fashion.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>I feel like in Eastern Europe,</p>
<p>they wear athletic gear where like the guys like zip up.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s like fancy stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s if you like, those are the cool kids.</p>
<p>I see, I see.</p>
<p>Like the cool soccer players, football players</p>
<p>that like they were in a league of some kind.</p>
<p>So they would get uniforms or like, or they somehow,</p>
<p>I always thought anyone who had anything nice</p>
<p>had to do something really bad to get it.</p>
<p>That was my way, view of the world.</p>
<p>Because like, I guess I didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s possible to be rich.</p>
<p>Cause most of us were surrounded by people who are poor</p>
<p>and that life is beautiful and simple.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, why do you escape that life?</p>
<p>But you still admire the cool,</p>
<p>like when we got McDonald&rsquo;s, it was like,</p>
<p>what kind of world does this place come from?</p>
<p>Like who invented this?</p>
<p>This is a fascinating view from a child&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>of like, of capitalism essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the fact that you ate dinner together</p>
<p>is really interesting.</p>
<p>My parents divorced when I was an adolescent.</p>
<p>So then there was a total fracture of any family structure.</p>
<p>But prior to that, we ate dinner together every night.</p>
<p>I was expected to know how to use my knife and fork.</p>
<p>And it was like a very structured thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if kids do that now.</p>
<p>If I ever have kids, they&rsquo;re gonna do that.</p>
<p>And certainly, actually on the way over here,</p>
<p>I was thinking, I was like, I really want a lot of kids.</p>
<p>I want like a whole litter.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, if Lex has kids and I have kids,</p>
<p>then we can like pit them against each other with jujitsu.</p>
<p>This is my chance at redemption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the law game.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll all wanna be engineers or physicists.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t wanna be biologists.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, I look forward to the day</p>
<p>that our kids play together.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>so the family dinner, the ritual of the family dinner,</p>
<p>but also the special occasion dinners,</p>
<p>like where there&rsquo;s a little bit more preparation,</p>
<p>a little bit more cooking,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s on the weekend or for some holiday.</p>
<p>In Russia, it was a thing that actually</p>
<p>I find completely missing for the most part.</p>
<p>In America is there was neighbors.</p>
<p>There was a, you broke the walls</p>
<p>between families much more commonly.</p>
<p>Like there would be kinda regular characters,</p>
<p>like a sitcom almost.</p>
<p>If you watch the sitcom, it&rsquo;s never just the family.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always like other characters that.</p>
<p>Just bursting in the door.</p>
<p>Bursting in the door.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start doing that here,</p>
<p>just to make you feel at home.</p>
<p>Just start showing up at your studio.</p>
<p>I know where you live.</p>
<p>I think people wanna respect,</p>
<p>like Michael Malice lives next door to me.</p>
<p>And I think people wanna respect each other&rsquo;s privacy</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And I think we all get super busy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of work</p>
<p>to do this dinner together.</p>
<p>Or if you see it as a thing that needs to be scheduled,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>We get busy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s part of a ritual, a part of the culture,</p>
<p>all of those walls get broken down.</p>
<p>And then you realize like that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>like later looking back, those are the things you miss.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what life is about.</p>
<p>Like all the stupid stuff you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in terms of career or whatever,</p>
<p>all the busy things, those don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is the people.</p>
<p>In academia, this changed in the last few years, of course.</p>
<p>But one of the great joys was professors will stop by</p>
<p>your office or your lab.</p>
<p>Nobody set up an appointment.</p>
<p>There was a guy when I was a professor in San Diego,</p>
<p>a guy named Harvey Cartney,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a member of the National Academies,</p>
<p>truly the world&rsquo;s expert in the evolution of vision</p>
<p>and evolution of brains generally.</p>
<p>And he would show up in my lab</p>
<p>and he would just start talking to the students in postdocs.</p>
<p>And I mean, a pure encyclopedia.</p>
<p>And then at some point you&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>hey, Harvey, I gotta go.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d have, you&rsquo;d kick him out, right?</p>
<p>Or this guy, he&rsquo;s a physicist, David Klinefield,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s, same way.</p>
<p>Actually, David Klinefield is an interesting one.</p>
<p>A student of his went on to create</p>
<p>the Beavis and Butthead cartoon.</p>
<p>And one of them is David, he&rsquo;s a physics professor.</p>
<p>Now people can look him up.</p>
<p>And David&rsquo;s one of those guys who just walk into your office</p>
<p>and you just sit down and you just start talking to you.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a kind of a family field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Cheers or Seinfeld or one of those shows</p>
<p>where somebody just walks in.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think you and I both share a love</p>
<p>of the community around things.</p>
<p>And podcasting is a little bit more isolated.</p>
<p>I should say for the guest episodes,</p>
<p>the preparation is completely different</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more conversational.</p>
<p>And so there, I don&rsquo;t do any of this business</p>
<p>of putting myself into state.</p>
<p>I just try and make sure that the guest is taken care of.</p>
<p>And I do list out the questions I&rsquo;m gonna ask before,</p>
<p>but those actually really like the interview episodes</p>
<p>far more than I like doing the solo ones.</p>
<p>Just psychologically I mean.</p>
<p>I just like learning from someone directly</p>
<p>because you asking an expert about something,</p>
<p>like sitting here with you when we recorded the podcast</p>
<p>where you were a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>And for the first time, and finally,</p>
<p>someone was explaining to me the difference</p>
<p>between machine learning, artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and all these other things.</p>
<p>You know, and I&rsquo;ve finally forgiven you</p>
<p>for making me cry about Costello on camera,</p>
<p>because it helped me move through it.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, the interview ones</p>
<p>are a sheer pleasure.</p>
<p>The solo ones I really enjoy, but they&rsquo;re work.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think like I&rsquo;m gonna sweat</p>
<p>a little blood prepping for them.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because I do think prepping</p>
<p>for interviews, having a similar process</p>
<p>might be also very valuable.</p>
<p>Like I have to think about that</p>
<p>because I think when you do a conversation</p>
<p>for several hours, especially when it&rsquo;s a high stakes one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you and I know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like it&rsquo;s just chatting and so on.</p>
<p>The world order isn&rsquo;t gonna shift according to it.</p>
<p>Although you never know, knowing you will probably</p>
<p>be into some pretty controversial topics in a few minutes.</p>
<p>You like to ride the edge more than I do.</p>
<p>There are a number of topics that I just completely avoid.</p>
<p>And my response to those is always that</p>
<p>I have a lot of opinions about that,</p>
<p>but not a lot to say, you know.</p>
<p>But whereas you&rsquo;ve become far braver</p>
<p>in terms of the topics you&rsquo;ll encounter</p>
<p>and some of your guests have been a bit controversial.</p>
<p>Some of them are people that a lot of people don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve been willing to just sit down</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s the jujitsu thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it is tricky.</p>
<p>One of my goals for this year is to talk to people</p>
<p>that a lot of people really don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Are you gonna share with us?</p>
<p>And here I am.</p>
<p>People that are in prison, major political leaders</p>
<p>have been thinking a lot about how to talk</p>
<p>to really difficult, controversial figures,</p>
<p>but find together something with them</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deeply honest about their nature,</p>
<p>about the ideas they have about the world.</p>
<p>Reveal something real.</p>
<p>And some people, you have to be very careful,</p>
<p>some people are very good at hiding the real inside them,</p>
<p>even from themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I think about a lot.</p>
<p>I think about dictators of the past</p>
<p>and I put myself in the mindset,</p>
<p>well, how do you reveal something real</p>
<p>about this person to themselves?</p>
<p>I think that to me, and you kind of spoke to that,</p>
<p>but a great conversation is one where</p>
<p>both of you discover something new.</p>
<p>So I love that too, that&rsquo;s my favorite thing</p>
<p>what you mentioned, which is allowing your curiosity</p>
<p>and ask all kinds of questions and get excited</p>
<p>and to learn from an expert.</p>
<p>But also to push them to discover something</p>
<p>about themselves, about their ideas together.</p>
<p>And then that discovery, and sometimes it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t see it in the moment, but the audience hears it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to say, I would compare it to</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a musician and you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>with other musicians, you lose yourself in the moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s working right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working, but you don&rsquo;t really see the big picture</p>
<p>impact of what it&rsquo;s working right actually feels like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the audience could see that.</p>
<p>If you talk to somebody evil,</p>
<p>for me as an interviewer, I have to empathize</p>
<p>with that person.</p>
<p>If I want to understand, I have to put myself</p>
<p>in that mind space, and to put yourself in that mindset,</p>
<p>you really have to understand the evil inside of you.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t just think if somebody&rsquo;s in power</p>
<p>and has used that power to abuse others,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just be a, I personally,</p>
<p>a person who seeks to understand.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just be a journalist asking generic questions.</p>
<p>You have to put yourself in a place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s given a lot of power</p>
<p>and slowly you start to abuse that power.</p>
<p>And what does that person become?</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>I have to plug myself into those moments in my life</p>
<p>in the past where I&rsquo;ve been angry at something</p>
<p>and where I&rsquo;ve been cruel because I was angry.</p>
<p>In little ways, but then you magnify them at scale</p>
<p>and I have to go there and that&rsquo;s very human.</p>
<p>And then I have to look at another person</p>
<p>from across the table for me and understand,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re there too.</p>
<p>And then you had more opportunity to do truly cruel things.</p>
<p>And then where, like I have to plug myself</p>
<p>into places where I&rsquo;ve been, I can imagine I can go,</p>
<p>where I was cruel to others and was unaware of it.</p>
<p>So I was in a mind space where I was thinking</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m doing good and I was doing not good.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ve never gotten the opportunity</p>
<p>to do any of those things at large scale,</p>
<p>but all of us have done it at a small scale.</p>
<p>And I plug myself into that and then we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re to, if it&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s in prison,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s a dictator,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in that space where evil is,</p>
<p>all of us have the capacity to do that evil</p>
<p>and I have to imagine myself being able to do that evil.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re here together in that dark, dark place.</p>
<p>And then if it&rsquo;s just right,</p>
<p>something real can actually come,</p>
<p>something from that person&rsquo;s childhood,</p>
<p>maybe awakening to a realization</p>
<p>that I thought it was a good person and I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>And that only happens when you truly empathize.</p>
<p>Those moments of discovery are beautiful,</p>
<p>but they also happen in science.</p>
<p>When you just have a conversation and you realize,</p>
<p>I feel like talking to Stephen Wolfram,</p>
<p>I feel like we constantly realize</p>
<p>beautiful things together.</p>
<p>On this element of evil and sociopathy,</p>
<p>that Jung had this notion that we have all things inside us</p>
<p>and that we all have the capacity to be good or evil,</p>
<p>et cetera, but I have the good fortune</p>
<p>of working with somebody who has deep understanding</p>
<p>of psychiatry, but also psychoanalysis</p>
<p>and Jungian theory.</p>
<p>And he said to me recently, he said,</p>
<p>whether or not all people have all things inside them</p>
<p>is still debated in the psychology community</p>
<p>and in the neuroscience community.</p>
<p>And as a matter of philosophy,</p>
<p>but there are certain people, not many,</p>
<p>but there are certain people</p>
<p>for whom they&rsquo;ve actually lived out many versions</p>
<p>of their possible selves in the first person.</p>
<p>And so those are unique individuals.</p>
<p>Then even if they tapped into these things,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, at a more minor level,</p>
<p>as opposed to impacting people negatively at scale.</p>
<p>So being able to access those different parts of oneself</p>
<p>is key and you&rsquo;ve been willing to step into that.</p>
<p>My podcast is not one in which we get down to those matters.</p>
<p>Yet, yet.</p>
<p>You never know, we might do an episode</p>
<p>on narcissism and sociopathy.</p>
<p>The other thing that I took away from a conversation</p>
<p>with a friend, he was a lot of years in special operations</p>
<p>in the intelligence community.</p>
<p>He said, if you look at somebody&rsquo;s past,</p>
<p>at some point you will come to understand</p>
<p>some pretty good reasons as to why they became who they are,</p>
<p>but you have to draw the, his words,</p>
<p>the red line someplace.</p>
<p>And what he was referring to was the fact</p>
<p>that certain people, at least in the eyes</p>
<p>of certain communities deserve to be eliminated</p>
<p>as a consequence of their actions, right?</p>
<p>Regardless of what drove them to those actions.</p>
<p>So it gets right down to the line</p>
<p>between nature, nurture, neuroscience,</p>
<p>and the law and justice.</p>
<p>Complicated, complicated themes.</p>
<p>I can think of a number of people</p>
<p>that I would love to hear you interview.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not revealing the reasons why,</p>
<p>but except for the fact that I think</p>
<p>you would be uniquely suited to bring out</p>
<p>the important components of the conversation</p>
<p>that other people have not been able to do,</p>
<p>which for instance, Liz Holmes,</p>
<p>this is one of the most mysterious</p>
<p>and yet disliked people on the planet.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s sort of synonymous with deception.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;ve been any real interviews</p>
<p>of her since the whole thing.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t followed that case.</p>
<p>I listened to the book and I followed it a little bit</p>
<p>because it was happening in my hometown, right?</p>
<p>Theranos was right up the road.</p>
<p>The building&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some of the most premier real estate</p>
<p>in Silicon Valley, but nobody wants it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like, it&rsquo;s very hard to sell a home</p>
<p>where somebody committed suicide or committed a murder,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a beautiful home.</p>
<p>It sort of feel like the Theranos building is that building.</p>
<p>So that would be a really interesting interview.</p>
<p>I would love to hear that interview.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting dark human beings in science.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then there&rsquo;ll even be people that say,</p>
<p>was it even science, right?</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve all been deception.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been one part deception,</p>
<p>one part goal setting mixed in with,</p>
<p>clearly that there were so many factors</p>
<p>impacting what happened.</p>
<p>I think the big difference between Theranos and that story</p>
<p>and some of the other stories about Silicon Valley</p>
<p>where people promised a lot more than they could deliver</p>
<p>is they were promising things that were directly related</p>
<p>to health and healthcare.</p>
<p>People were taking blood tests with the understanding</p>
<p>that the data they were getting was important,</p>
<p>information about sexually transmitted diseases</p>
<p>and other diseases and making real world decisions</p>
<p>on the basis of that.</p>
<p>Whereas if you remember when the iPhone first came out</p>
<p>and Steve Jobs was still alive</p>
<p>and the phones were dropping calls</p>
<p>if you held it in a particular way.</p>
<p>And his response was a little flip.</p>
<p>He said, hey folks, it&rsquo;s a phone</p>
<p>as if like don&rsquo;t get so worked up.</p>
<p>But people held them understandably to a very high standard.</p>
<p>She sort of, it seemed, and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>cause I certainly wasn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>seemed like she sort of adopted this idea</p>
<p>that you could get it wrong a bunch of times</p>
<p>before you get it right.</p>
<p>Except if the allegations are true.</p>
<p>And I think she was found guilty, I believe,</p>
<p>on a number of counts.</p>
<p>That a number of the things that they were doing</p>
<p>were impacting real world decision making.</p>
<p>So Steve&rsquo;s point about the phone, it&rsquo;s just a phone.</p>
<p>Well, it depends on the call.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re calling 911, then it&rsquo;s not just a phone, right?</p>
<p>But in the case of blood tests and disease,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s serious.</p>
<p>I think that the Theranos case was super interesting to me</p>
<p>because of the number of people from major universities</p>
<p>and from government that both trusted her</p>
<p>and the number of people who did not trust her</p>
<p>and yet either didn&rsquo;t speak up or no one listened to them.</p>
<p>It was only in the forensic version of it</p>
<p>that everyone said, oh yeah, I knew that she was lying,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>They were lying to multiple people involved</p>
<p>in those lies apparently.</p>
<p>But I have a deep interest in the neuroscience</p>
<p>of narcissism, sociopathy,</p>
<p>and some of the darker aspects of the mind.</p>
<p>So yeah, maybe someday.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll do a podcast together.</p>
<p>I mean, like in the kind of early 90s version of talk shows</p>
<p>where we darken the lights and we do it together,</p>
<p>you can use your voice</p>
<p>because your voice is much more sinister sounding than mine.</p>
<p>Good cop, bad cop.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;d be interesting from a scientific perspective</p>
<p>of somebody who is a sociopath or a psychopath,</p>
<p>how to reveal something real about them.</p>
<p>I think that requires not just,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t know what that requires.</p>
<p>That requires the same skill</p>
<p>that it takes to be a good therapist.</p>
<p>Right, and some therapists won&rsquo;t work with sociopaths</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t feel any progress can be made.</p>
<p>Some therapists will work with sociopaths</p>
<p>because for the wealthy ones,</p>
<p>they often, they want their money.</p>
<p>I think most therapists are good and benevolent,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some that will do it</p>
<p>just the same way lawyers will work with criminals</p>
<p>knowing they&rsquo;re criminals, right?</p>
<p>Oftentimes because they&rsquo;re criminals.</p>
<p>There are certain domains of psychiatry</p>
<p>that are more tractable than others, right?</p>
<p>Borderlines are interesting.</p>
<p>I should just mention</p>
<p>because they have this phenomenon of splitting.</p>
<p>So in the world of psychology,</p>
<p>the idea is that being neurotic is actually the goal.</p>
<p>The idea that you could be, you know,</p>
<p>feel something and then work a lot to overcome it</p>
<p>or have some sort of defense mechanism in place,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not destructive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a pretty healthy state to be in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s provided it&rsquo;s not destructive.</p>
<p>Psychotic is truly delusional thinking about reality.</p>
<p>And the idea is that borderlines split,</p>
<p>intermittently split between psychotic and neurotic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it was called,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s beautiful work by Melanie Klein that describes this,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m just now kind of delving into.</p>
<p>But, you know, so the borderline is the person who is like,</p>
<p>I love you, I love you, I love you,</p>
<p>and then truly feels as if they hate you</p>
<p>and you become the bad object.</p>
<p>So borderlines are challenging for psychologists</p>
<p>because of the splitting, right?</p>
<p>Schizophrenics are challenging</p>
<p>because of the detachment from reality.</p>
<p>And narcissists are challenging</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re often so charming</p>
<p>that even the therapists are charmed.</p>
<p>I believe you mentioned Karl Deisseroth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about him.</p>
<p>He was definitely not a narcissist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the more humble people, but he is brilliant.</p>
<p>Thanks again to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve connected us.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of having a conversation with him.</p>
<p>You had a conversation with him.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it on the podcast.</p>
<p>You guys come from the same science, from the same place,</p>
<p>maybe different journeys, fascinating.</p>
<p>And levels.</p>
<p>We were postdocs together.</p>
<p>Karl is truly the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky,</p>
<p>five children, amazing marriage to it.</p>
<p>Also an amazing scientist.</p>
<p>His wife, Michelle Monge,</p>
<p>is in our neurology department at Stanford.</p>
<p>An incredible thinker, writer, very kind person, humble.</p>
<p>Speaking of getting into state,</p>
<p>sorry, Karl, I&rsquo;m gonna out you on this,</p>
<p>but Karl, despite being at the highest levels</p>
<p>of science and engineering and a practicing psychiatrist,</p>
<p>his office is literally a coat closet</p>
<p>with a small table lamp.</p>
<p>When you meet with Karl, if you manage to meet with him,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very hard to get to,</p>
<p>you walk in, you sit down</p>
<p>as if you&rsquo;re going through some interrogation</p>
<p>and some spy novel.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll ask you, what are you most excited about lately?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got 11 minutes or something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a meeting with Karl, because he&rsquo;s that busy.</p>
<p>But he doesn&rsquo;t have the office with the pictures of the kids</p>
<p>and the thing and all that.</p>
<p>All that is kept elsewhere.</p>
<p>So in order to get, I asked him</p>
<p>why he work in this office, right?</p>
<p>You work on light and channels of light,</p>
<p>things related to light of all things.</p>
<p>Here you are in this dark room.</p>
<p>And he said, well, this is what gets me</p>
<p>into the state of mind to be able to do what I want to do.</p>
<p>Very Rick Rubin ish, not at all the same person,</p>
<p>but very similar in that he&rsquo;s figured out</p>
<p>the physical space he needs in order to get</p>
<p>into the optimal state to do the work he needs to do</p>
<p>in this lifetime.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very unusual, right?</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t have a window, I kind of freak out.</p>
<p>I can do it here for a while.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in this black cube here, floating in space, of course.</p>
<p>But I find that amazing that these people</p>
<p>that are operating in this super high level</p>
<p>are willing to actually deprive themselves</p>
<p>of a lot of conditions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not sitting there with the secretary coming in</p>
<p>offering them espresso every five minutes and things that,</p>
<p>no, no, no, that&rsquo;s New York Neuroscience.</p>
<p>The New York Neuroscience Mafia is kind of famous</p>
<p>for having all the tickets to the opera and this and that.</p>
<p>And they enjoy lifestyle a lot.</p>
<p>The New York Neuroscience Mafia.</p>
<p>Oh, there is one, there definitely is one.</p>
<p>They know who they are.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know, Andrew Huberman is from the West Coast</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s just starting wars with the Neuroscience Mafia.</p>
<p>Well, they do amazing science.</p>
<p>They think, they love their lifestyle and that&rsquo;s wonderful,</p>
<p>but the culture is very different.</p>
<p>Carl and I think Silicon Valley in general</p>
<p>kind of prides itself on this kind of monk like assesism,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But at the individual scale,</p>
<p>be deliberate about controlling the environment.</p>
<p>I think about that with the conversations too.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been deliberate about that either</p>
<p>in terms of controlling the space you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Visually, yes, black curtains, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There is nothing like the Lex Friedman podcast studio.</p>
<p>First of all, when you do them remotely,</p>
<p>I always feel like I&rsquo;m in a witness relocation program.</p>
<p>You only get the coordinates at the last moment</p>
<p>and you always get the sense that there are people</p>
<p>behind the walls that are recording things.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s something about creating a feeling.</p>
<p>I have a sense that there&rsquo;s a robot over there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several throughout this place.</p>
<p>And I think part of that,</p>
<p>part of creating a feeling would be having the robots</p>
<p>constantly moving around and having a mind of their own</p>
<p>because that would most closely put guests</p>
<p>and other humans that I interact with into a place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s closest to my mind</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such an engineering mind</p>
<p>and one where when things come to life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beautiful place to be.</p>
<p>And whatever that is, that could be like art,</p>
<p>but to me, robots are art.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m thinking about that both for me and for guests.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also thinking about the difficult guests</p>
<p>just to return to, you said, Elizabeth Holmes.</p>
<p>One person, maybe a couple of things I want to say.</p>
<p>One person I think I would like to talk to is</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>I always get afraid right before you reveal</p>
<p>these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And now I know why I get afraid.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, again, assuming that she did the things</p>
<p>that people claim she did, they&rsquo;re despicable, right?</p>
<p>I mean, these were underage children, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no version of the story</p>
<p>where she did the things she was accused of doing</p>
<p>and is still a quote unquote good person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, in my mind, right?</p>
<p>And yet I think there is tremendous interest</p>
<p>in understanding like what led her to do all that.</p>
<p>So at least for some people.</p>
<p>Let me say a couple of things.</p>
<p>So one is at a high level, let me say that she believes</p>
<p>or her current story is that she&rsquo;s the victim.</p>
<p>Of who?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Oh my.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll just leave that there as is.</p>
<p>So these are ideas that you&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>The nature of truth and the nature of the human mind</p>
<p>is what it is and this is, imagine folks,</p>
<p>if you went into a room with a person that says that,</p>
<p>what do you do next?</p>
<p>Let me also say that I never or rarely,</p>
<p>let me say not say never, I rarely mention names</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m interested in talking to</p>
<p>without having made significant progress</p>
<p>in already securing that interview.</p>
<p>So people sometimes ask me about Vladimir Zelensky</p>
<p>and Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>I do not bring them up lightly in terms of their being</p>
<p>a path to an actual conversation.</p>
<p>That said, something I regret but I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>I know what to do with it.</p>
<p>But in the case of all the people I just mentioned,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been preparing for those conversations.</p>
<p>I only start really preparing seriously</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s confirmed because it&rsquo;s such a heavy burden.</p>
<p>And one of the things I regret in having mentioned</p>
<p>a conversation with Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>before the war in Ukraine broke out in the past few years</p>
<p>is that I would mention it very loosely, very casually.</p>
<p>And without having really deeply put myself into a place</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m ready to talk to him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a tricky thing because then the internet,</p>
<p>the audience in general, and just me,</p>
<p>when I listen back to my dumb self,</p>
<p>think, well, why are you speaking so lightly</p>
<p>about these topics?</p>
<p>Well, I know you&rsquo;ve had a longstanding interest</p>
<p>in talking to him.</p>
<p>I think now, well, I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how I would sit down and have a conversation</p>
<p>with somebody like that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not in the range of my skill sets.</p>
<p>Or like maybe not in the range of things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re drawn to somehow.</p>
<p>Not so much.</p>
<p>I mean, I would watch that episode with great interest.</p>
<p>Well, you did an episode recently with this guy</p>
<p>who was a former cyber criminal turned state side, right?</p>
<p>I think he works for the government now.</p>
<p>And there was a segment in there.</p>
<p>Remind me his name?</p>
<p>Brett Johnson.</p>
<p>There was a segment in there where he talked about</p>
<p>stealing a lifetime&rsquo;s worth of collected coins</p>
<p>from some elderly woman.</p>
<p>And this was everything she had.</p>
<p>And then he openly admitted that he felt no remorse,</p>
<p>which is the way he described is purely sociopathic.</p>
<p>And then of course we learned that he grew up in a family</p>
<p>where criminal behavior was very common.</p>
<p>It was kind of embedded into his notions</p>
<p>of what typical behaviors were.</p>
<p>And I found myself somewhat conflicted,</p>
<p>but also hung up on this idea that,</p>
<p>I mean, he had behaved as a sociopath</p>
<p>or in a sociopathic way.</p>
<p>And it created an internal conflict</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s quite charming guest</p>
<p>and his stories are terrific.</p>
<p>Especially I really enjoyed his discussions</p>
<p>about how he would go out and do all these things</p>
<p>out of a desire to please his girlfriend.</p>
<p>So he was in service to other people,</p>
<p>despite being sociopathic,</p>
<p>he could say he was in service to them as a way to extract.</p>
<p>Gets very complicated.</p>
<p>I think is the reason I went into science</p>
<p>is that at some level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about facts than it is opinions and judgments.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that I have the ability</p>
<p>to suspend judgment away from the kind of</p>
<p>top level contours of my initial reaction to like,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s true, like the Ghislaine Maxwell&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and the Liz Holmes and the other sociopaths</p>
<p>is one of just kind of revulsion and repulsion.</p>
<p>But that could also reflect the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not as neurologically sophisticated</p>
<p>as somebody that can spin all the plates of empathy,</p>
<p>forgiveness, but also holding people accountable</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>That takes, if you think about it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s three four brain circuits having to work in parallel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between chess or a game of go</p>
<p>and a game of checkers.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m playing checkers and you&rsquo;re playing chess.</p>
<p>No, so one is actually holding in your mind</p>
<p>and two is the raw skill of conversation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very, just having listened to your interviews,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re very good at conversation,</p>
<p>but the skill of conversation is really tricky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being self deprecating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being just objective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good at conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working very hard, getting better at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking not about just podcasting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking just normal life.</p>
<p>I have anxiety from social interaction.</p>
<p>I&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you really?</p>
<p>A huge amount, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So this is interesting because I never detect that in you.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>And I think there are people that we both know</p>
<p>that have said to me that they too feel anxious</p>
<p>and yet your voice is steady.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any perspiration.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>You appear incredibly calm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared shitless.</p>
<p>I was scared shitless with Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>Rick Rubin is, when you first meet him,</p>
<p>is intimidatingly calm.</p>
<p>But as you get to know him a bit,</p>
<p>you realize that the kindness</p>
<p>and the generosity that you sense is real.</p>
<p>But yeah, I would never in a million years</p>
<p>have guessed that you get anxious in conversation.</p>
<p>Can I just make another quick comment?</p>
<p>This may come off entertaining to you, Andrew.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve already gotten the same.</p>
<p>But having mentioned Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zelensky,</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, there is a natural question.</p>
<p>How does Lex have access to these people?</p>
<p>Who does he work for?</p>
<p>Like how does he&hellip;</p>
<p>Or who works for him.</p>
<p>Who works for him.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What does he have on others?</p>
<p>This, I&rsquo;m actually, I ask myself,</p>
<p>when I look in the mirror,</p>
<p>just somebody who kind of enjoys conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>I want to ask the same question.</p>
<p>Like, well, I usually ask in the following way,</p>
<p>like, how the fuck am I so lucky?</p>
<p>Like, who am I being, am I a robot</p>
<p>being controlled by somebody else?</p>
<p>Or like, how is this my life right now?</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>It really does feel like a simulation.</p>
<p>So let me just speak to several things.</p>
<p>First of all, I have no boss.</p>
<p>I know of nor am I controlled</p>
<p>by any intelligence agencies of any nation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get you a dog, Lex.</p>
<p>So that I could talk to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared of getting a dog</p>
<p>because I would fall in love so deeply, I think.</p>
<p>Next time I&rsquo;m bringing a puppy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to bring a puppy</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to leave it here.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll never see me again.</p>
<p>I mean, I love dogs so much.</p>
<p>But I was also surprised and maybe,</p>
<p>I have never talked to an intelligence agency,</p>
<p>which is very interesting to me.</p>
<p>Like, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re aware of.</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re very good at communicating.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been very suspicious on this exact point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the downside of kind of being an introvert,</p>
<p>having anxiety about social interaction,</p>
<p>but then having so much love thrown your way</p>
<p>because we connect over podcasts.</p>
<p>Podcasts have a powerful way of connecting people.</p>
<p>So people come with you with love that I really love.</p>
<p>I appreciate, but I wonder like exactly this question,</p>
<p>like why is this person with a Russian accent talking to me</p>
<p>and showing me so much love?</p>
<p>Well, because, sorry to interrupt you again,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sign of interest, by the way, too.</p>
<p>Sometimes. Sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a colleague at Stanford</p>
<p>and she said, you know, interruption 75% of the time</p>
<p>is a sign of real interest in what the person is saying,</p>
<p>if nothing else.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re very lovable.</p>
<p>Well, that, that, but,</p>
<p>I mean, I learned about a hedgehog in the fog from you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, when I learned, you know, you&rsquo;re very lovable.</p>
<p>People love you because you&rsquo;re lovable.</p>
<p>I love, love.</p>
<p>Okay. So 100%.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I mean, especially here in Austin, Texas,</p>
<p>people are so, so amazing.</p>
<p>I go just hugs and just, ah, I love people.</p>
<p>Do you want a family?</p>
<p>Or are you eventually?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re, I take what you said as a challenge</p>
<p>in terms of having a family with kids</p>
<p>and they do jiu jitsu and obviously defeat you</p>
<p>and make you miserable for your failures as a father</p>
<p>because you couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re gonna be a great dad.</p>
<p>Build up an army of good jiu jitsu people.</p>
<p>But yes, I would love a family.</p>
<p>I would love to have children.</p>
<p>But I just want to finish that point</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m nervous about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nervous about the way people perceive.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re seeing is a Forrest Gump type character.</p>
<p>Like what, who I am, I seem to be,</p>
<p>and this is how like the world seems to work,</p>
<p>is you just try, you try to be yourself.</p>
<p>Like you try to find yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s maybe the better way to say it.</p>
<p>And just be that.</p>
<p>Be kind to people.</p>
<p>Work your ass off.</p>
<p>And say F you to anybody that wants to control you</p>
<p>or to tell you what to do.</p>
<p>Just be free.</p>
<p>And then put love out there in the world.</p>
<p>And doors open.</p>
<p>This karma thing seems to work.</p>
<p>Like how the hell, my friends as you know,</p>
<p>how the hell did I get a chance to eat barbecue</p>
<p>with Rick Rubin, right?</p>
<p>Like doors.</p>
<p>You guys had a barbecue?</p>
<p>Yeah, I had barbecue.</p>
<p>He, right, of course I did.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s from New York.</p>
<p>Any New Yorker that I know has very high standards for food</p>
<p>because bad restaurants don&rsquo;t last long in New York.</p>
<p>And barbecue counts as?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, Texas barbecue.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I would also add that you,</p>
<p>whether or not you realize it or not,</p>
<p>you took tremendous risk.</p>
<p>I mean, we come from the same original community,</p>
<p>which is academic science, right?</p>
<p>And to be at MIT and to start posting lectures online</p>
<p>is risky, right?</p>
<p>To, you know, I was third or fourth man in</p>
<p>in terms of podcasting as an academic.</p>
<p>Cause you had gone on Rogan many times,</p>
<p>David Sinclair had gone on there.</p>
<p>You know, especially before the pandemic,</p>
<p>you just didn&rsquo;t see many academics and scientists</p>
<p>talking in a public facing way.</p>
<p>So you took tremendous risk, right?</p>
<p>You took tremendous risk</p>
<p>always wearing that jacket and tie, right?</p>
<p>The only time I haven&rsquo;t seen you in that truly</p>
<p>is when we rolled jujitsu, which is,</p>
<p>and I hear I&rsquo;m being generous to myself saying</p>
<p>I rolled jujitsu when basically you choked me out</p>
<p>in front of hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing that.</p>
<p>It was, it was great fun.</p>
<p>And I&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you for doing that.</p>
<p>To have a beginner&rsquo;s mind is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I have admittedly, I have not been taking the classes,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to, I truly am.</p>
<p>Especially there&rsquo;s a small chance I might find myself</p>
<p>in Austin a bit more often in the near future.</p>
<p>But the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re out in San Francisco,</p>
<p>you should train with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>He just started, so there you go.</p>
<p>Oh yeah?</p>
<p>You guys can&hellip;</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>I mean, people listen to an episode,</p>
<p>perhaps he&rsquo;s a fascinating human being too.</p>
<p>I listened to it, it was great.</p>
<p>You took tremendous risk as an academic to do what you did.</p>
<p>So I do believe that when one takes intelligent risk,</p>
<p>because you can die or can crash your career,</p>
<p>you can do all sorts of self destructive</p>
<p>or destructive things when taking risks.</p>
<p>You took risks and they paid off, right?</p>
<p>And you take different risks at different stages,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t throw around the word admiration lightly.</p>
<p>I mean, I admire that you were in this classroom at MIT.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m gonna film this and put it online.</p>
<p>One of your early interviews is with Ido Portal,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very hard to get to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve communicated with Ido a few times.</p>
<p>You should definitely talk to him.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to talk to him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dying to talk to him.</p>
<p>I was supposed to do some course teaching with him</p>
<p>right before the pandemic hit,</p>
<p>and then it got canceled because he couldn&rsquo;t travel,</p>
<p>but getting to him is exceedingly challenging.</p>
<p>So you do have this incredible ability to get to people</p>
<p>and for them to trust you and know you.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s through your authenticity.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the fact that you&rsquo;re willing to go places</p>
<p>where people haven&rsquo;t been before.</p>
<p>You know, this is, what&rsquo;s the saying about pioneers?</p>
<p>How do you spot the pioneers?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the people with the arrows in their backs.</p>
<p>You know, so that&rsquo;s the, you know, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually a quote that I lifted</p>
<p>from Terry Siknowski, who&rsquo;s a, you know.</p>
<p>You should talk to Terry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a computational neuroscientist</p>
<p>down at the Salk Institute,</p>
<p>Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera.</p>
<p>But so, you know, taking risks</p>
<p>that other people have not taken is, that&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>And to do it with integrity and rigor, that&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I&rsquo;m complimenting you</p>
<p>and I hope it lands and lands deeply.</p>
<p>But I also hope that people will hear that</p>
<p>and understand that it&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>to do what other people are already doing boldly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole other thing to launch an entire art form</p>
<p>or venue and you did that.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t write a book, hopefully you will someday,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t go write a book.</p>
<p>A lot of academics have written books.</p>
<p>You went online.</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson, another controversial character.</p>
<p>He did it too, all those lectures that he filmed.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s led to this other thing.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s karma.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also having the spine</p>
<p>to just put it all on the line</p>
<p>and do something for which there is no prior example</p>
<p>to hold onto while you go through those headwinds.</p>
<p>The really fascinating thing,</p>
<p>and actually a lot of people tell me about you,</p>
<p>Andrew Huberman, like the reach of a podcast</p>
<p>is really fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the numbers of people listen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s important at all.</p>
<p>Is what&rsquo;s important is like the depth of connection</p>
<p>you have with certain people.</p>
<p>It really moves them.</p>
<p>Like a great, and like they really get you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of big Andrew Huberman fans</p>
<p>that really get you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the stuff between the lines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Costello.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the whole picture of a scientist</p>
<p>that finds beauty in biology and reveals it.</p>
<p>And they love you for it.</p>
<p>You know, because it was on television at the time,</p>
<p>I followed that Amanda Knox story pretty carefully.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t watch television,</p>
<p>but whenever I would travel,</p>
<p>if there was a TV on the airplane,</p>
<p>I would find myself getting wrapped into things</p>
<p>like locked up abroad, you know, like,</p>
<p>and these things where they would make you terrified</p>
<p>to travel anywhere, let alone commit a crime overseas.</p>
<p>You know, the scenes of some of these prisons</p>
<p>are so dramatic.</p>
<p>And, you know, I mean, her case got a ton of interest.</p>
<p>And then I, you know, she went and then was a student</p>
<p>at the University of Washington</p>
<p>and has talked quite openly about, you know,</p>
<p>how she was treated and how people assume guilt</p>
<p>and, you know, and eventually, you know,</p>
<p>she was exonerated and, you know,</p>
<p>we can only go by what we know what the law determined,</p>
<p>but, you know, these are people that</p>
<p>the world is fascinated by.</p>
<p>I would, I&rsquo;m guessing about a third of people</p>
<p>have already decided this person is despicable.</p>
<p>Why would you ever give them an audience?</p>
<p>About a third of people I think are open to,</p>
<p>or at least interested in learning more about them.</p>
<p>And then I think the remaining third,</p>
<p>kind of the third that the category that I put myself in,</p>
<p>which is what can I learn about people and myself,</p>
<p>even in my revulsion, right?</p>
<p>What can I learn?</p>
<p>Yeah, what can I learn about myself</p>
<p>from listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with somebody that I like to think,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about Amanda here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the other people that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t relate to, right?</p>
<p>Hearing conversations with and about people</p>
<p>that you cannot relate to is informative.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your whole mind literally becomes insular.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s an interesting thing I also had to,</p>
<p>ever since the war in Ukraine broke out,</p>
<p>one of the questions I was asking myself,</p>
<p>and this is not to be dramatic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a very simple, honest question</p>
<p>that I think a lot of journalists</p>
<p>that operate in the war zone,</p>
<p>or documentary filmmakers</p>
<p>that ever since they got a chance to meet,</p>
<p>have to be honest with themselves,</p>
<p>are you willing to put at risk your life for things you do?</p>
<p>What are you willing to die for?</p>
<p>Yeah, what are you willing to die for?</p>
<p>It sounds very dramatic, but whenever risk goes up,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, you asked that</p>
<p>if you wanna take a trip out to space</p>
<p>on a commercial space flight,</p>
<p>you have to, are you willing to die for this journey?</p>
<p>Now, the odds, they&rsquo;re really small.</p>
<p>I just watched Apollo 13 again.</p>
<p>Great movie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to space.</p>
<p>Afraid of heights?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not afraid of heights.</p>
<p>I just, it feels like a terrible place to die.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, death anywhere is not great.</p>
<p>Yeah, although, I have a song teed up in my phone.</p>
<p>If the plane starts to go down,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna spend the last few.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rare song.</p>
<p>Nobody knows it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a song off a B track of my favorite band,</p>
<p>which is Rancid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a song called The Sentence.</p>
<p>And nobody, and I love it.</p>
<p>And I listen to it almost every day.</p>
<p>Rancid, The Sentence, it&rsquo;s called The Sentence?</p>
<p>The band is called Rancid, famous band, relatively.</p>
<p>Love those guys, love their music.</p>
<p>And the song is The Sentence.</p>
<p>You can only find it on like a B side or outtake.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, if you don&rsquo;t know how to decipher</p>
<p>Tim Armstrong&rsquo;s voice,</p>
<p>then you probably won&rsquo;t understand the lyrics.</p>
<p>But because it&rsquo;s sung very, very fast.</p>
<p>But if the plane ever goes,</p>
<p>anytime there&rsquo;s turbulence,</p>
<p>I put that thing in, I put the headphones in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, you know, if it&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go out like this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna drift off into the galaxy,</p>
<p>just slowly asphyxiating and freezing to death.</p>
<p>That sounds horrible.</p>
<p>Just like I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna drown or burn.</p>
<p>But on a plane is okay?</p>
<p>Well, on a plane, I mean, like,</p>
<p>if the thing starts going down</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s truly nothing you can do,</p>
<p>you might as well at least listen to your favorite song.</p>
<p>Yeah, true, true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably go with The Pixies,</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s My Mind, like from Fight Club.</p>
<p>And just the calmness, just sit back,</p>
<p>like the musicians playing at the Titanic.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you were a Pixies fan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to.</p>
<p>Not so much a Pixies fan.</p>
<p>Actually, I should say that I just,</p>
<p>that was the, Where&rsquo;s My Mind was the chosen song</p>
<p>for Fight Club at the end when the buildings</p>
<p>are coming down or something like that.</p>
<p>So that there&rsquo;s certain songs that just fit just right</p>
<p>for the collapse of human civilization</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re calmly appreciating, like,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s just it.</p>
<p>This is how absurd this life is at any moment it can end.</p>
<p>And this is it.</p>
<p>I love how we both have death and demise soundtracks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question when you&rsquo;re an academic,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come up often.</p>
<p>Right, well.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are some academics that are bold and brave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a phenotype.</p>
<p>Being bold and brave in the physical world</p>
<p>is not a common phenotype of academics.</p>
<p>I mean, the great neurologist, one of my,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have many heroes, but Oliver Sacks is a true hero.</p>
<p>I mean, people think of him as a writer,</p>
<p>but he was foremost a neurologist</p>
<p>and he took tremendous pushback from the neurology community</p>
<p>for doing his books and his articles.</p>
<p>He has a great biography called On the Move.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful documentary</p>
<p>that just came out about him.</p>
<p>He died in 2015.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually kind of a collector of his things,</p>
<p>but he, tremendous, but he was accused of horrible things</p>
<p>until the movie Awakenings came out</p>
<p>with De Niro and Robin Williams.</p>
<p>Amazing movie, by the way, people don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they seem to not say great things about the movie.</p>
<p>I love that movie.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>And it was only once he became famous from that movie</p>
<p>that his more academic work started</p>
<p>to receive any kind of attention</p>
<p>and he was invited back to Columbia and NYU.</p>
<p>You know, the New York Neuroscience Mafia is a real thing.</p>
<p>And yes, you know who you are.</p>
<p>And some of them are actually coming on the broadcast.</p>
<p>They are&hellip;</p>
<p>I think we talked offline about this.</p>
<p>We should start a mafia to fight off</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s going on in the East Coast.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m still at MIT, so I don&rsquo;t know how that works,</p>
<p>but Boston is different than New York.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I have tremendous respect</p>
<p>for science done in New York.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>They are excellent scientists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a very different culture than on the West Coast.</p>
<p>And the personalities, the personalities&hellip;</p>
<p>Tremendous respect for the mob.</p>
<p>Well, and the personalities are a bit more grandiose.</p>
<p>However, because of some of the shift</p>
<p>in science culture in the last few years,</p>
<p>things around scandals and things of that sort,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been forced to tamp down some of their personality</p>
<p>or at least their outspoken personality.</p>
<p>And I actually think it&rsquo;s revealed something</p>
<p>really important and useful in science,</p>
<p>which is it used to be the case</p>
<p>you could really inject your personality into what you do.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman is a good example.</p>
<p>If he did today what he did then,</p>
<p>bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech naked,</p>
<p>working out theorems in strip clubs and things of that,</p>
<p>he would have lost his job in moments.</p>
<p>So that kind of behavior isn&rsquo;t celebrated anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually punished.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m only half kidding</p>
<p>about this New York neuroscience mafia,</p>
<p>but because I now exist in multiple realms,</p>
<p>I can say these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And I, again, admiration and respect,</p>
<p>but I will say that I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>that people in science and kids that are curious</p>
<p>about science understand that you can have any personality</p>
<p>provided that you&rsquo;re ethical and respectful in science</p>
<p>and do well, right?</p>
<p>There are true bench scientists</p>
<p>that just want to be at the bench.</p>
<p>There are people that just want to be in their office.</p>
<p>There are people that really enjoy public speaking.</p>
<p>And there are people that love meetings</p>
<p>and there are people that hate crowds.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a place for everybody,</p>
<p>truly a place for everybody in science.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to shine light</p>
<p>on the fact that there are,</p>
<p>you can have a shy personality, an outgoing personality,</p>
<p>and you can, all of those can be,</p>
<p>have excellent careers in science,</p>
<p>but you have to find the community in place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>One reason I like Stanford</p>
<p>is that Stanford is very much about the future.</p>
<p>We have Nobel prize winners,</p>
<p>we have field medal winners and all that stuff,</p>
<p>and their names are on walls</p>
<p>and we acknowledge their great works.</p>
<p>But most of what you hear about in the halls of Stanford</p>
<p>is about what&rsquo;s happening now and what could happen next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about the future.</p>
<p>Whereas when I&rsquo;ve spent time at other institutions</p>
<p>not to be named, you hear that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of recycling and regurgitation</p>
<p>of how wonderful people are</p>
<p>based on things they did previously.</p>
<p>And the students at Stanford, because of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>sure, they have respect for Nobel prizes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re delighted to be learning from</p>
<p>and surrounded by all these great minds,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re mostly interested</p>
<p>in what they are gonna create.</p>
<p>And so I kind of, not kind of,</p>
<p>I really like the shift toward possibility</p>
<p>as opposed to things that are steeped in tradition.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve never been to high table dinner at Oxford,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a wonderful experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not sure what purpose it serves for the world,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never been,</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t know what the conversations are,</p>
<p>and so maybe I&rsquo;m, you know, speaking out of line here.</p>
<p>And then now I&rsquo;m definitely not getting invited.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re definitely getting invited.</p>
<p>But yeah, I&rsquo;m with you,</p>
<p>the culture&rsquo;s picked the right ones for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like MIT, the spirit of it.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s not about the past or the future,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about just tinkering and having fun,</p>
<p>building cool stuff.</p>
<p>Like the big ambitious projects, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I mean, it may be more in the biology and the health side,</p>
<p>but like the engineering side,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if this has any impact,</p>
<p>let us build the coolest thing the world has ever built.</p>
<p>Well, whenever I&rsquo;m in Kendall Square,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen, they have those buildings there</p>
<p>that actually tilt toward the ground.</p>
<p>These are these, the architecture of MIT</p>
<p>is also really impressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, this, he pulled up,</p>
<p>Sergei just pulled up Yilmaz tweet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inspired by curiosity.</p>
<p>That is what drives me.</p>
<p>So let us expand the scope and scale of consciousness</p>
<p>so that we may aspire to understand the universe.</p>
<p>Those are like three tweets in one,</p>
<p>but curiosity, yeah, yeah, curiosity for its own sake.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that saying?</p>
<p>I think Dorothy Parker said,</p>
<p>the cure for boredom is curiosity.</p>
<p>There is no cure for curiosity.</p>
<p>And you need to celebrate.</p>
<p>So let me just briefly mention</p>
<p>to my lovely friends at MIT</p>
<p>to celebrate different weirdness,</p>
<p>to celebrate the weird characters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, I sometimes get loving pressure</p>
<p>from my lovely friends at MIT</p>
<p>to tone down the weirdness a bit.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Even from MIT?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate to have a lot of leverage</p>
<p>to where I have completely resist the pressure,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very sure that there&rsquo;s young faculty</p>
<p>that with that subtle pressure would&hellip;</p>
<p>Dissolve them into a puddle of tears.</p>
<p>Not, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re from Boston, excuse me.</p>
<p>From Boston, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tougher than that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, but it&rsquo;s a slight nudging</p>
<p>towards conformity that I think ultimately destroys,</p>
<p>or at least lessens the power of the kind of science</p>
<p>that you can do when you encourage diversity.</p>
<p>Diversity in all of its forms,</p>
<p>including the weirdness of ideas,</p>
<p>the out of the box thinkers,</p>
<p>including the flamboyant behavior online,</p>
<p>how you choose to educate, how you choose to inspire.</p>
<p>People talk about freedom of speech,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just freedom of speech</p>
<p>to say controversial things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also freedom of speech to be weird.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, for some reason, fascinated in&hellip;</p>
<p>You look at Elon Musk.</p>
<p>He talks about sex a lot.</p>
<p>Let the guy put sex memes up.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like Elon can do basically whatever he wants.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s no pressure,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a bunch of Elons in the academic world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of Elons.</p>
<p>No, actually, sorry.</p>
<p>Let me backtrack, because the man deserves props.</p>
<p>Right, he&rsquo;s unparalleled.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a CEO of major companies.</p>
<p>You better believe there&rsquo;s pressure</p>
<p>to behave more like a CEO,</p>
<p>as opposed to a giggling schoolboy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s posting memes throughout the night.</p>
<p>But that is him.</p>
<p>And that freedom, that&rsquo;s what freedom looks like.</p>
<p>I talk to a lot of CEOs,</p>
<p>and a lot of them feel like caged birds</p>
<p>who have long ago forgotten how to sing, quite honestly.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s like shareholders,</p>
<p>and they come up with excuses for themselves.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why I have to be this way, you have to understand.</p>
<p>So on, there&rsquo;s PR, there&rsquo;s marketing people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lawyers, there&rsquo;s all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But the final result is the authenticity is suffocated.</p>
<p>The beautiful weirdness of a CEO,</p>
<p>of a leader, of a creator, of a scientist, all that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all gone.</p>
<p>Well, Steve Jobs wouldn&rsquo;t have kept his job</p>
<p>in acting the way he did in his 20s and 30s</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s climate.</p>
<p>But he probably would have updated his protocols,</p>
<p>so to speak. A little bit,</p>
<p>but maybe.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re screaming at employees.</p>
<p>I mean, these are anecdotes, right?</p>
<p>I call them anecdata,</p>
<p>because people treat them as data,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really just anecdotes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, I wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>But, you know, I like the idea of authenticity</p>
<p>without oversharing, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very authentic, but there are aspects to your life</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of that your audiences will never be aware of,</p>
<p>and there are aspects of your life</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll never be aware of.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re still authentic, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, wait, which ones are you aware of?</p>
<p>People are gonna wonder, like,</p>
<p>what is, is he up in sex dungeon?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>But interesting choice of examples.</p>
<p>No, but I think that, you know,</p>
<p>people lose the careers on the basis</p>
<p>of the movement of their thumbs, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the chair of psychiatry at Columbia</p>
<p>recently lost his position based on a response to a tweet.</p>
<p>People can look that up.</p>
<p>This is one of the most famous psychiatry departments</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And he put something out there</p>
<p>that was very insensitive, frankly.</p>
<p>And everyone that I talked to about it was like,</p>
<p>gosh, that was very, very insensitive,</p>
<p>not thoughtful at all.</p>
<p>And he lost his job, right?</p>
<p>Or at least had to step down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the specifics.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think I read someplace</p>
<p>that more than half of the job loss due to online behavior</p>
<p>is because people were trying to be funny, right?</p>
<p>I mean, not everyone can pull off what Tim Dillon.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, congratulations.</p>
<p>I heard that you and Tim just got married.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw that too.</p>
<p>No, no, we didn&rsquo;t just get married.</p>
<p>Engaged.</p>
<p>He proposed.</p>
<p>Yeah, got it, got it, got it.</p>
<p>And I said, yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So some people can get away.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sergey.</p>
<p>Has that ready to go.</p>
<p>See those 13.3 thousand likes?</p>
<p>One of those is mine.</p>
<p>So for people who are not aware,</p>
<p>one of the days in April tweeted that Tim Dillon</p>
<p>asked me to get married and I said, yes.</p>
<p>I think Tim said, the wedding will be on 6th Street</p>
<p>in Austin, bring all of your weapons,</p>
<p>which of course is totally inappropriate.</p>
<p>This is, I was like PG funny,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s goes rated R funny right away.</p>
<p>But that said, I mean, if there&rsquo;s anyone</p>
<p>I would like to get married with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that guy and we would do it in Austin</p>
<p>and it would be epic.</p>
<p>It would be like the wedding from November rain, one of the,</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. and Mr., I apologize.</p>
<p>Wow, yeah, and you broke tradition with the jacket color.</p>
<p>So it sounds to me that you are a free speech absolutist.</p>
<p>I think freedom is really important</p>
<p>and that includes letting people who are hateful,</p>
<p>letting people who are controversial</p>
<p>have a voice on platforms.</p>
<p>But it becomes, I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly to think</p>
<p>because I also treasure the quiet voices</p>
<p>in the back of the room.</p>
<p>And sometimes the assholes silence those voices,</p>
<p>meaning by being loud and obnoxious and so on,</p>
<p>it pushes away the thoughtful people.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m also a fan of creating communities.</p>
<p>Like you should be able to let people kind of</p>
<p>build a community that&rsquo;s positive, that&rsquo;s loving,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s constantly trolling, or that&rsquo;s super hateful.</p>
<p>All those communities should have a place in the world.</p>
<p>But like the thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that</p>
<p>hate can destroy, a community full of hate</p>
<p>can destroy a community full of love</p>
<p>easier than a community full of love</p>
<p>can overtake one with hate.</p>
<p>And so you have to kind of, I don&rsquo;t know exactly how,</p>
<p>but create digital mechanisms that discourage</p>
<p>the collision of these communities.</p>
<p>They should all have a platform and ability to speak</p>
<p>to a large audience, but you have to be careful</p>
<p>to protect that like little flame of connection</p>
<p>that people have.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s good, the goodness, it sounds like, I mean,</p>
<p>yeah, I think in any great city like New York,</p>
<p>which I love, by the way, you wanna have a symphony</p>
<p>in an opera house and you want some punk rock shows</p>
<p>happening on the Lower East Side, you want all of that.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t necessarily want them to overlap.</p>
<p>In terms of social media and then podcasts and engagement,</p>
<p>one thing that I decided very early on</p>
<p>is was to encourage comments and feedback, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I have in my mind what I call classroom rules.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taught in the university</p>
<p>and then you teach in the university</p>
<p>and you establish a certain etiquette within the classroom</p>
<p>of the kinds of questions that you&rsquo;ll tolerate, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always the student that&rsquo;s gonna ask a question,</p>
<p>which is basically a 10 minute monologue</p>
<p>about their experience that really isn&rsquo;t a question</p>
<p>that pertains to a lot of people.</p>
<p>So you politely discourage that kind of question</p>
<p>and you encourage the kinds of questions</p>
<p>that are likely to be in the minds of many other students.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more efficient that way.</p>
<p>Or not politely, which is more, you know,</p>
<p>I try and respond to comments and I try and respond,</p>
<p>but also, you know, there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>also this really interesting question.</p>
<p>Now, if you block people or restrict people,</p>
<p>people think that you&rsquo;re somehow afraid</p>
<p>of the information that they&rsquo;re posting,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s often not the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the habit of blocking</p>
<p>or restricting too many people.</p>
<p>Occasionally we&rsquo;ve had to do it</p>
<p>only because of how other people are being treated</p>
<p>in the comment section.</p>
<p>What I can take and what I think other people deserve to take</p>
<p>are two completely different things.</p>
<p>David Goggins, right, who we both know well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he still does this,</p>
<p>but a few years ago, he posted something like,</p>
<p>if people ask him, when do you sleep?</p>
<p>He would just block them.</p>
<p>Because it wasn&rsquo;t consistent with what he was trying to say.</p>
<p>Of course he sleeps, but it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to get a particular message out.</p>
<p>I think people should just understand</p>
<p>that everybody&rsquo;s page is their own to moderate, right?</p>
<p>Just like in a classroom, there are certain rules,</p>
<p>of course, of institution,</p>
<p>but then you establish the etiquette</p>
<p>within the context of the kind of class.</p>
<p>You know, a class about personality psychology</p>
<p>or the psychology of love,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a very different range of conversations</p>
<p>than, you know, a class on, you know,</p>
<p>memory and physiology.</p>
<p>So I think social media is a great place for conversation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily a great place</p>
<p>for every kind of conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I also just say that people that do get blocked,</p>
<p>I never, this is something I do very deliberately,</p>
<p>blocked or ignored.</p>
<p>I never think poorly of them.</p>
<p>I actually explicitly think,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s somebody that&rsquo;s like saying</p>
<p>hateful things about me or whatever,</p>
<p>I always think positive thoughts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some kind of weird guru thing,</p>
<p>but just actually found that as a hack.</p>
<p>I think well of them,</p>
<p>and that allows me to never think of them again.</p>
<p>Like I send them my love,</p>
<p>and like I think this is a like fascinating human being</p>
<p>with a fascinating story.</p>
<p>I would love to have time to actually learn</p>
<p>about their story, but there&rsquo;s not enough time in the world.</p>
<p>And I just think well of them and then I move on</p>
<p>and enjoy a delicious meal with people that are close to me</p>
<p>and I love and so on and just, and move on.</p>
<p>And then never adding to the negativity of like,</p>
<p>just even in the privacy of my own mind,</p>
<p>thinking a hateful thought towards them,</p>
<p>it serves no purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that about you.</p>
<p>And I know that what you just said to be true,</p>
<p>one of the, I think more toxic things in life</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called, you know, a vacuative projection.</p>
<p>When people feel something and they try and evacuate it</p>
<p>and project it onto somebody else.</p>
<p>Projection is fascinating, right?</p>
<p>What you essentially just said is that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t accept projections.</p>
<p>And in fact, you transmute them</p>
<p>to put it in the language of the Buddhist, you know,</p>
<p>you transmute it into positivity.</p>
<p>And in that way, you truly neutralize it and transmute it.</p>
<p>I think that if people were better understood</p>
<p>when they were experiencing</p>
<p>or observing a vacuative projection,</p>
<p>the world would be a much healthier and happier place.</p>
<p>But it requires a certain stable internal rudder.</p>
<p>And, you know, when we&rsquo;re tired or sick or angry,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re hungry, excessively hungry.</p>
<p>All of us are less good at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been positively struck by the nature</p>
<p>of most of the interactions, not just feedback,</p>
<p>but my favorite thing as an educator in the classroom,</p>
<p>but also on social media.</p>
<p>My absolute favorite thing is when the comments</p>
<p>about other people&rsquo;s comments are positively reinforcing.</p>
<p>So you see people having conversations within the comments</p>
<p>and you realize this is like, if you, as an educator,</p>
<p>again, you know, it&rsquo;s fun to teach</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fun to talk to the students,</p>
<p>but the real pleasure is in walking by a small group</p>
<p>of students on campus and hearing them talking</p>
<p>about the material, that just fills me with joy.</p>
<p>And because what it means is that the ideas are reverberating</p>
<p>in their nervous systems and will eventually wick out</p>
<p>to others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about feedback,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about a venue for parsing information.</p>
<p>So you actually posted that we&rsquo;re gonna talk on Instagram</p>
<p>and I collected a bunch of the questions,</p>
<p>which reminds me of, I have to mention Mike Jones</p>
<p>and a question he asked, but also a gift he gave</p>
<p>quite a while ago, if it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But first, a quick bathroom break.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at an Instagram page of Mike Jones,</p>
<p>Knife and Tool, you should check it out.</p>
<p>He, Andrew gave me a gift from him,</p>
<p>that is a badass butcher knife.</p>
<p>Yours is the earth, da, da, da,</p>
<p>is from If by Richard Kipling.</p>
<p>Yeah, the story of this knife is kind of interesting,</p>
<p>perhaps, to people where it was,</p>
<p>I was coming out here to Austin to meet with Lex</p>
<p>and it was his birthday.</p>
<p>I wanna get him a gift, but I didn&rsquo;t know what to get him.</p>
<p>And I contacted this guy, Mike Jones,</p>
<p>that I learned about through Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Cause the first, remember in the old days of Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>when you go on the episode afterwards,</p>
<p>you take a picture with an object.</p>
<p>So it was like Elon with a flamethrower</p>
<p>or people would have the ax.</p>
<p>I picked up this Bushwhacker hatchet thing.</p>
<p>And I was like, I love this thing.</p>
<p>And Joe said, oh yeah, you should check out</p>
<p>Mike Jones&rsquo;s work, he does these beautiful knives.</p>
<p>And so then I heard your episode with Joe</p>
<p>and you recited a poem at the end.</p>
<p>It was right after your grandmother died.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a line in that poem from If</p>
<p>that Mike engraved on that knife for you.</p>
<p>So he makes these by hand.</p>
<p>I love, the old days, before the podcast and all that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first appearance.</p>
<p>That was the first time on there.</p>
<p>And it was a lot of fun in the old studio in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And yeah, Mike makes these beautiful knives.</p>
<p>And I have this, I just have a great admiration</p>
<p>for crafts people.</p>
<p>So, do you use it?</p>
<p>Do you cut your one meal a day steaks with it?</p>
<p>I feel.</p>
<p>Are you taking it with you on your travels?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I actually used to keep it on the table,</p>
<p>but I thought it really intimidates guests.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>But like.</p>
<p>You can put it on their side.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trust, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, cause it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite bad ass if I may say.</p>
<p>So the craftsmanship is obvious, but also it is a knife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got some like Dexter like qualities to it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s designed to cleave through a limb.</p>
<p>If I had like a family or something where people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing about this place that softens your kind</p>
<p>of sense that this person might not murder me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it differently.</p>
<p>This place could use a woman&rsquo;s touch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to put it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s okay, let me,</p>
<p>because it is a poem I go to often actually.</p>
<p>You mentioned reciting some lyrics</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m actually gonna go back to that at some point</p>
<p>to get a few songs that touch you.</p>
<p>But this is one of the things I go to often.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read it to remind myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s advice from a father to son.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a kind of mantra that it&rsquo;s just nice to live by.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s okay with me,</p>
<p>just use this opportunity one more time.</p>
<p>Read If by Roger Kipling.</p>
<p>If you can keep your head when all about you</p>
<p>are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</p>
<p>if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you</p>
<p>but make allowance for their doubting too,</p>
<p>if you can wait to not be tired by waiting</p>
<p>or being lied about don&rsquo;t deal in lies</p>
<p>or being hated don&rsquo;t give way to hating</p>
<p>and yet don&rsquo;t look too good nor talk too wise.</p>
<p>If you can dream and not make dreams your master,</p>
<p>if you can think and not make thoughts your aim,</p>
<p>if you can meet with triumph and disaster</p>
<p>and treat those two imposters just the same,</p>
<p>if you can bear to hear the truth you&rsquo;ve spoken</p>
<p>twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools</p>
<p>or watch the things you gave your life to broken</p>
<p>and stoop and build them up with worn out tools,</p>
<p>if you can make one heap of all your winnings</p>
<p>and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss</p>
<p>and lose and start again at your beginnings</p>
<p>and never breathe a word about your loss,</p>
<p>if you can force your heart to nerve and sinew</p>
<p>to serve your turn long after they&rsquo;re gone</p>
<p>and so hold on when there&rsquo;s nothing in you</p>
<p>except the will which says to them, hold on.</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</p>
<p>I like this one, and walk with kings</p>
<p>nor lose the common touch, if neither foes</p>
<p>nor loving friends can hurt you,</p>
<p>if all men count with you but none too much,</p>
<p>if you can fill the unforgiving minute</p>
<p>with 60 seconds worth of distance run,</p>
<p>yours is the earth and everything that&rsquo;s in it</p>
<p>and which is more, you&rsquo;ll be a man, my son.</p>
<p>Thank you, Andrew, thank you, thank you, Mike,</p>
<p>for the knife, it&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important poem.</p>
<p>And engraved in it, yeah, it&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>Yours is the earth and everything that&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>We toiled over what to engrave,</p>
<p>and then finally I just said, Mike,</p>
<p>just pick something that speaks to you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the craftsman, and so he selected that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain ways to pull yourself in that book.</p>
<p>Actually, Karl Deisseroth, he wrote the book Projections.</p>
<p>One of my favorite, first of all,</p>
<p>just as you said, incredible writer.</p>
<p>Just, I mean, if you wrote fiction,</p>
<p>if you wrote those kinds of things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to see where he goes with his writing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I think that book took him 10 years to write,</p>
<p>which is vindication for me and for you</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re both supposed to write books</p>
<p>and we haven&rsquo;t done it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, in some sense,</p>
<p>your first book will have decades in it, right?</p>
<p>Even if you just take a half a year to write it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the first book, like the first album for a musician,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a journey.</p>
<p>But he uses poems and quotes in there really well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dreamy book.</p>
<p>I think when people hear that it&rsquo;s a book about neuroscience,</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re gonna get a textbook</p>
<p>or a protocols book or something, it&rsquo;s nothing like that.</p>
<p>But it really is a deep dive into the mind</p>
<p>of the psychiatrist and the researcher</p>
<p>and so much feeling and compassion.</p>
<p>I love that you love poetry.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t know that until I saw you</p>
<p>on Rogan Read If and I&rsquo;m not a very rabid consumer of poetry</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a big Wendell Berry fan.</p>
<p>And I try and read a poem once every few days.</p>
<p>Also, I think if is a tough act to follow.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the richness and the, I mean,</p>
<p>you said every third line in there is something</p>
<p>that you would consider your life well lived</p>
<p>if you said that, right?</p>
<p>What about the preparation for the solo podcast?</p>
<p>You said you listen to certain songs,</p>
<p>you sing or recite the lyrics to certain songs.</p>
<p>Is there ones that kind of come to mind</p>
<p>that are interesting?</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I&rsquo;ve always been very lyrics driven</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t understand music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to Rick about this.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve talked to you about this a little bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand, I mean,</p>
<p>I can hear music and like it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really understand the structure of it.</p>
<p>But lyrics make a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>But does it touch your soul, music, or is it the lyrics?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lyrics, it&rsquo;s not the instrumentals.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a huge Joe Strummer fan</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna lose punk points for saying this</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not a Clash fan.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So he obviously is best known for the Clash.</p>
<p>Most Clash songs start off great</p>
<p>and then after about 30 seconds, at least in my mind,</p>
<p>just kind of disintegrate into a bunch of mush.</p>
<p>Whereas Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros,</p>
<p>which is what he did as an adult,</p>
<p>as a later and some of his solo work,</p>
<p>he actually, Rick produced some work</p>
<p>that he did with Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>Rick pulled Johnny Cash out of,</p>
<p>essentially out of retirement</p>
<p>and had him do his albums before he died.</p>
<p>And so anything that Strummer did,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a favorite song of mine by Strummer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Burning Lights.</p>
<p>You can find it, there is an album now</p>
<p>where you can find it or Tennessee Rain</p>
<p>or some of these things that he did,</p>
<p>which are a little bit more folky, so not really punk.</p>
<p>So I love that song.</p>
<p>Bunch of songs by Rancid that I love.</p>
<p>Yeah, Rancid is great.</p>
<p>And then if I listen to instrumentals,</p>
<p>I do, I&rsquo;ll listen to classical piano.</p>
<p>Some dreams are made for children.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not gonna sound good as a poem.</p>
<p>They can play the, people can play the song.</p>
<p>Play the song, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ll, I mean, cause it has to be something,</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s voice is what makes the song.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s voice is what makes the song.</p>
<p>But yeah, that song Burning Lights</p>
<p>from I Hired a Contract Killer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the licks are pretty good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty good.</p>
<p>I mean, Joe is an amazing writer, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a big Bob Dylan fan.</p>
<p>Glenn Gould for classical piano.</p>
<p>He was at Asperger&rsquo;s, and actually I think</p>
<p>you can hear him grunting, he had a Tourette&rsquo;s like tick.</p>
<p>And I learned about Glenn Gould from Oliver Sacks.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll listen to any number of things.</p>
<p>It depends on my mood.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m feeling a little more tired</p>
<p>and I need to be amped up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll listen to something that&rsquo;s a little louder and faster.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m feeling kind of keyed up</p>
<p>and I need to bring the cadence down a little bit,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll listen to something a little mellower, poppier.</p>
<p>I love bands like, yeah, I&rsquo;m a big fan</p>
<p>of this British pop band called James.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like 20 bands named James.</p>
<p>But this one, you know, and again,</p>
<p>I lose punk points for saying that, but they&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>And best luck.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve accumulated enough points</p>
<p>where you can afford to lose a few.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But in any case, yeah, music and poetry are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the subconscious, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if you think about a Bob Dylan song</p>
<p>or a really good Strummer song or a poem</p>
<p>that the words don&rsquo;t mean anything when read linearly,</p>
<p>but they make you feel something,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re tapping into the subconscious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pulling on neural threads of emotion</p>
<p>based on either timbre or cadence</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s independent of the word structure.</p>
<p>And that to me is the beauty of music and poetry.</p>
<p>I often say Johnny Cash&rsquo;s version, Hurt,</p>
<p>that I say would be my favorite song ever.</p>
<p>Well, he did a Nine Inch Nails song.</p>
<p>He did, he covered.</p>
<p>I think Rick produced that.</p>
<p>Pretty sure he produced that.</p>
<p>He produced it.</p>
<p>I mean, he did, like Rick produced the,</p>
<p>he pulled Johnny Cash out from a dark place</p>
<p>to produce something that, I mean,</p>
<p>when you look back as one of the great things ever in music,</p>
<p>which are these like haunting covers</p>
<p>of certain songs and originals.</p>
<p>Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer did a version</p>
<p>of Redemption song together that Rick produced,</p>
<p>which is on loop in my house sometimes,</p>
<p>for hours and hours.</p>
<p>That song is fascinating.</p>
<p>Bob Marley&rsquo;s song.</p>
<p>Song by Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I think what it would be</p>
<p>to be a fly on the wall when these guys were doing this.</p>
<p>These songs of freedom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain songs where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it elicits an emotion that&rsquo;s unlike anything else.</p>
<p>I mean, I was trying to figure that out with Rick, too.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s certain songs that make you wanna pull out</p>
<p>over to the side of the road and just weep</p>
<p>or just get inspired to just get shit done</p>
<p>or all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Remember your family, the people you&rsquo;ve lost,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>When you hurt, I hurt myself today</p>
<p>to see if I still feel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain songs that I&rsquo;ve loved so much</p>
<p>that I actually won&rsquo;t play them during a relationship</p>
<p>until the relationship passes a certain duration</p>
<p>because if you start sharing in those experiences</p>
<p>with somebody and it starts to become associated</p>
<p>with the relationship, you braiding it in</p>
<p>with the dopamine of love and that relationship ends,</p>
<p>the song is forever tainted.</p>
<p>There are certain songs that I will never play</p>
<p>in the company of anybody else.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mine.</p>
<p>I just, it&rsquo;s too risky to give those up.</p>
<p>And you know, and I think that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like levels.</p>
<p>There are levels, right, exactly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the interesting thing about this kind</p>
<p>of preparing for the solo episode,</p>
<p>just interacting with Rick about that process</p>
<p>of preparation and because you mentioned with interviews.</p>
<p>By the way, are you do solo, solo?</p>
<p>Are you the only one in the room or?</p>
<p>No, well, it used to be Rob, my producer,</p>
<p>who I should say, you know, he&rsquo;s really the person</p>
<p>behind the podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, we&rsquo;re equal partners.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a pretty face.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, and I&rsquo;m aging, man.</p>
<p>Not to say I love him.</p>
<p>I actually really, I like aging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like friends with David Sinclair</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all about not aging.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna live past 90, 95.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to get as much done as I can</p>
<p>in this short life and do it right</p>
<p>and with integrity and heart and accuracy, you know.</p>
<p>And you like the stages.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, if you read Erickson&rsquo;s stages of development,</p>
<p>you realize that every stage of life</p>
<p>is a set of neural circuits trying to resolve a problem.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re gonna try and avoid that progression</p>
<p>sure, you might live longer, but you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like saying like,</p>
<p>do you wanna go win the high school jujitsu championship?</p>
<p>No, you graduated high school a long time ago, right?</p>
<p>So I actually look forward to the future,</p>
<p>even if it means that I&rsquo;m starting to shift.</p>
<p>I think that my biology will shift.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I&rsquo;ll fight that.</p>
<p>I try and take good care of myself,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t wanna get sick.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna suffer, who does?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m embracing this whole developmental arc.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not children and then adults.</p>
<p>Our entire life is one long developmental arc.</p>
<p>And if you fail to embrace that,</p>
<p>you fail to extract the richness</p>
<p>of what it is to be a human being.</p>
<p>So in any event, I record Rob is in the room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sometimes stop and ask him for feedback</p>
<p>if I feel like something&rsquo;s not landing right.</p>
<p>So he gives, if it&rsquo;s clear, he&rsquo;ll let me know.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not clear, he&rsquo;ll let me know.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>And then, you know, Costello used to be in the room.</p>
<p>The early days of the podcast, which weren&rsquo;t that long ago,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s snoring at my feet and farting</p>
<p>and smelling up the room.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all just kind of like gasping for air.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bulldog.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>With him gone, it changed.</p>
<p>You know, the whole thing changed.</p>
<p>There will be another dog soon.</p>
<p>And as you know, I&rsquo;ve been moving</p>
<p>through that grief process,</p>
<p>but having him there gave me a levity that I miss.</p>
<p>But in my mind, he&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>So, and you know, in time there&rsquo;ll be another dog</p>
<p>and who knows, you know, maybe there&rsquo;ll be a dog</p>
<p>and a couple of infants running around,</p>
<p>but that would be more distracting.</p>
<p>So, but it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no podcast that exists</p>
<p>just because of the podcaster.</p>
<p>This is true for Joe, this is true for your podcast,</p>
<p>for me, that there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not just a staff</p>
<p>of people to post stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the top level contour.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the constant feedback and iteration</p>
<p>of what you want it to become</p>
<p>and trying to hold on to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s essential along the way.</p>
<p>Cause everything has to evolve,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t lose the essence of something.</p>
<p>Anytime a company or brand or a course</p>
<p>or a scientist has done that, it just ends up terrible.</p>
<p>It just is a, you know, it becomes</p>
<p>like a Senator version of itself.</p>
<p>So to Rick is very, the power of the people in the room</p>
<p>is great to inspire and to destroy.</p>
<p>So you have to be extremely careful</p>
<p>with the selection of people that are in the room.</p>
<p>To me, I never really thought of it that way.</p>
<p>I thought only positive things can happen.</p>
<p>Oh, by adding people in the room?</p>
<p>By adding people in the room.</p>
<p>Oh, I think if there were an audience in the room for,</p>
<p>well, you know what, someday I&rsquo;d love</p>
<p>to do a live podcast with you.</p>
<p>I saw you doing like a couple of live things,</p>
<p>which is great that you&rsquo;re paving the way there to try.</p>
<p>Well, we did one, I went up to University</p>
<p>of British Columbia and did a lecture on a college campus.</p>
<p>And one of the more gratifying things that happened</p>
<p>is this kid, he&rsquo;s in his early twenties, I think,</p>
<p>stood up and said, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been on a college campus.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I could go onto a college campus.</p>
<p>And that still rings in my mind.</p>
<p>Whoever you are out there, that meant so much to me.</p>
<p>Cause I was like, yes, there was something about that to me.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, this, it made sense to come all the way</p>
<p>up here and do this in person.</p>
<p>Cause you can get out to a lot more people online.</p>
<p>Public speaking events,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s that lucrative or anything.</p>
<p>I mean, unless you&rsquo;re whatever,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a famous celebrity or politician or something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are people that do well with it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s about for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about being able to connect with people</p>
<p>in a different venue and for interactions like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many of them we will do,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m curious to see how it goes,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to do a podcast with you.</p>
<p>Is it energizing? My fear is the fear of the introvert</p>
<p>is that I don&rsquo;t know if I can handle so much love</p>
<p>and fascinating people all around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll invite a few haters too.</p>
<p>Well, yes, but I love the haters too, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It makes me nervous.</p>
<p>Cause Jordan Peterson is currently on tour.</p>
<p>I got a chance to hang out with him.</p>
<p>Oh right, he does a lot of live speaking.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s now on tour where he does like every other day.</p>
<p>But he doesn&rsquo;t have any small kids at home anymore.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So yeah, you should do it before you have a fan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also exhausting.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just speaking from an athlete perspective,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re Mick Jagger with the Rolling Stones,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just physically, I mean, you have to speak potentially</p>
<p>for two hours, then off stage, like hanging out with people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of hours to stay focused,</p>
<p>to keep finding your place of like calmness and excitement.</p>
<p>Well, and you&rsquo;re staying in hotels,</p>
<p>your circadian rhythm is disrupted.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting your like cold and sauna</p>
<p>and your workout every day.</p>
<p>Your food isn&rsquo;t optimal.</p>
<p>I think done in patches, I could enjoy it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fun to meet people from different places.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a public lecture in Copenhagen</p>
<p>for the Lundbeck Foundation in June, June 3rd.</p>
<p>And that one is particularly gratifying for me</p>
<p>because the Lundbeck Foundation is an academic foundation.</p>
<p>So the fact that, and then so when they invited,</p>
<p>I asked, do you want me to talk about what my lab does</p>
<p>or do you want me to talk about the stuff on the podcast?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, no, no, not your lab.</p>
<p>We want to hear about this, like health stuff</p>
<p>and the stuff that we cover on the podcast.</p>
<p>So that was amusing to me and tells me that things</p>
<p>are changing now.</p>
<p>I think 2020 and 2021 revealed a lot of things</p>
<p>about people to ourselves.</p>
<p>But one thing that it made very clear</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s an enormous appetite for tools</p>
<p>for mental and physical health,</p>
<p>but also understanding about science</p>
<p>and how science is done.</p>
<p>So thanks to you, again, I&rsquo;m not saying this to flatter you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true gratitude.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now a runway for scientists to talk to people.</p>
<p>I mean, you had the, I always forget this guy&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>the virus guy from Columbia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wrecking yellow.</p>
<p>Yeah, amazing, right?</p>
<p>I mean, forgetting the controversy around all the stuff</p>
<p>of 2020, 21.</p>
<p>I mean, he is an encyclopedia of all things virology.</p>
<p>Yeah, people should listen to his podcast</p>
<p>this week in virology.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also an incredible lecturer and educator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating when people take again that leap</p>
<p>of putting all that education online.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s non controversial at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everybody there, people should go listen to him</p>
<p>for the most part in terms of, at his best, at least.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no politics in it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none of that.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s a virus jockey.</p>
<p>He likes playing around with bacteria and viruses and.</p>
<p>But that said, molecular biology.</p>
<p>We all say stuff carelessly all the time.</p>
<p>So he gets in a bit of trouble on some of the things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve said about like dismissing lab leak theory.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>He dismisses that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not, he&rsquo;s not making,</p>
<p>like folks, there&rsquo;s a difference when you say stuff</p>
<p>like off the cuff and when you say stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like courts your principles</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve thought about it for a very long time.</p>
<p>You talking for hours, for hundreds of hours</p>
<p>and you can just say stuff.</p>
<p>You could just say your opinions.</p>
<p>Will Smith slapped.</p>
<p>I was wondering, okay, wait,</p>
<p>how long have we been recording?</p>
<p>I was wondering how long it was gonna take us</p>
<p>before someone talked about Ukraine.</p>
<p>No, no, Will Smith.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether or not we&rsquo;d make it the end.</p>
<p>I had it planned.</p>
<p>I was literally in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>I had it planned that at the end,</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t talk about the Will Smith, Chris Rock thing,</p>
<p>that I was gonna say, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>This is the first conversation to happen</p>
<p>in a long time where it wasn&rsquo;t mentioned.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>No, do not pull it up.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to see it.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>It revealed some interesting things</p>
<p>about human beings, impulse control and lack thereof.</p>
<p>But, you know, oh my goodness.</p>
<p>Chris Rock has a material for the rest of his career.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he&rsquo;s not short on material.</p>
<p>But I do, see, if I knew what I wanted to tweet,</p>
<p>if I knew you a lot to just slap comedians,</p>
<p>my conversation with Tim Dillon</p>
<p>would have gone very differently.</p>
<p>People just being humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much fascinating human nature on display there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, in terms of it becoming a topic</p>
<p>that a lot of people are talking about</p>
<p>versus the war in Ukraine, for example,</p>
<p>is also fascinating to watch,</p>
<p>like just these kind of news cycles moving through.</p>
<p>I think, if I may, I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but, you know, anytime we observe something very limbic,</p>
<p>very emotional, you know,</p>
<p>we generally can empathize somewhat, right?</p>
<p>We all know what it&rsquo;s like to feel angry.</p>
<p>We all know what it&rsquo;s like to feel ashamed.</p>
<p>We all know what it&rsquo;s like to feel shocked.</p>
<p>Images of war are, for most people, very hard to relate to.</p>
<p>We see it, it&rsquo;s, you know, there are these images</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very traumatic and challenging</p>
<p>to look at at times,</p>
<p>and yet most people have no idea</p>
<p>what it feels like to be shot at</p>
<p>or what it feels like to have your home destroyed</p>
<p>or what it feels like to be an aggressor in that way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, so I think that people naturally orient</p>
<p>towards things that feel familiar to them,</p>
<p>even though the circumstances are different.</p>
<p>And people also forget, they look at these celebrities,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like looking at criticism of Will Smith,</p>
<p>you forget that they&rsquo;re human too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the most surprising things for me,</p>
<p>having done this podcast and met celebrities</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re human, they&rsquo;re all human.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s inspiring to me,</p>
<p>like some of these great folks that have won Nobel Prizes</p>
<p>and built some cool things,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just human, like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Well, and if you look at actors and actresses,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some amazing ones, right?</p>
<p>And who also do well in the outside life,</p>
<p>but their careers were built on the business</p>
<p>of pretending to be other people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s got to distort maybe positively,</p>
<p>but also just let&rsquo;s be honest,</p>
<p>what it is that the neuroplasticity there,</p>
<p>the changes in the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that represent personality have to be quite different</p>
<p>for somebody who pretends to be</p>
<p>lots of different personalities and gets paid for it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working the reward system</p>
<p>into the system of self identity.</p>
<p>And you have to imagine that that can really</p>
<p>contort somebody&rsquo;s neurology</p>
<p>in ways that maybe they are not as,</p>
<p>maybe they are not in touch with reality</p>
<p>in the same way that we are.</p>
<p>Remember earlier we were talking about</p>
<p>neurotic versus psychotic.</p>
<p>They may be more borderline</p>
<p>in their kind of ground state than we think.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m actually impressed anytime there&rsquo;s a celebrity</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have a messed up life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh wow, finally somebody who&rsquo;s managed</p>
<p>to maintain some semblance,</p>
<p>at least from the outside, of normalcy.</p>
<p>So first of all, I can empathize</p>
<p>with the actions that Will Smith did, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, I think they&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>not kind of, they&rsquo;re just shitty.</p>
<p>You should probably talk privately, man to man,</p>
<p>not, because otherwise it&rsquo;s like a dramatic display.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you are a fake, you&rsquo;re acting.</p>
<p>Well, there are all these questions, right?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously it was aggressive at some level.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this question of whether or not it was impulsive.</p>
<p>I think most people feel yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question, there was the protective nature of it</p>
<p>because he was doing it to, you know,</p>
<p>apparently in defense.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also the context,</p>
<p>he lost touch with the context, right?</p>
<p>Whereas Chris Rock basically gets,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the possible critique that he went too far.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>But then, and depending on how you view comedy and jokes,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also the fact that he took that slap</p>
<p>and then just snapped right back,</p>
<p>so much so that people thought maybe it was fake.</p>
<p>He also waited with his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just natural, he likes to stand like that.</p>
<p>I mean, I got to a little bit of a story here</p>
<p>to connect to what Chris Rock did.</p>
<p>Like I wish, what Chris Rock did in terms of just</p>
<p>taking the slap and keep going,</p>
<p>first of all, just props for somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to maintain cool in that situation</p>
<p>for the most part.</p>
<p>I think I like watched it once.</p>
<p>You only have to be alive on this planet</p>
<p>to see it, you can&rsquo;t avoid seeing it.</p>
<p>I wish at that afterwards, he would sort of say something</p>
<p>loving and kind to Will Smith and his wife</p>
<p>and then hit him real hard, lean into the joke.</p>
<p>But I think in hockey, they call it taking a number.</p>
<p>I have a friend who plays hockey and there&rsquo;s this idea</p>
<p>that if someone checks you really badly in one game,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go and check them again,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get into a fight.</p>
<p>But three games later, you blade them in the shin.</p>
<p>The ability to defer and to handle it</p>
<p>in whatever fashion one feels is appropriate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably also friends and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>that they respect each other, so he probably didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a comedian instinct.</p>
<p>I saw this, I was at an open mic here in Texas.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say where, there&rsquo;s many open mics.</p>
<p>Have you gone to a few of these?</p>
<p>These are pretty good.</p>
<p>No, so there is more sort of rougher kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve been hanging out in West Texas lately.</p>
<p>Austin&rsquo;s too tame for Lex, so he&rsquo;s headed to West Texas.</p>
<p>Exactly, I put on a cowboy hat</p>
<p>and instantly I became a cowboy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking like a cowboy.</p>
<p>I mean, I belong out there in the desert.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gone from eating meat and athletic greens</p>
<p>to rattlesnakes, rattlesnake jerky.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No, there was a, open mic is late at night</p>
<p>and I was one of the only people in the audience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of drunk folks, a few drunk folks.</p>
<p>One of them was a couple, like bikers with helmets and so on,</p>
<p>a guy and a girl.</p>
<p>And then the comedian, the open mic comedian,</p>
<p>did a joke about people who wear helmets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was on purpose or not,</p>
<p>but he did the joke.</p>
<p>And then the guy about women who wear helmets.</p>
<p>And the guy, it&rsquo;s this exact same situation.</p>
<p>The guy stood up, walked up to him.</p>
<p>There was no slap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting,</p>
<p>because this happened before the Will Smith thing.</p>
<p>So he walked up to the comedian</p>
<p>and said, I think he pointed his finger down</p>
<p>and told him to stop or something like that.</p>
<p>And then sat down.</p>
<p>This is an audience of like six people.</p>
<p>And at midnight around then, there&rsquo;s nobody,</p>
<p>no security, nothing.</p>
<p>In Texas.</p>
<p>Which implies.</p>
<p>And then this guy was the energy drunk,</p>
<p>but also a biker and what he felt his lady</p>
<p>was now attacked by the comedian, right?</p>
<p>With his words.</p>
<p>And the comedian was a kind of out of shape, small guy.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not threatening at all and probably in trouble.</p>
<p>And the comedian, after he sat down,</p>
<p>he looked a little bit scared.</p>
<p>He paced back and forth.</p>
<p>And then he did the joke again.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And I was sitting and I started,</p>
<p>I leaned back and I just did this like,</p>
<p>because that is comedy.</p>
<p>And the guy was getting angrier and angrier.</p>
<p>And he just sat there.</p>
<p>And the comedian went on for a couple more minutes</p>
<p>and then did another bad joke,</p>
<p>but another joke about him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, he leaned into it.</p>
<p>If you go to a small comedy club, open mic or otherwise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the shooting gallery.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re basically there teed up as a pin to get it.</p>
<p>We went and saw Andrew Scholls in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In San Francisco?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was hilarious.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s just masterful in his ability</p>
<p>to command an audience.</p>
<p>But I felt for the people up front,</p>
<p>but no sympathy either because you buy tickets</p>
<p>to sit up front at a Scholls show, you&rsquo;re gonna get it.</p>
<p>But he was very loving.</p>
<p>Yeah, and funny.</p>
<p>First of all, funny.</p>
<p>The funniness really helps you.</p>
<p>But the ethic of the comedian is like that fearlessness.</p>
<p>What I really liked is like the danger,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s risk to comedy and there&rsquo;s also consequences.</p>
<p>Have you watched that show?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The Marvelous Miss Maisel show?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>I watched a few of them.</p>
<p>Guilty pleasure there.</p>
<p>She plays a comic in the, I think it&rsquo;s mid 1960s in New York.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a character that somewhat resembles Lenny Bruce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of meant to be Lenny Bruce.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re always getting arrested and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think I learned about it from Joe.</p>
<p>Anyway, the writing is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>But yeah, comedy is designed to push boundaries, right?</p>
<p>And to say the thing that other people aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>feel they can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>Not something in science, right?</p>
<p>Science you&rsquo;re supposed to,</p>
<p>etiquette is a big part of how you communicate ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about constraining communication.</p>
<p>This is something, I mean, I confess on the podcast,</p>
<p>in the goals of making it clear, interesting,</p>
<p>surprising and actionable,</p>
<p>you have to constrain the amount</p>
<p>and the style of information.</p>
<p>Otherwise it becomes something else altogether, right?</p>
<p>I saw Sandra Perchay, Google CEO,</p>
<p>said that he likes the thing you mentioned,</p>
<p>not the yoga nidra, but the NSDR,</p>
<p>non sleep deep rest podcast over meditation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw that, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>What do you think that is?</p>
<p>What do you think the difference is?</p>
<p>Yeah, so non sleep deep rest, NSDR is an acronym</p>
<p>that I coined because it encompasses a lot of practices</p>
<p>that are not meditation per se,</p>
<p>but that bring the brain and body</p>
<p>into a state of relaxation and focus.</p>
<p>So hypnosis is one variant of NSDR.</p>
<p>There are other variants of NSDR.</p>
<p>You can just look these up and you&rsquo;ll find them.</p>
<p>And I think that they&rsquo;ve caught on</p>
<p>and that the CEO of Google is an avid practitioner of NSDR</p>
<p>because it has this amazing ability</p>
<p>to reset your energy levels and focus.</p>
<p>Whereas with meditation, many people find meditation hard.</p>
<p>And part of the reason they find it hard</p>
<p>is that it requires focus.</p>
<p>NSDR is a state which is very calm and relaxing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to work too hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just listening to a script,</p>
<p>whereas most forms of meditation, not all,</p>
<p>but most forms of meditation involve cranking up</p>
<p>the activity in your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and trying to see your thoughts</p>
<p>as opposed to thinking your thoughts</p>
<p>or focus on your breath,</p>
<p>but then third personing yourself in some respect</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>And so many people who meditate quite intensely</p>
<p>feel more exhausted.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that meditation</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have any utility,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s distinctly different than NSDR.</p>
<p>And I think that people are working,</p>
<p>certainly the CEO of Google I have to imagine</p>
<p>is working very hard and using his forebrain.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s going to have 20 or 30 minutes to take a break,</p>
<p>he should, and I think this is what he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>he should go out for a jog and not listen to anything</p>
<p>and just kind of let his mind wander</p>
<p>or sit there in a chair and just zone out or do NSDR.</p>
<p>The problem is people are not that good at shifting states.</p>
<p>We are all actually pretty good at,</p>
<p>even people with severe ADHD,</p>
<p>we had an episode about this,</p>
<p>can become hyper focused on things that they actually enjoy</p>
<p>because dope and most of the drugs designed to treat ADHD</p>
<p>are drugs that increase the levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>So when you like something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s dopamine release and you can focus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you don&rsquo;t like something that&rsquo;s hard to focus,</p>
<p>shifting states is hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve experienced this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been in deep research or podcasting,</p>
<p>podcasting, and then all of a sudden you go for a run,</p>
<p>you probably spend the first third of that run thinking.</p>
<p>And then in the middle third,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of that thinking is fractured a bit.</p>
<p>And then in the final third</p>
<p>is where you finally get to relax</p>
<p>because the brain doesn&rsquo;t shift states very quickly.</p>
<p>We can go from sleep to wakefulness quickly.</p>
<p>We can go from wakefulness to sleep quickly,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t shift between different states of consciousness</p>
<p>like a step function, except in rare cases, right?</p>
<p>Fear is one.</p>
<p>All of a sudden we hear an explosion right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a step function.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in fear or we&rsquo;re in alertness, right?</p>
<p>A heightened state of alertness.</p>
<p>But NSDR is terrific at allowing people</p>
<p>to learn to shift their state.</p>
<p>And I actually would venture to argue that</p>
<p>part of the value of meditation and exercise</p>
<p>is the actual state that you get into</p>
<p>in deep meditation or exercise,</p>
<p>but just as valuable is the transition</p>
<p>that you have to take yourself through</p>
<p>from one state of mind to the other and then back again.</p>
<p>When I look, David Goggins, he always seems to come up</p>
<p>because he represents so many important things,</p>
<p>drive, determination, override of emotional state,</p>
<p>going from being a 300 pound plus person</p>
<p>to a fit person through,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never revealed anything substantial</p>
<p>about what he ate or what he didn&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>He basically says like, listen, run a lot, eat less, right?</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s remarkable is so much of what he says</p>
<p>is about those transitions,</p>
<p>about taking oneself from a state of I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>to scruffing oneself and like you&rsquo;re gonna do it anyway.</p>
<p>And then being able to carry that into regular life,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>So I think that NSDR is immensely powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s zero cost.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons I&rsquo;m such a fan of people doing it</p>
<p>is that most people don&rsquo;t stick to a meditation practice.</p>
<p>There are also been a few cases</p>
<p>you might find this interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book by Scott Carney.</p>
<p>I forget what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called the transcendence trap or something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have that title wrong,</p>
<p>but there have been a fair number of cases of people</p>
<p>that go and do very extensive meditation,</p>
<p>silent meditation retreats,</p>
<p>who then return to normal life and end up killing themselves.</p>
<p>There are states of mind inside of extended meditations</p>
<p>or silent meditations that are very beneficial.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly not suggesting people don&rsquo;t meditate,</p>
<p>but I know at least one person who came back</p>
<p>from one of these long extended meditation retreats</p>
<p>and wasn&rsquo;t able to shift their state back</p>
<p>into one that was functional in regular life.</p>
<p>And that book includes a very dramatic story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna give it away in case people</p>
<p>check out the book,</p>
<p>but Scott told the story to me directly once,</p>
<p>where someone feels they&rsquo;ve reached enlightenment</p>
<p>and then commit suicide.</p>
<p>So these very unusual brain states</p>
<p>are potentially hazardous if people can&rsquo;t return from them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice to focus not on those brain states,</p>
<p>but instead on the shifting.</p>
<p>Right, this morning I woke up a little bit earlier</p>
<p>than I would have liked.</p>
<p>I use this reverie app that&rsquo;s research backed,</p>
<p>REVRI.com.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a free version of it or you can try it for free.</p>
<p>So I feel comfortable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for hypnosis?</p>
<p>For hypnosis.</p>
<p>And I do a self hypnosis to put me back into sleep.</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t sleep,</p>
<p>you just put me into a state of deep relaxation.</p>
<p>I would put hypnosis under the category of NSDR,</p>
<p>yoga nidra under the category of NSDR.</p>
<p>There are now some NSDR scripts online</p>
<p>if you just go to YouTube that you can just listen to.</p>
<p>Do you like those?</p>
<p>I do, yeah.</p>
<p>I think the one from made for is quite good.</p>
<p>I have an affiliation with them, but it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>So I feel comfortable mentioning it.</p>
<p>I do, I really like the reverie app.</p>
<p>I can vary.</p>
<p>And as you, the more you do them,</p>
<p>the more quickly you can shift your brain</p>
<p>into a state of deep relaxation.</p>
<p>I will sometimes stop mid podcast.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s, sometimes our recordings go seven, eight hours</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll stop and I&rsquo;ll do a one minute hypnosis.</p>
<p>They have one minute hypnosis inside reverie.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only going to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only going to find that one minute hypnosis</p>
<p>is effective if you are routinely doing 10</p>
<p>and 15 minute hypnosis in addition to that.</p>
<p>Meaning I do it every other day or so at 10 or 15.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, is there a YouTube one minute hypnosis</p>
<p>or is this for the reverie?</p>
<p>There are, but inside of reverie as well.</p>
<p>You can find them online.</p>
<p>A really good.</p>
<p>Pull it up so I can see.</p>
<p>Yeah, so reverie is good.</p>
<p>And then Michael Sealy, S E A L E Y.</p>
<p>He has some long hypnosis scripts, but again,</p>
<p>these are all free and you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of good research now on the neural networks</p>
<p>and it shifts your so called default network,</p>
<p>the default mode network.</p>
<p>It shifts how much of your forebrain you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>And it also is very, very good.</p>
<p>If I get so many questions about,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m really upset.</p>
<p>I found out about my girlfriend&rsquo;s sexual past</p>
<p>or, hey, I&rsquo;m so upset.</p>
<p>I found out that my boyfriend was cheating</p>
<p>or, oh, so and so died.</p>
<p>How do I get over these emotions?</p>
<p>How do I deal with them?</p>
<p>And hypnosis has shown to be very useful for people</p>
<p>to learn to bring themselves into a state</p>
<p>of deep relaxation, to literally project in their mind&rsquo;s eye</p>
<p>these very intense things that they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And then for people to associate with other emotions</p>
<p>in their body to learn to be calm</p>
<p>while feeling your feelings,</p>
<p>to dissociate the mind body communication to some extent.</p>
<p>Just observe the feelings.</p>
<p>Observe them and start to associate them</p>
<p>with positive experiences.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an Android guy,</p>
<p>so soon it should be available on Android.</p>
<p>Then it doesn&rsquo;t exist for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only, you know, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Android is the device of the people,</p>
<p>all you elitist people with your iPhones.</p>
<p>Tell me this about Android.</p>
<p>Now you want to, this is the one thing that gets me.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m very close to someone who uses an Android phone.</p>
<p>I feel like that.</p>
<p>So you have great people in your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>No, their messages always look green to me,</p>
<p>but I answer yours, not despite that.</p>
<p>But they, I feel like the Android phones</p>
<p>are very trigger happy.</p>
<p>Like anything I touch does something.</p>
<p>Whereas the Apple phone is kind of built</p>
<p>for like a macaque monkey to be able to operate,</p>
<p>which is great for me because I&rsquo;m more of a macaque monkey</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a more sophisticated ape.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>I feel like that.</p>
<p>I think like you have to be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more sensitive.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to have, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got fat fingers, you know, I&rsquo;ve got clumsy fingers.</p>
<p>The Android is too, well, maybe you need</p>
<p>to soften your touch.</p>
<p>What I would do is go into the most,</p>
<p>sort by most popular, because there&rsquo;s some older ones</p>
<p>that I really like and it generally scales with that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll do the, this one,</p>
<p>the hypnosis for clearing subconscious negativity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an hour long one.</p>
<p>The sleep and anxiety one, 40 minutes,</p>
<p>but those you listen to as you fall asleep.</p>
<p>As you fall asleep.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re going to do this now?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, let&rsquo;s listen to it.</p>
<p>And I have created this hypnosis recording for you</p>
<p>to help you.</p>
<p>And this is the voice.</p>
<p>How often does the voice pop up?</p>
<p>And at the same time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t watch it.</p>
<p>You just listen to it.</p>
<p>Your anxiety.</p>
<p>Now, one of the most important things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great voice.</p>
<p>At the outset of any self hypnosis experience</p>
<p>is to know and understand.</p>
<p>So people really should know that stage hypnosis</p>
<p>is about the hypnotist getting you to do things</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t normally do.</p>
<p>Self hypnosis, which is what we&rsquo;re talking about here,</p>
<p>reverie in this is about you getting your brain</p>
<p>into the state that you want.</p>
<p>And again, I mean, there&rsquo;s a ton of neuroimaging data</p>
<p>and work on trauma and pain relief.</p>
<p>And our labs are working on this with David Spiegel&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>I really encourage people to explore NSDR.</p>
<p>And if this feels a little too wacky and out there,</p>
<p>then I would just put in NSDR into YouTube</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some good NSDR scripts.</p>
<p>Yeah, by the way, Sondar is a fan of your podcast.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s okay, we don&rsquo;t need to play it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t know him.</p>
<p>But I get a lot of media outlets picked up</p>
<p>on his love of NSDR.</p>
<p>And I have to imagine running Google involves a lot of,</p>
<p>juggling a lot of.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the great CEOs because everybody loves him.</p>
<p>Everybody loves him.</p>
<p>Have you interviewed him?</p>
<p>No, but we&rsquo;ll do the interview eventually.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this annoying thing about me being a stickler</p>
<p>for three hours, CEOs don&rsquo;t seem to understand.</p>
<p>Like, not understand, but it&rsquo;s scheduling.</p>
<p>So what happens is Sondar said, yes, definitely, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of podcasts, is a fan of yours.</p>
<p>And then he goes to his executive assistant like,</p>
<p>oh, let&rsquo;s find a slot.</p>
<p>And then they immediately think, all right,</p>
<p>well, one hour is good.</p>
<p>45 minutes.</p>
<p>90 minutes.</p>
<p>By Zoom.</p>
<p>90 minutes, yeah, right.</p>
<p>Well, no, they know in person that I&rsquo;m a stickler on that.</p>
<p>But like, it&rsquo;s like, no, we need more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so hard to.</p>
<p>Do you still travel to do your podcast or generally?</p>
<p>No, most people come down here.</p>
<p>Most people, but for certain situations, obviously,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re in prison.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re ahead of.</p>
<p>Imagine if you get out on work for a lot of people</p>
<p>that have anklets so that they can go to an Alex Friedman</p>
<p>podcast, it&rsquo;ll probably happen.</p>
<p>Have you ever been in a prison?</p>
<p>No, you know, either a visitation or on the inside.</p>
<p>From my hike, I can see San Quentin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really weird that San Quentin and Alcatraz,</p>
<p>you know, Bay Area, beautiful, everyone thinks like,</p>
<p>you know, like there&rsquo;s the Bay and there&rsquo;s Alcatraz</p>
<p>and San Quentin sitting right there.</p>
<p>Does that make you feel?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s amazing how easy it is to overlook</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re there and forget that they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>But when I drive by San Quentin, I think about it.</p>
<p>I also think about the people who are in there</p>
<p>who might be innocent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some of those episodes on Rogan and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And Amanda Knox talks a lot about this, right?</p>
<p>Whether or not you believe her story or not,</p>
<p>I happen to believe her story, personally,</p>
<p>based on what I know, what, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are people disagree with me.</p>
<p>I think to myself, what it must be like to be in a cell</p>
<p>and know in your heart&rsquo;s heart, you didn&rsquo;t do it, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t think of many things worse.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of many things worse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so clearly unjust, but life is full of unjust things</p>
<p>like this, cruel things happen all the time.</p>
<p>You lose a loved one for no good reason.</p>
<p>You lose your job.</p>
<p>You lose your home.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been talking to a lot of refugees now,</p>
<p>and the war in Ukraine has really focused my mind</p>
<p>to how much suffering there is in the world.</p>
<p>And so just cruel things happen all the time.</p>
<p>And people kind of, there&rsquo;s this suffering,</p>
<p>and you kind of go on.</p>
<p>You stick to the people really close to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still love all around you.</p>
<p>Traumatic events kind of focus your mind on the,</p>
<p>like, very practical, like, okay,</p>
<p>how do we solve the problem?</p>
<p>How do we escape?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s solve, like, survival, food, shelter, focus.</p>
<p>Remember that book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All&rsquo;s Quiet on the Western Front,&rdquo; by World War I?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this line in there.</p>
<p>I forget what it is,</p>
<p>about how war is like the smell of a skunk.</p>
<p>Like a little bit is actually a little bit is slightly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something slightly delicious of it,</p>
<p>is what it says in the book.</p>
<p>I happen to like the smell of ferrets and skunks and things.</p>
<p>I had a pet ferret when I was a kid,</p>
<p>and I like that musky scent.</p>
<p>Most people, just it&rsquo;s repulsive to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a gene, believe it or not.</p>
<p>Some people have the gene</p>
<p>that makes the musky scent repulsive.</p>
<p>Some people love it. Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another gene, this is a fun one.</p>
<p>Microwave popcorn, smells good, neutral,</p>
<p>or disgusting to you?</p>
<p>Good, very good.</p>
<p>There are people who have a gene</p>
<p>that leads them to the perception</p>
<p>that the smell of microwave popcorn that you find is good,</p>
<p>it smells like putrid vomit to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a particular gene variant,</p>
<p>and they can smell certain elements</p>
<p>within the microwave popcorn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty, it&rsquo;s prominent in France.</p>
<p>This gene, and so in laboratories</p>
<p>where you have a lot of French people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often said like you&rsquo;re not allowed</p>
<p>to make microwave popcorn.</p>
<p>It smells putrid, disgusting, you know?</p>
<p>So a lot of it&rsquo;s in the perception of the beholder, right?</p>
<p>But okay, before I leave the NSDR,</p>
<p>focus in general, as you said, it&rsquo;s for shifting mind states.</p>
<p>Is there advice you have for how to achieve focus</p>
<p>on a task?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>First of all, we have to distinguish</p>
<p>between modulators and mediators,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll do this very briefly.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things</p>
<p>that will modulate your state of focus,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t directly mediate your sense of focus.</p>
<p>So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off</p>
<p>in this building, it would modulate our attention.</p>
<p>We would get up and leave.</p>
<p>It would be very hard to do what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with that banging in the background, at least at first.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s modulating focus, but it&rsquo;s not really involved</p>
<p>in the mechanisms of focus, right?</p>
<p>In the same way, being well rested when you sleep,</p>
<p>your autonomic nervous system that adjusts states</p>
<p>of alertness and focus and calm works better</p>
<p>than when you&rsquo;re sleep deprived.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re sleeping better, you&rsquo;re gonna focus better.</p>
<p>So I always answer this way to a question like this,</p>
<p>because the best thing that anyone can do</p>
<p>for their mental health, physical health, and performance</p>
<p>in athletic or cognitive endeavors or creative endeavors</p>
<p>is to make sure that you&rsquo;re getting enough quality sleep,</p>
<p>enough of the time for you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna differ.</p>
<p>We could talk about what that means.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of things that mediate focus</p>
<p>without getting into the description of mechanisms,</p>
<p>cause we have podcasts about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that mental focus follows visual focus,</p>
<p>provided that you&rsquo;re a sighted person.</p>
<p>Much of the training that&rsquo;s being done now in China</p>
<p>to teach kids to focus better,</p>
<p>literally has them stare at a target,</p>
<p>blinking every so often, but really training themselves</p>
<p>to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture.</p>
<p>When you read, you have to maintain</p>
<p>a tight visual aperture.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re literally scrolling like a highlighter</p>
<p>in your mind&rsquo;s eye, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of obvious once you hear it.</p>
<p>So for people that have problems focusing sleep well,</p>
<p>learn to dilate and contract your visual field consciously.</p>
<p>This can be done if you practice it a little bit.</p>
<p>And then as I said before,</p>
<p>it is very hard to get into a state of focus,</p>
<p>like a step function immediately, like snapping your fingers.</p>
<p>What you can do is you can pick any object,</p>
<p>but ideally an object at roughly the same distance,</p>
<p>placed at roughly the same distance</p>
<p>to which you&rsquo;re going to do that work and stare at it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to blink.</p>
<p>And as your mind starts to drift every once in a while</p>
<p>to understand that&rsquo;s normal,</p>
<p>but try and narrow your visual aperture</p>
<p>and bring that into your visual field</p>
<p>so that that&rsquo;s the most prominent thing,</p>
<p>kind of like portrait mode in your phone.</p>
<p>This would look very different in portrait mode</p>
<p>than it would in just a standard photograph mode.</p>
<p>And then after doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,</p>
<p>moving into the work that you&rsquo;re about to do</p>
<p>and really encourage yourself to do that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s low vision or no vision,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to use your ears to do this.</p>
<p>Braille readers have trouble focusing sometimes</p>
<p>because they feel other stuff and they hear other stuff.</p>
<p>So you learn to adjust that aperture consciously.</p>
<p>And then of course the pharmacologic tools,</p>
<p>just enough caffeine, but not too much, right?</p>
<p>We talked about white noise, brown noise,</p>
<p>music or no music, really varies,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that binaural beats of 40 Hertz</p>
<p>can shift the brain into a heightened state</p>
<p>of focus and cognition.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to use binaural beats,</p>
<p>which should definitely be used with headphones,</p>
<p>and there are a number of free apps out there and sources,</p>
<p>40 Hertz seems to be the frequency</p>
<p>that best supports the brain shifting</p>
<p>into a particular mode of focus.</p>
<p>Sorry, can you give us some binaural beats?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re going to look for,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want to find an app that offers 40 Hertz.</p>
<p>I think Brainwave allows you to slide bar</p>
<p>up to the particular frequency that you want.</p>
<p>And I should say that there are other frequencies</p>
<p>that are interesting, but 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>seems to be the one</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s the most quality research on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a beat, but you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of mixed science</p>
<p>on the white noise and brown noise.</p>
<p>You really should be doing this with headphones</p>
<p>because binaural beats are best accomplished</p>
<p>by feeding two different frequencies to the two ears.</p>
<p>And then you have what&rsquo;s called this brainstem area</p>
<p>that reads out what are called interaural time differences.</p>
<p>And then it extracts the delta essentially.</p>
<p>Turn it up.</p>
<p>And then in other things that can enhance focus.</p>
<p>So, you know, the pharmacology around this</p>
<p>is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Things that tickle the dopamine pathway</p>
<p>and the acetylcholine pathway, they work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your Ritalin, your Adderals,</p>
<p>your Modafinils, which are prescription.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of non prescription use</p>
<p>of those prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Not so much in my generation,</p>
<p>but in people 35 and younger, you know,</p>
<p>I hear all the time from day traders</p>
<p>and programmers and stuff and kids that play video games,</p>
<p>a lot of Ritalin Adderall use.</p>
<p>I think that unless it&rsquo;s prescribed by a doctor</p>
<p>for a specific purpose of ADHD,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people should go that route, frankly.</p>
<p>Hits the dopamine system way too hard.</p>
<p>Also has a number of negative effects on sexual side effects,</p>
<p>all sorts of things that you just wouldn&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>There are a few compounds like alpha GPC,</p>
<p>300 milligrams to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC</p>
<p>with a cup of espresso.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re well rested, you&rsquo;re like a laser for 90 minutes,</p>
<p>maybe two hours, but then it&rsquo;s going to taper off</p>
<p>and you have to just recognize that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this whole world of nootropics now</p>
<p>and people trying to figure out the racetams,</p>
<p>paracetams and phenol ethylamine combined with this.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s not quite in the place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d like it to be.</p>
<p>There are a few companies</p>
<p>that are doing this better than others.</p>
<p>We talk about some of these on the podcast,</p>
<p>but I would always start with behavioral tools</p>
<p>and then consider pharmacology.</p>
<p>And then I suppose the other thing for focus</p>
<p>is there are these, this is a little more esoteric,</p>
<p>but we cover this in an episode on workplace optimization.</p>
<p>Where you place your screen is important.</p>
<p>Staring down at a screen is not going to be as effective</p>
<p>as placing it at eye level or above you.</p>
<p>When the eyes are up,</p>
<p>literally when your eyes are directed forward or up,</p>
<p>the brainstem centers for alertness are activated.</p>
<p>When your eyes are down, it&rsquo;s actually you&rsquo;re sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being pulled under water a little bit</p>
<p>in the autonomic arousal sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your closing your eyes is one,</p>
<p>it reflects the brainstem centers</p>
<p>that are active becoming less,</p>
<p>or for alertness, excuse me, becoming less active.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a really cool effect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s active in this room right now,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;ve been some really interesting studies</p>
<p>that when people work in small compact spaces</p>
<p>or wear a hoodie or a hat,</p>
<p>that can also improve focus like blinders on a horse</p>
<p>for obvious reasons now, based on what I said before,</p>
<p>but also analytic work or the kind of work</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a correct answer that you&rsquo;re seeking</p>
<p>is best supported by these kind of low ceiling environments.</p>
<p>Whereas there&rsquo;s something called the cathedral effect,</p>
<p>which is when you work in an outdoor environment</p>
<p>or a high ceiling environment,</p>
<p>it lends itself to kind of pun intended,</p>
<p>kind of loftier ideas and more creativity.</p>
<p>And that probably has to do with the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a natural tendency, a reflex</p>
<p>to expand your visual field</p>
<p>in these high ceiling environments.</p>
<p>Expansion of the visual field</p>
<p>changes the way the brain works in the time domain.</p>
<p>Your engineering and biology oriented listeners</p>
<p>will understand this and music.</p>
<p>For those that don&rsquo;t, the best way to think about it</p>
<p>is when you have a narrow focus portrait mode on your phone</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re very alert, you are fine slicing life in time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a, think of it as a high frame rate,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re shooting in slow motion.</p>
<p>When you have a, when you dilate your view,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking bigger time bins.</p>
<p>And that one way to just let this hopefully land home</p>
<p>is that if you&rsquo;ve ever had a really exciting day</p>
<p>or podcast interview or experience of any kind,</p>
<p>your system is flooded with dopamine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>alertness and motivation, all this excitement.</p>
<p>It seems like it goes by very, very fast.</p>
<p>And yet when you think back to that,</p>
<p>it seems like a lot happened.</p>
<p>This happened and that happened.</p>
<p>Now think about waiting in the doctor&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>in a blank waiting room</p>
<p>with no interesting art on the walls.</p>
<p>It feels like it goes by very, very slow.</p>
<p>Dopamine and norepinephrine are at all time low.</p>
<p>And yet when you think back on that experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if nothing happened</p>
<p>because you were parsing time differently.</p>
<p>So those are the roughly the tools</p>
<p>and the neurochemicals around time perception</p>
<p>and the time domain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful book, I&rsquo;m forgetting the title,</p>
<p>so wonderful I forget the title,</p>
<p>by Dean Bodo Mano from UCLA,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s called The Brain is a Time Machine</p>
<p>that talks about this expansion and contraction</p>
<p>of the time domain and what you can do</p>
<p>to leverage it for work and creativity focus and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating that I think one way</p>
<p>to define focus for me is the experience,</p>
<p>the feeling of focus is losing track of time,</p>
<p>is getting to a place where you&rsquo;re no longer</p>
<p>operating in time.</p>
<p>Well, and you mentioned being kind of cramming for something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll release a lot of adrenaline.</p>
<p>And it is true, you can get a lot done under pressure</p>
<p>because of the way that you&rsquo;re slicing time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually have more time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re finally in a brain state</p>
<p>that lends itself well to parsing information really quickly.</p>
<p>Now, if we ramp up your level of stress enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely, it&rsquo;s a more or less normal distribution.</p>
<p>We get you stressed enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to remember anything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not parsing time well.</p>
<p>But in that middle range, almost every study shows</p>
<p>that the higher levels of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>meaning norepinephrine, adrenaline in your system,</p>
<p>the more effective you are at things.</p>
<p>And we always hear stress and adrenaline,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just bad, bad, bad.</p>
<p>But my colleague, Ali Krom at Stanford</p>
<p>has done these beautiful studies</p>
<p>where if you just educate people</p>
<p>on how adrenaline makes them sharper thinkers,</p>
<p>they become sharper thinkers.</p>
<p>If you educate them on the fact that stress</p>
<p>makes your cognition worse, their cognition gets worse.</p>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t wear a sleep tracker.</p>
<p>If you tell people they slept poorly,</p>
<p>your recovery score sucks,</p>
<p>they naturally perform less well the next day</p>
<p>than if you tell them your recovery score is high.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t have anything against those companies,</p>
<p>but in fact, we use some of their technology,</p>
<p>can be very useful in certain contexts,</p>
<p>but you want to determine your mindset around these things.</p>
<p>And if you tell yourself,</p>
<p>hey, deadlines make me sharp, pressure makes me sharp,</p>
<p>you will perform better.</p>
<p>So stress and anxiety, what is that?</p>
<p>And can it be leveraged for good?</p>
<p>Absolutely, look, whether or not you get into a cold ice bath</p>
<p>or a hot sauna so hot you want to get out,</p>
<p>or you get hit square in the face with something over text</p>
<p>that you really didn&rsquo;t want to hear or see, it&rsquo;s adrenaline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just adrenaline.</p>
<p>And so your subjective readout of that</p>
<p>and what it means is really important.</p>
<p>And you can just channel that.</p>
<p>Well, you can, if you agree with the following statement,</p>
<p>which I do, and many people do because the data support it,</p>
<p>which is Allie Crum&rsquo;s statement, not mine,</p>
<p>which is she directs the mind body lab at Stanford.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s brilliant, by the way, brilliant Harvard trained,</p>
<p>Yale trained, trained licensed clinical psychologist,</p>
<p>also a tenured professor at Stanford.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a Olympian, no, excuse me,</p>
<p>a division one athlete in gymnastics and martial arts.</p>
<p>And her dad is a long time martial arts trainer,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done work with special forces</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an amazing human being and very humble,</p>
<p>very kind, lovely woman and professor scientist.</p>
<p>She says, anything that you do and experience,</p>
<p>but especially stress is the consequence of that thing</p>
<p>and what you believe about that thing.</p>
<p>And so if you consume a lot of information</p>
<p>about the powers of stressful states to bring out your best,</p>
<p>you will perform better.</p>
<p>If you consume a lot of information</p>
<p>about the power of stress to cripple you,</p>
<p>you will perform worse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no question, the data are striking.</p>
<p>And this is not growth mindset.</p>
<p>This is just simply what do you believe about stress</p>
<p>based on the dominant knowledge</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re consuming about it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fun to watch David Goggins,</p>
<p>here we go again, David or Jocko or Joe or someone put,</p>
<p>or Cam Haynes put out this information about,</p>
<p>or Ryan Hall who ran for Stanford</p>
<p>and then now is like into the power lifting thing</p>
<p>and running.</p>
<p>And there are others too, of course.</p>
<p>When you start to consume a lot of that information,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just inspiring,</p>
<p>it actually changes your perception</p>
<p>of what your own stressful states mean.</p>
<p>You can actually get better from stress</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the ocean of knowledge that stress grows you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re living in the ocean of knowledge,</p>
<p>I was seeing like a pool in the summer,</p>
<p>you got the kiddie pool,</p>
<p>the kids all peeing in it, presumably.</p>
<p>And you got the diving thing,</p>
<p>you got the high dive and all that.</p>
<p>If you believe that the experience of belly flopping</p>
<p>off the high dive is gonna make you a better diver,</p>
<p>in some sense, at least in this analogy, it will.</p>
<p>Whereas if you feel that it&rsquo;s just the most embarrassing</p>
<p>thing ever, and it&rsquo;s gonna cripple your ability</p>
<p>to get out in the dive in front of anybody ever again,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re right about that too.</p>
<p>Yeah, we actually talked with Carl about depression,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that there could be</p>
<p>these, what are commonly seen as negative journeys,</p>
<p>they could be, when reframed, can be used.</p>
<p>You know, one of the reasons I enjoy our friendship so much</p>
<p>is that you bring this Russian thing,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t really understand it at a deep level,</p>
<p>how could I, I&rsquo;m not Russian,</p>
<p>but this mindset like that there&rsquo;s pain in life.</p>
<p>When I watched that Hedgehog in the Fog cartoon,</p>
<p>I thought, no wonder Russians call it the way they do.</p>
<p>This is the most, it&rsquo;s so sad,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beautiful in Sabbath, it&rsquo;s so sad.</p>
<p>Whereas out here, it&rsquo;s like Sesame Street,</p>
<p>and my mother would not let me watch Sesame Street</p>
<p>when I was a kid.</p>
<p>She thought it was too chaotic.</p>
<p>Too chaotic. Too chaotic.</p>
<p>She was like, it&rsquo;s too chaotic.</p>
<p>Too many things going on.</p>
<p>Captain Kangaroo, we were allowed,</p>
<p>and then Mr. Rogers, we were allowed.</p>
<p>I never really liked shows,</p>
<p>I liked doing things outside in the yard.</p>
<p>I was trying to trap all the animals,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna watch stuff on TV.</p>
<p>But Hedgehog in the Fog is enough to turn any kid</p>
<p>into a thinker and a philosopher and a poet.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>I fell in love with this when you showed,</p>
<p>look, it even walks with its arms behind its back.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re watching little clips here to get into,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a hedgehog that is wandering about</p>
<p>in this fog at night, and.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t even see a lamp.</p>
<p>The fog is so dense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a feeling of searching.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a horse that speaks from a distance.</p>
<p>Words of wisdom.</p>
<p>Some people actually told me that they believe that&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s supposed to represent God.</p>
<p>I always thought it was a motherly voice, or a voice.</p>
<p>A voice of conformity that wants you to return to safety.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the hedgehog is searching</p>
<p>for something that&rsquo;s in him for the unknown,</p>
<p>to explore the unknown.</p>
<p>And ultimately, as it, as the cartoon unrolls,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, he discovers a friend in a bear.</p>
<p>And he also discovers a lifetime passion</p>
<p>for looking up at the stars,</p>
<p>and the curiosity of exploring what is up there.</p>
<p>And I see that as science, as exploring the mystery.</p>
<p>And also I see that as brave to explore the mystery</p>
<p>given all the uncertainty all around you.</p>
<p>But there is a melancholy, the whole sound of it,</p>
<p>the feel of it, the look of it.</p>
<p>It was, it just captures both the melancholy</p>
<p>and the wonder of childhood.</p>
<p>Which is like, there&rsquo;s a loneliness to it.</p>
<p>Like, nobody understands me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s there, that children can feel.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re trying to figure out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite character right there.</p>
<p>I love the owl.</p>
<p>The owl shows up every once in a while.</p>
<p>I love the owl.</p>
<p>Sorry, I interrupted you.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s non sequitur.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;re interested 70% of the time.</p>
<p>The other 30%, you&rsquo;re just an asshole.</p>
<p>So you have to figure out which.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m told.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s non sequitur parts in this cartoon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s voted as one of the greatest cartoons of all time.</p>
<p>Short, short little films, documentary filmmakers.</p>
<p>So it is, you know, in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>in a lot of sort of authoritarian regimes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s channels to communicate difficult ideas to people.</p>
<p>And you figure out those channels.</p>
<p>And in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>one of those channels was children&rsquo;s cartoons.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually, they&rsquo;re very much for adults.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like that in some countries,</p>
<p>not so much in the US,</p>
<p>children are treated with more respect</p>
<p>for their intelligence, you know,</p>
<p>and not constantly getting this drivel</p>
<p>of just kind of moronic explosions and whistles and bells</p>
<p>and the voices that just kind of, you know,</p>
<p>children, obviously are children and need to be,</p>
<p>their brains are young and plastic</p>
<p>and need to be treated and nurtured as such.</p>
<p>But they have an intelligence.</p>
<p>And I think that you treat them like morons</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna behave like morons.</p>
<p>You treat them as, you know,</p>
<p>people who can consume information</p>
<p>and make sense of it in their own way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>They have a seriousness of looking at the world.</p>
<p>I love people that talk with children like they&rsquo;re adults.</p>
<p>Well, like, here&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re talking to a mini Einstein,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like really,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re asking some big questions.</p>
<p>And I think, I mean, people sometimes</p>
<p>speak of me in this way.</p>
<p>Like, how dumb is this childlike person?</p>
<p>But like, no, there&rsquo;s intelligence</p>
<p>in these dumb, simple questions that a child asks.</p>
<p>And I always love those questions, the simplicity,</p>
<p>but also the depth of those questions.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The reason I started watching your podcast</p>
<p>was you did an episode early on with Ray Dalio.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the first, maybe the first,</p>
<p>but a question that you definitely asked him</p>
<p>was you just said, what is money?</p>
<p>And his answer was fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a superb question and he gave a superb answer.</p>
<p>And I never would have thought to ask that question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>And it was the question to tee things off with.</p>
<p>So simple questions that get right</p>
<p>to the heart of the matter, you know,</p>
<p>and kids aren&rsquo;t often putting the same cultural filters</p>
<p>and you know, kids generally aren&rsquo;t concerned</p>
<p>about getting canceled either.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll ask the question</p>
<p>that no one else is willing to ask.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not concerned about</p>
<p>how dumb the question sounds.</p>
<p>I find the most fascinating questions</p>
<p>are just really, really simple.</p>
<p>And it is a bit embarrassing to ask those simple questions</p>
<p>of like, what is anything?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking them for all of us, so please ask them.</p>
<p>I think that question, what is money, is crucial.</p>
<p>And I think the simple questions are the most,</p>
<p>obviously the most interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask you about, you had awesome podcasts.</p>
<p>I mean, I can ask you questions about basically</p>
<p>all your podcasts.</p>
<p>People should definitely listen to the Huberman Lab,</p>
<p>but with Andy Gap and the conversation,</p>
<p>you talked about strength and muscle building</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he also works with a lot of UFC fighters</p>
<p>and he works with, he has a lab that includes a gym.</p>
<p>And so he works on endurance and powerlifting</p>
<p>and also hypertrophy training, et cetera.</p>
<p>But he also does muscle biopsy.</p>
<p>So he runs the full spectrum</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a full tenured professor</p>
<p>and he does all this stuff.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a really unique person</p>
<p>in this whole fitness landscape</p>
<p>because there are a lot of PTs out there.</p>
<p>There are a lot of kinesiologists.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people studying nutrition</p>
<p>and sports training.</p>
<p>But I think he has the, among the people out there,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s at least in the top five,</p>
<p>probably within the top three of people</p>
<p>that really have their arms around the full extent</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s possible with training.</p>
<p>And he works with the UFC Performance Center.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, he just said a very systematic way</p>
<p>of describing things that was really nice.</p>
<p>You know, skill, speed, power, strength,</p>
<p>hypertrophy, so muscle mass, right?</p>
<p>Endurance, all kinds of,</p>
<p>and then the philosophical of like adaptation,</p>
<p>how to overload stuff, all that very,</p>
<p>is there stuff, I&rsquo;ll ask you about ice bath and sauna,</p>
<p>which was surprising to me there.</p>
<p>Is there stuff you took away from that conversation,</p>
<p>like principles about how to get strong,</p>
<p>how to build muscle mass,</p>
<p>that like broadened and deepened your understanding</p>
<p>of that task?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do these in bullet points</p>
<p>because if people want the logic behind them</p>
<p>and the mechanism, they can listen to that episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good episode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with heat and cold really quickly</p>
<p>and just say that avoid cold immersion.</p>
<p>So ice baths and being in cold water up to the neck,</p>
<p>uncomfortably cold within the four hours</p>
<p>after a training session that&rsquo;s designed</p>
<p>to evoke an adaptation,</p>
<p>either endurance, hypertrophy, or strength,</p>
<p>because the inflammation that you experienced</p>
<p>from a hard endurance workout or from a hard strength</p>
<p>or a hard hypertrophy workout is the stimulus</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to adapt to.</p>
<p>The cold water immersion reduces inflammation</p>
<p>and can short circuit some of that.</p>
<p>After four hours, you&rsquo;re probably okay,</p>
<p>but if you can do it a different day</p>
<p>or you can do it before those sessions, that&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>Heat, however, can be done immediately after training</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably beneficial</p>
<p>because of the way that it dilates the vascular system</p>
<p>and perfuses the muscles and ligaments, et cetera,</p>
<p>with more nutrients.</p>
<p>And I should just mention</p>
<p>that was a crucial piece of information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit surprising.</p>
<p>Was it surprising to you?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because I actually,</p>
<p>the way I posed the question to him about cold</p>
<p>was I hear that getting into an ice bath</p>
<p>or a cold water immersion after training</p>
<p>can reduce hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>And he said, no, it is a big deal.</p>
<p>It will short circuit your progress.</p>
<p>Now, for people that are only interested in performance,</p>
<p>who are doing a lot of workouts and trying to recover,</p>
<p>but not trying to grow muscle, get stronger,</p>
<p>or build endurance, then it makes sense to do cold.</p>
<p>Like skill development or something.</p>
<p>Skill development, or you&rsquo;re an athlete in season.</p>
<p>So you have to, what&rsquo;s so great about Andy</p>
<p>is he really points out the specific ways to train</p>
<p>given your specific goals.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re getting swole,</p>
<p>stay out of the ice bath after a workout, there you go.</p>
<p>Lex is always making fun of the meatheads.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I put myself in the meathead category</p>
<p>only because I don&rsquo;t do a real sport now.</p>
<p>I work out and I run, which is working out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an aspiring meathead, okay, so.</p>
<p>One of these days I&rsquo;m going to get back to Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to get to Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of training,</p>
<p>he has this beautiful three by five concept for strength.</p>
<p>Pick three exercises, compound exercises,</p>
<p>multi joint movements, do them for,</p>
<p>do three to five exercises</p>
<p>for three to five repetitions per set,</p>
<p>rest three to five minutes,</p>
<p>and do that three to five times per week.</p>
<p>And for details, you can, again, look to the episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s timestamped.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting about this is</p>
<p>three to five times a week is a lot for a muscle group.</p>
<p>Squatting five times a week for five reps,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re working pretty heavy,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re close to failure,</p>
<p>but not failure for strength generally.</p>
<p>What Andy taught me is that people</p>
<p>who are training mostly for strength</p>
<p>can do these low rep type regimens frequently</p>
<p>because most of the adaptation is neural.</p>
<p>And because you&rsquo;re not pushing to failure,</p>
<p>in most cases, you don&rsquo;t get that sore.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the motor neurons getting the muscle fibers</p>
<p>to contract more intensely or with more efficiency</p>
<p>in other ways that&rsquo;s leading to these strength gains.</p>
<p>And this is why power lifters can train every day</p>
<p>or five days a week or four days a week.</p>
<p>For hypertrophy, I learned from Andy</p>
<p>that the repetition range can be pretty broad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking anywhere from six to 30 repetitions.</p>
<p>You should do 10 sets per muscle group per week,</p>
<p>maybe even a bit more.</p>
<p>So high volume.</p>
<p>High volume, but you have to go to failure</p>
<p>or beyond in order to stimulate growth.</p>
<p>Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions?</p>
<p>Well, there apparently are three ways</p>
<p>that you stimulate hypertrophy and maybe more.</p>
<p>One is tissue micro damage to the tissue.</p>
<p>The other is through some sort of tension based changes</p>
<p>in the molecular gene programs of cells</p>
<p>that lead to protein synthesis</p>
<p>that are distinct from damage.</p>
<p>And the other are metabolic effects</p>
<p>of like high repetition work</p>
<p>of super fusion of the muscle with blood.</p>
<p>We know that third category exists</p>
<p>because people are now doing this blood restriction training</p>
<p>where they cuff off a muscle</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll use a really lightweight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done these before.</p>
<p>You can use a five pound weight and do curls with this</p>
<p>and you are in pain and the muscles are swelling up</p>
<p>with blood.</p>
<p>It does lead to hypertrophy,</p>
<p>but in general, you&rsquo;re not sore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing tissue damage.</p>
<p>And by the way, don&rsquo;t just turn to get off a muscle</p>
<p>cause you have to use the proper cuffs</p>
<p>because you need the blood still to flow in one direction.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just cinch it off</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll potentially kill yourself</p>
<p>if you get a clot or you do it wrong.</p>
<p>So get the appropriate cuffs, they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>And then for endurance, I learned something really cool.</p>
<p>So I work out basically,</p>
<p>I go to the gym every other day on average,</p>
<p>three or four days a week I do that,</p>
<p>but generally not two days in a row to work out.</p>
<p>Next day I&rsquo;ll do cardio next day.</p>
<p>And the cardio for me is always a 30 to 45 minute jog</p>
<p>kind of zone two cardio.</p>
<p>Andy informed me that to build endurance</p>
<p>while building strength and maintaining some muscle size</p>
<p>or even building muscle size,</p>
<p>I would be wise to take one day a week</p>
<p>and add to that all out max heart rate work</p>
<p>for 90 seconds at least.</p>
<p>So do 90 seconds then rest</p>
<p>and then maybe do another 90 second all out sprint.</p>
<p>I almost missed my flight going from Los Angeles to Austin.</p>
<p>I did that all out sprint in the airport yesterday.</p>
<p>So I actually can think it&rsquo;s done for me.</p>
<p>So there was a sprinting Dr. Huberman throughout.</p>
<p>With three bags.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Cause I travel, generally I&rsquo;ll travel</p>
<p>with too much stuff.</p>
<p>I love how you were probably running late for a flight</p>
<p>and use that as an opportunity to explore.</p>
<p>Well, I was doing it.</p>
<p>I was thinking to myself,</p>
<p>okay, Andy, that&rsquo;s a 90 second sprint.</p>
<p>Cause I got to the security line.</p>
<p>I finally got TSC.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s for better, that&rsquo;s for extending endurance?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for, yeah.</p>
<p>It actually has some carry over effects on endurance</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing the other stuff.</p>
<p>And then he also said one day a week to do this workout</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t done it yet.</p>
<p>Maybe we do it tomorrow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be fun.</p>
<p>Which is you run a mile,</p>
<p>you ask yourself, how long did that take?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it took eight minutes.</p>
<p>Then you walk or rest for eight minutes.</p>
<p>Then you run another mile as fast as you can.</p>
<p>And then you rest for the equivalent period.</p>
<p>And you do that one to three times once per week.</p>
<p>So you do.</p>
<p>And so as an all around fitness program,</p>
<p>it make, you could collapse this into something</p>
<p>where you say, okay,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna work out with the weights</p>
<p>for about an hour every other day.</p>
<p>Maybe take two days off every once in a while.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to do six to 15 repetitions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna push to failure on some of those, not all,</p>
<p>because some of those are designed to build more strength.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to failure in heavier.</p>
<p>Some are designed for hypertrophy, higher rep</p>
<p>and going to failure.</p>
<p>And then on off days,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna jog for 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>But for two days a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re either at the end of your jog or whatever,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do some all out sprints for 90 seconds</p>
<p>and then rest and repeat.</p>
<p>And for another day, you&rsquo;re going to do these mile repeats.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty large chunk of exercise movement.</p>
<p>But if you kind of thread through the middle of all that,</p>
<p>what you end up with is some decent strength,</p>
<p>building protocols, some decent hypertrophy,</p>
<p>some cardiovascular training</p>
<p>that establishes the so called A base or a so called base.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not gonna get really good at anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna become a marathoner this way,</p>
<p>an optimizing marathon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna optimize powerlifting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna optimize hypertrophy.</p>
<p>But for the typical person, 75% of people, 75% of the time,</p>
<p>they want some muscle, they want some strength,</p>
<p>they want some endurance,</p>
<p>and they want the capacity to sprint to the security gate</p>
<p>without leaving a lung in the terminal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like functional stuff,</p>
<p>like your life going up the stairs is easier,</p>
<p>moving about, all that kind of just regular life.</p>
<p>And I should mention that cold showers after training</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to short circuit the training effect</p>
<p>to the same extent that immersion in cold water does.</p>
<p>And that really speaks to the fact that cold showers,</p>
<p>even though they can provide some of the adrenaline</p>
<p>for the mental effects of like,</p>
<p>oh, I have a lot of adrenaline in my system</p>
<p>from a cold shower and I can remain calm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s utility to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to have the same metabolic effects</p>
<p>or other positive effects that cold water exposure</p>
<p>has been shown to have.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s unfortunate because most people</p>
<p>have access to cold showers,</p>
<p>not everyone has access to a cold dunker.</p>
<p>Or an ice dunk.</p>
<p>But here in Austin, you have this place,</p>
<p>and no, they don&rsquo;t pay me to say this,</p>
<p>but I always like going to this place</p>
<p>whenever I&rsquo;m in town, this place, Kuya.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve got a sauna and a couple ice baths.</p>
<p>And they even have those salt tanks</p>
<p>that you can float on the surface.</p>
<p>Do they have ice baths there?</p>
<p>They have cold water immersion, it&rsquo;s pretty cold.</p>
<p>Still haven&rsquo;t done an ice bath.</p>
<p>Really? I need to, yeah, I need to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Russian, you&rsquo;ll probably get in</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>Yeah, what is this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal here?</p>
<p>Exactly, or people pay for this.</p>
<p>I did a post, right, of you as a baby.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I had to go deep to get that photo of Lex</p>
<p>in a bassinet, in the snow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because in Russia, they actually did this for a long time.</p>
<p>They thought that it would,</p>
<p>and indeed it does build the immune system</p>
<p>to expose babies to the cold.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know where you got that photo.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you were able to find exactly the right,</p>
<p>it was great.</p>
<p>It was great research.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have a tie on,</p>
<p>but you had all the look and seriousness that you do now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clearly nature nurture,</p>
<p>clearly you were born with that.</p>
<p>What about sauna?</p>
<p>He does say that it&rsquo;s good to do heat.</p>
<p>So there are three ways you can do sauna</p>
<p>that I can just toss out as like briefings.</p>
<p>If you want to get a really big growth hormone release</p>
<p>for sake of metabolism, fat loss,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re training really, really hard in jujitsu</p>
<p>and you want to recover,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to sauna too often</p>
<p>because the study that identified this massive</p>
<p>16 fold increase in growth hormone,</p>
<p>they had people do this, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>They got into, okay, temperatures are 80</p>
<p>to 100 degrees centigrade.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 176 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>to 212 degrees Fahrenheit for five to 30 minutes</p>
<p>is the typical ranges that people work in</p>
<p>in these research studies.</p>
<p>For maximum growth hormone release,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do sauna more than once a week,</p>
<p>but get into the sauna for 30 minutes,</p>
<p>as hot as you can safely tolerate.</p>
<p>So probably for you, that&rsquo;ll be 210</p>
<p>because I suspect you&rsquo;ll be on the high end of things.</p>
<p>Then get out for five to 10 minutes, no cold exposure,</p>
<p>get back in the sauna for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Then they had them do it again,</p>
<p>out for five minutes, back for 30 minutes,</p>
<p>out for five minutes, back for three minutes.</p>
<p>They had them do two hours of sauna exposure</p>
<p>to get that growth hormone release.</p>
<p>Now for the reduction in likelihood</p>
<p>of dying of a cardiovascular event stroke or otherwise,</p>
<p>the more often you do sauna, the better.</p>
<p>So if you look at all cause mortality</p>
<p>or death due to cardiovascular events,</p>
<p>and you look at sauna use frequencies</p>
<p>using the same parameters, 80 to 100 degrees centigrade,</p>
<p>one to seven times per week,</p>
<p>basically the more often you get into the sauna</p>
<p>for 30 minutes across the week,</p>
<p>so 30 minutes a day is better than four times a week.</p>
<p>Four times a week is better than two times a week</p>
<p>and two times a week is better than one.</p>
<p>And the reductions in mortality are really impressive.</p>
<p>27, if you get into the sauna the way I just described,</p>
<p>not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes twice a week</p>
<p>or three times per week,</p>
<p>you reduce the likelihood of dying</p>
<p>of a cardiovascular event by 27%.</p>
<p>If you do it four or more times per week,</p>
<p>you reduce the probability of dying by 50%</p>
<p>of a cardiovascular event.</p>
<p>And in these studies,</p>
<p>they rule out other things that people are doing, smoking.</p>
<p>They even ask them, do you live in an apartment?</p>
<p>Are you in a happy relationship?</p>
<p>Like they evaluate other potentially confounding variables.</p>
<p>Now for people that don&rsquo;t have access to a sauna,</p>
<p>a hot water bath or hot tub is gonna be your next best bet.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have access to that,</p>
<p>do like the wrestlers do,</p>
<p>which is put on two sets of sweats and a hoodie</p>
<p>and a stocking cap and wrap yourself in plastics</p>
<p>underneath all that and go for a run,</p>
<p>but please nobody die of hyperthermia.</p>
<p>I mean, you can die of warming up too much.</p>
<p>Is this experience pleasant or stressful in the way,</p>
<p>so is it as stressful as an ice bath, for example?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>People always ask how cold to make the ice bath</p>
<p>or the cold water or the shower.</p>
<p>You want it to be uncomfortably cold,</p>
<p>meaning you want to feel like I really wanna get out,</p>
<p>but you can safely stay in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna vary by person and experience with it.</p>
<p>Experience, yeah.</p>
<p>With the sauna, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>How hot to make it?</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t kill yourself, obviously be smart.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re pregnant, you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this anyway,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that what you need</p>
<p>is the release of something called dinorphin.</p>
<p>We have endorphin, which makes us feel good.</p>
<p>It binds to these mu opioid receptors in the body.</p>
<p>You have dinorphin, which is the terrible feeling</p>
<p>that you get when you&rsquo;re in really hot temperatures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the terrible effect that alcoholics feel</p>
<p>when they are in withdrawal.</p>
<p>You feel agitated, you wanna get out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really unpleasant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dinorphin binding to the so called</p>
<p>kappa opioid receptor, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to trigger.</p>
<p>When you do that, a number of things happen.</p>
<p>You set off heat shock proteins that go repair</p>
<p>broken proteins and misfolded proteins.</p>
<p>It also makes it so that later endorphin binds its receptor</p>
<p>more strongly.</p>
<p>So when you have this uncomfortable experience in the heat,</p>
<p>you literally feel better in real life</p>
<p>when pleasurable events come on,</p>
<p>when you experience them.</p>
<p>In the same way, I like to say this,</p>
<p>that when you get into a cold ice bath or cold shower,</p>
<p>the increase in epinephrine and dopamine is two to 300%.</p>
<p>These are huge increases and they last many hours.</p>
<p>This is shown, because lately I&rsquo;ve gotten a little bit</p>
<p>of pushback on Twitter, which is interesting place.</p>
<p>People say, well, that&rsquo;s just in mice.</p>
<p>No, all the studies I just referred to</p>
<p>are all done in humans, men and women,</p>
<p>fairly broad age ranges.</p>
<p>So you want to be uncomfortable in the cold.</p>
<p>You wanna be uncomfortable in the heat.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m not a big fan of infrared saunas</p>
<p>because they only go up to about 160, 170 degrees.</p>
<p>Infrared light and far red light of all kinds</p>
<p>has been shown to be beneficial for wound healing,</p>
<p>acne, skin, eyes.</p>
<p>There are even guys now putting on their testicles</p>
<p>because it can increase testosterone and sperm production.</p>
<p>Yeah, hormone release.</p>
<p>Hormone release.</p>
<p>But in terms of the sauna,</p>
<p>you want that strong heat stimulus.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s when you crawl up to the 200 mark</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m in New York,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also one in San Francisco,</p>
<p>although the one in San Francisco is clothing optional,</p>
<p>just to warn people, there&rsquo;s a place called Archimedes Banya.</p>
<p>Is there any scientific evidence that being naked</p>
<p>is beneficial in the sauna?</p>
<p>Well, in certain contexts,</p>
<p>it leads to childbirth.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I&rsquo;ll have to read up on that.</p>
<p>I read that somewhere.</p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s not required for childbirth,</p>
<p>but in all seriousness,</p>
<p>in New York, I&rsquo;ll go to a place called Spa 88,</p>
<p>and actually, Khabib&rsquo;s picture is on the wall.</p>
<p>He goes there.</p>
<p>And that one, it&rsquo;s clothing.</p>
<p>They require clothing.</p>
<p>I only just say that</p>
<p>because it can be a little bit of a shock to people sometimes</p>
<p>if they kind of walk in there,</p>
<p>a bunch of naked people, the one in San Francisco.</p>
<p>If I go, I&rsquo;m clothed,</p>
<p>mostly because I run into coworkers or things like that.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m sort of more old fashioned in that way,</p>
<p>I suppose.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you like to wear clothes around coworkers?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, in general. Very old fashioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, to me, it just seems like, you know,</p>
<p>just be aware.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, the Banyas have very hot saunas</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re Russian owned.</p>
<p>And in New York, there&rsquo;s one on the Lower East Side,</p>
<p>but the Spa 88 place, they have some saunas</p>
<p>that the moment I get into those,</p>
<p>I have a hard time catching a full breath.</p>
<p>It burns.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a cold dunk that&rsquo;s like a shock.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ve got a sauna, a wet sauna steam room</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little mellower.</p>
<p>So the nice thing about a Banya</p>
<p>is you can kind of find your place.</p>
<p>And then they do the plaza</p>
<p>where they take the eucalyptus leaves</p>
<p>and you can pay someone.</p>
<p>And you basically, you cover your groin</p>
<p>and then they beat you with the leaves.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s supposed to bring the vasculature to the surface.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only done it once.</p>
<p>And frankly, I found it to be a little bit unnerving.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really like the experience,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try and get into a sauna</p>
<p>as often as I possibly can,</p>
<p>which is once or three times per week.</p>
<p>And I try and do the cold exposure shower or immersion,</p>
<p>but early in the day, cause it really wakes you up.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things I&rsquo;ve listened to,</p>
<p>I wish there was a video,</p>
<p>is listening to a bunch of stuff with Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>And he did a thing with Tim Ferriss,</p>
<p>like the Tim Ferriss podcast.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever heard it,</p>
<p>but he forced them to do, they did the podcast in a sauna.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think at the time Tim Ferriss was adapted.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not heat adapted, it can be pretty stressful.</p>
<p>And I mean, obviously the whole experience is stressful</p>
<p>as somebody with microphones, like what is happening?</p>
<p>But I just love that Tim was vulnerable enough</p>
<p>to kind of give themself over</p>
<p>to whatever the hell this experience is.</p>
<p>And I am just so happy that Rick like pushed</p>
<p>that kind of idea and just let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very Rick Rubin kind of thing to do.</p>
<p>And we must, like we must do this, this has to be done.</p>
<p>A podcast that was done from a sauna continuously</p>
<p>would be really interesting.</p>
<p>Like you could call it like the pressure cooker</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean like a regular podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, like you have to sit with your guests in the sauna</p>
<p>or they have to sit in the sauna.</p>
<p>That was one of the interesting things</p>
<p>is it was a sad thing because I believe there&rsquo;s no video</p>
<p>of that podcast, but you could tell there was a kind of,</p>
<p>there was suffering and especially on Tim&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>It was like a degradation.</p>
<p>He started over time not being able</p>
<p>to put words together correctly, which he&rsquo;s very eloquent.</p>
<p>And so you could see there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a struggle.</p>
<p>Heat and cold pull you down from the inside.</p>
<p>You have to, I mean, there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>the screening process for, they call it SEAL training,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really screening and training involves cold waters.</p>
<p>Cause if you&rsquo;re in the heat too long,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll die or damage tissue.</p>
<p>In cold, you can do it quite extensively</p>
<p>before you die or damage tissue, but it is stressful.</p>
<p>I was going to say one thing that I sometimes enjoy seeing</p>
<p>these social media posts where people will get</p>
<p>into the ice bath and they&rsquo;ll look really stoic.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re really tough,</p>
<p>but actually that&rsquo;s the wimpy way to go through it.</p>
<p>When you get into cold water, if you stay very still,</p>
<p>you develop a thermal sheath around you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re warming yourself.</p>
<p>The really bold way is to get in and continue</p>
<p>to sift your arms and legs.</p>
<p>And it ends up feeling miserably colder.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s no sheath</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re breaking up that thermal layer.</p>
<p>And then when you get out, you&rsquo;ll notice a lot</p>
<p>of people huddle or they&rsquo;ll put, or they&rsquo;ll grab the towel.</p>
<p>In general, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get back, I&rsquo;ll get into the sauna.</p>
<p>But if you really want to stimulate the big increases</p>
<p>in metabolism, you stand out there and you dry off</p>
<p>with arms extended in open air.</p>
<p>And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold,</p>
<p>but your body is forced to activate a number</p>
<p>of the warming programs related to metabolism.</p>
<p>This is the beautiful work of a woman named Susanna Soberg,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s Scandinavian.</p>
<p>She published this paper last year in Cell Reports Medicine.</p>
<p>And so I call this the Soberg principle,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re doing ice and heat for whatever reason,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you end on heat or cold,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re using cold specifically</p>
<p>to stimulate an increase in metabolism, end with cold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Soberg principle.</p>
<p>And with cold, if you&rsquo;re alternating,</p>
<p>and then if you want to do it the tough way,</p>
<p>you let the shivering, so you just stand out</p>
<p>and let the water evaporate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if you ever waded into a cold ocean,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s kind of like holding themselves in,</p>
<p>if you really just, if you let yourself extend your limbs</p>
<p>and move them around a bit so you break up</p>
<p>that thermal layer, that&rsquo;s the tough way to do it.</p>
<p>So when I see people on social media getting in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like really tough and trying to look hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, you want to be moving around.</p>
<p>Yeah, smiling, talking, moving around is way, way colder.</p>
<p>Are you able to talk?</p>
<p>Can you do, so you suggest the podcast in the sauna.</p>
<p>How about this?</p>
<p>I proposed this since I got choked.</p>
<p>You want to do the next podcast?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to, so the folks from The Plunge,</p>
<p>maybe you could bring Lex a plunge.</p>
<p>He certainly deserves one.</p>
<p>And we can go side by side coffin style,</p>
<p>or we can face one another when we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Well, we said we should do each other&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;d be next.</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t wait to have you back on.</p>
<p>I mean, we only scratched the surface.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s do at least part of the next</p>
<p>Human Lab podcast either in the.</p>
<p>I have a sauna and a cold plunge, so we could do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we could do.</p>
<p>We do a sauna and a cold plunge version.</p>
<p>I wonder how the recording works,</p>
<p>if the recording. A bit of an echo in the sauna,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure we can take out the reverb.</p>
<p>So Sergey wants to ask you about sex performance.</p>
<p>Very journalistic, very hardcore hitting questions</p>
<p>that we have here on the.</p>
<p>Generally, or a specific.</p>
<p>No, he has a certain problem he needs help with, no.</p>
<p>Generally, you haven&rsquo;t done an episode on sex.</p>
<p>Well, we did an episode early on, on sexual development.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done them on optimizing testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And we touched a little bit on the, on libido</p>
<p>and somewhat on sex performance, but not much.</p>
<p>We did an episode on relationships, love and desire,</p>
<p>where we touched on libido specifically.</p>
<p>So just as a quick mention of something,</p>
<p>a lot of people take SSRIs or antidepressants</p>
<p>that can disrupt sexual function.</p>
<p>There are a few compounds like maca root and punga ali</p>
<p>and things like that, that at least in a few studies</p>
<p>in humans have been shown to offset</p>
<p>some of the sexual side effects.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of sexual, and then the, sorry,</p>
<p>the episode on sexual development was about how the brain</p>
<p>and body become organized in certain ways,</p>
<p>how the brain becomes organized if you have X chromosomes</p>
<p>or Y chromosomes or et cetera.</p>
<p>So early, early development.</p>
<p>Early development mainly.</p>
<p>And the effects of hormones later on that template.</p>
<p>We will be doing a, I&rsquo;m actually putting together a series</p>
<p>on sexual health, everything from the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>which both men and women should understand, of course,</p>
<p>understanding arousal, understanding, for instance,</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but that orgasm is actually the consequence of activity</p>
<p>in the sympathetic, meaning the stress arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>Whereas arousal is the consequence of the activity</p>
<p>of the parasympathetic, the calming aspect</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s counterintuitive, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s counterintuitive and it kind of works like a seesaw.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s arousal, then there&rsquo;s relaxation,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s arousal, and then immediately after orgasm</p>
<p>and in males ejaculation, what ends up happening</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a rebounding of the parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>which it leads to oftentimes people feeling very relaxed</p>
<p>or falling asleep.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to do a short series on sexual health</p>
<p>that will include stuff about sexual performance,</p>
<p>but also some, I&rsquo;m working on getting an expert guest</p>
<p>who can talk about some of the neurologic changes</p>
<p>that happen as a consequence of sexual activity.</p>
<p>And we did an episode with a guy from UT Austin here,</p>
<p>David Buss, who&rsquo;s an evolutionary psychologist,</p>
<p>talking about, it went pretty deep into some of the typical</p>
<p>and unusual dynamics of mating relation,</p>
<p>whether or not people have kids or not and what impacts that,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to do an episode on menopause, andropause.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s very surprising is I get a lot of questions</p>
<p>about sexual health from the young male audience,</p>
<p>which tells me that, well, here&rsquo;s what I think it reflects.</p>
<p>I think that women, because of their menstrual cycles,</p>
<p>early on start to talk to one another about changes</p>
<p>in physiology and psychology as a function</p>
<p>of this 28 day cycle that they all experience</p>
<p>sooner or later.</p>
<p>Males, there&rsquo;s less of a conversation</p>
<p>and it usually arrives in code.</p>
<p>People will say, hey, what should I take</p>
<p>to increase my testosterone?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say, well, maybe nothing.</p>
<p>You know, what are you specifically concerned about?</p>
<p>And then over time, if you pull on those threads</p>
<p>a little bit, you know, you get your answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll just get a direct question.</p>
<p>But I think that the psychology of all this</p>
<p>and in terms of jealousy and the terms of notions</p>
<p>of roles and relationships is very dynamic right now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fascinated by this.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to do a four episode series.</p>
<p>What about sexual fantasy?</p>
<p>What, to get Freudian for a second,</p>
<p>what role does sexual fantasy have in the human condition?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book called The Erotic Imagination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very psychoanalytic book written</p>
<p>by a psychoanalyst that talks about how,</p>
<p>well, here&rsquo;s the uncomfortable reality.</p>
<p>Freud was at least right about one thing,</p>
<p>which is that the brain circuitry that you used</p>
<p>to develop attachments to your caregivers,</p>
<p>mother and father or other caregivers,</p>
<p>do not disappear when you hit puberty.</p>
<p>They are repurposed for romantic and sexual relations.</p>
<p>And so this is why the whole notion of anxious attached</p>
<p>and secure attached, you know, stems from childhood</p>
<p>attachment patterns, but it carries over</p>
<p>to romantic relationships.</p>
<p>So that the relationship with your mother has.</p>
<p>And father.</p>
<p>And father has a, and probably other close people to you</p>
<p>in your young age has a secondary, tertiary,</p>
<p>some kind of ripple effect on how your sexuality developed.</p>
<p>Like what fantasies you might have, all that.</p>
<p>No, without question.</p>
<p>And of course, early experiences too,</p>
<p>and traumatic or positive or neutral.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s really important to remember though,</p>
<p>in this transfer of circuitry from one role to another</p>
<p>is that, and it&rsquo;s certainly consistent with psychoanalysis</p>
<p>that gender is interchangeable, sex is interchangeable.</p>
<p>So for instance, let&rsquo;s say you had a wonderful relationship.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say this, let&rsquo;s take a hypothetical person, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m truly not referring to myself.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a young woman who has a wonderful relationship</p>
<p>with her father and a just absolutely terrible</p>
<p>abusive relationship to her mother.</p>
<p>Just for sake of example.</p>
<p>She then goes into adulthood and she is drawn</p>
<p>to very abusive men.</p>
<p>Not always, but let&rsquo;s just use in this example.</p>
<p>And the dynamic is exactly the same</p>
<p>as the dynamic she had with her mother.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Even though in this context, she&rsquo;s heterosexual,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s romantically attracted to men.</p>
<p>What is seen over and over again is that the dynamic</p>
<p>with one parent can be transferred onto a romantic dynamic,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be, you know,</p>
<p>that if it was with the mother,</p>
<p>then it only has to do with relationships to women.</p>
<p>So gender is interchangeable</p>
<p>because these circuitries are presexual.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re laid down in our brain</p>
<p>before the brain has any concept of sexual interactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s preverbal, excuse me.</p>
<p>And so there are a lot of interesting examples</p>
<p>and data to support this.</p>
<p>The book Attached is a pretty interesting book</p>
<p>by two psychologists.</p>
<p>One I think is at Columbia University</p>
<p>that talks about how childhood dynamics carry over</p>
<p>to adult romantic attachment.</p>
<p>So as you can tell, I get pretty alert</p>
<p>in response to these questions.</p>
<p>I get a lot of them relate in this domain.</p>
<p>They have a lot of impact on people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wondering about, they wanna learn.</p>
<p>And no one knows what other people are doing</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>We kind of know deviancy.</p>
<p>We know perversion.</p>
<p>We know the extremes.</p>
<p>We know the rules.</p>
<p>Hopefully people know the rules,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just be,</p>
<p>there are a lot of people in the academic community,</p>
<p>in particular at certain East Coast schools not to be named</p>
<p>that are in open relationships.</p>
<p>This is more common now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very common, but it&rsquo;s more common.</p>
<p>And obviously that&rsquo;s a way of bypassing</p>
<p>some of these more primitive emotions</p>
<p>about jealousy, et cetera,</p>
<p>and leveraging them towards</p>
<p>maybe even ongoing relationships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not passing judgment one way or the other.</p>
<p>I always say four conditions have to be met</p>
<p>for any discussion about sex and sexuality</p>
<p>or sexual health.</p>
<p>Age appropriate, context appropriate,</p>
<p>consensual and species appropriate.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s weird because the thing I&rsquo;m trying to figure out</p>
<p>is why my sexual fantasy is to go to furry orgies</p>
<p>and have sex with others dressed as squirrels</p>
<p>and me, the other animals.</p>
<p>So that could be, I&rsquo;ll see a therapist about that one.</p>
<p>Can I ask you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna respond to that except to say that</p>
<p>as long as those four conditions are met.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Consensual, age appropriate,</p>
<p>context appropriate, species appropriate.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions on Instagram.</p>
<p>One of them on this topic, on relationships,</p>
<p>somebody suggested to do a part three of why Lex is single.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a running joke about this.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But I can answer it in part, right?</p>
<p>Because, well, partially because you&rsquo;re very busy,</p>
<p>partially because you&rsquo;ve decided that until it&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna wait until it&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;s time, right?</p>
<p>I mean, until it&rsquo;s time, you&rsquo;re waiting.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, not saving yourself for marriage,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, but in some sense,</p>
<p>yeah, your future wife is out there.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s being programmed.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I definitely believe that.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, I just love people</p>
<p>and I fall in love very easily with people,</p>
<p>with objects, with things, with life, with every moment.</p>
<p>And that way you&rsquo;re like Oliver Sacks,</p>
<p>he would fall in love with minerals</p>
<p>and concepts and things like that.</p>
<p>And so like to me, this kind of,</p>
<p>so relationship is more like a commitment</p>
<p>to one particular kind of object of your love.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s almost like a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a journey that you take on together</p>
<p>because also the interesting thing about humans</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re moment by moment a different person,</p>
<p>day by day, week by week, month by month,</p>
<p>they change, they evolve.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ups and downs and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m going to explore all the ways</p>
<p>that this human gets morphed and changed</p>
<p>and what makes them cry, what makes them excited,</p>
<p>what makes them lonely, like the habits,</p>
<p>like when they form certain habits,</p>
<p>how they feel when those habits are broken,</p>
<p>like the stupid minute things that make everyday life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be on that journey together</p>
<p>figuring that out, just the way we&rsquo;re trying to figure</p>
<p>ourselves out when we&rsquo;re like optimizing these things</p>
<p>about diet and health and so on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of doing this computation together</p>
<p>because neither person really understands themselves</p>
<p>at all and you&rsquo;re together both confused about each other</p>
<p>and you get to almost like a relationship is a chance</p>
<p>to understand yourself and to understand another person,</p>
<p>like together, that process is somewhat iterative.</p>
<p>You know the dynamics, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re merging two nervous systems.</p>
<p>This was once described to me very well by an ex girlfriend</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s truly brilliant, she&rsquo;s really brilliant.</p>
<p>She said, you know, there&rsquo;s four arrows.</p>
<p>This is maybe to an engineer or like a, so it makes sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s how you feel towards the other person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s how they feel towards you,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s an arrow that comes back to you,</p>
<p>which is how you feel about how they feel.</p>
<p>And then they have an arrow of how they feel</p>
<p>about how you feel, right?</p>
<p>This is why if someone else is moody</p>
<p>or somebody else is upset,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one version of ourselves where we respond to that</p>
<p>or they respond to us,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another version where we respond to that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s a processing of what it means for us</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re behaving that way or feeling that way.</p>
<p>And this again leads us back</p>
<p>to that early attachment circuitry</p>
<p>because if a parent was stressed,</p>
<p>the child&rsquo;s role is not to soothe the parent.</p>
<p>In fact, healthy models of parenting say</p>
<p>that children shouldn&rsquo;t actually know how their parents feel</p>
<p>for like the first eight years of their life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not supposed to be in that mindset</p>
<p>of empathizing for the parent.</p>
<p>This is often not the case,</p>
<p>but maybe the cutoff isn&rsquo;t exactly eight,</p>
<p>but you get the idea.</p>
<p>So the dynamics of relationship are where the learning is</p>
<p>because we learn how we react to other people reacting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a two arrow system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at least this four arrow thing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the element of nurturing, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that going through life with somebody</p>
<p>is so much better than going through it alone.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d never thought I&rsquo;d make that statement.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t always obvious to you?</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t always obvious to me.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed wonderful relationships</p>
<p>and some have been hard</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s certainly been a lot of growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on good terms with almost all my former girlfriends</p>
<p>and close with some enough that I know their spouses</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m close with their families.</p>
<p>But no, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think that when people say relationship is hard,</p>
<p>the only really hard part of a good relationship</p>
<p>is just dealing with oneself</p>
<p>and making sure that you&rsquo;re staying</p>
<p>in that mode of caretaking.</p>
<p>Because I do believe that if one is mainly focused</p>
<p>on taking good care of the other person,</p>
<p>provided they&rsquo;re also focused on taking good care of you,</p>
<p>to some extent, and we&rsquo;re good at taking care of ourselves,</p>
<p>everybody flourishes, everything gets better.</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t think I experienced that</p>
<p>until fairly recently.</p>
<p>What do you think is the secret</p>
<p>to a successful relationship?</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t just one, but at least in the top five</p>
<p>is master or at least be good at autonomic self regulation.</p>
<p>Be good at autonomic self regulation.</p>
<p>Know how to calm yourself down.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect the, like looking to anything external</p>
<p>to soothe yourself is it puts you in a terrible position</p>
<p>to be a caretaker of yourself and other people, right?</p>
<p>So learn how to self soothe, right?</p>
<p>Learn how to calm your mind, steady your actions,</p>
<p>steady your voice.</p>
<p>There are tools to do that.</p>
<p>We talk about on the podcast, but elsewhere,</p>
<p>have that in place.</p>
<p>I also think that if your main focus is on,</p>
<p>you want to have a good boundaries, et cetera,</p>
<p>but on tending to the relationship,</p>
<p>doing a little bit more than you think you ought to do,</p>
<p>if everyone does that, it goes great.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sometimes so positively struck</p>
<p>by how supported I feel because for many years,</p>
<p>I was just kind of doing everything on my own.</p>
<p>So any little thing, I&rsquo;m like, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>this feels huge.</p>
<p>And also I think the dynamics have to be right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be really honest.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of a tricky topic,</p>
<p>but there is a power dynamic in relationships.</p>
<p>Sometimes, not all, but in some relationships,</p>
<p>it works much better if one person leads</p>
<p>and the other person follows.</p>
<p>In other relationships, it&rsquo;s more mutuality, works best.</p>
<p>People need to know what they need.</p>
<p>And so knowing what you need and what you crave</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>And then once you do that,</p>
<p>you can create the relationship you want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that over and over again.</p>
<p>And people are different.</p>
<p>But I think that ultimately, I mean, right,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the dopamine phase of a relationship.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the serotonin phase,</p>
<p>the kind of more mutuality, coziness and sweetness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book about how to make sure</p>
<p>that the dopamine component and the serotonin component,</p>
<p>so to speak, go on forever.</p>
<p>And it has to do with, you know,</p>
<p>when you first meet someone and you&rsquo;re attracted to them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially objectifying them,</p>
<p>meaning not in the way people might think,</p>
<p>you are not dependent on them</p>
<p>for emotional stability or survival.</p>
<p>As you get close to somebody,</p>
<p>you really come to depend on them</p>
<p>and then you tend to objectify them less.</p>
<p>And so this book, the name is kind of corny,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s written by an analyst again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Can Love Last?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a book about how really good, strong relationships</p>
<p>are the consequence of people constantly moving</p>
<p>through this dependency objectification dynamic.</p>
<p>And I use those words in the psychological sense,</p>
<p>not in the way they&rsquo;re typically thrown around nowadays.</p>
<p>So in some cultures,</p>
<p>men and women will only touch</p>
<p>for two weeks out of the month.</p>
<p>And then for the other two weeks,</p>
<p>the excitement and the sensuality and all,</p>
<p>and the sexuality is very heightened.</p>
<p>And then they go back to this kind of distancing.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s feasible for most people,</p>
<p>but if you look statistically,</p>
<p>those relationships tend to last a very long time</p>
<p>with at least reported mutual feelings</p>
<p>of intense attraction for many, many, many decades.</p>
<p>So human beings need to learn how to at least understand</p>
<p>and control these dynamics.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of divorce, there&rsquo;s a lot of cheating,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be great if people could resolve some of this stuff</p>
<p>inside of the relationship, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this kind of intense attraction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually one of the poems</p>
<p>that Karl Deisseroth introduced me to.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Two English Poems is the name.</p>
<p>But one of the things I find myself</p>
<p>for prolonged periods being attracted to</p>
<p>is you notice some kind of magic</p>
<p>and you keep wanting to dig to the depths of that magic.</p>
<p>You need to really know that person.</p>
<p>To really know a person deeply, yeah.</p>
<p>You notice something early on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is,</p>
<p>but you just notice something special</p>
<p>and you want to keep pulling at that thread</p>
<p>and you never really do.</p>
<p>Well, you also have to be careful.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions from guys.</p>
<p>You have to be careful the questions you ask</p>
<p>in a relationship too.</p>
<p>You have to make sure you really want that information.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about people&rsquo;s past, right?</p>
<p>If you ask somebody how they really feel</p>
<p>about something about you and they tell you,</p>
<p>that may be soothing.</p>
<p>It may be intensely stressful.</p>
<p>You have to be, here&rsquo;s one thing I know for sure.</p>
<p>For a relationship to work, you have to be brave.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go in there fully protected.</p>
<p>And yet you also can&rsquo;t go in there with no boundaries</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll end up beat up.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that quote?</p>
<p>If you want to be a warrior, prepare to get hurt.</p>
<p>If you want to be an explorer, prepare to get lost.</p>
<p>And if you want to be both, you know,</p>
<p>if you become a lover, prepare to be both or something.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>I forget, this is one of these Instagram type things</p>
<p>that you see passing by and you go, oh, that&rsquo;s pretty true.</p>
<p>Love is scary because it takes us back</p>
<p>to that primitive circuitry that is as primitive</p>
<p>and basic as hunger, thirst, the desire for heat</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re cold, the desire for cold when we&rsquo;re overly warm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s Dynorphin.</p>
<p>I mean, when somebody leaves, like the, you know,</p>
<p>when somebody you are attached to leaves by death</p>
<p>or by decision or you&rsquo;re forced apart,</p>
<p>the Dynorphin release is massive.</p>
<p>It is true discomfort.</p>
<p>People feel anxiety and discomfort.</p>
<p>And moving through that is a hell of a process.</p>
<p>I mean, if I knew how to best break up</p>
<p>at a neurological level,</p>
<p>or if you could just plug yourself into a wall and reset,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d do that episode tomorrow,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have that knowledge.</p>
<p>Come on, I think we&rsquo;ve covered this before</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s even been memeified.</p>
<p>I think losing love is part of the magic of love.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;ve felt something.</p>
<p>I agree, but at some point,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;ve done it enough times,</p>
<p>you know, life is finite, you know.</p>
<p>It is beautiful to see these couples</p>
<p>that seem very much in love despite many years,</p>
<p>despite having been together many years.</p>
<p>Yeah, the way they look at each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>They still see the magic.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;ll say, we got lucky</p>
<p>or it was, it&rsquo;s been hard or this and that.</p>
<p>I think external conditions being a little tougher</p>
<p>is helpful for a couple.</p>
<p>Hardship.</p>
<p>I do, I do, because I think that you rally, you know,</p>
<p>and you bond with people, you know,</p>
<p>obviously you want to survive those conditions,</p>
<p>but yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I think that it helps.</p>
<p>Bonnie and Clyde.</p>
<p>So any.</p>
<p>Well, they were a little.</p>
<p>Oh, a little too much.</p>
<p>Well, a little too much.</p>
<p>They were sociopaths, but the,</p>
<p>well, when two sociopaths find one.</p>
<p>Love can make you do crazy things.</p>
<p>Normally, it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>normally sociopaths don&rsquo;t team up</p>
<p>because they manipulate each other.</p>
<p>Sociopaths sadly are usually only interested</p>
<p>in manipulating the highly pliable or unsuspecting,</p>
<p>but when romantic attraction is woven in,</p>
<p>then it gets really diabolical.</p>
<p>Any advice on finding the love of your life, of my life?</p>
<p>This is, why Lexus single response?</p>
<p>Why, any advice?</p>
<p>Yeah, actually this comes from a friend of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in a really excellent marriage</p>
<p>with great kids and family and high demand life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decision.</p>
<p>Like at some point you just prioritize it as,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m going to make this happen one way or another.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t force the discovery of that person.</p>
<p>But I mean, I&rsquo;ve occasionally said,</p>
<p>hey, I think you should meet this person or that person.</p>
<p>And well, it wasn&rsquo;t, maybe my judgment</p>
<p>might&rsquo;ve been off, but the timing wasn&rsquo;t right or something.</p>
<p>But I think that, yeah, it&rsquo;s a decision.</p>
<p>And it also has to do with life structure.</p>
<p>I mean, there were years.</p>
<p>So when I was in graduate school,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want a girlfriend.</p>
<p>I just wanted to be in lab.</p>
<p>And I, sure I had romantic dating interests,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t going to meet them through a committed,</p>
<p>live together situation.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t where I was at.</p>
<p>And as a postdoc, things were a little different,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, but at some point it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>what do I want my daily routine to look like?</p>
<p>Because ultimately a relationship, however one structures,</p>
<p>is going to be part of your daily routine.</p>
<p>So at the point where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really love to wake up next to somebody</p>
<p>and do blank and blank together.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d love to work and then we meet for dinner.</p>
<p>And then we take the dog for a walk or take kids out</p>
<p>or whatever it happens to be, take a trip.</p>
<p>You have to be, one has to be in the mindset</p>
<p>of wanting to do couple like things.</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t think about it that way.</p>
<p>They either fall into something</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t see the benefits of coupling up.</p>
<p>I think that the pandemic tuned people&rsquo;s awareness</p>
<p>to the fact that some things are indeed easier on your own,</p>
<p>depends on finances, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But a lot of things are made better done with other people.</p>
<p>100%, but I also, so I was very deliberately,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting way to put it,</p>
<p>but what do you want your day to look like?</p>
<p>I think what do you want your day to look like?</p>
<p>What do you want your life to be?</p>
<p>I was very deliberately always, first of all,</p>
<p>happy to be alone, like a conscious thinking.</p>
<p>I know a lot of friends were just unable to be alone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to be alone, but I&rsquo;m much happier</p>
<p>with another person.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m able to share joy with other humans.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day that our kids are rolling jiu jitsu</p>
<p>and my kids are hanging out with your kids.</p>
<p>And if that notion sounds even remotely interesting</p>
<p>and fun, then it&rsquo;s sort of like you kind of backpedal</p>
<p>from that and you go, well, it has to happen.</p>
<p>How do you get to reverse engineer</p>
<p>and think from first principles about love?</p>
<p>Andrew, thank you for being my friend.</p>
<p>Thank you for being an amazing human being</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s so inspiring to so many people for constantly.</p>
<p>I told this to Carl, like one of the things</p>
<p>that was really refreshing about you is that</p>
<p>when I tell you an idea and I tell you a thought,</p>
<p>when I tell you something,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t shut it down as a first step.</p>
<p>I was saying that that&rsquo;s common in the scientific community.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s common in people around you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing what&rsquo;s the goal there.</p>
<p>You get excited, get excited together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you can really have a great friendship</p>
<p>and do great stuff together.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m deeply grateful for that.</p>
<p>And just for connecting so many interesting people together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing an amazing job, man.</p>
<p>And thank you for existing.</p>
<p>Thank you for being you.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>And next time I&rsquo;ll see you in the sauna and ice bath.</p>
<p>Well, I wanna say several things.</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for having me on again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor and a pleasure.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say that formally, I really truly mean it.</p>
<p>I only, the Huberman Lab Podcast, as I always say,</p>
<p>only exists because you gave me the suggestion</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so grateful that you did.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>And for doing what you do, like you are brave</p>
<p>and you were first man in</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just continuing to do it.</p>
<p>As my postdoc advisor used to say,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re doing, just keep going.</p>
<p>And then in terms of our friendship,</p>
<p>I mean, I think you know, and if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just keep telling you anyway,</p>
<p>by texting in person, you&rsquo;re an amazing friend.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s deep trust, there&rsquo;s immense respect</p>
<p>and I love you, brother.</p>
<p>I love you too, man.</p>
<p>We did it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>
<p>It is one of the blessings of old friends.</p>
<p>You can afford to be stupid with them.</p>
<p>I look forward to doing just that</p>
<p>in the many years to come</p>
<p>of friendship and fun conversations with Andrew.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
