    <p>Wait, that&rsquo;s not even a sweater, that&rsquo;s a sweatshirt.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even cashmere.</p>
<p>It looks like polyester or something.</p>
<p>Okay, quick, Freebrook, come on the video</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re wearing the same thing as J. Cal</p>
<p>so we can make a quick joke and bring it in.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Morons.</p>
<p>I mean, you guys are so predictably dumb, the two of you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so itchy.</p>
<p>Do you have a rash?</p>
<p>Jason made me buy this outfit and I put it on</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like itching, I&rsquo;m about to take this thing off.</p>
<p>Polyester, wool, polyurethane, what&rsquo;s that made out of?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Brain man, David Satterthwaite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And it said, we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody, welcome back to the All In Pod,</p>
<p>episode 87, here we go.</p>
<p>Tons of news going on.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the great feedback on episode 86.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna start with emerging markets.</p>
<p>Oh, and yeah, welcome to the program,</p>
<p>David Freeberg, Sultan of Science.</p>
<p>The dictator himself from his palace in Sri Lanka,</p>
<p>his new palace in Sri Lanka,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll be taking over over there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into that.</p>
<p>And Sachs is in witness protection right now, apparently.</p>
<p>Where are you, Sachs, in this white nondescript room?</p>
<p>Can you say where you are?</p>
<p>This is my soundproof padded room.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh, is that what if, that&rsquo;s what if Biden&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>your Biden derangement syndrome,</p>
<p>they put you in an asylum?</p>
<p>What do you do, you rock back and forth</p>
<p>and say inflation Ukraine, inflation Ukraine?</p>
<p>No, we just had the room soundproof</p>
<p>for better podcasting.</p>
<p>Oh, look at you taking the job seriously.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say it looks bad, I think it looks good.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can put a little art behind you or something.</p>
<p>Just put one of your Monet&rsquo;s behind you.</p>
<p>You know, the ones you have in storage downstairs.</p>
<p>Okay, emerging markets are facing</p>
<p>some huge challenges right now.</p>
<p>Quick primer on three types of markets,</p>
<p>developed, emerging, and the frontier market,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Developed markets are considered US, Japan, Europe.</p>
<p>Their GDP growth is lower, single digits typically.</p>
<p>In the emerging market, it&rsquo;s roughly defined</p>
<p>as developing but not fully developed.</p>
<p>That includes countries like the BRICS,</p>
<p>which is Brazil, Russia, India, China,</p>
<p>and recently added South Africa.</p>
<p>Many other markets are included in that.</p>
<p>They were previously called the third world in the 80s.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t like that term.</p>
<p>Investors will bet on them having a higher GDP growth,</p>
<p>typically two times or three times</p>
<p>what the developed world has.</p>
<p>China, for example, 2019, 6% growth.</p>
<p>US in 2019, 2.1% growth.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s frontier markets.</p>
<p>These are viewed as small, unstable, illiquid,</p>
<p>generally risky.</p>
<p>If you look at something like Kenya, Vietnam,</p>
<p>those would fall into that category.</p>
<p>Vietnam, 7%, GDP growth in 2019 to the US is 2%.</p>
<p>Sometimes people like to make bets on them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a nice little chart for y&rsquo;all to look at,</p>
<p>and you can just see China versus Vietnam</p>
<p>in the United States since the 80s.</p>
<p>And so why is this all important?</p>
<p>Well, the Wall Street Journal reported last week</p>
<p>that EMs, the emerging markets,</p>
<p>have been feeling massive pressure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to Sri Lanka in a moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a frontier market, to be clear.</p>
<p>But three things, well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got probably a half dozen things going on.</p>
<p>Let me just highlight maybe the top five,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll hand it off to the besties.</p>
<p>You have high bond and loan yields.</p>
<p>The debts, debt rates are increasing</p>
<p>in the emerging markets and frontier markets.</p>
<p>Think what happens when you got a variable mortgage</p>
<p>or you try to get a new market, a new mortgage.</p>
<p>In the developing markets,</p>
<p>the developing market investors</p>
<p>have stopped investing in emerging markets</p>
<p>and frontier markets, as you might suspect</p>
<p>during a downturn,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re even pulling money out.</p>
<p>Then you have surging inflation.</p>
<p>We all know about that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna talk about inflation here in the US</p>
<p>because we got the print this morning.</p>
<p>And slowing growth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also talked about this</p>
<p>for the last six months on the program.</p>
<p>All these problems get exacerbated</p>
<p>when economic growth slows and it&rsquo;s slowing globally.</p>
<p>And then finally,</p>
<p>we have the potential issue of contagion.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>when various countries are facing these challenges,</p>
<p>although we did tell you here</p>
<p>what would happen with the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Shout out to Sachs and Freebird fertilizer,</p>
<p>wheat oil, all that good stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s becoming very acute.</p>
<p>Perhaps the canary in the coal mine is Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Breaking news, President Rajapaksha fled for the Maldives,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a state of emergency.</p>
<p>Curfews were declared.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s been canceled as of the taping of this.</p>
<p>We can get into the state of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Your thoughts, Friedberg?</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve been chomping at the bit to discuss this.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a good long intro.</p>
<p>I think, you know, the high level for me,</p>
<p>if you look kind of at debt markets around the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about $300 trillion of global debt.</p>
<p>And I put this chart in the chat here, Nick,</p>
<p>you can put it on the video.</p>
<p>And about 100 trillion of that debt globally</p>
<p>is in emerging markets.</p>
<p>And so these countries generally have, you know,</p>
<p>much more kind of variable GDP growth,</p>
<p>as well as challenges ultimately with their currencies.</p>
<p>Most of this debt recently,</p>
<p>and this has been a trend for a number of years lately,</p>
<p>has been issued in their local currency</p>
<p>rather than in US dollars.</p>
<p>And so as the currency devalues,</p>
<p>it becomes more challenging for an investor</p>
<p>to make a return if they&rsquo;re investing</p>
<p>from a US dollar denominated base</p>
<p>or some other dollar denominated base.</p>
<p>So look, the EM, the emerging markets are heavily saddled.</p>
<p>I mean, some of these countries have over, you know,</p>
<p>300% or 250% debt to GDP.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really gone on recently</p>
<p>is that many of them as net importers of energy and food</p>
<p>are gonna struggle to make the stuff</p>
<p>they need to make at home or to feed their people at home</p>
<p>because of the rising inflation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been happening around the world</p>
<p>from the producers of those goods and services, those goods.</p>
<p>And so to import those goods is more expensive.</p>
<p>That makes it more challenging</p>
<p>for people to be able to afford food,</p>
<p>to be able to afford energy.</p>
<p>This is part of what we&rsquo;re seeing happening in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s compounding this is we have rising inflation</p>
<p>in the US, so as we&rsquo;ve been talking about a lot,</p>
<p>the Fed&rsquo;s been raising interest rates here in the US,</p>
<p>which means that you can now buy treasuries that yield 3%.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an investor around the world,</p>
<p>where else are you gonna put your money</p>
<p>except US treasuries in a market like this?</p>
<p>You wanna buy 3% yield in US dollars</p>
<p>versus, you know, getting 10% yield</p>
<p>in, you know, some currency denominated account,</p>
<p>some currency denominated bond in a country</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really know well or trust</p>
<p>as much as the United States.</p>
<p>And so as a result, a lot of dollars</p>
<p>are moving out of emerging market debt into US debt,</p>
<p>and the price of that debt has collapsed.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve seen in the last couple of months</p>
<p>a decline of emerging market debt of about 20%.</p>
<p>This makes it harder for those countries</p>
<p>to issue new debt to fund things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s creating this really challenging spiral</p>
<p>that may ultimately lead to defaults.</p>
<p>Those defaults absolutely have a trickling effect,</p>
<p>because if one country starts to default</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re an investor in emerging market debt,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna say, hey, wait a second,</p>
<p>I just took a huge loss in this position,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna start to sell off other emerging market debt.</p>
<p>And then it becomes harder for those countries</p>
<p>to raise more debt and fund themselves,</p>
<p>and it can cause a cataclysmic spiral.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s a really scary scenario</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re wading into now, and I think we really hope</p>
<p>that the US starts to taper interest rates</p>
<p>and we find some stability in these markets</p>
<p>over the next couple of months,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just a food and energy crisis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a humanitarian crisis,</p>
<p>and ultimately could lead to a global financial crisis.</p>
<p>And in fact, the bond issuance is-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly complex, but it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that folks are tracking very closely here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening also is the companies</p>
<p>that were already at risk are going to</p>
<p>start feeling this impact.</p>
<p>We could jump into Sri Lanka if we want.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has, I think, a bunch of short-term issues</p>
<p>and a couple of very long-term issues.</p>
<p>Let me set the backdrop,</p>
<p>because I think this is really interesting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take, let&rsquo;s study Sri Lanka</p>
<p>through the lens of two other countries,</p>
<p>Jamaica and Singapore.</p>
<p>If you go all the way back to 1960,</p>
<p>so roughly when Singapore became a nation,</p>
<p>the Jamaican population in 1960 was 1.6 million people.</p>
<p>The Singaporean population was 1.6 million people.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&rsquo;s population was 9.8 million.</p>
<p>Jamaica&rsquo;s GDP was 700 million.</p>
<p>Singapore&rsquo;s GDP was 700 million.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&rsquo;s was 1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Now you fast forward to 2022,</p>
<p>Jamaica&rsquo;s GDP is about 13 billion.</p>
<p>Singapore&rsquo;s GDP has grown to about 360 billion.</p>
<p>And Sri Lanka&rsquo;s GDP is 80 billion.</p>
<p>So what did Singapore do right?</p>
<p>What did Jamaica kind of get right?</p>
<p>Because one of the things that they kept in check</p>
<p>was their population,</p>
<p>even though their GDP didn&rsquo;t expand that much,</p>
<p>so per capita income was still quite healthy.</p>
<p>And then what did Sri Lanka get right</p>
<p>and what did Sri Lanka get wrong?</p>
<p>Well, some of the things when you look at Singapore</p>
<p>is that they found a way to embrace,</p>
<p>despite a very heterogeneous culture</p>
<p>and sets of religions inside of that entity,</p>
<p>inside that city state,</p>
<p>they found a way to promote multiculturalism,</p>
<p>yet also promote English as the lingua franca.</p>
<p>Why was that small thing so important?</p>
<p>Because it allowed them to be a hub</p>
<p>for the rest of the world</p>
<p>in a way that many, many other countries couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>The second thing that they had</p>
<p>was a very low level of corruption</p>
<p>because they had a leader in that case, Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
<p>And again, some people in the West</p>
<p>will paint it as slightly authoritarian.</p>
<p>He would paint it as Asian values,</p>
<p>but the net result of it was very low levels of corruption,</p>
<p>a small but highly effective public service</p>
<p>and meaningful investments in education and healthcare</p>
<p>to make that country grow over decades.</p>
<p>And within a generation,</p>
<p>that country completely exceeded all expectations.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka struggled through a civil war.</p>
<p>I was a by-product of that civil war.</p>
<p>It was partly religious, it was partly ethnic,</p>
<p>and it was 20 plus years in the making and in the happening.</p>
<p>And it took a very right-wing autocratic leader,</p>
<p>the brother of the current deposed president,</p>
<p>to basically root it out.</p>
<p>Now, in order to root it out,</p>
<p>there were enormous amounts of war crimes</p>
<p>and all kinds of things</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think anybody would support,</p>
<p>except it brought some amount of stability.</p>
<p>And so then you would have thought,</p>
<p>okay, maybe this is the point</p>
<p>at which you can now really start to grow.</p>
<p>But these guys, yet again, found a way to navel gaze</p>
<p>and just to infuse so much corruption and graft</p>
<p>inside of how the government was run.</p>
<p>By the way, and it wasn&rsquo;t just the right,</p>
<p>it was also the left.</p>
<p>They spent two and a half times more on defense</p>
<p>as of last year than they did when they were in wartime.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.</p>
<p>The public service grew to the largest it ever did</p>
<p>in a moment where, you know,</p>
<p>you really should have prioritized private enterprise.</p>
<p>So all of these things sort of created a situation</p>
<p>where they fundamentally didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing.</p>
<p>So the other two issues there, I think,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a great summary of like really</p>
<p>those frontier countries and what made them emerge.</p>
<p>Singapore also has a great strategic location,</p>
<p>which Sri Lanka kind of shares.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both island countries strategically located</p>
<p>for trade.</p>
<p>And then I guess the policies, right?</p>
<p>Singapore went on a very, very aggressive tax</p>
<p>and business policy effort.</p>
<p>Did Sri Lanka do that as well?</p>
<p>And then maybe you could speak to just how important</p>
<p>those are as islands, you know, and their geography.</p>
<p>Because Jamaica doesn&rsquo;t obviously have that.</p>
<p>I mean, Sri Lanka has this massive growing importance</p>
<p>as China has emerged.</p>
<p>The problem in these last few years</p>
<p>is that they did everything possible</p>
<p>to not just alienate China, but to alienate everybody</p>
<p>on every dimension possible.</p>
<p>You know, they alienated China.</p>
<p>The coup de gras was that there was an enormous shipment</p>
<p>of fertilizer, chemical fertilizer,</p>
<p>that was sent to the ports.</p>
<p>And it was summarily rejected and turned around</p>
<p>because somewhere along the way,</p>
<p>the leadership in Sri Lanka decided that they were woke.</p>
<p>And so they enforced every farmer to go organic.</p>
<p>The problem with going organic and organic fertilizer</p>
<p>was all of the small farms shut down.</p>
<p>All of the large farms had 20 to 30% crop yield reductions.</p>
<p>The prices of food went crazy.</p>
<p>They reversed policies two or three times.</p>
<p>And really what they found is that, you know,</p>
<p>they tried to go woke.</p>
<p>Instead, they went broke.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, all these other countries</p>
<p>who were there trying to help said,</p>
<p>wait, what is going on here?</p>
<p>So they offended China.</p>
<p>They offended the Middle Easterners.</p>
<p>They offended the Japanese by cutting a light rail project</p>
<p>that Japan wanted to fund.</p>
<p>I mean, in every step of the way-</p>
<p>They de-industrialized.</p>
<p>This country found a way, they didn&rsquo;t de-industrialize.</p>
<p>They tried to follow this woke agenda.</p>
<p>That is de-industrialization.</p>
<p>I mean, reversing from like the modern techniques</p>
<p>of industrial production, like fertilizer</p>
<p>and modern systems of farming is de-industrialization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be a curse ultimately.</p>
<p>Saks, to your point, we just discussed this last week</p>
<p>with the farmers.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re in a frontier market,</p>
<p>trying to adopt the regulations and the strategic goals</p>
<p>for the environment of the emerging market</p>
<p>is like two giant hops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably insurmountable.</p>
<p>Well, look, there&rsquo;s a strong analogy</p>
<p>between the populist uprising that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the Netherlands with the Dutch farmers</p>
<p>and the populist uprising that&rsquo;s happening in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Basically, they&rsquo;re implementing the same policies.</p>
<p>This is that Sri Lanka is further down the road</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a poor country to begin with.</p>
<p>So, you know, like Chamath mentioned,</p>
<p>in April of last year, the Sri Lankan government</p>
<p>banned the importation of chemical fertilizers</p>
<p>and pesticides used in farmings.</p>
<p>They, again, went with this idea</p>
<p>they thought they could encourage organic farming.</p>
<p>So the result of that was that overall production,</p>
<p>agricultural production fell by a third</p>
<p>and rice production fell by 43%.</p>
<p>And rice is, you know, the biggest staple in the country.</p>
<p>So now you got people there starving or going hungry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got massive food insecurity</p>
<p>as well as the whole economy basically has been crippled.</p>
<p>And the result of that is society has essentially collapsed.</p>
<p>So, you know, now the question is,</p>
<p>why did the Sri Lankan government feel compelled</p>
<p>to adopt these policies?</p>
<p>A lot of it has to do with the fact</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting these massive loans</p>
<p>from the World Bank and the IMF</p>
<p>and the World Bank and so forth</p>
<p>are imposing these ESG requirements.</p>
<p>So Sri Lanka has something like a 98% ESG rating</p>
<p>even as their economy and society is collapsing.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re doing a great job following the prescriptions</p>
<p>of the global elites at Davos.</p>
<p>I mean, this sort of global elite flies into Davos</p>
<p>from Brussels and Washington on their private planes.</p>
<p>They have panels on ESG</p>
<p>and then they prescribe these policies</p>
<p>for countries like Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>And this is the result.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been telling us for years</p>
<p>that somehow there&rsquo;s no trade-off</p>
<p>between their environmentalist policies</p>
<p>and creating a healthy growing economy.</p>
<p>And this is an example of that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>There are real trade-offs here.</p>
<p>And the crazy thing is that the elites expect</p>
<p>poor people in Sri Lanka to make up</p>
<p>for their environmental emissions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really fair at all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>In March of 2020, Sri Lanka enforced</p>
<p>one of the world&rsquo;s strictest China-esque COVID-19 lockdowns</p>
<p>despite one of the lowest death rates</p>
<p>and infection rates in the world.</p>
<p>And so for nearly three months,</p>
<p>it literally crippled the economy</p>
<p>and the livelihood of citizens there.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where it gets crazy.</p>
<p>Then they actually go against global best practice</p>
<p>and they ban the burial of COVID-19 victims</p>
<p>claiming that it could lead to groundwater contamination.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how they came up with this.</p>
<p>But you know what this did was it significantly</p>
<p>undermined the small minority of the country that is Muslim</p>
<p>because of religious practice there is you bury your dead.</p>
<p>And then that caused great pain to them.</p>
<p>And then it, as in turn, it hurt</p>
<p>all these international relationships</p>
<p>with all these Gulf nations.</p>
<p>So then you come all the way around</p>
<p>and then you go back to those same Gulf nations</p>
<p>a few months later and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>can I have subsidized oil?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, no, not so much.</p>
<p>And just to paint a picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening there right now,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty much a state of emergency.</p>
<p>You can see various videos trending on social media</p>
<p>and you always take those with some caution</p>
<p>because sometimes people will take clips out of context</p>
<p>or label them incorrectly</p>
<p>or use clips from other moments in time.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really happening there right now</p>
<p>and you shared a video in our group chat</p>
<p>is everything is now being doled out in various ways</p>
<p>in very small amounts.</p>
<p>So there are lines for basic goods</p>
<p>and inflation is crippling there.</p>
<p>And as Freeberg mentioned,</p>
<p>they started to pin their exchange rate</p>
<p>and their currency to, I guess, the world&rsquo;s exchange rate.</p>
<p>And now everything is super expensive</p>
<p>and essential imports like food and medicine and fuel,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the money to pay for it.</p>
<p>So this is going to be a complete societal collapse,</p>
<p>it seems, and they&rsquo;re going to need to get bailed out.</p>
<p>There was a bill that was introduced in the government</p>
<p>that said the central bank would be</p>
<p>forced to have a discipline on money printing.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>In March of 2020, the central bank of Sri Lanka</p>
<p>began printing money in order to finance</p>
<p>a growing budget deficit.</p>
<p>Again, happens in many countries.</p>
<p>And they did that in part to fulfill an election promise</p>
<p>that they made that they would maintain</p>
<p>single digit interest rates.</p>
<p>Again, sounds really familiar.</p>
<p>So they printed about 100 billion rupees in March.</p>
<p>In the next two years,</p>
<p>the central bank printed 1.65 trillion rupees, right?</p>
<p>So 16 and a half times that first number.</p>
<p>And then as a result,</p>
<p>what they saw was the highest inflation</p>
<p>in post-independence history.</p>
<p>So time after time,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re actually seeing in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>is not a microcosm of something that&rsquo;s endemic</p>
<p>to whatever you want to call it, Jason,</p>
<p>a developing country, a third world country.</p>
<p>Frontier.</p>
<p>A frontier country, a Southeast Asian country.</p>
<p>In fact, it actually resembles many of the policies</p>
<p>that exist in so many countries all around the world.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really important here is that as goes Sri Lanka,</p>
<p>so goes Ghana, so goes Pakistan,</p>
<p>so goes a whole bunch of countries</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re already starting to see food riots,</p>
<p>food insecurity, energy insecurity, rampant inflation,</p>
<p>sovereign defaults.</p>
<p>And you have to ask yourself like,</p>
<p>how are we going to really tourniquet this whole thing</p>
<p>and prevent a much bigger contagion</p>
<p>like Friberg just talked about?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>And we might be out of bullets-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important issue.</p>
<p>Because you mentioned COVID.</p>
<p>It turns out a lot of these frontier countries</p>
<p>were already on debt relief</p>
<p>and being given a moratorium on making their debt payments</p>
<p>since they got so walloped during COVID.</p>
<p>And then now the other shoe drops and here we are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no relief you can give them</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re already not paying their loans in some cases.</p>
<p>By the way, here&rsquo;s another thing that happens</p>
<p>in a lot of these developing countries.</p>
<p>So in the middle of all of this chaos,</p>
<p>what do you think happened?</p>
<p>The parliament got together,</p>
<p>they passed an amendment to the constitution</p>
<p>and it enforced and it gave incremental power</p>
<p>to one individual, the president.</p>
<p>And typically in most of these countries</p>
<p>that run by a parliamentary system,</p>
<p>the president is a figurehead, right?</p>
<p>The person shows up, you know,</p>
<p>shakes hand, kisses babies, that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>Maybe convenes a Senate, but that is it.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden the person has control over defense,</p>
<p>control over budget, control over the central bank.</p>
<p>And this person cannot be, you know,</p>
<p>voted out in a no confidence vote</p>
<p>the same way that a prime minister can.</p>
<p>That happened here as well.</p>
<p>So yet another example of if you start to see</p>
<p>a bunch of autocrats in some of these developing markets</p>
<p>feel like the answer is more power,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been tried here, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of lessons.</p>
<p>I am a little concerned and skeptical</p>
<p>that many of these other developing countries</p>
<p>that are teetering on insolvency will actually learn</p>
<p>what they need to hear.</p>
<p>We are the definition of the developed world, reportedly,</p>
<p>and we have a president</p>
<p>who tried to stay in power still in election.</p>
<p>So it literally is happening here</p>
<p>in the United States as well.</p>
<p>The parallels are truly terrifying.</p>
<p>All right, the CPI, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>did you just actually say something?</p>
<p>I was just rolling my eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not noise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no noise from an eye roll.</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>It sounded like a boulder going down a hill.</p>
<p>Wait, sorry, can I ask Chamath a question?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Chamath, by the way, if people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Chamath is of Sri Lankan descent,</p>
<p>just to make that clear,</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t hear his little mention of it.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you go there a couple of years ago?</p>
<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s another great example of,</p>
<p>in this case, this was the left</p>
<p>who managed to fuck things up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the right that screws things up</p>
<p>in that country, it&rsquo;s the left as well.</p>
<p>So in this example, I went there</p>
<p>and I offered to bring Google Loon, myself and Google,</p>
<p>we offered to bring internet access to the entire country,</p>
<p>like guaranteed internet access.</p>
<p>This was like five years ago.</p>
<p>And we set up an entity and the government</p>
<p>tried to do the right thing and grant some spectrum.</p>
<p>And instead of sort of like fast tracking this</p>
<p>and allowing this project to become a reality,</p>
<p>there was an enormous amount of infighting</p>
<p>that essentially said that we were trying</p>
<p>to steal the license or we stole the license</p>
<p>or we were trying to monetize the license.</p>
<p>And both me and Google were just like, forget this,</p>
<p>this is not worth it.</p>
<p>And we abandoned the project and walked away.</p>
<p>Instead, Google ends up servicing</p>
<p>a whole bunch of other countries.</p>
<p>And the reason why Sri Lanka was part of it</p>
<p>is because the balloons follow a certain orbit</p>
<p>and it would go over Sri Lanka no matter what.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like, we can light it up for free,</p>
<p>all we need is spectrum in this country,</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s already doing that work.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve gone there a few times.</p>
<p>I found it very difficult to try to do the right thing.</p>
<p>I think people, there&rsquo;s a level of infighting</p>
<p>that I hope this crisis changes.</p>
<p>I also think that it&rsquo;s an opportunity</p>
<p>for people to reset writ large,</p>
<p>the gerontocracy that runs many of these countries,</p>
<p>including the United States, quite honestly.</p>
<p>There is an opportunity, there are some of my friends</p>
<p>who I think may emerge in the next few weeks,</p>
<p>who are very well-known people in that country</p>
<p>who literally want to, step one,</p>
<p>remove most of the executive power from the presidency,</p>
<p>make it a true parliamentary style system</p>
<p>with an empowered prime minister,</p>
<p>and empowered elected officials,</p>
<p>and let the country run and fix itself,</p>
<p>deprioritize some defense spending,</p>
<p>deprioritize the growth of the public sector,</p>
<p>reprioritize the growth of the private sector.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;re successful.</p>
<p>I would love to invest, if given the opportunity,</p>
<p>under those kinds of market conditions,</p>
<p>and I would love to go back at some point.</p>
<p>But my history with the country has been very fraught</p>
<p>because as I&rsquo;ve gone to try to do the work, Friedberg,</p>
<p>people are just haters.</p>
<p>And they just, they will cut their nose off</p>
<p>despite the, they&rsquo;ll just do the worst things possible.</p>
<p>Chamath, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I think you have a second swing at bat here.</p>
<p>Only 50% or so of people in Sri Lanka have internet access,</p>
<p>and maybe we could talk to our friend over at Starlink,</p>
<p>and that could be an incredible mitzvah</p>
<p>and changing thing there.</p>
<p>If you get 100% of the country on internet,</p>
<p>my God, that could change everything,</p>
<p>and it seems completely doable.</p>
<p>By the way, and this is the most literate country</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>You have to understand, like the people in that country,</p>
<p>the human potential in that country is incredible, okay?</p>
<p>There are not developing countries like this</p>
<p>that have this type of literacy,</p>
<p>and the kindness of the people.</p>
<p>These are incredible, hardworking people.</p>
<p>But the elected class is some of the most inward,</p>
<p>navel-gazing, corrupt people,</p>
<p>and this is the opportunity</p>
<p>for the young people of that country</p>
<p>to wipe the slate clean with all of them</p>
<p>and start over with some.</p>
<p>The literacy rate is 92% or something crazy there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a highly educated, literate group of people.</p>
<p>The truth is, the number of people living</p>
<p>in extreme poverty has plummeted thanks to globalization.</p>
<p>We went from almost, yeah,</p>
<p>two billion people living in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s gonna end in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>We have maybe 500, 600 million people</p>
<p>living in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because of globalization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the great thing that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s also happened at the same time</p>
<p>is people have gotten out of sync.</p>
<p>We have elites, to Sax&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>who think they know better,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to enforce on an emerging market</p>
<p>or a frontier market, God forbid,</p>
<p>the things that we have the luxury of doing</p>
<p>in the developed world.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even do.</p>
<p>Wait, hold on.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, yes, people are.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t banned chemical fertilizers</p>
<p>in the Western world.</p>
<p>Well, we do have,</p>
<p>and Europe has standards for gas mileage</p>
<p>as but one example.</p>
<p>No, Jason.</p>
<p>We have emission standards.</p>
<p>We have the accords that we&rsquo;ve been working on.</p>
<p>All of these things are starting in the developed world</p>
<p>and now exactly to what Dave was just saying</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re taking them from the developed world.</p>
<p>We are imposing them,</p>
<p>and Sri Lanka apparently embraced it.</p>
<p>I guess they get points when they&rsquo;re at Davos.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka is not rich enough to resist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the issue.</p>
<p>So the US has an ESG rating of 51%.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has 98%.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because in our country,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna impose these crazy mandates.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough resistance to it.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>and you have these massive loans and debt service,</p>
<p>you have to do what the IMF and the World Bank</p>
<p>and all these international institutions</p>
<p>want you to do.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who imposed all this stuff.</p>
<p>So great.</p>
<p>So Sri Lanka ends up with a 98% near perfect ESG rating</p>
<p>even as the country is completely collapsing.</p>
<p>Read the Schellenberger article here.</p>
<p>He says,</p>
<p>the underlying reason for the fall of Sri Lanka</p>
<p>is as leaders fell under the spell of Western green elites</p>
<p>peddling organic agriculture and ESG.</p>
<p>And then he mentions that Sri Lanka</p>
<p>has a near perfect score of 98,</p>
<p>higher than Sweden, which is 96 and US is at 51.</p>
<p>What does having such a high ESG score mean?</p>
<p>Short, it means that Sri Lanka&rsquo;s 2 million farmers</p>
<p>were forced to stop using fertilizers and pesticides,</p>
<p>laying waste to its critical agricultural sector.</p>
<p>And then it goes on from there.</p>
<p>So it was the imposition of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that Sri Lanka&rsquo;s politicians</p>
<p>implemented Sri Lankan ideas</p>
<p>that caused the collapse of their country.</p>
<p>They implemented Western ideas.</p>
<p>They implemented the ideas.</p>
<p>And they were also corrupt.</p>
<p>So it was a combination.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>But they implemented the ideas they learned at Davos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost perverse.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got all these Western elites,</p>
<p>again, like John Kerry and so forth.</p>
<p>They fly in their private jets to Davos.</p>
<p>They come up with these ESG rules.</p>
<p>They coerce countries like Sri Lanka to obey them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the people of Sri Lanka who end up paying the price.</p>
<p>I mean, this doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your reaction to that, J. Cal?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somehow gonna blame this on Trump?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know how Trump has anything to do with this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one who brought it up.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m just thinking about it</p>
<p>from first principles.</p>
<p>You know, we should as a species, humanity,</p>
<p>should be trying to trend towards taking care of the planet</p>
<p>and lowering emissions and being in renewables.</p>
<p>And then how we go about doing it,</p>
<p>perhaps there was good intent here.</p>
<p>But obviously, if the country is corrupt</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re teetering already</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have the bankroll to do it,</p>
<p>forcing them to do it can lead to collapse.</p>
<p>Nobody forced anybody, but what did the score give you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if it all of a sudden got you.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, they forced them by nature</p>
<p>of you get your loans if you do these ESG requirements.</p>
<p>So that is forcing them de facto.</p>
<p>Okay, fair enough.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying like, you know, now that you have this score,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as if you issued green bonds</p>
<p>and you could stave off this default.</p>
<p>No, they shouldn&rsquo;t do what you said before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Sri Lanka should be looking at what Singapore did</p>
<p>and just copy the playbook, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so obvious that, you know, a country.</p>
<p>It requires a level of long-term leadership</p>
<p>and a lack of corruption.</p>
<p>And I think those two things are very hard to come by.</p>
<p>And I think a third,</p>
<p>which is a very controversial statement to make</p>
<p>is it required Singapore to adopt English as a lingua franca.</p>
<p>Now, in fairness to Singapore,</p>
<p>they also embrace multiculturalism, right?</p>
<p>So you had forced, you know, not forced,</p>
<p>but you had bilingualism in the school.</p>
<p>So Hindi, Malay, or sorry, Tamil, Malay, Chinese, right?</p>
<p>You would learn all of those.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you kept an ethnocentricity</p>
<p>to where you came from,</p>
<p>but they allowed you to understand a lingua franca</p>
<p>that allowed you to merchandise your skills</p>
<p>to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And it really-</p>
<p>Are you saying they adopted the melting pot playbook</p>
<p>and they allowed everybody from around the world</p>
<p>to have their culture,</p>
<p>but yet participate in a common goal?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Literally, if you say melting pot to young people today</p>
<p>and everybody should try to adopt, you know, a new culture,</p>
<p>but keep some of their own,</p>
<p>people find great offense to that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we were all taught.</p>
<p>The melting pot is what made this country great.</p>
<p>I think Lee Kuan Yew just called it multiculturalism.</p>
<p>But my point is that, you know,</p>
<p>I think the English decision by Singapore was important.</p>
<p>I think steady, predictable leadership by Lee Kuan Yew</p>
<p>was really critical.</p>
<p>And the lack of corruption, you know,</p>
<p>the way in which they promoted their public sector,</p>
<p>meaning, you know, some of the best paying jobs</p>
<p>in Singapore was a public sector job, right?</p>
<p>Like you would aspire to work</p>
<p>for the government of Singapore.</p>
<p>And so as a result, you had policies and movements</p>
<p>and the movement of capital and progress and rules</p>
<p>that were just, it&rsquo;s an example for so many countries.</p>
<p>And you look where they are today</p>
<p>for such a small population.</p>
<p>They have the same GDP, by the way, you showed Vietnam.</p>
<p>They have a larger GDP than Vietnam,</p>
<p>which is an incredible statement, you know,</p>
<p>a testament to Singapore&rsquo;s ingenuity.</p>
<p>So could that have been Sri Lanka?</p>
<p>I think so, knowing that the, you know,</p>
<p>the levels of literacy and intelligence,</p>
<p>and frankly, like, look, the religious stability</p>
<p>that can come from Buddhism, yet we&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re where we are today, which is a shame.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this is the canary in the coal mine.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna see Freiburg,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you think is gonna happen</p>
<p>over the next six months,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s gonna be other dominoes, certainly, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, I watch for Arab Spring type behavior, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you saw the protests</p>
<p>and people storming the presidential palace in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>You know, I would imagine if we had a report</p>
<p>from the intelligence advisors</p>
<p>to the president of the United States,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a long list and a growing list</p>
<p>of these nations you wanna keep an eye on right now,</p>
<p>where there is food insecurity, energy insecurity,</p>
<p>declining currency, you know, rising debt burden,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a breaking point for all of these.</p>
<p>And as you start to hit that breaking point,</p>
<p>you start to see more of what happened in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Now, when destabilization like this happens, it&rsquo;s scary,</p>
<p>because what happens is there&rsquo;s a new power that emerges,</p>
<p>and those powers may or may not be aligned</p>
<p>with the interests of the United States,</p>
<p>with the interests of allies,</p>
<p>with the interests of the world,</p>
<p>with the interest of Western democracy.</p>
<p>And so there are kind of scary moments</p>
<p>that can emerge over the next couple of quarters and years</p>
<p>as these camels back start to break,</p>
<p>as one straw after another</p>
<p>is put on the back of these camels.</p>
<p>So, well-</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s the white knight</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna come in and save these frontier markets?</p>
<p>Is it gonna be China, India, Russia, or the United States?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re plowing $40 billion</p>
<p>into supporting the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re busy kind of protecting our energy interests</p>
<p>and our interest with NATO as the United States.</p>
<p>And as you point out,</p>
<p>China will likely end up becoming the savior and supporter,</p>
<p>particularly where they have infrastructure investments</p>
<p>and interests.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have followed this,</p>
<p>China has been building presidential palaces</p>
<p>for African leaders throughout the continent.</p>
<p>And these palaces-</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t seen that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re incredible.</p>
<p>You guys should put photos of them on the video.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, wait, that&rsquo;s the wrong one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Sachs&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Sachs&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s Sachs&rsquo;s other house.</p>
<p>Sorry, hold on, next one.</p>
<p>Believe it or not,</p>
<p>they might put Sachs&rsquo;s house to shame some of these things.</p>
<p>Oh, look, they brought the President of Japan.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, that&rsquo;s Chamath&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Next one.</p>
<p>Anyway, but yeah, this is a moment to watch</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a very unfortunate confluence</p>
<p>of circumstances that may lead to destabilization,</p>
<p>that may lead to influence and power being gained</p>
<p>by folks that aren&rsquo;t direct allies of the United States.</p>
<p>And this is why you want to build up a great cash reserve</p>
<p>and have a really stable economy</p>
<p>so that when these moments do happen,</p>
<p>the good actors of the world can take advantage</p>
<p>of them as opposed to the bad ones.</p>
<p>And the United States is not in a great position for this.</p>
<p>Every society, as they say,</p>
<p>is three missed meals away from chaos.</p>
<p>There are now a record 19 developing countries</p>
<p>with sovereign debt trading at distressed levels, 19.</p>
<p>And two that have already defaulted.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to start.</p>
<p>Pakistan has nukes, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if that&rsquo;s problematic.</p>
<p>Well, and Pakistan, who&rsquo;s famous</p>
<p>for enabling other countries, Iran, North Korea, reportedly,</p>
<p>they look at their nukes as an export</p>
<p>and they are more than willing to sell you nuclear technology.</p>
<p>I just sent you guys a link from Forbes.</p>
<p>You know, there are currently, as of today,</p>
<p>inflation protests going on across Sri Lanka, Albania,</p>
<p>Argentina, Panama, Kenya, Ghana.</p>
<p>And if you look at the videos</p>
<p>and you look at the images of some of these protests,</p>
<p>and again, there&rsquo;s like, you know, in the African continent,</p>
<p>there are, you know, very radical militant groups</p>
<p>that will try and seize power</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s destabilization at the top.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are risks in South America.</p>
<p>I mean, all over the world, you know,</p>
<p>these sorts of moments can catalyze</p>
<p>a real shift in power and influence.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of it going on.</p>
<p>So you better believe that folks</p>
<p>in the US State Department and the CIA</p>
<p>are very busy right now.</p>
<p>If you look at bond prices,</p>
<p>the three countries that are the next closest to defaulting,</p>
<p>so Russia has defaulted,</p>
<p>but that was more a vaguery of, you know,</p>
<p>foreign currency controls that didn&rsquo;t allow them to pay,</p>
<p>but Sri Lanka has officially defaulted,</p>
<p>and the next three are El Salvador, Ghana, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, Argentina, just so you guys know,</p>
<p>the Argentinian print on inflation</p>
<p>last month was 61%.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>If we think that our 9.1-</p>
<p>And Argentina, as you guys may know,</p>
<p>they had a structural default a few years ago,</p>
<p>renegotiation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been back at the table</p>
<p>over and over negotiating for years,</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re facing this inflationary crisis yet again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary moment in Argentina.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is exactly like the European crisis</p>
<p>with Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of negotiations occurring.</p>
<p>I really believe in this country,</p>
<p>and I think the people are incredible,</p>
<p>and I hope that whoever&rsquo;s the president</p>
<p>basically takes as much power away from that role</p>
<p>and puts it in the hands of the prime minister</p>
<p>and gets out of the way.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;re hoping for the best.</p>
<p>Okay, CPIs, as everybody who listens to this show knows,</p>
<p>is a basket of goods and services</p>
<p>and how it changes over time.</p>
<p>You can slice and dice the CPI</p>
<p>based on food, energy, shelter, your house, et cetera.</p>
<p>Last two months have been just extraordinary to watch,</p>
<p>driven obviously by energy,</p>
<p>which has been driven by the Russia-Ukrainian conflict,</p>
<p>the Sachs rant on Biden&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>The core index doesn&rsquo;t include energy,</p>
<p>and so if you were to look at the core index,</p>
<p>it, and here&rsquo;s a chart, 5.9% in June,</p>
<p>and it peaked actually with 6.5% in March.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been trending down if you take energy out of it.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t experienced-</p>
<p>Energy and food, I think, are excluded from core.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if we haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t experienced core inflation like this</p>
<p>since the 70s or 80s.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another chart just to zoom out,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see exactly how jarring this has been</p>
<p>for basically our generation.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t experienced this since,</p>
<p>if you were born in the 70s or so,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it was higher than it is today,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had, obviously, goods and services plummet</p>
<p>in our lifetime because of globalization</p>
<p>and low interest rates.</p>
<p>Energy hasn&rsquo;t seen inflation like this since the 70s.</p>
<p>What is this chart?</p>
<p>Is this CPI?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>That is the core.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t- That&rsquo;s core inflation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s core, and then here&rsquo;s the energy one</p>
<p>coming up next.</p>
<p>So when you look at energy,</p>
<p>obviously energy has been volatile in our lifetime</p>
<p>because a lot of the oil in the world</p>
<p>is controlled by dictators,</p>
<p>Middle East, Russia, Venezuela, yada, yada,</p>
<p>but the 40% year-over-year increase</p>
<p>in cost of gas and oil and energy</p>
<p>has put us back to the mid-70s, 80s in terms of pain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s this chart.</p>
<p>So you see it spiking all over the place,</p>
<p>but generally it was under 20%,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re back above 20%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the oil.</p>
<p>Chamath, we were talking in the group chat before.</p>
<p>You were kind of satisfied with 9.1.</p>
<p>Do you think the 9.1 we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>in the inflation print today,</p>
<p>which was higher than expectations,</p>
<p>what is that gonna lead to</p>
<p>in terms of the interest rate hike?</p>
<p>75 basis points, or you think they just go right to one?</p>
<p>You know, we talked about this,</p>
<p>that this was gonna be a big print, right?</p>
<p>I think we all expected this to be a big print.</p>
<p>I actually also kind of put myself on a limb there,</p>
<p>and I said, you know,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if at some point</p>
<p>we print a mid to high nines,</p>
<p>maybe even a 10 handle at some point.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re getting there.</p>
<p>And the reason is because, you know,</p>
<p>rents are a little, you know,</p>
<p>they lag in how they&rsquo;re reported inside of CPI.</p>
<p>So we have a couple more months to go of rents,</p>
<p>and rents are moving or budging a bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>We do see a little bit of fall off in energy prices,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not so sure that it&rsquo;s enough, frankly,</p>
<p>to move the needle.</p>
<p>So I think that we could be in a sustained period for a while.</p>
<p>The more interesting thing I thought today</p>
<p>was that Canada surprised everybody</p>
<p>and raised their benchmark interest rate</p>
<p>by 100 basis points.</p>
<p>Okay, one full point.</p>
<p>One full point, 100 bips.</p>
<p>And they just said, we&rsquo;re going for it,</p>
<p>we need to tame this,</p>
<p>we need to break the back of inflation.</p>
<p>They ripped the Band-Aid off, yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, and, you know,</p>
<p>and I think if you read the Fed minutes more carefully,</p>
<p>I think Jerome Powell is basically ready</p>
<p>to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>After this inflation print,</p>
<p>the expectation for July went to 80 basis points from 75,</p>
<p>which means a small percentage of people</p>
<p>actually think is going to be 100.</p>
<p>And September, I think, moved to 75.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>So the question is, is that enough?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And to be clear, this is for June.</p>
<p>The data we got on today, July 13th, is for June.</p>
<p>What we did see in July,</p>
<p>because we can track oil prices,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s down 20% month over month,</p>
<p>and the CPI has been driven largely by oil.</p>
<p>So speak to that, Shamaf.</p>
<p>What do you think it&rsquo;s going to be in July</p>
<p>when we get it in August?</p>
<p>No, but yes and no, because again,</p>
<p>the owner equivalent rents are up so much</p>
<p>that they may actually break even, right?</p>
<p>Meaning rents go up by so much,</p>
<p>oil goes down by so much,</p>
<p>they cancel and we&rsquo;re still at nine.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s your prediction for July,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll get in August?</p>
<p>You think nine?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in a sustained inflationary environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried about that.</p>
<p>I hope that we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But then the question, Jason, secondarily,</p>
<p>is then what do the markets do?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so interesting today</p>
<p>is the markets shook it all off.</p>
<p>You could not have had a worse inflation print.</p>
<p>Everything was up.</p>
<p>Well, 10.</p>
<p>Meaning it was beyond the number that was expected,</p>
<p>every component of it was up,</p>
<p>everything looked horrible,</p>
<p>and people were like, meh.</p>
<p>Is that because the market is future looking, Sax?</p>
<p>The market is basically pricing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get through this in six to 12 months.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying, Sax?</p>
<p>The markets are down right now, to be clear.</p>
<p>The print was definitely worse than expected.</p>
<p>Half a point.</p>
<p>They were expecting 8.8%, it was 9.1.</p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s number was 8.6.</p>
<p>I remember us talking about inflation</p>
<p>a couple of months ago,</p>
<p>saying that we thought it had peaked</p>
<p>maybe in April or May at the latest,</p>
<p>simply because inflation is measured</p>
<p>on a year-over-year basis,</p>
<p>and we were starting to lap much bigger comps last year.</p>
<p>Remember this conversation?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, the lapping effect turned out not to be enough,</p>
<p>and inflation is still rising.</p>
<p>So we have not yet peaked on CPI.</p>
<p>I understand that core, we have peaked,</p>
<p>but deciding to exclude energy and food,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a pretty arbitrary decision.</p>
<p>Those are two really important variables</p>
<p>that matter to the ordinary American, for sure.</p>
<p>So we solved this problem,</p>
<p>and to Sharma&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s gonna subside.</p>
<p>And I think the big question now is,</p>
<p>when does inflation finally peak</p>
<p>and start going down back to where it should be,</p>
<p>and then how severe a recession do we have to have</p>
<p>in order for the Fed to solve this problem?</p>
<p>It feels like things are turning over in real estate.</p>
<p>We talked about that last week.</p>
<p>The number of homes being listed is skyrocketing.</p>
<p>The number of mortgages being originated</p>
<p>is plummeting while the rate goes up.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna see mortgage rates</p>
<p>probably go six, 7% towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna put a huge kibosh.</p>
<p>The high-end real estate is also starting to get hit</p>
<p>massively.</p>
<p>The number of listings is going up in the high-end,</p>
<p>and the number of sales is plummeting.</p>
<p>So that was one of the cards we wanted to see turn over,</p>
<p>and it looks like that&rsquo;s turning over.</p>
<p>Just one small clarification is,</p>
<p>we obsess over CPI right now</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all kind of these fake macro wannabe traders,</p>
<p>but I just want to remind you,</p>
<p>because the Fed has been pretty clear about this,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t focus on CPI.</p>
<p>They focus on something else instead called PCE,</p>
<p>which is the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the flow-through</p>
<p>from CPI to PCEPI is exactly,</p>
<p>but that is the broadest measure of goods and services,</p>
<p>which does include food and energy.</p>
<p>So it stands to reason that PCE may stay elevated</p>
<p>for a while, which may give the Fed</p>
<p>enough of the motivation they need</p>
<p>to go 100, to go another 100,</p>
<p>or maybe go 100 and then a 75.</p>
<p>I think that David&rsquo;s point is right.</p>
<p>All this taming that we&rsquo;ve been expecting to see,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t seen it.</p>
<p>So every month it&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s coming next month.</p>
<p>Every month it&rsquo;s been, oh, it&rsquo;s happening next month.</p>
<p>At some point, you may just have to say,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re in a sustained period for a while,</p>
<p>and I have to believe it&rsquo;s going up</p>
<p>before I believe it&rsquo;s going to stay stable or go down.</p>
<p>Well, we did see energy go down.</p>
<p>Housing, we are seeing now starting to contract.</p>
<p>The number of price cuts has been surging,</p>
<p>according to Redfin.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re starting,</p>
<p>and the layoffs obviously happened two months ago.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t we think that we&rsquo;re starting to see the headwinds?</p>
<p>And then we were talking to a buddy of ours</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s big in the airline space.</p>
<p>He said, God, and I think you were pointing out</p>
<p>this statistic, that Heathrow is now capping</p>
<p>the number of people who can fly</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been so crazy.</p>
<p>Heathrow is so overloaded with traffic of passengers</p>
<p>that they today came out and said,</p>
<p>we are capping the number of passengers</p>
<p>to 100,000 a day, no more.</p>
<p>And this is after the cost of those flights</p>
<p>was skyrocketing, $6,000, $7,000 to go to Europe.</p>
<p>I really go back to what Sachs said before.</p>
<p>The nugget for me of this entire summer</p>
<p>was what he said about his takeaway</p>
<p>from the CO2 conference, right?</p>
<p>Just to remind people that the person said something</p>
<p>to the effect of, oh, well, look,</p>
<p>all these other people will be saving money and cutting jobs.</p>
<p>I intend to hire, and nothing has changed for me.</p>
<p>And the comment that I made in our group chat is,</p>
<p>well, maybe that&rsquo;s the psychology of everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the CEO of a company.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to be clear, what CO2 did</p>
<p>is they polled all the founders in the audience.</p>
<p>The poll results showed that on the one hand,</p>
<p>everyone in the audience understood</p>
<p>that we were headed for a big downturn</p>
<p>and economic conditions and fundraising</p>
<p>are gonna be much tougher.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all the founders,</p>
<p>or two thirds of them said that they were gonna use</p>
<p>this downturn to accelerate their business</p>
<p>as opposed to cut.</p>
<p>My one-on-one conversation with the various founders</p>
<p>are in line with that, which is, it&rsquo;s all not me.</p>
<p>I know everybody else is gonna be impacted,</p>
<p>is gonna have to cut,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna be the one exception.</p>
<p>And there will be exceptions, absolutely,</p>
<p>but everybody can&rsquo;t be the exception.</p>
<p>So I hear you&rsquo;re saying, I&rsquo;m gonna still buy my car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still going on my summer vacation.</p>
<p>Everybody else has to make cuts.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what they say.</p>
<p>Consumers are behaving that way.</p>
<p>American Airlines basically put out</p>
<p>where they thought they were gonna be.</p>
<p>Their stock was up 10%.</p>
<p>Heathrow says we have too much traffic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna cap it at 100K.</p>
<p>There was an article about US home prices and rents,</p>
<p>and there were these two housing companies</p>
<p>in the Wall Street Journal that were profiled,</p>
<p>and both of them served middle-income neighborhoods</p>
<p>in Houston and these other places.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;ve never done better business.</p>
<p>And there are fewer and fewer people buying homes</p>
<p>because of mortgage rates.</p>
<p>They all wanna rent.</p>
<p>We have complete ball control.</p>
<p>And so where is the stopping</p>
<p>and the slowing down of spending?</p>
<p>It just may be reflexively this thing</p>
<p>where everybody feels like to have</p>
<p>the polite dinner conversation,</p>
<p>they have to talk about how they&rsquo;re pulling back.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like anybody&rsquo;s pulling back.</p>
<p>Austerity measures have not hit yet.</p>
<p>Well, I think they are in the process of working,</p>
<p>but it just takes a while.</p>
<p>I mean, what I would say is, look,</p>
<p>we are 100% gonna solve this inflation problem.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?</p>
<p>Because price levels are fully within the power of the Fed.</p>
<p>They just have to raise interest rates high enough.</p>
<p>Paul Volkow proved that in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>He had to raise interest rates as high as 20%,</p>
<p>but he crushed the inflation 1970s,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what it took.</p>
<p>So I have no doubt that the Fed can stop inflation.</p>
<p>I think the question is,</p>
<p>how much pain are they gonna have to inflict?</p>
<p>How high do rates have to go?</p>
<p>And how long do we live through</p>
<p>this sort of stagflationary period?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the unsettling thing,</p>
<p>is where it doesn&rsquo;t seem like we&rsquo;re anywhere</p>
<p>near the end of this yet.</p>
<p>I wrote this last week in a little note,</p>
<p>but this is why, if you look at the Taylor rate,</p>
<p>again, and people have abandoned the Taylor rate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what it used to be, I guess,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still pretty directionally accurate,</p>
<p>which is what is the true equilibrium interest rate</p>
<p>that allows us to basically manage</p>
<p>and meet supply and demand together</p>
<p>so that we have a calm, stable economy?</p>
<p>And that stable equilibrium rate is approaching 5%.</p>
<p>You know, our target, the collective wisdom of the market</p>
<p>believes that 3% is enough to get the job done.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re right now at 1.5 to 1.75.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s any number between three and five</p>
<p>that is the true price,</p>
<p>we have a lot of work to do to get there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a really good point</p>
<p>because the 10-year T-bill has been kind of funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been kind of floating around 3%.</p>
<p>So that is the long-term expectation</p>
<p>of the interest rates that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to have sort of normal inflation.</p>
<p>But what if it&rsquo;s 4% or if it&rsquo;s 5%?</p>
<p>If that ends up being the case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be a huge downside surprise to the stock market.</p>
<p>Well, how would you define that?</p>
<p>10% pullback, 20% pullback from here?</p>
<p>Well, you have a bunch of things.</p>
<p>Look, we talked about this other issue before as well,</p>
<p>which is if you believe the stock market is fairly valued,</p>
<p>you have to believe that prices are right</p>
<p>and that the earnings are right, right?</p>
<p>So, because it&rsquo;s effectively,</p>
<p>if it all boils down to the price earnings ratio</p>
<p>of the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to still maintain that the E is wrong.</p>
<p>The earnings are wrong for most of these companies.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>Well, one is that when these companies start to report</p>
<p>their quarterly earnings starting in the next few days,</p>
<p>the year-over-year comparison is going to be</p>
<p>to the numbers that they posted in Q2 of 2021,</p>
<p>which by all accounts was a blowout number.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the number before that was 2020</p>
<p>where their business was zero, right?</p>
<p>So you have these incredibly tough comps</p>
<p>in terms of growth percentages that you have to reach,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think are achievable.</p>
<p>Second is everybody&rsquo;s costs of making</p>
<p>and selling things is going up,</p>
<p>which stands to reason that unless you raise prices</p>
<p>quickly enough, your profits will go down.</p>
<p>Third, if you actually do business</p>
<p>outside of the United States,</p>
<p>the US dollar has rallied so much</p>
<p>that you actually have less income</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re making in these other countries</p>
<p>when you convert them and bring them back</p>
<p>to the United States.</p>
<p>Now, most people look through that last issue,</p>
<p>but the point is if you add this all up,</p>
<p>there is a reasonable probability</p>
<p>that all the E&rsquo;s are wrong,</p>
<p>in which case we have to reassess</p>
<p>what the right E should be,</p>
<p>in which case, what is the right PE?</p>
<p>Yes, and earnings are a function</p>
<p>of what you spend and what you make.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we see so many companies</p>
<p>doing layoffs, cutting people,</p>
<p>Microsoft, Google, everybody is now putting people</p>
<p>on notice that they have to perform.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re firing white collar labor,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re hiring blue collar labor faster.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re actually gonna see</p>
<p>a downtick in productivity, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re replacing a person that may sit down at a desk</p>
<p>and use a computer eight to 10 hours a day to do something,</p>
<p>but you are hiring a lot of people</p>
<p>that may get paid by the hour</p>
<p>or make it paid a fixed salary</p>
<p>if you do the right kind of work,</p>
<p>but that qualifies as more contractual blue collar labor.</p>
<p>The difference in that</p>
<p>is a productivity difference, ultimately.</p>
<p>And just so everybody knows,</p>
<p>for PE&rsquo;s, price earning ratios over time,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a quick chart for you.</p>
<p>Currently, and this is for the S&amp;P 500,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re currently at 20 or so,</p>
<p>and we have twice in our lifetime</p>
<p>kind of hit that 13, 14, 15 level.</p>
<p>So we could have a 25% correction</p>
<p>from here in the stock market.</p>
<p>If you look at the highs,</p>
<p>our recent high in December of 2020,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at 38 price earnings ratio.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve fallen from 38 down to 20,</p>
<p>almost in half,</p>
<p>and we could still go down 25% from here.</p>
<p>And that would basically not even set a new record,</p>
<p>that would just hit the last two crises we had.</p>
<p>The thing that I think will work</p>
<p>against this happening, Jason,</p>
<p>so yeah, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>maybe it goes to 3000 or 3200.</p>
<p>But if you look again today,</p>
<p>and what I mean by the market has roughly shaken this off,</p>
<p>the fact that the markets right now, as we talk,</p>
<p>are essentially down half a point.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P is down 12 points.</p>
<p>It means that they are looking for any and all reasons</p>
<p>to say, this is a solved problem,</p>
<p>move on, nothing to see here.</p>
<p>Now, that is a psychological reaction.</p>
<p>Most of that, if you actually,</p>
<p>I called a friend today and I said, where are the flows?</p>
<p>And he said, retail right now is where all the flows are,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s retail that&rsquo;s buying,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in the 30th, 35th percentile</p>
<p>of where they normally buy,</p>
<p>which is a pretty healthy signal.</p>
<p>Wait, explain what you mean.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s buying?</p>
<p>So the way the market works basically</p>
<p>is you have buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>And to make it really, really simple,</p>
<p>you have hedge funds as one class of buyer.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You have ETFs, but they&rsquo;re not really because they have-</p>
<p>Exchange traded funds, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they have fixed strategies</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re hedging, they&rsquo;re moving, but whatever.</p>
<p>And then you have retail.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s retail and hedge funds.</p>
<p>Those are the two main pockets</p>
<p>of where the flows come into the stock market from.</p>
<p>And you can get a real sense of what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>what the psychology of the market is,</p>
<p>if you see what those flows are.</p>
<p>And right now, what we see is that hedge funds</p>
<p>are largely on the sidelines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re waiting.</p>
<p>What that means is they are,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;ve been so battered and bruised,</p>
<p>in some ways I think they&rsquo;re licking their wounds,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re mostly waiting.</p>
<p>They do not find a compelling reason to buy, right?</p>
<p>But they have to buy at some point, right, Chamath?</p>
<p>This is their business.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, I guess they would have to find</p>
<p>other opportunities, right?</p>
<p>Their business is to make money relative to their index.</p>
<p>And so if their index gets torched,</p>
<p>they doing nothing makes them look like geniuses.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to buy at any point.</p>
<p>They just need to make money in the end.</p>
<p>So right now we&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>where the markets are looking for a direction.</p>
<p>Retail seems to think that direction should be up.</p>
<p>Hedge funds don&rsquo;t have an opinion or saying,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going to wait this thing out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the data at best is a question mark.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the tension we have right now</p>
<p>in the stock market is the psychological desire</p>
<p>is for this thing to be over.</p>
<p>Meaning I think people want to hear inflation is done.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting the recession.</p>
<p>Give us three or four quarters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be out.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a steady state interest rate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go tech.</p>
<p>People want to accept the reality.</p>
<p>Freeberg, does that mean that we&rsquo;re bouncing</p>
<p>along the bottom for the next year?</p>
<p>And then this is the time or the opportunity to buy it.</p>
<p>I want to get financial advice,</p>
<p>but what are your thoughts if hedge funds</p>
<p>and retail are kind of waiting in the way?</p>
<p>Are you asking me if the stock market is at a bottom?</p>
<p>Are we bouncing along the bottom?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or what would you, how would you describe the next year?</p>
<p>If you were to look at it, what do you think?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you guys some stories.</p>
<p>I went to a conference in March</p>
<p>with a lot of fund managers,</p>
<p>probably managed several trillion dollars in total.</p>
<p>People were like in shock and awe at that conference</p>
<p>because they had taken such significant write downs</p>
<p>and they were still getting written down.</p>
<p>So all their investments were off.</p>
<p>They were off 40% from the peak.</p>
<p>They were freaking out.</p>
<p>Things were collapsing.</p>
<p>No one was doing anything.</p>
<p>They were all sitting on the sidelines,</p>
<p>hanging out and waiting.</p>
<p>I went to a conference last week.</p>
<p>And so the tone and the demeanor was just like morose.</p>
<p>Last week, I went to a conference with a lot of managers,</p>
<p>also probably managing trillions of dollars across the pool.</p>
<p>And people were just kind of,</p>
<p>they had accepted this new reality</p>
<p>and they were kind of willing to look at new things.</p>
<p>And, you know, they were no longer engaged</p>
<p>in trying to shore up just their portfolio.</p>
<p>And a lot of the stuff we talk about,</p>
<p>which I think is tactical on the ground,</p>
<p>how do we deal with our businesses</p>
<p>and our portfolio of investments</p>
<p>that we actively work with in the private markets,</p>
<p>they were much more interested</p>
<p>in kind of starting to explore and think about new things.</p>
<p>And I hadn&rsquo;t seen that three months ago.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a positive.</p>
<p>From a market participant point of view,</p>
<p>I think that folks have kind of accepted a new normal,</p>
<p>an inflationary normal, a high volatility normal,</p>
<p>you know, a normal of uncertainty,</p>
<p>a normal of kind of recession.</p>
<p>And as people have started</p>
<p>to kind of internalize that new normal,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re now starting to say,</p>
<p>okay, what should my action plan be?</p>
<p>And that action plan is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got trillions of dollars of capital</p>
<p>sitting on the sidelines.</p>
<p>What should I start to do with it?</p>
<p>So, you know, my very, very, very anecdotal experience</p>
<p>has been that significant market participants,</p>
<p>I think are gonna start to perk their head up this quarter</p>
<p>and start to think about doing new things.</p>
<p>What that translates into in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>stock price movements and indices, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that there&rsquo;s gonna be a huge variation</p>
<p>in outcome during this year.</p>
<p>And some industries, some sectors,</p>
<p>some types of businesses will outperform others.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t wanna create generalized statements</p>
<p>about indices, but I do think that capital activity</p>
<p>is gonna start to come back this quarter</p>
<p>where people are gonna start to think about what to do</p>
<p>rather than pull everything out</p>
<p>because of the massive shift that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>in the past couple of quarters.</p>
<p>Saks, what are you as a market participant thinking?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at series A&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>maybe doing some opportunistic flat rounds.</p>
<p>Are you looking at the startup market,</p>
<p>mid-stage market, and saying, hey, this is an opportunity.</p>
<p>Maybe I should start looking to put some money to work</p>
<p>in the next six to 12 months?</p>
<p>Or are you-</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, we&rsquo;re still investing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still investing?</p>
<p>Of course, yes.</p>
<p>So as a market participant, you&rsquo;re investing.</p>
<p>What are you seeing?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re investing, but we see that the pace of dealmaking</p>
<p>has slowed way down because founders know</p>
<p>that valuations have gone down,</p>
<p>the fundraising environment is tougher.</p>
<p>So last year they&rsquo;re raising every nine months.</p>
<p>Now they know they should probably be raising</p>
<p>once every two years.</p>
<p>So the pace has slowed way down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s healthier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s healthier, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more normalized.</p>
<p>Last year, the companies that could raise did raise.</p>
<p>They have big war chests.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s gonna be a delay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a slower period.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a couple of growth deals recently.</p>
<p>I think the fact that Tiger</p>
<p>and the other kind of crossover investors,</p>
<p>the fact they&rsquo;ve pulled way back from venture markets</p>
<p>gives smaller firms like us</p>
<p>an opportunity to do growth deals.</p>
<p>How did you make the decision to invest in those companies?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both companies we&rsquo;ve known for a long time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve wanted to invest for a while.</p>
<p>So, you know, the opportunity arose to invest</p>
<p>and it was way less competitive</p>
<p>than it would have been last year.</p>
<p>So this is what you call opportunistic.</p>
<p>You knew the firm, you had high confidence in them</p>
<p>and opportunistically they need money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve basically done two deals in the last like four months.</p>
<p>And what was your pace, let&rsquo;s say 18 months ago?</p>
<p>It was a little faster than that for sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just more deals happening.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>If you wanna think about tail risk</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some event</p>
<p>that can massively shift the market,</p>
<p>you know, the indices South, right?</p>
<p>Make them go negative.</p>
<p>And everyone pulls money out of equities</p>
<p>or out of bonds further.</p>
<p>There are some of those events brewing, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the consumer credit risk.</p>
<p>We talked maybe Taiwan,</p>
<p>maybe this emerging market crisis</p>
<p>that may kind of be emerging.</p>
<p>These are like little turtles putting their heads out.</p>
<p>They may not come out,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s enough of these turtles now,</p>
<p>kind of circling you,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s still reason to be wary.</p>
<p>Whereas-</p>
<p>Let alone a black swan event,</p>
<p>which would be undefined.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t even black swans.</p>
<p>These are just like significant-</p>
<p>Known risks.</p>
<p>Yeah, known but significant risks, right?</p>
<p>And if any of them do kind of take off,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already in a very shaky kind of period right now</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re trying to manage inflation and recession</p>
<p>and businesses are trying to raise capital.</p>
<p>And again, this is why a lot of biotech companies</p>
<p>are trading below cash</p>
<p>because the expectation is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to raise capital.</p>
<p>I mean, any one of these-</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll go out of business.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go out of business.</p>
<p>So any one of these things pops up,</p>
<p>boom, you start to see things go.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the reason people,</p>
<p>investors, portfolio managers,</p>
<p>are not gonna kind of rush back in</p>
<p>to putting more money into equities</p>
<p>is just sitting around,</p>
<p>waiting to see how a few of these things resolve</p>
<p>before kind of taking action.</p>
<p>But there are companies that do not face the risk of ruin.</p>
<p>They just are sitting on so much cash.</p>
<p>They have so much revenue</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no chance of that happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve always said,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you find a great business</p>
<p>and you believe in that business over the very long run,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to worry about timing the markets.</p>
<p>You put money in that business,</p>
<p>as long as you get a fair valuation for it today</p>
<p>relative to what it should be priced at,</p>
<p>based on what markets are telling you today-</p>
<p>Well, and a 20 PE would be more than fair historically.</p>
<p>Maybe, who knows?</p>
<p>But like whatever that is.</p>
<p>But if you find a great business</p>
<p>that you think is gonna compound value for you</p>
<p>over the very long run,</p>
<p>market cycles don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And long run, you mean a decade?</p>
<p>Yeah, call it a decade.</p>
<p>Sachs&rsquo;s business that he&rsquo;s invested in,</p>
<p>these are tech companies</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re planning to go public next year.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making an investment in a business</p>
<p>that he considers to be a great business</p>
<p>that can compound value.</p>
<p>Not compound valuation, but compound business value.</p>
<p>Meaning they can do something more valuable next year</p>
<p>than they were doing this year</p>
<p>and continue to accrue an advantage in their business</p>
<p>that allows them to accumulate earnings over time</p>
<p>or accumulate revenue</p>
<p>that ultimately translates into earnings over time.</p>
<p>And there are many businesses that are public</p>
<p>that operate like that,</p>
<p>that regardless of any of these turtles</p>
<p>popping their head out,</p>
<p>those businesses will perform well over the next decade.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s always a great place to invest.</p>
<p>So we basically went from D-Day, saving private Ryan</p>
<p>and seeing in the first quarter</p>
<p>to now people have accepted we&rsquo;re in wartime</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not shell-shocked.</p>
<p>And some people are looking for opportunities.</p>
<p>Chamath, you found an opportunity?</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk about the deal you did this week.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with Friedberg.</p>
<p>I mean, you find these businesses that you like</p>
<p>and if they appeal to you and you do your work,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to write a check.</p>
<p>Can you stop right there and just say</p>
<p>and define what you mean by do the work?</p>
<p>Because everybody hears you say that.</p>
<p>What does that mean for an investor,</p>
<p>for somebody like yourself?</p>
<p>What does doing the work mean?</p>
<p>It really depends on the sector.</p>
<p>So for example, when we were,</p>
<p>when I was trying to underwrite Opendoor,</p>
<p>what I really wanted to understand was,</p>
<p>what do take rates look like in all these various markets?</p>
<p>Well, how do I think take rates will evolve here?</p>
<p>How do value added services work?</p>
<p>What kind of margins can you sustain?</p>
<p>What is the sensitivity of different parts</p>
<p>of the real estate economy to interest rates?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of work.</p>
<p>When I was underwriting SoFi,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to understand is,</p>
<p>how do banks generate net increased income, NIM?</p>
<p>How does that change over time?</p>
<p>How does bank charters change that?</p>
<p>How do loss rates change in times of economic expansion</p>
<p>versus recessions?</p>
<p>How do you price all of that</p>
<p>into a fair value of a business?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a lot of really detailed diligence</p>
<p>to understand all the facets</p>
<p>or as many of the facets as possible of a business</p>
<p>that allow you to have a clear,</p>
<p>high sense of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Then there are others which are pure technology bets</p>
<p>where you try to understand either the biology</p>
<p>or the technology.</p>
<p>So in the case of the deal that I did today</p>
<p>or this past week,</p>
<p>myself, a bunch of family offices around the world</p>
<p>led by a great chairman, Pablo Lagareta,</p>
<p>who started a phenomenal business called Royalty Pharma,</p>
<p>which is public.</p>
<p>Carlos Slim, a bunch of folks.</p>
<p>We put in about half a billion dollars</p>
<p>to help advance into clinical trials,</p>
<p>this business that&rsquo;s trying to provide a solution</p>
<p>to chronic kidney disease.</p>
<p>So in that example, it was a lot of scientific diligence</p>
<p>on what are the existing solutions?</p>
<p>How do they work?</p>
<p>What is the mechanism of action inside the body?</p>
<p>How is this the same or different?</p>
<p>What does the early data say?</p>
<p>How are the clinical trials structured?</p>
<p>And then you come to an answer.</p>
<p>In this case, I decided the bet was worth taking.</p>
<p>And like Friedrich said-</p>
<p>Tell us the name of the company and what they do.</p>
<p>The company is called ProKidney.</p>
<p>And basically the idea is that it uses your own body</p>
<p>to help heal your kidneys</p>
<p>if you are on the verge of chronic kidney disease</p>
<p>or you are getting dialysis, et cetera.</p>
<p>And essentially how it works is it removes cells</p>
<p>from your body, from your kidney actually.</p>
<p>And then it does basically puts it into a centrifuge,</p>
<p>does some specific things to it,</p>
<p>grows and amplifies certain cell lines from your kidney,</p>
<p>and then re-injects those back into your kidney</p>
<p>and tries to improve what&rsquo;s called your EGFR,</p>
<p>which is your estimated glomular filtration rate,</p>
<p>which is essentially a number that we can use</p>
<p>to estimate how efficient your kidneys are.</p>
<p>And essentially when you are a type two diabetic</p>
<p>or you have chronic kidney disease or kidney failure</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re on dialysis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because that filtration capability has failed.</p>
<p>And so all these toxins are getting pushed back</p>
<p>into your body.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, we took a half a billion dollar shot.</p>
<p>I wrote $125 million check.</p>
<p>I hope it works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And then from Freiburg,</p>
<p>we saw some satellite images this week.</p>
<p>Biden, I guess, announced them.</p>
<p>They looked pretty trippy.</p>
<p>Explain to us what the downstream effect of what is,</p>
<p>I think, the most clear picture we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>of the cosmos ever created</p>
<p>and what that could actually do for humanity.</p>
<p>Well, this has nothing to do with Biden, but okay.</p>
<p>No, I just, that Biden showed it on Monday.</p>
<p>I just, that&rsquo;s all it was.</p>
<p>He made it, they specifically had him share it,</p>
<p>which I think maybe they were looking</p>
<p>for a mini win or something.</p>
<p>Good for him.</p>
<p>He has nothing to do with this program.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean, I just mean that like the scientists</p>
<p>and the engineers that worked on this for many years</p>
<p>deserve all the frigging credit.</p>
<p>The James Webb telescope is a space telescope,</p>
<p>just like the Hubble, right?</p>
<p>Remember the Hubble Space Telescope?</p>
<p>And this is a massive improvement over the Hubble.</p>
<p>So imagine you&rsquo;re in a boat</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to look at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>You take a bunch of binoculars, a pair of binoculars.</p>
<p>You look into the ocean and you try and see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>How hard that would be, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this murky stuff in the water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be really hard to see it.</p>
<p>The reason that we create a space telescope</p>
<p>is so that the same problem that we would have</p>
<p>looking at a telescope through the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t impact the light coming into the telescope.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s so much stuff in the atmosphere, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s miles of molecules and dirt and dust moving around.</p>
<p>So by putting a telescope in space,</p>
<p>we get rid of all that murkiness.</p>
<p>And now we can really capture the light</p>
<p>that is coming from far, far away,</p>
<p>concentrate that light onto really sensitive</p>
<p>photo detectors.</p>
<p>These are photo detectors that operate</p>
<p>at nearly the coldest point in the universe,</p>
<p>negative 263 Kelvin.</p>
<p>And that photo detector makes it extremely sensitive.</p>
<p>And using a 20 foot wide mirror,</p>
<p>we can capture all the light that&rsquo;s coming in,</p>
<p>concentrate onto the photo detector and read that light.</p>
<p>And so why is this important?</p>
<p>Why is this interesting?</p>
<p>Well, people get really excited by</p>
<p>and flip out over the cool imagery that they see,</p>
<p>these images, these colorful images of galaxies</p>
<p>and stars far, far away.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re really doing is we&rsquo;re not just looking far away,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking back in time.</p>
<p>So these images come to us from galaxies</p>
<p>that are 4.6 billion light years away.</p>
<p>So it took 4.6 billion years for that light</p>
<p>to reach our planet.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re actually seeing what happened</p>
<p>in the earlier part of the universe.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing how these galaxies formed,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re moving, how they interact with one another,</p>
<p>how the planets interact with one another.</p>
<p>But what a lot of people miss</p>
<p>that I think is the most important thing to highlight,</p>
<p>as an astrophysicist,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking through telescopes</p>
<p>and gathering telescope data,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not looking for imagery like we looked at today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really good to sell the story</p>
<p>and get Biden to do a press conference.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re really looking at is spectrographs.</p>
<p>And a spectrograph is,</p>
<p>it shows for every wavelength of light across some spectrum,</p>
<p>what the intensity is of that amount of light,</p>
<p>that wavelength of light.</p>
<p>And particularly, the James Webb Telescope</p>
<p>has incredible micro shutter arrays</p>
<p>and incredible sensitivity that allows us</p>
<p>to go from near infrared to infrared</p>
<p>and some visible light,</p>
<p>and look at that spectrograph.</p>
<p>Why is that important?</p>
<p>Because if you can capture the spectrograph</p>
<p>in a very high resolution way,</p>
<p>for a sun or for a planet far away,</p>
<p>it can tell you very specifically what the movement is</p>
<p>and what the chemical composition is of that object.</p>
<p>And from that, we can start to do incredible research</p>
<p>and infer very important things</p>
<p>about how planets form, how stars form,</p>
<p>how many places like earth might be out there,</p>
<p>how things are moving,</p>
<p>how much mass or matter there is in the universe.</p>
<p>And there are two very, very big question,</p>
<p>questionable phenomenons in astrophysics right now.</p>
<p>One is called dark energy, one&rsquo;s called dark matter.</p>
<p>Turns out the majority of matter in the universe</p>
<p>is undetectable.</p>
<p>And there also is this really weird energy force</p>
<p>pushing on everything in the universe,</p>
<p>causing the universe to accelerate its expansion.</p>
<p>So the universe is expanding,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s moving away from itself,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not just expanding and slowing down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s expanding and speeding up.</p>
<p>And so having this sort of instrument in space</p>
<p>that allows us to capture in a very high resolution way,</p>
<p>using spectroscopy and other tools that astrophysicists use</p>
<p>and better map out how this is happening</p>
<p>in different parts of the universe</p>
<p>starts to give us a better sense</p>
<p>and allows us to kind of inquire</p>
<p>and start to develop theories around what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>And I want to say one more thing,</p>
<p>because a lot of people think that this stuff</p>
<p>is just so esoteric and it&rsquo;s like super interesting.</p>
<p>Why are we spending $10 billion on this?</p>
<p>Most applied engineering and the technologies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve developed as a species</p>
<p>started out initially as pure research</p>
<p>with no frigging clue where it was going to go to.</p>
<p>Imaging DNA, penicillin, electronics, MRI machines,</p>
<p>so many of these capabilities evolved</p>
<p>from scientists just querying the universe</p>
<p>and asking questions and gathering data.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden they came across something,</p>
<p>developed a theory, built an application of that theory</p>
<p>and a technology emerged</p>
<p>that changed the course of our history as a species.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason to do pure research.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>for us to put $10 billion into a program like this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to discover amazing things with this tool</p>
<p>and it will ultimately hopefully yield advances</p>
<p>for humankind that we cannot even contemplate today.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>Could be energy, right?</p>
<p>I mean, understanding dark matter and dark energy.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And then maybe we can-</p>
<p>Has changed everything in energy, right?</p>
<p>Jake, I&rsquo;ll think about it.</p>
<p>One day there might be a capability</p>
<p>where we say there&rsquo;s a new class of matter</p>
<p>and a new understanding of energy</p>
<p>that we can then apply in some form of physics on earth</p>
<p>that we can do something interesting with.</p>
<p>And we have to be able to query</p>
<p>and understand the universe to do that.</p>
<p>Could we measure-</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Could we measure the matter from Uranus?</p>
<p>Okay, I knew it was coming.</p>
<p>I mean, the Hubble telescope actually,</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here,</p>
<p>it actually told us the age of the universe.</p>
<p>How much dark matter is in Uranus?</p>
<p>Shemot, a lot.</p>
<p>A lot, you&rsquo;re full of it.</p>
<p>But we now know, I mean,</p>
<p>the Hubble told us the rate of expansion of the universe</p>
<p>and it also told us the age of the universe</p>
<p>and we found all these other planets.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>To Freiburg&rsquo;s point about, you know,</p>
<p>looking through the muddy water.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a great visualization.</p>
<p>On the left you have Hubble,</p>
<p>on the right you have Webb.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>And if you slide this, you can just see like</p>
<p>just how crystal clear these images are.</p>
<p>And from my understanding,</p>
<p>we found some number of universes already</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t know just from the first images.</p>
<p>By the way, I want to just give everyone a heads up.</p>
<p>This imagery looks beautiful</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to print out a big one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it behind my frigging desk here</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s so fantastic.</p>
<p>Astrophotography is one of my kind of all time,</p>
<p>you know, favorite forms of art.</p>
<p>But remember, this is imagery that was actually captured</p>
<p>in near infrared and infrared spectra.</p>
<p>And then they converted it to visible light</p>
<p>to make it look cool.</p>
<p>So remember that.</p>
<p>These images, you know,</p>
<p>these clouds, if you were actually there,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually look like that color,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very cool way to visualize the density</p>
<p>and the spectral changes.</p>
<p>Where does this sit for you in terms of your excitement</p>
<p>between the new season of Doctor Who</p>
<p>and the Foundation Series?</p>
<p>Let me give you,</p>
<p>let me just give you guys one more kind of</p>
<p>really interesting.</p>
<p>If you start at our sun and you look at the sun,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super bright.</p>
<p>If you go at the speed of light for four minutes,</p>
<p>you reach the earth</p>
<p>or a couple of minutes, you reach the earth.</p>
<p>Look backwards six minutes or seven minutes,</p>
<p>whatever it is, look back.</p>
<p>And now the sun looks like it does in our sky.</p>
<p>If you go for another couple of minutes,</p>
<p>you end up looking back from Saturn</p>
<p>and the sun starts to look like a star.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how dim it gets.</p>
<p>Now imagine continuing to go at the speed of light</p>
<p>for another hour.</p>
<p>You look back,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hardly be able to differentiate the sun</p>
<p>from the rest of the universe.</p>
<p>Now do that for 4.6 billion years.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re shooting away for 4.6 billion years.</p>
<p>Now look back.</p>
<p>How frigging hard would it be to see anything?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the technical capability we just put into space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built a 20 foot wide mirror</p>
<p>to concentrate the light,</p>
<p>the photons that traveled for 4.6 billion years,</p>
<p>lost all of their density,</p>
<p>lost all of the, you know,</p>
<p>completely dimmed out,</p>
<p>completely diffused.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re capturing a few of them,</p>
<p>run that concentrated way onto a detector</p>
<p>for minutes at a time</p>
<p>and generate this image.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really profound how technically complex this is.</p>
<p>And again, that technical complexity</p>
<p>can ultimately yield other technological tools</p>
<p>that we could use in all sorts of industry.</p>
<p>So I just want to highlight that.</p>
<p>I posted it for you guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible story,</p>
<p>but basically this program was riddled with delays</p>
<p>and things that weren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>And then they put this quiet,</p>
<p>very assuming engineer in charge of it.</p>
<p>And he completely turned the whole thing around.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the most incredible quotes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give him a shout out.</p>
<p>His name is Greg Robinson.</p>
<p>And he turned a $10 billion debacle</p>
<p>into a groundbreaking scientific mission.</p>
<p>This is the quote from the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The quote from the NASA,</p>
<p>the head of NASA&rsquo;s science mission directorate,</p>
<p>Thomas Zurbuchen, says it all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge distance between success and failure</p>
<p>and only a few actions that move you from one to the other.</p>
<p>He said, Greg Robinson worked such wonders</p>
<p>that his boss calls him, quote,</p>
<p>the most effective leader of a mission</p>
<p>I have ever seen in the history of NASA, unquote.</p>
<p>Really incredible.</p>
<p>This project, yeah, the $11 billion project.</p>
<p>Big shout out to Greg Robinson.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this has been going on for,</p>
<p>I guess, 20 years now,</p>
<p>this process of getting this built</p>
<p>and 10 years of really intense building.</p>
<p>What would the next,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll switch over to politics for a quick second</p>
<p>as we wrap up here.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what&rsquo;s the next telescope,</p>
<p>because obviously if we&rsquo;ve gone Hubble to Webb,</p>
<p>what would the next one conceivably look like</p>
<p>and what would the timeline for that?</p>
<p>Is there another one that&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>and then what would that enable?</p>
<p>Because it does feel like if we accelerate this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna really get a deep understanding</p>
<p>of the universe that,</p>
<p>this seems to be accelerating our understanding, correct?</p>
<p>And our technology is obviously accelerating,</p>
<p>so it feels like we could send another one of these out</p>
<p>in the next 10 years</p>
<p>that would dwarf this one&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a lot of telescopes operate</p>
<p>on very different wavelengths</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re meant to kind of pursue different missions.</p>
<p>So, there are some telescopes that are already operational</p>
<p>in kind of the gamma ray spectra,</p>
<p>but really there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we ever talked about this on the show,</p>
<p>but one of the really interesting areas of inquiry</p>
<p>is these gravitational wave detectors.</p>
<p>And there are new, more advanced versions</p>
<p>of those systems starting to come online.</p>
<p>Those are not space-based telescopes,</p>
<p>and we can talk about that another time,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re creating new methods of inquiry</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re not capturing photons, light,</p>
<p>coming from far away.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually capturing the waves of gravity</p>
<p>coming from interactions of matter around the universe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a new way to kind of observe the universe.</p>
<p>Those telescopes represent a new class of inquiry</p>
<p>that was just kind of discovered a few years ago</p>
<p>and proven out,</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s a lot of work going on into that area.</p>
<p>And Friedberg, you had something</p>
<p>you wanted to give a shout out to.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just sent you guys a photo</p>
<p>of a new dog I adopted last week.</p>
<p>Her name is Daisy.</p>
<p>Aw, so cute.</p>
<p>We flew her out from Virginia.</p>
<p>Daisy is one of 4,000 beagles that were rescued</p>
<p>from a facility in Virginia that was shut down by the DOJ.</p>
<p>This facility was investigated by PETA</p>
<p>and the Humane Society,</p>
<p>and they basically shut this facility down.</p>
<p>This is, in the United States,</p>
<p>we only do animal testing on beagles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the only dogs that we do animal testing on</p>
<p>because they can put up with pain</p>
<p>and they have a high tolerance</p>
<p>and a high threshold for pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really awful fact.</p>
<p>We need to change that in the United States.</p>
<p>The FDA does not provide good guidance on this.</p>
<p>So pharma companies, pesticide companies,</p>
<p>makeup companies very often test on beagles.</p>
<p>So this company, you know,</p>
<p>that was operating this beagle facility in Virginia</p>
<p>was shut down for, you know,</p>
<p>ethical issues at their facility.</p>
<p>And the Humane Society took control.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s called InVigo.</p>
<p>Their parent company is publicly traded.</p>
<p>I think that the fact that we test on these beagles</p>
<p>in this country is awful.</p>
<p>We adopted Daisy.</p>
<p>There are 4,000 beagles like Daisy available for adoption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put some links in the show notes here.</p>
<p>People feel free to go and grab them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a long list.</p>
<p>The dog is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s awful we test on dogs in this country.</p>
<p>And I think I urge anyone that has influence with the FDA</p>
<p>to get them to provide better guidance.</p>
<p>This is not the law, it&rsquo;s not required,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t provide good guidance.</p>
<p>And so a lot of companies de facto</p>
<p>and default to testing on beagles</p>
<p>when they really don&rsquo;t need to and shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Freeberg, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredible that you adopted the dog.</p>
<p>I hope all 4,000 get adopted.</p>
<p>How should we do testing?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Look, I think that there&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>ethical lines here, and we can debate those.</p>
<p>This is a good nuanced conversation.</p>
<p>We use mouse models in biology</p>
<p>to explore solutions for human disease.</p>
<p>We use primate models, right?</p>
<p>Which means we use primates.</p>
<p>We use dogs, we use cats, we use mammals.</p>
<p>There are certain things that are obviously not necessary.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to take beagles</p>
<p>and pour tons of Kim Kardashian&rsquo;s newest makeup line</p>
<p>in their eyes to see what happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not required by law,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not about getting some pharmaceutical drug approved.</p>
<p>This is in an area that I&rsquo;m not gonna get into the debate</p>
<p>on exploring and resolving kind of pharmaceutical solutions</p>
<p>and things that can actually treat human disease.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m particularly sensitive to</p>
<p>is when it&rsquo;s not needed.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re taking these animals</p>
<p>and just doing awful things to them,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s no law that requires it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not putting stuff in our bodies,</p>
<p>and this isn&rsquo;t about protecting humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about cover your ass behavior</p>
<p>for makeup companies and pesticide companies</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t need to be doing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what I&rsquo;m addressing.</p>
<p>3,999 beagles to go.</p>
<p>If you adopt one of these beagles, send us a photo</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll share it at the end of next week&rsquo;s program.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me say that, guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important to me.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>And how we treat dogs who are connected to humans</p>
<p>in a very special way,</p>
<p>I think speaks volumes to us as individuals.</p>
<p>Sax, would you like to,</p>
<p>well, on the Biden administration, talk about 2022</p>
<p>or give us an update on Ukraine?</p>
<p>I give you the choices.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like elder abuse at this point.</p>
<p>I mean, I know you&rsquo;re trying to-</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question at all, Ken?</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re trying to tee me up here,</p>
<p>but like, all I can say is 9.1%.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to beat a dead horse at this point.</p>
<p>Can I read you guys something?</p>
<p>And you can tell me,</p>
<p>there were these,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a group called Committee to Unleash Prosperity,</p>
<p>but two researchers, Stephen Moore and John Decker,</p>
<p>this is in the Wall Street Journal article</p>
<p>I posted in the group chat,</p>
<p>the pair studied the resumes</p>
<p>of 68 top executive branch officials</p>
<p>whose work shapes the economy,</p>
<p>from President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen</p>
<p>to White House Special Assistants on Economic Policy.</p>
<p>Quote, average business experience of Biden appointees</p>
<p>is only 2.4 years.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Any fresh-faced 25-year-old on Wall Street</p>
<p>has clocked more private business hours,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m reading from the journal article,</p>
<p>than most of Washington&rsquo;s top officials.</p>
<p>62% have, quote, virtually no business experience, unquote.</p>
<p>And we could add Bloomberg-</p>
<p>By contrast, the average Donald Trump cabinet official</p>
<p>had 13 years of experience in the private economy,</p>
<p>the authors say.</p>
<p>What a disaster.</p>
<p>60, 70% of Democrats wanna get rid of Biden,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want him to run again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a president been defected on,</p>
<p>been turned on by his own party</p>
<p>so quickly into an administration.</p>
<p>He needs to take back ownership of the Democratic Party,</p>
<p>which means he has to pivot back to the center,</p>
<p>and he needs to have a wholesale replacement</p>
<p>of the team that he works with on domestic policy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>And Chamath, that was his pitch,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go back to normalcy,</p>
<p>he was gonna be more of a centrist,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;ve gotten,</p>
<p>but of course he was handed the disastrous economy</p>
<p>that Trump created.</p>
<p>Why do you say he was handed a disastrous economy, per se?</p>
<p>Well, because of COVID,</p>
<p>and because of the massive stimulus that we spent,</p>
<p>those two things.</p>
<p>That was like a setup.</p>
<p>I mean, if Trump won a second,</p>
<p>do you think it would be much different?</p>
<p>If Trump was running the economy,</p>
<p>with the setup was there.</p>
<p>Trump probably would have spent more money, right?</p>
<p>Trump wanted to spend more money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good question, actually.</p>
<p>I have to think through that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the update on Ukraine?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really interesting chess game going on right now,</p>
<p>where the Russians are slowing the flow of gas.</p>
<p>No, no, no, it&rsquo;s better than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than that.</p>
<p>They shut down Nord Stream One</p>
<p>for their annual maintenance.</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be back up by July 21st.</p>
<p>And so the real question is,</p>
<p>what happens if Putin hand checks Europe</p>
<p>and just takes an extra day or two</p>
<p>to get that thing back up and going?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me make a prediction.</p>
<p>I think the Western alliance is gonna fracture</p>
<p>come this winter.</p>
<p>Yeah, Germany&rsquo;s gonna be freezing.</p>
<p>The Germans are not gonna take this well</p>
<p>when they can&rsquo;t put their heat on.</p>
<p>Listen, a foreign policy based on virtue signaling</p>
<p>is one thing when your economy is good</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not worried about your energy security</p>
<p>and you can heat your homes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another thing to have a foreign policy</p>
<p>based on virtue signaling</p>
<p>when your economy is in recession,</p>
<p>you got runaway inflation,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in winter and you can&rsquo;t heat your homes.</p>
<p>Your morals change real quick, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Three or four months ago,</p>
<p>the liberal interventionists were triumphant</p>
<p>about this Ukraine war.</p>
<p>There are three big predictions.</p>
<p>One, that Ukraine was gonna win.</p>
<p>It looked like Ukraine was winning</p>
<p>the first couple of weeks,</p>
<p>but now it looks like Russia has won this Donbass region.</p>
<p>Number two, they predicted that we would collapse</p>
<p>the Russian economy with all these sanctions.</p>
<p>The opposite&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve collapsed our own economy.</p>
<p>And number three, they predicted this would strengthen</p>
<p>the Western alliance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only card that hasn&rsquo;t basically turned yet.</p>
<p>And I think it will this winter.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna see serious opposition</p>
<p>to the way the Biden administration</p>
<p>has led the Western response.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s well said that if Germany</p>
<p>has the gas lines that Sri Lanka had,</p>
<p>you would see a definite fracturing</p>
<p>of how people look at it,</p>
<p>just like they flipped last week</p>
<p>and they made natural gas and nukes,</p>
<p>nuclear power, a green energy.</p>
<p>So yeah, their morals and ethics</p>
<p>and their virtue signaling go as far as their wallets</p>
<p>and their heat and meals go.</p>
<p>As we all know, this has been another amazing episode</p>
<p>of the All In podcast for the baron of beagles,</p>
<p>the dictator himself and the rain man.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely Biden&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Now there is no chance for any of us</p>
<p>to pass Fribourg on the popularity.</p>
<p>He just sealed the deal with his fucking beagle thing.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna save a whale next week.</p>
<p>I am gonna bring a dolphin that I kill myself.</p>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re gonna prepare a dolphin sashimi?</p>
<p>Okay, great, that&rsquo;ll secure your part</p>
<p>as the most hated bestie.</p>
