    <p>Alright next up</p>
<p>Joe Lonsdale</p>
<p>We go Joe Lonsdale is gonna come up. He&rsquo;s gonna tee it up for about five or ten minutes in a solo dolo</p>
<p>He told me he&rsquo;s burning the house down</p>
<p>Well hello, Miami, it&rsquo;s good to be here from Austin for a day, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>The second second best tech city here. It&rsquo;s not too bad. How many people actually are in live in Miami?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to the crowd we&rsquo;ve been over that so everyone&rsquo;s flown in town like me. That&rsquo;s pretty cool</p>
<p>Well, you know, I&rsquo;m generally an American optimist</p>
<p>But I want to talk about a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s broken right now that we know how to fix</p>
<p>But we aren&rsquo;t and you know talking to these guys, especially hearing from Elon everyone today</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so exciting what our civilization is going towards what it could be doing</p>
<p>But if you talk to a lot of our smartest friends, you know, you look at guys like Dahlia or Bridgewater and others</p>
<p>You know, they see America in decline. They see decadence. They see decay and I think there&rsquo;s a lot of important questions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m facing right now. Like why do these happen to a civilization?</p>
<p>What why when there&rsquo;s so many exciting things going on that we know can make a really great future</p>
<p>You know for our kids and grandkids and for humanity. Why is this stuff breaking and I want to tell you a little story</p>
<p>Policy group in Austin and we have you know</p>
<p>We follow the homeless population there and we were going along with a middle-aged Mexican gentleman</p>
<p>Who had just lost his job and he went into the homeless center</p>
<p>I was just really struggling and he says, you know, I really want to try to find a job</p>
<p>I want some job training and though and the in the person working there. She says, you know, sir, you deserve a home</p>
<p>He said yeah, that&rsquo;s great. But you know, what can I get some training?</p>
<p>She said you don&rsquo;t need to worry about that</p>
<p>you need to worry about getting a home for people just like you what you deserve and</p>
<p>And I want to back up about the situation in Austin because we&rsquo;re seeing this all over the country right now</p>
<p>You know in 2018 the mayor of Austin went to San Francisco in LA and and you know</p>
<p>He was asking him for advice. I want to do for homelessness. There wasn&rsquo;t really homelessness downtown. It&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>This is funny to me, too</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s actually a reason he&rsquo;s asked him for advice and it&rsquo;s a special interest thing</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s actually hundreds of millions of funding that goes to these groups in SF and LA that work on this into all of their</p>
<p>friends and all the people with their politics and it&rsquo;s a huge money spigot for</p>
<p>Politicians is they&rsquo;re very powerful in those other cities and Austin they didn&rsquo;t have that money spigot and he wanted it and you know</p>
<p>You know what? They told him I heard this from both sides</p>
<p>He said, you know, you have to show people that capitalism doesn&rsquo;t work. You got put in their faces</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll get funding and he went back to Austin and he brought all the camps downtown</p>
<p>Homeless death spiked homeless trafficking spike sex trafficking spike drug spike, but the funding went way up for him and his friends</p>
<p>They got massive new funding, you know unaccountable sources of money for these people and and and then and then of course</p>
<p>They start deploying the answers, which is the housing first strategy. And by the way, this is not just like a right versus left thing</p>
<p>I think housing first was first deployed under W Bush. So this is this is a general strategy</p>
<p>You guys probably know in LA they spend $800,000 per new home trying to solve this problem</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 7,000 nonprofits right now, you know funded by HUD around our country with the same philosophy and the philosophy is no pay for performance</p>
<p>No transparency, no accountability just build the homes and you know when I first heard about this a decade ago</p>
<p>I thought wow that makes sense. There&rsquo;s 5,000 homeless people. Let&rsquo;s build 5,000 homes</p>
<p>It turns out that there&rsquo;s still about a couple percent of our society that really don&rsquo;t have a home</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re living kind of on the edge on people&rsquo;s couches with other family with friends</p>
<p>So the actual demand for homes and it turns out maybe it&rsquo;s about six million ten million. It&rsquo;s effectively infinite</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s infinite demand for homes in our society. And who do you think gets these homes when we build them?</p>
<p>So so this guy we&rsquo;re following, you know</p>
<p>A few hundred people with my philanthropy group and our team goes back in with them</p>
<p>And he gets in line and he&rsquo;s been living between a camp that they helped him set up in downtown and</p>
<p>In a relative&rsquo;s house, but he&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s living outside in a camp and he goes back and he&rsquo;s just missed getting a home and he&rsquo;s frustrated</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re explaining the point system and he says wait a second</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that if I was on drugs, I&rsquo;d qualify for a home and they said well</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like to say it that way, but that&rsquo;s true. And he says you&rsquo;re saying if I committed a crime</p>
<p>I qualify for a home and they&rsquo;re like, well, yeah, but that&rsquo;s that. Yeah</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like to say it that way, but that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>That would have given you enough points to qualify for a home and and and and what happens here if you try to bait this system</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s you know, 7,000 of these groups around around the country</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re screamed at as a racist. You&rsquo;re screamed at with ad hominem attacks. There&rsquo;s three things one</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not the intellectual humility to see that there may be other answers and may be correct</p>
<p>two there&rsquo;s no respect for the dignity of everyone in this conversations if you disagree, you are a bad person and</p>
<p>Three there&rsquo;s no passion for the truth. These people are not trying to pursue the truth</p>
<p>These people already have the truth and they&rsquo;re giving it to you as a dogma</p>
<p>And this is true of pretty much every of these broken areas in our society and there&rsquo;s a lot of them</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of them right now. There&rsquo;s like we you know, we have 50 trading programs</p>
<p>That we spend a lot of money on the federal government. They&rsquo;re not accountable. They don&rsquo;t tend to work. They&rsquo;re very broken</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no transparency. There&rsquo;s no competition. There&rsquo;s no debate</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re for it or against it and you&rsquo;re a bad person if you&rsquo;re against it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s these vocational schools around the country, Texas vocational schools were really underperforming seven years ago and</p>
<p>You know what we did is we ended up actually changing them so that the schools were only going to be funded based on the</p>
<p>Salaries of the students coming out if you tie it to graduation rates doesn&rsquo;t work because they can graduate everyone</p>
<p>We tied to the salaries coming out</p>
<p>We got the vote we got the salaries coming out to go up a hundred seventeen percent just by putting in that accountability</p>
<p>But but most of the country doesn&rsquo;t do that. Most of the country there&rsquo;s vocational schools people go very low graduation rates. They fail</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to go into the k-12 issues you guys know about but one fact most people don&rsquo;t know is the education</p>
<p>Inequality in this country is far greater than the wealth inequality</p>
<p>Far greater so so there&rsquo;s I mean, you know, and you guys probably see there&rsquo;s an infant formula production thing</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a crisis right now</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really basic policy mistakes around that the way we run our prisons our probation and parole</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of ways to run a much better. We&rsquo;re not doing it though</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll give you one other example because Elon was speaking today Austin infrastructure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited about his boring company and you know</p>
<p>They on Austin we passed the six billion seven billion dollar plan to build really small amount of infrastructure</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already ballooning cost of 12 billion, you know for less than half the original money for three billion dollars</p>
<p>You could do over a hundred times as many</p>
<p>as many tunnels in terms of what they&rsquo;re building right now and and you and you do it, you know with</p>
<p>100 more stations and so basically for a tiny fraction of the cost and again</p>
<p>I go and talk to the city and talk to the guys. There&rsquo;s no intellectual humility</p>
<p>The you know, we don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s no they don&rsquo;t respect your dignity. Elon&rsquo;s a bad guy</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t like Elon whatever because they&rsquo;re there&rsquo;s some kind of extreme version and</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not interested in the truth and they&rsquo;re really not they&rsquo;re just interested in like what they&rsquo;re gonna do it their way and</p>
<p>So can you kind of come back to this? Like what&rsquo;s going on in our society?</p>
<p>Where is this coming from? And you know say what causes decadence decay and decline?</p>
<p>I think the more important question is what actually works like why is our society functional?</p>
<p>And yeah, I think this you have to take it back to the Enlightenment, right?</p>
<p>I mean this if you look at the exponential growth that&rsquo;s happened that&rsquo;s created the wealth and all of us enjoy</p>
<p>It really happened over the last few centuries</p>
<p>Kind of post-enlightenment and and you had a society that really cared about pursuit of the truth really cared about</p>
<p>Competition of ideas, right?</p>
<p>I mean and you need the virtues for this to work right the classical virtues that we talked about our civilization</p>
<p>Justice wisdom temperance courage. You need the courage to actually fight for the truth</p>
<p>And so what a long time ago you tended to have religious dogma</p>
<p>Which could be some form of virtue signaling some sort of some form of you know</p>
<p>Basically keeping out outsiders and then you had separately debate and substance and debate and substance generally lost</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s religious dogma and what was unique about the Enlightenment was unique about our university system</p>
<p>Which we which we created was the liberal universities were a place to have debates where substance could actually win</p>
<p>Against you know dogma and against you know</p>
<p>People who people who disagree you actually had to disagree civilly and you actually had to pursue truth</p>
<p>You had the intellectual humility to know that you don&rsquo;t have all the answers</p>
<p>You had to respect the dignity of people who are debating and you had to fight for a passion for the truth</p>
<p>And and what&rsquo;s happened instead is that most of our universities have been conquered by dogma and by religion</p>
<p>That they no longer have these things. So once again, we have the idea of heretics and blasphemy</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t call that we don&rsquo;t use those words</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re facing right now</p>
<p>If you disagree with people you&rsquo;re a heretic and you&rsquo;re committing blasphemy if you speak against all sorts of these things</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to speak against if you say that</p>
<p>DEI is actually causing problems. If you say that here&rsquo;s what ESG is wrong. That&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s blasphemous</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not this isn&rsquo;t your stuff. You&rsquo;re not allowed to attack these days. You&rsquo;re in trouble</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re told not speak against it again or else you&rsquo;re fired</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been written about lots of corporations right now</p>
<p>This happens all sorts of people and this is happening first and foremost on our campus. What&rsquo;s happened is this is zero-sum</p>
<p>Historically illiterate and tolerant virtue signaling religion has completely taken over and is silencing people and you know</p>
<p>Our founders our founders were we&rsquo;re quite fond of heretics</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people realize that but that was kind of the equivalent debate</p>
<p>300 years ago to this to this woke religion is that Benjamin Franklin?</p>
<p>He said I think all heretics I have known have been virtuous men</p>
<p>They have the virtue of courage or they wouldn&rsquo;t venture their heresy</p>
<p>They cannot afford to be deficient in other virtues do the numerous</p>
<p>Enemies they provoke and so, you know, I think thinking what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>All of us first of all need to go back and think about like where where do we not have enough humility to try to learn</p>
<p>More where where we not respecting people who disagree and actually engaging them and debating them as opposed to calling them names running them off</p>
<p>And frankly, I think we should also remember. It&rsquo;s actually really good to be offended</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the opposite of safe spaces. There&rsquo;s this weird cultural thing with the millennial generation</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m barely part of it unfortunately where you&rsquo;re basically supposed to protect people from being offended</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to protect them from blasphemy. I think it has to be the opposite if our civilization is not going to decline</p>
<p>I think we actually have to go out of our way to learn that when we&rsquo;re offended we have to be stronger</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re somehow like elevated as a victim if you&rsquo;re offended</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your problem if you&rsquo;re offended and you just stop and think about it and we need to use that to advance our civilization again</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my that&rsquo;s my save for today</p>
<p>G Jason wanted me to add a bunch more blasphemy, but I&rsquo;m gonna hold off on that. I think you did enough</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk let&rsquo;s chop it up get in here. Let&rsquo;s talk about why people feel like they&rsquo;re victims</p>
<p>What do you think in our country?</p>
<p>make certain people feel</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;ve been victimized</p>
<p>What are the valid reasons people might feel that they have gotten a raw deal in America?</p>
<p>I mean, I think all of our ancestors have gone through this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jewish and Irish</p>
<p>There was when my ancestors came over there were signs saying no dogs are Irish allowed</p>
<p>my grandfather was only promoted to a certain level at Abbott because he was a Jew actually realized it hired a Jew and they</p>
<p>They laughed and said oops. That was a mistake. You can only get to this level</p>
<p>Yeah, and so I mean, I think I think there has been some pretty horrible things everywhere in the world</p>
<p>Frankly, I want you not just America. I think everywhere you look there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s always been groups that have been treated pretty badly</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Irish as well</p>
<p>Irish need not apply. Yep</p>
<p>We had a pretty horrific famine and I&rsquo;m like and then and it&rsquo;s obviously a lot easier to be Irish than it is to be</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s black in America, I think or Jewish and the Holocaust. Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. Different people&rsquo;s experiences are on a spectrum of the suffering, correct? 100% and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>People who&rsquo;ve suffered more deserve a little more empathy and perhaps a little bit more</p>
<p>Consideration they deserve more empathy, but doesn&rsquo;t mean you should embrace</p>
<p>philosophies that are wrong or harmful, right so I mean if you look at the</p>
<p>Obviously like there&rsquo;s a lot of truth and positive parts of the BLM movement the last couple years</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually led to thousands more deaths in the black community</p>
<p>Because of the things that it was pushing because of the bad ideas. We got another one of these things</p>
<p>How many more of these do we got to do</p>
<p>This is like way more work than I thought I was signing up for way more work someone get this man a drink</p>
<p>We should have had cocktails I never agreed to be in the conference business when we started doing this pod</p>
<p>Shake out. I respect you for what you&rsquo;ve been able to do</p>
<p>But this is way too much work. You guys said you wanted to do a look at you know</p>
<p>All these fans are here that you&rsquo;re doing the Q&amp;A tomorrow. Okay, sounds good. I think you know Joe</p>
<p>Candidly I think that is where the argument breaks down a bit is</p>
<p>People have had different experiences, and I would</p>
<p>Disagree that people have to stop thinking like victims. I think sometimes</p>
<p>We have to think very deeply about the suffering people have had especially when it&rsquo;s different than the suffering that you and I have had</p>
<p>But that that is so it&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m not virtue signaling here. I&rsquo;m just countering</p>
<p>I think that I think that&rsquo;s fully true what I was really against is I gave ten examples of</p>
<p>Ways in which our society is broken and hurting poor people hurting working-class people</p>
<p>Like this wasting money on things in a dysfunctional ways and all of that is happening</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re like going to this illiberal society where we&rsquo;re not able to actually like debate things logically sure and respect</p>
<p>Respect other people on the other side of the argument. It&rsquo;s all about demonizing people who disagree with us</p>
<p>Yeah, right, and I think that&rsquo;s just really really scary right now. Do you?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a website people have tweeted this I think it&rsquo;s the website is called what the fuck happened in</p>
<p>1971 calm you know what I&rsquo;m talking about where yeah, if you go to this website</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know so in 19 say if you look back socio-economically</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of charts and graphs of everything from GDP to you know labor participation rates, etc</p>
<p>and there is a moment in</p>
<p>1971 where just trend lines break and</p>
<p>you know Dorsey tweeted this out a little while ago a</p>
<p>Bunch of people talk about it and everybody has tried to figure out what actually happened</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s a couple there&rsquo;s a couple really good explanations</p>
<p>I think right so I think I think it&rsquo;s you biggest ones</p>
<p>I think the two biggest ones by far is one is tech driven globalization</p>
<p>And the other one is going off the gold currency which over financialized the economy so I think the gold currency one was important</p>
<p>I think the one that people don&rsquo;t talk about whether you agree with it or not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your perspective is you know the move to the Great Society had a whole bunch of</p>
<p>Things that I think were meant to do</p>
<p>Meaningful good and I broke down the family as well, which is a huge problem in America</p>
<p>Then this is yeah, so I mean you talk about things that make civilization</p>
<p>Prosper I think you get the classical virtues and you get a strong families</p>
<p>Which by the way for whatever reason I still can&rsquo;t tell BLM was strongly against which I think is like just horrible</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a problem in the white community as well by the way</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like almost half kids are born out of wedlock right now</p>
<p>And if you statistically look at that those kids just on average vastly underperformed</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean to say there&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t one-off cases</p>
<p>And you should get divorced if it&rsquo;s the right thing to do but but but it but it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s really bad for</p>
<p>Society as a whole statistically you can&rsquo;t argue against that and exactly we&rsquo;ve actually created the incentives towards divorce in the 1960s</p>
<p>Which it obviously wasn&rsquo;t intentional, but this is a huge problem. You&rsquo;re not supposed to talk about it. It&rsquo;s like a conservative thing I guess</p>
<p>And talk about the the financialization and moving off the gold standard as well. How did that change socio-economic dynamics in America?</p>
<p>Well, basically it mean is so there&rsquo;s like a lot more</p>
<p>Money around and so I think I think it over it put more returns into finance</p>
<p>So I got a benefit from this is do you for as an investor?</p>
<p>So but but making things yeah</p>
<p>I think I think I think it put more returns into finance and because there&rsquo;s this explosion of</p>
<p>Credit and money relative to so I think finance outperformed</p>
<p>Labor in terms of it&rsquo;s an advantage for finance, which is not what you necessarily want it</p>
<p>Really really helped accelerate tech term globalization</p>
<p>Which probably was good for India and China and Southeast Asia and even Africa?</p>
<p>But it basically forced workers in the u.s. To compete against all these people directly</p>
<p>And so you had people paid like 15 times as much in the u.s. These other people and and and then and it wasn&rsquo;t sustainable</p>
<p>So over time these other people&rsquo;s out competed that you fish over the last 50 years, which is really tough</p>
<p>You find it hard to find</p>
<p>Your tribe in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, intellectually has it become easier or harder the same, you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just given up on like having even a tribe so much is like let&rsquo;s work on this together</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually make prisons have lower recidivism and higher employment and here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re gonna do it</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna put these transparency and accountability</p>
<p>Incentives and it&rsquo;s hard for anyone to really disagree with that unless you&rsquo;re running the prisons union</p>
<p>And so like we got it. We&rsquo;re getting all these laws passed from probation and parole and that we&rsquo;re getting all these laws passed</p>
<p>Educational school work better. Yeah, and what&rsquo;s annoys me Chamath is that I feel like as people who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>Succeeded we all sort of have a duty to go and fix these problems and almost no one else is working on that</p>
<p>That does annoy me</p>
<p>and then in terms of like for example</p>
<p>I want to talk specifically because you mentioned higher ed, but if you go a little bit before this</p>
<p>We have no real form of competition in the school system. Yes</p>
<p>you need some mechanism for good ideas to win and bad ideas to lose and and the</p>
<p>The existing framework has been charter schools</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s been attacked</p>
<p>under every, you know sort of way shape or form how</p>
<p>How does that problem get solved? How do we get kids?</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>So the problem if you just give everybody choice right now and you give them say funding take the money where they want</p>
<p>It basically defunds the public schools, which then hurts the poor kids the most</p>
<p>And so I understand why people are against like total choice for everyone. It&rsquo;s kind of just kind of more like policy detail</p>
<p>I think the way to get around that is you just give the poor kids choice</p>
<p>So if you just give the poor kids choice, and now it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just doing it to help them but even them being able to choose will put pressure and get rid of the hurt the bad</p>
<p>Schools and help the good schools. So you see some mechanism</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do the mechanism through the poor kids that helps them most that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s my view. It seems actually like a reasonable</p>
<p>Argument is right. Yeah, because why shouldn&rsquo;t the I mean my kids have choice where to go with my wife and I why shouldn&rsquo;t poor</p>
<p>Kids have that choice</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s things that she&rsquo;s using gonna hate that but at least it&rsquo;s a way to kind of kind of maybe build support</p>
<p>And is there a way for unions to to actually do the the part of the job, which is about protecting workers with?</p>
<p>but disentangle some of the financial incentives to</p>
<p>Aggregate, you know dues participate actively. You just gotta change the power structure right now. They&rsquo;re totally in charge</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to give an inch I get it because every time they give an inch they&rsquo;re gonna lose more power later on</p>
<p>If they see that they&rsquo;re losing some battles, then they then they have to negotiate and they&rsquo;re gonna be more reasonable</p>
<p>They say oh, yeah, you&rsquo;re right. We&rsquo;re gonna get rid of the bottom 20%</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna you know, you gotta get to a point where the power change is enough that they&rsquo;re willing to then work with you</p>
<p>But I but I mean the bigger the bigger thing I think is</p>
<p>We actually need leaders</p>
<p>Who are courageous?</p>
<p>Who could speak up about problems and in the midst of everyone yelling and screaming and saying you&rsquo;re not supposed to say things to say</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t care, but you&rsquo;re not supposed to say this is my version of the truth</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s gonna be the best in society and what we&rsquo;re teaching at universities right now is the opposite of that</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re teaching is Joe just don&rsquo;t say that Joe. Why are you causing problems for yourself Joe?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re not supposed to talk about these things and I&rsquo;m so sick of it because like this is why all this stuff&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because no one&rsquo;s speaking up you bought a college</p>
<p>My my friends Barry Weiss and Neil Ferguson and I along with a bunch of others are starting a new university in Austin</p>
<p>Yes, did you buy an existing university?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just starting from a clean. We got five. We got 500 acres in the water. It&rsquo;s really pretty</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 15 minutes from the Tesla giant Tesla plant about 30 minutes from downtown</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re gonna build you teach what would the majors be and what will be the approach?</p>
<p>You know the the hypothesis, you know as entrepreneurs</p>
<p>Our job is to find these gaps in the world where something should exist</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t and it seems like for the first time in a few generations</p>
<p>You could actually build a university that competes with the other very top</p>
<p>universities and attracts the very</p>
<p>You know most talented kids one of my obnoxious views on this which I think the stage might</p>
<p>Might agree with just because it&rsquo;s our direction is</p>
<p>That used to be the smartest people in the world a lot of them became professors and now you get a lot of very smart</p>
<p>People becoming innovators becoming builders like my smartest friends</p>
<p>I got to drop out of their PhDs from MIT and Stanford and Caltech</p>
<p>Actually found more intellectual expression and satisfaction, you know in the entrepreneurship world than they did there</p>
<p>And so therefore in order to compete, you know, you want not only the top professors</p>
<p>But you want to involve a lot of top innovators and you know</p>
<p>We want to teach you want to teach the history of thought and in the free civilizations</p>
<p>You want to actually see like like how the alignment come about?</p>
<p>What were the books or the debates that people were having when they&rsquo;re found in the country and kind of kind of learn that core?</p>
<p>And then we also want to have centers where you keep it interdisciplinary. It was one of the key things universities</p>
<p>This is again somewhat technical but they&rsquo;re broken because you get these departments to get conquered by a certain ideology</p>
<p>So you get certain people to only allow people who think like them to be in those departments</p>
<p>So you want to you want to spread it out keep it or just how much how much of this is because of tenure?</p>
<p>Tenant tenure is a big problem. You want to have some protection and potential tenure would originally was a great thing</p>
<p>Protected you to say what you want and practice now. It&rsquo;s usually it&rsquo;s usually the other way around and it&rsquo;s pretty and yeah</p>
<p>It was not good. Yeah</p>
<p>But yeah, no, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a huge gap there</p>
<p>I think we could fix it and my goal obviously is not to have everyone educated through one great university</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to put pressure on other universities to change and to help build multiple new ones</p>
<p>Which I think we need to do and the school that you start</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary by nature, which means that not necessarily known as for technical people for math</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be like a center of like political economy in history. There&rsquo;ll be a center of</p>
<p>Data science and innovation and you know, etc. They&rsquo;ll be at centers, you know, you know arts and writing and stuff</p>
<p>So I think you want difference there are different skills. I think everyone should get the kind of core</p>
<p>Is this for profit or so? You know, it&rsquo;s nonprofit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably it&rsquo;s part of me wishes</p>
<p>I made it for profit because I need to make money because it&rsquo;s be easier to raise money for it</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve raised about a hundred million dollars nonprofit for it. We have the land so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s gonna work</p>
<p>I put my name on it. So I&rsquo;ll pay for raised a hundred million dollars for this. Yeah</p>
<p>When do you plan on opening it fall 2024 is our goal for the first class be about the size of Caltech at first is</p>
<p>the hope</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty ambitious project</p>
<p>Yeah, well a country our country needs some some more leaders right now who are courageous and not a thing how do you</p>
<p>How do you how do you how do you think you&rsquo;ll recruit the first class?</p>
<p>How do you yeah, you want you want to do much more active recruiting than most of our top colleges right now</p>
<p>Especially because we won&rsquo;t be as known at first, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what</p>
<p>We have a seminar this summer of 80 kids and we have 44,000 inquiries from kids about it</p>
<p>We have you know</p>
<p>When we first the first two weeks after the story was out on Twitter in November that we&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>We have four thousand four hundred professors apply because these professors are fleeing a lot of the professors by the way</p>
<p>A lot of them on the moderate left</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being attacked by the extremes for again talking and say about and saying things</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not supposed to talk about and say and so so a lot of them are trying to flee to other environments</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge demand for it right now. It&rsquo;s super weird that</p>
<p>college kids yeah are</p>
<p>Against having debates and it&rsquo;s gotten so much worse</p>
<p>I just find it so weird like that was like one of the best</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a car. I mean, I haven&rsquo;t been in college in the last five years. You just gotten totally crazy like that</p>
<p>We had a woman of press a really smart woman, you know</p>
<p>Definitely on the left, but like she was applying from NYU law school asking us</p>
<p>Are we gonna do a new law school because you can&rsquo;t stand that anymore and we say well what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>She said well, for example</p>
<p>We used to use the Socratic method in my law school and I would ask tough questions from both sides of the kids and now</p>
<p>in order not to trigger people I have to write them an email a week ahead of time to make sure I can ask the</p>
<p>Question and then I&rsquo;m gonna ask in class next week. So if you were to ask lawyer, this is the train a lawyer</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just this is this is where we are at this point. So just like that&rsquo;s NYU law. This is NYU</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the policy of NYU. I think we got a bigger cycle. I don&rsquo;t know but like this is this</p>
<p>Our universities have just gone crazy the last five years. Like yeah, is that an isolated incident or no?</p>
<p>Yeah, y&rsquo;all has more administrators and students</p>
<p>These administrators are on the whole more likely to be neo-marxist than to be than to be Republicans</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like these things have gotten very extreme</p>
<p>What do you think sex?</p>
<p>About</p>
<p>You ever think you&rsquo;ll get this bad when you know about the university and you know, I mean you lived at a time</p>
<p>I mean the time at Stanford was a pretty bold time when you were there in terms of freedom of speech in terms of</p>
<p>Debate vibrancy. Yeah, what basically happened is all those radicals are being inculcated and trained and brainwashed at Stanford that we were reacting to</p>
<p>What if 25 30 years ago they all graduated and then they went off into society and took over all these institutions</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem we have today</p>
<p>Matt Taibbi and Glenn Greenwald were talking about earlier today where if you actually look at polling the biggest divide in America in terms</p>
<p>Of political and cultural beliefs is whether or not you have a college degree</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re basically a college graduate your member of the professional class if you&rsquo;re not a college graduate</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a member of the working class. That is the biggest divide and</p>
<p>You know the the members of the professional class by and large have very very far-left</p>
<p>Views on socio-cultural issues. That&rsquo;s just a fact. I mean whether you agree with it or not</p>
<p>And that is creating a huge amount of tension in our society because two-thirds of the country is working class. One-third is</p>
<p>Professional class and in a democracy the side that has the larger number should win</p>
<p>so the working class has the votes, but the professional class runs all the institutions and</p>
<p>This is the source</p>
<p>I think of all our political strife in America is that the people who are in charge of our institutions from the New York Times</p>
<p>to the Washington Post to the fortune 500 Disney</p>
<p>Hollywood and you go down the list</p>
<p>They have views that are fundamentally in tension and in conflict</p>
<p>With the views of most of the country the working class of the country now if you&rsquo;re a member of that class</p>
<p>You may think it&rsquo;s a good thing. We&rsquo;re gonna push our views</p>
<p>Onto the country whether they like it or not, and we&rsquo;re gonna convert them. That&rsquo;s what you call the elite class, right?</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the elite and</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what basically now I like what I&rsquo;m describing is not like a criticism</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just like I think this is a factual critique of what&rsquo;s happening. Well, yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s partisan either</p>
<p>I mean there there are people who are</p>
<p>Republicans or Democrats and both there are elites there are elites in both parties and there are certainly working-class people in both parties</p>
<p>but what I would say is that the parties are now in the process of</p>
<p>resorting around this sort of political and cultural divide and</p>
<p>Historically the Democrats were the party of the working class. They are now much more the party of the professional class</p>
<p>and they buy into the belief set of</p>
<p>Sort of the college educated the you know, those sort of you call it the woke</p>
<p>Sensibility and the Republicans are in the process of transforming into a working-class sort of populist party</p>
<p>Yeah, and and look there are in both parties are outliers who don&rsquo;t quite fit in anymore</p>
<p>But but that&rsquo;s the fundamental transformation that&rsquo;s happening. Yeah, I mean you guys fit into that your people in the</p>
<p>Republican Party who don&rsquo;t fit in it anymore</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even necessarily mind that dynamic you described so much if they weren&rsquo;t breaking everything and if they weren&rsquo;t not allowing</p>
<p>Conversations about how broken things are and the better ideas, right? It&rsquo;s just a very strange illiberal</p>
<p>So I think and I just connect it with what we were talking about with Glenn, you know</p>
<p>Greenwald and Tybee is that look if if you&rsquo;re part of the elite and you control all these institutions all the</p>
<p>Cultural high ground but the country is not with you and just in terms of the sheer numbers</p>
<p>You are gonna use the tactics that people in power always use to suppress the greater numbers</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where censorship comes from the people who are running these institutions. Don&rsquo;t they want the debate to be over?</p>
<p>They want the power to end the debate</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re not otherwise gonna win that debate</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re very interested in seeing where you take it and</p>
<p>We appreciate you taking the time to share your views</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Know</p>
