    <p>hi friends so yes you read the title right but this is not gonna be an</p>
<p>episode of me just reading the absolute shit out of you why nobody likes you</p>
<p>nobody wants you nobody chooses you this is gonna be an episode about the</p>
<p>awareness that I&rsquo;ve gained recently and y&rsquo;all this shit hit me in the face like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hitting the face a lot but this motherfucker rocked me okay like</p>
<p>ko this awareness about like took me out but I&rsquo;m gonna break it all down and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try and make it useful for you guys too it&rsquo;s not about what&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>with you it&rsquo;s just about what&rsquo;s wrong with what you&rsquo;re doing but one thing to</p>
<p>get is you cannot make someone care about you you cannot control if someone</p>
<p>cares about you or not but there&rsquo;s a lot of shit you might be doing that prevents</p>
<p>people from caring about you or makes them not want to care about you and a</p>
<p>big thing with that is safety if someone feels like it is unsafe to care about</p>
<p>you they will hold the fuck back from that okay so let&rsquo;s get serious for a</p>
<p>second because I have to do my Pisces cry boo-hoo cry cry shit and then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get into like breaking down the awareness but my whole life I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>been the one that cares more like when it comes to people when it comes to</p>
<p>relationships especially when it comes to liking someone or even with</p>
<p>friendships like I always just feel like I&rsquo;m the one that&rsquo;s more connected to</p>
<p>them than they are to me I&rsquo;m always the one that cares more and that fucking</p>
<p>shit hurts that&rsquo;s a pain that I&rsquo;m tired of fucking experiencing you know like</p>
<p>when the fuck is someone gonna like like me as much not even more just as much as</p>
<p>I like them like I&rsquo;m scared the day that that happens though cuz bitch I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>ready to kill for anybody like once I care about you I will do anything for</p>
<p>you like you&rsquo;re gonna leave me I&rsquo;ll kill you but if you need me to kill for you I</p>
<p>will I&rsquo;ve got you like I&rsquo;ll protect you at all fucking costs but yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just something I&rsquo;ve always dealt with it&rsquo;s feeling like I&rsquo;m always the one</p>
<p>that cares more and I realized how much this has fucked me up and this is what I</p>
<p>want to break down because experiencing this has made me treat people a certain</p>
<p>way like if you&rsquo;re the one that always cares more you&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna get hurt more so you&rsquo;re never just gonna like open the fuck up like who</p>
<p>does that like when you care a whole bunch who the fuck just like lets their</p>
<p>ego down and expresses that not me bitch I got a fat old ego so this game that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing I realized has been what is preventing me from feeling</p>
<p>cared about feeling like I&rsquo;m always the one that cares more makes me hold back</p>
<p>how much I care like I don&rsquo;t let the person know like I would never let</p>
<p>someone know how much I truly care for them how special they were to me and how</p>
<p>much I actually valued them like if I didn&rsquo;t feel like they liked me back I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t ever like express how much I did care like I would just care silently</p>
<p>and just get my feelings hurt but the main reason behind this is because I</p>
<p>would be scared that if I shared how much I truly did care that they would</p>
<p>get comfortable and relax like I want to feel special I want to feel like you</p>
<p>care about me and whenever I&rsquo;ve in the past let people have me like you know</p>
<p>when you give someone a chance and like they feel like they finally get you they</p>
<p>get comfortable and they kind of just like fall back and they relax and like</p>
<p>they stop pursuing you they stop acting excited by you they stop really like</p>
<p>showing their appreciation for you and it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s just kind</p>
<p>of how shit has gone but experiencing that I assigned the meaning to that of</p>
<p>me sharing how much I care for someone is what causes them to pull back from me</p>
<p>and laying that meaning over that situation is what has fucked me for so</p>
<p>long that is not the problem that is not what has happened and I want to give</p>
<p>that reassurance to everybody listening to this expressing how much you care</p>
<p>about someone does not make them like you less I promise and I&rsquo;m so sorry that</p>
<p>we all share that because I know if you listen to this podcast you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>fucked up in some of the ways that I have and I just want to give you that</p>
<p>reassurance because I have to give it to myself recently but this dynamic fully</p>
<p>fucking gets explained when you give an ugly motherfucker a chance like I swear</p>
<p>to God it&rsquo;s like as soon as you give someone like lower than your league a</p>
<p>chance like the ugly one like if you soon as you like step out of your</p>
<p>standards as soon as they get you they be acting like they are some fucking</p>
<p>body it&rsquo;s like bitch no that&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re not the cute one so don&rsquo;t act</p>
<p>like it I hate that like when you give a ugly motherfucker a chance and then they</p>
<p>act like they&rsquo;re the cute one like you want to leave me on red no bitch eat</p>
<p>shit kick rocks now cuz now I&rsquo;m done with you bozo like y&rsquo;all that actually</p>
<p>pisses me off like when you give a ugly motherfucker a chance and they want to</p>
<p>misbehave no you come correct and there&rsquo;s no room for error for you bitch</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already ugly but that&rsquo;s another thing in the past that like fucked my</p>
<p>sense of value was like lowering my standards and then not being appreciated</p>
<p>by the ugly motherfucker or like by the person I&rsquo;ve dropped my standards for</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t even appreciate me you worthless shit are you kidding me but</p>
<p>that will make you question your own value like if people not worth a fuck</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t value you it makes you question it and it&rsquo;ll make you not feel good about</p>
<p>yourself so that&rsquo;s where I got that whole mindset of like if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fully feel like they have me they&rsquo;ll never relax they&rsquo;ll always put in effort</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll always feel like they have to earn me and I&rsquo;ll always feel valued by</p>
<p>them because they&rsquo;re always chasing me but if you do this you&rsquo;re not ever</p>
<p>actually gonna have shit that lasts like in order for you to feel cared about you</p>
<p>have to keep people at a distance like that&rsquo;s not fair that&rsquo;s fucked up and I</p>
<p>did that for so long and I realized like what I want is like to truly feel</p>
<p>connected and cared about and doing that is the opposite of what you need to do</p>
<p>to get someone to care about you because that&rsquo;s just a false sense of security</p>
<p>like when you have someone at arm&rsquo;s length and you give them no security</p>
<p>like they have you you got him at arm&rsquo;s length and you have them just like</p>
<p>jumping at you like a fucking hungry dog and you have a bowl of food it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re only there and so you give them what they want and it sets up that</p>
<p>dynamic and it&rsquo;s not a good one like it&rsquo;s not a fun one it never works</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no real security they&rsquo;re never actually gonna like you for you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna feel connected you&rsquo;re never gonna feel close like just learn from my</p>
<p>mistake and don&rsquo;t fucking do that shit so like I said hiding how much you like</p>
<p>someone is the opposite of what you need to do to get them to like you and I</p>
<p>realized this because I&rsquo;m like what would it take for me to like someone for</p>
<p>me to drop my walls and to actually like pursue someone and care about someone</p>
<p>and fully let them know how much I care about them and then let myself care you</p>
<p>know what I mean like you try and hold yourself back from caring but I was</p>
<p>asking myself like what the fuck would it take for me to open up and someone</p>
<p>showing how much they care about me is what will make it feel safe for me to</p>
<p>care about them and this was like earth-shattering for me like I feel like</p>
<p>I discovered a new fucking thing make me feel special and I will open up to you I</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t play this fucking ego game like someone making me feel valued is what</p>
<p>will make me quit the game like I&rsquo;m not gonna play the fucking game if I feel</p>
<p>safe with you and in order to make me feel safe with you you have to let me</p>
<p>know how much you value me you have to let me know how much you truly care you</p>
<p>have to be honest about the way you feel towards me and I will literally commit</p>
<p>to you in two fucking seconds like my judgment is so good of people I know who</p>
<p>to let close to me and who not to but playing this game and pretending like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t fucking care is not the way to go so after realizing this I took a hard</p>
<p>look in the mirror and I mean a hard look bitch I had to look at all the</p>
<p>things that I was doing that made people feel unsafe to care about me like</p>
<p>I had to look at okay what would make me feel safe to care about someone and it</p>
<p>revealed all the shit that I was doing that was pushing people away so these</p>
<p>are a couple of things that I put would turn me the fuck off like this is what</p>
<p>would turn me off and this is what makes people not want you okay cuz this is all</p>
<p>shit that I was doing but this is all the things that made me undesirable and</p>
<p>made people not want me because they can feel when you&rsquo;re putting them at</p>
<p>arm&rsquo;s length and like I said the goal here is to go for safety and you need to</p>
<p>express how you feel about someone to them to make them feel safe to care</p>
<p>about you because that&rsquo;s all everybody&rsquo;s trying to do is prevent being hurt like</p>
<p>no one wants to care about someone they think is gonna hurt them so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>keeping them at arm&rsquo;s length and you&rsquo;re acting like they&rsquo;re not special they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna feel safe to care about you and one thing I&rsquo;m gonna point out is it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter how hot you are it doesn&rsquo;t matter how perfect you are it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money you have you can be the perfect person and if</p>
<p>someone does not feel safe to care about you they&rsquo;re not jumping on the sword for</p>
<p>you now some dumb motherfuckers will some simps will but that&rsquo;s not real love</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t actually care about you they just some people just weird in the head</p>
<p>okay but the people that are actually gonna care about you and actually want</p>
<p>to give you like a genuine chance they do not care what all you brings the</p>
<p>table how perfect you are if it&rsquo;s unsafe like it doesn&rsquo;t matter that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing to keep in mind because a lot of us are like why am I not good enough I</p>
<p>have this I have that I&rsquo;m hot I&rsquo;m pretty I&rsquo;m rich I&rsquo;m this I&rsquo;m successful like</p>
<p>they have all this shit and nobody wants them bitch you&rsquo;re unsafe it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter what you have and what you look like you can be the fucking most perfect</p>
<p>person in the world okay so let&rsquo;s move into a couple of things that I realized</p>
<p>are pushing people away and some things that you&rsquo;re doing that make you unsafe</p>
<p>and the first one pretending like you aren&rsquo;t excited to talk to them or see</p>
<p>them like bitch the way to get me is to like jump at the phone when I text you</p>
<p>cuz I&rsquo;m jumping at the phone too like I&rsquo;m so excited to talk to someone when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in them and if I feel like someone is not excited to talk to</p>
<p>me I immediately like put you at arm&rsquo;s length like I get scared like that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>thing is like I spot unsafety so fucking quick so if someone is not excited to</p>
<p>talk to me it makes me like push you away so if you do that knock it off let</p>
<p>people know you&rsquo;re excited to talk to them let people know they are excited to</p>
<p>see them and meet up with them and hang out with them like it&rsquo;s not cool to act</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not excited like that&rsquo;s one thing that will turn me the fuck off</p>
<p>quick and I&rsquo;m gonna talk about this as like my turn offs because I&rsquo;m someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very protective of myself and so good at spotting unsafety and spotting</p>
<p>what will hurt me so the next one is acting like you don&rsquo;t like them as much</p>
<p>as you do if you think they&rsquo;re fucking cute let them know hype them the fuck up</p>
<p>literally everybody&rsquo;s insecure I don&rsquo;t want to hear it so literally just let</p>
<p>them know how much you do like them how much you do like talking to them how</p>
<p>much you do like spending time with them don&rsquo;t act like you don&rsquo;t like them okay</p>
<p>if you like them say it if you like them express it like be fucking bold and be</p>
<p>ballsy like just say it so when I do let someone know that I like them they</p>
<p>better match the fucking energy back like if you match how much that I say I</p>
<p>like you if you say you like me the same amount and you be showing the same</p>
<p>level of interest I&rsquo;ll step it up and I&rsquo;ll show I like you a little bit more</p>
<p>and then you show me you like me a little bit more and it&rsquo;s back and forth</p>
<p>but if I start expressing that I like you and you hold back and pretend like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like me I&rsquo;m done there I&rsquo;m not letting you know I like you further than</p>
<p>that because bitch it&rsquo;s a back and forth it&rsquo;s a push and pull it&rsquo;s a give-and-take</p>
<p>we both have to let each other know that but that&rsquo;s another thing that will make</p>
<p>me pull back from someone is if I show that I like them because I always do I</p>
<p>have the balls to do that I&rsquo;ll always let you know that I like you I won&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>you know how much I like you out the gate but you get what I mean like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re gonna have to feed off of each other but if I show signs that I</p>
<p>like you and I make it clear and you don&rsquo;t really do that back I&rsquo;m gonna stop</p>
<p>okay my next one is making it seem like they&rsquo;re an option and this one oh my god</p>
<p>this one gets me bitch this one fucking gets me like if I feel like I&rsquo;m just on</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s roster I&rsquo;m cutting you off like if I just feel like I&rsquo;m another</p>
<p>like person to you and you have a lot of options and I&rsquo;m just one of them no</p>
<p>bitch I&rsquo;m done with you I&rsquo;m literally fucking running away I&rsquo;m scared I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>scared to get hurt okay I&rsquo;m fucking running if I feel like an option so if</p>
<p>you make people feel like they&rsquo;re just an option to you and like you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>picking them and that they&rsquo;re not special to you it&rsquo;s gonna turn them off</p>
<p>I mean if you&rsquo;re just fucking like whatever that&rsquo;s fine but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually wanting like a relationship from someone like you have to stop</p>
<p>making them feel like they&rsquo;re an option like you have to make it very clear that</p>
<p>you like them and you&rsquo;re choosing them and that you don&rsquo;t have other options</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re entertaining like that is my number one fucking turnoff like I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>competing with shit that is a huge huge turnoff is if you make it seem like</p>
<p>someone is not special to you like that&rsquo;s what will push me away</p>
<p>immediately so don&rsquo;t try to be cool and act like you have a bunch of hoes in</p>
<p>your phone and I think you&rsquo;re talking to all these people like I hate that shit I</p>
<p>literally hate that shit like if I think that you have a lot of people you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>entertaining I&rsquo;m no longer one of them goodbye I like to feel special I</p>
<p>literally like cut people off for that shit all the time like if I look at your</p>
<p>social media and you just look like you fuck with a lot of people I&rsquo;m done like</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m looking at a guy&rsquo;s Instagram and he looks thirsty for attention and he</p>
<p>looks like he&rsquo;s commenting back to all the guys on his post and doing all this</p>
<p>and doing all that and like following back all these faggots like I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>get pissed like bitch no I don&rsquo;t want no guy that&rsquo;s for everybody bitch you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>for me and that&rsquo;s it I want to feel like you having my attention is special</p>
<p>to you I don&rsquo;t want somebody who&rsquo;s impressed by everybody I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>somebody who wants attention from everybody I want someone who wants</p>
<p>attention from me but I swear like as soon as I see the first sign of like you</p>
<p>have a lot of people you&rsquo;re entertaining I&rsquo;m out so if you give that image to</p>
<p>other people you&rsquo;re putting them off okay so the next one is acting</p>
<p>unbothered like things don&rsquo;t phase you like you don&rsquo;t give a shit or them</p>
<p>saying someone else is cute just don&rsquo;t bother you no bitch that&rsquo;s one thing I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t hide okay like if you compliment somebody else in front of me or to me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking problem now now we&rsquo;re fighting okay now I&rsquo;m pissed off not my</p>
<p>feelings hurt don&rsquo;t fucking speak about anybody in a positive way that&rsquo;s not me</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m being dramatic but like compliments don&rsquo;t motherfucking</p>
<p>compliment nobody to me like if I like you shut your fucking mouth about</p>
<p>everybody else I want to feel special no but seriously I act bothered when</p>
<p>something botherss me like I&rsquo;ll let you know that&rsquo;s one thing that I do</p>
<p>absolutely always it&rsquo;s like I act bothered when someone doesn&rsquo;t text me</p>
<p>back like if they ignore me bitch oh if you ignore me if you wanted to see me</p>
<p>you just had to say that cuz now I&rsquo;m showing up where the fuck you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ignoring me uh-uh no but there&rsquo;s a way to go about this that&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>aggressive I&rsquo;m not saying let people know when shit bothers you like in a</p>
<p>negative way like yes do that but also let people know things bother you like</p>
<p>in a good way like I didn&rsquo;t hear from you and like I like to I prefer to like</p>
<p>if someone reschedules like let it be known that you were looking forward to</p>
<p>seeing them let them know you&rsquo;re excited to see them and let them know that not</p>
<p>seeing them you&rsquo;re a little upset by it like you&rsquo;re like damn okay like we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>reschedule and I&rsquo;m looking forward to it like that alone is great another</p>
<p>thing I always make an effort to do is text someone after I hang out with them</p>
<p>be like I&rsquo;m glad we hang out like I enjoyed spending time with you like just</p>
<p>something along the lines of that because whenever you leave somewhere</p>
<p>like leave hanging out with someone you&rsquo;re both sitting there like oh my</p>
<p>god are they gonna text me just fucking text them be the first one to do it be</p>
<p>vulnerable if you enjoyed hanging out fucking say it if you liked spending</p>
<p>time with them say it just let them know that their presence in your life has an</p>
<p>impact and if you don&rsquo;t want them seeing somebody else make that clear I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>clear about that shit I don&rsquo;t want you fucking nobody else I don&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>talking to nobody else that bothers me like I want you to myself let me know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re bothered when you&rsquo;re bothered like I want to know that you</p>
<p>care because showing that you&rsquo;re bothered shows that you care because if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unbothered you don&rsquo;t care so that&rsquo;s a big thing like let me know when</p>
<p>shit bothers you and I&rsquo;m gonna like you because I feel like you care all right</p>
<p>next time we&rsquo;re gonna talk about that you got to stop doing is hiding any</p>
<p>sense that you&rsquo;re attached to them like do not make it clear that you will be</p>
<p>just fine without them and that&rsquo;s the one that I struggle with the most</p>
<p>because I just have that attitude like I am fully okay without people like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>constructed myself to be that way and it&rsquo;s obvious just from the way that I</p>
<p>talk the way that I talk about things the way that I moved with it I make</p>
<p>decisions just that&rsquo;s just who I am and you can&rsquo;t deny it like it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>obvious and my friend Dita told me something the other day when I was</p>
<p>talking to her on the phone that really like hit me and she said Leo it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dangerous how much you don&rsquo;t need anyone and that shit like hit me hard and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>honestly what triggered this whole episode like this is what made me go</p>
<p>into everything and have all these realizations was her saying that to me</p>
<p>because for the first time I felt seen I know that I don&rsquo;t need anyone like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made it where I&rsquo;m okay without anybody like no one can leave my life and me</p>
<p>suffer like I might be upset emotionally but I&rsquo;m gonna be fine like I&rsquo;m able to</p>
<p>operate with a broken heart and that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve trained myself to be</p>
<p>able to do like I can still function I can be just fine I always have been and</p>
<p>always will be like I&rsquo;ve been through some really really rough shit like I</p>
<p>know how to function with a broken heart I know how to feel like I&rsquo;m dying inside</p>
<p>and still keep it together and keep on my fucking way like it&rsquo;s very clear when</p>
<p>people hurt me like I let people know when they hurt my feelings and when they</p>
<p>like upset me but people don&rsquo;t believe it because I don&rsquo;t let myself break down</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t let myself fall apart anymore like nothing can break me down</p>
<p>like that I&rsquo;ve been through the worst of the fucking worst you think you not</p>
<p>liking me is gonna hurt me bitch it is but you&rsquo;re never gonna see it like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna seem unfazed because like I&rsquo;ve been through so much worse you know what</p>
<p>I mean but if I&rsquo;m gonna care about someone I want to know that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happier with me in their life like I want to know that they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>lose me does that make sense if I feel like it&rsquo;s easy for you to walk away from</p>
<p>me I&rsquo;m not gonna get attached to you like I want security that it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>be easy for you to leave me but I give off the vibe of like I don&rsquo;t need you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not scared to lose you and that&rsquo;s one thing that I&rsquo;m working through so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hide that you&rsquo;re attached to people it&rsquo;s okay if you&rsquo;re gonna be okay</p>
<p>without them but make it clear that you&rsquo;d prefer not to be without them you</p>
<p>know because if I met someone like me who didn&rsquo;t need anyone and that was very</p>
<p>clear I would be scared to care about him because I feel like there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>security and this really opened my eyes why people have always been so hesitant</p>
<p>to care about me like I felt it I feel it all the time I feel that my whole</p>
<p>life from everyone like everyone&rsquo;s scared to care about me and now I fully</p>
<p>get it like I understand it on a deeper level people want to know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>attached to them people want to know that you care about them and you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>prefer to have them in your life people want to know that they&rsquo;re not disposable</p>
<p>people want to know that it&rsquo;s gonna affect you to lose them and that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ve been working on communicating with people and it&rsquo;s very very weird</p>
<p>like it feels so fucking weird I feel disgusting to let people know that they</p>
<p>would impact my life if they weren&rsquo;t in it like I know it would happen but I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t let other people know that would happen like literally let people know</p>
<p>how much you care it is so hot it is so attractive the main reason people love</p>
<p>other people so much is because of how much they love them like if someone is</p>
<p>obsessed with me I get obsessed with you right back like if you love me I love</p>
<p>you because you love me like it&rsquo;s the weirdest fucking thing all people are</p>
<p>like that all human beings got that weird little psychological fucking</p>
<p>screw loose where we all just love who loves us so that&rsquo;s the main thing I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been neglecting all these years is like to letting people know how much I care</p>
<p>about them and how much I do need them like I need people I don&rsquo;t want to say I</p>
<p>need people because I don&rsquo;t like I have I have resistance to even say I need</p>
<p>people because I know that I don&rsquo;t but I prefer you like I&rsquo;d prefer to have you</p>
<p>in my life I&rsquo;d rather have you than not have you is what I&rsquo;ve started</p>
<p>communicating and I&rsquo;ve stopped communicating and making it clear that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fucking need you like that&rsquo;s for me to know you know I guess just for me</p>
<p>to have like you don&rsquo;t need to know that I don&rsquo;t need you and that I&rsquo;ll be just</p>
<p>fine without you like I will never tell someone that and I need to stop giving</p>
<p>that image like I need to stop acting like I won&rsquo;t be affected because I am</p>
<p>affected by a lot a lot of things fuck with me and a lot of things hurt me but</p>
<p>I just know how to handle it so well like I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve built that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>that but when people don&rsquo;t see you have any like reaction to them leaving it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it makes them question their value it makes them question how much did you</p>
<p>actually care about them you know like it&rsquo;s the whole safety thing but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the other thing is if you make someone question if you value them or not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna want you they&rsquo;re not gonna pursue you at least I fucking won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like I won&rsquo;t pursue somebody like that like if I can&rsquo;t see how I contribute</p>
<p>value to you and I can&rsquo;t see how I like make you feel good there&rsquo;s no safety for</p>
<p>me to stay there like there&rsquo;s no what is the better word for it cuz safety is</p>
<p>like it but I need a better descriptive word I guess it&rsquo;s like seeing that you</p>
<p>meet needs for them like seeing that you bring them happiness and that you benefit</p>
<p>their life that&rsquo;s my reassurance that you&rsquo;re gonna keep me around when I can</p>
<p>see how you&rsquo;re attached to me when I can see how I&rsquo;m of use to you and you</p>
<p>like having me around it makes me feel secure it makes me feel like I&rsquo;m okay to</p>
<p>care about you because people hold on to things that are valuable to them like</p>
<p>think about it anything that you care about a lot or you value whether it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fucking physical thing or a person or whatever like you hold on to it like you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to lose it so by making someone feel valued it&rsquo;s sending them</p>
<p>the message that you&rsquo;re gonna hold on to them but one more thing I want to say</p>
<p>about all of this is if you want to give something a shot with someone you</p>
<p>have to fully be open and honest about the way that you feel if you play this</p>
<p>fucking ego game of pretending like you don&rsquo;t care when you do you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>gonna look back with regret like if there&rsquo;s any chance of a relationship</p>
<p>going somewhere with someone you have to give it a full shot and giving it a full</p>
<p>shot means making it very clear how much this person actually means to you and</p>
<p>how much you actually care about them it&rsquo;s not a real shot if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>honest like that if you don&rsquo;t give the full truth of how you feel you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>giving it a full chance to work and I&rsquo;m someone that never wants to look back</p>
<p>with regret like if I&rsquo;m gonna walk away from a situation it&rsquo;s because I know</p>
<p>there was no fucking chance at it and in order for me to have that security and</p>
<p>like reassurance in my choice to leave I have to give it a full fucking shot so</p>
<p>now I gotta be honest to how I feel and I&rsquo;m scared too and I&rsquo;m not saying out</p>
<p>the gate go sharing how much you feel and like saying I love you don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>say that like it do not say I love you to someone before three months like three</p>
<p>months is still too soon I&rsquo;d say six but nothing before three months and with</p>
<p>expressing how much that you feel do it like I said in increments like express</p>
<p>how much that you care and give them a chance to express it back you know and</p>
<p>then up it from there don&rsquo;t just full-fledged out the fucking gate be</p>
<p>pouring your heart out like cool it you ain&rsquo;t gonna do all that but this might</p>
<p>be different for everybody like everybody listening just look at what</p>
<p>makes you feel safe to care about someone and then do that for other</p>
<p>people allow them to feel safe to care about you and you will start to feel a</p>
<p>lot more cared about by people it can&rsquo;t not happen we are on this journey</p>
<p>together it is not a fun one it is not a fucking pleasant one all right this</p>
<p>sucks okay this is scary it feels like hell but we&rsquo;re all gonna be okay and</p>
<p>this is definitely like the number one thing I can give you to make people want</p>
<p>you and care about you more like this is what will increase your odds 100% and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not cute to not care that&rsquo;s one more thing I just want to say it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fucking cute to not care about things like it&rsquo;s very attractive to care it is</p>
<p>very hot to care like it&rsquo;s so hot for someone to let their guard down like for</p>
<p>someone to be brave as fuck like it&rsquo;s not tough to keep everyone in the</p>
<p>distance so you don&rsquo;t get hurt like it&rsquo;s so much more tough to take the chance of</p>
<p>being hurt and knowing you&rsquo;re gonna be okay and dealing with it and facing it</p>
<p>and like moving on from that that&rsquo;s hot that&rsquo;s tough that&rsquo;s real tough stuff</p>
<p>bitch we&rsquo;re not doing no more pussy shit of hiding how we feel and not making</p>
<p>people feel cared about okay like if you want to feel cared about you got to</p>
<p>take that fucking step and do it too but honestly that&rsquo;s one thing that is so</p>
<p>funny is everybody operates like that everybody acts like it&rsquo;s cool to not</p>
<p>care but that&rsquo;s actually being such a fucking pussy like that is so chicken</p>
<p>shit to do like everybody running around actually they don&rsquo;t care about you they</p>
<p>act like they have hoes it&rsquo;s like y&rsquo;all are the most unfulfilled unsatisfied</p>
<p>scared to be hurt ass can&rsquo;t handle heartbreak ass bitches and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>hookup culture is so prevalent now because that&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s sense of</p>
<p>connection you get to feel connected to somebody while you&rsquo;re having sex or</p>
<p>hooking up and then you get to detach like there&rsquo;s nothing there there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>fear of being hurt but hookup culture that&rsquo;s a whole other fucking podcast</p>
<p>that was so babe there&rsquo;s a lot to break down with that like it&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>funny but it is sad how our society is like built on it like that&rsquo;s the norm</p>
<p>for my generation is to act like you don&rsquo;t go fuck everyone thinks that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s keeping them safe but it&rsquo;s actually preventing you from ever</p>
<p>actually feeling loved which is painful as fuck I&rsquo;m living it but really after I</p>
<p>started looking at this like I&rsquo;m looking around that everybody and I&rsquo;d be judging</p>
<p>them but you can actually see how hurt everybody is and how scared everybody is</p>
<p>to be hurt once you can see and like break down this behavior like everybody</p>
<p>is just running around so scared of pain I&rsquo;m telling you this realization has</p>
<p>changed the way I look at everyone and everything like it&rsquo;s so sad honestly</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the word like I want to say it&rsquo;s funny but it&rsquo;s actually so sad</p>
<p>because everybody is so much more see-through than you realize like I see</p>
<p>through a lot of things but this is just one of them where you can read through</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s behavior and the way that they&rsquo;re actually acting is out of fear</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not acting cuz they&rsquo;re tough and they&rsquo;re cool like they&rsquo;re fucking scared</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna leave you off there I hope you enjoyed this episode I hope you take</p>
<p>something away from it if you have experienced the same thing that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>experienced of always feeling like you&rsquo;re the one that cares more I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry babe but I wanted to make sure I revealed this in this episode so that</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel alone because people don&rsquo;t fucking say that like I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard anyone else say that so I know that there&rsquo;s other people out there that</p>
<p>feel like that so I just wanted to share it so that you feel connected to babe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not alone I&rsquo;ve got you I&rsquo;m right here with you and in the future like</p>
<p>throughout my episodes I will teach you how to be okay alone like I will teach</p>
<p>you how to deal with heartbreak I will teach you how to deal with continuing to</p>
<p>function like I&rsquo;ve got you don&rsquo;t fucking worry anything I know is fair</p>
<p>game for you to know and that&rsquo;s what this podcast is for is to share</p>
<p>everything that I&rsquo;ve learned about this fucking shit show we call life okay</p>
<p>cuz they know textbook preparing you for this bitch like the Bible girl please</p>
