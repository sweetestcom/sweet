    <p>This series is something that&rsquo;s been a long time coming,</p>
<p>an idea I&rsquo;ve had for years, and over the last year at AudioChuck,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been putting together the right team of people</p>
<p>to make this show a reality.</p>
<p>Those of you who are deep in the true crime community</p>
<p>might know about cold case playing card decks.</p>
<p>Some law enforcement agencies have replaced</p>
<p>the faces of traditional playing cards</p>
<p>with images of missing and murdered people.</p>
<p>Each card represents a victim who&rsquo;s gone without justice.</p>
<p>The goal was to get these out to the public and into jails and prisons,</p>
<p>hoping that they might find their way into the hands of someone with answers.</p>
<p>And now, it&rsquo;s time to bring these cases to a bigger audience,</p>
<p>hoping each of these stories will finally hit the right ears.</p>
<p>Our card this week is Raquel Ramirez, the Seven of Diamonds from Connecticut.</p>
<p>In 1985, Raquel disappeared in the middle of the night from her family&rsquo;s home,</p>
<p>only to be found the next day in a bizarre area not easily accessible to anyone.</p>
<p>In the many years since her death, her family has never stopped seeking justice,</p>
<p>and one detective has vowed to keep investigating her case</p>
<p>until he can prove who killed her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>June 29th, 1985 was your usual summer evening at Juana Almena&rsquo;s house in Hartford, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Her 29-year-old daughter Raquel Ramirez and Raquel&rsquo;s three children were living with her,</p>
<p>so the house was lively, especially because it was a Saturday night.</p>
<p>After dinner, the kids got ready for bed and settled in the living room,</p>
<p>while Raquel went out for drinks with some of her friends.</p>
<p>Juana didn&rsquo;t judge her daughter for wanting to have a social life</p>
<p>on top of her full-time mom duties.</p>
<p>Raquel was always responsible and always put her kids before her social calendar.</p>
<p>Raquel&rsquo;s daughter Brenda Perez, who was 10 years old at the time,</p>
<p>said even if money was tight,</p>
<p>her mom had a natural ability to make each one of them feel special.</p>
<p>She was upbeat, outgoing. She loved to dance.</p>
<p>She, most of all, just loved to be around us.</p>
<p>Shortly after Raquel headed out on that Saturday,</p>
<p>Brenda and her siblings went to bed.</p>
<p>And as expected, Raquel got home a few hours later, right after midnight.</p>
<p>But none of the kids were awake and actually saw their mom.</p>
<p>Juana was the only one up who noticed Raquel arrive.</p>
<p>When Juana eventually went upstairs to go to bed,</p>
<p>she saw Raquel had fallen asleep on the couch, still in her going-out clothes.</p>
<p>About an hour later, though, around 1.30 in the morning,</p>
<p>Juana heard the sound of the front door opening and closing.</p>
<p>That was kind of unusual,</p>
<p>but she figured Raquel must have just gone back out to the bars.</p>
<p>Maybe one of her friends had stopped by.</p>
<p>Juana didn&rsquo;t think much more about it and drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>When everyone woke up Sunday morning,</p>
<p>they were surprised when they didn&rsquo;t see Raquel on the couch.</p>
<p>And she wasn&rsquo;t in her bedroom either.</p>
<p>They thought maybe she stayed overnight at another relative&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t like her to not let the family know if that was her plan.</p>
<p>Juana started calling family members to see if anyone had seen Raquel,</p>
<p>or if she was with them.</p>
<p>But none of them knew where she was.</p>
<p>By midday on Sunday, a few hours after they realized Raquel was missing,</p>
<p>Juana finally decided to call the Hartford Police Department.</p>
<p>The dispatcher who answered took down Raquel&rsquo;s physical description.</p>
<p>Five feet tall, short dark hair, late 20s, missing since 1.30 that morning.</p>
<p>The information was filed away as something officers could follow up on later,</p>
<p>since Raquel hadn&rsquo;t even been missing a full day yet.</p>
<p>But not long after they took this report,</p>
<p>a teenager showed up at the Hartford Police Department to report a strange discovery.</p>
<p>The kid told authorities that he and his friends had found a body</p>
<p>under the I-91 overpass.</p>
<p>The teenager said he wasn&rsquo;t sure how old the person was, or even what gender.</p>
<p>But based on the size of the corpse, he and his friends all thought that it could be a child.</p>
<p>Hartford detective Drew Jacobson said when emergency responders first got to the scene,</p>
<p>they too, at first glance, thought the body was that of a little girl.</p>
<p>So they found her on June 30, 1985, under a bridge.</p>
<p>I-91 is a highway that runs centrally through Connecticut, north to south.</p>
<p>And in Hartford, there&rsquo;s a section of the Connecticut River, and I-91 is really close to it.</p>
<p>She was itty-bitty, just barely five feet tall.</p>
<p>I want to say she weighed 85 or 90 pounds at the time of her death.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take police long to realize the body was actually that of a young woman.</p>
<p>The teenagers who&rsquo;d reported finding the body said that they had been fishing on the bank of</p>
<p>the river when they went up an embankment to the overpass to look for worms to use as bait.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they found her lying in some brush.</p>
<p>She was covered in dirt and had some scrapes on her, so they were pretty sure she was dead.</p>
<p>One of the teens said he trekked back to his car and drove two miles to the Hartford police</p>
<p>department, while his other two friends went out to the road to see if they could flag down</p>
<p>a patrol officer if one happened to pass by.</p>
<p>Police responded to the scene right away,</p>
<p>taped off the area, and started to process the crime scene.</p>
<p>It was obvious to investigators that all signs pointed to a scenario</p>
<p>that the woman had been murdered, but it wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious how she died.</p>
<p>Her shirt was kind of moved over, her bra was exposed, part of it was torn,</p>
<p>her pants, the top of her pants were unbuttoned, and she had drag marks on her rear end.</p>
<p>Police decided, just based on her positioning,</p>
<p>that where the victim&rsquo;s body had been found was likely also where she was killed.</p>
<p>It would be very, very difficult to carry a body into that area.</p>
<p>It would be tough.</p>
<p>You would have to kind of convince a person to climb in there with you.</p>
<p>Just kind of looking at the pictures in the dirt, it kind of looks like there was a struggle there.</p>
<p>Her shoes are kind of like in a couple different areas.</p>
<p>It probably happened on the dirt and then they dragged her into the vegetation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably the scuff marks on her backside.</p>
<p>In her back right pocket, investigators found a lottery ticket, dated for Friday, June 28, 1985.</p>
<p>The ticket had been purchased from the Spanish-American package store in town.</p>
<p>So officers took a photo of the victim and then went to the store,</p>
<p>where a clerk on duty confirmed the woman in the picture was Raquel Ramirez, a regular customer.</p>
<p>So police&rsquo;s next stop was to go to Juana&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>where Raquel&rsquo;s 12-year-old son, Benjamin, answered the door.</p>
<p>They told Juana that in order to be sure they had their official ID correct,</p>
<p>they needed her to go to the medical examiner&rsquo;s office to confirm her daughter&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>But Juana was too upset to do that.</p>
<p>So Raquel&rsquo;s sister Ada ended up driving two and a half hours to Hartford from</p>
<p>Patterson, New Jersey to make the identification.</p>
<p>And Ada recognized her sister right away.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson wasn&rsquo;t a responding officer back then</p>
<p>and wasn&rsquo;t in the room when Ada ID&rsquo;d her sister&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>But for the past 17 years, he&rsquo;s worked the case.</p>
<p>And after reading through all of the material his agency has collected,</p>
<p>he has a really good handle on what those first few hours of the investigation look like.</p>
<p>He said back then, some of the first people detectives were suspicious of</p>
<p>were the teenage fishermen who&rsquo;d reported finding Raquel.</p>
<p>Even today, Jacobson struggles with understanding</p>
<p>why those teens were in such a secluded, obscure area.</p>
<p>To gain access to it, you had to walk across a section of a highway to get kind of underneath.</p>
<p>When I went in and climbed in there a few years ago to kind of take a look around,</p>
<p>I had to go to an access road and climb over like a half of a cement wall</p>
<p>and kind of duck underneath.</p>
<p>It was a little strange to get into.</p>
<p>So getting worms to me doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to sort it out to this date,</p>
<p>why those three men were underneath there.</p>
<p>Could you be looking for worms?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But maybe they were overnight drinking beer or maybe they had some information about it.</p>
<p>Detectives kept the fishermen for questioning,</p>
<p>but the teens didn&rsquo;t have much else to provide police.</p>
<p>They stuck to their story about only happening upon the body</p>
<p>because they were looking for bait.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t even from the area.</p>
<p>An autopsy showed Raquel had been strangled</p>
<p>and her killer likely used their bare hands to choke her.</p>
<p>The medical examiner did find sperm when he examined Raquel,</p>
<p>but it was undetermined who it belonged to</p>
<p>and if it had been from a previous consensual encounter</p>
<p>or from a sexual assault before her death.</p>
<p>The only two things found in her pockets were that lottery ticket</p>
<p>and someone else&rsquo;s social security card,</p>
<p>which detectives found highly suspicious.</p>
<p>But at the time,</p>
<p>police efforts to locate the correct owner of the card were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>After learning everything they could from her autopsy,</p>
<p>detectives interviewed as many of Raquel&rsquo;s friends and family as they could.</p>
<p>Juana told them about how Raquel had gone out that Saturday,</p>
<p>only to return around midnight and then leave again around 1.30.</p>
<p>To police, Raquel&rsquo;s movements were hard to piece together.</p>
<p>They needed to figure out how she&rsquo;d gone</p>
<p>from being fast asleep on her mom&rsquo;s couch</p>
<p>to hours later being murdered and left under an interstate overpass.</p>
<p>After speaking with family members,</p>
<p>police wanted to talk to Raquel&rsquo;s exes and her current boyfriend.</p>
<p>Raquel had two exes who were the fathers of her three children,</p>
<p>but those relationships were from when she lived in New Jersey,</p>
<p>so the men had no ties to Connecticut.</p>
<p>Each of those guys provided solid alibis right away</p>
<p>and were determined to have been miles away in New Jersey</p>
<p>during Raquel&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So, detectives zeroed in on Raquel&rsquo;s current boyfriend,</p>
<p>and they found out right away that Raquel&rsquo;s relationship with him was far from perfect.</p>
<p>It was no secret among Raquel&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>that her boyfriend had physically assaulted her in the past,</p>
<p>and there was an incident that happened earlier on Saturday,</p>
<p>right before Raquel was murdered.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Raquel&rsquo;s daughter Brenda again.</p>
<p>I recall telling the detectives when they questioned me</p>
<p>that they got into an altercation.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t remember exactly now what I had said then,</p>
<p>but I had told my grandmother that moms and her boyfriend got into a fight that day.</p>
<p>Police investigators at the time knew that similar incidents had happened in the past.</p>
<p>According to Detective Jacobson,</p>
<p>interviewed transcripts with Brenda from 1985</p>
<p>indicate that she remembered one disturbing altercation</p>
<p>between Raquel and her boyfriend that involved a pretty serious weapon.</p>
<p>They said it was abusive.</p>
<p>They were on and off.</p>
<p>She would break up with him.</p>
<p>He would get really upset and would slap her around a little bit.</p>
<p>Brenda had even heard that within a month or two of her mom&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>that he might have hit her in the head with a hammer.</p>
<p>Detectives couldn&rsquo;t find a police report or hospital visit</p>
<p>to corroborate the alleged hammer assault,</p>
<p>and Raquel&rsquo;s autopsy did not show injuries</p>
<p>consistent with having been hit in the head recently.</p>
<p>But police did confirm through multiple sources</p>
<p>that Raquel had tried to break up with her boyfriend right before she was killed,</p>
<p>but the breakup wasn&rsquo;t clean.</p>
<p>For abused women, the national statistic is that</p>
<p>it can take up to seven times to actually leave for good.</p>
<p>And so if the allegations of abuse are true,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not surprising to learn that the couple got caught up in a cycle</p>
<p>of breaking up, reconnecting, breaking up, reconnecting over and over again.</p>
<p>Police became aware of this when they actually spoke with the boyfriend.</p>
<p>He confirmed in his interview with police</p>
<p>that Raquel had actually been by his apartment on that very Saturday night.</p>
<p>He said that the two of them had sex, but he swore he didn&rsquo;t kill her.</p>
<p>So while this is one possible explanation of the sperm found during Raquel&rsquo;s autopsy,</p>
<p>at the time investigators had no way of knowing if that sperm was his.</p>
<p>Aside from the allegations that he was a violent partner,</p>
<p>police lacked evidence linking him to any assaults or Raquel&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t pursue him any further as a suspect.</p>
<p>Detectives tried to get more information from anyone</p>
<p>who might have been with Raquel out drinking that Saturday night,</p>
<p>but witnesses weren&rsquo;t exactly lining up to be interviewed.</p>
<p>At the time, a lot of people in Raquel&rsquo;s community</p>
<p>were actually fearful of talking to the police.</p>
<p>In the early 80s through like the mid 90s,</p>
<p>the city of Hartford had a real problem with street gangs,</p>
<p>specifically some Latin street gangs like the Los Salidos and the Latin Kings.</p>
<p>There seems to be a resurgence of them now,</p>
<p>but it seems like a lot of people were scared to talk to police back then</p>
<p>and would really provide very, very little information.</p>
<p>Weeks went by with very few clues as to what happened to Raquel.</p>
<p>There were some unverified sightings of her at a bar called Amigo Cafe</p>
<p>just hours before she was killed,</p>
<p>but again, police were having a hard time finding willing witnesses</p>
<p>who would swear to that.</p>
<p>But then, on July 23rd, a month after the murder,</p>
<p>someone called in a tip, asking authorities an alarming question.</p>
<p>Do you want to know who killed that woman in Connecticut River?</p>
<p>The audio clip from that actual call is from 1985,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to understand,</p>
<p>but Detective Jacobson gave us the transcript.</p>
<p>It was a woman talking to an officer at the Hartford Police Department.</p>
<p>To sum it up, the caller said she not only knew the man who killed Raquel,</p>
<p>but she provided his name and his address,</p>
<p>and she confirmed how she knew he was the killer.</p>
<p>The tip says, yep, and his wife fled shortly after.</p>
<p>They went to Newark, they got out of town,</p>
<p>that he was involved in it.</p>
<p>And this is, like, right after it happened.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re censoring his name because it&rsquo;s off the record,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll call him Jay.</p>
<p>Detective tried to corroborate the tip and track down Jay,</p>
<p>but most people in town were not willing to talk about him,</p>
<p>and there was no sign of him or his wife in Hartford.</p>
<p>Eventually, after weeks of persistence,</p>
<p>detectives found a potential witness</p>
<p>who reluctantly agreed to be interviewed about Jay.</p>
<p>According to the witness, he&rsquo;d seen Raquel get into Jay&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>during the early morning hours of Sunday,</p>
<p>shortly after Raquel left her home.</p>
<p>The witness said he saw Jay again a few hours later,</p>
<p>and by that point, Jay had changed his clothes and appeared to be upset.</p>
<p>The witness said he&rsquo;d heard that Jay</p>
<p>and two of his drug trade associates killed Raquel</p>
<p>over an outstanding drug debt</p>
<p>that one of her family members had racked up.</p>
<p>The story was that Raquel&rsquo;s relative had lost some cocaine</p>
<p>that was worth a lot of money,</p>
<p>and because of that, the dealer didn&rsquo;t get paid</p>
<p>and was furious over it.</p>
<p>The men were overheard discussing the drug debt,</p>
<p>that they were really upset,</p>
<p>and that they were going to go get her</p>
<p>because they thought that maybe she had taken it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>but they think that she had taken it</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re going to go take care of the problem,</p>
<p>the problem being Raquel.</p>
<p>You can imagine how detectives felt</p>
<p>while listening to this witness&rsquo;s story,</p>
<p>like they were well on their way to solving Raquel&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>But almost as quickly as the guy who was saying all of this</p>
<p>came forward and agreed to talk,</p>
<p>he got spooked and put down his pencil during the interview</p>
<p>and was like, you know what, never mind, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>Without a signature from the witness on an official statement,</p>
<p>the detectives were left with nothing.</p>
<p>Not a single word of what the man had said in the interview room</p>
<p>could be used in court,</p>
<p>and no matter how much the authorities pleaded with him,</p>
<p>the witness was not changing his mind about backing out.</p>
<p>So with no other cooperating witnesses,</p>
<p>the investigation stalled.</p>
<p>A year went by with no answers,</p>
<p>and Raquel&rsquo;s family was devastated.</p>
<p>Juana had continued raising her grandchildren,</p>
<p>even though her heart was aching over the loss of her own daughter.</p>
<p>There was a missing piece in their family,</p>
<p>and they felt it whenever they were at home.</p>
<p>Raquel used to teach her kids how to salsa dance,</p>
<p>and they tried to hang on to those happy memories.</p>
<p>Our birthdays were special to her to have.</p>
<p>She made them special for us, and it was a big deal to her.</p>
<p>Whether it was hard times or not, she made it happen.</p>
<p>Those little umbrellas, you know,</p>
<p>she, even though those were for little cocktails or whatever,</p>
<p>she used them for parties.</p>
<p>She did her own little things.</p>
<p>So certain things that she did back in the years</p>
<p>still remind me of things that I see now in stores,</p>
<p>and remind me of her and things that she did.</p>
<p>In 1986, Raquel&rsquo;s family convinced the governor of Connecticut</p>
<p>to approve a $20,000 reward for information</p>
<p>leading to the killer&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p>They figured a little public pressure and financial incentive</p>
<p>might make witnesses re-evaluate cooperating with the investigation.</p>
<p>But ultimately, people still wouldn&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>To avoid getting tunnel vision,</p>
<p>detectives started looking into other possible motives</p>
<p>for why someone would want to kill Raquel.</p>
<p>And when they did, they noticed a trend.</p>
<p>Women all over Connecticut were being strangled and left for dead.</p>
<p>At least 18 women were murdered in the state between 1985 and 1991.</p>
<p>The slayings were so noteworthy</p>
<p>that the state actually formed a task force</p>
<p>to look into possible connections between the victims,</p>
<p>even though bodies were being found in different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>By the end of 1986,</p>
<p>Hartford police detectives began to suspect that</p>
<p>maybe, just maybe,</p>
<p>Raquel had been the victim of a serial killer</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been operating in Connecticut.</p>
<p>And those suspicions weren&rsquo;t completely unfounded.</p>
<p>The other cases did have some similarities to Raquel.</p>
<p>They were all female victims,</p>
<p>and most were killed in the same way.</p>
<p>Strangled and left in secluded areas near highways and interstates.</p>
<p>Five of the victims were all killed in Hartford.</p>
<p>Others were found in different locations around the state,</p>
<p>but the state of Connecticut isn&rsquo;t that big.</p>
<p>You can drive across it in less than two hours.</p>
<p>At least one of the other victims was strangled</p>
<p>and found along an interstate just a month after Raquel.</p>
<p>She was also a petite woman in her 20s.</p>
<p>And weirdly, her body was also discovered by fishermen,</p>
<p>but not the same fishermen who found Raquel&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>A lot of the women that were being found had a history of sex work.</p>
<p>And even though police did not think Raquel had been a sex worker,</p>
<p>her case was investigated as possibly being linked to the others.</p>
<p>Mainly because all the victims were part of marginalized groups</p>
<p>and or women of color.</p>
<p>The task force did have some success.</p>
<p>They solved a few of the murders,</p>
<p>but nothing in their investigation linked Raquel&rsquo;s killing</p>
<p>to a serial murderer.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson wasn&rsquo;t surprised by this</p>
<p>because he thinks it&rsquo;s more likely that Raquel</p>
<p>was targeted by someone she knew.</p>
<p>The random killing of people,</p>
<p>although it does happen,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such a small percentage of actual homicides</p>
<p>that I really don&rsquo;t believe that that occurred.</p>
<p>The case went cold in the 90s,</p>
<p>but Raquel&rsquo;s family never stopped looking for answers.</p>
<p>As her kids got older,</p>
<p>they kept doing anything they could to fight for justice,</p>
<p>especially Brenda.</p>
<p>The loss of a mother at the age of 10 in a rock, you know.</p>
<p>At one point, I remember she made a stack of flyers</p>
<p>and walked up and down Park Street with her family,</p>
<p>tacking them up on telephone poles and stuff,</p>
<p>putting them in different bodegas</p>
<p>and different stores in the windows,</p>
<p>trying to seek information for her mom.</p>
<p>The ripple effect that something like this,</p>
<p>an unnatural death like this,</p>
<p>that has on generations and generations of family</p>
<p>are incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s now a grandmother,</p>
<p>so Raquel would have been the great grandmother.</p>
<p>Even those kids aren&rsquo;t caring about Raquel being killed</p>
<p>and what had happened and why.</p>
<p>By the time Detective Jacobson took over the case in 2005,</p>
<p>he discovered that some major missteps happened</p>
<p>in his department after the case went cold.</p>
<p>Evidence had not properly been stored</p>
<p>by the Hartford Police Department.</p>
<p>And to make matters worse,</p>
<p>the agency flat out lost pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Their evidence room had moved three times since the 80s,</p>
<p>and items weren&rsquo;t organized and digitally marked</p>
<p>with barcodes the way they are today.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson said key pieces of evidence</p>
<p>that he knows existed at one point</p>
<p>were now nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some things missing,</p>
<p>like there were some beer cans</p>
<p>that were collected at the scene.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the exact number,</p>
<p>but say there&rsquo;s 10 beer cans</p>
<p>and they must have dusted them for fingerprints at the time.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m only left with three or four.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no notation what happened to the other ones.</p>
<p>Maybe the lab just said</p>
<p>there was nothing identifiable on it</p>
<p>and for whatever reason, they got rid of them.</p>
<p>The standards that even by the court&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>are much different in 2021 than they were in 1985.</p>
<p>I actually went through</p>
<p>and ripped through all sorts of boxes</p>
<p>and tried to account for everything we had,</p>
<p>where things have gone,</p>
<p>to different labs and everything else.</p>
<p>So what we have is not going to go anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very, very tight,</p>
<p>but there are things that are missing that I wish I had.</p>
<p>The police department had even lost</p>
<p>Raquel&rsquo;s fingernail clippings,</p>
<p>which might&rsquo;ve had DNA under them.</p>
<p>It angered me.</p>
<p>It angered me to the point</p>
<p>that I really thought mom&rsquo;s case fell through the cracks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really frustrating.</p>
<p>And the worst part is trying to explain</p>
<p>to the daughter of a homicide victim</p>
<p>why I don&rsquo;t have something.</p>
<p>Jacobson also noticed that as detectives retired</p>
<p>in the late 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>his department never assigned a new detective</p>
<p>to investigate Raquel&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Then in 1997,</p>
<p>major news broke about police corruption in Hartford</p>
<p>that majorly derailed everyone&rsquo;s trust in the police,</p>
<p>especially Raquel&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>One of the detectives</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been the original lead investigator on Raquel&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>was arrested and charged with 10 counts of sexual assault.</p>
<p>According to an article</p>
<p>that ran in the Hartford Courant in 1997,</p>
<p>a criminal inspector with the state of Connecticut</p>
<p>charged former Hartford police detective Joseph Marrero</p>
<p>with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The article referenced unsealed court documents</p>
<p>that said the girl first told her mom</p>
<p>about the allegations against Marrero in 1995.</p>
<p>And when that girl&rsquo;s mother confronted Marrero,</p>
<p>he admitted to inappropriately kissing and touching the girl.</p>
<p>Marrero was with the Hartford police department for 20 years</p>
<p>and worked Raquel&rsquo;s case from 1985</p>
<p>until his retirement from the police department in 1989.</p>
<p>Then he went to work</p>
<p>for the chief state&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office as an inspector.</p>
<p>He also worked on the state&rsquo;s fugitive squad,</p>
<p>which helped track down felons</p>
<p>who skipped out on court and jail sentences.</p>
<p>When the news about Marrero&rsquo;s arrest broke in 1997,</p>
<p>Raquel&rsquo;s family was like,</p>
<p>well, no wonder police never solved her case.</p>
<p>The lead detective was a criminal himself.</p>
<p>Theories and rumors about corruption</p>
<p>within the police department ran wild.</p>
<p>The Marrero scandal really steered a lot of attention</p>
<p>away from cold cases like Raquel&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And people, including Raquel&rsquo;s family,</p>
<p>began to deeply mistrust Hartford law enforcement.</p>
<p>Mom&rsquo;s case had no chance in hell.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson says that time was extremely troublesome.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whatever was going on back in the time,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have control over.</p>
<p>And anything&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t rule anything out,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like what those cops were doing</p>
<p>at the time influenced this case file.</p>
<p>Years went by with no new developments,</p>
<p>and Raquel&rsquo;s case never got any press coverage</p>
<p>outside of Hartford.</p>
<p>For almost a decade,</p>
<p>the local publications just did a few anniversary stories</p>
<p>here and there, but that was about it.</p>
<p>In 2006, in hopes of getting new leads</p>
<p>or revisiting old ones,</p>
<p>the Hartford police department announced</p>
<p>that they would re-up the $20,000 reward</p>
<p>that was previously promised by the governor</p>
<p>for any information that led them to Raquel&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>And some of the local media coverage</p>
<p>jogged people&rsquo;s memories and got them talking.</p>
<p>It led Detective Jacobson to a brand new witness,</p>
<p>a woman who had been dating a prior person of interest</p>
<p>back in the 80s, one of Jay&rsquo;s drug trade associates.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to censor his name too,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll call him Paul.</p>
<p>I was able to run into a girlfriend</p>
<p>from back in the time,</p>
<p>and I interviewed her in a city nearby.</p>
<p>And she had actually said to me,</p>
<p>she said, well, I dated when I knew he was a player.</p>
<p>He would go out and mess around with all the girls</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d get all dressed up,</p>
<p>but he would always come back to me</p>
<p>and I loved him at the time.</p>
<p>And she knew who Raquel was.</p>
<p>The woman told Detective Jacobson</p>
<p>about something that happened the night Raquel was killed</p>
<p>that always left her suspicious of Paul.</p>
<p>That same night, he had also gone out,</p>
<p>all dressed up in a suit,</p>
<p>had gone out to a bar or whatever.</p>
<p>And he came home with mud on his suit,</p>
<p>scratches on his neck and on his wrists.</p>
<p>And his shirt was kind of like partially torn.</p>
<p>And she was mad figuring that he went out</p>
<p>and had sex with a girl</p>
<p>or who knows what he was involved in.</p>
<p>And his explanation was that</p>
<p>he had to help somebody fix a muffler.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s craziness.</p>
<p>The woman didn&rsquo;t buy the muffler story at the time,</p>
<p>but she was so scared of Paul</p>
<p>that she didn&rsquo;t cooperate with police.</p>
<p>But she still put two and two together in her head.</p>
<p>Well, Raquel&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>They find her down by the river.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got scratches on him</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t been able to interview him</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know where he is.</p>
<p>The woman told Detective Jacobson</p>
<p>that the information she&rsquo;d been keeping inside</p>
<p>all these years always bothered her.</p>
<p>But by the time she was ready to talk,</p>
<p>Paul had been out of her life for years</p>
<p>and she knew it was time to share</p>
<p>what she knew with police.</p>
<p>That new information helped Detective Jacobson</p>
<p>go back through all of the old information</p>
<p>with fresh perspective.</p>
<p>And he theorized about</p>
<p>how it could have all tied together.</p>
<p>And he strongly suspected that it was possible</p>
<p>Paul and Jay worked together.</p>
<p>My gut instinct with everything that I&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>since 2005,</p>
<p>I really feel like it was probably the person</p>
<p>who was directly involved in her death.</p>
<p>There was definitely other men that were involved</p>
<p>in getting Raquel to that area.</p>
<p>But I really feel like it was the person</p>
<p>that most likely did it.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re not saying the men&rsquo;s real names</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve never been charged</p>
<p>with Raquel&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>But Detective Jacobson said</p>
<p>charges down the road aren&rsquo;t out of the question.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t say for sure that Jay and Paul</p>
<p>were tied to any gangs,</p>
<p>but he does think they were involved</p>
<p>in the drug trade in Connecticut in the mid 80s.</p>
<p>The issue is trying to find them today.</p>
<p>Some of the people are dead</p>
<p>that might&rsquo;ve had information.</p>
<p>Some of the people are moved out of the state,</p>
<p>out of the country.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit of work</p>
<p>trying to track people down.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re like me,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably wondering,</p>
<p>surely Jay and Paul&rsquo;s DNA is in the system</p>
<p>since they have criminal records.</p>
<p>Can we just compare it to DNA found from Raquel?</p>
<p>Well, the problem is their DNA isn&rsquo;t in CODIS</p>
<p>because the other felonies they committed</p>
<p>were prior to the national database being established.</p>
<p>As he continued looking for Jay and Paul,</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson wanted to tie up</p>
<p>a few other loose ends.</p>
<p>In 2015, he found the mysterious woman</p>
<p>whose social security card</p>
<p>was in Raquel&rsquo;s pocket at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Police in the 80s didn&rsquo;t give much attention to that clue,</p>
<p>but Jacobson just wanted to mark it off his list</p>
<p>as a possible connection.</p>
<p>I talked to her over the phone</p>
<p>and the woman was baffled.</p>
<p>She said, you know, I was two years old in 1985</p>
<p>or whatever it was.</p>
<p>The woman lived in Chicago</p>
<p>and had no ties to Raquel.</p>
<p>When I spoke to this woman,</p>
<p>she said, I don&rsquo;t know how this woman</p>
<p>who died in Hartford, Connecticut</p>
<p>has my social security card.</p>
<p>So that left Jacobson unable to explain</p>
<p>why Raquel had the card.</p>
<p>It was a dead end.</p>
<p>Another avenue he tried to pursue</p>
<p>was having new DNA testing done</p>
<p>on the little bit of evidence</p>
<p>that was preserved in Raquel&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>evidence he thinks could point him</p>
<p>directly to Raquel&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>There was a sperm cell,</p>
<p>which was huge to me.</p>
<p>Really, really, I mean, that&rsquo;s massive.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s tons of DNA in that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you know, when they examined it</p>
<p>and they submitted it in for comparison to CODIS</p>
<p>to look for other offenders</p>
<p>throughout the United States,</p>
<p>there was no match.</p>
<p>Just because there wasn&rsquo;t a match to the sperm</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean there won&rsquo;t ever be one.</p>
<p>But if the motive was a drug debt</p>
<p>and the sperm was from consensual sex</p>
<p>that Raquel had with her boyfriend before she died,</p>
<p>it might be a dead end</p>
<p>even if Detective Jacobson does get a match.</p>
<p>He said it would still be good</p>
<p>to rule it out one way or the other,</p>
<p>since examiners at the time</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t determine whether or not</p>
<p>Raquel was sexually assaulted at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson says that</p>
<p>his gut still tells him</p>
<p>that Raquel was targeted</p>
<p>because of her family member&rsquo;s drug debt,</p>
<p>not a stranger attack or a serial killer.</p>
<p>He thinks her killers knew her,</p>
<p>or at least knew her family.</p>
<p>Poor Raquel paid the ultimate price</p>
<p>when they saw her walking down the street</p>
<p>at 1.30 or 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning on June 30th.</p>
<p>But in the absence of a confession</p>
<p>or being able to locate any suspects for interviews,</p>
<p>it will take another good witness</p>
<p>or a genealogy match on DNA</p>
<p>for him to prove his theory.</p>
<p>Raquel Ramirez&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>has taken a big toll on her family.</p>
<p>Her mom Juana passed away in 2018</p>
<p>without knowing how or why her daughter was killed.</p>
<p>Brenda, who&rsquo;s now in her 40s,</p>
<p>has kept her mother&rsquo;s legacy alive</p>
<p>through her own children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>They know who their grandmother is,</p>
<p>and they know how painful it is.</p>
<p>Raquel&rsquo;s kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids</p>
<p>are still left seeking answers.</p>
<p>If the person that murdered the moms</p>
<p>or persons that were involved in murdering moms,</p>
<p>I wish they would come forward in just 36 years.</p>
<p>And I believe my moms deserve that justice.</p>
<p>To know that that person is paying for what they did,</p>
<p>for what they took away from this family.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t take it away from just one individual.</p>
<p>They took it away from so many people.</p>
<p>Those are memories that were never made,</p>
<p>of things that were never settled with it.</p>
<p>Not that I could get her back,</p>
<p>just to get that justice.</p>
<p>Please, if you know anything</p>
<p>about Raquel&rsquo;s 1985 murder in Hartford, Connecticut,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to speak up.</p>
