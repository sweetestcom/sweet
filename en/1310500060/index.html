    <p>The following is a conversation with S. James Gates, Jr.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a theoretical physicist and professor at Brown University,</p>
<p>working on supersymmetry, supergravity, and superstring theory.</p>
<p>He served on former President Obama&rsquo;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s now the coauthor of a new book titled Proving Einstein Right,</p>
<p>about the scientists who set out to prove Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I&rsquo;ve been speaking with not just computer scientists,</p>
<p>but philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, economists, and soon, much more.</p>
<p>To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.</p>
<p>It is our civilization&rsquo;s journey into understanding the human mind</p>
<p>and creating echoes of it in the machine.</p>
<p>That journey includes, of course, the world of theoretical physics</p>
<p>and its practice of first principles mathematical thinking</p>
<p>and exploring the fundamental nature of our reality.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts or YouTube or Twitter,</p>
<p>consider mentioning ideas, people, topics you find interesting.</p>
<p>It helps guide the future of this podcast.</p>
<p>But in general, I just love comments that are full of kindness and thoughtfulness in them.</p>
<p>This podcast is a side project for me, but I still put a lot of effort into it.</p>
<p>So the positive words of support from an amazing community, from you, really help.</p>
<p>I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>I provide timestamps for the start of the conversations you may have noticed</p>
<p>that you can skip to, but it helps if you listen to the ad</p>
<p>and support this podcast by trying out the product or service being advertised.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations called First,</p>
<p>best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,</p>
<p>which means the donated money is used to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use code LEXPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,</p>
<p>which again is an organization that I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys</p>
<p>to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with S. James Gates Jr.</p>
<p>You tell a story when you were eight.</p>
<p>You had a profound realization that the stars in the sky</p>
<p>are actually places that we could travel to one day.</p>
<p>Do you think human beings will ever venture outside our solar system?</p>
<p>Wow, the question of whether humanity gets outside of the solar system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a challenge,</p>
<p>and as long as the laws of physics that we have today are accurate and valid,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be extraordinarily difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a science fiction fan, as you probably know,</p>
<p>so I love to dream of starships and traveling to other solar systems,</p>
<p>but the barriers are just formidable.</p>
<p>If we just kind of venture a little bit into science fiction,</p>
<p>do you think the spaceships, if we are successful,</p>
<p>that take us outside the solar system,</p>
<p>will look like the ones we have today,</p>
<p>or are fundamental breakthroughs necessary?</p>
<p>In order to have genuine starships,</p>
<p>probably some really radical views about the way the universe works</p>
<p>are going to have to take place in our science.</p>
<p>We could, with our current technology,</p>
<p>think about constructing multigenerational starships</p>
<p>where the people who get on them are not the people who get off at the other end.</p>
<p>But even if we do that, the formidable problem is actually our bodies,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t seem to be conscious for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Even getting to Mars is going to present this challenge,</p>
<p>because we live in this wonderful home,</p>
<p>has a protective magnetic magnetosphere around it,</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re shielded from cosmic radiation.</p>
<p>Once you leave this shield, there are some estimates that,</p>
<p>for example, if you sent someone to Mars,</p>
<p>with our technology, probably about two years out there without the shield,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be bombarded.</p>
<p>That means radiation, probably means cancer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the most formidable challenges,</p>
<p>even if we could get over the technology.</p>
<p>Do you think, so Mars is a harsh place.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, SpaceX and other folks,</p>
<p>NASA are really pushing to put a human being on Mars.</p>
<p>Do you think, again, let&rsquo;s forgive me</p>
<p>for lingering in science fiction land for a little bit.</p>
<p>Do you think one day we may be able to colonize Mars?</p>
<p>First, do you think we&rsquo;ll put a human on Mars,</p>
<p>and then do you think we&rsquo;ll put many humans on Mars?</p>
<p>So first of all, I am extraordinarily convinced</p>
<p>we will not put a human on Mars by 2030,</p>
<p>which is a date that you often hear in the public debate.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the challenge there?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>So there are a couple of ways that I could slice this,</p>
<p>but the one that I think is simplest for people to understand involves money.</p>
<p>So you look at how we got to the moon in the 1960s.</p>
<p>It was about 10 year duration</p>
<p>between the challenge that President Kennedy laid out</p>
<p>and our successfully landing a moon.</p>
<p>I was actually here at MIT</p>
<p>when that first moon landing occurred,</p>
<p>so I remember watching it on TV.</p>
<p>But how did we get there?</p>
<p>Well, we had this extraordinarily technical agency</p>
<p>of the United States government, NASA.</p>
<p>It consumed about 5% of the country&rsquo;s economic output.</p>
<p>And so you say 5% of the economic output</p>
<p>over about a 10 year period gets us 250,000 miles in space.</p>
<p>Mars is about a hundred times farther.</p>
<p>So you have at least a hundred times the challenge</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re spending about one tenth of the funds</p>
<p>that we spent then as a government.</p>
<p>So my claim is that it&rsquo;s at least a thousand times harder</p>
<p>for me to imagine us getting to Mars by 2030.</p>
<p>And he had that part that you mentioned in the speech</p>
<p>that I just have to throw in there of JFK,</p>
<p>of we do these things not because they&rsquo;re easy,</p>
<p>but because they&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a beautiful line</p>
<p>that I would love to hear a modern president say</p>
<p>about a scientific endeavor.</p>
<p>Well, one day we live and hope</p>
<p>that such a president will arise for our nation.</p>
<p>But even if, like I said,</p>
<p>even if you fix the technical problems,</p>
<p>the biological engineering that I worry most about,</p>
<p>however, I&rsquo;m gonna go out on a limb here.</p>
<p>I think that by 2090 or so,</p>
<p>or 2100, should I say 120,</p>
<p>I suspect we&rsquo;re gonna have a human on Mars.</p>
<p>Wow, so you think that many years out,</p>
<p>first a few tangents.</p>
<p>You said bioengineering is a challenge.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the challenge there?</p>
<p>So as I said, the real problem with interstellar travel,</p>
<p>aside from the technology challenges,</p>
<p>the real problem is radiation.</p>
<p>And how do you engineer either an environment or a body,</p>
<p>because we see rapid advances going on in bioengineering,</p>
<p>how do you engineer either a ship or a body</p>
<p>so that something, some person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s recognizably human will survive</p>
<p>the rigors of interplanetary space travel?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more difficult than most people</p>
<p>seem to take into account.</p>
<p>So if we could linger on the 2090, 2100, 2120,</p>
<p>sort of thinking of that kind of,</p>
<p>you know, and let&rsquo;s linger on money.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are pushing the cost,</p>
<p>trying to push the cost down.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, so do you have hope</p>
<p>as this actually sort of a brilliant big picture scientist,</p>
<p>do you think a business entrepreneur can take science</p>
<p>and make it cheaper and get it out there faster?</p>
<p>So bending the cost curve is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that has been an anchor.</p>
<p>This is the simplest way for me to discuss this with people</p>
<p>about what the challenge is.</p>
<p>So yes, bending the cost curve is certainly critical</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to be successful.</p>
<p>Now, you asked about the endeavors that are out there now</p>
<p>sponsored by two very prominent American citizens,</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed actually in what I see</p>
<p>in terms of the routes that are being pursued.</p>
<p>So let me give you one example there.</p>
<p>And this one is going to be a little bit more technical.</p>
<p>So if you look at the kinds of rockets</p>
<p>that both these organizations are creating,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s wonderful, reusable technology</p>
<p>to see a rocket go up and land on its fins</p>
<p>just like it did in science fiction movies</p>
<p>when I was a kid, that&rsquo;s astounding.</p>
<p>But the real problem is those rockets,</p>
<p>the technology that we&rsquo;re doing now</p>
<p>is not really that different</p>
<p>than what was used to go to the moon.</p>
<p>And there are alternatives it turns out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an engine called a flare engine,</p>
<p>which so a traditional rocket,</p>
<p>if you look at the engine, it looks like a bell, right?</p>
<p>And then the flame comes out the bottom.</p>
<p>But there is a kind of engine called a flare engine,</p>
<p>which is essentially, when you look at it,</p>
<p>it looks like an exhaust pipe</p>
<p>on like a fancy car that&rsquo;s long and elongated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a type of rocket engine</p>
<p>that we know there&rsquo;ve been preliminary testing,</p>
<p>we know it works.</p>
<p>And it also is actually much more economical</p>
<p>because what it does is allow you</p>
<p>to vary the amount of thrust as you go up.</p>
<p>In a way that you cannot do</p>
<p>with one of these bell shaped engines.</p>
<p>So you would think that an entrepreneur</p>
<p>might try to have the breakthrough to use flare nozzles,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called, as a way to bend the cost curve.</p>
<p>Because as we keep coming back,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be a big factor.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>In fact, what we see is what I think of as incremental change</p>
<p>in terms of our technology.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not really very encouraged by what I personally see.</p>
<p>So incremental change won&rsquo;t bend the cost curve.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Just linger on the sci fi for one more question.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re alone in the universe?</p>
<p>Are we the only intelligent form of life?</p>
<p>So there is a quote by Carl Sagan,</p>
<p>which I really love when I hear this question.</p>
<p>And I recall the quote,</p>
<p>and it goes something like,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re the only conscious life in the universe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in a terrible waste of space</p>
<p>because the universe is an incredibly big place.</p>
<p>And when Carl made that statement,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know about the profusion of planets</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>In the last decade,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve discovered over a thousand planets</p>
<p>and a substantial number of those planets are Earth like</p>
<p>in terms of being in the Goldilocks zone as it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>So in my mind, it&rsquo;s practically inconceivable</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re the only conscious form of life in the universe.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ve come to visit us.</p>
<p>Do you think they would look,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll recognize alien life if we saw it?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;d look anything like the carbon base,</p>
<p>the biological system we have on Earth today?</p>
<p>It would depend on that life&rsquo;s native environment</p>
<p>in which it arose.</p>
<p>If that environment was sufficiently like our environment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a principle in biology and nature called convergence,</p>
<p>which is that even if you have two biological systems</p>
<p>that are totally separated from each other,</p>
<p>if they face similar conditions,</p>
<p>nature tends to converge on solutions.</p>
<p>And so there might be similarities</p>
<p>if this alien life form was born in a place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of like this place.</p>
<p>Physics appears to be quite similar,</p>
<p>the laws of physics across the entirety of the universe.</p>
<p>Do you think weirder things than we see on Earth</p>
<p>can spring up out of the same kinds of laws of physics?</p>
<p>From the laws of physics, I would say yes.</p>
<p>First of all, if you look at carbon based life,</p>
<p>why are we carbon based?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it&rsquo;s because of the way</p>
<p>that carbon interacts with elements,</p>
<p>which in fact is also a reflection</p>
<p>on the electronic structure of the carbon nucleus.</p>
<p>So you can look down the table of elements and say,</p>
<p>well, gee, do we see similar elements?</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>And one that one often hears about</p>
<p>in science fiction is silicon.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s a silicon based life form out there</p>
<p>if the conditions are right.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s presumptuous of us</p>
<p>to think that we are the template</p>
<p>by which all life has to appear.</p>
<p>Before we dive into beautiful details,</p>
<p>let me ask a big question.</p>
<p>What to you is the most beautiful idea,</p>
<p>maybe the most surprising, mysterious idea in physics?</p>
<p>The most surprising idea to me</p>
<p>is that we can actually do physics.</p>
<p>The universe did not have to be constructed</p>
<p>in such a way with our limited intellectual capacity</p>
<p>that is actually put together in such a way</p>
<p>and that we are put together in such a way</p>
<p>that we can, with our mind&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>delve incredibly deeply into the structure of the universe.</p>
<p>That to me is pretty close to a miracle.</p>
<p>So there are simple equations, relatively simple,</p>
<p>that can describe things, the fundamental functions.</p>
<p>They can describe everything about our reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, can you imagine universes</p>
<p>where everything is a lot more complicated?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s something inherent about universes</p>
<p>that simple laws are&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, first of all, let me,</p>
<p>this is a question that I encounter in a number of guides.</p>
<p>A lot of people will raise the question</p>
<p>about whether mathematics is the language of the universe.</p>
<p>And my response is mathematics is the language</p>
<p>that we humans are capable of using in describing the universe.</p>
<p>It may have little to do with the universe,</p>
<p>but in terms of our capacity, it&rsquo;s the microscope,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the telescope through which we,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the lens through which we are able to view the universe</p>
<p>with the precision that no other human language allows.</p>
<p>So could there be other universes?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t even know if this one looks like I think it does.</p>
<p>But the beautiful surprising thing is that physics,</p>
<p>there are laws of physics, very few laws of physics</p>
<p>that can effectively compress down</p>
<p>the functioning of the universe.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s extraordinarily surprising.</p>
<p>I like to use the analogy</p>
<p>with computers and information technology.</p>
<p>If you worry about transmitting large bundles of data,</p>
<p>one of the things that computer scientists do for us</p>
<p>is they allow for processes that are called compression,</p>
<p>where you take big packets of data</p>
<p>and you press them down into much smaller packets,</p>
<p>and then you transmit those</p>
<p>and then unpack them at the other end.</p>
<p>And so it looks a little bit to me</p>
<p>like the universe has kind of done us a favor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constructed our minds in such a way</p>
<p>that we have this thing called mathematics,</p>
<p>which then as we look at the universe,</p>
<p>teaches us how to carry out the compression process.</p>
<p>A quick question about compression.</p>
<p>Do you think the human mind can be compressed?</p>
<p>The biology can be compressed?</p>
<p>We talked about space travel.</p>
<p>To be able to compress the information</p>
<p>that captures some large percent of what it means</p>
<p>to be me or you,</p>
<p>and then be able to send that at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a big question.</p>
<p>And let me try to take it apart,</p>
<p>unpack it into several pieces.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that wetware biology such as we are</p>
<p>has an exclusive patent on intellectual consciousness.</p>
<p>I suspect that other structures in the universe</p>
<p>are perfectly capable of producing the data streams</p>
<p>that we use to process, first of all,</p>
<p>our observations of the universe</p>
<p>and an awareness of ourself.</p>
<p>I can imagine other structures can do that also.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part of what you were talking about,</p>
<p>which I would have some disagreement with.</p>
<p>Consciousness.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most interesting part of us humans?</p>
<p>Is consciousness the thing?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the most interesting thing about humans.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s other entities</p>
<p>throughout the universe.</p>
<p>I can well imagine that the architecture</p>
<p>that supports our consciousness, again,</p>
<p>has no patent on consciousness.</p>
<p>Just in case you have an interesting thought here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s folks perhaps in philosophy called panpsychists</p>
<p>that believe consciousness underlies everything.</p>
<p>It is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense that that could possibly fit into&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>One part of that belief system is giya,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s a kind of conscious life force</p>
<p>about our planet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve encountered these things before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know what to make of them.</p>
<p>My own life experience, and I&rsquo;ll be 69 in about two months,</p>
<p>and I have spent all my adulthood thinking about</p>
<p>the way that mathematics interacts with nature</p>
<p>and with us to try to understand nature.</p>
<p>And all I can tell you from all of my integrated experience</p>
<p>is that there is something extraordinarily mysterious</p>
<p>to me about our universe.</p>
<p>This is something that Einstein said</p>
<p>from his life experience as a scientist.</p>
<p>And this mysteriousness almost feels</p>
<p>like the universe is our parent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very strange thing perhaps to hear scientists say,</p>
<p>but there are just so many strange coincidences</p>
<p>that you just get a sense that something is going on.</p>
<p>Well, I interrupted you.</p>
<p>In terms of compressing what we&rsquo;re down to,</p>
<p>we can send it at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the first thing is I would argue that it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>very likely that artificial intelligence</p>
<p>ultimately will develop something like consciousness,</p>
<p>something that for us will probably be indistinguishable</p>
<p>from consciousness.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I meant by our biological processing equipment</p>
<p>that we carry up here probably does not hold a patent</p>
<p>on consciousness, because it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>about the data streams.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, that&rsquo;s what we are.</p>
<p>We are self actuating, self learning data streams.</p>
<p>That to me is most accurate way I can tell you</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve seen in my lifetime about what humans are</p>
<p>at the level of consciousness.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s the case, then you just need to have</p>
<p>an architecture that supports that information processing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s assume that that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>that in fact what we call consciousness is really about</p>
<p>a very peculiar kind of data stream.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, then if you can export that</p>
<p>to a piece of hardware, something metal,</p>
<p>electronic, what have you, then you certainly will,</p>
<p>ultimately that kind of consciousness could get to Mars</p>
<p>very quickly, it doesn&rsquo;t have our problems.</p>
<p>You can engineer the body, as I said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a ship or a body, you engineer one or both.</p>
<p>Send it at a speed of light, well,</p>
<p>that one is a more difficult one because that now</p>
<p>goes beyond just a matter of having a data stream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now the preservation of the information</p>
<p>in the data stream.</p>
<p>And so unless you can build something that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a super, super, super version of the way the internet works</p>
<p>because most people aren&rsquo;t aware that the internet itself</p>
<p>is actually a miracle, it&rsquo;s based on a technology</p>
<p>called message packaging.</p>
<p>So if you could exponentiate message packaging</p>
<p>in some way to preserve the information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the data stream, then maybe</p>
<p>your dream becomes true.</p>
<p>You mentioned with artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>sort of us human beings not having</p>
<p>a monopoly on consciousness.</p>
<p>Does the idea of artificial intelligence systems,</p>
<p>computational systems, being able to basically</p>
<p>replacing us humans scare you, excite you?</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna tell you about a conversation</p>
<p>I once had with Eric Schmidt.</p>
<p>I was sitting at a meeting with him</p>
<p>and he was a few feet away and he turned to me</p>
<p>and he said something like, you know, Jim,</p>
<p>in maybe a decade or so, we&rsquo;re gonna have computers</p>
<p>that do what you do.</p>
<p>And my response was not unless they can dream</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>the way that we humans actually generate creativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow, I get this sense of my lived experience</p>
<p>in watching creative people that it&rsquo;s somehow</p>
<p>connected to the irrational parts of what goes on</p>
<p>in our head and dreaming is part of that irrational.</p>
<p>So unless you can build a piece of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>that dreams, I have a strong suspicion</p>
<p>that you will not get something that will fully be conscious</p>
<p>by a definition that I would accept, for example.</p>
<p>So you mentioned dreaming.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve played around with some out there fascinating ideas.</p>
<p>How do you think, and we&rsquo;ll start diving into</p>
<p>the world of the very small ideas of super symmetry</p>
<p>and all that in terms of visualization,</p>
<p>in terms of how do you think about it?</p>
<p>How do you dream of it?</p>
<p>How do you come up with ideas</p>
<p>in that fascinating, mysterious space?</p>
<p>So in my workspace, which is basically</p>
<p>where I am charged with coming up on a mathematical palette</p>
<p>with new ideas that will help me understand</p>
<p>the structure of nature and hopefully help all of us</p>
<p>understand the structure of nature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed several different ways</p>
<p>in which my creativity expresses itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one mode which looks pretty normal,</p>
<p>which I sort of think of as the Chinese water torture method.</p>
<p>Drop, drop, drop, you get more and more information</p>
<p>and suddenly it all congeals and you get a clear picture.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of a standard way of working.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s how most people think about</p>
<p>the way technical people solve problems.</p>
<p>That is kind of you accumulate this body of information</p>
<p>and at a certain point you synthesize it</p>
<p>and then boom, there&rsquo;s something new.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also observed in myself and other scientists</p>
<p>that there are other ways that we are creative.</p>
<p>And these other ways to me are actually far more powerful.</p>
<p>I first personally experienced this</p>
<p>when I was a freshman at MIT over in Baker House</p>
<p>right across the campus.</p>
<p>And I was in a calculus course, 1801 is called at MIT.</p>
<p>And calculus comes in two different flavors.</p>
<p>One of them is called differential calculus.</p>
<p>The other is called integral calculus.</p>
<p>Differential calculus is the calculus</p>
<p>that Newton invented to describe motion.</p>
<p>It turns out integral calculus was probably invented</p>
<p>about 1700 years earlier by Archimedes.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t know that when I was a freshman.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s what you study as a student.</p>
<p>And the differential calculus part of the course was,</p>
<p>to me, I wouldn&rsquo;t, how do I say this?</p>
<p>It was something that by the drip, drip, drip method</p>
<p>you could sort of figure it out.</p>
<p>Now, the integral part of calculus,</p>
<p>I could memorize the formula.</p>
<p>That was not the formulae, that was not the problem.</p>
<p>The problem was why, in my own mind,</p>
<p>why do these formulae work?</p>
<p>And because of that, when I was in the part</p>
<p>of the calculus course where we had to do</p>
<p>multiple substitutions to solve integrals,</p>
<p>I had a lot of difficulty.</p>
<p>I was emotionally involved in my education</p>
<p>because this is where I think the passion of motion comes to.</p>
<p>And it caused an emotional crisis</p>
<p>that I was having these difficulties</p>
<p>understanding the integral part of calculus.</p>
<p>The why.</p>
<p>The why, that&rsquo;s right, the why of it.</p>
<p>Not the rote memorization of fact,</p>
<p>but the why of it.</p>
<p>Why does this work?</p>
<p>And so one night I was over in my dormitory room</p>
<p>in Baker House.</p>
<p>I was trying to do a calculus problem set.</p>
<p>I was getting nowhere.</p>
<p>I got a terrific headache.</p>
<p>I went to sleep and had this very strange dream.</p>
<p>And when I woke, awakened,</p>
<p>I could do three and four substitutions</p>
<p>and integrals with relative ease.</p>
<p>Now, this to me was an astounding experience</p>
<p>because I had never before in my life understood</p>
<p>that one subconscious is actually capable</p>
<p>of being harnessed to do mathematics.</p>
<p>I experienced it, this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve experienced this more than once.</p>
<p>So this was just the first time why I remember it so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why when it comes to like</p>
<p>really wickedly tough problems,</p>
<p>I think that the kind of creativity</p>
<p>that you need to solve them</p>
<p>is probably this second variety</p>
<p>which comes somehow from dreaming.</p>
<p>Do you think, again, I told you I&rsquo;m Russian.</p>
<p>So we romanticize suffering.</p>
<p>But do you think part of that equation</p>
<p>is the suffering leading up to that dreaming?</p>
<p>So the suffering is,</p>
<p>I am convinced that this kind of creative,</p>
<p>this second mode of creativity as I like to call it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that this second mode of creativity</p>
<p>is in fact that suffering is a kind of crucible</p>
<p>that triggers it.</p>
<p>Because the mind I think is struggling to get out of this.</p>
<p>And the only way to actually solve the problem.</p>
<p>And even though you&rsquo;re not consciously solving problems,</p>
<p>something is going on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about to a few other people</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve heard other similar stories.</p>
<p>And so I guess what I think about it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit by like the way</p>
<p>that thermonuclear weapons work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know how they work.</p>
<p>But a thermonuclear weapon is actually two bombs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an atomic bomb which sort of does a compression.</p>
<p>And then you have a fusion bomb that goes off.</p>
<p>And somehow that emotional pressure</p>
<p>I think acts like the first stage of a thermonuclear weapon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when we get really big thoughts.</p>
<p>The analogy between thermonuclear weapons</p>
<p>and the subconscious, the connection there is,</p>
<p>at least visually, is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>There may be, Freud would have a few things to say.</p>
<p>Well, part of it is probably based</p>
<p>on my own trajectory through life.</p>
<p>My father was in the US Army for 27 years.</p>
<p>And so I started my life out on a military basis.</p>
<p>And so a lot of probably the things that wander around</p>
<p>in my subconscious are connected to that experience.</p>
<p>I apologize for all the tangents, but.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re encouraging by answering the stupid questions.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not stupid.</p>
<p>You know, your father was in the Army.</p>
<p>What do you think about, Neil deGrasse Tyson recently wrote</p>
<p>a book on interlinking the progress of science</p>
<p>to sort of the aspirations of our military endeavors</p>
<p>and DARPA funding and so on.</p>
<p>What do you think about war in general?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll always have war?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll always have conflict in the world?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that we&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to afford to have war always, because if.</p>
<p>Strictly financially speaking?</p>
<p>No, not in terms of finance, but in terms of consequences.</p>
<p>So if you look at technology today,</p>
<p>you can have non state actors acquire technology,</p>
<p>for example, bioterrorism, whose impact is roughly speaking</p>
<p>equivalent to what it used to take nations</p>
<p>to impart on a population.</p>
<p>I think the cost of war is ultimately,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a little, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to work a little bit like the Cold War.</p>
<p>You know, we survived 50, 60 years as a species</p>
<p>with these weapons that are so terrible that they could have</p>
<p>actually ended our form of life on this planet, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a very bizarre and interesting thing,</p>
<p>but it was called mutually assured destruction.</p>
<p>And so the cost was so great that people eventually</p>
<p>figured out that you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>use these things, which is kind of interesting,</p>
<p>because if you read the history about the development</p>
<p>of nuclear weapons, physicists actually</p>
<p>realized this pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I think it was maybe Schrodinger who</p>
<p>said that these things are not really weapons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re political implements.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not weapons, because the cost is so high.</p>
<p>And if you take that example and spread it out</p>
<p>to the kind of technological development</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing now outside of nuclear physics,</p>
<p>but I picked the example of biology,</p>
<p>I could well imagine that there would be material science</p>
<p>sorts of equivalents across a broad front of technology.</p>
<p>You take that experience from nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>and the picture that I see is that it would be possible</p>
<p>to develop technologies that are so terrible that you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use them, because the costs are too high.</p>
<p>And that might cure us.</p>
<p>And many people have argued that actually it prevented,</p>
<p>nuclear weapons have prevented more military conflict than.</p>
<p>It certainly froze the conflict domain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that nowadays it</p>
<p>was with the removal of the threat of mutually assured</p>
<p>destruction that other forces took over in our geopolitics.</p>
<p>Do you have worries of existential threats</p>
<p>of nuclear weapons or other technologies</p>
<p>like artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>Do you think we humans will tend to figure out</p>
<p>how to not blow ourselves up?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, quite frankly.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve thought about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not, I mean, so I&rsquo;m a spectator in the sense</p>
<p>that as a scientist, I collect and collate data.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been doing that all my life</p>
<p>and looking at my species.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not clear to me that we are</p>
<p>going to avoid a catastrophic, self induced ending.</p>
<p>Are you optimistic?</p>
<p>Not as a scientist, but as a single element speaker?</p>
<p>I would say I wouldn&rsquo;t bet against us.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the world of the very small,</p>
<p>if we could for a bit.</p>
<p>What are the basic particles, either experimentally observed</p>
<p>or hypothesized by physicists?</p>
<p>So as we physicists look at the universe,</p>
<p>you can, first of all, there are two big buckets of particles.</p>
<p>That is the smallest objects that we</p>
<p>are able to currently mathematically conceive</p>
<p>and then experimentally verify that these ideas have</p>
<p>a sense of accuracy to them.</p>
<p>So one of those buckets we call matter.</p>
<p>These are things like electrons, things</p>
<p>that are like quarks, which are particles that</p>
<p>exist inside of protons.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole family of these things.</p>
<p>There are, in fact, 18 quarks and apparently six</p>
<p>electron like objects that we call leptons.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one bucket.</p>
<p>The other bucket that we see both in our mathematics</p>
<p>as well as in our experimental equipment</p>
<p>are a set of particles that you can call force carriers.</p>
<p>The most familiar force carrier is the photon, the particle</p>
<p>of light that allows you to see me.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the same object that</p>
<p>carries electric repulsion between like charges.</p>
<p>From science fiction, we have the object</p>
<p>called the graviton, which is talked about a lot in science</p>
<p>fiction and Star Trek.</p>
<p>But the graviton is also a mathematical object</p>
<p>that we physicists have known about essentially</p>
<p>since Einstein wrote his theory of general relativity.</p>
<p>There are four forces in nature, the fundamental forces.</p>
<p>There is the gravitational force.</p>
<p>Its carrier is the graviton.</p>
<p>There are three other forces in nature,</p>
<p>the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force,</p>
<p>and the weak nuclear force.</p>
<p>And each one of these forces has one or more carriers.</p>
<p>The photon is the carrier of the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>The strong nuclear force actually has eight carriers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called gluons.</p>
<p>And then the weak nuclear force has three carriers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called the W plus, W minus, and Z bosons.</p>
<p>So those are the things that both in mathematics</p>
<p>and in experiments, by the way, the most precise experiments</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re ever as a species able to conduct</p>
<p>is about measuring the accuracy of these ideas.</p>
<p>And we know that at least to one part in a billion,</p>
<p>these ideas are right.</p>
<p>So first of all, you&rsquo;ve made it sound both elegant and simple.</p>
<p>But is it crazy to you that there is force carriers?</p>
<p>Like, is that supposed to be a trivial idea to think about?</p>
<p>If we think about photons, gluons,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s four fundamental forces of physics,</p>
<p>and then those forces are expressed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s carriers of those forces.</p>
<p>Like, is that a kind of trivial thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a trivial thing at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a puzzle for Sir Isaac Newton,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s the first person to give us basically physics.</p>
<p>Before Isaac Newton, physics didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>What did exist was called natural philosophy,</p>
<p>so discussions about using the methods of classical philosophy</p>
<p>to understand nature, natural philosophy.</p>
<p>So the Greeks, we call them scientists,</p>
<p>but they were natural philosophers.</p>
<p>Physics doesn&rsquo;t get born until Newton writes the Principia.</p>
<p>One of the things that puzzled him was how gravity works,</p>
<p>because if you read very carefully what he writes,</p>
<p>he basically says, and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing badly,</p>
<p>but he basically says that someone who thinks deeply</p>
<p>about this subject would find it inconceivable</p>
<p>that an object in one place or location</p>
<p>can magically reach out and affect another object</p>
<p>with nothing intervening.</p>
<p>And so it puzzled him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a puzzle of you, action at a distance.</p>
<p>I mean, not as a physicist.</p>
<p>It would, it would, except that I am a physicist,</p>
<p>and we have long ago resolved this issue,</p>
<p>and the resolution came about</p>
<p>through a second great physicist.</p>
<p>Most people have heard of Newton.</p>
<p>Most people have heard of Einstein.</p>
<p>But between the two of them,</p>
<p>there was another extraordinarily great physicist,</p>
<p>a man named James Clark Maxwell.</p>
<p>And Maxwell, between these two other giants,</p>
<p>taught us about electric and magnetic forces,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s from his equations that one can figure out</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a carrier called the photon.</p>
<p>So this was resolved for physicists around 1860 or so.</p>
<p>So what are bosons and fermions and hadrons,</p>
<p>elementary and composites?</p>
<p>Sure, so earlier I said.</p>
<p>Two buckets.</p>
<p>You have got two buckets</p>
<p>if you wanna try to build the universe.</p>
<p>You gotta start off with things on these two buckets.</p>
<p>So you gotta have things, that&rsquo;s a matter,</p>
<p>and then you have to have other objects that act on them</p>
<p>to cause those things to cohere to fixed finite patterns,</p>
<p>because you need those fixed finite patterns</p>
<p>as building blocks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way our universe looks to people like me.</p>
<p>Now, the building blocks do different things.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to these two buckets again.</p>
<p>Let me start with a bucket containing the particle of light.</p>
<p>Let me imagine I&rsquo;m in a dusty room with two flashlights,</p>
<p>and I have one flashlight, which I direct directly</p>
<p>in front of me, and then I have you stand over to say my left</p>
<p>and then we both take our flashlights and turn them on</p>
<p>and make sure the beams go right through each other.</p>
<p>And the beams do just that.</p>
<p>They go right through each other.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t bounce off of each other.</p>
<p>The reason the room has to be dusty</p>
<p>is because we wanna see the light.</p>
<p>The room dust wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t actually see the light</p>
<p>until it got to the other wall, right?</p>
<p>So you see the beam because it&rsquo;s the dust in the air.</p>
<p>But the two beams actually pass right through each other.</p>
<p>They literally pass right through.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t affect each other at all.</p>
<p>One acts like the other&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>The particle of light is the simplest example</p>
<p>that shows that behavior.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a boson.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine that we&rsquo;re in the same dusty room</p>
<p>and this time you have a bucket of balls</p>
<p>and I have a bucket of balls.</p>
<p>And we try to throw them so that we get something</p>
<p>like a beam, throwing them fast, right?</p>
<p>If they collide, they don&rsquo;t just pass through each other.</p>
<p>They bounce off of each other.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s mostly because they have electric charge</p>
<p>and electric charges, light charges repel.</p>
<p>But mathematically, I know how to turn off</p>
<p>the electric charge.</p>
<p>And if you do that, you&rsquo;ll find these still repel.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because they are these things we call fermions.</p>
<p>So this is how you distinguish the things</p>
<p>that are in the two buckets.</p>
<p>They are either bosons or fermions.</p>
<p>Which of them, and maybe you can mention</p>
<p>the most popular of the bosons.</p>
<p>The most recently discovered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I was in high school</p>
<p>and there was a really popular majorette.</p>
<p>Her name is the Higgs particle these days.</p>
<p>Can you describe which of the bosons</p>
<p>and the fermions have been discovered,</p>
<p>hypothesized, which have been experimentally validated,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s still out there?</p>
<p>Right, so the two buckets that I&rsquo;ve actually described</p>
<p>to you have all been first hypothesized</p>
<p>and then verified by observation.</p>
<p>With the Higgs boson being the most recent</p>
<p>one of these things.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t actually verified the graviton</p>
<p>interestingly enough.</p>
<p>Mathematically, we have an expectation</p>
<p>that gravitons exist.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve not performed an experiment</p>
<p>to show that this is an accurate idea that nature uses.</p>
<p>So something has to be a carrier.</p>
<p>For the force of gravity, exactly.</p>
<p>Can it be something way more mysterious than we,</p>
<p>so when you say the graviton, is it,</p>
<p>would it be like the other particles, force carriers,</p>
<p>or can it be something much more mysterious?</p>
<p>In some ways, yes, but in other ways, no.</p>
<p>It turns out that the graviton is also,</p>
<p>if you look at Einstein&rsquo;s theory,</p>
<p>he taught us about this thing he calls space time,</p>
<p>which is, if you try to imagine it,</p>
<p>you can sort of think of it as kind of a rubber surface.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one popular depiction of space time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an accurate depiction</p>
<p>because the only accuracy is actually in the calculus</p>
<p>that he uses, but that&rsquo;s close enough.</p>
<p>So if you have a sheet of rubber, you can wave it.</p>
<p>You can actually form a wave on it.</p>
<p>Space time is enough like that</p>
<p>so that when space time oscillates, you create these waves.</p>
<p>These waves carry energy.</p>
<p>We expect them to carry energy in quanta.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a graviton is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wave in space time.</p>
<p>And so the fact that we have seen the waves</p>
<p>with LIGO over the course of the last three years,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve recently used gravitational wave observatories</p>
<p>to watch colliding black holes and neutron stars</p>
<p>and all sorts of really cool stuff out there.</p>
<p>So we know the waves exist,</p>
<p>but in order to know that gravitons exist,</p>
<p>you have to prove that these waves carry energy</p>
<p>in energy packets.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we don&rsquo;t have the technology to do yet.</p>
<p>And perhaps briefly jumping to a philosophical question,</p>
<p>does it make sense to you that gravity</p>
<p>is so much weaker than the other forces?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You see, now you&rsquo;ve touched on a very deep mystery</p>
<p>about physics.</p>
<p>There are a lot of such questions in physics</p>
<p>about why things are as they are.</p>
<p>And as someone who believes that there are some things</p>
<p>that certainly are coincidences,</p>
<p>like you could ask the same question about,</p>
<p>well, why are the planets at the orbits</p>
<p>that they are around the sun?</p>
<p>The answer turns out there is no good reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an accident.</p>
<p>So there are things in nature that have that character.</p>
<p>And perhaps the strength of the various forces is like that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And there may be some deep reasons</p>
<p>about why the forces are ordered as they are,</p>
<p>where the weakest force is gravity,</p>
<p>the next weakest force is the weak interaction,</p>
<p>the weak nuclear force, then there&rsquo;s electromagnetism,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a strong force.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have a good understanding</p>
<p>of why this is the ordering of the forces.</p>
<p>So some of the fascinating work you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is in the space of supersymmetry, symmetry in general.</p>
<p>Can you describe, first of all, what is supersymmetry?</p>
<p>Yes, so you remember the two buckets</p>
<p>I told you about perhaps earlier?</p>
<p>So there are two buckets in our universe.</p>
<p>So now I want you to think about drawing a pie</p>
<p>that has four quadrants.</p>
<p>So I want you to cut the piece of pie in fourths.</p>
<p>So in one quadrant, I&rsquo;m gonna put all the buckets</p>
<p>that we talked about that are like the electron and quarks.</p>
<p>In a different quadrant,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put all the force carriers.</p>
<p>The other two quadrants are empty.</p>
<p>Now, I showed you a picture of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d see a circle.</p>
<p>There would be a bunch of stuff in one upper quadrant</p>
<p>and stuff in others.</p>
<p>And then I would ask you a question.</p>
<p>Does that look symmetrical to you?</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly right</p>
<p>because we humans actually have a very deeply programmed</p>
<p>sense of symmetry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that is part of that mystery of the universe.</p>
<p>So how would you make it symmetrical?</p>
<p>Or one way you could is by saying</p>
<p>those two empty quadrants had things in them also.</p>
<p>And if you do that, that&rsquo;s supersymmetry.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I understood</p>
<p>when I was a graduate student here at MIT in 1975</p>
<p>when the mathematics of this was first being born.</p>
<p>Supersymmetry was actually born in the Ukraine</p>
<p>in the late 60s, but we had this thing</p>
<p>called the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>So we Westerners didn&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>But by the early 70s, independently,</p>
<p>there were scientists in the West</p>
<p>who had rediscovered supersymmetry.</p>
<p>Bruno Zemeno and Julius Wess were their names.</p>
<p>So this was around 71 or 72 when this happened.</p>
<p>I started graduate school in 73.</p>
<p>So around 74, 75, I was trying to figure out</p>
<p>how to write a thesis so that I could become a physicist</p>
<p>the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I did a, I had a great advisor, Professor James Young</p>
<p>who had taught me a number of things about electrons</p>
<p>and weak forces and those sorts of things.</p>
<p>But I decided that if I was going to have a really</p>
<p>an opportunity to maximize my chances of being successful,</p>
<p>I should strike it out in a direction</p>
<p>that other people were not studying.</p>
<p>And so as a consequence, I surveyed ideas</p>
<p>that were going, that were being developed.</p>
<p>And I came across the idea of supersymmetry.</p>
<p>And it was so, the mathematics was so remarkable</p>
<p>that I just, it bowled me over.</p>
<p>I actually have two undergraduate degrees.</p>
<p>My first undergraduate degree is actually mathematics.</p>
<p>And my second is physics,</p>
<p>even though I always wanted to be a physicist.</p>
<p>Plan A, which involved getting good grades was mathematics.</p>
<p>I was a mathematics major thinking about graduate school,</p>
<p>but my heart was in physics.</p>
<p>If we could take a small digression,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s to you the most beautiful idea in mathematics</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve encountered in this interplay</p>
<p>between math and physics?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the idea of symmetry.</p>
<p>The fact that our innate sense of symmetry</p>
<p>winds up aligning with just incredible mathematics,</p>
<p>to me is the most beautiful thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange, but true</p>
<p>that if symmetries were perfect, we would not exist.</p>
<p>And so even though we have these very powerful ideas</p>
<p>about balance in the universe in some sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only when you break those balances</p>
<p>that you get creatures like humans</p>
<p>and objects like planets and stars.</p>
<p>So although they are a scaffold for reality,</p>
<p>they cannot be the entirety of reality.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of naturally attracted</p>
<p>to parts of science and technology</p>
<p>where symmetry plays a dominant role.</p>
<p>And not just, I guess, symmetry as you said,</p>
<p>but the magic happens when you break the symmetry.</p>
<p>The magic happens when you break the symmetry.</p>
<p>Okay, so diving right back in,</p>
<p>you mentioned four quadrants.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Two are filled with stuff we can, two buckets.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s crazy mathematical thing,</p>
<p>ideas fulfilling the other two.</p>
<p>What are those things?</p>
<p>So earlier, the way I described these two buckets</p>
<p>is I gave you a story that started out</p>
<p>by putting us in a dusty room with two flashlights.</p>
<p>And I said, turn on your flashlight, I&rsquo;ll turn on mine,</p>
<p>the beams will go through each other.</p>
<p>And the beams are composed of force carriers called photons.</p>
<p>They carry the electromagnetic force</p>
<p>and they pass right through each other.</p>
<p>So imagine looking at the mathematics of such an object,</p>
<p>which you don&rsquo;t have to imagine people like me do that.</p>
<p>So you take that mathematics</p>
<p>and then you ask yourself a question.</p>
<p>You see, mathematics is a palette.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a musical composer</p>
<p>is able to construct variations on a theme.</p>
<p>Well, a piece of mathematics in the hand of a physicist</p>
<p>is something that we can construct variations on.</p>
<p>So even though the mathematics that Maxwell gave us</p>
<p>about light, we know how to construct variations on that.</p>
<p>And one of the variations you can construct is to say,</p>
<p>suppose you have a force carrier for electromagnetism</p>
<p>that behaves like an electron</p>
<p>in that it would bounce off of another one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changing a mathematical term in an equation.</p>
<p>So if you did that, you would have a force carrier.</p>
<p>So you would say first it belongs</p>
<p>in this force carrying bucket,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s got this property of bouncing off like electrons.</p>
<p>So you say, well, gee, wait, no,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the right bucket.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re forced to actually put it</p>
<p>in one of these empty quadrants.</p>
<p>So those sorts of things, basically we give them&hellip;</p>
<p>So the photon mathematically</p>
<p>can be accompanied by a photino.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that carries a force</p>
<p>but has the rule of bouncing off.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, you could start with an electron</p>
<p>and you say, okay, so write down the mathematical electron.</p>
<p>I know how to do that.</p>
<p>A physicist named Dirac first told us how to do that</p>
<p>back in the late 20s, early 30s.</p>
<p>So take that mathematics.</p>
<p>And then you say, let me look at that mathematics</p>
<p>and find out what in the mathematics</p>
<p>causes two electrons to bounce off of each other,</p>
<p>even if I turn off the electrical charge.</p>
<p>So I could do that.</p>
<p>And now let me change that mathematical term.</p>
<p>So now I have something that carries electrical charge,</p>
<p>but if you take two of them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, if you turn their charges off,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pass through each other.</p>
<p>So that puts things in the other quadrant.</p>
<p>And those things we tend to call,</p>
<p>we put the S in front of their name.</p>
<p>So in the lower quadrant here, we have electrons</p>
<p>and this now newly filled quadrant, we have selectors.</p>
<p>And the quadrant over here, we had quarks.</p>
<p>Over here, we have squarks.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve got this balanced pie.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically what I understood</p>
<p>as a graduate student in 1975</p>
<p>about this idea of supersymmetry,</p>
<p>that it was going to fill up these two quadrants</p>
<p>of the pie in a way that no one</p>
<p>had ever thought about before.</p>
<p>So I was amazed that no one else at MIT</p>
<p>found this an interesting idea.</p>
<p>So it led to my becoming the first person in MIT</p>
<p>to really study supersymmetry.</p>
<p>This is 1975, 76, 77.</p>
<p>And in 77, I wrote the first PhD thesis</p>
<p>in the physics department on this idea</p>
<p>because I was drawn to the balance.</p>
<p>Drawn to the symmetry.</p>
<p>So what does that, first of all,</p>
<p>is this fundamentally a mathematical idea?</p>
<p>So how much experimental, and we&rsquo;ll have this theme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting one.</p>
<p>When you explore the world of the small</p>
<p>and in your new book talking about</p>
<p>Approving Einstein, right, that we&rsquo;ll also talk about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this theme of kind of starting it,</p>
<p>exploring crazy ideas first in the mathematics</p>
<p>and then seeking for ways to experimentally validate them.</p>
<p>Where do you put supersymmetry in that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s closer than string theory.</p>
<p>It has not yet been validated.</p>
<p>In some sense, you mentioned Einstein,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s go there for a moment.</p>
<p>In our book, Approving Einstein Right,</p>
<p>we actually do talk about the fact</p>
<p>that Albert Einstein in 1915 wrote a set of equations</p>
<p>which were very different from Newton&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>in describing gravity.</p>
<p>These equations made some predictions</p>
<p>that were different from Newton&rsquo;s predictions.</p>
<p>It actually made three different predictions.</p>
<p>One of them was not actually a prediction,</p>
<p>but a postdiction, because it was known</p>
<p>that Mercury was not orbiting the sun</p>
<p>in the way that Newton would have told you.</p>
<p>And so Einstein&rsquo;s theory actually describes Mercury</p>
<p>orbiting in a way that was observed</p>
<p>as opposed to what Newton would have told you.</p>
<p>So that was one prediction.</p>
<p>The second prediction that came out of</p>
<p>the theory of general relativity,</p>
<p>which Einstein wrote in 1915,</p>
<p>was that if you,</p>
<p>so let me describe an experiment and come back to it.</p>
<p>Suppose I had a glass of water,</p>
<p>and I filled the glass up,</p>
<p>and then I moved the glass slowly back and forth</p>
<p>between our two faces.</p>
<p>It would appear to me like your face was moving,</p>
<p>even though you weren&rsquo;t moving.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s actually, and what&rsquo;s causing it</p>
<p>is because the light gets bent through the glass</p>
<p>as it passes from your face to my eye.</p>
<p>So Einstein in his 1915 theory of general relativity</p>
<p>found out that gravity has the same effect on light</p>
<p>as that glass of water.</p>
<p>It would cause beams of light to bend.</p>
<p>Now, Newton also knew this,</p>
<p>but Einstein&rsquo;s prediction was that light</p>
<p>would bend twice as much.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s a mathematical idea.</p>
<p>Now, how do you actually prove it?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve got to watch.</p>
<p>Just a quick pause on that, just the language you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>He found out.</p>
<p>I can say he did a calculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting notion</p>
<p>that one of the beautiful things about this universe</p>
<p>is you can do a calculation</p>
<p>and combine with some of that magical intuition</p>
<p>that physicists have, actually predict what would be,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s possible to experimentally validate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>So he found out in the sense</p>
<p>that there seems to be something here</p>
<p>and mathematically it should bend,</p>
<p>gravity should bend light this amount.</p>
<p>And so therefore that&rsquo;s something that could be potentially,</p>
<p>and then come up with an experiment that could be validated.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way that actually modern physics,</p>
<p>deeply fundamental modern physics, this is how it works.</p>
<p>Earlier we spoke about the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>So why did we go looking for it?</p>
<p>The answer is that back in the late 60s and early 70s,</p>
<p>some people wrote some equations</p>
<p>and the equations predicted this.</p>
<p>So then we went looking for it.</p>
<p>So on supersymmetry for a second,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these things called idynchrous symbols,</p>
<p>these strange little graphs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You refer to them as revealing something</p>
<p>like binary code underlying reality.</p>
<p>First of all, can you describe these graphs?</p>
<p>Describe these graphs, what are they?</p>
<p>What are these beautiful little strange graphs?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, idynchrous are an invention of mine,</p>
<p>together with a colleague named Michael Fox.</p>
<p>In 2005, we were looking at equations.</p>
<p>Well, the story&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll take too long to explain all the details,</p>
<p>but the Reader&rsquo;s Digest version</p>
<p>is that we were looking at these equations</p>
<p>and we figured out that all the data</p>
<p>in a certain class of equations could be put in pictures.</p>
<p>And the pictures, what do they look like?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re just little balls.</p>
<p>You have black balls and white balls.</p>
<p>Those stand for those two buckets, by the way,</p>
<p>that we talked about in reality.</p>
<p>The white balls are things that are like particles of light.</p>
<p>The black balls are like electrons.</p>
<p>And then you can draw lines connecting these balls.</p>
<p>And these lines are deeply mathematical objects</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way for me to,</p>
<p>I have no physical model for telling you what the lines are.</p>
<p>But if you were a mathematician,</p>
<p>I would do a technical phrase saying,</p>
<p>this is the orbit of the representation</p>
<p>and the action of the symmetry generators.</p>
<p>Mathematicians wouldn&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>Nobody else in their right mind would,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s not go there.</p>
<p>So, but we figured out that the data</p>
<p>that was in the equations was in these funny pictures</p>
<p>that we could draw.</p>
<p>And so that was stunning,</p>
<p>but it also was encouraging</p>
<p>because there are problems with the equations,</p>
<p>which I had first learned about in 1979</p>
<p>when I was down at Harvard</p>
<p>and I went out to Caltech for the first time</p>
<p>and working with a great scientist</p>
<p>by the name of John Schwartz.</p>
<p>There are problems in the equations we don&rsquo;t know how to solve.</p>
<p>And so one of the things about solving problems</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know how to solve</p>
<p>is that beating your head against a brick wall</p>
<p>is probably not a good philosophy about how to solve it.</p>
<p>So what do you need to do?</p>
<p>You need to change your sense of reference,</p>
<p>your frame of reference, your perspective.</p>
<p>So when I saw these funny pictures,</p>
<p>I thought, gee, that might be a way</p>
<p>to solve these problems with equations</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know how to do.</p>
<p>So that was for me one of the first attractions</p>
<p>is that I now had an alternative language</p>
<p>to try to attack a set of mathematical problems.</p>
<p>But I quickly realized that A,</p>
<p>this mathematical language was not known by mathematicians,</p>
<p>which makes it pretty interesting</p>
<p>because now you have to actually teach mathematicians</p>
<p>about a piece of mathematics</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how they make their living.</p>
<p>And the great thing about working with mathematicians,</p>
<p>of course, is the rigor with which they examine ideas.</p>
<p>So they make your ideas better than they start out.</p>
<p>So I start working with a group of mathematicians</p>
<p>and it was in that collaboration that we figured out</p>
<p>that these funny pictures had error correcting codes</p>
<p>buried in them.</p>
<p>Can you talk about what are error correcting codes?</p>
<p>Ah, sure.</p>
<p>So the simplest way to talk about error correcting codes</p>
<p>is first of all, to talk about digital information.</p>
<p>Digital information is basically strings of ones and zeros.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called bits.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s imagine that I want to send you some bits.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I could show you pictures,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s a rainy day</p>
<p>or maybe the windows in your house are foggy.</p>
<p>So sometimes when I show you a zero,</p>
<p>you might interpret it as a one.</p>
<p>Or other times when I show you a one,</p>
<p>you might interpret it as a zero.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>that means when I try to send you this data,</p>
<p>it comes to you in corrupted form.</p>
<p>And so the challenge is how do you get it to be uncorrupted?</p>
<p>In the 1940s, a computer scientist named Hamming</p>
<p>addressed the problem of how do you reliably transmit</p>
<p>digital information?</p>
<p>And what he came up with was a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>Now, the way that you solve it</p>
<p>is that you take the data that you want to send,</p>
<p>the ones in your strings of ones and zeros,</p>
<p>your favorite string,</p>
<p>and then you dump more ones and zeros in,</p>
<p>but you dump them in in a particular pattern.</p>
<p>And this particular pattern</p>
<p>is what a Hamming code is all about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an error correcting code</p>
<p>because if the person at the other end</p>
<p>knows what the pattern&rsquo;s supposed to be,</p>
<p>they can figure out when one&rsquo;s got changed to zeros,</p>
<p>zero&rsquo;s got changed to one.</p>
<p>So it turned out that our strange little objects</p>
<p>that came from looking at the equations</p>
<p>that we couldn&rsquo;t solve,</p>
<p>it turns out that when you look at them deeply enough,</p>
<p>you find out that they have ones and zeros</p>
<p>buried in them.</p>
<p>But even more astoundingly,</p>
<p>the ones and zeros are not there randomly.</p>
<p>They are in the pattern of error correcting codes.</p>
<p>So this was an astounding thing</p>
<p>that when we first got this result</p>
<p>and tried to publish it,</p>
<p>it took us three years to convince other physicists</p>
<p>that we weren&rsquo;t crazy.</p>
<p>Eventually we were able to publish it,</p>
<p>I and this collaboration of mathematicians</p>
<p>and other physicists.</p>
<p>And so ever since then,</p>
<p>I have actually been looking at the mathematics</p>
<p>of these objects,</p>
<p>trying to still understand properties of the equations.</p>
<p>And I want to understand the properties of equations</p>
<p>because I want to be able to try things like electrons.</p>
<p>So as you can see,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like a two step removed process</p>
<p>of trying to get back to reality.</p>
<p>So what would you say is the most beautiful property</p>
<p>of these Adinkra graphs, objects?</p>
<p>What do you think, by the way, the word symbols,</p>
<p>what do you think of them, these simple graphs?</p>
<p>Are they objects or?</p>
<p>How should we think about that?</p>
<p>For people who work with mathematics like me,</p>
<p>our mathematical concepts are,</p>
<p>we often refer to them as objects</p>
<p>because they feel like real things.</p>
<p>Even though you can&rsquo;t see them or touch them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so much part of your interior life</p>
<p>that it is as if you could.</p>
<p>So we often refer to these things as objects,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s nothing objective about them.</p>
<p>And what does a single graph represent in space?</p>
<p>Okay, so the simplest of these graphs</p>
<p>has to have one white ball and one black ball.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that balance that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Remember, we want to balance out the quadrants?</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t do it unless you have</p>
<p>a black ball and white ball.</p>
<p>So the simplest of these objects looks like two little balls,</p>
<p>one black, one white, connected by a single line.</p>
<p>And what it&rsquo;s talking about is, as I said,</p>
<p>a deep mathematical property related to symmetry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned the error correcting codes,</p>
<p>but is there a particular beautiful property</p>
<p>that stands out to you about these objects</p>
<p>that you just find?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, there is.</p>
<p>Early on in the development of it.</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>The craziest thing about these to me</p>
<p>is that when you look at physics</p>
<p>and try to write equations where information</p>
<p>gets transmitted reliably,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in one of these super symmetrical systems</p>
<p>with this extra symmetry,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t happen unless there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an error correcting code present.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if the universe says,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t retransmit information</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s something about an error correcting code.</p>
<p>This to me is the craziest thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever personally encountered in my research.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually got me to wondering</p>
<p>how this could come about,</p>
<p>because the only place in nature</p>
<p>that we know about error correcting codes is genetics.</p>
<p>And in genetics, we think it was evolution</p>
<p>that causes error correcting codes to be in genomes.</p>
<p>And so does that mean that there was</p>
<p>some kind of form of evolution</p>
<p>acting on the mathematical laws of the physics</p>
<p>of our universe?</p>
<p>This is a very bizarre and strange idea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve wondered about</p>
<p>from time to time since making these discoveries.</p>
<p>Do you think such an idea could be fundamental,</p>
<p>or is it emergent throughout</p>
<p>all the different kinds of systems?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s fundamental.</p>
<p>I probably will not live to find out.</p>
<p>This is gonna be the work of probably some future</p>
<p>either mathematician or physicist</p>
<p>to figure out what these things actually mean.</p>
<p>We have to talk a bit about the magical,</p>
<p>the mysterious string theory, super string theory.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still maybe this aspect of it,</p>
<p>which is there&rsquo;s still for me</p>
<p>from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>this fascinating heated debate.</p>
<p>On the status of string theory.</p>
<p>Can you clarify this debate,</p>
<p>perhaps articulating the various views</p>
<p>and say where you land on it?</p>
<p>So first of all, I doubt that I will be able</p>
<p>to say anything to clarify the debate</p>
<p>around string theory for a general audience.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is because string theory</p>
<p>has done something I&rsquo;ve never seen the erectal physics do.</p>
<p>It has broken out into consciousness</p>
<p>of the general public before we&rsquo;re finished.</p>
<p>You see, string theory doesn&rsquo;t actually exist</p>
<p>because when we use the word theory,</p>
<p>we mean a particular set of attributes.</p>
<p>In particular, it means that you have</p>
<p>an overarching paradigm that explains</p>
<p>what it is that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>No such overarching paradigm exists for string theory.</p>
<p>What string theory is currently</p>
<p>is an enormously large mutually reinforcing collection</p>
<p>of mathematical facts in which we can find no contradictions.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>but we can certainly say that without challenge.</p>
<p>Now, just because you find a piece of mathematics</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that this applies to nature.</p>
<p>And in fact, there has been a very heated debate</p>
<p>about whether string theory is some sort of hysteria</p>
<p>among the community of theoretical physicists,</p>
<p>or whether it has something fundamental</p>
<p>to say about our universe.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t yet know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>What those of us who study string theory</p>
<p>will tell you are things like,</p>
<p>string theory has been extraordinarily productive</p>
<p>in getting us to think more deeply,</p>
<p>even about mathematics that&rsquo;s not string theory,</p>
<p>but the kind of mathematics</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve used to describe elementary particles.</p>
<p>There have been spin offs from string theory,</p>
<p>and this has been going on now for two decades almost,</p>
<p>that have allowed us, for example,</p>
<p>to more accurately calculate the force between electrons</p>
<p>with the presence of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>This is not something you hear about in the public.</p>
<p>There are other similar things.</p>
<p>That kind of property I just told you about</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s called weak strong duality,</p>
<p>and it comes directly from string theory.</p>
<p>There are other things such as</p>
<p>a property called holography,</p>
<p>which allows one to take equations</p>
<p>and look at them on the boundary of a space,</p>
<p>and then to know information about inside a space</p>
<p>without actually doing calculations there.</p>
<p>This has come directly from string theory.</p>
<p>So there are a number of direct mathematical effects</p>
<p>that we learn as string theory,</p>
<p>but we take these ideas and look at math</p>
<p>that we already know and we find suddenly</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re more powerful.</p>
<p>This is a pretty good indication</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something interesting going on</p>
<p>with string theory itself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the early days</p>
<p>of a powerful mathematical framework.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have right now.</p>
<p>What are the big, first of all,</p>
<p>most people will probably, which as you said,</p>
<p>most general public would know actually</p>
<p>what string theory is, which is at the highest level,</p>
<p>which is a fascinating fact.</p>
<p>Well, string theory is what they do</p>
<p>on the Big Bang Theory, right?</p>
<p>One, can you maybe describe what is string theory,</p>
<p>and two, what are the open challenges?</p>
<p>So what is string theory?</p>
<p>Well, the simplest explanation I can provide</p>
<p>is to go back and ask what are particles,</p>
<p>which is the question you first asked me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the smallest thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the smallest thing?</p>
<p>So particles, one way I try to describe particles</p>
<p>to people is start,</p>
<p>I want you to imagine a little ball</p>
<p>and I want you to let the size of that ball shrink</p>
<p>until it has no extent whatsoever,</p>
<p>but it still has the mass of the ball.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what Newton was working with</p>
<p>when he first invented physics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the real inventor of the massive particle,</p>
<p>which is this idea that underlies all of physics.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mathematical construct</p>
<p>that you get by taking a limit of things that you know.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a string?</p>
<p>Well, in the same analogy, I would say,</p>
<p>now I want you to start with a piece of spaghetti.</p>
<p>So we all know what that looks like.</p>
<p>And now I want you to let the thickness of the spaghetti</p>
<p>shrink until it has no thickness.</p>
<p>Mathematically, I mean, in words, this makes no sense,</p>
<p>but mathematically, this actually works</p>
<p>and you get this mathematical object out.</p>
<p>It has properties that are like spaghetti.</p>
<p>It can wiggle and jiggle,</p>
<p>but it can also move collectively</p>
<p>like a piece of spaghetti.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the mathematics of those sorts of objects</p>
<p>that constitute string theory.</p>
<p>And does the multidimensional, 11 dimensional,</p>
<p>however many dimensional, more than four dimension,</p>
<p>is that a crazy idea to you?</p>
<p>Is that the stranger aspect of string theory to you?</p>
<p>Not really, and also partly because of my own research.</p>
<p>So earlier we talked about these strange symbols</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve discovered inside the equations.</p>
<p>It turns out that to a very large extent,</p>
<p>a Dinkers don&rsquo;t really care about the number of dimensions.</p>
<p>They kind of have an internal mathematical consistency</p>
<p>that allows them to be manifested</p>
<p>in many different dimensions.</p>
<p>Since supersymmetry is a part of string theory,</p>
<p>then the same property you would expect</p>
<p>to be inherited by string theory.</p>
<p>However, another little known fact,</p>
<p>which is not in the public debate,</p>
<p>is that there are actually strings</p>
<p>that are only four dimensional.</p>
<p>This is something that was discovered</p>
<p>at the end of the 80s by a scientist,</p>
<p>by three different groups of physicists</p>
<p>working independently.</p>
<p>I and my friend Warren Siegel,</p>
<p>who were at the University of Maryland at the time,</p>
<p>were able to prove that there&rsquo;s mathematics</p>
<p>that looks totally four dimensional,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s a string.</p>
<p>There was a group in Germany</p>
<p>that used slightly different mathematics,</p>
<p>but they found the same result.</p>
<p>And then there was a group at Cornell</p>
<p>who using yet a third piece of mathematics</p>
<p>found the same result.</p>
<p>So the fact that extra dimensions</p>
<p>is so widely talked about in the public</p>
<p>is partly a function of how the public</p>
<p>has come to understand string theory</p>
<p>and how the story has been told to them.</p>
<p>But there are alternatives you don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>If we could talk about maybe experimental validation,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the coauthor of a recently published book,</p>
<p>Proving Einstein Right,</p>
<p>the human story of it too,</p>
<p>the daring expeditions that change</p>
<p>how we look at the universe.</p>
<p>Do you see echoes of the early days</p>
<p>of general relativity in the 1910s</p>
<p>to the more stretched out to string theory?</p>
<p>I do, I do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one reason why I was happy to focus</p>
<p>on the story of how Einstein became a global superstar.</p>
<p>Earlier in our discussion,</p>
<p>we went over his history where in 1915,</p>
<p>he came up with this piece of mathematics,</p>
<p>used it to do some calculations</p>
<p>and then made a prediction.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But making a prediction is not enough.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s got to go out and measure.</p>
<p>And so string theory is in that in between zone.</p>
<p>Now for Einstein, it was from 1915 to 1919.</p>
<p>1915 he makes the correct prediction.</p>
<p>By the way, he made an incorrect prediction</p>
<p>about the same thing in 1911,</p>
<p>but he corrected himself in 1915.</p>
<p>And by 1919, the first pieces</p>
<p>of experimental observational data became available</p>
<p>to say, yes, he&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>And by 1922, the argument that based on observation</p>
<p>was overwhelming that he was not wrong.</p>
<p>Can you describe what special general relativity are</p>
<p>just briefly?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And what prediction Einstein made</p>
<p>and maybe some or a memorable moment</p>
<p>from the human journey of trying to prove this thing right,</p>
<p>which is incredible.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very fortunate to have worked</p>
<p>with a talented novelist who wanted to write a book</p>
<p>that coincided with a book I wanted to write</p>
<p>about how science kind of feels if you&rsquo;re a person,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually people who do science,</p>
<p>even though that may not be obvious to everyone.</p>
<p>So for me, I wanted to write this book</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>I wanted young people to understand</p>
<p>that the seeming alien giants that live before them</p>
<p>were just as human as they are.</p>
<p>They get married, they get divorced.</p>
<p>They do terrible things.</p>
<p>They do great things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just people like you.</p>
<p>And so that part of telling the story allowed me</p>
<p>to get that out there for both young people interested</p>
<p>in the sciences as well as the public.</p>
<p>But the other part of the story is I wanted to open up</p>
<p>sort of what it was like.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a scientist.</p>
<p>And so I will not pretend to be a great writer.</p>
<p>I understand a lot about mathematics</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve even created my own mathematics</p>
<p>that is kind of a weird thing to be able to do.</p>
<p>But in order to tell the story,</p>
<p>you really have to have an incredible master</p>
<p>of the narrative.</p>
<p>And that was my coauthor, Kathy Pelletier,</p>
<p>who is a novelist.</p>
<p>So we formed this conjoined brain, I used to call us.</p>
<p>She used to call us Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle.</p>
<p>My expression for us is that we were a conjoined brain</p>
<p>to tell this story.</p>
<p>And it allowed, so what are some magical moments?</p>
<p>To me, the first magical moment in telling the story</p>
<p>was looking at Albert Einstein and his struggle</p>
<p>because although we regard him as a genius,</p>
<p>as I said, in 1911, he actually made an incorrect prediction</p>
<p>about bending starlight.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what set the astronomers off.</p>
<p>In 1914, there was an eclipse.</p>
<p>And by various accidents of war and weather</p>
<p>and all sorts of things that we talk about in the book,</p>
<p>no one was able to make the measurement.</p>
<p>If they had made the measurement,</p>
<p>it would have disagreed with his 1911 prediction</p>
<p>because nature only has one answer.</p>
<p>And so then you see how fortunate he was</p>
<p>that wars and bad weather and accidents and transporting</p>
<p>equipment stopped any measurements from being made.</p>
<p>So he corrects himself in 1915,</p>
<p>but the astronomers are already out there</p>
<p>trying to make the measurement.</p>
<p>So now he gives them a different number.</p>
<p>And it turns out that&rsquo;s the number that nature agrees with.</p>
<p>So it gives you a sense of this is a person struggling</p>
<p>with something deeply.</p>
<p>And although his deep insight led him to this,</p>
<p>it is the circumstance of time, place and accident</p>
<p>but through which we view him.</p>
<p>And the story could have turned out very differently</p>
<p>where first he makes a prediction,</p>
<p>the measurements are made in 1914,</p>
<p>they disagree with his prediction.</p>
<p>And so what would the world view him as?</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s this professor who made this prediction</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t get it right, yes?</p>
<p>So the fragility of human history</p>
<p>is illustrated by that story.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of my favorite things.</p>
<p>You also learn things like in our book,</p>
<p>how eclipses and watching eclipses was a driver</p>
<p>of the development of science in our nation</p>
<p>when it was very young.</p>
<p>In fact, even before we were a nation,</p>
<p>it turns out there were citizens of this would be country</p>
<p>that were going out trying to measure eclipses.</p>
<p>So some fortune, some misfortune affects</p>
<p>the progress of science.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Especially with ideas as, to me at least,</p>
<p>if I put myself back in those days,</p>
<p>as radical as general relativity is.</p>
<p>First, can you describe, if it&rsquo;s OK briefly,</p>
<p>what general relativity is?</p>
<p>And yeah, could you just take a moment of, yeah,</p>
<p>put yourself in those shoes in the academic researchers,</p>
<p>scientists of that time, and what is this theory?</p>
<p>What is it trying to describe about our world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to answer the thing that left Isaac Newton puzzled.</p>
<p>Isaac Newton says gravity magically</p>
<p>goes from one place to another.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t believe it, by the way.</p>
<p>He knows that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>But the mathematics is so good that you have to say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ll throw my qualms away because I&rsquo;ll use it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we used to get a man from the Earth to the moon</p>
<p>was that mathematics.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m one of those scientists, and I&rsquo;ve seen this.</p>
<p>And if I thought deeply about it,</p>
<p>maybe I know that Newton himself wasn&rsquo;t comfortable.</p>
<p>And so the first thing I would hope that I would feel</p>
<p>is, gee, there&rsquo;s this young kid out there who</p>
<p>has an idea to fill in this hole that was left with us</p>
<p>by Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>That, I hope, would be my reaction.</p>
<p>I have a suspicion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of a mathematical creature.</p>
<p>I was four years old when I first</p>
<p>decided that science was what I wanted to do with my life.</p>
<p>And so if my personality back then was like it is now,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably likely I would</p>
<p>want to have studied his mathematics.</p>
<p>What was a piece of mathematics that he was</p>
<p>using to make this prediction?</p>
<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t actually create that mathematics.</p>
<p>That mathematics was created roughly 50 years</p>
<p>before he lived.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the person who harnessed it in order</p>
<p>to make a prediction.</p>
<p>In fact, he had to be taught this mathematics by a friend.</p>
<p>So this is in our book.</p>
<p>So putting myself in that time, I would want to, like I said,</p>
<p>I think I would feel excitement.</p>
<p>I would want to know what the mathematics is.</p>
<p>And then I would want to do the calculations myself.</p>
<p>Because one thing that physics is all about</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t have to take anybody&rsquo;s word for anything.</p>
<p>You can do it yourself.</p>
<p>It does seem that mathematics is a little bit more</p>
<p>tolerant of radical ideas, or mathematicians,</p>
<p>or people who find beauty in mathematics.</p>
<p>All the white questions have no good answer.</p>
<p>But let me ask, why do you think Einstein never</p>
<p>got the Nobel Prize for general relativity?</p>
<p>He got it for the photoelectric effect.</p>
<p>That is correct.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that is misunderstood about the Nobel Prize in physics.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize in physics is never</p>
<p>given for purely proposing an idea.</p>
<p>It is always given for proposing an idea that</p>
<p>has observational support.</p>
<p>So he could not get the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for either special relativity nor general relativity,</p>
<p>because the provisions that Alfred Nobel left for the award</p>
<p>prevent that.</p>
<p>But after it&rsquo;s been validated, can he not get it then, or no?</p>
<p>Yes, but remember the validation doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>come until the 1920s.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why they invented the second Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>I mean, Marie Curie, you can get a second Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for one of the greatest theories in physics.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s be clear on this.</p>
<p>The theory of general relativity had its critics</p>
<p>even up until the 50s.</p>
<p>So if the committee had wanted to give</p>
<p>the prize for general relativity,</p>
<p>there were vociferous critics of general relativity</p>
<p>up until the 50s.</p>
<p>Einstein died in 1955.</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw from the story you tell in the book,</p>
<p>from general relativity, from the radical nature</p>
<p>of the theory, to looking at the future of string theory?</p>
<p>Well, I think that the string theorists are probably</p>
<p>going to retrace this path.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to be far longer and more torturous,</p>
<p>in my opinion.</p>
<p>String theory is such a broad and deep development</p>
<p>that, in my opinion, when it becomes acceptable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be because of a confluence of observations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be a single observation.</p>
<p>And I have to tell you that, so I gave a seminar here</p>
<p>yesterday at MIT.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s on an idea I have about how string theory can</p>
<p>leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background, which</p>
<p>is an astrophysical structure.</p>
<p>And so if those kinds of observations are borne out,</p>
<p>if perhaps other things related to the idea of supersymmetry</p>
<p>are borne out, those are going to be the first powerful</p>
<p>observationally based pieces of evidence that</p>
<p>will begin to do what the Eddington expedition did</p>
<p>in 1919.</p>
<p>But that may take several decades.</p>
<p>Do you think there will be Nobel prizes given</p>
<p>for string theory?</p>
<p>No, because I think it will exceed normal human lifetimes.</p>
<p>But there are other prizes that are given.</p>
<p>I mean, there is something called the Breakthrough Prize.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Russian immigrant, a Russian American immigrant</p>
<p>named Yuri Milner, I believe his name,</p>
<p>started this wonderful prize called the Breakthrough Prize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s three times as much money as the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>And it gets awarded every year.</p>
<p>And so something like one of those prizes</p>
<p>is likely to be garnered at some point far earlier</p>
<p>than a Nobel award.</p>
<p>Jumping around a few topics.</p>
<p>While you were at Caltech, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten to interact, I believe, with Richard Feynman,</p>
<p>I have to ask.</p>
<p>Yes, Richard Feynman, indeed.</p>
<p>Do you have any stories that stand out</p>
<p>in your memory of that time?</p>
<p>I have a fair number of stories, but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>prepared to tell them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not all politically correct.</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>Let me just say, I&rsquo;ll say the following.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman, if you&rsquo;ve ever read</p>
<p>some of the books about him, in particular,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a book called Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a series of books that starts with Surely You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Joking, Mr. Feynman.</p>
<p>And I think the second one may be something like What Do You</p>
<p>Care What They Say or something.</p>
<p>I mean, the titles are all, there are three of them.</p>
<p>When I read those books, I was amazed at how accurately</p>
<p>those books portrayed the man that I interacted with.</p>
<p>He was irreverent, he was fun, he was deeply intelligent,</p>
<p>he was deeply human.</p>
<p>And those books tell that story very effectively.</p>
<p>Even just those moments, how did they</p>
<p>affect you as a physicist?</p>
<p>Well, one of the, well, it&rsquo;s funny because one</p>
<p>of the things that, I didn&rsquo;t hear Feynman say this,</p>
<p>but one of the things that is reported that he said</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re in a bar stool as a physicist,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t explain to the guy on the bar stool</p>
<p>next to you what you&rsquo;re doing, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of that that I think is correct,</p>
<p>that when you truly understand something as complicated</p>
<p>as string theory, when it&rsquo;s in its fully formed final</p>
<p>development, it should be something</p>
<p>you could tell to the person on the bar stool next to you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that affects the way I do science,</p>
<p>quite frankly.</p>
<p>It also affects the way I talk to the public about science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my mantras that I keep deeply,</p>
<p>and try to keep deeply before me when I appear in public fora</p>
<p>speaking about physics in particular and science</p>
<p>in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also something that Einstein</p>
<p>said in a different way.</p>
<p>He said he had these two different formulations.</p>
<p>One of them is when the answer is simple, it&rsquo;s God speaking.</p>
<p>And the other thing that he said was</p>
<p>that what he did in his work was simply</p>
<p>the distillation of common sense,</p>
<p>that you distill down to something.</p>
<p>And he also said you make things as simple as possible</p>
<p>but no simpler.</p>
<p>So all of those things, and certainly this attitude for me</p>
<p>first seeing this was exemplified</p>
<p>by being around Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>So in all your work, you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>searching for the simplicity, for the simple, clear.</p>
<p>I am, ultimately.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am.</p>
<p>You served President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Council of Advisors</p>
<p>in Science and Technology.</p>
<p>For seven years, yes.</p>
<p>For seven years with Eric Schmidt</p>
<p>and several other brilliant people?</p>
<p>Met Eric for the first time in 2009</p>
<p>when the council was called together.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of you in that room.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a bunch of brilliant people.</p>
<p>It kind of looks amazing.</p>
<p>What was that experience like, being called</p>
<p>upon that kind of service?</p>
<p>So let me go back to my father, first of all.</p>
<p>I earlier mentioned that my father served 27 years</p>
<p>in the US Army, starting in World War II.</p>
<p>He went off in 1942, 43 to fight against the fascists.</p>
<p>He was part of the supply corps that</p>
<p>supplied General Patton as the tanks rolled</p>
<p>across Western Europe, pushing back the forces of Nazism</p>
<p>to meet up with our Russian comrades</p>
<p>who were pushing the Nazis starting in Stalingrad.</p>
<p>And the Second World War is actually</p>
<p>a very interesting piece of history</p>
<p>to know from both sides.</p>
<p>Here in America, we typically don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve actually studied history as an adult.</p>
<p>So I actually know sort of the whole story.</p>
<p>And on the Russian side, we don&rsquo;t know the Americans.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t taught the American side of the story.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I have many Russian friends, and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had this conversation on many occasions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But you know, like General Zhukov, for example,</p>
<p>was something that you wouldn&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>but you might not know about a Patton.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So Georgy Zhukov or Rokossovsky, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole list of names that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned in the last 15 or 20 years looking</p>
<p>at the Second World War.</p>
<p>So your father was in the midst of that,</p>
<p>probably one of the greatest wars in history.</p>
<p>In the history of our species.</p>
<p>And so the idea of service comes to me essentially</p>
<p>from that example.</p>
<p>So in 2009, when I first got a call from a Nobel laureate</p>
<p>actually in biology, Harold Varmus,</p>
<p>I was on my way to India, and I got this email message,</p>
<p>and he said he needed to talk to me.</p>
<p>And I said, OK, fine, we can talk.</p>
<p>Got back to States I didn&rsquo;t hear from him.</p>
<p>We went through several cycles of this, sending me a message,</p>
<p>I want to talk to you, and then him never contacting us.</p>
<p>Finally, I was on my way to give a physics presentation</p>
<p>at the University of Florida in Gainesville,</p>
<p>and Jess had stepped off a plane,</p>
<p>and my mobile phone went off, and it was Harold.</p>
<p>And so I said, Harold, why do you keep sending me messages</p>
<p>that you want to talk but you never call?</p>
<p>And he said, well, I&rsquo;m sorry, things have been hectic</p>
<p>and da, da, da, da, da.</p>
<p>And then he said, if you were offered the opportunity</p>
<p>to serve on the US President&rsquo;s Council of Advisors</p>
<p>on Science and Technology, what would be your answer?</p>
<p>I was amused at the formulation of the question,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s a purpose of why the question is</p>
<p>asked that way.</p>
<p>But then he made it clear to me he wasn&rsquo;t joking.</p>
<p>And literally, one of the few times in my life,</p>
<p>my knees went weak and I had to hold myself up</p>
<p>against a wall so that I didn&rsquo;t fall over.</p>
<p>I doubt if most of us who have been the beneficiaries</p>
<p>of the benefits of this country,</p>
<p>when given that kind of opportunity, could say no.</p>
<p>And I know I certainly couldn&rsquo;t say no.</p>
<p>I was frightened out of my wits because I had never,</p>
<p>although I have, my career in terms of policy recommendations</p>
<p>is actually quite long, it goes back to the 80s,</p>
<p>but I had never been called upon to serve as an advisor</p>
<p>to a president of the United States.</p>
<p>And it was very scary, but I did not feel that I could say no</p>
<p>because I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sleep with myself at night</p>
<p>saying that I chickened out or whatever.</p>
<p>And so I took the plunge and we had a pretty good run.</p>
<p>There are things that I did in those seven years</p>
<p>of which I&rsquo;m extraordinarily proud.</p>
<p>One of the ways I tell people is if you&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>that television cartoon called Schoolhouse Rock,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this one story about how a bill becomes a law.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve kind of lived that.</p>
<p>There are things that I did</p>
<p>that have now been codified in US law.</p>
<p>Not everybody gets a chance to do things like that in life.</p>
<p>What do you think is the, science and technology,</p>
<p>especially in American politics,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t had a president who&rsquo;s an engineer or a scientist.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of a president like President Obama</p>
<p>in understanding the latest ideas in science and tech?</p>
<p>What was that experience like?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I&rsquo;ve met other presidents</p>
<p>beside President Obama.</p>
<p>He is the most extraordinary president</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever encountered.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that he went to Harvard.</p>
<p>When I think about President Obama,</p>
<p>he is a deep mystery to me.</p>
<p>In the same way perhaps that the universe is a mystery.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand how that constellation</p>
<p>of personality traits could come to fit</p>
<p>within a single individual.</p>
<p>But I saw them for seven years.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m convinced that I wasn&rsquo;t seeing fake news.</p>
<p>I was seeing real data.</p>
<p>He was just an extraordinary man.</p>
<p>And one of the things that was completely clear</p>
<p>was that he was not afraid and not intimidated</p>
<p>to be in a room of really smart people.</p>
<p>I mean, really smart people.</p>
<p>That he was completely comfortable in asking</p>
<p>some of the world&rsquo;s greatest experts,</p>
<p>what do I do about this problem?</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t that he was going to just take the problem</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t that he was going to just take their answer,</p>
<p>but he would listen to the advice.</p>
<p>And that to me was extraordinary.</p>
<p>As I said, I&rsquo;ve been around other executives</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never seen one quite like him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an extraordinary learner, is what I observed.</p>
<p>And not just about science.</p>
<p>He has a way of internalizing information in real time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve never seen in a politician before.</p>
<p>Even in extraordinarily complicated situations.</p>
<p>Even scientific ideas.</p>
<p>Scientific or non scientific.</p>
<p>Complicated ideas don&rsquo;t have to be scientific ideas.</p>
<p>But I have, like I said, seen him in real time</p>
<p>process complicated ideas with a speed that was stunning.</p>
<p>In fact, he shocked the entire council.</p>
<p>I mean, we were all stunned at his capacity</p>
<p>to be presented with complicated ideas</p>
<p>and then to wrestle with them and internalize them.</p>
<p>And then come back, more interestingly enough,</p>
<p>come back with really good questions to ask.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this in an area that I understand more</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen him integrate information</p>
<p>about artificial intelligence and then come out</p>
<p>with these kind of Richard Feynman like insights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And as I said, those of us who have been in that position,</p>
<p>it is stunning to see it happen because you don&rsquo;t expect it.</p>
<p>Yeah, he takes what, for a lot of sort of graduate students,</p>
<p>takes like four years in a particular topic</p>
<p>and he just does it in a few minutes.</p>
<p>He sees it very naturally.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that you would love</p>
<p>to see experimental validation of super strength theory</p>
<p>before you shove.</p>
<p>Before I shuffle off this mortal coil.</p>
<p>Which the poetry of that reference</p>
<p>made me smile when I saw it.</p>
<p>You know, people actually misunderstand it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not what, it doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>what we generally take it to mean colloquially.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s such a beautiful expression.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the Hamlet, to be or not to be speech.</p>
<p>Which I still don&rsquo;t understand what that&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>But so many interpretations.</p>
<p>Anyway, what are the most exciting problems in physics</p>
<p>that are just within our reach of understanding</p>
<p>and maybe solve the next few decades</p>
<p>that you may be able to see?</p>
<p>So in physics, you limited it to physics.</p>
<p>Physics, mathematics, this kind of space of problems</p>
<p>that fascinate you.</p>
<p>Well, the one that looks on the immediate horizon</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re gonna get to is quantum computing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna, if we actually get there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be extraordinarily interesting.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a fundamentally problem of theory</p>
<p>or is it now in the space of engineering?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the space of engineering.</p>
<p>I was out at a Q station, as you may know,</p>
<p>Microsoft has this research facility in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>I was out there a couple of months in my capacity</p>
<p>as a vice president of American Physical Society.</p>
<p>And I had some things that were like lectures</p>
<p>and they were telling me what they were doing.</p>
<p>And it sure sounded like they knew what they were doing</p>
<p>and that they were close to major breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really exciting possibility there.</p>
<p>But back to Hamlet, do you ponder mortality,</p>
<p>your own mortality?</p>
<p>Nope, my mother died when I was 11 years old.</p>
<p>And so I immediately knew what the end of the story was</p>
<p>for all of us.</p>
<p>As a consequence, I&rsquo;ve never spent a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll come in its own good time.</p>
<p>And sort of to me, the job of every human</p>
<p>is to make the best and the most of the time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s given to us in order not for our own selfish gain,</p>
<p>but to try to make this place a better place</p>
<p>for someone else.</p>
<p>And on the why of life, why do you think we are?</p>
<p>I have no idea and I never even worried about it.</p>
<p>For me, I have an answer, a local answer.</p>
<p>The apparent why for me was</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m supposed to do physics.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny because there&rsquo;s so many other</p>
<p>quantum mechanically speaking possibilities in your life,</p>
<p>such as being an astronaut, for example.</p>
<p>So you know about that, I see.</p>
<p>Well, like Einstein and the vicissitudes</p>
<p>that prevented the 1914 measurement of starlight vending,</p>
<p>the universe is constructed in such a way</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t become an astronaut, which would have,</p>
<p>for me, I would have faced the worst choice in my life,</p>
<p>whether I would try to become an astronaut</p>
<p>or whether I would try to do theoretical physics.</p>
<p>Both of these dreams were born</p>
<p>when I was four years old simultaneously.</p>
<p>And so I can&rsquo;t imagine how difficult</p>
<p>that decision would have been.</p>
<p>The universe helped you out on that one.</p>
<p>Not only in that one, but in many ones.</p>
<p>It helped me out by allowing me to pick the right dad.</p>
<p>Is there a day in your life you could relive</p>
<p>because it made you truly happy?</p>
<p>What day would that be if you could just look back?</p>
<p>Being a theoretical physicist</p>
<p>is like having Christmas every day.</p>
<p>I have lots of joy in my life.</p>
<p>The moments of invention, the moments of ideas, revelation.</p>
<p>Yes, the only thing that exceed them are</p>
<p>some family experiences like when my kids were born</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff, but they&rsquo;re pretty high up there.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t see a better way to end it, Jim.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>It was a huge honor talking to you today.</p>
<p>This worked out better than I thought.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words of wisdom</p>
<p>from the great Albert Einstein for the rebels among us.</p>
<p>Unthinking respect for authority</p>
<p>is the greatest enemy of truth.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
