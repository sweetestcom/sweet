    <p>The following is a conversation with Silvio McCauley, a computer scientist at MIT,</p>
<p>winner of the Turing Award, and one of the leading minds in the fields of cryptography,</p>
<p>information security, game theory, and most recently, cryptocurrency and the theoretical</p>
<p>foundations of a fully decentralized, secure, and scalable blockchain at Algorand, a company</p>
<p>of cryptographers, engineers, and mathematicians that he founded in 2017.</p>

<p>be having many conversations this year on the topic of cryptocurrency. I&rsquo;m reading and thinking</p>
<p>and thinking a lot on this topic. I just recently finished reading The Bitcoin Standard, a book I</p>
<p>highly recommend. As always, with this podcast, I&rsquo;m approaching it with an open mind, with</p>
<p>compassion, with as little ego as possible, and yes, with love. I hope you go along with me on</p>
<p>this journey and don&rsquo;t judge me too harshly on any likely missteps. As usual, I will play devil&rsquo;s</p>
<p>advocate. I will, on purpose, sometimes ask simple, even dumb questions, all to try and explore the</p>
<p>space of ideas here with as much grace as I can muster. I have no financial interests here. I</p>
<p>only have a simple curiosity and a love for knowledge, especially about a set of technologies</p>
<p>that may very well transform the fabric of human civilization. If you enjoy this thing,</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the big and the basic question. What is a blockchain? And why is it interesting?</p>
<p>Why is it fascinating? Why is it powerful? All right. So a blockchain, think of it, is really</p>
<p>a common database distributed. Think about it as a ledger in which everybody can write an entry</p>
<p>in a page. You can write, I can write, and everybody can read, and you have a guarantee</p>
<p>that everybody has the same copy of the ledger that is in front of you. So whatever you see on</p>
<p>page seven, anyone else sees on page seven. So what is extraordinary about this is this common</p>
<p>knowledge thing that I think is really a first for humanity. I mean, if you look at communication,</p>
<p>like right now, you can communicate very quickly images, photos, but do you have a certainty that</p>
<p>whatever you have received has been received by everybody else? Not really. And so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>commonality of knowledge and the certainty that everybody can write, nobody has been prevented</p>
<p>from writing whatever they want. Nobody can erase. Nobody can tear a page of a ledger.</p>
<p>Nobody can swap page. Nobody can change anything. And that is immutable common record is</p>
<p>extremely powerful. And there&rsquo;s something fundamental that is decentralized about it.</p>
<p>So at least in spirit, some degree against maybe a resistance to centralization.</p>
<p>Absolutely. If it is not decentralized, how can it be common knowledge? If only one person or a</p>
<p>few people have a ledger, you don&rsquo;t have a ledger, you have to ask, you know, what is on page seven?</p>
<p>And how do you know that whatever they tell you is on page seven, they tell the same thing to</p>
<p>everybody else. And so this commonality is extremely powerful. Just to give you an example,</p>
<p>assume that you do an auction, okay? You have worked very hard, you build a building,</p>
<p>and now you want to auction it off. Makes sense because you want to auction worldwide,</p>
<p>better yet, you want to tokenize the building and sell it in all in parcels.</p>
<p>Now, everybody sees the bids. And you know that everybody sees the bids. You and I see the same</p>
<p>bids, and so does everybody else. So you know that a fair price has reached, and you know who owns</p>
<p>what and who has spent how much. And if you do it instead of, otherwise, in a centralized system,</p>
<p>I put a bid saying, oh, congratulations, Alex, you won, and your price is $12,570. How do you know?</p>
<p>So if instead of this common knowledge is a very powerful tool for humanity.</p>
<p>So we return to it from a bunch of different perspectives, including like a technical</p>
<p>perspective. But you often talk about blockchain and some of these concepts of decentralization,</p>
<p>scalability, security, all those kinds of things. But one of the most maybe impactful, exciting</p>
<p>things that leverage the blockchain, this kind of ledger idea of common knowledge is cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So in the financial space. So is there, can you say in the same kind of basic way,</p>
<p>what is cryptocurrency in the context of this common knowledge and in the context of the blockchain?</p>
<p>Great. Cryptocurrency is a currency that is on such a ledger. So imagine that on the ledger,</p>
<p>initially, you know that somehow, say you and I are the only owner, each one, let&rsquo;s give it</p>
<p>ourselves a billion each of whatever this unit. Then I start writing on the ledger,</p>
<p>I give 100 of these units to my sister, I give this much to my aunt. And then now,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s written on the ledger and everybody can see, my sister can give 57 of these units</p>
<p>that she received from me to somebody else. And that is money. And that is money because</p>
<p>you can see that somebody who tenders your payment has really the money there. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any more of a doubt when you want to sell an item. If I write you a check, is the check covered?</p>
<p>Or do I have the money at the moment of a transaction? You really see because the ledger</p>
<p>is always updated. What you see is what I see, what the merchant sees. You know that the money,</p>
<p>the money is the most powerful money system there is because it is totally transparent. And so you</p>
<p>know that you have been paid, and you know that the money is there, you have not to second guess</p>
<p>anything else. So the common knowledge applied there is you&rsquo;re basically mimicking the same kind</p>
<p>of thing you would get in the physical space, which is if you give 100 bucks or 100 of that</p>
<p>thing, whatever of that cryptocurrency to your sister, the actual transfer is as real as you</p>
<p>giving like a basket of apples to your sister. So in the case in the physical space, the common</p>
<p>knowledge is in the physics of the atoms. And then it&rsquo;s digital space, the common knowledge</p>
<p>is in this ledger. And so that transfer holds the same kind of power, but now it&rsquo;s operating</p>
<p>in the digital space. Again, I apologize for a set of ridiculous questions, but you mentioned</p>
<p>cryptocurrencies and money. What is money? Why do we have money? Do you think about this</p>
<p>kind of from this high philosophical level at times of this tool, this idea that we humans</p>
<p>have all kind of came up with and seem to be using effectively to do stuff?</p>
<p>Money is a social construct, okay, in my opinion. And this has been somehow people always felt</p>
<p>that somehow money is a way to allow us to transact, even though we want different things. So</p>
<p>I have two sheep, and then you have one cow, and I want the cow, but you are looking for</p>
<p>blankets instead, you know, so to have money is really simplifies this. But at the end of</p>
<p>it, that&rsquo;s why a bit was invented. And you started with gold, you started with</p>
<p>the coinage, then you started with the check. But at the end of the day, money is essentially</p>
<p>a social construct because you know that what you receive, you can actually spend with somebody</p>
<p>else. And so there is a kind of a social pact and social belief that you have. At the end of the day,</p>
<p>even barter requires these beliefs that other people are going to accept</p>
<p>the quote unquote currency you offer them. Because if I&rsquo;m a mason, and you ask me to build a wall</p>
<p>in your field, and I did, and you, in exchange, you give me a thousand sheep,</p>
<p>what am I going to do? Eat them all? No, I have to feed them. And if I don&rsquo;t feed them, they die,</p>
<p>and my value is zero. So in receiving this livestock, I must believe that somebody else</p>
<p>will accept them in return for something else. So money is a social belief, social shared belief</p>
<p>system that makes people transact. That&rsquo;s fascinating. I didn&rsquo;t even think about that,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re actually, you have a deep like network of beliefs about how society operates.</p>
<p>So the value is assigned even to sheep, based on that everyone will continue operating how they</p>
<p>were previously operating. Somebody will feed the sheep. I didn&rsquo;t even think about that. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating. So that directly transfers to the space of money and then to the space of digital</p>
<p>money, cryptocurrency. Okay. Does it bother you sort of intellectually when this money that is</p>
<p>a social construct is not directly tied to physical goods like gold, for example?</p>
<p>Not at all, because after all, gold has some industrial value. Nobody delights it. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>metal. It doesn&rsquo;t oxidate. It has some good things about it. But does this industrial value</p>
<p>really represent the value to which it now is traded? No. So gold is another way to express</p>
<p>our belief. I give you an ounce of gold, you treat it like, oh, somebody else will want this</p>
<p>for doing something else. So it is really this notion of this. Money is a mental construct,</p>
<p>is really, and is shared, is a social construct, I really believe. And so some people feel that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s physical, so therefore gold exists. Then, as you know now, countries, most sophisticated</p>
<p>country right now, they print their own money and you believe that they are not going to</p>
<p>exaggerate it with inflation. Not everybody believes it, but at least they are not going</p>
<p>to exaggerate it blatantly. And therefore you receive it because you know that somebody else</p>
<p>will accept it, will have faith in the currency and so on and so forth. But whether it&rsquo;s gold,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s livestock, whatever it is, money is really a shared belief.</p>
<p>So there is something, you know, and I&rsquo;ve been reading more and more about different cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>There is a kind of belief that the scarcity of a particular resource like Bitcoin has a</p>
<p>limited amount and it&rsquo;s tied to physical, you know, to proof of work. So it&rsquo;s tied to physical</p>
<p>reality in terms of how much you can mine effectively and so on. That that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>important feature of money. Do you think that&rsquo;s an important feature to be a part of whatever</p>
<p>the money is? That is certainly a very useful part. So at some point in time, you know,</p>
<p>assume that money is something that all of a sudden we say, daisies are money, are the currency.</p>
<p>Then, you know, I offer you 10 daisies in payment of whatever goods and services you want to</p>
<p>provide. But at the end of the day, if you know that you can cultivate it and generate them at</p>
<p>will, then perhaps, you know, you should not accept my payment. Here is a bouquet of daisies.</p>
<p>So you need some kind of a scarcity. The inability to create it suddenly out of nothing</p>
<p>is unimportant. And it&rsquo;s not an intrinsic necessity, but it&rsquo;s much easier to accept</p>
<p>once you know that there is a fixed number of units of whatever currency there is and therefore</p>
<p>you can mentally understand I&rsquo;m getting, you know, this much of this piece of a pie and therefore</p>
<p>I consider myself paid. I understand what I&rsquo;m receiving. You described the goals of a blockchain.</p>
<p>You have a nice presentation on this as scalability, security, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And you challenged the blockchain trilemma that claims you can only have two of the three.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about each. What is scalability in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>What does scalability mean? So remember, we said that the blockchain is a ledger and each page</p>
<p>receives a, gets some transaction and everybody can write in these pages of the ledger. Nobody</p>
<p>can be stopped from writing and everybody can read them. Okay. Scalability means how fast can</p>
<p>you write? Just imagine that you can write an entry in this special shared ledger once every</p>
<p>hour. Well, you know, what are you going to do if you have no one transaction of an hour,</p>
<p>the world doesn&rsquo;t go around. So you need to have scalability means here that you can</p>
<p>then somehow write a lot of transaction and then you can read them and everybody can validate them.</p>
<p>And that is the speed and the number of transactions per second and the fact that</p>
<p>they are shared. So you want to have this speed not only in writing, but in sharing and</p>
<p>in inspection for validity. This is scalability. The world is big. The world wants to interact,</p>
<p>the people want to interact with each other and you better be prepared to have a ledger</p>
<p>in which you can write lots and lots and lots of transactions in this special way very,</p>
<p>very, very quickly. So maybe from a more mathematical perspective or can we say</p>
<p>something about how much scalability is needed for a world that is big?</p>
<p>Well, it really depends how many transactions you want, but remember that I think right now</p>
<p>yet to go into at least 1000s of transactions per second, even if you look at credit cards,</p>
<p>we are going to go from an average of 1600 to peaks of 20,000 or 40,000, something like this.</p>
<p>But remember, it&rsquo;s not only a question of a transaction per se, but the value is that the</p>
<p>transaction is actually being shared and visible to everybody and the certainty that that is the</p>
<p>case. I can print on my own printer way more transactions, but nobody has the time to see</p>
<p>or to inspect. That doesn&rsquo;t count. So you want scalability at this common knowledge level.</p>
<p>That is the challenge. I also meant from a perspective of like a complexity analysis.</p>
<p>So when you get more and more people involved, doesn&rsquo;t need to scale in some kind of way that</p>
<p>do you like to see certain kind of properties in order to say something is scalable?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely. I took a little bit implicitly that the people transacting are actually very</p>
<p>different. So if there is a two people who can do thousands of transactions per second with each</p>
<p>other, this is not so interesting. What do we really need is to say there are billions of</p>
<p>people at any point in time, you know, thousands and thousands of them want to transact with each</p>
<p>other and you want to support to that. So Algorand, it solves, so that&rsquo;s the company,</p>
<p>the team of cryptographers and mathematicians, engineers, so on, that challenged the blockchain</p>
<p>trilemma. So let&rsquo;s break it down in terms of achieving scalability. How do we achieve scalability</p>
<p>in the space of blockchain, in the space of cryptocurrency? Okay. So scalability, security,</p>
<p>remember, and decentralization, right? So that&rsquo;s what they want. What&rsquo;s the best way to approach?</p>
<p>Can we break it down? Let&rsquo;s start with scalability and think about how do we achieve it? Well,</p>
<p>to achieve it one at a time is perhaps easy, even security. If nobody transacts,</p>
<p>nobody loses money. So that is secure, but it&rsquo;s not scalable. So let me tell you, I&rsquo;m a cryptographer,</p>
<p>so I try to fight the bad guys. And what you want is that the vesselager that we discussed before</p>
<p>cannot be tampered with. So you must think of it as a special link that nobody can erase. Then</p>
<p>it has to be, everybody should be able to read and not to alter the pages or the content of the pages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay. But you know what? That is actually easy cryptographically. Easy cryptographically</p>
<p>means you can use tools invented 50 years ago, which in cryptographic time is prehistory, okay?</p>
<p>We cavemen working around and solve the problem in cryptography land. But there is really a</p>
<p>fundamental problem, which is really almost a social, seems a political problem, is to say,</p>
<p>who the hell chooses or publishes the next page of the ledger? I mean, that is really the challenge.</p>
<p>This ledger, you can always add a page because more and more transaction had to be written on</p>
<p>there. And somebody has to assemble this transaction, put them on a page and add the</p>
<p>next page. Who is the somebody who chooses the page and adds it on? Who can be trusted to do it?</p>
<p>Exactly. Assume it is me for what I&rsquo;m being, not that I want to volunteer for the job, but</p>
<p>then I would have more power than any absolute monarch in history, because I would have a</p>
<p>tremendous power to say, these are the transactions that the entire world should see. And whatever I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t write, this transaction will never see the light of day. I mean, no one had any such a power</p>
<p>in history. So it&rsquo;s very important to do that. And that is the quintessential problem in a blockchain.</p>
<p>And people have thought about it to say, it&rsquo;s not me, it&rsquo;s not you. But for instance,</p>
<p>in proof of work, what people say is, okay, it&rsquo;s not me, it&rsquo;s not you, you know what it is?</p>
<p>We make a very difficult, we invented a cryptographic puzzle, very hard to solve.</p>
<p>The first one to solve it has the right to add one page to the ledger on behalf of everybody else.</p>
<p>That now seems okay, because sometimes I solve a puzzle before you do, sometimes you solve</p>
<p>before I do, or before somebody else solves it, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And presumably, the effort you put in is somehow correlated with how much trust</p>
<p>you should be given to add to the ledger.</p>
<p>Yeah, so somehow you want to make sure that you need to work because you want to prevent,</p>
<p>you want to make sure that you get one solution every 10 minutes, say, like in a particular</p>
<p>example of Bitcoin, so that it is very rare that two pages are added at the same time.</p>
<p>Because if I solve a puzzle at the same time you do, it could happen that if it happens once or</p>
<p>twice, we can survive it. But if it happens every other page is a double page, then which of the two</p>
<p>is the real page, it becomes a problem. So that&rsquo;s why in Bitcoin, it is important to have a substantial</p>
<p>amount of work so that no matter how many people try on Earth to solve a puzzle, you have one</p>
<p>solution out of how many people are trying every 10 minutes. So that you have, you distance these</p>
<p>pages, and you have the time to propagate through the network a solution and the page attached to</p>
<p>it. And therefore, there is one page at a time that is added. And you say, well, why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>do it? We have a solution. Well, first of all, a page every 10 minutes is not fast enough. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>question of scalability. And second of all, to ensure that no matter how many people try, you</p>
<p>get one page every 10 minutes, one solution to the riddle every 10 minutes. This means that the riddle</p>
<p>becomes very, very hard. And to have a chance to solve it within 10 minutes, you must have such an</p>
<p>expensive apparatus in terms of specialized computers, not one, not two, but thousands and</p>
<p>thousands of them. And they produce tons of heat, okay? They dissipate heat like maniac. And then</p>
<p>you have to refrigerate them too. And so then now you have air conditioning galore to add to the</p>
<p>thing. It becomes so expensive that fewer and fewer and fewer people can actually compete in</p>
<p>order to add to the page. And the problem becomes so crucial that in Bitcoin, depending on which</p>
<p>day of the week you look at it, you are going to have two or three mining pools that are really</p>
<p>the ones that are capable of controlling the chain. So you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>at least a centralization. Right. It started being decentralized, but the expenses became</p>
<p>higher and higher and higher. When the cost becomes higher and higher, fewer and fewer</p>
<p>people can afford them. And then it becomes de facto centralized, right? Yeah. And a different</p>
<p>type of approach is instead, for instance, a delegated proof of stake, which is also</p>
<p>very easy to explain, essentially boils down to say, well, look at these 21 people, say, okay?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they look honest? Yes, they do. In fact, I believe that they&rsquo;re going to remain honest</p>
<p>for the foreseeable future. So why don&rsquo;t we do ourselves a favor? Let&rsquo;s entrust them</p>
<p>to add the page on behalf of all of us to the ledger. Okay. Okay. But now we are going to say,</p>
<p>is this centralized or decentralized? Well, 21 is better than one, but to say is very little.</p>
<p>So if you look at when people rebelled to centralize power, I don&rsquo;t know, the French</p>
<p>revolutions, okay? There was a monarch and the nobles. Were there 21 nobles? No, there were</p>
<p>thousands of them, but there were millions and millions of disempowered citizens. So one is</p>
<p>centralized, 21 is also centralized, right? So that&rsquo;s delegated proof of stake. Delegated. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like representative democracy, I guess. Yes, which is good. It&rsquo;s working great, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working great. Well, it&rsquo;s better than the single monarch, right? There&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>There are problems. And so we were looking for a different, when thinking about Algorand,</p>
<p>for a different approach. And so we have an approach that is really, really decentralized</p>
<p>because essentially it works as follows. You have a bunch of tokens, right? These are the tokens</p>
<p>that have equal power. And you have say 10 billions of tokens distributed to the entire</p>
<p>world. And the owners, each token has a chance to add the ledger, equal probability to everybody</p>
<p>else. In fact, actually, if you want, here is how it works. So think about by some magic</p>
<p>cryptographic process, which is not magic, it&rsquo;s mathematics, but think of it as magic. Assume that</p>
<p>you select a thousand tokens and so sometimes a random, okay? And you have a guarantee that the</p>
<p>random selected. And then the owners of these 1000 tokens somehow agree on the next page,</p>
<p>they all sign it, and that is the next page. Okay? So it is clear that nobody has the power</p>
<p>but in a while, one of your tokens is selected and you are in charge of this committee to select</p>
<p>the next page. But this goes around very quickly. So, and if you look at this, the equation really</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not really centralized. And because for agreeing on the same page, it is important</p>
<p>that the 1000 tokens that you randomly selected are in honest ends, the majority of them.</p>
<p>So which, if the majority of the tokens are in honest ends, that is essentially true because</p>
<p>if the majority of the tokens are in honest ends, if you select, say 90% of the people are,</p>
<p>90% of the tokens are in honest ends. So can you randomly select a thousand,</p>
<p>in this thousand you find the 501 tokens in bad ends. Very, very improbable.</p>
<p>So basically, when a large fraction of people are honest, then you can use randomness as a powerful</p>
<p>tool to get decentralization. So what does honesty mean? And now we&rsquo;re into the social</p>
<p>side of things, which is how do we know that like the fraction, a large fraction of people</p>
<p>or participating parties are honest? That is an excellent question. So by the way,</p>
<p>first of all, we should realize that the same thing is for every other system. When you look</p>
<p>at proof of work, you rely that the majority of the mining power is in honest ends. When you look</p>
<p>at delegated proof of stake, you rely that the majority of these 21 people are honest. What is</p>
<p>the difference? The difference is that in these other systems, you should say the whole economy</p>
<p>is secure if the majority of this small piece of economy are honest. And that is a big question.</p>
<p>But instead, in Algorand, in our approach, we say the whole economy is secure if the majority</p>
<p>of the economy is honest. In other words, who can subvert Algorand is not a majority of a small</p>
<p>group, but is a majority of the token holders had to conspire with each other in order to sink the</p>
<p>very economy for which they own the majority of. That I think it is a bit harder to&hellip;</p>
<p>Like a self destructive majority, essentially. And you&rsquo;re also making me realize that basically</p>
<p>every system that we have in the world today assumes that the majority of participants is</p>
<p>honest. Yes. The only difference is the majority of whom. And in some cases, the majority of a club</p>
<p>and in our case is the majority of the whole system.</p>
<p>The whole system. Okay. So that&rsquo;s&hellip; So through that kind of random sampling,</p>
<p>you can achieve decentralization. You can achieve&hellip; So the scalability, I understand.</p>
<p>And then the security that you&rsquo;re referring to, basically the security comes from the fact that</p>
<p>the sample selected would likely include honest people. So it&rsquo;s very difficult to&hellip; So by the way,</p>
<p>the security, as you mentioned, you&rsquo;re referring to is basically security against dishonesty,</p>
<p>right? Or manipulation or whatever. Yes. Yes. So essentially when what you&rsquo;re going to do is to</p>
<p>the following and say, well, Silvio, I understood what you&rsquo;re saying, but somebody has to randomly</p>
<p>randomly selected these tokens, then I believe you. So then who does this random selection?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point. And in Algorand, we do something a little bit unorthodox.</p>
<p>Essentially is the token choose themselves at random. And you say, if you think about it,</p>
<p>that seems to be a terrible idea. Because if you want to say, choose yourself at random,</p>
<p>and whoever chooses himself is a thousand people committee, you choose the page for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Mm hmm. And because if I&rsquo;m a bad person, I&rsquo;m going to select myself over and over again,</p>
<p>because I want to be part of the committee every single time. But not so fast. So what do we do</p>
<p>in Algorand? What does it mean that I select myself? That each one of us,</p>
<p>in the privacy of our own computer, actually a laptop, what you do is that you execute your own</p>
<p>individual lottery. And think about that you pull a lever of a slot machine, you can only pull the</p>
<p>lever once, not until you win, not enough times until you win. And when you pull the lever, case</p>
<p>one, either you win, in such a case, you have a winning ticket. Or you lose, you don&rsquo;t get any</p>
<p>winning ticket. So if you don&rsquo;t have a winning ticket, you can say anything you want about the</p>
<p>next page in the ledger, nobody pays attention. But if you ever win a ticket, people say, Oh,</p>
<p>wow, this is one of the 1000 winning tickets, we better pay attention to what he or she says.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it works. And the lottery is a cryptographic lottery, which means that even if I</p>
<p>am an entire nation, extremely powerful, with incredible computing powers, I don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>ability to improve even minimally my probability of one of my token winning the lottery. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it happens. So everybody pulls the lever, the 1000 random winners say, Oh, here is</p>
<p>my winning ticket. And here is my opinion up or down about the block. These are the ones that</p>
<p>count. And if you think about it, while this is distributed, because there is, in the case of</p>
<p>Algon, there is 10 billion tokens and you selected 1000 of them more distributed than this, you</p>
<p>cannot get. And then why is this scalable? Because what do you have to do? Okay, you have to do the</p>
<p>lottery. How long the lottery takes? It takes actually one microsecond. Whether you have one</p>
<p>token or two tokens or a billion tokens is always one microsecond of computation, which is very</p>
<p>fast. We don&rsquo;t hit the planet with a microsecond of computation. And finally, why is this secure?</p>
<p>Because even if I were a very evil and very, very powerful individual, I&rsquo;m so powerful that I can</p>
<p>corrupt anybody I want instantaneously in the world, whom would I want to corrupt? The people</p>
<p>in the committee so that I can choose the page of the ledger. But I do have a problem. I do not</p>
<p>know whom I should corrupt. Should I corrupt this lady in Shanghai, this other guy in Paris?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know. The winners are random, so I don&rsquo;t know whom I should corrupt.</p>
<p>But once the winner comes forward and says, here is my winning ticket, and you propagate</p>
<p>your winning ticket across the network, together with your opinion about the block,</p>
<p>now I know who they are. For sure, I can corrupt all 1000 of them given to my incredible powers.</p>
<p>But so what? Whatever they said, they already said, and their winning tickets and their opinions</p>
<p>are virally propagated across the network. And I do not have the power, no more than the US</p>
<p>government or any government has the power, to put back in the bottle a message virally</p>
<p>propagated by WikiLeaks. So everything you just described is kind of is fascinating,</p>
<p>a set of ideas. And, you know, online I&rsquo;ve been reading quite a bit, and people are really excited</p>
<p>about the set of ideas. Nevertheless, it is not the dominating technology today. So Bitcoin,</p>
<p>in terms of cryptocurrency, is the most popular cryptocurrency, and then Ethereum, and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s useful to kind of comment. We already talked about proof of work a little bit.</p>
<p>But what, in your sense, does Bitcoin get right? And where is it lacking?</p>
<p>Okay, so the first thing that Bitcoin got right is to understand that there was the need</p>
<p>of a cryptocurrency. And that, in my opinion, they deserve all the success because they said</p>
<p>the time is right for this idea. Because very often, it&rsquo;s not enough to be right here to be</p>
<p>right at the right time. And somebody got it right there. So hat off to Bitcoin for that.</p>
<p>And so what they got right is that it is hard to subvert and change the ledger, to cancel a</p>
<p>transaction. It&rsquo;s not impossible. That is very hard. What they did not get right is somehow that</p>
<p>it is a great store of value, currency wise. But money is not only a question that you store it</p>
<p>and you put under the mattress. Money wants to be transacted. And the transaction bitcoins are very</p>
<p>little. So if you want to store value, everybody needs a store of value. Might as well use Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the plan. But if you don&rsquo;t look at that for a moment, at least it&rsquo;s a great store</p>
<p>of value. And everybody needs a store of value. But most of the time, we want to transact. We</p>
<p>want to interact. We don&rsquo;t put the money under the mattress. So we wanted to embed. They didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>it right. That is too slow to transact. Too few transactions. There&rsquo;s a scalability issue.</p>
<p>Is it possible to build stuff on top of Bitcoin that sort of fixes the scalability? I mean,</p>
<p>this is the thing you look at. There&rsquo;s a bunch of technologies that kind of hit the right</p>
<p>need at the right time and they have flaws, but we kind of build infrastructures on top of them</p>
<p>over time to fix it as opposed to getting it right from the beginning. Or is it difficult to do?</p>
<p>Well, that is difficult to do. So you&rsquo;re talking to somebody that when I decided to throw my heart</p>
<p>in the arena and I decided, first of all, as I said before, I much admire my predecessors. I</p>
<p>mean, they got it right, a lot of things. And I really admire for that. But I had a choice to</p>
<p>make. Either I patch something that has holes all over the place or I start from scratch. I decided</p>
<p>to start from scratch because sometimes it&rsquo;s a better way. So what about Ethereum, which looks</p>
<p>like proof of stake and a lot of different innovative ideas that kind of improve or seek</p>
<p>to improve on some of the flaws of Bitcoin. Ethereum made another great idea. So they</p>
<p>figured out that money and payments are important as they are. They are only the first level, the</p>
<p>first stepping stone. The next level are smart contracts. And they were at the vision to say</p>
<p>the people will need smart contract, which allow me and you to somehow to transact securely without</p>
<p>being shopped around by a trusted third party, by a mediator. By the way, because mediators are hard</p>
<p>to find. And in fact, maybe even impossible to find if you live in Thailand and I live in New</p>
<p>Zealand, maybe we don&rsquo;t have a common person that we know and trust. And even if we find them,</p>
<p>guess what? They want to be paid. So much so that 6% of the world GDP goes into financial friction,</p>
<p>which is essentially third party. So the head of right of the world needed that.</p>
<p>But again, the scalability is not there. And the system of smart contracts in Ethereum is slow</p>
<p>and expensive. And I believe that is not enough to satisfy the appetite and the need that we have</p>
<p>for smart contracts. Well, what do you make of just as a small sort of aside in human history,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s a big one is NFT, the non fungible tokens. Do you find those interesting technically,</p>
<p>or is it more interesting on the social side of things? Well, both. I think NFTs are actually</p>
<p>great. So you are an artist to create a song or it could be a piece of art. He has many unique</p>
<p>representations of a unique piece where there is an artifact of something dreamed up by you and</p>
<p>has unique representations that now you can trade. And the important part is that now you have this</p>
<p>is not only the NFTs themselves, but the ability to trade them quickly, fast, securely, knowing</p>
<p>who owns which rights. And that gives a totally new opportunity for content creators to be</p>
<p>remunerated for what they do. But ultimately, you still have to have that scalability, security</p>
<p>and decentralization to make it, you know, to make it work for bigger and bigger applications.</p>
<p>Correct. Yeah. Yeah. I still wonder what kind of applications are yet to be</p>
<p>like enabled by it because so much. The interesting thing about NFTs, you know,</p>
<p>if you look outside of art is just like money, you can start playing with different social</p>
<p>constructs, is you can start playing with the ideas. You can start playing with even like</p>
<p>investing. Somebody was talking about almost creating an economy out of like creative people</p>
<p>or influencers. Like if you start a YouTube channel or something like that, you can invest</p>
<p>in that person and you can start trading their creations. And then almost like create a market</p>
<p>out of people&rsquo;s ideas, out of people&rsquo;s creations, out of the people themselves that generate those</p>
<p>creations. And there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting possibilities of what you can do with that.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems ridiculous, but you&rsquo;re basically creating a hierarchy of value, maybe artificial</p>
<p>in the digital world and are trading that. But in so doing are inspiring people to create.</p>
<p>So maybe as a sort of our economy gets better and better and better where actual work in the</p>
<p>physical space becomes less and less in terms of its importance, maybe we&rsquo;ll completely be operating</p>
<p>in the digital space where these kinds of economies have more and more power. And then</p>
<p>you have to have this kind of blockchains to the scalability, security, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And then decentralization is of course the tricky one because people in power start to get nervous.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Once in power, you&rsquo;re always nervous that you&rsquo;ll be supplanted by somebody else.</p>
<p>But this is your job. Congratulations, you got the job, the top job, and now everybody wants it.</p>
<p>Well, what is your sense about our time and the future hope about the decentralization</p>
<p>of power? Do you think that&rsquo;s something that we can actually achieve given that power corrupts</p>
<p>and absolute power corrupts absolutely, and it&rsquo;s so wonderful to be absolutely powerful?</p>
<p>Well, good question. So first of all, I believe that by the way, there is a</p>
<p>complex question, Lex, and like all the rest of your questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so very sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay. I am enjoying it. So there are two things. First of all,</p>
<p>power has been centralized for a variety of reasons. When you want to get it, it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>for somebody, even a single person, to grab power. But there is also some kind of a technology,</p>
<p>lack thereof, that justified having power. Because in a society in which even communication,</p>
<p>never mind blockchain, which is common knowledge, but even simple unilateral communication is hard,</p>
<p>it is much easier to say, you do as I say. So there is a little bit of a technology barrier.</p>
<p>But I think that now to get to this common knowledge, it is a totally different story.</p>
<p>Now we have finally the technology for doing this. So that is one part. But I really believe</p>
<p>that by having a distributed system, you have actually a much more stable and durable system.</p>
<p>Because not only for corruption, but even for things that go astray, and given a long enough</p>
<p>time by a strange version of Murphy&rsquo;s law, whatever goes wrong, goes wrong. And if the</p>
<p>power is diffused, you actually are much more stable. If you look at any complex living being,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s distributed. I mean, I don&rsquo;t have somebody who says, okay, tell Silvio now it&rsquo;s time to eat.</p>
<p>You have millions of cells in your body. You have billions of bacteria.</p>
<p>Exactly. Help me in the guts. We are in a soup that somehow keeps us alive.</p>
<p>So strange enough, however, when we design systems, we design them centralized. We ourselves</p>
<p>are distributed beings. And when we plan to say, okay, I want to create an architecture,</p>
<p>how about I make a pyramid, I put this on the top and the power flows down. And so again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit perhaps of a technology problem. But now the technology is there.</p>
<p>So that is a big challenge to rethink how we want to organize power in a very large system and</p>
<p>distribute a system, in my opinion, much more resilient. Let&rsquo;s put it this way. There was</p>
<p>Italian compatriots, Machiavelli, who looked at the time, there was a bunch of small state</p>
<p>democratic Republic of Florence and Venice and the other thing. And there was the Ottoman Empire</p>
<p>that at the time was an empire and the Sultan was very centralized. And he made a political</p>
<p>observation that goes roughly to say, whenever you have such a centralized thing, it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to overtake that former government is centralized. But if you get it, it&rsquo;s so easy to keep</p>
<p>the population. While instead these other things are much more resilient. When the power is</p>
<p>distributed, it&rsquo;s going to be lasting for a much longer time. And ultimately maybe the human spirit</p>
<p>wants that kind of resilience, wants that kind of distribution. It&rsquo;s just that we didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>technology throughout history. Machiavelli didn&rsquo;t have the computer, the internet.</p>
<p>That is certainly part of a reason. Yes. You&rsquo;ve written an interesting blog post. If we</p>
<p>just take a step out of the realm of bits and into the realm of governance, you wrote a blog</p>
<p>post about making Algorand governance decentralized. Can you explain what that means, the philosophy</p>
<p>behind that? How you decentralized basically all aspects of this kind of system?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the philosophy. I really believe that nothing fixed lasts very long.</p>
<p>So I really believe that life is about intelligent adaptation. Things change, and we have to be</p>
<p>nimble and adjust to change. When I see a lot of a crypto project, I&rsquo;m actually very proud to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fixed in stone. Code is law. Law is code. I verify the code. It will never change. You go,</p>
<p>wow. When I&rsquo;m saying this is a recipe to me of disaster, not immediately, but soon. Just imagine</p>
<p>you take an ocean liner, and you want to go, I don&rsquo;t know, from Lisbon to New York, and you set</p>
<p>a course, iceberg, no iceberg, tempest, no tempest. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. You need a teal. You need to</p>
<p>correct. You need to adjust. By the way, you would design Algorand with the idea that the code was</p>
<p>evolving as the needs. Of course, there is a system in which every time there is an adjustment,</p>
<p>you must have essentially a vote that right now is orchestrated at 90% of the stake. They say,</p>
<p>okay, we are ready. We agree on the next version, and we pick up this version. So we are able to</p>
<p>evolve without losing too many components left and right. But I think without evolving, any system</p>
<p>essentially becomes aesthetic and is going to shrivel and die sooner or later. That is needed.</p>
<p>What you want to do on the blockchain, you have a perfect platform in which you can log</p>
<p>your wishes, your votes, your things, so that you have a guarantee that whatever vote you express</p>
<p>is actually seen by everybody else. Everybody sees really the outcome, call it a referendum,</p>
<p>of a change. And Vete is, in my opinion, a system that wants to live long as to adapt.</p>
<p>There is an interesting question about leaders. I&rsquo;ve talked to Vitalik Buterin. I&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>talk to him again soon. He&rsquo;s one of the leaders, maybe one of the faces of the Ethereum project.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting. You have Satoshi Nakamoto, who&rsquo;s the face of Bitcoin, I guess. But he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>faceless. He, she, they. It does seem like in our whatever it is, maybe it&rsquo;s 20th century,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s Machiavellian thinking, but we seek leaders. Leaders have value. Linus Torvalds,</p>
<p>the leader of Linux, the open source development a lot. It&rsquo;s not that the leadership is sort of</p>
<p>dogmatic, but it&rsquo;s inspiring. And it&rsquo;s also powerful in that through leaders, we propagate</p>
<p>the vision. Like the vision of the project is more stable. Maybe not the details, but the vision.</p>
<p>And so do you think there&rsquo;s value to, because there&rsquo;s a tension between decentralization</p>
<p>and leadership, like in visionaries. What do you make of that tension?</p>
<p>SL. Okay. So I really believe that, that&rsquo;s another great question. I think of it,</p>
<p>I really believe in the power of emotions. I think the emotion are of a creative impulse</p>
<p>of everybody else. And therefore it&rsquo;s very easy for a leader to be a physical person, a real</p>
<p>being, and that interprets our emotions. And by the way, these emotions have to resonate.</p>
<p>And what is good is that the more intimate our emotions are, the more universal they are,</p>
<p>paradoxically. The more personal, the more everybody else somehow magically agrees and</p>
<p>feels a bit of the same. And it&rsquo;s very important to have a leader in the initial phase that</p>
<p>generates out of nothing something. That is important leadership. But then the true tested</p>
<p>leadership is to disappear after you lead the community. So in my opinion, the quintessential</p>
<p>leader according to my vision is George Washington. He served for one term, he served for another</p>
<p>term, and then all of a sudden he retired and became a private citizen. And two hundred and</p>
<p>change years later, we still are, with some defects, but we have done a lot of things right.</p>
<p>And we have been able to evolve. That to me is success in leadership.</p>
<p>While instead you contrast our experiment with a lot of our experiment. I&rsquo;ve done so much so well</p>
<p>that I want another four years. And why shouldn&rsquo;t I be only a four and I have another eight?</p>
<p>Why should it be another eight? Give me 16 and I will fix all your problems. And then is the type,</p>
<p>in my opinion, of failed leadership. Leadership ought to be really lead, ignite, and disappear.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t disappear, the system is going to die with you. It is not a good idea for everybody</p>
<p>else. So we&rsquo;ve been talking a little bit about cryptocurrency, but is there spaces where</p>
<p>this kind of blockchain ideas that you&rsquo;re describing, which I find fascinating,</p>
<p>do you think they can revolutionize some other aspects of our world that&rsquo;s not just money?</p>
<p>A lot of things are going to be revolutionized is independent of finance. By the way,</p>
<p>I really believe that finance is an incredible form of freedom. I mean,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m free to do everything I want, but I don&rsquo;t have the means to do anything, that&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>So I really think financial freedom is very, very important. But you just can say that against</p>
<p>you know, censorship, you write something on the chain and now nobody can take it out.</p>
<p>That is a very important way to express our view. And then the transparency that you give,</p>
<p>because everybody can see what&rsquo;s happening on the blockchain. So transparency is not money.</p>
<p>But I believe that transparency actually is a very important ingredient also of finance. Let&rsquo;s put</p>
<p>this way, as much as I&rsquo;m enthusiastic about blockchain and decentralized finance, and we have</p>
<p>actually our expression, we&rsquo;re creating this future five, because as much as we want to do,</p>
<p>we must agree that the first guarantee of financial growth and prosperity are really</p>
<p>the legal system, the courts. Because we may not think about them and say, oh, the courts</p>
<p>are a bunch of boring lawyers. But without them, I&rsquo;m saying there is no certainty. There is no</p>
<p>notion of equality. There is no notion that you can resolve your disputes thing. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what thrives commerce and things. And so what I really believe that the blockchain actually</p>
<p>makes a lot of this trust essentially automatic, but make it impossible to cheat in very way. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even need to go to court if nobody can change the ledger. So essentially it&rsquo;s a way of</p>
<p>you cannot solve an illegal system that reduces to a blockchain. But what I&rsquo;m saying, a big chunk</p>
<p>of it can actually be guaranteed. And there is no reason why technology should be antagonistic</p>
<p>to legal scholarship. It could be actually coexisting and one should start to doing the</p>
<p>interest things that the technology alone cannot do. And then you go from there. But I think that</p>
<p>essentially blockchain can affect all kinds of our behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah. So in some sense, the transparency, the required transparency ensures honesty,</p>
<p>prevents corruption. So there&rsquo;s a lot of systems that could use that. And the legal system is one</p>
<p>of them. There&rsquo;s a little bit of attention that I wonder if you can speak to where this kind of</p>
<p>transparency, there&rsquo;s a tension with privacy. Is it possible to achieve privacy if wanted</p>
<p>on a blockchain? Do you have ideas about different technologies that can do that? People have been</p>
<p>playing with different ideas. So absolutely. The answer is yes. And by the way, I&rsquo;m a cryptographer.</p>
<p>Right. Okay. So I really believe in privacy and I believe in and I&rsquo;ve devoted a big chunk of my</p>
<p>life to guarantee privacy, even when it seems almost impossible to have it. And it is possible</p>
<p>to have it also in the blockchain too. However, I believe in timing as well. And I believe that</p>
<p>the people have the right to understand their system they live in. And right now people can</p>
<p>understand the blockchain to be something that cannot be altered and is transparent. And that</p>
<p>is good enough. And there is a pseudo privacy for the fact that who knows if this public key belongs</p>
<p>to me or to you. And I can, when I want to change my money from one public key, I split it to other</p>
<p>public keys, going to figure out which one is Silvio or all of them are Silvio or only one of</p>
<p>Silvio. Who knows? So you get some vanilla privacy, not the one I could talk. And I think it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>enough because, and it&rsquo;s important for now that we absorb this stage. Because in the next stage,</p>
<p>we must understand the privacy tool rather than taking on faith. When the public starts saying,</p>
<p>I believe in the scientists and whatever they say, I swear by them. And therefore,</p>
<p>the term is private is private and nobody understands it very well. We need a much more</p>
<p>educated about the tools we are using. And so I look forward to deploying more and more privacy</p>
<p>on the blockchain, but we are not, I will not rush to it until the people understand and are behind</p>
<p>whatever we have right now. So you build privacy on top of the power of the blockchain. You have</p>
<p>to first understand the power of the blockchain. Yes. So Algorand is like one of the most exciting,</p>
<p>technically at least from my perspective, technologies, ideas in this whole space.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the future of Algorand look like? Is it possible for it to dominate the world?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way. I certainly working very hard with a great team to give the best blockchain</p>
<p>that one can demand and enjoy. And they said, I really believe that there is going to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a winner takes them all. So it&rsquo;s going to be a few blockchains and each one is going to</p>
<p>have its own brand and it&rsquo;s going to be great at something. And sometimes it&rsquo;s scalability,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s your views, sometimes it&rsquo;s a thing. And it&rsquo;s important to have a dialogue between</p>
<p>these things. And I&rsquo;m sure, and I&rsquo;m working very hard to make sure that Algorand is one of them,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s even desirable to have a winner takes all because we need to express</p>
<p>different things. But the important thing is going to have enough interoperability with</p>
<p>various systems so that you can transfer your assets where you have the best tool to service</p>
<p>them, whatever your needs are at the time. So there&rsquo;s an idea, I don&rsquo;t know, they call</p>
<p>themselves Bitcoin maximalists, which is essentially the bet that the philosophy that</p>
<p>Bitcoin will eat the world. So you&rsquo;re talking about, it&rsquo;s good to have variety.</p>
<p>Their claim is it&rsquo;s good to have the best technology dominate the medium of exchange,</p>
<p>the medium of store of value, the money, the digital currency space.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense of the positives and the negatives of that?</p>
<p>So I feel people are smart and it&rsquo;s going to be very hard for anybody to win. And because</p>
<p>people want more and more things. There is an Italian saying that translates well, I think.</p>
<p>It goes, the appetite grows while eating. I think you understand what he means. So I say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hungry. Okay, food. Let me try this. So we want more and more and more. And when you find</p>
<p>something like Bitcoin, which are already very good things to say, but it does something very</p>
<p>well, but it&rsquo;s a static, I mean, store of value. Yes, I think it&rsquo;s a great way for the rest. You</p>
<p>know, it would be a sad world if the world in which we are so anchoring down, so defensive</p>
<p>that we want to store value and hide it under the mattress. I long for a world in which is open.</p>
<p>People want to transact, interact with each other. And therefore, when you want to store value,</p>
<p>one, perhaps one chain, where you want to have to transact, maybe is another. I&rsquo;m not saying that,</p>
<p>you know, one chain cannot be store of value or another thing, but I really believe,</p>
<p>I believe in the ingenuity of people and in the innovation that is intrinsic to the human nature.</p>
<p>We want always different things. So how can it be something invented,</p>
<p>whatever it is decades ago, is going to fulfill the needs of our future generations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to fulfill my needs, let alone my kids or their kids. We are going to have a</p>
<p>different world and things will evolve. So you believe that life, intelligent life,</p>
<p>is ultimately about adaptability and evolving. So static loses in the end.</p>
<p>Yes. Let me ask the, well, first the ridiculous question. Do you have any</p>
<p>clue who Satoshi Nakamoto is? Is that even an interesting question?</p>
<p>Well, your questions are very interesting. So, and I think, so I would say, first of all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not me. Okay. And I can prove it because, you know, if I were Satoshi Nakamoto, I would</p>
<p>have not found an algorithm. It takes a totally different principle to approach to the system.</p>
<p>But the other thing, who is Satoshi Nakamoto? You know what the right answer is? It&rsquo;s not him</p>
<p>or her or them. Satoshi Nakamoto is Bitcoin. Because to me, it&rsquo;s such a coherent proof of</p>
<p>work that at the end, the creator and the creation identify themselves. So you say,</p>
<p>okay, I understand Michelangelo. Okay. He did the Sistine Chapel. Fine. He did the</p>
<p>St. Peter&rsquo;s Dome. Fine. He did the Moses of the Pieta statue. Fine. But besides this,</p>
<p>who was Michelangelo? That&rsquo;s the wrong question. It&rsquo;s his own work. That is Michelangelo.</p>
<p>So I think that when you look at the Bitcoin is a piece of work that as it defects, yes,</p>
<p>like anything human, but it was captivated the imaginations of millions of people as subverted</p>
<p>the status quo. And I&rsquo;m saying, you know, whoever this person of people are, he&rsquo;s living in this</p>
<p>piece of work. I mean, it is Bitcoin. The idea of the work is bigger. We forget that sometimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something about our biology likes to see a face and attach a face to the idea when really</p>
<p>the idea is the thing we love. The idea is the thing that impact the idea is the thing that</p>
<p>ultimately we, you know, Steve Jobs or somebody like that, we associate with the Mac or the iPhone</p>
<p>with just everything he did at Apple. Apple, actually the company is Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs,</p>
<p>the man is a pales in comparison to the creation. Correct. And the sense of aesthetics that has</p>
<p>brought to the daily lives and very often aesthetic wins in the long, in the long,</p>
<p>in the long game. And these are very elegant design product. And when you say, Oh,</p>
<p>elegance, very few people care about it. Apparently millions and millions and millions</p>
<p>and millions of people do because we are attacked by beauty and these are beautifully designed</p>
<p>products. And, and, and, you know, and they&rsquo;ve in addition to ever the technological aspect</p>
<p>of the other thing. And I think, yes, that is, yeah, as the Stajewski said, beauty will save</p>
<p>the world. So I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m with you on that one. Right. It currently seems like cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>all these different technologies are gathering a lot of excitement, not just in our discourse,</p>
<p>but in their like scale of financial impact. A lot of companies are starting to invest in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Do you think that the main method of store value and exchange of value, basically money will soon</p>
<p>or at some point in the century will become cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Yes. So mind you, as I said, that the notion of cryptocurrency, like any other fundamental human</p>
<p>notion has to evolve, but yes. So I think of it, uh, he has a lot of momentum behind it.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s not only static as a visa programmable money as a smart contract. It allows a peer to</p>
<p>peer interaction among people who don&rsquo;t even know each other. Right. Uh, and they don&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>therefore I cannot even trust each other just because they never saw each other.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s so powerful that, uh, uh, is going to do this said again,</p>
<p>a particular cryptocurrency should develop and cryptocurrency will all develop. But the answer</p>
<p>is yes, we are going towards a much more, uh, unless we have a society, a sudden crisis for</p>
<p>different reasons, which nobody hopes there&rsquo;s always an asteroid. There&rsquo;s always something,</p>
<p>uh, nuclear war and all the existential crisis that we kind of think about,</p>
<p>including artificial intelligence. Uh, okay. It&rsquo;s funny. You mentioned that, um,</p>
<p>um, Michelangelo and Steve jobs, you know, set of ideas represents the person&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>So we talked about Algorand, which is a super interesting set of technologies, but,</p>
<p>you know, he did also win the touring award. You have a bunch of, you have a bunch of ideas that</p>
<p>are, you know, seminal ideas. So can we talk about cryptography for a little bit? What is the most</p>
<p>beautiful idea in cryptography or computer science or mathematics in general asking somebody who has</p>
<p>explored the depths of all? Well, there are a few contenders</p>
<p>and, uh, either your work or, uh, or other words, uh, let&rsquo;s leave my work aside and, uh, and, uh,</p>
<p>so, but one powerful idea and is, uh, both an old idea in some sense and a very, very modern one.</p>
<p>And, uh, in my opinion is this idea of a one way function. So a function that easy to evaluate.</p>
<p>So given X, you can compute F of X easily, but given F of X is very hard to go back to X. Okay.</p>
<p>Think like breaking a glass, easy. Reconstruct the glass harder. Frying an egg, easy. From the</p>
<p>fried egg to go back to the original egg, harder. If you want to be extreme, killing a living being,</p>
<p>unfortunately, easy. The other way around, very hard. And so the fact that the notion of a function,</p>
<p>whichever a recipe that is in front of your eyes to transform an X into F of X,</p>
<p>and then from F of X, even though you see the recipe to transform it, you cannot go back to X.</p>
<p>That in my opinion is one of the most elegant and momentous notions that there are. And it is a</p>
<p>computational notion because of the difficulties in a computational sense. And it&rsquo;s a mathematical</p>
<p>notion because we were talking about function. And it&rsquo;s so fruitful because that is actually</p>
<p>the foundation of all cryptography. And let me tell you, it&rsquo;s an old notion</p>
<p>because very often in any mythology that we think of, the most powerful gods or goddesses are the</p>
<p>ones of X and the opposite of X, the gods of love and death. And when you take opposites,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t just erase one another, you create something way more powerful. And this one,</p>
<p>the function is extremely powerful because essentially becomes something that is easy</p>
<p>for the good guys and hard for the bad guys. So for instance, in pseudo random number generation,</p>
<p>the easy part of the function corresponds, you want to generate bits very quickly. And hard is</p>
<p>predicting what the next bit is. It doesn&rsquo;t look the same. One is X f of X going from X f of X to</p>
<p>X. What does it do? Predicting bits. By a magic of reductions in mathematical apparatus, this simple</p>
<p>function morphs itself into pseudo random generation. This simple function morphs itself in</p>
<p>digital signature scheme in which digitally signing should be easy and forging should be</p>
<p>and forging should be hard. Again, a digital signature is not going from X to f of X,</p>
<p>but the magic and the richness of this notion is that it is so powerful that it morphs in all</p>
<p>kinds of incredible constructs. And in both these two opposites coexist, the easy and the hard,</p>
<p>and in my opinion is a very, very elegant notion. That simple notion ties together cryptography,</p>
<p>and like you said, pseudo random number generation. You have work on pseudo random functions.</p>
<p>What are those? What&rsquo;s the difference in those and the generators, the pseudo random number</p>
<p>generators? How do they work? Let&rsquo;s go back to pseudo random number generation. First of all,</p>
<p>people think that the pseudo random number generation generates a random number. Not true,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t believe that from nothing you can get something. So nothing from nothing.</p>
<p>But randomness, you cannot create it out of nothing, but what you could do</p>
<p>is that it can be expanded. In other words, if you give me somehow 300 random bits,</p>
<p>truly random bits, then I can give you 300,000, 300 million, 300 trillions, 300 quadrillions,</p>
<p>as many as you want random bits, so that even though I tell you the recipe by which I produce</p>
<p>these bits, but I don&rsquo;t tell you the initial 300 random numbers, I keep them secret, and you see</p>
<p>all the bits I produced so far, if you were to bet, given all the bits produced so far,</p>
<p>what is the next bit in my sequence? Better than 50, 50. Of course, 50, 50, anybody can guess.</p>
<p>But to be inferring something, you have to be a bit better. Then the effort to do this extra bit</p>
<p>is so enormous that is de facto random. So that is a pseudo random generator, are these</p>
<p>expanders of secret randomness, which goes extremely fast. Okay, that said, what is that?</p>
<p>Expanders of secret randomness, beautifully put. Okay, so every time somebody, if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>programmer, is using a function that&rsquo;s not called pseudo random, it&rsquo;s called random usually,</p>
<p>you know, these programming languages, and it&rsquo;s generating different, that&rsquo;s essentially</p>
<p>expanding the secret randomness. But they should. In the past, actually, most of the library,</p>
<p>they used something pre modern cryptography, unfortunately. They would be better served</p>
<p>with 300 real seed random number, and then expand them properly, as we know now.</p>
<p>But that has been a very old idea. In fact, one of the best philosophers have debated</p>
<p>whether the world was deterministic or probabilistic. Very big questions, right?</p>
<p>Does God play dice?</p>
<p>Exactly. Einstein says it does, it doesn&rsquo;t. But in fact, now we have a language that even</p>
<p>at the Albert time was not around, but it was this complex theory of modern</p>
<p>complexity based cryptography. And now we know that if the universe has 300 random bits,</p>
<p>whether where is random or probabilistic or deterministic, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>because you can expand this initial seed of randomness forever in which all the experiments</p>
<p>you could do, all the inferences you could do, all the things you could do, they are,</p>
<p>you are not be able to distinguish them from truly random. So if you are not able to distinguish</p>
<p>truly random from this super duper pseudo randomness, are they really different things?</p>
<p>So many to become really philosophical. So for things to be different, but I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>in my lifetime, in the lifetime of the universe, any method to set them aside,</p>
<p>well, I should be intellectually honest, say, well, pseudo random in this special</p>
<p>fraction is as good as random.</p>
<p>Do you think true randomness is possible? And what does that mean?</p>
<p>So practically speaking, exactly as you said, if you&rsquo;re being honest,</p>
<p>that the pseudo randomness approaches true randomness pretty quickly.</p>
<p>But is it, maybe this is a philosophical question. Is there such a thing as true randomness?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is actually maybe, but if it exists, most probably it&rsquo;s expensive to get.</p>
<p>And in any case, if I give you one of mine,</p>
<p>you will never tell them apart by any other shape, no matter how much you work on it.</p>
<p>So in some sense, if it exists or not, it really is a quote philosophical sense in the</p>
<p>colloquial way to say that we cannot somehow pin it down.</p>
<p>Do you ever, again, just to stay unphilosophical for a bit, for a brief moment,</p>
<p>do you ever think about free will and whether that exists because ultimately free will sort of</p>
<p>is this experience that we have, like we&rsquo;re making choices, even though it appears that,</p>
<p>you know, the world is deterministic at the core. I mean, that&rsquo;s against the debate,</p>
<p>but if it is in fact deterministic at the lowest possible level, at the physics level,</p>
<p>how do you make, if it is deterministic, how do you make sense of the difference between the</p>
<p>experience of us feeling like we&rsquo;re making a choice and the whole thing being deterministic?</p>
<p>So first of all, let me give you a gut reaction to the question. And the gut reaction is that</p>
<p>it is important that we believe that there exists free will. And second of all, almost</p>
<p>by weird logic, if we believe it exists, then it does exist. Okay. So it&rsquo;s very important for our</p>
<p>social apparatus, for our sense of ourselves that it exists. And the moment in which, you know,</p>
<p>we so want to, we almost conjure it up in existence. But again, I really feel that if</p>
<p>you look at some point, the space of free will seems to shrink. We realize how more and more,</p>
<p>how much of our, say, genetic apparatus dictates who we are, why we prefer certain things than</p>
<p>others, right, and why we react to noises of music. We really prefer poetry and everything</p>
<p>else. We may explain even all this. But at the end of the day, whether it exists in a</p>
<p>philosophical sense or not, it&rsquo;s like randomness. If pseudo random is as good as random vis a vis</p>
<p>lifetime of the universe, our experience, then it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about randomness. I wonder if I can weave in</p>
<p>quantum mechanics for a brief moment. There&rsquo;s a, you know, a lot of advancements on the quantum</p>
<p>computing side. So leveraging quantum mechanics to perform a new kind of computation, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>concern of that being a threat to a lot of the basic assumptions that underlie cryptography.</p>
<p>What do you think? Do you think quantum computing will challenge a lot of cryptography? Will</p>
<p>cryptography be able to defend all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Okay, great. So first of all, for the record, and not because I think it matters, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to set the record, there are people who continue to contend that quantum mechanics exist,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s nothing to do with computing. It&rsquo;s not going to accelerate it, at least, you know,</p>
<p>very basic, you know, hard computation. That is a belief that you cannot take it out. I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>bit more agnostic about it, but I really believe, going back to whatever I said about the one way</p>
<p>function. So one way function, what is it? That is a cryptography. So does quantum computing</p>
<p>challenge the one way function? Essentially, you can boil it down to does quantum computing</p>
<p>challenge the one way function. What is one way function? Easy in one direction, hard in the other.</p>
<p>Okay, but if quantum computing exists, when you define what it is easy, it&rsquo;s not easy by a classical</p>
<p>computer and hard by a classical computer, but easy for a quantum computer, that&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>But once easy means it should be easy for a quantum and hard for also quantum. Then you can</p>
<p>see that you are, yes, it&rsquo;s a challenge, but you have hope because you can absorb if one computing</p>
<p>really realizes and becomes available according to the promises, then you can use them also for the</p>
<p>easy part. And once you use it from the easy part, the choices that you have a one way function,</p>
<p>they multiply. So, okay, so they particularly candidates of one way function, they not only</p>
<p>candidates of one way function, they not be one way anymore, but quantum one way function may</p>
<p>continue to exist. And so I really believe that for life to be meaningful, this one way function</p>
<p>had to exist. Because just imagine that anything that is becomes easy to do. I mean, what kind of</p>
<p>life is it? I mean, so you need that. And if something is hard, but it&rsquo;s so hard to generate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never find something which is hard for you. You want to that there is abundance,</p>
<p>that is easy to produce hard problem. That&rsquo;s my opinion is why life is interesting,</p>
<p>because pop up really, really speed. So in some sense, I almost think that I do hope they exist</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t exist, somehow life is way less interesting than it actually is.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does. That&rsquo;s funny. It does seem like the one way function is fundamental to all of life,</p>
<p>which is the emergence of the complexity that we see around us seem to require the one way function.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you play with cellular automata. That&rsquo;s just another formulation of.</p>
<p>I know, but it&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost a very simple illustration of starting out with simple rules in one way,</p>
<p>being able to generate incredible amounts of complexity. But then you ask the question,</p>
<p>can I reverse that? And it&rsquo;s just surprising how difficult it is to reverse that. It&rsquo;s surprising,</p>
<p>even in constrained situations, it&rsquo;s very difficult to prove anything that it almost,</p>
<p>I mean, the sad thing about it. Well, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s sad, but it seems like we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have the mathematical tools to reverse engineer stuff. I don&rsquo;t know if they exist or not,</p>
<p>but in the space of cellular automata, where you start with something simple and you create</p>
<p>something incredibly complex, can you take something, a small picture of that complex</p>
<p>and reverse engineer? That&rsquo;s kind of what we&rsquo;re doing as scientists here. You&rsquo;re seeing the result</p>
<p>of the complexity and you&rsquo;re trying to come up with some universal law that generate all of this.</p>
<p>What is the theory of everything? What are the basic physics laws that generated this whole</p>
<p>thing? And there&rsquo;s a hope that you should be able to do that, but it gets, it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah. But there is also some poetry on the fact that it&rsquo;s difficult because it gives us some</p>
<p>mystery to life, without which, I mean, it&rsquo;s not so fun. Life is no business fun.</p>
<p>Can we talk about interactive proofs a little bit and zero knowledge proofs? What are those?</p>
<p>What are those? How do they work?</p>
<p>So interactive proof actually is a modern realization and conceptualization of something</p>
<p>that we knew was true, that is easy to go to lecture. In fact, that&rsquo;s my motivation.</p>
<p>We invented schools to go to lecture. We don&rsquo;t say, oh, I&rsquo;m the minister of education. I published</p>
<p>this book. You read it. This is book for this year, this book for this year. We spend a lot</p>
<p>of our treasury in educating our kids and in person, educating, go to class, interact with</p>
<p>teacher, on the blackboard and chalk on my time. Now we can have a whiteboard and presumably you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have actually this magic pens and a display instead. But the idea is that interactively</p>
<p>you can convey truth much more efficiently. We knew this psychologically. It&rsquo;s better to</p>
<p>hear an explanation than just to belabor some paper. Same thing. So interactive proofs is a</p>
<p>way to do the following. Rather than doing some complicated, very long papers and possibly</p>
<p>infinitely long proofs, exponentially long proofs, you say the following. If this theorem is true,</p>
<p>there is a game that is associated to the theorem. If the theorem is true, this game,</p>
<p>I have a winning strategy that I can win half of the time, no matter what you do.</p>
<p>So then you say, well, is the theorem true? You believe me. Why should I believe you? Okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s play. If I prove that I have a strategy and I win the first time and I win the second time,</p>
<p>then I lose a third time. But I win more than half of the time, or I win, say, all the time</p>
<p>if the theorem is true, and at least at most half of the time if the theorem is false, you</p>
<p>statistically get convinced. You can verify this quickly. And therefore, when the game typically</p>
<p>is extremely fast, so you generate a miniature game in which if the theorem is true, I win all</p>
<p>the time, and if the theorem is false, I can win at most half of the time. And if I win, win, win,</p>
<p>win, win, win, win, win, you can deduce either the theorem is true, which most probably is my</p>
<p>case of the week, or I&rsquo;ve been very, very unlucky because it&rsquo;s like if I had 100 coin tosses and I</p>
<p>got 100 heads. Very improbable. So that is a way. And so this transformation from the formal</p>
<p>statement of a proof into a game that can be quickly played, and you can draw statistics</p>
<p>how many times you win, is one of a big conquest of modern complexity theory. And in fact,</p>
<p>actually has highlighted the notion of a proof as it really gives us a new insight of what to</p>
<p>be true means and what truth is and what proofs are. So these are legitimately proofs. So what</p>
<p>kind of mysteries can it allow us to unlock and prove? You said truth. So what does it allow us?</p>
<p>What kind of truth does that allow us to arrive at? So it enlarges the realm of what is provable</p>
<p>because in some sense of the classical way of proving things was extremely</p>
<p>inefficient from the verifier point of view. Yes.</p>
<p>Right. And so therefore, there is so much proof that you can take. But in this way,</p>
<p>you can actually very quickly, in minutes, verify something that is the correctness of an assertion</p>
<p>that otherwise would have taken a lifetime to belabor and check all the passages of a very,</p>
<p>very, very long proof. And you better check all of them because if you don&rsquo;t check one line,</p>
<p>an error can be in that line. And so you have to go linearly through all the stuff rather than</p>
<p>bypass this. So you enlarge a tremendous amount what the proof is. And in addition,</p>
<p>once you have the idea that essentially a proof system is something that</p>
<p>allows me to convince you of a true statement, but does not allow me to convince you of a false</p>
<p>statement, and that at the end is proof. Proof can be beautiful, should be elegant,</p>
<p>but at the end is true or false. It is possible to prove the truth and it should be impossible</p>
<p>or statistically extremely hard to prove something false. And if you do this, you can prove way,</p>
<p>way more once you understand this. And on top of it, we got some insight like in this zero</p>
<p>knowledge proofs that is in something which you took for granted where the same knowledge</p>
<p>and verification are actually separate concepts. So you can verify that an assertion is correct</p>
<p>without having any idea why this is so. And so people failed to say, if you want to verify</p>
<p>something, you have to have the proof. Once you have the proof, you know why it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>you have the proof itself. So somehow you can totally differentiate knowledge and verification</p>
<p>validity. So totally, you can decide if something is true and still have no idea.</p>
<p>Is there a good example in your mind?</p>
<p>Oh, actually, you know, at the beginning, we labored to find the first zero knowledge proof.</p>
<p>Then we found a second, then we found a third. And then a few years later, actually, we proved</p>
<p>a theorem which essentially says every theorem, no matter what about, can be explained in a zero</p>
<p>knowledge way. So it&rsquo;s not a class of theorem, but all theorems. And it&rsquo;s a very powerful thing. So</p>
<p>we were really, for thousands of years, bought this identity between knowledge and verification</p>
<p>had to be hand in hand together, and for no reason at all. I mean, we had to develop a</p>
<p>way of technology. As you know, I&rsquo;m very big on technology because it makes us more human</p>
<p>and make us understand more things than before. And I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>So this interactive proof process, there&rsquo;s power in games.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve recently gotten into, recently, I&rsquo;m not sure you can correct me, mechanism design.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So first of all, maybe you can explain what mechanism design is and the fascinating</p>
<p>space of playing with games and designing games.</p>
<p>Mechanism design is that you want a certain behavior to arise. If you want to organize</p>
<p>a societal structure or something, you want to have some orderly behavior to arise because</p>
<p>it is important for your goals. But you know that people, they don&rsquo;t care what my goals are.</p>
<p>They care about maximizing their utility. So put it crassly, making money. The more money,</p>
<p>the better, so to speak. I&rsquo;m exaggerating.</p>
<p>Self interest in whatever way then.</p>
<p>So what you want to do is, ideally, what you want to do is to design a game so that</p>
<p>while people play it, so to maximize their self interest, they achieve the social goal</p>
<p>and behavior that I want. That is really the best type of thing. And it is a very</p>
<p>hard science and art to design these games. And it challenges us to actually come up with</p>
<p>solution concepts for a way to analyzing the games that need to be broader. And I think</p>
<p>game theory has developed a bunch of very compelling ways to analyze the game,</p>
<p>that if the game has the best property, you can have a pretty good guarantee that it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be played in a given way. But as it turns out, and not surprisingly, these tools have a range</p>
<p>of action like anything else. All these so called the technical resolution concept,</p>
<p>the way to analyze the game, like dominant strategy equilibrium, if something comes to mind,</p>
<p>would be very meaningful. But as a limited power, in some sense, the games that can be</p>
<p>admit to such a way to be analyzed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very specific kind of games and the rules are set, the constraints are set,</p>
<p>the utilities are all set.</p>
<p>Yes. So if you want to reason, if there is a way, say, that you can analyze a restricted</p>
<p>class of games this way, but most games don&rsquo;t fall into this restricted class, then what do I do?</p>
<p>When you need to enlarge a way what a rational player can do. So for instance, in my opinion,</p>
<p>at least in some of my, I played with this for a few years, and I was doing some exoteric things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, in the space that was not exactly mainstream. And then I changed my interest in</p>
<p>blockchain. But what I&rsquo;m saying for a while I was doing. So for instance, to me, is a way in which</p>
<p>I design the game, and you don&rsquo;t have the best move for you. The best move is the move that is</p>
<p>best for you, no matter what the other players are doing. Sometimes a game doesn&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s too much to ask. But I can design the game such that given the option in front of you</p>
<p>say, oh, these are really stupid for me, take them aside. But these, these are not stupid.</p>
<p>So if you design the game so that in any combination of non stupid things that the player</p>
<p>can do, I achieve what I want, I&rsquo;m done. I don&rsquo;t care to find the very unique equilibrium. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a damn. I want to say, well, as long as you don&rsquo;t do stupid things, and nobody else does</p>
<p>stupid things, good social things outcome arise, I should be equally happy. And so I really believe</p>
<p>that this type of analysis is possible and has a bigger radius. So it reaches more games, more</p>
<p>classes or games. And after that, we have to enlarge it again. And it&rsquo;s going to be, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have fun because human behavior can be conceptualized in many ways. And it&rsquo;s a long game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long game. Do you have favorite games that you&rsquo;re looking at now? I mean, I suppose</p>
<p>your work with blockchain and Algorand is a kind of game that you&rsquo;re basically this mechanism</p>
<p>design, design the game such that it&rsquo;s scalable, secure and decentralized, right? Yes. And very</p>
<p>often you have to say, and you must also design so that the incentives are, and tell you the truth,</p>
<p>whatever little I learned from my venture in mechanism design is that incentives are very</p>
<p>hard to design because people are very complex creatures. And so somehow the way we design</p>
<p>Algorand is a totally different way, essentially with no incentives, essentially. But technically</p>
<p>speaking, there is a notion that is actually believable, right? So that to say people want</p>
<p>to maximize their utility. Yes. Up to a point. Let me tell you. Assume that if you are honest,</p>
<p>you make a hundred bucks. But if you are dishonest, no matter how dishonest you are,</p>
<p>you can only make a hundred bucks and one cent. What are you going to be? I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>you know what? Technically speaking, even that one cent, nobody bothers and say,</p>
<p>how much am I going to make by honest? A hundred. If I&rsquo;m devious and if I&rsquo;m a criminal,</p>
<p>100 bucks and one cent, you know, I might as well be honest. Okay. So that essentially is called,</p>
<p>you know, Epsilon utility equilibrium, but I think it&rsquo;s good. And that&rsquo;s what we design</p>
<p>essentially means that, you know, having no incentives is actually a good thing because</p>
<p>prevent people from reasoning, how else are you going to gain the system? But why can we achieve</p>
<p>an algorithm to have no incentives and in Bitcoin instead, you have to pay the miners because they</p>
<p>do a tremendous amount of work. Because if you have to do a lot of work, then you demand to be</p>
<p>paid accordingly. Because you, right? But if I&rsquo;m going to say you have to add two and two equal</p>
<p>to four, how much you want me to pay for this? If you don&rsquo;t give me this, I don&rsquo;t add the two</p>
<p>and two. I would say you can add two and two in your sleep. You don&rsquo;t need to be paid to add the</p>
<p>two and two. So the idea is that if we make the system so efficient, so that generating the next</p>
<p>block is so damn simple, it doesn&rsquo;t hit the universe, let alone my computer, let alone</p>
<p>take some microsecond of computation, I might as well not being received incentives for doing that</p>
<p>and try to incentivize some other part of the system, but not to the main consensus,</p>
<p>which is a mechanism for generating and adding block to the chain.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;re Italian, Sicilian, I also heard rumors that you are a connoisseur of food.</p>
<p>If I said today&rsquo;s the last day you get to be alive, you shouldn&rsquo;t have trusted me.</p>
<p>You never know with a Russian whether you&rsquo;re going to make it out or not. Well, if you had</p>
<p>one last meal, you can travel somewhere in the world. Either you make it or somebody else makes</p>
<p>it. What&rsquo;s that going to look like? All right. If it&rsquo;s one last meal, I must say in this era of</p>
<p>COVID, I have not been able to see my mom. My mom was a fantastic chef and had this very</p>
<p>traditional food. As you know, the very traditional food are great for a reason,</p>
<p>because they survived hundreds of years of culinary innovation. There is one very laborious</p>
<p>thing, which is, you heard the name, which is parmigiana, but to do it is a piece of</p>
<p>art. So many hours that only my mom could do it. If we have one last meal, I want a parmigiana.</p>
<p>Okay. What&rsquo;s the laborious process? Is it the ingredients? Is it the actual process?</p>
<p>Is it the atmosphere and the humans involved?</p>
<p>The latter. The ingredient like in any other, in the Italian cuisine, believes in very few</p>
<p>ingredients. If you take say quintessential Italian recipe, spaghetti pesto. Pesto is olive oil,</p>
<p>very good extra virgin olive oil, basil, pine nuts, pepper, clove of garlic, not too much,</p>
<p>otherwise you overpower everything. And then to do either two schools of thought, parmesan or pecorino</p>
<p>or a mix of the two. I mentioned six ingredients. That is typical Italian. I understand that there</p>
<p>are other cuisines, for instance, a French cuisine, which is extremely sophisticated</p>
<p>and extremely combinatorial, or some Chinese cuisine, which has a lot of many more ingredients</p>
<p>than this. And yet the art is to put them together a lot of things. In Italy is really the striving</p>
<p>for simplicity, yet to find few ingredients, but the right ingredients to create something.</p>
<p>So in parmigiana, the ingredients are eggplants, tomatoes, basil, but how to put them together</p>
<p>and the process is an act of love, labor and love. You can spend the entire day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exaggerating, but the entire morning for sure to do it properly.</p>
<p>Yeah, as a Japanese cuisine too, there&rsquo;s a mastery to the simplicity with the sushi. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve seen Giorgio&rsquo;s of sushi, but there&rsquo;s a mastery to that that&rsquo;s propagated through the</p>
<p>generations. It&rsquo;s fascinating. You know, people love it when I ask about books. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if books, whether fiction, nonfiction, technical or completely non technical had an impact on your</p>
<p>life throughout. If there&rsquo;s anything you would recommend or even just mention as something that</p>
<p>gave you an insight or moved you in some way. So, okay. So I don&rsquo;t know if I can comment because</p>
<p>in some sense you almost had to be Italian or to be such a scholar, but being Italian,</p>
<p>one thing that really impressed me tremendously is the Divine Comedy. It is a medieval poem,</p>
<p>a very long poem divided in three parts, hell, purgatory and paradise. Okay. And that is the</p>
<p>non trivial story of a middle man gets into a crisis, personal crisis. And then out of this</p>
<p>crisis he purifies, makes a catastrophe, purifies himself more and more and more until he&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>capable of actually meeting God. Okay. And that is actually a complex story. So you have to get</p>
<p>some very sophisticated language, maybe Latin at that point. We are talking about 1200s Italy,</p>
<p>in Florence. And this guy instead, he chose his own dialect, not spoken outside his own immediate</p>
<p>circle, a Florentine dialect. Actually, Dante really made Italian, Italian. How can you express</p>
<p>such a sophisticated thing? And then the point is that these words that nobody actually knew</p>
<p>because they were essentially dialect and plus a bunch of very intricate rhymes in which they had</p>
<p>to rhyme with things. And it turns out that by getting meaning from the things that rhyme,</p>
<p>you essentially guess what the word means and you invent Italian and you communicate</p>
<p>it by almost osmosis what you want. It&rsquo;s a miracle of communication. In a dialect,</p>
<p>a very poor language, very unsophisticated to express very sophisticated situation.</p>
<p>I love it. People love it, Italians and not Italian. But what I got of it is that very often</p>
<p>limitations are our strength. Because if you limit yourself at a very poor language,</p>
<p>somehow you get out of it and you achieve even better form of communication using a hyper</p>
<p>sophisticated literary language with lots of resonance from the prior books so that you can</p>
<p>actually instantaneously quote. He couldn&rsquo;t quote anything because nothing was written in Italian</p>
<p>before him. So I really felt that limitations are our strength. And I think that rather than</p>
<p>complaining about the limitations, we should embrace them because if we embrace our limitation,</p>
<p>limited as we are, we find very creative solutions that people with less limitation we have,</p>
<p>we would not even think about it. So limitations are kind of superpower if you choose to see it</p>
<p>that way. Since you speak both languages, is there something that&rsquo;s lost in translation to you? Is</p>
<p>there something you can express in Italian that you can&rsquo;t in English and vice versa maybe? Is</p>
<p>there something you could say to the musicality of the language? I mean, I&rsquo;ve been to Italy a few</p>
<p>times and I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the actual words, but the people are certainly very, there&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>language too. There&rsquo;s just the whole being is language. So I don&rsquo;t know if you miss some of that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re speaking English in this country. Yes. In fact, actually, certainly I miss it.</p>
<p>And somehow it was a sacrifice that I made consciously by the time I arrived. I knew that</p>
<p>this, I was not going to express myself at that level. And it was actually a sacrifice because</p>
<p>given to you also your mother tongue is Russian. So you know that you can be very expressive in</p>
<p>your mother tongue and not very expressive in a new tongue, a new language. And then what people</p>
<p>think of you in the new language, because when the precise of expression of things, it generates,</p>
<p>it shows elegance or it shows knowledge or it shows as a census or it shows as a caste or</p>
<p>education, whatever it is. So all of a sudden I found myself on the bottom.</p>
<p>So I had to fight all my way up, back up. But what I&rsquo;m saying, their limitations are actually</p>
<p>our strength. In fact, it&rsquo;s a trick to limit yourself to exceed. And there are examples in</p>
<p>history. If you think about Hernan Cortes, he goes to invade Mexico. He has what, a few hundred</p>
<p>people with him and he has a hundred thousand people in arms on the other side. First thing he</p>
<p>does, he limits himself. He sinks his own ship. There is no return. And at that point he actually</p>
<p>manages. That&rsquo;s really profound. I actually, first of all, this inspiring to me, I feel like I have</p>
<p>quite a few limitations, but more practically on the Russian side, I&rsquo;m going to try to do a couple</p>
<p>of really big and really tough interviews in Russian. Once COVID lifts a little bit, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>traveling to Russia and I&rsquo;ll keep your advice in mind that the limitations is a kind of superpower.</p>
<p>We should use it to our advantage because you do feel less, like you&rsquo;re not able to convey</p>
<p>your wisdom in the Russian language. Cause I moved here when I was 13. So you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the parts of life you live under a certain language are the parts of life you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to communicate. I became a thoughtful, deeply thoughtful human in English.</p>
<p>But the pain from World War II, the music of the people that was instilled with me in Russian.</p>
<p>So I can carry both of those and there&rsquo;s limitations in both. I can&rsquo;t say philosophically</p>
<p>profound stuff in Russian, but I can&rsquo;t in English express like that melancholy feeling</p>
<p>of like the people. And so combining those two, I&rsquo;ll somehow.</p>
<p>Oh, beautifully said. Thanks for sharing. This is great. Yes. I totally understand you. Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve accomplished some incredible things in the space of science, in the space of</p>
<p>technology, in the space of theory and engineering. Do you have advice for somebody young,</p>
<p>an undergraduate student, somebody in high school or anyone who just feels young</p>
<p>about life or about career, about making their way in this world?</p>
<p>So I was telling before that I believe in emotion and my thing is to be true to your</p>
<p>own emotion. And that I think that if you do that, you&rsquo;re doing well because it&rsquo;s a life well spent</p>
<p>and you are going never tire because you want to solve all these emotional knots that</p>
<p>always intrigued you from the beginning. And I really believe that to live meaningfully,</p>
<p>creatively, and yet to live your emotional life. So I really believe that whether you&rsquo;re a scientist</p>
<p>or an artist even more, but a scientist, I think of them as artists as well. If you are a human</p>
<p>being, so you are really to live fully your emotions and to the extent possible, sometimes</p>
<p>emotions can be overbearing and my advice is try to express them with more and more confident.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard, but you are going to be much more fulfilled than by suppressing them.</p>
<p>What about love? One of the big ones. What role does that play?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bigger part of emotions. It&rsquo;s a scary thing. It&rsquo;s a lot of vulnerability that comes</p>
<p>with love, but there is also so much energy and power and love in all senses and in the traditional</p>
<p>sense, but also in the sense of a broader sense for humanity, this feeling, this compassion that</p>
<p>makes us one with other people and the suffering of other people. All of this is very scary stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really the fabric of life. Well, the sad thing is it really hurts to lose it.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s why the vulnerability comes with it. That&rsquo;s the thing about emotion is</p>
<p>the up and the down and the down seems to come always with up, but the up only comes with the</p>
<p>down. Let me ask you about the ultimate down, which is unfortunately we humans are mortal</p>
<p>or appear to be for the most part. Do you think about your own mortality? Do you fear death?</p>
<p>I hope so. Without death, there is no life. At least there is no meaningful life. Death is</p>
<p>actually in some sense our ultimate motivator to live a beautiful and meaningful life. I myself</p>
<p>felt as a young man that unless I got something that I wanted to do, I don&rsquo;t know why I got this</p>
<p>idea of something to say. If I&rsquo;m not able to say, I would suicide. Maybe it was a way to motivate</p>
<p>myself, but you don&rsquo;t need to motivate it because in some sense, unfortunately, death is there.</p>
<p>So you better get up and do your thing because that is the best motivation to live fully.</p>
<p>Well, what do you hope your legacy is?</p>
<p>You mentioned you have two kids.</p>
<p>Yes. I really feel that on one side is my biological legacy and that is my two kids</p>
<p>and their kids, hopefully. That is one side. The other thing is this common enterprise,</p>
<p>which is society. I really feel that my legacy would be better by providing security and privacy.</p>
<p>Actually, for me, it&rsquo;s metaphorical to say I want to give you the ability to interact more and take</p>
<p>more risks and reach out more for more people as difficult and dangerous as it may seem.</p>
<p>But my whole scientific work is about to guarantee privacy and give you the security</p>
<p>of interaction. Not only in a transaction, like it would be a blockchain transaction, but</p>
<p>that is really one of the hardcore of my emotional problems. I think that these are</p>
<p>the problems I want to tackle. Ultimately, privacy and security is freedom.</p>
<p>Freedom is at the core of this. It&rsquo;s dangerous. It&rsquo;s like the emotion thing,</p>
<p>but ultimately, that&rsquo;s how we create all the beautiful things around us. Do you think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>meaning to it all, this life, except the urgency that death provides and us anxious</p>
<p>beings create cool stuff along the way? Is there a deeper meaning? If it is, what is it?</p>
<p>Well, meaning of life. Actually, there are three meanings of life.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great. One, to seek. Two, to seek. And three, to seek.</p>
<p>To seek what? Or is there no answer to that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no answer to that. I really think that the journey is more important than the destination,</p>
<p>whatever that be. I think that is a journey and is, in my opinion, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I must admit, meaningful in itself. We must admit that maybe whatever your destination might be,</p>
<p>at the end, we may never get there, but hell was a great ride towards it.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end this, Silvio. Thank you for wasting your extremely</p>
<p>valuable time with me today, joining on this journey of seeking something together. We found</p>
<p>nothing, but it was very fun. I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much for talking to us.</p>
<p>Thank you, Alex. It&rsquo;s been really special for me to be interviewed by you.</p>
