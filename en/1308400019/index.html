    <p>Hi friends! So today we&rsquo;re gonna talk about toxic people and people you can</p>
<p>get away from people you can&rsquo;t you know because we got like family that you want</p>
<p>to cut them the fuck off but you can&rsquo;t and then you got like friends which you</p>
<p>can cut off but sometimes you just don&rsquo;t want to you know like a little toxic</p>
<p>keeps it fun but as always I&rsquo;m gonna give you my like honest thoughts</p>
<p>opinions and all the aboves and all the etc about the topic of toxicity because</p>
<p>people throw out that fucking title like it&rsquo;s nothing y&rsquo;all know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like that and y&rsquo;all know I like to hold people accountable so the motherfuckers</p>
<p>that be saying oh my god they&rsquo;re so toxic bitch it takes two to toxic just</p>
<p>like it takes two to tango so what the fuck are you doing let&rsquo;s look it back at</p>
<p>you you know let&rsquo;s get some self-awareness in this bitch let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s point the finger both ways and assess what&rsquo;s going on you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how I operate and that&rsquo;s why a lot of people don&rsquo;t like my advice and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like what I have to say is because I&rsquo;m gonna hold you the fuck accountable to</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing too it&rsquo;s not just about them and how they&rsquo;re bad and wrong</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re contributing to let&rsquo;s just see how but then I&rsquo;m also gonna give you</p>
<p>some tips about how to deal with these people because most of the time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>emotionally stunted behaving like toddlers no emotional maturity and you</p>
<p>want to knock them upside the fucking head but that&rsquo;s illegal so I do have a</p>
<p>couple tricks up my sleeve and a couple things from my own experience that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna share but I do need to knock this one ball out the fucking park real fast</p>
<p>I have a lot of people message me and bitches will be like oh my god my</p>
<p>boyfriend is so toxic like he&rsquo;s just so toxic and narcissistic and my immediate</p>
<p>thought is okay then why the fuck are you with him like you understand that</p>
<p>this person behaves in a way that&rsquo;s damaging to you why the fuck are you</p>
<p>still with them and a lot of times people use the excuse of oh well I love</p>
<p>him so in order to love him you have to not love yourself and not consider</p>
<p>yourself like you have to choose to hurt yourself in order to love him how&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>fair to you you&rsquo;re basically picking them over yourself so your entire life</p>
<p>is gonna be fucked and it&rsquo;s gonna be chaos and so you learn to choose you</p>
<p>just a heads up like that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m saying it takes two to toxic once you</p>
<p>have the awareness that someone is like detrimental to your life do what you can</p>
<p>to get them the fuck out of it like do what you can just period that part do</p>
<p>what you can to get out of it and to not be around them if you can leave them</p>
<p>then fucking leave them but it&rsquo;s easy to trap yourself in it and like convince</p>
<p>yourself that you&rsquo;re stuck in it when you&rsquo;re really not but I just wanted to</p>
<p>get that out of the way and throw that little piece of insight out why the fuck</p>
<p>are you still there once you gain the awareness why are you still there why</p>
<p>are you still choosing to be in that because once somebody shows you who they</p>
<p>are if you choose to keep going back you&rsquo;re choosing to abuse yourself at</p>
<p>that point if they&rsquo;ve shown you they don&rsquo;t care that their actions hurt you</p>
<p>and you choose to keep going forward with them it&rsquo;s your fucking</p>
<p>responsibility now grab yourself by the fucking nuts and leave like you just</p>
<p>need to become aware of that and take accountability for once they show you</p>
<p>who they are if you keep going back now it&rsquo;s on you I need to make you aware</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a choice so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to explain right now once you</p>
<p>have the awareness they&rsquo;re fucked up or they&rsquo;re treating you bad moving forward</p>
<p>from there you are choosing to deal with it you are choosing the abuse you are</p>
<p>choosing the toxic you are choosing it you have to see that it&rsquo;s a choice so</p>
<p>that you can choose differently you can&rsquo;t just stay blind to it once you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware like I&rsquo;ve always say awareness is a fucking bitch because now you got to</p>
<p>make a change a great analogy of this is a stovetop if you don&rsquo;t know what a</p>
<p>stove is you don&rsquo;t understand it gets hot you reach up and you touch it and it</p>
<p>burns the fuck out of you now you&rsquo;re aware okay a stove is hot and it will</p>
<p>burn me if I keep touching it so I&rsquo;m not gonna touch it anymore but if you go</p>
<p>back and you touch the stove again dumbass what are you fucking doing like</p>
<p>now you know that it&rsquo;s hot now you know what a stove is now you know it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>burn you every time you go back and touch it so stop fucking touching it if</p>
<p>you want to stop getting burned does that make sense sometimes you just got</p>
<p>to simplify it and I know relationships are very very complex but just take a</p>
<p>second to look at it like that quit touching the goddamn stove bitch but</p>
<p>that brings me back to my point on accountability the reason I&rsquo;m so big on</p>
<p>that is because you can&rsquo;t control other people I always advise to go for what is</p>
<p>in your control so if you want to stop being burned you can choose to stop</p>
<p>touching the stove that is your immediate way to stop being burned but</p>
<p>other people will look at the stove and tell the stove why it&rsquo;s bad and get mad</p>
<p>at the stove for burning it and try to change the stove don&rsquo;t be so hot you</p>
<p>need to cool down you know you cannot control the stove if there&rsquo;s no fucking</p>
<p>knob on it like a human being you can&rsquo;t control them there&rsquo;s no knob so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a stove with no knob you can&rsquo;t control it so you putting your energy</p>
<p>into trying to change the stove for what it is is pointless it&rsquo;s a waste now</p>
<p>flip the analogy of a stove into the person that you think is toxic putting</p>
<p>energy into trying to change them is a fucking waste what is in your control</p>
<p>your ability to stop touching the stove so stop fucking touching it focus on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in your control that&rsquo;s the big part behind accountability because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re gonna make improvements that&rsquo;s where things are</p>
<p>gonna get better you&rsquo;re gonna waste your fucking time and be nothing but</p>
<p>stressed out and a goddamn wreck put in all this effort I have to get the stove</p>
<p>to stop burning me oh my god it&rsquo;s like bitch just stop fucking touching it stop</p>
<p>trying to change the stove it is what it is you know that it&rsquo;s hot you know it</p>
<p>will burn you don&rsquo;t fucking touch it okay I did start this off a little ranty</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very in your face on this one but I&rsquo;m about to soften up okay so my first</p>
<p>like piece of advice with dealing with toxic people whether it&rsquo;s your parents</p>
<p>friends a partner whoever you think is toxic in your life look at them from a</p>
<p>different lens for a second and just try to understand them for who they are I</p>
<p>know hang on hang on before you turn this off and you&rsquo;re like shut up Leo</p>
<p>what the fuck are you on about just hang on look at them and try to understand</p>
<p>why they behave the way that they do how is it benefiting them and how could</p>
<p>behaving the way that they do have come about for them like why would they have</p>
<p>started to behave the way that they do like narcissists people want to throw</p>
<p>that term around don&rsquo;t know what the fuck they&rsquo;re talking about but</p>
<p>narcissism is not a personality disorder it&rsquo;s an adaptive behavioral strategy</p>
<p>people adapt that okay but that&rsquo;s for another fucking episode I&rsquo;ll do a whole</p>
<p>episode of narcissists if you want but if you just look at these toxic people</p>
<p>if they exhibit toxic traits I don&rsquo;t really like the term toxic so if you</p>
<p>just look at somebody that treats you a way that you don&rsquo;t want to be treated</p>
<p>why would they think that&rsquo;s okay like get fully in their perspective for a</p>
<p>minute and try to understand how that came about like how they became the way</p>
<p>that they are and once you start understanding someone you can&rsquo;t judge</p>
<p>them because once you understand why something is the way that it is you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t judge it so hard and sometimes you end up not being able to judge it at all</p>
<p>because now you fucking get it so I know it&rsquo;s very hard when someone is like a</p>
<p>piece of shit from your perspective but just put down the defense and the</p>
<p>offense for a second and just climb into their perspective and try to see what</p>
<p>possibly could have led them to behaving the way that they do now you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying do it to give them sympathy or anything I&rsquo;m just saying get a</p>
<p>general understanding because a need is being met for them for whatever they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking doing I don&rsquo;t care how twisted and fucked up it is and one thing about</p>
<p>human beings every single action that a human being takes is to try to feel</p>
<p>better at the core of it at the base of it everyone is just trying to feel</p>
<p>better it does not matter what the action is when you boil it down to the</p>
<p>core of the true intention it&rsquo;s to feel better so you can kind of take on a</p>
<p>little bit of a more compassionate attitude once you reassure yourself of</p>
<p>that people&rsquo;s intentions are not as negative and is not as harmful as you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>assume and it&rsquo;s a lot more going on with them but yeah that&rsquo;s my first tip</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll help you get a little bit of compassion and a little bit of</p>
<p>understanding for the person that you&rsquo;re working with you know because like I</p>
<p>said sometimes you can&rsquo;t cut them off like if they&rsquo;re family you can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>cut them off and my next piece of advice on that is like family members or</p>
<p>someone that you cannot cut off you need to just start going to them for what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re useful for so I&rsquo;m gonna give you some examples so if you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>your parents like they&rsquo;re just royal fuck-ups and they can&rsquo;t do shit right</p>
<p>stop trying to get every single need met by them stop expecting them to be</p>
<p>perfect stop expecting them to be capable of doing everything for you and</p>
<p>this goes for a parent or you want to look at this from a perspective of a</p>
<p>partner or a friend don&rsquo;t expect just one person to be able to do it all and</p>
<p>meet all the needs you have so if you just keep seeing things and like reasons</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a fuck-up that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re gonna keep seeing until you deliberately</p>
<p>switch your focus so until you decide okay what is my parents actually good at</p>
<p>and you start questioning it and you start wondering you&rsquo;re opening yourself</p>
<p>up to now seeing what they&rsquo;re good at and what needs they can meet so like an</p>
<p>example is my dad I&rsquo;ve talked about it before he&rsquo;s not the person to go to for</p>
<p>emotional support at all he does not understand emotions are a thing like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not the fucking one to go to for that but if you have a problem if you</p>
<p>need something fixed if there&rsquo;s a threat to your safety or you need someone to be</p>
<p>there for you like and come get you or you have any trouble with your fucking</p>
<p>car or like you need to eat he&rsquo;s the one to fucking go to he&rsquo;ll make sure you eat</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re safe he&rsquo;ll make sure you have a bed to sleep in he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make sure you have clothes he&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re protected but that&rsquo;s it like</p>
<p>he can do what he can do but you&rsquo;re never gonna see where your parent or</p>
<p>someone is good enough when you&rsquo;re only focused on where they&rsquo;re not so like my</p>
<p>whole point with this is go to people for what they&rsquo;re good at if I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>experienced with my dad he&rsquo;s not comforting he&rsquo;s not like emotionally</p>
<p>supportive or soothing I now know don&rsquo;t go to him for that but it doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>to write him off that he&rsquo;s fucking useless because I just have one problem</p>
<p>right now there&rsquo;s other problems that I can go to him for there&rsquo;s other things</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s resourceful for for having him in my life and especially like your dad you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t cut them off you know like you can but it&rsquo;s just like a pain in the ass so</p>
<p>I focus on the areas my dad is good at so when I have a problem with any of the</p>
<p>areas that he&rsquo;s great with and he has proven that he&rsquo;s reliable I&rsquo;ll go to him</p>
<p>for that but I don&rsquo;t go to him for emotional support I&rsquo;ll go to my sister</p>
<p>or my mom or a friend or whoever whatever the situation is I know who I</p>
<p>can go to for what so start looking at the people in your life the toxic ones</p>
<p>that you think are toxic they might be toxic and 25 different fucking angles or</p>
<p>areas but there might be one area that they&rsquo;re actually pretty fucking good in</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just being there to listen to you talk or to fuck it some people</p>
<p>are good at just cuddling like you have those friends where you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>fuck you just want to cuddle they can cuddle just start looking for the voids</p>
<p>that certain people can fill and looking for what people are good at and then get</p>
<p>that from them there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that like let people be useful to</p>
<p>you even the toxic ones like if you can&rsquo;t cut them out of your life at least</p>
<p>let them be there for you in the ways that they can like if they&rsquo;re stuck in</p>
<p>your life make them fucking useful is my point I do want to circle back really</p>
<p>quick with an example to the understanding them part so this is just</p>
<p>one example that I see a lot of people deal with is their parents holding money</p>
<p>over their head or like their parent will do something for them and then</p>
<p>will remind them that they fucking did that for them and that means you should</p>
<p>behave a certain way or like you&rsquo;re in debt to them now you know like they</p>
<p>expect you to act a certain way because they paid for something for you or they</p>
<p>bought you something so if you look at trying to understand a parent that does</p>
<p>this that is a person that feels very unsafe so people that use money to</p>
<p>control others whoo that&rsquo;s a lot to unpack but that is a person that has</p>
<p>learned that money is one of the best ways to get people to behave the way</p>
<p>that they want they don&rsquo;t believe that people will just treat them right and</p>
<p>consider them and behave correctly towards them just because they care</p>
<p>about them like these are the people that think they need to provide</p>
<p>something and like put money over your head or do something for you to guarantee</p>
<p>that you will act right or be nice to them so it&rsquo;s for them to feel safe and</p>
<p>to feel like they have some sort of control because if someone needs to do</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve had some bad experiences where people have like royally fucked</p>
<p>them or not considered them or whatever it is but the attitude of understanding</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna keep fucking saying that because it&rsquo;s so much more important than</p>
<p>people realize but the whole like parent holding money over your head they might</p>
<p>do shit for you financially that they know you can&rsquo;t do for yourself to</p>
<p>guarantee connection with them they want to feel useful to you so they feel like</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t lose you but that can become a very toxic fucking cycle because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna do something for you and then they expect you to act a certain</p>
<p>way and then when you don&rsquo;t act that way they feel like ripped off they feel</p>
<p>betrayed so they&rsquo;re gonna throw it back in your face and be like what the fuck</p>
<p>like I did this this and this for you ungrateful little shit but that is a</p>
<p>toxic situation where like they do something for you with strings attached</p>
<p>with undisclosed expectations and then when you don&rsquo;t uphold those they feel</p>
<p>like they were like ripped off so it&rsquo;s like they put you in a contract that you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know that you were in and by you behaving a way that they didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>they feel like you just voided the contract and just like betrayed them</p>
<p>but their lack of communication is the thing that&rsquo;s actually fucking them in</p>
<p>that situation but someone that&rsquo;s not aware is not gonna see that so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their own fucking shit to deal with but that&rsquo;s a dynamic that can become very</p>
<p>toxic so if you understand that your parent is like that don&rsquo;t accept money</p>
<p>from them find another way to get it or if you&rsquo;re going to accept money from</p>
<p>them get very clear be like okay by you paying for this for me what are you</p>
<p>expecting are you expecting anything ask them and that&rsquo;s their chance to be</p>
<p>very fucking honest and then voice your worry or your concern be like hey I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just worried if I accept this and then if I do something you don&rsquo;t like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try and guilt me and shame me and hold this over my head and like throw it</p>
<p>back in my face say that doesn&rsquo;t feel good and it makes me want to push you</p>
<p>away when you do that so like if I&rsquo;m gonna accept this money or if I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>let you pay for this thing for me I just want the reassurance that that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna happen because I don&rsquo;t like the way that it makes me feel toward you say</p>
<p>something along those lines and be very fucking clear about it and then if they</p>
<p>continue to do it even after you communicate stop accepting money</p>
<p>altogether but you get what I mean where there&rsquo;s ways to deal with these people</p>
<p>but you have to understand them first you kind of have to get an understanding</p>
<p>of why they&rsquo;re doing what they&rsquo;re doing what they&rsquo;re getting out of it this is</p>
<p>very hard to explain and unpack like I can just do it like if you came to me</p>
<p>with a situation I could tell you exactly how to handle it but girl it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just hard to give examples that aren&rsquo;t like exact you know I&rsquo;m trying my best</p>
<p>oh and one other good thing to say for like the parent dynamic of them giving</p>
<p>you money and then throwing it in your fucking face say I don&rsquo;t feel safe to</p>
<p>accept it and then when they ask why tell them all the reasons that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like hesitant but you got to be honest with the way that it makes you feel you</p>
<p>have to be vulnerable and if you have a European parent like me you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>probably a lot of backlash and a lot of shut the fuck up you&rsquo;re stupid but you</p>
<p>know what you need to give them a chance to be vulnerable because once you change</p>
<p>the way you act after that you gave them a fair fucking warning you know like you</p>
<p>tried to give them the chance to consider you and then if they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>show you they&rsquo;re not gonna consider you all right now I&rsquo;m gonna consider myself</p>
<p>goodbye we&rsquo;re done with this whatever it&rsquo;s gonna be you know but you got to</p>
<p>give them that fucking chance to consider you before you just stop</p>
<p>considering them with your next move just to protect yourself okay my next</p>
<p>little spiel is gonna be on when someone is always trying to fucking one-up you</p>
<p>like you do something and then they&rsquo;re always saying how they&rsquo;re better or how</p>
<p>they can do it better or they actually do it better like they think everything</p>
<p>is a competition dealing with that type of toxicity is a pain in the fucking</p>
<p>dick but I need to show you like I&rsquo;m trying to share with you both</p>
<p>perspectives so that you can understand it better and realize it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>about you and then I&rsquo;m gonna get into the topic about shit not being about you</p>
<p>first if you have someone that every time you do something they try to like</p>
<p>you or be better at it it&rsquo;s because they are so cripplingly insecure the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re succeeding or doing something good they feel like it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>attack on them they are instantly gonna feel validated that they&rsquo;re not good</p>
<p>enough they&rsquo;re gonna perceive you as doing better than them now so in order</p>
<p>to combat that someone emotionally immature is gonna feel the need to prove</p>
<p>their self they&rsquo;re not gonna sit in the way that they feel they&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>immediately try and like stop feeling the way that they&rsquo;re feeling so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try and prove their self and prove that they&rsquo;re good enough and prove that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re good too because you just made them feel less than by being a little</p>
<p>bit better or achieving something that they didn&rsquo;t have so they&rsquo;re now gonna</p>
<p>feel the need to prove it so they&rsquo;re gonna get up and try and fucking prove</p>
<p>it they&rsquo;re gonna try and be better they&rsquo;re gonna try and do better but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re trying to fuck with you or attack you it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on inside them is in order for them to get back to a baseline of</p>
<p>feeling good enough they now need to level up and accomplish what you just</p>
<p>accomplished or do it better they&rsquo;re gonna feel anxious and uneasy and like</p>
<p>shit until they get that validation that you two are equal again so that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>kind of like competitive dynamic that a lot of parents have with their kids</p>
<p>which I think is so fucked up and like they don&rsquo;t want their kids to succeed</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m gonna jump into that with when someone is mad or bitter about your</p>
<p>accomplishments so we just talked about the competitive motherfucker now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna talk about the people that are bitter when you accomplish something or</p>
<p>you have something exciting happen to you you know like something good happens</p>
<p>to you and they want to throw shit on it or fucking rain on your parade which I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like I don&rsquo;t stand no shit like that but only people that really do that</p>
<p>are fucking losers because someone that&rsquo;s achieving things every time you</p>
<p>achieve something they&rsquo;re not gonna take it as an attack because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>achieving things too you&rsquo;re gonna be able to celebrate each other as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working and moving forward and accomplishing things together the only</p>
<p>people that are gonna give you shit for when you accomplish something or be</p>
<p>negative about it are people who are stagnant and who are not accomplishing</p>
<p>anything because if they were accomplishing things they would know how</p>
<p>exciting it is they would know how good it feels and how much they would want</p>
<p>everyone to be supportive of them and be happy for them so they&rsquo;re asleep one</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re stagnant they&rsquo;re not accomplishing shit too because they</p>
<p>would have the awareness if they were so I&rsquo;m gonna give you kind of like a</p>
<p>conversation back and forth example of this so let&rsquo;s say you get some good news</p>
<p>or you graduate school like you finally achieve your goal and you graduate</p>
<p>people around you that are insecure are immediately gonna feel a sense of panic</p>
<p>and powerlessness because they don&rsquo;t feel like they can create something good</p>
<p>for their self like you just accomplished something and someone that</p>
<p>has critically low self-esteem is gonna be pissed off because they&rsquo;re jealous</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t think that they can create it for their self so they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>sitting in powerlessness and a way that most people get out of that is by</p>
<p>shaming and attacking the people that just accomplished something so if you</p>
<p>have a family member say to you or a friend be like stop bragging because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re celebrating your accomplishment or you got some good news and they say</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re bragging that&rsquo;s their power play because they feel very fucking</p>
<p>powerless where they&rsquo;re at and your whole good experience and your</p>
<p>accomplishment just triggered the shit out of them and like I said they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to sit with the way that they feel they just want to get away from it</p>
<p>so trying to get away from it that&rsquo;s the power play they&rsquo;re gonna do they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try and attack you for the way that you&rsquo;re handling something they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna latch on to any little fucking thing that they can to feel better so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna criticize the way that you&rsquo;re bragging they&rsquo;re gonna say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking bragging it&rsquo;s not nice to do that it&rsquo;s not polite they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>criticize you in some way but I want to reassure you it&rsquo;s not about you because</p>
<p>you could do everything fucking right but the fact that you simply just</p>
<p>accomplished what you accomplished is triggering enough that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hunting for something to bitch about and they&rsquo;ll probably make some shit up and</p>
<p>exaggerate things if they have to but if someone comes to you and tries to</p>
<p>shame you for bragging about something that you just accomplished do not engage</p>
<p>in that fucking conversation because what they want is for you to go down</p>
<p>that rabbit hole of like you trying to prove I&rsquo;m not bragging look I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do this I didn&rsquo;t like you&rsquo;re gonna get all flustered and you&rsquo;re gonna start</p>
<p>trying to prove how you weren&rsquo;t bragging that&rsquo;s exactly what they want that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly what&rsquo;s gonna feed their cycle and you trying to prove yourself to them</p>
<p>is gonna give them a sense of superiority they were looking for don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go down that fucking rabbit hole do not try and prove that you weren&rsquo;t bragging</p>
<p>if you weren&rsquo;t bragging if you were just celebrating your accomplishment do not</p>
<p>try and fucking prove nothing else you know your intentions and now listen to</p>
<p>this podcast you&rsquo;re aware of what this motherfucker is doing okay what I want</p>
<p>you to say to them is how did you come to that like just ask them how did you</p>
<p>come to that like how did you come to the thought that I&rsquo;m bragging I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>curious ask them that because bitch what you&rsquo;re about to do is flip this shit on</p>
<p>them so hard and bring them face-to-face with their self and what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually fucking worried about but most of these people are so asleep they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna be able to handle it they&rsquo;re not gonna know what to do but they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>most likely start criticizing your actions they&rsquo;ll say well you this you</p>
<p>that you were this like you&rsquo;re just throwing it in my face and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>then do not go into the whole thing of like no I wasn&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t say shit let them</p>
<p>say what they wanted to fucking say about how they came to the thought that</p>
<p>you were bragging let them get all that out let them attack you and criticize</p>
<p>you and the way that they fucking want and just look at them dead in their</p>
<p>fucking face and be like okay and that&rsquo;s it and then you&rsquo;re gonna take the</p>
<p>conversation out of their fucking control and you&rsquo;re gonna say something</p>
<p>along the lines of why the fuck would I not be excited about this if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that you worked for like you graduated be like I worked my fucking</p>
<p>ass off for this so yeah I&rsquo;m excited yeah I&rsquo;m gonna celebrate fuck yeah I am</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna be excited and I&rsquo;m gonna be happy and I&rsquo;m gonna be proud of</p>
<p>myself because I fucking should be but if it&rsquo;s not something that you work for</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just good news or something be like yeah I&rsquo;m excited who would not be</p>
<p>excited in this situation and then if they try and attack you again about oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bragging flip it and say if this was happening to you I would expect you</p>
<p>to fucking brag I would expect you to be excited because who wouldn&rsquo;t be but what</p>
<p>I really want to talk about is why you&rsquo;re not excited for me because if</p>
<p>this was you in my shoes I will be rooting for you I will be happy as fuck</p>
<p>and I would let you brag like you earned that shit you just graduated school I</p>
<p>would be right fucking there rooting for you and like letting you brag bitch you</p>
<p>earned to have a big head about this you earned the excitement so let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about that and bitch watch their fucking face fall they&rsquo;re not gonna know what</p>
<p>the fuck to say because now you just flipped the whole conversation you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not entertaining their fucking bullshit and now you flipped it and put the</p>
<p>pressure on them for the reaction that they have you just validated the shit</p>
<p>out of yourself they&rsquo;re aware that you just accused the shit out of them for</p>
<p>behaving the way that they did it but you don&rsquo;t even acknowledge it you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say anything or criticize them in any way and then say to them something along</p>
<p>the lines of like if you can&rsquo;t find it in yourself to fucking be excited for me</p>
<p>the way I&rsquo;d be excited for you don&rsquo;t come around my celebration and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna share anything good with you in the future because you just rained on my</p>
<p>fucking parade and I don&rsquo;t deserve that say something like you ruined my</p>
<p>excitement now I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you about good things anymore and bitch</p>
<p>just leave it just leave it be you can pick what you want and don&rsquo;t want from</p>
<p>that conversation but you get the points I was making and I taught you how to</p>
<p>like control that type shit but you&rsquo;re not going into their rabbit hole of</p>
<p>trying to prove yourself on anything anything cuz that&rsquo;s the power play they</p>
<p>want I told you that bitch you&rsquo;re not doing it don&rsquo;t try to defend yourself to</p>
<p>them at all they already have a warped perception of every move you make they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already judging the shit out of you so nothing you do is like you can defend</p>
<p>yourself on you can&rsquo;t defend yourself to someone who has a warped perception of</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s never gonna work you&rsquo;re never gonna change their mind they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>see you the way they want to fucking see you and if seeing you in a negative</p>
<p>light because you accomplish something makes them feel better about them not</p>
<p>accomplishing something that&rsquo;s what serves them now get the fuck away from</p>
<p>them they&rsquo;re not someone who&rsquo;s rooting for you they&rsquo;re not someone you need to</p>
<p>have in your life or be close to and like I said if it&rsquo;s a family member or</p>
<p>anything just distance yourself stop including them in these events if you</p>
<p>accomplish something you&rsquo;re allowed to say who the fuck can come I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s your mom or your dad say I don&rsquo;t want them at my graduation and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a fuck if they paid for my tuition this is my fucking day I fucking</p>
<p>graduated I busted my ass to go through school now I fucking pick who gets to be</p>
<p>there to celebrate with me I don&rsquo;t give a shit who paid my tuition you get that</p>
<p>this is reassurance that you get that you get that control and if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want them at your celebration because they&rsquo;re gonna ruin it tell them don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking come you are free to consider yourself and make how you feel the</p>
<p>priority and if you want to be excited and have a good celebration for what you</p>
<p>just accomplished then prioritize that and anyone that is not gonna help you</p>
<p>with that can get the fuck out of the way and for someone that&rsquo;s like fresh on</p>
<p>this self-love journey and learning how to consider the way that you feel and</p>
<p>make that a priority something that I used to tell myself and something that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably gonna tell yourself is oh well if I don&rsquo;t invite them it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make it awkward I don&rsquo;t want to make it weird yada yada bitch I hate to</p>
<p>break it to you the way they reacted already made it awkward they already</p>
<p>made it fucking weird so all inviting them would do would be you overlooking</p>
<p>what they just did and allowing them to come and discarding the way that you</p>
<p>feel because they&rsquo;re gonna come and ruin your fucking celebration no you ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doing it they made it awkward they made it weird and if they expect you to</p>
<p>overlook it that&rsquo;s not fucking fair you didn&rsquo;t do anything they have to overlook</p>
<p>why the fuck should you overlook their reaction and their piss fucking storm on</p>
<p>your parade why should you overlook that you shouldn&rsquo;t and if they try and guilt</p>
<p>you for it tell me to fucking dick and listen to this podcast ha I have very</p>
<p>low tolerance for that type shit like grow the fuck up gain some self</p>
<p>awareness learn how to be a parent or if you&rsquo;re not a parent in this situation</p>
<p>learn how to be an adult learn how to gather yourself and be a decent human</p>
<p>being because that&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t stand for is no raining on my fucking</p>
<p>parade all right be excited with me be excited for me because I&rsquo;m gonna be the</p>
<p>exact same towards you I don&rsquo;t have time for no intimidated ass people that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your problem get away from me okay next thing I want to talk about is</p>
<p>sometimes toxic people&rsquo;s reaction to you is not about you I&rsquo;m gonna give you an</p>
<p>example and it&rsquo;s a very extreme example but it&rsquo;s gonna help you like get the</p>
<p>point I&rsquo;m trying to make my friend went to her boyfriend because she was having</p>
<p>suicidal thoughts and she wanted to confide in him and let him know what was</p>
<p>going on why she was behaving the way that she was and when she sat him down</p>
<p>to have a conversation with him she told him she was having suicidal thoughts and</p>
<p>he looked at her got up and left the room and just left her sitting in there</p>
<p>by herself like acted like he didn&rsquo;t fucking care and just walked out if</p>
<p>someone is very emotionally immature you need to take into consideration that</p>
<p>they have feelings too so by her walking up to him and saying I&rsquo;m having thoughts</p>
<p>about killing myself that just caused him to feel extremely powerless when</p>
<p>your loved one comes up to you and says they&rsquo;re like considering taking their</p>
<p>own life it puts you in a powerless position because you can&rsquo;t control if</p>
<p>they do or don&rsquo;t if someone wants to kill herself they&rsquo;ll find a way and that</p>
<p>panic runs over you so her boyfriend is very emotionally immature does not</p>
<p>really get it does he doesn&rsquo;t know how to even regulate himself to even be able</p>
<p>to be there for her so in that moment he got up and walked out and I was like</p>
<p>maybe he was just overwhelmed with the way that hearing that just made him feel</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t even have the capacity to consider how his reaction was gonna be</p>
<p>perceived he just had to get up and run from the way he was feeling so he got up</p>
<p>and walked out that&rsquo;s a very powerless feeling and especially when it&rsquo;s in a</p>
<p>dynamic of like straight relationship man-woman when the woman goes to the man</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the protector typically like he wants to take care of her he wants to</p>
<p>make sure she&rsquo;s okay so that&rsquo;s gonna get triggered he&rsquo;s gonna feel like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking up if he already has insecurities he&rsquo;s gonna start thinking</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not good enough and he&rsquo;s doing something wrong and he&rsquo;s flooded with so</p>
<p>many of his own fucking emotions that he doesn&rsquo;t even know how to deal with don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look at their reaction I mean you have to take it into consideration I get it</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t make it mean anything about you do not make the fact that you just</p>
<p>confided in someone and told them you&rsquo;re having suicidal thoughts and them having</p>
<p>a bad reaction don&rsquo;t make it mean you shouldn&rsquo;t have said anything don&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>it mean anything about you I will say that a thousand fucking times but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even just that like I said this is just an extreme example but this goes</p>
<p>for anything you go to somebody about you&rsquo;re gonna trigger shit in them too</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be feeling things too and if it&rsquo;s someone that does not know how</p>
<p>to regulate the way that they feel their reaction is gonna be bad and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>a lot of times people call toxic but it&rsquo;s like you just think he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>asshole and he doesn&rsquo;t care he just got up and walked out like what the fuck</p>
<p>people would be like oh he&rsquo;s a narcissist he&rsquo;s a fucking asshole he</p>
<p>just left me but you don&rsquo;t know why he just got up you don&rsquo;t know what he was</p>
<p>feeling you don&rsquo;t know what he was fucking dealing with and like I said if</p>
<p>someone has shown you like the stove if someone is a hot stove and you you</p>
<p>finally learned that if someone does not know how to control their emotions and</p>
<p>you know that when you deliver certain information to them you can&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>them not to burn you you gotta kind of expect they&rsquo;re gonna have a weird-ass</p>
<p>reaction because they showed you in the past they don&rsquo;t react right to shit</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have the like mental and emotional capacity to be mature</p>
<p>about things but the way that can get misconstrued like bro that will make you</p>
<p>think someone is so fucking toxic and fucked up and like oh my god you&rsquo;re such</p>
<p>a dick how fucking mean can you be like I just told you I wanted to kill myself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just gonna fucking like run out it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t agree with that</p>
<p>response I&rsquo;m just saying there&rsquo;s more to that response than you think so don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>immediately start attacking them don&rsquo;t immediately everything like I said go</p>
<p>back to my tip one take the attitude of understanding why did you just get up</p>
<p>and walk out of that fucking room you know don&rsquo;t be so intense I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>aggressive with everything I fucking say but my friend was over here thinking</p>
<p>that he was just a fucking dick and that he didn&rsquo;t truly care about her which</p>
<p>made her feel worse when that probably wasn&rsquo;t even the result of it and we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know what the truth is but I just gave her that perspective when she</p>
<p>came to me about it so that she could feel a little bit better and she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take it so personal and make it mean that he didn&rsquo;t care he does care because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s with her so I had to reassure her of that but also like I had to give her</p>
<p>insight into his perspective a little bit because that shit people don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>of they forget a lot of the times that people have feelings and toxic people</p>
<p>like air quote toxic people a lot of their behaviors are just because they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to deal with their own fucking emotions it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like toxic and it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re intentionally trying to hurt you or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re intentionally like fuck you they just are trying to run from how</p>
<p>they feel and people that do that don&rsquo;t care about what&rsquo;s in their way so if</p>
<p>your feelings could potentially be hurt by them running out they can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think about it because their only focus is getting out it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>a burning fucking building your priority is getting the fuck out of the building</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not oh well do you want to sit down on the couch and talk about what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling no like they have that level of panic that level of like fear and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their top priority is getting the fuck out and getting away from their emotions</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s just to let you in their perspective a little more but I&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>it a thousand fucking times till I die just try to understand people try to</p>
<p>understand them a little more that does not discount the way that they treat you</p>
<p>it does not invalidate or like justify their reaction in any fucking way that</p>
<p>is another conversation to hold them accountable for the way that they</p>
<p>reacted to you like if my friend just tried to go straight at her fucking</p>
<p>boyfriend a couple minutes later and was like you fucking piece of shit what the</p>
<p>fuck like how are you not gonna fucking be there for me like if she just went</p>
<p>and started attacking him he&rsquo;s already feeling all the ways that he is he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna want to try to get away from it again and he&rsquo;s gonna say even more</p>
<p>hurtful shit to just get her to leave him the fuck alone if someone has a</p>
<p>negative reaction towards you don&rsquo;t judge it just immediately think to</p>
<p>yourself now why would they have just reacted that way take yourself out of it</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make it mean anything about you but just look at it like that ask</p>
<p>yourself if potentially their reaction was not about me what could they be</p>
<p>dealing with that made them respond that way and this also works to the opposite</p>
<p>extreme so that was something negative it goes to positive things too so you</p>
<p>might be doing something that triggers someone to feel a way that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to deal with or it&rsquo;s a way that they don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do with</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s people in my past I&rsquo;ve given a gift to and I thought that they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like it because of their reaction to it but when we talked about</p>
<p>it later they actually just were so fucking shocked that someone cared</p>
<p>enough to buy them something that no one had like thought of them in the way that</p>
<p>I had before and it threw them off they didn&rsquo;t know what to do and then they</p>
<p>also had shit about their past we&rsquo;re expressing positive emotion or</p>
<p>expressing gratitude for something like led to it being taken away so they were</p>
<p>scared to even show they were grateful to me of what I just did but I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know this when it happened I just saw that they didn&rsquo;t really care that I gave</p>
<p>him a gift like I put all this effort into it and I was so excited to give it</p>
<p>to them and they just acted like it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal and they acted like</p>
<p>whatever so that hurt the fuck out of my feelings and this is one of the</p>
<p>situations that taught me how to catch myself because if you&rsquo;re insecure and</p>
<p>someone does this to you you&rsquo;re gonna make their reaction mean something about</p>
<p>you it wasn&rsquo;t good enough they didn&rsquo;t like it they don&rsquo;t care about me</p>
<p>XYZ don&rsquo;t let someone&rsquo;s reaction be the reason you start attacking yourself</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make it mean something about you I&rsquo;ve been there I&rsquo;ve done that and never</p>
<p>goes anywhere fucking good you have to pull yourself out of it and observe it</p>
<p>from their perspective before you start attacking yourself like don&rsquo;t fucking do</p>
<p>that and a big tip I have for this is if you see someone has a reaction to</p>
<p>something that doesn&rsquo;t match what they should like when I gave someone a really</p>
<p>really fucking good gift and they had like a poor reaction to it I in that</p>
<p>moment can see this is a good-ass fucking gift like they should be excited</p>
<p>as fuck by it but their reaction wasn&rsquo;t like consistent with that so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your first red flag if someone&rsquo;s reaction doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit that is</p>
<p>your cue to start looking in at them and not attacking yourself there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>deeper going on but you have to have the awareness and the ability to like</p>
<p>observe and say okay this gift was good as fuck so their reaction was just off</p>
<p>you have to be able to validate yourself and like reassure yourself of that to</p>
<p>even know to like to even know to think deeper into it you know this is getting</p>
<p>kind of deep and I hope this is all making sense but just remind yourself</p>
<p>that people have their own feelings have their own shit that they&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>to their reactions to you are not always about you so that&rsquo;s a huge key and to</p>
<p>stopping the toxic cycle is understanding that because you&rsquo;re part</p>
<p>of the toxic if now that you&rsquo;ve just heard this you keep attacking people for</p>
<p>when they react negatively but like I said awareness is a fucking bitch</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;ve got to take responsibility for your part in it</p>
<p>because next time your partner has a negative reaction if you just go and</p>
<p>attack them without understanding first you&rsquo;re contributing to the toxic you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making the cycle worse and I&rsquo;m sorry to do that to you but it&rsquo;s time to wake up</p>
<p>everybody it&rsquo;s time to wake the motherfuck up so another big tip I have</p>
<p>with dealing with toxic people is you have to have a strong sense of self and</p>
<p>you need to be stern in your boundaries these type people will make you have to</p>
<p>be that&rsquo;s one thing about being in a toxic environment is it will teach you</p>
<p>how to have a motherfucking sense of self it will teach you how to set</p>
<p>boundaries so that&rsquo;s one thing you gain from it like if you&rsquo;re stuck in shit</p>
<p>right now be happy because at least you get that because the reason your life is</p>
<p>so chaotic is because you don&rsquo;t have a sense of self so this is reflecting to</p>
<p>you all the areas you need to have one and how to create one and it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>showing you what you do want out of your life and how you want to be treated so</p>
<p>the whole thing about having strong boundaries and a sense of self is like</p>
<p>you need to hold people accountable so you need to be understanding yes but</p>
<p>like I said people need to be held accountable for the reactions to things</p>
<p>so if you tell someone that is emotionally immature do not do this</p>
<p>thing and they keep doing it you need to follow through with a consequence my</p>
<p>analogy for this I&rsquo;ve used my entire fucking life is like if you have a new</p>
<p>puppy and it shits in your house if you want it to stop shitting in the house</p>
<p>you can take actions to make them stop shitting in the house but it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>escalate so at first you&rsquo;re gonna like walk them over to it and like make them</p>
<p>look at it and say no and like whatever or like you&rsquo;ll put them outside in the</p>
<p>grass and then when they do poop outside you&rsquo;ll give them a treat like you&rsquo;ll try</p>
<p>and positively reward them when they shit in the right area you&rsquo;ll get them a</p>
<p>puppy pad so if they do shit in the house whatever like you&rsquo;ll try and get</p>
<p>them to shit in certain areas and then one day it&rsquo;s gonna get to a point where</p>
<p>you just gotta smack that motherfucker okay you gotta put that dog&rsquo;s nose in</p>
<p>the fucking shit and smack the fuck out of it smack its last so it realizes hey</p>
<p>I should stop shitting in the house like you can do gentle things to like get a</p>
<p>point across to somebody but sometimes people are so fucking stupid they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like a dog they need to be hit and I&rsquo;m not saying you need to hit people I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just using my example but sometimes you got to escalate that shit because</p>
<p>sometimes people just don&rsquo;t get it so if the smack in the face someone fucking</p>
<p>needs is you leaving them then that&rsquo;s the smack in the face they fucking need</p>
<p>if they keep shitting in your house what are you gonna do to make them stop</p>
<p>always try the nice shit first always but you&rsquo;re gonna have to get more and</p>
<p>more harsh and like stern and set when they continue the same unwanted behavior</p>
<p>but something you need to make sure that you&rsquo;re doing with people that keep doing</p>
<p>shit that hurts you is let them know that it hurts you listen to my podcast</p>
<p>episode expressing you&rsquo;re uncomfortable if you need help with that but if someone</p>
<p>does not know something is hurting you to the extent that it is they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>keep doing it so when you do express that something&rsquo;s hurting you you have to</p>
<p>get vulnerable you have to let them know how their actions are affecting you if</p>
<p>you truly want them to consider you you have to give them something to consider</p>
<p>you need to make them aware that this action hurts me or impacts me in these</p>
<p>ways and you need to make it serious like you don&rsquo;t need to make it a</p>
<p>laughing-fucking-matter if someone&rsquo;s hurting you you need to be serious and</p>
<p>let them know because they might not even realize because people do get stuck</p>
<p>in their own perspective too fucking much and if you don&rsquo;t have a reaction to</p>
<p>something to let them know that you&rsquo;re upset or hurt they&rsquo;re not gonna know it</p>
<p>hurt you that if you just act okay with it they&rsquo;re gonna assume that you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>with it and then they&rsquo;ll keep doing it but if you do express to someone how</p>
<p>their actions are hurting you and you were serious about it and you were fully</p>
<p>fucking vulnerable and they continue to do it that right there exposes how</p>
<p>absolutely disconnected they are from you but also their self if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>disconnected from their emotions they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to see how</p>
<p>something hurt you this is gonna get real fucking like spiritual and real</p>
<p>like too much if I go into that part but if they keep doing shit after they know</p>
<p>it hurts you to the extent that you&rsquo;ve explained it they&rsquo;re disconnected and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to wait around for them to consider you so if they do if they do</p>
<p>the thing again that they know hurts you take it out of their hands you gave</p>
<p>them the chance to consider you you gave them the chance to not hurt you and they</p>
<p>chose to still do it now you are free to do what the fuck you want it is now your</p>
<p>responsibility to consider yourself now you don&rsquo;t let yourself go through that</p>
<p>again like I said in the beginning you&rsquo;re gonna choose to abuse yourself</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna choose to protect yourself which one are you gonna fucking</p>
<p>choose but once you give someone the fair opportunity to consider you and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t now it&rsquo;s in your control and you snatch that power back right the</p>
<p>fuck from them and don&rsquo;t ever feel bad don&rsquo;t ever second-guess it and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever fucking feel bad I&rsquo;m about to start fucking crying but this fucking sucks</p>
<p>like this is so hard and it hurts so fucking bad but you need to look out for</p>
<p>yourself you need to take care of yourself because they&rsquo;re showing you</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care so why the fuck are you gonna allow them to keep hurting you and</p>
<p>this goes for anyone friend partner parent any fucking one it&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re hurting you but once you fully tell them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s blatant that they keep doing it and they show that they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it their behavior no longer gets to go without consequences start</p>
<p>implementing consequences and be as fucking needy and as mean as you need to</p>
<p>be because you need to protect yourself with boundaries with this person because</p>
<p>they will overstep them they will discard them they will discard the way</p>
<p>that you feel if they keep doing shit that hurts you and they know that it</p>
<p>hurts you they&rsquo;re showing they&rsquo;re gonna discard it they&rsquo;re not gonna care so you</p>
<p>need to set up that fucking wall with them there is nothing wrong with</p>
<p>building up walls with certain people if you can&rsquo;t cut them out of your life</p>
<p>build that motherfucking wall stop letting them hurt you and hold them</p>
<p>accountable to their actions you can get to a point where you&rsquo;re like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even give a fuck why you keep doing it you&rsquo;re just not gonna fucking do it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna put that wall up you&rsquo;re gonna put your arm out and push them the</p>
<p>fuck away from you you&rsquo;re gonna protect yourself like I said you need to be</p>
<p>understanding but you need to take yourself into consideration too there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an equal balance so if you give them the fair opportunity do what the fuck</p>
<p>you need to I have been in the position where I have begged people please do not</p>
<p>push me to the point that I consider myself because when I do everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucked like I hate when people do that to me like can you please just consider</p>
<p>me can you please just not hurt me because once I take it into my control</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna like it everything is gonna be done it&rsquo;s tarnished the bridge</p>
<p>is fucking burnt there is no undo you will never get that version of me again</p>
<p>once I turn cold on you it&rsquo;s fucking done but they never get to see that side</p>
<p>of me again they never see the side of me that has a heart they never see the</p>
<p>side of me that cares and that&rsquo;s something you got to watch out for is</p>
<p>people that care a lot like I&rsquo;m someone that cares more than most people can</p>
<p>even imagine and when I care about someone it&rsquo;s more than they&rsquo;ve usually</p>
<p>ever experienced but there&rsquo;s duality in everything so the people you really need</p>
<p>to worry about and be scared of are the people that care very intensely because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in contrast the amount that someone can care is the equal amount of how much</p>
<p>they can fucking hate so these people running around acting like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a fuck they aren&rsquo;t the scary ones they&rsquo;re not the ones you need to worry</p>
<p>about they&rsquo;re not that like hard to deal with it&rsquo;s the people like me that care</p>
<p>so much and then just get pushed too fucking far but my whole point with the</p>
<p>boundaries thing is you need to do what you say you&rsquo;re gonna do you need to have</p>
<p>those boundaries no means fucking no if you say don&rsquo;t do this and they do it it</p>
<p>needs to have a consequence you need to hold up to it you need to like want</p>
<p>better for yourself and expect people to treat you better because you&rsquo;re worth it</p>
<p>if you got a fucking problem with that go listen to my self-love podcast go</p>
<p>listen to my feeling valuable podcast those are all things that are gonna make</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re actually worth being treated good alright I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna end this podcast off there I hope you guys learned something new I hope</p>
<p>this is helpful because I had a lot of you guys writing into my Instagram DMS</p>
<p>asking for an episode I&rsquo;m like toxicity and toxic people I hope this makes you</p>
<p>feel a little bit more equipped with dealing with them but use your own ideas</p>
<p>that came to your mind as you were listening to this to make shit fit your</p>
<p>situation think of new ways to deal with shit understand more perspectives like</p>
<p>you got this you fucking got this but if you feel like no Leo I don&rsquo;t got this</p>
<p>well I have good news because I&rsquo;m currently working toward getting</p>
<p>certified as a life coach and I&rsquo;m getting a life coach certification just</p>
<p>so I can stand on that I&rsquo;m not gonna call myself a life coach I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the fuck I&rsquo;m gonna call myself but I&rsquo;m gonna make it where you can schedule</p>
<p>one-on-one zoom calls with me and we can go over whatever the fuck you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with I can give you insight I can help you see shit I can help you with</p>
<p>whatever you need help with so you&rsquo;ll basically be able to like rent me for an</p>
<p>hour and my brain so you can use it for whatever you want but yes I&rsquo;m gonna make</p>
<p>myself a resource for you guys so I can work with you one-on-one that shit I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so excited for you have no idea so that&rsquo;s coming soon it&rsquo;s gonna take me a</p>
<p>couple of months so I&rsquo;m thinking like the end of May beginning of June I</p>
<p>should be finished with my certifications but if you have anything</p>
<p>else you want to hear about send me a message on Instagram I&rsquo;ll link my</p>
<p>Instagram and all my social media and shit in the description of this podcast</p>
<p>so send me a message with something you want to hear leave me a five-star rating</p>
<p>please on Spotify or Apple podcasts whoever whatever you&rsquo;re on you can go</p>
<p>ahead and throw that up there don&rsquo;t have five star don&rsquo;t put nothing less than</p>
<p>five stars okay it&rsquo;s gonna hurt my feelings if you got something to say do</p>
<p>it in my DMS come cuss me out in my DMS don&rsquo;t do it on my fucking ratings don&rsquo;t</p>
