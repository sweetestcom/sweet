    <p>The following is a conversation with Francis Collins, director of the NIH, the National</p>
<p>Institutes of Health, appointed and reappointed to the role by three presidents, Obama, Trump,</p>
<p>and Biden. He oversees 27 separate institutes and centers, including NIAID, which makes</p>
<p>him Anthony Fauci&rsquo;s boss. At the NIH, Francis helped launch and led a huge number of projects</p>
<p>that pushed the frontiers of science, health, and medicine, including one of my favorites,</p>
<p>the BRAIN Initiative, that seeks to map the human brain and understand how the function</p>
<p>arises from the neural circuitry. Before the NIH, Francis led the Human Genome Project,</p>
<p>one of the largest and most ambitious efforts in the history of science. Given all that,</p>
<p>Francis is a humble, thoughtful, kind man, and because of this, to me, he&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>best representatives of science in the world. He is a man of God, and yet, also a friend</p>
<p>of the late Christopher Hitchens, who called him, quote, one of the greatest living Americans.</p>
<p>This is a Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Francis Collins.</p>
<p>Science at its best is a source of hope. So for me, it&rsquo;s been difficult to watch, as it</p>
<p>has during the pandemic, become at times a source of division. What I would love to do</p>
<p>in this conversation with you is touch some difficult topics, and do so with empathy and</p>
<p>humility so that we may begin to regain a sense of trust in science, and that it may</p>
<p>once again become a source of hope. I hope that&rsquo;s okay with you.</p>
<p>I love the goal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some hard questions. You called for, quote, thorough, expert driven,</p>
<p>and objective inquiry into the origins of COVID 19. So let me ask, is there a reasonable</p>
<p>chance that COVID 19 leaked from a lab?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t exclude that. I think it&rsquo;s fairly unlikely. I wish we had more ability to be</p>
<p>able to ask questions of the Chinese government and learn more about what kind of records</p>
<p>might have been in the lab that we&rsquo;ve never been able to see. But most likely, this was</p>
<p>a natural origin of a virus, probably starting in a bat, perhaps traveling through some other</p>
<p>intermediate, yet to be identified host, and finding its way into humans.</p>
<p>Is answering this question within the realm of science, do you think, will we ever know?</p>
<p>I think we might know if we find that intermediate host. And there has not yet been a thorough</p>
<p>enough investigation to say that that&rsquo;s not going to happen. And remember, it takes a</p>
<p>while to do this. With SARS, it was 14 years before we figured out it was the civet cat</p>
<p>that was the intermediate host. With MERS, it was a little quicker to discover it was</p>
<p>the camel. With SARS COVID 2, there&rsquo;s been some looking, but especially now with everything</p>
<p>really tense between the US and China, if there&rsquo;s looking going on, we&rsquo;re not getting</p>
<p>told about it.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a scientific question or a political question?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scientific question, but it has political implications.</p>
<p>So the world is full of scientists that are working together, but in the political space,</p>
<p>in the political science space, there&rsquo;s tensions. What is it like to do great science in a time</p>
<p>of a pandemic when there&rsquo;s political tensions?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unfortunate. Pasteur said science knows no one country. He was right about that.</p>
<p>My whole career in genetics, especially, has depended upon international collaboration between</p>
<p>scientists as a way to make discoveries, get things done. Scientists, by their nature,</p>
<p>like to be involved in international collaborations. The Human Genome Project, for heaven&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>2,400 scientists in six countries working together, not worrying who is going to get</p>
<p>the credit, giving all the data away. I was the person who was supposed to keep all that</p>
<p>coordinated. It was a wonderful experience, and that included China. That was sort of</p>
<p>their first real entry into a big international, big science kind of project, and they did</p>
<p>their part. It&rsquo;s very different now.</p>
<p>Continuing the line of difficult questions, especially difficult ethical questions. In</p>
<p>2014, U.S. put a hold on gain of function research in response to a number of laboratory</p>
<p>biosecurity incidents, including anthrax, smallpox, and influenza. In December 2017,</p>
<p>NIH lifted this ban because, quote, gain of function research is important in helping</p>
<p>us identify, understand, and develop strategies and effective countermeasures against rapidly</p>
<p>evolving pathogens that pose a threat to public health. All difficult questions have arguments</p>
<p>on both sides. Can you argue the pros and cons of gain of function research with viruses?</p>
<p>I can, and first let me say this term, gain of function, is causing such confusion that</p>
<p>I need to take a minute and just sort of talk about what the common scientific use of that</p>
<p>term is and where it is very different when we&rsquo;re talking about the current oversight</p>
<p>of potentially dangerous human pathogens. As you know, in science, we&rsquo;re doing gain</p>
<p>of function experiments all the time. We support a lot of cancer immunotherapy at NIH. Right</p>
<p>here in our clinical center, there are trials going on where people&rsquo;s immune cells are taken</p>
<p>out of their body, treated with a genetic therapy that revs up their ability to discover</p>
<p>the cancer that that patient currently has, maybe even at stage four, and then give them</p>
<p>back as those little ninja warriors go after the cancer. It sometimes works dramatically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gain of function. You gave that patient a gain in their immune function that may have</p>
<p>saved their life. We&rsquo;ve got to be careful not to say, oh, gain of function is bad. Most</p>
<p>of what we do in science that&rsquo;s good involves quite a bit of that. We are all living with</p>
<p>gains of function every day. I have a gain of function because I&rsquo;m wearing these eyeglasses.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would not be seeing you as clearly. I&rsquo;m happy for that gain of function. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where a lot of confusion has happened. The kind of gain of function which is now subject</p>
<p>to very rigorous and very carefully defined oversight is when you are working with an</p>
<p>established human pathogen that is known to be potentially causing a pandemic and you</p>
<p>are enhancing or potentially enhancing its transmissibility or its virulence. We call</p>
<p>that EPPP, enhanced potential pandemic pathogen. That requires this very stringent oversight</p>
<p>worked out over three years by the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity that</p>
<p>needs to be looked at by a panel that goes well beyond NIH to decide are the benefits</p>
<p>worth the risks in that situation. Most of the time, it&rsquo;s not worth the risk. Only three</p>
<p>times in the last three or four years have experiments been given permission to go forward.</p>
<p>They were all on influenza. So I will argue that if you&rsquo;re worried about the next pandemic,</p>
<p>the more you know about the coming enemy, the better chance you have to recognize when</p>
<p>trouble is starting. And so if you can do it safely, studying influenza or coronaviruses</p>
<p>like SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV2 would be a good thing to be able to know about. But you</p>
<p>have to be able to do it safely because we all know lab accidents can happen. I mean,</p>
<p>look at SARS where there have been lab accidents and people have gotten sick as a result. We</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to take that chance unless there&rsquo;s a compelling scientific reason. That&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>we have this very stringent oversight. The experiments being done at the Wuhan Institute</p>
<p>of Virology as a subaward to our grant to EcoHealth in New York did not meet that standard</p>
<p>of requiring that kind of stringent oversight. I want to be really clear about that because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been so much thrown around about it. Was it gain of function? Well, in the standard</p>
<p>use of that term that you would use in science in general, you might say it was. But in the</p>
<p>use of that term that applies to this very specific example of a potential pandemic pathogen,</p>
<p>absolutely not. So nothing went on there that should not have happened based upon the oversight.</p>
<p>There was an instance where the grantee institution failed to notify us about the result of an</p>
<p>experiment that they were supposed to tell us where they mixed and matched some viral</p>
<p>genomes and got a somewhat larger viral load as a result. But it was not EPPP. It was not</p>
<p>getting into that zone that would have required this higher level of scrutiny. It was all</p>
<p>bat viruses. These were not human pathogens.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t cross a threshold within that gray area that makes for an EPPP?</p>
<p>They did not. And anybody who&rsquo;s willing to take the time to look at what EPPP means and</p>
<p>what those experiments were would have to agree with what I just said.</p>
<p>What is the biggest reason it didn&rsquo;t cross that threshold? Is it because it wasn&rsquo;t jumping</p>
<p>to humans? Is it because it did not have a sufficient increase in virulence or transmissibility?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>EPPP only applies to agents that are known human pathogens of pandemic potential. These</p>
<p>were all bat viruses derived in the wild, not shown to be infectious to humans. Just</p>
<p>looking at what happened if you took four different bat viruses and you tried moving</p>
<p>the spike protein gene from one into one of the others to see whether it would bind better</p>
<p>to the ACE2 receptor. That doesn&rsquo;t get across that threshold.</p>
<p>And let me also say, for those who are trying to connect the dots here, which is the most</p>
<p>troubling part of this, and say, well, this is how SARS CoV2 got started. That is absolutely</p>
<p>demonstrably false. These bat viruses that were being studied had only about 80% similarity</p>
<p>in their genomes to SARS CoV2. They were like decades away in evolutionary terms. And it</p>
<p>is really irresponsible for people to claim otherwise.</p>
<p>Speaking of people who claim otherwise, Rand Paul, what do you make of the battle of words</p>
<p>between Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci over this particular point?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to talk about specific members of Congress, but I will say it&rsquo;s really unfortunate</p>
<p>that Tony Fauci, who is the epitome of a dedicated public servant, has now somehow been targeted</p>
<p>for political reasons as somebody that certain figures are trying to discredit, perhaps to</p>
<p>try to distract from their own failings. This never should have happened. Here&rsquo;s a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s dedicated his whole life to trying to prevent illnesses from infectious diseases,</p>
<p>including HIV in the 1980s and 90s, and now probably the most knowledgeable infectious</p>
<p>disease physician in the world, and also a really good communicator, is out there telling</p>
<p>the truth about where we are with SARS CoV2 to certain political figures who don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to hear it, and who are therefore determined to discredit him. And that is disgraceful.</p>
<p>So with politicians, they often play games with black and white. They try to sort of</p>
<p>use the gray areas of science and then paint their own picture. But I have a question about</p>
<p>the gray areas of science. So like you mentioned, gain of function is a term that has very specific</p>
<p>scientific meaning, but it also has a more general term. And it&rsquo;s very possible to argue</p>
<p>that the, not to argue, not the way politicians argue, but just as human beings and scientists,</p>
<p>that there was a gain of function achieved at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t cross a threshold. I mean, there&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, but it could have too. So here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing. When you do these kinds of experiments, unexpected results may be achieved. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the gray area of science. You&rsquo;re taking risks with such experiments. And I am very uncomfortable</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t discuss the uncertainty in the gray area of this.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m comfortable discussing the gray area. What I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with is people deciding</p>
<p>to define for themselves what that threshold is based on sort of some political argument.</p>
<p>The threshold was very explicitly laid out. Everybody agreed to that in the basis of this</p>
<p>three years of deliberation. So that&rsquo;s what it is. If that threshold needs to be reconsidered,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s reconsider it, but let&rsquo;s not try to take an experiment that&rsquo;s already been done</p>
<p>and decide that the threshold isn&rsquo;t what it was, because that really is doing a disservice</p>
<p>to the whole process.</p>
<p>I wish there was a discussion, even in response to Rand Paul, I know we&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>specific senators, but just that particular case, I&rsquo;m saying stuff here. I wish there</p>
<p>was an opportunity to talk about, given the current threshold, this is not gain of function.</p>
<p>But maybe we need to reconsider the threshold and have an action. That&rsquo;s an opportunity</p>
<p>for discussion about the ethics of gain of function. You said that there was three studies</p>
<p>that passed that threshold with influenza. That&rsquo;s a fascinating human question, scientific</p>
<p>question about ethics, because like you said, there&rsquo;s pros and cons. You&rsquo;re taking risks</p>
<p>here to prevent horribly destructive viruses in the future, but you also are risking creating</p>
<p>such viruses in the future. With nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, nuclear energy promises</p>
<p>a lot of positive effects, and yet you&rsquo;re taking risks here. With mutually shared destruction,</p>
<p>nations possessing nuclear weapons, a lot of people argue that nuclear weapons is the</p>
<p>reason we&rsquo;ve prevented world wars, and yet they also have the risk of starting world</p>
<p>wars. And this is what we have to be honest about with the benefits and risks of science,</p>
<p>that you have to make that calculation. What are the pros and what are the cons?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally with you, but I want to reassure you, Lex, that this is not an issue that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been ignored. That this issue about the kind of gain of function that might result in a</p>
<p>serious human pathogen has been front and center in many deliberations for a decade</p>
<p>or more, involved a lot of my time along the way, by the way, and has been discussed publicly</p>
<p>on multiple occasions, including two major meetings of the National Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>getting input from everybody and ultimately arriving at our current framework. Now, we</p>
<p>actually back in January of 2020, just before COVID 19 changed everything, had planned and</p>
<p>even charged that same National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity to reconvene and look</p>
<p>at the current framework and say, do we have it right? Let&rsquo;s look at the experience over</p>
<p>those three years and say, is the threshold too easy, too hard? Do we need to reconsider</p>
<p>it? Let&rsquo;s look at the experience. COVID came along, the members of the board said, please,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all infectious disease experts. We don&rsquo;t have time for this right now. But I think</p>
<p>the time is right to do this. I&rsquo;m totally supportive of that. And that should be just</p>
<p>as public a discussion as you can imagine about what are the benefits and the risks.</p>
<p>And if somebody decided, ultimately, this came together and said, we just shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be doing these experiments under any circumstances. If that was the conclusion, well, that would</p>
<p>be the conclusion. But it hasn&rsquo;t been so far.</p>
<p>If we can briefly look out into the next hundred years on this. I apologize for the existential</p>
<p>questions. But it seems obvious to me that as gain of function type of research and development</p>
<p>becomes easier and cheaper, it will become greater and greater risk. So if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>no longer need to be contained within laboratories of high security, it feels like this is one</p>
<p>of the greatest threats facing human civilization. Do you worry that at some point in the future</p>
<p>a leaked manmade virus may destroy most of human civilization?</p>
<p>I do worry about the risks. And at the moment where we have the greatest control, the greatest</p>
<p>oversight is when this is federally funded research. But as you&rsquo;re alluding, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no reason to imagine that&rsquo;s the only place that this kind of activity would go on. If</p>
<p>there was an evil source that wished to create a virus that was highly pathogenic in their</p>
<p>garage, the technology does get easier. And there is no international oversight about</p>
<p>this either that you could say has the same stringency as what we have in the United States.</p>
<p>So yes, that is a concern. It would take a seriously deranged group or person to undertake</p>
<p>this on purpose, given the likelihood that they too would go down. We don&rsquo;t imagine there</p>
<p>are going to be bioweapons that only kill your enemies and don&rsquo;t kill you. Sorry, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>too much alike for that to work. So I don&rsquo;t see it as an imminent risk. There&rsquo;s lots of</p>
<p>scary novels and movies written about it. But I do think it&rsquo;s something we have to consider.</p>
<p>What are all the things that ought to be watched? You may not know that if somebody is ordering</p>
<p>a particular oligonucleotide from one of the main suppliers, and it happens to match smallpox,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to get caught. So there is effort underway to try to track any nefarious actions</p>
<p>that might be going on.</p>
<p>In the United States or internationally? Is there an international collaboration of try</p>
<p>to track this stuff?</p>
<p>There is some. I wish it were stronger. This is a general issue, Lex, in terms of do we</p>
<p>have a mechanism, particularly when it comes to ethical issues, to be able to decide what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>allowable and what&rsquo;s not and enforce it. I mean, look where we are with germline genome</p>
<p>editing for humans, for instance. There is no enforcement mechanism. There&rsquo;s just bully</p>
<p>pulpits and governments that get to decide for themselves.</p>
<p>You talked about evil. What about incompetence? Does that worry you? I was born in the Soviet</p>
<p>Union. My dad, a physicist, worked at Chernobyl. That comes to mind. That wasn&rsquo;t evil. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what word you want to put it. Maybe incompetence is too harsh. Maybe it&rsquo;s the inherent incompetence</p>
<p>of bureaucracy. I don&rsquo;t know. But for whatever reason, there was an accident. Does that worry</p>
<p>you?</p>
<p>Of course it does. We know that SARS, for instance, did manage to leak out of a lab</p>
<p>in China two or three times. At least in some instances, people died, fortunately quickly</p>
<p>contained. All one can do in that circumstance, because you need to study the virus and understand</p>
<p>it in order to keep it from causing a broader pandemic, but you need to insist upon the</p>
<p>kind of biosecurity, the BSL 2, 3, and 4 framework under which those experiments have to be done.</p>
<p>Certainly at NIH, we&rsquo;re extremely rigorous about that, but you can&rsquo;t count on every human</p>
<p>being to always do exactly what they&rsquo;re supposed to. There&rsquo;s a risk there, which is another</p>
<p>reason why if we&rsquo;re contemplating supporting research on pathogens that might be the next</p>
<p>pandemic, you have to factor that in, not just whether people are going to do something</p>
<p>that we couldn&rsquo;t have predicted, where all of a sudden they created a virus that&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>worse without knowing they were going to do that, but also just having an accident. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the mix when those estimates are done about whether the risk is worth it or not.</p>
<p>Continuing on line of difficult questions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get to fun stuff after a while.</p>
<p>We will soon, I promise. You are the director of the NIH. You are Dr. Anthony Fauci&rsquo;s, technically</p>
<p>his boss.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You have stood behind him. You have supported him, just like you did already in this conversation.</p>
<p>It is painful for me to see division and distrust, but many people in politics and elsewhere</p>
<p>have called for Anthony Fauci to be fired. When there are such calls of distrust in public</p>
<p>about a leader like Anthony Fauci, who should garner trust, do you think he should be fired?</p>
<p>Probably not. To do so would be basically to give the opportunity for those who want</p>
<p>to make up stories about anybody to destroy them. There is nothing in the ways in which</p>
<p>Tony Fauci has been targeted that is based upon truth. How could we then accept those</p>
<p>cries for his firing as having legitimacy? It&rsquo;s a circular argument. They&rsquo;ve decided</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like Tony, so they make up stuff and they twist comments that he&rsquo;s made about</p>
<p>things like gain of function, where he&rsquo;s referring to the very specific gain of function that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>covered by this policy, and they&rsquo;re trying to say he lied to the Congress. That&rsquo;s simply</p>
<p>not true. They don&rsquo;t like the fact that Tony changes the medical recommendations about</p>
<p>what to do with COVID 19 over the space of more than a year. They call that flip flopping</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t trust the guy because he says one thing last year and one thing this year.</p>
<p>Well, the science has changed. Delta variant has changed everything. You don&rsquo;t want him</p>
<p>to be saying the same thing he did a year ago. That would be wrong now. It was the best</p>
<p>we could do then. People don&rsquo;t understand that or else they don&rsquo;t want to understand</p>
<p>it. So when you basically whip up a largely political argument against a scientist and</p>
<p>hammer at it over and over again to the point where he now has to have 24 seven security</p>
<p>to protect him against people who really want to do violence to him. For that to be a reason</p>
<p>to say that then he should be fired is to hand the evil forces the victory. I will not</p>
<p>do that. Yet there&rsquo;s something difficult I&rsquo;m going to try to express to you. So it may</p>
<p>be your guitar playing. It may be something else, but there&rsquo;s a humility to you. It may</p>
<p>be because you&rsquo;re a man of God. There&rsquo;s a humility to you that garners trust. And when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a leadership position representing science, especially in catastrophic events</p>
<p>like the pandemic, it feels like as a leader, you have to go far above and beyond your usual</p>
<p>duties. And I think there&rsquo;s no question that Anthony Fauci has delivered on his duties,</p>
<p>but it feels like he needs to go above as a science communicator. And if there&rsquo;s a large</p>
<p>number of people that are distrusting him, it&rsquo;s also his responsibility to garner their</p>
<p>trust to gain their trust as a person who&rsquo;s the face of science. Do you, are you torn</p>
<p>on this? The responsibility of Anthony Fauci of yourself to represent science, not just</p>
<p>the communication of advising what should be done, but giving people hope, giving people</p>
<p>trust in science and alleviating division. Do you think that&rsquo;s also responsibility of</p>
<p>a leader or is that unfair to ask?</p>
<p>I think the best way you give people trust is to tell them the truth. And so they recognize</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re sharing information, it&rsquo;s the best you&rsquo;ve got at that point. And Tony</p>
<p>Fauci does that at every moment. I don&rsquo;t think him expressing more humility would change</p>
<p>the fact that they&rsquo;re looking for a target of somebody to blame, to basically distract</p>
<p>people from the failings of their own political party. Maybe I&rsquo;m less targeted, not because</p>
<p>of a difference in the way in which I convey the information. I&rsquo;m less visible. If Tony</p>
<p>were out of the scene and I was placed in that role, I&rsquo;d probably be seeing a ratcheting</p>
<p>up of that same targeting.</p>
<p>I would like to believe that if Tony Fauci said that when I originally made recommendations</p>
<p>not to wear masks, that was given on the, on the, our best available data. And now we</p>
<p>know that is a mistake. So admit with humility that there&rsquo;s an error. That&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not actually correct, but that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a statement of humility. And I would like</p>
<p>to believe, despite the attacks, he would win a lot of people over with that. So a lot</p>
<p>of people, as you&rsquo;re saying, would use that, see that here we go, here&rsquo;s that Dr. Anthony</p>
<p>Fauci making mistakes. How can we trust them on anything? I believe if he was that public</p>
<p>display of humility to say that I made an error, that would win a lot of people over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my, that&rsquo;s kind of my sense to face the fire of the attacks from politics. You</p>
<p>have to, like politicians will attack no matter what, but the question is the people, to win</p>
<p>over the people. The biggest concern I&rsquo;ve had is that there was this, this stress of</p>
<p>science that&rsquo;s been brewing and I&rsquo;m, maybe you can correct me, but I&rsquo;m a little bit unwilling</p>
<p>to fully blame the politicians because politicians play their games no matter what. It just feels</p>
<p>like this was an opportunity to inspire people with the power of science. The development</p>
<p>of the vaccines, no matter what you think of those vaccines is one of the greatest accomplishments</p>
<p>in the history of science. And the fact that that&rsquo;s not inspiring, listen, I host a podcast.</p>
<p>Whenever I say positive stuff about the vaccine, I get to hear a lot of different opinions.</p>
<p>The fact that I do is a big problem to me because it&rsquo;s an incredible, an incredible</p>
<p>accomplishment of science. And so I, I, I, I, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I have to put responsibility</p>
<p>on the leaders, even if it&rsquo;s not their mistakes. That&rsquo;s what the leadership is. That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>leadership is. You take responsibility for the situation. I wonder if there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that could have been done better to give people hope that science will save us as opposed</p>
<p>to science will divide us.</p>
<p>I think you have more confidence in the ability to get beyond our current divisions than I</p>
<p>do after seeing just how deep and dark they have become. Tony Fauci has said multiple</p>
<p>times the recommendation about not wearing masks was for two reasons, a shortage of masks,</p>
<p>which were needed in hospitals and a lack of realization early in the course of the</p>
<p>epidemic that this was a virus that could heavily infect asymptomatic people. As that</p>
<p>changed, he changed. Now, did he make an error? No, he was making a judgment based on the</p>
<p>data available at the time, but he certainly made that clear over and over again. It has</p>
<p>not stopped those who would like to demonize him from saying, well, he just flip flopped.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t trust a guy. He says one thing today and one thing tomorrow.</p>
<p>Well, masks is a tricky one. So I&rsquo;m actually early on, I&rsquo;m a coauthor on a paper, one of</p>
<p>many, but this was a survey paper overlooking the, the evidence. It&rsquo;s a summary of the evidence</p>
<p>we have for the effectiveness of masks. It seems that it&rsquo;s difficult to do rigorous scientific</p>
<p>study on masks.</p>
<p>It is difficult.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of philosophical and ethical questions I want to ask you, but within this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s back to your words and Anthony Fauci&rsquo;s words. When you&rsquo;re dealing with so much uncertainty</p>
<p>and so much potential uncertainty about how catastrophic this virus is in the early days,</p>
<p>and knowing that each word you say may create panic, how do you communicate science with</p>
<p>the world? It&rsquo;s a philosophical, it&rsquo;s an ethical, it&rsquo;s a practical question. There was a discussion</p>
<p>about masks a century ago and that too led to panic. So, I mean, I&rsquo;m trying to put myself</p>
<p>in the mind, in your mind, in the mind of Anthony Fauci in those early days, knowing</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s limited supply of masks. Like, what do you say? Do you fully convey the uncertainty</p>
<p>of the situation of the, of the challenges of the supply chain? Or do you say that masks</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work? That&rsquo;s a complicated calculation. How do you make that calculation?</p>
<p>It is a complicated calculation. As a scientist, your temptation would be to give a full brain</p>
<p>dump of all the details of the information about what&rsquo;s known and what isn&rsquo;t known and</p>
<p>what experiments need to be done. Most of the time that&rsquo;s not going to play well in</p>
<p>a soundbite on the evening news. So you have to kind of distill it down to a recommendation</p>
<p>that is the best you can do at that time with the information you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a man of God. And we&rsquo;ll return to that to talk about some, some also unanswerable</p>
<p>philosophical questions. But first let&rsquo;s linger on the vaccine because in the, in the religious,</p>
<p>in the Christian community, there was some hesitancy with the vaccine.</p>
<p>Still is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of data showing high efficacy and safety of vaccines, of COVID vaccines,</p>
<p>but still they are far from perfect as all vaccines are. Can you empathize with people</p>
<p>who are hesitant to take the COVID vaccine or to have their children take the COVID vaccine?</p>
<p>I can totally empathize, especially when people are barraged by conflicting information coming</p>
<p>at them from all kinds of directions. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of my time in the last year trying</p>
<p>to figure out how to do a better job of listening because I think we have all got the risk of</p>
<p>assuming we know the basis for somebody&rsquo;s hesitancy. And that often doesn&rsquo;t turn out</p>
<p>to be what you thought. And the variety of reasons is quite broad. I think a big concern</p>
<p>is just this sense of uncertainty about whether this was done too fast and that corners were</p>
<p>cut and there are good answers to that. Along with that, a sense that maybe this vaccine</p>
<p>will have longterm effects that we won&rsquo;t know about for years to come. And one can say that</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been seen with other vaccines and there&rsquo;s no particular reason to think this one&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be different than the dozens of others that we have experience with. But you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>absolutely say, no, there&rsquo;s no chance of that. So it does come down to listening and then</p>
<p>trying in a fashion that doesn&rsquo;t convey a message that you&rsquo;re smarter than the person</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking to because that isn&rsquo;t going to help to really address what the substance</p>
<p>is of the concerns. But my heart goes out to so many people who are fearful about this</p>
<p>because of all the information that has been dumped on them. Some of it by politicians,</p>
<p>a lot of it by the internet, some of it by parts of the media that seem to take pleasure</p>
<p>in stirring up this kind of fear for their own reasons. And that is shameful. I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>sympathetic with the people who are confused and fearful. I am not sympathetic with people</p>
<p>who are distributing information that&rsquo;s demonstrably false and continue to do so. They&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>lives. I didn&rsquo;t realize how strong that sector of disinformation would be. And it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>in many ways more effective than the means of spreading the truth. This is going to take</p>
<p>us into another place. But Lex, if there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m really worried about in this</p>
<p>country, and it&rsquo;s not just this country, but it&rsquo;s the one I live in, is that we have another</p>
<p>epidemic besides COVID 19. And it&rsquo;s an epidemic of the loss of the anchor of truth. That truth</p>
<p>as a means of making decisions, truth as a means of figuring out how to wrestle with</p>
<p>a question like, should I get this vaccine for myself or my children, seems to have lost</p>
<p>its primacy. And instead, it&rsquo;s an opinion of somebody who expressed it very strongly,</p>
<p>or some Facebook post that I read two hours ago. And for those to become substitutes for</p>
<p>objective truth, not just, of course, for vaccines, but for many other issues, like</p>
<p>was the 2020 election actually fair? This worries me deeply. It&rsquo;s bad enough to have</p>
<p>polarization and divisions, but to have no way of resolving those by actually saying,</p>
<p>okay, what&rsquo;s true here, makes me very worried about the path we&rsquo;re on. And I&rsquo;m usually an</p>
<p>optimist.</p>
<p>Well, to give you an optimistic angle on this, I actually think that the sense that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no one place for truth is just a thing that will inspire leaders and science communicators</p>
<p>to speak, not from a place of authority, but from a place of humility. I think it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>challenging people to communicate in a new way, to be listeners first. I think the problem</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that there&rsquo;s a lot of misinformation. I think that the internet and the world are</p>
<p>distrustful of people who speak as if they possess the truth with an authoritarian kind</p>
<p>of tone, which was, I think, defining for what science was in the 20th century. I just</p>
<p>think it has to sound different in the 21st. In the battle of ideas, I think humility and</p>
<p>love wins. And that&rsquo;s how science wins, not through having quote unquote truth. Because</p>
<p>now everybody can just say, I have the truth. I think you have to speak, like I said, from</p>
<p>humility, not authority. And so it&rsquo;s just challenges our leaders to go back and learn</p>
<p>to be, pardon my French, less assholes and more kind. And like you said, to listen, to</p>
<p>listen to the experiences of people that are good people, not the ones who are trying to</p>
<p>manipulate the system or play a game and so on, but real people who are just afraid of</p>
<p>uncertainty of hurting those they loved and so on. So I think it&rsquo;s just an opportunity</p>
<p>for leaders to go back and take a class on effective communication.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you on shifting more from where we are to humility and love. That&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>the right answer. That&rsquo;s very biblical, by the way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get there. I have to bring up Joe Rogan. I don&rsquo;t know if you know who he is.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a podcaster, comedian, fighting commentator, and my now friend.</p>
<p>And Iver Mecton believer too.</p>
<p>Yes. That is the question I have to ask you about. He has gotten some flack in the mainstream</p>
<p>media for not getting vaccinated. And when he got COVID recently, taking Iver Mecton</p>
<p>as part of a cocktail of treatments. The NIH actually has a nice page on Iver Mecton saying</p>
<p>quote, there&rsquo;s insufficient evidence to recommend either for or against the use of Iver Mecton</p>
<p>for the treatment of COVID 19 results from adequately powered, well designed and well</p>
<p>conducted clinical trials are needed to provide more specific evidence based guidance on the</p>
<p>role of Iver Mecton in the treatment of COVID 19.</p>
<p>So let me ask, why do you think there has been so much attack on Joe Rogan and anyone</p>
<p>else that&rsquo;s talking about Iver Mecton when there&rsquo;s insufficient evidence for or against?</p>
<p>Well let&rsquo;s unpack that. First of all, I think the concerns about Joe are not limited to</p>
<p>his taking Iver Mecton. Much more seriously, his being fairly publicly negative about vaccines</p>
<p>at a time where people are dying. 700,000 people have died from COVID 19 estimates by</p>
<p>Kaiser or at least 100,000 of those were unnecessary deaths of unvaccinated people. And for Joe</p>
<p>to promote that further, even as this pandemic rages through our population is simply irresponsible.</p>
<p>So yeah, the Iver Mecton is just one other twist. Obviously Iver Mecton has been controversial</p>
<p>for months and months. The reason that it got particular attention is because of the</p>
<p>way in which it seemed to have captured the imagination of a lot of people and to the</p>
<p>point where they were taking doses that were intended for livestock and some of them got</p>
<p>pretty sick as a result from overdosing on this stuff. That was not good judgment. The</p>
<p>drug itself remains uncertain. There&rsquo;s a recent review that looks at all of the studies of</p>
<p>Iver Mecton and basically concludes that it probably doesn&rsquo;t work. We are running a study</p>
<p>right now. I looked at that data this morning in a trial called active six, which is one</p>
<p>of the ones that my public private partnership is running. We&rsquo;re up to about 400 patients</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been randomized to Iver Mecton or placebo and should know perhaps as soon as a month</p>
<p>from now in a very carefully controlled trial, did it help or did it not? So there will be</p>
<p>an answer coming back to Joe again. I don&rsquo;t think the fact that he took the Iver Mecton</p>
<p>and hoping it might work, uh, is that big a knock against him. It&rsquo;s more the conveying</p>
<p>of we don&rsquo;t trust what science says, which is vaccines are going to save your life. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to trust what&rsquo;s on the internet that says Iver Mecton and hydroxychloroquine really</p>
<p>do work, even though the scientific community says probably not.</p>
<p>So let me push back in that a little bit. So he doesn&rsquo;t, he doesn&rsquo;t say, let&rsquo;s not listen</p>
<p>to science. He doesn&rsquo;t say the vaccine don&rsquo;t get vaccinated. He says it&rsquo;s okay to ask questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with that. How risky is the vaccine for certain populations? What are the benefits</p>
<p>and risks? There&rsquo;s other friends of Joe and friends of mine, like Sam Harris, who says,</p>
<p>if you look at the data, it&rsquo;s obvious that the benefits outweigh the risks. And what Joe says</p>
<p>is yes, but let&rsquo;s still openly talk about risks. And he often brings up anecdotal evidence</p>
<p>of people who&rsquo;ve had, uh, highly negative effects from vaccines. Science is not done</p>
<p>with anecdotal evidence. And so you could infer a lot of stuff from the way he expresses</p>
<p>it, but he also communicates a lot of interesting questions. Uh, and that&rsquo;s something maybe</p>
<p>you can comment on this. You know, there&rsquo;s certain groups that are healthy. They have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re younger, they have, they exercise a lot. They get the all, you know, nutrition</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things. He shows skepticism on whether it&rsquo;s so obvious that they should</p>
<p>get vaccinated. And the same is he makes this, he kind of presents the same kind of skepticism</p>
<p>for kids, for young kids. So with empathy and, uh, you know, listening my Russian ineliquent</p>
<p>description of what Joe believes, what, what is your kind of response to that? Why should</p>
<p>certain categories of healthy and young people still get vaccinated? Do you think?</p>
<p>Well, first just to say it&rsquo;s great for Joe to be a skeptic, to ask questions. We should</p>
<p>all be doing that. But then the next step is to go and see what the data says and see</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re actually answers to those questions. So coming to healthy people, I&rsquo;ve done a bunch</p>
<p>of podcasts besides this one. The one I think I remember most was a podcast with a worldwide</p>
<p>wrestling superstar. Very nice. He&rsquo;s about six foot six and just absolutely solid muscle.</p>
<p>And he got COVID and he almost died. And recovering from that, he said, I&rsquo;ve got to let my supporters</p>
<p>know because you can imagine worldwide wrestling fans are probably not big embracers of the</p>
<p>need for vaccines. And he want, he just turned himself into a spokesperson for the fact that</p>
<p>this virus doesn&rsquo;t care how healthy you are, how much you exercise, what a great specimen</p>
<p>you are. It wiped him out. And we see that, you know, the average person in the ICU right</p>
<p>now with COVID 19 is under age 50. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people still thinking, Oh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just those old people in the nursing homes. That&rsquo;s not going to be about me. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrong. And there are plenty of instances of people who were totally healthy with no underlying</p>
<p>diseases, taking good care of themselves, not obese exercising who have died from this</p>
<p>disease. 700 children have died from this disease. Yes. Some of them had underlying</p>
<p>factors like obesity, but a lot of them did not. So it&rsquo;s fair to say younger people are</p>
<p>less susceptible to serious illness, kids even less so, and then young adults, but it</p>
<p>ain&rsquo;t zero. And if the vaccine is really safe and really effective, then you probably want</p>
<p>everybody to take advantage of that. Even though some are dropping their risks more</p>
<p>than others, everybody&rsquo;s dropping their risks. Some, are you worried about variants? So looking</p>
<p>out into the future, what&rsquo;s your vision for all the possible trajectories that this virus</p>
<p>takes in human society? I&rsquo;m totally worried about the variants. Delta was such an impressive</p>
<p>arrival on the scene in all the wrong ways. I mean, it took over the world in the space</p>
<p>of just a couple months because of its extremely contagious ability. Viruses would be beautiful</p>
<p>if they weren&rsquo;t terrifying. Yeah, exactly. I mean, this whole story of viral evolution</p>
<p>scientifically is just amazingly elegant. Anybody who really wanted to understand how</p>
<p>evolution works in real time, study SARS CoV 2, because it&rsquo;s not just Delta, it&rsquo;s Alpha,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Beta, and it&rsquo;s Gamma, and it&rsquo;s the fact that these sweep through the world&rsquo;s population</p>
<p>by fairly minor differences in fitness. So the real question many people are wrestling</p>
<p>is, is Delta it? Is it such a fit virus that nothing else will be able to displace it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, there&rsquo;s now Delta AY4, which is a variant of Delta that at least</p>
<p>in the UK seems to be taking over the Delta population as though it&rsquo;s maybe even a little</p>
<p>more contagious. That might be the first hint that we&rsquo;re seeing something new here. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a completely different virus. It&rsquo;s still Delta, but it&rsquo;s Delta Plus. You know, the</p>
<p>big worry is what&rsquo;s out there that is so different that the vaccine protection doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know how different it needs to be for the vaccine to start working. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the terrifying thing about each of these variants. It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s always a pleasant surprise</p>
<p>that a vaccine seems to still have efficacy.</p>
<p>And hooray for our immune system, may I say, because the vaccine immunized you against</p>
<p>that original Wuhan virus. Now we can see that especially after two doses and even more</p>
<p>so after a booster, your immune system is so clever that it&rsquo;s also making a diversity</p>
<p>of antibodies to cover some other things that might happen to that virus to make it a little</p>
<p>different. And you&rsquo;re still getting really good coverage. Even for beta, which was South</p>
<p>Africa B1351, which is the most different, it looks pretty good. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>it will always be as good as that if something gets really far away from the original virus.</p>
<p>Now the good news is we would know what to do in that situation. The mRNA vaccines allow</p>
<p>you to redesign the vaccine like that and to quickly get it through a few thousand participants</p>
<p>in a clinical trial to be sure it&rsquo;s raising antibodies and then bang, you could go. But</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have to do that. There will be people&rsquo;s lives at risk in the meantime.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the best way to keep that from happening? Well, try to cut down the number</p>
<p>of infections because you don&rsquo;t get variants unless the virus is replicating in a person.</p>
<p>So how do we solve this thing? How do we get out of this pandemic? What&rsquo;s like, if you</p>
<p>had a, like a wand or something, or you could really implement policies, what&rsquo;s the full</p>
<p>cocktail of solutions here? It&rsquo;s a full cocktail. It&rsquo;s not just one thing. In our own country</p>
<p>here in the US, it would be getting those 64 million reluctant people to actually go</p>
<p>ahead and get vaccinated. There&rsquo;s 64 million people who didn&rsquo;t get vaccinated? Adults.</p>
<p>Yes. Not even counting the kids. 64 million. Isn&rsquo;t that astounding? Get the kids vaccinated.</p>
<p>Hopefully their parents will see that as a good thing too. Get those of us who are due</p>
<p>for boosters boosted because that&rsquo;s going to reduce our likelihood of having breakthrough</p>
<p>infections and keep spreading it. Convince people that until we&rsquo;re really done with this,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not now, that social distancing and mask wearing indoors are still critical</p>
<p>to cut down the number of new infections. But of course, that&rsquo;s our country. This is</p>
<p>a worldwide pandemic. I worry greatly about the fact that low and middle income countries</p>
<p>have for the most part, not even gotten started with access to vaccines. And we have to figure</p>
<p>out a way to speed that up because otherwise that&rsquo;s where the next variant will probably</p>
<p>arrive. And who knows how bad it will be. And it will cross the world quickly as we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen happen repeatedly in the last 22 months.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m really surprised, annoyed, frustrated that rapid at home testing from the very beginning</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t a big, big part of the solution. First of all, nobody&rsquo;s against it. That&rsquo;s one huge</p>
<p>plus for testing. Everybody supports. Second of all, that&rsquo;s what America is good at is</p>
<p>mask manufacturer stuff, like stepping up, engineers stepping up and really deploying</p>
<p>it. Plus, without the collection of data is giving people freedom, is giving them information</p>
<p>and then freedom to decide what to do with that information. It&rsquo;s such a powerful solution.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand. Well, now I think the Biden administration is, I think, emphasized</p>
<p>like the scaling of testing manufacturers. But I just feel like it&rsquo;s an obvious solution.</p>
<p>Get a test that costs less than a dollar to manufacture, costs less than a dollar to buy.</p>
<p>And just everybody gets tested every single day. Don&rsquo;t share that data with anyone. You</p>
<p>just make the decisions. And I believe in the intelligence of people to make the right</p>
<p>decision to stay at home when the test is positive.</p>
<p>I am so completely with you on that. And NIH has been smack in the middle of trying to</p>
<p>make that dream come true. We&rsquo;re running a trial right now in Georgia, Indiana, Hawaii.</p>
<p>And where is the other one? Oh, Kentucky. Basically blanketing a community with free</p>
<p>testing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And look to see what happens as far as stemming the spread of the epidemic and measuring it</p>
<p>by wastewater because you can really tell whether you&rsquo;ve cut back the amount of infection</p>
<p>in the community. Yeah, I&rsquo;m so with you. We got off to such a bad start with testing.</p>
<p>And of course, all the testing was being done for the first several months in big box laboratories</p>
<p>where you had to send the sample off and put it through the mail somehow and get the result</p>
<p>back sometimes five days later after you&rsquo;ve already infected a dozen people. It was just</p>
<p>a completely wrong model. But it&rsquo;s what we had. And everybody was like, oh, we got to</p>
<p>stick with PCR because if you start using those home tests that are based on antigens,</p>
<p>lateral flow, probably there&rsquo;s going to be false positives and false negatives. Okay,</p>
<p>sure. No test is perfect. But having a test that&rsquo;s not acceptable or accessible is the</p>
<p>worst setting.</p>
<p>So we, NIH, with some requests from Congress, got a billion dollars to create this program</p>
<p>called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics, RADx. And we turned into a venture capital</p>
<p>organization, and we invited every small business or academic lab that had a cool idea about</p>
<p>how to do home testing to bring it forward. And we threw them into what we called our</p>
<p>shark tank of business experts, engineers, technology people, people who understood how</p>
<p>to deal with supply chains and manufacturing. And right now today, there are about two million</p>
<p>tests being done based on what came out of that program, including most of the home tests</p>
<p>that you can now buy on the pharmacy shelves. We did that. And I wish we had done it faster,</p>
<p>but it was an amazingly speedy effort. And you&rsquo;re right, companies are really good. Once</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got an FDA emergency use authorization, and we helped a lot of them get that, they</p>
<p>can scale up their manufacturing. I think in December, we should have about 410 million</p>
<p>tests for that month ready to go. And if we can get one or two more platforms approved,</p>
<p>and by the way, we are now helping FDA by being their validation lab. If we can get</p>
<p>a couple more of these approved, we could be in the half a billion tests a month, which</p>
<p>is really getting where we need to be.</p>
<p>Wow. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a dream. That&rsquo;s a dream for me. It seems like an obvious solution,</p>
<p>engineering solution. Everybody&rsquo;s behind it, at least to hope versus division. I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A happy story.</p>
<p>I was waiting for one.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. Well, one last dive into the not happy, but you won&rsquo;t even have to</p>
<p>comment on it. Well, comment on the broader philosophical question. So NIH, again, I said,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan is the first one who pointed me to this. NIH was recently accused of funding</p>
<p>research of a paper that had images of sedated puppies with their heads inserted into small</p>
<p>enclosures containing disease carrying sand flies. So I can just say that this story is</p>
<p>not true, or at least the&hellip; I think it is true that the paper that showed those images</p>
<p>cited NIH as a funding source, but that citation is not correct.</p>
<p>That was not correct.</p>
<p>Yeah. But that brings up a bigger philosophical question, that it could have been correct.</p>
<p>How difficult is it as a director of NIH or just NIH as an organization that&rsquo;s funding</p>
<p>so many amazing deep research studies to ensure the ethical fortitude of those studies when</p>
<p>the ethics of science is&hellip; There&rsquo;s such a gray area between what is and what isn&rsquo;t ethical.</p>
<p>Well, tough issues. Certainly animal research is a tough issue.</p>
<p>I was going to bring up as a good example of that tough issue is in 2015, you announced</p>
<p>that NIH will no longer support any biomedical research involving chimpanzees. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like one example of looking in the mirror, thinking deeply about what is and isn&rsquo;t ethical.</p>
<p>And there was a conclusion that biomedical research on chimps is not ethical.</p>
<p>That was the conclusion. That was based on a lot of deep thinking and a lot of input</p>
<p>from people who have considered this issue and a panel of the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>that was asked to review the issue. I mean, the question that I wanted them to look at</p>
<p>was, are we actually learning anything that&rsquo;s really essential from chimpanzee invasive</p>
<p>research at this point? Or is it time to say that these closest relatives of ours should</p>
<p>not be subjected to that any further and ought to be retired to a sanctuary?</p>
<p>And that was the conclusion that there was really no kind of medical experimentation</p>
<p>that needed to be done on chimps in order to proceed. So why are we still doing this?</p>
<p>Many of these were chimpanzees that were purchased because we thought they would be good hosts</p>
<p>for HIV AIDS, and they sort of weren&rsquo;t. And they were kept around in these primate laboratories</p>
<p>with people coming up with other things to do, but they weren&rsquo;t compelling scientifically.</p>
<p>So I think that was the right decision. I took a lot of flak from some of the scientific</p>
<p>community said, well, you&rsquo;re caving in to the animal rights people. And now that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>said no more research on chimps, what&rsquo;s next? Certainly when it comes to companion animals,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s heart starts to be hurting when you see anything done that seems harmful to</p>
<p>a dog or a cat. I have a cat, I don&rsquo;t have a dog. And I understand that completely. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why we have these oversight groups that decide before you do any of that kind of research,</p>
<p>is it justified? And what kind of provision is going to be made to avoid pain and suffering?</p>
<p>And those have input from the public as well as the scientific community. Is that completely</p>
<p>saying that every step that&rsquo;s happening there is ethical by some standard that would be</p>
<p>hard for anybody to agree to? No, but at least it&rsquo;s a consensus of what people think is acceptable.</p>
<p>Dogs are the only host for some diseases like leishmaniasis, which was that paper that we</p>
<p>were not responsible for, but I know why they were doing the experiment, or like lymphatic</p>
<p>filariasis, which is an experiment that we are supporting in Georgia that involves dogs</p>
<p>getting infected with a parasite, because that&rsquo;s the only model we have to know whether</p>
<p>a treatment is going to work or not. So I will defend that. I am not in the place of</p>
<p>those who think all animal research is evil, because I think if there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be done to save a child from a terrible disease or an adult, and it involves animal</p>
<p>research that&rsquo;s been carefully reviewed, then I think ethically why it doesn&rsquo;t make me comfortable,</p>
<p>it still seems like it&rsquo;s the right choice. I think to say all animal research should</p>
<p>be taken off the table is also very unethical, because that means you have basically doomed</p>
<p>a lot of people for whom that research might have saved their lives to having no more hope.</p>
<p>And to me personally, there&rsquo;s far greater concerns ethically in terms of factory farming,</p>
<p>for example, the treatment of animals in other contexts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much that goes on outside of medical research that is much more troubling.</p>
<p>That said, I think all cats have to go. That&rsquo;s just my off the record opinion. That&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not involved with any ethical decisions. I&rsquo;m just joking internet ethic. I love cats.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a dog person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a dog person. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Have you seen the New Yorker cartoon where there are two dogs in the bar having a martini</p>
<p>and one is saying they&rsquo;re dressed up in their business suits and one says to the other,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not enough for the dogs to win. The cats have to lose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful. So a few weeks ago, you&rsquo;ve announced that you&rsquo;re resigning from the NIH</p>
<p>at the end of the year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stepping down. I&rsquo;m still going to be at NIH at a different capacity.</p>
<p>Right. And it&rsquo;s over a decade of an incredible career overseeing the NIH as its director.</p>
<p>What are the things you&rsquo;re most proud of, of the NIH in your time here as its director</p>
<p>may be memorable moments?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot in 12 years. Science has just progressed in amazing ways over those 12 years.</p>
<p>Think about where we are right now. Something like gene editing, being able to make changes</p>
<p>in DNA, even for therapeutic purposes, which is now curing sickle cell disease. Unthinkable</p>
<p>when I became director in 2009. The ability to study single cells and ask them what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing and get an answer. Single cell biology just has emerged in this incredibly powerful</p>
<p>way. Having the courage to be able to say we could actually understand the human brain</p>
<p>seemed like so far out there. And we&rsquo;re in the process of doing that with the Brain Initiative.</p>
<p>Taking all that we&rsquo;ve learned about the genome and applying it to cancer to make individual</p>
<p>cancer treatment really precision. And developing cancer immunotherapy, which seemed like sort</p>
<p>of a backwater into some of the hottest science around. All those things sort of erupting.</p>
<p>And much more to come, I&rsquo;m sure. We&rsquo;re on an exponential curve of medical research advances,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s glorious to watch. And of course, COVID 19, as a beneficiary of decades of basic</p>
<p>science, understanding what mRNA is, understanding basics about coronaviruses and spike proteins</p>
<p>and how to combine structural biology and immunology and genomics into this package</p>
<p>that allows you to make a vaccine in 11 months. Just I would never have imagined that possible</p>
<p>in 2009. So to have been able to kind of be the midwife, helping all of those things get</p>
<p>birthed, that&rsquo;s been just an amazing 12 years. And as NIH director, you have this convening</p>
<p>power and this ability to look across the whole landscape of biomedical research and</p>
<p>identify areas that are just like ready for something big to happen. But it isn&rsquo;t going</p>
<p>to happen spontaneously without some encouragement, without pulling people together from different</p>
<p>disciplines who don&rsquo;t know each other and maybe don&rsquo;t know how to quite understand each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s scientific language and create an environment for that to happen. That has been</p>
<p>just an amazing experience. I mean, I mentioned the Brain Initiative as one of those. The</p>
<p>Brain Initiative right now, I think there&rsquo;s about 600 investigators working on this. Last</p>
<p>week, the whole issue of Nature magazine was about the output of the Brain Initiative basically</p>
<p>now giving us a cell census of what those cells in the brain are doing, which has just</p>
<p>never been imaginable. And interestingly, more than half of the investigators in the</p>
<p>Brain Initiative are engineers. They&rsquo;re not biologists in a traditional sense. I love</p>
<p>that. Maybe partly because my PhD is in quantum mechanics. So I think it&rsquo;s really a good idea</p>
<p>to bring disciplines together and see what happens. That&rsquo;s an exciting thing. And I will</p>
<p>not ever forget having the chance to announce that program in the East Room in that White</p>
<p>House with President Obama, who totally got it and totally loved science and working with</p>
<p>him in some of those rare moments of sort of one on one conversation in the Oval Office,</p>
<p>just him and me about science. That&rsquo;s a gift.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like talking to Barack Obama about science? He seems to be a sponge. I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>him. I&rsquo;m an artificial intelligence person. And I&rsquo;ve heard him talk about AI. And it was</p>
<p>like, it made me think, is somebody like whispering in his ear or something? Because he was saying</p>
<p>stuff that totally passed the BS test, like he really understands stuff.</p>
<p>He does.</p>
<p>That means he listened to a bunch of experts on AI. He was explaining the difference between</p>
<p>narrow artificial intelligence and strong AI. He was saying all this, both technical</p>
<p>and philosophical stuff. And it just made me, I don&rsquo;t know, it made me hopeful about</p>
<p>the depth of understanding that a human being in political office can attain.</p>
<p>That gave me hope as well, and having those experiences. Oftentimes in a group, I mean,</p>
<p>another example was trying to figure out, how do we take what we&rsquo;ve learned about the</p>
<p>genome and really apply it at scale to figure out how to prevent illness, not just treat</p>
<p>it, but prevent it, out of which came this program called All of Us, this million strong</p>
<p>American cohort of participants who make their electronic health records and their genome</p>
<p>sequences and everything else available for researchers to look at. That came out of a</p>
<p>couple of conversations with Obama and others in his office, and he asked the best questions.</p>
<p>That was what struck me so much. I mean, a room full of scientists, and we&rsquo;d be talking</p>
<p>about the possible approaches, and he would come up with this incredibly insightful penetrating</p>
<p>question. Not that he knew what the answer was going to be, but he knew what the right</p>
<p>question was.</p>
<p>I think the core to that is curiosity. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s even like, he&rsquo;s trying to be a</p>
<p>good leader. He&rsquo;s legit curious.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Legit.</p>
<p>That he, almost like a kid in a candy store, gets to talk to the world experts. He somehow</p>
<p>sneaked into this office and gets to talk to the world experts. That&rsquo;s the kind of energy</p>
<p>that I think leads to beautiful leadership in the space of science.</p>
<p>Indeed. Another thing I&rsquo;ve been able to do as director is to try to break down some of</p>
<p>the boundaries that seem to be traditional between the public and the private sectors.</p>
<p>When it comes to areas of science that really could and should be open access anyway, why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we work together? That was obvious early on. After identifying a few possible collaborators</p>
<p>who are chief scientists of pharmaceutical companies, it looked like we might be able</p>
<p>to do something in that space.</p>
<p>Out of that was born something called the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, AMP. It</p>
<p>took a couple of years of convening people who usually didn&rsquo;t talk to each other. There</p>
<p>was a lot of suspicion. Academic scientists saying, oh, those scientists in pharma, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not that smart. They&rsquo;re just trying to make money. The academic scientists getting the</p>
<p>rap from the pharmaceutical scientists, all they want to do is publish papers. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really care about helping anybody.</p>
<p>We found out both of those stereotypes were wrong. Over the course of that couple of years,</p>
<p>we built a momentum behind three starting projects, one on Alzheimer&rsquo;s, one on diabetes,</p>
<p>one on rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Very different, each one of them trying to identify</p>
<p>what is an area that we both really need to see advance and we could do better together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to have to be open access, otherwise NIH is not going to play. Guess what, industry?</p>
<p>If you really want to do this, you got to have skin in the game. We&rsquo;ll cover half the</p>
<p>cost. You got to cover the other half.</p>
<p>I love it. Enforcing open access, resulting in open science.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars gone into this and it has been a wild success. After many people</p>
<p>were skeptical, a couple of years later, we had another project on Parkinson&rsquo;s. More recently,</p>
<p>we added one on schizophrenia. Just this week, we added one on gene therapy, on bespoke gene</p>
<p>therapy for ultra rare diseases, which otherwise aren&rsquo;t going to have enough commercial appeal.</p>
<p>If we did this together, especially with FDA at the table, and they have been, we could</p>
<p>make something happen, turn this into a standardized approach where everything didn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>a one off. I&rsquo;m really excited about that.</p>
<p>What began as three projects is six and it&rsquo;s about to be seven next year with a heart failure</p>
<p>and all of us have gotten to know each other. If it weren&rsquo;t for that background when COVID</p>
<p>came along, it would have been a lot harder to build the partnership called ACTIV, which</p>
<p>has been my passion for the last 20 months, accelerating COVID 19 therapeutic interventions</p>
<p>and vaccines.</p>
<p>We just had our leadership team meeting this morning. It was amazing what&rsquo;s been accomplished.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much 100 people who dropped everything just to work on this, about half</p>
<p>from industry and half from government and academia. That&rsquo;s how we got vaccine master</p>
<p>protocols designed. We all agreed about what the endpoints had to be and you wondered why</p>
<p>are there 30,000 participants in each of these trials? That&rsquo;s because of ACTIV&rsquo;s group mapping</p>
<p>out what the power needed to be for this to be convincing.</p>
<p>Same with therapeutics. We have run at least 20 therapeutic agents through trials that</p>
<p>ACTIV supported in record time. That&rsquo;s how we got monoclonal antibodies that we know</p>
<p>work. That would not have been possible if I didn&rsquo;t already have a sense of how to work</p>
<p>with the private sector that came out of AMP. AMP took two years to get started. ACTIV took</p>
<p>two weeks. We just kept the lawyers.</p>
<p>Wow, to get 100 people over?</p>
<p>Yeah, kept the lawyers out of the room and away we went.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re going to get yourself in trouble. I do hope one day the story of this incredible</p>
<p>vaccine development of vaccine protocols and trials and all this kind of details, the messy</p>
<p>beautiful details of science and engineering that led to the manufacturing, the deployment</p>
<p>and the scientific test. It&rsquo;s such a nice dance between engineering in the space of</p>
<p>manufacturing the vaccines. You start before the studies are complete, you start making</p>
<p>the vaccines just in case that if the studies proved to be positive, then you can start</p>
<p>deploying them just like so many parties, like you said, private and public playing</p>
<p>together. That&rsquo;s just a beautiful dance that is one of the, for me, the sources of hope</p>
<p>in this very tricky time where there&rsquo;s a lot of things to be cynical about in terms of</p>
<p>the games politicians play and the hardship experience of the economy and all those kinds</p>
<p>of things. That to me, this dance was a vaccine development was done just beautifully and</p>
<p>it gives me hope.</p>
<p>It does me as well. And it was in many ways the finest hour that science has had in a</p>
<p>long time being called upon when every day counted and making sure that time was not</p>
<p>wasted and things were done rigorously, but quickly.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re incredibly good as a leader of the NIH. It seems like you&rsquo;re having a heck</p>
<p>of a lot of fun. Why step down from this role after so much fun?</p>
<p>Well, no other NIH director has served more than one president after being appointed by</p>
<p>one. You&rsquo;re sort of done. And the idea of being carried over for a second presidency</p>
<p>with Trump and now a third one with Biden is unheard of. I just think, Lex, that scientific</p>
<p>organizations benefit from new vision and 12 years is a really long time to have the</p>
<p>same leader. And if I wasn&rsquo;t going to stick it out for the entire Biden four year term,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good not to wait too late during that to signal an intent to step down because the</p>
<p>president&rsquo;s got to find the right person, got to nominate them, got to get the Senate</p>
<p>to confirm them, which is an unpredictable process right now.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to try to do that in the second half of somebody&rsquo;s term as president.</p>
<p>This has got to happen now. So, I kind of decided back at the end of May that this should</p>
<p>be my final year. And I&rsquo;m okay with that. I do have some mixed emotions because I love</p>
<p>the NIH. I love the job. It&rsquo;s exhausting. I&rsquo;m traditionally for the last 20 months anyway,</p>
<p>working 100 hours a week. It&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s what it takes to juggle all of this. And that</p>
<p>keeps me from having a lot of time for anything else. And I wouldn&rsquo;t mind because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m done yet. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having some time to really think about what the next</p>
<p>chapter should be. And I have none of that time right now. Do I have another calling?</p>
<p>Is there something else I could contribute that&rsquo;s different than this? I&rsquo;d like to find</p>
<p>that out.</p>
<p>I think the right answer is you&rsquo;re just stepping down to focus on your music career.</p>
<p>That might not be a good plan for anything very sustainable.</p>
<p>But I think that is a sign of a great leader as George Washington did stepping down at</p>
<p>the right time.</p>
<p>Ted Williams.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He quit when I think he hit a home run on his last at bat and his average was 400 at</p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>No one to walk away. I mean, it&rsquo;s hard, but it&rsquo;s beautiful to see in a leader. You also</p>
<p>oversaw the human genome project. You mentioned the brain initiative, which has, it&rsquo;s a dream</p>
<p>to map the human brain. And there&rsquo;s the dream to map the human code, which was the human</p>
<p>genome project. And you have said that it is humbling for me and awe inspiring to realize</p>
<p>that we have caught the first glimpse of our own instruction book, previously known only</p>
<p>to God. How does that, if you can just kind of wax poetic for a second, how does it make</p>
<p>you feel that we were able to map this instruction book, look into our own code, and be able</p>
<p>to reverse engineer it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s breathtaking. It&rsquo;s so fundamental. And yet, for all of human history, we&rsquo;re ignorant</p>
<p>of the details of what that instruction book looked like. And then we crossed a bridge</p>
<p>into the territory of the known. And we had that in front of us still written in a language</p>
<p>that we had to learn how to read. And we&rsquo;re in the process of doing that and will be for</p>
<p>decades to come. But we owned it, we had it. And it has such profound consequences. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both a book about our history. It&rsquo;s a book of sort of the parts list of a human</p>
<p>being, the genes that are in there and how they&rsquo;re regulated. And it&rsquo;s also a medical</p>
<p>textbook that can teach us things that will provide answers to illnesses we don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>and alleviate suffering and premature death. So it&rsquo;s a pretty amazing thing to contemplate.</p>
<p>And it has utterly transformed the way we do science. And it is in the process of transforming</p>
<p>the way we do medicine, although much of that still lies ahead. You know, while we were</p>
<p>working on the Genome Project, it was sort of hard to get this sense of a wellness, because</p>
<p>it was just hard work. And you were getting, you know, another mega base, okay, this is</p>
<p>good. But when did you actually step back and say, we did it? It&rsquo;s the profoundness</p>
<p>of that. I mean, there were two points, I guess. One was the announcement on that June</p>
<p>26, 2000, where the whole world heard, well, we don&rsquo;t quite have it, but we got a pretty</p>
<p>good draft. And suddenly, people are like realizing, oh, this is this a big deal. For</p>
<p>me, it was more when we got the full analysis of it, published it in February 2001. And</p>
<p>that issue of Nature paper that Eric Lander and Bob Waterston and I were the main authors,</p>
<p>and we toiled over and tried to get as much insight as we could in there about what the</p>
<p>meaning of all this was. But you also had this sense that we are such beginning readers</p>
<p>here. We are still in kindergarten, trying to make sense out of this 3 billion letter</p>
<p>book. And we&rsquo;re going to be at this for generations to come.</p>
<p>You are a man of faith, Christian, and you are a man of science. What is the role of</p>
<p>religion and of science in society and in the individual human mind and heart like yours?</p>
<p>Well, I was not a person of faith when I was growing up. I became a believer in my 20s,</p>
<p>influenced as a medical student by a recognition that I hadn&rsquo;t really thought through the</p>
<p>issues of what&rsquo;s the meaning of life? Why are we all here? What happens when you die?</p>
<p>Is there a God? Science is not so helpful in answering those questions. So I had to</p>
<p>look around in other places and ultimately came to my own conclusion that atheism, which</p>
<p>is where I had been, was the least supportable of the choices because it was the assertion</p>
<p>of a universal negative, which scientists aren&rsquo;t supposed to do. And agnosticism came</p>
<p>as an attractive option but felt a little bit like a cop out, so I had to keep going</p>
<p>trying to figure out why do believers actually believe this stuff? And I came to realize</p>
<p>it was all pretty compelling, that there&rsquo;s no proof. I can&rsquo;t prove to you or anybody</p>
<p>else that God exists, but I can say it&rsquo;s pretty darn plausible.</p>
<p>And ultimately, what kind of God is it that caused me to search through various religions</p>
<p>and see, well, what do people think about that? And to my surprise, encountered the</p>
<p>person of Jesus Christ as unique in every possible way and answering a lot of the questions</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t otherwise answer. And somewhat kicking and screaming, I became a Christian,</p>
<p>even though at the time, as a medical student already interested in genetics, people predicted</p>
<p>my head would then explode because these were incompatible worldviews. They really have</p>
<p>not been for me. I am so fortunate, I think, that in a given day, wrestling with an issue,</p>
<p>it can have both the rigorous scientific component and it can have the spiritual component. COVID</p>
<p>19 is a great example. These vaccines are both an amazing scientific achievement and</p>
<p>an answer to prayer. When I&rsquo;m wrestling with vaccine hesitancy and trying to figure out</p>
<p>what answers to come up with, I get so frustrated sometimes and I&rsquo;m comforted by reassurances</p>
<p>that God is aware of that. I don&rsquo;t have to do this alone.</p>
<p>So I know there are people like your friend, Sam Harris, who feel differently. Sam wrote</p>
<p>a rather famous op ed in the New York Times when I was nominated as the NIH director saying,</p>
<p>this is a terrible mistake. You can&rsquo;t have somebody who believes in God running the NIH.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just going to completely ruin the place.</p>
<p>Well, I have a testimonial. Christopher Hitchens, a devout atheist, if I could say so, was a</p>
<p>friend of yours and referred to you as, quote, one of the greatest living Americans and stated</p>
<p>that you were one of the most devout believers he has ever met. He further stated that you</p>
<p>were sequencing the genome of the cancer that would ultimately claim his life and that your</p>
<p>friendship, despite their differing opinions on religion, was an example of the greatest</p>
<p>confirmed truth in modern times.</p>
<p>What did you learn from Christopher Hitchens about life or perhaps what is a fond memory</p>
<p>you have of this man with whom you&rsquo;ve disagreed, but who is also your friend?</p>
<p>Yeah, I loved Hitch. I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s gone. Iron sharpens iron. There&rsquo;s nothing better</p>
<p>for trying to figure out where you are with your own situation and your own opinions,</p>
<p>your own worldviews, than encountering somebody who&rsquo;s completely in another space and who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got the gift, as Hitch did, of challenging everything and doing so over a glass of scotch</p>
<p>or two or three.</p>
<p>We got off to a rough start in an interaction we had at a rather highbrow dinner. He was</p>
<p>really deeply insulting of a question I was asking. I was like, okay, that&rsquo;s fine. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>figure out how we could have a more civil conversation. Then I really learned to greatly</p>
<p>admire his intellect and to find the jousting with him. It wasn&rsquo;t all about faith, although</p>
<p>it often was. It was really inspiring and innovating, energizing.</p>
<p>Then when he got cancer, I became his ally, trying to help him find pathways through the</p>
<p>various options and maybe helped him to stay around on this planet for an extra six months</p>
<p>or so. I have the warmest feelings of being in his apartment downtown over a glass of</p>
<p>wine talking about whatever. Sometimes it was science. He was fascinated by science.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was Thomas Jefferson. Sometimes it was faith. I knew it would always be really</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now gone. Do you think about your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to it. I don&rsquo;t want to rush it because I feel</p>
<p>like I got some things I can still do here. As a person of faith, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 71. I know I don&rsquo;t have an infinite amount of time left. I want to use the time I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got in some sort of way that matters. I&rsquo;m not ready to become a full time golfer, but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know what that is. I do feel that I&rsquo;ve had a chance to do amazingly powerful</p>
<p>things as far as experiences, and maybe God has something else in mind.</p>
<p>I wrote this book 16 years ago, The Language of God, about science and faith, trying to</p>
<p>explain how, from my perspective, these are compatible. These are in harmony. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>complementary if you are careful about which kind of question you&rsquo;re asking. To my surprise,</p>
<p>a lot of people seem to be interested in that. They were tired of hearing the extreme voices</p>
<p>like Dawkins at one end and people like Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis on the other end</p>
<p>saying, if you trust science, you&rsquo;re going to hell. They thought there must be a way</p>
<p>that these things could get along, and that&rsquo;s what I tried to put forward.</p>
<p>Then I started a foundation, BioLogos, which then I had to step away from to become NIH</p>
<p>director, which has just flourished, maybe because I stepped away. I don&rsquo;t know. It</p>
<p>now has millions of people who come to that website and they run amazing meetings. I think</p>
<p>a lot of people have really come to a sense that this is okay. I can love science and</p>
<p>I can love God, and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. So maybe there&rsquo;s something more I can do in</p>
<p>that space. Maybe that book is ready for a second edition.</p>
<p>I think so. But when you look back, life is finite. What do you hope your legacy is?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. This whole legacy thing is a little bit hard to embrace. It feels a little</p>
<p>self promoting, doesn&rsquo;t it? I sort of feel like in many ways, I went to my own funeral</p>
<p>on October 5th when I announced that I was stepping down and I got the most amazing responses</p>
<p>from people, some of whom I knew really well, some of whom I didn&rsquo;t know at all, who were</p>
<p>just telling me stories about something that I had contributed to that made a difference</p>
<p>to them. That was incredibly heartwarming, and that&rsquo;s enough. I don&rsquo;t want to build</p>
<p>an edifice. I don&rsquo;t have a plan for a monument or a statue. God help us.</p>
<p>I do feel like I&rsquo;ve been incredibly fortunate. I&rsquo;ve had the chance to play a role in things</p>
<p>that were pretty profound from the Genome Project to NIH to COVID vaccines, and I ought</p>
<p>to be plenty satisfied that I&rsquo;ve had enough experiences here to feel pretty good about</p>
<p>the way in which my life panned out.</p>
<p>We did a bunch of difficult questions in this conversation. Let me ask the most difficult</p>
<p>one, that perhaps is the reason you turned to God. What is the meaning of life? Have</p>
<p>you figured it out yet?</p>
<p>Expect me to put that into three sentences.</p>
<p>We only have a couple of minutes. At least hurry up.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s not a question that I think science helps me with, so you&rsquo;re going to push me</p>
<p>into the faith zone, which is where I&rsquo;d want to go with that. What is the meaning? Why</p>
<p>are we here? What are we put here to do? I do believe we&rsquo;re here for just a blink of</p>
<p>an eye and that our existence somehow goes on beyond that in a way that I don&rsquo;t entirely</p>
<p>understand despite efforts to do so. I think we are called upon in this blink of an eye</p>
<p>to try to make the world a better place, to try to love people, to try to do a better</p>
<p>job of our more altruistic instincts and less of our selfish instincts, to try to be what</p>
<p>God calls us to be, people who are holy, not people who are driven by self indulgence.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;m better at that than others. But I think that for me as a Christian is</p>
<p>a pretty clear, I mean, it&rsquo;s to live out the Sermon on the Mount. Once I read that,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t unread it. All those beatitudes, all the blessings, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to do. And the meaning of life is to strive for that standard, recognizing you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to fail over and over again, and that God forgives you. Hopefully to put a little bit</p>
<p>of love out there into the world. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about. Francis, I&rsquo;m truly humbled and</p>
<p>inspired by both your brilliance and your humility and that you would spend your extremely</p>
<p>valuable time with me today. It was really an honor. Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>I was glad to. And you asked a really good question. So your reputation as the best podcaster</p>
<p>has borne itself out here this afternoon. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to</p>
<p>this conversation with Francis Collins. To support this podcast, please check out our</p>
<p>sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Isaac Newton</p>
<p>reflecting on his life and work. I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore</p>
<p>and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary.</p>
<p>Whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. Thank you for listening and hope</p>
<p>to see you next time.</p>
