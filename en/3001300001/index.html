<p>YOU&rsquo;RE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE ON C-SPAN 3.</p>
<p>THIS MORNING ON CAPITOL HILL THE CEO OF TIKTOK, SHOU ZI CHEW</p>
<p>IS TESTIFYING ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY&rsquo;S DATA SECURITY</p>
<p>PRACTICES AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>IT IS EXPECTED TO TELL LAWMAKERS THAT BANNING THE APP</p>
<p>IN THE U.S. WOULD HURT AMERICAN BUSINESSES, AND THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p>YOU ARE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE HERE ON C-SPAN 3.</p>
<p>THIS MORNING ON CAPITOL HILL, THE CEO OF TIKTOK, SHOU ZI CHEW</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S TESTIFYING ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES &ndash;</p>
<p>PRACTICES IN RELATION TO PUT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>HE&rsquo;S EXPECTED TO TELL LAWMAKERS THAT BANNING THE APP IN THE</p>
<p>U.S. WOULD HURT AMERICAN BUSINESSES, AND THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p>YOU&rsquo;RE WATCHING LIVE COVERAGE HERE ON C-SPAN THREE.</p>
<p>THE COMMITTEE WILL COME TO ORDER.</p>
<p>BEFORE I BEGAN I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE</p>
<p>GUEST IN THE AUDIENCE. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR</p>
<p>COMING. WE THINK ENGAGED CITIZENS ARE</p>
<p>WELCOME AND A VALUABLE PART OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS.</p>
<p>I DO WANT TO REMIND THE CAST IN THE AUDIENCE THAT THE CHAIR IS</p>
<p>OBLIGED, UNDER THE HOUSE RULES AND THE RULES OF THE COMMITTEE,</p>
<p>TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND PRESERVE DECORUM IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM.</p>
<p>I KNOW THAT WE HAVE DEEP FEELINGS ON THESE ISSUES, AND</p>
<p>THAT WE MAY NOT AGREE ON EVERYTHING, BUT I ASKED BY WE</p>
<p>ABIDE BY THE RULES AND BE RESPECTFUL OF OUR AUDIENCE</p>
<p>MEMBERS, OUR VIEWERS, AND OUR WITNESSES.</p>
<p>THE CHAIR APPRECIATES THE AUDIENCE COOPERATION IN</p>
<p>MAINTAINING ORDER AS WE HAVE A FULL DISCUSSION ON THESE</p>
<p>IMPORTANT ISSUES. THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES HERSELF</p>
<p>FOR FIVE MINUTES FOR AN OPENING STATEMENT.</p>
<p>MR. CHU YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED THE</p>
<p>TRUTH ABOUT THE THREAT TIKTOK POSES TO OUR NATIONAL AND</p>
<p>PERSONAL SECURITY. TIKTOK COLLECTS NEARLY EVERY</p>
<p>DATA POINT IMAGINABLE, FROM PEOPLES LOCATION, TO WHAT THEY</p>
<p>TYPE, AND COPY. WHO THEY TALK TO.</p>
<p>BIOMETRIC DATA, AND MORE. EVEN IF THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN ON</p>
<p>TIKTOK, YOUR TRACKERS ARE EMBEDDED ON SITES ACROSS THE</p>
<p>WEB. TAKE TOPS OF AILS US ALL.</p>
<p>THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IS ABLE TO USE THIS AS A TOOL TO</p>
<p>MANIPULATE AMERICA AS A WHOLE. WE DO NOT TRUST TIKTOK WILL</p>
<p>EVER EMBRACE AMERICAN VALUES. VALUES FOR FREEDOM, HUMAN</p>
<p>RIGHTS, AND INNOVATION. TIKTOK HAS REPEATEDLY CHOSEN A</p>
<p>PATH FOR MORE CONTROL, MORE SURVEILLANCE, AND MORE</p>
<p>MANIPULATION. YOUR PLATFORM SHOULD BE BANNED.</p>
<p>I EXPECT TODAY HE WILL SAY ANYTHING TO AVOID THIS OUTCOME.</p>
<p>YOU ARE 100% RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT TIKTOK DOES.</p>
<p>YOU SUDDENLY ENDORSE A NATIONAL DATA PRIVACY STANDARD.</p>
<p>THAT PROJECT TEXAS IS MORE THAN A MARKETING SCHEME, THAT TIKTOK</p>
<p>DOESN&rsquo;T HARM OUR INNOCENT CHILDREN.</p>
<p>YOUR TIES TO THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY THROUGH</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE IS JUST A MYTH. WE ARE NOT BUYING IT.</p>
<p>IN FACT WHEN YOU CELEBRATE THE 150 MILLION AMERICAN USERS ON</p>
<p>TIKTOK, IT EMPHASIZES THE URGENCY FOR CONGRESS TO ACT.</p>
<p>THAT IS 150 MILLION AMERICANS THAT CCP CAN COLLECT SENSITIVE</p>
<p>INFORMATION ON, AND CONTROL WHAT WE ULTIMATELY SEE, HERE,</p>
<p>AND BELIEVE. TIKTOK HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN</p>
<p>CAUGHT IN THE LIE THAT IT DID NOT ANSWER TO THE CCP THROUGH</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE. TODAY, THE CCP&rsquo;S LAWS REQUIRE</p>
<p>CHINESE COMPANIES LIKE BYTEDANCE TO SPY ON THEIR</p>
<p>BEHALF. THAT MEANS THAT ANY CHINESE</p>
<p>COMPANY MUST GRANT THE CCP ACCESS, AND MANIPULATION</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES, AS A DESIGN FEATURE.</p>
<p>RIGHT NOW BYTEDANCE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE DOJ FOR</p>
<p>SURVEILLING AMERICAN JOURNALISTS, BOTH DIGITAL</p>
<p>ACTIVITY AND PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS THROUGH TIKTOK.</p>
<p>WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF YOUR EMPLOYEES STILL REPORT DIRECTLY</p>
<p>TO BEIJING. INTERNAL RECORDING REVEALS</p>
<p>THERE IS A BACK DOOR FOR CHINA TO ACCESS USER DATA ACROSS THE</p>
<p>PLATFORM. YOUR EMPLOYEES SAID, QUOTE,</p>
<p>EVERYTHING IS SEEN IN CHINA. A GATEWAY TO SPY IS NOT THE</p>
<p>ONLY WAY THAT TIKTOK AND BYTEDANCE CAN DO THE BIDDING OF</p>
<p>THE CCP. TIKTOK HAS HELPED ERASE EVENTS,</p>
<p>AND PEOPLE. CHINA WANTS THE WORLD TO FORGET.</p>
<p>IT HAS EVEN CENSORED AN AMERICAN TEENAGER WHO EXPOSED</p>
<p>CCPCS GENOCIDE AND TORTURE OF UYGHUR MUSLIMS.</p>
<p>THE FACTS SHOW THAT BYTEDANCE IS BEHOLDEN TO THE CCP.</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE AND TIKTOK ARE ONE IN THE SAME.</p>
<p>TIKTOK ALSO TARGETS OUR CHILDREN.</p>
<p>THE FOR YOU ALL FOR THEM IS A TOOL FOR TIKTOK TO OWN THEIR</p>
<p>ATTENTION AND PRAY ON THEIR INNOCENCE.</p>
<p>WITHIN MINUTES OF CREATING A COW, YOUR ALGORITHM CAN PROMOTE</p>
<p>SUICIDE, SELF HARM, AND EATING DISORDERS TO CHILDREN.</p>
<p>ENCOURAGES CHALLENGES FOR THEM TO PUT THEIR LIVES IN DANGER.</p>
<p>IT ALLOWS ADULTS TO PRAY ON OUR BEAUTIFUL, BELOVED, DAUGHTERS.</p>
<p>IT IS ALSO A PORTAL FOR DRUG DEALERS TO SELL ILLICIT</p>
<p>FENTANYL THAT CHINA HAS BANNED YET ISN&rsquo;T HELPING MEXICAN</p>
<p>CARTELS PRODUCE, AND ACROSS OUR BORDER, AND POISON OUR</p>
<p>CHILDREN. IN CHINA, THE CCP PROACTIVELY</p>
<p>PROHIBITS THIS TYPE OF TIKTOK CONTENT THAT PROMOTES DEATH AND</p>
<p>DESPAIR TO KIDS. FROM THE DATA IT COLLECTS TO</p>
<p>THE CONTINENT CONTROLS, TIKTOK IS A GRAVE THREAT OF FOREIGN</p>
<p>INFLUENCE ON AMERICAN LIFE. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT IT&rsquo;S A</p>
<p>LIKE ALLOWING THE SOVIET UNION THE POWER TO PRODUCE 70 MORNING</p>
<p>CARTOONS DURING THE COLD WAR. YET MUCH MORE POWERFUL IN MUCH</p>
<p>MORE DANGEROUS. BANNING YOUR PLATFORM WILL</p>
<p>ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE THREATS. MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS COMMITTEE</p>
<p>IS ALSO LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. AMERICA NEEDS TO BE PREPARED TO</p>
<p>STOP THE NEXT TECHNOLOGICAL TOOL OR WEAPON CHANNEL USED FOR</p>
<p>ITS OWN STRATEGIC GAIN. WE MUST PREVENT ANY APP,</p>
<p>WEBSITE, OR PLATFORMS LIKE TIKTOK FOREVER SPYING ON</p>
<p>AMERICANS AGAIN. WE MUST PROVIDE THE STRONGEST</p>
<p>PROTECTIONS POSSIBLE FOR OUR FUTURE CHILDREN.</p>
<p>THAT IS WHY THIS COMMITTEE IS LEANING ON A NATIONAL PRIVACY</p>
<p>AND DATA SECURITY STANDARD THAT RESTRICT SENSITIVE AMERICAN</p>
<p>DATA FROM REACHING OUR ADVERSARIES TO BEGIN WITH.</p>
<p>WHAT BIG TECH AND DATA BROKERS COLLECT, PROCESS, STORE, AND</p>
<p>SELL. IT MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR ANY</p>
<p>PLATFORM TO TRACK AND TARGET CHILDREN UNDER 17.</p>
<p>MR. CHEW, THE COMMITTEE HAS REQUESTED A TIKTOK APPEAR</p>
<p>BEFORE US FOR A LONG TIME. FOR THOSE WE SERVE WE ARE GLAD</p>
<p>THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME. TODAY THE WORLD IS WATCHING.</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE IS WATCHING. THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IS</p>
<p>WATCHING. THE ANSWERS YOU ALL OR TO THE</p>
<p>AMERICAN PEOPLE, A FREE PEOPLE, WHO CHERISH THEIR GOD GIVEN,</p>
<p>UNABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS</p>
<p>FOR ALL. THEY DESERVE THE TRUTH.</p>
<p>COMPLETE HONESTY IS THE STANDARD AND THE LAW THAT YOU</p>
<p>ARE BEING HELD TO BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE.</p>
<p>AS WE SEEK TO GET ANSWERS AND A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT</p>
<p>HAPPENS AT TIKTOK UNDER YOUR WATCH.</p>
<p>THANK YOU.</p>
<p>THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE RANKING MEMBER MR. PALLONE FOR</p>
<p>FIVE MINUTES. &raquo; THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.</p>
<p>LET ME SAY THAT I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID.</p>
<p>I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR AND TO THE ADAM AND HEAR COMMENTS</p>
<p>ON BEING A MOTHER AND YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CHILDREN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M GLAD THAT WE ARE HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY.</p>
<p>BIG TECH HAS TRANSFORMED THE INFORMATION SUPER HIGHWAY INTO</p>
<p>A SUPERSPREADER OF HARMFUL CONTENT, INVASIVE SURVEILLANCE</p>
<p>PRACTICES, AND ADDICTIVE DAMAGING DESIGN FEATURES.</p>
<p>DATA IS BIG TECH&rsquo;S MOST VALUABLE COMMODITY.</p>
<p>BY COLLECTING FOUR MORE YEARS ARE DATA THAN THEY NEED BIG</p>
<p>TECH PLATFORMS CAN USE, SHARE, AND SELL INFORMATION TO</p>
<p>GENERATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE.</p>
<p>TODAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE POWERLESS TO STOP THIS INVASION</p>
<p>ON THEIR PRIVACY. WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER AS A</p>
<p>COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL PRIVACY LEGISLATION THAT PUTS PEOPLE</p>
<p>BACK IN CONTROL OF THEIR DATA. WE MUST HOLD BIG TECH</p>
<p>ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS, TRANSPARENCY IS CRITICAL TO THE</p>
<p>ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT PASSABLE CONGRESSES, THIS</p>
<p>COMMUNITY HAS SERVED FROM SENIOR EXECUTIVE OF OTHER</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ABOUT TROUBLING AND REPEATED</p>
<p>INSTANCES WHERE THEY HAVE PUT PROFITS OVER PEOPLE.</p>
<p>NOW, TODAY, WE INTEND TO BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY TO TIKTOK.</p>
<p>WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY ITS BEIJING COMMUNIST-BASED COMPANY,</p>
<p>BRIGHT DANCE. AND WHILE TIC TAC RADIO</p>
<p>PROVIDING NEW FUN WAY FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR</p>
<p>CREATIVITY AND ENJOY THE VIDEOS OF OTHERS, THE PLATFORM ALSO</p>
<p>THREATENS THE HEALTH, PRIVACY, INSECURITY, OF THE AMERICAN</p>
<p>PEOPLE. I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT THE</p>
<p>BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE RISK THAT IT POSED TO AMERICANS AND ITS</p>
<p>PRESENT FORM. MORE THAN 130 MILLION PEOPLE IN</p>
<p>THE UNITED STATES USE TIKTOK EVERY MONTH, INCLUDING TWO</p>
<p>THIRDS OF AMERICAN TEENAGERS. TIKTOK COLLECTS AND COMPILES</p>
<p>THE TROVES OF VALUABLE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO CREATE AND</p>
<p>ADDICTIVE ALGORITHM THAT IS ABLE TO PREDICT, WITH UNCANNY</p>
<p>ACCURACY, WHICH VIDEOS WILL KEEP USERS SCROLLING EVEN IF</p>
<p>THE CONTENT IS HARMFUL, INACCURATE, OR FEEDS</p>
<p>DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR OR EXTREMIST BELIEFS.</p>
<p>THE COMBINATION OF TIKTOK BEIJING COMMUNIST CHINA</p>
<p>OWNERSHIP, AND ITS POPULARITY, EXACERBATES ITS DANGER TO OUR</p>
<p>COUNTRY AND TO ITS PRIVACY. THE COMMUNIST PARTY CAN COMPEL</p>
<p>COMPANIES BASED IN BEIJING, LIKE TIKTOK, TO SHARE DATA WITH</p>
<p>THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT TO EXISTING BEIJING LAW OR</p>
<p>COERCION. NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS ARE</p>
<p>SOUNDING THE ALARM, WARNING THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY COULD</p>
<p>REQUIRE TIKTOK TO COMPROMISED BY SECURITY, MALICIOUSLY ACCESS</p>
<p>AMERICAN USER DATA, PROMOTE PRO COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA, AND</p>
<p>UNDERMINE AMERICAN INTERESTS. DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS COULD</p>
<p>BE LAUNCHED BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT THROUGH</p>
<p>TIKTOK, WHICH HAS ALREADY BECOME RIFE WITH MISINFORMATION</p>
<p>AND DISINFORMATION, ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, AND HATE SPEECH.</p>
<p>A RECENT REPORT FOUND THAT 20% OF TIKTOK SEARCH RESULTS ON</p>
<p>PROMINENT NEWS TOPICS CONTAIN MISINFORMATION.</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIAS PROFITABILITY DEPENDS ON GROWTH AND</p>
<p>ENGAGEMENT. OR EYES ON CONTENT FOR LONGER</p>
<p>TIME LEADS TO LONGER REVENUE GENERATION IN ADVERTISING</p>
<p>DOLLARS. EXISTING ALGORITHMS ARE</p>
<p>FINE-TUNED OUT MIGHT GROWTH AN ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT NECESSARILY</p>
<p>TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL HARM TO USERS.</p>
<p>CHILDREN AND TEENS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE.</p>
<p>FREQUENT ONLINE VIEWS OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA ON DIGITAL</p>
<p>DEVICES IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LEVELS OF DEPRESSION</p>
<p>AMONG MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.</p>
<p>RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT TIKTOKS ADDICTIVE ALGORITHM RECOMMEND</p>
<p>VIDEOS TO TEENS THAT CREATE AND EXACERBATE FEELINGS OF</p>
<p>EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, INCLUDING VIDEOS PROMOTING SUICIDE, SELF</p>
<p>HARM, AND EATING DISORDERS. PUBLIC OUTRAGE AND HOLLOW</p>
<p>APOLOGIES ALONE ARE NOT GOING TO RAIN IN BIG TECH.</p>
<p>CONGRESS HAS TO ENACT LAWS PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC</p>
<p>FROM SUCH ONLINE HARMS. WE SIMPLY CANNOT WAIT ANY</p>
<p>LONGER TO PASS THE COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY</p>
<p>LEGISLATION THAT I AUTHORED WITH, THEN RANKING MEMBER NOW</p>
<p>CHAIRS ROGERS LAST CONGRESS THAT OVERWHELMINGLY ADVANCED</p>
<p>OUT OF THE COMMITTEE. IT ENSURE THAT COMPANIES,</p>
<p>WHEREVER THEY LIVE &ndash; IT ENSURES, I SHOULD SAY, THAT</p>
<p>CONSUMERS WHEREVER THEY LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY WILL HAVE</p>
<p>MEANINGFUL CONTROL OVER THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
<p>OUR LEGISLATION ESTABLISHES BASELINE DATA MINIMIZATION</p>
<p>STRATEGIES ENSURING THAT COMPANIES ONLY COLLECT, PROCESS,</p>
<p>AND TRANSFER DATA NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A SERVICE.</p>
<p>IT PROVIDES HEIGHTENED PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN IN</p>
<p>TEENAGERS. I THINK THAT IT IS TIME TO MAKE</p>
<p>THIS LEGISLATION THE LAW OF THE LAND.</p>
<p>WE ALSO HAVE TO EXAMINE THE REFORMS NEEDED FOR SECTION 230</p>
<p>OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACTS.</p>
<p>THE LIABILITY SHIELD FOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAS, FOR TWO,</p>
<p>LONG BEEN ABUSED AND LED TO A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. SO, I HOPE WE CAN FIND A</p>
<p>BIPARTISAN PATH FORWARD ON THAT ISSUE, AS WELL.</p>
<p>I THINK YOU ARE HAVING A HEARING NEXT WEEK ON.</p>
<p>TO STOP THE VERY YEAR HARM TO OUR COUNTRY AND DEMOCRACY UNDER</p>
<p>THE CURRENT LAWS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE</p>
<p>DISCUSSION TODAY AS WE CONTINUE TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY TO BIG</p>
<p>TECH. LET ME SAY TO MR. CHEW, I KNOW</p>
<p>THAT THIS IS ABOUT TIKTOK. I AM FOCUSING ALL OF MY</p>
<p>ATTENTION, NOT ONLY ON TIKTOK, BUT ON THESE WIND CONCERNS</p>
<p>ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA. AND THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY.</p>
<p>WITH THAT, I YIELD BACK. THANK YOU, AGAIN, MADAM CHAIR</p>
<p>FOR HAVING THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OUR WITNESS TODAY IS MR. SHOU CHEW, CHIEF EXECUTIVE</p>

</blockquote>
<p>OFFICER OF TIKTOK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE</p>
<p>MINUTES. &raquo; THANK YOU.</p>
<p>CHAIR ROGERS, RANKING MEMBER PALLONE, MEMBERS OF THE</p>
<p>COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.</p>
<p>I AM SHOU CHEW AND I&rsquo;M FROM SUING THE BORDER.</p>
<p>THAT IS WHERE I WAS BORN AS WELL AS MY PARENTS.</p>
<p>AFTER SERVING IN SINGAPORE&rsquo;S MILITARY, I MOVED TO THE UK TO</p>
<p>ATTEND COLLEGE AND THEN HERE TO THE U.S. TO ATTEND BUSINESS</p>
<p>SCHOOL. I ACTUALLY MET MY WIFE HERE.</p>
<p>BY THE WAY, SHE WAS JUST BORN A FEW MILES AWAY FROM HERE IN</p>
<p>VIRGINIA. TWO YEARS AGO I BECAME THE CEO</p>
<p>OF TIKTOK. TODAY, WE HAVE MORE THAN A</p>
<p>BILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS AROUND THE WORLD.</p>
<p>INCLUDING OVER 150 MILLION IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>OUR APP IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE CREATIVE AND CURIOUS.</p>
<p>WE&rsquo;RE CLOSE TO 5 MILLION AMERICAN BUSINESSES, MOSTLY</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESSES, GO TO FIND NEW CUSTOMERS AND TO FUEL THEIR</p>
<p>GROWTH. AS TIKTOK AS WELL, WE HAVE</p>
<p>TRIED TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE</p>
<p>US, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SAFETY OF TEENAGERS.</p>
<p>WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ON TIKTOK ARE OVER 18,</p>
<p>AND ONE OF OUR FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHICS ARE PEOPLE OVER</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ADOPTING</li>
</ol>
<p>MEASURES TO PROTECT TEENAGERS. MANY OF THOSE MEASURES ARE</p>
<p>FIRST FOR THE SOCIAL MEDIA INDUSTRY.</p>
<p>WE FORBID DIRECT MESSAGING FOR PEOPLE UNDER 16.</p>
<p>AND WE HAVE A 16 MINUTE WATCH TIME BY DEFAULT FOR THOSE UNDER</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>WE HAVE A SWEET A FAMILY PAYING</li>
</ol>
<p>TOOLS SO THAT PARENTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN THEIR TEENS</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE, AND MAKE THE CHOICES THAT ARE RIGHT FOR</p>
<p>THEIR FAMILY. WE WANT TIKTOK TO BE A PLACE</p>
<p>WHERE TEENAGERS CAN COME TO LEARN, WHICH IS WHY WE RECENTLY</p>
<p>LAUNCHED A FEED THAT EXCLUSIVELY FEATURES</p>
<p>EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS ABOUT STEM. STEM VIDEOS ALREADY HAVE OVER</p>
<p>116 BILLION VIEWS ON TIKTOK. AND I THINK TECH TALK IS</p>
<p>INSPIRING A NEW GENERATION TO DISCOVER A PASSION FOR MATH AND</p>
<p>SCIENCE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT</p>
<p>NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE RAISED, THAT WE TAKE</p>
<p>VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY. LET ME START BY ADDRESSING A</p>
<p>FEW MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT BYTEDANCE, WHICH WE ARE A</p>
<p>SUBSIDIARY. BYTEDANCE IS NOT OWNED OR</p>
<p>CONTROLLED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S A PRIVATE COMPANY. 60% OF THE COMPANY IS OWNED BY</p>
<p>GLOBAL INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. 20% IS OWNED BY THE FOUNDER AT</p>
<p>20% OWNED BY EMPLOYEES AROUND THE WORLD.</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE HAS FIVE BOARD MEMBERS, AND THREE OF THEM ARE</p>
<p>AMERICAN. YOU KNOW, TIKTOK ITSELF IS NOT</p>
<p>AVAILABLE IN MAINLAND CHINA. WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN LOS</p>
<p>ANGELES AND IN SINGAPORE, AND WE HAVE 7000 EMPLOYEES IN THE</p>
<p>U.S. TODAY. STILL, WE HAVE HEARD IMPORTANT</p>
<p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR UNWANTED FOREIGN ACCESS TO</p>
<p>U.S. DATA, AND POTENTIAL MANIPULATION OF THE TIKTOK U.S.</p>
<p>ECOSYSTEM. OUR APPROACH HAS NEVER BEEN TO</p>
<p>DISMISS OR TRIVIALIZE ANY OF THESE CONCERNS.</p>
<p>WE HAVE ADDRESSED THEM WITH REAL ACTION.</p>
<p>NOW, THAT IS WHAT WE&rsquo;VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS,</p>
<p>BUILDING WHAT AMOUNTS TO A FIREWALL THAT SEALS OFF</p>
<p>PROTECTED U.S. USER DATA FROM UNAUTHORIZED FOREIGN ACCESS.</p>
<p>THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS, AMERICAN DATA STORED ON</p>
<p>AMERICAN SOIL BY AN AMERICAN COMPANY OVERSEEN BY AMERICAN</p>
<p>PERSONNEL. WE CALL THIS INITIATIVE PROJECT</p>
<p>TEXAS. THAT IS WHERE ORACLE IS</p>
<p>HEADQUARTERED. TODAY, U.S. TIKTOK DATA IS</p>
<p>STORED BY DEFAULT IN ORACLE SERVICE.</p>
<p>ONLY VETTED PERSONNEL OPERATING IN A NEW COMPANY CALLED TIKTOK</p>
<p>U.S. DATA SECURITY CAN CONTROL ACCESS TO THIS DATA.</p>
<p>ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE PLANS FOR THIS COMPANY TO REPORT TO HIM</p>
<p>AND DEPENDED AMERICAN BOARD WITH STRONG SECURITY</p>
<p>CREDENTIALS. NOW, THERE IS STILL SOME WORK</p>
<p>TO DO. WE HAVE LEGACY U.S. DATA</p>
<p>SITTING IN OUR SERVICE IN VIRGINIA AND SINGAPORE.</p>
<p>WE ARE LEADING THOSE AND WE EXPECT THAT TO BE COMPLETE THIS</p>
<p>YEAR. WHEN THAT IS DONE, ALL</p>
<p>PROTECTED U.S. DATA WILL BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF U.S.</p>
<p>LAW, AND UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE U.S. LED SECURITY TEAM.</p>
<p>THIS ELIMINATES THE CONCERN THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE SHARED</p>
<p>WITH ME, THAT TIKTOK USER DATA CAN BE SUBJECT TO CHINESE LAW.</p>
<p>THIS GOES FURTHER, BY THE WAY, THAT WHAT ANY OTHER COMPANY IN</p>
<p>OUR INDUSTRY HAS DONE. WE ALSO PROVIDE UNPRECEDENTED</p>
<p>TRANSPARENCY AND SECURITY FOR THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE TIKTOK</p>
<p>APP AND RECOMMENDATION ENGINE. THIRD-PARTY VALIDATORS LIKE</p>
<p>ORACLE AND OTHERS WILL REVIEW AND VALIDATE OUR SOURCE CODE</p>
<p>AND ALGORITHMS. THIS WILL HELP ENSURE THE</p>
<p>INTEGRITY OF THE CODE THAT POWERS WHAT AMERICANS SEE ON</p>
<p>OUR APP. WE WILL FURTHER PROVIDE ACCESS</p>
<p>TO RESEARCHERS, WHICH HELP THEM STUDY AND MONITOR OUR CONTENT</p>
<p>ECOSYSTEM. NOW, WE BELIEVE WE ARE THE ONLY,</p>
<p>THE ONLY COMPANY, THAT OFFERS THIS LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY.</p>
<p>TRUST IS ABOUT THE ACTIONS WE TAKE.</p>
<p>WE HAVE TO EARN THEIR TRUST WITH THE DECISIONS WE MAKE FOR</p>
<p>OUR COMPANY AND OUR PRODUCT. THE POTENTIAL SECURITY, PRIVACY,</p>
<p>CONTENT MANIPULATION CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT TIKTOK ARE REALLY</p>
<p>NOT UNIQUE TO US. THE SAME ISSUES APPLY TO OTHER</p>
<p>COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE WHAT IS NEEDED ARE</p>
<p>CLEAR TRANSPARENT RULES THAT APPLY BROADLY TO ALL TECH</p>
<p>COMPANIES. OWNERSHIP IS NOT AT THE GORE OF</p>
<p>ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS. NOW, AS I CONCLUDE THERE ARE</p>
<p>MORE THAN 150 MILLION AMERICANS WHO LOVE OUR PLATFORM.</p>
<p>AND WE KNOW WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THEM.</p>
<p>THAT IS WHY I&rsquo;M MAKING THE FOLLOWING COMMITMENTS TO YOU,</p>
<p>AND TO OTTAWA OR USERS. NUMBER ONE, WE WILL KEEP SAFETY,</p>
<p>PARTICULARLY FOR TEENAGERS, AS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US.</p>
<p>NUMBER TWO, WE WILL FIREWALL PROTECT THE U.S. DATA FROM</p>
<p>UNWANTED FOREIGN ACCESS. NUMBER THREE, TIKTOK WILL</p>
<p>REMAIN A PLACE FOR FREE EXPRESSION AND WILL NOT BE</p>
<p>MANIPULATED BY ANY GOVERNMENT. AND FOURTH, WE WILL BE</p>
<p>TRANSPARENT AND WE WILL GET ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY</p>
<p>INDEPENDENT MONITORS WHO REMAIN ACCOUNTABLE &ndash;</p>
<p>TO REMAIN ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUR COMMITMENTS.</p>
<p>I WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR ANY FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAVE AND LOOK</p>
<p>FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>

<p>SUBJECT TO TITLE 18, SECTION 1001, OF THE UNITED STATES</p>

<p>ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS WORK OR ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE CHINESE</p>
<p>COMMUNIST PARTY AND ARE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS AT BYTEDANCE, A</p>
<p>COMPANY WHERE YOU PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL</p>
<p>OFFICER, AND WHERE YOU REGULARLY COMMUNICATE WITH</p>
<p>THEIR CEO. TIKTOK HAS TOLD US THAT YOU ARE</p>
<p>NOT SHARING DATA WITH THE CCP, WHAT LEAKED AUDIO FROM WITHIN</p>
<p>TIKTOK HAS PROVEN OTHERWISE. TIKTOK TOLD US THAT YOU WERE</p>
<p>NOT TRACKING THE GEOLOCATION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS.</p>
<p>YOU ARE. TIKTOK TOLD US YOU WERE NOT</p>
<p>SPYING ON JOURNALISTS. YOU WERE.</p>
<p>IN YOUR TESTIMONY, YOU STATE THAT BYTEDANCE IS NOT BEHOLDEN</p>
<p>TO THE CCP. AGAIN, EACH OF THE INDIVIDUALS</p>
<p>I LISTED ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY</p>
<p>INCLUDING SONG COOPING, WHO WAS REPORTED TO BE THE COMMUNIST</p>
<p>PARTY SECRETARY OF BIDEN&rsquo;S, AND HAS CALLED FOR THE &ndash;</p>
<p>TO TAKE THE LEAD ACROSS ALL PARTY LINES TO ENSURE THAT</p>
<p>ALGORITHM IS ENFORCED BY, QUOTE, CORRECT POLITICAL DIRECTION.</p>
<p>JUST THIS MORNING, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED THAT</p>
<p>THE CCP IS OPPOSED TO A FORCED SALE OF TIKTOK BY BYTEDANCE,</p>
<p>QUOTING A CCP SPOKESMAN AS SAYING THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>WOULD MAKE A DECISION REGARDING ANY SALE OF TIKTOK.</p>
<p>SO THE CCP BELIEVES THEY HAVE THE FINAL SAY OVER YOUR</p>
<p>COMPANY. I HAVE ZERO CONFIDENCE IN YOUR</p>
<p>ASSERTION THAT BIDEN AND TIKTOK ARE NOT BEHOLDEN TO THE CCP.</p>
<p>NEXT QUESTION. HEATING CONTENT IS A WAY OF</p>
<p>PROMOTING AND MODERATING CONTENT.</p>
<p>IN YOUR CART OR PREVIOUS POSITIONS WITHIN CHINESE</p>
<p>COMPANIES, HAVE EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN HEATING CONTENT FOR</p>
<p>USERS OUTSIDE OF CHINA? BREAK LIKELIEST, OR NO.</p>

<p>A BAN IS ONLY SHORT TERM WAY TO ADDRESS TIKTOK, AND A DATA</p>
<p>PRIVACY BILL IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP TIKTOK FROM EVER HAPPENING</p>
<p>AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES. I YIELD BACK.</p>
<p>I NOW YIELD TO THE RANKING MEMBER FOR FIVE MINUTES.</p>

<p>MR. CHEW, THAT I DON&rsquo;T FIND WHAT YOU SUGGESTED WITH PROJECT</p>
<p>TEXAS AND THIS FIRE WALL THAT IS BEING SUGGESTED, TO WEBER,</p>
<p>WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO ME. IN OTHER WORDS, I STILL BELIEVE</p>
<p>THAT THE BEIJING COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT WILL STILL CONTROL</p>
<p>AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE WHAT YOU DO.</p>
<p>SO THIS IDEA THIS PROJECT TEXAS IS SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p>ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT, TIKTOK IS ON TARGET TO MAKE</p>

<p>RESPECTFULLY, AS A PRIVATE COMPANY WE WILL NOT DISCLOSE</p>
<p>THAT. &raquo; OKAY, LOOK, THE IMPRESSION</p>

<p>I MEAN THIS IS A BENIGN COMPANY THAT IS JUST PERFORMING A</p>
<p>PUBLIC SERVICE. MAYBE THAT&rsquo;S NOT WHAT YOU ARE</p>
<p>SAYING, BUT I DON&rsquo;T BUY IT. RIGHT?</p>
<p>MY CONCERN HERE IS PRIMARILY ABOUT THE PRIVACY ISSUE.</p>
<p>THE FACT THAT TIKTOK IS MAKING ALL KINDS OF MONEY BY</p>
<p>COLLECTING AND GATHERING PRIVATE INFORMATION ABOUT</p>
<p>AMERICANS THAT THEY DON&rsquo;T NEED FOR THEIR BUSINESS PURPOSES AND</p>
<p>THEN SELECT. I MENTIONED THIS LEGISLATION</p>
<p>THE CHAIR AND I HAVE, THAT WOULD MINIMIZE DATA COLLECTION,</p>
<p>AND MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR TIKTOK AND OTHER COMPANIES</p>
<p>TO DO THAT? IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME</p>
<p>COMMITMENTS TODAY, ONE ISSUE COMMITMENTS WITH REGARD TO THE</p>
<p>LEGISLATIONS? YOU ARE GOING TO TELL ME THE</p>
<p>BILL IS NOT PASSED, THEREFORE I DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO DO IT, LET ME</p>
<p>KNOW YOU SAY YOU ARE BENIGN AND WANT TO DO GOOD THINGS FOR THE</p>
<p>PUBLIC. SO LET ME ASK YOU, WHAT ABOUT A</p>
<p>COMMITMENT THAT SAYS THAT YOU WON&rsquo;T SELL THE DATA YOU COLLECT?</p>
<p>WOULD YOU COMMIT TO THAT, NOT SELLING THE DATA YOU COLLECTED?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, I BELIEVE WE DON&rsquo;T SELL DATA TO ANY DATA</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>BROKERS. &raquo; YOU DON&rsquo;T SELL TO ANYONE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE DON&rsquo;T SELL DATA TO DATA BROKERS.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I DID NOT ASK DATA BROKERS, I ASKED TO ANYONE?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>IN OTHER WORDS, UNDER OUR BILL YOU CAN ONLY USE THE DATA FOR</p>
<p>YOUR OWN PURPOSES. NOT TO SELL IT TO ANYONE.</p>
<p>WOULD YOU COMMIT TO NOT SELLING THEIR DATA TO ANYONE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, I ACTUALLY AM IN SUPPORT OF SOME RULES.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I DID NOT ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WERE &ndash;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I ASKED YOU WHETHER THE COMPANY TIKTOK WOULD COMMIT TO NOT</p>
<p>SELLING ITS DATA TO ANYONE AND JUST USED FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES</p>
<p>INTERNALLY? &raquo; I CAN GET BACK YOU&rsquo;RE ON THE</p>
<p>DETAILS. &raquo; OKAY, GET BACK TO ME.</p>
<p>ALL RIGHT, ANOTHER THING THAT IS IN OUR BILL SAYS THAT WE</p>
<p>WOULD PROHIBIT TARGETING MARKETING TO PEOPLE UNDER THE</p>
<p>AGE OF 17. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO AGREE</p>
<p>TO PROHIBIT TARGETED MARKETING TO PEOPLE, AMERICANS UNDER THE</p>
<p>AGE OF 17? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE</p>
<p>ACTUALLY STRICT RULES FOR ADVERTISERS IN TERMS OF WHAT</p>
<p>THEY CONSTITUTE &ndash; &raquo; DO YOU, WOULD YOU BE WILLING</p>
<p>TO PROHIBIT TARGETED MARKETING TO THOSE UNDER 17?</p>
<p>THAT IS WHAT IS IN OUR BILL. &raquo; I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE&rsquo;S</p>
<p>SOME TALK AND LEGISLATION AROUND THE COUNTRY &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AGAIN, I WANTED YOU TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT WITHOUT THE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>LEGISLATION SINCE YOU SAY YOU ARE A GOOD COMPANY AND WANT TO</p>
<p>DO GOOD THINGS. WHY NOT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT IS SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO AND GET BACK TO YOU TOO.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OKAY, I APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY, WE ALSO HAVE AN HOUR BILL</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A REQUIREMENT OF HEIGHTENED PROTECTION FOR SENSITIVE DATA.</p>
<p>IN PARTICULAR, LOCATION AND HEALTH DATA.</p>
<p>WOULD YOU COMMIT NOT GATHERING WORK DEALING WITH LOCATION OR</p>
<p>HEALTH DATA UNLESS YOU GET AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT FROM THE</p>
<p>CONSUMER? IN OTHER WORDS, UNDER OUR BILL</p>
<p>THOSE ARE CATEGORIZED AS SENSITIVE.</p>
<p>UNLESS THE PERSON SPECIFICALLY SAYS I WANT YOU TO COLLECT THAT</p>
<p>DATA, YOU WOULDN&rsquo;T BE ABLE TO, LOCATION AND HEALTH DATA.</p>
<p>WOULD YOU COMMIT TO THAT? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, IN PRINCIPLE I</p>
<p>SUPPORT THAT. BY THE WAY, WE DO NOT COLLECT</p>
<p>PRECISE GPS DATA AT THIS POINT. AND I DO NOT BELIEVE WE COLLECT</p>
<p>ANY HEALTH DATA. &raquo; OKAY, SO YOU WOULD BE</p>
<p>WILLING TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT THAT FROM NOW WHAT YOU WANT</p>
<p>COLLECT LOCATION OR HEALTH DATA WITHOUT, YOU&rsquo;RE SAYING AT ALL,</p>
<p>IS THAT RIGHT? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS DATA</p>
<p>THAT IS FREQUENTLY COLLECTED BY MANY OTHER COMPANIES.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I KNOW WHAT THEIR COMPANIES DO IT.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I DON&rsquo;T THINK THEY SHOULD WITHOUT AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT.</p>
<p>YOU SAID YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD ACTOR.</p>
<p>SO WHY NOT MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO ME TODAY?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE ARE COMMITTED TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT WITH OUR USERS</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ABOUT WHAT WE COLLECT. I DON&rsquo;T THINK WHAT WE COLLECT</p>
<p>&ndash; I DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE WHAT WE COLLECT</p>
<p>IS MORE THAN OTHER PLAYERS. &raquo; MY PROBLEM HERE IS YOU ARE</p>
<p>TRYING TO GIVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE GOING</p>
<p>TO MOVE AWAY FROM BEIJING IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY.</p>
<p>YOU ARE TRYING TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE A GOOD</p>
<p>ACTOR. BUT THE COMMITMENTS THAT WE</p>
<p>WOULD SEEK TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS FOR NOT BEING MADE</p>
<p>TONIGHT. THEY ARE JUST NOT BEING MADE.</p>
<p>YOU WILL CONTINUE TO GATHER DATA, YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SELL</p>
<p>DATA, YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS AND</p>
<p>CONTINUE TO BE UNDER THE &ndash; OF THE GUNMAN&rsquo;S PARTY THROUGH</p>
<p>YOUR, YOU KNOW, THE ORGANIZATION THAT OWNS YOU.</p>
<p>IN ANY CASE, THANK YOU, KRATOM CHAIR.</p>

<p>THANK YOU MR. FOR CHEW JOINING US TODAY.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I THINK WE&rsquo;VE HEARD YOU SAY MULTIPLE TIMES THAT TIKTOK IS</p>
<p>NOT A CHINESE COMPANY. THAT BYTEDANCE IS NOT A CHINESE</p>
<p>COMPANY. BUT ACCORDING TO AN ARTICLE IN</p>
<p>TODAY&rsquo;S WALL STREET JOURNAL, CHINA&rsquo;S COMMERCE MINISTRY SAID</p>
<p>THURSDAY THAT A SALE OR DIVESTITURE OF TIKTOK WOULD</p>
<p>INVOLVE EXPORTING TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE</p>
<p>CHINESE GOVERNMENT. CONTINUING TO QUOTE, THE</p>
<p>RE-BOARDED EFFORTS BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WOULD SEVERELY</p>
<p>UNDERMINE GLOBAL INVESTORS AKON &ndash;</p>
<p>CONFIDENCE IN THE U.S. SAID A MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN.</p>
<p>IF THAT IS TRUE, CHINA WILL FIRMLY OPPOSE IT, SHE SAID,</p>
<p>REFERRING TO THE FORCED SALE. SO DESPITE YOUR ASSERTIONS TO</p>
<p>THE CONTRARY, CHINA CERTAINLY THINKS IT IS IN CONTROL OF</p>
<p>TIKTOK AND ITS SOFTWARE. IS THAT NOT CORRECT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, TIKTOK IS NOT AVAILABLE IN MAINLAND CHINA.</p>

<p>TODAY WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES UNSINKABLE ARE, BUT</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M NOT SAYING THAT THE FOUNDERS OF BYTEDANCE ARE NOT</p>
<p>CHINESE, NOR AM I SAYING THAT WE DON&rsquo;T MAKE USE OF CHINESE</p>
<p>EMPLOYEES. JUST LIKE MANY OTHER COMPANIES</p>
<p>AROUND THE WORLD. WE DO USE THEIR EXPERTISE ON</p>
<p>SOME ENGINEERING PROJECTS. &raquo; ACCORDING TO A MINISTRY</p>
<p>SPOKESWOMAN, IT WOULD BE A DIVESTITURE OF EXPORTING</p>

<p>HAVE ANY OF THOSE OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THIS WITH YOU.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. I DON&rsquo;T KNOW THE POLITICAL</p>
<p>AFFILIATION OF EVERYBODY I SPEAK TO.</p>
<p>SO I CAN&rsquo;T VERIFY THE STATEMENT.</p>
<p>LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.</p>
<p>A FEW WEEKS AGO THIS COMMITTEE HAD A FIELD HEARING IN TEXAS</p>
<p>AND IT WAS ON THE ISSUE OF FENTANYL AND ILLEGAL</p>
<p>IMMIGRATION. ONE OF OUR WITNESSES, GRANTED</p>
<p>JUDGE, A 25 YEAR VETERAN BORDER PATROL AGENT, SAID ALL SOCIAL</p>
<p>MEDIA PLATFORMS PLAY A ROLE IN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S ONE OF THE WAYS CARTELS ADVERTISE THEIR SERVICES</p>
<p>THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND CONVINCE PEOPLE TO PUT</p>
<p>THEMSELVES IN THEIR HANDS AND COME TO THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>CARTELS ALL USE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.</p>
<p>ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS PHENOMENON?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ANY CONTENT THAT PROMOTES HUMAN ABUSE IS A VIOLATION OF</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES. THAT DICTATES WHAT IS ALLOWED</p>
<p>AND NOT ALLOWED ON OUR PLATFORM.</p>
<p>WE WILL IDENTIFY AND REMOVE THEM FROM OUR PLATFORM.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF YOU SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU HAVE REMOVED PEOPLE.</p>
<p>BECAUSE WHAT WE&rsquo;VE HEARD AT THE HEARING IS THAT TIKTOK WAS ONE</p>
<p>OF THE PLATFORMS THAT RECRUITS ADOLESCENTS IN THE UNITED</p>
<p>STATES TO HELP WITH TRANSPORTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE</p>
<p>BEEN TRAFFICKED INTO THE COUNTRY, AS WELL AS CONTRABAND</p>
<p>SUBSTANCES. WOULD YOU HELP US WITH THAT,</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING WHO YOU HAVE REMOVED FROM THE PLATFORM?</p>

<p>HERE TODAY. AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, OUR</p>
<p>VERY FIRST AND TOP RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT</p>
<p>AND DEFEND. PROTECT AND DEFEND OUR</p>
<p>CONSTITUTION AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY.</p>
<p>SO I VIEW THIS ENTIRE ISSUE, NOW THERE ARE MANY PARTS OF IT</p>
<p>THAT ARE NOT PART OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IN MY VIEW,</p>
<p>BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.</p>
<p>SO IN EXAMINING TIKTOK BREAKING AWAY FROM BYTEDANCE, SO I WOULD</p>
<p>LIKE TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND HOW A SEVERANCE</p>
<p>IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH BYTEDANCE, HOW USER DATA,</p>
<p>AMERICAN USER DATA, WOULD BE PROTECTED.</p>
<p>NOW, UNDER BEIJING&rsquo;S SECURITY LAWS, ARTICLE SEVEN COMPELS</p>
<p>COMPANIES TO PROVIDE DATA. ARTICLE TEN MAKES THE REACH OF</p>
<p>THE LAW EXTRATERRITORIAL. THIS IS VERY CLEAR.</p>
<p>I DON&rsquo;T NEED TO READ ALL OF IT INTO THE RECORD, BUT THOSE ARE</p>
<p>THE LAWS OF THE PRC. HOW DOES BYTEDANCE, HOW DOES</p>
<p>TIKTOK RATHER, HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THE CONGRESS OF THE</p>
<p>UNITED STATES THAT THERE CAN BE A CLEAN BREAK?</p>
<p>WHY WOULD THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SIDESTEP THEIR</p>
<p>NATIONAL LAW, INCLUDING ARTICLE SEVEN, ARTICLE TEN, IN TERMS OF</p>
<p>USER DATA? &raquo; CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR</p>
<p>THE QUESTION. I&rsquo;M GLAD YOU ASKED THIS.</p>
<p>AS I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT, OUR PLAN IS TO MOVE</p>
<p>AMERICAN DATA TO BE STORED ON AMERICAN SOIL &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I UNDERSTAND THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT YOU ARE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>SIDESTEPPING, OR I HAVEN&rsquo;T READ ANYTHING IN TERMS OF TIKTOK,</p>
<p>HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY SAY, AND YOU&rsquo;VE SPOKEN ABOUT IT IN YOUR</p>
<p>OPENING STATEMENT ABOUT A FIREWALL RELATIVE TO THE DATA.</p>
<p>BUT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS THAT DATA.</p>
<p>HOW CAN YOU PROMISE THAT THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE UNITED</p>
<p>STATES OF AMERICA TO BE PROTECTED HERE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSWOMAN, I HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT THE CHINESE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>GOVERNMENT HAS ACCESS TO THE DATA.</p>
<p>THEY HAVE NEVER ASKED US. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED IT.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YOU KNOW WHAT? I FIND THAT ACTUALLY</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>PREPOSTEROUS. &raquo; I HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF</p>
<p>THIS HAPPENING. IN ORDER TO ASSURE EVERYBODY</p>
<p>HERE, AND ALL OUR USERS, OUR COMMITMENT IS TO MOVE THE DATA</p>
<p>INTO THE UNITED STATES TO BE STORED ON AMERICAN SOIL BY AN</p>
<p>AMERICAN COMPANY OVERSEEN BY AMERICAN PERSONNEL.</p>
<p>SO THE RISK WOULD BE SIMILAR TO ANY GOVERNMENT GOING TO</p>
<p>AMERICAN COMPANY ASKING FOR DATA.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WELL, I AM ONE WHO DOESN&rsquo;T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS REALLY A</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>PRIVATE SECTOR IN CHINA. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR</p>
<p>NATIONAL LAW, AND SPECIFICALLY THESE TWO ARTICLES, ARTICLE</p>
<p>SEVEN AND ARTICLE TEN, THEY ARE VERY CLEAR.</p>
<p>SO I THINK THERE&rsquo;S A REAL PROBLEM, A REAL PROBLEM</p>
<p>RELATIVE TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY ABOUT THE PROTECTION</p>
<p>OF THE USER DATA. I DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE THAT TIKTOK,</p>
<p>THAT YOU HAVE SAID OR DONE ANYTHING, TO CONVINCE US THAT</p>
<p>THAT INFORMATION, THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF 150 MILLION</p>
<p>AMERICANS, THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE</p>
<p>THAT UP. &raquo; CONGRESSWOMAN &ndash;</p>

<p>CAN YOU TELL ME WHO WRITES THE ALGORITHMS FOR TIKTOK?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TODAY, THE ALGORITHM THAT POWERS THE U.S. USER EXPERIENCE</p>

<p>IS RUNNING IN THE ORACLE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE.</p>
<p>YES, INITIALLY THERE WERE PARTS OF THE SOURCE CODE, ESPECIALLY</p>
<p>IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE LAYOUT, THAT DOES NOT TOUCH THE USER</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE, THAT IS A COLLABORATIVE GLOBAL EFFORT</p>
<p>INCLUDING BUILT BY ENGINEERS IN CHINA.</p>
<p>JUST LIKE MANY OTHER COMPANIES BY THE WAY.</p>
<p>THE PHONE YOU USE, THE CAR YOU DRIVE, IT&rsquo;S A GLOBAL</p>
<p>COLLABORATIVE. TODAY, THE BUSINESS SIDE, THE</p>
<p>MAIN PARTS OF THE CODE FOR TIKTOK, WAS WRITTEN BY TIKTOK</p>
<p>EMPLOYEES, AND CONGRESSWOMAN, WHAT WE ARE OFFERING IS</p>
<p>THIRD-PARTY MONITORING OF OUR SOURCE CODE.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M NOT AWARE OF ANY COMPANY, AMERICAN COMPANIES OR OTHERWISE,</p>
<p>THAT HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THAT. BECAUSE WE ARE SAYING WE WANT</p>
<p>TO GIVE YOU TRANSPARENCY AND RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO MAKE</p>
<p>SURE THAT WE GIVE YOU ALL THE CONTENT WE NEED BY THE</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE. &raquo; WELL, MY TIME IS UP AND I</p>

<p>PARTY, THE UNITED STATES BELIEVES IN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM,</p>
<p>INNOVATION, AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP.</p>
<p>THAT IS, IN PART, WHAT CONGRESS ENACTED SECTION 230 OF THE</p>
<p>COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT. OUR GOAL IS TO PROMOTE GROWTH</p>
<p>OF AN ONLINE ECOSYSTEM AND THE UNITED STATES, AND TO PROTECT</p>
<p>COMPANIES FROM BEING HELD LIABLE FOR GOOD FAITH EFFORTS</p>
<p>TO MODERATE THEIR PLATFORMS. LAST YEAR, A FEDERAL JUDGE IN</p>
<p>PENNSYLVANIA FOUND THAT SECTION 230 PROTECTED TIKTOK FROM BEING</p>
<p>HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF THE TEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO</p>
<p>PARTICIPATED IN A BLACKOUT CHALLENGE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE</p>
<p>CHOKING CHALLENGE. TIKTOK ACTUALLY PUSH THE VIDEO</p>
<p>ON HER FEED. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS ONE OF</p>
<p>THE MANY DEVASTATING EXAMPLES THAT CHILDREN LOST THEIR LIVES</p>
<p>BECAUSE OF CONTENT PROMOTED BY TIKTOK.</p>
<p>SECTION 230 WAS NEVER INTENDED TO SHIELD COMPANIES LIKE YOURS</p>
<p>FROM AMPLIFYING DANGEROUS AND LIFE THREATENING CONTENT TO</p>
<p>CHILDREN. DO YOU CONSIDER THIS A GOOD</p>
<p>FAITH MODERATION? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, AS A FATHER</p>

<p>IT&rsquo;S ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WE HAVE GIVEN TO THIS COMMITTEE</p>

<p>DO ANY BYTEDANCE EMPLOYEES IN CHINA, INCLUDING ENGINEERS,</p>
<p>CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO USER &ndash;</p>
<p>U.S. USER DATA? &raquo; TODAY, ALL U.S. USER DATA IS</p>
<p>STORED BY DEFAULT IN THE ORACLE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE AND ACCESS</p>
<p>IS CONTROLLED BY AMERICANS. &raquo; MANY EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCESS</p>
<p>KINDLY TO U.S. DATA? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, I WOULD</p>
<p>APPRECIATE, THIS IS A COMPLEX TOPIC, TODAY OF DATA &ndash;</p>

<p>YES OR NO? IT&rsquo;S NOT THAT COMPLEX.</p>

<p>YES OR NO, DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO USER DATA?</p>

<p>AFTER PROJECT TEXAS IS DONE, THE ANSWER IS NO.</p>

<p>TODAY, THERE IS STILL SOME DATA &ndash;</p>

<p>WE&rsquo;VE HEARD ALREADY FROM THE WRITING MEMBERS THAT HE DOESN&rsquo;T</p>

<p>REALLY SEE THAT PROJECT TEXAS IS GOING TO BE USEFUL.</p>
<p>SO I&rsquo;M TAKING THAT AS A NO, BECAUSE AGAIN, THE QUESTION IS,</p>
<p>IT CAME UP EARLIER, ON DECEMBER 22ND LAST YEAR, WHEN BIDEN&rsquo;S</p>
<p>CONFIRMED SOME OF ITS CHINESE EMPLOYEES HAD ACCESS TO TIKTOK</p>
<p>DATA TO MONITOR AND TRACK THE PHYSICAL LOCATION OF</p>
<p>JOURNALISTS. SO I TOOK THAT AS A YES.</p>
<p>EARLIER THIS WEEK, YOU POSTED A TIKTOK VIDEO ASKING AMERICAN</p>
<p>USERS TO MOBILIZE IN SUPPORT OF YOUR APP AND OPPOSE THE</p>
<p>POTENTIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTION TO BAN TIKTOK FROM THE</p>
<p>UNITED STATES. BASED ON THE ESTABLISHED</p>
<p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR COMPANY AND THE CHINESE</p>
<p>COMMUNIST PARTY, IT&rsquo;S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO CONCLUDE</p>
<p>THAT THE VIDEO IS ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN THE TYPE OF</p>
<p>PROPAGANDA THAT THE CCP REQUIRES CHINESE COMPANIES TO</p>
<p>PUSH ON ITS CITIZENS AND I YIELD BACK.</p>

<p>MR. CHEW, LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE</p>
<p>INFLUENCE OF CHINA ON TIKTOK AND WHAT THAT DOES FOR U.S.</p>
<p>USERS. BUT I&rsquo;M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT</p>
<p>HOW THE CONTENT IN TIKTOK IS BEING DISTRIBUTED, PARTICULARLY</p>
<p>TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT IS</p>
<p>UNIQUE TO TAKE STOCK, BUT TIKTOK HAS 150 MILLION USERS IN</p>
<p>THE UNITED STATES. AND SO, I THINK YOU WILL AGREE</p>
<p>THAT TIKTOK HAS A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR</p>
<p>CONTENT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS SAFE AND ACCURATE.</p>
<p>WOULD THAT BE FAIR TO SAY? &raquo; YES, I AGREE WITH THAT.</p>

<p>SO, YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT</p>

<p>THAT THERE IS A BAN, OR IT&rsquo;S LIMITED FOR KIDS UNDER 13, AND</p>
<p>UNDER 18, AND SOMEONE. BUT I KNOW IT WON&rsquo;T BE NEWS FOR</p>
<p>YOU THAT COMPUTER SAVVY KIDS ACTUALLY CAN BYPASS SOME OF</p>
<p>THOSE RESTRICTIONS. QUITE FREQUENTLY, AND THEY CAN</p>
<p>DO IT EVEN IF THEY HAVE PARENTAL OVERSIGHT.</p>
<p>SO WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU IS, RATHER THAN PUTTING THE BURDEN</p>
<p>ON YOUNG PEOPLE AND PARENTS WHO ACCURATELY PUT IN A</p>
<p>BREATHTAKING AND SOMEONE FOR REGISTERING PREDICTS TALK, I</p>
<p>WANT TO ASK YOU WHAT TIKTOK IN DO TO MAKE SURE TO MONITOR THIS</p>
<p>CONTACT? AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN</p>
<p>EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE STREAM CONTENT.</p>
<p>MR. LATTA TALKED ABOUT THE BLACKOUT CHALLENGE AND SOME OF</p>
<p>THE DANGERS TO YOUNG PEOPLE SAFETY, THERE&rsquo;S ALSO EXTREME</p>
<p>CONTENT AROUND HEALTH CARE INFORMATION.</p>
<p>ONE STUDY SAID 13 OUT OF 20 RESULTS FOR THE QUESTION,</p>
<p>BECAUSE MCGUIRE DOES ABORTION, IT TALKED ABOUT HERBAL</p>
<p>SO-CALLED BOARDED THINGS LIKE PAPAYA SEEDS.</p>
<p>THAT DOESN&rsquo;T WORK. AND SO IF PEOPLE SEARCHING FOR</p>
<p>INFORMATION ON SAFE ABORTIONS WENT ON TIKTOK, THEY COULD GET</p>
<p>DEVASTATINGLY INCORRECT INFORMATION.</p>
<p>ANOTHER STUDY SHOWED THAT TIKTOK WAS, HAD A</p>
<p>HYDROXYCHOLOROQUINE TO TOIL ON HOW FABRICATE THIS FROM</p>
<p>GRAPEFRUIT. NOW, THERE&rsquo;S TWO PROBLEMS WITH</p>
<p>THAT. NUMBER ONE, HYDROXYCHOLOROQUINE</p>
<p>IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN TREATING COVID.</p>
<p>SO THAT IS ONE ISSUE. THE SECOND ISSUE IS YOU CAN&rsquo;T</p>
<p>EVEN MAKE HYDROXYCHOLOROQUINE FROM GRAPEFRUIT.</p>
<p>SO AGAIN, THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS MISCOMMUNICATION ABOUT</p>
<p>HEALTH CARE INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE LOOKING AT TIKTOK ARE</p>
<p>ABLE TO GET. AND IN FACT, IT&rsquo;S BEING PUSHED</p>
<p>OUT TO THEM. SO I WANT TO KNOW FROM YOU, AND</p>
<p>I WILL GIVE YOU TIME TO ANSWER THIS, YOU HAVE CURRENT CONTROLS</p>
<p>&lsquo;S, WHAT THE CURRENT CONTROLS ARE NOT WORKING TO KEEP THIS</p>
<p>INFORMATION MAINLY FROM YOUNG PEOPLE, BUT FROM AMERICANS IN</p>
<p>GENERAL.</p>
<p>WHAT MORE IS TIKTOK DOING TO TRY TO STRENGTHEN ITS REVIEW,</p>
<p>TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION FROM COMING ACROSS TO PEOPLE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE DANGEROUS MISINFORMATION</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THAT YOU MENTIONED IS NOT ALLOWED ON OUR PLATFORM.</p>
<p>IT VIOLATES THEM. &raquo; I&rsquo;M SORRY TO REPORT IT IS ON</p>
<p>YOUR PLATFORM THOUGH. &raquo; CONGRESSWOMAN, I DON&rsquo;T THINK</p>
<p>I CAN SIT HERE AND SAY THAT WE ARE PERFECT IN DOING THIS.</p>
<p>WE DO WORK VERY HARD. &raquo; SO HOW CAN YOU MAKE YOURSELF</p>
<p>MORE PERFECT? I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO SAY IT&rsquo;S NOT</p>
<p>THERE, OR YOU APOLOGIZE. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO LIMIT IT AS</p>
<p>MUCH AS POSSIBLE? MORE THAN WHAT YOU ARE DOING</p>
<p>THEM. &raquo; WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT</p>
<p>AMOUNTS IN OUR CONTENT MODERATION WORK.</p>
<p>I SHARE THAT NUMBER IN MY WRITTEN STATEMENT.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I KNOW YOU ARE INVESTING. &raquo; YES.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BUT WHAT STEPS ARE YOU TAKING TO IMPROVE THE WAY I, OR</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>WHATEVER ELSE YOU ARE DOING, TO LIMIT THIS CONTENT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU SEARCH FOR CERTAIN SEARCH TERMS, WE DO</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>DIRECT YOU ON TIKTOK TO RESOURCE, SAFETY RESOURCES.</p>
<p>THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE.</p>
<p>WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THIS.</p>
<p>I RECOGNIZE, AND FULLY ALIGN WITH YOU, THAT THIS IS A</p>
<p>PROBLEM THAT FACES OUR INDUSTRY.</p>
<p>THAT WE REALLY NEED TO INVEST AND ADDRESS.</p>
<p>THIS I AM VERY IN ALIGNMENT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR USERS</p>
<p>COME TO OUR PLATFORM FOR ENTERTAIN &ndash;</p>
<p>ENTERTAINING AND SAFE CONTENT, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO</p>
<p>HAVE &ndash; TO SPOT SOME DANGEROUS</p>
<p>MISINFORMATION AND WE NEED TO TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY.</p>
<p>WE NEED TO INVESTED IN IT AND PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY IT AND</p>
<p>REMOVE IT FROM OUR PLATFORM. &raquo; OKAY, I&rsquo;M GOING TO STOP YOU</p>
<p>RIGHT NOW. I ASKED YOU SPECIFICALLY HOW</p>
<p>YOU WERE INCREASING, HOW YOU ARE TRYING TO INCREASE YOUR</p>
<p>REVIEW OF HIS, AND YOU GAVE ME ONLY GENERALIZED STATEMENTS</p>
<p>THAT YOU ARE INVESTING, THAT YOUR CONCERN, THAT YOU&rsquo;RE DOING</p>
<p>WORK. THAT&rsquo;S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME,</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S NOT ENOUGH FOR THE PARENTS OF AMERICA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M GOING TO ASK YOU TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR TESTIMONY AND</p>
<p>HAVE YOUR EXPERTS TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO MAKE THIS A</p>
<p>HIGHER LEVEL OF SCRUTINY, NOT JUST AT THE SAME.</p>
<p>THANK YOU AND I YIELD BACK. &raquo; THE LADY YIELDS BACK.</p>
<p>CHAIR RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA, MR. HUDSON,</p>
<p>FOR FIVE MINUTES. &raquo; THANK YOU, CHAIRWOMAN.</p>
<p>THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING.</p>
<p>I APPRECIATE THE WITNESS FOR MAKING HIMSELF AVAILABLE TODAY.</p>
<p>WHILE MANY CONSIDER TIKTOK TO BE JUST ANOTHER VIDEO SHARING</p>
<p>APP, AND REALITY TIKTOK HAS BEEN FUNCTIONING AS A MASSIVE</p>
<p>SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. COLLECTING BEST SWATS OF</p>
<p>PERSONAL DATA FOR MORE THAN A BILLION PEOPLE OR OF WHAT.</p>
<p>THIS INCLUDES DATA FROM PERSONAL DEVICES OF FEDERAL</p>
<p>EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND MOST CONCERNING, U.S. MILITARY</p>
<p>SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN PLACES LIKE FORT</p>
<p>BRAGG NORTH CAROLINA. AS BREAKS CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE</p>
<p>SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES TIKTOK GIVES THE</p>
<p>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TO ACCESS THE NON PUBLIC SENSITIVE</p>
<p>DATA ABOUT WHERE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM.</p>
<p>THIS PERSONAL DATA AND LOCATION INFORMATION CAN BE HARVESTED,</p>
<p>AND COULD BE USED, FOR BLACKMAIL, ESPIONAGE, AND EVEN</p>
<p>REVEAL TRUMP MYTHS. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND</p>
<p>MOST AGENCIES HAVE BANNED TIKTOK ON GOVERNMENT ISSUED</p>
<p>DEVICES, I BELIEVE MOORE HAS TO BE DONE TO ERASE THE APP FROM</p>
<p>THE PERSONAL DEVICES. HAVING AN APP BANNED ON ADVICE</p>
<p>ON ONE POCKETBOOK, DOWNLOADED ON A DEVICE IN YOUR OTHER</p>
<p>POCKET DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME.</p>
<p>I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD ADDRESS THE CONTINUED USE OF</p>
<p>TIKTOK IN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AS WELL AS</p>
<p>ANYTHING THAT DEPICTS U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS.</p>
<p>DOES TIKTOK ACCESS THE HOME WI-FI NETWORK, MR. CHEW?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ONLY IF THE USER TURNS ON THE WI-FI.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;M SORRY. I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND THE</p>
<p>QUESTION. &raquo; IF I HAVE TIKTOK ON MY PHONE,</p>
<p>AND MY PHONE IS ON MY HOME NETWORK, DOES TIKTOK ACCESS THE</p>
<p>NETWORK? &raquo; IT WILL HAVE TO ACCESS THE</p>
<p>NETWORK TO GET CONNECTIONS TO THE INTERNET.</p>
<p>IF THAT&rsquo;S THE QUESTION. &raquo; IS IT POSSIBLE THEN IT CAN</p>
<p>ACCESS OTHER DEVICES ON THAT HOME WI-FI NETWORK?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, WE DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT IS BEYOND ANY</p>

<p>INDUSTRY NORMS. I BELIEVE THE ANSWER TO YOUR</p>
<p>QUESTION IS NO. IT COULD BE TECHNICAL.</p>
<p>LET ME GET BACK TO YOU. &raquo; I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU</p>
<p>CAN ANSWER THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THE</p>
<p>DIRECTION REAL QUICK. DO YOU RECEIVE PERSONAL</p>
<p>EMPLOYMENT SALARY COMPENSATION OR BENEFITS FROM BYTEDANCE?</p>

<p>YES, I DO. &raquo; WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR SALARY FROM</p>

<p>BYTEDANCE? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, IF YOU DON&rsquo;T</p>
<p>MIND, I WOULD PREFER TO KEEP MY COMPENSATION PRIVATE.</p>

<p>OKAY. DO YOU PERSONALLY HAVE ANY</p>

<p>COMPANY SHARES OR STOP IN BYTEDANCE?</p>

<p>PERSONAL ANSWERS PRIVATE. &raquo; IT&rsquo;S TIKTOK THE COMPANY YOUR</p>

<p>WHERE IS YOUR OTHER SOURCE OF INCOME OUTSIDE OF TIKTOK?</p>

<p>IT&rsquo;S MY ONLY SOURCE OF COMPENSATION.</p>

<p>DETAILS ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.</p>

<p>TO BE VERY SURE. &raquo; OKAY, THANK YOU.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT OUR CHAIRWOMAN</p>
<p>BROUGHT UP ABOUT AN APPARENT PATTERN OF MISREPRESENTATION</p>
<p>FROM YOUR COMPANY IN REGARDS TO THE MAT AND EXTENT OF DATA THAT</p>
<p>YOU ARE COLLECTING, AS WELL AS WHAT IS BEING ACCESSED FROM</p>

<p>HAS BEEN ACCESSING DATA AND U.S. USERS CONTRADICTING</p>
<p>SEVERAL PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY PUBLIC &ndash;</p>
<p>TIKTOK EMPLOYEES. I&rsquo;M REFERENCING PROJECT RAVEN,</p>
<p>WHICH WAS FIRST REPORTED ON BY FORBES LAST OCTOBER.</p>
<p>ANOTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED, I&rsquo;M SORRY, I&rsquo;M RUNNING OUT OF</p>

<p>JOURNAL, THEY SAID CHINA&rsquo;S COMMERCE MINISTER SAID THAT</p>
<p>CHINA OPPOSES THE SALE OF TIKTOK BECAUSE IT WOULD INVOLVE</p>
<p>EXPORTING CHINA&rsquo;S TECHNOLOGY AND WOULD, AND THIS IS THE</p>
<p>IMPORTANT PART, AND WOULD NEED TO BE APPROVED BY THE CHINESE</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT. IT WE NEED TO BE APPROVED BY</p>
<p>THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. SO ALL OF WHAT YOU&rsquo;VE BEEN</p>
<p>SAYING ABOUT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TIKTOK AND CHINA HAS</p>
<p>BEEN SAID TO BE NOT TRUE.</p>
<p>IN THE PAPER TODAY, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE TO</p>
<p>SAY IN RESPONSE. &raquo; CONGRESSWOMAN, I DO DISAGREE</p>
<p>WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION. WE HAVE DESIGN PROJECT TEXAS TO</p>
<p>PROTECT U.S. USER INTERESTS AND TO MOVE FORWARD HERE IN THE</p>
<p>U.S.. AGAIN, THE PROTECTION STRING</p>
<p>AMERICAN DATA ON AMERICAN SOIL BY AN AMERICAN COMPANY LOOKED</p>
<p>AFTER BY AMERICAN PERSONNEL. AND I DO NOT THINK THAT, YOU</p>
<p>KNOW, OUR COMMITMENTS TO THIS COMMITTEE AND ALL OUR USERS IS</p>
<p>IMPACTED BY ANY EVENT THAT YOU MENTIONED.</p>
<p>NOW, THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ON THIS RESOLUTION IS AN ONGOING</p>
<p>AND DEVELOPING EVENT. SO WE CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION</p>
<p>TO THIS AND WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WHEN WE HAVE MORE</p>
<p>SPECIFICS. BUT MY COMMITMENT STANDS.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OKAY, IF IT&rsquo;S AN ONGOING DEBATE APPARENTLY WITH CHINA,</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>SO IT&rsquo;S HARD TO SAY WITH ANY CERTAINTY THAT CHINA WOULD NOT</p>
<p>HAVE ANY INFLUENCE, BUT LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION.</p>
<p>LAST FALL, ALONG WITH &ndash; WHO IS CHAIR AND CO-CHAIR OF</p>
<p>THE SUBCOMMITTEE TOGETHER, WE WERE TOLD THAT TIKTOK HAD</p>
<p>SURVEILLED, WAS INVOLVED IN SURVEILLANCE, OF USERS VERY</p>
<p>PERSONAL INFORMATION. YOU MIGHT SAY, WELL, NOT MORE</p>
<p>THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY. AND I AGREE WITH RANKING MEMBER</p>
<p>ALONE THAT I REALLY DON&rsquo;T WANT TO GO BY THAT STANDARD IN</p>
<p>PARTICULAR. BUT THAT TIKTOK&rsquo;S IN-APP</p>
<p>BROWSER SURVEILLED EVERYTHING FROM AMERICANS INCLUDING</p>
<p>PASSWORDS AND CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, ET CETERA.</p>
<p>I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU IF TIKTOK DID TRACK AND COLLECT</p>
<p>THIS SENSITIVE DATA, THAT AMERICANS DON&rsquo;T WANT TO HAVE</p>
<p>DISCLOSED? &raquo; CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M GLAD YOU ASKED THIS QUESTION BECAUSE, LIKE YOU</p>
<p>POINTED OUT, WE ACTUALLY DO NOT BELIEVE WE COLLECT MORE DATA</p>
<p>THAN ANY OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY OUT THERE.</p>
<p>A LOT OF THESE REPORTS, AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHICH ONE</p>
<p>SPECIFICALLY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT</p>
<p>THAT ACCURATE. SOME OF THEM WE HAVE ACTUALLY</p>
<p>GOTTEN IN CONTACT WITH THE AUTHORS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND</p>
<p>THE DATA THAT WE ARE COLLECTING.</p>
<p>A LOT OF IT IS SPECULATION. THIS IS SOMETHING THEY COULD</p>
<p>DO. THEY COULD DO.</p>
<p>WHAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUBTEXT, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY</p>
<p>COMPANY COULD DO. &raquo; I&rsquo;M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.</p>
<p>LET ME JUST SAY THAT IF TIKTOK CHOSE NOT TO TAKE THIS</p>
<p>SENSITIVE INFORMATION, THAT YOU DON&rsquo;T NEED FOR TRANSACTION, AND</p>
<p>SUPPORT OUR COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY BILL, THAT WOULD BE</p>
<p>VERY HELPFUL. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ASK.</p>
<p>SO REALLY, THIS IS A YES OR NO. THAT TIKTOK &ndash;</p>
<p>DOES TIKTOK SHARE USER INFORMATION FROM THE COMPANIES,</p>
<p>FROM PARENT COMPANY&rsquo;S, FROM AFFILIATED, OR SEND USER</p>
<p>INFORMATION, TO OVERSEAS? &raquo; IN THE PAST, YES.</p>
<p>FOR INTER OPERABILITY PURPOSES. AFTER PROJECT TEXAS, ALL</p>
<p>PROTECTED U.S. DATA WILL BE STORED HERE WITH THE ACCESS</p>
<p>CONTROLLED BY A SPECIAL TEAM OF U.S. PERSONNEL.</p>
<p>AGAIN, CONGRESSWOMAN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT, AS FAR AS I</p>
<p>UNDERSTAND, NO OTHER COMPANY, INCLUDING AMERICAN COMPANIES,</p>
<p>ARE WILLING TO DO. SO MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT</p>
<p>WE CAN ASK THE INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE, NOT JUST US.</p>
<p>TO PROTECT U.S. USER DATA. &raquo; I WANT TO QUOTE FROM</p>
<p>EMPLOYEES THAT YOU HAD. HERE&rsquo;S THE QUOTE.</p>
<p>EVERYTHING IS SEEN IN CHINA. THAT&rsquo;S REALLY WHAT THEY SAID.</p>
<p>PEOPLE WHO WERE IN TOUCH WITH THE SENSITIVE DATA WERE SAYING</p>
<p>THAT. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I KNOW YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT, BUT MY POINT IS</p>

<p>HOW DID THAT HAPPEN, THAT EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY ARE</p>
<p>SAYING THAT IN FACT IS NOT TRUE? &raquo; I CANNOT SPEAK &ndash;</p>
<p>I DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHO THIS PERSON IS, SO I DON&rsquo;T KNOW &ndash;</p>
<p>I CAN&rsquo;T SPEAK TO WHAT THAT PERSON HAS OR HAS NOT SAID.</p>
<p>WHAT I CAN SAY IS, BASED ON MY POSITION IN THIS COMPANY, AND</p>

<p>TRANSPARENCY OVER HALF A DOZEN TIMES IN YOUR OPENING TESTIMONY</p>

<p>CORPORATE STRUCTURE, TIES TO THE CCP, THE COMPANY&rsquo;S FOUNDER</p>
<p>AND THEIR ACTIVITIES. YOU CAN LOOK NO FURTHER THAN</p>
<p>THE FACT BYTEDANCE WEBSITE HAS BEEN SCRUBBED.</p>
<p>IN FACT, WE FOUND WEB PAGES FROM THE BEIJING INTERNET</p>

<p>IS THAT CORRECT? &raquo; NO, THAT IS NOT CORRECT.</p>

<p>BYTEDANCE? WHY WOULD THEY SAY DOWNPLAY THE</p>
<p>CHINA ASSOCIATION AND DOWNPLAY THE A I?</p>
<p>THIS IS FROM AN INTERNAL MEMO FROM YOUR COMPANY.</p>

<p>MR. CHEW, I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO SCREEN</p>
<p>FOR A SHORT VIDEO IF YOU DON&rsquo;T MIND.</p>
<p>MR. CHEW, THAT VIDEO WAS POSTED 41 DAYS AGO.</p>
<p>AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS CAPTIONED ME AS F.</p>
<p>AT THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE ON MARCH</p>
<p>23RD OF THIS YEAR, THIS VIDEO WAS POSTED BEFORE THIS HEARING</p>
<p>WAS PUBLICLY NOTICED. I THINK THAT&rsquo;S A VERY</p>
<p>INTERESTING POINT TO RAISE. MORE CONCERNING IS THE FACT</p>
<p>THAT IT NAMES THIS CHAIRWOMAN BY NAME.</p>
<p>YOUR OWN COMMUNITY GUIDELINES STATE THAT YOU HAVE A FIRM</p>
<p>STANCE AGAINST ENABLING VIOLENCE ON OR OFF TIKTOK.</p>
<p>WE DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE OUR PLATFORM TO THREATEN OR</p>
<p>INCITE VIOLENCE, WERE TO PROMOTE VIOLENT EXTREMIST</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS OR FACTS.</p>
<p>WHEN THERE IS A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY OR AN ACCOUNT IS</p>
<p>USED TO PROMOTE OR GLORIFY OFF PLATFORM VIOLENCE, WE BANNED</p>
<p>THE ACCOUNT. THIS VIDEO HAS BEEN UP FOR 41</p>
<p>DAYS. IT IS A DIRECT THREAT TO THE</p>
<p>CHAIRWOMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE, THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, AND</p>
<p>YET IT STILL REMAINS ON THE PLATFORM, AND YOU EXPECT US TO</p>
<p>BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING THE DATA PRIVACY</p>
<p>AND SECURITY OF 150 MILLION AMERICANS?</p>
<p>YOU CAN&rsquo;T EVEN PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM.</p>
<p>I THINK THAT&rsquo;S A BLATANT DISPLAY OF HOW VULNERABLE</p>
<p>PEOPLE WHO USE TIKTOK ARE. YOU CANNOT TAKE ACTION AFTER 41</p>
<p>DAYS WHEN A CLEAR THREAT, A VERY VIOLENT THREAT, TO THE</p>
<p>CHAIRWOMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE AND MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE</p>
<p>WAS POSTED ON YOUR PLATFORM. YOU DARN WELL KNOW THAT YOU</p>
<p>CANNOT PROTECT THE DATA AND SECURITY OF THIS COMMITTEE, OR</p>
<p>THE 150 MILLION USERS OF YOUR APP, BECAUSE IT&rsquo;S AN EXTENSION</p>
<p>OF THE CCP. WITH THAT I YIELD BACK.</p>

<p>LOOK NO FURTHER THAN EVEN THE VULNERABLE IN OUR TELECOMS</p>

<p>I AM ESPECIALLY COMMITTED TO THE TRANSPARENCY FROM LARGE</p>
<p>PLATFORMS ABOUT THE ALGORITHMS THAT SHAPED OUR ONLINE</p>

<p>STANDARDS FOR ALGORITHMS, REQUIRING NEW FORMS OF</p>
<p>OVERSIGHT. NOW, THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE</p>
<p>ONLINE PLATFORMS TO PUBLIC &ndash; PUBLISH ANNUAL PUBLIC REPORTS</p>
<p>DETAILING THEIR CONTENT MODERATION PRACTICES.</p>
<p>I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE A BASELINE REQUIREMENT TO ENABLE</p>
<p>MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT. AND CONSUMER CHOICE.</p>
<p>MR. CHEW, JUST YES OR NO, DO YOU BELIEVE A REQUIREMENT FOR</p>
<p>ANNUAL CONTENT MODERATION PRACTICES FOR SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p>PLATFORMS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL? YES OR NO?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YES. &raquo; THIS TRANSPARENCY BILL WOULD</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ALSO REQUIRE ONLINE PLATFORMS TO MAINTAIN DETAILED RECORDS</p>
<p>DESCRIBING THEIR ALGORITHMIC PROCESS WILL REVIEW BY THE</p>
<p>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, IN COMPLIANCE WITH KEY PRIVACY AND</p>
<p>DATA IDENTIFICATION STANDARDS. MR. CHEW, THIS TIKTOK CURRENTLY</p>
<p>MAINTAIN RECORDS DESCRIBING THEIR ALGORITHMIC PROCESSES?</p>
<p>YES OR NO? &raquo; CONGRESSWOMAN, I WOULD NEED</p>
<p>TO CHECK AND GET BACK TO YOU ON WHAT KIND OF SPECIFIC RECORDS</p>
<p>YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. &raquo; I WILL WAIT FOR THAT.</p>
<p>OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, ALARMING INFORMATION BROUGHT TO</p>
<p>LIGHT BY WHISTLEBLOWERS HAVE SHOWN THAT SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p>COMPANIES ARE INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE EFFECT THEIR PRODUCTS ON</p>
<p>YOUNG WOMEN, POLITICAL EXTREMISM, AND MORE.</p>
<p>DESPITE THIS, THEY HAVE WITHHELD THOSE STUDIES OR</p>
<p>DECLINED TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER.</p>
<p>IN EITHER CASE, IT SHOWS A PATTERN OF THE THEY SUPPORT</p>
<p>NEGLIGENT BEHAVIOR THAT I FIND CONCERNING AND EXTREME.</p>
<p>MR. CHEW, DOES TIKTOK CONDUCT ITS OWN STUDIES ON THE</p>
<p>AFFECTIVE OF ITS ALGORITHMS IN CONTENT DISTRIBUTION MODELS ON</p>
<p>MENTAL HEALTH OR SAFETY? AND IF SO, HOW AND WHEN ARE</p>
<p>THOSE FINDINGS MADE PUBLIC? AND IF NOT, DO YOU BELIEVE THEY</p>
<p>ARE NECESSARY? &raquo; CONGRESSWOMAN, WE RELY ON</p>
<p>EXTERNAL THIRD PARTIES AND FUND THEIR RESEARCH TO HELP US</p>
<p>UNDERSTAND SOME OF THESE ISSUES.</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK WITH A DIGITAL WELLNESS LAB AT THE</p>
<p>BOSTON CHILDREN&rsquo;S HOSPITAL TO UNDERSTAND THE 60 MINUTE TIME</p>
<p>LIMIT THAT WE PUT FOR ALL OF OUR UNDER 18 USERS.</p>
<p>AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES MORE</p>
<p>FUNDING FOR RESEARCH, FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE NIH.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OKAY. TIKTOK TAILORS ITS RECOMMENDED</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>CONTENT BASED ON USER ACTIVITY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SPEND</p>
<p>MORE TIME ON THE APP. WHILE THE PRACTICE IS BY NO</p>
<p>MEANS UNIQUE TO TIKTOK, GIVEN THE PREVALENCE OF YOUNG USERS</p>
<p>AND THE DIGESTIBLE NATURE OF THE SHORT FORM VIDEO, I AM</p>
<p>CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPS TENDENCY TO EXACERBATE EXISTING</p>
<p>MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. MR. CHEW, DOES TIKTOK HAVE</p>
<p>DIFFERENT POLICIES FOR AMPLIFYING CONTACT THAT WOULD</p>
<p>BE RELATED TO DEPRESSION OR DIETING VERSUS CONTENT LIKE</p>
<p>GARDENING AND SPORTS? IF YES, DESCRIBED THE POLICY</p>
<p>DIFFERENCES. IF NO, WHY NOT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR THIS.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. THE ANSWER IS YES, WE ARE</p>
<p>TRYING OUT SOME POLICIES TOGETHER WITH EXPERTS TO</p>
<p>UNDERSTAND CONTENT THAT IS NOT INHERENTLY HARMFUL.</p>
<p>EXTREME FITNESS FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN TOO MUCH.</p>
<p>THESE ARE MODELS THAT WE ARE BUILDING AND WE ARE TRYING TO</p>
<p>UNDERSTAND, TOGETHER WITH EXPERTS, HOW TO BEST IMPLEMENT</p>
<p>THEM ACROSS OUR PLATFORM, AND PARTICULAR FOR YOUNGER USERS.</p>
<p>SO IN CASES WHERE USERS HAVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH POTENTIALLY</p>
<p>HARMFUL CONTENT, I BELIEVE IT&rsquo;S IMPERATIVE THAT THE APP TAKES</p>
<p>STEPS TO MODERATE THAT BEHAVIOR, RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO</p>
<p>PROMOTE. THAT MEANS, IN A SENSE &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I APOLOGIZE. I WASN&rsquo;T CLEAR.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>FIRST, ANYTHING THAT IS HARMFUL, WE REMOVE.</p>
<p>WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS, CONTENT THAT IS NOT INHERENTLY</p>
<p>HARMFUL, LIKE SOME OF THE EXTREME FITNESS VIDEOS ABOUT</p>
<p>PEOPLE RUNNING 100 MILES, AND IT&rsquo;S NOT INHERENTLY, HARMFUL</p>
<p>BUT IF WE SHOW THEM TOO MUCH, THE EXPERTS ARE TELLING US THAT</p>
<p>THAT WE SHOULD DISPERSE THEM, MORE AND SURE THEY&rsquo;RE NOT SEEN</p>
<p>TOO REGULARLY. ESPECIALLY BY YOUNGER UNITS.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SO YOUR INTENTIONAL ABOUT THAT THAT.</p>

<p>THE CONGRESS PASS AND ONLINE DATA PRIVACY LAW THAT PROTECTS</p>

<p>PARTICULARLY OUR KIDS. WHILE THE SYRIAN SHINES A LIGHT</p>
<p>ON TIKTOK, THIS HEARING ALSO SHOULD SERVE AS A CALL TO</p>
<p>ACTION FOR THE CONGRESS TO ACT NOW TO PROTECT AMERICANS FROM</p>
<p>SURVEILLANCE, TRACKING, PERSONAL DATA GATHERING, AN</p>
<p>ADDICTIVE ALGORITHMIC OPERATIONS THAT SERVE UP</p>
<p>HARMFUL CONTENTS AND HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT ON OUR KIDS</p>
<p>MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. FOR MANY YEARS THAT SOUNDED THE</p>
<p>ALARM ON THIS COMMITTEE ON HOW BIG TECH PLATFORMS LIKE TIKTOK</p>
<p>AND FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM INCESSANTLY SURVEIL, TRACK,</p>
<p>GATHER PERSONAL PRIVATE INFORMATION, AND USE IT ALONG</p>
<p>WITH DATA BROKERS TO TARGETS AND INFLUENCE OUR BEHAVIOR.</p>
<p>THIS IS A MUCH BROADER ISSUE THEN TIKTOK IN CHINA.</p>
<p>THERE ARE OTHER MALIGNED ACTORS A ROUND THE WORLD TO GATHER</p>
<p>DATA TO USE IT AS AN ELEMENT OF SOCIAL CONTROL, AND INFLUENCE.</p>
<p>AS I DETAILED IN THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR, WHEN WE PASS THE</p>
<p>ONLINE PRIVACY LAW, THE HARMS TO CHILDREN ARE VERY SERIOUS.</p>
<p>THEY DEMAND SWIFT ACTION. BIG TECH PLATFORMS PROFIT</p>
<p>IMMENSELY FROM KEEPING CHILDREN EJECTED.</p>
<p>THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE PRIVACY, SAFETY, AND HEALTH OF</p>
<p>OUR KIDS. THEY ARE THE MODERN-DAY TOBACCO</p>
<p>AND CIGARETTES COMPANIES THAT FOR SO LONG RESISTED, AND</p>
<p>MISLED CONGRESS. IT TOOK THE CONGRESS, IT TOOK</p>
<p>ACTION BY THE CONGRESS TO ACTUALLY PROTECT OUR KIDS, AND</p>
<p>OUTLAW SMOKING BY YOUNG PEOPLE. AND EARLY 2020, BASED UPON THE</p>
<p>GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE TO HARM OF KIDS ONLINE, I</p>
<p>INTRODUCE THE KIDS PRIVACY ACT, AND THE KIDS ACT.</p>
<p>I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE RESEARCHERS, THE YOUNG PEOPLE,</p>
<p>THE PARENTS, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES</p>
<p>WHO HAVE EXPLAINED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SOCIAL</p>
<p>MEDIA USAGE AND BODY DISSATISFACTION, DISORDERED</p>
<p>EATING HABITS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SELF INJURY,</p>
<p>SUICIDE, IDEATION, AND CYBERBULLYING.</p>
<p>HECK, FRANCIS, &ndash; THE FACEBOOK WHISTLE BLOWER WAS</p>
<p>RIGHT HERE TO TESTIFY TO US THAT FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM</p>
<p>CONDUCTED RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC.</p>
<p>THEY KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD THE HARMS, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO</p>
<p>ELEVATE PROFITS OVER THE WELL-BEING OF CHILDREN.</p>
<p>TIKTOK DOES THE SAME. LAST CONGRESS WE PASS THE ATP P</p>
<p>A, THE COMMITTEE INCORPORATED. MANY OF THESE IMPORTANT ONLINE</p>
<p>PRIVACY AND SAFETY PROVISIONS FOR MY BILLS.</p>
<p>WE CAN MAKE THE 118TH CONGRESSES VIRGIN OF THIS BILL,</p>
<p>OF THIS NEW LAW, EVEN MORE PROTECTIVE OF CHILDREN, I LOOK</p>
<p>FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND THE RANKING MEMBER TO</p>
<p>MAKE THAT HAPPEN. MR. CHU, TIKTOK HAS INCREDIBLE</p>
<p>SWAY OVER CHILDREN IN THE U.S.. YOU DON&rsquo;T HAVE A VERY GOOD</p>
<p>TRACK RECORD. IN 2019, TIKTOK WAS HIT WITH</p>
<p>THE LARGEST CIVIL PENALTY BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IN</p>
<p>THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S PRIVACY CASE. FOUR YEARS LATER, TIKTOK STILL</p>
<p>HAS NOT TAKEN SUFFICIENT ACTION TO FIX THE PROBLEMS.</p>
<p>I ASSUME BECAUSE CHILD USERS ARE INCREDIBLY PROFITABLE TO</p>
<p>YOUR BOTTOM LINE. SO ANSWER ME THIS.</p>
<p>TIKTOK ALLOWS ADVERTISERS TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET ADVERTISING</p>
<p>TO CHILDREN AGES 13 TO 17, CORRECT?</p>

<p>YOU IN SOME LANGUAGE THAT MAYBE FEEL BETTER UNDERSTANDS.</p>
<p>ONE ZEROES. OKAY?</p>
<p>LET&rsquo;S TALK ABOUT THE CITIZEN LAB REPORT.</p>
<p>THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR TEAM FREQUENTLY MENTIONS ABOUT A</p>
<p>FULLER THEY SHUNS THAT CRAB WE COULD NOT &ndash;</p>
<p>AND EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE. WHICH MEANS OUR METHODS COULD</p>
<p>NOT FIND EVERY SECURITY ISSUE AND PRIVACY VIOLATION AND</p>
<p>CENSORSHIP EVENTS. SO IT&rsquo;S AN INCOMPLETE</p>
<p>ASSESSMENT. THE REPORT NOTES THAT TIKTOK&rsquo;S</p>
<p>DATA COLLECTION USING THIRD-PARTY TRACKERS WAS AN</p>
<p>APPARENT CONFLICT WITH THE GDP ARM, AND THEY HAD MULTIPLE</p>
<p>THEMES WERE CENSORED BY TIKTOK. WHAT IS SHOCKING TO ME IS THE</p>
<p>SHARED SOURCE CODE BETWEEN TIKTOK AND THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>AND THE CCP CENTER. THE SCIENTISTS AND LAB REPORTS</p>
<p>THAT MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS WERE IDENTICAL, THAT THE DIFFERENCES</p>
<p>AND BEHAVIOR BETWEEN TIKTOK IN THE UNITED STATES, IN THOSE AND</p>
<p>CHINA, ARE SLIGHT CHANGES IN THE HARD COATED VALUES.</p>
<p>INCREDIBLY, SPECIFIC CENSORSHIP PARAMETERS FROM &ndash;</p>
<p>OUR PRESIDENT TIKTOK. THEY&rsquo;RE TURNED OFF.</p>
<p>THE AUTHORS SAY THAT FOR UNKNOWN REASONS, THE PARAMETER</p>
<p>VARIABLE ITSELF IS PRESERVED. SO WHILE CITIZEN LAB MAY HAVE</p>
<p>BEEN AFRAID TO SAY THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION, MR. CHU, I AM NOT.</p>
<p>TIKTOK SOURCE CODE IS RIDDLED WITH BACK DOORS AND CCP</p>
<p>CENSORSHIP DEVICES. HERE&rsquo;S THE TRUTH, AND 1 MILLION</p>
<p>LINES OF CODE, THIS SMALL-ISH SHIFT FROM A ZERO TO A ONE, ON</p>
<p>JUST ONE OF THOUSANDS OF VERSIONS OF TIKTOK ON THE</p>
<p>MARKETS, WHILE ON LOCK EXPLICIT CCP CENSORSHIP AND ACCESS TO</p>

<p>THE PAST, AND IT&rsquo;S UNFORTUNATE THAT I HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.</p>
<p>UNQUOTE. HE GOES ON TO SAY, UNQUOTE,</p>
<p>THAT WHEN YOU&rsquo;VE BEEN SPECULATING ABOUT POSSIBLE</p>

<p>CHAIR YIELDS TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM MARYLAND&rsquo;S.</p>
<p>MR. SARBANES. &raquo; THANKS VERY MUCH, MADAM</p>
<p>CHAIR. I&rsquo;M TRYING TO PICK UP ON A</p>
<p>THEME THAT WE&rsquo;VE ALREADY COVERED, HERE WHICH IS THE</p>
<p>EFFECT THAT THIS PLATFORM, ALONG WITH OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p>PLATFORMS, BY THE, WAY HASN&rsquo;T TERMS OF MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL</p>
<p>HEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY. I WILL SPEAK TO WHAT&rsquo;S</p>
<p>HAPPENING ELSEWHERE INHE WORLD, BUT WE&rsquo;VE TALKED ABOUT</p>
<p>THE IMPACT IT&rsquo;S HAVING ON CHILDREN, ON TEENS.</p>
<p>WE TOOK SOME ACTION LAST YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE TO TRY TO</p>
<p>IMPROVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES, AUTHORIZE CRITICAL PROGRAMS TO</p>
<p>ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.</p>
<p>WE NEED TO DO EVEN MORE THAN THAT.</p>
<p>WE&rsquo;VE GOT TO ADDRESS THE BIG TECH COMPANIES LIKE TIKTOK ARE</p>
<p>DOING BECAUSE THESE ARE PLATFORMS THAT EXPOSED CHILDREN,</p>
<p>TEENS, TWO ADDITIONAL RISKS. THE MORE TIME THAT MIDDLE AND</p>
<p>HIGH SCHOOL OR SPEND ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THE EVIDENCE IS MORE</p>
<p>LIKELY THAT THEY ARE TO EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION AND</p>
<p>ANXIETY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING</p>
<p>SENSE, APPARENTLY, 16% OF AMERICAN TEENAGERS REPORT THAT</p>
<p>THEY USE TIKTOK, QUOTE, ALMOST CONSTANTLY.</p>
<p>THAT IS ABOVE 5 MILLION TEENAGERS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT</p>
<p>ARE ON TIKTOK. ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p>DO WE KNOW THAT IT, TACKLING TIKTOK, USERS DESIGN FEATURES</p>
<p>THAT CAN MANIPULATE USERS, INCLUDING CHILDREN AND TEENS,</p>
<p>TO KEEP THEM ENGAGED. THAT IS DESIGNED TO FEED THEM.</p>
<p>NEVER-ENDING SCREAM OF CONTENT, KEEP THEIR ATTENTION FOR HOURS</p>
<p>ON END. THIS INCLUDES CAPITALIZING ON</p>
<p>THE DESIRE FOR OTHERS APPROVAL THROUGH LIKE FEATURES, BRAIN ON</p>
<p>THE FEAR OF MISSING OUTS, PUSHY NOTIFICATIONS, SO FORTH.</p>
<p>AGAIN, YOU&rsquo;RE PART OF AN INDUSTRY THAT SAT UP TO DO</p>
<p>THIS. YOU, IN SOME SENSE, DON&rsquo;T</p>
<p>APPEAR TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOURSELVES IN REACHING OUT AND</p>
<p>FINDING THAT NEW USER, AND THEN HOLDING ON TO THEM.</p>
<p>ON TIKTOK ITSELF, THEY&rsquo;VE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THESE</p>
<p>FEATURES, AND OTHERS, LIKE THE ENDLESS SCHOOL FEATURE, CAN</p>
<p>HAVE AN OUTSIZED EFFECT ON TEENS.</p>
<p>WE&rsquo;VE BEEN DISCUSSING HOW YOUR APP ONLY INTENSIFIES THAT HARM.</p>
<p>BY AMPLIFYING DANGEROUS CONTENT AND MISINFORMATION.</p>
<p>I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO BE TOO PATERNALISTIC HERE, BECAUSE WE</p>
<p>HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE.</p>
<p>WE&rsquo;VE GOT TIKTOK USERS THAT ARE WATCHING THIS HEARING.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M SURE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN IDEAS ABOUT HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>IS BEING MANAGED BY TIKTOK, AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.</p>
<p>THEY LIKE TO ACCESS THE PLATFORMS, AND THEY SHOULD BE</p>
<p>ABLE TO DO THAT SAFELY. SO IT CERTAINLY IN THEIR</p>
<p>INTERESTS, AND THEY CAN DRIVE THIS CONVERSATION, I, THINK</p>
<p>PERFECTLY WELL. IT&rsquo;S NOT A FAIR FIGHT, IS IT?</p>
<p>THE ALGORITHMS ON ONE SIDE OF THE SCREEN, THE HUMAN BRAIN IS</p>

<p>CONTINUE USING THE APP IF THEY WANT TO.</p>
<p>I MEAN, LET&rsquo;S FACE IT, OUR TEENS ARE SMARTER THAN WE ARE</p>

<p>ARE YOU MEASURING HOW THESE SCENES CONTINUE TO EXCEED THE</p>
<p>60 MINUTES OF TIME ON THAT APP? &raquo; WE UNDERSTAND THOSE</p>

<p>WANT TO JUMP BETTER THIS, BUT IT JUST DOESN&rsquo;T SEEM TO KEEP</p>
<p>IMPROVING. OF THESE WERE HEARING STORIES</p>
<p>OF OUR CHILDREN, AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT</p>

<p>THE WAY PEOPLE USE TIKTOK IN OTHER PLATFORMS SIMILAR TO</p>

<p>MY QUESTION &ndash; THE INSTANCES THAT USES C DRUG</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT, AND THEY GIVE A CODE TO GO TO ANOTHER SIDE.</p>
<p>MY QUESTION, AS YOU WORK WITH OTHER PLATFORMS TO &ndash;</p>
<p>ISN&rsquo;T PERMITTED TO JUMP FROM ONE PLATFORM TO OTHERS.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;LL CHECK WITH MY TEAMS. I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITHIN OUR</p>

<p>INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT WE STAND BY THESE PROBLEMS.</p>
<p>THE VIOLET OF CONTENT SHOULD NOT BE A LOT OF MANY PLATFORMS,</p>
<p>IN MY OPINION. &raquo; WHAT&rsquo;S KIND OF FRUSTRATING</p>
<p>TO ALL OF THIS IS WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT&rsquo;S HAPPENING ON YOUR</p>
<p>SIDES, AND OTHERS, IN PARTICULARLY WE KNOW, BECAUSE</p>
<p>WE&rsquo;VE DONE RESEARCH, THAT YOU CAN&rsquo;T HAVE ACCESS TO ILLICIT</p>
<p>DRUG INFORMATION, WHICH IS WITH YOUR COMPANY IN CHINA.</p>
<p>IT IS ABSOLUTELY, IF YOU CAN PREVENT IT ON, ONE OF THE OTHER,</p>
<p>YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOP IT FROM MOVING FORWARD.</p>
<p>AND YET YOU DON&rsquo;T KNOW &ndash; WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPAND ON HOW</p>
<p>THIS COMPANY CAN PREVENT THAT? I KNOW YOU DON&rsquo;T &ndash;</p>
<p>BUT THEY DON&rsquo;T ALLOW IT. IT HAPPENS ON YOUR PLATFORM.</p>
<p>WHAT&rsquo;S THE DIFFERENCE? &raquo; FIRST OF, ALL THE MAJORITY</p>
<p>OF THE CONTENT ON TIKTOK IS FUN, ENTERTAINING, AND INFORMATIVE</p>
<p>TO OUR USERS. OTHERS THAT HAVE &ndash;</p>
<p>COME PUBLISHED THIS CONTENT ON ILLEGAL DRUGS AND &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>THE BAD ACTORS DON&rsquo;T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS DOUYIN.</p>

<p>THE &raquo; TIKTOK U.S. EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE COMPARED TO OTHER</p>

<p>BECAUSE YOU PREVENT IN CHINA, BUT YOU CAN PREVENTED HERE.</p>
<p>WHAT&rsquo;S THE DIFFERENCE, THAT&rsquo;S WHY MASKING?</p>

<p>REPLICATES, EXASPERATED, DISCRIMINATION THAT IS ILLEGAL</p>
<p>UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS LAW. AS WELL AS EXCLUDE IMPORTANT</p>
<p>DIALOGUE ABOUT SENSITIVE TOPICS, LIKE RACE, FROM OCCURRING ON</p>
<p>THE PLATFORM. FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS DISTURBED BY</p>
<p>REPORTS THAT TIKTOK CONTENT MODERATION ALGORITHM FLYING</p>
<p>TOWARDS LIKE BLACK, OR BLACK LIVES MATTER.</p>
<p>AS INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT. SO MY FIRST QUESTION, MR., YOU</p>
<p>DO YOU AGREE THE PLATFORMS LIKE TIKTOK SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO</p>
<p>REGULAR AUDITS? MORE TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS?</p>
<p>TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE POLICIES HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON</p>
<p>COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PROTECTED CLASSES.</p>
<p>LIKE RACE, RELIGION, NATIONAL ORIGIN, OR AGENDA?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I THINK, CONGRESSWOMAN, I THINK THE PLATFORM SHOULD BE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>VERY TRANSPARENT ON WHAT THEY DO, AND DISCLOSE A LOT OF</p>
<p>INFORMATION. WE CAN GET BACK ON THE</p>
<p>SPECIFICS OF WHAT WE MEAN BY AN, AUDIT BUT I DO AGREE VERY</p>
<p>STRONGLY THAT PLATFORMS SHOULD BE VERY TRANSPARENT, AND THAT</p>
<p>IS A COMMITMENT THAT WE ARE GIVING TO THIS COMMITTEE, AND</p>
<p>ALL OUR USERS, THAT OUR PLATFORM WILL BE A PLACE FOR</p>
<p>FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. WE EMBRACE ALL DIVERSE POINTS</p>
<p>OF, YOU ALL ETHNIC MINORITIES, YOU CAN COME AND SAY WHATEVER</p>
<p>YOU WANT, AS LONG AS YOU DON&rsquo;T VIOLATE THE RULES OF SAFETY</p>
<p>THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. WE ALSO COMMIT TO BE FREE OF</p>
<p>ALL GOVERNMENT MANIPULATION. I&rsquo;M IN STRONG AGREEMENT WITH</p>
<p>WHAT YOU SAID. &raquo; MY BILL, THE ALGORITHMIC</p>
<p>ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, WOULD REQUIRE PLATFORMS TO BE</p>
<p>TRANSPARENT ABOUT THEIR ALGORITHMS.</p>
<p>MEASURE DISPARITY IMPACT, AND REQUIRE RISK MITIGATION.</p>
<p>IT IS VITAL THAT THE CULTURE OF THE UNITED STATES IS REFLECTED</p>
<p>ONLINE, BUT I AM CONCERNED THE ALGORITHMS AND CONTENT</p>
<p>MODERATION PRACTICES EMPLOYED BY TIKTOK ARE IGNORANT TO THE</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTAL DIVERSITY, WHILE ALSO FAILING TO REMOVE CONTENT</p>
<p>THAT IS HARMFUL. LIKE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE</p>
<p>MATERIAL, HATE SPEECH, OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM CONTENT.</p>
<p>MY NEXT QUESTION TO YOU, IT&rsquo;S MY QUESTION &ndash;</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT USERS MUST BE IN GOOD STANDING</p>
<p>TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION FROM TIKTOK&rsquo;S CREATOR FUND.</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE, THEY CAN&rsquo;T HAVE VIOLATED COMMUNITY GUIDELINES.</p>
<p>IS THAT CORRECT? &raquo; THERE ARE SOME DETAILS THERE,</p>
<p>BUT YES. &raquo; WITH TIKTOK&rsquo;S ALGORITHM IS</p>
<p>FIGHTING CONTENT INCORRECTLY, RESULTING IN CREATORS VIOLATING</p>
<p>COMMUNITY GUIDELINES, WHEN IN FACT, THEY HAVE NOT, THOSE</p>
<p>CREATORS WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION UNDER</p>
<p>THE CRATER FOND, CORRECT? &raquo; WE DO HAVE AN APPEALS</p>
<p>PROCESS. &raquo; YOU DO HAVE AN APPEALS</p>
<p>PROCESS? &raquo; IF TIKTOK EMPLOYS ALGORITHMS</p>
<p>THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY MISS REMOVE CONTENT FROM BLACK</p>
<p>READERS, IT&rsquo;S DISPROPORTIONATELY SILENCES AND</p>
<p>EXCLUDES BLOCK RAIDERS FROM COMPENSATION OPPORTUNITIES.</p>
<p>THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS IN PARALLEL TO THE LACK OF</p>
<p>ADEQUATE RECOGNITION, ATTRIBUTION, AND COMPENSATION</p>
<p>TO BLOCK CREATIVES FOR THEIR CONTENTS.</p>
<p>THE EXPLOITATION, CULTURAL MISAPPROPRIATIONS, THE ERASURE,</p>
<p>OF BLACK RATE OF OWNERSHIP OF THEIR FASHION, ART, AND MEDIA,</p>
<p>IS NOTHING NEW. WE NEED TRANSPARENCY,</p>
<p>ACCOUNTABILITY, AND BOLD ACTION TO MITIGATE AGAINST</p>
<p>MISINFORMATION, BIAS, AND EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN</p>
<p>COMMUNITIES FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT ON</p>
<p>PLATFORMS LIKE TIKTOK. SO LET ME JUST SAY THIS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY, I AM CONCERNED</p>
<p>ABOUT AND ALGORITHMIC ACCOUNTABILITY.</p>
<p>I AM NOT CLEAR THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION HOLDS THOSE</p>
<p>VALUES. SO I WANT TO ASK THAT YOU TAKE</p>
<p>A LOOK AT THIS, BECAUSE THE IS ALL PART OF PARCEL OF WHAT WE</p>
<p>ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p>PLATFORMS. AND THEN MISAPPROPRIATION, THE</p>
<p>WAYS IN WHICH THOSE ALGORITHMS CAN DISCRIMINATES WITHIN THE</p>
<p>CONTEXT OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM.</p>
<p>WITH THAT, MADAM CHAIR, I YIELD BACK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSWOMAN, IS IT OKAY IF I JUST VERY QUICKLY RESPOND.</p>

<p>THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. &raquo; UNFORTUNATELY, WE ONLY HAVE</p>

<p>THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WELCOME TO THE MOST BIPARTISAN</p>

<p>COMMITTEE IN CONGRESS. WE MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE ON HOW</p>
<p>TO GET, THERE BUT WE CARE ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.</p>
<p>WE CARE ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. WE SURE AS HECK CARE ABOUT OUR</p>
<p>CHILDREN. WE SURE DO.</p>
<p>AND THAT&rsquo;S WHY YOU&rsquo;RE HERE TODAY, BECAUSE TWO THIRDS OF</p>
<p>ALL THE YOUTH AND OUR COUNTRY ARE ON YOUR APP.</p>
<p>THEY SPEND AN AVERAGE OF 95 MINUTES ON YOUR APP, AND</p>
<p>RESEARCH IS SHOWN THAT TIKTOK IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE PLATFORM</p>
<p>OUT THERE. THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT</p>
<p>WE&rsquo;VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT HAS BEEN HAD THE MOST ADVANCED</p>
<p>ALGORITHM. AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY</p>
<p>KNOWS, THUS IDOLS WEEK FOR EVERYONE, BUT THERE ARE THOSE</p>
<p>ON THIS COMMITTEE, INCLUDING MYSELF, WHO BELIEVE THAT THE</p>
<p>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IS ENGAGED IN PSYCHOLOGICAL</p>
<p>WARFARE. THROUGH TIKTOK.</p>
<p>TO DELIBERATELY, INFLUENCE U.S. CHILDREN.</p>
<p>YOU KNOW, YOU SEE BEHIND ME, IF YOU LOOK BEHIND ME, MR. CHU,</p>
<p>YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE ON</p>
<p>TIKTOK. YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BELL</p>
<p>CRITERIA, KNOW ABOUT THE BLACKOUT CHALLENGE, YOU KNOW</p>
<p>ABOUT THE NIGHT QUO CHICKEN CHALLENGE.</p>
<p>THE BENADRYL CHALLENGE. THE DRAGONS BREATH LIQUID</p>
<p>NITROGEN CHALLENGE. I WANT TO ASK YOU, THERE IS A</p>
<p>SISTER ACT IN CHINA &ndash; I&rsquo;M SORRY IF I&rsquo;M BUTCHERING THE</p>
<p>PRONUNCIATION. DO THEY HAVE THE SAME THINGS</p>
<p>OUT THERE? SO THEY HAVE THIS KIND OF</p>
<p>CHALLENGES?</p>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, I&rsquo;M VERY GLAD YOU ASKED THIS QUESTION.</p>

<p>THAT&rsquo;S WHY I&rsquo;M ASKING YOU THIS.</p>

<p>WHY IS IT THAT TIKTOK CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO IDENTIFY</p>
<p>AND MODERATE THESE KINDS OF HARMFUL VIDEOS?</p>
<p>WE&rsquo;VE ALREADY HEARD, GOT BLESS YOU, FROM PARENTS WHO ARE HERE</p>
<p>WITH US WHO HAVE LOST CHILDREN. I SUBMIT TO YOU EVERYBODY UP</p>

<p>TELL ME WHY. &raquo; THIS IS A REAL INDUSTRY</p>

<p>THIS IS TIKTOK. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TIKTOK.</p>
<p>WHY IS IT THAT YOU CAN&rsquo;T CONTROL THIS?</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE IN GIVING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE, AND</p>
<p>I WANT TO THANK YOU, IT&rsquo;S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE VIDEO</p>
<p>THAT THREATEN THE LIFE OF THE CHAIRWOMAN HAS BEEN REMOVED.</p>
<p>THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. SORRY WE HAD TO BRING IT TO</p>
<p>YOUR ATTENTION HERE, BUT IT&rsquo;S BEEN REMOVED.</p>
<p>TELL ME WHY THIS IS GOING ON? &raquo; IT&rsquo;S AN INDUSTRY CHALLENGE</p>
<p>FOR EVERYONE OPERATING &ndash; &raquo; OKAY, SO MUCH FOR INDUSTRY</p>
<p>CHALLENGE. LET&rsquo;S SHIFT GEARS REAL QUICK.</p>
<p>I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BIOMETRICS.</p>
<p>I WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY WE, CAN YOU SAY TO ME RIGHT NOW</p>
<p>WITH 100% CERTAINTY, THAT TIKTOK DOES NOT USE THE PHONES</p>
<p>CAMERA TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONTENT THAT ELICITS PUPIL</p>
<p>DILATION SHOULD BE AMPLIFIED BY THE ALGORITHM?</p>
<p>CAN YOU TELL ME THAT? &raquo; WE DO NOT COLLECT BODY, THEY</p>
<p>SWORE VOICE DATA TO IDENTIFY OUR USERS.</p>
<p>WE DO NOT. &raquo; YOU DON&rsquo;T?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>NO. THE ONLY FACE DATA THAT WE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>COLLECT IS WHEN YOU USE THE FILTERS TO HAVE SUNGLASSES ON</p>
<p>YOUR FACE, WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOUR EYES ARE.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WHY DO YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE EYES ARE?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ARE THEY NOT DILATED? &raquo; THAT DATA IS LOCATED ON YOUR</p>
<p>DEVICE AND DELETED AFTER. AGAIN, WE DO NOT COLLECT BODY,</p>
<p>FACE OR VOICE DATA TO IDENTIFY USERS.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. IT&rsquo;S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT</p>

<p>THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE EYES. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHAT AGE</p>
<p>THEY ARE THAN? &raquo; WE RELY ON AGE DATING &ndash;</p>
<p>DATING. &raquo; AGE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THAT IS WHEN YOU ASK THE USER WHAT AGE THEY ARE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>THERE&rsquo;S ALSO TOOLS WHERE WE LOOK AT THE PUBLIC PROFILE, TO</p>
<p>GO THROUGH THE VIDEOS THAT THEY POST, TO SEE WHETHER &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BOY, THAT&rsquo;S CREEPY. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THAT.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>IT IS PUBLIC. SO IF YOU POST A VIDEO, YOU</p>

<p>CHOOSE IT TO GO PUBLIC, THAT&rsquo;S HOW YOU GET PEOPLE TO SEE YOUR</p>

<p>MATCHES AT THE AGE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE FOR OUR INDUSTRY BECAUSE PRIVACY</p>

<p>WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TIKTOK. HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT</p>

<p>ORDER. THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA, MR. C√ÅRDENAS FOR FIVE MINUTES.</p>
<p>THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIRWOMAN. I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY</p>
<p>FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO HAVE THIS IMPORTANT HEARING REGARDING</p>
<p>TIKTOK AND ITS EFFECT ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE</p>
<p>AMERICAN CHILDREN AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECT, NOT POTENTIAL,</p>
<p>BUT THE EFFECTS IT HAS HAD AND MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE WHEN IT</p>
<p>COMES TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND MISINFORMATION AND</p>
<p>DISINFORMATION THAT PERMEATES ON TIKTOK.</p>
<p>IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT, I THINK, MOST AMERICANS OR MOST PARENTS</p>
<p>THINK TIKTOK IS THIS INNOCENT LITTLE THING WHERE KIDS GET ON</p>
<p>THERE AND DO A LITTLE DANCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.</p>
<p>TIKTOK AS MUCH, MUCH MORE, AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, AND I</p>
<p>THANK THEM FOR BRINGING UP SOME OF THESE SERIOUS ISSUES,</p>
<p>LITERALLY LIFE AND DEATH ISSUES, THAT TIKTOK IS RIGHT IN THE</p>
<p>MIDDLE OF. AND ALSO, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO</p>
<p>WITNESS TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT MY COLLEAGUE,</p>
<p>MISS CAMMACK, BROUGHT UP THOSE TWO POSTERS AND SINCE THEN</p>
<p>TIKTOK HAS TAKEN THEM DOWN. SINCE THEN, NOT BEFORE THEN.</p>
<p>ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT, MR. CHEW? &raquo; I WAS BRIEFED DURING THE</p>
<p>BREAK THAT THEY WERE TAKEN DOWN, CONGRESSMAN.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT WAS UP FOR</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>APPARENTLY 40 SOMETHING DAYS, 41 DAYS, AND YET IN THE MIDDLE</p>
<p>OF THIS HEARING IT WAS BROUGHT DIRECTLY TO YOUR ATTENTION, AND</p>
<p>AS A RESULT, IT HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN SO QUICKLY?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT GOES TO SHOW THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>SURE THAT ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF USERS COME FOR A</p>
<p>GOOD EXPERIENCE, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BAD ACTORS DO</p>
<p>NOT VIOLATE. &raquo; YES, AND THE WAY THAT YOU</p>
<p>CAN MAKE SURE, MISTER CHEW, IS YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU</p>
<p>CHOOSE TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES, MORE MONEY, INTO MORE ABILITY</p>
<p>TO PULL DOWN DAMAGING AND DEADLY INFORMATION FROM YOUR</p>
<p>PLATFORM. ARE YOU INVESTING MORE AND MORE</p>
<p>AND MORE EVERY DAY INTO BRINGING DOWN THAT KIND OF</p>
<p>CONTENT? THAT IS MY QUESTION.</p>
<p>ARE YOU? &raquo; YES.</p>
<p>AND I&rsquo;M COMMITTED TO INVESTING MORE IN THIS REGARD, TO STAY ON</p>
<p>TOP OF IT. &raquo; RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED</p>
<p>STATES, MANY LANGUAGES ARE USED AND SPOKEN.</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE, TIKTOK IN THE UNITED STATES IS BEING USED IN</p>
<p>MANY LANGUAGES. SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO</p>
<p>SPANISH LANGUAGE, ARE YOU DEDICATING MORE RESOURCES TODAY</p>
<p>THAN YOU DID MONTHS AGO OR YEARS AGO, ON MAKING SURE THAT</p>
<p>YOU ARE COMBING THROUGH THAT CONTENT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF</p>
<p>THE CONTENT IS DANGEROUS OR DAMAGING OR DEADLY, THAT YOU</p>
<p>ARE BRINGING IT DOWN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YES, WE ARE INVESTING IN MORE SPANISH LANGUAGE CONTENT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>MODERATION. AND YES, ONCE WE IDENTIFY</p>
<p>VIOLATING CONTENT, WE TAKE IT DOWN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THANK YOU. AND YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY IS NOT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO COMMIT TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS</p>
<p>TO THIS COMMITTEE. SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FORWARD</p>
<p>TO THIS COMMITTEE. AGAIN, I&rsquo;M NOT ASKING FOR TRADE</p>
<p>SECRETS, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME SEMBLANCE OF</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING AS TO HOW MUCH YOU ARE INVESTING WITH THE</p>
<p>NUMBER OF BODIES AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE NUMBER OF</p>
<p>RESOURCES IN MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE INVESTING MORE IN</p>
<p>PULLING DOWN CONTENT THAT IS EITHER DEADLY OR DANGEROUS ON</p>
<p>YOUR PLATFORM. CAN YOU FORWARD THAT TO THE</p>
<p>COMMITTEE? &raquo; I WILL CHECK WITH MY TEAM</p>
<p>AND GET BACK TO YOU. &raquo; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
<p>I APPRECIATE THAT OPPORTUNITY. AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER, IT</p>
<p>MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE FUNNY, BUT YOU HAVE IN FACT BEEN ONE OF</p>
<p>THE FEW PEOPLE TO UNITE THIS COMMITTEE.</p>
<p>MEMBERS, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, TO BE IN AGREEMENT</p>
<p>THAT WE ARE FRUSTRATED WITH TIKTOK.</p>
<p>WE ARE UPSET WITH TIKTOK. AND YES, YOU KEEP MENTIONING</p>
<p>THAT THERE ARE INDUSTRY ISSUES THAT NOT ONLY TIKTOK BASIS, BUT</p>
<p>OTHERS. YOU REMIND ME A LOT OF MICS</p>
<p>OCHBERG. WHEN HE CAME HERE I SAID TO MY</p>
<p>STAFF, YOU REMINDS ME OF FRED ASTAIRE.</p>
<p>A GOOD DANCER WITH WORDS. AND YOU ARE DOING THE SAME</p>
<p>TODAY. A LOT OF YOUR ANSWERS ARE A BIT</p>
<p>NEBULOUS. THEY ARE NOT YES OR NO.</p>
<p>SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.</p>
<p>YES OR NO, IS YOUR REVENUE GOING UP AT TIKTOK MONTH OVER</p>
<p>MONTH? OR YEAR OVER YEAR?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YES, OUR REVENUE IS GOING UP YEAR OVER YEAR.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AND WITH THAT, SOME OF THE ANSWERS I WOULD LIKE YOU TO</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>FORWARD TO THIS COMMITTEE ARE, ARE YOU INVESTING MORE AND MORE</p>
<p>MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTENT THAT IS DANGEROUS AND</p>
<p>OR DEADLY, THAT YOU ARE INVESTING MORE RESOURCES IN</p>
<p>THAT ASPECT OF YOUR EXPENDITURES AND YOUR</p>
<p>COMMITMENT TO YOUR USERS AND YOUR ORGANIZATION?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YES, I COMMIT TO THAT. WE ARE INVESTING MORE AND WE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. &raquo; OKAY.</p>
<p>MY LAST QUESTION IS THIS, ARE YOU A CHINESE COMPANY?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TIKTOK IS A COMPANY THAT IS NOW HEADQUARTERED IN SINGAPORE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>AND LOS ANGELES. &raquo; OKAY.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN MAINLAND CHINA.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>OUR USERS ARE NOT &ndash; IN A LOT OF COUNTRIES AROUND</p>
<p>THE WORLD. &raquo; OKAY.</p>
<p>IS THERE A CORPORATION THAT HAS ANY AUTHORITY ABOVE TIKTOK?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TIKTOK IS A SUBSIDIARY OF FINANCE, WHICH IS FOUNDED BY A</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>CHINESE BIT &ndash; FOUNDER.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AND BYTEDANCE IS A CHINESE COMPANY?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BYTEDANCE OWNED MANY BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE IN</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>CHINA. &raquo; IS IT OR IS IT NOT A CHINESE</p>
<p>COMPANY? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, THE WAY WE LOOK</p>
<p>AT IT IT WAS FOUNDED BY CHINESE &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;M NOT LOOKING HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>FACT, IS IT A CHINESE COMPANY OR NOT?</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE, BILL IS AN AMERICAN COMPANY.</p>
<p>THEY HAVE ACTIVITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD.</p>
<p>IS IT A CHINESE COMPANY? &raquo; I FREQUENTLY HAVE THESE</p>
<p>DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHERS ON WHAT IS A COMPANY THAT IS NOW</p>
<p>GLOBAL. &raquo; THAT&rsquo;S OKAY.</p>
<p>I PREFER YOU WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION AND STOP DANCING</p>
<p>GLOBALLY ON IT. MADAM CHAIR, MY TIME HAS</p>
<p>EXPIRED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>

<p>GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA, MR. OBERNOLTE.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THINK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. CHEW, IT&rsquo;S NICE TO SEE YOU</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>AGAIN. IF I COULD BRING US BACK TO</p>
<p>30,000 FEET FOR A MOMENT, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE</p>
<p>AFRAID OF HERE, WHAT WE FEAR MIGHT HAPPEN.</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES AND TIKTOK IS NOT UNIQUE IN THIS,</p>
<p>GATHER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF USER DATA AND USE POWERFUL A.I.</p>
<p>TOOLS TO USE THAT DATA TO MAKE A REALLY ACCURATE PREDICTIONS</p>
<p>OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR. THEN THEY SEEK TO MANIPULATE</p>
<p>THAT BEHAVIOR. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT</p>
<p>JUST TIKTOK, IT&rsquo;S ALL OUR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THAT ARE</p>
<p>DOING THIS. ULTIMATELY, THE SOLUTION IS TO</p>
<p>AN COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL PRIVACY LEGISLATION THAT WILL</p>
<p>PREVENT THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR, OR AT LEAST ALLOW USERS TO</p>
<p>CONSENT TO IT. THAT IS SOMETHING I KNOW THE</p>
<p>CHAIR IS WORKING ON, THE RANKING MEMBER.</p>
<p>I HOPE THIS COMMITTEE WILL ACT ON THAT THIS YEAR.</p>
<p>THE SPECIFIC CONCERN HERE THOUGH IS IN REGARDS TO TIKTOK.</p>
<p>THAT THIS TYPE OF CAPABILITY FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF</p>
<p>FOREIGN COUNTRIES, IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>IMPLICATIONS. THAT IS WHY CONGRESS IS GETTING</p>
<p>INVOLVED ON THIS ISSUE. SO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE</p>
<p>PROPOSED PROJECT TEXAS IN AN EFFORT TO ALLEVIATE THESE FEARS</p>
<p>SO I WANT TO ASK YOU SOME SPECIFIC TECHNICAL QUESTIONS</p>
<p>ABOUT PROJECT ACCESS, AND THE WAY YOU BELIEVE IT WILL SOLVE</p>
<p>THIS PROBLEM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE</p>
<p>SAID IN TESTIMONY IS THAT PART OF PROJECT TEXAS WILL HAVE</p>
<p>ENGINEERS AT ORACLE GOING THROUGH THE SOURCE CODE FOR</p>
<p>TIKTOK. HOW LARGE IS THAT KOBE&rsquo;S?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WELL, IT&rsquo;S NOT SMALL. BUT IT&rsquo;S NOT JUST ORACLE,</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, WE ARE ALSO INVITING OTHER THIRD-PARTY</p>
<p>MONITORS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF</p>
<p>FIGURING OUT THE BEST PARTNERS. &raquo; WE ARE TALKING MILLIONS,</p>
<p>TENS OF MILLIONS OF LINES OF CODE, HOW BIG IS THE BASE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT IT&rsquo;S SOMETHING THAT WE BELIEVE CAN</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>BE DONE. AGAIN, I WANT TO SAY THAT I</p>
<p>HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANOTHER COMPANY, AMERICAN OR NOT &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I UNDERSTAND. &raquo; TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YOU ARE IN A KIND OF UNIQUE POSSESSION TO ANSWER THESE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>CONCERNS OF CONGRESS. SO ARE THEY GOING THROUGH THE</p>
<p>CODE PROJECT THE APP, OR THE APP AND THE SERVER CODE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THE TECHNICAL DETAILS, BUT IT&rsquo;S</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>COMPREHENSIVE INCLUDING THE SOFTWARE THAT POWERS, A LOT OF</p>
<p>THE SOFTWARE, THAT POWERS THE EXPERIENCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALONG WITH THAT TAKE? &raquo; I NEED TO GET BACK YOU &ndash;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>TO YOU ON THE TIMELINE, BUT WE ARE PROGRESSING QUITE WELL ON</p>
<p>PROJECT TEXAS. WHENEVER WE HIT A MILESTONE, I</p>
<p>COMMIT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OKAY. SO I&rsquo;M WONDERING, BECAUSE I&rsquo;M</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ALSO CONCERNED AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER, ABOUT THE PROCESS IN</p>
<p>WHICH NEW CODE IS INTRODUCED INTO THE CODE BASE.</p>
<p>DO YOU USE A SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</p>
<p>AT TIKTOK? &raquo; THE WAY WE PLAN FOR NEW CODE</p>
<p>TO BE DONE IS THAT, EVEN BEFORE THE CODE BECOMES LIKE, IT HAS</p>
<p>TO BE REVIEWED. THE CHANGES HAVE TO BE</p>
<p>REVIEWED. &raquo; OKAY, SO YOU ARE TALKING</p>
<p>ABOUT A CODE REVIEW. THAT&rsquo;S ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE</p>
<p>FOR YOU. THAT&rsquo;S GOOD.</p>
<p>SO THE CODE REVIEW, IS IT DONE WITH THE TEAM OF ENGINEERS OR</p>
<p>JUST WITH A SINGLE ENGINEER? &raquo; IT&rsquo;S GOING TO BE A TEAM</p>
<p>EFFORT. YEAH.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OKAY. AND THAT&rsquo;S GOING TO BE DONE AT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ORACLE OR ELSEWHERE? &raquo; IT&rsquo;S GOING TO BE DONE IN ONE</p>
<p>OF OUR TRANSPARENCY CENTER SO THAT, WE STILL NEED TO MAKE</p>
<p>SURE THE CODE ITSELF IS SECURE. SO YEAH.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WHAT I&rsquo;M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE COAT MIGHT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>BE WRITTEN BY SOMEONE NOT IN THE UNITED STATES, BEFORE THE</p>
<p>CODE IS INTEGRATED IT IS REVIEWED IN A CODE REVIEW BY A</p>
<p>TEAM OF ENGINEERS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S THE PLAN. &raquo; OKAY.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>AND BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION</p>
<p>MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE</p>
<p>INTEGRATION OF THAT CODE CHANGE INTO THE REST OF TIKTOK KOBE&rsquo;S?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT IS WE HAVE BUILT A TEAM OF</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>AMERICAN POSTURAL WITH SECURITY CONDUCT &ndash;</p>
<p>CREDENTIALS. WHO YOU BELIEVE WORKED FOR THE</p>
<p>SECRET SERVICE. &raquo; WHAT SOLUTION IS IT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I WOULD NEED TO CHECK AND GET BACK TO YOU ON THE DETAILS.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OKAY, SPECIFICALLY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS TO MAKE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>SURE THAT THIS ISN&rsquo;T SOMETHING THAT THE TOP HAS CREATED</p>
<p>CUSTOM.</p>
<p>MANY COMPANIES DO THAT. THAT WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD HAVE</p>
<p>TO REVIEW THE SOURCE CODE FOR THAT AS WELL FOR SECURITY.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YES. &raquo; HOW DO YOU PROTECT AGAINST</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THREATS LIKE THE MALICIOUS ACTOR BEING HIRED, NOT BY</p>
<p>TIKTOK, BUT BY ORACLE, FOR EXAMPLE, OR BY U.S. DS?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THE APPROACH THAT MOST COMPANIES TAKE THESE THINGS IS</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>TO HAVE SEVERAL LAYERS OF MONITORING TO MAKE SURE THAT</p>
<p>EVERYTHING THAT SOMEONE HAS REVIEWED, THERE&rsquo;S A SECONDARY</p>
<p>REVIEW. SO ONE MALICIOUS ACTOR IS NOT</p>
<p>ABLE TO CREATE THE DAMAGE. BUT YOU RIGHTLY POINT IT OUT,</p>
<p>THESE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS ARE INDUSTRY PROBLEMS.</p>
<p>EVERY COMPANY HAS TO DEAL WITH THEM.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>LET ME ASK YOU A SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THAT.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>IN THINKING ABOUT, IF I WERE A MALICIOUS ACTOR, A SOFTWARE</p>
<p>ENGINEER ON ONE OF YOUR PROJECT, HOW I WOULD GO ABOUT WRITING</p>
<p>MALICIOUS CODE. I WOULD NOT PUT IT RIGHT THERE</p>
<p>AND SAY, HEY, I MALICIOUS. I WOULD PUT UNRELATED LINES OF</p>
<p>CODED DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE CODE THAT WORK TOGETHER TO DO</p>
<p>SOMETHING MALICIOUS. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT COULD GET</p>
<p>CAUGHT? &raquo; AGAIN, WE HAVE TO RELY ON</p>
<p>THIRD-PARTY EXPERTS. I THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH</p>
<p>EXPERTS TO CATCH THESE THINGS. THE WORK ON DATA SECURITY, ALL</p>
<p>DATA SECURITY, IS NEVER PERFECT.</p>
<p>BUT WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF OVERSIGHT TO KEEP IT SAFER THAN</p>
<p>ANY OTHER EXPERIENCE. &raquo; I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT, MY</p>
<p>CONCERN IS THAT I DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE IT IS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE TO</p>
<p>ACCOMPLISH WHAT TIKTOK SAYS IT WILL ACCOMPLISH THROUGH PROJECT</p>
<p>TEXAS. I JUST THINK THERE ARE TOO MANY</p>
<p>BACK DOORS THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO ALLOW THAT TO BE POSSIBLE.</p>
<p>AND I THINK A MALICIOUS ACTOR WOULD SUCCEED IN INSERTING</p>
<p>MALICIOUS CODE IN THERE IF THEY WANTED TO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M OUT OF TIME. I HOPE WE GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO</p>
<p>TALK MORE ABOUT THIS. I YIELD BACK MADAM CHAIR.</p>

<p>THIS MEETING, AND MR. CHEW FOR TESTIFYING TODAY.</p>
<p>AS SCREEN TIME INCREASES, SO DO INHERENT RISKS.</p>
<p>AND WITH OUR LIBERATION AND POPULARITY OF NEW SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p>PLATFORMS, SO DOES THE POTENTIAL TO REACH DANGEROUS,</p>
<p>PROVOCATIVE, AND OFTEN CARAMEL &ndash;</p>
<p>HARMFUL CONTENT. MY FEAR, THE ABUSE OF COLLECTED</p>
<p>DATA. SO REPRESENT &ndash;</p>
<p>AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, I CAN SPEAK</p>
<p>FROM EXPERIENCE ON HOW SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BEEN USED TO TARGET</p>
<p>MEMBERS OF THE MICHIGAN DELEGATION, INCLUDING A PLOT TO</p>
<p>KIDNAP OUR GOVERNOR, AND HOW IT CAN BE WEAPONIZED TO PERPETUATE</p>
<p>HARMS TOWARDS INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES.</p>
<p>AND YOU SAW IT FIRSTHAND HOW IT TARGETED THE CHAIR OF THIS</p>
<p>COMMITTEE. TODAY, MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ON</p>
<p>BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE RAISED LEGITIMATE CONCERNS</p>
<p>ABOUT PROTECTING CHILDREN ONLINE, MISINFORMATION AND</p>
<p>SECURING OUR DATA. CONCERNS THAT I SHARE, THAT HAS</p>
<p>BEEN SAID BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES, OUR BIPARTISANLY</p>
<p>SHARED. I THINK IN MANY WAYS, THESE</p>
<p>MYRIAD OF ISSUES HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE DATA</p>
<p>PRIVACY LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ENSURE THE SAFETY AND &ndash;</p>
<p>INTEGRITY OF EVERY AMERICAN&rsquo;S DATA, ON EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p>PLATFORM, AND MITIGATE POTENTIAL HARM&rsquo;S.</p>
<p>ONE IMPORTANT AREA OF CONCERN I HAVE REGARDING DATA COLLECTION</p>
<p>IS GEOLOCATION DATA. HOW IT CAN BE ABUSED.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;VE SEEN IT ABUSED. I HAVE SEEN WOMEN DIE BECAUSE</p>
<p>IT HAS BEEN ABUSED. THE SUBJECT HAS DANGEROUS</p>
<p>IMPLICATIONS FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, PEOPLE</p>
<p>SEEKING MEDICAL CARE, AND PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM</p>
<p>POTENTIAL PREDATORS. MR. CHEW, IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU</p>
<p>WROTE THAT CURRENT VERSIONS OF THE APP DO NOT COLLECT PRECISE</p>
<p>OR APPROXIMATE GPS INFORMATION FROM U.S. USERS.</p>
<p>YES OR NO ANSWERS, PLEASE. MR. CHEW, HAVE ANY PRIOR</p>

<p>AS MR. CHEW, A FATHER OF A 16 YEAR OLD THAT LIKES SOCIAL</p>
<p>MEDIA A LOT OF YOUR EVASIVENESS TODAY IN ANSWERING MANY OF</p>
<p>THESE QUESTIONS REALLY DISTURBS ME.</p>
<p>I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE TEENAGERS OF TODAY, THEY REALLY</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T WANT TO BE ON FACEBOOK. THEY WANT YOUR PLATFORM.</p>
<p>YOU ARE ASKED TO COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TO TESTIFY ABOUT</p>
<p>MANY THINGS. A LOT OF US ARE WORRIED ABOUT</p>
<p>OUR KIDS, OUR PERSONAL DATA. AS THE CO-CHAIR OF THE</p>
<p>CONGRESSIONAL VOTING RIGHTS CAUCUS, I&rsquo;M ALSO WORRIED THAT</p>
<p>TIKTOK IS THE WORLD&rsquo;S MOST POWERFUL, AND EXTENSIVE,</p>
<p>PROPAGANDA MACHINE, ALLOWING THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TO</p>
<p>USE TIKTOK&rsquo;S PLATFORM TO INFLUENCE PUBLIC OPINION AND</p>
<p>UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS.</p>
<p>I HAVE A REPORT CALLED, TIKTOK AND FACEBOOK FAILED TO DETECT</p>
<p>ELECT ELECTION DISINFORMATION IN THE U.S. WHILE YOUTUBE</p>
<p>SUCCEEDS. THIS WAS PUBLISHED BY THE NON</p>
<p>PROFIT &ndash; SOCIETY TEAM AT NYU.</p>
<p>THE PURPOSE OF THE TESTS TO DETECT PLATFORMS LIKE TIKTOK</p>
<p>AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN DETECT AND TAKE FALSE POLITICAL</p>
<p>ADS TARGETED AT U.S. VOTERS, YOUNG VOTERS, AHEAD OF LAST</p>
<p>YEAR&rsquo;S MIDTERM ELECTIONS. ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT 94% OF</p>
<p>ELECTION DISINFORMATION ADS TESTED WERE APPROVED BY YOUR</p>
<p>PLATFORM. AGAIN, THAT IS 90% OF ADS</p>
<p>CONTAINING FALSE AND MISLEADING ELECTION INFORMATION WENT</p>
<p>UNDETECTED ON TIKTOK. JUST TO ADD SOME COLOR TO THE</p>
<p>TYPE OF MISLEADING ADS THAT WERE APPROVED BY TIKTOK THIS</p>
<p>INCLUDED ADS THAT WE&rsquo;RE LIVE ON TIKTOK THAT SAID THE WRONG</p>
<p>ELECTION DAY. AND I CAN ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO</p>
<p>VOTE TWICE. YOU DO KNOW THAT VOTING TWICE</p>
<p>AS A FELONY, MR. CHEW? YOU DO KNOW THAT IT IS ILLEGAL</p>
<p>TO VOTE TWICE? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, ANY</p>
<p>MISINFORMATION THAT COMES AROUND POLITICAL ACTION IS</p>
<p>SOMETHING WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I AM PARTICULARLY TROUBLED BY THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION</p>

<p>BECAUSE IT CAN RUN RAMPANT ON TIKTOK.</p>
<p>GIVEN THAT TIKTOK, AGAIN, Y&rsquo;ALL ARE APPEALING TO A VERY YOUNG</p>
<p>AND DIVERSE USER BASE. THAT IS EXACTLY THE PEOPLE THAT</p>
<p>WE HAVE SEEN TARGETED, TIME AND TIME AGAIN, WITH VOTER</p>
<p>SUPPRESSION CAMPAIGNS RUN BY MALICIOUS ACTORS.</p>
<p>MR. CHEW, DO YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT IT IS COMPLETELY</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE THAT 90% OF THESE ADS WERE UNDETECTED ON YOUR</p>
<p>PLATFORM. CAN YOU DETAIL FOR US, RIGHT</p>
<p>NOW, TIKTOK&rsquo;S POLICY REGARDING ELECTION MISINFORMATION AND</p>
<p>PAID POLITICAL ADS AND HOW THE COMPANY MONITOR SUCH</p>
<p>INFORMATION AND HOW YOU PLAN TO GET THAT NUMBER DOWN TO ZERO?</p>

<p>EXPRESS THEIR POINTS OF VIEW FREELY.</p>

<p>TEXAS SHOULD GIVE US ANY CONFIDENCE IN TIKTOK&rsquo;S ABILITY</p>
<p>TO LOCALIZE U.S. DATA AND DISCONTINUE ACCESS TO THAT DATA</p>
<p>TO BYTEDANCE EMPLOYEES AND CHINA.</p>
<p>WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A</p>
<p>TIKTOK EXECUTIVE APPEAR BEFORE CONGRESS AND GIVE SWORN</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ABOUT THE COMFORT WE SHOULD TAKE IN TIKTOK&rsquo;S U.S.</p>
<p>BASED RESOURCES. WHILE TIKTOK DATA SECURITY</p>
<p>PRACTICES WERE BEING SCRUTINIZED BY THE U.S.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT, UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT FROM A &ndash;</p>

<p>IT REMAINS AN URGENT PRIORITY FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC</p>

<p>IT TOOK SOME 40 DAYS TO TAKE IT DOWN.</p>
<p>I GUESS I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED. IF YOUR TEAM DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE THE</p>

<p>FOR DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND THAT THE PARENTS HAVE A</p>

<p>WITH THEIR FAMILY. &raquo; SO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS A</p>
<p>SUFFICIENT SAFETY MECHANISM FOR AN EIGHT YEAR OLD TO BE ABLE TO</p>
<p>ACCESS TIKTOK? &raquo; AN EIGHT YEAR OLDS</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE WOULD BE SO HIGHLY RESTRICTED THAT EVERY SINGLE</p>
<p>PIECE OF CONTENT THAT HE OR SHE WILL SEE WILL BE DICTATED BY</p>
<p>COMMON SENSE, OR THIRD-PARTY CHILD SAFETY EXPERTS, AND THE</p>
<p>EIGHT YEAR OLD WILL NOT BE ABLE TO POST.</p>
<p>THE EIGHT YEAR OLD WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE ANY PERSON LIVE</p>

<p>EXPERIENCE. I BELIEVE, YES, IT IS AN</p>

<p>I NOTICE THAT THEY WILL BE RUNNING FOR ABOUT AS LONG AS</p>
<p>YOU&rsquo;LL BE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR TODAY.</p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY I ONLY GET YOU FOR FIVE MINUTES INSTEAD OF A</p>
<p>MARATHON I WOULD LIKE TO DO A SPRINT WITH YOU.</p>
<p>I WANT TO GO BACK UP TO THAT 30,000 FEET LEVEL.</p>
<p>WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT SECTION 230 WAS CREATED TO</p>
<p>PROTECT PLATFORMS LIKE YOURS FROM LAWSUITS WHEN YOU</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTE INFORMATION? &raquo; &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DON&rsquo;T OVERCOMPLICATE IT. &raquo; I UNDERSTAND.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>YEAH. &raquo; SO WOULD YOU AGREE THAT</p>
<p>THERE IS A LINE DRAWN BETWEEN PUBLISHERS OF INFORMATION AND</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTORS OF INFORMATION, SPECIFICALLY IN THE SECTION 230</p>
<p>LANGUAGE. &raquo; I THINK THAT 2:30 THE</p>
<p>RE-COMPLEX TOPIC. &raquo; REMEMBER, BUT REMEMBER WE</p>
<p>ARE AT 30,000 FEET. YOU&rsquo;RE PLATFORM DISTRIBUTES</p>
<p>CONTENT THAT OTHER PEOPLE CONTENT.</p>
<p>ONE OF THE EARLY CHALLENGES TO SECTION 230 WAS WHEN A</p>
<p>WELL-REFUSED TO TAKE DOWN A POST OF SOMEBODY THAT HAD</p>
<p>INAPPROPRIATELY PUT DOWN A PHONE NUMBER, ASSOCIATED THE</p>
<p>PHONE NUMBER WITH OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBINGS.</p>
<p>THE COURTS RULED A WHALE WAS NOT LIABLE FOR THAT POST,</p>
<p>BECAUSE OF SECTION 230. I WANT TO DO A HYPOTHETICAL &ndash;</p>
<p>WHO I&rsquo;M GOING TO DO THE ABSURD TO TRY TO MAKE A POINT.</p>
<p>HERE LET&rsquo;S SUPPOSE, HYPOTHETICALLY, THAT AOL,</p>
<p>INSTEAD OF JUST POSTING THAT ACTUALLY WANTED TO MAGNIFY THAT</p>
<p>VOICE. THEY TOOK OUT AN AD IN THE WALL</p>
<p>STREET JOURNAL LINKING THE PHONE NUMBER WITH THE OKLAHOMA</p>
<p>CITY BOMBING. BUT SUPPOSED AND STOP THERE,</p>
<p>BUT THEY WENT FURTHER AND THEY TOOK OUT A SUPER BOWL AD</p>
<p>LINKING THAT PHONE NUMBER TO THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.</p>
<p>LET&rsquo;S SUPPOSE, HYPOTHETICALLY, THEY DIDN&rsquo;T STOP THERE.</p>
<p>THEY SENT A FLYER TO EVERY HOME IN AMERICA LINKING THAT PHONE</p>
<p>NUMBER TO THE OKLAHOMA BOMBING. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS, WOULD</p>
<p>AOL HAVE MOVED FROM A DISTRIBUTOR TO A PUBLISHER IN</p>
<p>THIS MADE-UP EXAMPLE? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, RESPECTFULLY I</p>
<p>&ndash; &raquo; I THINK EVERYONE CAN SEE</p>
<p>THAT THEY WOULD. THIS IS NOT OUR QUESTION,</p>
<p>MOVING THAT FAR AWAY FROM INTENT WOULD&rsquo;VE MOVED INTO</p>
<p>PUBLISHER. MY QUESTION IS, PLATFORMS ARE</p>
<p>PROTECTED BECAUSE THEY POST CONTENT.</p>
<p>BUT I WANT THIS ROOM TO SEE, NOT JUST VIEW, THAT THE</p>
<p>PROTECTION HAS LIMITS. IF A WILL MOVE TO A DISTRIBUTOR,</p>
<p>INSTEAD OF A PUBLISHER, THEY MOVE OUTSIDE OF THOSE LIMITS.</p>
<p>LET&rsquo;S TALK ALGORITHM SUPER QUICKLY.</p>
<p>WE HAVE THROWN THAT WORD AROUND A LOT TODAY.</p>
<p>LET ME HEAR AGAIN, 30,000 FEET, WE WILL USE ANOTHER PLATFORM SO</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S NOT SENSITIVE. PINTEREST.</p>
<p>I LIKE TO GO ON PINTEREST. MY WIFE AND I ARE BUILDING A</p>
<p>HOME. BUILDING A YARD RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>IF YOU WENT ON MY PINTEREST PAGE YOU WOULD SEE SWING STATS</p>
<p>AND THINGS MADE FOR MY GRANDKIDS.</p>
<p>ANOTHER HYPOTHETICAL, LET&rsquo;S SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS SOME</p>
<p>DUBIOUS INTENT INSIDE OF PINTEREST.</p>
<p>THEY DECIDE THEY WANT TO INFLUENCE JOHN CURTIS WITH</p>
<p>THESE ALGORITHMS. THEY WANT ME TO BELIEVE IT IS</p>
<p>THE END OF THE WORLD. ALL THE SUDDEN NOW I&rsquo;M BUYING</p>
<p>BOMB SHELTERS INSTEAD OF SWING SETS FOR MY KIDS.</p>
<p>HAVE THEY BECOME A PUBLISHER? AND SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTED BY</p>
<p>SECTION 230? IF YOU DON&rsquo;T CONFIDENT &ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M PRETTY SURE THE ROOM UNDERSTANDS THAT THEY ACROSS</p>
<p>THE SLANT. YOU CAN TELL ME IF YOU THINK</p>
<p>THEY HAVE OR NOT. &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, I WOULD HAVE TO</p>
<p>STUDY THAT SPECIFIC EXAMPLE AND GO BACK TO YOU.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT&rsquo;S A HYPOTHETICAL BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT AT SOME POINT THEY</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>HAVE CROSSED A LINE. THEY HAVE BECOME A PUBLISHER</p>
<p>AND A DISTRIBUTOR. WE HAVE TOUCHED ON THIS TODAY</p>
<p>BUT I WANT TO BE SUPER SPECIFIC.</p>
<p>IS IT POSSIBLE THAT TIKTOK HAD ENOUGH DATA, COULD GET ENOUGH</p>
<p>DATA ON ME BUT YOU COULD USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND</p>
<p>YOUR ALGORITHMS, AND MACHINE LEARNING TO WRITE AN ALGORITHM</p>
<p>THAT COULD PERSUADE ME TO CHANGE HOW I VIEW A POLICY</p>
<p>ISSUE? &raquo; DOES THAT POSSIBILITY EXIST?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ndash; I WILL STAY VERY HIGH-LEVEL.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT IS OUR USERS COME IN AND EXPRESS</p>
<p>WHATEVER VIEWS THEY WANT. &raquo; THAT IS NOT THE POINT.</p>
<p>THE POINT IS YOU COULD WRITE AN ALGORITHM THAT COULD CHANGE.</p>
<p>WE&rsquo;VE ACTUALLY SEEN THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED TO</p>
<p>STOP THE MUELLER CAMPAIGN SHOWS HOW TIKTOKERS ARE ATTACKING</p>
<p>CLIMATE CHANGE. I THINK THAT IS FINE AND GOOD</p>
<p>UNLESS SOMEBODY HAS INTERJECTED INTO THAT AND MAGNIFIED OR</p>
<p>DIMINISHED VOICES IN THAT. WHAT I AM PROPOSING TO YOU</p>
<p>TODAY IS THAT PUSHES THEM ACROSS THE LINE FROM A</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTOR TO A PUBLISHER IF THEY MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.</p>
<p>SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST YOUR PLATFORM, AND</p>
<p>OTHERS. MANY OF THEM HERE TODAY.</p>
<p>YOU ARE NOT NEW TO THESE ALLEGATIONS.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A PLATFORM. SOMETIME AGO THERE WAS AN</p>
<p>ALLEGATION THAT A PLATFORM RECOMMENDED ISOLATED VIDEOS.</p>
<p>WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE WEIGHT LOSS.</p>
<p>VIDEOS WE DIDN&rsquo;T TALK ABOUT IT BUT STEALING THE ELECTIONS.</p>
<p>WHATEVER THE MOTIVATION, I AM TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT AS YOU</p>
<p>MOVE BY A PUBLISHER BY MANIPULATING THIS DATA WITH</p>
<p>ALGORITHMS THE MOVE OUT OF THE PROTECTION TO 30.</p>
<p>DO YOU SEE THAT LOGIC? &raquo; THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I UNDERSTAND IT&rsquo;S VERY COMPLEX.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>BUT DO YOU SEE THE LOGIC? IN YOUR MIND, HAS TIKTOK EVER</p>
<p>STUFF TO CROSS THE LINE FROM E DISTRIBUTOR TO A PUBLISHER?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>CONGRESSMAN, AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX TOPIC.</p>

<p>TO THIS HEARING INTERESTED TO HEAR THE ACTIONS THAT TIKTOK IS</p>
<p>TAKING TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION, PROTECT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, AND</p>
<p>ENSURE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I HAVE NOT BEEN REASSURED BY</p>
<p>ANYTHING YOU SAID SO FAR. I THINK, QUITE FRANKLY, YOUR</p>
<p>TESTIMONY HAS RAISED MORE QUESTIONS FOR ME THAN ANSWERS.</p>
<p>AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY NOTED, FLAT FORMS LIKE</p>

<p>PROJECT TEXAS. YOU SAID YOU SPENT, IN YOUR</p>
<p>TESTIMONY, 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS. YOU HAVE HIRED 1500 FULL-TIME</p>
<p>EMPLOYEES. CAN I ASK FOR SOME SPECIFICS</p>
<p>ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION? THIS 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS, WHAT</p>
<p>WAS A USE FOR? THE EMPLOYEES?</p>
<p>WHERE THE PEOPLE YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT YOU TRANSFERRED OVER?</p>

<p>UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS. WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?</p>
<p>HOW MANY PEOPLE? WHAT WILL THEY BE DOING?</p>
<p>AS I PUT A FINER POINT ON THIS, ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS, WE CAME</p>
<p>HERE HOPING TO TAKE SOME ACTIONS THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE</p>
<p>OUR CONCERTS AT FEARS WE. HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS, WE HAVE A</p>
<p>LOT OF FOLKS HERE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE CONTENT</p>
<p>CREATORS. FOR US WE WERE LOOKING FOR</p>
<p>ACTION. WE WANTED TO SEE, MAKE US FEEL</p>
<p>LIKE WE REALLY CAN TRUST, AS YOU USE THE WORD.</p>
<p>WHAT I LEAVE HERE WITH IS THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT</p>
<p>YOUR COMPANY &ndash; I LEARNED THAT YOU HAVE</p>
<p>PERSONALIZED DATA ADVERTISING FOR KIDS AS YOUNG AS 13.</p>
<p>WE HAVE HEARD UNTIL PROJECT TEXAS IS SUPPOSEDLY STOOD UP</p>
<p>ENGINEERS AND TO HAVE ACCESS TO PERSONAL DATA.</p>
<p>THAT MEANS THE ENGINEERS AND CHINA HAVE ACCESS TO PERSONAL</p>
<p>DATA OF 13-YEAR-OLDS IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>I THINK BUT THAT REALLY SUMMARIZES WHY YOU SEE SO MUCH</p>
<p>BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS AND CONCERN ABOUT YOUR COMPANY.</p>
<p>I IMAGINE THAT THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON.</p>

<p>PERSECUTED THE UYGHUR POPULATIONS?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSWOMAN, IF YOU USE OUR APP AND YOU OPEN IT YOU</p>

<p>WILL FIND OUR USERS WHO GET ALL SORTS OF CONTENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THAT IS NOT MY QUESTION. DO YOU AGREE THAT THE CHINESE</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT HAS PERSECUTED THE UYGHUR POPULATION?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT IS DEEPLY CONCERNING TO HEAR ABOUT ALL ACCOUNTS OF</p>

</blockquote>
<p>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. MY ROLE HERE IS TO EXPLAIN WHAT</p>
<p>OUR PLATFORM DOES. &raquo; I THINK YOU&rsquo;RE BEING A</p>
<p>BASES. IT IS A PRETTY EASY QUESTION.</p>
<p>DO YOU AGREE THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS PERSECUTED THE</p>
<p>UYGHUR POPULATION. &raquo; CONGRESSWOMAN, I&rsquo;M HERE TO</p>
<p>DESCRIBE TO TALKING WHAT WE DO AS A PLATFORM.</p>
<p>AS A PLATFORM WE ALLOW USERS TO FREELY &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WHAT WE HEARD TODAY, WELL, YOU DIDN&rsquo;T ANSWER THE QUESTION.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>EARLIER TODAY CHAIRMAN ROGERS ASKED YOU, AND I QUOTE, HAVE</p>
<p>ANY MODERATION TOOLS BEEN USED TO REMOVE CONTENT ASSOCIATED</p>
<p>WITH THE UYGHUR GENOCIDE, YES OR NO?</p>
<p>YOUR ANSWER, WE DO NOT REMOVE THAT KIND OF CONTENT.</p>
<p>YET, IN 2019 TIKTOK SUSPENDED THE ACCOUNT OF FEROZA AS THESE,</p>
<p>AND AMERICAN 17 YEAR OLD AFTER SHE PUT OUT A VIDEO OF THE</p>
<p>UYGHUR GENOCIDE. YOUR ANSWER, SIR, DOES NOT</p>
<p>ALIGN WITH HISTORY. &raquo; THAT PARTICULAR CASE WAS A</p>
<p>MISS MODERATION. I BELIEVE THE VIDEO HAD A PHOTO</p>
<p>OF OSAMA BIN LADEN. I BELIEVE &ndash;</p>

<p>NO I LOOKED IT UP THAT WAS A DIFFERENT POST THAT THEY BAN.</p>

<p>MY NEXT QUESTION, INDIA BANNED THE USE OF TIKTOK IN 2020 NEW</p>
<p>ZEALAND HAS BANNED THE INSTALLATION OF TIKTOK ON</p>
<p>DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE COUNTRY&rsquo;S PARLIAMENTARY WEBSITE</p>
<p>CANADA BANNED THE INSTALLATION OF TIKTOK ON GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>DEVICES. THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS BANNED</p>
<p>THE TIKTOK APP FROM GOVERNMENT ON DEVICES.</p>
<p>BELGIUM BANNED TIKTOK FROM GOVERNMENT PHONES.</p>
<p>EUROPEAN UNION BANNED THE INSTALLATION OF TIKTOK ON</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT DEVICES. ALL SIDED SECURITY RISK WITH</p>
<p>THE COMPANY&rsquo;S DATA COLLECTION IN CONNECTION TO THE CHINESE</p>
<p>COMMUNIST PARTY. RECENTLY, OUR U.S. FBI DIRECTOR,</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER WRAY, SAID ABOUT TIKTOK, QUOTE, THIS IS A TOOL</p>
<p>THAT IS ULTIMATELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CHINESE</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT. IT, TO ME, SCREAMS OUT WITH</p>
<p>NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS. MR. CHEW, HOW CAN ALL OF THESE</p>
<p>COUNTRIES AND OUR OWN FBI DIRECTOR HAVE BEEN WRONG?</p>
<p>I THINK A LOT OF RISKS ARE POINTED OUT OUR HYPOTHETICAL</p>
<p>AND THEORETICAL. I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE.</p>
<p>I AM EAGERLY AWAITING DISCUSSIONS WHERE WE CAN TALK</p>
<p>ABOUT EVIDENCE AND WE CAN THEN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT ARE</p>
<p>BEING RAISED. &raquo; YES.</p>
<p>MY NEXT QUESTION REVOLVES AROUND AN ARTICLE, INDIA BANNED</p>
<p>TIKTOK IN 2020. MARCH 21ST FORBES ARTICLE</p>
<p>REVEALED HOW TROVES OF PERSONAL DATA OF INDIAN CITIZENS WHO</p>
<p>ONCE USED TIKTOK REMAINS WILDLY ACCESSIBLE TO EMPLOYEES AT THE</p>
<p>COMPANY AND ITS BEIJING BASED PARENT, BYTEDANCE.</p>
<p>A CURRENT TIKTOK EMPLOYEE TOLD FORBES THAT NEARLY ANYONE WITH</p>
<p>BASIC ACCESS TO COMPANY TOOLS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES IN CHINA,</p>
<p>CAN EASILY LOOK UP THE CLOSEST CONTACTS AND OTHER SENSITIVE</p>
<p>INFORMATION ABOUT ANY USER. THIS CURRENT TIKTOK EMPLOYEE</p>
<p>ALSO SAID, QUOTE, IF YOU WANT TO START A MOVEMENT &ndash;</p>
<p>IF YOU WANT TO DIVIDE PEOPLE, IF YOU WANT TO DO ANY OF THE</p>
<p>OPERATION TO INFLUENCE THE PUBLIC ON THE APP, YOU CAN JUST</p>
<p>USE THAT INFORMATION TO TARGET THOSE GROUPS.</p>
<p>WHY WOULD A CURRENT TIKTOK EMPLOYEE SAY THIS IF IT WASN&rsquo;T</p>
<p>TRUE? &raquo; THIS IS A RECENT ARTICLE.</p>
<p>I HAVE ASKED 19 TO LOOK INTO. AS FAR AS I KNOW &ndash;</p>
<p>WE HAVE RIGOROUS DATA ACCESS PROTOCOLS.</p>
<p>THERE&rsquo;S REALLY NO SUCH THING WHERE ANYONE CAN ACCESS THE</p>
<p>TOOLS. I DISAGREE WITH A LOT OF THE</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS WHEN THAT. &raquo; MADAM CHAIR I REQUEST</p>
<p>UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT THE FORMS MUCH RUNNING FOR A 2023</p>
<p>ARTICLE BE ADDED TO THE RECORD. &raquo; WITHOUT OBJECTION.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER THE REST OF MY TIME TO MR.</p>

<p>ABERNETHY. &raquo; THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.</p>
<p>MR. CHEW, I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE ASKING THE QUESTION WE</p>
<p>WERE &ndash; AROUND A TIME LAST TIME.</p>
<p>AS PART OF PROJECT TEXAS, YOU&rsquo;RE GOING TO HAVE ENGINEERS</p>
<p>AT ORACLE REVIEW THE ALGORITHM &ndash;</p>
<p>THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM THAT TIKTOK USES TO ENSURE THEY</p>
<p>ARE FREE FROM FOREIGN INFLUENCE.</p>
<p>AS YOU AND I WERE DISCUSSING, REVIEWING THE ALGORITHMS DON&rsquo;T</p>
<p>DO ANYTHING. THE SIMPLE &ndash;</p>
<p>THE SECRET SAUCE IS IN THE DATA USED TO TRAIN THEM AND THE</p>
<p>OUTCOMES YOU ARE ASKING THEM TO PREDICT.</p>
<p>WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT? &raquo; NO I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT</p>
<p>WITH THE RECORDING MONITORING YOU CAN IDENTIFY A LOT OF THE</p>
<p>MOTIVATION OF THE CONE. WITH ENOUGH THIRD-PARTY EXPERTS</p>
<p>YOU CAN IDENTIFY A LOT OF WHAT THE CODE IS DESIGNED TO DO.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HOW WOULD YOU VERIFY THAT YOU COULDN&rsquo;T ASK THE ALGORITHM</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>FOR A DIFFERENT OUTCOME THAN THE ONE THAT THE REST OF THE</p>
<p>SOURCE CODE IS ASKING FOR? &raquo; THE ALGORITHM, AGAIN IT&rsquo;S</p>
<p>VERY TECHNICAL, IT WOULD BE TRAINED BASED ON WAYS FOR</p>
<p>EXAMPLE. THOSE ARE THINGS WE CAN VERIFY.</p>
<p>YOU CAN USE ON LIKES OR NOT. &raquo; IF YOU COULD GIVE US A</p>
<p>WRITTEN RESPONSE ON THAT OUT APPRECIATED.</p>
<p>THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR, I YIELD BACK.</p>
<p>LADY YIELDS BACK, THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.</p>
<p>THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE, FOR FIVE MINUTES, THE GENTLEMAN</p>
<p>FROM FLORIDA MR. SOTO. &raquo; THINK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.</p>
<p>THE GENIE IS REALLY OUT OF THE BOTTLE ON THIS NOW, SO TO</p>
<p>SPEAK. 150 MILLION AMERICANS ARE NOW</p>
<p>ON TIKTOK. THAT IS ALMOST HALF OF AMERICA.</p>
<p>THEY ARE EXPRESSING THEMSELVES WITH THEIR ARE, MUSIC, POETRY,</p>
<p>SHORT FILMS, COMEDY, AMONG OTHER CREATIVE EXPRESSIONS.</p>
<p>MANY OF THEM ARE INSPIRING TALENTED YOUNG PEOPLE.</p>
<p>WE ALSO IN THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A</p>
<p>DARKER SIDE TO IT, RIGHT? THE VIOLENCE, ADULT THEMES,</p>
<p>DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, SEXUALIZATION, SUICIDE.</p>
<p>ALL MAJOR ISSUES ON TIKTOK BUT ALSO TWITTER, FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE,</p>
<p>AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.</p>
<p>THE SOLUTION, AS I SEE, IS TO REGULATE TIKTOK AND OTHER</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. THAT JOB, MR. SOTO, AS YOU KNOW</p>
<p>REALLY FALLS TO US. THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS BY PIPE</p>
<p>PARTISAN COMMON GROUND WE HAVE HAD A FEDERAL DEVICE BAND THAT</p>
<p>WAS VOTED ON BY PARTISAN OMNIBUS.</p>
<p>I CO-INTRODUCED A BILL WITH MY DEAR FRIEND, REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>CAMMACK ABOUT THAT FEDERAL &ndash; MADAM CHAIR I THINK THE FIRST</p>
<p>LADY&rsquo;S PRIVACY. WE HAVE TO PASS CONGRESS GOT</p>
<p>OUT OF THIS COMMUNITY BUT ELUDED US IN THE LAST CONGRESS.</p>
<p>I AM REALLY HOPING THAT WE CAN GET THAT DONE I AM REALLY</p>
<p>EXCITED ABOUT HEARING ABOUT THAT FROM FOLKS.</p>
<p>THE OTHER THING IS TIKTOK NEEDS TO BE AN AMERICAN COMPANY WITH</p>
<p>AMERICAN VALUES. ITS TIES TO THE CHINESE</p>
<p>COMMUNIST PARTY &ndash; THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE</p>
<p>CRITICAL AS WE LOOK AND GO FORWARD.</p>
<p>WE ALL AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR KIDS.</p>
<p>THE COMMITTEE SHOULD CONSIDER BANNING THE USE UNDER 13 OF NOT</p>
<p>JUST TIKTOK BUT ALL SOCIAL MEDIA.</p>
<p>EMPOWER PARENTS. IN ADDITION TO HAVE RULES OF</p>
<p>THE ROAD 14 THAT A 13 17 SO FAMILIES CAN DO WHAT IS RIGHT</p>
<p>FOR THEIR FAMILIES. FOR PRIVACY, THAT IS ON US.</p>
<p>INTERNET PRIVACY IS ON US. AS FAR AS BEING AN AMERICAN</p>
<p>COMPANY, MR. CHEW AS YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE ON INVESTMENTS</p>
<p>AND THE UNITED STATES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REFUSED</p>
<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENTS THAT AFFECT NATIONAL SECURITY.</p>
<p>RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR COMPANY ABOUT THE</p>
<p>ORACLE SETUP WHERE YOU TALKED ABOUT SERVERS IN THE AMERICAN</p>
<p>COMPANY IN AMERICA, TEXAS. ORACLE WOULD THEN MONITOR THE</p>
<p>ALGORITHM. PRESSURE IS MOUNTING.</p>
<p>MR. CHEW WOOD TICKED UP BE PREPARED TO DIVEST FROM</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE AND CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TIMES IT&rsquo;S THE DEPARTMENT</p>
<p>OF THE TREASURY INSTRUCTED YOU ALL TO DO SO?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT I THINK WE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>NEED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF PRIVACY.</p>
<p>I AGREE WITH YOU. I DO NOT THINK OWNERSHIP IS THE</p>
<p>ISSUE HERE. WITH A LOT OF RESPECT, AMERICAN</p>
<p>SOCIAL COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE A GOOD TRACK RECORD WITH DATA</p>
<p>PRIVACY IN USERS SECURITY. LOOK IT &ndash;</p>
<p>WAS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. SO, I DO THINK THAT IT IS NOT</p>
<p>ALL ABOUT OWNERSHIP. IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE</p>
<p>FRANTIC TEXAS. MAKE SURE WE ARE PROTECTED AND</p>
<p>FIREWALL-ING U.S. USER DATA. FROM ONLINE FOREIGN ACCESS,</p>
<p>GIVING THIRD PARTIES COMING IN TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS AND</p>
<p>MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS ACCOUNTABLE.</p>
<p>WE ARE GIVING TRANSPARENCY AND THIRD-PARTY MONITORING.</p>
<p>THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH TRAGIC TEXAS.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WELL, I WOULD AT LEAST ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO START</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>HAVING THE DIALOGUE SHOULD THAT BE WHERE THE PRESIDENT AND</p>
<p>CONGRESS ENDS UP GOING. THE THIRD THING IS ON PARENTS.</p>
<p>I HAD A CONSTITUENT ON &ndash; A PARENT OF TWO TEENAGERS, 14</p>
<p>IN 18 YEARS OLD, BOTH OF WHOM HAVE BEEN HARMED BY SOCIAL</p>
<p>MEDIA. TIKTOK&rsquo;S ALGORITHM SUPPLY MY</p>
<p>14-YEAR-OLD SON WITH A CONTINUOUS CREAM OF</p>
<p>INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT AND HAVE NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE HIS</p>
<p>PERCEPTION OF ALL FEMALES. I NOTICED THE ATTENTION SPAN OF</p>
<p>BOTH MUNTEAN SAYS CHANGE TO DECREASE DRAMATICALLY.</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE MADE MY DAUGHTER INSECURE LEADING TO A</p>
<p>EATING DISORDER AND ULTIMATELY DEPRESSION.</p>
<p>WHAT SAFEGUARDS DO YOU HAVE? WHY SHOULD RETAIL BRANDY OF</p>
<p>LAKE NONNA ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP HER PROTECT HER CHILDREN?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE HAVE DIFFERENTIATED EXPERIENCE.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I MENTIONED THE EXPERIENCE BELOW 13 THAT IS VERY</p>
<p>RESTRICTED. IF THEY ARE BELOW 13 OR 17,</p>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS.</p>
<p>FIRST, THE CONTENT THAT YOU SEE &ndash;</p>
<p>WE MAKE SURE THAT WE REMOVE THINGS THAT COULD BE MATURE</p>
<p>THEMES FROM YOUR FEED. WE ALSO, BY DEFAULT, DO NOT</p>
<p>ALLOW UNDER 16 TO USE DIRECT MESSAGING.</p>
<p>WE DO NOT ALLOW UNDER 16&rsquo;S &ndash; WE SAID THEIR ACCOUNTS THE</p>
<p>PRIVATE BY DEFAULT. THEY CANNOT GO VIRAL.</p>
<p>IF THEY ARE BELOW 18 WE SHUT OFF SOME FEATURES.</p>
<p>YOU&rsquo;RE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ICE DREAMS.</p>
<p>NEITHER ARE YOU ALLOWED TO SEND VIRTUAL GIFTS.</p>
<p>WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD</p>
<p>AND ENSURE WE ARE GIVING UNDER 18 TEENAGERS ON A PLATFORM &ndash;</p>
<p>TODAY, WE ARE NOT A MINORITY OF THESE DEBATES THAT WE STILL</p>
<p>TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. &raquo; MR. CHEW, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO</p>
<p>CONTINUE THINKING ON HOW TO GET THE WORLD OUT TO GET THE WORD</p>
<p>OUT ON SOME OF THESE TOOLS, AS. WELL AS WE CRAFT A PRIVACY LAW</p>
<p>THAT WILL HELP PROVIDE WELL NEEDED REGULATION TO SOCIAL</p>
<p>MEDIA COMPANIES ACROSS THE NATION.</p>
<p>THANK, YOU I YIELD BACK. &raquo; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.</p>
<p>THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM INDIANA, MISTER</p>
<p>PENCE, FOR FIVE MINUTES. &raquo; THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN,</p>
<p>ROGERS. RANKING MEMBER PALLONE FOR</p>
<p>HOLDING THIS HEARING. I LOVE BOTH OF YOUR OPENING</p>
<p>REMARKS. AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DISCUSSED</p>
<p>TODAY MY INCREASINGLY REGIONAL WORLD LEAVES HOOSIERS AND OTHER</p>
<p>AMERICANS IN THE DARK ABOUT WHO HAS ACCESS TO INFORMATION.</p>
<p>FOUR TIKTOK USERS THAT COULD BE THIRD-PARTY DATA BROKERS,</p>
<p>ADVERTISING WITH THE COMMUNIST CHINESE PARTY.</p>
<p>TIKTOK AGGRESSIVELY FEEDS ADDICTIVE CONTENT AND CONTENT</p>
<p>USERS TO GLEAN MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL DATA THAT IS WORTH</p>
<p>A FORTUNE. FOR HOOSIERS WATCHING AT HOME</p>
<p>THIS ISN&rsquo;T JUST DATA ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE SPORTS TEAM.</p>
<p>IF THERE REALLY ARE 150 MILLION USERS IN THE U.S., THIS</p>
<p>SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THE CCP HAS A FINGER ON THE POSSIBLE MOST</p>
<p>HALF OUR NATIONS POPULATION. I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE</p>
<p>THIS WEEK I DECIDED THAT I WOULD ASK MY CONSTITUENTS IN</p>
<p>SOUTHERN INDIANA TO SHARE THEIR STORIES WITH ME.</p>
<p>I WENT OUT MONDAY NIGHT AND WE GOT 800 RESPONSES IN LESS THAN</p>
<p>12 HOURS, OKAY? LET ME SHARE A COUPLE OF THOSE</p>
<p>WITH YOU. MY CONSTITUENTS SHARED, QUOTE,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M A MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR. MOST MEN TEENAGE CLIENTS ARE ON</p>
<p>TIKTOK. THEY SPENT HOURS ON LINE BEING</p>
<p>NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED BY OTHERS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;VE SEEN KIDS EXPERIENCE SELF HARM, GENDER DYSPHORIA, AND</p>
<p>MANY MENTAL ILLNESSES THEY HAVE PICKED UP FROM TIKTOK.</p>
<p>I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO HAVE TIKTOK.</p>
<p>I WILL ALGORITHMS ARE AFFECTING OUR CHILDREN.</p>
<p>CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING MORE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION FROM</p>
<p>SCREEN TIME BUT THEY DO NOT CARE.</p>
<p>THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THEIR ALGORITHMS BECAUSE IT IS</p>
<p>FINANCIALLY LUCRATIVE FOR THEM TO KEEP THEIR KIDS ADDICTIVE.</p>
<p>OTHER PARENTS SAY WE LET OUR DAUGHTER TRY IT OUT.</p>
<p>THE FEED WAS CONTINUOUSLY SUGGESTING SEXUALLY EXPLICIT,</p>
<p>STUPID, INVOLVED OR VIDEOS. WE DISCONTINUED IT WITHIN A</p>
<p>WEEK. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MORE.</p>
<p>LIKE I SAID, 800, OKAY? IN YOUR TESTIMONY, MR. CHEW,</p>
<p>YOU WALK THROUGH A NUMBER OF SUPPOSED ACTIONS TAKEN BY A</p>
<p>COMPANY TO CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND EMPOWER PARENTS</p>
<p>TO OVERSEE CONTENT SEEN BY THE CHILDREN.</p>
<p>VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING WE HAVE HEARD REFLECTS THE OPPOSITE.</p>
<p>SOME OF YOUR ANSWERS ARE LITTLE CONFUSING.</p>
<p>YOU KNOW, ALL OF THOSE SITTING HERE AND MAYBE WATCHING ON</p>
<p>C-SPAN, THIS IS THE 32ND HEARING WE HAVE HELD ABOUT</p>
<p>PRIVACY AND BIG TECH. EACH HEARING I HAVE BEEN PART</p>
<p>OF WE HAVE HEARD THE SAME STORIES ABOUT OUR CONSTITUENTS</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE AND THE SAME PROMISES FOR BIG TECH TO DO</p>
<p>BETTER. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,</p>
<p>THIS DISGUSTING AND DANGEROUS CONTENT LITTERED ACROSS YOUR</p>
<p>PLATFORM IS NOT JUST JUSTIFIABLE.</p>
<p>IT IS UNCONTROLLABLE. AMERICAN DATA IS NOT SAFE.</p>
<p>BIG TECH IS DOING NOTHING TO PROTECT THE.</p>
<p>PUTTING ASIDE THE DANGERS OF THE CCP INVOLVEMENT, AND AFTER</p>
<p>THESE 32 HEARINGS, I BELIEVE IT IS ACTUALLY TIME TO CHANGE THE</p>
<p>NARRATIVE. CHANGE THE FOCUS, CHANGE THE</p>
<p>OUTCOME BY TALKING ABOUT THE MONEY YOU ARE MAKING AT TIKTOK.</p>
<p>MR. CHEW, I HAVE A QUESTION, HOW MUCH REVENUE GENERATED PER</p>
<p>USER? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN &ndash;</p>
<p>PRIVATE COMPANY WE&rsquo;RE NOT GONNA TELL ME.</p>
<p>DOES EACH USER RECEIVE A COMPARABLE BENEFIT FROM THE</p>
<p>AMOUNT OF PROFITEER DATA BRINGS TO THE COMPANY?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE SHARE REVENUE SOME CREATORS WHO PRODUCE ONE MINUTE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>PLUS INFO ON CONTENT. &raquo; WHEN AM I GOING TO GET PAID</p>
<p>FOR THE DATA YOU ARE SELLING, OR YOU ARE GETTING REVENUE FROM</p>
<p>ADVERTISERS, WHEN AM I GOING TO GET PAID FOR THE DATA YOU ARE</p>
<p>GETTING FROM MY CHILDREN, MY GRANDCHILDREN, MY NEIGHBORS?</p>
<p>I THINK THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.</p>
<p>TO TALK ABOUT THE MONEY YOU ARE MAKING.</p>
<p>MAYBE THAT WILL GET YOU ALL TO DO WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I RESPECT AND UNDERSTAND YOUR OPINION.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR USERS HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>I SENT A VIDEO RECENTLY. I GOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF</p>
<p>COMMENTS. &raquo; WHAT AM I GETTING.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S A GREAT EXPERIENCE? WHAT ABOUT THESE 800 BAD</p>
<p>EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE IN THE INDIANA SIX DISTRICT HAVE BEEN</p>
<p>GETTING? &raquo; WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>YOU&rsquo;RE GONNA LOOK INTO IT? THIS IS MY 32ND BIG TECH</p>

<p>HEARING. YOU ARE ALWAYS GONNA LOOK AT.</p>
<p>ESSENTIALLY, I THINK YOU ARE ALL STALLING IS WHAT YOU&rsquo;RE</p>
<p>DOING. YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO BUY TIME</p>
<p>WHILE YOU&rsquo;RE MAKING THE 18 BILLION, PERHAPS, WHATEVER</p>
<p>YOU&rsquo;RE MAKING. &raquo; THE MAJORITY OF OUR USERS</p>
<p>HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE ON A PLATFORM.</p>
<p>IT IS A DUTY TO KEEP IT SAFE, I AGREE WITH YOU.</p>
<p>THAT IS WHY OUR COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE IS SAFETY IS A</p>
<p>PRIORITY. &raquo; I THINK IT&rsquo;S YOUR DUTY TO</p>
<p>PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU&rsquo;RE DOING.</p>
<p>MAYBE, MAYBE YOU PANG PEOPLE FOR THE INFORMATION YOU ARE</p>
<p>GETTING FROM THEM AS A WAY TO GET THAT DONE.</p>
<p>THANK YOU, I YIELD BACK. &raquo; THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.</p>
<p>THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLELADY FROM WASHINGTON,</p>
<p>MISS SCHRIER FOR FIVE MINUTES. &raquo; THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE MR.</p>
<p>CHEW. I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT</p>
<p>EVERYTHING WE ARE HEARING IN THIS CONVERSATION TODAY.</p>
<p>I APPRECIATE YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS.</p>
<p>THE ACTIONS ARE REALLY FALLING SHORT.</p>
<p>AS A PEDIATRICIAN, AND THE PARENT OF A TEENAGER, I AM</p>
<p>PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW SOCIAL MEDIA GENERALLY, AND</p>
<p>TIKTOK SPECIFICALLY, IS AFFECTING OUR KIDS AND TEENS.</p>
<p>WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS FROM TESTIMONY FROM PSYCHOLOGIST.</p>
<p>LAST YEAR THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS SOUNDED THE ALARM</p>
<p>ABOUT OUR CHILDREN&rsquo;S MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS.</p>
<p>AS A PEDIATRICIAN I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MORE</p>
<p>THAN A DECADE. IN FACT, ATTRACTS PERFECTLY</p>
<p>WITH SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT. DURING THE PANDEMIC, TEENS WHO</p>
<p>ARE MISSING OUT ON IN-PERSON INTERACTION TURNED EVEN MORE TO</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA TO CONNECT WITH FRIENDS.</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA IS DESIGNED TO BE ADDICTING.</p>
<p>YOUR PLATFORM IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE OF ALL THIS ENDLESS</p>
<p>SCROLLING KEEPS TEENS AWAY FROM RELATIONSHIPS.</p>
<p>HERE&rsquo;S WHAT&rsquo;S IMPORTANT, IT KEEPS TEAMS AWAKE ALL NIGHT</p>
<p>WELL PAST THEIR BEDTIME. &ndash;</p>
<p>IN A TIME THAT IS CRITICAL FOR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT.</p>
<p>SLEEP DEPRIVATION, ANNOYING CONTENT, CAN COST BRUSH AND,</p>
<p>ANXIETY, SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL, INATTENTION, POOR COPING SKILLS,</p>
<p>AND ACADEMIC FAILINGS. SO MR. CHEW, I WANT TO FOLLOW</p>
<p>UP A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS DISCUSSING.</p>
<p>IT IS YOUR BUSINESS MODEL TO KEEP EYES ON THE APP.</p>
<p>TO KEEP IT ADDICTIVE. I KNOW YOU LIKELY HAVE EXPERTS</p>
<p>WHO HAVE ADVISED YOU ON HOW TO DESIGN THIS TO KEEP THOSE EYES</p>
<p>ON YOUR PLATFORM FOR THE LONGEST POSSIBLE TIME.</p>
<p>I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE PSYCHOLOGIST OR OTHER HEALTH</p>
<p>EXPERTS ON STAFF LOOKING AT SCREEN TIME, HOURS OF USE, AND</p>
<p>SLEEP? &raquo; WE WORKED WITH A DIGITAL</p>
<p>WELLNESS LAB, CONGRESSWOMAN, AT THE BOSTON CHILDREN&rsquo;S HOSPITAL.</p>
<p>WE CAME UP WITH THE 60 MINUTE DEFAULT LIMIT FOR ANY USERS</p>
<p>UNDER 18. A FIRST IN OUR INDUSTRY.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THAT IS AN OPT OUT. I CAN TELL YOU, THEY WILL</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>IMMEDIATELY OPT OUT. IT IS ADDICTIVE.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S LIKE ASKING A CHAIN SMOKER NOT TO TAKE THE NEXT CIGARETTE.</p>
<p>IT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN. BY THE WAY &ndash;</p>
<p>I HAVE A QUESTION AND THEN I WILL GO BACK TO BOSTON</p>
<p>CHILDREN. MR. SARBANES ASKED EARLIER,</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF TEENS WHO ACTUALLY ADHERE TO THE 60</p>
<p>MINUTE LIMIT? &raquo; I WOULD NEED TO CHECK ON</p>
<p>THOSE NUMBERS AND GO BACK TO YOU.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I APPRECIATE THAT. I&rsquo;M GUESSING IT IS AN</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>INCREDIBLY LOW PERCENTAGE TO ACTUALLY HEED THAT.</p>
<p>AS FAR AS BOSTON CHILDREN&rsquo;S GO I KNOW YOU ARE REFERRING TO</p>
<p>THEM AS A SOURCE TO BE IDEAS TO GO OUTSIDE, GET SOME AIR, TAKE</p>
<p>SOME TIME OUT. I CAN TELL YOU AS A</p>
<p>PEDIATRICIAN I&rsquo;M GUESSING THERE SUGGESTIONS WERE A LITTLE</p>
<p>STRONGER THAN THAT. I AM WONDERING, WHAT IS THE</p>
<p>NEXT STEP? WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHEN YOU</p>
<p>FIND OUT THAT ALMOST NOBODY IS OPTING OUT AFTER 16 MINUTES?</p>
<p>TO TAKE THIS BURDEN OFF OF THE KIDS AND OFF OF THE PARENTS AND</p>
<p>CHANGE YOUR ALGORITHMS TO MAKE THEM NOT-SO-HOOKED.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE GIVE OUR PARENTS, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THE FAMILY PARENT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>TOOL. IN THAT TOOL, IF YOU PAIR IT</p>
<p>WITH YOUR TEENAGERS PHONE, YOU CAN SET THE RESTRICTION.</p>
<p>HOW MANY MINUTES. WE BELIEVE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT</p>
<p>FOR PARENTS TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR</p>
<p>TEENAGERS SO THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THE FAMILY.</p>
<p>CONGRESSWOMAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO OUR PLATFORM TO HAVE A</p>
<p>REALLY INFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE. LIKE I SAID, THERE WERE HUNDRED</p>
<p>AND 60 BILLION PIECES OF CONTENT ON STEM.</p>
<p>WE ARE CREATING A FEE DEDICATED TO THAT.</p>
<p>BOOK TALK HAS 150 BILLION &ndash; &raquo; WE ALSO HEARD TODAY THAT</p>
<p>WILL OVER 20% OF THE INFORMATION IS MISINFORMATION.</p>
<p>WE HEARD THAT ABOUT MEDICAL REMEDIES THAT ARE NOT REALLY</p>
<p>REMEDIES. WE HAVE HEARD IT ABOUT MENTAL</p>
<p>HEALTH TOPICS. THIS BECOMES A DANGEROUS,</p>
<p>ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TRAINED TO THINK VERY</p>
<p>CRITICALLY ARBEING GIVEN INFORMATION AND THINKING IT IS</p>
<p>TRUE. YOU&rsquo;VE SAID MANY TIMES THAT THE</p>
<p>DESTRUCTIVE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO KIDS, BUT IT IS.</p>
<p>WE KEEP SEEING EXAMPLES HERE. I&rsquo;M JUST WONDERING, WHAT ARE</p>
<p>YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE ALGORITHMS?</p>
<p>JUST BECAUSE YOU REMOVE SOMETHING THAT SAYS ANOREXIA,</p>
<p>BELIEVE ME, OR EATING DISORDER, THAT DOESN&rsquo;T DO IT.</p>
<p>IF YOU SHOW GIRLS REPEATEDLY SKINNY BODIES AND ADVICE ON HOW</p>
<p>TO COOK MEALS THAT ARE LESS THAN THREE AND A CALORIES, THAT</p>
<p>IS DANGEROUS. &raquo; &raquo; WE HAVE WORKED WITH,</p>
<p>FIRST OF ALL, ANYTHING THAT GLORIFIES EATING DISORDERS WE</p>
<p>REMOVE THEM FROM THE PLATFORM AS VIOLATED.</p>
<p>WE ARE WORKING WITH EXPERTS RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>IT IS A CHALLENGING PROBLEM FOR INTEGERS THREE.</p>
<p>WE ARE IDENTIFYING SOME OF THE THEMES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p>TRYING TO BUILD MODELS WEAR THE KIND OF CONTENT IS NOT CHANGE</p>
<p>FOR THE YOUNGER USERS. IT IS SOMETHING WE TAKE VERY</p>
<p>SERIOUSLY. &raquo; WE ARE SEEING IN A DISORDERS</p>
<p>AND ELEMENTARY AGE KIDS NOW. I NEED YOU TO EXPEDITE THAT</p>
<p>PROCESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. PARENTS OUT THERE ARE WORRIED.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M WORRIED AS A PEDIATRICIAN. PARENTS CANNOT TAKE THEMSELVES</p>
<p>OFF THESE PLATFORMS. KIDS, THERE IS NO WAY THEY ARE</p>
<p>GOING TO TAKE THEMSELVES OFF. WE NEED YOU TO DO YOUR PART.</p>
<p>IT MAY AFFECT YOUR BOTTOM LINE. BUT IT CAN SAVE THIS</p>
<p>GENERATION. &raquo; I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS.</p>

<p>HOLDING THIS HEARING. ACCORDING TO AN AUGUST 2022</p>
<p>ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES TIKTOK&rsquo;S IN-APP WEB BROWSER CAN</p>
<p>TRACK EVERY INDIVIDUAL HEATSTROKE MADE BY USER.</p>
<p>WE HAVE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE VARIOUS WAYS THAT THE APPS CODE</p>
<p>CAN BE USED TO MONITOR OR TRACK USERS.</p>
<p>LIKEWISE, WE HAVE HER CONCERNS THAT THIS DATA MAY NOT BE FULLY</p>
<p>ISOLATED FROM ACCESS BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY.</p>
<p>THAT SAID, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE HISTORICAL NON</p>
<p>PUBLIC U.S. PERSONAL DATA THAT YOUR COMPANY HAS ALREADY</p>
<p>AMASSED. MR. CHEW, YOU HAVE PUBLICLY</p>
<p>STATED THAT THE NON PUBLIC INFORMATION OF TIKTOK USERS IN</p>
<p>THE UNITED STATES AS BEING TRANSFERRED TOWARDS ORACLE</p>
<p>BASED CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS.</p>
<p>WILL THAT BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS WEEK?</p>
<p>BY THE END OF THIS MONTH? WHAT IS THE OUTLINE FOR DEALING</p>
<p>WITH THAT DATA THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY AMASSED?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ALL NEW DATA IS ALREADY STORED, BY DEFAULT, IN THE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ORCHID CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE &ndash; &raquo; I&rsquo;M TALKING ABOUT THE DATA</p>
<p>THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY AMASSED? &raquo; WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF</p>
<p>DELETING &ndash; &raquo; WHAT TIMELINE WITH THAT DATA</p>
<p>BE ABLE TO BE STORED? &raquo; I BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO</p>
<p>GET IT DONE THIS YEAR &ndash; &raquo; THIS YEAR.</p>
<p>THANK? HERE IT&rsquo;S NOT GOING TO OCCUR</p>
<p>ANYTIME SOON. TO BE CLEAR, UNTIL THAT DATA</p>
<p>TRANSFER HAPPENS USER DATA REMAINS ACCESSIBLE TO THE</p>
<p>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. ON MARCH 1ST OF THIS YEAR, THE</p>
<p>COMMITTEE ASKED YOU WHEN YOU PLAN TO DELETE NON PUBLIC</p>
<p>HISTORICAL U.S. USER DATA. ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, I DISAGREE WITH THIS ASSESSMENT.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CAN GET ACCESS TO THE DATA.</p>
<p>IT IS REALLY FOR &ndash; A PRIVATE COMPANY.</p>
<p>CHINESE EMPLOYEES &ndash; &raquo; YOU RESPONDED IN WRITING TO</p>
<p>THIS COMMITTEE, I HAVE THE RESPONSE, THAT WE GOT BACK FROM</p>
<p>YOU ON MARCH 7TH. JUST SIX DAYS LATER.</p>
<p>YOUR ATTORNEYS WROTE THAT THE COMPANY &ndash;</p>
<p>I AM QUOTING, THE COMPANY PLANS TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF THE</p>
<p>LEADING NON PUBLIC HISTORIC USER DATA THIS MONTH.</p>
<p>IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE PROCESS WILL BE COMPLETED THIS</p>
<p>YEAR. YOU CAME UP WITH A SUPPOSED</p>
<p>PLANNED IN THE SUMMER OF 2022. SPECIFICALLY BASED ON OUR</p>
<p>CONCERNS THAT THE COMMUNIST CHINESE GOVERNMENT WAS SPYING</p>
<p>ON U.S. USERS. YOU ONLY JUST CAME UP WITH THE</p>
<p>IDEA TO DELETE HISTORIC NON PUBLIC U.S. DATA JUST TWO WEEKS</p>
<p>AGO? LET ME READ IT AGAIN.</p>
<p>ON MARCH 7TH, YOUR ATTORNEY ZERO, AND I QUOTE, THE COMPANY</p>
<p>PLANS TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF THE LEADING NON PUBLIC</p>
<p>HISTORICAL DATA THIS MONTH. AND INTO DEBATES THE PROCESS</p>
<p>WILL BE COMPLETED THIS YEAR. MR. CHEW, DID YOU JUST COME UP</p>
<p>WITH THIS PLAN ONLY BECAUSE WE ASKED ABOUT IT ON MARCH 1ST?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>NO, WE STARTED TO LEADING &ndash; THIS &raquo; THAT IS WHAT IT LOOKS</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>LIKE TO. ME &raquo; THIS IS INCREDIBLY</p>
<p>DISAPPOINTING. WHEN YOU AGREE THAT AWAITING</p>
<p>EVEN MINUTES FOR THIS PERSONAL PRIVACY TO DETECTION IS</p>
<p>ABSOLUTELY WRONG? AND IT IS NOT IN THE BEST</p>
<p>INTEREST OF USERS?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, RESPECTFULLY THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES THAT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>USE A GLOBAL WAR FORCE, WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE.</p>
<p>WE ARE JUST TAKING ACTION. &raquo; WHAT WE&rsquo;VE ALREADY</p>
<p>ESTABLISHED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY</p>
<p>TO ACCESS PERSONAL YOU&rsquo;RE DATA, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT NO U.S.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT ELECTRONIC DEVICES SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO TIKTOK</p>
<p>PLATFORM, AS YOUR LACKLUSTER SECURITY CURRENTLY STANDS?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I DISAGREE WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DO YOU THINK ANY INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE UTILIZING THAT ON ANY</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>GOVERNMENT PLATFORM? &raquo; I THINK THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>SHOULD HAVE NO SOCIAL MEDIA APPS, NOT TARGETED TO US.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DURING THIS HEARING YOU HAVE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THAT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THERE IS A, QUOTE, DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE, YOUR WORDS, FOR</p>
<p>CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13. &raquo; THAT IS CORRECT.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. DO YOU ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>UNDER THE AGE OF 13 TO PARTICIPATE IN TIKTOK?</p>
<p>YES OR NO? &raquo; I DID JUST EXPLAIN THIS IN</p>
<p>DETAIL, THIS DOESN&rsquo;T EXIST IN SINGAPORE WHERE MY CHILDREN</p>
<p>LIVE, IF MY CHILDREN LIVED HERE, THEN YES.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY IT&rsquo;S CLEAR TO ME THAT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>TIKTOK AS A COMPANY CANNOT BE TRUSTED.</p>
<p>AND THAT AMERICANS REMAIN SIGNIFICANTLY AT RISK BECAUSE</p>
<p>OF THE TIKTOK APP. I STILL CONTEND THAT TIKTOK IS</p>
<p>THE SPY IN AMERICANS POCKETS. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT</p>
<p>TIKTOK DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES.</p>
<p>BUT UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NOT HEARD THAT FROM YOU TODAY.</p>
<p>WE HAVE NOT HEARD A COMMITMENT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE</p>
<p>PERSONAL PRIVACY THAT AMERICANS EXPECT, AND THAT AMERICANS</p>
<p>DESERVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.</p>
<p>I YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME.</p>

<p>MINUTES. &raquo; THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.</p>
<p>MR. SHOU ZI CHEW, MANY BIG TECH CEOS HAVE SAT WHERE YOU ARE</p>
<p>SITTING TODAY AND TRIED TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK LIKE THIS ONE,</p>
<p>TRAINED NOT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND WAIT FOR THE NEWS CYCLE TO</p>
<p>PASS SO THEY COULD GET ON WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL.</p>
<p>THOSE SAME EXECUTIVES WANT THIS MOMENT, TIKTOK MOMENT UNDER THE</p>
<p>MICROSCOPE TO DISTRACT CONGRESS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THE</p>
<p>VERY REAL ISSUES THAT EXIST ON THEIR PLATFORMS.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THE TABLES ON THEM.</p>
<p>WHILE U.S. BASED SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS HAVE REGRESSED ON</p>
<p>PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS, PROTECTING OUR DATA</p>
<p>PRIVACY, AND ON THE RACING TRANSPARENCY, YOU CAN LEAD AND</p>
<p>YOU SHOULD. LAST MONTH YOU ANNOUNCED THAT</p>
<p>TIKTOK WOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO ITS RESEARCHER API BUT I AM</p>
<p>CONCERNED THAT THE POLICY COULD BE MORE BARK THAN BITE, THAT IT</p>
<p>WON&rsquo;T ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE RIGOROUS RESEARCH THAT WE AS</p>
<p>LAWMAKERS AND THAT PARENTS AND EVERY DAY TIKTOK USERS NEED.</p>
<p>IN FACT YOUR TERMS OF SERVICE DEMAND THAT RESEARCHERS DELETE</p>
<p>THEIR DATA, THAT TIKTOK&rsquo;S UNILATERAL DIRECTION.</p>
<p>IT PUTS RESTRICTIONS ON HOW RESEARCHERS FINDINGS CAN BE</p>
<p>PUBLISHED AND IT ONLY ALLOWS ACCESS TO PUBLIC DATA.</p>
<p>WHICH RESEARCHERS ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO WITHIN THE APP.</p>
<p>IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE CONTENT MODERATION AND</p>
<p>ALGORITHMIC AMPLIFICATION CONCERNS THAT MY COLLEAGUES</p>
<p>HAVE RAISED HERE TODAY, AND THEN I HAVE HEARD ABOUT</p>
<p>DIRECTLY FROM PARENTS IN MY HOME STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS,</p>
<p>INDEPENDENT RESEARCH IS NOT OTHER &ndash;</p>
<p>ALGORITHM IS MAKING DECISIONS TO PROMOTE CONTENT.</p>
<p>WILL YOU COMMIT TO EXPANDING YOUR API, TO INCLUDE DATA THAT</p>
<p>WOULD LET RESEARCHERS INVESTIGATE HOW YOUR ALGORITHM</p>
<p>IS PUSHING CONTENT TO USERS, WHETHER IT&rsquo;S SHOWING UP ON YOUR</p>
<p>FOR YOU PAGE, THE HASHTAG PAGE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS I GAVE IN THE OPENING STATEMENT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>IS A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY AND THIRD-PARTY MONITORING.</p>
<p>CONGRESSWOMAN, I WILL LOOK INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT AND GET</p>
<p>BACK TO YOU. &raquo; AS WELL OF THE ALGORITHM,</p>
<p>INCLUDING DATA, ON WHAT TYPES OF USERS WERE TARGETED BY THE</p>
<p>ALGORITHM SO THAT RESEARCHERS CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT</p>
<p>CONTENT IS BEING PRIORITIZED, AND WHAT&rsquo;S BEING PUSHED TO.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AGAIN, WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY, THESE ARE VERY</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THE</p>
<p>SPECIFICS. &raquo; UNDER THE SAME PROPOSAL YOU</p>
<p>HAVE INQUIRED THAT RESEARCHERS GIVE TIKTOK QUOTE, WORLDWIDE,</p>
<p>FREE, NONEXCLUSIVE AND PERPETUAL, AND QUOTE, RIGHTS TO</p>
<p>THEIR PAPERS. THREATENING TO CLASH DIRECTLY</p>
<p>WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED PRACTICES OF EXCLUSIVE PUBLICATION WRITES</p>
<p>IN RESEARCH JOURNALS. WHY DOES TIKTOK NEED THOSE</p>
<p>RIGHTS? &raquo; I WILL NEED TO GET BACK TO</p>
<p>YOU ON THE SPECIFICS IF THAT&rsquo;S OKAY.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I DON&rsquo;T SEE HOW WE CAN EXPECT RESEARCHERS TO DO THEIR</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>WORK UNDER THESE TERMS AND THEN TOUT TRANSPARENCY.</p>
<p>I WILL SHIFT GEARS WITH THE TIME THAT I HAVE REMAINING, I</p>
<p>WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TIKTOK&rsquo;S EFFORTS TO PROTECT</p>
<p>CHILDREN AND YOUNG USERS. IN 2021 THE UK&rsquo;S AGE</p>
<p>APPROPRIATE DESIGN CODE WENT INTO EFFECT, MANDATING 15</p>
<p>STANDARDS THAT COMPANIES LIKE YOU NEED TO FOLLOW TO PROTECT</p>
<p>CHILDREN ON YOUR PLATFORM. YOU STILL OPERATE IN THE UNITED</p>
<p>KINGDOM, WHICH MEANS YOU SHOULD BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS</p>
<p>CODE. SO MY QUESTION IS SIMPLE, WILL</p>
<p>YOU COMMIT TO EXTENDING THE PROTECTIONS CURRENTLY AFFORDED</p>
<p>CHILDREN IN THE UK TO THE MILLIONS OF KIDS AND TEENS WHO</p>
<p>USE YOUR APP HERE, IN THE UNITED STATES?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE TAKE THE SAFETY OF THE YOUNGER USERS ON OUR PLATFORM</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>VERY SERIOUSLY. &raquo; THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO PROVE</p>
<p>IT. &raquo; EVERY COUNTRY IS A LITTLE</p>
<p>BIT DIFFERENT IN CONTEXT, SO LET ME LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS</p>
<p>AND BRING SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE WORLD, &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THOSE BEST PRACTICES ARE BEING EXECUTED AROUND THE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>WORLD. WE JUST WANT THE SAME FOR OUR</p>
<p>KIDS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. WHEN WE SPOKE A COUPLE OF WEEKS</p>
<p>AGO, YOU INDICATED INTEREST IN TAKING STEPS TO EARN TRUST, OUR</p>
<p>TRUST. AND TO ME, IT HAS NOT HAPPENED</p>
<p>TODAY SO FAR. BUT RATHER YOU HAVE DUCKED</p>
<p>BEHIND INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND COMPARABLE TO YOUR COMPETITORS.</p>
<p>WHICH WE KNOW ARE WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT.</p>
<p>I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THESE TERMS, THESE COMMITMENTS,</p>
<p>MAKE THE CASE FOR WHY YOU ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR AMERICAN</p>
<p>COMPETITORS. AND DO BETTER ON, THEN THEM, ON</p>
<p>TRANSPARENCY. WHAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED</p>
<p>COUNTLESS TIMES TODAY ABOUT WHICH WE DON&rsquo;T REALLY HAVE ANY</p>
<p>TANGIBLE TO POINT TO. &raquo; I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO MAKE EXCUSES</p>
<p>FOR OUR INDUSTRY OF OURSELVES, I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF WORK</p>
<p>THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S NOT PERFECT, WE NEED TO KEEP INVESTING TO STAY AHEAD OF</p>
<p>OUR GROWTH SO I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE SAFETY AND</p>
<p>CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS PART OF OUR COMPANY.</p>

<p>COMMITMENTS AND THOSE UPDATED TERMS OF SERVICE WHEN YOU WRITE</p>
<p>BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR, I YIELD</p>
<p>BACK. &raquo; GENTLELADY YIELDS BACK.</p>
<p>CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH DAKOTA, MR.</p>
<p>ARMSTRONG. &raquo; THANK, YOU MADAM CHAIR.</p>
<p>WE HAVE HEARD TODAY ABOUT INDEPENDENT COURT REVIEWS,</p>
<p>LOCATIONS AND THE CORPORATE INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN BYTEDANCE</p>
<p>AND THE CCP. BUT I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING</p>
<p>A LITTLE MORE TELLING. WHEN YOU ARE ASKED ABOUT</p>
<p>CHINESE CENSORSHIP YOU PIVOTED IMMEDIATELY TO DRUG USE IN</p>
<p>SINGAPORE. YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY TIED</p>
<p>YOURSELF IN KNOTS TO AVOID CRITICIZING THE CCP&rsquo;S TREATMENT</p>
<p>OF THE UYGHUR POPULATION AND I THINK IT BEGS THE FIRST</p>
<p>QUESTION, BEFORE WE EVER GET TO PROJECT TEXAS WHICH I WILL GET</p>
<p>TO IN A SECOND. IF THE CCP DEMANDED THAT</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE HAND OVER ALL INFORMATION ON U.S. USERS, AND</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE REFUSED, I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?</p>
<p>I WONDER IF JACK MOTT MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT AND I</p>
<p>WONDER IF HE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO GIVE.</p>
<p>IT LET&rsquo;S TALK ABOUT PROJECT TEXAS FOR A SECOND.</p>
<p>IT ENVISIONS A NEW U.S. FACED TIKTOK SUBSIDIARY.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE STATED THAT THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED, I WOULD ARGUE</p>
<p>THAT IT&rsquo;S BECAUSE IT REQUIRES CONTINUAL OVERSIGHT AND</p>
<p>MONITORING BY THE U.S. OF A PRIVATE BUSINESS BECAUSE IT</p>
<p>POSES A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT.</p>
<p>THE NEW SUBSIDIARIES BOARD WOULD REPORT TO AND BE APPROVED</p>
<p>BY STUFFINESS. CPS WOULD ALSO SPECIFY HIRING</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS INTERACTING WITH ORACLE.</p>
<p>THAT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CORPORATE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE.</p>
<p>I HAVE QUESTIONS ON WHETHER IT COMPLIES WITH CORPORATE LAW AND</p>
<p>FIDUCIARY DUTY TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE CORE CONCERN IS THAT THE</p>
<p>COURT PROPOSES UNPARALLELED INTEGRATION WITH THE U.S.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT WITH A PRIVATE COMPANY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE</p>
<p>SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT RESOURCES.</p>
<p>ALL OF THAT TO ALLOW A CONTINUING OPERATION OF A</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM THAT HAS SERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>IMPLICATIONS. THE WORKLOAD HAS ALREADY</p>
<p>DRAMATICALLY INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS WITH A 30%</p>
<p>INCREASE IN DECLARATIONS AND A 45% INCREASE OF JOINT</p>
<p>INVOLUNTARY NOTICES. THERE IS BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS</p>
<p>THAT IT NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED AS WE SPEAK.</p>
<p>CAN YOU IDENTIFY A SIMILAR CORPORATE ARRANGEMENT THAT</p>
<p>ALLOWS THE &raquo; &ndash; TO MONITOR AND ALLEGED NATIONAL</p>
<p>SECURITY RISK? &raquo; I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS</p>
<p>MATTER, I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ONES BUT I&rsquo;M NOT AN</p>
<p>EXPERT ON THIS MATTER. &raquo; THE ONLY ONE I COULD FIND IS</p>
<p>THE UK CREATED HUAWEI CYBERSECURITY EVALUATION CENTER,</p>
<p>WHO ASSESSED HUAWEI&rsquo;S TECH, TO DETECT MALICIOUS ACTIVITY IN</p>
<p>UK&rsquo;S NETWORKS. THAT HAS WORKED SO WELL, THAT</p>
<p>THE UK IS PLANNING ON PICKING HUAWEI OUT OF GREAT BRITAIN.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE STATED THAT TIKTOK HAS INVESTED 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS TO</p>
<p>PROJECT TEXAS. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY</p>
<p>DISCUSSIONS OR PROPOSALS THAT ENTAIL TIKTOK FUNDING OR</p>
<p>OFFSETTING THE COST OF XIPHIAS RULE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THOSE DISCUSSIONS, I NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THIS BUT TO</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>FIX BUT I CAN TELL YOU, YES, WE DID SPEND APPROXIMATELY 1.5</p>
<p>BILLION U.S. DOLLARS. &raquo; YOU AGREE THAT IF XIPHIAS</p>
<p>TAKES ON THIS ROLE THEY WILL NEED A MASSIVE INFLUX OF</p>
<p>DOLLARS ON HUMAN RESOURCES, RIGHT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I CANNOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THEM.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SHOULD THE U.S. GOVERNMENT EXPENSE SUCH RESOURCES TO</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>CREATE THIS EXTRAORDINARY ARRANGEMENT FOR TIKTOK,</p>
<p>ESPECIALLY ALLEGING THE ALLEGED NATIONAL SECURITY RISK?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I CAN&rsquo;T SPEAK ON BEHALF &ndash; &raquo; PROJECT TEXAS AS YOU GUYS</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>HAVE PROPOSED IT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT XIPHIAS INVOLVED.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THE IDEA BEHIND PROJECT TEXAS IS, &ndash;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>OVERSEEN BY AMERICAN PERSONNEL AND WE WILL INVITE THIRD-PARTY</p>
<p>MONITORS TO MONITOR THIS. THAT IN ESSENCE, AT LEAST AS</p>
<p>FAR AS I KNOW, IS THE MAJORITY OF THE COST BECAUSE IT WILL</p>
<p>RELY ON NOT JUST US BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT JUST</p>
<p>FINDING IN HIRING THESE THIRD-PARTY MONITORS, TO COME</p>
<p>IN AND MONITOR THE STRUCTURE. &raquo; YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE</p>
<p>SHAREHOLDERS OWNERSHIP OF TIKTOK, 60% GLOBAL INVESTORS,</p>
<p>20% EMPLOYEES, AND 20% IS ORIGINAL FOUNDERS, ARE ALL OF</p>
<p>THOSE VOTING SHARES THE SAME? &raquo; THE FOUNDER HAS WAIVED THE</p>
<p>VOTING RIGHTS AS IS COMMON IN OUR INDUSTRY.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AS FAR AS A VOTING BLOCK OF SHARES OWNED BY BYTEDANCE, DO</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>YOU KNOW IF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, DO YOU KNOW</p>
<p>WHAT THEIR PERCENTAGE OF THE ACTUAL VOTING BLOC OF BYTEDANCE</p>
<p>IS? &raquo; THE COMMUNIST PARTY DOES NOT</p>
<p>HAVE VOTING RIGHTS IN BYTEDANCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS, A DIFFERENT QUESTION.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>DO THE FOUNDERS CONTROL THE VOTING BLOC OF BYTEDANCE&rsquo;S</p>
<p>SHARES? &raquo; I DO KNOW THAT THE FOUNDER</p>
<p>HIMSELF IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY, BUT WE DON&rsquo;T</p>
<p>KNOW THE POLITICAL AFFILIATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THAT&rsquo;S</p>
<p>NOT SOMETHING WE ASK. &raquo; DOES THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>KNOW THE POLITICAL AFFILIATION OF THEIR CHINESE CITIZENS?</p>

<p>YIELD TO THE GENTLELADY FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE, MISS KUSTER.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO SAY I AGREE WITH ALL</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>OF THE COMMENTS OF MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES, THAT WE NEED TO</p>
<p>TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHETHER TIKTOK POSES A NATIONAL</p>
<p>SECURITY RISK. FOR TODAY I WILL FOCUS MY</p>
<p>LIMITED TIME ON HOW TIKTOK CAN BETTER PROTECT ITS YOUNGEST</p>
<p>USERS. I THINK A NUMBER OF US HAVE</p>
<p>IDENTIFIED AS PARENTS TODAY AND HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS AS WE</p>
<p>RELATE TO YOU. JUST THIS WEEK I HEARD FROM A</p>
<p>PARENT IN MY DISTRICT IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE WHOSE CHILD WAS</p>
<p>SERVED HARMFUL CONTENT ON TIKTOK AND NEEDED COUNSELING AS</p>
<p>A RESULT. THIS EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE</p>
<p>TO THIS FAMILY AND IT UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR BETTER</p>
<p>CHILD PROTECTIONS ON YOUR APP. I WOULD LIKE TO DIG FURTHER</p>
<p>INTO TIKTOK&rsquo;S CURRENT SAFETY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS FOR</p>
<p>CHILDREN. I UNDERSTAND THAT TIKTOK</p>
<p>RESTRICTS CERTAIN APP CAPABILITIES FOR USERS UNDER</p>
<p>AGE 18, AND HAS ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS FOR USERS UNDER</p>
<p>AGE 16, OR 13. SUCH AS LIMITING WHO CAN</p>
<p>INTERACT WITH THEM ON THE PLATFORM.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, THESE PROTECTIONS ARE WORTHLESS IF ANY SAVVY CHILD</p>
<p>CAN EASILY BUY PAST THESE AGE RESTRICTIONS BY DELETING THEIR</p>
<p>OWN ACCOUNT, AND CREATING A NEW ONE WITH A DIFFERENT AGE.</p>
<p>AND BY EASILY, I MEAN YOU CAN LITERALLY GO IN AND OPEN</p>
<p>ANOTHER ACCOUNT USING THE SAME EMAIL ADDRESS.</p>
<p>SO I HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE BY CHILD SAFETY GROUPS INCLUDING</p>
<p>FAIR PLAY FOR KIDS AND COMMON SENSE, THAT IT IS THAT SIMPLE</p>
<p>FOR YOUNG USERS TO BYPASS THE AGE RESTRICTIONS ON TIKTOK.</p>
<p>YES OR NO, ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS ISSUE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I APOLOGIZE. I THINK THAT&rsquo;S A GREAT QUESTION</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THAT YOU RAISED. IF A USER IS BLOCKED, MY</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF THE USER TRIES TO DO IT AGAIN</p>
<p>WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, I WON&rsquo;T DISCLOSE PUBLICLY &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE DID IT IN OUR OFFICE YESTERDAY, YOU CAN GO RIGHT</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>BACK IN, USE THE EXACT SAME EMAIL ADDRESS AND OPEN A NEW</p>
<p>ACCOUNT. CAN I GET YOUR COMMITMENT THAT</p>
<p>YOU WILL AT LEAST FIX THAT BUG? &raquo; I WILL GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT</p>
<p>IT, YES. &raquo; THANK YOU.</p>
<p>WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TALK TIKTOK AND NOT OTHER PLATFORMS</p>
<p>BUT I&rsquo;M HAPPY TO LOOK AT LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS.</p>
<p>IN THE INTERIM, TIKTOK HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO MORE TO</p>
<p>PROTECT ITS YOUNG USERS, AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR COMMITMENT TO</p>
<p>TAKE A LOOK AT FIXING THAT ISSUE.</p>
<p>LET&rsquo;S SEE, SORRY, I RECOGNIZE THAT TIKTOK HAS MADE EFFORTS TO</p>
<p>PROVIDE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS INCREASED OPTIONS TO MONITOR</p>
<p>THE ACTIVITY ON THE APP INCLUDING FAMILY PAIRING AND</p>
<p>TIME LIMITS, BUT I STILL HAVE CONCERNS.</p>
<p>IN ORDER TO ACCESS FAMILY PAIRING, PARENTS THEN MUST</p>
<p>DOWNLOAD THE APP ON TO THEIR PHONE.</p>
<p>AND THIS SOUNDS LIKE A DESIGN TO LURE MORE USERS ON THE APP,</p>
<p>RATHER THAN A PRACTICAL SAFETY FEATURE.</p>
<p>FOR THEM, DOWNLOADING THE APP MIGHT NOT BE A VIABLE OPTION</p>
<p>FOR MANY PARENTS. WILL TIKTOK COMMIT TO</p>
<p>DEVELOPING OTHER METHODS FOR PARENTS TO MONITOR THEIR</p>
<p>CHILD&rsquo;S USE OF THE APP, WITHOUT HAVING TO DOWNLOAD THE TIKTOK</p>
<p>APP ON THEIR PHONE? &raquo; I CAN LOOK AT THAT</p>
<p>SPECIFICALLY AND GET BACK TO YOU BUT THE FAMILY PAIRING THAT</p>
<p>YOU MENTIONED IS A VERY GOOD TOOL THAT WE DEVELOPED, I</p>
<p>ENCOURAGE PARENTS OF TEENAGERS TO USE IT.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT&rsquo;S NOT A PERFECT BALL AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT ONE OF MY</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>CONCERNS IS THAT, THE MINIMUM TIME LIMIT TIKTOK LETS PARENTS</p>
<p>SET FOR THEIR CHILDREN&rsquo;S 40 MINUTES, WHICH FOR A YOUNG</p>
<p>CHILD IS A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME.</p>
<p>GIVING PARENTS CONTROL WOULD MEAN PROVIDING THEM THE FREEDOM</p>
<p>TO SET THE SCREEN TIME, THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEIR FAMILY.</p>
<p>I HAVE A COPY OF THE APP PAGE THAT SHOWS JUST THE FOUR</p>
<p>OPTIONS, WOULD YOU COMMIT TO ADDING AN OTHER OPTION, SO THAT</p>
<p>THE PARENT CAN EASILY SET THEIR OWN SCREEN TIME LIMIT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. &raquo; I THINK IT&rsquo;S IMPORTANT, I</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THINK PARENTS ARE LOOKING FOR CONTROL.</p>
<p>THEY ARE LOOKING TO ALLOW THEIR FAMILY TO USE THESE APPS,</p>
<p>WITHOUT TIKTOK TAKING OVER THEIR CHILD&rsquo;S MEDIA USE.</p>
<p>I HAVE HEARD REPORTS OF USERS STRUGGLING TO ACCESS THE FUTURE,</p>
<p>AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING BACK FROM YOU ON ADDING</p>
<p>AN OTHER SO THAT A PARENT CAN ADD A CUSTOM LIMIT.</p>
<p>FINALLY I ASK THAT YOU COMMIT TO REPORT BACK TO THIS</p>
<p>COMMITTEE AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ON HOW TIKTOK ADDRESSES</p>
<p>THE SAFETY ISSUES, AND THE STEPS THAT YOU ARE TAKING TO</p>
<p>DEVOLVE CHILDREN&rsquo;S ACCOUNTS TO THE MOST PROTECTIVE POSSIBLE</p>
<p>SETTINGS. AND WITH THAT I YIELD BACK.</p>

<p>PLATFORM AND WE REMOVE THAT. AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT I</p>
<p>TAKE THIS VERY SOCIALLY. THIS COMMENT.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>MR. CURTIS MY COLLEAGUE, MENTIONED THE USE OF A HEATING</p>

<p>TOOL ON YOUR PLATFORM TO MAKE VIDEOS GO VIRAL OR GET MORE</p>
<p>VIEWS. A COOLING TOOL WHERE THEY CAN</p>
<p>MANUALLY LIMIT THE IMPLICATION OF CONTENT THAT TIKTOK SHOULD</p>
<p>HIDE, CONTENT THAT PROMOTES EATING DISORDERS, DRUG USE OR</p>
<p>SUICIDE AMONG CHILDREN. &raquo; THE ONLY PROMOTION TOOL THAT</p>
<p>WE HAVE IS APPROVED BY THE LOCAL TEAMS, IN THE U.S. BY THE</p>
<p>U.S. TEAM AND IT&rsquo;S FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, LIKE</p>

<p>WOULD THAT BE A YES OR NO? &raquo; I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I</p>

<p>AM ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION WITH SPECIFIC.</p>

<p>IF THIS TOOL EXIST, WHY IS IT NOT BEING USED TO COOL THE</p>

<p>SPREAD OF DANGEROUS CONTENT? WHY IS IT STILL HAPPENING?</p>

<p>DANGEROUS CONTENT THAT VIOLATES, WE REMOVE THEM WHEN</p>

<p>WE SEE THEM, FROM THE PLATFORM. &raquo; THE FACT OF THE MATTER HERE</p>
<p>IS THAT DESPITE WHATEVER ACTION YOU TAKE, THAT TIKTOK IS TAKING</p>
<p>TO PREVENT TEENS, WOULDN&rsquo;T YOU &ndash;</p>
<p>THERE IS SOMETHING INHERENTLY WRONG WITH THE ALGORITHM OF</p>
<p>YOUR PLATFORM THAT IT EMPLOYEES? &raquo; I DO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE</p>
<p>WITH THAT. THE ALGORITHM DRIVES A GREAT</p>
<p>USER EXPERIENCE FOR MANY USERS. I TALKED ABOUT STEM CONTENT,</p>
<p>THAT WAS 160 BILLION VIEWS. ONE MORE, BOOK TALK, A TREND</p>
<p>THAT HAPPENED ON OUR PLATFORM IS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO READ,</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S FANTASTIC. I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE TELLING ME</p>
<p>THAT THEY ARE READING MORE BECAUSE OF BOOKTOK.</p>
<p>IF THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD AND JOY AND POSITIVE THAT CAN BE</p>
<p>DERIVED FROM THE TIKTOK EXPERIENCES.</p>
<p>YES, THERE ARE BAD ACTORS WHO COME IN AND POST VIOLATED</p>
<p>CONTENT AND IT&rsquo;S OUR JOB TO REMOVE THEM BUT THE OVERALL</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE IS A VERY POSITIVE ONE FOR OUR COMMUNITY.</p>

<p>41 DAYS THAT THAT VIDEO STOOD UP, ADDRESSING THE CHAIRWOMAN.</p>

<p>AFTER THIS I WILL GO AND LOOK INTO THE SPECIFICS OF</p>

<p>THAT. &raquo; THANK YOU.</p>
<p>MADAM CHAIR, I YIELD BACK. &raquo; GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.</p>
<p>CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE LADY FROM TEXAS, MISS FLETCHER, FOR FIVE</p>
<p>MINUTES. &raquo; THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR, AND</p>
<p>THANK YOU MR. CHEW FOR APPEARING TODAY.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S BEEN A LONG DAY BUT WE ARE HERE TO LEARN ABOUT A COMPLEX</p>
<p>SET OF ISSUES THAT RELATE TO TIKTOK AND HOW TO ADDRESS THEM.</p>
<p>I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM COLLEAGUES ON BOTH</p>
<p>SIDES OF THE AISLE TODAY, A REAL EFFORT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE</p>
<p>CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY, AND FOR THE</p>
<p>SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS.</p>
<p>ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS.</p>
<p>AND WE HAVE ALREADY COVERED TODAY, A LOT OF THE INFORMATION</p>
<p>ABOUT THE EXTENSIVE USE OF THE APP.</p>
<p>THE NUMBER OF USERS WHO ARE CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS.</p>
<p>BUT I THINK IT BEARS REPEATING, THAT TIKTOK IS THE PREFERRED</p>
<p>PLATFORM OF YOUNG AMERICANS AND THEY USE IT FOR ALL KINDS OF</p>
<p>CREATIVE AND IMPORTANT THINGS, AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT.</p>
<p>BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME DANGEROUS THINGS THAT WE KNOW</p>
<p>IT HAS, AND CONTINUES TO BE USED FOR.</p>
<p>AND THAT ALSO, THAT THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED IS POSING</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL DANGERS, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR.</p>
<p>MOST PEOPLE USING TIKTOK TO NOT REALIZE THAT TIKTOK IS</p>
<p>COLLECTING DATA ABOUT THEIR KEYSTROKES OR ABOUT THEIR</p>
<p>BROWSING HISTORY ON OTHER SITES AND SO MUCH MORE, AND I AGREE</p>
<p>WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA</p>
<p>PRIVACY LAWS, AND WE HAVE HEARD SOME VERY GOOD IDEAS TODAY.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES TODAY THAT THESE ARE</p>
<p>INDUSTRY WIDE ISSUES. AND I AGREE WITH YOU, THAT OUR</p>
<p>INDUSTRY WIDE CHALLENGES HERE. BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME</p>
<p>SPECIFIC THINGS RELATING TO TIKTOK THAT I WANT TO FOCUS MY</p>
<p>QUESTIONS ON, AND REALLY I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE IS A</p>
<p>DIFFERENCE ON HOW WE CAN CRAFT LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES THE</p>
<p>VERY REAL CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT TODAY.</p>
<p>AS YOU KNOW, STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE JOINED AN ONGOING</p>
<p>INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF CONSUMER</p>
<p>PROTECTION LAWS, BY TIKTOK. AS THEY PERTAIN TO TIKTOK&rsquo;S</p>
<p>EFFECT, ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF AMERICAN CHILDREN AND</p>
<p>TEENAGERS. AS PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION,</p>
<p>STATES HAVE REQUESTED TO REVIEW INTERNAL TIKTOK COMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p>THAT TAKES PLACE ON LARK, THE PRIMARY INSTANT MESSAGING</p>
<p>SYSTEM, IS THAT RIGHT? &raquo; YES.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AND AS EVERY TIKTOK EMPLOYEE HAVE A LARK ACCOUNT?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT&rsquo;S VERY SIMILAR TO COMPANIES THAT USE SLACK OR ANY</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>OTHER INSTANT MESSAGING TOOL. &raquo; BUT IT&rsquo;S A PROPRIETARY</p>
<p>INSTANT MESSAGING TOOL, IT&rsquo;S NOT SLACK.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT WAS SOMETHING THAT IS DEVELOPED BY US.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BY TIKTOK? &raquo; NO, BY BYTEDANCE.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS STEMMING FROM, THAT IS IT TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THAT LARK VIDEO CONFERENCING HAS A TRANSLATION FUTURE IN</p>
<p>WHICH CHINESE IS TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH TEXT AND VICE VERSA?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THAT IS CORRECT, IT HELPS WITH GLOBAL COOPERATION.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AND THOSE TRANSLATORS CONVERSATIONS ARE SAVED INTO</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>THE LARK SYSTEM? &raquo; I WILL NEED TO GET BACK TO</p>
<p>YOU ON THE SPECIFICS. I WILL GET BACK TO.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO KNOW, I NEGLECTED TO ASK BUT DOES</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>EVERY TIKTOK EMPLOYEE HAVE A LARK ACCOUNT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YES. &raquo; INCLUDING YOU, DO YOU HAVE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ONE? &raquo; YES, I BELIEVE SO.</p>
<p>YES. &raquo; THERE IS SOME KIND OF</p>
<p>PROFILE FOR YOUR INSTANT MESSAGING SYSTEM SO EVERY</p>
<p>EMPLOYEE IDENTIFIES THEIR MANAGER AND THEIR DEPARTMENT,</p>
<p>WHO THEY WORK FOR, WHAT THEY DO, IS THAT ALL INCLUDED IN THEIR</p>
<p>LARK PROFILE? &raquo; IT&rsquo;S VERY COMMON FOR</p>
<p>COMPANIES TO HAVE ENTERPRISE MESSAGING TOOLS.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SURE. &raquo; TOOLS.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT DOES, I&rsquo;M ASKING ABOUT LARK, WHETHER IT INCLUDES</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>INFORMATION LIKE IDENTIFYING WHO FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR MANAGER</p>
<p>IS? DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT IS</p>
<p>SOMETHING THAT IS IDENTIFIED IN LARK?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YES, AGAIN, SOME OF THE HR FUTURES ARE BUILT INTO A LOT OF</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ENTERPRISE TOOLS THAT WE USE. &raquo; SO FOR YOUR OWN PROFILE,</p>
<p>DOES IT IDENTIFY WHO YOUR MANAGER IS?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YES, IT DOES. &raquo; WHO DOES IT IDENTIFY AS YOUR</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>MANAGER? &raquo; I REPORT TO THE CEO OF</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE. &raquo; SO THAT IS &ndash;</p>
<p>AS YOUR MANAGER? THE FORMER CEO?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HE HAS STEPPED DOWN FROM THE BOARD.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>AS THE CEO. &raquo; SO MR. RUBO IS IDENTIFIED</p>
<p>NOW? &raquo; YES.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IT&rsquo;S NOT JUST USED BY TIKTOK EMPLOYEES, BY BYTEDANCE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>EMPLOYEES AS WELL? &raquo; I THINK CLARK IS SELLING IT,</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S A GOOD TOOL FOR INSTANT MESSAGING.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>LARK IS AVAILABLE TO THIRD PARTIES OUTSIDE THE BYTEDANCE</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>SYSTEM AS WELL? &raquo; YES.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AND DO YOU PERSONALLY EVER USE LARK TO COMMUNICATE</p>

<p>WITH BYTEDANCE? &raquo; WITH EMPLOYEES AT BYTEDANCE?</p>
<p>YES, I DO. &raquo; I&rsquo;M RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M SORRY TO SAY BECAUSE THIS IS VERY INTERESTING, I DO THINK</p>
<p>IT UNDERSCORES SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED</p>
<p>IN THIS HEARING, I THINK IT&rsquo;S CLEAR WE HAVE WORK WE NEED TO</p>
<p>CONTINUE TO DO HERE IN THE CONGRESS, TO ADDRESS DATA</p>
<p>PROTECTION AND PRIVACY AND WITH THAT, MADAM CHAIRWOMAN I THANK</p>

<p>OUR WITNESS TODAY MR. SHOU ZI CHEW, EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF</p>
<p>TIKTOK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE</p>
<p>MINUTES. &raquo; THANK YOU.</p>
<p>MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, CHAIR ROGERS, RANKING MEMBER PALLONE,</p>
<p>I AM SHOU ZI CHEW FROM SINGAPORE.</p>
<p>THAT IS WHERE I WAS BORN, THAT&rsquo;S WHEN MY PARENTS WERE</p>
<p>BORN. AFTER SERVING IN SINGAPORE&rsquo;S</p>
<p>MILITARY I MOVED TO THE UK TO ATTEND COLLEGE AND HERE IN THE</p>
<p>U.S. TO ATTEND BUSINESS SCHOOL. I MET MY WIFE.</p>
<p>HERE SHE WAS BORN A FEW MILES AWAY FROM HERE IN VIRGINIA.</p>
<p>TWO YEARS AGO, I BECAME THE CEO OF TIKTOK, AND TODAY WE ARE</p>
<p>MORE THAN A BILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS AROUND THE WORLD</p>
<p>INCLUDING 150 MILLION IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>OUR APP IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE CREATIVE AND CURIOUS,</p>
<p>AND WE ARE CLOSE TO 5 MILLION AMERICAN BUSINESSES, MOSTLY</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESSES GO TO FIND NEW CUSTOMERS AND FUEL THEIR</p>
<p>GROWTH. AS TIKTOK HAS GROWN, WE HAVE</p>
<p>TRIED TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE</p>
<p>US. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE</p>
<p>SAFETY OF TEENAGERS. WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY OF</p>
<p>PEOPLE ON TIKTOK ARE OVER 18, ONE OF THE FASTEST-GROWING</p>
<p>DEMOGRAPHICS ARE PEOPLE OVER 35, SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ADOPTING</p>
<p>MEASURES &ndash; FOR THE SOCIAL MEDIA INDUSTRY.</p>
<p>WE FORBID DIRECT MESSAGING FOR PEOPLE UNDER 16 AND WE HAVE A</p>
<p>60 MINUTE WATCH TIME BY DEFAULT FOR THOSE UNDER 18.</p>
<p>WE HAVE A SUITE OF FAMILY PAIRING TOOLS SO THAT PARENTS</p>
<p>CAN PARTICIPATE IN THEIR TEENS EXPERIENCE AND MAKE THE CHOICES</p>
<p>THAT ARE RIGHT FOR THEIR FAMILY.</p>
<p>WE WANT TIKTOK TO BE A PLACE WHERE TEENAGERS CAN COME TO</p>
<p>LEARN, WHICH IS WHY WE RECENTLY LAUNCHED A FEED THAT</p>
<p>EXCLUSIVELY FEATURES EDUCATION ON STEM.</p>
<p>STEM VIDEOS ALREADY HAVE OVER 116 BILLION VIEWS ON TIKTOK.</p>
<p>AND TIKTOK IS INSPIRING A NEW GENERATION TO DISCOVER A</p>
<p>PASSION FOR MATH AND SCIENCE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT</p>
<p>NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE RAISED.</p>
<p>THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. LET ME START BY ADDRESSING A</p>
<p>FEW MISCONCEPTIONS OF BYTEDANCE OF WHICH WE ARE A SUBSIDIARY.</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE OR IS NOT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE CHINESE</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT, IT&rsquo;S A COMPANY. 60% OF THE COMPANY IS OWNED BY</p>
<p>GLOBAL INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, 20% BY THE FOUNDER AND 20% BY</p>
<p>EMPLOYEES AROUND THE WORLD. BYTEDANCE HAS FIVE BOARD</p>
<p>MEMBERS, THREE OF THEM ARE AMERICAN.</p>
<p>TIKTOK ITSELF IS NOT AVAILABLE IN MAINLAND CHINA, BIG ORDERED</p>
<p>IN LOS ANGELES AND SINGAPORE, AND WE HAVE 7000 EMPLOYEES IN</p>
<p>THE U.S. TODAY. WE HAVE HEARD IMPORTANT</p>
<p>CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR UNWANTED FOREIGN ACCESS TO</p>
<p>U.S. DATA, AND POTENTIAL MANIPULATION OF THE TIKTOK U.S.</p>
<p>ECOSYSTEM. OUR APPROACH HAS NEVER BEEN TO</p>
<p>DISMISS OR TRIVIALIZE ANY OF THESE CONCERNS.</p>
<p>WE HAVE ADDRESSED THEM WITH REAL ACTION.</p>
<p>THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.</p>
<p>BUILDING BUT AMOUNTS TO A FIREWALL, PROTECTING U.S. USER</p>
<p>DATA FROM UNAUTHORIZED FOREIGN ACCESS.</p>
<p>THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. AMERICAN DATA STORED ON</p>
<p>AMERICAN SOIL BY AN AMERICAN COMPANY, OVERSEEN BY AMERICAN</p>
<p>PERSONNEL. WE CALL THIS INITIATIVE PROJECT</p>
<p>TEXAS. WE ARE ORACLE IS HEADQUARTERED.</p>
<p>TODAY, U.S. TIKTOK DATA IS STORED BY DEEP VAULT IN ORACLE</p>
<p>SERVICE. ONLY VOTED PERSONNEL OPERATING</p>
<p>IN A NEW COMPANY CALLED TIKTOK U.S. DATA SECURITY CAN CONSULT</p>
<p>ACCESS TO THIS DATA. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE PLANS FOR</p>
<p>THIS COMPANY TO REPORT TO AN INDEPENDENT AMERICAN BOARD,</p>
<p>WITH STRONG SECURITY CREDENTIALS.</p>
<p>THERE IS STILL SOME WORK TO DO AND WE HAVE A LEGACY U.S. DATA</p>
<p>SITTING IN OUR SERVICE IN VIRGINIA AND SINGAPORE.</p>
<p>WE HAD A LEADING THOSE AND WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE</p>
<p>COMPLETE THIS YEAR. WHEN THAT IS DONE ALL PROTECTED</p>
<p>U.S. DATA WILL BE UNDER PROTECTION OF U.S. LAW AND</p>
<p>UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE U.S. LAND SECURITY TEAM WHICH</p>
<p>ELIMINATES THE CONCERN THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE SHARED WITH ME,</p>
<p>THAT TIKTOK USER DATA CAN BE SUBJECT TO CHINESE LAW.</p>
<p>THIS GOES FURTHER BY THE WAY, THEN WHAT ANY OTHER COMPANY IN</p>
<p>OUR INDUSTRY HAVE DONE. WE ALSO PROVIDE UNPRECEDENTED</p>
<p>TRANSPARENCY AND SECURITY FOR THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE TIKTOK</p>
<p>APP AND RECOMMENDATION ENGINE. THIRD PARTY VALIDATORS LIKE</p>
<p>ORACLE AND OTHERS WILL REVIEW AND VALIDATE OUR SOURCE CODE</p>
<p>AND ALGORITHMS. THIS WILL HELP ENSURE THE</p>
<p>INTEGRITY OF THE CODE, THAT COVERS WHAT AMERICANS SEE ON</p>
<p>OUR APP. WE WILL FURTHER PROVIDE ACCESS</p>
<p>TO RESEARCHERS WHICH HELPS THEM STUDY AND MONITOR OUR CONTENT</p>
<p>ECOSYSTEM. WE BELIEVE WE ARE THE ONLY</p>
<p>COMPANY THAT OFFERS THIS LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY.</p>
<p>TRUST IS ABOUT ACTIONS WE TAKE. WE HAVE TO EARN THEIR TRUST,</p>
<p>WITH DECISIONS WE MAKE FOR OUR COMPANY AND OUR PRODUCTS.</p>
<p>THE POTENTIAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY, CONTENT MANIPULATION</p>
<p>CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT TIKTOK ARE NOT UNIQUE TO US.</p>
<p>THE SAME ISSUES APPLY TO OTHER COMPANIES.</p>
<p>WE BELIEVE WHAT IS NEEDED ARE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT RULES,</p>
<p>THAT APPLY BROADLY TO ALL TECH COMPANIES.</p>
<p>OWNERSHIP IS NOT AT THE CORE OF ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS.</p>
<p>AS I CONCLUDE, THERE ARE MORE THAN 150 MILLION AMERICANS WHO</p>
<p>LOVE OUR PLATFORM AND WE KNOW WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO</p>
<p>PROTECT THEM. WHICH IS WHY I AM MAKING THE</p>
<p>FOLLOWING COMMITMENTS TO YOU AND ALL OF OUR USERS.</p>
<p>NUMBER ONE, WE WILL KEEP SAFETY, PARTICULARLY FOR TEENAGERS, AS</p>
<p>A TOP PRIORITY FOR US. NUMBER TWO WE WILL FIREWALL</p>
<p>PROTECT U.S. DATA FROM UNWANTED FOR AN ACCESS.</p>
<p>NUMBER THREE, TIKTOK WILL REMAIN A PLACE FOR FREE</p>
<p>EXPRESSION AND WILL NOT BE MANIPULATED BY ANY GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>AND FOURTH, WE WILL BE TRANSPARENT AND WE WILL GIVE</p>
<p>ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY INDEPENDENT MONITORS, THAT</p>
<p>REMAIN ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUR COMMITMENTS.</p>
<p>I WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR ANY FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAVE AND I</p>
<p>LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>

<p>PRIVATE INFORMATION ABOUT AMERICANS THAT THEY DON&rsquo;T NEED</p>
<p>FOR THEIR BUSINESS PURPOSES AND THEN THEY SELL IT.</p>
<p>AND I HAD MENTIONED THIS LEGISLATION, THAT THE CHAIR AND</p>
<p>I HAVE, THAT WOULD MINIMIZE DATA COLLECTION AND MAKE IT</p>
<p>MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR TIKTOK AND OTHER COMPANIES TO DO THAT.</p>
<p>IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMITMENTS TONIGHT, MAKE</p>
<p>COMMITMENTS WITH REGARD THIS LEGISLATION, YOU ARE GOING TO</p>
<p>TELL ME. THE BILL ISN&rsquo;T PASSED.</p>
<p>SO THEREFORE I DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO DO IT.</p>
<p>BUT YOU SAY YOU ARE BENIGN AND YOU WANT TO DO GOOD THINGS FOR</p>
<p>THE PUBLIC, SO LET ME ASK YOU. WHAT ABOUT A COMMITMENT THAT</p>
<p>SAYS YOU WON&rsquo;T SOLVE THE DATA THAT YOU COLLECT?</p>
<p>WOULD YOU COMMIT TO THAT, NOT SELLING THE DATA YOU COLLECT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, I BELIEVE WE DON&rsquo;T SELL DATA TO ANY DATA</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>BROKERS. &raquo; YOU DON&rsquo;T SELL TO ANYONE.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WE DON&rsquo;T SELL DATA BROKERS. &raquo; DO YOU SELL IT TO ANYONE?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>IN OTHER WORDS, UNDER OUR BILL YOU CAN ONLY USE THE DATA FOR</p>
<p>YOUR OWN PURPOSES, NOT TO SELL IT TO ANYONE, WHEN YOU COMMIT</p>
<p>TO NOT SELLING YOUR DATA TO ANYONE?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, I AM ACTUALLY IN SUPPORT &raquo; I DIDN&rsquo;T ASK YOU</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>ABOUT RULES, I ASKED YOU WHETHER THE COMPANY WOULD</p>
<p>COMMIT TO NOT SELLING ITS DATA TO ANYONE AND USING IT FOR ITS</p>
<p>OWN PURPOSES INTERNALLY. &raquo; I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THE</p>
<p>DETAILS OF THAT. &raquo; I WILL GET, GET BACK TO ME.</p>
<p>ANOTHER IN OUR BILL, PROHIBIT TARGETING MARKETING TO PEOPLE</p>
<p>UNDER THE AGE OF 17. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO AGREE</p>
<p>TO PROHIBIT TARGETING MARKETING TO PEOPLE, AMERICANS UNDER THE</p>
<p>AGE OF 17? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE</p>
<p>ACTUALLY STRICTER RULES FOR ADVERTISERS IN TERMS OF WHAT</p>
<p>THEY CAN SHOW &ndash; &raquo; I AM ONE OF SIX TEXANS ON</p>
<p>THIS COMMITTEE. I AM OVER HERE.</p>
<p>WHEN YOU INVOKE THE NAME OF TEXAS, YOU GET MY ATTENTION.</p>
<p>WHEN YOU ARE THE CFO OF BYTEDANCE TO THE CHINESE</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE YOU ON HOW THE CONTENT MUSS TO BE</p>
<p>MONITORED ON GOING IN OR TIKTOK, YES OR NO?</p>

<p>SORRY CONGRESSMAN, WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING THAT QUESTION?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>WHEN YOU ARE THE CFL OF BYTEDANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>THEY DO NOT DO THAT. WE DO NOT PROMOTE OR REMOVE ANY</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YOU DON&rsquo;T. BUT DID THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT,</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THAT?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE ONLY ONE PROCESS OF REMOVING CONTENT</p>

<p>ON OUR PLATFORM. THE PROCESS IS DONE BY OUR</p>

<p>THE U.S.. AND WE WOULD ONLY REMOVE</p>
<p>CONTENT IF IT VIOLATES OUR GUIDELINES.</p>
<p>THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE AUDIT.</p>
<p>OR IF THERE IS A VALID LEGAL ORDER.</p>

<p>INDICATED THAT TIKTOK HAS REPEATEDLY CENSORED OR THE</p>

<p>THERE COULD BE SOME REPORTS THAT SAY THAT, BUT THAT ACTION</p>

<p>ITSELF &ndash; &raquo; YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY IS</p>
<p>THAT YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH STUFF AND MAKE IT AS CLEAN AS</p>
<p>POSSIBLE, QUOTE UNQUOTE, ARE YOU AWARE OF THOSE REPORTS?</p>

<p>I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS CONTENT ON TIKTOK</p>

<p>THIS COMMITTEE IS LOOKING AT REFORMING SECTION 2:30 OF THE</p>
<p>COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT, ALREADY MENTIONED HERE TODAY,</p>
<p>DO YOU THINK THAT CENSORING HISTORY AND HISTORICAL FACTS,</p>
<p>CURRENT EVENTS, SHOULD BE PROTECTED BY SECTION 230, GOOD</p>
<p>FAITH REQUIREMENT? &raquo; THAT IS A MORE COMPLEX TOPIC,</p>
<p>CONGRESSMAN, I WOULD MEAN JUST SPEAK TO MY TEAM AND GET BACK</p>

<p>IT IS THE BROADER TEAM. &raquo; IT&rsquo;S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE</p>

<p>FOLKS BEHIND YOU. HERE ARE MY CONCERNS WITH</p>
<p>TIKTOK. FEWER CLAIMS ARE HARD TO</p>
<p>BELIEVE, NO SECRET TO US THAT TIKTOK IS STILL UNDER THE THUMB</p>
<p>OF CCP INFLUENCE. TIKTOK IS INDOCTRINATING OUR</p>
<p>CHILDREN WITH DIVISIVE, WALK AND PRO CCP PROPAGANDA.</p>
<p>ALL WHILE THREATENING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY OF CHINESE</p>
<p>SPYWARE. IN FACT, LET ME LOOK AT MY</p>
<p>NOTES HERE, YOU HAD AN EXCHANGE WITH AND AS YOU, AND YOU SAID</p>
<p>THAT QUOTE, EXTREME FITNESS VIDEOS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED TOO</p>
<p>MUCH. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT EXCHANGE?</p>
<p>HERE TODAY? &raquo; WHAT EXTREMIST VIDEOS?</p>

<p>CONTENT IS NOT ALLOWED ON OUR PLATFORM.</p>

<p>WAS THAT ALSO TRUE ABOUT THE GARDEN VIDEO THAT YOU SAW TODAY?</p>

<p>I WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS OF THE WHOLE VIDEO,</p>

<p>THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. &raquo; YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT</p>

<p>EXTREME VIDEO. WHY DID IT TAKE 40 PLUS DAYS TO</p>
<p>GET IT DOWN? DOES IT TAKE AN ACT OF CONGRESS,</p>
<p>SHOULD WE PLAN TO HAVE A COMMITTEE HEARING EVERY DAY,</p>
<p>EVERY TIME THERE IS SOMETHING BROUGHT UP SO THAT WE CAN LIMIT</p>
<p>THE CONTENT ON TIKTOK? SHOULD CONGRESS PLANNED TO DO</p>
<p>THAT? &raquo; WE WORK VERY HARD TO REMOVE</p>
<p>VIOLATED CONTENT ON OUR PLATFORM.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>LET ME MOVE ON. CONGRESSMAN HUDSON ASKED YOU</p>

<p>AMERICAN PUBLIC INFORMATION, WE PREFER TO KEEP IT PRIVATE AS</p>

<p>MADAM CHAIR, MY TIME IS OF, AND IF THIS COMMITTEE GETS ITS WAY,</p>
<p>TIKTOK&rsquo;S TIME IS UP. &raquo; GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S TIME</p>
<p>IS EXPIRED, CHAIR RECOGNIZES MR. LOUISE FROM CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>COMMENTS ON THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.</p>
<p>AS A DOCTOR AND THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE SELECT</p>
<p>SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC I AM &ndash;</p>
<p>WITH MEDICALLY INACCURATE INFORMATION INCLUDING DANGEROUS</p>
<p>MISINFORMATION AND THE INTENTIONAL DISINFORMATION</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COVID-19 AND VACCINES.</p>
<p>TIKTOK COMMUNITY GUIDELINES STATE THAT THE COMPANY WILL</p>
<p>REMOVE CONTENT OR ACCOUNTS THAT INVOLVE QUOTE, MISLEADING</p>
<p>INFORMATION THAT CAUSES SIGNIFICANT HARM.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, SINCE THE EARLY STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC, TIKTOK HAS</p>
<p>BEEN USED AS A PLATFORM FOR PEOPLE PUSHING MISINFORMATION,</p>
<p>DISINFORMATION INCLUDING BY THOSE CASTING DOUBT ON THE</p>
<p>SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF LIFESAVING VACCINES.</p>
<p>DESPITE TIKTOK&rsquo;S PLEDGE TO ADDRESS HARMFUL MISINFORMATION,</p>
<p>THESE VIDEOS ARE BEING VIEWED MILLIONS OF TIMES.</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE, THE INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC DIALOGUE, FOUND THAT</p>
<p>A SAMPLE OF 124 TIKTOK VIDEOS CONTAINING VACCINE</p>
<p>MISINFORMATION WE REVIEWED 20 MILLION TIMES.</p>
<p>MEDIA MATTERS FOUND THAT EXAMPLE OF 18 VIDEOS WITH</p>
<p>COVID-19 MISINFORMATION WERE VIEWED OVER 57 MILLION TIMES.</p>
<p>HERE IS ANOTHER SHOCK STUDY. THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL</p>
<p>INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION FOUND THAT WHEN SEARCHING HASHTAG</p>
<p>CORONAVIRUS ON TIKTOK, ALMOST 30% OF THE VIDEOS THAT CAME UP</p>
<p>CONTAIN MISINFORMATION. VIDEOS IN THAT SAMPLE</p>
<p>CONTAINING A HIGH LEVEL OF MISINFORMATION REVIEWED A</p>
<p>MEDIAN OF 9.4 MILLION TIMES. WHY ARE THESE DANGEROUS VIDEOS</p>
<p>FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS OF YOUR COMPANY&rsquo;S EFFORTS TO</p>
<p>ENFORCE ITS OWN COMMUNITY GUIDELINES AND REMOVE HARMFUL</p>
<p>MISINFORMATION? &raquo; BEFORE I ANSWER THAT, IN MY</p>
<p>RESPONSE &ndash; &raquo; YOU ARE ON MY TIME, ANSWER</p>
<p>MY QUESTION. &raquo; I UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p>I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY. &raquo; I HAVE FIVE MINUTES.</p>
<p>MY TIME. YOU ARE ON MY TIME NOW, ANSWER</p>
<p>MY QUESTION. &raquo; ANY DANGEROUS MISINFORMATION</p>
<p>IS, WE PARTNER WITH THIRD-PARTY EXPERTS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY</p>
<p>AND HELP WITH SUBJECT OWNING EXPERTISE.</p>
<p>AND WITH THE EXPERTISE THAT WE RECOGNIZE WE RELY ON THOSE TO</p>
<p>DEVELOP POLICIES, RECOGNIZE AND REMOVE CONTENT.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>YOUR EFFORTS HAVE FAILED. AND THEY ARE DANGEROUS.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>IT&rsquo;S PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS THAT YOU ARE PUTTING MILLIONS OF</p>
<p>PEOPLES LIVES AT RISK, FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB.</p>
<p>AND I AM CONCERNED THAT TIKTOK&rsquo;S FEATURES MAKE USERS</p>
<p>UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO THE SPREAD OF THIS MISINFORMATION,</p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE TIKTOK MAKES IT EXTREMELY EASY TO REUSE AUDIO</p>
<p>AND VIDEOS TO CREATE CONTENT. WHICH ALLOWS MISINFORMATION TO</p>
<p>QUICKLY SPREAD THROUGH THE PLATFORM.</p>
<p>AND TIKTOK&rsquo;S ALGORITHM TO RECOMMEND VIDEOS, MEANS THAT I</p>
<p>USE REVIEWING ONE VIDEO CONTAINING MISINFORMATION CAN</p>
<p>EASILY RESULT IN THEIR QUOTE UNQUOTE FOR YOU PAGE BECOMING</p>
<p>FILLED WITH VIDEOS CONTAINING SIMILAR MISINFORMATION.</p>
<p>THIS IS A DANGEROUS FEEDBACK LOOP.</p>
<p>IS TIKTOK TAKING ANY ACTION TO MODIFY THESE FEATURES SO THAT</p>
<p>THEY NO LONGER FACILITATE THE SPREAD OF THE MISINFORMATION,</p>
<p>OR THIS FEEDBACK LOOP? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, AGAIN, ANY</p>
<p>DANGEROUS MISS OR DISINFORMATION, WE WORK WITH</p>
<p>THIRD-PARTY AND IT IS PROACTIVELY REMOVED FROM OUR</p>
<p>PLATFORM. IT DOESN&rsquo;T NEED TO GET INTO</p>
<p>THOSE LOOPS AT ALL. &raquo; I CAN GO BACK AND REVIEW THE</p>
<p>DATA, THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL AND INFORMATICS, 30% OF</p>
<p>VIDEOS AFTER SEARCHING FOR HASHTAG CORONAVIRUS HAD</p>
<p>MISINFORMATION. ALMOST ONE OUT OF THREE, YOUR</p>
<p>THIRD PARTY, IN YOUR COMPANY, MISSING ALMOST ONE OUT OF THREE</p>
<p>VIDEOS. YOU ARE TELLING ME WHAT YOU ARE</p>
<p>DOING, I&rsquo;M TELLING YOU THAT THE DATA SHOWS THAT YOU ARE GROSSLY</p>
<p>FAILING AT THAT EFFORT. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR</p>
<p>YOU IS, TIKTOK IS ALSO IN SPANISH.</p>
<p>AND SPANISH SPEAKING POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN</p>
<p>SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO MISINFORMATION, WHEN IT COMES</p>
<p>TO MANY ASPECTS, ESPECIALLY MEDICAL MISINFORMATION AND AS</p>
<p>CHAIR OF THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS WE REACHED OUT</p>
<p>TO YOU LAST CONGRESS ON THIS ISSUE.</p>
<p>SO WHAT IS YOUR INTENT, HOW DOES YOUR TEAM LOOK TO ADDRESS</p>
<p>SPANISH VERSUS ENGLISH? HOW MANY STUFF DO YOU HAVE,</p>
<p>FOCUSING ON SPANISH PRICES HOW MANY STAFF DO YOU HAVE FOCUSING</p>
<p>ON ENGLISH MISINFORMATION? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, LIKE I</p>
<p>EXPLAINED JUST NOW, THE SPANISH SPEAKING POPULATION IS VERY</p>
<p>IMPORTANT TO OUR PLATFORM. WE DO HAVE SPANISH SPEAKING</p>
<p>MODERATORS. &raquo; SO HOW MANY SPANISH SPEAKING</p>
<p>STAFF VERSUS ENGLISH MAKING STAFF ON MISINFORMATION DO YOU</p>
<p>HAVE? &raquo; I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THE</p>
<p>SPECIFICS BUT MISINFORMATION, DANGEROUS MISINFORMATION IS</p>
<p>MODERATED IN EVERY LANGUAGE. &raquo; NOT TO THE DEGREE THAT IT</p>
<p>NEEDS TO BE. WHEN THERE IS MISINFORMATION,</p>
<p>PEOPLE BASE THEIR DECISIONS THAT OFTENTIMES PUT THEM AT</p>
<p>RISK. AND EXPOSURES, THEIR FAMILIES</p>
<p>AT RISK. WITH THE CORONAVIRUS, PRIOR TO</p>
<p>THE VACCINES, THE RISK WAS THEIR LIFE.</p>
<p>THANK YOU, I YIELD BACK. &raquo; MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO</p>
<p>CLARIFY SOMETHING, IN THE QUESTION TO REPRESENTATIVE &ndash;</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE BUYING ON BEHALF OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION SHOULD BE A NO, BECAUSE IT CAME</p>
<p>VERY RAPIDLY. &raquo; GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S TIME IS EXPIRED.</p>
<p>THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM IDAHO, MR.</p>
<p>FULCHER. &raquo; THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR.</p>
<p>A LOT OF QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE</p>
<p>NOT BEEN ANSWERED. THE PRIMARY THING I WANT TO DO</p>
<p>IS SHARE SOME THOUGHTS OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN, AND LEARNED TODAY.</p>
<p>BEEN EXPOSED TO. FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO</p>
<p>COMPLIMENT YOU ON HAVING A PRODUCT THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.</p>
<p>IT IS VERY INFLUENTIAL, IT IS ADDICTIVE AND THAT IS WHAT YOU</p>
<p>WANT USERS TO BE EXPOSED TO, SOMETHING ADDICTIVE, AND IT IS</p>
<p>AT DATA GATHERING MASTERPIECE. SO CLEARLY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL</p>
<p>TO SELL PRODUCTS. CONNECTING LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE</p>
<p>WITH THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY.</p>
<p>IN A VIRAL FASHION. AND PERHAPS SPREAD INFORMATION</p>
<p>QUICKER, BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAS BEEN IN</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT OUT THERE. I&rsquo;M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU, I</p>
<p>AM NOT A SUBSCRIBER, OR A WILLING SUBSCRIBER.</p>
<p>BUT PROBABLY IN THAT DATABASE SOMEWHERE IS MY PREFERENCES</p>
<p>WITH COLORS OR FOODS, WHO I HAVE SPOKEN TO OR WHAT I HAVE</p>
<p>SAID OR MY FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS. I DON&rsquo;T KNOW.</p>
<p>THAT IS AVAILABLE TO BE SOLD OR GIVEN TO WHOMEVER OR WHATEVER,</p>
<p>AND THE WHATEVER IS WHAT BOTHERS ME.</p>
<p>I USE MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE. AND IF FOR WHATEVER REASON I</p>
<p>BECAME A TARGET IN THIS, I BECAME SOMEONE YOU DIDN&rsquo;T LIKE,</p>
<p>I KNOW THAT WOULD BE HARD TO BELIEVE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO</p>
<p>LIKE ME, LET&rsquo;S SAY YOU DIDN&rsquo;T, OR YOUR COMPANY DIDN&rsquo;T OR FOR</p>
<p>WHATEVER REASON I BECAME AN APP TARGET.</p>
<p>THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHM COULD BE SHARED OR</p>
<p>SPREAD SELECTIVELY. TO A TARGETED AUDIENCE WITH</p>
<p>NEGATIVE INFORMATION, THAT MAYBE HAS BEEN PAIRED UP WITH</p>
<p>THAT KNOWLEDGE AND THAT APP, TO MAKE ME LOOK REALLY BAD.</p>
<p>OR, TO THE CONVERSE, SAME THING COULD BE DONE TO MAKE ME LOOK</p>
<p>REALLY, REALLY GOOD. HERE&rsquo;S THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S SOMEONE ELSE OR SOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p>
<p>ALGORITHM THAT HAS INORDINATE POWER TO SUBJECTIVELY COMBINE</p>
<p>STRATEGIC DATA WITH STRATEGIC AUDIENCES, TO SHAPE WHATEVER</p>
<p>THOUGHTS AND NEWS THEY WANT. AND I HAVE EQUIPPED IT, NOT</p>
<p>EVEN KNOWING IT. THAT PROCESS COULD APPLY TO</p>
<p>ANYONE OR ANYTHING. THERE IS THE DANGER.</p>
<p>IT COULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THEIR KIDS,</p>
<p>A COMPANY, A POLITICAL PARTY, A NEWS OUTLET, ANYTHING COULD BE</p>
<p>TARGETED FOR THAT SELECT VIRAL SPREAD OF JUST SOME</p>
<p>INFORMATION. THIS MAYBE GENIUS, BUT THAT</p>
<p>DOESN&rsquo;T MAKE IT FAIR, IT DOESN&rsquo;T MAKE IT GOOD AND IT</p>
<p>DOESN&rsquo;T MAKE IT ACCOUNTABLE. I WOULDN&rsquo;T WANT MY GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>TO HAVE THAT ABILITY. I WOULDN&rsquo;T WANT A COMPANY OR A</p>
<p>POLITICAL PARTY OR MY FRIEND AUGUST HERE OR MY MOTHER-IN-LAW</p>
<p>TO HAVE THAT CAPABILITY AND I CERTAINLY DON&rsquo;T WANT THAT TO BE</p>
<p>ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE IN CHINA. THERE IS NO QUESTION IT HAS</p>
<p>IMMENSE VALUE. AND AS PROOF OF THAT YOU ARE</p>
<p>HERE, BECAUSE THIS HAS NOT BEEN A FUN DAY.</p>
<p>I KNOW THAT. IT HAS NOT BEEN A FUN DAY FOR</p>
<p>US EITHER. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS</p>
<p>DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ONCE IT&rsquo;S ON AUTO CRUISE CONTROL AND IT&rsquo;S</p>
<p>NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WALL OFF DATA.</p>
<p>I KNOW THE IDEA, I KNOW A BIT ABOUT DATABASES, CORRUPTION OF</p>
<p>THOSE DATABASES, IT&rsquo;S VERY DIFFICULT TO WALL THINGS OFF.</p>
<p>AND UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS THIS THING IN HUMAN NATURE</p>
<p>WHERE THERE ARE DARK COMPONENTS FROM TIME TO TIME, A TEMPTATION</p>
<p>TO MONETIZE THINGS, OR PERHAPS USE THESE TOOLS FOR NEFARIOUS</p>
<p>PURPOSES, AND THEY CAN HAVE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING</p>
<p>CONSEQUENCES. SO I WILL WRAP UP MY COMMENTS</p>
<p>AND JUST SAY THAT, THIS IS SO ATTRACTIVE, TIKTOK POSES AS A</p>
<p>MR. ROGERS NEIGHBORHOOD BUT IT ACTS LIKE BIG BROTHER.</p>
<p>AND THAT HAS TO STOP. MADAM CHAIR, I YIELD BACK.</p>

<p>I AM PROBABLY LIKE A LOT OF PARENTS WHO ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF</p>
<p>CONGRESS OUT HERE, I KNOW A NUMBER OF US, WHEN YOU</p>
<p>TESTIFIED EARLIER TODAY YOU MENTIONED THAT THE OVER 35</p>
<p>SEGMENT WAS A GROWING GROUP OF POTENTIAL USERS.</p>
<p>AS IF OVER 35 IS OLD AND I REALIZE THAT MY OWN CHILDREN</p>
<p>THING THAT I&rsquo;M ANCIENT, MY FOUR BOYS.</p>
<p>BUT LIKE A LOT OF US UP HERE, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS</p>
<p>SOME POTENTIAL GOOD, AND OF COURSE MANY OF YOUR INFLUENCERS</p>
<p>ARE DOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS.</p>
<p>BUT ONE THING IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID A LOT, WAS SAFETY.</p>
<p>BUT AS A MOTHER AND A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, AND AS SOMEONE WHO IS</p>
<p>VERY CONCERNED ABOUT DRUG USE IN OUR COUNTRY, I WAS SURPRISED</p>
<p>THAT THAT DIDN&rsquo;T COME UP ONCE IN YOUR TESTIMONY, NO REAL</p>
<p>REFERENCE TO IT HERE TODAY. I HAVE RAISED MY CONCERNS IN</p>
<p>GENERAL ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SERVING AS AN ILLEGAL</p>
<p>MARKETPLACE FOR DRUGS IN PRIOR BIG TECH HEARINGS, AND I PLAN</p>
<p>TO CONTINUE THAT FOCUS DURING TODAY&rsquo;S HEARING.</p>
<p>MARCH 8TH, 2023 ARTICLE IN THE WASHINGTON POST DETAILED THE</p>
<p>FACT THAT TIKTOK HAS MADE LITTLE PROGRESS IN COMBATTING</p>
<p>THE SALE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS ON YOUR PLATFORM.</p>
<p>IN FACT, COLORADO ATTORNEY GENERAL PHIL WISER SAID THAT</p>
<p>GETTING DRUGS ON A PLATFORM LIKE YOURS WAS NEARLY AS</p>
<p>CONVENIENT AS USING A PHONE TO ORDER A PIZZA OR CALL AN UBER.</p>
<p>THAT SAME ARTICLE MENTIONS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE</p>
<p>BEEN FRUSTRATED BY TIKTOK&rsquo;S LACK OF COMPETITION IN THE FORM</p>
<p>OF DATA SHARING. IN MY VIEW, TIKTOK HAS TAKEN</p>
<p>LITTLE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS.</p>
<p>ACCORDING TO A MAY 22, BLOG POST FROM TIKTOK, YOU DONATED</p>
<p>$125,000 OR 0.001% OF YOUR 2022 REVENUE IN AN ANTI DRUG EFFORT,</p>
<p>IN THE FORM OF AD CREDITS. YOU ALSO DIRECTED HASHTAG DRUGS,</p>
<p>HASHTAG FENTANYL AND OTHER OBVIOUS HASHTAGS AWAY FROM POST</p>
<p>SELLING DRUGS TO A COMMUNITY RESOURCES PAGE AS IF A TEENAGER</p>
<p>LOOKING FOR DRUGS IS GOING TO LOOK FOR THEM AT HASHTAG DRUGS.</p>
<p>DRUG DEALERS HAVE EASILY WORKED THEIR WAY AROUND THIS USING</p>
<p>EMOJIS AND SLANG TOCOMMUNICATE THAT THEY HAVE DRUGS FOR SALE.</p>
<p>TO THIS DAY, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO LOG INTO YOUR</p>
<p>PLATFORM AND ACQUIRE DRUGS. AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT</p>
<p>CAN BE FATAL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MOVE PAST</p>
<p>THESE TOKEN EFFORTS TO PREVENT TEENAGERS FROM ACCESSING DRUGS</p>
<p>ON YOUR PLATFORM? AS PARENTS UP HERE TODAY WE MAY</p>
<p>NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR PLATFORM, I AM NOT A TECH</p>
<p>GURU. MANY OF US UP HERE MIGHT NOT</p>
<p>USE EXACTLY THE RIGHT LANGUAGE BUT WE KNOW WHEN OUR KIDS ARE</p>
<p>AT RISK. AND OUR KIDS ARE AT RISK ON</p>
<p>YOUR PLATFORM. SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO</p>
<p>MOVE PAST THE PREVIOUS TOKEN EFFORTS?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CONGRESSWOMAN, WE DO TAKE ILLEGAL DRUGS CONTENT ON OUR</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>PLATFORM VERY SERIOUSLY, IT VIOLATES OUR GUIDELINES,</p>
<p>PROACTIVELY IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING THEM.</p>
<p>AS YOU POINTED OUT IF ANYBODY SEARCHES FOR ANY DRUGS ON OUR</p>
<p>PLATFORM WE DO POINT THEM TO RESOURCES, TO HELP THEM WITH</p>
<p>THAT. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE ALSO</p>
<p>TAKEN PRODUCT CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE WE DON&rsquo;T ALLOW</p>
<p>UNDER 16 USERS TO USE THE RIGHT, DIRECT MESSAGING.</p>
<p>AND THAT&rsquo;S BECAUSE WE WANT, THERE WAS A TRADE-OFF HERE AND</p>
<p>WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL PROTECT THESE YOUNGER USERS BETTER FROM</p>
<p>GETTING CONTACTS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO PUSH ILLEGAL</p>
<p>ACTIVITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT.</p>
<p>NO COMPANY CAN BE PERFECT ON THIS.</p>

<p>I WILL RECLAIM MY TIME. CLEARLY IN THE THREE PLUS HOURS</p>
<p>YOU HAVE BEEN BEFORE US TODAY, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT</p>
<p>PROJECT TEXAS JUST DOES NOT PASS THE SMELL TEST.</p>
<p>MY CONSTITUENTS ARE CONCERNED THAT TIKTOK AND THE CHINESE</p>
<p>COMMUNIST PARTY ARE CONTROLLING THEIR DATA, AND SEEING OUR OWN</p>
<p>VULNERABILITIES. IF YOU WERE AN AMERICAN COMPANY</p>
<p>WE COULD LOOK AT YOUR TEN K, WE COULD SEE WHO YOUR SHAREHOLDERS</p>
<p>ARE, THE ANSWER YOU PROVIDED EARLIER TODAY, YOU WOULD RATHER</p>
<p>NOT TELL US, WHAT YOUR COMPENSATION IS OR HOW IT IS</p>
<p>DERIVED, NO AMERICAN CEO WOULD LIKE TO TELL US THAT.</p>
<p>BUT THEY HAVE TO. BECAUSE THEY ARE AN AMERICAN</p>
<p>COMPANY. SO WHAT YOU ARE DOING DOWN IN</p>
<p>TEXAS, IT&rsquo;S ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR US TO</p>
<p>BE CONVINCED THAT OUR PRIVACY IS NOT AT RISK.</p>
<p>HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE PROTECTING AMERICAN USERS</p>
<p>PRIVACY WITH THE CCP BEING SO HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH BYTEDANCE?</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S NOT POSSIBLE. CHINA WON&rsquo;T EVEN CARRY YOUR</p>

<p>HERE TODAY. SEPTEMBER 2020 WHEN THE WALL</p>

<p>SERVES UP SEX AND DRUG VIDEOS TO MINORS.</p>
<p>A CHILLING DEPICTION OF THE TYPES OF CONTENT THAT TIKTOKS</p>
<p>ALGORITHM IS CURATING FOR OUR CHILDREN.</p>
<p>THIS ARTICLE CLAIMS THAT YOUR APPLICATION SERVED AN ACCOUNT</p>
<p>THAT WAS REGISTERED AS A 13 YEAR OLD QUOTE, VIDEOS ABOUT</p>
<p>DRUG USE, IT REFERENCED TO COCAINE, METH ADDICTION AND</p>
<p>PROMOTIONAL VIDEOS FOR ONLINE SALES OF DRUGS.</p>
<p>WE ALL GREW THEM WAS ALSO FOUND TO HAVE DELIVERED COUNTLESS</p>
<p>VIDEOS DEPICTING PORNOGRAPHY AND OTHER ADULT CONTENT.</p>
<p>TO THE DEVICE OF AN ACCOUNT THAT WAS REGISTERED AS A 13</p>
<p>YEAR OLD. COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN TO THE</p>
<p>MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHY</p>
<p>YOUR COMPANY TEAMS THAT ACCEPTABLE FOR SUCH</p>

<p>WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY, I MENTIONED THIS, THIS IS AN</p>

<p>THE MAJORITY OF THE USERS EXPERIENCE ON TIKTOK THAT IT</p>

<p>YOU MENTIONED, PORN FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT ALLOWED ON OUR PLATFORM.</p>
<p>SO NO, I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE</p>
<p>TO CONSUME. &raquo; EARLIER THIS WEEK THE WALL</p>
<p>STREET JOURNAL PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE TITLED, TIKTOK CHINESE</p>
<p>PARTNER HAS ANOTHER WILDLY POPULAR UP IN THE U.S..</p>
<p>THIS APP IS CALLED CAP CUT, A VIDEO EDITING TOOL TO HELP</p>
<p>USERS GO VIRAL ON TIKTOK. FOR OBVIOUS REASONS MOST OF OUR</p>
<p>ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON TIKTOK AND BYTEDANCE, BUT OTHER</p>
<p>COMPANIES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS ARE ALSO</p>
<p>CONTINUING TO EXPLAIN THE PRIVACY OF AMERICANS.</p>
<p>TIKTOK, CAPCUT, LARK, FACE YOU, ALL CONTROLLED BY BYTEDANCE.</p>
<p>AND POSED SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERNS.</p>
<p>IN 2022, THE TOP BUZZ, AN INTERNATIONAL VERSION OF</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE CENSORED CHINESE NEWS APP WAS USED TO SPREAD PRO</p>
<p>CHINA MESSAGES TO AMERICANS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE DATA</p>
<p>PRIVACY OF AMERICANS WE MUST HAVE A CLEAR SET OF GUIDELINES</p>
<p>TO ENSURE AMERICANS DATA IS PROTECTED, AND NOT PASSED ALONG</p>
<p>TO UNKNOWN THIRD-PARTY ACTORS WHO COULD POSE A THREAT TO OUR</p>
<p>SECURITY. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO</p>

<p>BILL, NOT JUST ONE OF THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE</p>
<p>BUT ALSO THROUGH THE HOUSE OF THIS CONGRESS.</p>
<p>IT IS THE ONLY SYSTEMATIC WAY WE CAN ADDRESS PRIVACY</p>

<p>NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT TIKTOK DOES NOT POSE A THREAT,</p>
<p>AND CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO FOLLOW OUR LAWS WHEN THEY CONFLICT</p>
<p>WITH THE DESIRES OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY.</p>
<p>YOUR FIREWALL THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, IF YOU HAD A BAD</p>
<p>ACTOR IN YOUR TEXAS INITIATIVE, COULD GET THROUGH THAT FIRE</p>

<p>TODAY. YOUR TESTIMONY DISCUSSED AN</p>

<p>INCLUDING A FIREWALL BETWEEN UNITED STATES USER DATA AND</p>
<p>ENTITIES IN CHINA, SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFLUENCE BY CHINA&rsquo;S</p>

<p>ANNOUNCEMENT BY XIPHIAS, IT HAS INSTRUCTED TIKTOK TO SEPARATE</p>
<p>ITSELF FROM BYTEDANCE OR FACE A BAN.</p>
<p>TIKTOK&rsquo;S COMMITMENT TO RETAINING THIS FIREWALL IS NOT</p>
<p>A CROSSROADS. I WANT TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS</p>
<p>ABOUT YOUR COMPANY&rsquo;S LONG TERM PLANS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND</p>
<p>SECURITY OF AMERICAN DATA. THIS IS THE CROSS OF THE</p>

<p>NEED TO IMPROVE, APPROVE PROJECT TEXAS FOR TIKTOK TO</p>
<p>AGREE TO IT? &raquo; CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE</p>
<p>DESIGNED PROJECT TEXAS TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE DESCRIBED A LENGTH, IN THE</p>
<p>WRITTEN TESTIMONY AND IN MY OPENING STATEMENT.</p>
<p>THE FIREWALL OF AMERICAN DATA, ON AMERICAN SOIL BY AN AMERICAN</p>

<p>THIS IS DESIGNED FOR THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>WE CAN POST A VIDEO, AND YOU WANT SOMEONE TO FRANCE, TO SEE,</p>
<p>IT IT HAS TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>BY. AND IN THE CASE OF OTHER</p>

<p>OPPOSED TO A SALE OF TIKTOK? &raquo; I CANNOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF</p>
<p>THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, I CAN SAY THAT WE DESIGNED PROJECT</p>
<p>TEXAS TO TAKE IT FORWARD HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>AND AGAIN, I BELIEVE IN OFFICE, UNPRECEDENTED PROTECTION FOR</p>

<p>THERE IS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THAT LEADS PEOPLE TO BELIEVE</p>
<p>THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MORE ENOUGH AREAS AND THAT THERE IS</p>
<p>IN FACT DATA THAT IS CAPTURED, STORED, AND POSES A RISK NOT</p>

<p>HOW ABOUT IN TIKTOK? &raquo; RIGHT NOW, ALL EMPLOYEES OWN</p>

<p>I JUST DON&rsquo;T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DIDN&rsquo;T TELL MR. HUDSON THAT,</p>
<p>TRANSPARENT EARLIER, YOU MADE US DRAG IT OUT OF YOU.</p>
<p>ALL RIGHT, NOW, LET&rsquo;S TALK ABOUT THE KIDS.</p>
<p>YOU TOLD SEVERAL OF OUR FOLKS THAT THERE WAS A 60 MINUTE</p>
<p>DEADLINE AND THAT IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YOU COULD</p>
<p>NOT ACCESS THE LIVE OPTION. SO I TEXTED MY 17-YEAR-OLD AND</p>
<p>MY 15 YEAR OLD, AND I BASICALLY GOT SCOFFS BACK, WHEN I SAID,</p>
<p>ARE YOU ON LIMITED TO 60 MINUTES?</p>
<p>MY OLDER SON SAID, THERE IS A NOTICE I GET FROM TIME TO TIME</p>
<p>THAT SAID I SHOULDN&rsquo;T BE ON MORE THAN 60 MINUTES, BUT IT&rsquo;S</p>
<p>NEVER KICKED ME OFF AND MY YOUNGER SON SAID, I&rsquo;M ON AS</p>
<p>LONG AS I WANT TO BE. WHOEVER INFORMED YOU,</p>
<p>PARTICULARLY IF IT&rsquo;S YOUR LEGAL TEAM, THAT IS NOT ACCURATE,</p>
<p>THAT THEY ARE ON FOR MORE THAN 60 MINUTES AND THEY CAN ACCESS</p>
<p>THE LIVE SECTION, I BELIEVE IT WAS MR. CARTER THAT YOU SAID,</p>
<p>UNDER 18 YOU CAN&rsquo;T ACCESS THE LIVE SECTION.</p>
<p>HE HAS DONE IT, SO WHATEVER IT IS YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING,</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S NOT GETTING DONE. LET&rsquo;S TALK ABOUT THE LAW FOR A</p>
<p>MINUTE. YOU SHARE A LEGAL TEAM BUT YOU</p>
<p>KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU HAVE A FIREWALL BETWEEN YOU AND</p>
<p>BYTEDANCE. YOU CAN&rsquo;T HAVE AN EFFECTIVE</p>
<p>FIREWALL UNDER THE UNITED STATES INTERPRETATION OF SUCH,</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE SHARING LEGAL COUNSEL BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU</p>
<p>SAY TO YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL THEY CAN SHARE INTERNALLY.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE THE SAME LAWYERS, MAYBE YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT</p>
<p>TEAMS OF LAWYERS IN THE LAW FIRM BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU</p>
<p>SAID TO US TODAY. YOU SAID YOU SHARE LAWYERS.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO FIREWALL, LEGALLY. I&rsquo;M JUST TELLING YOU.</p>
<p>SO IF YOU WANT TO CLEAN IT UP AND BE TRANSPARENT, YOU NEED TO</p>
<p>DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WOULDN&rsquo;T YOU AGREE?</p>
<p>YES OR NO? THAT YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING</p>

<p>YOU CAN&rsquo;T ON WHAT ABOUT. BECAUSE BY LAW, ACCORDING THAT</p>
<p>2017 NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE LAW, THEY HAVE TO DO IT.</p>

<p>MY POINT IS, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO. AND THAT&rsquo;S WHERE CONCERNS COME</p>
<p>FROM, OVER 300 TIKTOK EMPLOYEES HAVE WORKED FOR CHINA STATE RUN</p>
<p>PROPAGANDA MEDIA, THAT&rsquo;S JUST FROM LOOKING AT THE LINKEDIN</p>
<p>PROFILES. OKAY, MY LAST POINT IS THIS I</p>
<p>WANT TO SAY THAT ALL THE TEENAGERS OUT THERE IN THE</p>
<p>TIKTOK INFLATORS WHO THINK WE&rsquo;RE JUST OLDEN AT OF TOUCH</p>
<p>AND OH NO WE&rsquo;RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR</p>
<p>FAVORITE APP. YOU MAY NOT CARE THAT YOUR DATA</p>
<p>IS BEING ACCESSED NOW, BUT IT WILL BE ONE DAY WHEN YOU DO</p>
<p>CARE ABOUT IT. HERE&rsquo;S THE REAL PROBLEM, WHEN</p>
<p>DATA COMES POWER, THEY CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU SEE AND HOW YOU</p>
<p>SEE IT, THEY CAN MAKE YOU BELIEVE THINGS THAT ARE NOT</p>
<p>TRUE, THEY CAN ENCOURAGE YOU TO ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT WILL</p>
<p>DESTROY YOUR LIFE. EVEN IF IT IS NOT HAPPENING YET,</p>
<p>IT COULD IN THE FUTURE. THE LONG TERM GOAL OF THE</p>
<p>CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IS THE DEMISE OF THE AMERICAN POWER,</p>
<p>AND THAT STARTS WITH OUR YOUTH. AT ANY MOMENT, THEY CAN DEMAND</p>
<p>ALL OF TIKTOK&rsquo;S DATA BE USED TO DESIGN AN A.I. ALGORITHM, WITH</p>
<p>THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PROMOTING CHINESE INTERESTS IN DESTROYING</p>
<p>OUR SOCIETY FROM WITHIN. YOU ARE KNOW WHY THAT&rsquo;S</p>
<p>DEMOCRAT, WHY DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICANS HAVE COME TOGETHER</p>
<p>ON THIS? THAT&rsquo;S WHY WE ARE SO CONCERNED.</p>
<p>THANK YOU, AND I YIELD BACK. &raquo; GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK.</p>
<p>I REMIND THE MEMBERS THEY HAVE TEN BUSINESS DAYS TO SUBMIT</p>
<p>QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD, I ASK OUR WITNESSES TO RESPOND TO THE</p>
<p>QUESTIONS PROMPTLY, PURSUANT TO COMMITTEE RULES, I ASK</p>
<p>UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ENTER THE DOCUMENTS FROM THE STAFF LIST</p>
<p>INTO THE RECORD. WITHOUT OBJECTION?</p>
<p>ORDERED. MEMBERS SHOULD SUBMIT THEIR</p>
<p>QUESTIONS BY THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 6TH, WITHOUT</p>
<p>OBJECTION, THE COMMITTEE IS ADJOURNED.</p>
