Berg video everything</p><p>my my views go up my subscribers go up</p><p>and so they actually just flow attention</p><p>and I&rsquo;m like they don&rsquo;t realize that</p><p>they&rsquo;re promoting my channel and I I</p><p>don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t ever watch them but it&rsquo;s</p><p>just ridiculous the nice thing is</p><p>regardless of what anyone next like</p><p>regardless of what anyone says</p><p>negatively about you as long as your</p><p>demeanor is nice and the way you convey</p><p>yourself is correct who cares yeah at</p><p>the end of the day you&rsquo;re always gonna</p><p>that&rsquo;s the way I looked at it you know</p><p>if people come to my channel and see my</p><p>videos regardless of how did the bay</p><p>wane regardless of how he framed it</p><p>people are gonna see me and their</p><p>opinions gonna change yeah they&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>observe the sanity there and like</p><p>they&rsquo;re gonna ignore the other guy not</p><p>to dwell too much on this part</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had people you know send me things</p><p>like he like filmed his grandfather</p><p>having a heart attack he you know made a</p><p>video about furious Pete getting cancer</p><p>joking about it you know he&rsquo;s obviously</p><p>he has some very I mean there&rsquo;s some</p><p>psychopathic stuff he talked about like</p><p>hurting people animals and and there&rsquo;s</p><p>the funny thing that I can&rsquo;t get over is</p><p>uh he was eating grapes out of his</p><p>girlfriend&rsquo;s feet in one of the videos</p><p>of yet on his channel</p><p>it was completely ridiculous I was like</p><p>oh my god this guy a hundred percent no</p><p>I think he needs some more DHA and I</p><p>think he has blood sugar problems I mean</p><p>some b12 - oh yeah definitely just yeah</p><p>good case study on that so I wanted to</p><p>just dive right into a couple things you</p><p>know I always kind of like to start out</p><p>with just the basic definition of the</p><p>word food which comes from the</p><p>derivation nutrients which is we eat to</p><p>get fuel and nutrients and so pretty</p><p>much all of the things that I promote</p><p>and push out there&rsquo;s um if you can find</p><p>a diet that can provide your nutrients</p><p>and you can provide the right fuel I</p><p>think you&rsquo;re gonna be healthy and so one</p><p>of the advantages that I have is that</p><p>I&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of people over 29</p><p>years in practice like just you know</p><p>until you work with</p><p>one-on-one with all these different</p><p>types of cases you you know you may or</p><p>may not get it right but we&rsquo;ve gotten</p><p>great success with this with a healthy</p><p>version of the keto plan so that&rsquo;s what</p><p>I&rsquo;m recommending however I think that</p><p>you know you you brought up some good</p><p>points in your videos and I want to just</p><p>talk to them but I I personally find</p><p>that when you go carnival you drop your</p><p>insulin down I mean you&rsquo;re going zero</p><p>zero carb and you&rsquo;re really dropping</p><p>inflammatory conditions across the board</p><p>so you&rsquo;re gonna get amazing results with</p><p>a lot of conditions especially</p><p>autoimmune and also gut issues and</p><p>digestive issues and probably allergies</p><p>and all sorts of things so I&rsquo;m really in</p><p>favor of it there&rsquo;s a couple things that</p><p>I I want to bring up regarding the</p><p>vegetables in a little bit but I want to</p><p>first find out from your viewpoint</p><p>what&rsquo;s how do you handle the situation</p><p>of consuming too much protein I mean is</p><p>that an issue because like what like for</p><p>example Shaun Baker recommend I mean</p><p>like when one video he&rsquo;s get like what 3</p><p>or 4 pounds of meat you know so I think</p><p>first I have to say that you know about</p><p>6 years ago when I started this diet I</p><p>actually came across the carnivore diet</p><p>and it was called the zero carb diet at</p><p>the time and when I read information on</p><p>the zero carb diet I said well this</p><p>isn&rsquo;t when I follow because I advocate</p><p>towards nutrient density towards</p><p>maintaining a ketogenic metabolism I</p><p>advocate for keeping the caloric density</p><p>high while maintaining as low of a food</p><p>volume as possible obviously eating 4 to</p><p>5 pounds of ribeye a day does not do</p><p>that so when I saw this zero carb diet</p><p>six years ago I dismissed it and I just</p><p>came up with my own idea of like paleo</p><p>keto and after doing that diet for about</p><p>three and a half four years that&rsquo;s when</p><p>I started making YouTube videos but when</p><p>the carnivore diet became really popular</p><p>I said okay I have to kind of market</p><p>myself towards these people because I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t really have that great of a</p><p>viewer base and although I don&rsquo;t</p><p>consider my diet to technically be</p><p>carnivore because I have other</p><p>requirements their idea is just eat meat</p><p>all day drink water that&rsquo;s</p><p>mine is based around the nutrients</p><p>around the science around these things</p><p>so although my diet loosely fits under</p><p>what those people do there&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>other things that separates it and to</p><p>touch on the four pound of protein a day</p><p>that&rsquo;s Ron Baker&rsquo;s doing you know I did</p><p>a video last week where I compared the</p><p>nutrient density of like ten common</p><p>foods you know we looked at meat we</p><p>looked at liver we looked at Easter&rsquo;s we</p><p>looked at salmon roe we compared the</p><p>nutrient content of these foods and</p><p>these foods like liver and oysters made</p><p>it looked like oh what&rsquo;s the point of</p><p>even eating muscle meat so someone like</p><p>Shaun Baker who&rsquo;s eating four pounds of</p><p>her by a day I mean is he getting</p><p>calories is he getting fat I have a</p><p>couple problems with that I mean I did</p><p>try that you know I&rsquo;m a very objective</p><p>person a very open mind that I was like</p><p>okay maybe this guy does have something</p><p>I&rsquo;m missing so I go to the store I buy</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been eating grass fed</p><p>high-quality pasture race stuff I spent</p><p>seven dollars a dozen on eggs at the</p><p>Union Square Green Market you know crazy</p><p>stuff 14 dollars a pound for raw butter</p><p>and I said all right let me go get these</p><p>grain fed steaks from the supermarket I</p><p>was so thirsty</p><p>I was so hungry I could not satiate my</p><p>appetite this 4 or 5 pound of meat thing</p><p>that a lot of people are doing on this</p><p>diet I don&rsquo;t think it works for a lot of</p><p>people and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s successful</p><p>for a variety of reasons not only does</p><p>protein and just muscle meat in general</p><p>lack a lot of the satiation aspects of</p><p>organ meats and nutrient-dense foods it</p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily always have good</p><p>macronutrient ratios and my one pet</p><p>peeve is he literally only eats ribeye</p><p>and if you look at the butcher yield of</p><p>an animal ribeye is like 3 percent of</p><p>the animal and how could you justify</p><p>consuming just ribeye steaks when in the</p><p>past if we were to consume an animal the</p><p>only fatty parts of the animal would</p><p>have been the kidney fat the suet the</p><p>trim fat the brisket the brain you know</p><p>there are very very specific parts of</p><p>the animal that we would have had to</p><p>have even to get the fat and ribeye is</p><p>like an unnatural source of that so the</p><p>original question was the concern about</p><p>high protein yeah like how do you is it</p><p>just a high protein diet or is it can</p><p>you</p><p>make it a moderate protein diet so the a</p><p>lot of the veteran zero car people there</p><p>are there&rsquo;s a family I believe that&rsquo;s</p><p>been on this diet for like 20 years and</p><p>all they eat a steak there&rsquo;s another guy</p><p>who only eats is pretty much a steak and</p><p>ground beef on this diet and the wisdom</p><p>of these zero carb veterans has</p><p>unfortunately created this almost</p><p>cult-like mentality that you&rsquo;re just</p><p>supposed to eat meat and drink water and</p><p>when they don&rsquo;t go into specifics like I</p><p>mean obviously chicken and pork have a</p><p>drastically different omega-3 ratio of</p><p>beef but if you do increase the nutrient</p><p>density of the diet and you do choose</p><p>the right foods the macronutrient ratios</p><p>should fall in line with you know 70 80</p><p>percent fats a 20 percent protein I mean</p><p>in some cases of people with a very high</p><p>lean body mass we might see some</p><p>variance there we might see 60 65 % fat</p><p>the rest protein but you know consuming</p><p>4 to 5 pounds of per by a day and</p><p>consuming incredibly high amounts of</p><p>protein is not how the diet should be</p><p>especially considered the main thing to</p><p>consider here is these people are</p><p>cooking their meat fairly thoroughly and</p><p>when you heat meat to well done like</p><p>ground beef you&rsquo;re degrading about 50</p><p>percent of the B vitamins you the fat</p><p>soluble vitamins you don&rsquo;t lose too many</p><p>unfortunately there&rsquo;s not a lot of fat</p><p>soluble vitamins and muscle meat so</p><p>that&rsquo;s not really a concern but one big</p><p>reason a lot of these people are eating</p><p>4 or 5 pounds of steak is partially</p><p>because they&rsquo;re not getting as many B</p><p>vitamins as they should because of the</p><p>cooking time and I mean this can be</p><p>alleviated by a food like liver because</p><p>liver might literally have ten times the</p><p>amount of vitamin b12 that muscle meat</p><p>has and even if you cook the liver</p><p>you&rsquo;re still retaining a large amount of</p><p>the vitamins but III think the main</p><p>principle of the diet should be eat fat</p><p>to satiation eat organ meats eat</p><p>nutrient-dense foods muscle meat should</p><p>be on the back burner so to speak it</p><p>should be the last thing you consume and</p><p>and most meals you have if you do</p><p>consume high quality fats if you do</p><p>consume organ meats and nutrient-dense</p><p>foods most of the time you won&rsquo;t even be</p><p>hungry for protein unfortunately you</p><p>know those elements of protein not being</p><p>too nutri</p><p>and not being too satiating a lot of</p><p>people fall into the trap of consuming</p><p>you know four to five pounds of meat a</p><p>day on this diet and they&rsquo;re saying I&rsquo;m</p><p>hungry I can&rsquo;t say che my appetite some</p><p>people are even gaining weight and then</p><p>they go to the forums they ask for help</p><p>and advice they get is all your body</p><p>needs nutrition just eat more meat but</p><p>that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense because</p><p>muscle meat doesn&rsquo;t have nutrition in it</p><p>right so I think I&rsquo;ve given you I mean a</p><p>little bit of information to work with</p><p>there so yeah I agree and I think that</p><p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do this diet I think</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing it right because not only</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing the organ meats and you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing fish eggs and things like that</p><p>but you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re consuming a lot of</p><p>this almost raw or not overly cooked</p><p>yeah and that&rsquo;s the other point is like</p><p>when you cook you know even when you</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re gonna vitamin C</p><p>definitely is effective pasteurization</p><p>and high heat so yeah we didn&rsquo;t even</p><p>touch my vitamin C there yeah so you&rsquo;re</p><p>busy knock it right out so can you give</p><p>us an example of what what you&rsquo;ll eat in</p><p>a given day yeah before I go into that I</p><p>did want to mention a lot of the stuff I</p><p>talk about is based on kind of like what</p><p>indigenous groups used to eat and it&rsquo;s</p><p>important to keep in mind that these</p><p>indigenous groups that did consume meat</p><p>every single one of them consume plant</p><p>food even the Eskimos and the Inuit did</p><p>consume small amounts of plant foods and</p><p>the majority of these hunter-gatherer</p><p>groups did consume I would I think the</p><p>estimation is about 65 to 70 percent of</p><p>their calories from animal foods but</p><p>that&rsquo;s a caloric percentage if we look</p><p>at food volume you know plant foods tend</p><p>to be much higher volume for their</p><p>caloric density so these plant foods</p><p>were present in these indigenous diets</p><p>but the reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up is</p><p>because these indigenous diets consumed</p><p>both raw and cooked animal foods they</p><p>consumed certain foods raw certain foods</p><p>cooked and even on one animal if they</p><p>slaughtered a reindeer they preferred</p><p>the upper leg marrow cooked and the</p><p>lower leg marrow raw they preferred the</p><p>head cooked they preferred the liver</p><p>Roth there were very very specific</p><p>preferences in these indigenous groups</p><p>and we can assume those tie-in generally</p><p>to the nutrient density of the food so</p><p>what whether you try to argue for a raw</p><p>diet whether you try to argue for a</p><p>cooked diet whether you try to argue for</p><p>a diet for your plants when you actually</p><p>look at what humans used to eat and and</p><p>even looking at blue zones now blue</p><p>zones pretty much eat hunter-gatherer</p><p>diets it&rsquo;s just blue zones have less</p><p>animal foods that hunter-gatherers used</p><p>to have that brings up a good point</p><p>because um I mean can you imagine a raw</p><p>Brussels sprouts I mean the taste I mean</p><p>I was talking to my buddy the other day</p><p>and we each had different theories about</p><p>why we started cooking food my theory</p><p>was along the lines of a lot of the</p><p>parts of the animal are very difficult</p><p>to consume in a raw state the tougher</p><p>meat his theory was when a lot of the</p><p>megafauna died off and we started</p><p>gathering plants that we had to cook</p><p>plant foods to eat them so that we just</p><p>threw the meat in with the plant food so</p><p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of theories on why we</p><p>started cooking our food but a large</p><p>majority of plant foods are you know</p><p>ideally if you take them out of nature</p><p>and you can&rsquo;t consume them in their raw</p><p>state they probably shouldn&rsquo;t be</p><p>consumed in a large amount in their raw</p><p>state but to tie back to foods I eat in</p><p>a day usually I generally have nutrient</p><p>goals that I try to meet so in</p><p>particular DHA and omega-3 ratio is the</p><p>most important thing for me in my diet</p><p>so I make sure that all the meat is</p><p>sourced from a high-quality and that I</p><p>include a high source of DHA whether</p><p>it&rsquo;s brain tissue bone marrow fatty fish</p><p>salmon roe fish eggs are great most</p><p>people are probably more familiar with</p><p>like caviar and Kura tobiko</p><p>more common names for it the second goal</p><p>I usually strive for is a high vitamin A</p><p>intake retinoic acid and the only real</p><p>source of retinoic acid in an animal is</p><p>deliver you could look at every other</p><p>tissue on the animal nothing comes close</p><p>to the retinoic acid content of liver</p><p>it&rsquo;s like twenty-four hundred percent</p><p>it&rsquo;s like something crazy it&rsquo;s like</p><p>almost 3,000 percent of the daily value</p><p>but if the next best food are like eggs</p><p>at 30 percent it&rsquo;s not even close but</p><p>what&rsquo;s important to keep in mind is with</p><p>that high retinoic acid intake your body</p><p>stores fat soluble vitamins for the</p><p>winter</p><p>so your body doesn&rsquo;t just want a bunch</p><p>of vitamin A you need to consume other</p><p>fat soluble vitamins if you&rsquo;re consuming</p><p>large amounts of vitamin A so I need to</p><p>make sure to match that vitamin A with</p><p>the k2 with the vitamin d3 because if</p><p>you&rsquo;re consuming liver in nature</p><p>realistically speaking you&rsquo;re gonna be</p><p>out in the Sun there&rsquo;s other parts of</p><p>the animal you&rsquo;re going to consume and I</p><p>mean we do see preference for organs and</p><p>animals I mean I don&rsquo;t know if you heard</p><p>about there&rsquo;s a story where like killer</p><p>whales were just eating the shark&rsquo;s</p><p>liver and leaving the rest you know when</p><p>bears hunt and they&rsquo;re already fattened</p><p>up for the winter and there&rsquo;s plenty of</p><p>salmon around they&rsquo;ll literally kill the</p><p>salmon they&rsquo;ll eat the ROE and they&rsquo;ll</p><p>leave the rest so there is preference</p><p>for these organs by animals in nature</p><p>but if we actually look at realistic</p><p>ratios of you know how much does a liver</p><p>way how much does an animal way you know</p><p>we can kind of gauge okay for livers to</p><p>pounds the meat yield is 40 pounds maybe</p><p>two pounds of liver per 40 pounds of</p><p>meat makes the most sense so once I</p><p>achieve my omega-3 intake and my vitamin</p><p>A intake I generally look for vitamin k2</p><p>as it&rsquo;s very important for calcium</p><p>metabolism and it just it&rsquo;s bunched in</p><p>with the fat side of Ottomans in you</p><p>know metabolizing t3 helping retinoic</p><p>acid you need to consume it in balance</p><p>and although liver does have some</p><p>vitamin k2 the main source is</p><p>high-quality animal fats and I think</p><p>this is the main thing people overlook</p><p>is in order for an animal food to be</p><p>nutrient dense it has to be in an</p><p>environment where it&rsquo;s consuming</p><p>nutrient-dense food so when a cow eats</p><p>grass you know grass has a vitamin k1</p><p>the cow converted to vitamin k2 the</p><p>grass has carotenoids that the cow</p><p>converts to retinoic acid that the grass</p><p>also has just nutrients that the cow can</p><p>convert through the bacteria in its</p><p>stomach into the linoleic acids that the</p><p>body and the humans can then convert to</p><p>EPA and DHA if the cow is not eating</p><p>grass then where is it getting its</p><p>nutrition from if the corn and the soy</p><p>feed that the cat was consuming does not</p><p>have these nutrients in it it&rsquo;s not</p><p>going to be present in the food</p><p>that&rsquo;s why if we look at like milk from</p><p>the supermarket and then compare it to</p><p>like a raw raw cow cheese from France</p><p>you know oh well why does that raw cow</p><p>cheese have literally every vitamin and</p><p>mineral you know why are there</p><p>indigenous groups that literally only</p><p>ate you know the Swiss only ate cheese</p><p>and rye bread but now it&rsquo;s saying that</p><p>milk doesn&rsquo;t have nutrients a lot of</p><p>this ties in with the food quality and I</p><p>think one of the interesting theories</p><p>behind that is you know no one really</p><p>thinks fish is unhealthy but people will</p><p>try to argue that meats unhealthy</p><p>sometimes and the thing with fish is a</p><p>lot of fish that people consume you know</p><p>more of a tends to be wild caught in</p><p>higher quality than the meat so I think</p><p>a lot of that ties in there and by</p><p>achieving a high omega-3 intake by</p><p>achieving a high vitamin A intake and a</p><p>high vitamin k2 intake I inherently get</p><p>all of my other vitamins because if I&rsquo;m</p><p>consuming liver liver has vitamin C</p><p>liver has pretty much every vitamin and</p><p>mineral you need in large amounts if I&rsquo;m</p><p>consuming omega-3s and vitamin k2 the</p><p>foods that are high in k2 are also very</p><p>high in vitamin E so I mean</p><p>unfortunately I would argue that 90 very</p><p>high percentage of people on the</p><p>carnivore diet are not getting these</p><p>nutrients because you need to eat</p><p>incredibly specific foods to obtain them</p><p>and you know although I&rsquo;m making it</p><p>sound a little difficult that can be</p><p>just eating some liver with some fish</p><p>eggs with some fish but a lot of the</p><p>time these are foods that people</p><p>generally don&rsquo;t want to or don&rsquo;t enjoy</p><p>eating right yeah so so what what do you</p><p>do with like people you consult that</p><p>just you know I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t find high</p><p>quality like liver for example they&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna go to the store they like and they</p><p>just can&rsquo;t afford it what do they do</p><p>hypothetically speaking you want a</p><p>worst-case scenario I&rsquo;m really broke</p><p>yeah I have no I can&rsquo;t afford this food</p><p>yeah like for like for example like one</p><p>of the companies that I recommend is the</p><p>us wellness I don&rsquo;t get any kickbacks</p><p>but the point is that I do know that</p><p>their farms are</p><p>really good and they grass finish</p><p>everything and they take care of the</p><p>soil so I know that they you also have</p><p>organ meats that are kind of mesh into</p><p>the liverwurst and they have heart and I</p><p>like the quality but it&rsquo;s hard to find</p><p>that high quality even at the healthy</p><p>store where you gonna find it so you now</p><p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re gonna have to find a farm</p><p>or you&rsquo;re gonna actually have to order</p><p>online somewhere so how do you overcome</p><p>that barrier but but either way that</p><p>tends to be prohibitively expensive for</p><p>a lot of people right unfortunately so</p><p>so food sourcing is a big thing I mean</p><p>I&rsquo;m in New York City I&rsquo;ve I used to work</p><p>as a bartender in New York City</p><p>restaurants and I built some</p><p>relationships with food purveyors so I</p><p>have unusual access like I&rsquo;ll go to the</p><p>wholesale fish market that sells fish to</p><p>all the restaurants in New York City and</p><p>the guy will sell me 20 pounds of</p><p>flounder roe for 20 bucks you know like</p><p>I&rsquo;ll go to I&rsquo;ll get a case of farro</p><p>Island salmon for $6 a pound I&rsquo;ll go to</p><p>master purveyors and I&rsquo;ll buy rolls of</p><p>grass-fed ribeye for four very I don&rsquo;t</p><p>want to say the prices people are gonna</p><p>get mad at me but but I will get</p><p>incredibly good prices on me because I</p><p>have taken the time to find high-quality</p><p>sources but even outside of those</p><p>sources I go to local farms on eat wild</p><p>calm</p><p>there&rsquo;s also maybe I think real food</p><p>calm and you can even look on your local</p><p>Craigslist to find these farmers and</p><p>even these local farms on eat wild I</p><p>mean you think hey maybe they&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>try to gauge people because they&rsquo;re in a</p><p>city area but the food tends to be very</p><p>affordable I&rsquo;ve seen organ meats from</p><p>four to seven dollars a pound</p><p>beef fat trim fat tends to be very very</p><p>cheap if you want to get some of your</p><p>calories from that but the sourcing</p><p>thing I can&rsquo;t it really is an</p><p>understatement this food sourcing is the</p><p>most difficult thing to do on this diet</p><p>Bar None the amount of time I invest in</p><p>food sourcing just to give you an idea</p><p>the other day I went to the Asian fish</p><p>market to buy a couple mackerel I went</p><p>to the Union Square green market to buy</p><p>some eggs I went to this other place the</p><p>farm to buy some raw high-quality cheats</p><p>I had my meat purveyor deliver some</p><p>great</p><p>ribeye I go to a halal market no it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s crazy I go to a halal market in in</p><p>the Bronx and I get my kidneys fresh</p><p>lamb kidneys all the lamb organs and</p><p>then sometimes I even go down to the</p><p>live kill markets and get some freshly</p><p>killed duck so there is a lot of time</p><p>that I personally invested in the food</p><p>quality you know I&rsquo;m calling up</p><p>fisheries in the summer to see what the</p><p>access to salmon roe is so that&rsquo;s a</p><p>barrier yeah it&rsquo;s making it back to</p><p>practical I can go to my local</p><p>supermarket hush some supermarkets do</p><p>have very affordable grass-fed beef my</p><p>supermarket sells they were selling New</p><p>York strip steaks from Australia for</p><p>$5.99 a pound but the liver and the</p><p>organs and that stuff that&rsquo;s where it</p><p>gets difficult right anybody can you get</p><p>oyster &rsquo;s and shellfish and clams pretty</p><p>easily</p><p>yes but that comes into a price issue</p><p>not everyone can afford paying 6 to 7</p><p>dollars a dozen for eggs that are soy</p><p>free and pasture raised</p><p>not everyone can find a high-quality</p><p>grass-fed fat source and I did a video</p><p>on budgeting the zero carnivore diet and</p><p>hypothetically the cheapest thing you</p><p>could do is I mean you could get really</p><p>cheap ground beef for like a dollar</p><p>fifty two dollars a pound and it</p><p>probably has e.coli in it but or and</p><p>then you can get eggs</p><p>you know how cheap they sell the</p><p>conventionally raised eggs in the</p><p>supermarket like a dollar it doesn&rsquo;t so</p><p>hypothetically speaking you could follow</p><p>this diet for two to three dollars a day</p><p>now the problem with that is you&rsquo;re</p><p>pretty much just getting calories and</p><p>macronutrients because the</p><p>conventionally raised stuff is not</p><p>really nutrient-dense I mean it will</p><p>have some nutrients in it you know the</p><p>eggs will have some DHA the eggs will</p><p>have some vitamin A eggs will have some</p><p>vitamins not nearly as high as pasture</p><p>rates and when we&rsquo;re saying</p><p>conventionally raised stuff has lower</p><p>nutrients than grass-fed stuff we&rsquo;re</p><p>literally talking in some cases five to</p><p>ten times the amount of vitamins and</p><p>certain fatty acids so it does make a</p><p>significant difference so if you were</p><p>following a diet of conventional eggs</p><p>and grass-fed of ground beef and you can</p><p>only afford to do that the real solution</p><p>would be certain supplements such as</p><p>fish oil</p><p>liver oil vitamin k2 supplements by</p><p>doing that can you try to replicate what</p><p>the nutrient density in the diet should</p><p>be I mean it&rsquo;s better than nothing yeah</p><p>right it&rsquo;s safe to say and I mean</p><p>vitamin d3 is an understatement</p><p>I think almost everyone needs to be</p><p>supplementing vitamin d3 but the problem</p><p>with vitamin d3 is and this doesn&rsquo;t tie</p><p>in as much to the diet but the reason</p><p>it&rsquo;s so important for zero carb</p><p>carnivore is because if you do increase</p><p>your vitamin intake you need to get</p><p>adequate d3 as well your body wants to</p><p>store d3 for the winter too but when you</p><p>take an oral supplement of d3 the</p><p>metabolism is drastically different than</p><p>the Sun and the main concern is when you</p><p>consume excess amounts of vitamin d3 I D</p><p>think it</p><p>no no d3 just vitamin d3 right</p><p>what about k2 well when you when you</p><p>take like massive doses of vitamin d3</p><p>potentially you can get hypercalcemia an</p><p>issue because you because you also need</p><p>because Kate Kate Kate uu works with d3</p><p>and they help balance the blood levels</p><p>of calcium so these people are doing</p><p>massive amounts over 100,000 I used and</p><p>they&rsquo;re not too crazy they&rsquo;re setting</p><p>themselves up for calcification and</p><p>definitely definitely an importance in</p><p>just over all vitamin balance you know</p><p>if it&rsquo;s impractical if it&rsquo;s a crazy high</p><p>dose but to my understanding excess</p><p>vitamin d3 from supplementation will</p><p>cause those problems but excess vitamin</p><p>d3 from the Sun it gets metabolized way</p><p>differently right it&rsquo;s beneficial your</p><p>body is not going to to turn the excess</p><p>vitamin d3 from the Sun into anything</p><p>negative or harmful whereas it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>really know what to do with the</p><p>supplemental version different metabolic</p><p>pathways that&rsquo;s just something very</p><p>important to mention on the carnivore</p><p>diet if you are diving into these</p><p>supplements it&rsquo;s unfortunate you know</p><p>the calcium RDA is way too high and the</p><p>d3 and the k2 rdas are way too low and</p><p>and no one understands and people tend</p><p>to try to do extremes</p><p>I&rsquo;ve heard people I&rsquo;ve heard me</p><p>taken hundred thousand IU of vitamin d3</p><p>and I&rsquo;m like dude what are you trying to</p><p>kill yourself like look take a look at</p><p>as people age they get stiff they get</p><p>calcium deposits their body starts to</p><p>calcify they get the arteries become</p><p>calcified they get calcification on</p><p>their eyes so like and then they&rsquo;re</p><p>taking 500 milligrams of calcium</p><p>carbonate I&rsquo;m like now so it&rsquo;s funny</p><p>because calcium carbonate the</p><p>bioavailability is like miniscule it&rsquo;s</p><p>like yeah I think it&rsquo;s like 5% yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>like eating literally chewing on the</p><p>cement and that wall out there yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>crazy so and then I want to bring up the</p><p>point just and vegetables in general I</p><p>personally do better when I eat</p><p>vegetables I don&rsquo;t have any problems and</p><p>and one of the reasons why I recommend</p><p>higher quantities is specifically</p><p>potassium just because the I know our</p><p>das are not I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a bunch of</p><p>crap it&rsquo;s arbitrary but it&rsquo;s kind of a</p><p>reference that there&rsquo;s some truth to</p><p>them yeah but as far as potassium goes</p><p>higher amounts of potassium are needed</p><p>your body can get rid of excess amount</p><p>of potassium definitely way more than</p><p>excessive amounts of iron so the kidney</p><p>can do with it but I find I do much</p><p>better when I do higher amounts of</p><p>potassium things but if you have a</p><p>digestive problem I think or SIBO</p><p>whatever you&rsquo;re gonna like blow yourself</p><p>out because you&rsquo;re gonna get all sorts</p><p>of issues but when I actually go lower</p><p>on the vegetables I just don&rsquo;t feel</p><p>quite right my own body so so I have</p><p>quite a few people doing this with great</p><p>success so I&rsquo;m not about to put everyone</p><p>on the car number but I think it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m</p><p>recommending it for people with</p><p>digestive problems immune problems</p><p>autoimmune then I want to bring up a</p><p>point about phytonutrients like like</p><p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a really great this is</p><p>a really this is a good book that I</p><p>wanted to show you this is like all the</p><p>research on endocrine disruptors by the</p><p>World Health Organization like these</p><p>endocrine disruptors in environment</p><p>including</p><p>frickin DDT in and the metabolite dde</p><p>is actually their finding and residues</p><p>in our bodies and infants and it&rsquo;s and</p><p>you got all the different we&rsquo;re like</p><p>swimming in a sea of chemicals so the</p><p>phytonutrients in certain cruciferous</p><p>vegetables they have properties of</p><p>increasing phase 1 phase 2</p><p>detoxification enhancing our own ability</p><p>to rid these poisons so I just see a</p><p>real nice benefit with that and so I&rsquo;m</p><p>just gonna get your comment on that yeah</p><p>I mean so we&rsquo;re talking about like</p><p>carotenoids ellagic acid reservatrol</p><p>resveratrol flavonoids I don&rsquo;t okay all</p><p>three carbonyls talking about all these</p><p>things the first thing was electrolyte</p><p>imbalance and I think the carnivore diet</p><p>and I&rsquo;ve spoken to a lot of a lot of my</p><p>clients have had issues with irregular</p><p>heartbeat and arrhythmia on the</p><p>carnivore diet and these you know if we</p><p>look at the Inuit Eskimos they didn&rsquo;t</p><p>salt their food because they didn&rsquo;t grow</p><p>up with salt on their food and right now</p><p>on people on the carnivore diet are</p><p>assaulting their food pretty heavily now</p><p>meat without salt on it has fairly good</p><p>ratios of sodium to potassium to</p><p>magnesium as soon as you put a little</p><p>bit of salt on your food that&rsquo;s where</p><p>things can really get problematic</p><p>because you salt your food it&rsquo;s a please</p><p>potassium which depletes magnesium and</p><p>you go in this vicious cycle that never</p><p>ends of trying to restore your</p><p>electrolytes you get crap I noticed that</p><p>when I saw my food I get cramping and</p><p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that if I salt my food I do</p><p>feel better when I consume higher</p><p>potassium things like seaweed and try to</p><p>drink a lot of high mineral water and</p><p>and take potassium or magnesium</p><p>supplementation and some like let&rsquo;s say</p><p>I eat a quarter pound of prosciutto</p><p>because I&rsquo;m Italian you know there are</p><p>some extreme cases of sodium intake</p><p>where there is a benefit to consuming</p><p>high potassium foods and I think</p><p>considering you know there are a lot of</p><p>minerals that are bound to oxalates</p><p>in plant foods and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>inhibition of phytic acid but</p><p>potassium isn&rsquo;t one of those potassium</p><p>citrate in these foods is generally</p><p>highly bioavailable and I think it can</p><p>benefit a lot of people on the carnivore</p><p>diet that are assaulting their food that</p><p>do have electrolyte problems I think</p><p>that&rsquo;s the glaring issue now and and no</p><p>one&rsquo;s going to a very small percentage</p><p>of people are going to be willing to go</p><p>on a very lightly cooked me diet without</p><p>salt you know that is not tasty that is</p><p>not fun to follow that is like it really</p><p>is a chore to do something like that and</p><p>that&rsquo;s really the only way you can kind</p><p>of keep your electrolytes in balance</p><p>some people have and this is really</p><p>anecdotal a lot of people can sort their</p><p>food heavily and they have no problems</p><p>with it I was reading some I think I</p><p>forgot what year it was I think was the</p><p>18 or the 1900s there was a civilization</p><p>in one of the Nordic countries that was</p><p>literally consuming a hundred grams of</p><p>salt per day it&rsquo;s some crazy amount from</p><p>the salted fish they had and they were</p><p>able to tolerate it and someone like me</p><p>if I put a gram or two of salt on my</p><p>food without adequate potassium</p><p>magnesium I&rsquo;m thirsty I&rsquo;m be hydrated</p><p>like crazy so there&rsquo;s a drastic</p><p>difference in people&rsquo;s kidneys ability</p><p>to handle sodium intake and this tizen</p><p>allowed with the carnivore diet and</p><p>whether or not you should be including I</p><p>mean I think seaweeds are great food</p><p>seaweed has a very high amount of</p><p>potassium</p><p>I think seaweed is like 900 milligrams</p><p>of potassium per serving has a decent</p><p>amount of magnesium like 80 milligrams</p><p>of magnesium and the sodium in seaweed</p><p>is fairly low so that there are</p><p>definitely some electrolyte issues on</p><p>the carnivore diet that and and if</p><p>you&rsquo;re consuming a Shaun Baker diet 4 to</p><p>5 pounds of ribeye heavily salted I</p><p>would be surprised if less than half of</p><p>the people had electrolyte imbalance</p><p>problems on that guy</p><p>but to go into the benefits of</p><p>phytonutrients I think if you&rsquo;re looking</p><p>to increase the overall nutrient density</p><p>of your diet beneficial bacteria I</p><p>really think there&rsquo;s a reason that every</p><p>industry group did consume plant foods</p><p>in fairly large amount and the</p><p>Aborigines they consume literally</p><p>thousands of different wild plant foods</p><p>thousands of them and</p><p>one of my primary beliefs of their</p><p>consumption of these plant foods ties</p><p>back into the electrolytes the magnesium</p><p>the potassium and all of those things</p><p>and I mean in regards to specific</p><p>phytonutrient functions it&rsquo;s just so you</p><p>know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so difficult to argue</p><p>against them with all the beneficial</p><p>things that we do see in them I think</p><p>the one thing to just tie back to and</p><p>and my general opinion on plant foods is</p><p>you know what is the plant food you know</p><p>are you buying some mutant Apple the</p><p>size of your head or are you buying like</p><p>you know an organic Fairtrade small Fuji</p><p>apple I think there&rsquo;s something to</p><p>consider when you&rsquo;re buying your plant</p><p>foods whatever plant foods you&rsquo;re</p><p>consuming you know is it a what&rsquo;s that</p><p>boxed wine that college girls drink I</p><p>can&rsquo;t remember this is mad dog 20/20 no</p><p>I don&rsquo;t hold on hold on let me just a</p><p>second something silly Franzia Franzia</p><p>so you know there&rsquo;s a big difference</p><p>between drinking Franzia wine and</p><p>organic biodynamic French wine right I</p><p>think the biggest thing for me for plant</p><p>foods is the food quality really ties in</p><p>here because if you&rsquo;re consuming wild</p><p>blueberries as opposed to mutant</p><p>blueberries the sugar content is going</p><p>to be lower you&rsquo;re going to get more</p><p>nutrients for what you&rsquo;re buying there&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna be a significantly higher</p><p>phytonutrient content in those foods and</p><p>it&rsquo;s more beneficial</p><p>you know it&rsquo;s for me I mean see wheat is</p><p>an excellent example because seaweed is</p><p>a very low caloric density food but it&rsquo;s</p><p>so high in minerals it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s literally</p><p>a I can&rsquo;t really think of a food a plant</p><p>food that I would put as high as seaweed</p><p>for mineral intake it&rsquo;s just - I mean</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s amazing and and same with</p><p>the iodine in it all the elements it&rsquo;s</p><p>it really is an amazing source of</p><p>nutrition and that&rsquo;s the power of high</p><p>quality plant foods it&rsquo;s unfortunate</p><p>that a lot of the plant foods that</p><p>people do go to buy aren&rsquo;t high quality</p><p>but I think you know I did a vegan</p><p>debunking video yesterday and I ended</p><p>the video on the note that we really</p><p>need to support you know local</p><p>sustainable agriculture with our dollar</p><p>and try to spend money on high-quality</p><p>foods you know there&rsquo;s a big difference</p><p>between those vegetables and those</p><p>fruits you buy from the farmers market</p><p>and and what you&rsquo;re getting in a grocery</p><p>store not only that you know the variety</p><p>and not sticking to the same foods and</p><p>you know preparing certain foods raw</p><p>certain foods cooked there there&rsquo;s just</p><p>so much more to to nutrition than anyone</p><p>can really have time to do the research</p><p>for or take the time to understand but</p><p>at the end of the day I always just tie</p><p>back to that what is the original</p><p>quality of the food you know where did</p><p>this fruit or vegetable originate how</p><p>was it grown now is an heirloom variety</p><p>you know if you&rsquo;re eating sourdough</p><p>bread for instance you know einkorn</p><p>wheat is the first week that ever was so</p><p>you know there&rsquo;s a huge difference</p><p>between eating high in corn sourdough</p><p>bread and Wonder Bread that&rsquo;s you - you</p><p>might as well not call one of them bread</p><p>in a way right I always tell people like</p><p>I get all the time like well how do I</p><p>eat on a budget I said well you just</p><p>need to get a better job</p><p>and you seem to get him I hate to break</p><p>it to sorry like when you look at what</p><p>the average I look up statistics for</p><p>this for my budget video the average</p><p>person spends I believe seventy to</p><p>eighty dollars per week in groceries but</p><p>their food expense is like 150 so people</p><p>are going out to eat they&rsquo;re going out</p><p>to drink they&rsquo;re buying $5 Starbucks</p><p>coffee and they&rsquo;re not putting their</p><p>money where it should be so people are</p><p>spending five to six hundred dollars per</p><p>month but people don&rsquo;t feel comfortable</p><p>spending that much money in the grocery</p><p>store but that&rsquo;s what I do I do spend</p><p>you know four or five $600 some months</p><p>on food instead of going out to eat</p><p>some people might spend $200 on a dinner</p><p>on a Friday night and then say oh I</p><p>can&rsquo;t spend money on groceries they do I</p><p>assume Inc you do some in a minute</p><p>fasting yeah I mean I used to fast and I</p><p>do one meal a day and sometimes I</p><p>remember in the year 2017</p><p>I literally fasted for one quarter of</p><p>the time so whether I mean literally</p><p>you know three out of the 12 months of</p><p>the year I wasn&rsquo;t eating and that might</p><p>have been you know one or two days a</p><p>week at times it might have been two</p><p>weeks straight at other times so I did</p><p>incorporate fasting to some degree and</p><p>although I hate to say fasting is a way</p><p>to save money you know it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot of health benefits to it and I just</p><p>don&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s like you could list all</p><p>the benefits of fasting and as soon as</p><p>you bring up oh you could save money</p><p>it&rsquo;s some people&rsquo;s eyes light up they</p><p>really do</p><p>yeah I mean you&rsquo;re dropping</p><p>significantly I mean you&rsquo;re not eating</p><p>six times a day anymore you&rsquo;re not</p><p>snacking on all the expensive little</p><p>protein bars so I think that you you can</p><p>easily just go eat one meal a day and</p><p>increase the quality of food and that&rsquo;s</p><p>your that&rsquo;s your better health insurance</p><p>right there that&rsquo;s what I tell people I</p><p>mean I don&rsquo;t know what else to tell them</p><p>other than I don&rsquo;t have a secret source</p><p>that really cheap healthy food I don&rsquo;t</p><p>it&rsquo;s like the farmers spend a lot of</p><p>energy making these foods and you know</p><p>they don&rsquo;t make a lot of profit so I</p><p>really invest in them as well yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s funny how much I mean you&rsquo;re</p><p>spending three thousand dollars a month</p><p>on health insurance I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not</p><p>really getting your money&rsquo;s worth you</p><p>know it&rsquo;s unfortunate but yeah now</p><p>you&rsquo;re paying for everyone else that&rsquo;s</p><p>just how it is what do you know exactly</p><p>so I just wanted to bring up one point</p><p>about the anti nutrients like phytic</p><p>acid you know cuz I get this a lot</p><p>people say well tanana nutrients gonna</p><p>block absorption of iron and zinc and</p><p>it&rsquo;s gonna create a problem so I wanted</p><p>to get get your take on that because</p><p>there&rsquo;s some more I want to talk about</p><p>on that point yeah it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t think</p><p>anti nutrients are like some issue that</p><p>we should be talking about themselves</p><p>it&rsquo;s more about in the context of what</p><p>diet are you consuming them in because</p><p>if a vegan it it&rsquo;s more in the context</p><p>of a vegan diet if you&rsquo;re on a vegan</p><p>diet not only is your diet deficient in</p><p>key vitamins and minerals you&rsquo;re</p><p>consuming incredibly high amounts of</p><p>these anti nutrients you&rsquo;re consuming</p><p>incredibly high amounts of Antin</p><p>treants on a nutritionally deficient</p><p>diet and you&rsquo;re not preparing this foods</p><p>properly</p><p>certain foods like oats if you look at</p><p>how the Gaelic used to prepare oats they</p><p>would soak them they would ferment them</p><p>they would reduce the phytic acid</p><p>content if you look at the phytic acid</p><p>content of various nuts and seeds you</p><p>know which ones you should be soaking</p><p>you know which ones you shouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>macadamia nuts for instance I love</p><p>macadamia nuts because they have aloe</p><p>phytic acid content if you look at the</p><p>fighting as a content of foods and you</p><p>look at indigenous preparations they&rsquo;re</p><p>supposed to be soaked or prepared in a</p><p>certain way but the biggest issue with</p><p>the anti nutrients is in the context of</p><p>a vegan diet that is high in</p><p>anti-nutrients it&rsquo;s you know if someone</p><p>is consuming and I always like relating</p><p>to Blue Zones because American dieters</p><p>consume 70 percent of their calories</p><p>from plant foods and 30 percent of the</p><p>calories from animal foods Blue Zones</p><p>same exact thing the difference is the</p><p>food quality Blue Zones are technically</p><p>consuming 30% animal foods as well but</p><p>those animal foods are not cheeseburgers</p><p>and hot dogs those animal foods are raw</p><p>milk raw dairy pastured pork wild caught</p><p>fish and if we look at that plant foods</p><p>they&rsquo;re consuming they&rsquo;re not consuming</p><p>Wonder Bread they&rsquo;re not consuming a</p><p>pound of like oxidized almonds they&rsquo;re</p><p>not consuming improperly prepared</p><p>legumes they&rsquo;re still consuming they are</p><p>still consuming traditional foods high</p><p>quality preparations of these foods and</p><p>the food quality is really what ties in</p><p>here are you preparing the food properly</p><p>does it have the original nutrient</p><p>content it&rsquo;s supposed to have do you</p><p>have adequate nutrients from animal</p><p>foods in your diet that&rsquo;s or that those</p><p>are the important questions to answer if</p><p>you want to look at phytic acid itself</p><p>and look at that as a function it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t make nearly as much sense</p><p>without analyzing the overall context of</p><p>the diet yeah those are watching just to</p><p>clarify what that means phytic acid has</p><p>some properties the anti nutrients that</p><p>block certain minerals but it also has</p><p>some anti-cancer properties too you know</p><p>I I know some people won&rsquo;t even look at</p><p>this but if if you look at when I used</p><p>to recommend in practice I would see</p><p>some great ruse</p><p>and if you were to even look on Amazon</p><p>some of the products ip6 that&rsquo;s where</p><p>you&rsquo;d find a version of phytic acid I</p><p>mean there&rsquo;s some quite interesting</p><p>high-level reviews like 85% five-star</p><p>reviews of of seeing changes there</p><p>polyps going away PSA the prostate</p><p>indicator going down my theory behind</p><p>that is phytic acid will bind to excess</p><p>excess phytic acid will bind to excess</p><p>minerals so if you&rsquo;re taking something</p><p>like ip6 I would assume that it&rsquo;s going</p><p>to take if you a lot of people do have</p><p>access calcium and excess iron in the</p><p>digestive tract in the bloodstream so I</p><p>think it definitely ties in there with</p><p>removing the excess minerals yeah that</p><p>would be a very easy explanation behind</p><p>the mechanism about what that does it</p><p>almost mimics fasting in some cases in a</p><p>sense of like making sure your body has</p><p>the minimal amount of nutrients and</p><p>needs right excess yeah and I think that</p><p>you know excess iron is is a problem</p><p>because we don&rsquo;t have a good way of</p><p>getting it out of our system as well and</p><p>especially if people are doing the DES</p><p>fortification of the grains that&rsquo;s the</p><p>wrong iron and you&rsquo;re gonna get you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna raise your iron in as you age it&rsquo;s</p><p>very oxidative it&rsquo;s very creates a lot</p><p>of free radicals and it destroys the</p><p>arteries and the tissues and the even</p><p>can cause cirrhosis of the liver so</p><p>going crazy with specially with iron</p><p>supplements a bad bad idea I was reading</p><p>a study and I believe I cited this study</p><p>in my vegan versus carnivore nutrients</p><p>video that iron metabolism is increased</p><p>dramatically when consumed with fight</p><p>MMA and what we can say is you know</p><p>what&rsquo;s the source of vitamin A and iron</p><p>in nature animal foods so we can safely</p><p>say if we were going to consume iron in</p><p>a natural way outside of supplements</p><p>that it would have been in the presence</p><p>of vitamin A so I think a lot of the</p><p>problems associated with iron is that</p><p>now we&rsquo;re</p><p>as you said in the artificial waste from</p><p>the fortified foods from the supplements</p><p>ways we shouldn&rsquo;t really be getting</p><p>hired exactly</p><p>awesome this has been very very good so</p><p>we touched on a lot of points was there</p><p>anything that we missed so I just took</p><p>some notes beforehand so we did we</p><p>talked about some vitamins we talked</p><p>about vitamin d3 one thing I did want to</p><p>mention was the reason a carnivore diet</p><p>might might work well for a lot of</p><p>people is that they&rsquo;re just efficient in</p><p>the nutrients that are you know b12 fat</p><p>Seibel vitamin deficiencies it&rsquo;s</p><p>definitely worth mentioning that people</p><p>that are consuming a low amount of</p><p>animal foods and have been consuming a</p><p>low amount of animal foods their whole</p><p>lives might actually be deficient in</p><p>vitamin b12 they they could see a lot of</p><p>benefits from consuming more vitamin k2</p><p>more retinoic acid more vitamin d3</p><p>that&rsquo;s definitely worth mentioning and</p><p>the main thing i wanted to mention was</p><p>how inaccurate the food databases are on</p><p>animal foods it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s unfortunate if</p><p>you look at a u.s. database for meat the</p><p>reason the vitamins are low is one</p><p>because it&rsquo;s not a high quality source</p><p>the vitamin A the retinoic acid or the</p><p>vitamin D content in a steak might be</p><p>insignificant if it&rsquo;s grain fed and not</p><p>only that they don&rsquo;t test for a lot of</p><p>the nutrients I use a German database</p><p>it&rsquo;s forgive my German pronunciation</p><p>it&rsquo;s called now word Trek nur de and</p><p>when I look up foods on that database</p><p>they have an extensive nutrient</p><p>breakdown of everything and they test</p><p>for vitamin C they test for vitamin k2</p><p>they test for all the fatty acids they</p><p>test for all the minerals they test for</p><p>all the elements so when people look up</p><p>a piece of liver on chronometer and it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t say that liver has every single</p><p>vitamin and mineral there is it&rsquo;s</p><p>incorrect I think that&rsquo;s just the main</p><p>thing people need to understand is that</p><p>animal foods correlate directly to how</p><p>they were raised if you have up</p><p>conventional feedlot cattle or pig or</p><p>chicken or even eggs the nutrient</p><p>content is not going to be what it</p><p>should be and unfortunately I think</p><p>that&rsquo;s gonna be something that&rsquo;s I mean</p><p>it&rsquo;s gonna continue to be overlooked for</p><p>a long period of time I don&rsquo;t think I</p><p>mean if you look up I actually got</p><p>quotes from laboratories on what</p><p>nutrient testing costed and and that was</p><p>like well that makes sense because just</p><p>getting vitamin k2 tested in a food is</p><p>like $350 oh my gosh</p><p>just getting vitamin d3 tested is $350</p><p>if you wanted to get all the fat side</p><p>with vitamins tested in one food it&rsquo;s</p><p>about $1,500 and that&rsquo;s not including</p><p>all the fatty acids that&rsquo;s not including</p><p>all the minerals that&rsquo;s not including</p><p>all the vitamins if you want a full</p><p>nutrient analysis of what that German</p><p>website did in the United States labs at</p><p>least I&rsquo;m sure the United States</p><p>laboratories are gouging me it would</p><p>probably cost you four to five thousand</p><p>dollars per food so let&rsquo;s say you had a</p><p>food you wanted to test like raw butter</p><p>not only would you want to test multiple</p><p>versions of butter you might want to</p><p>test versions of butter from different</p><p>farms but just for one food for just</p><p>variability you&rsquo;d have to test one food</p><p>three or four different times it just</p><p>gets I think this data would be</p><p>excellent to have but at the end of the</p><p>day we could just use assumptions pretty</p><p>much to say you know what tissues and</p><p>what parts of the animal do have these</p><p>nutrients well I just want to touch on</p><p>that cuz that&rsquo;s a really valid point</p><p>because people don&rsquo;t even look at the</p><p>quality of food I did so one of the one</p><p>of these products that I use is raw</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder that I get from</p><p>Utah and I would go out to the farm</p><p>where they grow this stuff so it&rsquo;s grown</p><p>on an ancient seabed and the quality is</p><p>just working over the top and they&rsquo;re</p><p>taking this this grass and then they&rsquo;re</p><p>converting it into a powder within like</p><p>a very short period of time so under low</p><p>heat snuffing over 106 degrees so what I</p><p>wanted to do is I wanted to run the labs</p><p>on that it was it was four thousand</p><p>dollars just to run the basic nutrient</p><p>profiles right and I also compared it to</p><p>the top - you can say competitors</p><p>people that are also selling a very</p><p>similar product the Greenes products</p><p>just to see the difference and I posted</p><p>on my um my website but what I found was</p><p>there&rsquo;s b12 in there I&rsquo;m like what</p><p>there&rsquo;s no green I mean can&rsquo;t get b12</p><p>from from greens or it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s</p><p>impossible basically was growing within</p><p>the the flora the bacteria of the of the</p><p>grass</p><p>yeah well the soils are so depleted now</p><p>that nutrients are so insignificant in a</p><p>lot of cases and in the front the farmer</p><p>that was growing this he was on the edge</p><p>about sterilizing his product because he</p><p>didn&rsquo;t want to have like eco Lance&rsquo;s no</p><p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get you eaten coli</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna get that with a very</p><p>unhealthy farm so you want to preserve</p><p>all these these friendly microbes within</p><p>the plant so that was interesting but</p><p>the fight out that the carotenoids were</p><p>off the chart compared these other other</p><p>brands so the source of where you get</p><p>this stuff is like that is the key right</p><p>there it&rsquo;s yeah it makes you really</p><p>start to question because if you have a</p><p>product like that that pretty much</p><p>replicates what a wild version of a food</p><p>is it&rsquo;s really difficult when you go</p><p>into the supermarket you&rsquo;re thinking to</p><p>yourself was that really grown in ideal</p><p>circumstances and and this really comes</p><p>with experience and culinary knowledge</p><p>and understand experiencing a lot of</p><p>different foods but once you&rsquo;ve tasted a</p><p>dozen different I remember a couple</p><p>years ago I went to all the supermarkets</p><p>in the area and bought every blueberry I</p><p>could get my hands on and I compared 15</p><p>different blueberries and if you do</p><p>something like that you will understand</p><p>you know what dictates the quality of</p><p>the blueberry how does one taste does</p><p>the and I think a really good way to</p><p>understand this is if anyone&rsquo;s ever</p><p>messed around with mineral powders if</p><p>you put sodium potassium magnesium and</p><p>calcium in water generally depending on</p><p>the proportions one will taste</p><p>predominantly more than the other but if</p><p>the minerals are in proper proportions</p><p>in the water it will taste good and</p><p>that&rsquo;s a good explanation behind why you</p><p>know certain beef might taste better</p><p>than other beef</p><p>and I personally I detest the flavor of</p><p>lamb I really don&rsquo;t like lamb but if you</p><p>put a lamb chop in front of me next to</p><p>most</p><p>beef ribeye steaks the lamb actually</p><p>tastes better and I think the nutrient</p><p>density of the food</p><p>I think the mineral content the vitamin</p><p>content you can literally taste those in</p><p>the food and especially in the case of</p><p>beef fat and things like that it will</p><p>literally tastes nutty and sweet and</p><p>more complex so I think our senses</p><p>colors taste can really help us dictate</p><p>the quality of a lot of these foods</p><p>absolutely awesome well thanks for the</p><p>time that you spent doing this this is</p><p>really really awesome I uh I know you&rsquo;re</p><p>probably busy preparing for your next</p><p>videos unfortunately a lot of work it</p><p>really is but thanks and I&rsquo;ll talk to</p><p>you soon hey know this is what I&rsquo;m</p><p>looking forward to seeing the response</p><p>man okay great</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
