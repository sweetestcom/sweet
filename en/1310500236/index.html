    <p>The following is a conversation with Brian Greene,</p>
<p>theoretical physicist at Columbia</p>
<p>and author of many amazing books on physics,</p>
<p>including his latest, Until the End of Time,</p>
<p>Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning</p>
<p>in an Evolving Universe.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Brian Greene.</p>
<p>In your most recent book, Until the End of Time,</p>
<p>you quote Bertrand Russell from a debate he had</p>
<p>about God in 1948.</p>
<p>He says, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So far as scientific evidence goes,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;the universe has crawled by slow stages</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;to a somewhat pitiful result on this earth,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;and is going to crawl by still more pitiful stages</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;to a condition of universal death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If this is to be taken as evidence of purpose,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can only say that the purpose is one</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;that does not appeal to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see no reason, therefore,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;to believe in any sort of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a depressing statement.</p>
<p>As you say, this is a bleak outlook on our universe</p>
<p>and the emergence of human consciousness.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what is the more hopeful perspective</p>
<p>to take on this story?</p>
<p>Well, I think the more hopeful perspective</p>
<p>is to more fully understand</p>
<p>what was driving Bertrand Russell to this perspective,</p>
<p>and then to see it within a broader context.</p>
<p>And really, that&rsquo;s, in some sense,</p>
<p>what my book, Until the End of Time, is all about.</p>
<p>But in brief, I would say that there&rsquo;s a lot of truth</p>
<p>to what Bertrand Russell was saying there.</p>
<p>When you look at the second law of thermodynamics,</p>
<p>which is the underlying scientific idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving this notion that everything&rsquo;s gonna wither,</p>
<p>decay, fall apart, yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Second law of thermodynamics establishes</p>
<p>that disorder, entropy, in aggregate,</p>
<p>is always on the rise.</p>
<p>And that is indeed interpretable</p>
<p>as disintegration and destruction</p>
<p>over sufficiently long timescales.</p>
<p>But my view is, when you recognize</p>
<p>how special that makes us,</p>
<p>that we are these exquisitely ordered configurations</p>
<p>of particles that only will last for a blink of an eye</p>
<p>in cosmological time like terms,</p>
<p>the fact that we&rsquo;re here and we can do what we do,</p>
<p>to me, that&rsquo;s just really something</p>
<p>that inspires gratitude and wonder</p>
<p>and a sense of deep purpose</p>
<p>by virtue of being these unique collections of entities</p>
<p>that happen to rise up, look around,</p>
<p>and try to figure out where we are</p>
<p>and what the heck we should do with our time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that I would disagree with Bertrand Russell</p>
<p>in terms of the basic physics and the basic unfolding,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s really a matter of the slant</p>
<p>that you take on what it means for us.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ll skip around a bit,</p>
<p>but let me ask the biggest possible question then.</p>
<p>You said purpose.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the meaning of it all then?</p>
<p>Is there a meaning to life that we can take from this,</p>
<p>from this brief emergence of complexity</p>
<p>that arises from simple things</p>
<p>and then goes into a heat death</p>
<p>that is once again returns to simple things</p>
<p>as the march of the second law of thermodynamics goes on?</p>
<p>I think there is,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a universal answer.</p>
<p>And so I think throughout the ages,</p>
<p>there has been a kind of quest for some final way</p>
<p>of articulating meaning and purpose,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s God, whether it&rsquo;s love,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s companionship.</p>
<p>I mean, many people put forward different ways</p>
<p>of taking this question on,</p>
<p>and there is no one right answer</p>
<p>when you recognize deeply that the universe doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>There is nothing out there that is the final answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as though we need a more powerful telescope</p>
<p>and somehow if we can look deeply into the universe,</p>
<p>all will become clear.</p>
<p>In fact, the deeper we&rsquo;ve looked,</p>
<p>both literally and metaphorically,</p>
<p>into the universe and into the structure of reality,</p>
<p>the more it&rsquo;s become clear</p>
<p>that we are just a momentary byproduct</p>
<p>of laws of physics that don&rsquo;t have any emotional content.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any intrinsic sense of meaning or purpose.</p>
<p>And when you recognize that,</p>
<p>you realize that searching for the universal</p>
<p>for this kind of a question is a fool&rsquo;s errand.</p>
<p>Every individual has the capacity to make their own meaning,</p>
<p>to set their own purpose.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not some platitude, that is what we are.</p>
<p>Because there is no fundamental answer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what you make of it.</p>
<p>And however much that may sound like a hallmark card,</p>
<p>this really is the deep lesson of physics and science</p>
<p>more generally over the past few hundred years.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s some level where you can objectively say</p>
<p>that whatever we&rsquo;ve got going on here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of peculiar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of special in terms of complexity.</p>
<p>And maybe you can even begin to measure it</p>
<p>and like come up with metrics</p>
<p>where whatever we&rsquo;ve got going on on Earth,</p>
<p>these like interesting hierarchical complexities</p>
<p>that form more and more sophisticated biological system,</p>
<p>that seems kind of unique</p>
<p>when you look at the entire universe,</p>
<p>the observable part that we can see with our tools.</p>
<p>I mean, so I have to ask,</p>
<p>as you describe in your book once again,</p>
<p>Schrodinger wrote the book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is Life?&rsquo; based on a few lectures he gave in 1944.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So let me ask the fundamental question here.</p>
<p>What is life?</p>
<p>This particular thing we&rsquo;ve got going on here,</p>
<p>this pocket of complexity</p>
<p>that emerged from such simple things?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>I asked that question even to Richard Dawkins once,</p>
<p>and I already have my preconceived notion,</p>
<p>which he pretty much confirmed,</p>
<p>which is if one could give an answer to that question</p>
<p>that allowed you to sort of draw a line in the sand</p>
<p>between the not living and the living,</p>
<p>then perhaps we would have the insight that we yearn for</p>
<p>and trying to say, what is so special about life?</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is, it&rsquo;s a continuum.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a continuum from the things</p>
<p>that we would typically call nonliving and animate</p>
<p>to the things that we obviously call animate</p>
<p>and full of the currents of life.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there,</p>
<p>it is a question of the complexity of the structure,</p>
<p>the ability of the structure to take in raw material</p>
<p>from the environment and process it through a metabolism</p>
<p>that allows the structure to extract energy</p>
<p>and to release entropy to the wider environment.</p>
<p>Somewhere in those collections of biological processes</p>
<p>is the necessity or the necessary ingredients</p>
<p>and processes for life,</p>
<p>but drawing that line in the sand</p>
<p>is not something that we&rsquo;re able to do,</p>
<p>but I would agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deeply peculiar.</p>
<p>It may in fact be unique,</p>
<p>but it may not.</p>
<p>It could be that the universe is such</p>
<p>that under fairly typical conditions,</p>
<p>a star that&rsquo;s a well ordered source of low entropy energy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the sun is,</p>
<p>together with a planet being bathed</p>
<p>by that low entropy energy,</p>
<p>together with a surface that has enough</p>
<p>of the raw constituents that we recognize</p>
<p>are fairly commonplace result of supernova explosions</p>
<p>where a star spews forth the result of the nuclear furnace</p>
<p>that is the core of a star.</p>
<p>It could be that all you need</p>
<p>are those fairly commonplace conditions</p>
<p>and maybe life naturally forms.</p>
<p>Look, the James Webb Space Telescope, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going up hopefully in December.</p>
<p>And one of the goals of that mission</p>
<p>is to look at atmospheres around distant planets</p>
<p>and perhaps come to some sense of how special</p>
<p>or not life or life as we know it is in the universe.</p>
<p>Which part of the story of life,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stick to Earth for a second,</p>
<p>do you think is the hardest?</p>
<p>If you were like a betting man,</p>
<p>which part is the hardest to make happen?</p>
<p>Is it the origin of life?</p>
<p>Again, we haven&rsquo;t drawn the line where,</p>
<p>as you say, the line between a rock and a rabbit.</p>
<p>That part, is it complex organisms,</p>
<p>like multicellular organisms?</p>
<p>Is it crawling out of the ocean</p>
<p>where the fish somehow figured out how to crawl around?</p>
<p>Is it then the us homo sapiens,</p>
<p>as we like to think of ourselves special and intelligent?</p>
<p>Or is it somewhere in between?</p>
<p>As you also talk about, again, very hard to know</p>
<p>at which point this consciousness emerge.</p>
<p>If you were to sort of took us a survey</p>
<p>and made bets about other Earth like planets in the universe,</p>
<p>where do you think they get stuck the most?</p>
<p>Well, I would certainly say if we&rsquo;re gonna go all the way</p>
<p>to conscious beings like ourselves,</p>
<p>I would put it at the onset of consciousness,</p>
<p>which again, I think is a continuum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is something that you can draw the line</p>
<p>in the sand, but there are obvious circumstances,</p>
<p>there are obvious creatures such as ourselves</p>
<p>where we do recognize a certain kind</p>
<p>of self reflective conscious awareness.</p>
<p>And if we think about what it would require</p>
<p>for a system of living beings to acquire consciousness,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the hardest part because look,</p>
<p>take Earth and recognize that weren&rsquo;t for,</p>
<p>some singular event 65 million years ago</p>
<p>where this large rock slams into planet Earth</p>
<p>and wipes out the dinosaurs,</p>
<p>maybe the dinosaurs would still rule the planet</p>
<p>and they may well have not developed</p>
<p>the kind of conscious awareness that we have.</p>
<p>So for billions of years on this planet,</p>
<p>there was life that didn&rsquo;t have the kind</p>
<p>of conscious awareness that we have.</p>
<p>And it was an accidental event in astrophysical history</p>
<p>that allowed a mammalian species like us</p>
<p>to ultimately be the end product.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I could imagine there&rsquo;s a lot of life</p>
<p>out there, but perhaps none of it&rsquo;s wondering</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the meaning of life or trying to make sense of it,</p>
<p>just going about its business of survival,</p>
<p>which of course is the dominant activity</p>
<p>that life on this planet has practiced.</p>
<p>We are a rare exception to that.</p>
<p>And I really appreciate that you lean into</p>
<p>some of these unanswerable questions from me today.</p>
<p>But the, so you think about consciousness,</p>
<p>not as like a phase shift, the binary zero one,</p>
<p>you think of it as a continuum that humans somehow</p>
<p>are maybe some of the most conscious beings on Earth.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, so.</p>
<p>I mean, people will dispute that.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, well, and it&rsquo;s a very hard argument.</p>
<p>People will dispute that, rocks probably</p>
<p>will stay quiet on the matter.</p>
<p>Maybe not, right?</p>
<p>For the moment, they&rsquo;re waiting for their opportunity.</p>
<p>But I agree that, look, even when you and I</p>
<p>look at each other, I am not fully convinced</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a conscious being, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that you are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to me.</p>
<p>I mean, your behavior is such that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best explanation for what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But of course, we&rsquo;re all in the position</p>
<p>of only having direct awareness of our own conscious being.</p>
<p>And therefore, when it comes to other creatures in the world,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a similar state of ignorance</p>
<p>regarding what&rsquo;s actually happening inside of their head,</p>
<p>if they have a head.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s hard to know how singular we are,</p>
<p>but I would say based on the best available data</p>
<p>and the best explanations that we can make,</p>
<p>yeah, there is something special about us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there are fish walking around</p>
<p>and coming up with existentialism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there are dogs walking around</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve developed an understanding</p>
<p>of the general theory of relativity.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe we&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>but that seems the best explanation.</p>
<p>What do you think is more special,</p>
<p>intelligence or consciousness?</p>
<p>I think consciousness.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a deep connection</p>
<p>between these ideas.</p>
<p>They are distinct, but they&rsquo;re deeply connected.</p>
<p>But look, I mean, to me and to, of course, many philosophers</p>
<p>who actually coined a name for this,</p>
<p>the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>David Chalmers and others,</p>
<p>as a physicist, I look out at the world</p>
<p>and I see it&rsquo;s particles governed by physical law.</p>
<p>We can name them.</p>
<p>We got electrons, we got quarks</p>
<p>that come in various flavors and so forth.</p>
<p>We have a list of ingredients that science has revealed</p>
<p>and we have a list of laws that seemingly</p>
<p>govern those ingredients.</p>
<p>And nowhere in there is there even a hint</p>
<p>that when you put those particles together in the right way,</p>
<p>an inner world should turn on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only that there&rsquo;s no hint, it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>How could it be that a thoughtless,</p>
<p>passionless, emotionless particle,</p>
<p>when grouped together with compatriots,</p>
<p>somehow can yield something so deeply foreign</p>
<p>to the nature of the ingredients themselves?</p>
<p>So answering that question,</p>
<p>I think is among the deepest</p>
<p>and most difficult questions that we face.</p>
<p>Do you think it is in fact a really hard problem?</p>
<p>Or is it possible, I think you mentioned in your book,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just like almost like a side effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an emergent thing that&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a nice little feature.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, when people use the phrase hard problem,</p>
<p>I mean, they mean in a somewhat technical sense</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s trying to explain something</p>
<p>that seems fundamentally unavailable</p>
<p>to third party objective analysis, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only one that can get inside my head</p>
<p>and I can tell you a lot about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>inside my head right now, it&rsquo;s reflected</p>
<p>in what I&rsquo;m saying, and you can try to deduce things</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on inside my head,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have access to it in the way that I do.</p>
<p>And so it seems like a fundamentally different</p>
<p>kind of problem from the ones that we have successfully</p>
<p>dealt with over the course of centuries in science,</p>
<p>where we look at the motion of the moon,</p>
<p>everybody can look, everybody can measure it.</p>
<p>We look at the properties of hydrogen</p>
<p>when you shine lasers on it,</p>
<p>everybody can look at the data and understand it.</p>
<p>And so it seems like a fundamentally different problem</p>
<p>in that sense, it seems like it is hard</p>
<p>relative to the others, but I do think ultimately</p>
<p>that the explanation will be, as you recount,</p>
<p>I think that a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s a thousand, it&rsquo;s hard to predict</p>
<p>the timescale for developments,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;ll get to a place where we&rsquo;ll look back</p>
<p>and kind of smile at those folks in the 20th century</p>
<p>and before, 21st century and before,</p>
<p>who thought consciousness was so incredibly mysterious</p>
<p>when the reality of it is, eh, it&rsquo;s just a thing that happens</p>
<p>when particles come together.</p>
<p>And however mysterious that feels right now,</p>
<p>I think for instance, when we start to build</p>
<p>conscious systems, things that you&rsquo;re more familiar with</p>
<p>than I am, when we start to build these artificial systems</p>
<p>and those systems report to us, I&rsquo;m feeling sad,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling anxious, yeah, there&rsquo;s a world going on</p>
<p>inside here, I think the mystery of consciousness</p>
<p>will just begin to evaporate.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, first of all, beautifully put,</p>
<p>and I agree with you completely,</p>
<p>just the way you said it, it&rsquo;ll begin to evaporate.</p>
<p>I have built quite a few robots</p>
<p>and have had them do emotion, emotional type things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s immediate that exactly what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>this kind of mystery of consciousness starts to evaporate,</p>
<p>that the kind of need to truly understand,</p>
<p>to solve the hard problem of consciousness disappears,</p>
<p>because, well, I don&rsquo;t really care if I understand</p>
<p>what can solve the hard problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>That thing sure as heck looks conscious.</p>
<p>I feel like that way when I interact with a dog.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to solve the problem of consciousness</p>
<p>to be able to interact and richly enjoy the experience</p>
<p>with this other living being.</p>
<p>Obviously, same thing with other humans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to fully understand it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some aspect, maybe this is a little bit</p>
<p>too engineering focused, but there&rsquo;s some aspect</p>
<p>in which it feels like consciousness is just a nice trick</p>
<p>to help us communicate with each other.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous to say, but sort of the ability</p>
<p>to experience the world is very useful,</p>
<p>in a subjective sense, is very useful to put yourself</p>
<p>in that world and to be able to describe the experience</p>
<p>to others.</p>
<p>It could be just a social and the merge.</p>
<p>Obviously, animals, the sort of more primitive animals</p>
<p>might experience consciousness in some more primitive way,</p>
<p>but this kind of rich, subjective experience</p>
<p>that we think about as humans, I think it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>deeply coupled with language and poetry.</p>
<p>Yeah, that resonates with my view as well.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a scientist, maybe you&rsquo;ve spoken to him,</p>
<p>Michael Graziano from Princeton.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s developed ideas of consciousness that,</p>
<p>look, I don&rsquo;t think they solve the problem,</p>
<p>but I think they do illuminate it in an interesting way</p>
<p>where basically we are not aware</p>
<p>of all the underlying physiochemical processes</p>
<p>that make our brains and our inner worlds</p>
<p>tick the way they do.</p>
<p>And because of that dissociation between sensation</p>
<p>and the physics of it and the chemistry of it</p>
<p>and the biology of it, it feels like our minds</p>
<p>and our inner worlds are just untethered,</p>
<p>like floating somewhere in this gray matter</p>
<p>inside of our heads.</p>
<p>And the way I like to think of it is like,</p>
<p>look, if you were in a dark room, right,</p>
<p>and I had glow in the dark paint on my fingers,</p>
<p>so all you saw was my fingers dancing around,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be something mysterious.</p>
<p>How could those fingers be doing that?</p>
<p>And then you turn on the light, you realize,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s this arm underlying it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the deep physical connection explains it all.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re missing,</p>
<p>the deep physical connection between what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>up here and what is responsible for it</p>
<p>in a physical, chemical, biological way.</p>
<p>And so to me, that at least gives me some understanding</p>
<p>of why consciousness feels so mysterious</p>
<p>because we are suppressing all of the underlying science</p>
<p>that ultimately is responsible for it.</p>
<p>And one day we will reveal that more fully,</p>
<p>and I think that will help us tether this experience</p>
<p>to something quite tangible in the world.</p>
<p>I wonder if the mystery is an important component</p>
<p>of enjoying something.</p>
<p>So once we know how this thing works,</p>
<p>maybe we will no longer enjoy this conversation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll seek other sources of enjoyment,</p>
<p>but this is, again, from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>I wonder if the mystery is an important component.</p>
<p>Well, have you ever seen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this beautiful interview</p>
<p>that Richard Feynman did,</p>
<p>great Nobel laureate physicist responsible</p>
<p>for a lot of our understanding of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>quantum field theory and so forth.</p>
<p>And he was in a conversation with an interviewer</p>
<p>where he noted that some people feel</p>
<p>like once the mystery is gone,</p>
<p>once science explains something,</p>
<p>the beauty goes away, the wonder of it goes away.</p>
<p>And he was emphasizing in his response to that,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, no, that&rsquo;s not the right way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>He says, look, when I look at a rose,</p>
<p>he says, yeah, I can still deeply enjoy the aroma,</p>
<p>the color, the texture.</p>
<p>He says, but what I can do that you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not a physicist,</p>
<p>I can look more deeply and understand</p>
<p>where the red comes from, where the aroma comes from,</p>
<p>where the structure comes from.</p>
<p>He says, that only augments my wonder.</p>
<p>It only augments my experience.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t flatten it or take away from it.</p>
<p>So I sort of take that as a bit of a motto in some sense</p>
<p>that there is a wonder that comes from a kind of ignorance.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean that in a derogatory sense,</p>
<p>but just from not knowing.</p>
<p>So there is a wonder that comes from mystery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another kind of wonder that comes from knowing</p>
<p>and deep knowing.</p>
<p>And I think that kind of wonder has its own</p>
<p>special character that in some ways can be more gratifying.</p>
<p>I hope he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, I remember he said something</p>
<p>about like science is an onion or something like that.</p>
<p>You can peel back, you can keep peeling back.</p>
<p>I mean, there is also, when you understand something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a sense that there&rsquo;s more mystery</p>
<p>to understand.</p>
<p>Like you never get to the bottom of the mystery.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also different than,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t think you can analogize say</p>
<p>to a magician, right?</p>
<p>A magician does some trick.</p>
<p>You learn how it sounds like, oh my God,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous when you find.</p>
<p>But nature is perhaps the best magician</p>
<p>if you wanna try to make the analogy there</p>
<p>because when you peel things back and you understand</p>
<p>how it is that things have color and you have electrons,</p>
<p>dancing from one orbital to another,</p>
<p>emitting photons at very particular wavelengths</p>
<p>that are described by these beautiful equations</p>
<p>of quantum electrodynamics,</p>
<p>part of which that Feynman developed,</p>
<p>it gives you a greater sense of awe</p>
<p>when the curtain is pulled back</p>
<p>than what happens in other circumstances</p>
<p>where it does flatten it completely.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very possible then say in physics</p>
<p>that we arrive at a theory of everything</p>
<p>that unifies the laws of physics</p>
<p>and has a very strong understanding</p>
<p>of the fabric of reality,</p>
<p>even like from the big bang to today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that that understanding</p>
<p>is only going to elevate our appreciation</p>
<p>of this whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it will.</p>
<p>I think it will.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it has so far.</p>
<p>But the other side of it which you emphasize</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not like science somehow reaches an end, right?</p>
<p>There are certain categories of questions</p>
<p>that do reach an end.</p>
<p>I think we one day will close the book</p>
<p>on nature&rsquo;s ingredients and the fundamental laws.</p>
<p>Now that we can&rsquo;t prove that,</p>
<p>maybe it goes on forever, smaller and smaller,</p>
<p>maybe there are deeper and deeper laws,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s going to be a collection</p>
<p>of ingredients and a collection of basic laws.</p>
<p>That chapter will close, but it&rsquo;s one chapter.</p>
<p>Now we take that knowledge and we try to understand</p>
<p>how the world builds the structures that it does,</p>
<p>from planets to people to black holes</p>
<p>to the possibility of other universes</p>
<p>and every step of the way,</p>
<p>the collection of questions</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know the answer to only blossoms.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a deep sense of gratification</p>
<p>from understanding certain qualities of the world.</p>
<p>But I would say that if you take a ratio</p>
<p>of what we understand to the things that we know</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t yet understand,</p>
<p>that ratio keeps getting smaller and smaller</p>
<p>because the things that we know that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>grows larger and larger.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope that we solve that theory</p>
<p>of everything puzzle in the next few decades?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been a bunch of attempts from string theory</p>
<p>to all kinds of attempts at trying to solve quantum gravity</p>
<p>or basically come up with a theory for quantum gravity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of complexities to this.</p>
<p>One, for experimental validation,</p>
<p>you have to observe effects</p>
<p>that are very difficult to measure.</p>
<p>So you have to build,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like an engineering challenge.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the theory challenge,</p>
<p>which is like, it seems very difficult</p>
<p>to connect the laws of gravity to quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope or are we hopelessly stuck?</p>
<p>Well, I have to have to have a hope.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s in some sense,</p>
<p>but I devote at least part of my professional life toward</p>
<p>trying to make progress on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad you used the phrase quantum gravity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a great fan of the theory of everything phrase</p>
<p>because it does make other scientists feel like</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not working on this, what are they working on?</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s not much left</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about theory of everything.</p>
<p>Biology is just small details we&rsquo;ll figure out.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it is really trying to put gravity</p>
<p>and quantum mechanics together.</p>
<p>And since I was a college kid,</p>
<p>I was deeply fascinated with gravity.</p>
<p>And as I learned quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>the notion of physicists being stumped</p>
<p>and trying to blend them together,</p>
<p>how could one not get fired up</p>
<p>about maybe contributing something to that journey?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been on this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on this for 30 years since I was a student.</p>
<p>We have made progress.</p>
<p>We do have ideas.</p>
<p>You mentioned string theory is one possible scenario.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stuck.</p>
<p>String theory is a vibrant field of research</p>
<p>that is making incredible progress,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve not made progress</p>
<p>on this issue of experimental verification validation,</p>
<p>which is, you know, it is a vital part of the story.</p>
<p>So I would have hoped that by now</p>
<p>we would have made contact with observation.</p>
<p>If you would have interviewed me back in the 80s</p>
<p>when I was, you know, a wild bright eyed kid</p>
<p>trying to make headway working 18 hours a day</p>
<p>and this sort of stuff,</p>
<p>I would have said, yeah, by 2021,</p>
<p>yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna know whether it&rsquo;s right or wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have made contact.</p>
<p>I would have said, look,</p>
<p>there may be certain mathematical puzzles</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve yet to work out,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll know enough to make contact with experiment.</p>
<p>That has not happened.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>if you would have interviewed me back then and asked me,</p>
<p>will we be able to talk about detailed qualities</p>
<p>of black holes and understand them at the level of detail</p>
<p>that we actually, I would have said,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re gonna be able to do that.</p>
<p>Will we have an exact formulation of string theory</p>
<p>in certain circumstances?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna have that, and yet we do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just to say,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know where the progress is going to happen,</p>
<p>but yes, I do hold out hope</p>
<p>that maybe before I move on to wherever,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is an after,</p>
<p>but I would love before I leave this earth</p>
<p>to know the answer, but science and the universe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about pleasing any individual, it is what it is.</p>
<p>And so we just press onward and we&rsquo;ll see where it goes.</p>
<p>So in terms of string theory,</p>
<p>if I just look from an authoritative perspective currently</p>
<p>at the theoretical physics community,</p>
<p>string theory as a theory has been very popular</p>
<p>for a few decades, but has recently fallen out of favor,</p>
<p>or at least there&rsquo;s been like, you know,</p>
<p>it became more popular to kind of ask the question,</p>
<p>is string theory really the answer?</p>
<p>Where do you fall on this?</p>
<p>Like, how do you make sense of this puzzle?</p>
<p>Why do you think it&rsquo;s fallen out of favor?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I would actually challenge the statement</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s fallen out of favor.</p>
<p>I would say that any field of research when it&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the bright, shiny bicycle</p>
<p>that no one has yet seen on that block,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna attract attention</p>
<p>and the news outlets are gonna cover it</p>
<p>and students are gonna flock to it, sure.</p>
<p>But as a field matures, it does shed those qualities</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s no longer as novel as it was</p>
<p>when it was first introduced 30, 40 years ago,</p>
<p>but you need to judge it by a different standard.</p>
<p>You need to judge it by is it making progress</p>
<p>on foundational issues deepening our understanding</p>
<p>of the subject and by that measure,</p>
<p>string theory is scoring very high.</p>
<p>Now, at the same time, you also need to judge</p>
<p>whether it makes contact with experiment</p>
<p>as we discussed before too</p>
<p>and in that measure, we&rsquo;re still challenged.</p>
<p>So I would say that many string theorists,</p>
<p>myself included, are very sober about the theory.</p>
<p>It has the tremendous progress that it had 30, 40 years ago</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t gone away, but we become better equipped</p>
<p>at assessing the long journey ahead</p>
<p>and that was something that we weren&rsquo;t particularly good at</p>
<p>back, say, in the 80s.</p>
<p>Look, when I was just starting out in the field,</p>
<p>there was a sense of physics is about to end.</p>
<p>String theory is about to be the be all and end all</p>
<p>final unified theory and that will bring this chapter</p>
<p>to a close.</p>
<p>Now, I have to say, I think it was more the younger</p>
<p>physicists who were saying that.</p>
<p>Some of them were seasoned,</p>
<p>even if they were pro string theory at the time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they were rolling their eyes,</p>
<p>but they knew that it was gonna be a long, long journey.</p>
<p>I think people like John Schwartz,</p>
<p>one of the founders of string theory,</p>
<p>Michael Green, no relation to me,</p>
<p>founders of the theory, Edward Witten,</p>
<p>one of the main people driving the theory</p>
<p>back then and today.</p>
<p>I think they knew that we were in for a long haul</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the nature of science,</p>
<p>quick hits that resolve everything few and far between.</p>
<p>And so if you were in for the quick solution</p>
<p>to the big questions of the world,</p>
<p>then you would have been disappointed</p>
<p>and I think there were people who were disappointed</p>
<p>and moved on and work on other subjects.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in in the way that Einstein was in</p>
<p>for a lifetime of investigation to try to see</p>
<p>what the answers to the deep questions would be,</p>
<p>then I think string theory has been a rich source</p>
<p>of material that has kept so many people deeply engaged</p>
<p>in moving the frontier forward.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few qualities about string theory,</p>
<p>which are weird.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of physics is just weird and beautiful.</p>
<p>So let me ask the question,</p>
<p>what do you use most beautiful about string theory?</p>
<p>Well, what attracted me to the theory at the outset</p>
<p>beyond it&rsquo;s putting gravity and quantum mechanics together,</p>
<p>which I think is its true claim to fame,</p>
<p>at least on paper, it&rsquo;s able to do that.</p>
<p>What attracted me to the theory was the fact</p>
<p>that it requires extra dimensions of space.</p>
<p>And this was an idea that intrigued me in a very deep way,</p>
<p>even before I really understood what it meant.</p>
<p>I somehow had, I mean, talk about sort of</p>
<p>the emotional part of consciousness and the cognitive part</p>
<p>in some, perhaps you call it strange,</p>
<p>in some strange emotional way,</p>
<p>I was enamored with Einstein&rsquo;s general relativity,</p>
<p>the idea of curved space and time</p>
<p>before I really knew what it meant.</p>
<p>It just spoke to me, I don&rsquo;t know how else to say it.</p>
<p>And then when I subsequently learned</p>
<p>that people had thought about more dimensions of space</p>
<p>than we can see and how those extra dimensions</p>
<p>would be vital to a deep understanding</p>
<p>of the things that we do see in this world,</p>
<p>four, five, six dimensions might explain</p>
<p>why there are certain forces and particles</p>
<p>and how they behave.</p>
<p>To me, this was like amazing, utterly amazing.</p>
<p>And then when I learned that string theory</p>
<p>embraced all these ideas,</p>
<p>embraced the general theory of relativity,</p>
<p>embraced quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>embraced the possibility of extra dimensions,</p>
<p>then I was hooked.</p>
<p>And so when I was a graduate student,</p>
<p>we would just spend hours,</p>
<p>we, I mean, a couple of other graduate students and myself</p>
<p>who had sort of worked really well together,</p>
<p>it was at Oxford in England,</p>
<p>we would work these enormous numbers of hours a day</p>
<p>trying to understand the shapes of these extra dimensions,</p>
<p>the geometry of them, what those geometrical shapes</p>
<p>for the extra dimensions would imply</p>
<p>for things that we see in the world around us.</p>
<p>And it was a heady, heady time.</p>
<p>And that kind of excitement has sort of filtered through</p>
<p>over the decades.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s really the part of the theory</p>
<p>that I think really hooked me most strongly.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to think about those extra dimensions?</p>
<p>I was supposed to imagine actual physical reality</p>
<p>or is this more in the space of mathematics</p>
<p>that allows you to sort of come up with tricks</p>
<p>to describe the four dimensional reality</p>
<p>that we more directly perceive?</p>
<p>No one really knows the answer, of course,</p>
<p>but if I take the most straightforward approach</p>
<p>to string theory,</p>
<p>you really are imagining that these dimensions are there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re real.</p>
<p>I mean, just as you would say</p>
<p>that the three space dimensions around us,</p>
<p>left, right, back, forth, up, down,</p>
<p>yeah, they&rsquo;re real, they&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>We are immersed within those dimensions.</p>
<p>These other dimensions are as real as these</p>
<p>with the one difference being their shape and their size</p>
<p>differs from the shape and size of the dimensions</p>
<p>that we have direct access to through human experience.</p>
<p>And one approach imagines that these extra dimensions</p>
<p>are tightly coiled up, curled up,</p>
<p>crushed together, if you will,</p>
<p>into a beautiful geometrical form</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all around us,</p>
<p>but just too small for us to detect with our eyes,</p>
<p>too small for us to detect</p>
<p>even with the most powerful equipment that we have.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, according to the mathematics,</p>
<p>the size and the shape of those extra dimensions</p>
<p>leaves an imprint in the world that we do have access to.</p>
<p>So one of the ways that we have hoped yet to achieve</p>
<p>to make contact with experimental physics</p>
<p>is to see a signature of those extra dimensions</p>
<p>in places like the Large Hadron Collider</p>
<p>in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>but that would be a stunning moment</p>
<p>in the history of the species</p>
<p>if data that we acquired in these dimensions</p>
<p>gives us kind of incontrovertible evidence</p>
<p>that these dimensions are not the only dimensions.</p>
<p>I mean, how mind blowing would that be?</p>
<p>So with the Large Hadron Collider,</p>
<p>it would be something in the movement of the particles</p>
<p>or also the gravitational waves potentially be a place</p>
<p>where you can detect signs of multiple dimensions,</p>
<p>like with something like LIGO, but much more accurate.</p>
<p>In principle, all of these can work.</p>
<p>So one of the experiments that we had high hopes for,</p>
<p>but by high hopes, I&rsquo;m actually exaggerating.</p>
<p>One of the experiments that we imagined</p>
<p>might in the best of all circumstances,</p>
<p>yield some insight.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t with bated breath waiting for the result.</p>
<p>We knew it was a long shot.</p>
<p>When you slam protons together at very high speed</p>
<p>of the Large Hadron Collider,</p>
<p>if there are these extra dimensions</p>
<p>and if they have the right form,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a hypothesis that may not be correct,</p>
<p>but when the protons collide,</p>
<p>they can create debris, energetic debris</p>
<p>that can in some sense leave our dimensions</p>
<p>and insert itself into the other dimensions.</p>
<p>And the way you&rsquo;d recognize that is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be more energy before the collision</p>
<p>and after the collision because the debris</p>
<p>would have taken energy away from the place</p>
<p>where our detectors can detect it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one real concrete way</p>
<p>that you could find evidence for extra dimensions.</p>
<p>But yeah, since extra dimensions are of space</p>
<p>and gravity is something that exists within,</p>
<p>in fact is associated with the shape of space,</p>
<p>gravitational waves in principle</p>
<p>can provide a kind of cat scan of the extra dimensions</p>
<p>if you had sufficient control over those processes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t yet, but perhaps one day we will.</p>
<p>Does it make you sad a little bit?</p>
<p>Maybe looking out into the future,</p>
<p>you mentioned Ed Witten that no Nobel prizes</p>
<p>have been given yet related to string theory.</p>
<p>Do you think they will be?</p>
<p>Do you think you have to have experimental validation</p>
<p>or can a Nobel prize be given?</p>
<p>Which I don&rsquo;t think has been given for quite a long time</p>
<p>for purely sort of theoretical contribution.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s certainly as a matter of historical precedent</p>
<p>has been the case that those who win the prize</p>
<p>have established, investigated, illuminated</p>
<p>a demonstrably real quality of the world.</p>
<p>So gravitational waves, the prize was awarded</p>
<p>after they were detected, not the mathematics of it,</p>
<p>but the actual detection of it.</p>
<p>The Higgs particle, it was an idea that came</p>
<p>from the 1960s, Peter Higgs and others in fact.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until 2012 on July 4th</p>
<p>when the announcement came that this particle</p>
<p>had been detected at the Large Hadron Collider</p>
<p>that people viewed it as eligible for the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>The idea was there, the math was there,</p>
<p>but you needed to confirm it.</p>
<p>Indeed, the prize ultimately was awarded.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not surprised.</p>
<p>In fact, I would have been surprised</p>
<p>if a Nobel prize had been awarded</p>
<p>in the arena of string theory</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s far too speculative right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s far too hypothetical.</p>
<p>In fact, I am sympathetic to the view</p>
<p>that it really shouldn&rsquo;t be called string theory.</p>
<p>It degrades the word theory</p>
<p>because theory in science, of course,</p>
<p>means the best available explanation</p>
<p>for the things that we observe in the world,</p>
<p>the things that we measure in experiments about the world.</p>
<p>And string theory does not do that, at least not yet.</p>
<p>So it really should be the string hypothesis, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at an earlier stage of development</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not the kind of thing</p>
<p>that Nobel prizes should be awarded for.</p>
<p>What do you think about the critics out there, Peter White,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s from Columbia too, I think Sabine Hafenstatter.</p>
<p>Is that a healthy thing or should we sort of focus</p>
<p>on sort of the optimism of these hypotheses?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually a good way that you frame it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m always somewhat repelled</p>
<p>by views of the world that start from the negative.</p>
<p>Try to cut down an idea, try to say that&rsquo;s the wrong way</p>
<p>of thinking about things and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more drawn, maybe because I&rsquo;m an optimist,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m much more drawn to those</p>
<p>who go out into the world with new ideas.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t try to cut down one idea,</p>
<p>but rather present another one that might be better.</p>
<p>And so you make the first idea, maybe string theory irrelevant</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve come up with the better approach</p>
<p>to the world.</p>
<p>So do I think it&rsquo;s healthy?</p>
<p>Look, I think having a wide range of views</p>
<p>and perspectives is generally a healthy thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good to have arguments within a subject</p>
<p>in order that you stay fresh and you stay focused</p>
<p>on the things that matter.</p>
<p>But in the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a more vital contribution</p>
<p>to give us something new</p>
<p>rather than to criticize something that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m totally with you.</p>
<p>But it could be just the nature of being an optimist</p>
<p>and also just a love of engineering.</p>
<p>It helps nobody by criticizing the rocket</p>
<p>that somebody else built,</p>
<p>just build a bigger, cheaper, better rocket.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And that seems to be how human civilization</p>
<p>can progress effectively.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you about time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And do you think of time as emergent</p>
<p>or fundamental to our universe?</p>
<p>I like to think of it as emergent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a solid reason for that perspective.</p>
<p>I have a lot of hints of reasons</p>
<p>that some of which come out of string theory</p>
<p>and quantum gravity that perhaps would be worth talking about.</p>
<p>But what I would say is,</p>
<p>time is the most familiar quality of experience</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nothing that takes place</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t take place within an interval of time.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time,</p>
<p>it is perhaps the most mysterious quality of the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a wonderful confluence</p>
<p>of the familiar and the deeply mysterious</p>
<p>all in one little package.</p>
<p>If you were to ask me, what is time?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody does.</p>
<p>I can say what time gives us,</p>
<p>it allows us the language for talking about change.</p>
<p>It allows us to envision the events of the universe</p>
<p>being spread out in this temporal timeline.</p>
<p>And in that way, allows us to see the patterns</p>
<p>that unfold within time.</p>
<p>I mean, time allows us the structure and the organization</p>
<p>to think about things in that kind of a progression.</p>
<p>But what actually is it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so strange because we can measure it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there are laboratories in the world</p>
<p>that measure this thing called time</p>
<p>to spectacular precision.</p>
<p>But if you go up to the folks and say,</p>
<p>what is it that you&rsquo;re actually measuring?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that they can really articulate</p>
<p>the kind of answer that you would expect</p>
<p>from those who are engineering a device</p>
<p>that can measure something called time</p>
<p>to that level of precision.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very curious combination.</p>
<p>What do you make of the one way feeling of causality?</p>
<p>Like is causality a thing or is that too just a human story</p>
<p>that we put on top of this emergent phenomenon of time?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can give you my guess and my intuition about it.</p>
<p>I do think that at the macroscopic level,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about sort of the human experience of time,</p>
<p>I do think at the macroscopic level,</p>
<p>there is a fundamental notion of causality</p>
<p>that does emerge from a starting point</p>
<p>that may not have causality built in.</p>
<p>So I certainly would allow that at the deepest description</p>
<p>of reality when we finally have that on the table,</p>
<p>we may not see causality directly at that fundamental level.</p>
<p>But I do believe that we will understand</p>
<p>how to go from that fundamental level</p>
<p>to a world where at the macroscopic level,</p>
<p>there is this notion of A causes B.</p>
<p>A notion that Einstein deeply embraced</p>
<p>in his special theory of relativity</p>
<p>where he showed that time has qualities</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t expect based on experience.</p>
<p>You and I, if we move relative to each other,</p>
<p>our clocks tick off time at different rate.</p>
<p>And our clocks is just a means of measuring</p>
<p>this thing called time.</p>
<p>So this is really time that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Time for you and time for me are different</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re in relative motion.</p>
<p>He then shows in the general theory of relativity</p>
<p>that if we&rsquo;re experiencing different gravity,</p>
<p>different gravitational fields</p>
<p>or actually more precisely</p>
<p>different gravitational potentials,</p>
<p>time will elapse for us at different rates.</p>
<p>These are things that are astoundingly strange</p>
<p>that give rise to a scientific notion of time travel.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is how far Einstein took us</p>
<p>in wiping away the old understanding of time</p>
<p>and injecting a new understanding of its qualities.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so much about time that&rsquo;s counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but I do not think that we&rsquo;re ever going</p>
<p>to wipe away causality at the macroscopic level.</p>
<p>At the macroscopic, I mean, there&rsquo;s so many interesting</p>
<p>things at the macroscopic level</p>
<p>that may only exist at the macroscopic level.</p>
<p>Like we already talked about consciousness</p>
<p>that very well could be one of the things.</p>
<p>You mentioned time travel.</p>
<p>So, I mean, according to Einstein and in general,</p>
<p>what types of travel do you think</p>
<p>our physical universe allows?</p>
<p>Well, it certainly allows time travel to the future.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about the silly thing</p>
<p>that you and I are now going into the future</p>
<p>second by second by second.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about really the diversion</p>
<p>that you see in Hollywood, at least in terms</p>
<p>of its net effect, whereby an individual</p>
<p>can follow an Einsteinian strategy</p>
<p>and propel themselves into the future</p>
<p>in some sense more quickly.</p>
<p>So if I wanted to see what&rsquo;s happening on planet Earth</p>
<p>one million years from now, Einstein tells me</p>
<p>how to get one million years from now.</p>
<p>Build a ship.</p>
<p>I got to turn to guys who know how to build stuff.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do it like you.</p>
<p>Build a ship that can go out into the universe</p>
<p>near the speed of light, turn around and come back.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a six month journey out</p>
<p>and a six month journey back.</p>
<p>And Einstein tells me how fast I need to travel,</p>
<p>how close to the speed of light I need to go</p>
<p>so that when I step out of my ship,</p>
<p>it will now be one million years into the future</p>
<p>on planet Earth.</p>
<p>And this is not a controversial statement, right?</p>
<p>This is not something where there&rsquo;s differences</p>
<p>of opinion in the scientific community.</p>
<p>Any scientist who knows anything</p>
<p>about what Einstein taught us agrees with what I just said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s commonplace, it&rsquo;s bread and butter physics.</p>
<p>And so that kind of travel to the future</p>
<p>is absolutely allowed by the laws of physics.</p>
<p>There are engineering challenges,</p>
<p>there are technological challenges.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re close to the speed of light part, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there are even biological challenges, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re G forces that you&rsquo;re gonna experience.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all sorts of stuff embedded in this,</p>
<p>but those I will call the details.</p>
<p>And those details, notwithstanding,</p>
<p>the universe allows this kind of travel to the future.</p>
<p>And if I could pause real quick,</p>
<p>you could also, at the macro level,</p>
<p>with biology extend the human lifespan</p>
<p>to do a kind of travel forward in time.</p>
<p>If you expand how long we live,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a way to, from a perspective of an observer,</p>
<p>a conscious observer that is a human being,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially traveling forward in time</p>
<p>by allowing yourself to live long enough to see the thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in the space of biology.</p>
<p>What about traveling back in time?</p>
<p>Yeah, that is a natural next question,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re going on one of these journeys.</p>
<p>Is it a one way journey or can you come back?</p>
<p>And the physics community doesn&rsquo;t speak</p>
<p>with a unified voice on this as yet,</p>
<p>but I would say that the dominant perspective</p>
<p>is that you cannot get back.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, there are proposals</p>
<p>that serious people have written papers on</p>
<p>regarding hypothetical ways</p>
<p>in which you could travel to the past.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen some of these.</p>
<p>Again, Hollywood loves to take the most sexy ideas</p>
<p>of physics and build narratives around them.</p>
<p>This idea of a wormhole,</p>
<p>like Jodie Foster in Contact went through a wormhole,</p>
<p>Deep Space Nine Star,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many other examples</p>
<p>for these ideas that I&rsquo;ve probably never even seen.</p>
<p>But with wormholes, there&rsquo;s at least a proposal</p>
<p>of how you could take a wormhole tunnel through space time,</p>
<p>manipulate the openings of the wormhole</p>
<p>in such a way that the openings are no longer synchronous.</p>
<p>They are out of sync relative to each other,</p>
<p>which would mean one&rsquo;s ahead and one&rsquo;s behind,</p>
<p>which means if you go through one direction,</p>
<p>you travel to the future.</p>
<p>If you go back, you travel to the past.</p>
<p>Now, we don&rsquo;t know if there are wormholes in the world.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re possible according to Einstein, correct?</p>
<p>They are possible according to Einstein.</p>
<p>But even Einstein was very quick to say,</p>
<p>just because my math allows for something,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I mean, he famously didn&rsquo;t even believe in black holes.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t believe in the Big Bang, right?</p>
<p>And yet the black hole issue has really been settled now.</p>
<p>We have radio telescopic photographs</p>
<p>of the black hole in M87.</p>
<p>It was in newspapers around the world</p>
<p>just a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just to say that just because it&rsquo;s in Einstein&rsquo;s math,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>But yes, it is the case that wormholes</p>
<p>are allowed by Einstein&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>And in principle, you can imagine, you know,</p>
<p>putting electric charges on the openings of the wormhole,</p>
<p>allowing you to tow them around</p>
<p>in a manner that could yield</p>
<p>this temporal asymmetry between them.</p>
<p>Maybe you tow one of the mouths to the edge of a black hole.</p>
<p>In principle, you can do this,</p>
<p>slowing down the passage of time near that black hole.</p>
<p>And then when you bring it back,</p>
<p>it will be well out of sync with the other opening</p>
<p>and therefore could be a significant temporal gap</p>
<p>between one and the other.</p>
<p>But people who study this in more detail question,</p>
<p>could you ever keep a wormhole open,</p>
<p>assuming it does exist?</p>
<p>Could you ever travel through a wormhole</p>
<p>or would there be a requirement</p>
<p>to some kind of exotic matter to prop it open</p>
<p>that perhaps doesn&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>So there are many, many issues that people have raised.</p>
<p>And I would say that the general sentiment</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s unlikely that this kind of scenario</p>
<p>is going to survive our deeper understanding of physics</p>
<p>when we finally have it.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the door is closed.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s a small possibility</p>
<p>that this could one day be real.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an interesting way to put it.</p>
<p>It will not, this kind of scenario</p>
<p>will not survive deep understanding of physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting way to put it</p>
<p>because it makes you wonder what kind of scenarios</p>
<p>will be created by our deeper understanding of physics.</p>
<p>Maybe, sorry to go crazy for a second,</p>
<p>but if you have like the pan psychism idea</p>
<p>that consciousness permeates all matter,</p>
<p>maybe traveling in that, whatever laws of physics,</p>
<p>the consciousness operates under something like that.</p>
<p>In that view of the university,</p>
<p>if we somehow are able to understand that part,</p>
<p>maybe traveling is super easy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does not follow the constraints</p>
<p>of the speed of light, something like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so look, I have a definite degree of sympathy</p>
<p>with the possibility that consciousness might be more</p>
<p>than what we described earlier</p>
<p>as just the byproduct of mindless particles.</p>
<p>You just made the rock happy.</p>
<p>Exactly, so it isn&rsquo;t the approach</p>
<p>that feels to me the most likely, but I see the logic.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the puzzle,</p>
<p>how to mindless particles build mind,</p>
<p>one resolution might be the particles are not mindless.</p>
<p>The particles have some kind of proto conscious quality.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something appealing</p>
<p>about that straightforward solution to the puzzle.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, if we do live in a pan psychist world</p>
<p>where there is a degree of consciousness residing</p>
<p>in everything in the world around us, then yes,</p>
<p>I do think some interesting possibilities might emerge</p>
<p>where maybe there&rsquo;s a way of communing</p>
<p>with physical reality in a deeper way than we have so far.</p>
<p>I mean, we as human beings,</p>
<p>a vital part of our existence</p>
<p>is human to human communication, contact.</p>
<p>We live in social groups and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s allowed us</p>
<p>to get to the place where we&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>
<p>Imagine that we have long missed</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s other consciousness out there</p>
<p>and some kind of relationship or communion</p>
<p>with that larger conscious possibility</p>
<p>would take us to a different place.</p>
<p>Now, do I buy into this yet?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t see any evidence for it,</p>
<p>but do I have an open mind and allow for the possibility</p>
<p>in the future?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s not the case</p>
<p>and you have these simple particles</p>
<p>that at the macro level emerges some interesting stuff</p>
<p>like consciousness, another thing you write about</p>
<p>in the Until the End of Time book</p>
<p>is the thing that it seems to emerge at the macro level</p>
<p>is the feeling like there&rsquo;s a free will,</p>
<p>like we decide to do stuff.</p>
<p>And you have a really interesting take here,</p>
<p>which is, no, there&rsquo;s not a free will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna speak for you and then you can correct me.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s not a free will,</p>
<p>but there is an experience of freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which I really love.</p>
<p>So where does the experience,</p>
<p>where does freedom come from</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t have any kind of physics based free will?</p>
<p>Yeah, and so the idea follows naturally</p>
<p>from all that we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make the assumption that all there is</p>
<p>in the physical universe is stuff governed by laws.</p>
<p>We may not have those laws,</p>
<p>may not know what the fundamental stuff is yet,</p>
<p>but everything we know in science points in the direction</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s physical stuff governed by universal laws.</p>
<p>And that being the case, or that being the assumption,</p>
<p>then you come to a particular collection</p>
<p>of those ingredients called a human being.</p>
<p>And that human being has particles</p>
<p>that are fully governed by physical law.</p>
<p>And when you then recognize it,</p>
<p>every thought that we have,</p>
<p>every action that we undertake</p>
<p>is just the motion of particles.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m thinking thoughts right now,</p>
<p>of course, at this level of description,</p>
<p>it is the motion of particles cascading</p>
<p>down various neurons inside of my head and so on.</p>
<p>And every single one of those motions,</p>
<p>collectively and individually,</p>
<p>is fully governed by these laws</p>
<p>that we perhaps don&rsquo;t have yet,</p>
<p>but we imagine one day we will.</p>
<p>That leaves no opportunity for any kind of freedom</p>
<p>to break free from the constraint of physical law.</p>
<p>And that is the end of the story.</p>
<p>So the traditional intuitive notion of free will,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re the ultimate authors of our actions,</p>
<p>that we were the buck stops,</p>
<p>that there is no antecedent,</p>
<p>that is the cause for our decided to go left or right,</p>
<p>choose vanilla or chocolate, live or die,</p>
<p>that intuitive sensation does not have a basis</p>
<p>in our understanding of the physical world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the end of the free will of the traditional sort.</p>
<p>But then your question is,</p>
<p>what about this other kind of freedom I talk about?</p>
<p>And the other kind of freedom,</p>
<p>if you focus on it intently,</p>
<p>I think is actually the true version of freedom</p>
<p>that we feel.</p>
<p>And that freedom is this.</p>
<p>You look at inanimate objects in the world,</p>
<p>rocks, bottles of water, whatever,</p>
<p>they have a very limited behavioral repertoire.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Their internal organization is too coarse</p>
<p>for them to do very much, right?</p>
<p>You try to have a conversation with a glass of water,</p>
<p>you send sound waves, it doesn&rsquo;t do much.</p>
<p>It may vibrate a little bit,</p>
<p>but the repertoire of responses are incredibly limited.</p>
<p>The difference between us and a rock or a bottle of water</p>
<p>is that our inner organization,</p>
<p>by virtue of eons of evolution by natural selection,</p>
<p>is so refined, so spectacularly ordered,</p>
<p>that we have a huge repertoire of behaviors</p>
<p>that are finely attuned to stimuli from the external world.</p>
<p>You ask me a question, that&rsquo;s a stimulus,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>these particle processes go into action,</p>
<p>and this is the result, this answer that I&rsquo;m giving you.</p>
<p>So the freedom that we have is not from</p>
<p>the control of physical law.</p>
<p>The freedom that we have is from the constrained behavior</p>
<p>that has long since governed inanimate objects.</p>
<p>We are liberated from the limited behavioral repertoire</p>
<p>of rocks and bottles of water</p>
<p>to have this broad spectrum of responses.</p>
<p>Do we pick them?</p>
<p>We do not.</p>
<p>Do we freely choose them?</p>
<p>We do not, but yet we have them,</p>
<p>and we can marvel at those behaviors,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the freedom that we have.</p>
<p>The complexity and the breadth of that repertoire</p>
<p>is where the freedom emerges.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about emergence?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at much about objects</p>
<p>that I seem to love way more than anyone else,</p>
<p>which is Sally or Tom,</p>
<p>like game of life type of stuff.</p>
<p>From simple things emerges beautiful complexities,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s that repertoire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it seems if you have enough stuff,</p>
<p>just beautiful complexity emerges</p>
<p>that sure as heck to our human eyes looks</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s consciousness there, there&rsquo;s free will,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s little objects moving about and making decisions.</p>
<p>I mean, all of that,</p>
<p>you can say it&rsquo;s anthropomorphization,</p>
<p>but it sure as heck feels</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re organisms making decisions.</p>
<p>What is that emergence thing?</p>
<p>Is that within the realm of physics to understand?</p>
<p>Is it within the realm of poetry?</p>
<p>What is that, like complex systems, emergence?</p>
<p>Will that ever be understood by science?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the way that I think about it.</p>
<p>So there are clearly qualities of the world</p>
<p>that emerge on macroscopic scales,</p>
<p>our sense of beauty, wonder, consciousness,</p>
<p>all of these kinds of qualities.</p>
<p>Do I feel that they ultimately are explainable</p>
<p>from the laws of physics?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>There is nothing that&rsquo;s not ultimately explainable</p>
<p>with the laws of physics from this physicalist perspective,</p>
<p>which is what I take.</p>
<p>So you got the particles, you got the laws,</p>
<p>and you have things that emerge</p>
<p>from the choreographed motions of those particles.</p>
<p>But is that the best language</p>
<p>for talking about these emergent qualities?</p>
<p>Usually not.</p>
<p>If I was to take something even more mundane,</p>
<p>like a baseball flying through the air,</p>
<p>if I was to describe it in terms of the quarks</p>
<p>and the electrons,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give you this mountain of data</p>
<p>with 10 to the 28 particles</p>
<p>and all of their coordinates and spaces</p>
<p>a function of time.</p>
<p>I hand you this mountain of data,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like, I don&rsquo;t know what this is.</p>
<p>And then if you really were clever and you&rsquo;re looking,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s a baseball,</p>
<p>just described in the least economical way possible.</p>
<p>It is much more useful and insightful</p>
<p>to talk about the baseball flying through the air.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are things at the macroscopic level</p>
<p>like human experience and human emotion and human action</p>
<p>and the sensation of free will</p>
<p>that we undeniably all have,</p>
<p>even if it itself doesn&rsquo;t have a basis</p>
<p>in our understanding of the physical world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful to talk about things in this very human language.</p>
<p>And so, yes, it&rsquo;s vital to talk about things</p>
<p>in the poetic language of human experience,</p>
<p>but do not lose sight of the fact, and some people do.</p>
<p>They say, oh, it&rsquo;s just an emergent phenomenon.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lose sight of the fact that emergent phenomena</p>
<p>are emerging from this deeper understanding</p>
<p>that comes from the reductionist account of physical law.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of insight to come from that,</p>
<p>such as the freedom that you thought that you had,</p>
<p>the freedom of will that you thought you had.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have a basis in that reductionist account,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>So speaking of the poetry of human experience,</p>
<p>you mentioned the images of the black holes.</p>
<p>How did it make you feel a few years ago</p>
<p>when that first image came out?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly amazing.</p>
<p>A sense of, well, I guess the feeling was both amazing</p>
<p>and there was a little sense of,</p>
<p>jealousy is not quite the right word,</p>
<p>but a sense of longing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a better word,</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s a subject that started with Einstein</p>
<p>back in 1915, writes down the equations</p>
<p>of the general theory of relativity,</p>
<p>and then there are scores of individuals over the decades,</p>
<p>starting with people like Karl Schwarzschild</p>
<p>who analyze the equations,</p>
<p>see the possibility of black holes.</p>
<p>People develop these ideas.</p>
<p>John Wheeler, all these greats of physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a hypothetical subject.</p>
<p>It gets closer to reality through observations</p>
<p>of the center of our galaxy,</p>
<p>stars whipping around in a manner</p>
<p>that could only really be explained</p>
<p>by there being a black hole in the center of our galaxy,</p>
<p>but it was still indirect.</p>
<p>To actually have a direct image that you can look at,</p>
<p>what a beautiful arc, narrative arc</p>
<p>from the theoretical to the absolutely established.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we hope will happen with other areas,</p>
<p>for instance, string theory, right?</p>
<p>I mean, wholly mathematical subject at the outset</p>
<p>and still pretty much a wholly mathematical subject today.</p>
<p>Yeah, do we long for that image</p>
<p>where we can look at it and say, string, it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I mean, how thrilling, how thrilling to be part</p>
<p>of that journey, to be part of that step</p>
<p>that moves things from the abstract to the concrete.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like the image of the DNA, the early images</p>
<p>of the DNA, for example, but there is something special.</p>
<p>So the problem with strings is they&rsquo;re tiny.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder to take a picture in the following sense.</p>
<p>When you think of a black hole, I mean, you have a swirl</p>
<p>of, I guess, what is, I don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s dust,</p>
<p>whatever light.</p>
<p>A careening onto the event horizon.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s darkness in the center.</p>
<p>And you just imagine, so that picture in particular,</p>
<p>I guess, is of a gigantic black hole.</p>
<p>So you just, I mean, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>Billions of times the mass of the sun.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s both exciting and terrifying.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know where you fall in the spectrum.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s exciting at first.</p>
<p>Like the longer I think about it, every time I think</p>
<p>about it, the more terrifying it becomes.</p>
<p>So it always starts exciting and then it goes to terrifying.</p>
<p>And both are feelings, very human feelings</p>
<p>that I appreciate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like terrified awe.</p>
<p>Somehow it&rsquo;s still beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way of saying it.</p>
<p>And I think I kind of share that reaction</p>
<p>because there is a way in which when you work on this</p>
<p>subject, like all the time, I teach it, I teach about</p>
<p>black holes, write the equations on the blackboard.</p>
<p>The ideas reside in a very cognitive,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, mathematical portion of the brain,</p>
<p>or at least for me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only when you like sit down and it&rsquo;s quiet</p>
<p>and you start to contemplate, wait, wait, wait, wait,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t just like a mathematical game.</p>
<p>There are these monsters out there.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t, not in a sense of I fear for my life,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a sense of how extraordinary is this universe.</p>
<p>And so it is breathtaking.</p>
<p>How powerful nature is.</p>
<p>Yeah, how stupendously powerful nature is.</p>
<p>And so there is a deep sense of humility</p>
<p>that I think this instills if you really allow</p>
<p>the ideas to sink in.</p>
<p>Well, I have to ask about the most stupendously</p>
<p>powerful thing to have ever happened in our universe,</p>
<p>which is the Big Bang.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with the Big Bang?</p>
<p>So we can, I mean, with gravitational waves,</p>
<p>the hope is you have more and more accurate measurements</p>
<p>of the gravitational waves.</p>
<p>You can crawl back further and further back in time</p>
<p>towards the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope that we&rsquo;ll be able to understand</p>
<p>the early spark that created our universe?</p>
<p>Yeah, that and the deep interior of a black hole</p>
<p>I think are the biggest mysteries that we hope</p>
<p>the melding of quantum mechanics and gravity will reveal,</p>
<p>will illuminate.</p>
<p>And what question could be more captivating</p>
<p>than why is there something rather than nothing, right?</p>
<p>Why is there a universe at all?</p>
<p>And will the theories that we&rsquo;re developing</p>
<p>take us to an answer to that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Even if we truly knew what the Big Bang is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a big question in its own right,</p>
<p>one would still be left with the question,</p>
<p>well, okay, so you&rsquo;ve explained the process</p>
<p>by which a tiny nugget of a universe,</p>
<p>a tiny nugget of space time can undergo some kind of growth</p>
<p>to yield the world around us.</p>
<p>But presumably in that explanation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna involve mathematics and some ingredients</p>
<p>like quantum fields or matter or energy or something.</p>
<p>Where did that stuff come from?</p>
<p>Can we get to that level of explanation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it is remarkable</p>
<p>that if you ask what happened a millionth of a second</p>
<p>after the Big Bang,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really that controversial any longer, right?</p>
<p>Even though there&rsquo;s a lot of argument in the field</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very heated right now I should say</p>
<p>regarding what is the right theory of the Big Bang?</p>
<p>What is the right theory of early universe cosmology</p>
<p>where I mean early, much earlier</p>
<p>than a millionth of a second,</p>
<p>a lot of dissent, a lot of heated arguments about that.</p>
<p>No pun intended.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, exactly.</p>
<p>But you go like a millionth of a second after that</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re on pretty firm ground.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that amazing, right?</p>
<p>To understand what happened from that point forward.</p>
<p>But to go back is controversial.</p>
<p>So there is this theory called inflationary cosmology,</p>
<p>which I would say has been the dominant paradigm</p>
<p>since early 1980s.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>Roughly 40 years now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been the dominant cosmological paradigm.</p>
<p>And it makes use of a curious feature</p>
<p>of Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity,</p>
<p>his theory of gravity,</p>
<p>where Einstein shows us mathematically</p>
<p>that gravity can not only be attractive,</p>
<p>the kind of gravity that we&rsquo;re used to,</p>
<p>things pulled together, but it can also be repulsive.</p>
<p>And that fact is then leveraged by people like Alan Guth</p>
<p>and Andre Linde, and at the time Paul Steinhardt</p>
<p>and Andreas Albrecht and others to say,</p>
<p>okay, if we had a little nugget in the earlier universe,</p>
<p>which was filled with the stuff</p>
<p>that yields this repulsive gravity,</p>
<p>well, that would have blown everything apart.</p>
<p>It would cause everything to swell.</p>
<p>Beautiful explanation for what the bang</p>
<p>in the big bang was.</p>
<p>And then people mathematically analyze the consequences</p>
<p>of this idea and they make predictions</p>
<p>for tiny temperature differences across the night sky</p>
<p>that in principle could be measured.</p>
<p>You send up balloons, you send up satellites</p>
<p>with very refined thermometers,</p>
<p>and they measured the temperature of the night sky</p>
<p>and the statistical distribution</p>
<p>of the temperature differences agrees</p>
<p>with the mathematical predictions.</p>
<p>I mean, you just sort of have to stand in awe</p>
<p>of this insight.</p>
<p>So you think, aha, the theory has been established,</p>
<p>but scientists are an incredibly skeptical bunch.</p>
<p>And some scientists, including one of the people</p>
<p>who helped develop the theory at the outset,</p>
<p>Paul Steinhardt comes along and says,</p>
<p>well, yeah, this theory has done pretty well so far,</p>
<p>but there are aspects of this theory</p>
<p>that are making me lose confidence.</p>
<p>For instance, this theory seems to suggest</p>
<p>that there might be other universes.</p>
<p>Like, how do you make sense of a theory</p>
<p>that suggests there are other universes?</p>
<p>Or there are others who come along and say,</p>
<p>this theory seems to talk about length scales</p>
<p>that are minuscule even by the so called Planck length,</p>
<p>the sort of shortest length that we can imagine</p>
<p>making sense of in a theory of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>How do you make sense of that?</p>
<p>And so on and so forth, they develop a list of things</p>
<p>that they consider to be chinks</p>
<p>in the inflationary cosmological theory&rsquo;s armor.</p>
<p>And they develop other ideas,</p>
<p>which they claim yield the same predictions</p>
<p>as inflationary cosmology</p>
<p>for those temperature differences across space,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t suffer from these problems.</p>
<p>And then the inflationary cosmology folks say,</p>
<p>no, no, no, hang on.</p>
<p>Your theory suffers from different problems.</p>
<p>And so the arguments goes, it&rsquo;s a healthy debate.</p>
<p>Talk about real debates in science.</p>
<p>So when you ask what&rsquo;s up with the Big Bang,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know right now.</p>
<p>If you would have asked me five years ago,</p>
<p>maybe even less than that, three or four years ago,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said, look, inflationary cosmology has some issues,</p>
<p>but the package of explanations it provides is so potent</p>
<p>and the issues that beset it are seemingly solvable to me</p>
<p>that I would imagine it&rsquo;s going to in the end, win out.</p>
<p>I would still say that today,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t say it as loudly.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it as confidently.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth thinking about alternate ideas</p>
<p>and it could be the case that the paradigm</p>
<p>at some point shifts.</p>
<p>Does dark matter and dark energy fit into the shifting</p>
<p>of the explanations for those?</p>
<p>Yeah, certainly.</p>
<p>So dark energy has in the inflationary theory</p>
<p>is kind of a big mystery.</p>
<p>So dark energy is the observational realization</p>
<p>in the last 20 years</p>
<p>that not only is the universe expanding,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s expanding ever more quickly.</p>
<p>Something is still pushing things outward.</p>
<p>And the explanation is that there&rsquo;s like a residual version</p>
<p>of the repulsive gravity from the early universe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s such a strange number.</p>
<p>When you write that amount of dark energy</p>
<p>using the relevant units in a theory of quantum gravity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a decimal point followed by like 120 zeros</p>
<p>and then a one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not used to those kinds of numbers in physics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re used to a half, one, pi, e squared to two.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of fundamental numbers</p>
<p>that emerge in our explanations of the world.</p>
<p>And we look at this bizarre number,</p>
<p>decimal point, all these zeros and a one,</p>
<p>we say something&rsquo;s wrong there.</p>
<p>Like where would that number have come from?</p>
<p>And now there are people who suggest resolution to it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re totally in the dark on it,</p>
<p>but those people like Paul Steinhard</p>
<p>who have alternate cosmological theories,</p>
<p>cyclic cosmologies as they call it,</p>
<p>claim that they have a more natural explanation</p>
<p>of the dark energy,</p>
<p>that it naturally feeds into a cyclical process</p>
<p>that is their cosmological paradigm.</p>
<p>So yeah, if the cosmology should change,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s conceivable our view of dark energy</p>
<p>may change from deeply mysterious</p>
<p>to deeply integrated into a different paradigm.</p>
<p>That is possible.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Roger Penrose that think</p>
<p>that information can bleed through</p>
<p>from before the Big Bang to the after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Is the Big Bang like a full erasure of the hard drive</p>
<p>or is there some information that could bleed through?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so Roger is among the most creative thinkers</p>
<p>of the last 100 years,</p>
<p>rightly won the Nobel Prize for his insights</p>
<p>into singularities in space time</p>
<p>that we know to afflict our mathematical solutions</p>
<p>of black holes in the Big Bang and so forth.</p>
<p>And he has an enormously fertile imagination.</p>
<p>And I mean that in the most positive sense.</p>
<p>And so he has put forward this idea,</p>
<p>this conformal cyclic cosmology,</p>
<p>I think is the official title,</p>
<p>although I could be getting that wrong.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve studied it.</p>
<p>I have seen lectures on it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find it convincing as yet.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s being built to find a solution</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of more naturally emerging.</p>
<p>Maybe Roger would say otherwise.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean to in any way</p>
<p>cast aspersions on the work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vital and interesting and people are thinking about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider it as close a competitor</p>
<p>to say the inflationary theory as for instance,</p>
<p>the stuff that Paul Steinhardt has put forward.</p>
<p>But again, you&rsquo;ve got to keep an open mind</p>
<p>in this business when there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t yet understand.</p>
<p>I mean, it is wild to think</p>
<p>that information could survive something like that.</p>
<p>Just like it is wild to imagine</p>
<p>that information could escape a black hole, for example.</p>
<p>It just seems like by construction,</p>
<p>these things are supposed to not bleed out anything.</p>
<p>But one of the challenges in all of these theories</p>
<p>is when we talk about a singularity,</p>
<p>has this real sexy term, the singularity.</p>
<p>But a singularity is in more ordinary language,</p>
<p>a physical system where the mathematics breaks down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nonsensical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like taking one divided by zero.</p>
<p>You put that into a calculator and it says E error, right?</p>
<p>It does not make sense, doesn&rsquo;t compute.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very hard to make definitive statements</p>
<p>about things like the Big Bang or about black holes</p>
<p>until we cure the mathematical singularities.</p>
<p>And there are some who claim that in certain regimes,</p>
<p>the singularities have been cured.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t by any means think that there&rsquo;s consensus</p>
<p>on these ideas.</p>
<p>So when one talks about information sort of bleeding</p>
<p>through the Big Bang, you&rsquo;ve really got to make sure</p>
<p>that the equations have no singularity.</p>
<p>You talk about cyclic cosmology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to make sure that the equations</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any singularities as you go from, say,</p>
<p>one cycle to the next.</p>
<p>Now, some of the proponents of these theories claim</p>
<p>that they have resolved these issues.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a general sense</p>
<p>that that is the case as yet, but it could be that,</p>
<p>look, life is so short that I haven&rsquo;t had the time</p>
<p>to deeply delve into all the mathematical intricacies</p>
<p>of all the ideas that have been put forward.</p>
<p>If I did that, I&rsquo;d never do anything else.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what the issue is.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s just math.</p>
<p>There may be holes.</p>
<p>There may be gaps in our understanding</p>
<p>in the way we&rsquo;re modeling physical reality.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>In fact, when you said, I was about to jump in</p>
<p>and say modeling, but you got there first,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s exactly the right point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the universe here, right?</p>
<p>And how do you talk about the universe</p>
<p>with a straight face, mathematically?</p>
<p>And the way you do it is you simplify,</p>
<p>you throw away those characteristics of the universe</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t think are vital to a full understanding.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re gonna get to a point people are starting to</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve got to go beyond those simplifications.</p>
<p>And so cosmology has for a long time modeled the universe</p>
<p>in the most simplest terms, homogeneous, isotropic.</p>
<p>It has just a few parameters that describe it,</p>
<p>the average density of mass and energy and so forth.</p>
<p>We have to go beyond those simplifications,</p>
<p>and that will require putting these things on computers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna be able to do calculations there.</p>
<p>So much as astrophysics has gone beyond many simplifications</p>
<p>to now give really detailed simulations of star systems</p>
<p>and galaxies and so forth,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to do that with cosmology,</p>
<p>and people are starting to do that today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen some interesting work on simulation,</p>
<p>most simulation cosmology, by the way, is just awesome.</p>
<p>But just like simulation of the early formation</p>
<p>of our solar system to understand how the like the Oort cloud</p>
<p>and just, I don&rsquo;t know, the whole of it,</p>
<p>how Earth came to be, like how Jupiter just protects us.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like weird like moons and volcanoes</p>
<p>and like modeling all of that,</p>
<p>the formation of all of that is fascinating.</p>
<p>Because that naturally is the question</p>
<p>of how does life emerge on these kinds of rocks?</p>
<p>How does a rock become a rabbit?</p>
<p>But speaking of models,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an equation called the Drake equation.</p>
<p>We were talking about life.</p>
<p>Have to ask, at the highest level first,</p>
<p>when you look out there,</p>
<p>how many alien civilizations do you think are out there?</p>
<p>Well, zero, one, or many?</p>
<p>So if you say civilization,</p>
<p>I would bring my number way down.</p>
<p>It could be zero.</p>
<p>If you talk about life, I think it could be many.</p>
<p>As we were saying before,</p>
<p>I think the move from life to consciousness,</p>
<p>the kinds of beings that would build</p>
<p>what we would recognize as a civilization,</p>
<p>that may be extraordinarily rare.</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You know, as a kid, I loved Star Trek.</p>
<p>I just loved the idea that we would be part</p>
<p>of some universal community where,</p>
<p>look, experience on planet Earth</p>
<p>suggests it doesn&rsquo;t always go so well</p>
<p>when groups who are separated try to come together</p>
<p>and live in some larger collective.</p>
<p>But again, as an optimist,</p>
<p>how amazing would it be to converse</p>
<p>with an alien civilization and learn</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;ve figured out about physics and cosmology</p>
<p>and compare notes and learn from each other</p>
<p>in some wonderful way?</p>
<p>I love that idea.</p>
<p>But if you ask me the likelihood of it,</p>
<p>I would err on saying it may be so improbable</p>
<p>that the conditions conspire to allow life</p>
<p>to move to this place of consciousness</p>
<p>that it might be rare.</p>
<p>It might be oversimplifying things,</p>
<p>but just observing the power of the evolutionary process,</p>
<p>I tend to believe,</p>
<p>and like you read different theories of how we went,</p>
<p>how Homo sapiens evolved,</p>
<p>it seems like the evolutionary process</p>
<p>naturally leads to Homo sapiens</p>
<p>or creatures like that or much better than that.</p>
<p>So to me, there&rsquo;s several scary scenarios.</p>
<p>So, okay, the positive scenario</p>
<p>is life itself is really difficult.</p>
<p>So that origin of life is difficult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting for many reasons</p>
<p>because we might be able to prove that wrong easily</p>
<p>in the near term by finding life elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The scary thing to me is if life is easy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s plenty of conscious intelligent civilizations</p>
<p>out there and we have not obviously made contact,</p>
<p>which means with intelligence and consciousness</p>
<p>comes responsibility and ultimately destruction.</p>
<p>So with power comes great responsibility</p>
<p>and then we end up destroying ourselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scariest.</p>
<p>The positive, I guess, version is that</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re being watched,</p>
<p>sort of like there&rsquo;s a transition</p>
<p>to where you don&rsquo;t wanna ruin the primitive villages</p>
<p>out there and so there&rsquo;s a protective layer around us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re watching.</p>
<p>So where do you in these possible explanations</p>
<p>to the Fermi paradox,</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t we contacted aliens?</p>
<p>Do you land on?</p>
<p>Well, I think the most straightforward explanation</p>
<p>is that there aren&rsquo;t any.</p>
<p>Now, there are many other explanations too.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t be dogmatic about things</p>
<p>that are just sort of gut feel,</p>
<p>but one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you ever saw this one</p>
<p>where this alien civilization finally comes</p>
<p>to planet Earth and gives us this book</p>
<p>that they really want us to have and to hold</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in this foreign language,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>The cryptographers, they desperately try to decipher it</p>
<p>as humans are gonna visit this other alien planet</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all sending back postcards,</p>
<p>how wonderful it is and so forth</p>
<p>and they finally decipher the title.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s To Serve Man and everyone&rsquo;s so thrilled,</p>
<p>oh, they&rsquo;re here to serve us, it all makes sense</p>
<p>and then just as one of the final cryptographers</p>
<p>is going on to the alien ship,</p>
<p>his helper runs and says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve deciphered the rest of the book.</p>
<p>To Serve Man, it&rsquo;s a cookbook.</p>
<p>So yeah, is that a possibility?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And so could they be watching us</p>
<p>and just sort of waiting for us to get</p>
<p>to a mature enough level?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it strikes me.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;d be better to have this conversation</p>
<p>after the James Webb Telescope.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think that if we look</p>
<p>at the atmospheres of many planets,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s now an estimate now</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s on order of one planet per star on average.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve long known that the galaxy,</p>
<p>hundreds of billions of stars,</p>
<p>numbers of galaxies, hundreds of billions of galaxies.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about hundreds of billions</p>
<p>of hundreds of billions of planets, oh my.</p>
<p>And if we start to survey some of these planets</p>
<p>and one after the other after the other,</p>
<p>we just sort of find no evidence</p>
<p>for any of the biological markers.</p>
<p>It could be, of course,</p>
<p>maybe life takes a radically different form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be hard to know that.</p>
<p>But I think that would at least give us some insight</p>
<p>on the life question.</p>
<p>But I just don&rsquo;t see how we get insight</p>
<p>on the civilization or consciousness question</p>
<p>without the direct connection.</p>
<p>And it strikes me that if consciousness is ubiquitous,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say life is, I&rsquo;m willing to grant that.</p>
<p>If consciousness is also ubiquitous,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t understand why they haven&rsquo;t been here</p>
<p>or why there hasn&rsquo;t been separation</p>
<p>because presumably they should be much further ahead of us.</p>
<p>How unlike would it be that we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>of all consciousness in the universe,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the most advanced.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be such a special place for human beings</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard for me to grant that as a likely possibility.</p>
<p>Rather, I think we&rsquo;re kind of run of the mill.</p>
<p>And there are many who are far more advanced than us.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that they would expend the energy</p>
<p>to hide themselves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they care enough.</p>
<p>And so see, that&rsquo;s actually what I believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a very large number of civilizations</p>
<p>that are far more advanced than us.</p>
<p>But my sense is that humans are exceptionally limited</p>
<p>both in our direct sensory capabilities and our physics,</p>
<p>our tools of sensing that just like with the string theory</p>
<p>and the multiple dimensions, we&rsquo;re just not like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I honestly believe there could be stuff</p>
<p>in front of our nose that we&rsquo;re just not seeing</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re too dumb, too much hubris</p>
<p>and I mean, there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>and too ignorant to the fabric of reality,</p>
<p>all of those things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re young in terms of intelligence.</p>
<p>But I guess what I&rsquo;d say is like, I&rsquo;m on board</p>
<p>with all of that as a real possibility,</p>
<p>but then it does strike me that we are sufficiently</p>
<p>able to observe the unit.</p>
<p>Look, we can look back to a fraction of the duration</p>
<p>from here to the, just a fraction is left</p>
<p>that we are unable to see.</p>
<p>So however young we are, we have been able</p>
<p>to sort of pierce the universe and it just strikes me</p>
<p>that there would be some signature,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>But look, having said that I do, look,</p>
<p>I certainly note the fact that it&rsquo;s rare</p>
<p>that I stoop down while walking in Manhattan</p>
<p>and sort of dig up some ants in the bushes</p>
<p>on the side of the street and talk to the ants, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just not interesting to me.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re like the ants on the cosmological landscape,</p>
<p>then yeah, I can imagine that the super advanced aliens</p>
<p>would be like, like whoever, you know,</p>
<p>but I feel like we&rsquo;re sufficiently advanced</p>
<p>that there should be some signal signature of that,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>I think the deeper fundamental problem between us</p>
<p>and the ants is that we don&rsquo;t have a common language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the interest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we don&rsquo;t even have a common language.</p>
<p>And so the alien civilizations don&rsquo;t even know how to,</p>
<p>like we humans have convinced ourselves we&rsquo;re special</p>
<p>because we developed the language.</p>
<p>And you talked about the importance of language</p>
<p>to the intelligence, but it makes you wonder</p>
<p>like how very niche is that like club that we&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>like tribe we&rsquo;ve created of language</p>
<p>and linguistic type of systems that are very specific</p>
<p>to our particular kinds of brains</p>
<p>and we share ideas together are all super excited</p>
<p>that we can understand the universe</p>
<p>because we came up with some notation and math.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s some totally other kinds of language</p>
<p>that communicates on a different timescale</p>
<p>with different, very different mechanisms</p>
<p>in the space of information that just is not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everything, everything is lost in translation.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it could well be as a look.</p>
<p>I mean, I think part of the reason I go</p>
<p>toward the possibility of the soul intelligence</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a certain kind of romantic appeal</p>
<p>to looking out in the cosmos and it&rsquo;s just quiet</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just eternal silence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that appeals to me</p>
<p>at an emotional level that way.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, nobody knows.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly conceivable</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just a radical mismatch</p>
<p>between the kinds of things</p>
<p>that we are able to observe and sensitive to</p>
<p>versus the kinds of structures that permeate the universe</p>
<p>in a manner that simply we&rsquo;re unable to detect.</p>
<p>Well, if we are alone, that is exciting.</p>
<p>And one of the ways it&rsquo;s exciting</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s up to us to become,</p>
<p>to expand out into the universe,</p>
<p>to permeate consciousness out into the universe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where space exploration comes in.</p>
<p>Let me ask you as somebody who&rsquo;s a screen theorist,</p>
<p>a physicist, do you think space exploration,</p>
<p>a colonizing space is a physics or an engineering problem?</p>
<p>What would you say?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s fundamentally an engineering problem</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not trying to do things like build wormholes</p>
<p>the way they did, say an interstellar</p>
<p>to get to a different place</p>
<p>or trying to travel near the speed of light</p>
<p>so that we would actually be able</p>
<p>to traverse interstellar distances.</p>
<p>I mean, without that,</p>
<p>our colonization will happen in a very, very slow rate.</p>
<p>But one of the beauties of relativity</p>
<p>is if you do travel near the speed of light,</p>
<p>you can actually go arbitrarily far in a human lifetime.</p>
<p>People say, how&rsquo;s that possible?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go billions of light years.</p>
<p>Billions of light years, well, you can actually,</p>
<p>because as you can do the speed of light,</p>
<p>the way in which space and time change</p>
<p>allows you to go in principle arbitrarily far.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>But if we put that physics side of the issue</p>
<p>and the manipulation of space and time to the side,</p>
<p>yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a deep engineering problem.</p>
<p>How do you terraform other planets?</p>
<p>I mean, how do you go beyond our local neighborhood,</p>
<p>say without using the ideas of relativity?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s all quite exciting.</p>
<p>And I think the idea is using solar sails</p>
<p>that people have developed</p>
<p>and trying to take that first step to Mars,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a vital and valuable step to take.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think these are</p>
<p>fundamentally engineering challenges.</p>
<p>Or extending the human lifespan through biology research</p>
<p>or maybe reducing what it means to be a human being</p>
<p>into information and uploading certain parts of it.</p>
<p>Maybe not all of the full resolution of a human life,</p>
<p>but maybe the essential things like the DNA</p>
<p>and be able to reconstruct that human being.</p>
<p>But I have to ask about Mars.</p>
<p>Do you find the dream of humans stepping on Mars,</p>
<p>stepping foot first, but also colonizing Mars,</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s worth us fighting for?</p>
<p>Yeah, usually so.</p>
<p>I mean, I think what we have long been</p>
<p>not always in the best way is a species of explorers</p>
<p>in the literal sense of traveling</p>
<p>from one part of the world to another,</p>
<p>or in the more metaphorical sense</p>
<p>of trying to travel through our minds to the quantum realm</p>
<p>or back to the Big Bang or to the center of black holes.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s fundamentally part of the human spirit.</p>
<p>So I do think that&rsquo;s a vital part of our heritage</p>
<p>brought forward into its next incarnation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who we are.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be a day in the future</p>
<p>where a human being is born on Mars</p>
<p>and has to learn about his or her human origins on Earth?</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;ll have to read in a book.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be a book at that stage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll probably just be uploaded into the head or something</p>
<p>or imprinted into the DNA,</p>
<p>and then they just sort of sense it.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think there&rsquo;s, well, look,</p>
<p>the issue you raised before is the vital one.</p>
<p>Is it the case that any sufficiently advanced civilization</p>
<p>destroys itself?</p>
<p>Is that sort of a commonplace quality?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the other potential answer</p>
<p>to the Fermi paradox.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t they here?</p>
<p>Because by the time they got to the technological development</p>
<p>where they could travel here, they blew themselves up.</p>
<p>They destroyed themselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an unfortunate,</p>
<p>but not a hard to imagine possibility</p>
<p>based on things that have happened here on planet Earth.</p>
<p>But putting that to the side,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the big obstacle,</p>
<p>but putting that to the side,</p>
<p>we will resolve the engineering challenges.</p>
<p>And I should probably modify my answer</p>
<p>from before when you said, is it engineering or physics?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really both, right?</p>
<p>So we will surmount the engineering challenges</p>
<p>and that will then make the physics challenges relevant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make it relevant to figure out</p>
<p>how to travel near the speed of light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make it relevant to learn</p>
<p>how to manipulate the shape of space time and so forth.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a multi stage process</p>
<p>where it is engineering and ultimately physics.</p>
<p>And if we stick around long enough,</p>
<p>those are the kinds of challenges</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re ultimately gonna surmount.</p>
<p>And then the physics side is figuring out</p>
<p>how to harness energy enough</p>
<p>to travel outside the solar system,</p>
<p>which seems like a heck of a difficult journey.</p>
<p>But even Mars itself,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe because I was born in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and was born with the,</p>
<p>looking up at the stars and that dream</p>
<p>of like the highest of human achievement</p>
<p>is the ability to fly out there,</p>
<p>to join the stars.</p>
<p>I really liked the idea of going to Mars</p>
<p>and not just stepping foot on Mars.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until maybe misinformed,</p>
<p>but for me personally,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t until Elon Musk started talking</p>
<p>about the colonization of Mars,</p>
<p>did I realize like we humans can actually do that.</p>
<p>And first of all, the importance of somebody saying</p>
<p>that we can do these seemingly impossible things</p>
<p>is immeasurable because the fact that he placed that</p>
<p>into my mind and into the minds of millions of others,</p>
<p>maybe hundreds of millions, maybe billions of others,</p>
<p>young kids today, I mean, that&rsquo;s gonna make it a reality.</p>
<p>I, for some reason, am deeply excited,</p>
<p>even though my work isn&rsquo;t AI that echoes all of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited by the idea that somebody would be born,</p>
<p>as we were saying, on Mars and sort of look up</p>
<p>and be able to see with a telescope Earth</p>
<p>and say, that&rsquo;s where I came from.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that idea scale to other planets,</p>
<p>to other solar systems, that&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>And hugely exciting.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I mean, the vital thing is to dream, right?</p>
<p>I mean, and it sounds hackneyed,</p>
<p>but it is so important for young kids,</p>
<p>for the next generation,</p>
<p>to think about the things that are seemingly impossible.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what makes them possible.</p>
<p>And this is one which is concrete enough.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something that&rsquo;s gonna happen soon</p>
<p>in terms of actually going to Mars.</p>
<p>And then the next step of establishing some presence,</p>
<p>some semi permanent or permanent presence.</p>
<p>This is not something that&rsquo;s gonna wait</p>
<p>to the 25th century.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something that&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>relatively soon.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it could well be in your lifetime,</p>
<p>unlikely mine, but possibly in your lifetime</p>
<p>that that kid will be born</p>
<p>and have the experience that you described.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s spectacularly exciting.</p>
<p>And I actually, I would love to go on Mars</p>
<p>on one of the early.</p>
<p>You would? Yeah.</p>
<p>It would if it&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to do it one way. Really?</p>
<p>Wow. Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m single if there&rsquo;s ladies out there</p>
<p>that wanna start that family.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go out to Mars.</p>
<p>No, I think.</p>
<p>See, I have to tell you something.</p>
<p>You spoke about terror, thinking about like black holes.</p>
<p>If I actually think about going to Mars</p>
<p>and being on Mars and put myself in there fully,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terror inducing.</p>
<p>The idea of to be in this foreign world</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t come back,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve made this choice that can&rsquo;t be reversed.</p>
<p>Well, at some point it may be,</p>
<p>but in that guise, that to me carries a deep sense of terror.</p>
<p>I feel that sense of terror every time Kerouac,</p>
<p>Jack Kerouac talked about this on the road</p>
<p>is when you leave a place, if you&rsquo;re honest about it,</p>
<p>like life is short.</p>
<p>And when you leave a place, you move to a new place</p>
<p>and you think of all the friends, maybe family</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re leaving behind as you drive over the hill,</p>
<p>that really is goodbye.</p>
<p>Like we sometimes don&rsquo;t think of it that way</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re moving, but that really is goodbye to that life,</p>
<p>to the person you were, to all the people.</p>
<p>Maybe if it&rsquo;s close friends, you&rsquo;ll see them maybe 10, 15</p>
<p>more times in your life and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying goodbye to all of that.</p>
<p>And so in the same way, I see it as way more dramatic</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re flying away from earth and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s goodbye to Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s goodbye to whatever, I don&rsquo;t know why I picked</p>
<p>those, but some, all the things that are special to earth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s goodbye, but that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>I suppose more, what excites me about that kind of journey</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a distinct contemplation of your mortality,</p>
<p>acceptance of your mortality.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, just like when you take on any difficult</p>
<p>journey, it&rsquo;s accepting that you&rsquo;re going to die one day</p>
<p>and might as well do something truly exciting.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, I will, you know, I&rsquo;m with you on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a strong believer that deep underneath human motivation</p>
<p>is this terror of our own mortality.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s this a wonderful book that had a great</p>
<p>influence in me called The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker.</p>
<p>And when you are aware of the ways in which our mortality</p>
<p>influences our behaviors, it really does add a different</p>
<p>slant, a different kind of color to the interpretation</p>
<p>of human behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny that that book had a big influence</p>
<p>in me as well.</p>
<p>Oh, is that right?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And the terror management theory and I, again,</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective, I don&rsquo;t know how many</p>
<p>people that book influenced because I talk to people</p>
<p>about the fear of death and it doesn&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>about the fear of death and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be</p>
<p>that fundamental to their experience.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think on the surface it&rsquo;s fundamental</p>
<p>to my experience, but it seems like an awfully,</p>
<p>in terms of we talk about models and strength theory</p>
<p>and theories, in terms of theories of this macro experience</p>
<p>of human life, it seems like a heck of a good theory</p>
<p>that the fear of death is at the kind of is the warm</p>
<p>at the core.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, and the terror management theories</p>
<p>that you make reference to, I mean, this is a group</p>
<p>of psychologists, social psychologists who devise</p>
<p>these very clever experiments, real world experiments</p>
<p>with real people, where you can directly measure</p>
<p>the hidden influence of the recognition</p>
<p>of our own mortality.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve done these experiments where they have</p>
<p>group of people A, group of people B,</p>
<p>and the only difference between the two groups</p>
<p>is that group B, they somehow reminded them</p>
<p>in some subtle way of their own mortality.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s nothing more than interviewing them</p>
<p>with a funeral home across the street.</p>
<p>And influence is there, but it&rsquo;s subtle,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even think you&rsquo;d take note of.</p>
<p>And they can find measurable effects that differentiate</p>
<p>the two groups to a high degree of statistical significance</p>
<p>and how they respond to certain challenges</p>
<p>or certain kinds of questions that shows a direct influence</p>
<p>of the reminder of their own mortality.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve read a number of these studies</p>
<p>and they are really convincing.</p>
<p>And so yeah, I would say that the reason why</p>
<p>so many people would say that, yeah, fear of mortality,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not front and center in my worldview.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t really think about it much,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter too much.</p>
<p>The reason why they&rsquo;re able to say that</p>
<p>is because this thing called culture has emerged</p>
<p>over the course of the last 10,000 years.</p>
<p>And part of the role of culture is to give us a means</p>
<p>of not thinking about our mortality all the time,</p>
<p>of not living in terror of the inevitable end,</p>
<p>which faces us all.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s completely understandable that that&rsquo;s the response</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what culture is at least in part for.</p>
<p>Is it at least possible that the fear of death,</p>
<p>the terror of your mortality is the creative force</p>
<p>that created all of the things around us</p>
<p>at this human civilization?</p>
<p>And I think about from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>this is where I lose all of my robotics colleagues</p>
<p>is I feel like if you want to create intelligence,</p>
<p>you have to also engineer in some kind of echoes</p>
<p>of this kind of fear.</p>
<p>Fear is such a complicated word,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of like a scarcity,</p>
<p>a scarcity of time, a scarcity of resources</p>
<p>that creates a kind of anxiety,</p>
<p>like deadlines get you to do stuff.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something almost fundamental to that</p>
<p>in terms of human experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s an interesting thought.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically in order to create a kind of structure</p>
<p>that mirrors what we call consciousness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d better have that structure confront the same kinds</p>
<p>of issues and terrors that we do.</p>
<p>Consciousness and suffering only makes sense</p>
<p>in the context of death.</p>
<p>If you want to, I feel like,</p>
<p>if you want to fit into human society,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a robot and if you want to fit into human society,</p>
<p>you better have the same kind of existential dread,</p>
<p>the same kind of fear of mortality,</p>
<p>otherwise you&rsquo;re not gonna fit in.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It might be wild, but it&rsquo;s at least,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re talking about all the theories</p>
<p>that are at least worth consideration.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful one.</p>
<p>And definitely one has resonated with me</p>
<p>and definitely seems to capture something</p>
<p>beautifully like real about the human condition.</p>
<p>And I wonder, it&rsquo;s of course,</p>
<p>it sucks to think that we need death to appreciate life,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just maybe the way it is.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting if this robotic</p>
<p>or artificially intelligent system understands the world</p>
<p>and understands the second law of thermodynamics</p>
<p>and entropy, even an artificial intelligence will realize</p>
<p>that even if its parts are really robust,</p>
<p>ultimately it will disintegrate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The timescales may be different,</p>
<p>but in a way, when you think about it, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Once you know that you are mortal</p>
<p>in the sense that you are not eternal,</p>
<p>the timescale hardly matters</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s either the whole thing or not.</p>
<p>Because on the scales of eternity,</p>
<p>any finite duration, however large is effectively zero</p>
<p>on the scales of eternity.</p>
<p>And so maybe it won&rsquo;t be so hard for an artificial system</p>
<p>to feel that sense of mortality</p>
<p>because it will recognize the underlying physical laws</p>
<p>and recognize its own finitude.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;ll be us and robots drinking beers,</p>
<p>looking up at the stars and just,</p>
<p>having a good laugh in awe of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good way to end it,</p>
<p>talking about the fear of death.</p>
<p>We started talking about the meaning of life</p>
<p>and ended on the fear of death.</p>
<p>Brian, this is an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>My pleasure, thank you.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it enormously.</p>
<p>I really, really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of your work, a huge fan of your writing.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking to me, Brian.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Brian Greene.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Bill Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Physics is really nothing more</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;than a search for ultimate simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But so far, all we have is a kind of elegant messiness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
