<p>think so uh sometimes people take like</p>
<p>one or two but actually you need like</p>
<p>five or six per meal and start to build</p>
<p>it up and it does take some time</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one thing that might help you</p>
<p>the other thing with the eggs is to try</p>
<p>duck eggs i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>that yet</p>
<p>um but they&rsquo;re uh</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re quite delicious and usually</p>
<p>people can do duck eggs if they have an</p>
<p>allergy to chicken eggs and then the</p>
<p>other thing is that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really curious if you ever tried</p>
<p>um some real healthy</p>
<p>eggs from a farm that like we have like</p>
<p>that you actually</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any of this garbage and</p>
<p>i wonder if you would be</p>
<p>allergic or not that would be</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>right definitely tried that and i tried</p>
<p>a year of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>ox bile</p>
<p>you know all the things about the</p>
<p>digestion which are very important</p>
<p>um and so far so i haven&rsquo;t tried</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>because my issue is not what a lot of</p>
<p>people is i don&rsquo;t need to lose weight i</p>
<p>need to actually gain weight</p>
<p>and build more muscle because i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>getting the nutrients that i would like</p>
<p>to get</p>
<p>right good point um</p>
<p>well um in the meantime you know you</p>
<p>could do the fish just seafood um</p>
<p>the other thing too if you do no you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>something in the proteins</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not being able to break down and</p>
<p>digest</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t stay down</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s stomach acids yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something stomach acids uh the other</p>
<p>thing is um</p>
<p>possibly probiotics possibly i don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i do have autoimmune which is what a lot</p>
<p>of people suffer on so i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>thought that that might be an issue as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>hashimoto&rsquo;s is my beast</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah okay</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>one more thing in the meantime if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not able to consume some of these</p>
<p>proteins it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a really good um</p>
<p>product it&rsquo;s a keto aminos which uh um</p>
<p>that way you don&rsquo;t have to even</p>
<p>break anything down it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>interesting unique blend</p>
<p>that um instead of um</p>
<p>most amino acid blends you&rsquo;re wasting</p>
<p>like the great majority because it turns</p>
<p>into sugar this one right um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re utilizing 99 of it so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole patent that was</p>
<p>i private labeled it but there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>patent on it that is fascinating because</p>
<p>this blend is used by athletes to</p>
<p>get all the the basic building blocks</p>
<p>that you need and it kind of goes in</p>
<p>like a rocket ship because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to break it down</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to build muscle</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t really do yes these other</p>
<p>proteins especially eggs</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s another thing perfect thank</p>
<p>you so much you&rsquo;re welcome try that out</p>
<p>let us know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great now tell you what amy if</p>
<p>you need to gain weight you just hang</p>
<p>around me for a week or two and i</p>
<p>guarantee you&rsquo;ll pack it on</p>
<p>so good luck on that right uh and also</p>
<p>uh as a bonus for your great</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to put out our first quiz</p>
<p>question and dr berg would you read that</p>
<p>for us</p>
<p>okay what is the most</p>
<p>common symptom of dehydration</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first symptom i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the first question</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great so climb on that</p>
<p>audience we got some great interesting</p>
<p>questions today i can&rsquo;t wait to hear</p>
<p>uh the answer to many of them and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>uh social media in just a moment please</p>
<p>we got tons of people on there oh in</p>
<p>fact why don&rsquo;t we talk about where tons</p>
<p>of people are coming from</p>
<p>see if i&rsquo;ve got that from terry yet</p>
<p>not yet well the heck with it how about</p>
<p>we start with rachel from scotland on</p>
<p>youtube i was a vegan</p>
<p>uh on raw food for years and now finding</p>
<p>it difficult to transition to keto boy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like amy</p>
<p>i am a mother of three teen girls should</p>
<p>they transition as well what can you do</p>
<p>for that family</p>
<p>yeah just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot more difficult to get all the</p>
<p>key nutrients um especially the forms of</p>
<p>nutrients that you need uh like when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re vegan you have all like the pre</p>
<p>vitamin a</p>
<p>that has to be converted</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have the actual retinol</p>
<p>and then you have the b12 and then you</p>
<p>have the pre-omega-3</p>
<p>uh fatty acids so you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>actual dha unless unless you really know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing and you take algae and</p>
<p>things like that so it&rsquo;s more difficult</p>
<p>um also even like zinc for example the</p>
<p>the best source of zinc</p>
<p>um is not from vegetables it&rsquo;s from uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>red meat</p>
<p>uh so</p>
<p>in other animal products so you</p>
<p>honestly i think it&rsquo;s you should make</p>
<p>the transition and</p>
<p>do what you can do a little bit you know</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;re not allergic to eggs</p>
<p>like amy</p>
<p>because eggs are just such a</p>
<p>good source of protein</p>
<p>but there are other sources so</p>
<p>there has to be something that you can</p>
<p>you can do um but especially with the</p>
<p>kids you know um</p>
<p>the key is especially as a child</p>
<p>develops they need all these key</p>
<p>nutrients</p>
<p>especially like the fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>that sometimes you don&rsquo;t necessarily get</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing animal products so</p>
<p>that being said the answer would be yes</p>
<p>wonderful i&rsquo;m sure this is this person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>real name desert love from youtube what</p>
<p>is the best probiotic to take if you</p>
<p>have ulcer</p>
<p>ulcerative colitis i butchered that</p>
<p>rachel from scotland on you oh i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the question so what can they do</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s probiotic yeah of course um you</p>
<p>know i&rsquo;m completely unbiased of my own</p>
<p>probiotic</p>
<p>but i would recommend my own probiotic</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a liquid it passes through</p>
<p>the gut lining without being destroyed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very interesting combination</p>
<p>of not just friendly bacteria but</p>
<p>friendly yeast as well</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it it works i i love it um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one that would help you</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s inflammation right in your gut</p>
<p>and one of the one of the purposes of</p>
<p>good microbes is to reduce inflammation</p>
<p>and if you take a look at someone that</p>
<p>has chronic inflammation it usually</p>
<p>stems from antibiotics which destroy the</p>
<p>flora</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you know just like um</p>
<p>like a baby</p>
<p>an infant that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when they come out they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that good bacteria initially so</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re inoculated with</p>
<p>colostrum from breast milk</p>
<p>and also from the microbes from the</p>
<p>mother</p>
<p>so if you have a child that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>breastfed that is given a c-section</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have that flora</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>the good bacteria so it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>even growing trying to grow a plant with</p>
<p>a seed on sterile</p>
<p>like um i don&rsquo;t know coconut filter</p>
<p>without</p>
<p>putting the good inoculation of good</p>
<p>bacteria in there to start out you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>notice that plant doesn&rsquo;t survive as</p>
<p>well same thing with humans so we need</p>
<p>this flora and if we don&rsquo;t have it we</p>
<p>get inflammation and we get all sorts of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>irritable bowel syndromes and</p>
<p>so yeah the microbes are vital</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>latasha from youtube what should i do</p>
<p>for pain in my legs and feet from edema</p>
<p>ouch</p>
<p>well i would if you&rsquo;re having an edema</p>
<p>chances are there might be possibly</p>
<p>um too many carbs in your diet because</p>
<p>um you know the my</p>
<p>answer to all these things is are you</p>
<p>doing the standard version of keto um</p>
<p>if you are i highly doubt you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have this edema in your legs so so</p>
<p>once you do that first and i bet you</p>
<p>that will solve it and um and the</p>
<p>healthy version of it so you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>enough potassium to drive out this fluid</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you need to start with uh if</p>
<p>you want to know more information if you</p>
<p>just go to drburg.com and right on the</p>
<p>front page if you scroll down</p>
<p>i even you can just download the diet</p>
<p>right there and explains what to do</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to buy anything just</p>
<p>download the diet start</p>
<p>and uh get the results that&rsquo;s right call</p>
<p>prevention right don&rsquo;t fix a problem um</p>
<p>keep it from happening</p>
<p>uh and it was no problem avoidance how</p>
<p>about that there you go because i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even also nowadays illegal to</p>
<p>prevent something so</p>
<p>we can legally avoid it</p>
<p>good point avoid a disease i like that</p>
<p>keep that in mind i do</p>
<p>who wants a disease all right well the</p>
<p>audience was right on it with quiz</p>
<p>question number one which asked</p>
<p>what is the most common symptom</p>
<p>of the dreaded</p>
<p>dehydration</p>
<p>and 45 say</p>
<p>darker urine 30 say dry mouth</p>
<p>and 20 percent</p>
<p>say constipation and the five last five</p>
<p>percent say headaches</p>
<p>are they on to something doc wow</p>
<p>uh well the number one is the fatigue</p>
<p>actually you get tired oh audience</p>
<p>yep</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that is the uh</p>
<p>one of the symptoms i mean take it take</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>just think about this um</p>
<p>when you start keto</p>
<p>and you lose all this fluid right</p>
<p>and you lose your electrolytes um what</p>
<p>mineral</p>
<p>causes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like a weakness or fatigue like a loss</p>
<p>of one mineral which would be sodium</p>
<p>so having that</p>
<p>that balance of fluids</p>
<p>uh very very important</p>
<p>for to keep you strong</p>
<p>and to have energy</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um when you&rsquo;re dehydrated you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>also the electrolytes too so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just the lack of water</p>
<p>and so these things these lack of</p>
<p>electrolytes can give you</p>
<p>fatigue both potassium and sodium</p>
<p>interesting okay that&rsquo;s why we have</p>
<p>gatorade right steve you bet you know</p>
<p>when i was in high school i didn&rsquo;t play</p>
<p>football</p>
<p>uh i heard another call but the ones</p>
<p>that did the coach would give them salt</p>
<p>pills and i don&rsquo;t know you know to</p>
<p>which somehow remedied something or</p>
<p>prevented something is that still in</p>
<p>vogue or do people say you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have a heart attack yeah totally you</p>
<p>want to do sea salt pills but i mean if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>football practice or you&rsquo;re sweating a</p>
<p>lot or a soccer practice and you</p>
<p>sweating and you&rsquo;re not taking</p>
<p>electrolytes</p>
<p>try to maintain a high level of energy</p>
<p>good luck it&rsquo;s not going to happen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be tired you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>feel weak</p>
<p>what you need is some salt</p>
<p>wonderful gary from facebook what is the</p>
<p>effect of coffee on your adrenals</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>too much of it</p>
<p>uh will stimulate cortisol</p>
<p>and cortisol will then keep you from</p>
<p>sleeping so you&rsquo;re going to be tired the</p>
<p>next day um like if you drink a lot of</p>
<p>it and of course</p>
<p>i stick with like one</p>
<p>one small little cup i should bring my</p>
<p>little cup in there it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a tea cup i&rsquo;ll drink that and i&rsquo;m good</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i used to drink a lot more a couple pots</p>
<p>a day and that&rsquo;s literally what</p>
<p>contributed to my burnt out adrenals</p>
<p>because the constant stimulation</p>
<p>you know you know it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because people drink coffee to stay</p>
<p>awake</p>
<p>um but it ends up making them asleep</p>
<p>during the day</p>
<p>because then all of a sudden you need</p>
<p>more and more to create the same effect</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;re always kind of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tired and you&rsquo;re you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the energy and you&rsquo;re not sleeping</p>
<p>so it really has a rebound effect so</p>
<p>then we have to transition to something</p>
<p>like red bull</p>
<p>to really create the effect</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s tough um so and i love</p>
<p>coffee by the way how does tea like iced</p>
<p>tea stack up against in terms of</p>
<p>caffeine or whatever it&rsquo;s better because</p>
<p>it has less caffeine</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>yeah um</p>
<p>i mean you could do naturally</p>
<p>decaffeinated that&rsquo;s really good as well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some great um phytonutrients and</p>
<p>teas that can help you in all sorts of</p>
<p>ways from stress relief to blood sugars</p>
<p>to um</p>
<p>helping you lose weight because it makes</p>
<p>insulin more sensitive so just did a</p>
<p>video on that um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been tracking with my videos</p>
<p>wonderful okay let&rsquo;s see how astute the</p>
<p>audience is on this now we&rsquo;ll i want to</p>
<p>tease them but there was a hundred</p>
<p>percent failure in the first question</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s give them another chance go ahead</p>
<p>and read this doc</p>
<p>all right so</p>
<p>why should you never drink</p>
<p>seawater if you get stranded</p>
<p>at sea</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re you know you ran on water</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in this boat and um</p>
<p>nothing no no help in sight</p>
<p>should you drink a little seawater or</p>
<p>not that&rsquo;s the question or actually this</p>
<p>is true or false right</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s the the question</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s bring it up again just to clarify</p>
<p>uh yeah why should you never drink salt</p>
<p>water if you get a stranded disease okay</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just an answer yeah that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>so why shouldn&rsquo;t you okay and if your</p>
<p>mother-in-law is on board how can you</p>
<p>encourage her to drink salt uh see</p>
<p>seawater</p>
<p>separately steve you&rsquo;re gonna get some</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get some comments on that</p>
<p>oh well many many agree all right now</p>
<p>listen no actually i love my</p>
<p>mother-in-law it&rsquo;s all fine but i</p>
<p>digress okay let&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>another question here</p>
<p>shabazz from facebook how can i reduce</p>
<p>uric acid naturally sounds like gout</p>
<p>well the one thing you could do is you</p>
<p>can um realize that the ph of the urine</p>
<p>if you bring up</p>
<p>the ph to make it a little bit more</p>
<p>alkaline</p>
<p>then those uh then you&rsquo;ll have less gout</p>
<p>symptoms so how do you do that well</p>
<p>you can consume more</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>or electrolyte called potassium citrate</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>lemons believe it or not will help</p>
<p>to the gout symptoms but really what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dealing with is we&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>a lot of purines and so you got purines</p>
<p>in like</p>
<p>organ meats</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing too much protein animal</p>
<p>protein and you&rsquo;re doing maybe</p>
<p>chocolate</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s certain triggers</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s i would work on your ph and uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then watch my video on gout there</p>
<p>are there are certain remedies that you</p>
<p>can do like celery seed</p>
<p>extract um things like that</p>
<p>wonderful okay well you know we have</p>
<p>this interesting green room lineup we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got samir from saudi arabia we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>israel we have got um</p>
<p>moody from south africa and we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to put you guys on the air yet but</p>
<p>i just wanted to say to indicate that we</p>
<p>have worldwide interest in your show and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the rest of them we&rsquo;ve got people</p>
<p>coming in from the uk canada thailand</p>
<p>france south africa morocco india</p>
<p>germany pakistan israel we said belgium</p>
<p>denmark algeria</p>
<p>kazakhstan puerto rico mexico norway</p>
<p>taiwan oops my thing slipped trinidad</p>
<p>chile czech republic egypt we have saudi</p>
<p>arabia which i guess is somewhat close</p>
<p>to all that zambia sweden switzerland</p>
<p>peru and all across the united states so</p>
<p>thanks everybody around the world for</p>
<p>your patronage on the show and all you</p>
<p>folks waiting uh patiently in the green</p>
<p>room for us and let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>adrianzi what a name from facebook sorry</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t mean to tease you like that i</p>
<p>have no thyroid or gallbladder and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>entering menopause ouch should i still</p>
<p>do the same keto and iaf as everyone</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>well yeah i would recommend that you do</p>
<p>this same with a little tweak um realize</p>
<p>that uh</p>
<p>you know even if you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>thyroid you can still exist fine</p>
<p>with taking your thyroid hormones</p>
<p>as long as you get them adjusted quite</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>but as far as without a gallbladder then</p>
<p>you may benefit from a gallbladder</p>
<p>formula</p>
<p>which will actually help you aid in the</p>
<p>digestions of fat because what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen now you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>concentrated</p>
<p>effect and so now we&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>less bile less digestion</p>
<p>of the vitamin a</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>d</p>
<p>k 1 k 2 omega 3 fatty acids</p>
<p>so now we have to be aware that you</p>
<p>might be deficient in some of those and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be driving at night and trying to</p>
<p>see in the dark and you can&rsquo;t quite see</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the vitamin a deficiency so</p>
<p>you can be eating foods with vitamin a</p>
<p>and these other vitamins but they just</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be absorbed so you might want to</p>
<p>add the bile salts</p>
<p>i would recommend the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula with the meal</p>
<p>to help you extract</p>
<p>the nutrients because now</p>
<p>you just have a little tube without the</p>
<p>gallbladder that just trickles bile this</p>
<p>trickles down but not in a concentrated</p>
<p>amount</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what i would recommend</p>
<p>all right very good well i recommend we</p>
<p>get the answers to the second question</p>
<p>and as we all recall the poor audience</p>
<p>struck out on the first one and it asked</p>
<p>why should you never drink seawater if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stranded at sea and they put</p>
<p>everything on black a hundred percent of</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>responded say will actually cause</p>
<p>dehydration because of the high salt</p>
<p>levels they are correct this time</p>
<p>because what happens um</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>concentrated salt</p>
<p>and you are literally</p>
<p>pulling any and all water</p>
<p>out of your system</p>
<p>and your</p>
<p>your kidneys</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t help but get rid of the salt and</p>
<p>the little bit of water you have left so</p>
<p>basically you accelerate the death</p>
<p>process you accelerate your</p>
<p>dehydration problem so</p>
<p>i know the temptation is going to be</p>
<p>there steve to just drink that water but</p>
<p>that would be a huge mistake because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to last as long if you</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t drink anything</p>
<p>wow there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s something called</p>
<p>dry fasting where you&rsquo;re not drinking</p>
<p>any water</p>
<p>um and believe it or not</p>
<p>uh your body does have</p>
<p>somewhat of an ability to make water out</p>
<p>of your fat</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>some people have lived</p>
<p>more than three days without</p>
<p>water</p>
<p>just fyi</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>okay well listen from across the world</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got samir from saudi arabia</p>
<p>and he also is a</p>
<p>resident of ottawa poor guy&rsquo;s flying all</p>
<p>over the world constantly and samir</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wrong with dr burr</p>
<p>hi dr berg it&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you</p>
<p>thank you and thank you so much for all</p>
<p>the great work that you&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s benefiting everyone</p>
<p>so my question is a cholesterol question</p>
<p>just to give you a bit of a background i</p>
<p>just completed my 12 weeks of keto</p>
<p>and it was a mostly positive experience</p>
<p>i did have</p>
<p>a little bit of nausea and a little bit</p>
<p>of weakness here and there</p>
<p>but apart from that it was it was good</p>
<p>and i feel better than i did before i</p>
<p>lost 20 pounds</p>
<p>so my question is</p>
<p>i went i got my blood works and i was a</p>
<p>bit alarmed</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve just to give you a background i</p>
<p>have seen your videos on cholesterol so</p>
<p>i was expecting a bit of a spike</p>
<p>but my triglyceride levels they almost</p>
<p>went up by 70</p>
<p>and my white blood cells they dropped my</p>
<p>red blood cells went up</p>
<p>mpv went up as well the only thing which</p>
<p>kind of improved was my sugar the hpa1c</p>
<p>that dropped</p>
<p>by about 0.3</p>
<p>so i was wondering because i</p>
<p>did a quite a standard diet i was eating</p>
<p>eggs in the morning</p>
<p>i was having a little bit of butter and</p>
<p>i was having salmon at least three to</p>
<p>four days a week for lunch and i was</p>
<p>eating meat in the evening and some</p>
<p>vegetables so the triglyceride part</p>
<p>threw me off that how did they go up so</p>
<p>much</p>
<p>well um</p>
<p>honestly i i think um think about this</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;ve lost weight you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning fat you have all these</p>
<p>other great things</p>
<p>do you know what fat is made out of</p>
<p>mostly</p>
<p>triglycerides yes</p>
<p>so naturally those fats have to come out</p>
<p>they have to come out</p>
<p>of your body and they can they go</p>
<p>through the liver and they can end up in</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re not utilizing all this</p>
<p>energy if you&rsquo;re not exercising with all</p>
<p>this this new energy that&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>and using up all this fat then it has to</p>
<p>come out through the system</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>and i think this is a transition period</p>
<p>for you</p>
<p>i would highly recommend you get an</p>
<p>advanced lipid profile if it concerns</p>
<p>you and you could look at</p>
<p>look at the the</p>
<p>indicators of um the ldl the different</p>
<p>particle sizes of ldl and i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>videos on this um</p>
<p>but i</p>
<p>i i do not think it&rsquo;s a thing that could</p>
<p>be concerned um</p>
<p>ivor cummins um you should watch his</p>
<p>videos and even you can reach out and</p>
<p>contact him and if you&rsquo;re concerned and</p>
<p>maybe even consult with him and he can</p>
<p>go through your numbers and help you do</p>
<p>a deep dive</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like he has his sorry who did he mention</p>
<p>ivor cummins</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a really knowledgeable guy and</p>
<p>cholesterol he&rsquo;s done he&rsquo;s done youtube</p>
<p>videos and he spoke at</p>
<p>both of my uh summits</p>
<p>flew him out and the guy is a</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a biochemical engineer so he knows</p>
<p>a lot about biochemistry like he</p>
<p>inside it out he&rsquo;s done a thorough</p>
<p>study on it and uh he can give you a</p>
<p>little bit additional data i think</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s way more important than this test</p>
<p>that you just had done is to get a cac</p>
<p>which is a</p>
<p>calcium</p>
<p>or a coronary artery calcium test just</p>
<p>to see if your arteries are calcified</p>
<p>but i think really what&rsquo;s happening is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>fat is going through the system</p>
<p>triglycerides is going through</p>
<p>i bet you</p>
<p>if you started exercising more</p>
<p>give it a couple weeks and then retest</p>
<p>and see what happens the other thing too</p>
<p>did you fast before this test</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>about 12 13 hours</p>
<p>yeah and so think about what happens</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fasting you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>some serious fat burning</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming right out so i think um</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t be concerned i would also</p>
<p>retest it maybe in another couple weeks</p>
<p>and add more exercise and then also</p>
<p>you can also add</p>
<p>the the gallbladder formula the bile</p>
<p>salts to help</p>
<p>break up some of the um the fats</p>
<p>if there is still some fat in your liver</p>
<p>that could be</p>
<p>an issue um that&rsquo;s what you can do about</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>a really good profile</p>
<p>sorry to interrupt you yeah i am taking</p>
<p>the gallbladder formula just a question</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>should i be taking the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula after the meal and i&rsquo;m also</p>
<p>taking your advanced digestive formula</p>
<p>so how do i combine these two</p>
<p>yeah you want to take</p>
<p>you always want to take the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula after the meal</p>
<p>and you want to take the digestive</p>
<p>the advance digestion before the meal</p>
<p>that way um</p>
<p>we have the because if you take the</p>
<p>bowel sauce before the meal you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>tendency to dilute the stomach acids</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s alkaline</p>
<p>so i would just take that one after</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and i can take up to one two three</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no uh</p>
<p>restriction on that not a problem okay</p>
<p>thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome thank</p>
<p>you samir safe flying</p>
<p>uh doc by the way if you want to go to</p>
<p>your auxiliary camera your battery just</p>
<p>bombed out and okay so let me um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;re going to put up a very</p>
<p>festive sign in the meantime</p>
<p>and i tell you what doc while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working that out i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>go to another question</p>
<p>and terang from youtube how long does it</p>
<p>take for</p>
<p>b12 uh to levels to drop to normal level</p>
<p>if i uh stop supplementation so she</p>
<p>quits taking vitamins how long before</p>
<p>she goes back to the dreadful normal</p>
<p>um i don&rsquo;t know i i think it um</p>
<p>could take uh</p>
<p>two to three weeks i would imagine</p>
<p>um yeah but i&rsquo;m not sure a hundred</p>
<p>percent so</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have to test the waters</p>
<p>and find out interesting all right well</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;ve been chowing down on nutritional</p>
<p>yeast so i&rsquo;m not about to find out when</p>
<p>it drops because i ain&rsquo;t quitting</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see nubian queen i&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>her name do you have a hormonal package</p>
<p>available i&rsquo;m taking estrogen with dim</p>
<p>right now but still having hot flashes</p>
<p>i would take my seat help and i would</p>
<p>also take the uh cruciferous</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>those two are really good and and</p>
<p>i think that will handle it but for some</p>
<p>weird reason it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>then add in some</p>
<p>vitamin e you can just get that get the</p>
<p>tocatrinos because sometimes you need</p>
<p>some vitamin e the pituitary after</p>
<p>menopause</p>
<p>tends to</p>
<p>be go deficient in vitamin e because you</p>
<p>need that vitamin d to help with the sex</p>
<p>hormones as the hormones go down to the</p>
<p>gonads so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>having babies anymore that tends to dry</p>
<p>up and then you need and then your</p>
<p>vitamin e dries up so and then the hot</p>
<p>flashes can kick in there so vitamin e</p>
<p>is another</p>
<p>thing that i use as the last resort so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget about that</p>
<p>all right terrific and let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>oh mary from youtube wants to know if</p>
<p>sprouted grain bread</p>
<p>is okay on keto</p>
<p>is it non-gmo gmo organic the way she</p>
<p>puts it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not okay because it&rsquo;s a grain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s probably non-gmo</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to be talking about that</p>
<p>in one of the questions so i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to give that away but um yeah it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>part of the keto plan</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>i am looking at</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>having a list kind of a doctor approved</p>
<p>dr berg approved</p>
<p>keto foods on my website</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m finding</p>
<p>even these keto certifications that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re just allowing all</p>
<p>sorts of</p>
<p>things into the um</p>
<p>into the uh</p>
<p>into your diet that shouldn&rsquo;t be there</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>work on that so stay tuned for that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be on the website so that way you</p>
<p>can kind of see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good on keto and what&rsquo;s not good on keto</p>
<p>to make it really simple all right good</p>
<p>well speaking of gmo and so on here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our next question</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>does the term non-gmo</p>
<p>mean the same as gmo free</p>
<p>all right dig into that audience</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s uh i tell why don&rsquo;t we go uh</p>
<p>back to our green room and we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>nancy uh her camera isn&rsquo;t uh working for</p>
<p>us but uh she is has a question for you</p>
<p>so nancy go ahead with dr berg with your</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>dr berg thank you very much for all the</p>
<p>help you&rsquo;ve given me already i&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>results already after a month</p>
<p>however i am the thyroid body type and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m keeping my carbs under 20 grams a</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>because of that so i can have weight</p>
<p>loss but i&rsquo;m still getting the sweet</p>
<p>cravings i&rsquo;m sticking to keto desserts</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still the cravings are still</p>
<p>there and i immediately go to sleep</p>
<p>afterwards</p>
<p>okay how many meals a day do you have</p>
<p>two i&rsquo;m doing the intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and i eat about two in about seven</p>
<p>um okay so you have cravings but what</p>
<p>about your actual hunger</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t get hungry until like two or</p>
<p>three</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>do you ever eat when you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>or do you kind of follow</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re hungry you eat</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah i think um</p>
<p>i think what&rsquo;s happening right now is</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>i would</p>
<p>honestly start working on</p>
<p>adding just a little more fat to your</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>and going for that omad one meal a day</p>
<p>because i think you just need a you need</p>
<p>more time for your body to really adapt</p>
<p>to that fat to the point where those</p>
<p>ketones are</p>
<p>really satisfying any cravings at all</p>
<p>the problem with the even the keto</p>
<p>treats even though they&rsquo;re better</p>
<p>is that some of them especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re buying them</p>
<p>or they can they can affect the blood</p>
<p>sugars what&rsquo;s that i&rsquo;m making all my own</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>i make everything from scratch</p>
<p>okay good um how long you&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>this for</p>
<p>a month okay you know what</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think this is abnormal i think</p>
<p>you just need to ride the wave it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to get better with time but</p>
<p>what you can do is you can um just</p>
<p>try like heck to go one meal a day</p>
<p>and i bet you anything that will just be</p>
<p>the huge difference that you that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make them</p>
<p>that will make everything work um you</p>
<p>know a month</p>
<p>sometimes it takes</p>
<p>actually three months to really get</p>
<p>make a dent into insulin resistance</p>
<p>especially if you have your whole life</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>not being</p>
<p>in keto and so i think this is not a bad</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s not an abnormal thing</p>
<p>give it more time try to shoot for one</p>
<p>meal a day and realize that the magic</p>
<p>will happen</p>
<p>a little bit more when you fast and then</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>as you go closer to the three-month mark</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when like your body&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>finally adapted but</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what i would</p>
<p>recommend now should i do that one meal</p>
<p>a day over a time period like</p>
<p>within an hour or two hours or</p>
<p>yeah try to do it within an hour that</p>
<p>would be great um and don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to restrict the amount of food</p>
<p>that you eat like really have a a decent</p>
<p>large meal um</p>
<p>with enough fat</p>
<p>your meals and your you eat a lot more</p>
<p>than i do</p>
<p>i know i hear you so maybe you spread it</p>
<p>out for uh you know a couple hours at</p>
<p>first so you can ease into this but um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you like</p>
<p>anyone over the age of 45 should be</p>
<p>doing should really strive to do</p>
<p>um one meal a day just because they they</p>
<p>need it especially if the thyroid is</p>
<p>involved the metabolism is slow um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get some results with two two</p>
<p>meals but they&rsquo;ll get the magic will</p>
<p>happen with one meal</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;ll work on that over the next</p>
<p>month thank you all right awesome thanks</p>
<p>nancy thanks so much nancy</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see uh we have answers to quiz</p>
<p>question number three</p>
<p>which asked does the term non-gmo mean</p>
<p>the same as gmo free</p>
<p>and our audience ninety percent of them</p>
<p>said no and ten percent said yes it does</p>
<p>what say you doctor</p>
<p>well the majority is correct because if</p>
<p>you ever look at uh the label on the</p>
<p>non-gmo</p>
<p>it will usually say</p>
<p>non-gmo</p>
<p>verified project</p>
<p>now what is verified project it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a project that goes through a whole</p>
<p>list of things that</p>
<p>um they check for</p>
<p>um it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s organic</p>
<p>it just means that there&rsquo;s a potential</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>non-gmo foods but it could still have</p>
<p>gmos in there because it&rsquo;s a project</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not non-gmo and uh unfortunately</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a what&rsquo;s a non-profit</p>
<p>independent organization</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so you could still have like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the damage of gmo foods is it the gmo is</p>
<p>it the genetically modified organism or</p>
<p>is it the pesticides they spray on it or</p>
<p>the herbicides glyphosate</p>
<p>glyphosate that&rsquo;s the problem with gmo</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>they make these foods resistance</p>
<p>resistant to this thing but then they</p>
<p>can spray more of it so</p>
<p>just because something is gmo free does</p>
<p>not mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s glyphosate free</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a step up</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s this doesn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really free of gmos</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>all right well let&rsquo;s see here i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry to</p>
<p>tell you that steve but i had to get it</p>
<p>out i know well i suspected my double</p>
<p>cheeseburger was not gmo free so it</p>
<p>confirms that sure anyway tanzila from</p>
<p>youtube uh and boy amy&rsquo;s onto something</p>
<p>today i&rsquo;m allergic to all kinds of fish</p>
<p>can you recommend a vegetarian source of</p>
<p>omega-3s in supplement form</p>
<p>yeah yeah there&rsquo;s um there&rsquo;s all sorts</p>
<p>of um algae that you can get</p>
<p>that that will give you the omega-3 dha</p>
<p>so you just look for the supplements uh</p>
<p>that are a vegan source uh</p>
<p>um and you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll find them all over</p>
<p>the place so that&rsquo;ll help you with your</p>
<p>your dha which is a um</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acid</p>
<p>wonderful well i&rsquo;ll tell you what um</p>
<p>gratitude abounds in the dr uh berg</p>
<p>world uh here tim and sheila from</p>
<p>facebook said they&rsquo;ve been battling</p>
<p>sugar addiction for 20 years blood sugar</p>
<p>is now 84. this is life-saving thank you</p>
<p>dr berg so</p>
<p>there you have it and you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give any advice right you didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything bad</p>
<p>what happens when the when you do keto</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting is that your</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice your blood sugars start</p>
<p>coming down into the lower range and</p>
<p>sometimes people get concerned like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re concerned but they have they</p>
<p>feel great</p>
<p>i would not worry about that because</p>
<p>think about you&rsquo;re not eating sugar so</p>
<p>your amount of sugar in your blood is</p>
<p>going to be less</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only when you feel bad like when i</p>
<p>did the uh the colon cleanse with</p>
<p>bernard jensen you do this week of colon</p>
<p>cleansing and</p>
<p>then what you do is you um</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t eat anything</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re taking these supplements</p>
<p>psyllium husk</p>
<p>powder with apple juice so we have this</p>
<p>apple juice through the day right</p>
<p>so you should never never do a fast with</p>
<p>juice or sugar because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never get into ketosis and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be literally tortured because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have all the cravings</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be trying to</p>
<p>get run on this little bit of sugar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>torture and so i dreamt about eating</p>
<p>pizza</p>
<p>24 7</p>
<p>from that week because i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even tell you to take sea salt</p>
<p>you know and then</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>boy did i carve out after that</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>well gene from facebook wants to know</p>
<p>which source of vitamin e do you</p>
<p>recommend and importantly how much</p>
<p>should we take daily</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t have a brand but i would</p>
<p>recommend trying to find tocotrinols</p>
<p>i like 300 milligrams per day um but the</p>
<p>tocotrienols</p>
<p>are a superior</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>type of vitamin e as part of the complex</p>
<p>code they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re um they work 50</p>
<p>times stronger so might as well</p>
<p>get the ones that are really good and</p>
<p>especially</p>
<p>for the inside of the arteries for the</p>
<p>heart i mean it&rsquo;s just a dynamite</p>
<p>remedy for that</p>
<p>all right terrific let&rsquo;s see where the</p>
<p>heck are we why don&rsquo;t we do another quiz</p>
<p>question for goodness sakes</p>
<p>okay and here you go doc</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>how can</p>
<p>a synthetic antioxidant trigger cancer</p>
<p>so you buy all these</p>
<p>like even vitamin c</p>
<p>vitamin e</p>
<p>antioxidants that are made synthetically</p>
<p>if you look up on the research on it um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been linked to getting cancer like</p>
<p>wait a second an antioxidant causing</p>
<p>cancer</p>
<p>how could that be why is that</p>
<p>interesting okay we have a veteran on</p>
<p>the show inez i always butcher her name</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s on with us this is her third</p>
<p>time and she&rsquo;s going to demonstrate how</p>
<p>to ask one question in 30 seconds inez</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with dr berg</p>
<p>hi thank you i appreciate having this</p>
<p>time dr berg my question rebates to sibo</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>chrome i forgot the other oh psoriasis</p>
<p>wow okay and your question is</p>
<p>how does it relate you mean</p>
<p>no no no i was waiting for your question</p>
<p>in relation to it so i um</p>
<p>i started your intermittent fasting last</p>
<p>july</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>did pretty well and hit a couple</p>
<p>plateaus but then</p>
<p>come</p>
<p>march</p>
<p>after i s</p>
<p>come march</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>i started increasing my</p>
<p>greens to</p>
<p>four cups a day</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>by the end of march my kids were</p>
<p>complaining that my breath was really</p>
<p>bad so i looked it up</p>
<p>and i</p>
<p>watched a couple of your videos one on</p>
<p>bad breath and then the one on sibo and</p>
<p>it sounds like it&rsquo;s sibo</p>
<p>so i started</p>
<p>the carnivore diet</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>my concern with the carnivore diet is</p>
<p>well i got psoriasis up here above my</p>
<p>eyebrow and</p>
<p>so i went and read on the psoriasis and</p>
<p>it has to do with</p>
<p>a balance take a vitamin d and a balance</p>
<p>between omega-3 and omega-6 correct me</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m wrong when i can</p>
<p>and so i</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;m getting this backwards</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>so now i</p>
<p>am vacillating or yo-yoing between</p>
<p>the sibo issue and the psoriasis and</p>
<p>acid reflux issue acid reflux issue</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>okay so let me just kind of give you</p>
<p>some my two cents on that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stuck between a rock and a hard</p>
<p>place so we have to probably fix one</p>
<p>thing before the other i would i would</p>
<p>not focus on the um psoriasis</p>
<p>right off the bat even though it could</p>
<p>be related i would focus on the placebo</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now the thing is with the sibo is that</p>
<p>we if you add too much fiber</p>
<p>into the gut or even a probiotic</p>
<p>then the microbes start eating that and</p>
<p>they start growing and bloating and the</p>
<p>whole thing so really</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re left with</p>
<p>doing a lot of fasting</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>should be</p>
<p>your middle name you should be doing</p>
<p>regular intermittent fasting and a lot</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>prolonged fasting what&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do it&rsquo;s going to clear out your</p>
<p>whole</p>
<p>digestive piping</p>
<p>and allow for your your body to finally</p>
<p>heal</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you can maybe get rid of</p>
<p>this without this fasting prolonged</p>
<p>fasting so there&rsquo;s going to be some days</p>
<p>maybe once a week we go 48 hours and</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>every other week you do 72 and what</p>
<p>happens is now that starts to kind of</p>
<p>clear this thing out nicely</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re gonna have to do it for a few</p>
<p>months because it&rsquo;s probably um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because you want to correct it the</p>
<p>other thing that um you may want to try</p>
<p>as you</p>
<p>do this for a while is to in</p>
<p>implement um sauerkraut</p>
<p>fermented just a little bit because</p>
<p>that is really good for the acid reflux</p>
<p>but just a little bit of the time to see</p>
<p>what you can tolerate but in the</p>
<p>meantime like carnivore is going to have</p>
<p>to be what you&rsquo;re going to do as well</p>
<p>but you could do it like the eggs and</p>
<p>the fish</p>
<p>and then um</p>
<p>okay well then do it do what you can</p>
<p>do what you can and you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to cope but i think you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to focus</p>
<p>on the fasting okay</p>
<p>thank you so much for that question and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s all i can really give you</p>
<p>right now but let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go on to the</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>next uh do you have the answers for the</p>
<p>quiz questions i sure do and i know</p>
<p>thank you so much for coming back with</p>
<p>us and let&rsquo;s move over to the question</p>
<p>number four</p>
<p>which asks how can a synthetic</p>
<p>antioxidant trigger cancer</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>stand by</p>
<p>the audience says</p>
<p>uh or at least 60 say synthetics mimic</p>
<p>hormones 30 say the chemicals in them</p>
<p>and 10 say they have petroleum</p>
<p>components</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so take a look at this right we have</p>
<p>what causes cancer cancer is damage to</p>
<p>the mitochondria</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>so you have uh</p>
<p>like radiation</p>
<p>can act as a free radical and and create</p>
<p>damage so free radicals from smoking can</p>
<p>damage the mitochondrion</p>
<p>so what does a an antioxidant do</p>
<p>it donates one of its electrons</p>
<p>to this</p>
<p>to free radicals now free radicals are</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re missing electrons so it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>unbalanced</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>kind of like if i&rsquo;m going to spin these</p>
<p>plates on my finger right here</p>
<p>and then i put a weight on one side</p>
<p>it starts to not become balanced so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of what you you could</p>
<p>envision and then a free radical would</p>
<p>be so</p>
<p>when you take a an antioxidant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s donating an electron</p>
<p>to neutralize the free radicals but then</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>becomes a free radical because now it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have anything to balance it out</p>
<p>this is why in nature</p>
<p>and in your body you have networks of</p>
<p>antioxidants not some individual</p>
<p>antioxidant so when one</p>
<p>donates its electron it can then</p>
<p>borrow electron from someone else</p>
<p>and then when that becomes out of</p>
<p>balance it borrows from someone else so</p>
<p>they all tend to balance each other out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really how it works so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t buy antioxidants that are</p>
<p>synthetic</p>
<p>get it from food source or a food based</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>any antioxidant</p>
<p>i mean because</p>
<p>the synthetics that&rsquo;s why just stay away</p>
<p>from synthetic vitamins in general that</p>
<p>that would be your best bet</p>
<p>all right good deal let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>uh wow this is something i tell you uh</p>
<p>amy has started a firestorm on social</p>
<p>media barbara wants to know i&rsquo;m allergic</p>
<p>to seafood and grass-fed beef what</p>
<p>veggies can provide the most of most</p>
<p>proteins have we already covered that</p>
<p>yeah we talked we talked about that but</p>
<p>uh seek help</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a problem if someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>allergic to iodine</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um that really eliminates the sea kelp</p>
<p>and a lot of foods but um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just talk about allergies in</p>
<p>general if you have an allergy um</p>
<p>you can eventually get rid of it by</p>
<p>doing enough fasting the problem with</p>
<p>amy is she&rsquo;s not trying to lose weight</p>
<p>and so if she&rsquo;s already thin and she</p>
<p>does long fasting prolonged fasting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you need</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m trying to gain weight</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m losing i&rsquo;m getting too thin so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely a</p>
<p>a problem to overcome but i will say</p>
<p>that there is a technique out there</p>
<p>you can search it out i used to do it in</p>
<p>my practice i don&rsquo;t do it anymore but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called n a e t</p>
<p>and there might be a local practitioner</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s competent that you want to find</p>
<p>uh don&rsquo;t get someone that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>starting out just practicing but um</p>
<p>someone that does it it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>butcher pot allergy elimination</p>
<p>technique and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a technique</p>
<p>that someone can</p>
<p>perform to help you remove an allergy um</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know the key is finding someone that</p>
<p>does it standardly like</p>
<p>like um</p>
<p>dr naboochipot teaches you and</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t kind of go off into something</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>else so</p>
<p>it can help you i remember i worked on</p>
<p>someone who had an allergy to</p>
<p>eggs</p>
<p>and it helped them with that and also</p>
<p>someone that had a deadly allergy</p>
<p>they had um</p>
<p>like they went into shock if they</p>
<p>consumed um sesame seeds</p>
<p>and after i was done they were able to</p>
<p>eat a whole bag of sesame seeds so</p>
<p>you can there are things out there that</p>
<p>can help</p>
<p>wow sort of like a snake venom right</p>
<p>slowly get over it ben wu from facebook</p>
<p>can we have chickpeas or sprouted</p>
<p>chickpeas on keto</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna do chickpeas don&rsquo;t do a</p>
<p>lot of them um but you can if you add it</p>
<p>if you have it in a hummus you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing that much</p>
<p>and you have the oil in there and you</p>
<p>have the garlic in there and you have</p>
<p>actually olive oil instead of soy oil or</p>
<p>other oils like canola oil</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>and if you did that</p>
<p>i think that would not be a problem with</p>
<p>your blood sugars because of the oil</p>
<p>offsets it the same thing with if you</p>
<p>were to consume like egg yolk versus the</p>
<p>egg the whole egg</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry egg whites versus the whole</p>
<p>egg um when you eat the whole egg you</p>
<p>have less of an insulin spike so by</p>
<p>adding the fat in there you have less</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>bad problems so</p>
<p>thus that&rsquo;s why steve you can have more</p>
<p>ice cream because it&rsquo;s fatty right oh</p>
<p>boy</p>
<p>absolutely i&rsquo;m being very sarcastic</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna you don&rsquo;t wanna have</p>
<p>anything fatty with sugar okay no can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get away with it can&rsquo;t have your cake</p>
<p>and eat it too okay here&rsquo;s our last</p>
<p>quiz question this one&rsquo;s a true false</p>
<p>okay true or false</p>
<p>city tap water will not affect your gut</p>
<p>microbiome</p>
<p>is that true audience dig into that</p>
<p>and i tell you what let&rsquo;s go back to the</p>
<p>green room and all the way from south</p>
<p>africa we have uh uh moody moody are you</p>
<p>with us and go ahead with your question</p>
<p>for dr bird</p>
<p>hello can you hear me</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>okay thank you i dr bed um i had a</p>
<p>question my mom&rsquo;s thyroid was um</p>
<p>destroyed by that radioactive pill that</p>
<p>she took years ago</p>
<p>and she</p>
<p>had a lot of constipation i watched your</p>
<p>videos a lot of them and so</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>pulled her in</p>
<p>and she</p>
<p>she wanted to</p>
<p>order your bile salts but we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t there wasn&rsquo;t an option to</p>
<p>sell it to south africa</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>she ordered another one but it was the</p>
<p>same it&rsquo;s the same ingredients mostly</p>
<p>and i just she just want to know if she</p>
<p>takes it um well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>sorry i have to get my words straight</p>
<p>yeah my english is not that good</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>will she</p>
<p>have to take it for the rest of her life</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>will it um</p>
<p>solve the problem for constipation and</p>
<p>she she&rsquo;s got really dry eyes and all</p>
<p>that kind of stuff yeah um</p>
<p>when you take bile salts it does help</p>
<p>lubricate the colon and um</p>
<p>you said she had her</p>
<p>thyroid removed or her gallbladder</p>
<p>removed</p>
<p>now the thyroid thyroid wasn&rsquo;t removed</p>
<p>it was she took a pill that a</p>
<p>radioactive pill you know</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>if you still she still has a gallbladder</p>
<p>and i would just after she works on the</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>and gets the liver producing her own</p>
<p>bile it&rsquo;s not a it&rsquo;s not a for life</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>um unless you don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p>
<p>then it is but no i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a lifelong thing the other</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>i will be releasing video probably</p>
<p>tomorrow the next day related to your</p>
<p>mom&rsquo;s problem so you have to stay tuned</p>
<p>for that but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the the cool thing about</p>
<p>bile salts or the gallbladder formula is</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>if someone has</p>
<p>hypothyroid</p>
<p>taking bio salts will help</p>
<p>the conversion</p>
<p>from the t4 to t3 so it really helps</p>
<p>activate and without enough bile salts</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to activate it that&rsquo;s why if</p>
<p>you have a hyper thyroid and too much</p>
<p>hormone you don&rsquo;t want to take bio salts</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to get too much</p>
<p>conversion so</p>
<p>a person with hypothyroid syndrome can</p>
<p>be greatly improved or helped with the</p>
<p>gallbladder formula</p>
<p>because of the conversion and if you</p>
<p>your thyroid has no function anymore</p>
<p>yeah well she&rsquo;s probably still taking</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s taking thyroid hormones</p>
<p>correct yeah yeah yeah she does so she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking t4</p>
<p>so yeah t4 is the inactive uh thyroid</p>
<p>hormone so how is it being converted</p>
<p>through the liver and through the kidney</p>
<p>so without that liver really working</p>
<p>that well in the bile being produced</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>she may not have the full conversion to</p>
<p>see the results with the thyroid so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula helps with that</p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p>moody thanks so much for coming to us</p>
<p>from beautiful south africa</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see we have the answer</p>
<p>to the only true false question here</p>
<p>which uh asks city tap water uh will not</p>
<p>affect your gut biome and the audience</p>
<p>95 percent of them have said um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false</p>
<p>and um yeah and and then the the last</p>
<p>straggler said that it was true what do</p>
<p>you say</p>
<p>yeah well think about what&rsquo;s in tap</p>
<p>water you have</p>
<p>chlorine</p>
<p>what is the purpose of chlorine</p>
<p>to kill</p>
<p>microorganisms you have fluoride</p>
<p>kills microorganisms you have a lot of</p>
<p>other chemicals that</p>
<p>kill microorganisms this is why you</p>
<p>never want to put</p>
<p>city tap water on your garden</p>
<p>or your plants because it kills off the</p>
<p>microbes in the soil</p>
<p>so why would you put in your body so</p>
<p>you know i think what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>this is my opinion is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re people that are drinking tap water</p>
<p>without the filter</p>
<p>are basically kind of taking a mild</p>
<p>version of an antibiotic</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it can it can affect the microbiome now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to happen to every single</p>
<p>person well now because depending on</p>
<p>where you live</p>
<p>there might not be the concentration but</p>
<p>i know where i live boy if you drink</p>
<p>straight tap water without the filter</p>
<p>boy does it</p>
<p>you know some people say well the</p>
<p>chlorine evaporates yeah but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other chemicals chlorine-based chemicals</p>
<p>that can really uh</p>
<p>be a problem so</p>
<p>so anyway if you&rsquo;re trying to work on</p>
<p>your gut</p>
<p>one way to do that is to get a filter or</p>
<p>get some well water or spring water</p>
<p>or artesian well water that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>would do well congratulations audience</p>
<p>you really knocked him out of the park</p>
<p>there at the end and speaking of the end</p>
<p>we also have our final</p>
<p>participant and this is michael from</p>
<p>israel and we decided he was so handsome</p>
<p>that he gets to ask two questions so go</p>
<p>ahead uh michael you are on with dr bird</p>
<p>thank you hi dr birds such a great honor</p>
<p>uh i truly appreciate everything you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing to the keto citizens of the world</p>
<p>so thank you for your guidance uh dr</p>
<p>berg i&rsquo;ve been doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting in keto uh on and off since 2019</p>
<p>i typically do a four 18-hour fasts a</p>
<p>week</p>
<p>during which i um exercise twice on a</p>
<p>fasted state it is truly my my secret</p>
<p>sauce if i exercise on a fasted state</p>
<p>the next day i usually tend to</p>
<p>lose weight</p>
<p>but i digress on the remaining days of</p>
<p>the week i eat three meals a day usually</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>out of which one of those days is my</p>
<p>cheat day or as i like to call it my</p>
<p>treat day where me and the guys get</p>
<p>together and we feast i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>vikings after a raid kind of level you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>beer splashing pizza slices everywhere</p>
<p>i scream the whole ordeal and assuming</p>
<p>my goal is longevity and optimal weight</p>
<p>how does that structure four days</p>
<p>sunday to wednesday i</p>
<p>do keto and intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>thursday is my cheat day and the next</p>
<p>two days i eat carbs how does that</p>
<p>affect my ketosis and what do you think</p>
<p>is the best way to switch it around</p>
<p>well i think the that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>question um because of course you</p>
<p>probably have read my book and noticed</p>
<p>that i don&rsquo;t really have a cheat day in</p>
<p>that book but anyway um</p>
<p>what happens is if you have a whole day</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re cheating</p>
<p>think about how how long that will bump</p>
<p>you out of</p>
<p>your fat adaptation in your ketosis</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>at least</p>
<p>two three days so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see there&rsquo;s seven days in a week</p>
<p>and you have probably four days of</p>
<p>of benefit from this program four days</p>
<p>of benefit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s better than</p>
<p>but maybe what you do</p>
<p>is you um</p>
<p>transition to a</p>
<p>one meal</p>
<p>on that one day just to lessen it</p>
<p>and maybe um</p>
<p>try to um like instead of beer have like</p>
<p>kombucha tea and some kind of keto</p>
<p>alternatives to try to get to that point</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>there you can achieve</p>
<p>incredible pleasure</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>doing uh</p>
<p>these foods that mimic</p>
<p>some of the junk foods</p>
<p>uh and there&rsquo;s other foods that are like</p>
<p>very pleasurable i&rsquo;ll give you an</p>
<p>example like um</p>
<p>more a smoked uh pork um shoulder now</p>
<p>some people don&rsquo;t eat pork but i</p>
<p>smoke it for</p>
<p>16 hours</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the most pleasurable thing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve ever eaten in my life it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>tasty uh believe me i&rsquo;m a pescatarian so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to eat that but okay i see</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying you can probably do</p>
<p>beef</p>
<p>and uh you know make make spend some</p>
<p>time really making these recipes like</p>
<p>delicious savory foods that you can</p>
<p>really enjoy</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>i mean</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re tempted you want</p>
<p>to eat something really junky like a big</p>
<p>bag of chips or i don&rsquo;t know ice cream</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then you eat that i mean i always</p>
<p>like to say well i always ask myself was</p>
<p>that was that really worth it was it</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>maybe it was maybe it wasn&rsquo;t maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like oh i&rsquo;m not bloated i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel too good but you know what another</p>
<p>factor there&rsquo;s some other factors here</p>
<p>that are</p>
<p>probably even just as important how much</p>
<p>health reserve you have</p>
<p>is your whole life have you been insulin</p>
<p>resistant like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t afford that you might be able to</p>
<p>afford to do that because you have a</p>
<p>a huge health reserve that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>um you really are eating nutrient dense</p>
<p>foods and you&rsquo;re doing a lot of other</p>
<p>things too like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the exercise you&rsquo;re outside of nature</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your stress level is low</p>
<p>um you have a good social structure</p>
<p>around you like all these other things</p>
<p>um add up too so it&rsquo;s not just diet so</p>
<p>you just want to look at that and like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t i can&rsquo;t afford to do that myself</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>my diet has to be really</p>
<p>perfect</p>
<p>but there are some people that get away</p>
<p>with it because they have low stress</p>
<p>level their environment like there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>guys neighbors that are farmers that</p>
<p>help me out</p>
<p>do they eat healthy no but guess what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing physical work outside all</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>in the sun</p>
<p>that has probably helped them more than</p>
<p>anything survive and they&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>live a long life</p>
<p>i see what you mean the balance i get</p>
<p>that thank you another question if i may</p>
<p>um i used to break my fast with nuts and</p>
<p>seeds and then an hour later i would eat</p>
<p>my big meal i recently</p>
<p>read and saw some videos of thomas de</p>
<p>laurie which i also admire very much</p>
<p>about first breaking the fast with lean</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>and then an hour later eating my full</p>
<p>meal from your knowledge what is best</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve seen you</p>
<p>also do videos on lemon juice and zinc</p>
<p>what is the best structure of breaking a</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>okay so if we take the worst structure</p>
<p>that would be carbs so</p>
<p>definitely don&rsquo;t want to do any carbs</p>
<p>breaking it fast because that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>create some problems um</p>
<p>you think about what&rsquo;s happening you you</p>
<p>put the uh</p>
<p>the digestive system into a sleep mode</p>
<p>and you got to wake it up slowly so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>protein and and some fat maybe a little</p>
<p>salad just a little bit like the</p>
<p>quantity</p>
<p>and if you only fast it for 48 hours</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>yeah that you can do a small amount wait</p>
<p>an hour and eat a full meal but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing 72</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s see you&rsquo;re fasting for five</p>
<p>days or seven days</p>
<p>um i would not do a full meal probably</p>
<p>i would do small little things and i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>done a video on this where you maybe</p>
<p>through the day and then the next day</p>
<p>you could start to have a little bit</p>
<p>bigger but</p>
<p>it really depends on how long you put</p>
<p>that uh</p>
<p>digestive system to sleep i made a</p>
<p>mistake of</p>
<p>fasting i think three days and i just</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>i did not have a small meal i had a big</p>
<p>meal and here i am down chomping down</p>
<p>and i got in trouble really fast i found</p>
<p>that i will never do that again because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like my whole body was like</p>
<p>freaking out so</p>
<p>experiment with it but</p>
<p>it really depends on other factors</p>
<p>i understand thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome and i want to thank</p>
<p>everyone for being on i appreciate your</p>
<p>attention great questions</p>
<p>and thanks for all the wonderful</p>
<p>comments</p>
<p>stay tuned next week we&rsquo;ll have another</p>
<p>show and uh</p>
<p>and also releasing videos every morning</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
