    <p>The following is a conversation with Craig Jones, Nikki Rodd, and Nikki Ryan,</p>
<p>who together with Ethan Crelliston and others, make up the B-Team,</p>
<p>a legendary jiu-jitsu team here in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>It was formed after the so-called Donahue Death Squad,</p>
<p>the team headed by John Donahue, split up into New Wave Jiu-Jitsu</p>
<p>and B-Team Jiu-Jitsu, both located here in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of trash talk back and forth,</p>
<p>including accusations of greasing and steroid use.</p>
<p>And I, as a practitioner and fan of grappling, jiu-jitsu, and</p>
<p>martial arts in general, am here for it. To see the best grapplers in history,</p>
<p>go at it, both on the mat and on Instagram. I like the people on</p>
<p>both teams, and train with both, and I&rsquo;m really happy</p>
<p>to see the exciting rapid evolution of the sport</p>
<p>that these athletes and coaches are catalyzing.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out</p>
<p>in the description, it&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got BetterHelp for mental health, 8sleep for</p>
<p>naps, and Athletic Greens for daily multivitamins.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends. And if you want to work</p>
<p>with our amazing team, we&rsquo;re always hiring. Go to lexfriedman.com</p>
<p>slash hiring. And now, on to the full ad reads. As always,</p>
<p>no ads in the middle. I try to make this interesting, but</p>
<p>if you must skip them, please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too. This episode is brought to you by</p>
<p>BetterHelp, spelled H-E-L-P, help. There&rsquo;s that quote from</p>
<p>Jack Kerouac, the book on the road that I recently</p>
<p>finished reading, rereading. Rereading for like, I don&rsquo;t know, the</p>
<p>10th at least time in my life. And there&rsquo;s a quote in there about the</p>
<p>Mad Ones. The main character, Sal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s strange how bad my memory is, but something tells me that his last name is</p>
<p>Paradise, Sal Paradise, and Dean Moriarty.</p>
<p>And Sal is Jack Kerouac, and the real life name of Dean Moriarty, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t remember, but the character name is Dean Moriarty, and he represents sort</p>
<p>of the the weird, the crazy, the chaotic</p>
<p>friend,</p>
<p>shaman, guide through life, the drop of poison in a perfectly calm</p>
<p>drink, or a perfectly calm pond, or town like Tom Waits says. Anyway,</p>
<p>those people and that part of ourselves is really powerful, that weirdness, that</p>
<p>darkness, that chaos. You have to have control of</p>
<p>it, I think. I think being self-aware and</p>
<p>introspective about that, and bringing it to the surface,</p>
<p>and knowing that that part of you exists. Check them out</p>
<p>at betterhelp.com slash Lex, and save on your first</p>
<p>month. This episode is also brought to you by</p>
<p>Eight Sleep, and it&rsquo;s Pod 3 mattress. As I record these very words,</p>
<p>it is extremely late at night. It has been a long night before then,</p>
<p>and a long day, and the thing that carries me through</p>
<p>is a beautiful power nap, or a couple of those, when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>deprived of sleep because of various curveballs that</p>
<p>life throws at me, as it does for everybody.</p>
<p>I think I at least maintain my sanity and my well-being by</p>
<p>taking power naps. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll actually drink a coffee</p>
<p>right before the nap, and I take that nap, and about 30 minutes after, I pop up</p>
<p>all refreshed, ready to go. Not like now, actually physically, mentally,</p>
<p>spiritually refreshed. Now I&rsquo;m more calm and zen,</p>
<p>ready to take on the darkness that waits for me when I finally close my eyes,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m laying on that Eight Sleep bed as I&rsquo;m ready</p>
<p>to very soon. It is a source of happiness</p>
<p>for me, a cold bed with a warm blanket. It&rsquo;s a peaceful escape from the chaos</p>
<p>of life outside. It&rsquo;s a weird little feature of biology that we get to sleep,</p>
<p>and that is both necessary, and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>wonderful. Anyway, check it out and get special savings when you go to</p>
<p>eightsleep.com slash lex. This show is also brought to you by</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, and it&rsquo;s AG1 Drink, which is an all-in-one</p>
<p>daily drink to support better health and peak</p>
<p>performance. It is delicious. I&rsquo;m drinking twice today</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m traveling. I packed a few travel packs to go with me,</p>
<p>like little travel companions that represent home, and then I get to</p>
<p>the hotel, and I unpack it, and that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>reminder, a little habit that I get to carry with me</p>
<p>that represents home, that makes me feel like I&rsquo;m at home.</p>
<p>Because what is home, after all, but a set of habits and a set of people that</p>
<p>bring joy to our lives, and a set of habits that bring joy, and</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is that. It brings joy to my life.</p>
<p>Above all the nutritional excellence it does for me,</p>

<p>description. And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Craig Jones, Nikki Rodd,</p>
<p>and Nikki Ryan.</p>
<p>♪♪♪</p>
<p>Craig, can you introduce everyone? Yep, so we got Nikki Rodd here,</p>
<p>brown belt, two-time ADCC silver medalist. Nikki Ryan here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Okay, who are you? And I&rsquo;m Craig Jones, also two-time ADCC</p>
<p>silver medalist. Silver medalist, so the number one loser.</p>
<p>Number one loser. And maybe a little bit more,</p>
<p>your bio says, widely known as the black belt slayer, hails from New Jersey, the</p>
<p>land of pizza and biceps. Yes, that&rsquo;s pretty accurate. Okay, you</p>
<p>also do carry a gun on you a lot? Yeah, I keep it loaded,</p>
<p>you know, keep it on me. You have one today? In the car.</p>
<p>That was a mistake, that was your first mistake. Yeah, I think you&rsquo;re too close.</p>
<p>And you are Nikki Ryan, what else is there?</p>
<p>What else do we know? Gordon Ryan&rsquo;s brother. Gordon Ryan&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>I was waiting for that one. All right, so and you&rsquo;re all together</p>
<p>part of the leadership of the B team here in Austin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get out some introductory questions. What, in general, accomplishment</p>
<p>of the things you mentioned you&rsquo;re most proud of?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m proud just to not have to work a full-time job,</p>
<p>just to get by on the bullshit I&rsquo;ve done so far.</p>
<p>Yeah. Honestly. Just making money of a thing you love. Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>When was the first time you made money on a thing you love?</p>
<p>Probably a jiu-jitsu tournament. I think maybe in Abu Dhabi where I won a thousand</p>
<p>dollars, thought I was rich. Yeah, yeah. What&rsquo;d you spend a thousand</p>
<p>dollars on? Probably something bad. Probably drugs or</p>
<p>something at the time. Maybe blew it at the after party.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good introduction, Craig. So what about you? When&rsquo;s the first time you made money on</p>
<p>jiu-jitsu? Or what&rsquo;s actually stepping back, like what&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re most proud of?</p>
<p>Is it a similar kind of thing? I think the thing I&rsquo;m most proud of is,</p>
<p>I mean, for sure two ADCC silver medals, which hurts because you&rsquo;re so close to getting that</p>
<p>gold. But it takes time. I&rsquo;m understanding that sport of jiu-jitsu takes quite a while to be at</p>
<p>the tip top, to be the absolute best. So I&rsquo;m just being consistent in my training and my craft,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get that number one spot one day. What failure or loss is the most painful to you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I have a pretty short-term memory. So my losses, I just forget about them. Yeah. I</p>
<p>mean, for sure, my loss at this past ADCC in the finals, that one sunk in because I definitely</p>
<p>thought I was going to win. I mean, it takes a while to produce the skills or the reactions</p>
<p>more so that you need to have to be that number one pound for pound guy. And pre-ADCC, I was coming</p>
<p>off an injury. So it took me a little bit to find the right mentality and physicality that I needed</p>
<p>in order to get the wins that required gold. So yeah, it&rsquo;s just process.</p>
<p>Interesting. You keep saying process, like it takes a while to build up. So you&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>thinking of a loss like ADCC as like a specific failures. You haven&rsquo;t gone long enough in a</p>
<p>particular process to being a champ. Well, I mean, for me, I&rsquo;m closing in on</p>
<p>five years of specifically jiu-jitsu training. I&rsquo;m about four and a half right now. And yeah,</p>
<p>you constantly have these ups and downs in training where as long as you stay consistent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a gradual raise, but still you&rsquo;ll have these peaks and lows and just trying to get</p>
<p>better every day. I&rsquo;m definitely not where I will be in a few years from now, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>striving to get there. Are you actually a brown belt or was that a joke?</p>
<p>Brown belt, yeah. You&rsquo;re a brown belt. How many stripes?</p>
<p>No stripes. No stripes?</p>
<p>Stripless. Okay. Is that part of the process</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working through? Definitely part of the process. I mean,</p>
<p>I think a black belt is just based upon how much knowledge you have. Obviously, if you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>competitive-wise, from when I started, I was able to beat most black belts. That&rsquo;s just kind of how</p>
<p>I was gifted from my wrestling experience. And the time will come when it&rsquo;s right, but I&rsquo;m not in a</p>
<p>rush at all. I&rsquo;m continuing. I just kind of take every day for what it is and try to improve upon</p>
<p>that. I mean, I want to give him the black belt. Nikki Ryan says he&rsquo;s not ready.</p>
<p>What is it? Are you guys, like us no-gi folks, do you take that seriously? Like the black belt? Or</p>
<p>like how much does it come into play into? Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s like Nikki Ryan said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s based off of knowledge, not just what you do out on the competition mats. Because like he said,</p>
<p>he had years of wrestling experience and obviously he&rsquo;s very physically gifted.</p>
<p>So we grade based off of the amount of knowledge that you have.</p>
<p>How do you measure knowledge? I think teaching is a good measurement of it. Like how well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to show the moves and really make sure that you have an understanding of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s an interesting rank. It&rsquo;s something that takes many years to accomplish. And for a</p>
<p>lot of people, it&rsquo;s truly meaningful. It&rsquo;s like it represents a particular step in a journey.</p>
<p>But for you guys, it&rsquo;s almost like different because you&rsquo;ve been so focused on competition</p>
<p>that I guess if you take it seriously, it is a big step for you too. Like as martial artists,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bigger than just being top of the world competitors, right? So I thought it was a joke.</p>
<p>You guys are actually taking it seriously. That he&rsquo;s a brown belt.</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s a brown belt and you&rsquo;re taking seriously the rank of black belt and it&rsquo;s part of your</p>
<p>journey. I think by the time I get a black belt, I&rsquo;ll be no more pound for pound. I think it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>pretty nice to accomplish that as a brown belt and then maybe toss a black belt on top.</p>
<p>Maybe get promoted on the podium. What do you guys, do you love winning or hate losing more?</p>
<p>I definitely don&rsquo;t hate losing. If it pays the bills, I don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>Yeah. But honestly, if I win, I feel more relief than anything rather than</p>
<p>like excitement and stuff. I&rsquo;m like, oh fuck, thank God that&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I hate losing for sure. But I understand that it&rsquo;s necessary to get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>And then winning is like, I mean, what I think winning is probably the closest you can think</p>
<p>you can get to like heroin or something. Cause I mean, we&rsquo;re on a, like if you do have extreme</p>
<p>success in a torment that you&rsquo;ve been adamant about training for and competing in for a while</p>
<p>and you end up winning it. I mean, I feel like you&rsquo;re on that high for days at a time afterwards.</p>
<p>Heroin is going to be better.</p>
<p>You think so? I&rsquo;m going to stick with no, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to suck dick to win.</p>
<p>You suck dick for heroin. Okay. I guess that&rsquo;s a good point. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know, like, because you, you, you&rsquo;re coming from a little bit of a wrestling culture.</p>
<p>One of the things I really love is at the end of the match, when they lose, they just, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>they just run off. They&rsquo;re like almost pissed off. It&rsquo;s like some mixture of</p>
<p>anger and frustration at themselves.</p>
<p>I think, I think sometimes that people like freak out on the mat. And I think that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>to show everybody like they&rsquo;re acting like they cared a lot and really maybe they didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>enough to, to, you know, get to where they want to, where they expect it to be and they lost.</p>
<p>And then they had this big boost of emotion, like after their, after their loss. But yeah,</p>
<p>I mean, I shouldn&rsquo;t, I think you just cry in the mirror and not to everybody else.</p>
<p>Um, what have you ever cried watching a movie?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever cried period.</p>
<p>Okay. Have you cried watching a movie?</p>
<p>Not yet. Not yet.</p>
<p>The Notebook.</p>
<p>I try to avoid those movies. Actually, I lie, actually.</p>
<p>Titanic.</p>
<p>The last part of a difficult wake up for me is I try to find a sad movie and at least cry</p>
<p>about a pound out. That really gets me over the line. Low energy cutting.</p>
<p>The tears. Um, there&rsquo;s other following, uh, liquids I could talk to you about, but let&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just continue on.</p>
<p>Low energy.</p>
<p>What, uh, um, what about you, Nikki? Uh, love of winning versus hate of losing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very competitive person, so I for sure hate losing more than I like winning. Uh,</p>
<p>I, I do think it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s kind of held me back over the, uh, the past few years</p>
<p>because, uh, it, it makes it so that I&rsquo;m not as active as I should be.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like, I really hate that feeling of, you know, after a match that you just lost.</p>
<p>Uh, so it kind of prevents me from competing. So it&rsquo;s definitely something I need to work past.</p>
<p>So like when you think about a competition, the possibility of losing, which is always there in</p>
<p>competition is the thing that like weighs heavy on you in the months and weeks leading up to it.</p>
<p>Yeah. My whole life, you know, my financial stability, everything depends on, you know,</p>
<p>my ability to go out there and compete and my ability to teach. Uh, so, you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge hit to the brand if you lose. So, you know, leading up to matches, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely something that&rsquo;s in my mind.</p>
<p>I know you, so you guys are like world-class athletes, but for me, more like a hobbyist</p>
<p>competitor, I compete a lot. The thing I was, uh, cause I really wanted to win. The thing I was</p>
<p>probably most afraid I was not just losing, but like embarrassing myself. Yeah. Even, even actually</p>
<p>winning by stalling. That was the thing I hated the most about myself in terms of crying in the</p>
<p>mirror is like being too afraid to take risks after I&rsquo;m up on two points or something.</p>
<p>I think you got a competition. Sometimes it&rsquo;s good to take the emotion out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too easy sometimes to like, uh, think about all my girls and in the crowd and my</p>
<p>family&rsquo;s watching, like I want to win cause they&rsquo;re there. Uh, but at the highest level,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re emotional at all, no, that&rsquo;s affecting you.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s tough though. That&rsquo;s tough. Especially like leading up to when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the mat, maybe, but leading up to it, I think it&rsquo;s okay to be emotional prior. Like,</p>
<p>you know, if we know ADCC or it&rsquo;s coming up and we have a big match, like definitely I&rsquo;ll go out</p>
<p>in, in practice and I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll visualize, I&rsquo;ll put myself in that competition. That way, when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s game time, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve been there a thousand times already. So not the actual competition,</p>
<p>but even leading up to it, like stepping on the mat, like all the walk, walk towards it, all that,</p>
<p>all that stuff. Like I&rsquo;ll do the same exact warmup for weeks on end and, uh, until my competition</p>
<p>day comes. That&rsquo;s why that way, you know, when I compete, I&rsquo;m just like, oh, it&rsquo;s another Tuesday</p>
<p>at practice. Uh, what about you, Craig? How do you prepare mentally for a tournament like ADCC?</p>
<p>I push it completely out of my mind. Don&rsquo;t even think about it. Try to avoid any visualization,</p>
<p>any rituals, warmups, anything like that. Block it out until the last second. Yeah. Trying not</p>
<p>to think about it. I just go to training to have fun, learn a bit. So I try to approach competition</p>
<p>the exact same way. I don&rsquo;t warm up at training, do very little warmup for competition.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. And, uh, you just step on the mat?</p>
<p>Step on the mats. My philosophy is there&rsquo;s no warmups on the street.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so vastly different.</p>
<p>All right. Uh, so you like legit don&rsquo;t warm up?</p>
<p>No, I probably should now I&rsquo;m 31, but I would just like in the gym, take it easy the first</p>
<p>round. You know, like if I look around the room and Nikki Ryan&rsquo;s there, I might go, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have an easier first round today. So even for like the most high stakes matches,</p>
<p>you try to push it out. Yeah. I didn&rsquo;t even think about it.</p>
<p>What about like all the social, like Instagram posts you have to do about that match? You just</p>
<p>make a joke out of it and kind of. Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s all kind of pretty silly, you know, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just wrestling each other, you know, we put the meaning into it, but to someone that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>follow the sport, it looks stupid. Well, all of human existence is pretty silly.</p>
<p>Like what are we doing? None of us really know what&rsquo;s going on. We&rsquo;ll kind of have sex to</p>
<p>reproduce. We&rsquo;ll get hungry, we eat, and then we&rsquo;re all chasing money and cars and whatever</p>
<p>the hell in a capitalist society, or we worship a dictator in a authoritarian regime. Yeah. And</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll get off on, we&rsquo;ll let power abuse us and then we just murder others because we get off</p>
<p>on it. Yeah. And then eventually all of us will die because the sun will run out of energy</p>
<p>because colonizing other planets is very difficult. So none of it matters. It&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>philosophy. It&rsquo;s pretty, pretty good. That&rsquo;s exactly what I was saying. How does the sun</p>
<p>run out of energy? You caught me there. It&rsquo;s burnt out. It&rsquo;s like a, it&rsquo;s a nuclear fusion</p>
<p>engine and eventually burns out. Like when you get tired of training. Yeah. It&rsquo;s never happened.</p>
<p>I try to get tired. I was like, dude, it&rsquo;s not working. All right. Cool. So you legit don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about losing. It doesn&rsquo;t weigh heavy on you. I try not to list, like if I win, I try to block out</p>
<p>all the compliments, all the niceties and stuff. So I try to do the same with losing. It&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Move on to the next one. Don&rsquo;t dwell on it too much. And sometimes make a joke out of it. Yeah,</p>
<p>exactly. Winning or losing with the right joke, we can make money off of the events that transpired.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s most important. Excellent. Thank you. I have a bunch of your merch.</p>
<p>Oh, nice. This one&rsquo;s the Jordan Burroughs ripoff.</p>
<p>All I see is silver. The way it pronouns Burroughs is very, very sexy. Okay.</p>
<p>I throw lines at people and I try to gauge their reaction. Like sometimes I&rsquo;ll say something</p>
<p>to Nikki and I&rsquo;ll be like, all right, that&rsquo;s probably crossing the line. You know what I</p>
<p>mean? We&rsquo;ll tone it down to the public. Yeah. So it&rsquo;s not just, right. You have to think</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s crossing the line. Yeah. Yeah. I get as close to it as possible. Yeah. I feel like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really cross it. And then cross it just a little bit. Just a little bit. Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you said that I&rsquo;m Switzerland in World War II since I&rsquo;m friends with both you</p>
<p>and Gordon and John. Very rich country. Are you a Hitler or a Stalin, by the way, in this analogy?</p>
<p>Would you like to be Hitler or Stalin? And should you make a t-shirt out of it? I mean,</p>
<p>a Nazi t-shirt, I don&rsquo;t know how well that sells. I think it would, you know, I think</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s brainstorm on this one offline. I think since Hitler lost, so you got second place in</p>
<p>World War II. That&rsquo;s true. That&rsquo;s true. I think that makes you Hitler. Anyway, to the degree that</p>
<p>you can, can you tell the story of how the time you&rsquo;ve had with the Donahoe death squad and why</p>
<p>you split up? I competed against Gordon for ADCC and EBI in 2017. And I remember I competed</p>
<p>against him at ADCC and then we had the EBI event. And then I had a Kasai. I used to compete all the</p>
<p>time every week. I wouldn&rsquo;t even do the preparation or anything. I&rsquo;d just be like trying to do seminars,</p>
<p>make money, and then jump in and compete. I remember I showed up to Kasai after I faced</p>
<p>him twice and there were like four locker rooms and they put me with all the DDS guys. It was just</p>
<p>me and all of DDS. And I think we competed the weekend before. So I thought it was going to be</p>
<p>super awkward, but it was actually, it was actually pretty chill. And the Kasai was in New York and</p>
<p>they suggested to come train that week. So I came trained, hung out with them a bit. Ultimately,</p>
<p>the goal was to move to America and join a bigger team just because that flight to Australia is</p>
<p>death. Australia is so far away from everywhere. It&rsquo;s kind of like not realistic to base yourself</p>
<p>in Australia when all the tournaments are in America. And then I went and trained with the</p>
<p>guys and they just had a massive, massively deep talent pool in that room. Like show up to like a</p>
<p>meant to be 7am, actual 8am class on Brazilian time. And there&rsquo;d be like a hundred people in</p>
<p>there, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know how many black belts, but a ton of elite guys. And I was coming from</p>
<p>Australia, training with Lachlan Giles, but really that room was pretty shallow. And like most people</p>
<p>had serious jobs and stuff. So it was like basically me just training with Lachlan, maybe a couple of</p>
<p>other guys, and then to go to New York and have access to a wide array of training partners and</p>
<p>guys that are training twice each day. I feel like that&rsquo;s what you really need. You need people that</p>
<p>can train as much as you are. You get humbled in that room at first. For sure. Because my style</p>
<p>at the time was basically a rip off version of what they were doing. Leg locks came in. I remember</p>
<p>just watching Eddie Cummings nonstop and just seeing this guy rip people&rsquo;s legs off. And I was</p>
<p>like, you know what, that&rsquo;s probably a good move. That looks like an easier path to victory</p>
<p>than trying to beat these guys at what they&rsquo;re good at already. My philosophy at the time was</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s bothering old Brazilians, it&rsquo;s bothering them for a reason. It&rsquo;s probably effective.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the path I took to try to rip off their moves. And then obviously to go into that room,</p>
<p>try to do them to them, it&rsquo;s going to be a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>All right. So that&rsquo;s how it started. How did you end up here?</p>
<p>How do we end up here?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>I mean, I like to think of Puerto Rico as apocalypse now. John Danaher as Colonel Kurtz.</p>
<p>Things got very weird in the jungle and the teams went in two different directions.</p>
<p>But honestly, I mean, it&rsquo;s not really my story to tell. I had some issues with some of those</p>
<p>people. At the time of the split, I got along very well with John. I feel like me and him</p>
<p>connected very well. I don&rsquo;t know why that was. Maybe it was just because he missed home. He</p>
<p>missed the familiar accent, Australian, New Zealand accent. But I mean, I basically followed</p>
<p>left with Nicky, sort of that core group of guys left with Nicky. And I mean, I just back,</p>
<p>there was personal problems and I just back Nicky, basically.</p>
<p>Got it. Just sticking on you for a bit. Is there a part of you that, you know,</p>
<p>finds it heartbreaking that DDS split up? Does part of you miss working with John and everybody?</p>
<p>Can you steal me on the case for that?</p>
<p>I mean, I miss certain aspects of it, but I also do prefer the freedom of being apart from it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously a very strict regime under John Danaher. You know, obviously there&rsquo;s parts of it</p>
<p>I miss. The parts that the public doesn&rsquo;t see of John, the behind the scenes banter,</p>
<p>I feel like he&rsquo;s very conscious of the image he portrays to the world. But basically,</p>
<p>closed doors, he&rsquo;s always making jokes, always finding, I guess, more in line with the Australian</p>
<p>Kiwi sort of culture. But you don&rsquo;t really see that in the public eye. So that perspective,</p>
<p>I do miss that relationship with John. In terms of setting aside personal differences,</p>
<p>Gordon was a good training partner, definitely a good training partner to train with.</p>
<p>But obviously the negative things we can&rsquo;t really talk about outweighed all of those things.</p>
<p>And we obviously had to make a decision to leave.</p>
<p>The things that happened in the jungle.</p>
<p>The things that happened in the jungle.</p>
<p>Should never be spoken of.</p>
<p>That I personally cannot speak of. Yeah, but obviously I do miss certain aspects. Like,</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s all bad, nothing&rsquo;s all good, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, this goes back to your, like, everything we&rsquo;re doing is silly.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t get people take it so serious, martial arts so serious. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>pretty stupid, really. Especially in the Gi, it looks just, it looks bad.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty silly with and without the Gi. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of apes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s silly about no Gi and what&rsquo;s silly about the Gi and just</p>
<p>mix and match bottoms there, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Wait, which one?</p>
<p>Standby.</p>
<p>I see what you&rsquo;re doing. Brother, you come to my house and offend my people.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go to every dark place, apparently.</p>
<p>Nick, how did you get with DDS? Like, what was that journey like?</p>
<p>Try to see if there&rsquo;s things that you remember fondly that you&rsquo;ve gotten from the experience.</p>
<p>All right. So, the way I started training with DDS, initially, I was training for, like,</p>
<p>well, initially, I was a bouncer, right? I dropped out of college to pursue this fitness</p>
<p>modeling career. I ended up signing with Wilhelmina Models up in New York, and I was, like,</p>
<p>trying to get in better shape. And while I was bouncing, kind of the talk of, like, you know,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s tougher came up between the wrestlers and a few of the bouncers that trained jujitsu.</p>
<p>And, you know, they convinced me to go to a practice, and I went to my first practice over</p>
<p>there. And for the most part, I just controlled everybody, got on top of them, was able to avoid,</p>
<p>like, kind of, like, you know, shitty submissions, because I had an awareness of the sport, and,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m a fan of fighting and whatnot. So, you know, I kind of understood it pretty well.</p>
<p>And then soon after that, I joined a school, and my second week of jujitsu, I started competing,</p>
<p>had pretty good success. You know, I was, like, subbing a few black belts and beating everybody,</p>
<p>like, you know, pretty decisively with points and stuff. And about three months into training</p>
<p>locally, I got connected with Gordon Ryan and John Danaher up in New York, and I started,</p>
<p>I committed to, you know, make the drive up there as many days as I could. At the time,</p>
<p>I lived in South Jersey, and it was about a two-and-a-half hour, three-hour drive without</p>
<p>traffic to New York. Where in South Jersey? Gloucester County, Clayton, New Jersey,</p>
<p>specifically, but Gloucester County. Yeah. So, it was about 130 miles, and without traffic,</p>
<p>you know, about two-and-a-half hours or so. But on the way back, man, it&rsquo;d be three-plus sometimes,</p>
<p>you know, catching that rush hour. What year was this? Do you remember?</p>
<p>This was in 2018. I forget how young you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was there before all that. All right, cool. Anyway, you&rsquo;re doing the long drive, and</p>
<p>then what? Yeah, doing the long drive, and then, you know, once I won 80cc trials, I was able to</p>
<p>make a couple bucks, and then, you know, I got my silver medal at 80cc, and I was able to afford</p>
<p>to live up there in New York and North Jersey area. So, I lived up there, trained there full</p>
<p>time every day, and, you know, just kind of stuck with the team throughout the turbulent times and</p>
<p>found ourselves in Austin. In the jungle.</p>
<p>In the jungle, yeah. One of the things we shall not speak of.</p>
<p>Indeed. What other things that you remember that you&rsquo;ve learned from John Donahuer from</p>
<p>your time you spent with him? Yeah, I mean, I definitely learned a ton from John and the team</p>
<p>as a whole. Like, you know, you have to be the guy that asks questions in that type of environment,</p>
<p>right? Because you&rsquo;re not going to get singled out to be that specific, like, star or the best</p>
<p>guy in the room when you have all these other, you know, stud athletes. So, I really had to</p>
<p>seek out and figure out the kind of questions that I needed to ask, and once I became a bit</p>
<p>more verbal with my training and, you know, I&rsquo;m expressing all my curiosities about grappling</p>
<p>to these guys, definitely helped boost my technique and my career as a whole.</p>
<p>Yeah, did you understand what kind of stuff, like, technically you want to get good at,</p>
<p>what fits your body, what would be good for you, what are your weaknesses and all that?</p>
<p>So, initially, when I started grappling, I had an innate ability to just get to opponent&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>So, I was like, all right, I&rsquo;m good at getting to the back. Let me perfect controlling the back</p>
<p>and then submitting opponent via rear naked choke. And then besides that, I really focused</p>
<p>on leg lock defense, and then eventually came the variety lock pass where, you know, I&rsquo;m really good</p>
<p>at body lock passing my opponents now. And yeah, it just takes quite a long time because you have</p>
<p>to find different sequences, and then there&rsquo;s always these, an abundance of opportunities</p>
<p>that your opponent gets from these specific sequences. So, it takes a while.</p>
<p>Is there a part of you that finds the fact that DGS split up heartbreaking?</p>
<p>I definitely, you know, having one person to go to that runs practice every day, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, consistent, it was definitely a gift, but now I&rsquo;m also gifted with many,</p>
<p>many other partners. I have Nikki Ryan, you know, Craig Jones, Ethan-</p>
<p>Ethan Claus, Craig Jones.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. We have Ethan Krelosy, Damian Anderson. So, a full team of</p>
<p>knowledgeable athletes that I can continue to go to with multiple questions. But yeah,</p>
<p>definitely, it took me some time to adjust to training or to learning from, you know,</p>
<p>specifically my team and not just one person.</p>
<p>We should mention for people just listening, because you can&rsquo;t visually see that Nikki Ryan</p>
<p>is currently terrified, and Craig Jones is currently enjoying the fact that Nikki Ryan</p>
<p>is terrified. But anyway, can you talk about your, Nikki, can you talk about your time with DGS?</p>
<p>I started training when I was like around 13, you know, my brother Gordon had started prior to me,</p>
<p>and I really just went into training just as like a means to exercise and lose weight at the</p>
<p>beginning, because I was pretty fat as a kid. So, I went to the first class, loved it, and then</p>
<p>just started training every day at Gary&rsquo;s Gym, Brunswick. And then during the summer, when I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>get off from school, they would take me up to New York to train under John. And you know, I just</p>
<p>absolutely loved it. I knew what I wanted to do with my life at a young age. So, I ended up</p>
<p>dropping out of school actually after my freshman year in high school. So, yeah, 15, I ended up</p>
<p>dropping out and just pursuing Jiu Jitsu full time, you know, training every day up in the</p>
<p>Blue Basement.</p>
<p>Like what aspects of Jiu Jitsu made you know that this is the thing for you?</p>
<p>It was just something I just enjoyed being, you know, like on the mats every day. I love that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you know, a problem solving aspect to it. So, it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s mentally challenging,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s physically challenging, helps me get in shape. So, I just, yeah, right off the bat,</p>
<p>I knew I loved it.</p>
<p>Okay, so then we&rsquo;ll go to the jungle. What happened in the jungle?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in general, like, I like this. I like this. This is like this like shroud of mystery</p>
<p>that shall never be penetrated. That should never be like-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a book deal. It&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>A book deal?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Obviously, he left high school. He&rsquo;s not writing it.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll do the Russian translation here. Okay. So, what happened in the jungle?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll do the Russian translation here. Okay. So, what are things that you enjoyed</p>
<p>that you remember from working with John Donohue?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you know, obviously, he&rsquo;s considered one of the best coaches in the world.</p>
<p>You know, very charismatic guy when you see him in person. You know, I pretty much was,</p>
<p>you know, kind of raised in the DDS. You know, that&rsquo;s where I spent the majority of my time</p>
<p>every day. So, I obviously had very deep connections, you know, with John, my brother,</p>
<p>Gary, you know, even Eddie Cummings and stuff back then. So, obviously, I miss interacting</p>
<p>with those guys every day. And, you know, it&rsquo;s like they said, it&rsquo;s good to have somebody to</p>
<p>kind of crack the whip at you every day. And John was very good at that.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re like younger in your teenage years, you can kind of,</p>
<p>you like have to get humbled, right? There&rsquo;s like a process to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. And-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good room to get humbled in, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. I mean, I was, I started training with them just when like everybody started to</p>
<p>break out. Gary was like the biggest name at the time, just because he had won ADCC trials already.</p>
<p>And he had a crazy match with Kron, Kron Gracie at ADCC. But Eddie was just starting to break out.</p>
<p>Gordon just started winning EBI. So, I started training under John, you know,</p>
<p>right when everything was exploding.</p>
<p>What are the good things about life, about jiu-jitsu you learned from your brother?</p>
<p>Both me and my brother never really wanted to, you know, work a full-time job doing something</p>
<p>that we hate. And he was always, you know, a very confident person. So, he just went,</p>
<p>you know, fully started pursuing jiu-jitsu. So, I&rsquo;m very happy that, you know, he did that. And</p>
<p>I ended up following in his footsteps, because you can ask these guys, I&rsquo;m a lazy sack of shit</p>
<p>outside of the mat. So, that&rsquo;s definitely one thing that I&rsquo;m very grateful for.</p>
<p>That he paved the way, like you can make money doing the stuff you love.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. And he was a big reason, you know, why my parents eventually let me drop out</p>
<p>of school. Because, you know, when they were coming up, there was no money in the sport. It</p>
<p>was very hard to make a full living. Like, if you wanted to actually make a living, you&rsquo;d eventually</p>
<p>have to transfer to MMA. And I feel like Gordon and Gary and those guys were, you know, some of</p>
<p>the first people to make a very good living off of just jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>At this party, you find it heartbreaking</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve split up from DDS, but also from your brother in terms of spending time on the mat</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. You know, I mean, growing up, you know, obviously, he&rsquo;s my big brother. I looked</p>
<p>up to him a lot. So, I definitely, like I said, I miss interacting with those guys. I was pretty</p>
<p>much raised, you know, in that blue basement, you know, that John was like, you know, a father</p>
<p>figure to me. So, I definitely, you know, miss seeing those guys every day.</p>
<p>Do you have animosity towards Gordon? And does he have animosity toward you?</p>
<p>And what is the source of that? And do you think you&rsquo;ll ever be able to forgive each other?</p>
<p>Definitely, initially, during the initial split, we definitely hated each other at the beginning.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely started to calm down. Actually, just prior to, you know, all this</p>
<p>social media drama that&rsquo;s going on currently, he had reached out to me. And that was literally,</p>
<p>like, the first time that we have actually talked since the split happened. So, we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talk to each other for, what is it now, like, almost two years. And that was the first time</p>
<p>that, you know, we interacted again. And overall, you know, he wasn&rsquo;t, you know, aggressive towards</p>
<p>me. I wasn&rsquo;t aggressive towards him. We were cracking some jokes. So, hopefully, the animosity</p>
<p>is going down.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s this Godfather quote that I wrote down. I recently rewatched it</p>
<p>from the Don, from Don Corleone, Vito Corleone. The strength of a family, like the strength of</p>
<p>an army, lies in its loyalty to each other. Is there some aspect of family that you miss?</p>
<p>Of the blood that kind of connects you, that you can count on?</p>
<p>Yeah, my parents, you know, they both raised us that, you know, like, family is everything. You</p>
<p>never, you know, betray your family or anything like that. So, I definitely, you know, miss them</p>
<p>from time to time.</p>
<p>Okay. Imagine you&rsquo;re, like, 40 years from now, sitting on a porch with a shotgun,</p>
<p>drinking whiskey, looking over, like, all the land you&rsquo;ve conquered.</p>
<p>Looking back to this moment, is the reason you split up a bullshit reason? Or is it a good</p>
<p>reason, from the perspective of the king who has now conquered the lands, have proven himself,</p>
<p>have done everything?</p>
<p>I think it was definitely, like, a justifiable reason for the team splitting. Like, it just,</p>
<p>with the way things were going, it just was not going to work with, you know,</p>
<p>all of us in the same room together. It started, you know, affecting training,</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable and things. So, I definitely think that it was a justifiable</p>
<p>reason to split.</p>
<p>The things that happened in the jungle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To be told about in the book. Is it going to be an audiobook, or is it just going to be,</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s going to voice it?</p>
<p>Might be a play.</p>
<p>A musical?</p>
<p>Yeah, a musical.</p>
<p>On Broadway. How&rsquo;s your singing voice?</p>
<p>Mine&rsquo;s not so good, but Nicky has a beautiful voice.</p>
<p>Does he? Of an angel? I bet. Okay. Speaking of the social media drama, I should mention that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to, recently, to Gordon a bunch. I&rsquo;ve talked to him about talking to you guys,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s had nothing but really nice things to say about you, Nicky Ryan.</p>
<p>And he has had nothing but bad things.</p>
<p>What was some of the things?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just go to the social media first,</p>
<p>because the social media stuff that he said publicly is just like a warm-up. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>foreplay, I guess. So, Gordon sent you, Nicky Ryan, flowers for Valentine&rsquo;s Day,</p>
<p>posting on Instagram, quote, I&rsquo;ve been fucking him in every round and competition since we met</p>
<p>in 2018. The least I can do is buy him flowers.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t get the flowers.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was the question. Did you get the flowers? You never got the flowers.</p>
<p>He sent it to the wrong address.</p>
<p>He did?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where do you think he sent it?</p>
<p>It was close, but it was wrong.</p>
<p>Did you appreciate the romantic gesture?</p>
<p>I did. I was looking forward to the flowers and potentially chocolates in there,</p>
<p>but it was a bit of a letdown.</p>
<p>Can you describe your recent match against Gordon, the EBI match?</p>
<p>Okay, so EBI match on UFC Fight Pass, it was a 20-minute match.</p>
<p>And immediately, no match starts. I pull guard, and then I stand up, he pulls guard.</p>
<p>And we have this kind of like back and forth where he&rsquo;s trying to dig for underhooks,</p>
<p>trying to get on top of me, and he can&rsquo;t really find success.</p>
<p>And then in the midst of me trying to work my body lock pass,</p>
<p>Gordon&rsquo;s able to underhook a leg, and we end up in a leg entanglement.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m able to transfer that leg entanglement to a 50-50 position,</p>
<p>still in the leg entanglement.</p>
<p>From that 50-50 position, I&rsquo;m able to separate his feet and actually get a few pops.</p>
<p>And he actually said I broke his foot in that exchange.</p>
<p>With a toehold.</p>
<p>A toehold, yep.</p>
<p>And after that, we had a bit more.</p>
<p>I was just working on top positions, trying to get my body lock.</p>
<p>Time runs out, and we go to overtime.</p>
<p>And overtime&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you hold on a second?</p>
<p>Actually, what does it mean to break a leg?</p>
<p>I was very confused about&hellip;</p>
<p>Is this like an expression, or what do you mean?</p>
<p>Which part breaks in a toehold?</p>
<p>Okay, so in a toehold, there&rsquo;s a few different grades of it.</p>
<p>Like you could get a few pops and have some walking issues.</p>
<p>And people consider that a break.</p>
<p>And then you could break it fully and have your foot be like a limp noodle.</p>
<p>I think what goes to Achilles?</p>
<p>What is the front of the Achilles or something?</p>
<p>I mean, probably the ligaments.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s funny, a lot of people say they broke something.</p>
<p>But to me, you break bones, you tear ligaments.</p>
<p>So I would imagine you probably had a grade three tear.</p>
<p>Grade three.</p>
<p>How hard do you think is it to&hellip;</p>
<p>I always wondered that with a straight foot lock,</p>
<p>how hard is it to break the shin?</p>
<p>Or the actual bones, versus to tear stuff?</p>
<p>Depends how many steroids they&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>And obviously how much you&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the few guys that have actually broken bones in competition.</p>
<p>Yeah, have I?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, Vinny.</p>
<p>A couple, yeah.</p>
<p>Which bone did you break?</p>
<p>Spiral fracture of the fibula.</p>
<p>Very specific.</p>
<p>A lot of power right there.</p>
<p>Is it like a twist thing?</p>
<p>How did you break it?</p>
<p>Oh, it was a heel hook.</p>
<p>Vinny always used to say heel hooks don&rsquo;t work, leg locks don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, age gets the best of all of us.</p>
<p>I think he had some mileage on those ligaments.</p>
<p>And the bone, I guess, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually what, the bone?</p>
<p>Yeah, his ankle disconnected from the tibia and the fibula,</p>
<p>but the fibula definitely snouts pretty bad there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>The dynamics of that.</p>
<p>Okay, anyway, it went into overtime.</p>
<p>What happened in overtime?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll have an overtime.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, trying to hang.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, I go defense first.</p>
<p>Whistle blows, I&rsquo;m able to escape in like 17 seconds.</p>
<p>And then immediately after I go on his back</p>
<p>and he gets out in exactly 17 seconds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, shit.</p>
<p>All right, I thought I had a good start.</p>
<p>And then he gets on my back right after that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s able to ride me out for pretty much the entire round.</p>
<p>After that, I go back on his back.</p>
<p>He escapes in maybe like a minute and some change.</p>
<p>I think where I went wrong in the overtime is I should have been less adamant</p>
<p>about chasing the submission and more aware of collecting time.</p>
<p>If I kind of diverted my attention towards acquiring time on the clock,</p>
<p>it would have been more in my favor.</p>
<p>But yeah, at the end of my overtime round,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to lock up a renegade choke over the face.</p>
<p>But there just wasn&rsquo;t enough time to fully finish.</p>
<p>I got a few seconds of squeeze in there.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to adjust.</p>
<p>Do you think if you&rsquo;re on steroids, you would have finished the choke?</p>
<p>I mean, for sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought too.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on gear, you&rsquo;re changing the biology of your body.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re adjusting your DNA.</p>
<p>For sure, if I adjust in my DNA, I mean, it&rsquo;s a finish.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re implying you&rsquo;re a natural athlete is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m definitely a natural athlete, yeah.</p>
<p>Heavy implication.</p>
<p>Okay, so for people who don&rsquo;t know, the EBI rules,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting rule structure where the overtime,</p>
<p>you put yourself in the worst possible position.</p>
<p>The task is to escape and then the other person gets the same thing.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about that rule set?</p>
<p>I like it just because, first of all, I don&rsquo;t like the idea</p>
<p>of having to put somebody on my back.</p>
<p>But I do like the definitive answer in the match.</p>
<p>Either you escaped in time or you got ridden out.</p>
<p>So you get to define a winner, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather have that than a close decision</p>
<p>and it kind of goes the other way.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Honestly, all the different rules, when I look at the rule sets,</p>
<p>I just try to think of what rule set I could beat that individual in</p>
<p>and I sort of gear myself towards that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the strategy there.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some guys that stall a lot,</p>
<p>that you would love to have EBI overtime with at the end.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re stalling until they have to give us a good position.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s some guys that are so good in those positions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, maybe we just do a regular match.</p>
<p>What are the rules in the streets?</p>
<p>The streets?</p>
<p>No time limit.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also concrete and cars and stuff.</p>
<p>Concrete, biting.</p>
<p>Biting, yeah, poking.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you don&rsquo;t like that rule set?</p>
<p>Are there some people you would prefer in the street as a rule set?</p>
<p>Me, probably not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know though, EBI.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s tricky, it depends on the opponent,</p>
<p>which rule set I&rsquo;d want to do.</p>
<p>Wow, what about you, Nicker?</p>
<p>What do you think about the rule set of EBI?</p>
<p>Yes, I think EBI is very good from a spectator point of view.</p>
<p>People find it very entertaining to watch,</p>
<p>because people want to see submissions,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting the athletes in a position</p>
<p>where you have the highest percentage submission in the sport.</p>
<p>So obviously, you&rsquo;re going to get a lot of submissions.</p>
<p>My issue with it is, it is a rule set that allows somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s overall worse at jiu-jitsu to win a match.</p>
<p>A guy can go out there and just stall</p>
<p>and just get completely dominated for the entirety of regulation,</p>
<p>and then he gets to start on the guy&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my one issue with it.</p>
<p>But also, I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting to see the best people in the world</p>
<p>have to be put in a really bad position</p>
<p>to see how good their escapes are, for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel realistic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun thing to watch, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like the real fight.</p>
<p>It feels weird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll claim it.</p>
<p>If I start an overtime on someone and finish them, I&rsquo;ll claim it.</p>
<p>But if they submit me an overtime, I&rsquo;m like, awesome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good to know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a real submission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>The issue is people stalling to just win the overtime.</p>
<p>So where you got this guy, his whole training camp</p>
<p>is just not get subbed and win the overtime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit boring.</p>
<p>By the way, I have a rose behind you.</p>
<p>Somebody gave me a Valentine&rsquo;s flower.</p>
<p>So if you missed the one from Gordon, I got one for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to feel loved.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So what did you learn from that match?</p>
<p>Like takeaways, technically speaking, what do you need to work on?</p>
<p>Well, I learned that I am pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty good.</p>
<p>I know exactly what my weakness is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the leg lock department.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m doing a lot to get better in that specific aspect.</p>
<p>Attack and defense?</p>
<p>I would say, yeah, attack, defense, reattacks.</p>
<p>Even if I wanted to offensively enter a leg,</p>
<p>I could use some work there as well.</p>
<p>But I feel like once I solidify,</p>
<p>if I become a black belt specifically in the leg lock department,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;d be unstoppable.</p>
<p>If you, Nicky Rod, definitively beat Gordon Ryan, how would you do it?</p>
<p>Buggy choke.</p>
<p>Buggy choke.</p>
<p>Buggy choke.</p>
<p>For the listener, I don&rsquo;t even know how to describe buggy choke.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the definitive conclusion on that choke?</p>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a choke that you do when you&rsquo;re in a,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the opposite of a dominant?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not submissive.</p>
<p>In a non-dominant position of bottom of side control.</p>
<p>Yeah, just an embarrassing submission to get caught with, really.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But does it work?</p>
<p>It works on certain people.</p>
<p>For the listener, he glassed over at Nicky Rod.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing, but it&rsquo;s also a way to frustrate the opponent.</p>
<p>For sure, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new part of the sport.</p>
<p>I feel like the Rotolos brought it back into fashion,</p>
<p>and even if you don&rsquo;t get it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of those moves that&rsquo;s so embarrassing,</p>
<p>at the first sign of danger, the top guy abandons ship,</p>
<p>and you can basically retain guard by attempting a very embarrassing submission.</p>
<p>So the threat of embarrassment to everybody.</p>
<p>People pull out very quick to avoid suffering the consequences.</p>
<p>I think some people underestimate how good of a submission it is.</p>
<p>I mean, once you&rsquo;re locked in there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not too many defenses for a buggy choke.</p>
<p>Is there an instructional on the way from you?</p>
<p>J-Rod, actually, my little brother has one.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, for real?</p>
<p>You actually legit have&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Well, check it out.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re making a joke out of it,</p>
<p>but it is a real, there&rsquo;s a system to it.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we call it a system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good move.</p>
<p>I mean, you take an opponent that was just winning</p>
<p>in a greatly dominant position,</p>
<p>and then boom, in that same position,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty much, they&rsquo;re losing.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s an interesting move.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name of the, what&rsquo;s the name of it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Buggypedia, like J-Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Okay, the Buggypedia.</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;d be something like very Craig Jones-y about it.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t want to sort of reveal the secrets</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re working on, but in general,</p>
<p>what does it take to beat Gordon, I guess, is the question.</p>
<p>It would have to be some kind of a choke.</p>
<p>I think any joint lock or anything like that,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just gonna let it break and stay in the match.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t even think he&rsquo;d tap from like a renegade choke.</p>
<p>I think I would have to put him to sleep.</p>
<p>So putting him to sleep is how I would win.</p>
<p>So Gordon is somebody who really hates losing.</p>
<p>Yeah, like he won&rsquo;t even tap in the practice room.</p>
<p>I remember like I had a toehold</p>
<p>a couple of times in practice room,</p>
<p>and he was just comfortable like working there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m not really putting much on it.</p>
<p>I think he just, you know,</p>
<p>maybe because of situations like that in practice,</p>
<p>he kind of didn&rsquo;t respect my toehold&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>in the competition.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done that to me in the practice.</p>
<p>I have, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I gave you a little-</p>
<p>Gave me a little pop and then he let go.</p>
<p>And that was only 10% right there.</p>
<p>Hey, don&rsquo;t get into math.</p>
<p>Okay, is there some part of that</p>
<p>you think is necessary to be a champion</p>
<p>as to like this almost unwillingness</p>
<p>in competition to tap?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s definitely something to be said</p>
<p>for people that are just like,</p>
<p>you know, willing to go that extra mile</p>
<p>or to take that damage to secure their victory.</p>
<p>Is there a part of you that like would hate to tap</p>
<p>or hates to tap?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, all of me would hate that.</p>
<p>The whole part of me.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a John Legend song like that?</p>
<p>All of you and all of me?</p>
<p>Very romantic, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, we&rsquo;re sticking on that theme.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, one of the things Gordon asked,</p>
<p>I forget how you put it</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a lot of words</p>
<p>that would need to be censored involved,</p>
<p>but he said, ask them how it feels</p>
<p>to have a zero five record against me</p>
<p>with four submissions combined.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure he could count to five.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an impressive thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>Oh, and five.</p>
<p>I mean, I will say one thing.</p>
<p>Nobody beats me four times.</p>
<p>I love you so much.</p>
<p>Lex, I did have a question.</p>
<p>I did have a question for you.</p>
<p>There was some controversy on your Twitter</p>
<p>about a list of books.</p>
<p>And I was wondering why Gordon&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t featured amongst that literature.</p>
<p>Well, it was only the first 30 books</p>
<p>or like the first 20 books.</p>
<p>And it would of course be in the-</p>
<p>Something interesting about Gordon.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the first author</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s written more books than he&rsquo;s read.</p>
<p>Pretty good.</p>
<p>If you face him and beat him,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your take on what it takes to beat Gordon?</p>
<p>I mean, you guys kind of joke</p>
<p>and they go pretty hard recently on each other,</p>
<p>but as a fan of jujitsu,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in on this rivalry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fun to watch.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I go really hard with him.</p>
<p>I think Gordon, he&rsquo;s pretty sensitive.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking for a large insult in a small insult.</p>
<p>And for me, like Australians,</p>
<p>we just attack each other all day, every day.</p>
<p>And for me, like if I see someone</p>
<p>that takes himself very seriously,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like blood in the water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny to me.</p>
<p>To me, if I can just gently provoke</p>
<p>and get a strong reaction, that&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Like Aussies, we will just attack each other.</p>
<p>And the first person that gets upset,</p>
<p>he kind of loses the exchange.</p>
<p>So I think that is very, very entertaining.</p>
<p>Like if you were to beat Gordon,</p>
<p>would the mental game off the mat be part of it?</p>
<p>I think it would be a factor for sure.</p>
<p>But I mean, I&rsquo;m never going to come out</p>
<p>too crazy direct with him.</p>
<p>You know, like I find that like</p>
<p>if you get too upset online and you&rsquo;re going crazy,</p>
<p>I find that I&rsquo;d be embarrassed to do that myself.</p>
<p>Obviously everyone&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Everyone has a different style, you know?</p>
<p>But like, yeah, I think mental,</p>
<p>the mental aspect would play a big factor.</p>
<p>I mean, mainly because if I were to beat him,</p>
<p>I would send him a message every day until I died.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just to gently remind him that I got the last one.</p>
<p>The last one is all that matters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not giving, we&rsquo;re not giving a score here.</p>
<p>So like once you beat him,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to run for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>I mean, run, but look back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With messages.</p>
<p>A sidestep.</p>
<p>Ride, ride your horse into the sunset.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, you&rsquo;ve talked very lightly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked shit very lightly</p>
<p>against Alexander Volkanovsky&rsquo;s opponent.</p>
<p>Very lightly.</p>
<p>Have you received death threats or how are you still alive?</p>
<p>Like Gordon, I would say people from Dagestan</p>
<p>take a joke very well.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Do they really?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, like Gordon.</p>
<p>Oh, like, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slow.</p>
<p>Now I was doing aggressive mode in my head.</p>
<p>Now honestly, Islam was pretty cool.</p>
<p>I wanted to stir it up a bit, you know,</p>
<p>cause like I felt like that was a massive fight</p>
<p>and it probably should have had more attention</p>
<p>than it was receiving.</p>
<p>So I wanted to just gently stir it up a bit.</p>
<p>I feel like Sambo guys are in the same vein as catch wrestlers.</p>
<p>Very sensitive.</p>
<p>You know, like obviously there&rsquo;s only three people</p>
<p>in the world that do catch wrestling,</p>
<p>Sambo, maybe 10 to 15.</p>
<p>So I figured we could really provoke them</p>
<p>with that sort of jujitsu Sambo stuff.</p>
<p>Islam took the jokes very well.</p>
<p>The Russian fans, not so much.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very serious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many smiles in Russia, you know.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t take it as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to suppress the anger</p>
<p>that Raysha&rsquo;s building up inside me slowly.</p>
<p>So you guys mentioned steroids.</p>
<p>I like that you bring that up</p>
<p>after we talk about Russia for the record.</p>
<p>Smooth, smooth segue there.</p>
<p>I cannot condone the statements said by the Aussie.</p>
<p>But I would love to travel with you to Russia.</p>
<p>That would be a good time.</p>
<p>You might get killed with me now.</p>
<p>No, I would be like the first to turn to backstab you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I got in there, get in.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Are most of the top grapplers on steroids?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>You know, some people look like shit</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re on steroids.</p>
<p>Some people look excellent and they&rsquo;re not on steroids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, so hard to tell.</p>
<p>That seems to be the general consensus</p>
<p>that a lot of people on steroids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always a little bit, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone take steroids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never taken steroids.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if that&rsquo;s the right term to use</p>
<p>or like TRT, any of that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very careful to not let my naivete</p>
<p>lead me to take conclusions.</p>
<p>But I do feel a little bit weird about</p>
<p>the witch hunt nature of it.</p>
<p>That some people a little bit too eagerly claim</p>
<p>that others aren&rsquo;t on steroids</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re successful.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>it does seem that a lot of athletes</p>
<p>will do whatever it takes to be successful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if a sport doesn&rsquo;t test,</p>
<p>you got to assume most people are going to do it.</p>
<p>And especially now as more money comes into the sport,</p>
<p>you got to assume more people are going to do it.</p>
<p>I generally like do AGCC and like does Jiu-Jitsu test?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually encouraged.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s encouraged?</p>
<p>You get a pamphlet.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t test.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no testing.</p>
<p>They test to make sure we&rsquo;re on steroids</p>
<p>because obviously it&rsquo;s a big show</p>
<p>for the UFC, Fight Pass in the future.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want anyone coming in out of shape.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>Do you think using steroids in that kind of context</p>
<p>in sports is wrong?</p>
<p>Like stepping away, if it&rsquo;s not illegal.</p>
<p>I mean, do you think ethically speaking?</p>
<p>I like to assume everyone&rsquo;s on steroids</p>
<p>and I have to feel bad about using steroids myself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you use all of the steroids?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over 30, it&rsquo;s DRD, that&rsquo;s the medical definition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the medical, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to meet your doctor.</p>
<p>Therapeutic use.</p>
<p>Therapeutic, right.</p>
<p>How do you just feel about it?</p>
<p>I mean, it is cheating for sure.</p>
<p>Whether they test for it or not, I think it is cheating.</p>
<p>Obviously, some people are going to say,</p>
<p>oh, fuck, everyone&rsquo;s on it.</p>
<p>I should be able to get away with it.</p>
<p>It makes it even playing field.</p>
<p>But it kind of becomes Russian roulette</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like if one guy is taking a small amount</p>
<p>and the other guy is taking a huge amount,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to reap huge rewards in the short term,</p>
<p>probably be dead pretty early, but die a champion, mind you.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know what that one is.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s worthy to take health risks just for the glory?</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re 40 about to die</p>
<p>looking at a cabinet of gold medals for wrestling other men,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not going to hit the same way on your deathbed.</p>
<p>Sorry, in which direction?</p>
<p>Is that a good thing or not?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re probably going to feel like,</p>
<p>oh, fuck, I probably wasted a bit of health on that.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that like the glory of it?</p>
<p>You said other men.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, in my opinion, I maybe wrestle a woman as well.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;d you do with Gabby on Valentine&rsquo;s Day?</p>
<p>What did you take her?</p>
<p>We filmed some new stuff for OnlyFans.</p>
<p>For OnlyFans.</p>
<p>We never stopped working.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the love affair is also a work affair.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to that, I mean, like Olympic gold medalists</p>
<p>accomplishing the heights, sacrificing everything,</p>
<p>everything, the first 20, 30 years of your life</p>
<p>for this silly little piece of metal.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something beautiful to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like conspires a lot, a lot of people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the height of the human condition in a way.</p>
<p>What if you survive?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, if you&rsquo;re in your deathbed early in life.</p>
<p>We all die.</p>
<p>All men die, Jones, but not all men truly live.</p>
<p>How many years are you willing to shave off for a gold medal?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>How many?</p>
<p>How many are you willing to shave off for a gold medal?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re for a silver medal.</p>
<p>For a silver, I mean, for a silver medal, I&rsquo;d shave a few off.</p>
<p>I think two silvers makes a gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth five years.</p>
<p>Five to 10, maybe.</p>
<p>Shave off the bad years, enhance the good ones.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you&rsquo;ve sacrificed.</p>
<p>You guys sacrificed a lot, a lot of your life.</p>
<p>You continue to sacrifice.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see it as sacrifice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I think training&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Being a bit adamant about it, consistent, gives you,</p>
<p>I mean, I think we have a great routine, great ritual.</p>
<p>Definitely enjoy the process.</p>
<p>All right, well, do you guys know, this is bro science,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m talking to bro scientists,</p>
<p>but do you know how long steroids stay in your system?</p>
<p>Forever?</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>Oh, because it&rsquo;s like, hey, once you do it, you own it.</p>
<p>Yeah, just the knowledge.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s different for each steroid, right?</p>
<p>I think some of them last longer than others.</p>
<p>It depends if it&rsquo;s a urine.</p>
<p>You would think I would do a little research before this,</p>
<p>asking these questions.</p>
<p>Why do you think most athletes and coaches</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk about steroids?</p>
<p>Like, why is it such a secret?</p>
<p>Why is it so embarrassing?</p>
<p>I think they probably talk about it</p>
<p>amongst the team and whatnot.</p>
<p>Again, I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be more shady</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like your sport is tested or whatnot,</p>
<p>or kind of in the wild west, in the grappling world, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, but why don&rsquo;t grapplers talk about it?</p>
<p>Because it seems cheating.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of insinuated as a bit of cheating,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not tested.</p>
<p>I mean, still, you&rsquo;re taking a person</p>
<p>that maybe has good jiu-jitsu, good mechanics,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting them on the leg,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re subbing you with a heel hook</p>
<p>versus breaking your leg with a heel hook.</p>
<p>You know, something as subtle as that</p>
<p>can make big differences.</p>
<p>All right, this is gonna make me sound dumb,</p>
<p>but is it possible that steroids</p>
<p>are not a huge help in grappling?</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re bad at jiu-jitsu and you do steroids,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna continue to be bad at jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re great at gear,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, if you&rsquo;re great at grappling,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re great at grappling,</p>
<p>and then you also do gear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna enhance what you&rsquo;re already good at</p>
<p>and make you much better.</p>
<p>But like how much is the enhancement,</p>
<p>I guess is the question.</p>
<p>How much is muscle valued?</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing gear</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not changing weight that much,</p>
<p>maybe it helps you a little bit.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re gaining 50, 60 pounds of pure muscle,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a huge enhancement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another human.</p>
<p>Does muscle, a small human, yeah.</p>
<p>Does muscle matter in jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>I guess is the question.</p>
<p>Is it possible that it gets in the way?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say muscle matters, but technique matters more.</p>
<p>I also think that it&rsquo;ll help you develop technique as well,</p>
<p>because obviously testosterone helps with recovery rate.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on gear, you&rsquo;re able to train a lot more.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, if you&rsquo;re not able to learn,</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s not gonna help in that aspect.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re somebody that knows how to learn</p>
<p>and get good at jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>and then you add gear on top of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to do significantly more sessions</p>
<p>throughout the week.</p>
<p>Okay, and by the way, gear is steroids?</p>
<p>Steroids, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I also think that you don&rsquo;t have to be as consistent</p>
<p>in like your sleep and your food and stuff.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on gear, you have a little bit of leeway.</p>
<p>But I mean, being consistent in your diet and your sleep</p>
<p>definitely would help the process.</p>
<p>Since you use most steroids of any athlete I&rsquo;ve ever met,</p>
<p>do you think steroids help jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>I think obviously it helps recovery</p>
<p>and your ability to train more.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen some guys go on steroids</p>
<p>and then suddenly they feel like the Incredible Hulk.</p>
<p>And now in the training room,</p>
<p>they start to rely more on strength</p>
<p>than the techniques they had.</p>
<p>And it actually, in some respect, hinders them</p>
<p>and makes them gas more in competition</p>
<p>because then they&rsquo;re using more of the muscle</p>
<p>they never used to have.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve implied that you&rsquo;re a natural athlete.</p>
<p>You said that.</p>
<p>You said that skeptically.</p>
<p>Why are you skeptical, Lex?</p>
<p>Is this something you do for social media</p>
<p>to talk shit to Gordon,</p>
<p>to imply that he&rsquo;s not a natural athlete?</p>
<p>Well, I only pretty much recently on social media,</p>
<p>I had this rebuttal saying that Gordon&rsquo;s on gear.</p>
<p>And I only said that because after our match</p>
<p>in our most recent match, the EBI rules match,</p>
<p>he accused me of greasing, which is like lubing up.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m slippery during our match.</p>
<p>And you did not?</p>
<p>I did not.</p>
<p>I was checked multiple times before</p>
<p>and after our grappling event.</p>
<p>And he still went out and accused me of this.</p>
<p>So I was like, all right, as opposed to telling a lie,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell the truth about your steroid use,</p>
<p>which it shouldn&rsquo;t be that big of a deal in retrospect</p>
<p>because he kind of admitted it and whatnot previously.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, yeah, I just kind of felt like I had to rebuttal.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t do it immediately</p>
<p>because I was like, all right,</p>
<p>I know I have this podcast plan.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll wait to do it on my friend, Mark Bell&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>You know, be a little bit more,</p>
<p>get a little bit more exposure on it.</p>
<p>And yeah, I knew he was gonna bite the bait,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t think he was gonna bite the bait that hard.</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;s a little stressed out about the comment,</p>
<p>but you know.</p>
<p>And that was the origin of you guys going back and forth on?</p>
<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t so much back and forth.</p>
<p>It was just, I went forth</p>
<p>and then he kept going back, back, back.</p>
<p>Like I remember one of my guys DMed me</p>
<p>and they were like, Gordon&rsquo;s made like 68 Instagram stories</p>
<p>and 67 of them were all about you.</p>
<p>I was like, all right, well, I&rsquo;m in his head for sure.</p>
<p>Got us a few followers.</p>
<p>We appreciate that.</p>
<p>We did, we did get followers.</p>
<p>He even shouted out our B-team white belt program.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, speaking of which, what&rsquo;s the B-team?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it run?</p>
<p>And why is it called the B-team?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, Craig-</p>
<p>Was the A-team taken?</p>
<p>I would have been.</p>
<p>For me, B&rsquo;s for best.</p>
<p>Best, all right.</p>
<p>What does B stand for, for you?</p>
<p>What does it represent?</p>
<p>What is the ideal, like, you know,</p>
<p>Miyamoto Musashi philosophical foundation of B-team?</p>
<p>Aim low and achieve.</p>
<p>If the bar is set low, you can&rsquo;t help but win.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Nikki&rsquo;s philosophy with women as well.</p>
<p>Set the bar incredibly low, overachieve.</p>
<p>What is the B-team?</p>
<p>How do you guys run it?</p>
<p>Like what, yeah, I mean, can you just talk about the school?</p>
<p>How you found it?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like?</p>
<p>I mean, pretty much just a regular jujitsu gym.</p>
<p>We started as sort of a pros only, purple belt and above team.</p>
<p>And we have me, Nikki Rod, Nikki Ryan, Ethan, Damian as coaches.</p>
<p>Am I missing someone?</p>
<p>Your memory with your old age.</p>
<p>Impeccable memory, yeah.</p>
<p>And we got JB coming on to teach white belts.</p>
<p>But just your stock standard jujitsu team.</p>
<p>We focus on more, we lean heavily towards the professional athlete side of things.</p>
<p>We have a lot of high-level guys in that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Class structure, regular instruction, positional sparring, open rounds.</p>
<p>But we sort of took a heavy slant on marketing side of things.</p>
<p>We really try to blow up the YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Obviously we sell a lot of clothing, merchandise and stuff.</p>
<p>So yeah, we just sort of took a modern approach to a standard jujitsu gym.</p>
<p>Because I mean, jujitsu gyms are full of some of the most boring human beings on earth.</p>
<p>So we try to highlight-</p>
<p>Strong words, Craig Young.</p>
<p>Strong words.</p>
<p>Highlight the other side of things.</p>
<p>Keep it pretty light hearted.</p>
<p>That it can be fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, that jujitsu can be fun.</p>
<p>I guess that it can be cool too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just full of steroided up autistic people.</p>
<p>Question from Reddit.</p>
<p>Need to hear some of the stories about drop-ins that led to the making of the gem of a video,</p>
<p>the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of training a B team.</p>
<p>Any fun stories?</p>
<p>Any ones that stand out?</p>
<p>Do you guys remember any?</p>
<p>Police involved ever?</p>
<p>We had a guy come around to kick him out.</p>
<p>He was stalking two of the members.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s just crazy people.</p>
<p>You know, like I portray a pretty insane image online.</p>
<p>And I guess I am that a lot of the time.</p>
<p>But at training, try to keep it&hellip;</p>
<p>While training.</p>
<p>Around training, I&rsquo;m insulting everyone.</p>
<p>But while training, I try to keep it pretty serious.</p>
<p>But obviously, the image I portray lures in some of the crazier members.</p>
<p>I mean, like the thing is about the gym you guys run is really professional.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like friendly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the lighthearted joking is there, obviously.</p>
<p>You know, like shit talk and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I guess it&rsquo;s a pretty safe environment.</p>
<p>But the public persona might attract some&hellip;</p>
<p>Some maniacs.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say which places I&rsquo;ve trained.</p>
<p>But obviously, some places you walk into the room and it&rsquo;s very, very serious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no smiles around.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s probably average training room in Russia.</p>
<p>But no smiles.</p>
<p>Very serious environment.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I definitely don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to show up to training and be walking on eggshells.</p>
<p>Not know what the coach&rsquo;s mood&rsquo;s like that day.</p>
<p>I want to go and have a good time.</p>
<p>Keep it lighthearted.</p>
<p>What was in the video?</p>
<p>What are the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts?</p>
<p>Because like the address is public.</p>
<p>Like anyone can show up.</p>
<p>Anyone can show up.</p>
<p>Yeah, what were the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts?</p>
<p>Does anyone challenge you like to a fight?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>I mean, probably from other gyms in town, that&rsquo;s probably coming down the line.</p>
<p>But do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all in on that.</p>
<p>I would be excited as a fan to just watch.</p>
<p>The love of the drama.</p>
<p>Not the drama.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Well, a little drama, a little drop of poison is good.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it&rsquo;s the best grapplers in the world.</p>
<p>Kind of going at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Because maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>But I think there is an underlying deep camaraderie at the end of the day.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re like at the top of the world.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like in the same town.</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a shitty Western.</p>
<p>But like an epic Western.</p>
<p>With like Clint Eastwood, like the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>
<p>Of course, I love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here just eating popcorn like that.</p>
<p>Staring in the pot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not staring in the pot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not staring in the pot.</p>
<p>These questions are from Reddit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna feed me.</p>
<p>That one for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s best grappler, hates you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gently provoking him behind the scenes every day.</p>
<p>Well, I mean.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>In Texas.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve stolen his brother.</p>
<p>Held him for ransom.</p>
<p>It is like a story of a shitty Western, I think.</p>
<p>You now allow white belts to train with you.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like to open it up to a bigger audience?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t opened it up yet.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see.</p>
<p>I feel like your higher belts, they really understand what the training room is.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>White belts are early.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to find their place in the gym.</p>
<p>Could be kind of awkward and stuff in that environment.</p>
<p>So I think, obviously, those white belts coming in will change the dynamic.</p>
<p>But the white belts will have separate white belt classes, obviously, for them.</p>
<p>Because given it&rsquo;s such a high-level gym, it&rsquo;d be tough for a beginner to be able to</p>
<p>enter the more advanced classes.</p>
<p>Well, obviously, we&rsquo;re teaching more advanced techniques.</p>
<p>So yeah, we&rsquo;ve separated a white belt program, I believe, 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe we&rsquo;ll have a Saturday one as well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how it goes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to do things different.</p>
<p>You know, like trying to do your traditional jiu-jitsu gyms.</p>
<p>Obviously, you&rsquo;re not going to teach beginners wrestling at all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to split it at least 33% top game, bottom game, and wrestling.</p>
<p>So at least create more well-rounded athletes from day one.</p>
<p>Whereas I feel like most traditional jiu-jitsu gyms might have nogi once a week.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t touch wrestling.</p>
<p>Very IBJJF-heavy techniques.</p>
<p>But again, the sport&rsquo;s changing, for sure.</p>
<p>Just to take that on, how does a beginner get good at jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>Like, given that you&rsquo;re starting this white belt, what&rsquo;s your philosophy on that?</p>
<p>Obviously, buy all of my instructionals at full price.</p>
<p>Not during a sale.</p>
<p>That would go a long way.</p>
<p>For those of you who are Russians, I&rsquo;ll send you instructions, or all the forms,</p>
<p>so you know how to steal it.</p>
<p>Yeah, discount code.</p>
<p>I bought them all, so I&rsquo;ll just send it to you for free.</p>
<p>I mean, we do have the Makachev50 discount code, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Offering discounts to help him out for the rematch.</p>
<p>I got the&hellip;</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Well, I got a 100% discount for you if you need it.</p>
<p>But that said, your instructional are both hilarious and brilliant.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the most respected instructionals out there, with incredibly great names.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It probably loses me sales, honestly, due to removing the seriousness of the textbook.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s going to kind of suck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be some funny gimmicky thing.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, some people don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s a real product.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big hurdle I have to overcome, is they see it, and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>is that a real thing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>But how does the white belt get good?</p>
<p>I think they just have to show up.</p>
<p>Just have to put in the effort, try to focus on using techniques and training,</p>
<p>rather than just fighting to the death, you know?</p>
<p>Although that is entertaining for us to watch, two white belts fight to the death.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what are the techniques?</p>
<p>You should focus on, what&rsquo;s the process?</p>
<p>What does it mean to show up?</p>
<p>How much drilling?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>If you were to optimize the first six months of a beginner,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who would listen to this and haven&rsquo;t tried.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been curious.</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends who are just too curious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly looking for an excuse to start.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just got to be as simple as possible.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be teaching more advanced movements.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, in the grand scheme of things, there&rsquo;s highly advanced techniques,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s slightly advanced.</p>
<p>And I think trying to teach those guys real specific positions,</p>
<p>even like real specific types of guard is just beyond them.</p>
<p>I think the best way to learn is through problem solving.</p>
<p>And I think if you show the technique before they&rsquo;ve discovered that problem,</p>
<p>the learning is sort of held back.</p>
<p>So I like the idea of using kid&rsquo;s style games to show them a problem</p>
<p>and then use the techniques to fix the problems they&rsquo;ve just discovered.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the best way to learn.</p>
<p>Can you give an example of a problem to show them before you give them the techniques?</p>
<p>Like, what are we talking about?</p>
<p>So say you wanted to teach posture in wrestling.</p>
<p>You could create a game where one guy,</p>
<p>the game might be get to a leg or get to two legs,</p>
<p>control the leg, like super simple.</p>
<p>But the rules, the constraint would be one guy is forced to keep upright posture.</p>
<p>And one guy is forced, well, not forced,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s allowed to keep a bent at the hips, lower posture.</p>
<p>And obviously within that constraint,</p>
<p>the guy with the better posture is going to have more success.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to have a better posture to secure a leg or secure both legs.</p>
<p>And therefore you&rsquo;ve demonstrated the flaws of bad posture</p>
<p>without having to explain it to them before they really tested that out.</p>
<p>Okay. And then the result of that,</p>
<p>you would realize that the bent over posture is better.</p>
<p>Yeah. You have that aha moment rather than just having it spoken to you.</p>
<p>Uh, you wrote, Craig, I&rsquo;m a big fan of constraint-based learning,</p>
<p>I guess, which is what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I love presenting beginners with a problem before the solution,</p>
<p>like here, attempt to hold side control with no cues on how.</p>
<p>Then I see how the guy got out and address issue by issue,</p>
<p>cross face and hip control and so on.</p>
<p>Okay. So what are some other examples like side control?</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be an excellent one, side control.</p>
<p>Like obviously we say, oh, you secure a cross face so they can&rsquo;t turn into you.</p>
<p>Much easier to have them try to hold someone down without explaining what a cross face is,</p>
<p>and then use that technique to address the problem they&rsquo;ve just encountered.</p>
<p>So I think you could do that with a lot of areas of jujitsu, like even more advanced,</p>
<p>say 50, 50, obviously a mirrored position where you both have access to each other&rsquo;s heels.</p>
<p>Most people will stall out in that position and keep their feet crossed.</p>
<p>I think a great constraint for both of them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t cross your feet.</p>
<p>Now you have to learn how to slip the heel hook when they expose it</p>
<p>and how to safely re-attack of your own.</p>
<p>So the constraint is you can&rsquo;t be too defensive in that position.</p>
<p>And I think the rate of learning increases.</p>
<p>Why do you think the rate of learning increases?</p>
<p>Like why do you think that works?</p>
<p>Because you encounter more problems.</p>
<p>Say in that situation, they&rsquo;re going to get your heel a lot more</p>
<p>in whatever period of time you allocate the drill for than if the legs are crossed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the hard part&rsquo;s splitting the legs to get to the submission.</p>
<p>I think the hard part&rsquo;s practicing control while they&rsquo;re trying to slip it at a later stage.</p>
<p>And then obviously trying to slip your heel when you&rsquo;re in more danger</p>
<p>also makes you more comfortable in that bad position</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re used to doing it with open legs.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that probably that style of teaching forces people to focus on&hellip;</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so easy to fall into focusing on like memorizing</p>
<p>a particular details of a technique</p>
<p>without thinking like, why the hell does this even work?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that, you get to focus on like,</p>
<p>from like as cliche as it sounds from first principles,</p>
<p>like why the hell do I get out of this?</p>
<p>Like, why does this even work?</p>
<p>Why does wrestling work?</p>
<p>Why do you have a bent over posture?</p>
<p>You get to start to ask those kinds of questions.</p>
<p>Which is kind of interesting because it&rsquo;s not obvious to me</p>
<p>that bent over posture is the right posture for Jiu-Jitsu, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confused actually about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>About the correct posture?</p>
<p>Yeah, for Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right answer?</p>
<p>I think bent over posture is still good for Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
<p>Even with the Judo and all that.</p>
<p>Like, why are so many Jiu-Jitsu people like at a high level,</p>
<p>the posture is higher up?</p>
<p>Well, I think wrestling posture is just a bit too low</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not necessary, right?</p>
<p>If wrestlers are like low enough to the ground</p>
<p>where your hands could touch the mat.</p>
<p>But in Jiu-Jitsu, it&rsquo;s kind of a mix between like wrestling</p>
<p>and like Judo or Greco-Roman wrestling.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s just a bit more relaxed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s bent over, but it&rsquo;s not upright.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also not super low.</p>
<p>A bit more room for error too,</p>
<p>because obviously the Jiu-Jitsu guy shot</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to be as athletic or as quick as a wrestler,</p>
<p>especially a wrestler with shoes.</p>
<p>So it actually comes down to the fact that Jiu-Jitsu people</p>
<p>just on average, even at the top level,</p>
<p>are not good at shooting.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think obviously, I mean,</p>
<p>all the wrestlers in American stuff,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting super early, super young.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>By the time they get to the same age we are really</p>
<p>in our sport and stuff,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve spent much longer doing the actual sport</p>
<p>than the average Jiu-Jitsu guy.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another level of wrestling, of course,</p>
<p>with the Soviet block.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just unachievable for your kind.</p>
<p>Who knew an Australian rugby?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A former rugby player.</p>
<p>Rugby, is that kind of like American football,</p>
<p>but much less money?</p>
<p>Is that what that is?</p>
<p>Much less money, much tougher, I would say.</p>
<p>But who knew that the cure</p>
<p>to the Dagestani wrestling were the Aussies?</p>
<p>Were the Aussies?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Your friend, your training partner, Alexander Volkanovsky,</p>
<p>you helped him prepare for the Islam Makachev</p>
<p>versus Volkanovsky fight.</p>
<p>Who do you think, first of all, won that fight?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky one.</p>
<p>How is that the tricky question?</p>
<p>I will say, when I was-</p>
<p>All the shit talk you&rsquo;ve been doing,</p>
<p>how is that the tricky question?</p>
<p>When I was in the corner going into the fifth,</p>
<p>I personally believed live that Volkanovsky</p>
<p>probably needed a finish to take the victory.</p>
<p>But you have to think that way, right?</p>
<p>In general, or are you legitimately-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gray area, because the judging, who knows?</p>
<p>Plus, I was like, wait, we&rsquo;re in Australia,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s this bias?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some Australian judges here.</p>
<p>I was really hoping we&rsquo;d get a bit of bias on that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately not.</p>
<p>Hopefully they lose their jobs.</p>
<p>But again, yeah, it was a close fight.</p>
<p>I think sometimes you&rsquo;re blinded in the moment,</p>
<p>because again, everyone counted Volkanovsky out,</p>
<p>the crowd&rsquo;s behind him,</p>
<p>so everything he does is going to get a huge cheer.</p>
<p>Your bias towards the smaller guy,</p>
<p>your bias towards the underdog,</p>
<p>so whatever the underdog does</p>
<p>has a bigger impact in your mind.</p>
<p>And sometimes that can bias as the fight goes along.</p>
<p>But yeah, super, super close fight.</p>
<p>I would really love them to have a rematch,</p>
<p>but obviously that&rsquo;s going to hold up both divisions,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ll be able to do it.</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;ll do a rematch soon?</p>
<p>I mean, that was an epic fight.</p>
<p>I was listening to the Fight Companion during it.</p>
<p>They all thought Volkanovsky-</p>
<p>So they biased strongly the opinion?</p>
<p>Round two was the tricky one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Round two&rsquo;s the tricky one.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;d love to see that run it back</p>
<p>and do three, actually, because it was an epic fight.</p>
<p>What was the brief conversation you had</p>
<p>with Islam Makhachev and his team?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how he would take the joke,</p>
<p>because obviously Khabib tried to flying eagle kick</p>
<p>Dylan Danis in the face.</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t sure how my humor would go.</p>
<p>But I mean, Dylan must have said some worse things to me.</p>
<p>I was just playing around.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t really take anything I say serious,</p>
<p>come across like an idiot.</p>
<p>But so when he was coming up to me afterwards,</p>
<p>I was like, oh, I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s going to say.</p>
<p>And again, maybe he would have been more upset</p>
<p>if he had lost, but he just received the judge&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>But he came up, I went to shake his hand,</p>
<p>he gave me a big hug and then pretended to throw me.</p>
<p>And then I thought the interaction was over.</p>
<p>And then he circled back.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it was so awkward.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, he&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>He wants to say, he wants something else.</p>
<p>But he just said, why didn&rsquo;t you teach your boy</p>
<p>how to escape the body triangle?</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>What did you say to that?</p>
<p>I said, well, I mean, obviously you&rsquo;ve got to learn</p>
<p>how to finish a rear naked choke.</p>
<p>Is that what you said?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I was just laughing, I was laughing.</p>
<p>But then they ushered us out.</p>
<p>They were like, get out of here</p>
<p>before the Aussie crowd attacks here, you know?</p>
<p>What do you think about the body triangle position</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re in?</p>
<p>It seemed like for the first time,</p>
<p>it seems almost like Volk was dominant in that position,</p>
<p>which is kind of weird.</p>
<p>I mean, damage is meant to trump control, MMA judging.</p>
<p>Damage is the number one factor.</p>
<p>Do you think the judges saw that?</p>
<p>What did they score that as?</p>
<p>I think they all scored four towards Islam.</p>
<p>Three and five, two of the judges scored towards Volk&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>One of the judges scored three for Islam.</p>
<p>It was 49-46 for one of them, and the other ones were 48-47.</p>
<p>I think, again, the confusing round was round two.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone scored the body triangle round</p>
<p>for Volk&rsquo;s, which I wish they had.</p>
<p>Volkanovski was and is still arguably pound for pound</p>
<p>greatest fighter in the world.</p>
<p>How long have you known him?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the first one.</p>
<p>I met him before he was in the UFC,</p>
<p>when I used to live in Melbourne.</p>
<p>He came down to train at Absolute.</p>
<p>And then we really connected on Ultimate Fighter.</p>
<p>One of these guys he was going to bring to Ultimate Fighter,</p>
<p>Brad Burdell, pulled out last second.</p>
<p>So he called me when I was in Puerto Rico,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, do you want to coach on Tough for five weeks?</p>
<p>And like I said, Puerto Rico was apocalypse now.</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, get me out of here.</p>
<p>So I jumped on that opportunity,</p>
<p>and we were in Vegas five weeks together.</p>
<p>Because he was meant to fight Ortega,</p>
<p>and then he got hit with COVID real bad.</p>
<p>I got stuck in, I think he was in hospital</p>
<p>for maybe one to two weeks.</p>
<p>And then before he flew back to Australia,</p>
<p>they were like, all right, maybe we just do you guys</p>
<p>as the Ultimate Fighter coaches.</p>
<p>So I jumped on board with that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really when we&rsquo;ve become close.</p>
<p>Obviously, I was useful in the Ortega fight,</p>
<p>helped him get out of submissions.</p>
<p>He fought then Korean zombie, Max Holloway.</p>
<p>I basically just held the bucket at that point in the corner,</p>
<p>a couple of striking fights.</p>
<p>And then again, yeah, we had to tackle the Islam problem.</p>
<p>So I did spend five to six weeks down there preparing for that.</p>
<p>How did you tackle the Islam problem?</p>
<p>Was you somebody who barely knows anything about wrestling,</p>
<p>having to help-</p>
<p>Obviously doesn&rsquo;t take much, you know?</p>
<p>Especially wrestling.</p>
<p>Did the beard help or like what?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, what were some of the key ideas</p>
<p>that you worked on with Volkanovski to prepare for it?</p>
<p>I had the help of Frank Hickman.</p>
<p>Hickman was down there too,</p>
<p>one of the Hickman brothers wrestling coach.</p>
<p>So we were sort of like problem solving.</p>
<p>I mean, basically we were confident in Volk&rsquo;s fence wrestling,</p>
<p>his cage work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super good on the cage,</p>
<p>super like under-respected in that position.</p>
<p>And we knew that if you&rsquo;re able to take the scrambles to the cage,</p>
<p>he would be effective against Islam.</p>
<p>Because again, Islam is background in Sambo freestyle wrestling,</p>
<p>but I mean, honestly,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably got the same experience on the cage as Volk&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Obviously some of those wrestling skills</p>
<p>will translate very well to the cage,</p>
<p>but the cage is still somewhat of a gray area and equalizer.</p>
<p>And Volk&rsquo;s again, incredible ability to stand up,</p>
<p>incredible defense on the cage,</p>
<p>which you saw.</p>
<p>We worked on strategies to get up</p>
<p>and a ton of submission defense.</p>
<p>Islam loves Kimuras,</p>
<p>obviously rear naked from the back,</p>
<p>armbars, those are sort of,</p>
<p>and arm triangles, dominant submissions.</p>
<p>But again, the guys he submitted,</p>
<p>not grapplers,</p>
<p>apart from Charles Oliveira.</p>
<p>And again, Charles Oliveira was basically knocked out at that point.</p>
<p>So it was still impressive he submitted him.</p>
<p>But again, I always told people this,</p>
<p>they thought it was crazy.</p>
<p>I was like,</p>
<p>Charles Oliveira versus Islam in a grappling match,</p>
<p>Oliveira is going to win that match.</p>
<p>Like submission grappling.</p>
<p>Submission grappling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in a pure grappling skillset,</p>
<p>I think Oliveira is a more dangerous grappler.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t even come into it thinking Islam</p>
<p>was this unstoppable boogeyman</p>
<p>that people make him out to be.</p>
<p>So we approached it from that,</p>
<p>just focused on the techniques,</p>
<p>ability to get back up,</p>
<p>using turtle to get back up,</p>
<p>using turtle to scoot to the cage to get back up</p>
<p>and hand fighting from there,</p>
<p>keeping it pretty safe.</p>
<p>But what makes Volk&rsquo;s so special,</p>
<p>I think is his gas tank,</p>
<p>gas tank and his willpower.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just unbreakable.</p>
<p>The Dagestani guys, Khabib, Islam,</p>
<p>they are good at submissions,</p>
<p>but they break guys mentally and they fatigue him.</p>
<p>And then they take the submission that&rsquo;s offered.</p>
<p>Oliveira is a guy that can jump on submissions</p>
<p>and have an incredible technical ability</p>
<p>to finish those submissions,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re fresh or you&rsquo;re tired.</p>
<p>And then you combine that with Volkanovski,</p>
<p>who incredible willpower, never gets tired.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never going to break him.</p>
<p>And as you saw,</p>
<p>he only attempted one submission the whole fight.</p>
<p>Is that learned?</p>
<p>Is that trained?</p>
<p>Or are you just born with that mental toughness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s like an anomaly,</p>
<p>like the entire fight camp, not nervous at all,</p>
<p>supremely confident.</p>
<p>The whole fight week, completely confident.</p>
<p>He just has an attitude like,</p>
<p>oh, everyone cast me out, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Islam, he&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>No doubt.</p>
<p>No doubt at all.</p>
<p>Super relaxed up until about five minutes before.</p>
<p>And then he starts to amp himself up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you are not taking this belt from my family.</p>
<p>He gets into that sort of mindset.</p>
<p>He actually says that out loud?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t teach that survival.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even take a fight, you know?</p>
<p>Have you guys ever been pushed to the limit like that</p>
<p>or broken in a grappling match?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do it in practice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll push myself to like,</p>
<p>I think I might pass out or die or something.</p>
<p>As far as how tired you get,</p>
<p>because in a match-</p>
<p>You try not to ever get close to that in a match.</p>
<p>Yeah, you try to,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>where your exhaustion point is.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you have to push to that limit in a match,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Like you see in matches where guys sprint the last minute,</p>
<p>they try to win the match the last minute.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you definitely had some mistakes</p>
<p>leading up to that if you have to go balls to the wall.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But has there been ever times in competition?</p>
<p>Especially like early on,</p>
<p>because you wrestled pretty hard</p>
<p>and wrestling is pretty exhausting.</p>
<p>Like not wrestling,</p>
<p>but wrestling style kind of thing</p>
<p>and going against the best people in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I definitely,</p>
<p>again, I think in practice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to do that hard work</p>
<p>that where competition is much easier.</p>
<p>I think if you redline in practice</p>
<p>and you really push to death&rsquo;s door,</p>
<p>death&rsquo;s door,</p>
<p>then once you&rsquo;re in competition</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re working with,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being fresh in a comp,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s much better.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to that thing</p>
<p>where Dan Gable talks about</p>
<p>always wanting to be to a place</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t get off the mat?</p>
<p>Like you work so hard in the training room,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get off the mat.</p>
<p>I think he says he&rsquo;s failed at that in his career.</p>
<p>He was always able to at least crawl off the mat.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely never like actually died on the mat,</p>
<p>but I felt like I was going to die, you know?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Do you quit all the time?</p>
<p>I get a light cramp.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know what?</p>
<p>You got me, man.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do this again tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dude, if I&rsquo;m asking Craig for a role,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in the bathroom somewhere.</p>
<p>Do you see the value of pushing yourself</p>
<p>to that place where you&rsquo;re knocking on death&rsquo;s door?</p>
<p>Yeah, but within safety,</p>
<p>because obviously the most serious injuries</p>
<p>occur when you&rsquo;re tired,</p>
<p>overtraining and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So I think like taking a page out</p>
<p>of what those MMA fighters do,</p>
<p>especially Volks with his training,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s not necessarily pushing crazy in each round,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s doing extra conditioning,</p>
<p>assault bike stuff, crazy workouts outside.</p>
<p>He does do some crazy training workouts,</p>
<p>but all safe, very safe.</p>
<p>Like when he&rsquo;s redlining like that in the training room,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very controlled, safe setting.</p>
<p>I think to do that in jujitsu</p>
<p>against some of these lunatics out there</p>
<p>that are trying to kill you,</p>
<p>especially when you have a name, can be dangerous.</p>
<p>So your approach to jujitsu is don&rsquo;t warm up</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t try too hard for safety.</p>
<p>No, for safety though.</p>
<p>Yeah, longevity, you know.</p>
<p>And talk shit about Russians.</p>
<p>I got it, I got it, I hear you.</p>
<p>Oh, you mentioned cage work.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve learned over all this time about cage work?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about the dynamics of that?</p>
<p>Are you talking about both like the control</p>
<p>in the dominant position,</p>
<p>but also getting up from the bottom</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re against the cage, all of that?</p>
<p>The added dimension of that cage,</p>
<p>that wall being there changes a lot of stuff, right?</p>
<p>So obviously in some ways,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a much lower impact wrestling style</p>
<p>because he can&rsquo;t be sprawled on.</p>
<p>You can shoot, the cage is going to block their feet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be able to chase down their hips.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a completely different fight.</p>
<p>And again, because of Islam&rsquo;s judo skills,</p>
<p>that upper body controls,</p>
<p>you see he&rsquo;s able to use against the cage,</p>
<p>like the inside trips,</p>
<p>sort of the Uchimada style, Haraigoshi throws.</p>
<p>Obviously those skills do translate,</p>
<p>but yeah, I think the cage is a great equalizer</p>
<p>for a lot of things like athleticism and stuff.</p>
<p>It takes away a huge speed advantage aspect of the fight.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s really good at standing up.</p>
<p>I assume he learned all of that from you</p>
<p>and your instructional just stand up.</p>
<p>I mean, we were so confident.</p>
<p>I was like, you know what?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we put this thing out a month before the fight?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe the illegal download hasn&rsquo;t made its way to Russia yet,</p>
<p>but it was there for him.</p>
<p>Can you explain to me what&rsquo;s in the instructional just stand up?</p>
<p>Like what are the ideas?</p>
<p>I mean, the old school way to stand up,</p>
<p>people talk about the technical get up,</p>
<p>you know, the old Gracie put the hand,</p>
<p>but I mean, that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t worked for 20 years.</p>
<p>You know, if you look at everyone that gets up in MMA,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using turtle to get up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using wrestling to get up.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Which is a counter to what pure jujitsu says.</p>
<p>They say, don&rsquo;t expose the back.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever expose your back.</p>
<p>I think jujitsu is a terrible way to get back to the feet</p>
<p>because if you were to retain guarding a half guard or close guard,</p>
<p>super hard positions to get up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically putting yourself in a leg tuck for wrestling.</p>
<p>So I think you need to borrow from wrestling</p>
<p>to learn how to get up in an MMA fight.</p>
<p>So basically how to safely expose your own back</p>
<p>while not allowing them to get hooks and use that to get back up</p>
<p>or at least not allow them to get two hooks.</p>
<p>And that applies for MMA especially.</p>
<p>For MMA especially.</p>
<p>Because obviously striking is a factor.</p>
<p>But if they are striking,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have locked hands around your body.</p>
<p>Means you are able to move.</p>
<p>You are able to make an attempt to get back up.</p>
<p>They have to choose between control, submission, or strikes.</p>
<p>Post from Reddit.</p>
<p>Why does Craig Jones push so hard for a bottom is bad jujitsu?</p>
<p>What is so bad about playing bottom guard</p>
<p>such as half guard or De La Riva?</p>
<p>Those are the two options.</p>
<p>No one likes a bottom.</p>
<p>Why would I want to get up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the question for all of you.</p>
<p>Is the bottom a bad place to be?</p>
<p>I mean, the bottom is bad</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want that guy on top of you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I look at it.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds like something a cowboy would say,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if that has much meaning.</p>
<p>I think the point of jujitsu is both are dangerous</p>
<p>being on bottom and on top.</p>
<p>I think the longer the matches,</p>
<p>probably favorites the top guy more</p>
<p>just because every movement the bottom guy makes</p>
<p>is probably carrying your weight,</p>
<p>carrying that gravity on top of you.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a bit more efficient.</p>
<p>Passing from the top as opposed to sweeping from bottom.</p>
<p>Bottom&rsquo;s reactive.</p>
<p>Top is active.</p>
<p>The top player decides how to engage,</p>
<p>how to approach the guard.</p>
<p>They can use angles.</p>
<p>They can use footwork.</p>
<p>They can throw people, throw the legs by.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an active position.</p>
<p>Bottom&rsquo;s reactive.</p>
<p>Reactive, you&rsquo;re going to get fatigued.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to gas somebody out</p>
<p>while playing guard,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s very easy to gas somebody out</p>
<p>when attempting to pass it.</p>
<p>Well, you guys are talking about gassing people out,</p>
<p>but is there more dangers from the bottom,</p>
<p>like in terms of submissions</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff or no?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back and forth because I&rsquo;m a top player,</p>
<p>but I understand the value of being on bottom.</p>
<p>Like when I do play guard bottom,</p>
<p>I feel like the submissions come much easier.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m on top,</p>
<p>they come also pretty easy,</p>
<p>but maybe I just take a different route.</p>
<p>Fucking two cowboys talking about jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>Top on the straights, bottom in the shades.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>What was the hardest part of the training</p>
<p>for the training camp for Volkanovski?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just experiencing world-class MMA fighters training</p>
<p>and giving your approach to jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>of not trying too hard no matter what.</p>
<p>I mean, from my perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of pressure for me to go in</p>
<p>and think that I could possibly figure out a way</p>
<p>to help this guy address this guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically never been beaten.</p>
<p>I think he got knocked out once,</p>
<p>but basically not really even been put in bad positions.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of pressure on me,</p>
<p>especially because Volkanovski is such a great guy.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu is different.</p>
<p>You coach a guy, he loses, he has time to tap.</p>
<p>But in MMA, you could get severely hurt.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more weight</p>
<p>in what you need to do as a coach.</p>
<p>You have a greater sense of responsibility</p>
<p>to their health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Obviously, I know Volk&rsquo;s kids.</p>
<p>I know his wife.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting faith in you to not just win the fight,</p>
<p>but keep this man safe.</p>
<p>From my perspective, a hell of a lot more pressure</p>
<p>coaching him as an MMA fighter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the psychological aspect</p>
<p>of doing the best you can for him.</p>
<p>Exactly, yep, yep.</p>
<p>What was the hardest about the actual training?</p>
<p>Was it the technical aspect</p>
<p>of trying to figure out the puzzle of Islam?</p>
<p>Or was it being a good training partner</p>
<p>in figuring out how the grappling would work</p>
<p>basically playing your best impression of Makachev?</p>
<p>Were you trying to actually impersonate him?</p>
<p>Not just visually, but in style.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely, definitely visually.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not as good looking, but go ahead.</p>
<p>A little taller, but no.</p>
<p>In terms of the training, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Islam&rsquo;s known as incredibly strong guys.</p>
<p>So obviously, I&rsquo;m heavier than Islam.</p>
<p>So theoretically, I should be able to replicate</p>
<p>that strength difference.</p>
<p>And then in terms of grappling,</p>
<p>targeting those submissions that Islam does,</p>
<p>like focusing on those in the training room,</p>
<p>focusing on the way he holds half guard,</p>
<p>and really in the grappling sense,</p>
<p>trying to replicate him on the ground.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, I wrestled with him on the wall a ton,</p>
<p>trying to replicate, obviously, to the best of my ability,</p>
<p>a lot of the stuff he does on the wall,</p>
<p>body lock heavy, inside trip, uchi matas,</p>
<p>and just constantly putting the work on Vox.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Constantly chaining attacks against him,</p>
<p>really replicate that.</p>
<p>As he&rsquo;s trying to get up, and escape,</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So the submissions, like both judo and submissions,</p>
<p>just attack and attacking.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only so much you can do, really,</p>
<p>because obviously he&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s been fighting a long time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re trying to polish</p>
<p>what he already is good at.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just completely create</p>
<p>an entirely new game for him in the space of six weeks.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to take what he&rsquo;s already effective at,</p>
<p>add to it.</p>
<p>And luckily, a lot of the stuff he&rsquo;s already very good at</p>
<p>was easy to add to for the fight.</p>
<p>Question from Reddit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious why other MMA fighters</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t employ high-profile grapplers from B-team</p>
<p>and New Wave to improve their grappling?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from this subreddit.</p>
<p>By now, it&rsquo;s clear that they are levels above</p>
<p>almost everyone in MMA,</p>
<p>simply because fighters there don&rsquo;t specialize in grappling.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t seem like fighters,</p>
<p>even champions, get training partners</p>
<p>from the most successful teams.</p>
<p>Why is that the case?</p>
<p>From your experience, why doesn&rsquo;t Kabib call you?</p>
<p>You might now.</p>
<p>Put in a good word for me.</p>
<p>Oh, I will.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>He takes a joke pretty well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, you&rsquo;ll be welcome with open arms.</p>
<p>I think your average Jiu-Jitsu coach,</p>
<p>MMA fighters have bad experience with Jiu-Jitsu guys.</p>
<p>Jiu-Jitsu doesn&rsquo;t have a massive place in MMA.</p>
<p>Obviously, rounds, stand-ups, it&rsquo;s hard to submit people.</p>
<p>Your average Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know anything about holding a guy down,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know anything about how to stand up.</p>
<p>So I think if you overly utilize that Jiu-Jitsu guy</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t had experience in more modern no-gi</p>
<p>or training MMA fighters previously,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a complete waste of time to them.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re smart enough to realize that.</p>
<p>Do you have, and do you guys,</p>
<p>do you have interest in MMA at all?</p>
<p>Just not even like,</p>
<p>well, certainly just competing yourself,</p>
<p>but just understanding the puzzle of MMA.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been a fan of mixed martial arts</p>
<p>for a very long time before I trained Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d much rather coach than fight,</p>
<p>but I mean, I&rsquo;d fight somebody for a good check</p>
<p>and I get to pick the opponent, have a proper camp.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I could think of a good opponent.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Who do you think is the greatest MMA fighter of all time?</p>
<p>Craig, we can start with you.</p>
<p>Just as a fan of the sport, as somebody who&rsquo;s been deep in it.</p>
<p>I mean, from my perspective after that performance,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say Volkanovski</p>
<p>because he was able to decisively outstrike Max Holloway,</p>
<p>one of the greatest strikers in the sport.</p>
<p>And he was able to hang with the wrestling of Islam Akechev.</p>
<p>And in terms of Ortega, he was able to survive Ortega,</p>
<p>who has some of the most dangerous submissions in Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
<p>So I think in my opinion, technically, he&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>So even though he technically lost, he still has a crown.</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>Given the size difference, given he&rsquo;s moving up in weight,</p>
<p>I think all those factors really.</p>
<p>The underdog, everything, the pressure.</p>
<p>Did you think he would be able to hang</p>
<p>in any of the wrestling exchanges with Islam?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I was really surprised.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why my eyes, like, it&rsquo;s kind of funny,</p>
<p>like winning at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I feel like judges influence that.</p>
<p>Although I did think Australian judges</p>
<p>would rob the other way,</p>
<p>but I was assuming they kind of,</p>
<p>somebody paid somebody and not enough, maybe.</p>
<p>But in general, I just thought he won</p>
<p>sort of in the eyes of what martial arts stands for,</p>
<p>like sort of go into the fire and survive and thrive</p>
<p>and finish the last round strong,</p>
<p>which is kind of like spiritually is what a victory is.</p>
<p>So I wish he would kept going, like-</p>
<p>Wumble around.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That kind of thing.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Like who are the fighters you admire?</p>
<p>Like who do you think is the greatest of all time?</p>
<p>I think the fighter I paid most attention to was Jon Jones.</p>
<p>He has a great ability just to mix</p>
<p>the high-level striking, high-level grappling.</p>
<p>Although his jujitsu by itself</p>
<p>probably isn&rsquo;t like super high level,</p>
<p>but his ability to mix everything together,</p>
<p>I would say he&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a fellow heavier guy, heavyweight now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice to see how those guys move at that weight.</p>
<p>And a fellow natural athlete.</p>
<p>See what I did there?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What about you, Nikki?</p>
<p>Yeah, if I had to pick a goat,</p>
<p>I would probably have to say Khabib</p>
<p>just because he was undefeated</p>
<p>and he had a very high finishing rate.</p>
<p>Very few of his fights actually went to a decision.</p>
<p>So he just overall,</p>
<p>he dominated almost every single opponent he went against.</p>
<p>The dominance.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve been joking about it,</p>
<p>but Craig, what do you think</p>
<p>makes the Dagestani fighter so good?</p>
<p>Like from this small region of the world,</p>
<p>so much dominance has come.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously the amount of freestyle wrestling champions</p>
<p>from that region probably puts their wrestling</p>
<p>above and beyond the best in all of MMA.</p>
<p>And obviously a lot of, even in the Olympics,</p>
<p>a lot of champions out of there, right?</p>
<p>I think that skillset combines with them</p>
<p>adding effective pin controls on the ground</p>
<p>and jiu-jitsu submissions.</p>
<p>But again, I think it&rsquo;s that hard training.</p>
<p>Those guys like Khabib would maintain that pressure</p>
<p>throughout the entire fight and break guys down.</p>
<p>Their ability to fatigue guys to a breaking point,</p>
<p>I think is something they do best.</p>
<p>I wonder what that is.</p>
<p>What is that technique?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What is it about their upbringing?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just that part of the world.</p>
<p>What were the Satya brothers</p>
<p>on the freestyle wrestling side</p>
<p>to all the mixed martial arts people?</p>
<p>It must be part of the culture also.</p>
<p>They must be doing something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve never,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen a convincing explanation of why yet,</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s specific about their training,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s specific about their culture that creates that.</p>
<p>Okay, what do you think about the flip side?</p>
<p>Do you admire somebody like Conor McGregor</p>
<p>who knows how to create a spectacle?</p>
<p>You, Craig, who likes spectacles?</p>
<p>Spectacles, yeah.</p>
<p>I really admired early Conor McGregor</p>
<p>because I found him absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>I felt like that was peak banter.</p>
<p>I feel like he just took the American world by storm.</p>
<p>Aussies, British, Irish, Kiwis,</p>
<p>I believe we have a way better level of banter</p>
<p>and attacking each other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost too easy to pick on Americans</p>
<p>that take themselves very seriously.</p>
<p>I mean, arguably even other parts of the world too,</p>
<p>the far East of Europe, you know?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the tricky thing with Conor.</p>
<p>I feel like you could have gotten in the same kind of trouble</p>
<p>because the Russians really took everything very seriously.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t joking around.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a bit of,</p>
<p>I mean, some things he definitely takes too far,</p>
<p>but I felt like early on he had the right balance</p>
<p>where he wouldn&rsquo;t really cross the line,</p>
<p>but he would do enough.</p>
<p>He just took it to another level,</p>
<p>obviously later in his career.</p>
<p>But I think early on, a bit of innocent banter.</p>
<p>He gets a lot of eyes in the sport though.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably by far the most popular</p>
<p>combat athlete of all time because of that.</p>
<p>I feel like you have to cross the line.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think enough people appreciate</p>
<p>the values he&rsquo;s brought by crossing the line.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making a sacrifice crossing the line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to affect him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>I see, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think he can always walk back</p>
<p>because I think unlike people might disagree with this,</p>
<p>I, well, yeah, I thought he always radiated a respect</p>
<p>for the opponent afterwards and underneath it.</p>
<p>It felt like the same way you do.</p>
<p>When I hear you shit talking,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a person who really means it.</p>
<p>I see a person who&rsquo;s having fun with it.</p>
<p>I always saw Conor McGregor the same way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But people took it extremely seriously.</p>
<p>But I saw the respect, like the common respect</p>
<p>the martial artists have for each other</p>
<p>that felt like it was always there.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like that individual,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to perceive what they say more negatively</p>
<p>than if you obviously were.</p>
<p>So I feel like if you like someone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to never think they really crossed the line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying I like you and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m perceiving</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bullshit in a positive light.</p>
<p>Are there people that hate you?</p>
<p>I mean, some of the family members at this table.</p>
<p>As far as students.</p>
<p>People that really get to know you all hate you.</p>
<p>The fans love me.</p>
<p>The friends hate me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good place to be.</p>
<p>Keep your enemies close.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What do you think is the most important muscle for jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>Is it biceps?</p>
<p>I think a strong back.</p>
<p>I think back one, core second, and then biceps.</p>
<p>Okay, biceps.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Do you legitimately think weightlifting helps jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the discussion of the steroids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the muscle mass and strength and power and explosiveness, all that.</p>
<p>I think sometimes when we&rsquo;re at that upper echelon of competition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like little minute battles that you have to win.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re relatively close in technique,</p>
<p>then a lot of times a stronger opponent pulls it out.</p>
<p>But it could be also just a limitation, right?</p>
<p>You hold position too long.</p>
<p>What about for hobbyists?</p>
<p>Do you recommend weightlifting?</p>
<p>Like when you see people in the gym?</p>
<p>I always recommend weightlifting.</p>
<p>I almost see muscle as the body&rsquo;s armor, right?</p>
<p>The more armor you have, the more damage you can kind of take.</p>
<p>And maybe recovery is a little bit better.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always seen weightlifting as a means to stick to my routine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point in lifting if you&rsquo;re not eating right</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not sleeping right.</p>
<p>So if you kind of put it all together, then it&rsquo;s beneficial.</p>
<p>What about you guys?</p>
<p>Do you go to the gym?</p>
<p>I go to the gym, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you go to the hotel gym to use an elliptical</p>
<p>and that butt machine or?</p>
<p>Yeah, I focus on the glutes heavily.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What about the injury prevention and so on?</p>
<p>How do you train to minimize the risk of injury?</p>
<p>You guys have all been pretty beat up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotten a major injury with the ACL.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how do you train to minimize injury?</p>
<p>Probably not the right guy to ask, hey.</p>
<p>Actually, can you talk through your injury?</p>
<p>Like what happened?</p>
<p>Yeah, so about one week prior to this last ADCC,</p>
<p>I was wrestling with this guy named Kenta, who was also competing.</p>
<p>And I went to go lift him from like a rear body lock</p>
<p>and he hooked the outside of my leg and we just felt something pop.</p>
<p>You know, he felt a shift with his leg.</p>
<p>And when it first happened, it hurt for like the first 30 seconds.</p>
<p>And I honestly debated.</p>
<p>I was like, maybe it was just, you know, some freak thing.</p>
<p>I was like, I literally thought about continuing the session.</p>
<p>Then the next day I woke up and it was like super sore.</p>
<p>I was limping around, couldn&rsquo;t do a full squat.</p>
<p>So it pretty much killed all of my training for the entire week leading up to the event.</p>
<p>So I couldn&rsquo;t train or anything.</p>
<p>Messed up the cut.</p>
<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s added nerves with that too.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re not in the gym every day leading up to the competition.</p>
<p>I went out there.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really able to pull guard because I couldn&rsquo;t get, you know,</p>
<p>full heel to butt connection, which is inevitable with playing guard.</p>
<p>And I was very hesitant to shoot as well.</p>
<p>So I came out with the idea of just trying to use hand fighting to tire my first opponent out</p>
<p>and then mainly look to get to underhooks or overhooks and do mostly upper body wrestling.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the match, I, you know, successfully got to an underhook.</p>
<p>I got to a rear body lock.</p>
<p>He tried to roll and I ended up in top position and side control.</p>
<p>But it was during the no points period.</p>
<p>And then as the match went on, I gassed out.</p>
<p>And eventually he ended up taking me down and then scoring with two hooks on the back.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the injury?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I got an MRI actually after the event.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You waited.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>You waited until after the event?</p>
<p>Yeah, I waited until after.</p>
<p>Cause like knowledge or ignorance is bliss?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I was like, I honestly, I don&rsquo;t even want to know what&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>I was like, I just go out there, compete.</p>
<p>I knew it was like the biggest event to date.</p>
<p>And I really wanted to do it.</p>
<p>Think about not doing it?</p>
<p>It definitely was a thought in my head.</p>
<p>Especially that the day after, you know, it&rsquo;s always the worst day.</p>
<p>Whenever you have like a serious injury is the day after.</p>
<p>And I was like, man, I really can&rsquo;t do a full squat.</p>
<p>And I was like, I don&rsquo;t even know how I&rsquo;m going to be able to do this.</p>
<p>It got a bit better over as the week went on.</p>
<p>But I was like, man, I have to go out there and compete.</p>
<p>I was like, it&rsquo;ll always be in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>Like, what if, if I ended up pulling out?</p>
<p>What did you think about this whole?</p>
<p>I thought it was just being a pussy.</p>
<p>Yeah, slap him around.</p>
<p>Just yell at him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we pressured you.</p>
<p>We just say you make your own decision, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just like, is that a tricky thing to do?</p>
<p>Like with a heavily, like a serious injury like this?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That was the thing we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Honestly, initially I thought it was, I tore my lateral meniscus.</p>
<p>But that ended up not being the case.</p>
<p>It ended up being a full ACL tear.</p>
<p>I was actually super surprised when I got the MRI results.</p>
<p>So yeah, we didn&rsquo;t know how bad it actually was.</p>
<p>What do you think about that situation?</p>
<p>I think Nikki&rsquo;s a tough kid.</p>
<p>And I mean, when you&rsquo;re so close to that competition, you know, there&rsquo;s not many,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get many opportunities like that to compete in front of, you know, 15,000 people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, props to you for pushing through it and getting it.</p>
<p>And man, he had a close match with one of the best grapplers in his weight class.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, a few adjustments here and there.</p>
<p>And especially, you know, if he was able to train previously,</p>
<p>leading up to that match, I think that he pulls it out.</p>
<p>So some of the things you mentioned is nerves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s extra nerves just because you&rsquo;re underprepared.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you know, feeling underprepared.</p>
<p>You want to go into a competition with, you know, the confidence.</p>
<p>I did everything that I could leading up to this event.</p>
<p>I trained as much as I could.</p>
<p>And then when an injury prevents that, you start to doubt yourself more.</p>
<p>How do you guys think about injury?</p>
<p>How do you train, you know, training with the best in the world,</p>
<p>training to be the best in the world, and avoiding injury?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve gotten, you tore your bicep.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I tore a bicep.</p>
<p>Dude, honestly, I was bodybuilding, you know, for like seven years.</p>
<p>And no lie, I did, I trained biceps like most days,</p>
<p>like almost every day in those seven years.</p>
<p>Pretty much I injured myself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so Jersey, man.</p>
<p>Anything else or just the biceps?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I injured the bicep.</p>
<p>Pretty much the day before a wrestling practice, I had like a killer arm day.</p>
<p>And by arm day, I just mean training biceps, very rigorously getting a sick pump.</p>
<p>And I go to wrestling practice the next day, you know, pretty late.</p>
<p>I should have been there.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a proper warm up in.</p>
<p>And the first thing I do is I shake hands and I go to shoot a single leg.</p>
<p>And boom, I just blew my arm out.</p>
<p>The first movement I did.</p>
<p>So just not being warmed up properly, in addition to, you know,</p>
<p>having a very vigorous arm day a few hours prior.</p>
<p>You hear that about warm up?</p>
<p>So like, what are some lessons about avoiding injury and training?</p>
<p>I would say number one is warming up properly.</p>
<p>Making sure your body&rsquo;s hot before you do hot stuff.</p>
<p>Okay, and what does warm up look like for you?</p>
<p>Is it jujitsu or non-jujitsu stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, just for a warm up in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do something like a, if I&rsquo;m talking competition,</p>
<p>something like a jog walk back and forth a few times,</p>
<p>then a sprint jog a few times to get that heart rate, you know, up and down.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll grab a partner.</p>
<p>I actually just filmed a DVD, or instructional,</p>
<p>specifically on the pre-match ritual.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I&rsquo;ll, you know, grab a partner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll drill some movements.</p>
<p>Typically, I&rsquo;ll drill some bad things.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll start from bottom, bottom out, bottom side control,</p>
<p>work out from there.</p>
<p>And in pretty much like 20 minutes in, I&rsquo;m hot,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m ready to go for, you know, rounds.</p>
<p>Well, what about you, Greg?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the way to avoid injury?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the worst injury you&rsquo;ve had?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the worst injury?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty good.</p>
<p>Pretty healthy, yeah.</p>
<p>Whenever you quit practice, I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s a mental issue.</p>
<p>Has your heart ever been broken?</p>
<p>Many times, many times.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a thing I notice.</p>
<p>People that spend the most time warming up,</p>
<p>often the most injured.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strong correlation.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t argue with science.</p>
<p>I remember training with Oliver Tyser.</p>
<p>Oliver Tyser would have a 60-minute warmup.</p>
<p>Surprise, surprise, always injured.</p>
<p>Very common.</p>
<p>I find that very common in the training room.</p>
<p>No, I think people, it&rsquo;s how they train.</p>
<p>Like if you, like me, first sign of discomfort, backpedal.</p>
<p>You know, push through that stuff.</p>
<p>Go too hard.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re too tired.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Get too emotional in the role.</p>
<p>I feel like those are the times that I&rsquo;ve been hurt.</p>
<p>Where I just like, oh, I can&rsquo;t let this guy get me.</p>
<p>When I have that attitude and try.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s how you train and sort of, obviously.</p>
<p>What does discomfort mean?</p>
<p>Like positionally too?</p>
<p>Like, because you&rsquo;re training against some killers.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re training with him and going probably pretty hard.</p>
<p>Craig gets a little tired.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, I&rsquo;m good for today.</p>
<p>We good.</p>
<p>Once a month with Nicky, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, you know?</p>
<p>And then you quit like 30 seconds in.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, you got to be safe.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>What have you learned from the ACL?</p>
<p>Do rehab.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, rehab definitely would help.</p>
<p>Oh, so you haven&rsquo;t been like.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get surgery.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do essentially any rehab.</p>
<p>I just have no ACL in my left leg.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s it like having no.</p>
<p>The surgeon goes, you&rsquo;ve got two options.</p>
<p>Surgery, rehab only.</p>
<p>Nicky goes, I&rsquo;ll do nothing.</p>
<p>Definitely should pick up on the rehab.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s rehab for that look like?</p>
<p>Like twice a day of doing some weird.</p>
<p>Like bands or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good he&rsquo;s learned from me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s learned some valuable lessons from about taking care of his body.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like just training with no ACL?</p>
<p>So at the beginning, it was definitely a little iffy.</p>
<p>You know, I would have an occasional buckle.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d just be wrestling with somebody and go to step back and it buckled backwards a bit.</p>
<p>But honestly, now, like I haven&rsquo;t had a single buckle instance in a while.</p>
<p>It feels 100% normal when I train.</p>
<p>It feels better than my other knee, to be honest.</p>
<p>Like I had my meniscus taken out in my right leg.</p>
<p>And that one gets sore more often than the no ACL leg.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So putting that aside, is there wisdom you&rsquo;ve learned from that experience?</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely should be doing rehab and prehab.</p>
<p>You know, I think that, you know, especially if you&rsquo;re a hobbyist or a professional athlete,</p>
<p>you should be lifting, you know, whether you&rsquo;re rehabbing an injury or just for injury prevention.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually closer to Corey because I&rsquo;ve trained my whole life, like pretty hard.</p>
<p>Obviously just a hobbyist, but like twice a day, did judo, wrestling, all that.</p>
<p>Never broke anything.</p>
<p>Never injured.</p>
<p>Kind of like similar philosophy.</p>
<p>Except like last year, I guess a year and a half ago, I got a tiny like groin pull injury</p>
<p>and it still hasn&rsquo;t healed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been using your approach of not giving a shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like, all right, surely this is going to heal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>But it hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Of course, if I was like an actual athlete, I would like probably still train through it</p>
<p>and just fuck it, figure it out.</p>
<p>But when you have other stuff going on, you just kind of wait it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But no, I think probably rehab, especially as you get older,</p>
<p>you have to do that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important for people to determine whether what they&rsquo;re going through is an injury</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just hurt a little bit.</p>
<p>Because injury, for sure, take time, rehab it and get better.</p>
<p>But a lot of people like they&rsquo;ll stub a toe or something, like you&rsquo;re out for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the problem with the injury I have.</p>
<p>It feels like a stubbed toe.</p>
<p>So I was like, I&rsquo;ll just wait a couple of days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>And then a couple of days later, it&rsquo;s not fine.</p>
<p>And you wait.</p>
<p>And then I never got an MRI, never got any of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to know sometimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know.</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of people will just not check it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s several failure cases.</p>
<p>There is a failure case of where everything is a stubbed toe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, fuck it.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re bleeding everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful.</p>
<p>A lot of people can fall into that too.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m in that category.</p>
<p>Go to the doctor.</p>
<p>Why do you go to the doctor?</p>
<p>Your best approach is typically wait until something else gets hurt</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;ll forget about the grain.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was hoping.</p>
<p>I was hoping to get hurt.</p>
<p>Waiting for the broken heart, maybe.</p>
<p>Okay, that was very helpful.</p>
<p>Oh, you mentioned you&rsquo;re doing a whole thing on the pre-match ritual.</p>
<p>Can you kind of preview what&rsquo;s involved in your pre-match ritual?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty big in the wrestling culture and the fighting culture.</p>
<p>Kind of what to do before your competition.</p>
<p>But I think a few people are just kind of missing out exactly what to do.</p>
<p>So I break it down for them.</p>
<p>I break it down to people like four weeks in advance.</p>
<p>How you should prep your training and your nutrition and your sleep for competition.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I break it down even to a smaller scale.</p>
<p>How early you should get to the event.</p>
<p>When you should be visualizing your competition.</p>
<p>What to do 30 minutes before, 20 minutes, 10 minutes, five minutes.</p>
<p>And the kind of mentality you should have throughout those times</p>
<p>before you actually step onto the mat.</p>
<p>When are you visualizing?</p>
<p>How much are you visualizing?</p>
<p>When you say competition, are you talking about the tournament</p>
<p>or the actual people you might be competing against?</p>
<p>A little bit of both.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spend time just visualizing the crowd.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going to be an arena with 15,000 people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spend time in practice and whatnot,</p>
<p>like putting myself inside that arena and visualizing stepping on the mat</p>
<p>and hearing the crowd scream and whatnot.</p>
<p>That way, when competition time comes, it&rsquo;s kind of the same deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m accustomed to it.</p>
<p>In addition, when I get to the arena, I&rsquo;ll step on the mat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll kind of look at everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll expose my senses to what it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll kind of shut everything off.</p>
<p>Like some people scroll through their phone</p>
<p>and can treat it like normal, have this normal conversations.</p>
<p>For me, I like to limit my sensory intake before I go out and compete.</p>
<p>I just feel like sometimes we only have so many decisions</p>
<p>you can make in a day.</p>
<p>And I want all of my best decisions to be made when it matters,</p>
<p>when it counts.</p>
<p>Oh, what about you?</p>
<p>Do you limit your sensory input?</p>
<p>On game day?</p>
<p>Honestly, no routine, nothing, eh?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s a double silver.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both double silver.</p>
<p>You should buy his instructional.</p>
<p>It might help you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get another silver.</p>
<p>No, honestly, nothing.</p>
<p>Hey, I just try to relax, treat it like it&rsquo;s before training.</p>
<p>Visualizations or no?</p>
<p>No, no visualization.</p>
<p>So the opposite of visualization.</p>
<p>You just avoid it before thinking about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t even think about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, yeah, we&rsquo;ll have a good time.</p>
<p>Try to appreciate it, that I can do it.</p>
<p>By the way, when you visualize, are you visualizing tough positions</p>
<p>or you visualize winning mostly?</p>
<p>I definitely visualize winning.</p>
<p>I visualize how I&rsquo;m going to get to my most dominant positions</p>
<p>because in comp, I want to do what I&rsquo;m best at.</p>
<p>And I also see my opponent in his best positions</p>
<p>and how I&rsquo;m going to escape those if necessary.</p>
<p>But most of the time, I&rsquo;m just visualizing exactly</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m going to do in that match.</p>
<p>And I go out there and do it.</p>
<p>So when your teammate, Craig, is another world-class athlete,</p>
<p>has a fundamentally different philosophy than you,</p>
<p>do you visualize being frustrated at him?</p>
<p>No, not frustrated.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll definitely come into practice with solutions</p>
<p>to the problems that Craig gives me.</p>
<p>If Craig&rsquo;s catching me at something or giving me issues,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go home, I&rsquo;ll watch a match that he lost for motivation</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll come back and I&rsquo;ll put it on.</p>
<p>Just DM him a highlight reel of him losing.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Does it affect you that you&rsquo;re a bit of an outlier?</p>
<p>Usually before I compete, right before I go out there,</p>
<p>I go, why am I doing this?</p>
<p>Do I still need to do this?</p>
<p>And I think, hopefully I don&rsquo;t embarrass myself,</p>
<p>affect my instructional sales.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the last thought.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t even put too much thought</p>
<p>into the whole competing thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, you know what?</p>
<p>Train hard.</p>
<p>Hopefully have a good time out there.</p>
<p>What about the motivation aspect?</p>
<p>That voice that says, why am I doing this?</p>
<p>That voice can break a lot of people.</p>
<p>In a weight cut, it can break a lot of people.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this stupid, silly sport?</p>
<p>Like you said, a bunch of dudes just rolling around.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call someone with a nine to five job</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be like, yeah, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>Avoid that.</p>
<p>Sell those DVDs, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t get too deep on competing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so polar opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost uncomfortable to be around you.</p>
<p>Obviously, one of us is a clean athlete.</p>
<p>You should do a DVD on that.</p>
<p>What about you in terms of preparing for competition, Mickey?</p>
<p>The day before, the day of, are there rituals that you follow?</p>
<p>Honestly, the few days leading up to it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different for me every time.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll warm up before I compete.</p>
<p>Sometimes I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll fast.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll eat.</p>
<p>Literally, it&rsquo;s just completely random.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t follow any specific thing.</p>
<p>But in the training room leading up to the competition,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely, like Nicky Rod, visualize</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m walking out onto the competition mats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pick somebody that&rsquo;s a similar body type</p>
<p>to the person that I&rsquo;m competing against.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll start out with some distance between us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come out, smack hands, and act like everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a real competition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even sometimes have corners that will yell out times</p>
<p>just to replicate it as much as possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot</p>
<p>of Olympic gold medalists.</p>
<p>They used to do a podcast with athletes,</p>
<p>and they all sound like Nicky Rod.</p>
<p>The two of you are outliers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll do this.</p>
<p>Sometimes&hellip;</p>
<p>So anyway.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s also Jiu-Jitsu culture, I think.</p>
<p>Maybe the chaos of not taking things too serious</p>
<p>is actually really, really helpful.</p>
<p>Sometimes the pressure of taking everything</p>
<p>way too seriously can break you.</p>
<p>I mean, I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that big a sport, really.</p>
<p>I think if I compete every day in practice,</p>
<p>it just makes competition much easier.</p>
<p>So I just put the pressure on there.</p>
<p>On the competition, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, sorry, on the training,</p>
<p>competing in the training.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Olympic sports aren&rsquo;t that big either financially.</p>
<p>And people take it extremely, extremely seriously.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really get that much money from Judo.</p>
<p>I mean, I just don&rsquo;t take Jiu-Jitsu that seriously</p>
<p>because I was just partying and having a good time until 21.</p>
<p>And then I was like, oh, fuck, do I get a job?</p>
<p>Or do I pursue professional sports?</p>
<p>And I feel like if I made a career in Jiu-Jitsu</p>
<p>with a decision at that point.</p>
<p>And now you just stumbled your way somehow</p>
<p>into being at the top of the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I feel like.</p>
<p>I just walked into it.</p>
<p>I feel like I couldn&rsquo;t just do that in wrestling, boxing.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do that in other sports.</p>
<p>What was the toughest match you ever had</p>
<p>that pushed you mentally, physically, technically?</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have to be the best person you faced,</p>
<p>but was there a moment in your career</p>
<p>that was really defining for you?</p>
<p>I mean, I would say the toughest mentally</p>
<p>was just this last ADCC.</p>
<p>I just had a big injury leading into it</p>
<p>that kind of screwed the whole camp</p>
<p>and weight cutting everything up.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would say the last ADCC.</p>
<p>Are you proud of your performance there?</p>
<p>You stepped on the mat that you pushed through all of it.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m a very competitive person</p>
<p>and I hate losing.</p>
<p>So definitely not, yeah.</p>
<p>You had to collapse long.</p>
<p>He was so physically exhausted afterwards.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>We had to get medical intervention.</p>
<p>He thought he had to collapse long.</p>
<p>I was the most tired that I&rsquo;ve ever been in my life</p>
<p>in that match.</p>
<p>I actually popped a blood vessel in my eye.</p>
<p>I was trying so hard.</p>
<p>He comes out, he walks off the ADCC mat backstage</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m kind of getting warmed up for my match</p>
<p>and Nikki Ryan comes over to me and she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m so tired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m so tired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m so tired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m so tired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m so tired.</p>
<p>And Nikki Ryan comes, he walks over, huffing and puffing.</p>
<p>His mom&rsquo;s right next to me.</p>
<p>He looks at her.</p>
<p>He was like, I think I need help.</p>
<p>I think I got a lung collapse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s the one that called for medical help.</p>
<p>I was just laying on the warmup mat, fucking dying.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re happy you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>Laid it all on the line.</p>
<p>What about you, Craig?</p>
<p>Defining our toughest matches?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re all pretty tough.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really pinpoint one.</p>
<p>I mean, probably the most annoying one was obviously the one</p>
<p>where I had Gordon Arnby, I was like, tap, bro.</p>
<p>And he wouldn&rsquo;t tap.</p>
<p>So I let him out.</p>
<p>Mentally, I was like, I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.</p>
<p>Do you ever have a thing in your brain where it says,</p>
<p>should I shit talk now or not?</p>
<p>And you say, no, I&rsquo;m going to be respectful.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t be serious about some of these things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just silly.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>The whole thing.</p>
<p>What about you, Nick?</p>
<p>Dude, honestly, most of my toughest matches are in the training room, right?</p>
<p>Because I started with these guys.</p>
<p>I started training under them, started training at DDS</p>
<p>when I didn&rsquo;t have any knowledge.</p>
<p>I knew wrestling.</p>
<p>I knew a knee cut in jujitsu.</p>
<p>But I started training with them when I knew almost no jujitsu.</p>
<p>And then I had to really work my way up.</p>
<p>So definitely in the training room, having one of these guys on my back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a stretch of a few weeks or months when COVID first hit.</p>
<p>And it was just four of the best grapplers in the world.</p>
<p>And we just did drilling and live rounds with these four guys.</p>
<p>And it was hard.</p>
<p>It was very hard.</p>
<p>Every round, doing six rounds, seven days a week with the best grapplers in the world.</p>
<p>And you get no break.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re forced to learn on the go.</p>
<p>So I think for me in the training room, that was definitely my toughest matches.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I built those mental calluses.</p>
<p>There was a period where I drew with Nicky Rod probably, what, nine months, 12 months?</p>
<p>And typically speaking, like I said, no warm-ups.</p>
<p>The first round, we usually take it pretty easy.</p>
<p>First round, you start in mount.</p>
<p>The whole room, the rest of the training room, they take mount very lightly.</p>
<p>Me and Nicky Rod would be fighting to the death every day.</p>
<p>I felt like we did an extra round every day.</p>
<p>It was very grueling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very mean when I&rsquo;m in the midst of drilling or live.</p>
<p>We would drill wrestling quite a bit, like stand-up.</p>
<p>And in the drilling, I just wouldn&rsquo;t let Craig take me down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going live.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just drilling.</p>
<p>But I just wouldn&rsquo;t let him put me on the floor.</p>
<p>So things like that.</p>
<p>I knew it would escalate.</p>
<p>So you mentioned mount.</p>
<p>So you do positional training.</p>
<p>Would that be the hardest versus live training, open, starting from guard?</p>
<p>I would say mount and turtle definitely, definitely made me very tough.</p>
<p>Because you spend all this effort getting off of bottom mount.</p>
<p>And then you got to get on top of a guy.</p>
<p>At the time, I&rsquo;m not that good at holding guys down.</p>
<p>So they escape quick.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, fuck, I just tried to hold him down.</p>
<p>Got to go back down.</p>
<p>Same thing with a turtle.</p>
<p>You start bottom turtle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to explode, get away.</p>
<p>And then you switch.</p>
<p>And this guy gets up pretty quick.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, damn, I got to go right back down.</p>
<p>That constant circle, man, it&rsquo;s very tough.</p>
<p>But definitely built some character on the mat.</p>
<p>What do you think is the value of positional training in general in jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>Actually, this one, just interacting with you guys,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not commonly done in just regular jiu-jitsu gyms.</p>
<p>Probably it&rsquo;s not commonly done because most of the experience is just frustrating.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re evenly matched, you&rsquo;re basically frustrated the whole time.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing it right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a psychological battle that happens in the mountain turtle rounds.</p>
<p>Maybe you get close to subbing a guy, or maybe you do sub him.</p>
<p>When you start on turtle and you&rsquo;re on their back, you finish them.</p>
<p>And then you get this high point.</p>
<p>And then immediately you got to go back down to defensive posture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s emotionally up and down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to deal with.</p>
<p>Super important if you&rsquo;re one of the better people in the gym,</p>
<p>because it just puts you in positions</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t find yourself in, in regular training.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a big fish in a small pond,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do positional sparring,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to get exposed in competition.</p>
<p>You might even look silly in those positions.</p>
<p>So you really have to force yourself to do it,</p>
<p>despite the fact that you&rsquo;re giving someone worse than you</p>
<p>a position where they might catch you.</p>
<p>So you have to put the ego aside.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the things when I was training regularly.</p>
<p>Of course, training with you guys, it&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t work on putting myself in bad positions.</p>
<p>When you get better and you regret it.</p>
<p>Because the big negative thing it has,</p>
<p>consequence it has on competition</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t take as many risks.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re kind of afraid for your back</p>
<p>to get taken, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That was me before I went to DDS.</p>
<p>I remember I showed up there in that old position.</p>
<p>I was like, fuck this.</p>
<p>You better earn this position.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really have escapes.</p>
<p>That was a learning curve for me, for sure.</p>
<p>Do you see the value in positional training?</p>
<p>Or is it just the source of tremendous frustration?</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely think it plays a big part</p>
<p>in your confidence when you step out</p>
<p>onto the competition mats.</p>
<p>Being confident that even if you get put</p>
<p>in the worst possible situations,</p>
<p>you know what to do and know how to work out of them.</p>
<p>I had a long argument with Haja Gracie when he visited.</p>
<p>And he thinks mount is the most dominant position.</p>
<p>Even Nogi versus Beck.</p>
<p>Is there a case to be made for that or no?</p>
<p>I think all of your opponent&rsquo;s utensils,</p>
<p>their tools are in front of them.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on mount, there&rsquo;s a few ways</p>
<p>to get out of mount.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re on somebody&rsquo;s back,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d personally much rather be on somebody&rsquo;s back then.</p>
<p>Flattened out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have someone&rsquo;s back and then flattened out.</p>
<p>Boots in, flattened out.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Boots in, flattened out.</p>
<p>So not even body triangle, but just flattened.</p>
<p>Just completely flat.</p>
<p>Almost like the position in MMA</p>
<p>where you see guys get finished because they can&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>I think that position is probably</p>
<p>the hardest position to escape.</p>
<p>Can you see what Haja&rsquo;s talking about with mount</p>
<p>or is he just that good at mount that he says that?</p>
<p>He might mean the gi, cross collar, you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Or did he mean-</p>
<p>He says controlling wise, he just believes</p>
<p>that you can complete, that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>he actually thinks there&rsquo;s more ways to get out</p>
<p>from the back than there is from the mount.</p>
<p>Prior to-</p>
<p>Getting up, including like physically.</p>
<p>Prior to the kipping escape, I would probably agree with him.</p>
<p>But that kipping escape is so difficult to manage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the funny looking escape where your legs are wiggling.</p>
<p>People have a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like super hard to learn how to do,</p>
<p>but then once you learn how to do it,</p>
<p>the effectiveness is just huge.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a weird one.</p>
<p>When did that come to be a thing?</p>
<p>Is that pretty recent?</p>
<p>I mean, I saw DDS guys using it first, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the first guy to discover something like that?</p>
<p>This seems like a ridiculous thing to discover.</p>
<p>Yeah, like what if I just wiggle?</p>
<p>I thought it was a joke at first.</p>
<p>I was like, you guys really doing this?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I remember somebody showing me a technique where</p>
<p>if you just walk your hand on a mat or something like that.</p>
<p>Like an arm triangle or something?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>On the arm high?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a funny discovery,</p>
<p>as opposed to trying to shove it in, just walk it.</p>
<p>I like doing that to people, but with things that aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell them this is a technique</p>
<p>and watch them try to work out if I&rsquo;m being serious or not.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what you do when you achieve guru status.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just listen to you like you&rsquo;re Steven Seagal.</p>
<p>See what they&rsquo;ll believe.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, how do you balance,</p>
<p>you have to travel all across the world.</p>
<p>How do you balance that with running a school</p>
<p>or being a world-class Jiu-Jitsu athlete?</p>
<p>I mean, the secrets of travel for me are two drugs, Xanax and modafinil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we time adjust and we hit the ground running.</p>
<p>What does modafinil do?</p>
<p>Xanax puts you to sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I have narcolepsy, so it&rsquo;s a narcolepsy medication.</p>
<p>How does that work with the steroids?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>I mean, they work well together, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, nice.</p>
<p>Focused and physical recovery.</p>
<p>But in terms of traveling and training stuff, it is.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re lucky because we got so many high-level guys,</p>
<p>so we can travel and they&rsquo;re still in good hands.</p>
<p>I mean, it would be a problem if me, Nicky Rod and Nicky Ryan left</p>
<p>and the gym had Ethan, that would be a problem.</p>
<p>But we got to make sure it&rsquo;s not just him there.</p>
<p>Although everyone says they&rsquo;re happy when you&rsquo;re gone,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the moment I heard.</p>
<p>Happy when I&rsquo;m gone, but they do miss me, for sure, until I get back.</p>
<p>All right, what about you?</p>
<p>Just like balancing it.</p>
<p>Do you try to stay completely focused on competing?</p>
<p>Like for some of the big matches you have coming up,</p>
<p>are you able to kind of diversify?</p>
<p>Well, I like to diversify my training to where, you know,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t have a competition scheduled,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more focused on skill development and, you know,</p>
<p>getting better and broadening my tool shed.</p>
<p>But, you know, if I&rsquo;m like six weeks before comp,</p>
<p>I really start amping up the intensity that I bring into the mats</p>
<p>against bringing some of that visualization towards practice.</p>
<p>And maybe I train less volume pre-competition,</p>
<p>but higher output per session.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s a perfect week of training look like?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not in competition mode,</p>
<p>I would say Monday, Wednesday, Friday twice,</p>
<p>every other day just once.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m pre-comp, just Monday to Sunday once a day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s on the mat, you&rsquo;re doing the full,</p>
<p>like positional training, live training.</p>
<p>Bicep curls.</p>
<p>Bicep, oh yeah, I do a lot of bicep curls.</p>
<p>Yeah, I lift a few times a week now.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Cardio or no?</p>
<p>Cardio&rsquo;s all mat stuff.</p>
<p>Cardio&rsquo;s all mat stuff.</p>
<p>I do do some CrossFit workouts, like CrossFit&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do like some EMOMs or some AMRAPs or CrossFit terms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for Instagram?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, CrossFit is a good way to kind of like</p>
<p>push that threshold.</p>
<p>Sometimes on the mat, because I&rsquo;m so good,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t always get that like full red line.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll hop in across the gym and I&rsquo;ll do some workouts</p>
<p>that bring me closer to death.</p>
<p>What about you, Craig?</p>
<p>What is a perfect week in training look like?</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re back home training?</p>
<p>I try to be at the gym twice a day, every day when I&rsquo;m back,</p>
<p>just because I travel a bit more than these guys.</p>
<p>So I try to be there 8 and 12 every day,</p>
<p>hang out in between.</p>
<p>Usually, definitely, usually train both of those sessions,</p>
<p>depending on how my body feels.</p>
<p>So doing positional, doing every technique,</p>
<p>positional, live?</p>
<p>I should probably do more positional,</p>
<p>but because I&rsquo;m just trying to work on wrestling and stuff,</p>
<p>and especially leading up to the Volkanovski&rsquo;s last fly,</p>
<p>I was trying to wrestle more and focus on those areas</p>
<p>even before I traveled over there,</p>
<p>just some experimentation with some stuff.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>How do you experiment with stuff?</p>
<p>Like how do you, so there&rsquo;s like regular positional stuff,</p>
<p>but when you have ideas, like where,</p>
<p>do you do it in during the training sessions</p>
<p>or do it outside of that?</p>
<p>Do you get together with somebody?</p>
<p>Usually, every session, I show up with something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of, usually something from top,</p>
<p>maybe something from bottom.</p>
<p>And then I just try to maybe pick the right people.</p>
<p>Some people, obviously, I&rsquo;m just fighting to the death with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good time to experiment.</p>
<p>And then others, obviously, you can play around with ideas on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a perfect week look like?</p>
<p>Maybe, well, you said you&rsquo;re 100% now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, honestly, I have pretty much the same schedule</p>
<p>as Nicky Rod.</p>
<p>So Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I do twice a day,</p>
<p>every other day, once a day.</p>
<p>And then normally, noon practice is like our biggest class.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where all the pros go in.</p>
<p>So I tend to do more open rounds there.</p>
<p>And then we have a 7 p.m. class as well,</p>
<p>which is more hobbyist.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll do my positional rounds</p>
<p>and force myself to be put in bad positions.</p>
<p>So you have, what, you do 8 a.m., 12,</p>
<p>like in terms of what B team has.</p>
<p>8 a.m., 12, and 7 p.m.</p>
<p>And the hobbyists are more 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you believe in overtraining?</p>
<p>Do you think you can overtrain?</p>
<p>I used to not believe in it, but then I got hurt.</p>
<p>I was like, all right.</p>
<p>Oh, you attribute that to overtraining?</p>
<p>I think, dude, I&rsquo;m telling you, I trained.</p>
<p>I lifted like a bodybuilder for like seven years.</p>
<p>And by lifting, I mean, I was lifting seven days a week.</p>
<p>And I trained arms most days.</p>
<p>Like almost every day I would do like four or five sets</p>
<p>and get a pretty good bicep pump in addition to my lift.</p>
<p>I think that had to contribute somewhat towards my training.</p>
<p>What about, okay, yeah, fair enough.</p>
<p>Well, what about on the actual mat overtraining,</p>
<p>like spending too much time on the mat?</p>
<p>Psychological, physical overtraining.</p>
<p>I think you can definitely overtrain,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more of a, like, as your body&rsquo;s healthy,</p>
<p>you have to make sure your mind is sharp.</p>
<p>Like sometimes maybe taking a day away</p>
<p>or even diverting your attention</p>
<p>in a different aspect of training</p>
<p>can help you be a little bit sharper overall.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be like, it can get a little like stagnant</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing the same stuff over and over.</p>
<p>But I think if you just keep like overtraining,</p>
<p>then your overall baseline just gets higher</p>
<p>and you become, you know, accustomed to that.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t seem like a guy that over, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of him, never been close to it.</p>
<p>No, I think controlling how hard you train</p>
<p>is definitely protects you from injury.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re redlining yourself</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re fighting to the death in the gym,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 100% when you&rsquo;re going to get injured,</p>
<p>going to get sick.</p>
<p>So I try to make sure I&rsquo;ve had enough sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had obviously enough food post-training.</p>
<p>And that sort of helps me to train a bit harder,</p>
<p>but still try to avoid redlining myself too much.</p>
<p>I think established also,</p>
<p>like what days are going to be your peak days?</p>
<p>Because throughout the week,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re training seven days a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have ups and downs.</p>
<p>Like for me personally, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,</p>
<p>usually my best days.</p>
<p>And besides that, I also have other great days.</p>
<p>All my days are great.</p>
<p>But Monday, Wednesday, Friday are also great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like unable to admit</p>
<p>that some days are rougher than others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on, bro.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to people</p>
<p>who are not always on, hobbyists?</p>
<p>How to get better?</p>
<p>Like people that are already there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, purple bells, brown bells, black bells.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just like doing like a couple of times a week</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Like how to get better.</p>
<p>I think being consistent,</p>
<p>like find a schedule that you can consistently train.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s like, you know, three, four times a week</p>
<p>or even a little bit less.</p>
<p>Just be consistent over the years.</p>
<p>I think too often people are like,</p>
<p>oh, I want to get really good really fast.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, definitely takes a long time</p>
<p>to get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>What about what you&rsquo;re doing during,</p>
<p>like while being consistent,</p>
<p>what kind of stuff you&rsquo;re working on?</p>
<p>So honestly, I think one big thing for me,</p>
<p>which is something I actually started doing</p>
<p>once B team was formed,</p>
<p>was filming all of your rounds</p>
<p>and then watching it every day.</p>
<p>Because then you can see</p>
<p>what specific problems you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>and then you can base your positional rounds</p>
<p>around those problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of depressing though.</p>
<p>Like sometimes I have to,</p>
<p>you know, I edited this podcast for a long time.</p>
<p>I still do in part.</p>
<p>And I hate the sound of my voice</p>
<p>and like what I look like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough, but it does make you better.</p>
<p>And I also hate the sound of Craig&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>It looks like this would be doubly difficult,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad the rest of you are here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, do you watch</p>
<p>competition footage of yourself?</p>
<p>Like to analyze, like, yeah, my confidence.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re doing curls.</p>
<p>Is there advice you,</p>
<p>Craig, you would give for hobbyists to get better?</p>
<p>I mean, just not every round</p>
<p>has to be a fight to the death, you know?</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re going to get injured,</p>
<p>burnt out that way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to learn as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>I would say just as a black belt</p>
<p>who took Jiu-Jitsu very seriously</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>Basically, when you become a hobbyist,</p>
<p>your skill is basically slipping.</p>
<p>Your age and your skill.</p>
<p>And so not taking stuff seriously</p>
<p>is actually its own psychological skill</p>
<p>of like, that it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s tough in a way that is different</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like a blue belt or something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re, if you work hard</p>
<p>and you train correctly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get much better.</p>
<p>Here, you&rsquo;re kind of.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking downhill.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re freaking downhill.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, yeah,</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m going to enjoy the art of it.</p>
<p>Reframe the victory, you know?</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s a young upcoming guy</p>
<p>and he comes to me, you&rsquo;re like, well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a moral victory, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, but then that has to happen.</p>
<p>You have to be able to not do that</p>
<p>to avoid the injury sometimes.</p>
<p>Like if you want.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>Plus with me,</p>
<p>just because some people recognize me,</p>
<p>they, you have that probably.</p>
<p>You guys definitely obviously have that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve solved that problem.</p>
<p>How did you solve that problem?</p>
<p>Travel around, you do a seminar,</p>
<p>anything like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s believable that you could get submitted once.</p>
<p>But if they catch you, give them a few.</p>
<p>If people tell their friends,</p>
<p>they submitted me to seminar,</p>
<p>one time, believable.</p>
<p>They got me four or five times.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve robbed them of that.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s pretty funny.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, they have this energy.</p>
<p>Like they think, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re coming in hot.</p>
<p>And I usually like to just basically</p>
<p>get submitted quickly twice.</p>
<p>And just, it changes everything.</p>
<p>It makes it more fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed.</p>
<p>Let them submit you twice?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just like very quickly.</p>
<p>Like what are the options?</p>
<p>Make it last longer.</p>
<p>Hold off.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s very hard to like,</p>
<p>yeah, if you&rsquo;re a very serious competitor</p>
<p>and so on, you take it seriously, then yes.</p>
<p>But like, then people go,</p>
<p>people, what they try to do,</p>
<p>this probably is what happens to you guys.</p>
<p>They try to impress you by going super hard.</p>
<p>I have people every day come to my gym,</p>
<p>try to take me out.</p>
<p>I just stay sharp.</p>
<p>Come to practice.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it on.</p>
<p>Do you feel that energy?</p>
<p>I feel like I need to talk to Craig here first.</p>
<p>Like at a seminar,</p>
<p>like somebody is coming in like really hard,</p>
<p>like a brown belt will come in.</p>
<p>Like, and they really want to impress you</p>
<p>with like their technical side of their big fan.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been watching your DVDs.</p>
<p>Like, what do you do with a guy like that?</p>
<p>I make a complete joke out of the row.</p>
<p>You know, give them the pause,</p>
<p>mess with them, do stupid shit.</p>
<p>Like rub them of the realness of it.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to roll hard with strangers.</p>
<p>I feel like you should roll with a circle of people you trust.</p>
<p>Injuries happen rolling hard with strangers</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the same way you get injured in competition</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have that relationship with them.</p>
<p>And I should also mention,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not a good way to impress somebody&rsquo;s big,</p>
<p>just going ape shit, going 100%.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s not at all.</p>
<p>I think the beauty of jiu-jitsu is like the camaraderie of it.</p>
<p>Like as you get to know each other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like technical, like different ideas you have and all that.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Do you think Gi Jiu-Jitsu is dying in popularity, Craig?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s long dead.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just, I mean, it just shows like,</p>
<p>I mean, I have heard some numbers on the viewership</p>
<p>for the Gi Worlds finals</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even compare to the undercard of like,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s number one events.</p>
<p>So I think like,</p>
<p>when I was coming up and competing in the Gi all the time,</p>
<p>you looked at those guys that won Black Belt World Championships</p>
<p>and you were like in awe of them.</p>
<p>It almost had that ADCC champion feel,</p>
<p>but now that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>You know, I just feel like that,</p>
<p>the younger generation aren&rsquo;t looking at</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s winning Black Belt, Gi Worlds.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>they want to be that guy.</p>
<p>They want to be like a Rotolo, Gordon,</p>
<p>you know, those are the people they want to emulate.</p>
<p>So you think like the Gi,</p>
<p>like ABJJF Gi tournaments will just keep declining popularity?</p>
<p>I think people will still do it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>I think as you&rsquo;re over 30,</p>
<p>because the Gi is a bit of a slower thing</p>
<p>and the Masters participation is bigger in the Gi,</p>
<p>because obviously a no Gi is now heading in a wrestling direction.</p>
<p>Wrestling and heel hooks, you&rsquo;re over 30,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a terrifying prospect, you know?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s terrifying about the Gi?</p>
<p>Less.</p>
<p>So I think in a participation rate,</p>
<p>the ABJJF will still be good,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t think people are as interested as they used to be.</p>
<p>Why is wrestling and heel hooks terrifying?</p>
<p>Like heel hooks, I can vaguely understand</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t understand heel hooks.</p>
<p>You work a desk job and you&rsquo;ve never wrestled</p>
<p>and a guy doubles as you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna probably break your back, you know?</p>
<p>I think the older guys are scared of wrestling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to wrestle at 40.</p>
<p>To learn wrestling at 40.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s even just hard in general</p>
<p>to do wrestling at 40,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s easy to pull half guard in the Gi at 40.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard to do Judo at 40</p>
<p>and people still do it at 40.</p>
<p>Judo hurts more.</p>
<p>Judo is scarier than all of them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think, does wrestling really hurt in 40?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I feel, I agree with you saying that Judo</p>
<p>looks like the most dangerous.</p>
<p>Like even their practice partners,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just getting slammed flat.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>I mean, I did Judo for a really long time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that are 40, 50, 60 do Judo</p>
<p>and they get-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones that are still alive though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Survivor bias.</p>
<p>You do a little bit of Judo, right?</p>
<p>Me, I&rsquo;m a yellow belt.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a yellow belt in Judo?</p>
<p>I should be an instructor.</p>
<p>Promote you to orange.</p>
<p>I got a yellow belt in the sixth grade.</p>
<p>I believe it was the sixth grade.</p>
<p>I did it for about, I don&rsquo;t know, six months.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also using Judo in competition, basically.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you doing like Harai type throw,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re doing-</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know where I learned that.</p>
<p>I just started doing it.</p>
<p>You just started lifting your leg in various ways</p>
<p>until the worst?</p>
<p>Just figuring it out, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Doing different kinds of trips?</p>
<p>I looked at the sandboat guys doing it.</p>
<p>I was like, can&rsquo;t be that hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Gave it a crack.</p>
<p>Well, they looked at your foot locks</p>
<p>and they said, that can&rsquo;t be that hard.</p>
<p>They said, can&rsquo;t be that hard.</p>
<p>Ban it from the tournaments.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What do you think is the best takedown in Nogi Jiu-Jitsu?</p>
<p>Like what, like if people were trying to train</p>
<p>for competition and so on,</p>
<p>like where you see the trends heading?</p>
<p>I think the foot sweep is like catching fire nowadays.</p>
<p>See a lot of foot sweeps and arm drags,</p>
<p>I would say pretty popular in our sport.</p>
<p>Arm drag.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just got arm drag to, okay.</p>
<p>Arm drag either to get them,</p>
<p>like get to behind them</p>
<p>or even just to cause reactions,</p>
<p>make them pull away and we can start reattacking.</p>
<p>Are you talking about it in a context of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best takedown to score?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the safest takedown to mitigate the risk</p>
<p>of guillotine submission or most effective in general?</p>
<p>Yeah, most effective combined.</p>
<p>Combined, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately it&rsquo;s about scoring.</p>
<p>I think any sort of body lock,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Locking your hands around the body,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been able to put it to the floor that way.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s most effective,</p>
<p>safest might even have arisen out of a leg attack,</p>
<p>a leg entry, upgrade to the body.</p>
<p>What about like foot sweeps,</p>
<p>like outside foot sweeps?</p>
<p>I would say, yeah, you know,</p>
<p>foot sweeps from outside foot sweeps</p>
<p>or even like something like you&rsquo;re tossed</p>
<p>on a opponent body and you&rsquo;re sweeping the foot.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are all pretty safe.</p>
<p>See, why is that scary?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not scary at all.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the lifts that are scary.</p>
<p>The lifts, yeah.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s lifting people?</p>
<p>I like a good lift.</p>
<p>Return?</p>
<p>No, not you.</p>
<p>I mean, in master, like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about older guys doing no geek.</p>
<p>Some of those old bosses take it very serious, you know?</p>
<p>They just start lifting.</p>
<p>TRT Welts.</p>
<p>TRT Welts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming to impress.</p>
<p>Grab a lift.</p>
<p>All right, just for the gram.</p>
<p>Okay, what about submission?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite submission?</p>
<p>And what do you think is the most effective submission?</p>
<p>Except the buggy choke.</p>
<p>I would have to say the rear naked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely the one that&rsquo;s hit the most</p>
<p>and the highest level of competition.</p>
<p>Was that, that was pretty interesting to see you escape all that</p>
<p>and to put it on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cool thing about EBI,</p>
<p>to see like the world-class athletes.</p>
<p>I was surprised that it&rsquo;s possible to escape</p>
<p>with you on his back.</p>
<p>Gotta try some B cream.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>B cream, as it helps.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the, what&rsquo;s the formula?</p>
<p>Or is that a secret?</p>
<p>That is a proprietary blend, for sure.</p>
<p>Okay, but that&rsquo;s what you use for greasing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you greased before, allegedly.</p>
<p>Does it have other application outside of grappling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can get creative.</p>
<p>All right, thanks.</p>
<p>Asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Is that RNC for you as well?</p>
<p>Rear naked?</p>
<p>Rear naked choke.</p>
<p>I mean, overall favorite for like solidifying a finish.</p>
<p>Cause like you can push, you can put somebody to sleep, right?</p>
<p>Even if they don&rsquo;t want to tag, put them to sleep.</p>
<p>But as far as like something I&rsquo;ve been working on now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m now starting to implement in competition,</p>
<p>Yoko Senkaku side triangle is like, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>You have multiple options.</p>
<p>You have the triangle to finish.</p>
<p>If that fails, you have the Kimura.</p>
<p>You could break the arm.</p>
<p>You could also just transfer and take the back.</p>
<p>So Yoko Senkaku, I&rsquo;m a big fan of</p>
<p>and I continue to progress and get better at it.</p>
<p>Have you ever broken anyone&rsquo;s arm?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the first few competitions,</p>
<p>cause I was like, you know, pretty athletic grappler</p>
<p>or athletic wrestler going against</p>
<p>like local black belts and brown belts.</p>
<p>Like one of my first matches, I broke somebody at Kimura.</p>
<p>Pretty much every time I&rsquo;ve got a heel hook,</p>
<p>which is only twice I&rsquo;ve broken an opponent.</p>
<p>If I have a joint lock, it&rsquo;s probably going to break.</p>
<p>Like a lot of times it breaks before they tap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You seem like a really friendly fella.</p>
<p>How hard is it to break an arm or break a joint?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that hard.</p>
<p>I think like if you&rsquo;re talking like about an armbar,</p>
<p>we have this position to where like</p>
<p>people are kind of holding on, holding on.</p>
<p>And then it slips and their arm starts going.</p>
<p>And then it just breaks before they even,</p>
<p>you know, get a chance to tap.</p>
<p>I love this point.</p>
<p>I knee barred a guy and he didn&rsquo;t tap one time.</p>
<p>And it was actually, it was surprising.</p>
<p>I had to put a lot of force into that</p>
<p>as opposed to arms, shoulders,</p>
<p>and the ligaments in the knees and ankles.</p>
<p>But to fully, this kid, Sambo kid, fully let it go.</p>
<p>And he tapped it.</p>
<p>I think the angle is like up here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re built different.</p>
<p>Hopefully he can be reconstructed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s rebuilt different.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What about a straight foot lock?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve ever, do you guys do straight foot locks at all?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m learning them now.</p>
<p>We had some kid come in the practice one day</p>
<p>and like fucking full lock all of us, dude.</p>
<p>For the straight foot lock.</p>
<p>Straight foot lock.</p>
<p>Just this little like Polish kid.</p>
<p>Not only did he foot lock everyone,</p>
<p>but he told the entire world.</p>
<p>He sent out a fucking email.</p>
<p>Including his friends and family.</p>
<p>We practically put a hit out on him in practice</p>
<p>and he just stopped everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always interesting when you get like,</p>
<p>yeah, people that specialize can surprise you</p>
<p>that this could be effective stuff.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s other stuff</p>
<p>that could be still discovered in Jiu Jitsu?</p>
<p>Like what areas do you think are ripe</p>
<p>with techniques to discover?</p>
<p>Like wrestling is really interesting now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of innovation happening in wrestling.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ll be more innovation</p>
<p>when we get people that are more adamant</p>
<p>about standing up from bottom position.</p>
<p>I think if we get more of the community,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, all right, I want to get off the bottom.</p>
<p>Just stand up.</p>
<p>Just stand up.</p>
<p>How Jiu Jitsu doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>We actually changed the name.</p>
<p>How Sambo doesn&rsquo;t work if you just stand up.</p>
<p>Did you really?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll change it to Jiu Jitsu when I pirate it</p>
<p>and send it for free to the entirety of the Soviet block.</p>
<p>Hey, Nick, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Do you think ego is useful for martial arts</p>
<p>or does it get in the way?</p>
<p>Okay, I think you need to use it in both ways.</p>
<p>For sure, have an ego,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re training competition,</p>
<p>but also it can prevent you from learning</p>
<p>and progressing if your ego is too high.</p>
<p>Like you really have to shut the ego down</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the mode of learning</p>
<p>and trying to develop skills</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to put yourself</p>
<p>in these bad positions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have issues with training partners</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t necessarily up to your skill level,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;re in these bad positions,</p>
<p>you have to make these certain sacrifices.</p>
<p>And for sure, ego can be a good or bad thing,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re able to shut the ego off and learn,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;ll have huge progression</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s time to put the ego on into use</p>
<p>during competition.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the last time you shut the ego off?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time.</p>
<p>What about you, Craig?</p>
<p>I mean, you seem to be super easygoing.</p>
<p>Like is the ego just not part of it?</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want anyone to know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve damaged my ego.</p>
<p>You know, you have to suppress it deep down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a child underneath all of it crying always.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I think ego is good for a bit of perseverance,</p>
<p>you know, like it&rsquo;ll help you stick it out</p>
<p>against a tough battle with a training partner,</p>
<p>for sure, a bit of ego&rsquo;s on the line.</p>
<p>Plus the banter back and forth,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to like stir each other up a bit.</p>
<p>I think that helps hone, sharpen the ego a bit.</p>
<p>Oh, what about you?</p>
<p>Do you try, do you seem like a super humble guy?</p>
<p>Is there like a monster underneath?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a total act.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an act, who&rsquo;s in the basement.</p>
<p>I definitely think ego&rsquo;s a big motivator.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s very good to have</p>
<p>in the aspect that it like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll drive you to help,</p>
<p>to want to be one of the best in the world.</p>
<p>But like Nicky Rod said,</p>
<p>you need to be able to turn it off in the training room</p>
<p>and, you know, force yourself into bad positions</p>
<p>where you may not be winning.</p>
<p>Are there like, you know, Donaher&rsquo;s mentioned Boris.</p>
<p>Are there like grapplers, like Boris,</p>
<p>this is a question from Reddit actually.</p>
<p>Boris-like characters,</p>
<p>anybody you&rsquo;ve trained with in the past</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t compete,</p>
<p>but is just an absolute beast in training?</p>
<p>Like people you&rsquo;ve met that are just like.</p>
<p>Well, somebody that I think has a probably</p>
<p>the best like submission grappling in MMA,</p>
<p>I think like Gilbert Burns is a,</p>
<p>is his submission grappling is very, very good.</p>
<p>I trained with him early on in my grappling career</p>
<p>and I was really impressed by his ability to move,</p>
<p>hold down opponents that are trying to stand up.</p>
<p>And as a whole, you know,</p>
<p>he can get submissions and put people away.</p>
<p>Have you, when&rsquo;s the last time,</p>
<p>have you trained with him recently or no?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s been a few years.</p>
<p>Which is impressive ability to submit, you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, I mean, you know, you would see,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d see Gilbert go against a few like</p>
<p>pretty decent black belts in the room and farewell.</p>
<p>And, you know, maybe he gets to their back,</p>
<p>puts a choke in and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Gilbert&rsquo;s super high-level grappling</p>
<p>or submission grappling.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he&rsquo;s pretty widely recognized as a monster.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, you didn&rsquo;t really answer the question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not even listening anymore.</p>
<p>What was the question?</p>
<p>All right, well, is there people,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve done all these seminars,</p>
<p>are there just, especially in the Eastern block,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen, like you went to Kazakhstan,</p>
<p>is there killers out there that-</p>
<p>Oh yeah, there&rsquo;s tough guys out there.</p>
<p>Obviously, I don&rsquo;t remember the names</p>
<p>nor could I pronounce it if I did,</p>
<p>but definitely some tough guys out there,</p>
<p>obviously carrying skillsets over from wrestling for sure.</p>
<p>Not Sambo, but wrestling.</p>
<p>But yeah, are there just people that surprise you</p>
<p>that just don&rsquo;t compete, that are really good?</p>
<p>Are there, have you met those?</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s less so today</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many more athletes in the sport.</p>
<p>But definitely when I was coming up</p>
<p>back like in Australia and stuff,</p>
<p>there were guys I&rsquo;d trained with that wouldn&rsquo;t compete</p>
<p>and that would be like super tough rounds for me.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many more avenues for competing in general.</p>
<p>So yeah, what about you?</p>
<p>Have you met some monsters?</p>
<p>Yeah, one guy I could think of in particular is Jason Rau.</p>
<p>He trains up in Long Island, I think, right?</p>
<p>Opened up his own gym out there.</p>
<p>Vanguard.</p>
<p>Yeah, Vanguard.</p>
<p>He used to compete, but he would never be able to compete</p>
<p>at the same level he would train at.</p>
<p>So now he&rsquo;s just focused on mainly opening up a gym</p>
<p>and teaching his students.</p>
<p>But he was a guy that was extremely good</p>
<p>in the training room, world-class.</p>
<p>I still think to this day,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s legitimately one of the best in the world,</p>
<p>but just doesn&rsquo;t compete anymore.</p>
<p>Who wins in a fight, a lion or a bear?</p>
<p>Polar bear?</p>
<p>This is for you, Reddit.</p>
<p>No, not a polar, well, yes, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>See, polar bear is pretty impressive.</p>
<p>No, grizzly bear.</p>
<p>Grizzly bear.</p>
<p>I think a grizzly bear wins.</p>
<p>Well, who was the most threatening predator in Australia?</p>
<p>Kangaroo?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s a tricky question here</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s scared of the animals in Australia,</p>
<p>but I mean, you get bitten by a snake,</p>
<p>you get bitten by a spider.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>
<p>Bear, America, bear will just hold you down and eat you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a much more terrifying prospect for me.</p>
<p>Even sharks, shark&rsquo;s gonna be quick.</p>
<p>No one sees the shark coming.</p>
<p>The shark&rsquo;s just gonna bite you in half.</p>
<p>A bear will take a bite and chew.</p>
<p>A bear just holds you down and eats you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s frightening for me.</p>
<p>Australia is a bunch of just weird shit that can kill you.</p>
<p>Did you see Cocaine Bear, the movie that&rsquo;s coming out?</p>
<p>I saw the trailer.</p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not every bear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like black belts and there&rsquo;s black belts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s bears and there&rsquo;s bears.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what they often don&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>Everybody puts lions and bears in the same category.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just some weak bears.</p>
<p>A lion would kill a black bear, I think.</p>
<p>Not every black, again, I&rsquo;m trying to tell you there&rsquo;s difference.</p>
<p>But grizzly and polar bear, I&rsquo;m betting on those.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I think grizzlies have the size,</p>
<p>but actually every video I&rsquo;ve seen of grizzlies,</p>
<p>they tie out within like 20 seconds.</p>
<p>They get bored.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the gas tank?</p>
<p>Yeah, the gas tank.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a Nicky Ryan gas tank right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s all they got.</p>
<p>Dream old.</p>
<p>And they try to just take a breather.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s these crazy fights between bears</p>
<p>and they last like 20 seconds.</p>
<p>I heard this story about a Russian family</p>
<p>that was attacked by a bear in Russia and killed the dad.</p>
<p>And it took so long to eat the daughter.</p>
<p>She made three phone calls to her mom</p>
<p>when I was eating her.</p>
<p>And the first call, the mom thought she was pranking her.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way scarier than what we got there.</p>
<p>Give me a snake bite any day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what, let me change the question.</p>
<p>If you had to fight a bear or a lion,</p>
<p>how would you try to defeat it?</p>
<p>Do you think you have a chance at all?</p>
<p>Well, I think I&rsquo;d attack a lion a little bit differently</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;d attack a bear.</p>
<p>What would be the difference?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve seen this video where a lions are eating</p>
<p>and you have three like skinny guys walk up behind them</p>
<p>and kind of scare the cat off of their food.</p>
<p>I think maybe I produce some props,</p>
<p>scare the lion away, right?</p>
<p>But if I have to fight it straight on,</p>
<p>I mean, the thing is that even if you take the back,</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t like bite it or choke it,</p>
<p>the mane is too big to lock your hands around, you know?</p>
<p>Are you sure about that?</p>
<p>The mane is just hair.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s thick hair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like matted hair, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So I think-</p>
<p>You think you can maintain back control on a lion?</p>
<p>Maintain, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But getting there, I think I fake how I go low, right?</p>
<p>Make them think I&rsquo;m going for the foot or something,</p>
<p>a little pulse sweep, and I take the back.</p>
<p>What about a bear?</p>
<p>I feel like they&rsquo;re easier.</p>
<p>That might be easier to take, to hold back control.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>The thing is if the bear falls on its back,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to crush it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so big, substantially bigger than a lion, right?</p>
<p>Like a full-grown grizzly.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also like terrifyingly loud</p>
<p>with their roars and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, so first of all,</p>
<p>if I saw a grizzly, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>all right, he&rsquo;s going to attack me.</p>
<p>I try to yell a little bit louder than them,</p>
<p>maybe deter him a little bit, like give him a, oh, nope.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, for sure, I try to get behind it.</p>
<p>I probably go like something weird,</p>
<p>maybe like pull the eyes out or something, you know?</p>
<p>For sure, I mean, I&rsquo;m going for the vital organs, you know?</p>
<p>Play dead.</p>
<p>Play dead.</p>
<p>And then oil check it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pride in that.</p>
<p>Wow, pride even matters.</p>
<p>See, the ego, the same advice you gave,</p>
<p>you got to put the ego aside with a bear.</p>
<p>Even then, even then, would you,</p>
<p>how would you fight a bear or a lion?</p>
<p>Just play dead?</p>
<p>Play dead, yeah.</p>
<p>Could you beat a kangaroo?</p>
<p>A kangaroo?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Kangaroo?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d beat the shit out of a kangaroo.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, are we boxing gloves?</p>
<p>We just like-</p>
<p>How would a kangaroo attack a human?</p>
<p>Try to kick him with the claws.</p>
<p>Knock him down, and then they choke him.</p>
<p>Stand on that tail.</p>
<p>The kangaroos do?</p>
<p>They choke each other, yeah.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t choke each other.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t believe me?</p>
<p>You want to watch a video?</p>
<p>They choke each other out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it real?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>With which?</p>
<p>With a headlock or what?</p>
<p>Yeah, they knock him and just grip like this and hold him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the grip?</p>
<p>Like little paws.</p>
<p>How are they gripping?</p>
<p>I promise you, I&rsquo;m not lying to you.</p>
<p>Pretty sure I&rsquo;ve seen the video.</p>
<p>They also do strange shit,</p>
<p>like if there&rsquo;s a predator around, they&rsquo;ll wait in a pool of water.</p>
<p>And then if it comes to attack, they drown it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty smart.</p>
<p>Okay, speaking of which,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the most effective martial art for winning a street fight?</p>
<p>You talked about rule sets and streets.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve talked about being a street-</p>
<p>Have you ever been in a street fight?</p>
<p>Yeah, just one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nothing special, nothing crazy, hey?</p>
<p>Yeah, you don&rsquo;t talk about that time.</p>
<p>Like for self-defense purposes,</p>
<p>what would be a strategy on the street?</p>
<p>Whoever wins the street fights,</p>
<p>whoever&rsquo;s willing to take it the furthest, the fastest.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking you&rsquo;re going to box</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s biting you, poking your eyes,</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s going to win.</p>
<p>He wants it more.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the crackheads fight.</p>
<p>They go for the kill straight away.</p>
<p>So I feel like it&rsquo;s more about who&rsquo;s willing to do the most</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to win that fight.</p>
<p>Fastest, the most fastest.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s got the least to lose, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, we could also define winning differently</p>
<p>because you could also run away.</p>
<p>But in terms of technique-wise,</p>
<p>wrestling, Judo.</p>
<p>I think if it&rsquo;s a one-on-one, I&rsquo;d go wrestler wins.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s like multiple people,</p>
<p>you got to go Muay Thai, stay on your feet.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t go down to the ground if it&rsquo;s more than one person.</p>
<p>Yeah, big double leg maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, double leg, put him asleep on the impact, right?</p>
<p>Forehead to the ground.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the goal here?</p>
<p>Is to win the fight and not go to prison?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought of it through that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, certainly, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, not to kill the person.</p>
<p>You got mutual combat here in Texas, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Is that in Texas?</p>
<p>Do you know what the paperwork for that looks like?</p>
<p>Do you have to actually sign something?</p>
<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t need to find out.</p>
<p>I did hear a story where guys were on Sixth Street</p>
<p>and they looked at a cop,</p>
<p>they were like mutual combat, mutual combat</p>
<p>and just got the cops to say yes</p>
<p>and just duked it out.</p>
<p>That could be false though.</p>
<p>That sounds crazy, I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I kind of admire that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve also been playing Red Dead Redemption recently.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve internalized the cowboy a little too much.</p>
<p>Just to return to gym stuff.</p>
<p>No, because it&rsquo;s a business,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re running a business,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s money involved, but you&rsquo;re also friends,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also training partners.</p>
<p>Is there a tension that money creates</p>
<p>that threatens to destroy friendships?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I always worry about with money.</p>
<p>I try not to go do any kind of business</p>
<p>with friends or family.</p>
<p>I think if it were all very clear and honest</p>
<p>and open at the start, it makes it much easier.</p>
<p>I think people have issues when there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>kind of like things are written in fine print</p>
<p>and nobody knows the exact answers.</p>
<p>And a lot of jujitsu guys can&rsquo;t read.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re learning that today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Definitely complicated though.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s not always obvious</p>
<p>how to be transparent and stuff about everything.</p>
<p>Have you felt that tension?</p>
<p>Because in the jujitsu world, money&rsquo;s not really unlimited.</p>
<p>Just running a school, what&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;re running a school,</p>
<p>running a gym.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s just constantly updating people</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on, what your expectations are.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had some problems with coaches</p>
<p>who I feel like think the pie is bigger than it is.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>They feel like maybe we&rsquo;re getting rich out of this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re missing out on things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, even amongst managing staff,</p>
<p>that can be challenging too.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a constant work in progress</p>
<p>to make, not only to make sure everyone&rsquo;s happy,</p>
<p>but to make sure they&rsquo;re comfortable enough</p>
<p>to reach out and tell you they&rsquo;re unhappy.</p>
<p>But I feel like those challenges are common</p>
<p>amongst any small business.</p>
<p>Still, it sucks.</p>
<p>Just to mention, I&rsquo;m clueless to this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just now learning this.</p>
<p>Somebody I met and talked to and I really like is Isaac.</p>
<p>I just learned, because you&rsquo;re also active on Reddit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your name on Reddit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s John Belushi&rsquo;s mom.</p>
<p>As undercover as possible, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s not you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually John Belushi&rsquo;s mom, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve done my research, I guess.</p>
<p>And I guess you guys had a falling out and have split.</p>
<p>I just want to say that, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the few interactions I&rsquo;ve had with him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a beautiful human being.</p>
<p>And that just shows to me-</p>
<p>Visually, maybe not internally.</p>
<p>And sexually, just the experience.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a kind person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I liked him a lot.</p>
<p>Like to me, in a business setting,</p>
<p>yeah, tensions are created and it sucks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose money,</p>
<p>all the stuff that happened in the jungle aside,</p>
<p>probably money had a role to play to create extra tension.</p>
<p>Money and egos about like,</p>
<p>who is the leader, who is not the leader?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to manage that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it happen with jujitsu schools a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there is also a hierarchy inside grappling jujitsu schools,</p>
<p>like people that are better or not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally ranks, black belt and brown belt.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like competitors that are better.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a weird dynamic in which to operate.</p>
<p>Because like, usually there&rsquo;s more politeness</p>
<p>and like humanity layered into the way a company works.</p>
<p>But here there&rsquo;s just a bunch of,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like violence laid on display,</p>
<p>plus money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say to that?</p>
<p>Like how you try to minimize?</p>
<p>Or something you want to comment on, Isaac?</p>
<p>I mean, it was unfortunate situation,</p>
<p>but it just didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>You know, like there&rsquo;s going to be personality clashes.</p>
<p>Some people&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone having a personality clash with you.</p>
<p>With me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Surprising, shocking.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I didn&rsquo;t even know what to say on that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to touch on it too much,</p>
<p>but obviously his expectations about his role in the gym,</p>
<p>obviously different from ours,</p>
<p>led to some personality clashes.</p>
<p>It was sort of unresolvable.</p>
<p>You know, some things happen that can&rsquo;t be resolved.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fix those things.</p>
<p>You know, obviously a lesson, I hope for both of us,</p>
<p>definitely a lesson for me from a management role</p>
<p>to try to address these things sooner.</p>
<p>But also sometimes I came up in a different time</p>
<p>where there was no money, no opportunities.</p>
<p>I had to pave that way totally for myself,</p>
<p>especially coming from Australia.</p>
<p>Like being a professional athlete in jiu-jitsu was not a thing.</p>
<p>So I had to pave a lot of opportunities for myself.</p>
<p>And I feel like sometimes&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right word is.</p>
<p>Sometimes people don&rsquo;t appreciate some of the ways you help them.</p>
<p>And they just think, feel like almost they deserve</p>
<p>or are entitled to certain things.</p>
<p>And that is very difficult to manage.</p>
<p>But I think, again, like we both see the situation different.</p>
<p>I do hope he finds a better, a more comfortable place to train.</p>
<p>But yeah, obviously I&rsquo;ve known him for a long time,</p>
<p>sort of like a brotherly relationship.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gonna really make personal problems a lot worse</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re that close to someone, you know?</p>
<p>I just hate it that like I&rsquo;ve seen in jiu-jitsu especially,</p>
<p>but in other places where like close friendships were destroyed</p>
<p>because of like gym stuff, like people running gyms.</p>
<p>And it just, as a person who is, in this case, just a fan,</p>
<p>but in general, just like a student, it&rsquo;s like sucks.</p>
<p>But again, in my position, sometimes I wonder</p>
<p>if there really was a friendship or mere opportunity.</p>
<p>I have to be careful of that with some people in the sport.</p>
<p>Is it a sincere relationship?</p>
<p>Or like, I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to tell.</p>
<p>Or am I a means to an end?</p>
<p>Sure, but I think it&rsquo;s actually a trade-off</p>
<p>because I think a lot of close friendships we have,</p>
<p>like even relationships we have, like when tested,</p>
<p>like can break if they&rsquo;re not properly communicated.</p>
<p>Like some of it could be just misunderstanding</p>
<p>of like for a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not explained through just like a lack of integrity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like you have to like talk through that shit.</p>
<p>Like just be honest with each other.</p>
<p>Take some MDMA and really get down to it.</p>
<p>Exactly, drugs solve everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already heard it from this conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually haven&rsquo;t done MDMA yet.</p>
<p>People say that that&rsquo;s something I would enjoy a lot</p>
<p>because my brain is, I think, natural on MDMA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend it for sure.</p>
<p>For sure, all right.</p>
<p>Is that what you did with Gabby on the All Titan?</p>
<p>Okay, nevermind.</p>
<p>She drugged me.</p>
<p>In general, why does there always seem to be drama</p>
<p>in the Jiu-Jitsu world?</p>
<p>Like outside of what&rsquo;s going on here or is it just-</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s universal to anything.</p>
<p>Drama is everywhere and then drama rises to the surface.</p>
<p>Drama makes the money.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wish there was a little bit less.</p>
<p>You have a bunch of, like we mentioned some of them,</p>
<p>you have a bunch of instructionals out.</p>
<p>What are some interesting things that you&rsquo;re looking forward to</p>
<p>like exploring in terms of teaching?</p>
<p>So Just Stand Up is your most recent one, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you also have one called Power Bottom</p>
<p>Inclusive Modern Approach to the Guard.</p>
<p>Yep, yep.</p>
<p>What are some other ones?</p>
<p>False Reap Allegations.</p>
<p>False Reap Allegations, yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, people talk about Power Bottom, again, hilarious title,</p>
<p>but they say it&rsquo;s a really good instructional on the guard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try to at least be innovative, you know,</p>
<p>like everyone else I feel like&rsquo;s ripping off John and Gordon,</p>
<p>putting some sort of slants on that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to take sort of a different approach.</p>
<p>I think you can actively influence the sport</p>
<p>with what you release,</p>
<p>because people are going to try to emulate that.</p>
<p>So I think those type of instructionals,</p>
<p>Just Stand Up, Power Bottom,</p>
<p>like approaching the sport differently,</p>
<p>I think definitely has a positive impact</p>
<p>on how people play the game.</p>
<p>Yeah, are you working on something now?</p>
<p>Probably a fundamentals course,</p>
<p>just because we&rsquo;re bringing out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got the White Belt program coming in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to develop a fundamentals course</p>
<p>along the line of the constraint-based learning stuff</p>
<p>we were talking about today,</p>
<p>like a way to approach learning as a beginner</p>
<p>to sort of speed up the process a bit</p>
<p>and not make it as so technique dense,</p>
<p>at least have it a bit more fun.</p>
<p>And focusing in on just like examples of problems to solve.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>Approaching judicially learning that way.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, kids learn quick through games.</p>
<p>I think adults are capable of that</p>
<p>to a certain extent as well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re releasing that instructional</p>
<p>on pre-match preparation?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What other stuff?</p>
<p>Do you have a thing on a body-lock pass?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a body-lock or a body-lock DVD,</p>
<p>or instructional.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have the pre-match ritual coming out.</p>
<p>I also have, I&rsquo;m filming</p>
<p>how to build athleticism for grappling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just really trying to capture different angles,</p>
<p>kind of like the same,</p>
<p>what Craig&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>trying not to do the same thing</p>
<p>that everybody else does.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of wrestling,</p>
<p>ton of jujitsu instructional, so.</p>
<p>And the steroid results are coming out.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>More plates, more dates.</p>
<p>Derek runs that.</p>
<p>He hit me up for a blood panel test,</p>
<p>like an impromptu thing,</p>
<p>and I did it a few days ago,</p>
<p>and I believe the results will come out shortly.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Do you know the results?</p>
<p>What are you betting on, Lex?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very impressive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting me in an awkward position here.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;ll face Gordon soon?</p>
<p>Um, I&rsquo;m open to it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how soon,</p>
<p>maybe in the next six months.</p>
<p>I could see me facing him before ADCC Worlds.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great rivalry.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really interesting one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun for me.</p>
<p>Is there any chance that the two,</p>
<p>the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany get back together?</p>
<p>That DDS, under whatever name, gets back together?</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Highly unlikely.</p>
<p>I mean, we kind of did this to back up Nicky Ryan,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sticking with our guy.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s just too many personality conflicts</p>
<p>for it to really ever work again.</p>
<p>Do you think there will always be war in the world?</p>
<p>War?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I think from the beginning of time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been some kind of war, some kind of battle.</p>
<p>Controversy is what helps people evolve.</p>
<p>Until AI, super intelligent AI,</p>
<p>becomes way more powerful than humans</p>
<p>and humbles all of us with its power</p>
<p>before it destroys us.</p>
<p>Well, until it runs out of batteries.</p>
<p>You guys are screwed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really fortunate to be able to hang out with you,</p>
<p>to train with you,</p>
<p>and thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best ending.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Craig Jones, Nicky Rod, and Nicky Ryan.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p>You must understand that there&rsquo;s more than one path</p>
<p>to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
