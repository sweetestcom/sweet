<p>i&rsquo;m always thinking</p>
<p>about worst case scenarios well you live by the</p>
<p>water when you live by venice</p>
<p>you really must take into account that we just like</p>
<p>japan are on a fault line</p>
<p>and that shit</p>
<p>could happen here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fucking nine dude a nine</p>
<p>a nine we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even wrap our heads around what that means a nine is so</p>
<p>crazy i saw a</p>

<p>those shrooms and</p>
<p>it was awesome</p>

<p>it was so clean</p>
<p>did i ever tell you my</p>
<p>shrooms experience</p>

<p>short for my torso</p>
<p>oh and by the way</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a coat hanger i&rsquo;ve always wanted to be a barrel</p>
<p>chested samoan</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a coat hanger from a long line</p>
<p>peasant and i</p>
<p>irish stock</p>
<p>we were used to</p>
<p>being persecuted running</p>
<p>knobby knees the</p>
<p>whole thing was a disaster</p>
<p>genetics are not fair</p>
<p>no man you look</p>
<p>at some fucking football players some of those</p>
<p>giant goliath</p>
<p>you look at a guy like czech congo</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing next to czech congo</p>
<p>genetics are not fair</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s dudes</p>
<p>that are born like your friend that we were talking</p>
<p>about in the</p>
<p>kitchen your friend your</p>
<p>doughy small</p>
<p>effeminate friend</p>
<p>that guy just</p>
<p>gotta roll the dice</p>
<p>looks like he looks like an overgrown baby</p>
<p>just a roll the dice man</p>
<p>he could have been</p>
<p>checked congo i know</p>
<p>motherfucker i know</p>
<p>if i could be</p>
<p>built like any</p>
<p>if i could have any gene</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d want samoan</p>
<p>jeans samoan just big</p>
<p>they can take</p>
<p>a punch too man</p>
<p>jesus christ mark hunt he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a k1 champion he&rsquo;s now and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting the</p>
<p>ufc now just won his last</p>
<p>fight and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>famous for it</p>
<p>dude&rsquo;s head kicking up and he just fucking</p>
<p>wobbles a little and then straightens</p>
<p>right back up he</p>
<p>keeps coming</p>
<p>they did a thing on if you are samoan you are 55</p>
<p>times i believe this was the number</p>
<p>and it was on 60 minutes</p>
<p>and i believe they said</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re samoan</p>
<p>you are 55 times more likely to play in the nfl</p>
<p>than any white guy on the planet</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so fucking</p>
<p>strong tongins the</p>
<p>maoris and the samoans they&rsquo;re just on another level</p>
<p>giant bones like</p>
<p>wrists like</p>
<p>elbows and fast yeah</p>
<p>like a lot of fast twitch muscle</p>
<p>not this endurance muscle remember david tua</p>
<p>oh yeah david tua</p>
<p>could have been like i knew his trainer</p>
<p>dude he was so badass but for whatever reason</p>
<p>never really totally got it together</p>
<p>lennox lewis beat him</p>
<p>and that took</p>
<p>a lot of wind out of his sales because linux</p>
<p>tagged him a couple times pretty hard well</p>
<p>i know the guy that trained</p>
<p>tua for that</p>
<p>fight for the linux</p>
<p>lewis fight i&rsquo;ve actually worked out with him</p>
<p>and he said that the</p>
<p>first time tua had ever done he</p>
<p>never done a squat</p>
<p>and i believe</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to misquote him but then he said</p>
<p>he put 420 on his</p>
<p>shoulders and</p>
<p>he did a deep squat he went all the way down to</p>
<p>where his ass is</p>
<p>touching his heels</p>
<p>and came back up and the</p>
<p>trainer was like who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>power lifter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never squatted</p>
<p>he goes no man</p>
<p>by the end of it he was like</p>
<p>they had to</p>
<p>attach two horses two dead</p>
<p>horses to a bar you know dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of the scariest</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>boxers to come</p>
<p>along in a long</p>
<p>time he wasn&rsquo;t able to beat the best guys he</p>
<p>could never beat</p>
<p>lennox lewis</p>
<p>but he could</p>
<p>put anybody to</p>
<p>sleep did you ever see the</p>
<p>fight when he fought john ruiz</p>
<p>no he caught</p>
<p>john it&rsquo;s on youtube he caught john ruiz burrough</p>
<p>is a very big man</p>
<p>tough dude too</p>
<p>you know burly guy</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t john ruiz</p>
<p>fight holyfield like</p>
<p>three fucking times</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>think he did didn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>yeah he was</p>
<p>rough david too</p>
<p>put him to sleep</p>
<p>dude just jumped on him early</p>
<p>hit him with</p>
<p>those gigantic</p>
<p>ham hawks fix</p>
<p>hit him with like</p>
<p>he tagged him</p>
<p>early and then just put him away</p>
<p>put him completely</p>
<p>asleep well you know you wonder as more and more</p>
<p>money ventures into</p>
<p>mma some of</p>
<p>those guys who are playing some of</p>
<p>those herschel</p>
<p>walkers and</p>
<p>and michael vicks they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start coming to mma yeah</p>
<p>some of the guys who don&rsquo;t want to they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>be playing for a team they&rsquo;d rather fight</p>
<p>also ironically way more dangerous</p>
<p>for you crazy right</p>
<p>than is any mma</p>
<p>career that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny that people dispute that but</p>
<p>everyone looks at it in</p>
<p>an emotional way you don&rsquo;t look at it in a contact way</p>
<p>look at these people are running at each</p>
<p>other and at 50 years old take a look at</p>
<p>their heads yeah</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>even it&rsquo;s not a little bit more dangerous</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way more dangerous way</p>
<p>more dangerous</p>
<p>those fucking poor guys</p>
<p>like that kid was his name chris</p>
<p>henry the kid that fell off the back of a pickup</p>
<p>truck and died</p>
<p>remember he was chasing</p>
<p>after his girlfriend receiver yeah yeah</p>
<p>really talented athlete right well</p>
<p>young kid i but i</p>
<p>think he was only like</p>
<p>twenty five</p>
<p>twenty five or twenty</p>
<p>i think he was</p>
<p>twenty five</p>
<p>anyway they</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking massive</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>when they did an autopsy on him</p>
<p>you know the concussions that he&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>since playing football</p>
<p>he actually</p>
<p>shrinks and all kinds yeah you get</p>
<p>dementia i mean that&rsquo;s what lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease is all</p>
<p>about i mean</p>
<p>a lot of these guys are getting it it&rsquo;s all from</p>
<p>head impacts and just</p>
<p>irreparable damage i used to think</p>
<p>yeah because the als or lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>they used to</p>
<p>think was a function of</p>
<p>toxin they had all different kinds of theories but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re starting to link</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to link</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>stuff to the als</p>
<p>syndrome whatever to to</p>
<p>head injuries</p>
<p>yeah there was a whole</p>
<p>bride gumble special</p>
<p>about it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary stuff man people take that real</p>
<p>lightly you</p>
<p>know they take head</p>
<p>trauma real lightly</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d say well</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>learning more and more i</p>
<p>guess now and now</p>
<p>you know that really</p>
<p>raises a huge question which is</p>
<p>if indeed you can</p>
<p>start to prove that</p>
<p>four concussions or</p>
<p>three concussions cause</p>
<p>brain damage if that&rsquo;s the case or and and and</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re able to actually measure this</p>
<p>mm hmm it will</p>
<p>put a real onus on the nfl to figure out</p>
<p>a way to either change the rules or make helmets safer</p>
<p>but then you don&rsquo;t have football</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>so it really it kind of it does it raises</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t rugby</p>
<p>probably safer because they don&rsquo;t wear helmets</p>
<p>they probably don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smash each other yeah i</p>
<p>went to a rugby</p>
<p>match recently actually in the</p>
<p>south of france with i</p>
<p>think it was like the basque team</p>

<p>to appear to have their shit together no</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an amazing guy and i&rsquo;m gonna tell you</p>
<p>the other thing he is he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truly made peace</p>
<p>with like with he&rsquo;s a true atheist like a real atheist</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s truly made</p>
<p>peace with the fact that he</p>
<p>is only here for a</p>
<p>short period of time and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dying to him</p>
<p>is not something he&rsquo;s afraid of he came down with</p>
<p>tuberculosis</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>because he had</p>
<p>been exposed to it by his grandfather when he was</p>
<p>three years old</p>
<p>so he starts</p>
<p>going to the hospital</p>
<p>and they i get a call my</p>
<p>buddy says they&rsquo;re looking at they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s lung cancer or that disease that</p>
<p>those 911 firemen</p>
<p>get that where your</p>
<p>lungs disintegrate from breathing all that stuff</p>
<p>either one they&rsquo;re both fatal</p>
<p>so and they&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>it and they tell him look this is probably what it is</p>
<p>and i was with him when</p>
<p>shortly after he knew all that you</p>
<p>would never have</p>
<p>known and it&rsquo;s not the nile</p>
<p>he said to me he</p>
<p>goes he told me what the a prognosis was and i was like</p>
<p>jesus my best friends i was like this is the</p>
<p>worst thing</p>
<p>and he said</p>
<p>i said how do you feel you seem so normal he goes bry</p>
<p>first of all if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna die i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>treat it like it&rsquo;s a comedy</p>
<p>and oh by the way my funeral</p>
<p>better be a good time and you better make people laugh</p>
<p>oh and by the way i&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>peace with my life i&rsquo;m not afraid to die</p>
<p>and i saw that</p>
<p>firsthand which i thought was just you</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s just an amazing guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a good grip on</p>
<p>things in a</p>
<p>weird way yeah he reads</p>
<p>everything he knows i mean he knows so much he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very very bright guy that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so strange that</p>
<p>guys like that almost always</p>
<p>in somehow or another</p>
<p>they fall into</p>
<p>some at least</p>
<p>semblance of normalcy</p>
<p>you know you know what i mean like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not 50 with an</p>
<p>apartment and a tv and a bike right</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>you try to get your shit together you run a</p>
<p>house somewhere yeah yeah we&rsquo;ve got a house now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking to buy</p>
<p>but you know we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what anymore or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ambitious which</p>
<p>he never was he&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like anything</p>
<p>self conscious</p>
<p>about either no</p>
<p>is this guy ticklish</p>
<p>um i don&rsquo;t know let&rsquo;s find out</p>
<p>brian i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>brian you got some time this weekend</p>
<p>hey did you see what gilbert godfrey said</p>
<p>about japan yeah</p>
<p>what do you guys</p>
<p>think about that</p>
<p>have you seen it</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s read the</p>
<p>quotes read the</p>
<p>quotes gilbert godfrey</p>
<p>yeah to me it was like all</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not even trying to be like</p>
<p>edgy or like i don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking like it&rsquo;s pretty funny</p>
<p>yeah i mean but</p>
<p>still i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s even to me</p>
<p>yeah too soon well what</p>
<p>did you think</p>
<p>what did you</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>what he said</p>
<p>i just thought</p>
<p>definitely does he realize how many people died</p>
<p>you know how many kids died how many</p>
<p>fucking you know</p>
<p>seriously there&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>where you should just not do anything and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely i</p>
<p>think a time period</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t try to</p>
<p>say anything like that you know</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what i felt i&rsquo;m not fucking raising flags</p>
<p>and protests i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s fair</p>
<p>to be i think we</p>
<p>should all be more conscious</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s feelings this is what 50 cent said</p>
<p>50 cent said</p>
<p>look this is very serious people i had to</p>
<p>evacuate all my hoes from la hawaii and japan</p>
<p>are you serious</p>
<p>i had to do it lol</p>
<p>he gets points up</p>
<p>until the lol</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>first of all because lol</p>
<p>lol especially when you have just the</p>
<p>first letter capitalized</p>
<p>and then the next one not that looks really fucking</p>
<p>stupid dude</p>
<p>all right that looks dumb either you</p>
<p>going with all caps</p>
<p>or no caps with your lols</p>
<p>okay second of all are you a girl</p>
<p>no then what&rsquo;s with the lol</p>
<p>okay listen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for girls and retards</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what lols for</p>
<p>girl but the</p>
<p>the idea behind it you know that you just</p>
<p>start immediately</p>
<p>making jokes about</p>
<p>all these poor fucking people that got hit before i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a defense mechanism</p>
<p>i think a lot of men have that as</p>
<p>defense i don&rsquo;t have a problem with people making jokes</p>
<p>about it why wait you know</p>
<p>i think what he said was hilarious</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d evacuate all my hoes</p>
<p>i mean come on that&rsquo;s fucking funny 50</p>
<p>cents one was fine with me what did</p>
<p>godfrey say</p>
<p>okay you had a much more gilbert godfrey let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see what his tweet said</p>
<p>gilbert godfrey&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tweets were</p>
<p>oh they&rsquo;re not even showing them man</p>
<p>they covered them up</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not in this one what was one</p>
<p>was like a lot of stories where they&rsquo;re not one was</p>
<p>kind of like hey my girlfriend broke up with me</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry another one will</p>
<p>float by soon or something like that yeah</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t find them unfortunately</p>
<p>i think sometimes when you&rsquo;re trying to be</p>
<p>funny sometimes things can go awry</p>
<p>yeah well i mean he&rsquo;s just a silly guy you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a silly guy who</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s funny in the doing yeah but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something you say to your friends maybe</p>
<p>i hung with him a couple times and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>laughed harder with that guy</p>
<p>we did an episode of csi together</p>
<p>we just had the most off</p>
<p>color fun in the world but you also</p>
<p>you also got to</p>
<p>understand the mentality of the new york comedian</p>
<p>newer comics are always trying to over insult</p>
<p>you to the point of being you just</p>
<p>completely outrageous like</p>
<p>jim norton told a really funny</p>
<p>story on opie and anthony</p>
<p>about louis</p>
<p>ck and him hanging out</p>
<p>in the in the village</p>
<p>and lucy k just walks up to him</p>
<p>and slaps his</p>
<p>pizza onto the ground and says your mother&rsquo;s a cunt</p>
<p>like out of nowhere</p>
<p>and and and jim norton is</p>
<p>laughing while he&rsquo;s telling us and he&rsquo;s like i was a</p>
<p>juicy slice of</p>
<p>pizza to i was so mad</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ll read you the text that will status</p>
<p>sends me because we have a relationship like that</p>
<p>where he just we try to</p>
<p>insult each</p>
<p>other the worst we can</p>
<p>he started calling me a mule</p>
<p>and just and he sends me the most outrageous text</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t even describe</p>
<p>those those</p>
<p>relationships with</p>
<p>friends like that are fun like people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>you try to get like</p>
<p>eddie bravo and i do that shit to each</p>
<p>other all the time</p>
<p>but anyway gilbert godfrey is in</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s a comic</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>comic you mean sometimes you</p>
<p>write shit and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re writing shit really for people like you</p>
<p>and for fucking gilbert</p>
<p>if he was at home</p>
<p>and he was reading someone&rsquo;s twitter</p>
<p>and he started saying all this shit</p>
<p>about japan he would be</p>
<p>laughing his fucking ass off</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that he&rsquo;s not a sensitive guy it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>you know bad for all</p>
<p>these people it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>funny well i call them one</p>
<p>time i was doing yeah but have you ever seen a little</p>
<p>asian girl cry</p>
<p>so adorable now times that by millions</p>
<p>and then little gilbert goffier&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going over there</p>
<p>oh listen man i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s right to say</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny to gilbert</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny stuff i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny to me too</p>
<p>look i feel terrible</p>
<p>about what happened in</p>
<p>japan but those are</p>
<p>still good jokes and you know he&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re good jokes but not good jokes</p>
<p>maybe depend</p>
<p>on your twitter</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>no listen i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t say them</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t say him for a</p>
<p>bunch of reasons that says i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to say anything that</p>
<p>would hurt anybody&rsquo;s feelings like that</p>
<p>especially someone who just</p>
<p>randomly got i don&rsquo;t care how</p>
<p>funny the joke is yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think gilbert is the kind of guy whoever</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not got no sacred cows to him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna say the joke and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good guy he&rsquo;s not a bad guy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s looking for the</p>
<p>laugh there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>laugh there and he sees it</p>
<p>and as a comic he just goes for it</p>
<p>and then people</p>
<p>freak out and get upset</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>he probably</p>
<p>never expect he&rsquo;s from the</p>
<p>age of no internet</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s from the</p>
<p>age where you</p>
<p>could say anything you wanted so</p>
<p>you know those guys they</p>
<p>developed that way you</p>
<p>forget how many people are not into what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what it becomes and that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>the problem</p>
<p>the only problem was that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>commercial artist as well</p>
<p>he does commercials</p>
<p>and that what that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>fucked him they pulled him off of a campaign because</p>
<p>you know look</p>
<p>obviously this is a terrible tragedy</p>
<p>you know and no one&rsquo;s no one&rsquo;s trying to make</p>
<p>light of that no but can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t you both</p>
<p>mourn for the people and</p>
<p>laugh too is that</p>
<p>possible and i was</p>
<p>gonna say this is what i was</p>
<p>gonna say is that</p>
<p>you you know</p>
<p>for the most part i</p>
<p>think in tragedy that&rsquo;s exactly what you need</p>
<p>the last thing somebody is</p>
<p>going through a</p>
<p>tragedy needs is a</p>
<p>bunch of other people acting really somber around that</p>
<p>right and suppressing happiness and</p>
<p>laughter and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying that</p>
<p>you should be</p>
<p>happy that that happened of course not</p>
<p>but shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know shouldn&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>try to be the happiest we can at all times always</p>
<p>absolutely and i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s always room for humor</p>
<p>and it does take some of the sting out of it if you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very soon but</p>
<p>think about how a lot of times you do deal with</p>
<p>with things you</p>
<p>start marking</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually over something by</p>
<p>how easily you can make fun of it</p>
<p>and how easily you can take those</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;re pushing that too</p>
<p>quickly obviously and i</p>
<p>think there is a</p>
<p>time to reflect and be safe</p>
<p>personally i</p>
<p>think but you know i agree</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something to people</p>
<p>about making a joke</p>
<p>about a situation</p>
<p>as to not being</p>
<p>able to feel for the people that are in that situation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s just that god it&rsquo;s so far removed</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s way over there</p>
<p>that he doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think about it he</p>
<p>just says the joke</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i mean i</p>
<p>would never do it and i know you</p>
<p>would never do it but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>comic man that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>do and a good one and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a comic that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>known for saying like the most offensive yeah</p>
<p>like one time</p>
<p>i do every year i do the</p>
<p>doris roberts children</p>
<p>with aids benefit so</p>
<p>we do stand up</p>
<p>kevin james does it sometimes it&rsquo;s a good time</p>
<p>sarah silverman</p>
<p>and we got up and we do</p>
<p>20 minutes in this big thing</p>
<p>and i called gilbert to see if he wanted to do it</p>
<p>and gilbert</p>
<p>gilbert&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great you know and i know him and</p>
<p>he just kept</p>
<p>going fuck the children</p>
<p>and i go no but listen this is a benefit</p>
<p>fuck the children</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not doing whatever</p>
<p>he wouldn&rsquo;t stop saying that</p>
<p>until i fucking</p>
<p>finally had the hang i was like oh fuck so</p>
<p>he seems like when he&rsquo;s on howard</p>
<p>stern that he very rarely has a real conversation</p>
<p>right what if</p>
<p>this would be</p>
<p>funny what if the</p>
<p>same shit happened in</p>
<p>california though listen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right and then he did a joke</p>
<p>about how morning we lost half</p>
<p>our friends you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be totally different no no</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>brian there are guys in</p>
<p>japan and in england</p>
<p>everywhere else that</p>
<p>would be saying i mean</p>
<p>yeah i agree with you that it</p>
<p>would hurt yeah</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with you</p>
<p>that he shouldn&rsquo;t be able to say it no you</p>
<p>should say it but you should</p>
<p>put on your twitter and</p>
<p>openly almost brag like look i&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>fucking edgy</p>
<p>i think he made</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re pushing it in your face like</p>
<p>almost like</p>
<p>i think gilbert</p>
<p>you miscalculated and made an</p>
<p>error and judgment that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>twice he did it</p>
<p>twice or three times he did</p>
<p>three different</p>
<p>tweets he did a</p>
<p>bunch of them</p>
<p>yeah all right he took them down unfortunately i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the mother</p>
<p>on tmz if anyone&rsquo;s looking for him there on</p>
<p>tmz&rsquo;s website i think the</p>
<p>second or third page</p>
<p>i mean you know</p>
<p>i like gilbert and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he means what he says and i</p>
<p>think he was just being a comic</p>
<p>and probably just pushed the envelope a little</p>

<p>so let me read yeah he&rsquo;s really good on jam</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s what will sasso</p>

<p>watched some of</p>
<p>those videos</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so terrible some of</p>
<p>those videos there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the initial</p>
<p>video where it</p>
<p>breaks the wall</p>
<p>and you see</p>
<p>these boats</p>
<p>come over the top of this wall the sea wall and</p>
<p>start smashing through houses</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>whoa man like that is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unbelievable it&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>heavy duty fury and then he realized</p>
<p>how much fucking</p>
<p>water is there out there it&rsquo;s an ocean</p>
<p>god damn it why</p>
<p>would you live so</p>
<p>close to the ocean</p>
<p>you know like i was in malibu this weekend we went to</p>
<p>the there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>place called malibu seafood real</p>
<p>nice place for</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>this is like a good little</p>
<p>fresh seafood</p>
<p>place in malibu</p>
<p>and as we were driving i was looking at all these</p>
<p>houses that are like</p>
<p>right on the beach</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ridiculously expensive</p>
<p>you know for a little tiny ass</p>
<p>house it would be like five six million bucks</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re really expensive you talk</p>
<p>about in malibu</p>
<p>yeah in malibu</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like wait a</p>
<p>minute they&rsquo;re on the beach</p>
<p>like what kind of</p>
<p>trust do you fuckers have i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you got</p>
<p>trust that that shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna stay there</p>
<p>like i remember the</p>
<p>first time i ever</p>
<p>was in a car high</p>
<p>eddie bravo was driving</p>
<p>and we were in redondo beach</p>
<p>and we were</p>
<p>going over this edge of this hill</p>
<p>and i look off to the left hand side and i see the</p>
<p>ocean and it was the</p>
<p>first time it ever</p>
<p>occurred to me</p>
<p>how much fucking</p>
<p>water that is</p>
<p>just sitting</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>what we saw</p>
<p>the japanese thing</p>
<p>was just a little</p>
<p>it was just like it</p>
<p>moved in its</p>
<p>sleep like the ocean</p>
<p>just really amazing was</p>
<p>those videos by the way like the</p>
<p>house is just</p>
<p>i mean incredible</p>
<p>it makes you really realize what</p>
<p>could happen if say there was a</p>
<p>like an asteroid impact or</p>
<p>the canary islands</p>
<p>the east coast has to</p>
<p>worry about the canary islands because</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a volcanic shelf</p>
<p>that if it drops off and it will and it has in the past</p>
<p>drops off into the</p>
<p>ocean it will</p>
<p>cause a fucking</p>
<p>tidal wave that will</p>
<p>drown everyone</p>
<p>a mile in on the east coast</p>
<p>the whole northeast</p>
<p>coast is just gonna get</p>
<p>fucking slammed</p>
<p>with this insane amount of water</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird is that</p>
<p>when i watched that wave come through</p>
<p>i thought the</p>
<p>houses could withstand it sort of i mean they just go</p>
<p>under walk you know what i mean</p>
<p>but instead it got all just</p>
<p>up even like telephone poles got up</p>
<p>the mass of that</p>
<p>water is something i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think pushing</p>
<p>debris yeah</p>
<p>exactly pushing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a huge</p>
<p>like like the</p>
<p>thing like the mob or whatever that that</p>
<p>right right right yeah</p>
<p>yeah absorbs</p>
<p>everything yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>fucking cars in ours</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like a huge like a</p>
<p>meat mush of</p>
<p>stuff and there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much energy behind it i mean didn&rsquo;t they say that the</p>
<p>tsunami wave was</p>
<p>traveling something like 500</p>
<p>miles an hour i</p>
<p>think when once they get an</p>
<p>earthquake on the on the</p>
<p>bottom of the</p>
<p>ocean the ripple</p>
<p>effect can be as fast as 6</p>
<p>so i guess yeah</p>
<p>astronomers i can</p>
<p>start underwater that fast like</p>
<p>fuck man it&rsquo;s just energy i guess</p>
<p>he said it created</p>
<p>a breach that was</p>
<p>or i don&rsquo;t know what the word they used to describe it</p>
<p>but 50 miles wide and</p>
<p>270 miles long</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how much</p>
<p>moved on the bottom of the</p>
<p>earth&rsquo;s surface crazy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>those rogue waves when you&rsquo;re on a cruise</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;ve seen those</p>
<p>sometimes fuck a cruise ship dude fuck that</p>
<p>fuck that i hated when i was on a cruise ship too</p>
<p>that scares the shit out of</p>
<p>me not only that here&rsquo;s what i think</p>
<p>about on cruises</p>
<p>what a perfect way for a maniac to</p>
<p>randomly kill people just</p>
<p>throw people</p>
<p>off the boat</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>jump you off the boat</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;ve been on cruises</p>
<p>at 12 at night nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on that deck and nobody&rsquo;s stopping the boat they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that shit called</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that shit called</p>
<p>where they say that people on boats sometimes like</p>
<p>gaze out into the</p>
<p>ocean and just jump off</p>
<p>for some reason like there&rsquo;s like a term</p>
<p>for it no no no</p>
<p>no they call it like oceans</p>
<p>dream or something like like they get transpired</p>
<p>by it almost</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably i always thought like it&rsquo;s probably doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist that condition is just people getting murdered</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no ocean mermaid kiss</p>
<p>remember in the</p>
<p>odyssey when</p>
<p>odysseus tells the sailors not to look at the sirens</p>
<p>or not to listen to the sirens</p>
<p>cause if you listen to them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll jump in the water and try to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll try to follow them and then you drown</p>
<p>and a lot of the men didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cover up their ears</p>
<p>yeah it was the sirens</p>
<p>and isn&rsquo;t there a celtic myth</p>
<p>about something like that as well</p>

<p>the long end of the story is</p>
<p>chaos all sorts of</p>
<p>things happen he</p>
<p>breaks up with her and then many many years</p>
<p>later how many years</p>
<p>later was it that you saw her walking</p>

<p>walking on the</p>
<p>street about a</p>
<p>year tell the</p>
<p>story keep it</p>
<p>kinda okay okay</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>dl we never name any names</p>
<p>yeah i know no it&rsquo;s just you</p>
<p>dated a hundred methods</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>it could have</p>
<p>been any one of them it used to be my thing</p>
<p>nothing really good comes out of that hole</p>
<p>that whole drug man</p>
<p>if nobody ever said hey i did meth and then</p>
<p>everything worked out yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>problems and i did some meth and</p>
<p>everything just i got a new house</p>
<p>and my body looks great</p>
<p>you know it looks</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s tricky is that adderall stuff</p>
<p>which is kind of like a</p>
<p>speed right</p>
<p>i mean isn&rsquo;t it cocaine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cocaine</p>
<p>is it it&rsquo;s just cocaine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>is it probably that&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>feels like to</p>
<p>me when i did it just felt like i was on cocaine</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s probably because most of the cocaine</p>
<p>you got was cut</p>
<p>with arrow with</p>
<p>speed oh yeah yeah so i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>speed yeah speedy</p>
<p>yeah because</p>
<p>the late great</p>
<p>robert schimmel</p>
<p>god bless him</p>
<p>rest his soul</p>
<p>and all that good</p>
<p>stuff great guy</p>
<p>he he told me once</p>
<p>i ran into him just</p>
<p>randomly he told me</p>
<p>about accidentally taking someone&rsquo;s adderall</p>
<p>he thought it</p>
<p>was something else he thought it was like his</p>
<p>blood pills you know he had a</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>right and he thought it was</p>
<p>a and he had cancer yeah he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>hit a lot of fucking serious health problems</p>
<p>makes makes you</p>
<p>maybe didn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>heart attack</p>
<p>maybe just had cancer</p>
<p>anyway he had some serious health problems and he um</p>
<p>he took this adderall by mistake</p>
<p>and he called his doctors like holy shit i</p>
<p>think i took adderall by mistake what do i do</p>
<p>he said you can&rsquo;t do anything just kick back and</p>
<p>enjoy the ride</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s gonna be with you for the next 12</p>
<p>hours but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fine</p>
<p>he goes for 12</p>
<p>hours i just organized all my notes</p>
<p>he goes i just</p>
<p>started right he goes i got so much shit</p>
<p>done is that what you take it for to be more</p>
<p>clear yeah some people</p>
<p>take it in it like</p>
<p>add people usually take it yeah</p>
<p>buddy mine&rsquo;s on it he&rsquo;s on it all day</p>
<p>you know him too we&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>about it off the air</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s on it all day</p>
<p>he takes it all day</p>
<p>every day he&rsquo;s prescribed by a doctor</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what specifically they said he needed it for but</p>
<p>man he&rsquo;s a fucking workaholic now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that fucking</p>
<p>movie that&rsquo;s coming out with bradley cooper</p>
<p>yeah you know limitless</p>
<p>limitless where you take a pill and all of a</p>
<p>sudden this pill makes you like super focused yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come up with stuff that&rsquo;s adderall bro</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking people on adderall</p>
<p>i found out</p>
<p>about adderall when i was on fear factor</p>
<p>because there was pas</p>
<p>production assistants</p>
<p>and the production assistants</p>
<p>were all like college kids you</p>
<p>know they were</p>
<p>all like doing it like a lot of them were</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re doing it for</p>
<p>you know just getting out of school</p>
<p>first gig and they&rsquo;re doing it you know as</p>
<p>part of their classes</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>about how they</p>
<p>would take adderall</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re in school</p>
<p>so i was like you know kids are taking an adderall</p>
<p>like what are you doing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like oh my god i can&rsquo;t even go to</p>
<p>school without adderall</p>
<p>i was like what</p>
<p>like what are you talking</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s what i thought was interesting</p>
<p>about did you see that documentary bigger faster</p>
<p>stronger yes</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>people say well you&rsquo;re taking steroids</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll be gene doping and all kinds of</p>
<p>things and pretty soon</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have nanotechnology that kind of oxygenates</p>
<p>your blood but</p>
<p>they said you know</p>
<p>steroids are illegal but yet performers can take beta</p>
<p>blockers for</p>
<p>example that actually keep them from getting nervous</p>
<p>the debate really can they really they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowed that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legal well i mean you know</p>
<p>apparently i mean an orchestra</p>
<p>one of the guys was an orchestra</p>
<p>violinist and he takes beta</p>
<p>blockers because it helps him</p>
<p>he otherwise</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get nervous he&rsquo;s much better at playing</p>
<p>the issue is</p>
<p>that is a performance enhancing drug</p>
<p>you could you</p>
<p>could make the argument right</p>
<p>and right but that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the diversity</p>
<p>violins and steroids</p>
<p>pretty well</p>
<p>but it brings into question</p>
<p>but but but the debate still is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re both performance enhancing</p>
<p>drugs one make sure muscular because that&rsquo;s what was</p>
<p>required in your</p>
<p>particular endeavor</p>
<p>right whereas the other</p>
<p>makes you focused</p>
<p>you know your fingers are more</p>
<p>relaxed whatever it might be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just an interesting debate you got</p>
<p>where do you draw the line</p>
<p>i say personal freedom is</p>
<p>where you draw the line</p>
<p>i think you</p>
<p>should be able to do whatever</p>
<p>you want to do if you want to take adderall and</p>
<p>write books all day good for you</p>
<p>why would i give</p>
<p>individuals the choice</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when</p>
<p>bloomberg in new york</p>
<p>mayor bloomberg</p>
<p>made restaurants were not allowed to</p>
<p>provide foods that had</p>
<p>trans fats i believe i don&rsquo;t know if that</p>
<p>law went through but that was the that was the what</p>
<p>exactly are</p>
<p>trans fats i</p>
<p>think trans</p>
<p>fats with penises no i think</p>
<p>just knocked it out of the park</p>
<p>there it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s here folks</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a partially</p>
<p>i think a partially</p>
<p>hydrogenated</p>
<p>oil something</p>
<p>whatever it is it&rsquo;s not good but delicious</p>
<p>you know what man i want to be able to eat not</p>
<p>good but delicious in terms</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make a trans fat illegal let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make up two things let&rsquo;s take white flour and</p>
<p>sugar how about</p>
<p>fucking cigarettes man yeah</p>
<p>before they even</p>
<p>touch that where do you draw the line that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah white flour and</p>
<p>sugar make some delicious donuts that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you draw the line now if you eat too many of them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get diabetes</p>
<p>but give me a break you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna make it</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you gotta figure out</p>
<p>where to draw the line you make people weaker</p>
<p>people should be able to make their own choices</p>
<p>based on the information</p>
<p>that they can and nowadays everybody can get</p>
<p>information i&rsquo;m always amazed that so many people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spend more time taking a look at what they put in</p>
<p>their bodies but</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>worry about like</p>
<p>access to children this is like the big</p>
<p>worry yeah yeah i hear that</p>
<p>about adults but what</p>
<p>about my kids i</p>
<p>want my kids to</p>
<p>worry it&rsquo;s never been</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never not been a worry</p>
<p>that the answer to that is not to take away</p>
<p>adults ability to choose</p>
<p>things for themselves</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make the</p>
<p>world a safer</p>
<p>place you want to try to make the</p>
<p>world a safer place</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take one example</p>
<p>lower the speed</p>
<p>limit to 36</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll save lives</p>
<p>i can measure that for you mathematically</p>
<p>you want to</p>
<p>lower the speed</p>
<p>limit no we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have it</p>
<p>at 55 65 because that&rsquo;s the way life that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the pace life moves at</p>
<p>and by the way people die at that pace</p>
<p>but nobody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna slow down</p>
<p>cause the slow down</p>
<p>is ready not worth it</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re putting a</p>
<p>price on human life</p>
<p>which we do</p>
<p>every single day as a society</p>
<p>and we have to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting way to put it you</p>
<p>could spend more</p>
<p>money on airlines you could</p>
<p>spend actually more</p>
<p>money to really really</p>
<p>triple safeguard</p>
<p>planes you could actually do it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it</p>
<p>because price</p>
<p>for everybody</p>
<p>would go up</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fly that way</p>
<p>we make these decisions subconsciously and consciously</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>my friend johnny used to said</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they put a big parachute at the top of the</p>
<p>plane right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like such a</p>
<p>smart thing</p>
<p>great i thought</p>
<p>about that i&rsquo;m like god damn it that&rsquo;s like some</p>
<p>genius shit</p>
<p>right why don&rsquo;t they nobody even talks</p>
<p>about it no i like when they find that</p>
<p>when they find that black box</p>
<p>i was like why don&rsquo;t they just make the whole</p>
<p>plane made out of the same shit did this</p>
<p>that was hacking 87 it sure was</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they at least give you parachutes per</p>
<p>you know like underneath your seat just in case of you</p>
<p>just last you&rsquo;re fucked anyway bro that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>500 miles now</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t fall out of the sky usually most</p>
<p>plane crashes happen on takeoff and landing</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s so you&rsquo;re a pair of parachutes are not</p>
<p>gonna do shit it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re in the air and the</p>
<p>what you need is some sort of</p>
<p>adamantanium</p>
<p>the shit that wolverine&rsquo;s bones is made out of</p>
<p>right like a</p>
<p>shield that you put around you on impact what</p>
<p>matter because in fact the percussion your brain was</p>
<p>maybe you maybe you</p>
<p>or just my brain would be fine bro</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just a huge shot of heroin with bubbles and stuff</p>
<p>i got padding in my</p>
<p>brain maybe you bro whatever joe&rsquo;s getting competitive</p>
<p>with you he&rsquo;s getting competitive</p>
<p>who can take more impact this is just a</p>
<p>stupid conversation</p>
<p>i hate this podcast</p>
<p>yeah last night when i was</p>
<p>strumming and went outside and looking at the stars</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sherooming is the most fucking amazing</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>whole entire</p>
<p>world they were just</p>
<p>pulsating you</p>
<p>sound like you&rsquo;re riding a dolphin</p>
<p>right now dude</p>
<p>with a unicorn</p>
<p>blowing him</p>
<p>and over a lot</p>
<p>right now right</p>
<p>now unicorns licking his ass always got</p>
<p>hay around his asshole all the unicorns look at</p>
<p>as i frolic through</p>
<p>i want to shure</p>
<p>him every day</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s good for you bro</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what happened to the mayans that&rsquo;s my latest</p>
<p>i have this bit</p>
<p>about the mayans</p>
<p>but the mayans you</p>
<p>know the reason why they came up with this end of the</p>
<p>world shit see</p>
<p>they were fucking doing mushrooms and like staring at</p>
<p>space all day</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a certain amount of mushrooms you</p>
<p>should stop at</p>
<p>and then whatever the fuck the mayans did</p>
<p>cause they disappeared</p>
<p>you know the people the mayan people are</p>
<p>still there that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>when i went to chichen itza i went</p>
<p>and went on the tour of the ruins and</p>
<p>everything like that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people there that look like</p>
<p>those mayan</p>
<p>sculptures there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people there that have</p>
<p>those mayan features and they&rsquo;re really tiny people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really bizarre</p>
<p>so the mayans it&rsquo;s not like they all died off</p>
<p>but whatever the fuck they were doing was so crazy</p>
<p>that it got to a</p>
<p>point with human sacrifices</p>
<p>the whole thing just fell</p>
<p>apart you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>human sacrifice i&rsquo;d call that pretty</p>
<p>crazy and raiding</p>
<p>other villages and</p>
<p>might have been a lot of it</p>
<p>might have been that they were just</p>
<p>getting fucked up on mushrooms all the time and just</p>
<p>going to war on mushrooms and we know the vikings</p>
<p>went to war on mushrooms</p>
<p>they would become</p>
<p>berserks the scots they</p>
<p>call them berserks yeah i don&rsquo;t know what mushroom they</p>
<p>took i&rsquo;m sure someone on twitter will tell us but i</p>
<p>think it was the amanita muscaria</p>
<p>which is the one that&rsquo;s linked to siberia and</p>
<p>santa claus</p>
<p>and cause they</p>
<p>would get naked</p>
<p>they would get</p>
<p>naked and they say they&rsquo;d cry blood</p>
<p>yeah well you</p>
<p>know listen man if you fucking put yourself on the</p>
<p>right mixture</p>
<p>you know and you</p>
<p>gotta go to war you put yourself on some</p>
<p>crazy i do it next dimension mixture</p>
<p>you know you have to go to war</p>
<p>we think of war as something to be</p>
<p>avoided but when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re living in 1 ad</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no avoiding it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s dudes with</p>
<p>swords and they&rsquo;re coming on</p>
<p>horses and we</p>
<p>gotta get a</p>
<p>spear and the</p>
<p>weird thing is</p>
<p>the way they</p>
<p>would fight is that</p>
<p>like the way</p>
<p>they would fight i always</p>
<p>think about this if i was in the front</p>
<p>line you want me to charge into all that all</p>
<p>those blades</p>
<p>and just fight like that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be waiting i want to be the sniper</p>
<p>wanna be the there was no</p>
<p>avoiding that</p>
<p>that shit happened i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>learn the bow and</p>
<p>arrow quick</p>
<p>yeah but even that man eventually someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna run up on you and hack your leg off</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bad way to die what a</p>
<p>crazy way to go to war</p>
<p>those fucking</p>
<p>braveheart movies but</p>
<p>you know what you have</p>
<p>two armies they meet across a</p>
<p>field and they just run at each</p>
<p>other i know</p>
<p>did they really rock it like that</p>
<p>i hope not i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>done that at</p>
<p>least they had anesthesia and antibiotics back then</p>
<p>right i wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>stopped them</p>
<p>finchers i would have stopped to bend over to tie my</p>
<p>metal shoelaces</p>
<p>do you know how sucky it was to live back then</p>
<p>you died of</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>tetanus diphtheria</p>
<p>whooping cough</p>
<p>smallpox how about</p>
<p>starvation and</p>
<p>animal attacks</p>
<p>starvation animal attacks</p>
<p>other other like</p>
<p>countries coming in and</p>
<p>going hey we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna kill you and enslave your kids and rape your</p>
<p>wives you know what people have forgotten</p>
<p>about man wolves</p>
<p>cause all this talk</p>
<p>like we gotta save the wolf</p>
<p>the wolf are amazing majestic</p>
<p>creatures yeah</p>
<p>wolves used to eat fucking kids man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason why all</p>
<p>these little red riding hood with that</p>
<p>movie that i saw all these</p>
<p>three little pigs you</p>
<p>reason why there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wolves in all</p>
<p>these children&rsquo;s doors</p>
<p>cause wolves</p>
<p>would fucking eat your kids</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out there man</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>stronger and bigger</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about the wolf pack in siberia or</p>
<p>somewhere in the soviet union</p>
<p>performance or</p>
<p>wherever you</p>
<p>know russia</p>
<p>whatever it&rsquo;s called oh they</p>
<p>found meat 400</p>
<p>they found meat</p>
<p>they had found bear</p>
<p>dna in their feces they were killing bears right</p>
<p>well no that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>a pack of super</p>
<p>wolves there was 400</p>
<p>wolves in this russian town</p>
<p>and they were killing</p>
<p>horses they were ganging up because it got so cold</p>
<p>apparently that all the animals that they prey on died</p>
<p>so they started</p>
<p>breaking into</p>
<p>places and killing horses</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s 400 of them acting as a super pact</p>
<p>first of all living in siberia in the wintertime</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s siberia</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somewhere obviously incredibly cold in alaska</p>
<p>because everything died</p>
<p>everything froze to death</p>
<p>this has been a lot of</p>
<p>freezing to</p>
<p>death lately man</p>
<p>or in vietnam</p>
<p>7 000 fucking</p>
<p>i think was</p>
<p>oxen oxen or</p>
<p>some wild cow or something or</p>
<p>whatever the fuck it was but 7 000</p>
<p>large animals died</p>
<p>wow with all</p>
<p>these massive die offs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>this year i mean all of them together i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>any die offs</p>
<p>i think they</p>
<p>always happen i</p>
<p>think you think so</p>
<p>yeah i think in nature you</p>
<p>always have diabs and by the way you also always have</p>
<p>viruses that come in and wipe out for example</p>
<p>wild dog of africa</p>
<p>that dog you</p>
<p>know a lot of from what i&rsquo;ve read and seen i believe</p>
<p>they get one of them gets distemper</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>whole pack dies you</p>
<p>know they just</p>
<p>spread it back and forth i had a dog that had distemper</p>
<p>it was scary as</p>
<p>fuck yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary at a rescue dog he was a doberman</p>
<p>and he was real sweet</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden out of nowhere man he just</p>
<p>started snapping at me and</p>
<p>growling at me and i was a little kid i was like 11</p>
<p>one of the great</p>
<p>things we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>as human beings in the 20th century is</p>
<p>really checked most</p>
<p>pathogens most diseases like that</p>
<p>we have come up with</p>
<p>an ability to really make them slim to vanishing in our</p>
<p>everyday lives</p>
<p>when was the</p>
<p>last time you knew anybody who died of a disease</p>
<p>and if you read any kind of</p>
<p>literature any</p>
<p>literature pick up any book</p>
<p>from even 1948</p>
<p>even if you</p>
<p>watch plays</p>
<p>there was always</p>
<p>everybody had</p>
<p>dealt with different kinds of plague whether it was</p>
<p>influenza in this in</p>
<p>the worldwide</p>
<p>influenza that hit this country</p>
<p>very very hard</p>
<p>in the 20s or</p>
<p>or polio which put</p>
<p>countless children thousands of children</p>
<p>on iron lungs they died and then they lost</p>
<p>their ability to walk</p>
<p>and our own president</p>
<p>i mean our own president of the united</p>
<p>states got polio</p>
<p>and was in a</p>
<p>wheelchair now</p>
<p>think about that you know</p>
<p>when he was governor of new york</p>
<p>theodore roosevelt i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>franklin roosevelt was you know</p>
<p>i think he was governor of new york yeah</p>
<p>but he was basically</p>
<p>walking and</p>
<p>standing and then he got polio</p>
<p>when he was at the height of his power</p>
<p>and at the height of his</p>
<p>power is when he caught it yeah</p>
<p>yeah then he became president</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>doubt that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the safest time to live ever there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been a time like this</p>
<p>you know with all the violence that we have</p>
<p>think of the</p>
<p>population the population has dramatically increased</p>
<p>when people say well</p>
<p>things aren&rsquo;t like they were in the 70s</p>
<p>motherfucker do you know how</p>
<p>many more people there are than they were in the 70s</p>
<p>in the 70s there</p>
<p>was probably only 3 billion people in the</p>
<p>world or something</p>
<p>but we also have</p>
<p>what the other</p>
<p>thing is amazing is we&rsquo;ve figured out ways to harness</p>
<p>food like you know</p>
<p>india wide swaths of</p>
<p>india and southeast asia and</p>
<p>especially like china</p>
<p>went through terrible</p>
<p>famines and</p>
<p>never had enough to eat and a lot of that a lot of that</p>
<p>stuff is a memory</p>
<p>thank god it seems to me though that</p>
<p>these things are happening much more</p>
<p>frequently i</p>
<p>would like to</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s just because of our access</p>
<p>to information that we have with the internet and</p>
<p>twitter and all</p>
<p>these things so we find out</p>
<p>about disasters</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in chile</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>china whether it&rsquo;s in new zealand</p>
<p>we find out</p>
<p>about them in real time</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t buy that man i feel like there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>i mean i guess someone</p>
<p>should do the research or</p>
<p>maybe someone</p>
<p>already has and i just need to find the site but</p>
<p>i think more</p>
<p>things are happening now than i can ever remember but i</p>
<p>think i think i&rsquo;m trying to be objective no i</p>
<p>understand but i</p>
<p>think we all have a tendency</p>
<p>as human beings also number one to</p>
<p>first of all i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s ever been</p>
<p>a time in history</p>
<p>when people</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t predicting</p>
<p>the end of our race sure</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>first century</p>
<p>the first century&rsquo;s pharisees i mean you know and</p>
<p>or the essenes i mean that the</p>
<p>in the bible that&rsquo;s what they talk</p>
<p>about they were apocryphal you know yeah and and</p>
<p>that is that is so</p>
<p>much a part of our nature i</p>
<p>think not only to always</p>
<p>imagine disaster and</p>
<p>prepare for disaster</p>
<p>but to predict</p>
<p>disaster and i</p>
<p>think that the one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s for sure is that you will always deal with</p>
<p>these what they call</p>
<p>black swans these</p>
<p>sort of aberrations</p>
<p>that come out of nowhere and take the whole</p>
<p>chess board</p>
<p>and throw it</p>
<p>the air and that is as much</p>
<p>about the human</p>
<p>experience as</p>
<p>anything else</p>
<p>and i think that if you</p>
<p>always keep in mind that all this can be</p>
<p>taken away from you</p>
<p>or can change you</p>
<p>or can throw your</p>
<p>what what your your</p>
<p>whole contract that you came to this</p>
<p>table with in</p>
<p>rip it to shreds you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a problem no one&rsquo;s read that contract</p>
<p>this is the real problem with</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>we all just</p>
<p>exist and we don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think about what the fuck is</p>
<p>truly going on</p>
<p>until something nutty happened that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right and by the way remember a lot of</p>
<p>psychiatrists will tell you that all of us come to the</p>
<p>table with a contract</p>
<p>like we all</p>
<p>make deals with ourselves we say if i work really hard</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna get this job</p>
<p>if i work really hard i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get famous</p>
<p>i work really hard</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll make a lot of money</p>
<p>and a lot of times</p>
<p>life doesn&rsquo;t work that way for a</p>
<p>whole myriad</p>
<p>of reasons a lot of times by the</p>
<p>way it&rsquo;s because people aren&rsquo;t honest with themselves</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t realize what they&rsquo;re actually good at</p>
<p>versus what they want to be good at</p>
<p>we see that a lot with acting and all</p>
<p>these things but i</p>
<p>think you see it everywhere</p>
<p>but at the end of the day most of us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>interesting the social scientists because they&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>a lot of times we have a contract</p>
<p>come to the</p>
<p>table and we say this</p>
<p>is what happens we get</p>
<p>older it doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>but human beings</p>
<p>are also really really good at creating what they call</p>
<p>synthetic happiness</p>
<p>they can they can assess what they got now</p>
<p>versus what they did want</p>
<p>and they realized</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t work out and then they&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>start to really love what they like</p>
<p>this social scientist did a really interesting</p>
<p>study between people who won the lottery</p>
<p>and then people who became</p>
<p>paraplegics</p>
<p>and he measured</p>
<p>their sort of happiness on a</p>
<p>broad sort of scale</p>
<p>a year later and</p>
<p>found that they were both in the same place</p>
<p>because the people in a</p>
<p>wheelchair had done such a good job</p>
<p>of embracing</p>
<p>their new reality</p>
<p>and that just means a lottery</p>
<p>winners are retards</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all that well yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying but it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>but you got no if you won the lottery dude you&rsquo;d be way</p>
<p>happier than you&rsquo;d be in if you were in a wheelchair</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>idiot well but i&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>human beings human</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more a comment on the people in the</p>
<p>wheelchair yeah who are able to come</p>
<p>what i was saying man when i was saying</p>
<p>that the people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t exactly</p>
<p>aware of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here&rsquo;s the deal we live in a society</p>
<p>that was collected</p>
<p>over the course of hundreds of years of innovation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s created</p>
<p>off the work of millions of people that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never met and all</p>
<p>their combined</p>
<p>efforts and discoveries</p>
<p>have allowed</p>
<p>you to live this really simple and easy life</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re all doing</p>
<p>and we are all raising children</p>
<p>with the same</p>
<p>ignorance that we have</p>
<p>about what this is all</p>
<p>about in this country in this country in all countries</p>
<p>no one knows what the next</p>
<p>stage of this</p>
<p>existence is well i</p>
<p>think for example if you look at</p>
<p>india and you look at</p>
<p>china and especially</p>
<p>india india is</p>
<p>becoming a real hotbed of</p>
<p>innovation and</p>
<p>those kids work</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re slaves</p>
<p>no they work</p>
<p>i call them when my dell computer</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>smart and a lot of that</p>
<p>innovation is coming out of india</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure there is man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure it is what i&rsquo;m saying what i&rsquo;m getting at is</p>
<p>no one has earned this life that we live</p>
<p>right now no one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alive has it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>collective effort</p>
<p>but as individuals</p>
<p>very few of us</p>
<p>are even putting into perspective</p>
<p>normal things like our own mortality</p>
<p>the mortality of</p>
<p>our very climate</p>
<p>the mortality of the</p>
<p>structure and the</p>
<p>shape of the continent i</p>
<p>think because</p>
<p>in a lot of ways we&rsquo;re more comfortable</p>
<p>today than we ever have been plenty to eat</p>
<p>you can go away</p>
<p>from biology</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>these diseases you don&rsquo;t even really have to worry</p>
<p>about war for the most part that&rsquo;s new in our country</p>
<p>remember in</p>
<p>2011 if you take even 1985</p>
<p>half the world was</p>
<p>under communist</p>
<p>dictatorships</p>
<p>who had their missiles</p>
<p>pointed directly at our</p>
<p>major cities</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist anymore there really is for all intents</p>
<p>and purposes</p>
<p>one superpower one military</p>
<p>superpower in the world</p>
<p>and russia is no longer a threat</p>
<p>think about that</p>
<p>we now have nato most of the</p>
<p>eastern european</p>
<p>countries that</p>
<p>were our enemies are actually part of nato now</p>
<p>who do you talk</p>
<p>about north</p>
<p>korea and iran</p>
<p>may be significant to an extent</p>
<p>but certainly nothing like the threat that the soviet</p>
<p>union was so i</p>
<p>think people you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right i think people for the most part</p>
<p>are a lot more</p>
<p>relaxed and</p>
<p>feeling a lot more secure</p>
<p>everything is better now people are</p>
<p>smarter now people are nicer now people are more</p>
<p>aware and informed now they&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>aware of their own mental and</p>
<p>psychological problems we&rsquo;re fatter now</p>
<p>bigger asses now the</p>
<p>question becomes</p>
<p>the question becomes what&rsquo;s the amount like</p>
<p>how much discomfort do you have to</p>
<p>experience to be great</p>
<p>cause i think</p>
<p>greatness does come out</p>
<p>to a large extent out of</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come out of comfort and luxury i</p>
<p>think it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem like it</p>
<p>does but sometimes it can just come out of discipline</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re struggling that discipline</p>
<p>if you can be the type of person really</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>living a terrible life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right good</p>
<p>stuff you know you</p>
<p>could be living a</p>
<p>great life as long as you&rsquo;re disciplined and you really</p>
<p>tune yourself into it as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right yeah you know but you were talking i thought</p>
<p>i had a thought you were talking about how</p>
<p>you know genetics suck and pretty soon you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to kind of choose our genetics</p>
<p>but the question becomes</p>
<p>you know i think of myself what</p>
<p>would happen</p>
<p>well but the problem with that is that so much</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m worried that we&rsquo;d lose our</p>
<p>color cause so much of what i</p>
<p>do and what drives</p>
<p>me worried really</p>
<p>is it white</p>
<p>color no no</p>
<p>no no color like</p>
<p>color flavor flavor oh</p>
<p>nice recovery</p>
<p>not color i mean like our flavor our i think</p>
<p>because because because so much of what we do</p>
<p>so much of what i do what drives me</p>
<p>is that i&rsquo;m compensating</p>
<p>for my inadequacies or my perceived inadequacies</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>worked out that&rsquo;s why i did martial arts that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>wrestle i felt like i was</p>
<p>sort of but it&rsquo;s always from the</p>
<p>childhood wow the</p>
<p>place that a performer comes from yeah me too and</p>
<p>you know and everyone we know everyone we know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>comic there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m saying is in some ways god</p>
<p>bless a dysfunctional</p>
<p>childhood yeah</p>
<p>and no because you&rsquo;re one of a hundred that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a hundred like you that</p>
<p>smashed on the rocks on the way up to the top of the</p>
<p>cliff you managed to bite through vines with your</p>
<p>teeth and get to the top and you took a deep breath</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to be okay and neither did i anyone with a fucked up</p>
<p>childhood like the idea of</p>
<p>encouraging a fucked up</p>
<p>child to create an interesting</p>
<p>child no no no</p>
<p>really i mean that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re saying but the</p>
<p>trick of life</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the trick of life</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>trick of life to turn</p>
<p>to turn that</p>
<p>which is bad into something good yes it is the</p>
<p>trick but some people fail at that</p>
<p>trick and then we have criminals wandering through the</p>
<p>streets that are dangerous and emotionally different</p>
<p>human beings it&rsquo;s very easy to destroy a</p>
<p>human being yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not hard at all man just</p>
<p>raise them terrible</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like some feral</p>
<p>child in russia you hear</p>
<p>about raised by dogs you know like holy fuck</p>
<p>you just stop and think</p>
<p>about it like what the fuck</p>
<p>that kid&rsquo;s been eating dead birds and shit well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about getting raised by dogs but like poodles</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s so weird</p>
<p>about contemplating like disaster like the one in japan</p>
<p>any disaster any</p>
<p>anything has a ripple effect</p>
<p>and and the</p>
<p>crazy thing is that</p>
<p>that sometimes</p>
<p>to one person&rsquo;s loss is another person&rsquo;s opportunity</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>dance that constantly goes back and forth and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one side something terrible happens</p>
<p>and it opens up a whole new</p>
<p>world and opportunity for a</p>
<p>whole other</p>
<p>group of people</p>
<p>you know whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>somebody opens a</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>a company that provides</p>
<p>quake relief</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s employed 60 people who can feed</p>
<p>their kids whatever the case</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s just this constant dance man</p>
<p>and whenever you try to pinpoint</p>
<p>or treat life like it&rsquo;s a noun</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>trouble and by the way your relationships are a verb</p>
<p>everything is a verb</p>
<p>yeah everything is always moving</p>
<p>everything is in flux</p>
<p>yeah you are too</p>
<p>you know everything</p>
<p>is the whole</p>
<p>thing is there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>static but that&rsquo;s what everybody looks</p>
<p>for that&rsquo;s the problem with the contract everybody</p>
<p>looks for that</p>
<p>golden years</p>
<p>they look for that moment</p>
<p>where they can stop</p>
<p>no man i think that</p>
<p>i think if you keep growing</p>
<p>and you keep yourself</p>
<p>so you keep surprising and</p>
<p>shocking yourself and</p>
<p>maybe even scaring yourself</p>
<p>which is hard to do but you if you</p>
<p>sound like an actress</p>
<p>right now to</p>
<p>sing a song to</p>
<p>my song you</p>
<p>sound like some new</p>
<p>chick the next</p>
<p>blockbuster</p>
<p>no way the fuck out</p>
<p>of me i am beautiful</p>
<p>the worst earthquake</p>
<p>you know everyone&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about what gilbert gottfried said</p>
<p>no one is no one said dumber shit than what sharon</p>
<p>stone said well</p>
<p>after the chinese earthquake</p>
<p>you remember that</p>
<p>she said maybe you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m friends with the dalai lama</p>
<p>you know maybe this</p>
<p>earthquake in</p>
<p>china is karma because they&rsquo;re of the terrible</p>
<p>things they&rsquo;ve done for tibet</p>
<p>wow i remember that what like</p>
<p>you think innocent people thousands of them</p>
<p>thanks a lot sharon</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an act</p>
<p>crushed by rocks</p>
<p>all that you know and she&rsquo;s a name</p>
<p>dropping little twat</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m friends with the dalai</p>
<p>lama i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure he</p>
<p>thinks about you all the time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure when</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing his montras he&rsquo;s like sharon</p>
<p>stone sharon stone</p>
<p>you know sharon</p>
<p>you know the girl who</p>
<p>basic instincts</p>
<p>actresses etc</p>
<p>no excuse me you mean the girl from</p>
<p>above the law the</p>
<p>steven seagal</p>
<p>debut movie all actors including me look</p>
<p>the fact that we worship actors is the funniest</p>
<p>thing in the way if an</p>
<p>alien came down they&rsquo;d be like wait a</p>
<p>minute you&rsquo;re worshipping</p>
<p>these people who are</p>
<p>basically good at being emotionally available</p>
<p>and pretending</p>
<p>is that really something that it&rsquo;s a skill</p>
<p>it tells a good</p>
<p>story what&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>impressive that or golf golf golf</p>
<p>golf takes a lifetime</p>
<p>yeah but i like</p>
<p>movies and tiger woods probably can&rsquo;t act fuck golf</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man because</p>
<p>i think both are equally ridiculous</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always said that it&rsquo;s one of the funniest</p>
<p>things in the</p>
<p>world that people</p>
<p>think that a guy&rsquo;s a hero</p>
<p>because he hits a ball into a hole in the ground yeah</p>
<p>but you know what i like</p>
<p>about golf it seems so silly but</p>
<p>i like about any</p>
<p>competition like golf or any game</p>
<p>is that it requires</p>
<p>when you want to win at that game it requires you to</p>
<p>basically do all that</p>
<p>self examination</p>
<p>you gotta face up to all your obstacles</p>
<p>you gotta deal with your performance</p>
<p>anxiety you know how it is to try to get better you</p>
<p>see minors to</p>
<p>choke that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point of competition i probably</p>
<p>would love golf that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m terrified of it</p>
<p>but i play cool</p>
<p>you know dude</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever pick up a golf</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever take</p>
<p>gulf i&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>i know how you</p>
<p>won never say</p>
<p>never i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to i won&rsquo;t play</p>
<p>chess either</p>
<p>for the same reason but</p>
<p>for those of you guys</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know this</p>
<p>about joe rogan</p>
<p>i always said most of the public actually</p>
<p>knows very little about joe</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>he can draw really well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a notch below pro pool</p>
<p>player he is he is</p>
<p>he knows more</p>
<p>about pool and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s actually a really good</p>
<p>draftsman you can draw like really really well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i wanted to do when i was in high school</p>
<p>before i got into martial arts</p>
<p>i mean but what was</p>
<p>your comic book you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>great marsh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a real martial</p>
<p>artist you&rsquo;d be a nightmare to fight</p>
<p>you can draw really well</p>
<p>and you um i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>short balding</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re short balding you hum</p>
<p>like a donkey</p>
<p>my asshole&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never clean are you not wearing pants</p>
<p>i was that dirt</p>
<p>underneath my fingers</p>
<p>but wait there was a</p>
<p>point i was making and i&rsquo;m too high to remember damn it</p>
<p>pool playing games oh yes</p>
<p>but the problem is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re so intense that once you pick something up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that game</p>
<p>quake when you played for 50s</p>
<p>and passed out</p>
<p>as you were leaving your</p>
<p>he drags me to</p>
<p>store and he&rsquo;s getting these</p>
<p>handles and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like 30</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>his handles and all these like</p>
<p>weird things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s and i was like what are you doing what&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these what are</p>
<p>these grips and</p>
<p>stuff he goes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for quake i&rsquo;m playing somebody in sweden tomorrow</p>
<p>i will crush him</p>
<p>i was like whatever with a thousand yard stare dude</p>
<p>you play connect to</p>
<p>you you have no idea how</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this in the podcast way too many times but</p>
<p>quake is too fun</p>
<p>quake is even more involving than pool</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t allow myself</p>
<p>to those games because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re too good now like years of war like we</p>
<p>cliffy b put up epic games put up the</p>
<p>unreal 3 engine</p>
<p>the new engine</p>
<p>they put up a demo</p>
<p>fucking hey</p>
<p>man it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it looks real it looks like a fucking</p>
<p>movie man it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>i do this joke now about</p>
<p>about how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting wars now like that you know like what yeah</p>
<p>and stuff guys in nevada and florida think</p>
<p>about that you&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>75 000 miles away but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>video game and you&rsquo;re actually taking life</p>
<p>you wonder what that does to you psychologically</p>
<p>when you come home and you&rsquo;re eating dinner but</p>
<p>my joke was like in 20 years the war hero is not</p>
<p>gonna be the grizzled</p>
<p>guy with the shaved head and the scars he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the chubby dude with huge</p>
<p>thumb muscles</p>
<p>who smells like doritos weed</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>well that was the</p>
<p>movie starfighter remember</p>
<p>the movie where the kid had to get really good at a</p>
<p>video game and</p>
<p>when he got good at it they came down and took him to</p>
<p>fight in the galaxy that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be well</p>
<p>these pakistan drone</p>
<p>things are fucking frightening because it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>great area too it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re not really in pakistan</p>
<p>we are in the sky</p>
<p>above pakistan</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no one in the plane</p>
<p>and and you don&rsquo;t hear it yeah</p>
<p>when i was in afghanistan i</p>
<p>watch those things</p>
<p>taken off all the time i was like look at that thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>manned it just takes off dude hell fire missiles</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you need to know</p>
<p>what are you doing bro see this</p>
<p>cliffvb&rsquo;s epic games</p>
<p>infinity blade video game</p>
<p>they go through</p>
<p>they go through like that hellfire missile i</p>
<p>think i believe somebody told me</p>
<p>can go through like a foot of</p>
<p>steel or something</p>
<p>like a foot of</p>
<p>steel the idea behind it is so</p>
<p>crazy that you can just</p>
<p>pilot something from halfway across the</p>
<p>world in real time</p>
<p>trust it to just</p>
<p>you pull the</p>
<p>trigger it&rsquo;s only the beginning how much of a</p>
<p>delay is the lag there has to be some lag</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t know you can actually</p>
<p>watch that on the internet because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big thing</p>
<p>about playing online when you play online it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about your ping</p>
<p>and if you have like</p>
<p>one ping or two ping like you&rsquo;re in the server you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>local to the</p>
<p>server anymore though ping isn&rsquo;t internet</p>
<p>like so fast no</p>
<p>it makes a big</p>
<p>difference ping is in</p>
<p>milliseconds it</p>
<p>absolutely matters</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>guy with a higher ping than you can</p>
<p>still beat you</p>
<p>but you definitely have an advantage when you&rsquo;re local</p>
<p>like say if</p>
<p>this is like say if we set up a server in my</p>
<p>house right</p>
<p>and i set up</p>
<p>a server and i&rsquo;m here connected to the machine</p>
<p>but other people have</p>
<p>to connect and get the information through the internet</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re paying say if they&rsquo;re down the</p>
<p>block at the lowest they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get is</p>
<p>maybe a 10 this is back in the day i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changed you</p>
<p>get like 10 ping if you&rsquo;re lucky</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re in sweden</p>
<p>or somewhere like that</p>
<p>no doubt about it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a</p>
<p>slight delay it</p>
<p>might be 150</p>
<p>milliseconds</p>
<p>might be 200</p>
<p>milliseconds</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be a full second</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unbearable you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>250 milliseconds is</p>
<p>where it gets squirrely</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t really what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird about this is a</p>
<p>human reaction</p>
<p>can get to the</p>
<p>point where you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like you can barely measure it like when they do</p>
<p>sprinting you know how the olympics you</p>
<p>know when they</p>
<p>shoot the gun they</p>
<p>shoot a gun</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s for effect</p>
<p>they actually if you&rsquo;re running the 100 like usain bolt</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a race</p>
<p>they have that</p>
<p>they shoot that</p>
<p>sound off behind you why</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got to</p>
<p>reach all the guys at the same time you shoot</p>
<p>it like this the guy at the end is the last to hear</p>
<p>about it and they&rsquo;re so fast off the</p>
<p>blocks that</p>
<p>the other guys</p>
<p>already already</p>
<p>gonna win the race</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t hear it in time so they</p>
<p>found that when they shot back in the day they&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>shooting it here</p>
<p>the guy closest to gun</p>
<p>would always have this advantage</p>
<p>and so now and even when they send that</p>
<p>sound off now behind these guys</p>
<p>the problem is the</p>
<p>sound dissipates to here</p>
<p>so it starts you know</p>
<p>you gotta have it you</p>
<p>gotta have it have it originate somewhere</p>
<p>how do you get it to all of them at the</p>
<p>exact same second</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re so fast off the blocks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually giving the guy</p>
<p>who hears it first</p>
<p>an advantage</p>
<p>and they win</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like the guy</p>
<p>and check this out</p>
<p>you know the difference between</p>
<p>fourth place and</p>
<p>first place in the downhill ski event was</p>
<p>in in you know</p>
<p>whatever it was</p>
<p>it was two blinks of an eye</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>is it ready</p>
<p>gold gold gold</p>
<p>nothing gold</p>
<p>nothing whoa</p>
<p>nothing that&rsquo;s fucking nuts that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>swimmers trim</p>
<p>their fingernails</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i mean don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they try to keep</p>
<p>their fingernails long</p>
<p>why the act is like little paddles no so that you can</p>
<p>touch because it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re dealing with hundreds of a</p>
<p>second what</p>
<p>yeah they grow</p>
<p>pimp nails you</p>
<p>try to it&rsquo;s all computerized the minute you</p>
<p>touch that the</p>
<p>minute you touch</p>
<p>that so if you were</p>
<p>built like kusamar palhara as you&rsquo;d be a terrible</p>
<p>swimmer because you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to have that big reach</p>
<p>those guys are albatrosses</p>
<p>my green nails</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking fast so that&rsquo;s how fast</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>okay let me ask you this</p>
<p>how many of</p>
<p>those guys do you</p>
<p>think are doping</p>
<p>how many of</p>
<p>those guys in</p>
<p>olympic competition i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s possible to compete in a lot of</p>
<p>olympic sports without doping and without doing drugs</p>
<p>yeah like cycling</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way why do you</p>
<p>think all of them why do you</p>
<p>think all of them get caught all of them</p>
<p>the biggest it&rsquo;s the biggest joe i mean you know but</p>
<p>but but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going after</p>
<p>lance armstrong bro i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>after him this is</p>
<p>which is weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they get him online</p>
<p>which is a very strange thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like wait a</p>
<p>minute if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put people in jail for lying</p>
<p>how about most of the government</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand a lie nobody ever</p>
<p>went to jail</p>
<p>for taking steroids but people have gone to jail for</p>
<p>lying to the government</p>
<p>about listen if they take him</p>
<p>his money away or if they take you know say that you</p>
<p>know you did some</p>
<p>stuff that was</p>
<p>against the rules and you know you</p>
<p>should be fined and we can prove that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going after him to lock him up man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>after him to set an example and lock him up for</p>
<p>something that everyone&rsquo;s doing everyone is doing it</p>
<p>especially in</p>
<p>cycling but remember he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be arrested for doing steroids they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t lock him up for that they</p>
<p>would lock him up for committing perjury</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>weird right that&rsquo;s how they got al capone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they get</p>
<p>everything right</p>
<p>or no they got</p>
<p>him attached that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>the case against</p>
<p>barry bonds is</p>
<p>the case is you perched yourself on the</p>
<p>stand right how</p>
<p>weird is that like</p>
<p>you have to tell us the truth</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crime well you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you have the</p>
<p>right to take the fifth</p>
<p>right but you can</p>
<p>say nothing which is</p>
<p>one of the great</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>our system you can actually</p>
<p>you can choose</p>
<p>to not incriminate yourself</p>
<p>i refuse to</p>
<p>speak cause i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna incriminate myself and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right but don&rsquo;t they lock people up when they do that</p>
<p>you can be locked up if you are</p>
<p>given i believe now i&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>legal scholarship</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;d be doing that all the time what</p>
<p>i believe you can be locked up is if you have evidence</p>
<p>and the government</p>
<p>subpoenas that evidence</p>
<p>and you refuse to speak</p>
<p>if you say i&rsquo;m not telling on my friend</p>
<p>you can go to jail for that</p>
<p>they can put you in jail for that</p>
<p>and they have</p>
<p>they put a journalist in jail</p>
<p>because she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t divulge</p>
<p>her sources</p>
<p>and i believe that was in the valerie</p>
<p>claim case yeah that&rsquo;s creepy</p>
<p>shit she said i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna divulge</p>
<p>who told me</p>
<p>that this person was a cia operative or whatever</p>
<p>and she went to jail and then</p>
<p>scooter libby</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure if i&rsquo;m getting all my facts right but</p>
<p>scooter libby</p>
<p>it turns out was</p>
<p>pardoned by the president</p>
<p>later on but convicted of</p>
<p>telling divulging</p>
<p>an agent a us</p>
<p>agent&rsquo;s identity to</p>
<p>a non authorized person</p>
<p>which is a crime in this country it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>bizarre how many different people we have all over the</p>
<p>world that are in military bases and you know</p>
<p>that are government operatives of the united</p>
<p>states that we have</p>
<p>positioned all over the</p>
<p>world to kind of keep an eye on</p>
<p>everything we always have</p>
<p>and it comes from the cold war and it&rsquo;s a dangerous</p>
<p>place but the real</p>
<p>issue becomes what is</p>
<p>the us strength has always been</p>
<p>not that its</p>
<p>power comes from the barrel of a gun</p>
<p>the us has always been</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s influence</p>
<p>innovation but mostly it&rsquo;s a beacon of hope</p>
<p>where you can come here</p>
<p>and if you got the</p>
<p>stuff and you got the</p>
<p>medal you might just be a millionaire</p>
<p>that is something that resonates throughout the entire</p>
<p>world and always has</p>
<p>i wanted to ask you this because you&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>experience in the middle east</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think is happening</p>
<p>with all these different</p>
<p>places with</p>
<p>saudi arabia</p>
<p>with egypt i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>beautiful thing and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>human thing and i&rsquo;ll tell you what i</p>
<p>think mostly most of all</p>
<p>i think that you</p>
<p>heard a lot of</p>
<p>analysts and professionals and people who follow this</p>
<p>stuff and people who are so called</p>
<p>experts and i used</p>
<p>to always hear something they used to always say this</p>
<p>democracies not</p>
<p>synonymous with</p>
<p>islam you&rsquo;d hear that all the time</p>
<p>and i think what this</p>
<p>proves is that democracy and</p>
<p>let me define democracy</p>
<p>the desire for</p>
<p>representative government let&rsquo;s just take that</p>
<p>the life liberty and the pursuit of happiness</p>
<p>just let me pursue whatever it is</p>
<p>those kinds of</p>
<p>things being able to</p>
<p>speak my mind being able</p>
<p>to petition my government being able to say something</p>
<p>against my government</p>
<p>being able to all the</p>
<p>things i take granted</p>
<p>those are human</p>
<p>rights and they</p>
<p>are not american</p>
<p>rights they are</p>
<p>human rights</p>
<p>and this proves that you can say whatever you want</p>
<p>about islam or anything else or any</p>
<p>other religion</p>
<p>human beings want a better life for</p>
<p>their children</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>would choose to have</p>
<p>represented government over a</p>
<p>dictatorship like jose</p>
<p>mubarak or a</p>
<p>dictatorship like</p>
<p>the royal family</p>
<p>essentially is in</p>
<p>saudi arabia</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tell me any</p>
<p>human being wants to live that way</p>
<p>and i find it very inspiring that one man in tunisia</p>
<p>lit himself on fire you want to talk</p>
<p>about a ripple</p>
<p>effect lit himself on fire because they took away his</p>
<p>license i believe he was selling fruit</p>
<p>and he said enough is enough</p>
<p>he was so desperate</p>
<p>and he said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to make an example this is my protest</p>
<p>you want to take</p>
<p>everything from me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll light myself on fire</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a good move but that was a</p>
<p>spark that called that</p>
<p>said we don&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>afraid anymore</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to be we don&rsquo;t have to cringe and saying that in</p>
<p>these governments</p>
<p>like egypt in both</p>
<p>places where they have</p>
<p>where the military and</p>
<p>secret police come in</p>
<p>and do some pretty</p>
<p>awful things to you</p>
<p>that takes real guts so i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>i think this is</p>
<p>an incredible time in the sense that</p>
<p>the middle east is</p>
<p>changing it really is</p>
<p>changing and</p>
<p>it really is the internet nation of</p>
<p>course it is you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep information</p>
<p>away from people you can fool the people sometimes</p>
<p>you can fool all</p>
<p>the people sometimes you can be some of the people some</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fool all the people all the time except</p>
<p>north korea</p>
<p>who said that i believe that was abe lincoln</p>
<p>right did he say that</p>
<p>who knows what the fuck abe really said</p>
<p>you know abe</p>
<p>lincoln was a racist</p>
<p>he was trying to encourage</p>
<p>black people to move to</p>
<p>south america because they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>along with white people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually more complicated than that but i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more complicated than that of course he is</p>
<p>so he slept with dudes too hey</p>
<p>slept with dudes they slept in bed together stay warm</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s no big deal</p>
<p>you gotta do what you gotta do man you live in</p>
<p>a fucking prairie</p>
<p>for res anders days</p>
<p>out somebody&rsquo;s cock flies out of a speedo then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna call me gay wasn&rsquo;t abe lincoln a wrestler</p>
<p>he was very</p>
<p>strong he was</p>
<p>about six four and he was very very</p>
<p>strong they said he used to be able to hold an</p>
<p>axe like a one of</p>
<p>those big wood chopping axe</p>
<p>out for like longer than anybody else</p>
<p>with his arms straight like that he was a real wiry</p>
<p>strong dude</p>
<p>hold an axe</p>
<p>straight with his arm what a</p>
<p>weird competition that well that back</p>
<p>in the day they did all this</p>
<p>hopscotch hard they</p>
<p>did all those</p>
<p>weird things</p>
<p>right like you know</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see a whole</p>
<p>hind quarter of a mule up</p>
<p>above your head you know</p>
<p>there had to be a</p>
<p>first guy back then to try to</p>
<p>wrestle a bear too</p>
<p>i always think</p>
<p>about that stuff</p>
<p>who wrote a bull</p>
<p>who said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna hey you know what</p>
<p>throw a testicle cinch on that bull i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get up on him and see how long it</p>
<p>takes what country does that originate</p>
<p>in is that an american</p>
<p>tradition i believe that well i probably started in</p>
<p>spain they were like</p>
<p>knocking like a</p>
<p>rider i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna kill it with a sword</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty badass</p>
<p>yeah you know what bothers me</p>
<p>about that though man there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of other dudes helping out well</p>
<p>because you know the madeira</p>
<p>bull i think it&rsquo;s called the madeira</p>
<p>bull hemingway</p>
<p>wrote a book called</p>
<p>death in the afternoon</p>
<p>and he kind of</p>
<p>brings you through</p>
<p>what a fighting bull is about</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed in spain</p>
<p>and some of you guys are listening to this</p>
<p>just check this out you&rsquo;re not allowed in spain</p>
<p>to approach a</p>
<p>fighting bull on foot</p>
<p>you must approach it on a bicycle</p>
<p>motorcycle or car you know why</p>
<p>why because bulls figure out the way you move</p>
<p>and if they</p>
<p>watch you walking</p>
<p>around all the time and running around</p>
<p>when you put them</p>
<p>in the ring</p>
<p>with the matador</p>
<p>that matador</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a chance</p>
<p>cause they figured you out</p>
<p>the first time a bull ever sees a</p>
<p>human being on two feet</p>
<p>by law in spain</p>
<p>is when he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>put out there in</p>
<p>front of that matador</p>
<p>and by the way</p>
<p>by the way they</p>
<p>gotta rub his eyes with pepper to keep him a little bit</p>
<p>blind they gotta</p>
<p>the piccadil</p>
<p>has come in there</p>
<p>and stab him in the back so he can&rsquo;t lift his head</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>these spears and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty brutal</p>
<p>they gotta disable that bull before a</p>
<p>human being has any shot</p>
<p>any shot of</p>
<p>fighting it</p>
<p>and they still die</p>
<p>they still die when they say when you&rsquo;re at matador in</p>
<p>spain that&rsquo;s who you are forget girls forget</p>
<p>music forget</p>
<p>everything else</p>
<p>your life is</p>
<p>about the bull</p>
<p>fuck is there a lot of</p>
<p>money in being a manador</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s huge glory and</p>
<p>money and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re a national hero if you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>and and by the way it&rsquo;s probably like the ufc you</p>
<p>start with like you know guys are</p>
<p>fighting yeah</p>
<p>kind of with</p>
<p>blunt horns and then</p>
<p>all the way up to the big show</p>
<p>but but um but</p>
<p>you know when they used to pit bulls with bears</p>
<p>guess she used to always win</p>
<p>oh i would say the ball yeah i</p>
<p>would say every time they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>strong man this is</p>
<p>strong you guys</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>touched one you ever been on one or</p>
<p>anything yeah if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ridden a ball no but i&rsquo;ve touched it i&rsquo;ve been to</p>
<p>saddle ranch</p>
<p>same thing sort of</p>
<p>totally same thing</p>
<p>when we were doing fear facts</p>
<p>we made people ride poles one day it was the scariest</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ever been</p>
<p>any any day of filming this is one day</p>
<p>where i felt like we</p>
<p>crossed the line</p>
<p>i was like what are you doing</p>
<p>those are dangerous</p>
<p>yeah they are not they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bulls they were this was the</p>
<p>their argument these are</p>
<p>training bulls they&rsquo;re not as aggressive</p>
<p>what does that bull know he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>training ball</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know you were a bull</p>
<p>mind reader</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the bull</p>
<p>whisper is he around</p>
<p>i love when people</p>
<p>think they know what an animal is i love</p>
<p>when they like</p>
<p>no strand this</p>
<p>tiger won&rsquo;t bite you well you were talking</p>
<p>about it to me in the</p>
<p>kitchen we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about that grizzly</p>
<p>trained bear that tore the</p>
<p>i think is just</p>
<p>trainers brother cousin or something</p>
<p>and it killed him in a couple of</p>
<p>seconds it was horrible</p>
<p>which is so</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a 1500 pound bear</p>
<p>grabbed the hold of an</p>
<p>end for no reason and</p>
<p>shot them lazy in a lazy</p>
<p>way and the poor guy</p>
<p>i guess he&rsquo;s pretty aggressive</p>
<p>yeah obviously</p>
<p>the guy must have</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what it represented to the bear but</p>
<p>it represented some sort of a threat</p>
<p>well apparently</p>
<p>though he was doing what he was supposed to do and i</p>
<p>guess the guy didn&rsquo;t have his arms up or something and</p>
<p>the bear ended up</p>
<p>grabbing onto</p>
<p>his neck and his instinct took over and he</p>
<p>said oh i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>shake you to death</p>
<p>which is tears you&rsquo;re supposed to have your arms up</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the bears gotta</p>
<p>stick em up</p>
<p>pose my bear</p>
<p>wrestling and i&rsquo;m a white belt</p>
<p>still i&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>so what do you</p>
<p>think the fuck is</p>
<p>going on with all these mass</p>
<p>deaths there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a million fish die in</p>
<p>the redondo</p>
<p>beach harbor</p>
<p>all these animals that have dying</p>
<p>birds that are falling from the sky</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but i would</p>
<p>imagine we have a very polluted</p>
<p>environment and probably is a combination of all</p>
<p>those chemicals</p>
<p>in the environment</p>
<p>and chemicals are being made</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very good at coming up with synthetic</p>
<p>material and</p>
<p>synthetic chemicals and</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re probably not as good at and what the fda</p>
<p>could never do</p>
<p>is figure out how all</p>
<p>these chemicals when put together</p>
<p>interact or how they</p>
<p>what they do</p>
<p>to mitoplasma and i like</p>
<p>using big words but like what they do to our bodies</p>
<p>on prolonged</p>
<p>you know when we</p>
<p>drink them when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re around them all the time look at your house</p>
<p>all these new products that come out that have huge</p>
<p>advertising campaigns they&rsquo;re probably very safe</p>
<p>on their own</p>
<p>what happens</p>
<p>when you mix six of them in the perfect combination</p>
<p>what is that doing to your genetics</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wi fi doing to you yeah who knows what the fuck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>we know that</p>
<p>sonar gets in the way of</p>
<p>whales migratory</p>
<p>fucks whales out</p>
<p>right yeah so so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always this constant</p>
<p>dance of how you know in</p>
<p>china now what they&rsquo;re doing i</p>
<p>think is really</p>
<p>interesting is a lot of the architects when they plan</p>
<p>these cities</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>gardens on the roofs so you can</p>
<p>plant food and grow your own food on the roof of your</p>
<p>building you know china is</p>
<p>self sustainable</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a billion people there</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t import food</p>
<p>they make their own food</p>
<p>which is again very</p>
<p>which is a very recent development for</p>
<p>china it&rsquo;s pretty amazing</p>
<p>do that with a billion people</p>
<p>but when you do that you</p>
<p>gotta eat bugs</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>better but we&rsquo;re getting better and better</p>
<p>at figuring out ways to grow</p>
<p>plants for example that don&rsquo;t need pesticides</p>
<p>that are much higher in protein and different nutrients</p>
<p>sure but then you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>things are genetically modified</p>
<p>and monsanto owns ours</p>
<p>you know monsanto is</p>
<p>scary as fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a thing when you say it&rsquo;s fine if you want to</p>
<p>cross pollinate</p>
<p>to wheat the</p>
<p>strains but when you take</p>
<p>the gene from a</p>
<p>jellyfish put it in a</p>
<p>strawberry so that my</p>
<p>strawberry doesn&rsquo;t freeze when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>shipping it across the country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>weird man or</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>when all of a sudden</p>
<p>my oranges are square because it&rsquo;s easier to pack</p>
<p>them well have you seen all the wikileaks documents</p>
<p>leading to genetically modified</p>
<p>food so they&rsquo;re trying to push it all across the world</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to push</p>
<p>in the countries and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re putting imposing sanctions on</p>
<p>countries well what they</p>
<p>do also what</p>
<p>you can if you plant one</p>
<p>field over here it&rsquo;s genetically modified and</p>
<p>it flies in the air</p>
<p>yeah and then they sue</p>
<p>those people and</p>
<p>those people have to either</p>
<p>close up their farm or</p>
<p>it becomes a fucking disaster</p>
<p>i think i think you know i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>capitalist and all that but</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>we are paying we have to be very careful with how</p>
<p>everything is</p>
<p>becoming these conglomerates and how</p>
<p>things are becoming</p>
<p>so corporate</p>
<p>look at radio</p>
<p>every time i</p>
<p>travel this country you and i both</p>
<p>travel this country</p>
<p>everything is so homogenous</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve paid a price</p>
<p>you people want</p>
<p>efficiency but why in the</p>
<p>world when i go to most cities can i only eat at a</p>
<p>corporate chain</p>
<p>is there a why</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m surrounded by</p>
<p>i was gonna say</p>
<p>clear channel</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m surrounded by</p>
<p>beige walls whether it&rsquo;s kmart</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no continuum there&rsquo;s no like history</p>
<p>nobody feels connected to anything</p>
<p>everything around me</p>
<p>is everybody&rsquo;s trying to sell me something i don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>and it robs</p>
<p>every city of its character</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>death of the american city</p>
<p>what happened to main</p>
<p>street with the mom and pop shops i want that</p>
<p>go to ohio in</p>
<p>porto there</p>
<p>but these cities used to all have it</p>
<p>and i understand that you have to go to</p>
<p>small places to get that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>large volume of people</p>
<p>small places like that becoming</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an offshoot of globalism</p>
<p>and it was a</p>
<p>price we had to pay we&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>swing back but</p>
<p>we pay a price</p>
<p>for what do you</p>
<p>think what do you</p>
<p>think about all</p>
<p>these people that believe that you know and if you read</p>
<p>almost every ancient religion has some</p>
<p>story of a great</p>
<p>apocalypse or a</p>
<p>great catastrophe and</p>
<p>almost every religion has some</p>
<p>story about a previous</p>
<p>existing society that was advanced</p>
<p>and that was almost</p>
<p>wiped off to face the earth</p>
<p>you know when you hear shit</p>
<p>about all these animals</p>
<p>dying and fish dying this</p>
<p>sounds like religious scripture</p>
<p>how fucking</p>
<p>crazy would it be</p>
<p>if we all really have been all through this before if</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>have literally gotten to the</p>
<p>point of where we are now</p>
<p>like this sophisticated</p>
<p>if we died off</p>
<p>today how much of this shit</p>
<p>would be around</p>
<p>in 10 000 years or so how much</p>
<p>would we be able to find and recognize</p>
<p>anything that isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>steel i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great question</p>
<p>i do think that</p>
<p>what the answer</p>
<p>may lie in somewhere in the area if i were</p>
<p>to answer that questions what i don&rsquo;t know but i think</p>
<p>that there is a</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>are still faced with the same problems as</p>
<p>human beings so whether or not</p>
<p>i was living 3 000 years ago</p>
<p>the big questions</p>
<p>that one has to</p>
<p>wrestle with</p>
<p>that answer the question of what am i doing here</p>
<p>who am i really</p>
<p>what am i supposed to do</p>
<p>what does this all mean</p>
<p>those are questions you can</p>
<p>never run from and so</p>
<p>within that context i think we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>still be trying to answer</p>
<p>those questions we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>still be trying to go beyond our biology</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d still be trying to get more pleasure out of</p>
<p>than pain we&rsquo;d still be</p>
<p>trying to figure out how to keep our children alive</p>
<p>with better food better</p>
<p>health care</p>
<p>and but we&rsquo;d be competing with resources and we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>still have wars</p>
<p>so i think in a way it makes</p>
<p>sense that we keep repeating ourselves this is the</p>
<p>human experience but what i&rsquo;m saying is do you</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s ever gotten to this</p>
<p>point before when you look at some of the</p>
<p>structures that</p>
<p>exist that that are unexplained</p>
<p>that are many many thousands of years old</p>
<p>especially like the pyramids and</p>
<p>yeah you go i mean</p>
<p>unexplained in the</p>
<p>fact that they&rsquo;re not exactly sure how they put that</p>
<p>all together there&rsquo;s a lot of theories and there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>old dynasty and new dynasty</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s old</p>
<p>kingdom and new kingdom there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>structures that they believe are far far</p>
<p>older than the traditional</p>
<p>we thought like the</p>
<p>pyramid of giza or</p>
<p>the great pyramid of any</p>
<p>well i think what separates</p>
<p>human beings from</p>
<p>animals as far as i know is that we have imagination</p>
<p>and that we seem to be always moving toward</p>
<p>the limits of our imagination</p>
<p>but what freaks me out is there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of shit that they can&rsquo;t figure out</p>
<p>how it all got done</p>
<p>and one of them is dogs</p>
<p>do you know dogs are a</p>
<p>great mystery you know</p>
<p>when you look into the dna of</p>
<p>dogs it turns out that all of them descend from wolves</p>
<p>they thought it was</p>
<p>gonna be a bunch of different wild</p>
<p>candids and you know different and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>from all from fucking</p>
<p>wolves actually domesticated</p>
<p>wolves so and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know how the fuck that was done</p>
<p>thousands and</p>
<p>thousands of</p>
<p>years ago we do know that people have always bred</p>
<p>their animals</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>horses or whatever sure even farm animals to eat</p>
<p>so long ago</p>
<p>it goes back so far</p>
<p>that it literally predates society</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s squirrely</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about 10 000</p>
<p>15 000 maybe even deeper and deeper into</p>
<p>the history</p>
<p>of breeding dogs</p>
<p>yeah and i think the answer</p>
<p>maybe also is the fact that</p>
<p>this world is way more</p>
<p>much older than ours we are probably much older</p>
<p>human beings are</p>
<p>probably much</p>
<p>history is one</p>
<p>thing but real</p>
<p>human history is another and</p>
<p>and you also wonder</p>
<p>evolution i always</p>
<p>think about that</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting to me is</p>
<p>if indeed you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of sense that</p>
<p>we evolve from apes</p>
<p>or chimps or whatever it</p>
<p>might be it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know people say well</p>
<p>we kind of seem to have stopped</p>
<p>evolving physically then if that&rsquo;s the case didn&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>no we moved in a different direction look the</p>
<p>doubling of the</p>
<p>human brain size is the giant</p>
<p>the biggest</p>
<p>mystery in the entire fossil record and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>changed us from</p>
<p>this you know</p>
<p>beetle eating fucking</p>
<p>freak monkey</p>
<p>to human beings and</p>
<p>whatever the fuck</p>
<p>caused it why is</p>
<p>that i wonder why</p>
<p>mckenna believes it was mushrooms</p>
<p>you know some people believe it was the</p>
<p>throwing arms some people believe it was fish</p>
<p>that we started eating</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense to me because bears are</p>
<p>stupid as fuck</p>
<p>and they eat a lot of but it goes beyond that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying why you know chimps have always been chimps</p>
<p>right human beings have continued to evolve</p>
<p>just at least an hour or so</p>
<p>in that we do really amazing</p>
<p>things you know i joke around</p>
<p>about people being from</p>
<p>monkeys and chimps but the real lineage is there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different primates that evolved</p>
<p>next to each</p>
<p>other for some reason</p>
<p>we evolved in</p>
<p>a far more sophisticated way than all the rest of them</p>
<p>in the sense that we&rsquo;re always trying to go beyond that</p>
<p>which we can</p>
<p>measure and we&rsquo;re always contemplating what</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>how would you ever measure for example</p>
<p>the fact that a great</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know mozart or baccanada</p>
<p>makes some people</p>
<p>feel profoundly sad and overjoyed at the same time</p>
<p>why do we even have that</p>
<p>stuff yeah it</p>
<p>sounds good to our ears</p>
<p>but think about the</p>
<p>genius of great jazz like</p>
<p>louis armstrong hey jazz</p>
<p>like why in the</p>
<p>world would that</p>
<p>guy apologize</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just saying i&rsquo;m using</p>
<p>it as an art form like</p>
<p>why in the world</p>
<p>would we come up with these</p>
<p>brass horns and</p>
<p>plants all those</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>are sort of what we stay alive for</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what are we supposed to be doing with that</p>
<p>what are we supposed to be doing with the fact that</p>
<p>most religions all religions talk about</p>
<p>well love each</p>
<p>other that&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing love each</p>
<p>other and then by the way</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>do with that relationship what do you try to make the</p>
<p>world better</p>
<p>what do you do when you come together</p>
<p>as social animals why</p>
<p>and what is the</p>
<p>point of that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the big question that we&rsquo;re always dealing with that i</p>
<p>think it seems that there&rsquo;s no point</p>
<p>it seems that the</p>
<p>point is to</p>
<p>enjoy it and to be nice to people that seems to be the</p>
<p>point the idea if you&rsquo;re temporary you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>temporary being and all your descendants are temporary</p>
<p>beings we just</p>
<p>evolving in a tide of ever</p>
<p>changing temporary beings</p>
<p>then the only</p>
<p>point is just be nice but then why</p>
<p>but then we just be then i</p>
<p>guess be nice have fun</p>
<p>write it out let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>is there a group</p>
<p>of people that were</p>
<p>affected by in a positive</p>
<p>way do you think there&rsquo;s anything to be said</p>
<p>about bob going beyond that in the</p>
<p>sense that are we supposed to evolve and continue to</p>
<p>understand more and more</p>
<p>until we until our</p>
<p>lives were so</p>
<p>short it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing we talked</p>
<p>about before but the</p>
<p>human experience</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is we keep jumping on each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shoulders what</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying right yeah</p>
<p>sure so you know even newton said that he said i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>stood on the shoulder</p>
<p>giants you guys all talk</p>
<p>about me being</p>
<p>i invented calculus</p>
<p>not bad isaac</p>
<p>who said by the way as big as a compliment</p>
<p>was lifelong celibacy</p>
<p>not not calculus</p>
<p>he was like my biggest compliment</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that i invented you know the</p>
<p>concept of gravity and spatial relationships it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a that i was</p>
<p>celibate my</p>
<p>whole life that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty cool</p>
<p>yeah i was like really</p>
<p>yeah if one</p>
<p>chick sucked his dick</p>
<p>would have ruined</p>
<p>everything right right</p>
<p>you have to be</p>
<p>the father of modern</p>
<p>physics you know</p>
<p>modern science but he said</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i hate</p>
<p>math so much</p>
<p>we all stand on each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s shoulders it seems that we are</p>
<p>evolving in our</p>
<p>understanding of more and more of how even animals</p>
<p>think and of course</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re certainly</p>
<p>evolving so</p>
<p>there must be a</p>
<p>point to this</p>
<p>evolution i hope i always have said that i</p>
<p>think that we&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>becoming something through</p>
<p>technology and that</p>
<p>human beings are probably just</p>
<p>like a caterpillar that becomes a butterfly but just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>all our natural instincts towards materialism and</p>
<p>greed and selfishness and you know</p>
<p>all these monkey instincts</p>
<p>that we have left over perhaps working in a natural</p>
<p>order to move us</p>
<p>towards this</p>
<p>ultimate goal</p>
<p>of some sort of</p>
<p>technology coming</p>
<p>along with all the</p>
<p>technology we&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>for example yeah i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what kurtzwell believes he believes that you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be some sort of an artificial</p>
<p>technology and artificial intelligence</p>
<p>that we can download our consciousness into</p>
<p>and that you will</p>
<p>exist forever in perpetrude in this</p>
<p>artificial environment</p>
<p>how does yeah</p>
<p>there you go that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>classic what</p>
<p>does that mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the matrix i mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking craziness not only that you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about if you can duplicate your consciousness you</p>
<p>could duplicate it in an infinite amount of times</p>
<p>and it will</p>
<p>exist not here in this physical</p>
<p>space but it will</p>
<p>exist in some sort of</p>
<p>cyber world</p>
<p>where you will constantly be in</p>
<p>a replaying life</p>
<p>not only that</p>
<p>an infinite number of</p>
<p>them and not</p>
<p>only that we will</p>
<p>ultimately and</p>
<p>truly be connected</p>
<p>and our experience will be</p>
<p>everybody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>experience we are now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in a weird way and i</p>
<p>think the reason why it&rsquo;s set up in a</p>
<p>weird way is to encourage competition</p>
<p>you know the thing that</p>
<p>bugs people the most</p>
<p>is losing you know the thing</p>
<p>losing anything losing a person</p>
<p>losing you know</p>
<p>losing your job losing losing losing in a</p>
<p>fight losing in a game</p>
<p>frustrating for us</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re designed for competition some people so much so</p>
<p>that you beat them at pool and they get mad at you you</p>
<p>ever been around that guy</p>
<p>you beat him at pool</p>
<p>but see i like to</p>
<p>ask the next</p>
<p>question though like</p>
<p>defining that really actually i</p>
<p>think in some ways</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just losing your power</p>
<p>in a way losing is to be left alone</p>
<p>in a way to be sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not special</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not special</p>
<p>and people leave you they</p>
<p>leave you yeah</p>
<p>and so i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ultimately why</p>
<p>people hate losing so much it&rsquo;s that memory of feeling</p>
<p>alone it&rsquo;s that but there&rsquo;s also a</p>
<p>strong desire</p>
<p>for competition amongst most people how many</p>
<p>comics do you know that when</p>
<p>they see someone</p>
<p>else get something something big they actually get</p>
<p>upset that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not happening to them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the only</p>
<p>successful comic</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
<p>comics not talk bad</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous people have talked bad</p>
<p>about me lots of people not really not comics</p>
<p>go talk to mark baron</p>
<p>no no no you don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>comics say bad things</p>
<p>about you i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the point i&rsquo;m making is that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right i mean for the most part i&rsquo;m saying that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right people</p>
<p>when somebody actually</p>
<p>does well if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>comic they get</p>
<p>a lot of times</p>
<p>yeah a lot of</p>
<p>times different deserved sometimes well</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young and scrappy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re all coming up in the same</p>
<p>order you know like you&rsquo;re all like 22 23 and one of</p>
<p>these 22 year old guys gets</p>
<p>some radio show</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s the morning dj guy like oh fuck</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s a morning dj</p>
<p>guide ktla now or whatever you know what i mean</p>
<p>like and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you like dudes feel like that</p>
<p>could have been them</p>
<p>you know and then what they have to</p>
<p>understand also by the way is that</p>
<p>this is not a linear</p>
<p>process right</p>
<p>this world is made of a</p>
<p>whole bunch of non linear luck</p>
<p>and mathematics</p>
<p>well you say that because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a very experienced guy and you&rsquo;ve gone through so many</p>
<p>things and so many different projects</p>
<p>i mean you&rsquo;ve gone through the tour de</p>
<p>force of television</p>
<p>you did a sketch show in mad tv you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>family shows on</p>
<p>those warner brothers networks right</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done fucking</p>
<p>everything you did sex in the city</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;ve done so many different things</p>
<p>really had a</p>
<p>broad like view</p>
<p>of the whole</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>scene that a lot</p>
<p>of people just don&rsquo;t get yeah they don&rsquo;t get that full</p>
<p>frame so when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young especially</p>
<p>like all you know is i wanna</p>
<p>fucking make it i</p>
<p>gotta make it i</p>
<p>gotta pay my bills</p>
<p>fucking freaking out</p>
<p>shit he got it</p>
<p>fuck why didn&rsquo;t he i remember</p>
<p>that by the way i remember being terrified i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna make it i remember</p>
<p>thinking that&rsquo;s not an option for me</p>
<p>yeah like it wasn&rsquo;t an option</p>
<p>not to be working</p>
<p>well all of us i</p>
<p>think anybody who actually became a</p>
<p>comic you had</p>
<p>to deal with the fact that man if i put my eggs in this</p>
<p>basket this shit might</p>
<p>turn out terrible</p>
<p>right i might just live in rotten</p>
<p>eggs that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrifying it&rsquo;s terrifying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely terrifying</p>
<p>but my point is that</p>
<p>in show business</p>
<p>the whole idea of</p>
<p>pursuing it and</p>
<p>going after it</p>
<p>it is absolutely of course uncertain</p>
<p>like it has to be uncertain</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uncertain</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>where like real</p>
<p>creative that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where adventure and</p>
<p>creativity comes from something blossoms out of that</p>
<p>uncertain if you knew it was</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>and you had it all plotted out</p>
<p>would be boring as fuck when you got</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s boring for you and it&rsquo;s boring for them you</p>
<p>would have to do drugs you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>start doing coke i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s why people</p>
<p>like when they take a gig for the</p>
<p>money for example like</p>
<p>they go well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna give me 7 million to do</p>
<p>a talk show a game show</p>
<p>they really you pay a</p>
<p>price for that yes</p>
<p>you gotta keep the</p>
<p>uncertainty dude i paid a</p>
<p>price for fear factor for sure</p>
<p>i love doing that show and it was a lot of fun and i</p>
<p>loved making all that</p>
<p>money and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>happy i did it</p>
<p>but man there</p>
<p>was a lot of days that i didn&rsquo;t want to do that</p>
<p>and i thought you</p>
<p>know this is hokey or this is</p>
<p>silly or this is like god this is like</p>
<p>it became a job</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why i always</p>
<p>say don&rsquo;t make fun of whores</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all whores in some</p>
<p>ways we&rsquo;ve all whored before is what i&rsquo;m saying sure</p>
<p>but my whole</p>
<p>point about it</p>
<p>whole competition thing</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>think that all</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all set up that</p>
<p>way on purpose and then like showbiz competition and</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>competition even martial arts competition</p>
<p>like these guys when they start</p>
<p>trash talking each</p>
<p>other on the internet</p>
<p>you know how i look at it when i look at like two</p>
<p>fighters are</p>
<p>about to trash talk each other</p>
<p>i look at it like birds that are squawking</p>
<p>at each other</p>
<p>like one birds is on the fence</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>other bird like fucking flops its wings and gets</p>
<p>close to it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this natural</p>
<p>thing that they&rsquo;re doing like they have to do this</p>
<p>to in order to</p>
<p>motivate them to be great</p>
<p>in order to push them all to the next level</p>
<p>you have to feel the</p>
<p>jealousy well what</p>
<p>about floyd</p>
<p>patterson who</p>
<p>said you know i always wondered who ali was talking</p>
<p>talking to and he said i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>greatest and</p>
<p>then i realized one day he was talking to himself wow</p>
<p>yeah he said</p>
<p>to me because you know i&rsquo;m scared to</p>
<p>death every time i step in that ring</p>
<p>but i get myself worked up</p>
<p>and by the time i&rsquo;m in there</p>
<p>i believe what i&rsquo;m saying to myself it&rsquo;s the saddest</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>world that muhammad ali is the way he is now</p>
<p>great out and that you know it&rsquo;s parkinson&rsquo;s and he has</p>
<p>trauma related parkinson&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s amazing also is he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hide it from the</p>
<p>world to get the guy holds the</p>
<p>torch the olympics he just gets up in</p>
<p>front of everybody here&rsquo;s me you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird listening to mike tyson talk</p>
<p>these days have you</p>
<p>heard mike tyson talk</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a reality show now yeah</p>
<p>he got interviewed what&rsquo;s his reality show on</p>
<p>on pigeons when he got interviewed at</p>
<p>this there was a showtime</p>
<p>boxing match recently no yeah</p>
<p>the pay per view</p>
<p>match between</p>
<p>miguel kodo and</p>
<p>we caught him</p>
<p>iorga and it was a good fight</p>
<p>and they interviewed tyson</p>
<p>kodo did he stopped him in the last round</p>
<p>and they they talked to tyson</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>tyson like you know it was like he was</p>
<p>laboring to talk</p>
<p>you know and i was listening to it i was like wow</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>tired and maybe they caught yeah you</p>
<p>might have been high as fuck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>cause when they catch me i</p>
<p>might look like i have</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>especially if i&rsquo;m at a fight</p>
<p>you know what i don&rsquo;t have to do commentary god i love</p>
<p>going to fights when i don&rsquo;t have to do commentary</p>
<p>cause these guys</p>
<p>whenever we go to the ufc</p>
<p>brian and ari and joey</p>
<p>these guys take pot cookies and get blitzkrieged</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re sitting up</p>
<p>last time was acid</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re sitting up in the in the</p>
<p>stands having the fucking time i</p>
<p>gotta come with</p>
<p>joey diaz does the commentary</p>
<p>right joey diaz is like in the middle of fights</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll start just</p>
<p>rants and raves</p>
<p>about this happening that happened</p>
<p>so get your</p>
<p>pineapples bj pen</p>
<p>so especially if somebody gets</p>
<p>knocked out or somebody</p>
<p>gets submitted i don&rsquo;t what the fuck did i tell you dog</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll get up and go</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t get to see that anymore i do you know</p>
<p>but when did you</p>
<p>you know when did you</p>
<p>really truly feel comfortable calling a</p>
<p>fight in the ufc</p>
<p>when did it really</p>
<p>start to jail because it just comes out of you now</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>first couple times i was</p>
<p>self conscious</p>
<p>about it you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird you trying to</p>
<p>a good job but you don&rsquo;t want to be there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of ego</p>
<p>involved in commentary that&rsquo;s very unpleasant</p>
<p>like you hear people talking too much</p>
<p>about themselves or you take yourself completely</p>
<p>out of what they</p>
<p>would do well i have to</p>
<p>first of all i&rsquo;m completely</p>
<p>illegitimate</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>brown belt in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>and i fought in some taekwondo and some kickboxing but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never fought any mma</p>
<p>fights at all so</p>
<p>what am i gonna say i</p>
<p>could do better than this no</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just silly i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>completely objective</p>
<p>about it but</p>
<p>it took a while for me</p>
<p>to be comfortable with like how i should</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>should talk</p>
<p>about what i shouldn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about and when to talk when not to talk and</p>
<p>you know how to how to like</p>
<p>be as respectful as possible but yet be as objective</p>
<p>and analytical as possible</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>walk a fine line between critiquing</p>
<p>fighters and criticizing them or</p>
<p>obsessing patterns</p>
<p>that you see in movement and critiquing behavior</p>
<p>and training</p>
<p>regiments and shit like that</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s tricky it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tricky but i always do it from a</p>
<p>place of respect</p>
<p>and i always do it from a place of</p>
<p>as objective as i&rsquo;m capable</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re very good at doing it it&rsquo;s fun to do i</p>
<p>think goldie</p>
<p>is a poet that dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just amazing well</p>
<p>what a lot of</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know is like they&rsquo;ll say goldie phil</p>
<p>you gotta fill here</p>
<p>gotta fill here they&rsquo;ll say they say that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here headsets</p>
<p>so goldie will</p>
<p>start just going off about</p>
<p>this fucking</p>
<p>arena that we&rsquo;re in that was</p>
<p>built in 18 fucking 12</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s off the top</p>
<p>of his head</p>
<p>and he just does it</p>
<p>perfectly you know</p>
<p>i never heard</p>
<p>a guy 18 12 yeah</p>
<p>he might have</p>
<p>stumbled once in the thousand</p>
<p>fights that we it&rsquo;s like he wrote</p>
<p>those lines out and they&rsquo;re just perfect sometimes he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>the correct</p>
<p>thing when it comes to like the technique or something</p>
<p>like that but that&rsquo;s okay because i can correct him and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just trying to get</p>
<p>things going</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s just trying to</p>
<p>you know who</p>

<p>horse dance</p>
<p>i was fucking</p>
<p>dying yeah there was no room for</p>
<p>humor in those early ufcs</p>
<p>no man that was and i was</p>
<p>i was also the post</p>
<p>fight interviewer i wasn&rsquo;t a commentator so</p>
<p>no one got to see my</p>
<p>sense of i know</p>
<p>when we were with tank and we were all</p>
<p>those guys and you were just like</p>
<p>be careful don&rsquo;t be a jackass</p>
<p>around tank i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know dude tank will</p>
<p>implode your</p>
<p>skulls beat you up</p>

<p>you know you&rsquo;re like you know</p>
<p>brian don&rsquo;t be don&rsquo;t be like hey tank</p>

<p>tank will put you to</p>
<p>sleep where i remember</p>
<p>he put you to</p>
<p>sleep go to jail like normal kill you yeah you might</p>
<p>definitely change the way you look at the</p>
<p>world i remember shaking his hand</p>
<p>and and it felt i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never felt the hand that</p>
<p>strong this is</p>
<p>he was just a</p>
<p>bruh how about thinking</p>
<p>about dude like we were talking</p>
<p>about how badass mayhem is</p>
<p>you know you were</p>
<p>fucking around with mayhem</p>
<p>and i said well i want</p>
<p>to show you a</p>
<p>video of who</p>
<p>some are paul</p>
<p>harris emitting mayhem</p>
<p>just think that</p>
<p>someone can do that to a guy as good as mayhem</p>
<p>as good and as</p>
<p>strong as mayhem is crazy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>levels there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>levels upon</p>
<p>levels i&rsquo;m a baboon</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s a silverbacker</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it is</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>saluki imagine the</p>
<p>first dude that fucking stumble across gorillas</p>
<p>cause that did happen by the way as far as western</p>
<p>humans then you know as far as</p>
<p>white people that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right that that like that were</p>
<p>gorillas were a myth</p>
<p>until like the 1800s</p>
<p>right in indonesia a guy had</p>
<p>woke up a male</p>
<p>orangutan up</p>
<p>woke him up</p>
<p>and the thing</p>
<p>fleet flipped out and</p>
<p>grabbed him by the hair i got kind of long hair</p>
<p>thick in the knees</p>
<p>grabbed my hair and just</p>
<p>yang and scalped him</p>
<p>they took his just ripped</p>
<p>and scalped him like</p>
<p>he freaked out like</p>
<p>pulled his hair off and</p>
<p>then ran up into the trees oh my god so he had no scalp</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>so what they do they have to like skin graft</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucked onto his head you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>in indonesia</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;d probably just die of staph infection back</p>
<p>in the day i was surprised</p>
<p>like you know i</p>
<p>think the crazy</p>
<p>thing is gorillas</p>
<p>are the biggest but they don&rsquo;t even eat meat</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all vegetarian that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s called genetics my friend</p>
<p>if you ever</p>
<p>watch them go to</p>
<p>the san diego</p>
<p>zoo and watch</p>
<p>those gorillas you can</p>
<p>stand right next to them because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s plexible</p>
<p>watch them wrestle</p>
<p>all they do when they&rsquo;re little is wrestle</p>
<p>all they do is roll around and they have arm drags duck</p>
<p>unders i&rsquo;m not kidding headlocks</p>
<p>guillotine&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>swear to god</p>
<p>they put you in</p>
<p>their guard i swear</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>you that the man who invented jujutsu was his heli</p>
<p>on gracie helio well sort of i mean there was</p>
<p>the japanese i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised</p>
<p>of course of course but he you know after he</p>
<p>could find heli</p>
<p>on carlos i</p>
<p>would i wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if one day they were</p>
<p>watching gorillas role</p>
<p>watch them play</p>
<p>it is they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>they are the perfect</p>
<p>wrestlers they&rsquo;re so efficient for wrestling</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so efficient it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>weird that they&rsquo;re so big and that they eat</p>
<p>plants why because</p>
<p>silverback is not six feet tall</p>
<p>maybe six feet tall and weighs 600</p>
<p>pounds fat free</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>no fat on this</p>
<p>giant fucking</p>
<p>monstrous arms</p>
<p>but what is all that for is it all just to keep</p>
<p>things from fucking with it it must be</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t kill anybody</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>swing through trees they just</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not really aggressive</p>
<p>they have little dicks</p>
<p>yeah and they</p>
<p>have little dicks i have a bigger dick than a 600</p>
<p>pound gorilla</p>
<p>shazam son shazam</p>
<p>so but think</p>
<p>about that though</p>
<p>600 pounds that&rsquo;s a lot of weight and then and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>polar bear yeah</p>
<p>which would eat a gorilla</p>
<p>yeah what the fuck do you</p>
<p>think a polar bear</p>
<p>could eat a gorilla</p>
<p>yeah really yeah well do i</p>
<p>think so i don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever done that aren&rsquo;t they 15 to 16 to 1700</p>
<p>pounds is that what a</p>
<p>polar bear something</p>
<p>that was pretty goddamn bad yeah they</p>
<p>stand they stand 10 feet or higher</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bigger than a</p>
<p>basketball go to a</p>
<p>basketball hoop</p>
<p>try to touch the rim</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re bigger than that when they stand</p>
<p>on their hind legs</p>
<p>yeah they take down</p>
<p>things like elk with</p>
<p>their mouths</p>
<p>yeah what&rsquo;s the killer</p>
<p>whales you ever seen them eat</p>
<p>pilot whales through the ice</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve no doubt do</p>
<p>polar bears have big penises</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s good question but they&rsquo;ll kick the shit</p>
<p>out of question brian</p>
<p>solid question</p>
<p>good question brian</p>
<p>thank you hold that question for a</p>
<p>second we&rsquo;ll put that on the wall</p>

<p>it actively</p>
<p>targets human beings and yes</p>
<p>they will eat a</p>
<p>human being they will make a</p>
<p>bee line for you there&rsquo;s a terrifying</p>
<p>story that i read once</p>
<p>about these guys that were in a boat and the boat hit</p>
<p>an iceberg and the boat</p>
<p>started to sink</p>
<p>so they sent out a distress signal</p>
<p>and they climbed off the boat onto an ice shelf</p>
<p>you heard the</p>
<p>story yeah i know all</p>
<p>about it there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>researchers i forget the number but there was more than</p>
<p>three terrible</p>
<p>story and this</p>
<p>polar bear saw them</p>
<p>and kept diving off one ice</p>
<p>sculpture to the next getting closer and closer</p>
<p>sizing them up</p>
<p>until finally he was on the one ice</p>
<p>culture they</p>
<p>were jumping around</p>

<p>screaming the yelling the</p>
<p>polar bear didn&rsquo;t give a fuck he&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>ice sculpture of the ice island</p>
<p>right next to them</p>
<p>jumped in the</p>
<p>water got on</p>
<p>their side walked calmly up to the</p>
<p>first guy could get a hold of they scrambled everybody</p>
<p>stumbled over each</p>
<p>other trying to get out of the way</p>
<p>grabs a guy</p>
<p>kills him right there instantly</p>
<p>grabs his limp body</p>
<p>jumps off the ice</p>
<p>ice island into the</p>
<p>water swims over to the</p>
<p>other one just</p>

<p>fighting for a while</p>
<p>you know just</p>

<p>coast he doesn&rsquo;t need it he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need a bow and</p>
<p>arrow or anything else he</p>
<p>just does it he just runs so bad</p>
<p>motherfucker but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a big hunter he loves hunting so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take me somewhere we&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hunting tv show to do it with</p>
<p>whenever i&rsquo;m around i&rsquo;ve been around</p>
<p>randy couture</p>
<p>a couple of times and</p>
<p>and i whenever i&rsquo;m around a guy like that i always feel</p>
<p>a combination of just awe</p>
<p>and just i feel a little bad</p>
<p>about myself</p>
<p>well i always feel like</p>
<p>jesus you know</p>
<p>i always say we people say why don&rsquo;t you put in with me</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t want to and to because i&rsquo;m old</p>
<p>and then like and</p>
<p>brandy coutures</p>
<p>five years older than me</p>
<p>five years yeah don&rsquo;t be a</p>
<p>pussy joe there has been</p>
<p>never been combat athletes</p>
<p>into their late 40s before ever</p>
<p>never you never saw</p>
<p>that you never saw a</p>
<p>48 year old</p>
<p>guy it&rsquo;s a combination of a lot of</p>
<p>things a lot of its genetics too</p>
<p>because the guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never injured</p>
<p>which is crazy</p>
<p>you know you think</p>
<p>about all the</p>
<p>different kinds of cancer</p>
<p>their camps</p>
<p>sports science did a</p>
<p>thing where he&rsquo;s able to take the vo</p>
<p>like his vo</p>
<p>max is much higher like he&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to assimilate oxygen and his muscles much better than</p>
<p>than most people</p>
<p>well it makes</p>
<p>sense he&rsquo;s a lifelong athlete and he was always</p>
<p>known even in the</p>
<p>early early days of competing of just</p>
<p>breaking guys wills</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what he did to vitor</p>
<p>belfort he just imposed his will on vitor</p>
<p>and broke him</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing he fucked</p>
<p>up for a long time</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s relentless he keeps you go for the</p>
<p>double leg and a single leg</p>
<p>then and he</p>
<p>beats you up</p>
<p>against the cage to this was this machita fight</p>
<p>in toronto is</p>
<p>very interesting</p>
<p>because he really firmly believes</p>
<p>that machita</p>
<p>is fights on the outside but you can</p>
<p>grab a hold of them and when you grab a hold of them</p>
<p>randy thinks he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna pin him up</p>
<p>against the cage and beat the shit out of</p>
<p>randy coutures fighting</p>
<p>fighting machida bro</p>
<p>meanwhile he&rsquo;s doing like the expendables to he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>movies he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy fuck dude and he&rsquo;s trying to get hunting trips in</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go kill a bear</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m such a girl</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to be around</p>
<p>those guys it&rsquo;s good to know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>levels of manliness</p>
<p>out there well it&rsquo;s good to know that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>sports for a</p>
<p>young man are very important</p>
<p>because it teach you how</p>
<p>tough you&rsquo;re not how</p>
<p>tough you&rsquo;re not how</p>
<p>tough you are</p>
<p>but also how</p>
<p>tough you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>and you need to know both</p>
<p>sides and you</p>
<p>need to know what</p>
<p>other people are willing to go through the</p>
<p>kind of pain that some people are willing to go through</p>
<p>you gotta watch</p>
<p>a real life strength and conditioning program</p>
<p>you tell me you want to be an</p>
<p>mma fighter</p>
<p>go to the gym with sean shirk</p>
<p>just watch him do that once</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>cause i was 17 and i went to dan gable&rsquo;s intensive</p>
<p>wrestling camp with</p>
<p>the hawkeyes</p>
<p>and i remember limping</p>
<p>for two weeks i limped</p>
<p>wake you up at five in the morning and you run</p>
<p>sprints for an hour and then you do live</p>
<p>wrestling and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>wrestle in college</p>
<p>cause i went</p>
<p>if this is college athletics i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do it and what happened was i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>smell a mat and i&rsquo;d get my back would</p>
<p>start to hurt</p>
<p>i got a psychosomatic injury</p>
<p>all right my body was like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that i limped</p>
<p>the only time in my life i kept looking at my plane</p>
<p>ticket and i was</p>
<p>gonna fake an injury so i</p>
<p>could go home</p>
<p>high school</p>
<p>wrestling making a fucking man out of you</p>
<p>they closed</p>
<p>that camp down</p>
<p>because you had to</p>
<p>graduate and like a</p>
<p>third of the camp</p>
<p>would drop out</p>
<p>and literally</p>
<p>they closed down i believe the next year or the year</p>
<p>after that well</p>
<p>they also were really encouraging people to lose a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of weight</p>
<p>which was terrifying and really</p>
<p>fucking terrible</p>
<p>for you your</p>
<p>young body you</p>
<p>know when you&rsquo;re 14 15 years old and you&rsquo;re in high</p>
<p>school and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coach and you</p>
<p>already lean and they&rsquo;re telling you to lose 10</p>
<p>pounds of water</p>
<p>and you had to</p>
<p>wrestle that day</p>
<p>too it&rsquo;s not like the</p>
<p>ufc i did it too</p>
<p>it was awesome</p>
<p>i did it for taekwondo tournaments too it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>my friend did it his whole high</p>
<p>school career</p>
<p>like really</p>
<p>short where everyone else in his family is tall</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s five six</p>
<p>and everyone</p>
<p>else in his family is like six foot six foot two</p>
<p>starving yourself yeah he</p>
<p>starved himself all</p>
<p>through high</p>
<p>school through</p>
<p>every fucking</p>
<p>season because college is</p>
<p>worse man yeah and he</p>
<p>went to in the off</p>
<p>season he went to camps</p>
<p>and like he was like really trying to make it as a</p>
<p>wrestler boxers don&rsquo;t lose as much weight do they</p>
<p>cause they gotta go 12</p>
<p>rounds you also have</p>
<p>to take head blows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more dangerous when you take your head</p>
<p>blows yeah that&rsquo;s when people get really real serious</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>like gerald</p>
<p>mcclellan is a perfect example of that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a guy who used to</p>
<p>lose a lot of weight</p>
<p>to make his division i</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>light heavy weight</p>
<p>he was a big guy and he</p>
<p>would dehydrate himself really bad</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>about it the</p>
<p>right way and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if they used ivs</p>
<p>back in those days to rehydrate</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re pretty sophisticated about it</p>
<p>they always give guys bags of iv</p>
<p>like some guys will take six</p>
<p>seven eight bags oh really</p>
<p>yeah they have to rehydrate and they piss like crazy</p>
<p>but they feel much better much</p>
<p>quicker and you</p>
<p>gain a tremendous amount of weight in like</p>
<p>24 hour period like there&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>glace and t bow</p>
<p>fights in ufc i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>he loses the weight i don&rsquo;t know what he does but this</p>
<p>motherfucker fights at</p>
<p>155 and he looks like he&rsquo;s like 190 he&rsquo;s fucking huge</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>anthony johnson</p>
<p>yeah he walks two</p>
<p>fifteen yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two fifteen</p>
<p>i wonder he was</p>
<p>fighting one seventy</p>
<p>again fuck one</p>
<p>seventy when i was i was doing a</p>
<p>movie with him in pittsburgh and he walked around with</p>
<p>these shoulders</p>
<p>i was like this dude and he&rsquo;s to i said how much you</p>
<p>weigh goes two fifteen i go</p>
<p>how are you</p>
<p>gonna get out the one</p>
<p>seventy he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>no problem got it</p>
<p>done with science i was like i don&rsquo;t know how the</p>
<p>fuck his head&rsquo;s that big he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enormous his bones yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a super athlete that guy is</p>
<p>fucking that&rsquo;s a guy when you</p>
<p>stand around you feel like just such a wimp you just</p>
<p>yeah and he&rsquo;s an interesting guy too because he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wrestler but he&rsquo;s really been working</p>
<p>primarily on his</p>
<p>striking you</p>
<p>know and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>knocking a lot of guys out</p>
<p>that was a big</p>
<p>victory for costcheck when costcheck beat him</p>
<p>i think a lot of that guy&rsquo;s problem is that he</p>
<p>gets really depleted making that 170</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;d be better served at</p>
<p>185 i think a lot of guys</p>
<p>would i think</p>
<p>a lot of guys lose too much weight and i</p>
<p>think over the</p>
<p>long course of a career it&rsquo;s very dangerous</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very unhealthy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re allowed to say but is there</p>
<p>gonna be a gsp</p>
<p>anderson silver fight</p>
<p>they want to do that but gsp has to get through jake</p>
<p>shields which is no fucking cakewalk</p>
<p>jake shields is dangerous as fuck and he&rsquo;s a winner</p>
<p>and his jiu</p>
<p>jitsu is top notch</p>
<p>jake shields can</p>
<p>submit anybody</p>
<p>but did gsp has proved that he is</p>
<p>still far in a way</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a bad motherfucker no doubt</p>
<p>about it but</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t discount jake</p>
<p>shields gsp&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never fought jake</p>
<p>shields i&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>jake shields look he</p>
<p>might be it gsp</p>
<p>might be able to keep the foot on his feet</p>
<p>and if he does</p>
<p>gsp is more than likely gonna</p>
<p>like be far better on his feet</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got way better</p>
<p>striking way better hands way better kicks than jake</p>
<p>jake is just all</p>
<p>about closing the distance</p>
<p>getting a hold of</p>
<p>you and drag you to the ground and if you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s in some</p>
<p>trouble he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get boxed up but</p>
<p>but if he can do that it becomes very interesting</p>
<p>it becomes very interesting cause</p>
<p>jake shields has competed at the very highest</p>
<p>levels of the game in grappling</p>
<p>and submitted</p>
<p>guys in fact in abu dhabi that submitted gsp</p>
<p>his level of</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is</p>
<p>quite a bit higher</p>
<p>but george is so</p>
<p>smart and he&rsquo;s so defensively</p>
<p>intelligent and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been submitted in</p>
<p>mma before no so</p>
<p>at least not he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also punching</p>
<p>yeah and elbowing you and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strong as fuck and his</p>
<p>wrestling is</p>
<p>outstanding too yeah they say i&rsquo;ve talked to guys who</p>
<p>train with him and they say that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just he&rsquo;s really really</p>
<p>strong yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super him well he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>great strength and he&rsquo;s also like really</p>
<p>smart and he does</p>
<p>things correctly and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>super driven like</p>
<p>i told you we worked on that turning sidekick thing</p>
<p>he talked to me</p>
<p>afterwards like</p>
<p>joe i practiced it a thousand time</p>
<p>i was on this set they were like this guy&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m kicking the bag i&rsquo;m telling you man i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get it like he was</p>
<p>like obsessed with it like if you show him a technique</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll go over and go over and next</p>
<p>thing you do it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll probably be doing it better than you who</p>
<p>taught him you know what&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>about that is</p>
<p>you see these people who are</p>
<p>great and they do</p>
<p>these things and you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s magic they just work harder than</p>
<p>everybody else</p>
<p>obsession and repetition</p>
<p>and you know the same desire that gets you</p>
<p>far in life with that</p>
<p>can also fuck you up if you get addicted to everquest</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s the same sort of obsession</p>
<p>can wind you up in a</p>
<p>ditch if it becomes something that&rsquo;s not productive</p>
<p>for me i have</p>
<p>to and i know you&rsquo;re probably the same way i</p>
<p>have to manage my addictions i have to be real careful</p>
<p>and keep an eye</p>
<p>on i&rsquo;m not as</p>
<p>intense as you are that way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve always been really really</p>
<p>obsessive well it&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even a discipline</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of an obsession i&rsquo;m disciplined</p>
<p>kinda i mean i get</p>
<p>things done i&rsquo;m disciplined</p>
<p>but what i really am is driven</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>difference if i find something like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not good at doing</p>
<p>things i don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not good at taking out the garbage i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>good at remembering to do errands</p>
<p>things that i&rsquo;m supposed to do i&rsquo;m not good at</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s something i&rsquo;m excited</p>
<p>about there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>motivated about</p>
<p>then i become obsessed with it and then i become driven</p>
<p>to get good at whatever the fuck this</p>
<p>thing is so it&rsquo;s not even like a discipline</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s fine i just know how to turn on</p>
<p>the crazy switch</p>
<p>yeah you do you&rsquo;re really really good</p>
<p>but you gotta manage that shit man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they get into gambling and then they become fucking</p>
<p>crazy with blackjack or poker</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always been really</p>
<p>grateful that i didn&rsquo;t have the kind of wiring that was</p>
<p>predisposed to</p>
<p>the kind of</p>
<p>negative obsessions like that</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>self deprecating enough to the</p>
<p>point where you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to constantly be the best guy in the room</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you can have a good time no matter what no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>enjoyed my friends</p>
<p>successes i&rsquo;ve always thought yeah i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>found it more inspiring than threatening i</p>
<p>never i just</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like intelligence it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like trying to compartmentalize anything you know well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re a healthy dude too that&rsquo;s why but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like courage</p>
<p>you know some people say well i&rsquo;m a coward well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a coward</p>
<p>maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t get up on</p>
<p>stage and do</p>
<p>stand up you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>fight six guys in a bar</p>
<p>and intelligence or</p>
<p>talent it&rsquo;s all the same</p>
<p>stuff you&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>you know some</p>
<p>people you just have to find what you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>at find your</p>
<p>shit what&rsquo;s your role</p>
<p>it might be to</p>
<p>support talented people</p>
<p>it might be to be the one on</p>
<p>stage it might be the one who comes up with a</p>
<p>microphone that you use</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s club owners there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>managers there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>agents comics if</p>
<p>you have children</p>
<p>i think your job is to try to nudge that</p>
<p>child in the</p>
<p>direction of what he&rsquo;s supposed to do anyway</p>
<p>yeah whatever his primal impulses are you</p>
<p>know you contemplate i mean you have kids now are you</p>
<p>actively thinking</p>
<p>about that are your daughters</p>
<p>my daughter</p>
<p>and what i try to do with my</p>
<p>daughter is provide</p>
<p>two things one</p>
<p>is love unconditional love so she&rsquo;s not messed up but</p>
<p>i also believe</p>
<p>that a large part of my job is</p>
<p>to stand out of the way not</p>
<p>to be a suppressive overwhelming personality for her</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to be too much of an influence</p>
<p>and the reason i don&rsquo;t want is i want her to</p>
<p>ultimately i think a</p>
<p>great deal comes from having to</p>
<p>be independent and also feeling free enough and not</p>
<p>ashamed of whatever it is you are</p>
<p>and so much of my</p>
<p>childhood and it&rsquo;s not nobody&rsquo;s fault</p>
<p>but so much of my</p>
<p>childhood is</p>
<p>when i think back on it even my</p>
<p>young adult in years is</p>
<p>full of kind of but what i</p>
<p>would describe is</p>
<p>shame i mean describe certainly as confusion but also</p>
<p>shame just also</p>
<p>god i feel so different than most people</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a fuck up and i got to get my shit together</p>
<p>well no i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i actually had to just go deeper into that and so</p>
<p>well to be a</p>
<p>performer yes but if you were a car salesman yeah you</p>
<p>would have had a problem sure but i&rsquo;m saying yeah</p>
<p>you know i mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re lucky that this avenue</p>
<p>exists absolutely</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just saying you</p>
<p>gotta find whatever your avenue is</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>that you know people say well everybody has</p>
<p>a path i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that but</p>
<p>your job as a</p>
<p>young adult as a</p>
<p>child is to try</p>
<p>maybe everybody</p>
<p>could have a path</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that everybody does</p>
<p>maybe that everybody</p>
<p>could yeah but</p>
<p>you also you said something really profound i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>thinking about a lot</p>
<p>lately that i thought was really cool you said it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing to be really accomplished and you&rsquo;ve accomplished</p>
<p>things you know</p>
<p>we can go through all the stuff but</p>
<p>but the one</p>
<p>thing you said that you&rsquo;re the most</p>
<p>proud of is accomplishing your</p>
<p>peace of mind</p>
<p>and that is a very separate</p>
<p>separate endeavor</p>
<p>from trying to make</p>
<p>money and trying to make a name for</p>
<p>yourself trying to be significant trying to be original</p>
<p>but actually</p>
<p>getting to a</p>
<p>point where you have</p>
<p>peace of mind</p>
<p>i think is equally as important</p>
<p>as anything it&rsquo;s more important than anything it is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m happier now than i&rsquo;ve ever been at any</p>
<p>point in my life and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m also nicer to people now than at any</p>
<p>point ever in my own life</p>
<p>and more conscious</p>
<p>about biological</p>
<p>maintenance</p>
<p>making sure</p>
<p>i work out on a regular basis making sure i&rsquo;m healthy</p>
<p>all those things together with my life</p>
<p>i figured out a</p>
<p>way changed in some</p>
<p>ways your personality in a way i mean you&rsquo;ve changed</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve actually made</p>
<p>fundamental changes</p>
<p>in how you relate to</p>
<p>other human beings i&rsquo;ve seen that in you</p>
<p>a lot of that is</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>and the tank</p>
<p>the tank whatever</p>
<p>it is it&rsquo;s a combination you did the tank recently</p>
<p>yeah it was awesome tell me about this</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll end with this</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;ve been talking for a long time but</p>
<p>tell me what your</p>
<p>experience was like i got into</p>
<p>the salt water</p>
<p>and it was really dark and</p>
<p>i just by the way</p>
<p>for people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know this is a sensory deprivation tank we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about yeah and i thought two</p>
<p>things i thought one i was</p>
<p>gonna go restless and i thought the</p>
<p>other thing i was</p>
<p>gonna get cold</p>
<p>and then i thought i was</p>
<p>gonna sink and on</p>
<p>and in fact</p>
<p>i started to just</p>
<p>focus on my breath and</p>
<p>sort of it was very easy for me to kind of disappear</p>
<p>for real and</p>
<p>i think i stayed in there for two</p>
<p>hours but i</p>
<p>could have stayed in there way longer</p>
<p>way longer people say you know</p>
<p>he said i think the guy said</p>
<p>you know 15 minutes</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>might be in there for an hour but it</p>
<p>might be hard</p>
<p>for me i could have</p>
<p>i could have just stayed in there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an amazing environment isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>yeah you need to get one of those</p>
<p>we all need that</p>
<p>well you live</p>
<p>in the area</p>
<p>so you can go yeah you can go to that</p>
<p>place all the time but</p>
<p>man having one of your</p>
<p>houses is this shit how</p>
<p>often you change that</p>
<p>water you don&rsquo;t have to you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only me that goes in and it&rsquo;s 800</p>
<p>pounds of salt nothing can live</p>
<p>in there that&rsquo;s amazing yeah it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s so dense</p>
<p>yeah it is just like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most valuable program ever</p>
<p>or the valuable tool ever</p>
<p>for reprogramming your mind for looking at yourself</p>
<p>and in a truly objective way and to be tethered</p>
<p>untethered rather from your life untethered from</p>
<p>your personal</p>
<p>experiences and able to look at them</p>
<p>literally when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re inside that tank it feels like you&rsquo;re not there</p>
<p>it feels like</p>
<p>time has essentially stopped</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting any input</p>
<p>it might be</p>
<p>going on without you all</p>
<p>rambling free in the</p>
<p>world but in your life</p>
<p>your life is all</p>
<p>about how you relate to</p>
<p>everything that you see in your environment</p>
<p>so having a</p>
<p>chance to be out of your environment the only</p>
<p>opportunity</p>
<p>that you have in the</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the only environment on the planet like that</p>
<p>where you can go and separate yourself</p>
<p>literally from your life now</p>
<p>watch yourself</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a sensory deprivation tank</p>
<p>which was created by a</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>pioneer from the 50s name</p>
<p>john lilley</p>
<p>who was this</p>
<p>brilliant scientist</p>
<p>who was incredibly eccentric and one of the</p>
<p>things he wanted to figure out was</p>
<p>how to detach</p>
<p>himself from his physical</p>
<p>inputs of sound and feeling and and seeing</p>
<p>things and how to figure out how to get the mind</p>
<p>literally away from any</p>
<p>input of the body</p>
<p>he realized that life is very distracting and that</p>
<p>conversations</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re having if there&rsquo;s a bus driving by</p>
<p>right next to you it&rsquo;s hard to have that conversation</p>
<p>the bus is distracting</p>
<p>things input is distracting and</p>
<p>when you are in the tank you are</p>
<p>literally dealing with no input</p>
<p>you have no hearing because your ears are</p>
<p>underwater and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>heavy door that&rsquo;s shut and it&rsquo;s pretty soundproof</p>
<p>you have no</p>
<p>scene because you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>total blackness</p>
<p>you total complete darkness</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel anything because the</p>
<p>water is the same temperature as your skin</p>
<p>and the water has 800</p>
<p>pounds of salt in it so you</p>
<p>completely buoyant</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most amazing environment man it goes into that really</p>
<p>was that i think therefore i am right</p>
<p>descartes yeah</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s always been disputed in the</p>
<p>sense that because you can imagine it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean indeed that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually there well then because</p>
<p>the question is</p>
<p>what is the imagination</p>
<p>this is the real question is what is</p>
<p>the imagination and our thoughts really non local and</p>
<p>are you really just a</p>
<p>biological antenna that like</p>
<p>picks up entropy in the air that picks up</p>
<p>creativity and ideas and</p>
<p>things and these are</p>
<p>literally woven into the fabric</p>
<p>of time all around us you know what that</p>
<p>great mathematician</p>
<p>when the fields</p>
<p>medal said right he refused the</p>
<p>fields medal</p>
<p>which is a million dollar</p>
<p>prize i believe and it&rsquo;s like the nobel</p>
<p>prize for mathematics they couldn&rsquo;t find him</p>
<p>found him in siberia a</p>
<p>year later and he goes why are you giving me the prize</p>
<p>you should be giving the equation</p>
<p>a prize i just</p>
<p>have i just have antenna i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wired a certain way</p>
<p>and i was able to channel</p>
<p>the answer i</p>
<p>think it was a</p>
<p>350 page answer they&rsquo;ve been looking at</p>
<p>they even the problem had been</p>
<p>conjectured in like 1806 and they were trying</p>
<p>the actual problem</p>
<p>then he came up with the answer and all</p>
<p>these mathematicians</p>
<p>were like this guy actually figured it out</p>
<p>after 300 years</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just incrediably</p>
<p>and he goes yeah yeah but</p>
<p>what are you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving the prize</p>
<p>to the radio</p>
<p>you should be giving it to the</p>
<p>music they all say that</p>
<p>every artist says that</p>
<p>every great writer says that they tune into the</p>
<p>muse i love</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what makes me</p>
<p>believe in any kind of god or whatever you</p>
<p>wanna call it</p>
<p>a higher benevolent</p>
<p>force of some kind or at</p>
<p>least something of beauty</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yeah what was my point</p>
<p>that we what is imagination</p>
<p>well what yeah</p>
<p>thank you this is</p>
<p>my point was</p>
<p>the idea of</p>
<p>imagination is very strange because you have this idea</p>
<p>you have this</p>
<p>thing that comes to your mind wait a</p>
<p>minute if i do this and combine it with that holy shit</p>
<p>i just made a new invention</p>
<p>this is gonna be</p>
<p>this is gonna revolutionize</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve done is</p>
<p>with this thing in the ether</p>
<p>you have pulled it out of that and now it manifests</p>
<p>itself in a physical form and alters human life</p>
<p>it changes life like all the</p>
<p>things that people have invented they had to initially</p>
<p>think up whether it&rsquo;s the car whether it&rsquo;s computers or</p>
<p>this had to</p>
<p>be a thought in someone&rsquo;s mind a creative idea</p>
<p>or a conglomeration of</p>
<p>other ideas that have</p>
<p>existed before that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a combinatory</p>
<p>thing and they combine it and make some new creative</p>
<p>thing whatever the imagination is it eventually</p>
<p>manifests itself as an actual thing</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t look at that for</p>
<p>some reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s frivolous</p>
<p>imagination is also</p>
<p>way more important</p>
<p>than what you consider intelligence or amassing</p>
<p>information imagination is what moves history forward</p>
<p>it gutenberg innovation</p>
<p>well gutenberg when he came up with a</p>
<p>printing press</p>
<p>even freud when he came up with the concept that you</p>
<p>could figure out how the</p>
<p>human mind works einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity</p>
<p>newton&rsquo;s calculus</p>
<p>these guys who were</p>
<p>these seminal thinkers</p>
<p>who came up with</p>
<p>even karl marx for that matter i&rsquo;m not a communist but</p>
<p>these guys who came up with</p>
<p>these sort of seminal concepts of</p>
<p>how to restructure</p>
<p>our society how to restructure our biology</p>
<p>how to restructure our minds how to look at our minds</p>
<p>all those things</p>
<p>from the imagination</p>
<p>it all came</p>
<p>from imagination and we leapt</p>
<p>forward in some ways not in a good way in some</p>
<p>ways we came up with the atomic bomb well yeah i mean i</p>
<p>split the atom but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all the same</p>
<p>thing right it&rsquo;s all people and you know whatever</p>
<p>branch of study that they choose to pursue</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>they create</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right and it</p>
<p>becomes an actual physical</p>
<p>thing but what</p>
<p>is the imagination that&rsquo;s making that happen</p>
<p>is it like a life form and what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point yes and also what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point is it the diagram</p>
<p>the map of the universe that we&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to follow we brought this podcast full circle cause</p>
<p>we started with that question</p>
<p>and we end with that question</p>
<p>who knows better</p>
<p>to have imagination kids this is our message</p>
<p>folks just be fucking nice</p>
<p>to people if we all were cool if everybody was like</p>
<p>the people in this room</p>
<p>right now if the</p>
<p>whole world was made out of us</p>
<p>and we just ran into us</p>
<p>everywhere i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so egocentric and</p>
<p>ridiculous to say</p>
<p>but the mindset</p>
<p>of what i&rsquo;m talking about just</p>
<p>be cool to people</p>
<p>just be nice you know what the problem is</p>
<p>sometimes competition</p>
<p>is the problem not only that sometimes</p>
<p>jelly has an idea that they</p>
<p>think is better for you</p>
<p>so example the</p>
<p>board of the board of</p>
<p>certain people in kansas say</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start</p>
<p>teaching intelligent design</p>
<p>and not evolution</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>teach your child that</p>
<p>for his soul</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden you go wait a</p>
<p>minute you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to be nice to me but i don&rsquo;t want that kind of nice</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>wrong kind of nice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about people not fucking with</p>
<p>other people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>try to control</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>worry about yourself</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just so many of us</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many of us it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to get this all across but i firmly believe that we</p>
<p>right now are more</p>
<p>advanced more in tune</p>
<p>more tuned in</p>
<p>than any other</p>
<p>generation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever been before and a lot of it is because of</p>
<p>stuff like this</p>
<p>a lot of it is because of the podcasts internet</p>
<p>things you can read</p>
<p>the access to information all</p>
<p>these things we&rsquo;re communicating in a way</p>
<p>with twitter</p>
<p>and with facebook that no one&rsquo;s ever done before i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re connected the way we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been before</p>
<p>in real time yeah</p>
<p>these things that we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>pushing together</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating time and i</p>
<p>think human beings</p>
<p>culturally are</p>
<p>evolving at</p>
<p>an incredible race</p>
<p>at an incredible pace rather exponential in a way</p>
<p>technology certainly</p>
<p>is yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the nuttiest</p>
<p>thing about all this</p>
<p>2012 nonsense is fuck</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pointing towards that being real</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pointing towards all</p>
<p>these fucking events happening and people</p>
<p>changing and technology</p>
<p>accelerated at an incredible pace and we talked</p>
<p>about earlier</p>
<p>about the center of</p>
<p>every galaxy being a</p>
<p>black hole and we were talking about that</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re trying to do with the</p>
<p>large hadron collider they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>black holes</p>
<p>so if the center of</p>
<p>every galaxy is a</p>
<p>black hole and inside that</p>
<p>black hole is</p>
<p>a universe and then they&rsquo;re making universes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very good yeah</p>
<p>like what the fuck somebody put the</p>
<p>breaks on that we are butterflies</p>
<p>and we are on our way to being the next</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>there was a caterpillar that became a butterfly</p>
<p>and that is the</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>if you want an actually</p>
<p>great lecture on that it&rsquo;s called homo evalutis</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s by one enriquez</p>
<p>and go to ted com</p>
<p>and one enriquez</p>
<p>will take you through a</p>
<p>lecture called homo aveludice and he talks</p>
<p>about how we&rsquo;re coming out with</p>
<p>for example eyes</p>
<p>that right now can see</p>
<p>shadow and light</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna pretty much</p>
<p>presume be able to see</p>
<p>underwater and in dark for a mile away</p>
<p>and eventually here&rsquo;s that can hear a mile</p>
<p>away just close all that</p>
<p>stuff and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna become</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start to become machine</p>
<p>part machine as we come</p>
<p>up with biocompatible components way faster than we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna ever evolve into the</p>
<p>whatever else we&rsquo;re supposed to biologically</p>
<p>i know people already that have artificial hips</p>
<p>i know a couple</p>
<p>people and dude my hip</p>
<p>starts clicking now your hips</p>
<p>are fucked up</p>
<p>my hip on this side really hurts sometimes when i move</p>
<p>the wrong try being a top</p>
