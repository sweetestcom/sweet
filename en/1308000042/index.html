<p>10 grand each. So 30 grand 30 grand to Tucker Carlson for</p>
<p>President DeSantis 2024.</p>
<p>I said charity asshole.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to your favorite</p>
<p>podcast, the all in podcast where we talk about the economy,</p>
<p>technology, politics, and, well, basically anything that&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>news. With us today, again, the Queen of quinoa himself, David</p>
<p>Friedberg. How are you doing, David? I&rsquo;m hanging in there</p>
<p>today. All right, people are looking for the dog. Where&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>dog? Monty? He&rsquo;s sitting here on the floor. Monty. Come on.</p>
<p>Come here. Come on, Monty. All right. And from a random palace</p>
<p>somewhere in the world. The dictator himself Chamath</p>
<p>Palihapitiya. How you doing? See?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing great. You know, I got another dog.</p>
<p>While you were in Italy.</p>
<p>I went to the breeder that I got Aki from and she had a three</p>
<p>year old that was not really, you know, ever gonna become a</p>
<p>breeding dog or whatever. So I adopted the three year old. He</p>
<p>has a parasite. So he&rsquo;s been pooing everywhere, everywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great information for the cold over the all over the</p>
<p>castle, all over the castle. Fantastic. liquid poop, by the</p>
<p>way. But we finally diagnosed it today. And he&rsquo;s going to the to</p>
<p>the vet to get some liquids and to get the parasite expunged</p>
<p>from his body.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you for that information. I don&rsquo;t know where</p>
<p>is you? Nobody cares. How you were doing. I thought you were</p>
<p>just gonna say great. I didn&rsquo;t know we were gonna go straight</p>
<p>to diarrhea.</p>
<p>We got a new dog to you did. It&rsquo;s awesome. It&rsquo;s been kind of</p>
<p>a disaster. The kids were like that. We found this like, I</p>
<p>think, you know, golden, that is really calm. You know, like,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just super low energy and calm. It&rsquo;s like perfect for us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know. I think that&rsquo;s just like the puppies</p>
<p>kind of asleep, you know, like, it&rsquo;s gonna wake up. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, No, no, no, no, this is like a special dog. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really well behaved, whatever. So anyway, we get it. Sure</p>
<p>enough, like, a week later, the puppy wakes up. And she&rsquo;s eating</p>
<p>everything in the house destroying everything. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Yeah, so now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>with that dog number two or three for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dog two with the dog one was a rescue dog who&rsquo;s great. So</p>
<p>dog number two is now getting trained.</p>
<p>All right, David Sacks is with us, of course, the Raymond</p>
<p>himself, and in related dog stories, I put all the girls to</p>
<p>bed and then I hear screaming, I get up, I run outside,</p>
<p>literally, the new bulldog who&rsquo;s nine months old Maximus went on,</p>
<p>you know, one of his running fits, one of my daughters falls</p>
<p>out of bed, gets like a bruise on her, like lower back, and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s wailing. The other daughter feels terrible about</p>
<p>it. And then the dog decides that he is going to projectile</p>
<p>vomit everywhere. All at the same time. You guys have had</p>
<p>these moments where like, it&rsquo;s just complete utter chaos. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chaos, chaos, chaos, it&rsquo;s cat dogs plus kids equals chaos. So</p>
<p>but would any of us have it any other way? I love the combo of</p>
<p>dogs and kids. It&rsquo;s just the best. It&rsquo;s pretty great. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dogs are amazing. Especially when you bring in a new dog or a</p>
<p>puppy into the house. It&rsquo;s chaos, but it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>beautiful chaos.</p>
<p>Well, you know what I think also is like, think about how</p>
<p>overrated everything in life is people like, Oh my god, this</p>
<p>place with the pasta in Italy, it&rsquo;s the greatest life changing</p>
<p>thing. And all this movie was incredible. It&rsquo;s the best movie</p>
<p>ever made. And it&rsquo;s never the best movie ever made or the best</p>
<p>past ever. It&rsquo;s great or whatever. But I think kids and</p>
<p>dogs are underrated. universally</p>
<p>have as many kids as you can possibly biologically have and</p>
<p>can economically afford is my one opinion. And the more dogs</p>
<p>the better.</p>
<p>I love dogs. Yeah. All right. I think we should start with the</p>
<p>COVID cases, because this is impacting everything from the</p>
<p>economy, to people&rsquo;s decisions, touching on people&rsquo;s freedoms.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to know where to start here. But I think facts</p>
<p>are always a good place to start. Here in the United</p>
<p>States, we had gotten COVID cases, you know, to that 12,000</p>
<p>a day average, it was pretty amazing. And it looked like it</p>
<p>was going to go straight down smooth sailing. And we had had</p>
<p>deaths down at around, I saw some seven day averages, where</p>
<p>we were at 150 200. Now, the weekends are kind of weird, in</p>
<p>terms of reporting, but the seven day average today is at</p>
<ol start="248">
<li>In other words, it&rsquo;s been flat for a month when you do</li>
</ol>
<p>this. And this is according to the New York Times statistics</p>
<p>and Google, you can search for Google, and you&rsquo;ll find these</p>
<p>have some great data that they&rsquo;ll just put right in the</p>
<p>search result. However, cases have gone from this 1215 k a day</p>
<p>average, soaring in just 30 days to 62,000 a day and a seven day</p>
<p>average of 40,000. So we&rsquo;re basically tripled the number of</p>
<p>cases, cases trail traditionally deaths by something in the</p>
<p>neighborhood of 10 days. I think I&rsquo;m correct, Friedberg.</p>
<p>So what do you think is actually going to happen here? We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to we&rsquo;re going to get up to 10 100,000 200,000 cases a</p>
<p>day, and maybe double the number of deaths from the people who</p>
<p>are not vaccinated? Yeah, you know, the current logic on this</p>
<p>is that there will be because of the number of people that are</p>
<p>generally infected and are spreading what is now an even</p>
<p>more infectious variant of COVID. The people that are not</p>
<p>vaccinated are starting to get it at a higher rate. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the deaths are starting to come from. So yeah, we will see</p>
<p>deaths climb. And I think like we talked about last time, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to see even Gavin did an interview yesterday in</p>
<p>California talking about how, you know, there it&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>table that we may go back to certain restrictions, behavioral</p>
<p>restrictions, mask mandates, etc. So there&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>set of reactions. And I think as we talked about last time, we</p>
<p>saw the market start to react to the potential of that on Monday.</p>
<p>And then very interestingly, kind of reverse course, Tuesday</p>
<p>and everything came back when everyone was freaked out on</p>
<p>Monday after they saw the weekend&rsquo;s data, which showed</p>
<p>that cases are climbing like crazy in the US. But I think the</p>
<p>conventional wisdom is not that many people are going to die.</p>
<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;re not going to see, you know, political</p>
<p>leaders, force restrictions that are kind of going to damage the</p>
<p>economy. And we&rsquo;re going to start to walk what I think</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s calling the golden line, which is balancing the</p>
<p>economy with the the health of the citizenry. So. So, you</p>
<p>know, we&rsquo;ll see, it&rsquo;s going to come down to policy. But I think</p>
<p>from a desk perspective, there will absolutely be a rise in</p>
<p>deaths now as unvaccinated people are the going to be the</p>
<p>bulk of those deaths. And, and this thing is spreading again</p>
<p>amongst people that haven&rsquo;t been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Well, and then sacks, this becomes now a great Rorschach</p>
<p>test of what do you see in this data? And in this moment,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a pandemic, as many people are saying, now, I think</p>
<p>this is becoming the meme or the catchphrase, it&rsquo;s a pandemic of</p>
<p>the unvaccinated. So people have chosen to opt into this</p>
<p>pandemic, and then a group of us have chosen to not be part of</p>
<p>it, you were part of it, even as a vaccinated person, but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling great. You&rsquo;re back to 100%. So what do you think</p>
<p>should happen in terms of closings, or shutdowns, or mask</p>
<p>mandates? What&rsquo;s your take on the pandemic of the</p>
<p>unvaccinated?</p>
<p>Well, I think we need to differentiate between public</p>
<p>policy and private behavior. So, you know, after last week&rsquo;s</p>
<p>episode, where I said, you know, Delta variants real, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a huge spike in cases. Unfortunately, I thought we had</p>
<p>this thing whipped, you know, a few weeks ago, now, I think the</p>
<p>data is showing something different. You know, everyone,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of commenters saying, sacks, you&rsquo;ve turned,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been blue pilled. No, it&rsquo;s, you know, I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a difference between acknowledging what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>and then having the the policy conversation around it. I think</p>
<p>the difference now from last year, I mean, there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>of things. One is that we do have vaccines. So I think for</p>
<p>most people getting vaccinated will take the worst risks off</p>
<p>the table. The other is we know so much more about what works</p>
<p>and what doesn&rsquo;t work. And so lockdowns don&rsquo;t work. If you</p>
<p>know, if they ever did, they, they, they, we now know, looking</p>
<p>at from what different states did last year, that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make a difference. So there&rsquo;s no reason to go back to that</p>
<p>policy. But also, I mean, I would even say on mass, it</p>
<p>should be</p>
<p>well, do we know that? I mean, is that I think so sure of that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. Because the thing that the government</p>
<p>planners never take into account is that private citizens are</p>
<p>going to adjust their behavior in both directions. So in</p>
<p>Florida, they didn&rsquo;t have mandates, but people who are at</p>
<p>risk took, you know, extreme precautions, they would either</p>
<p>lock themselves down or be very fastidious about wearing a high</p>
<p>quality mask. By contrast, in California, we had the most</p>
<p>severe lockdowns, but they were never really feasible. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 10 pages of exceptions, people didn&rsquo;t really abide by</p>
<p>them. And then on top of it, you know, you have all these mass</p>
<p>mandates. But if somebody wears like a sock, loosely affixed to</p>
<p>their face, does that really protect them? You know, so, you</p>
<p>know, people, if they&rsquo;re, if they&rsquo;re not interested in</p>
<p>complying with these mandates, they do it in a half hearted</p>
<p>way. I&rsquo;m not convinced that the mandates work in the first</p>
<p>place. So the smart thing to do here is just to have</p>
<p>recommendations and let private citizens decide what their</p>
<p>response is going to be. We know now so much more about the risks</p>
<p>that we all face than we did a year ago. And so just let</p>
<p>private citizens decide. I mean, I&rsquo;d even say on on</p>
<p>vaccines, I mean, look, I&rsquo;m pro vax, I don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>where the anti vax people are coming from. But I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>done wasting my breath trying to convince people to get</p>
<p>vaccinated. You know, on this show, who don&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>vaccinated, you know, if they don&rsquo;t want to send those doses</p>
<p>to the developing world, where they&rsquo;re desperate for them.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, Chamath, do you do you agree with saxes</p>
<p>position that listen, citizens are just going to have to make</p>
<p>their own decision here, leave everything open. And let&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>have the economy collapse again. And people, people are</p>
<p>smart enough to make their own decision. And is this framing of</p>
<p>this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, the correct</p>
<p>framing? Wow, I&rsquo;m really of two minds. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s the part</p>
<p>of me that says that you have to give people the right to make</p>
<p>their own decision. The problem is that in this specific case,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much transmissibility. And as a</p>
<p>result of that, how this thing can mutate, that I think that</p>
<p>public health has to take a priority over any individual</p>
<p>individuals rights in this very specific narrow, narrow case,</p>
<p>because the delta variant is so transmission, transmissible,</p>
<p>people are going to have to lose some freedoms is one of those</p>
<p>showing a vaccine card when you go to an arena that you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need that if everybody was vaccinated, or you had to go</p>
<p>through a lot of hoops to be unvaccinated as an example. I</p>
<p>mean, and the reason is because the longer you allow this thing</p>
<p>to float around in the Petri dish of the unvaccinated, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>increasing everybody&rsquo;s risk. And this is where I think individual</p>
<p>freedoms as long as as a trample on collective freedom, then I</p>
<p>think live and let live. But I think on this specific issue, I</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s unconscionable to be in a</p>
<p>situation where we are fighting basically a time function, where</p>
<p>at a certain amount of time, you&rsquo;re going to have a variant</p>
<p>that that is, you know, basically will overcome all the</p>
<p>vaccines we have will kill enormous numbers of people,</p>
<p>including the vaccinated will literally shut the economy down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a probabilistic event now. And I don&rsquo;t like the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m susceptible to that because of a bunch of people who</p>
<p>frankly, aren&rsquo;t doing it for medical or religious reasons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just watching Fox News and just spouting off.</p>
<p>I agree that we&rsquo;re at risk there. But we&rsquo;re also at risk</p>
<p>from accident and vaccinated people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So Delta variant came from India, the lambda variant, I</p>
<p>think the wrong came from Peru. I mean, the fact of the matter</p>
<p>is unvaccinated people everywhere are potential Petri</p>
<p>dish for the virus. So I&rsquo;d rather I mean, this is why we</p>
<p>need to send those unused doses that by the way, are at risk of</p>
<p>expiring. We now I mean, there was a tweet about this recently,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s huge stockpiles of vaccine in the US are going to</p>
<p>waste right now. We should ship those anywhere in the world that</p>
<p>people are ready to get back</p>
<p>specifically to Mexico and Canada and Canada&rsquo;s I think this</p>
<p>month going to even though we got off to a massive headstart</p>
<p>going to eclipse us in terms of the percentage of accident, let</p>
<p>me ask it more pointedly, should a teacher should teachers</p>
<p>be public school teachers be forced to be vaccinated? Should</p>
<p>you be forced to have a vaccine card to get on public</p>
<p>transportation, airplanes, or, you know, take buses, you know,</p>
<p>long haul buses, long haul trains. And then third, should</p>
<p>you be forced to show a vaccine card to get on to go to sporting</p>
<p>events or concerts, let&rsquo;s go through those three. So your</p>
<p>personal freedom ends, you&rsquo;re going to be forced if you want</p>
<p>to go to group behaviors, if you want to participate in a public</p>
<p>construct, if you want to consume a public resource, or if</p>
<p>you want to provide a publicly funded good, then it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>broader public&rsquo;s rights that are superior to your individual</p>
<p>rights. Otherwise, work at a charter school where it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>required, watch the fucking concert from home, or drive your</p>
<p>car, use a bicycle or take an Uber.</p>
<p>The end. So what do you think? And then Freeberg?</p>
<p>So I understand that argument, I would differentiate between</p>
<p>public and private requirements, because I don&rsquo;t like the idea of</p>
<p>giving government the power to forcibly stick a needle in your</p>
<p>arm. So</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re not said you could stay home where you could take</p>
<p>your bicycle. Sure. So is that a reasonable that you don&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>go to a Warriors game because you&rsquo;re unvaccinated?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you know, the Warriors stadium is privately</p>
<p>owned, the team is private. So I think the I think that private</p>
<p>companies should be able to set up their own rules for the</p>
<p>benefit of their employees and</p>
<p>customers about airlines, because that is, you know, a</p>
<p>gate. It&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a limited number of them. Yeah, I think</p>
<p>so. Airlines should be able to force it. Now, what about school</p>
<p>teachers?</p>
<p>Should they can&rsquo;t they can&rsquo;t force it, but they can set the</p>
<p>requirements for you to board their planes.</p>
<p>You know, okay, now, what about public schools? Should, if</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do teachers and students? Should teachers be forced to get</p>
<p>a vaccine if they want to come in? Because you said if they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t come to work in the fall on a couple episodes back,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fired?</p>
<p>Why when they want to get a vaccine, the whole debate with</p>
<p>the teachers unions was that they wanted to be at the front</p>
<p>of the line for vaccines, which isn&rsquo;t an issue anymore, because</p>
<p>we have so many. So I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a serious issue.</p>
<p>Now requiring the kids to get vaccinated is that that would be</p>
<p>the real policy question. And</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s tackle both. Should teachers be forced to get the</p>
<p>vaccine? Yes or no,</p>
<p>you just kind of brushed over? Yeah, you&rsquo;ve had to force a</p>
<p>force. No, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s important to just to just, you</p>
<p>know, pinpoint this, like, forcing teachers to get</p>
<p>vaccinated in order to, you know, work at the school. I just</p>
<p>want to highlight the precedent it sets, right, which is, you</p>
<p>know, you just said you don&rsquo;t want the government to tell</p>
<p>people that they have to go get a shot in their arm. If someone</p>
<p>has a personal choice, that they don&rsquo;t want to get that</p>
<p>shot. Does that mean then that they, you know, should lose</p>
<p>their job as a public servant?</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, no, I&rsquo;m saying that, look, I think that</p>
<p>deal, but like, if there&rsquo;s one or two teachers that say, you</p>
<p>know what, it is a big deal to me, I have a different I have a</p>
<p>set of reasons why I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>get shot. I think those teachers, that&rsquo;s an assumption</p>
<p>of risk. I mean, if they&rsquo;ve decided they&rsquo;re going to assume</p>
<p>the risk, then you know, don&rsquo;t come crying to us when they get</p>
<p>sick. Well, the</p>
<p>argument is that was your choice, the vector of exposure,</p>
<p>right, that they could potentially Petri dishes as</p>
<p>they could be that they could they could be the vector that</p>
<p>gets kids sick.</p>
<p>In all of these situations, there&rsquo;s an always a very obvious</p>
<p>and justifiable exemption for religious and medical reasons to</p>
<p>not be vaccinated, not just for this, but for anything else. So</p>
<p>I struggle to understand why all of a sudden people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a fucking clue about science are all of a sudden,</p>
<p>these armchair scientists who can judge whether or not a</p>
<p>vaccine is appropriate for them, where they probably already</p>
<p>gave vaccines of all other kinds to their kids and themselves.</p>
<p>They probably take all other kinds of advice from doctors.</p>
<p>But on this one specific issue, they narrowly say, you know</p>
<p>what, I&rsquo;m an expert enough, because I&rsquo;m watching this</p>
<p>television show, I&rsquo;ve made a decision that to me makes no</p>
<p>sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I actually agree with you. I&rsquo;m in the camp of</p>
<p>that everybody barring some, you know, highly specific medical</p>
<p>condition that renders you ineligible should be getting</p>
<p>vaccinated. So I agree with you about what the right answer is.</p>
<p>But I do think that when it comes to government, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>more complicated question about how much power you give to</p>
<p>government to force people to engage in, you know, behavior</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to engage in.</p>
<p>Can you</p>
<p>these are real question private organizations are different,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll agree on private organizations, but we do have to</p>
<p>make some decisions on public transportation. And we do have</p>
<p>to make decisions about teachers, and we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to make decisions on students. So could you bench the</p>
<p>teachers who or otherwise penalize them who are not</p>
<p>vaccinated? You know, there are sometimes where you know, a cop</p>
<p>or a teacher is put in a, you know, not in the classroom, not</p>
<p>on the beat for whatever reasons, sometimes disciplinary,</p>
<p>but for other reasons, could you just say, Listen, if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get vaccinated, you&rsquo;re going to not be in the classroom,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to you&rsquo;ll be a remote teacher, and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to create two classes here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t think there are many teachers who</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to get vaccinated. But but I look, I think the</p>
<p>virus is everywhere. Now, it&rsquo;s just endemic. And so to single</p>
<p>out like one particular group and say, you&rsquo;re gonna put you</p>
<p>down on your opinion. So you&rsquo;re saying teachers should not be</p>
<p>forced.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that, I mean, if they work at a private school, the</p>
<p>private school could definitely require it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about public only. Now we all agree on private.</p>
<p>Look, I think it&rsquo;s a really down on it. Yeah,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really complicated question. Because I</p>
<p>think there are clear public health benefits to everyone</p>
<p>getting vaccinated by also don&rsquo;t really like empowering</p>
<p>government to force you. Because, look, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everything else, the government may be right in this particular</p>
<p>case, but what else is it going to do with that power? And you</p>
<p>know, I don&rsquo;t like giving government that power. So look,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a complicated question. I don&rsquo;t you know, it&rsquo;s not. I</p>
<p>would, I would probably err on the side of not letting</p>
<p>government force people to do it. But But But look, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a close call. I do think it&rsquo;s a close call.</p>
<p>Chamath forced the teachers to get vaccinated or not.</p>
<p>Yes. And the reason is because these kids are already being</p>
<p>left behind, even when school is functioning normally. And you</p>
<p>can see it in the test scores, you can see it in our readiness,</p>
<p>you can see it in our ability to actually do the jobs that are</p>
<p>required. We are not doing what we need to do as it is in the</p>
<p>absence of a pandemic. And now you introduce a reason for folks</p>
<p>to basically check out and not appear. What do you guys guess</p>
<p>how many years were lost in these 15 months when kids were</p>
<p>at home? I would say not 15 months. No, it&rsquo;s more. Two</p>
<p>years, two and a half years, three years.</p>
<p>Depending on what grade they are. What did the Did your kids</p>
<p>miss graduation? Did they miss senior prom? Did they miss their</p>
<p>SATs? I mean, what did they miss in terms of</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Chamath Chamath is a good point, which is that if</p>
<p>that that when government is the employer, requiring it on their</p>
<p>employees, because it leads to better outcomes for that</p>
<p>institution, that is a little different than government just</p>
<p>mandating that you Jason Kalkan as private citizen have to go</p>
<p>get a shot in your arm, right? I mean, so there is a slight</p>
<p>difference there, like military, for instance, right? The</p>
<p>military probably wants to vaccinate everybody, so that if</p>
<p>they need to be ready for a combat situation, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>like, you know, incapacitated by an outbreak of COVID. Right. So</p>
<p>I can, I think they&rsquo;re, you know, we&rsquo;re getting into shades</p>
<p>of gray here from a public policy perspective. You know, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want teachers missing school because, you know, for</p>
<p>weeks at a time because they didn&rsquo;t do the obvious thing</p>
<p>getting the COVID vaccine. So look, I think there are some</p>
<p>really good public policy arguments there. But I think</p>
<p>again, the, the one place where I&rsquo;d say government is clearly</p>
<p>overstepping is if they just said, Listen, you private</p>
<p>citizen, not an employee of the government has to go get</p>
<p>vaccinated. As much as I would like everyone to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give government that kind of power.</p>
<p>President Biden could legally require military members to get</p>
<p>vaccinated. But so far, he has declined to do so July 9, New</p>
<p>York Times. Friedberg, where do you stand on this? Chamath says</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s all in your teacher, you get vaccinated at the end. sax</p>
<p>is kind of close, but is a little concerned. What do you</p>
<p>say, Friedberg?</p>
<p>I mean, another way to frame it is that there&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>qualification for a job, like, you know, there&rsquo;s qualification</p>
<p>to be in the military, you have to have certain physical</p>
<p>capabilities. Jason, I don&rsquo;t know if you would qualify. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I would. I don&rsquo;t think I can be like,</p>
<p>for totally different reasons. Your inability to fight or throw</p>
<p>a punch would be no, maybe J Cal could eat the enemy. I would be</p>
<p>great in the military. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be like Clemenza. He&rsquo;d be cooking the meatballs or</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>Joker. Private.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the I think the reason there&rsquo;s sensitivity to it is</p>
<p>because there are existing teachers in jobs. And then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re telling them that in order to keep your job, you have</p>
<p>to go get a vaccine. Now, exactly. If we were to have zero</p>
<p>teachers today, and we were starting a public school system</p>
<p>from scratch. And you said here&rsquo;s one of the qualifying</p>
<p>criteria to be a school teacher, you have to have an education</p>
<p>degree, you have to have maybe a master&rsquo;s degree in education,</p>
<p>you have to have appropriate qualifications and training and</p>
<p>certification. Oh, and by the way, you also have to have a</p>
<p>vaccine. If that becomes a criteria, I think people find it</p>
<p>less offensive. It&rsquo;s the fact that we are now saying that</p>
<p>there are people that are being told that you have to go get a</p>
<p>shot in order to keep your job. And that&rsquo;s the complicating</p>
<p>thing that I think people are trying to wade through. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have I don&rsquo;t think that if you were to say like, look, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obvious that the qualifying criteria to be in the military</p>
<p>is you have to be able to run and do push ups or whatever the</p>
<p>criteria might be. But if you impose that on people that were</p>
<p>already in the military, and then you&rsquo;re going to kick a</p>
<p>bunch of them out, people would be up in arms about it.</p>
<p>If you had a BMI requirement,</p>
<p>yeah. And that&rsquo;s the concern I think that arises with, you</p>
<p>know, imposing these kind of, you know, personal body</p>
<p>criteria, upon, you know, specific jobs when people are</p>
<p>already employed in that job. And it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely no answer, right? Like, if you&rsquo;re going to do it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have incredible backlash and trouble and pain.</p>
<p>And if you were to, and we&rsquo;re not in a circumstance where we</p>
<p>can build these organizations and these institutions from</p>
<p>scratch,</p>
<p>look, there&rsquo;s a lot of social issues where, you know,</p>
<p>particularly on the liberal side, people do not want the</p>
<p>government prohibiting them from getting certain medical</p>
<p>procedures, right? Well, you know, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s even more</p>
<p>invasive talking about people transitioning, or, you know, or</p>
<p>the issue of abortion, you know, very hot button social</p>
<p>issues where people are saying, the government should not have</p>
<p>the right to legislate. What happens with what happens with</p>
<p>all treatments? Yeah, what happens with my body, right?</p>
<p>Well, force it, you know, giving government the power to</p>
<p>forcibly inject you with something is, you know, that is</p>
<p>that is invasive. And so I do think there are like rights</p>
<p>implications to that.</p>
<p>But I want to be very clear. If you want the services that are</p>
<p>offered to you by the collective whole, if you want to consume</p>
<p>and be a net drag on the resources that we share, then</p>
<p>you need to sign up for the compact that we all sign up for</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s my overarching argument. The thing with</p>
<p>abortion where I&rsquo;m on the other side of the issue, just to be</p>
<p>very clear is like, it is a woman&rsquo;s body. I don&rsquo;t think I</p>
<p>have any right to dictate what she does. I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>what she goes through. I don&rsquo;t understand what situation she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in. I don&rsquo;t think I have the judgment to do that. It shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have an impact on the collective and her decision to carry or not</p>
<p>carry a baby doesn&rsquo;t theoretically come with a</p>
<p>probabilistic chance that I may die. It does not. Right. But</p>
<p>when you choose to not get vaccinated to a highly</p>
<p>transmissible respiratory disease that could kill me or</p>
<p>mutate, yeah, I&rsquo;m not saying that I have a say. But I do</p>
<p>think I should have a say if you&rsquo;re then all of a sudden</p>
<p>going to consume the same resources that I consume, where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve signed up to that compact for public health.</p>
<p>Based on all this, here&rsquo;s where I come to what if we gave</p>
<p>teachers an off ramp, listen, if you you need to be vaccinated to</p>
<p>be in the classroom. If not, you&rsquo;re going to get a one year</p>
<p>buyout or whatever one month or two months for every year of</p>
<p>service. So if you&rsquo;ve been with us for 20 years, you can get 20</p>
<p>months of pay. And or you could say if the virus is spreading at</p>
<p>under this rate, in other words, you know, we&rsquo;ve got under 1% of</p>
<p>the population infected or whatever the the criteria is,</p>
<p>then you can come to work in the classroom. But if this thing is</p>
<p>spreading, you&rsquo;re out. And that&rsquo;s it. And there&rsquo;s an off</p>
<p>ramp here, to David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a narrow, like, look, I do think you can be a</p>
<p>conscientious objector for legitimate reasons. Again, like</p>
<p>we have these very specific definitions for religious or for</p>
<p>health specific reasons that you that you don&rsquo;t get vaccinated. I</p>
<p>think those should be respected. It&rsquo;s not that cohort of people</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about. It&rsquo;s everybody else that right now</p>
<p>wants to not think for themselves. And as a result, put</p>
<p>everybody else and themselves in danger.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the most compelling part of your argument</p>
<p>schmoth is that we&rsquo;re is the health externality, right? That</p>
<p>that that each person&rsquo;s decision does have an impact on whether</p>
<p>they could be transmitting, you know, multiplicative, contagious</p>
<p>particles. And this is why I was in favor of a mass mandate at</p>
<p>the beginning of the pandemic is, it&rsquo;s not just an individual</p>
<p>decision, your your choice actually does affect whether</p>
<p>other people get sick. So you know, this is why I do think it</p>
<p>also wasn&rsquo;t very invasive, correct? sacks. I mean, was your</p>
<p>other point? Yes, exactly. Potentially high benefit for</p>
<p>very low cost. I think we&rsquo;re but but but the thing that maybe I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t necessarily take into consideration is, you know,</p>
<p>people complied in such a half hearted way. I mean, I do think</p>
<p>the mass makes a difference. If it&rsquo;s an N 95 quality mask that</p>
<p>you put on correctly, right. But when people just strap a sock to</p>
<p>their face is loosely fitting, and they don&rsquo;t give a shit. I</p>
<p>mean, does that really make a difference? I mean, I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>skeptical. Let me ask you a question, sacks. And then we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go to freeberg. And then we&rsquo;ll flip to the next topic. If we</p>
<p>were on our third pandemic, or let&rsquo;s God forbid, a second</p>
<p>pandemic starts a totally different one, you know, Ebola</p>
<p>type or something. And we&rsquo;re on the fifth variant and people are</p>
<p>dying at a higher rate. Does your calculus change sacks?</p>
<p>Because because the the downsides that the costs of you</p>
<p>know, not not imposing those more restrictive regulations</p>
<p>goes up considerably. I mean, definitely my thinking today is</p>
<p>highly influenced by the fact that that if you&rsquo;re vaccinated,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re call it 95% likely to be taking the most deadly or</p>
<p>serious risks off the table. And so the people who are choosing</p>
<p>not to get vaccinated are essentially assuming the risk,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like smoking in a way where, when I</p>
<p>made the movie thing for smoking, Christopher Buckley</p>
<p>told me, you know, he&rsquo;s the author of the book. And he said,</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s something uniquely American about defending</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s right to do something that&rsquo;s manifestly harmful,</p>
<p>right? The main character, and thank you for smoking as a</p>
<p>spokesman for big tobacco, and he&rsquo;s engaging in political spin.</p>
<p>But his argument is, look, people have the right to engage</p>
<p>in this behavior, even if it is known to be harmful to them.</p>
<p>Maybe America is the only place in the world where people buy</p>
<p>into arguments like that. But I do. I you know, look, that is</p>
<p>that is, that&rsquo;s freedom is letting people do stupid</p>
<p>things, you know, and, and so we have to weigh the benefits of</p>
<p>freedom against the against the costs. And</p>
<p>by the way, sorry, can I just say something? Smoking is a</p>
<p>perfect example. Because as you know, there is now a non trivial</p>
<p>amount of law around the liability related to individuals</p>
<p>that enabled secondhand smoke, both the smoker, but also other</p>
<p>things, condo boards, other places where all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t choose to fucking have, you know, tar and</p>
<p>nicotine, right? bartenders, my dad worked in bars where people</p>
<p>it was a cloud of smoke for 30 years, 30 years, right? They</p>
<p>told him he was essentially a smoker. It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>the detrimental activity at the time. Remember, we&rsquo;ve socialized</p>
<p>the cost of treatment for people through public health systems.</p>
<p>And because of that, it&rsquo;s not just an individual&rsquo;s choice. If</p>
<p>there is a socialized cost for everyone that&rsquo;s now got to pay</p>
<p>the price,</p>
<p>but the government is so omnipresent, all of our lives,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always going to be a social cost to any bad choice</p>
<p>people make. And to Tomas point, I mean, everybody uses</p>
<p>government services to some degree. So that alone can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>the reason I do agree that the</p>
<p>behavior, David, what about people speeding on highways at</p>
<p>125 miles an hour? Like, it&rsquo;s illegal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s illegal. But But I think I think your mouth is right that</p>
<p>the smoking example is a good one. Because we do regulate</p>
<p>secondhand smoke, because there&rsquo;s an externality, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a health externality to everybody else. If you smoke in</p>
<p>a public place. And so we restrict that. But we don&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>smoking illegal. We don&rsquo;t stop you from doing it in your own</p>
<p>homes, or in private places. And the argument is, listen, if you</p>
<p>want to do something that&rsquo;s harmful, primarily to you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your choice as an American. You know, and I know</p>
<p>people, a lot of people don&rsquo;t like that. Actually, this is a</p>
<p>this, I posted a tweet that I got</p>
<p>just because an opinion is wrong doesn&rsquo;t mean it should be</p>
<p>censored. Just because the behavior is harmful doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean it should be prohibited. Just because something is</p>
<p>beneficial doesn&rsquo;t mean it should be required. Right? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a completely reasonable tweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought it was a pretty inoffensive anodyne tweet, just</p>
<p>reminding people that just because, again, something is</p>
<p>positive doesn&rsquo;t mean you force people to do it. And just</p>
<p>because some behavior is harmful, you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ban it. I think smoking is a great example of that, right? We</p>
<p>let people engage in behavior that&rsquo;s harmful to them, because</p>
<p>freedom is a value in and of itself. For this, I was attacked</p>
<p>as a selfish asshole, by, by this other pod. And I really</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>Kara Swisher and Professor Koltakes.</p>
<p>Professor what?</p>
<p>Koltakes, that literally made an index of all of Professor G&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, takes that Macy&rsquo;s would be incredible and Amazon</p>
<p>would lose its money and yada yada. He&rsquo;s kind of obsessed with</p>
<p>you too, Chamath Prof. G. Yeah, who just got a show canceled on</p>
<p>Bloomberg, but they were a little Kara Swisher was called</p>
<p>sacks and asshole.</p>
<p>Well triggered, it was bizarre that they would get so triggered</p>
<p>by this inoffensive tweet. But I think what you see here is an</p>
<p>example of the way that the woke mind thinks, which is</p>
<p>well, hold on, I don&rsquo;t think Kara&rsquo;s woke.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? She&rsquo;s like, she&rsquo;s like the Madame du Farge</p>
<p>or the woke revolution. She&rsquo;s</p>
<p>meeting the Farge.</p>
<p>Madame du Farge was this character in the French</p>
<p>Revolution who had knit the names of the next person to be</p>
<p>guillotined. And she was, you know, one of the leaders of the</p>
<p>sans culottes. No, look, Kara is constantly ginning up the mob to</p>
<p>try and, you know, guillotine some non known non woke person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s true. That&rsquo;s true. I think she&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of moderate. You&rsquo;re trying to you&rsquo;re trying to curry favor</p>
<p>with her. So you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>No, no, she I mean, she did get it right. You are an asshole. I</p>
<p>mean, you are an asshole. She got that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not old and failing. Well, you are kind of old. You</p>
<p>looked old.</p>
<p>You look old.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s effectively saying we&rsquo;re all assholes. Because I think</p>
<p>all of us have talked about that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re assholes. I&rsquo;m an asshole. Yeah, I love it. Own it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your other choice being a whiner on the sidelines?</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve said on the show is that we have a moral imperative</p>
<p>to get to get back to normal. Do we not? That is what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>said. And for that, she&rsquo;s basically saying that that is a</p>
<p>let them be COVID position, right? That we are basically we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care if people get sick and die because of COVID. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not true. You know, we just have a</p>
<p>fear. I think we should make people get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re pretty close to getting people vaccinated. I</p>
<p>asked you, Saks, if there were three more variants, and this</p>
<p>was an acute situation, you said you would force</p>
<p>Oh, look, if we had if we had a variant of COVID, that was as</p>
<p>deadly as Ebola and as transmissible as Delta variant,</p>
<p>it 100% changes the game. There&rsquo;s no question about</p>
<p>willing to change the government&rsquo;s ability to put a</p>
<p>shot based on it&rsquo;s a benefit. Yes, it&rsquo;s a benefit cost</p>
<p>analysis. And that&rsquo;s reasonable. But look, I give freedom, a lot</p>
<p>of weight. And part of my calculation is the fact that I</p>
<p>can get vaccinated to take to most likely take the most</p>
<p>serious risks off the table. So while I am impacted to some</p>
<p>degree by other people&rsquo;s choices, I&rsquo;m much less impacted</p>
<p>now that we have</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re thinking about this, yours, I still have a problem</p>
<p>with the way you&rsquo;re thinking about this, because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using you&rsquo;re viewing this as a linear problem. This thing is</p>
<p>transmutating. And so</p>
<p>I know, but there&rsquo;s still billions of people all over the</p>
<p>world who are unvaccinated, and we&rsquo;d be better off focusing on</p>
<p>getting them a Marshall Plan for the vaccines, all these unused</p>
<p>doses, we&rsquo;re wasting our breath in the United States, trying to</p>
<p>get these vaccine hesitant or anti vax people to get</p>
<p>vaccinated.</p>
<p>Did you guys see that? Emmanuel Macron of France, you know,</p>
<p>basically tightened all these restrictions around access to</p>
<p>public places, going into bars and cafes, they basically put</p>
<p>all these rules in place that you have to be vaccinated. And</p>
<p>he did it in a public address on TV. 22 million people watched</p>
<p>it. Yep. And then after he did this, suddenly, the vaccination</p>
<p>signups went up to like 20,000. A minute, they got 4 million</p>
<p>people sign up to get vaccinated. Yep. I mean, in</p>
<p>France, what&rsquo;s the point of being alive? And then let me</p>
<p>throw a wet blanket on the framing of this on whether all</p>
<p>of this talk about forcing vaccinations even make sense or</p>
<p>is possible. I have been to like three events over the last month</p>
<p>or two, where I was required to be vaccinated. And I literally</p>
<p>just took a photo of this index card that I got from this</p>
<p>person and sent it to them, which I could go make a kinkos</p>
<p>or I could print at home. So like, my point is, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not a great digital system today to enable the level</p>
<p>of restriction that we&rsquo;re actually talking about. How are</p>
<p>you actually going to know that people go into the Warriors game</p>
<p>are actually vaccinated? How are you actually going to know they</p>
<p>did it at Madison Square Garden, they literally had you pull out</p>
<p>your ID and they match your name to your vax card. And I think</p>
<p>printing out a vax card and faking it if I carry a find</p>
<p>could be a $10,000 fine. And so you would do it like anything</p>
<p>else. If you could, you could make a bogus driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not digital, right? There&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no kind of</p>
<p>centralized system where we know who&rsquo;s actually been vaccinated</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not. So so much of this is just this like analog paper</p>
<p>trail thing of like, here&rsquo;s this piece of paper that says I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>vaccinated. I think that you&rsquo;re never going to really close the</p>
<p>hole on this thing. Now, you certainly will see the sort of</p>
<p>psychological behavior that they saw in France, which is you just</p>
<p>announce the restrictions, you announce these rules, everyone</p>
<p>or some number of people will sign up. But you know, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure this actually ends up becoming this truly enforceable</p>
<p>mechanism of behavior in society over the next, you know, short</p>
<p>while I mean, maybe over time, we digitize all this stuff. But</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see. Yeah. Anyway,</p>
<p>the best the best case scenario is that because Delta is so</p>
<p>transmissible, we get to herd immunity because all the people</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t get vaccinated, just get it and get the natural</p>
<p>antibodies. And hopefully,</p>
<p>we to that because we have 60% of adults in the United States</p>
<p>have had one shot or more, which is why deaths probably aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going up because that&rsquo;s like 75% and people over 60. I think so</p>
<p>freeberg in your estimation as our science guy, with what we</p>
<p>have, like 30 million people who&rsquo;ve been infected that we know</p>
<p>of, you got to triple that number, right? Because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people who we don&rsquo;t know, and then you have 65, you have 60%.</p>
<p>So we got to be in the range of 70% have been exposed or been</p>
<p>vaccinated. So when does it kick in? Or are we experiencing, you</p>
<p>know, herd immunity right now with these low deaths?</p>
<p>We talked about this before, but there are, you know, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>spectrum of infection, right? You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you can</p>
<p>have viral replication happening in your body, and then your body</p>
<p>clears out the virus before you even know, because you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>enough antibodies to that particular strain of a variant</p>
<p>of a virus before your body even, you know, you start to</p>
<p>feel symptoms. And there are cases where the virus kind of</p>
<p>replicates in an uncontrolled way for a period of time, and</p>
<p>you have incredibly bad symptoms, and you have</p>
<p>inflammation, all the stuff that follows. And so, you know, in</p>
<p>terms of how you measure this stuff, it&rsquo;s really difficult to</p>
<p>say that you&rsquo;re going to stop all viral replication by getting</p>
<p>a certain number of people to be to have been exposed, as we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen, even when you have a broad and diverse antibody pool in</p>
<p>your body, because you&rsquo;ve been exposed to a vaccine, we are</p>
<p>still seeing that some of these variants can break through for</p>
<p>some period of time, because there&rsquo;s not enough of the</p>
<p>antibodies that can actually bind to that specific variant.</p>
<p>And so the rate of transmission slows, the rate of severe</p>
<p>infection goes way down, and so on. So it&rsquo;s not as binary as,</p>
<p>hey, we hit herd immunity, and now we&rsquo;re done, it seems this</p>
<p>is, you know, as we talked about earlier, and as I think everyone</p>
<p>is coming to terms with, this is going to be an endemic virus.</p>
<p>And that means that it&rsquo;s going to be circulating in the</p>
<p>population in a modest way, causing sometimes severe,</p>
<p>sometimes, you know, modest outbreaks, for likely a very</p>
<p>long time, no matter how many people get it, no matter how</p>
<p>many people get vaccinated, because you have different</p>
<p>levels, should we ignore it? At what level? Should we just say,</p>
<p>Listen, that is the steady state? How many cases a day? How</p>
<p>many deaths a day? Do you think is the steady state that we</p>
<p>should just say, we just go to work and ignore it?</p>
<p>I am a brutal, cold hearted libertarian on this point. And I</p>
<p>have been since we first talked about this last year, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always been of the mind that we need to balance the, the follow</p>
<p>on life effect and from the economic fallout associated with</p>
<p>making certain behavioral changes, and restrictions</p>
<p>relative to the actual loss of life, right? So you can never go</p>
<p>I really think this point about zeroism, and this term about</p>
<p>zeroism is an important one, you can never get to zero cases,</p>
<p>what is the acceptable number of cases? And what is the cost to</p>
<p>keep that caseload down? The balance of those two is a very</p>
<p>difficult leadership decision, put a number on it. It&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>saving lives, right? So like, there are a certain number of</p>
<p>people whose lives are going to be ruined, who are some of them</p>
<p>will commit suicide, some of them won&rsquo;t be able to earn an</p>
<p>income, again, their businesses are going to get shut down. What</p>
<p>is the economic cost of that versus the economic cost of the</p>
<p>loss of life?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, what is the number we had an average of 250</p>
<p>death 250,000 case known cases a day at the peak, we had a peak</p>
<p>deaths of 4100 a day, we are now at 200 people dying a day. And,</p>
<p>you know, 30,000 cases, is there a number at which you say, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just focus on getting back to work? And is that number where</p>
<p>we are now? I&rsquo;m trying to get</p>
<p>so I Yeah, again, I wouldn&rsquo;t simplify it to those data</p>
<p>points. What I would do is, again, I would look at, you</p>
<p>know, at what age are people dying? How many life years are</p>
<p>we losing? And how can we address the acute populations</p>
<p>that are at risk in the acute populations that are that are</p>
<p>potentially going to be exposed, manage those</p>
<p>populations differently than you manage the broader population</p>
<p>that has a lower likelihood of risk of death and a lower</p>
<p>likelihood of fatality. And the restrictions that you then</p>
<p>impose to, you know, start to manage the risk and the exposure</p>
<p>to different populations gets weighed against the saving of</p>
<p>life and the loss of life in both circumstances. So it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>easy, right? It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s never wants to sum this whole thing up</p>
<p>to like, how many deaths a day is appropriate? That&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>right answer, right? Because</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re saying how many</p>
<p>that part of it is so obvious, right, that and we should have</p>
<p>known this last summer, the obvious part being that what you</p>
<p>want to do is focus your prevention on the part of the</p>
<p>population that&rsquo;s the most at risk. And what do we do with</p>
<p>lockdowns, we literally locked down the entire population,</p>
<p>every business, it was completely insane, we should</p>
<p>have focused it on protecting the most at risk populations</p>
<p>isolating the sick, or the people at greatest risk, not</p>
<p>everybody was just insane. And I mean, I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still having that conversation a year later.</p>
<p>Can I before we move on to the next topic? Can I can I read the</p>
<p>best? Can I read the best best comment from Saksas tweet, so</p>
<p>Saksas tweet, because an opinion is wrong doesn&rsquo;t mean it should</p>
<p>be censored. Just because the behavior is harmful doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>it should be prohibited. And just because something is</p>
<p>beneficial doesn&rsquo;t mean it should be required. The best</p>
<p>response goes to distantly social rumple, whose full name</p>
<p>is at Wendell shirk, who said, this message brought to you by</p>
<p>the generic self serving platitude alert network. We now</p>
<p>return you to your regularly scheduled episode of the bland</p>
<p>soap opera with the problem sisters.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I look there, there&rsquo;s an element of truth to</p>
<p>that, which is I almost didn&rsquo;t tweet him because I thought it</p>
<p>was too much of a platitude. But the fact that people on the</p>
<p>other side got so triggered by it shows why it was actually</p>
<p>useful to tweet it is, they think that if you&rsquo;re calling for</p>
<p>any modicum of freedom or return to normalcy, you&rsquo;re basically a</p>
<p>selfish asshole. I mean, it&rsquo;s insane. I mean, they want to</p>
<p>stay in this world of zero is COVID restrictions forever.</p>
<p>We got to move on. We&rsquo;re 45 minutes into COVID. So we got to</p>
<p>move on. But I think if this is in the influenza, plus or minus</p>
<p>100% zone, we got to pick a number where we decide we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>moving forward as a society. And you know, local communities can</p>
<p>make decisions if they have outbreaks. But I kind of think</p>
<p>if this is within, you know, two x of our yearly deaths from</p>
<p>you know, influenza and just the normal cold, I think we move</p>
<p>forward as best we can do we want to go to China, Cuba, I</p>
<p>think just real quick, before we move away from this, I really</p>
<p>want to just highlight the DeepMind announcement from this</p>
<p>morning, because I think it&rsquo;s actually quite relevant to the</p>
<p>tracking of variants and what&rsquo;s been going on. Okay. So this</p>
<p>morning, you know, DeepMind, which published alpha fold, and</p>
<p>we talked about this a few</p>
<p>by Google, it&rsquo;s their AI, it&rsquo;s an AI arm owned by Google. And</p>
<p>they basically took protein structure and tried to predict</p>
<p>what a protein looks like physically as a function of the</p>
<p>DNA or RNA, that codes the amino acids that make up the</p>
<p>protein. And so again, like when you have a string of amino</p>
<p>acids, they they combine and they fold into a way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to predict. And that&rsquo;s the shape of the molecule</p>
<p>that we call the protein, and then it does something in the</p>
<p>body. And historically, we&rsquo;ve had very hard times understanding</p>
<p>how genetic code translates into physical structure of protein,</p>
<p>which would allow us to predict what that protein can then do in</p>
<p>the body. So this morning, DeepMind incredibly published a</p>
<p>database with the predicted structure of every protein in</p>
<p>the human body, and in 10 other species using this, this</p>
<p>capability that they now have,</p>
<p>what does it mean in English?</p>
<p>And so you know, what this means is we now have a physical model</p>
<p>of every protein that human DNA can make. And that model would</p>
<p>allow us to basically now predict what that protein does,</p>
<p>how it does it and how certain drugs can bind to those</p>
<p>proteins, and how certain drugs can affect those proteins and</p>
<p>how we can alter human health by making new molecules or</p>
<p>adjusting the genetic code to change the shape of those</p>
<p>proteins in specific and targeted ways. So it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible data set that was just published. It&rsquo;s almost like,</p>
<p>you know, releasing the Rosetta Stone, in my opinion, in terms</p>
<p>of we now have this ability to translate human genetic code</p>
<p>into the physical form of the molecules that run our body and</p>
<p>do things in our body. They did it for 10 other species. And</p>
<p>they said that they&rsquo;re going to publish this proteome database</p>
<p>and scale it for all other species of life that we have the</p>
<p>sort of data set around, for which they expect will achieve</p>
<p>over 100 million unique proteins in this database over the coming</p>
<p>months freely available and searchable. And let me just</p>
<p>explain, and I know I&rsquo;m on a monologue here. So I&rsquo;ll win the</p>
<p>monologue stat. It&rsquo;s a good one. It&rsquo;s a good one. But let me just</p>
<p>explain why this is relevant. The Delta variant, what it is,</p>
<p>is that you know, the the SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence is about</p>
<p>30,000 base pairs long. 10% of those are about 3000 base pairs</p>
<p>make up the spike protein, which is the protein at the tip</p>
<p>of the COVID virus, the coronavirus that gets into the</p>
<p>cells. And, you know, for every 10 people that are infected with</p>
<p>coronavirus, there&rsquo;s about one nucleoside mutation, one of</p>
<p>those base pairs changes, and the virus evolves. And we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how that change in that genetic code translates into a</p>
<p>different structure of the protein. And so we suddenly</p>
<p>discover empirically, and you know, by looking around,</p>
<p>suddenly, all these people are getting more infected than</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting infected before we look at the genetic code, and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like, oh, here&rsquo;s the changes that happened. But we</p>
<p>could have with this capability from alpha fold predicted what</p>
<p>changes make the spike protein do a better job binding to human</p>
<p>ACE2 receptors on the cells and getting it to cells. And what</p>
<p>other changes could be made in the whole genome of the SARS-CoV-2</p>
<p>virus that could cause this virus to be more transmissible,</p>
<p>more deadly, all these sorts of factors, because we can now</p>
<p>estimate the physical form of that protein by changing the</p>
<p>base pair. And so this tool that was released today, I think</p>
<p>highlights that over the next decade, these sorts of things</p>
<p>that are going on with viruses mutating and variants occurring</p>
<p>that are affecting our population can be better</p>
<p>estimated and tracked digitally. And it gives us the ability to</p>
<p>start to prepare tools and defense mechanisms against them</p>
<p>with new drugs and new variant models and new vaccines well</p>
<p>ahead of the Oh my god, we just got hit with a nuclear bomb,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s clean up the mess kind of in the future. So it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>exciting day, an exciting moment.</p>
<p>Would they have been released this, David, if it hadn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>for COVID coming out? Do you think DeepMind just pivoted</p>
<p>their entire group? Because they have about 1000 people I</p>
<p>understand. And by the way, they pay something in the order of</p>
<p>six or 700,000 a year on average. And there&rsquo;s many people</p>
<p>there who are getting paid millions of dollars a year. So</p>
<p>just think about the scale of what Google is spending on this,</p>
<p>you guys know that I probably shifted a large number of</p>
<p>people to work on this, you guys know that I have long deep roots</p>
<p>at Google. And I will tell you that the value system of people</p>
<p>there, you know, the press and the public will think what they</p>
<p>want. But I think that the value system of people there, drove</p>
<p>them to realize the importance of this work that they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with alpha fold, and it is important for humanity. And it</p>
<p>is important for the health broadly of people, they could</p>
<p>have kept it all inside, and used it to build therapeutic</p>
<p>drug companies and make money from that. And I think the</p>
<p>importance of this discovery and this capability was, was realized</p>
<p>and is published for that very reason. There&rsquo;s a lot of work</p>
<p>that DeepMind does to optimize ad targeting and ad spending and</p>
<p>all this stuff. And they make 10s of billions of dollars of</p>
<p>incremental revenue for Google per year based on those</p>
<p>capabilities. And then there are these things that benefit all of</p>
<p>us. And by putting this out publicly, it&rsquo;s a great good for</p>
<p>humanity. And, you know, they&rsquo;re making it freely available and</p>
<p>searchable. And so I don&rsquo;t think that COVID kind of</p>
<p>instigated this, because they&rsquo;ve been working on this for a very</p>
<p>long time since before COVID. And this is a very hard</p>
<p>biological problem that is key to understanding biology and how</p>
<p>biology works. It&rsquo;s been going on for decades, they&rsquo;ve unlocked</p>
<p>it with software, and they&rsquo;re making it freely available. And</p>
<p>you know, there will be hundreds of drug companies that will now</p>
<p>start because of what&rsquo;s in that database.</p>
<p>This is a mitzvah to society to humanity. It does it change the</p>
<p>fact that Google is spending well over a billion dollars a</p>
<p>year on DeepMind and doing projects like this. Does this</p>
<p>change any of your thinking about breaking them up trim off</p>
<p>or you know, how we look at big tech?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>No. Because how do you afford it? Yeah, where does it where</p>
<p>does this kind of</p>
<p>we learned something very disturbing about big tech this</p>
<p>week, actually. This is quite a bombshell that Jen Psaki dropped</p>
<p>from the White House press briefing. We got to talk about</p>
<p>this. She just sort of casually mentioned that. Oh, yeah, by the</p>
<p>way, the administration is flagging posts for a social</p>
<p>media company for big tech companies to take down to remove</p>
<p>accounts, specific accounts and posts. Yeah. And she just kind</p>
<p>of just casually mentions Oh, yeah, the big tech companies are</p>
<p>very, you know, eagerly cooperating with the</p>
<p>administration to take down these counts, accounts. She even</p>
<p>said that when one of these companies takes down an account,</p>
<p>the rest should do it to implying that the White House is</p>
<p>providing the central coordinative role in the</p>
<p>censorship global block list. Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s take the most charitable view here. I know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very easy to make this a left versus right. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>censoring yada yada, Trump got banned. But if somebody was</p>
<p>saying, this was micro, this was an account that was claiming</p>
<p>that microchips were in the vaccine. Would it not be? How</p>
<p>would the and there was hitting scale? You know, what would be</p>
<p>the way for the White House to inform social media that there</p>
<p>was an account that was saying falsely that microchips were in</p>
<p>there, and that that was trending?</p>
<p>The White House or its officials are free to put out their</p>
<p>statements and their position. But this is different. This is</p>
<p>the White House coordinating behind the scenes with big tech</p>
<p>companies.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re not behind the scenes. They&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it right here to everybody.</p>
<p>Correct. Correct. The behavior was behind the scenes, but</p>
<p>Pisaki just admitted it, which is why it&rsquo;s such a bombshell.</p>
<p>Look, even the ACLU</p>
<p>you were president, and there was an account on Facebook,</p>
<p>YouTube, Twitter, that was saying there was a microchip</p>
<p>from Bill Gates.</p>
<p>This is a this is a blatant violation of the people&rsquo;s First</p>
<p>Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Tell them how would you you are allowed you&rsquo;re the First</p>
<p>Amendment gives you the right to say things that are untrue. It</p>
<p>is not the business of government to declare what is</p>
<p>true and what is false. Okay, even even hold on. I&rsquo;m not done.</p>
<p>Even the ACLU came out of retirement. We hadn&rsquo;t we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard from them for the last year. During any of the hard to</p>
<p>be the ACLU. Yeah, we haven&rsquo;t heard from them during the past</p>
<p>year. During all of this activity has been going on with</p>
<p>accounts being blocked and ghosted. They finally came out of</p>
<p>retirement to say that that this is a dangerous violation of</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s First Amendment rights. You cannot have the government</p>
<p>saying what is true and what is false and then denying people the</p>
<p>right to express their opinions based on what the government</p>
<p>thinks is the truth. And by the way, there&rsquo;s been a very</p>
<p>subtle change here in the language that&rsquo;s being used. If</p>
<p>you remember what the argument used to be that we have to stop</p>
<p>disinformation does now it&rsquo;s shifted to have to stop</p>
<p>misinformation. So those two things are very different. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like that. Well, it&rsquo;s kind of like the difference in</p>
<p>the term equality versus equity. They sound similar, but they</p>
<p>actually mean very different things. So disinformation is</p>
<p>actually a campaign of purposeful purposeful campaign</p>
<p>of propaganda and lies usually put forward covertly. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the FSB, or some intelligence agency putting out whatever</p>
<p>putting out disinformation usually under false accounts. So</p>
<p>in that case, we can say no, you can&rsquo;t do that because you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>engage in deception around who you are, right. But</p>
<p>misinformation is simply information that&rsquo;s being put</p>
<p>out that frankly, you disagree with. Okay. And</p>
<p>or could be discernibly wrong. Wait, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>framing that, right? It could be, you&rsquo;re putting out</p>
<p>information, like there&rsquo;s a microchip in the vaccine that is</p>
<p>more explicitly known to be wrong.</p>
<p>Look, the lab leak theory was considered misinformation by</p>
<p>these same people three months ago.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s take this. There&rsquo;s a microchip. If the if it was the</p>
<p>case that they said there&rsquo;s a microchip in the vaccine, would</p>
<p>you be okay with the White House contacting social media companies</p>
<p>saying, Hey, you got these accounts that are saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a microchip, you might want to look into it. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not saying take it down. They&rsquo;re saying take a look into it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the White House&rsquo;s business. Do I believe in the</p>
<p>microchip theory? No, of course not. It&rsquo;s absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>But it is not the business of</p>
<p>to be telling social media who to ban and who to block list.</p>
<p>I think they didn&rsquo;t tell him to ban. I think they told him to be</p>
<p>aware of it. Go ahead, come off. I think your framings wrong</p>
<p>sex. No, no.</p>
<p>But Saki said that when one site takes it down, they should all</p>
<p>take it down. And then Biden on top of it comes out and pours</p>
<p>kerosene on the fire by saying that social media sites are</p>
<p>literally killing people. Well, yeah, by allowing by allowing</p>
<p>this misinformation. So here we see now let&rsquo;s be honest. He&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>president. This is the President of the United States using the</p>
<p>bully pulpit to call social media sites mass murderers by</p>
<p>virtue of allowing people to have free speech. Trump never</p>
<p>used language that intemperate. I don&rsquo;t remember him ever</p>
<p>calling God, American companies. Go ahead, come on, let&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>speak. Let&rsquo;s not speak.</p>
<p>This is the exact reason you you can&rsquo;t have a stranglehold on</p>
<p>distribution, because it will get perverted. And then we</p>
<p>either have people we like or people we don&rsquo;t like in these</p>
<p>positions of power, or people we like or people we don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>regulating, and it&rsquo;s constantly flipping. And we&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>doomed and bound to get fucked over. So back to the thing that</p>
<p>Friedberg brought up before, I think alpha fold is incredible.</p>
<p>I think Google has been an incredible company. They make</p>
<p>money hand over fist, they waste an enormous amount of money and</p>
<p>all kinds of trash. So it&rsquo;s good that they were actually</p>
<p>able to do something useful here. I generally think that</p>
<p>companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon,</p>
<p>unfortunately, do not allow the constructive form of capitalism</p>
<p>that people want in today&rsquo;s society. They&rsquo;re just too big.</p>
<p>Trump off makes a great point, which is we&rsquo;ve got these big</p>
<p>tech monopolies who&rsquo;ve become gatekeepers over content, okay.</p>
<p>And what the administration has done and their allies in</p>
<p>Congress is hang a sort of Damocles over the heads of these</p>
<p>big tech companies. They&rsquo;ve appointed Lena Khan to be the</p>
<p>enforcer at the FTC. They&rsquo;ve got their six bills in Congress</p>
<p>right now. They&rsquo;ve held congressional hearings around</p>
<p>taking away Section 230 protection, which is very</p>
<p>economically advantageous for these big tech companies. So</p>
<p>they position the sword perfectly over the heads of big</p>
<p>tech companies, threatening to break them up and rein them in.</p>
<p>And then Jen Psaki in the White House, go to them and say, we</p>
<p>want you to take down these accounts that we don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with. This is misinformation. Okay, that is a huge danger to</p>
<p>free speech. It&rsquo;s basically like the administration saying to</p>
<p>these big tech companies, nice little social network you got</p>
<p>there. It&rsquo;d be a real shame if anything happened to it. Look at</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on. Don&rsquo;t you want them broken up? I do want them</p>
<p>broken up. But what I don&rsquo;t want is if you want them to hold the</p>
<p>sword, or do you not want them to hold the sword? I actually</p>
<p>want the sword to come crashing. I actually want the</p>
<p>sword to swing the sword, not hold it over and then use it</p>
<p>for extortion. Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually a great explanation.</p>
<p>Then, Friedberg. Yes. I&rsquo;m trying to moderate here, Friedberg. Do</p>
<p>you give a shit? We&rsquo;ve talked about this spent all day on his</p>
<p>phone. He is not dialed into this. I&rsquo;m with you guys. I</p>
<p>thought we just went over the alpha fold stuff way too fast. I</p>
<p>mean, the arguing over freedom of speech is happening. And all</p>
<p>of this debate Friedberg at the same time that we are making</p>
<p>incredible life changing moments for humanity. Two different</p>
<p>companies went to space last week with civilians. And then we</p>
<p>are basically defining the blueprint for the human and</p>
<p>every other species on the planet. And we&rsquo;re fighting over</p>
<p>people too stupid to take a goddamn vaccine that would save</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s life and let us continue on and people are</p>
<p>dunking on Bezos for not reading the room. I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>saw this Friedberg. But how do you think about the space race</p>
<p>in relation to reading the room, etc.</p>
<p>Progress, technologically, will only arise with capital. So you</p>
<p>can assume that that progress, you know, it&rsquo;s not like someone</p>
<p>stumbles into a cave and discovered a rocket ship or</p>
<p>stumbles into a cave and discovered alpha fold. There are</p>
<p>years of toiling and labs like Edison did making the light</p>
<p>bulb. It medicine had to raise a ton of money to get that light</p>
<p>bulb project off the ground. If you guys haven&rsquo;t read, trying</p>
<p>to remember the biography, there&rsquo;s a wizards of something</p>
<p>was it&rsquo;s got wizards in the title. It&rsquo;s a good biography of</p>
<p>Edison. And, you know, and I feel like we&rsquo;re at this moment</p>
<p>where the Wizard of Menlo Park. Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s the wizard</p>
<p>of Menlo Park. That&rsquo;s right. And the amount of capital that it</p>
<p>takes to make these breakthroughs at alpha fold or at</p>
<p>Waymo, or what Bezos and Elon are doing is so extraordinary</p>
<p>that you have to be in a position where you can fund this</p>
<p>work, you&rsquo;re not going to get a bunch of kickstarters to fund a</p>
<p>SpaceX like project or a, you know, Blue Origin like project.</p>
<p>And so I think that the benefit of scale that comes out of some</p>
<p>of these businesses is that we can do research and development,</p>
<p>and we can progress our capabilities as a species forward</p>
<p>in a way that would have never been possible if not for the</p>
<p>capitalist system and the ability for these businesses to</p>
<p>accumulate a large enough pool of capital to take on multiple</p>
<p>billion dollar bets. And like Chamath said, waste a lot of</p>
<p>money and lose on nine out of 10 of them. But if that $1 billion</p>
<p>bet works, it&rsquo;s worth $500 billion. And that money</p>
<p>continuously gets reinvested. And look at what Google did with</p>
<p>Waymo, they put over a billion dollars in that project before</p>
<p>everyone woke up and said, my God, self driving is real, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>possible. And it kickstarted an industry. And I just feel like</p>
<p>the amount of money and not to mention the fact that like,</p>
<p>these are free markets. So these businesses, Google, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to search on Google, you don&rsquo;t have to buy from Amazon,</p>
<p>but everyone benefits from searching on Google, everyone</p>
<p>benefits from buying on Amazon. And the capability of these</p>
<p>businesses is rooted entirely on the fact that consumers are</p>
<p>choosing to use their products and their services, because they</p>
<p>are so good. And so I don&rsquo;t feel like these guys are screwing</p>
<p>people over, you can consider the small business model as</p>
<p>being like, you know, hey, maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t have had small</p>
<p>business retailers for as long as we did, because at some</p>
<p>point, distribution was going to be economically advantaged by</p>
<p>being centralized. And therefore all consumers are going to</p>
<p>benefit by centralizing. Is there really a right to</p>
<p>maintain local distribution sites that we call small</p>
<p>businesses that should remain in business forever? Maybe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a way to help them transition into a new business model or a</p>
<p>new market. But same with what happened with the taxi industry,</p>
<p>technology will force these evolutions, the capital</p>
<p>accumulates, and that capital can be invested in things that</p>
<p>we would have never imagined on a smaller scale. But go ahead.</p>
<p>No, I do think sympathetic to what you were saying. I do think</p>
<p>that if you look at every platform innovation that&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>happened, so whether it&rsquo;s, you know, we go from no print to</p>
<p>print, you know, to newspapers, to radio to television, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always first started with a pendulum that was very much</p>
<p>firmly in the camp of centralized, monopolistic or</p>
<p>oligopolistic kind of early outcomes. And either through</p>
<p>legislation or through innovation, then the pendulum</p>
<p>swings to decentralization that&rsquo;s typically happened,</p>
<p>right. And you can look at all of these industries that&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>through that. So it stands to reason that technology will be</p>
<p>not dissimilar to those things. And everybody says the argument</p>
<p>is well, no, because technology has these specific features of</p>
<p>network effects and lock in. But I think that betrays this idea</p>
<p>that legislatively, you can come and just basically destroy the</p>
<p>China in the China shop, and you have to just start all over. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that we&rsquo;re going to move to a place that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>healthier outcome for everybody. And obviously, we want things</p>
<p>like alpha fold to exist. And we want things like Waymo to exist.</p>
<p>The question is, how should they exist? And if they come out of</p>
<p>the goodwill of Google, it is just so easily as likely that</p>
<p>some other person, let&rsquo;s say it wasn&rsquo;t Sundar and Ruth Peratt.</p>
<p>But to other people who didn&rsquo;t like it, these things could have</p>
<p>been very different forms and shapes and not exist at all. And</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the arbitrary nature of it, which is not</p>
<p>necessarily free market capitalism that doesn&rsquo;t benefit</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>Should we come off be upset that Bezos is going to space and</p>
<p>spending 10s of billions of dollars that he made from</p>
<p>Amazon.</p>
<p>He had a bad press conference. Let&rsquo;s just be clear at the end</p>
<p>of the day, he has wanted to do this his entire life. He built</p>
<p>an incredible company, he was able to take a lot of that</p>
<p>capital and invested in it. He&rsquo;s invested billions of dollars in</p>
<p>other things $10 billion in climate change. His ex wife has</p>
<p>invested, you know, $6 billion just last year alone in all</p>
<p>kinds of good works. So those two individuals, because of</p>
<p>their success, I think will generally do and have done the</p>
<p>right thing. Let&rsquo;s not get that confused with a horrendous press</p>
<p>conference, where he just put</p>
<p>why was it horrendous?</p>
<p>Well, I think you said it, you know, the thing that he said</p>
<p>around, you know, I just want to thank the customers and the</p>
<p>employees for paying for this. It sounded flippant. And it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really acknowledge the incredible amount of heavy</p>
<p>lifting and hard work that he did acknowledge in the clip from</p>
<p>2000 on Charlie Rose, right. So if you if you actually played</p>
<p>those two things back side by side, you&rsquo;d say is this the same</p>
<p>person? One was thoughtful, extremely respectful. The other</p>
<p>one was now maybe he was just amped up. I mean, I could see I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what I think cloud nine, so to speak, you know, and</p>
<p>so and so he just wasn&rsquo;t thinking about it. But you know,</p>
<p>honestly, like, look, he is smart enough. And that team is</p>
<p>smart enough to say, we&rsquo;re assuming you&rsquo;re coming back. So</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some fucking talking points. Why don&rsquo;t you just look</p>
<p>at those on the way down as you float down to earth. And let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just make sure we nailed this and put our best foot forward.</p>
<p>That is where I think he probably has some regrets based</p>
<p>on how people reacted.</p>
<p>This Bezos spaceflight was a real Rorschach test because he</p>
<p>took heat from both the right and the left. But the criticism</p>
<p>was very different. You know, the critique I heard from the</p>
<p>right was that he&rsquo;s having some sort of midlife crisis, the</p>
<p>rocket looked too much like a phallus, okay, fine, whatever</p>
<p>that the criticism from the left was, it had much more to do with</p>
<p>a real contempt for private initiative and private</p>
<p>enterprise, you could almost see them being horrified and</p>
<p>dismayed that, you know, why was he doing this with his own</p>
<p>money? You know, if this had been a NASA flight, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they would have had a problem with it. And so you see</p>
<p>here that even though Bezos has been so much more effective</p>
<p>using his own money to do this, the left is reflexively hates</p>
<p>that. And, and they kept saying, well, how dare he use this</p>
<p>money, the money could have been used on something else so</p>
<p>much better. Well, what do you think of that argument? Yeah, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s wrong in a couple of respects. It basically implies</p>
<p>that the purveyors of these social programs are better</p>
<p>distributors of societal resources than our greatest</p>
<p>inventors. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true. You look at these</p>
<p>social programs, they want to keep doubling down on they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not working. You know, these programs are policies towards</p>
<p>homelessness is not failing because of lack of funding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of funding. In San Francisco,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re spending $60,000 per tent per year, they&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>$300,000 in social services per homeless person per year. Lack</p>
<p>of funding is not the problem. The approach is the problem. We</p>
<p>spend something like $25,000 per pupil in California schools,</p>
<p>the test scores are going down. So you know, these people who</p>
<p>are criticizing Bezos don&rsquo;t know what to do with the money. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to spend it any better. They&rsquo;re not good at</p>
<p>executing. However, Bezos or Elon, these are two of our</p>
<p>greatest inventors, let them go, let them go. Because you know,</p>
<p>they are pushing the boundaries. And I do believe there will be</p>
<p>great engineering and scientific breakthroughs that come as a</p>
<p>result of what they&rsquo;re doing with this new space race.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also super uninformed if correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here,</p>
<p>but they were saying that the they should have been doing</p>
<p>more initiatives on earth if you actually and they were kind of</p>
<p>talking about climate change and the use of these fuels to get to</p>
<p>space. And number one, the rocket ship fuel, my</p>
<p>understanding in these is less than the what happens in a 747.</p>
<p>So put that aside. And then second, Elon has done more for</p>
<p>global warming with Tesla than anybody in the in the battery</p>
<p>packs, I think in modern society, I can&rsquo;t think of</p>
<p>somebody in the private sector who&rsquo;s done more. And then has</p>
<p>there ever been a gift, there&rsquo;s never been a gift of $10 billion</p>
<p>to one cause, let alone one cause which Bezos gave, which</p>
<p>was climate change. Nobody, nobody has done more. So hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you would know Chamath, I thought Richard Branson had done</p>
<p>a lot for global warming. I thought he was very involved in</p>
<p>the carbon credits space.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re witnessing something that can best be</p>
<p>described as people who have reached a point in their life</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve realized that they&rsquo;re impotent, getting</p>
<p>incredibly angry at people who are willing to be wrong, but</p>
<p>want to just have a chance to be on the field and try and have</p>
<p>the freedom to do so. And that just literally infuriates a</p>
<p>certain class of people. It proves itself out by what David</p>
<p>said, we are not in a funding crisis, we are running 10 $20</p>
<p>trillion deficits, you know, or sorry, 10, you know, hundreds of</p>
<p>billions of dollar deficits, 10 $20 trillion debt levels that</p>
<p>are increasing every year. We have a surfeit of money. We</p>
<p>print money whenever we want, we don&rsquo;t have a shortage of</p>
<p>money. We have a shortage of capable people who know what to</p>
<p>do with that money. And in the absence of people being able to</p>
<p>do things, they would rather other people not do things not</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not the right thing to do, but because it makes them</p>
<p>feel impotent.</p>
<p>Right. And so what what is what is driving that I think you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real contempt for private initiative. And Jason,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, you see it in the hatred towards Elon, nobody has</p>
<p>done more to actually reduce carbon emissions than Elon. I</p>
<p>mean, even the best end of story, period end of story. I</p>
<p>mean, the best gift to some philanthropy, I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make a difference or not. You&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s putting his money where his mouth is on that</p>
<p>issue. But it&rsquo;s indisputable that Elon, the electric car</p>
<p>industry would not exist without Elon. And yet there is contempt</p>
<p>and hatred for the fact that he did this through private</p>
<p>initiative.</p>
<p>If the guy does he does it in a way that is not checking the</p>
<p>boxes for this cohort of people who feel incredibly insecure and</p>
<p>fragile emotionally. They don&rsquo;t like that he says what he wants.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like that he does what he wants. They don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that he dresses the way he does. They don&rsquo;t like any of it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not conformist enough. It&rsquo;s not about the look</p>
<p>people. It&rsquo;s also about the money that it&rsquo;s the wealth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been accumulated to hold on. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>is at all. No, I actually think what it is is psychological. It</p>
<p>is nothing about money. I think what we are witnessing and I</p>
<p>think social media has just blown the cover off it is a</p>
<p>psychological awakening that people have, which is that they</p>
<p>were comfortable knowing that there was a class of insiders,</p>
<p>and a huge cohort of outsiders. And they just believe the world</p>
<p>would function as it should. Now you see people migrating through</p>
<p>this membrane, achieving enormous amounts of success,</p>
<p>basically eclipsing every single insider possible by orders of</p>
<p>magnitude. And it breaks people&rsquo;s brains, because they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like it. Because now they think, why did it happen to me?</p>
<p>Why not me? And the thing is, because you&rsquo;re not capable. And</p>
<p>at somewhere along the way, I&rsquo;m working, you&rsquo;re not dedicated,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t try or you didn&rsquo;t try.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t act with agency.</p>
<p>I mean, look, every day, every day, the greatest thing that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned about the public markets now, having been, you</p>
<p>know, purely on the early stage technology side, building,</p>
<p>running, then investing, is I get a mark every day, right now</p>
<p>to do both businesses, I get a scorecard every day. And some</p>
<p>days, I really think to myself, maybe I&rsquo;m just not good enough</p>
<p>today. And I say to myself, that is true today. And then the</p>
<p>difference is tomorrow, I have a choice, which is I wake up and I</p>
<p>decide, am I going to go back at it or not?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a game. And I&rsquo;m not going to hate on other people</p>
<p>who had a good day today, just because I had a bad day. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I think we&rsquo;re going through. We&rsquo;re going through and</p>
<p>social media allows it to happen. And it allows you to</p>
<p>put it out there. You can hide behind a screen name, you can</p>
<p>basically say whatever you want to vent this pent up</p>
<p>frustration. One journalist doing it. Of course, of course,</p>
<p>because these journalists are doing it to where they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>so bitter that they feel dunking on the greatest</p>
<p>inventors of our time is a productive use. The difference</p>
<p>is journalists do it with the real screen name under the guise</p>
<p>of journalism. Everybody else does it with the fake screen</p>
<p>name. And it&rsquo;s all just a bunch of trolling.</p>
<p>In order to do something really great, like Bezos, or like Elon,</p>
<p>you have to believe that you have agency over your own life,</p>
<p>you have to believe that you can accomplish great things. You</p>
<p>have to, you know, act with with purpose. And is that really what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re teaching kids to do today in schools, what we&rsquo;re teaching</p>
<p>them is they&rsquo;re either victims, or oppressors at some</p>
<p>intersectional framework. We&rsquo;re not teaching them about earned</p>
<p>success, we&rsquo;re teaching them about privilege, which is, you</p>
<p>know, is presumptively ill gotten. And it&rsquo;s all about a</p>
<p>transference of privilege, and, and basically money from people</p>
<p>who are oppressors in this framework to people who are</p>
<p>victims. But no one&rsquo;s talking about how you actually create</p>
<p>change and success in abundance. It&rsquo;s all a negative sum. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always a negative sum game.</p>
<p>Freeberg, go ahead.</p>
<p>I did it all back to the Kim Kardashian sex tape. I think</p>
<p>that there was this moment where someone who was didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything, didn&rsquo;t have a career wasn&rsquo;t doing anything workwise,</p>
<p>but was kind of a pseudo celebrity for being a celebrity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie era, right? Like,</p>
<p>folks who don&rsquo;t really have much to talk about, except that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones that people are talking about. And then that</p>
<p>sex tape turned her into a superstar. And then she became a</p>
<p>billionaire a few years later. And so, you know, there, there</p>
<p>is this kind of poignant moment, I think, where folks are like,</p>
<p>wait a second, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything to get really rich</p>
<p>in this country, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything to achieve all</p>
<p>this fame. Therefore, the the kind of assumption is, hey, you</p>
<p>know what, there are people that just get stuff and get to do</p>
<p>what they want to do. And the rest of us don&rsquo;t. And I do think</p>
<p>that social media is the magnifying glass that takes</p>
<p>those those moments and makes them very big. And kind of then</p>
<p>that becomes the assumed standard, when the reality is, I</p>
<p>mean, all four of us work really fucking hard. All four of us</p>
<p>came from nothing. I don&rsquo;t know about sacks. But I mean, the</p>
<p>rest of us, his dad was an immigrant doctor from South</p>
<p>Africa, and he moved to the south as a Jew. I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>80s. I mean, I think all of us graduated college deeply in</p>
<p>debt. And then we all worked our way out of debt. And we all</p>
<p>found ways to work really hard and find opportunities for</p>
<p>ourselves in this incredible country. And to build value and</p>
<p>to build businesses can be done to realize those returns. And we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t start out as elites. We were never elite, we were always</p>
<p>the struggling, you know, immigrant entrepreneurs that got</p>
<p>ourselves to where we are, because we clawed and we pushed</p>
<p>and we fought and we had grit, and we had determination, and we</p>
<p>had smarts, and we had put in the effort. And I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really and so did Bezos, and so did Ilan. And I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that there is any standard of elitism that endowed</p>
<p>in them, like maybe in, you know, the British, the days of</p>
<p>the British monarchy, these kind of inalienable rights to have</p>
<p>the freedom that they have. And I think that that and I think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s so important, because people miss that point.</p>
<p>And they think that Kim Kardashian, or the random bolt</p>
<p>of lightning or the elite is the kind of endowed upon people</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s unfair.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re misreading the situation. Everyone else is</p>
<p>missing out. Yeah, they misread the situation.</p>
<p>So a couple things. Kim Kardashian may have gotten some</p>
<p>initial fame because of her sex tape. But fuck if she&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>incredible business person, because from there to now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s execution. Totally. There&rsquo;s a lot of there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of toiling hard work, good decision making. She fucking</p>
<p>nailed it. Was I lucky to have actually joined Facebook versus</p>
<p>MySpace? Yes. But when I was there, did I fucking hit the</p>
<p>cover off the ball? Goddamn? Yes. You know, was I lucky to</p>
<p>have started social capital and be able to raise capital? Sure.</p>
<p>But then did I have to help find a team, coach that team work</p>
<p>with them make good investments. That&rsquo;s fucking hard. And I think</p>
<p>what people forget is that this takes a lot of hard work, that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of levels of success that you can be proud of</p>
<p>all kinds of different accomplishments. What I loved is</p>
<p>when Friedberg used us, and Ilan and Bezos in the same</p>
<p>sentence, because I catch myself where I&rsquo;m ashamed sometimes</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like, I am not as good as those two guys. So how dare I</p>
<p>use my name in the same sentence as their name? And then I think,</p>
<p>wait a minute, what the fuck am I quibbling over? Like, this is</p>
<p>insane in any way, shape or form. We&rsquo;ve all made it sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different degrees, but it&rsquo;s beyond that it matters at</p>
<p>this point. And this is what I think we&rsquo;re living in a society</p>
<p>where it really distorts you. So if how do we change it?</p>
<p>Chamath? How do we change people from thinking that it&rsquo;s random</p>
<p>and that you can&rsquo;t do it? Because there are people who</p>
<p>are no, it is random. But there are a group of people who</p>
<p>believe the system is rigged. I cannot become Chamath. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>stuck in a rut and I can&rsquo;t get out. I can&rsquo;t get out. How do we</p>
<p>change that? But we have the whiners and the complainers and</p>
<p>the haters are stuck in a massive rut. And I think the</p>
<p>thing that happened that I said it last pod, I&rsquo;ll say it again,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;ll just say it every fucking pod. It is not about</p>
<p>winning and losing. It is about trying and learning. And that is</p>
<p>a huge thing. It&rsquo;s about a learning mindset. It&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>this idea that things are changing so fucking fast. The</p>
<p>only thing that I can do to stay safe is to learn how to learn</p>
<p>because things will constantly be changing underfoot.</p>
<p>But what do you say to the single mother with three kids</p>
<p>who is in a town where the factory is shutting down and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s losing her job and she doesn&rsquo;t have the resources to</p>
<p>move? She is not the person that hates Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. I</p>
<p>will fucking but what did she do? Because aren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>institutional ruts in the United States? Yeah, yeah, I</p>
<p>understand. These are two completely different topics. My</p>
<p>point is, if you go online, it is filled with Pete, a small</p>
<p>cohort of people that are positive. And then a large</p>
<p>cohort of people that are silently trying to just gain</p>
<p>information out and a small vocal minority of bitter people</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t do shit. And all I&rsquo;m talking about is people. Well,</p>
<p>who knows if they&rsquo;re privileged, but I&rsquo;m just saying they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>here getting paid 100,000 to work at the Atlantic. I just</p>
<p>think that these people have been checkboxes their whole</p>
<p>lives. They tried to play the team sports they were told to</p>
<p>they went to the schools, they tried to do the CFA, the MBA,</p>
<p>the this or the that. Nothing worked for them. They work in an</p>
<p>environment where they don&rsquo;t feel any equity. Actually, this</p>
<p>is where equity is important. They feel disenfranchised, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re angry. And as a result, they just want everything to be</p>
<p>different so that nobody wins because they can&rsquo;t win. But if</p>
<p>they were winning, they would be the first one to say shut the</p>
<p>fucking door behind me. I&rsquo;m convinced of it. 100.</p>
<p>The irony is that the people you&rsquo;re talking about all went to</p>
<p>these elite institutions. And they imbibed these ideologies</p>
<p>and philosophies. And I think the people who have been</p>
<p>successful, went to those not in all cases, but they went to those</p>
<p>places and then rebelled against it or just shut it out.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we should do. Here&rsquo;s what we should do. We should all</p>
<p>contribute five or 10 million bucks into a into an LLC, we</p>
<p>should call Pegasus, we should use Pegasus to infiltrate all</p>
<p>the fake screen names on Twitter, and then index that to</p>
<p>LinkedIn to figure out where they all went to school and what</p>
<p>they do and just publish a database of all the haters.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s how funny would that be?</p>
<p>I it&rsquo;s very interesting, because I&rsquo;m watching a group of these</p>
<p>complainers leave traditional mainstream media, because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>focused on journalists, because I was one. And I&rsquo;m watching them</p>
<p>leave journalism, a small group of them, and become</p>
<p>entrepreneurs on substack or their own products. And I feel</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a little group of them who are realizing, holy</p>
<p>shit, I can make $1 million. If I apply myself, and I quit the</p>
<p>New York Times, and I go start my own publication,</p>
<p>right. And I actually see something interesting and</p>
<p>differentiated, not just towing the party line at the New York</p>
<p>Times. There&rsquo;s a whole little, there&rsquo;s a little crack here in</p>
<p>this, like, I&rsquo;ll say, I&rsquo;ll say they are just as successful as</p>
<p>Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos. The the financial quantum may be</p>
<p>different. But I bet you the personal fucking satisfaction</p>
<p>quantum is the same. And this is the key. This is the key, you</p>
<p>could be running a $500,000 a year business. And you could</p>
<p>feel like a million fucking bucks. You&rsquo;re a nice house. Yeah,</p>
<p>you have a nice house, no nice family, you know, you employ a</p>
<p>couple people, you provide a good life, you do what you want</p>
<p>to do when you want to do it. The sense of freedom that comes</p>
<p>with that and power and agency is the same as them. And maybe</p>
<p>in some ways, the super richest guys in the world actually have</p>
<p>less agency than these guys would. Because they&rsquo;re so, you</p>
<p>know, scheduled, and people are coming after them all the time.</p>
<p>One of my big takeaways from being in the tech industry for</p>
<p>20 years is that if you&rsquo;re smart, hardworking, and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have behaviors that sabotage yourself, you will be</p>
<p>successful in this industry. You know, over two decades, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it. How could you not you have such tailwinds at your</p>
<p>back, there&rsquo;s so much value being created. We saw over the</p>
<p>past year, more money, more LP dollars have gone into venture</p>
<p>capital by far than any other year. And more money, more</p>
<p>returns is coming out. That&rsquo;s why more money is going to I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>the call. When you say anybody could be successful just by</p>
<p>showing right. And you said that, but the first part is the</p>
<p>critical part, you just said who are not prone to self sabotage.</p>
<p>There is an enormous number of people who are prone to self I</p>
<p>was one I am still one. But I</p>
<p>brought to yourself your ego, he blew up his firm. That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But I think he blew it up. Because there was creative</p>
<p>destruction. I think he wasn&rsquo;t enjoying it. And he needed to</p>
<p>start talking about it publicly. He said it. But the blowing up</p>
<p>of when you How do you reconcile the blowing up of the firm</p>
<p>Chamath, whatever number of years later, I&rsquo;m rebooting.</p>
<p>This is all old news. It&rsquo;s like, you know, the amount of success</p>
<p>in capital and money that we&rsquo;ve made is undisputable. And I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made it under all kinds of weather conditions. So you know,</p>
<p>it all kind of speaks for itself. But the problem is,</p>
<p>again, if you ask an average person, I don&rsquo;t think they care.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they know. I don&rsquo;t think they have an opinion. If</p>
<p>you ask some, you know,</p>
<p>interested in how you reconcile or look back on it. Now, it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much distance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you from an outside perspective, how I reconcile</p>
<p>Chamath decision there is I think that as you become more</p>
<p>successful, your tolerance for doing stuff you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>really goes down.</p>
<p>It goes to zero.</p>
<p>Chamath has got to a point where he didn&rsquo;t want to be doing and</p>
<p>he blew it up zero.</p>
<p>By the way, that that is a characterization as well that</p>
<p>you know, sometimes in in your career, you have to make it and</p>
<p>in your personal life, you have to make a tough decision. And</p>
<p>there is no good outcome. There is no good way to do it. But</p>
<p>there are these moments where you got a rock falling on you</p>
<p>from one side and a rock falling on you from the other side. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to make a tough decision to get out of</p>
<p>the way</p>
<p>I said to myself a long time ago, that if I was ever lucky to</p>
<p>actually be wealthy enough where my wealth would change by</p>
<p>meaningful amounts, every order of magnitude, I would do</p>
<p>something different. And so you know, you can do the fucking</p>
<p>math. So there it is.</p>
<p>I see. It&rsquo;s interesting being friends with you and watching it</p>
<p>and then also, I hate to give credit, there it is. But being</p>
<p>friends with Phil Hellmuth, and watching him set outrageous</p>
<p>goals for himself in poker. I just thought, you know what, you</p>
<p>got to set some outrageous goals for yourself. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how I sort of broke through as I just said, the minute that I</p>
<p>realized one at everything I do, I want to be the largest</p>
<p>syndicate, the most Jason prolific investor,</p>
<p>the minute I realized that I was basically going to become, you</p>
<p>know, a billionaire because of my Facebook stock, I fucking</p>
<p>quit. And the craziest thing about it is I left so much stock</p>
<p>on the table. It&rsquo;s like two $3 billion of fucking stock, I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t care less. And then and then, you know, once I figured</p>
<p>out that there was something that you can do with capital,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even more meaningful than just investing in companies at</p>
<p>a small scale. But now you can, you know, control companies and</p>
<p>really allocate and shape how economy flows. I made a</p>
<p>different set of decisions. And now I&rsquo;m here. And if I increase</p>
<p>it by another order of magnitude, I&rsquo;ll make a</p>
<p>different set of decisions. And that&rsquo;s poorly understood by</p>
<p>folks, because again, it doesn&rsquo;t map into a worldview. But the</p>
<p>point is, it maps into something that keeps me whole and sane.</p>
<p>And it allows me to not be zero sum about everybody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>success. And that&rsquo;s what I think we need to teach people</p>
<p>try stuff. It&rsquo;s okay to fail. Because that&rsquo;s as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not self sabotaging yourself. David said it so well, you will</p>
<p>eventually be successful.</p>
<p>What have you learned, David? You know, in this next chapter</p>
<p>being an investor capital allocator?</p>
<p>That me?</p>
<p>Yeah, David, you? Well, that&rsquo;s what I just Yeah,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s what I said. I mean, just Well, I mean, the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening right now is just the tech economy keeps</p>
<p>getting bigger and bigger. It&rsquo;s just an explosion. There&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>explosion in the number of unicorns, explosion in the</p>
<p>amount of funding that&rsquo;s available, explosion in the</p>
<p>amount of returns being generated. There are now so many</p>
<p>VCs that VCs are literally throwing money at people. I</p>
<p>mean, any half decent idea now gets funded. The idea that</p>
<p>somehow this ecosystem is elitist or exclusionary. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absurd, right? I mean, you&rsquo;ve got micro VCs now who you know,</p>
<p>one has to go to Sand Hill Road anymore, right? I mean, there</p>
<p>are so many ways to</p>
<p>nobody on Sand Hill Road. It&rsquo;s a ghost town. Remember traffic</p>
<p>jam? I went I went down there the other day. And there was no</p>
<p>traffic jam. I was speaking at Stanford. And literally, I was</p>
<p>like, I got to put 15 minutes into my drive to get through</p>
<p>that Sand Hill Road, because it was at 830. I zipped down Sand</p>
<p>Hill Road to Stanford, there was two cars.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem is so osmotic, it&rsquo;s so permeable in</p>
<p>terms of allowing new people in, in fact, it&rsquo;s sucking in all the</p>
<p>talent it can find, because it can&rsquo;t hire enough people, even</p>
<p>in the worst economic conditions. And yet, when it</p>
<p>comes to talking about social and political, talking about</p>
<p>opportunity in social and political terms, the only thing</p>
<p>you ever hear is that, you know, the ecosystem is somehow elitist</p>
<p>or exclusionary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s old. That&rsquo;s old news that that might have been valid</p>
<p>1520 years ago. I know when I went to Sand Hill Road for the</p>
<p>first time 1520 years ago, it was a bunch of white partners</p>
<p>who went to Stanford or had a MBAs from, you know, Harvard,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the case. Now. It&rsquo;s a bunch of people with</p>
<p>rolling funds and micro VCs and syndicates totally and everything</p>
<p>in between.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so wrapped up in being a social justice warrior, that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just missed, that there is like basically infinite</p>
<p>opportunity, you know, then it&rsquo;s on you, you&rsquo;re sabotaging</p>
<p>yourself. And then 510 years later, you&rsquo;re still stuck in</p>
<p>that role. And then you become bitter, and then you become</p>
<p>bitter to Jamal&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>Freeberg, how hard was it for you to leave Google? And what</p>
<p>was that like?</p>
<p>I was at Google for two and a half years. I had gone through I</p>
<p>joined before the IPO, I was like, couple hundred employees,</p>
<p>just under 1000 employees. And then we went public. I got this</p>
<p>huge bonus from Sergey to stick around. When I was thinking, I</p>
<p>mean, for me, it was like, seven figures. It was. Yeah, it was a</p>
<p>couple 1000 shares of stock, and like $250,000 of cash. And I</p>
<p>gave it up, you know, be worth a lot of money. But I just felt</p>
<p>like I learned so much at Google. And I had such an</p>
<p>appreciation for the team there in the company. And by the way,</p>
<p>I worked at Google. And all of a sudden, the company went public</p>
<p>and I could buy a house. I mean, it was an incredible moment for</p>
<p>me. And, and I suddenly felt what Jamal talked about, which</p>
<p>is this freedom in my life, suddenly, I had hit that that</p>
<p>next plateau of wealth, where I now had a couple $100,000 of</p>
<p>net worth. And I could leave, or I guess I had over a million</p>
<p>dollars of net worth, and I could now leave and go do</p>
<p>something I wanted to go do with my night, I had a couple</p>
<p>$100,000. And I could go leave and do what I wanted to do,</p>
<p>which was to build my own business and have the freedom to</p>
<p>make decisions. And, and so I honestly felt like really fine</p>
<p>just leaving all that money behind, I left, I left millions</p>
<p>of dollars behind. For when I left Google after being there</p>
<p>for two and a half years to start my company. And, you know,</p>
<p>it was a struggle, right? Like, I mean, as you guys know,</p>
<p>building a business, which I did from 2006 to 2013, was a</p>
<p>nightmare. Every day was a nightmare. I say, in</p>
<p>entrepreneurship, I&rsquo;ve said this publicly before, but it feels</p>
<p>like every day, you&rsquo;re taking a step backwards. And one out of</p>
<p>five days, you take a five step leap forward. So at the end of</p>
<p>a week, you&rsquo;re one step ahead of where you started, but your</p>
<p>existential memory is that you&rsquo;re failing every day, every</p>
<p>day, and suddenly you wake up and seven years have gone by,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, Oh, shit, we&rsquo;ve got an amazing business. And</p>
<p>someone wants to buy it for a billion dollars. And if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the grit and the guts, and the determination to</p>
<p>push through those those daily battles and deal with that,</p>
<p>that hardship, you know, and I don&rsquo;t think that being in the</p>
<p>comfort of the big system of Google felt right for me, I</p>
<p>think being in the playing field and battling it out every day</p>
<p>is right for me. And so it was the right, it was the right call</p>
<p>for me, obviously, it worked out. But you know, still, I make</p>
<p>choices in my life in terms of what do I want to do? Do I want</p>
<p>to go live on a yacht or have some luxury or do whatever? And</p>
<p>I prefer to just make great businesses and turn science into</p>
<p>into commercial opportunity. And that&rsquo;s how I choose to spend my</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to send this out to the whole panel. Do you</p>
<p>ever think, you know, having hit the home runs, and having the</p>
<p>cash to literally retire at this age, and then just, you know,</p>
<p>kiteboard or do whatever? Do you ever think about retirement</p>
<p>and not going into work?</p>
<p>Fuck? No.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah. You want to do you feel you want to work harder?</p>
<p>Yesterday, yesterday, as an example, was an incredible day,</p>
<p>because I was able to bicycle with Nat and the youngest to go</p>
<p>get a gelato. I had a kickoff meeting for I had a kickoff</p>
<p>meeting for a startup that&rsquo;s doing something incredible in</p>
<p>batteries. Where, you know, starting from scratch, series a</p>
<p>co founders, me and the other into the other director. And</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting literally starting and I remember the</p>
<p>feeling of having done this now 30 or 40 times and it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>feeling.</p>
<p>La Dolce Vita.</p>
<p>And then I and then I had a call because I&rsquo;m trying to put a you</p>
<p>know, more than a billion dollars to work in a different</p>
<p>battery idea. And I thought to myself, God, I, I&rsquo;m so fucking</p>
<p>lucky. And it&rsquo;s, it was a grindy long day, and I had never felt</p>
<p>more thankful. So why would I, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, I feel</p>
<p>just so blessed.</p>
<p>Sachs, you ever think about hanging up? Or are you more</p>
<p>motivated to go to work every day? Are you annoyed?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the thing that&rsquo;s given me the most energy right</p>
<p>now is we&rsquo;re in a private beta on Colin, you&rsquo;re this app that</p>
<p>we incubated. And I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s good. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting better every day. And I&rsquo;m really enjoying tinkering on</p>
<p>it. And I feel like, you know, I, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>a tinkerer, by the way, you&rsquo;re a good product. You&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good at tickling.</p>
<p>We, you know, we tried to hire sacks as VP of product at</p>
<p>Facebook. What? Yeah. What would that have paid him?</p>
<p>I used 2000 sacks, probably seven billions, probably 2007.</p>
<p>No, no, because I did the hammer instead. And you know, Yammer was</p>
<p>successful. And I got to be my own boss. And that was better,</p>
<p>you know, so I don&rsquo;t know if I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have made as</p>
<p>much money. But look, I&rsquo;ve done. Like you guys, I&rsquo;ve done made</p>
<p>lots of decisions that may be less money. If I just stayed at</p>
<p>PayPal for 20 years, my stock would have been worth many, many</p>
<p>billions, right? That&rsquo;s why I tell people don&rsquo;t sell</p>
<p>everything. Let your winners ride at least partially. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, my, I was an investor in Facebook. If I just</p>
<p>kept all of that stock, that&rsquo;d be worth a billion dollars today.</p>
<p>So I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty crazy. Well, sell some just don&rsquo;t sell</p>
<p>everything. That&rsquo;s my new philosophy. Yeah. So your point</p>
<p>about to your point about what gives me enjoyment. I mean, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really having fun tinkering with this app. And you know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like? It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like a new season. If you&rsquo;re in like the</p>
<p>NBA or something, it&rsquo;s like, can we make a championship run? Can</p>
<p>we get one more ring? You know? And so you&rsquo;re like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be like saying to somebody, hey, you already got, you know,</p>
<p>to NBA and NBA champion. Hey, you got three rings. Why do you</p>
<p>want a fourth? You know? And it&rsquo;s like, are you kidding me</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m still in this league? Well, I&rsquo;m young enough and</p>
<p>healthy enough to make a run at one at one more ring. How could</p>
<p>you not want to do that? You know, you got to go for it. I</p>
<p>can see you are you&rsquo;re engaged, which is great to see. All</p>
<p>right. Listen, this has been an amazing episode. We will see you</p>
<p>all next week. If you like the show. Thanks. The end. We&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>everybody go try something, anything possible. Try and fail.</p>
<p>Read a book. Read something that you wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise</p>
<p>read. Love you guys. But I love you guys. Love you. See you</p>
<p>soon. Everybody listening to everybody. I mean, literally, if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re listening to this, and you are buying into this that</p>
<p>the system is ready to troll. Don&rsquo;t be a troll. Don&rsquo;t be a</p>
<p>douche. Like the system is not rigged. If anything, the system</p>
<p>is rigged for you to participate and succeed. Join the party. The</p>
<p>system is malleable. The system is about this. If you want to</p>
<p>change the world, the system is malleable enough that if you</p>
<p>pursue it in the right way, you can make it you can make a dent.</p>
<p>You can. Who is this? Who is this little search? Hey, look</p>
<p>how happy you are. Who&rsquo;s the best dad? Where&rsquo;s your dad? All</p>
<p>right, we&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the online podcast. Bye</p>
<p>bye.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man David</p>
<p>we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>love us</p>
<p>besties are gone</p>
<p>that is my dog taking a notice your driveway</p>
<p>we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just like this like sexual tension but</p>
<p>they just need to release</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a bee</p>
<p>waiting to get</p>
