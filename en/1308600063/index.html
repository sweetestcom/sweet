    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Justin Sonnenberg.</p>
<p>Dr. Sonnenberg is a professor of microbiology</p>
<p>and immunology at Stanford School of Medicine,</p>
<p>and one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts</p>
<p>on the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The gut microbiome is the existence</p>
<p>of trillions of little microorganisms throughout your gut.</p>
<p>And by your gut, I don&rsquo;t just mean your stomach,</p>
<p>I mean your entire digestive tract.</p>
<p>It turns out we also have a microbiome</p>
<p>that exists in our nose, in any other location</p>
<p>in which our body interfaces with the outside world.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a microbiome on your skin.</p>
<p>And while it might seem kind of intrusive</p>
<p>or kind of disgusting to have</p>
<p>all these little microorganisms,</p>
<p>they can be immensely beneficial for our health,</p>
<p>meaning our hormonal health, our brain health,</p>
<p>and our immune system function.</p>
<p>Dr. Sonnenberg teaches us about the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s organized spatially,</p>
<p>meaning which microbiota live where.</p>
<p>He teaches us about these incredible things</p>
<p>called crypts and niches,</p>
<p>which are little caves within our digestive tract</p>
<p>that certain microbiota take residence.</p>
<p>And at that premier real estate,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to do incredible things to support our health.</p>
<p>He also talks about the things that we can all do</p>
<p>to support our microbiome in order for our microbiome</p>
<p>to support our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Dr. Sonnenberg co-runs his laboratory with his spouse,</p>
<p>Dr. Erika Sonnenberg,</p>
<p>and together they&rsquo;ve also written a terrific</p>
<p>and highly informative book called</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Good Gut,&rsquo; Taking Control of Your Weight,</p>
<p>Your Mood, and Your Long-Term Health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though that book was written a few years back,</p>
<p>the information still holds up very nicely.</p>
<p>And today he also builds on that information,</p>
<p>informing us about recent studies that, for instance,</p>
<p>point to the important role of fermented foods</p>
<p>and the role of fiber in supporting a healthy gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve heard about the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>or even if you haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>today you&rsquo;re going to hear about it</p>
<p>from one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts.</p>
<p>He makes it immensely clear as to what it is,</p>
<p>how it functions, and how to support it</p>
<p>for your brain and body health.</p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t just talk about nutrition.</p>
<p>We also talk about the impact of behaviors</p>
<p>and the microbiome.</p>
<p>Behaviors such as who you touch, who you kiss, who you hug,</p>
<p>whether or not you interact with or avoid animals,</p>
<p>whether or not those animals belong to you,</p>
<p>or whether or not they belong to somebody else.</p>
<p>If all that sounds a little bit bizarre,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll soon understand that your microbiome</p>
<p>is constantly being modified by the behavioral interactions,</p>
<p>the nutritional interactions,</p>
<p>and indeed your mood and internal reactions</p>
<p>to the outside world.</p>
<p>This is an incredible system.</p>
<p>Everyone has one.</p>
<p>Everyone should know how it works,</p>
<p>and everyone should know how to optimize it.</p>
<p>And today, you&rsquo;re going to learn all of that</p>
<p>from Dr. Sonnenberg.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>

<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Justin Sonnenberg.</p>
<p>Justin, thanks so much for being here.</p>
<p>Great to be here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I am a true novice when it comes to the microbiome.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to start off with a really basic question,</p>
<p>which is what is the microbiome?</p>
<p>I imagine lots of little bugs running around in my gut,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t quite like the image of that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m aware that our microbiome can be good for us,</p>
<p>but we can also have an unhealthy microbiome.</p>
<p>So if I were to look at the microbiome at the scale</p>
<p>that I could see the meaningful things,</p>
<p>what would it look like and what&rsquo;s going on in there?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, essentially you&rsquo;re correct.</p>
<p>I mean, we have all of these little microorganisms</p>
<p>running around in our gut.</p>
<p>I think, you know,</p>
<p>just to start off with clarifying terminology,</p>
<p>microbiome and microbiota quite often are referred to,</p>
<p>are used to refer to our microbial community interchangeably,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll probably switch between those two terms today.</p>
<p>The other important thing to realize</p>
<p>is that these microbes are not just in our gut,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all over our body.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in our nose, they&rsquo;re in our mouths,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on our skin.</p>
<p>And so basically anywhere that the environment can get to</p>
<p>in our body, which includes inside our digestive tract,</p>
<p>of course, is colonized with microbes.</p>
<p>And the vast majority of these are in our distal gut</p>
<p>and in our colon.</p>
<p>And so this is the gut microbiota or gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And the density of this community is astounding.</p>
<p>I mean, it really is.</p>
<p>If you get down to the scale of, you know,</p>
<p>being able to see individual microbes, you know,</p>
<p>you start off with a zoomed out view</p>
<p>and you see something that looks like, you know,</p>
<p>fecal material, the digesta inside the gut,</p>
<p>and you zoom in and you start to, you know,</p>
<p>get to the microscopic level and see the microbes,</p>
<p>they are just packed, you know, side to side, end to end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a super dense bacterial community,</p>
<p>almost like a biofilm, you know,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s just made up of microbes</p>
<p>to the point where it&rsquo;s thought that, you know,</p>
<p>around 30% of fecal matter is microbes, 30 to 50%.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s an incredibly dense microbial community.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking of, you know, trillions of microbial cells</p>
<p>and all those microbial cells,</p>
<p>if you start to get to know them and see who they are,</p>
<p>break out in the gut probably to hundreds</p>
<p>to a thousand species,</p>
<p>depending upon how you define microbial species.</p>
<p>And then most of these are bacteria,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of other life forms there.</p>
<p>There are archaea, which are little microbes</p>
<p>that are bacteria-like, but they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>There are eukaryotes.</p>
<p>So, you know, we commonly think of eukaryotes in the gut</p>
<p>as, you know, something like a parasite,</p>
<p>but there are eukaryotes, there are fungi,</p>
<p>there are also little viruses.</p>
<p>There are these bacteriophages that infect bacterial cells.</p>
<p>And those actually outnumber the bacteria like 10 to one.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just everywhere there.</p>
<p>They kill bacteria.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s these really interesting</p>
<p>predator-prey interactions,</p>
<p>but overall it&rsquo;s just this really dense,</p>
<p>complex, dynamic ecosystem.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about the human</p>
<p>as a single species,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also thinking of the human</p>
<p>as this complex integrated ecosystem</p>
<p>of hundreds to thousands of species</p>
<p>interacting in concert to do all the fantastic things</p>
<p>that we know happen in the human body.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a lot of cargo.</p>
<p>Or maybe we&rsquo;re the cargo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there have been people</p>
<p>that have likened humans to just a really elaborate</p>
<p>culturing flask for microbes,</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ve actually been designed</p>
<p>over the course of evolution,</p>
<p>designed to just efficiently propagate</p>
<p>this microbial culture from person to person,</p>
<p>from generation to generation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a different way of thinking of the human body.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I believe that our pH,</p>
<p>or the pH of our digestive system varies as you descend,</p>
<p>as you go from mouth to, you know, to throat and stomach.</p>
<p>And you said that most of the microbiota</p>
<p>are in the distal colon.</p>
<p>Are there distinct forms of microbiota</p>
<p>all along the length of the digestive tract</p>
<p>and within these other interfaces with the outside world?</p>
<p>Totally, yeah.</p>
<p>So it starts like with our teeth,</p>
<p>and in our mouth and saliva, there&rsquo;s a oral microbiota.</p>
<p>These microbial species are very different</p>
<p>than the ones that you find in the digestive tract.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually, you know,</p>
<p>built to deal with oxygen very well.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know, in an area</p>
<p>that is exposed to a lot of oxygen.</p>
<p>They, of course, see different nutrients</p>
<p>than, for instance, a colonic bacteria would see.</p>
<p>And they grow quite often in mats that live,</p>
<p>you know, on teeth.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very structured in terms of,</p>
<p>and not moving around a lot.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very fairly stationary.</p>
<p>As you move down the digestive tract,</p>
<p>there are microbes in our esophagus and our stomach,</p>
<p>but those are, you know,</p>
<p>those communities are not very dense</p>
<p>and actually not very well studied.</p>
<p>We know of a very, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very famous stomach bacteria</p>
<p>known as Helicobacter pylori,</p>
<p>which can cause stomach ulcers and cause gastric cancer</p>
<p>in some, you know, less frequent situations.</p>
<p>But, you know, this is a very different,</p>
<p>different set of microbes.</p>
<p>They have to be adapted to a different environment</p>
<p>in the stomach, especially incredibly acidic environment,</p>
<p>but also very different in terms of their ability</p>
<p>to interact with other microbes,</p>
<p>just because the communities are less dense,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re less dynamic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less nutrients that stay there</p>
<p>and passage through the community.</p>
<p>So a lot of times those communities</p>
<p>are reliant upon nutrients derived from the host,</p>
<p>as opposed to nutrients derived from our diet.</p>
<p>As you move down out of the stomach</p>
<p>into the small intestine,</p>
<p>you start to see these communities,</p>
<p>which are the ones that are becoming more well-studied.</p>
<p>Small intestine is still a bit of a black box</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s hard to access.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some really cool technologies out there</p>
<p>for using, for instance, capsules to do sampling</p>
<p>as the capsule passes through the digestive tract</p>
<p>so that we have a better idea of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in the small intestine.</p>
<p>And then you get to the colon,</p>
<p>and this is the community that&rsquo;s just so incredibly,</p>
<p>you know, densely packed, doing a ton of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ton of metabolic activity happening there</p>
<p>and a bunch of interaction with the host.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the study,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the community that&rsquo;s really the best studied.</p>
<p>And part of the reason for that is because stool</p>
<p>is so easy to obtain compared to, for instance,</p>
<p>something in the stomach or small intestine,</p>
<p>and that stool is fairly representative.</p>
<p>We know from studies that have been done</p>
<p>using colonoscopies and so forth,</p>
<p>stool is fairly representative</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening in the colon.</p>
<p>So dense, super exciting community,</p>
<p>but also the best studied just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the easiest to access in the lower digestive tract.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Now, I imagine these microbiota have to get in there</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>Are microbiota seen in newborns?</p>
<p>In other words, where do they come from?</p>
<p>And dare I ask, what direction do they enter the body?</p>
<p>Or is it from multiple directions?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, great question.</p>
<p>So, you know, one of the burning questions</p>
<p>that we can come back to at the end of this</p>
<p>is where does our microbiota come from?</p>
<p>Because it is this kind of, you know,</p>
<p>existential question in the field,</p>
<p>like where is this community assembling from?</p>
<p>And the reason that it&rsquo;s such an interesting question</p>
<p>is that, you know, a fetus when it&rsquo;s in the womb,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a sterile environment.</p>
<p>There have been some studies that have looked at</p>
<p>whether there are microbes in the womb</p>
<p>and microbes colonizing the fetus at that point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some debate about this,</p>
<p>but overall it looks like that&rsquo;s not a big part</p>
<p>of the equation of microbial colonization.</p>
<p>And so each time an infant is born,</p>
<p>this new ecosystem, it&rsquo;s like an island</p>
<p>rising up out of the ocean that has no species on it.</p>
<p>And suddenly there&rsquo;s this like land rush</p>
<p>for, you know, this open territory.</p>
<p>And so the, you know, we know that infants</p>
<p>go through this really complex process</p>
<p>of microbiota assembly over the first days,</p>
<p>weeks, months, years of life.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you get into switching to solid food,</p>
<p>two to three years of age.</p>
<p>There are some changes in childhood,</p>
<p>adolescence, working into adulthood,</p>
<p>but that first, you know, zero to one year</p>
<p>is a super dynamic time with really kind of stereotypical</p>
<p>developmental changes in the gut microbiota</p>
<p>that appear to have the possibility of going wrong</p>
<p>and causing problems for infants in some instances.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you step away from that extreme side</p>
<p>of things going wrong, there also are a lot</p>
<p>of different trajectories that developmental process</p>
<p>can take because our microbiota is so malleable</p>
<p>and so plastic, and those trajectories can be affected</p>
<p>by all sorts of factors in early life.</p>
<p>So an example is whether an infant is born by C-section</p>
<p>or born vaginally.</p>
<p>We know from beautiful work that&rsquo;s been done in the field</p>
<p>that infants that are born by C-section</p>
<p>actually have a gut microbiota that looks more</p>
<p>like human skin than it does like either the birth canal,</p>
<p>the vagina microbiota, or the mother&rsquo;s stool microbiota.</p>
<p>Babies that are born through the birth canal</p>
<p>have initial colonization of vaginal microbes</p>
<p>and of stool microbes from their mother.</p>
<p>And so just these first days, whether you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>by C-section or through natural childbirth,</p>
<p>your gut microbiota looks very different.</p>
<p>And then compound on top of that, whether you&rsquo;re breastfed</p>
<p>or formula fed, whether your family has a pet</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t have a pet, whether you&rsquo;re exposed</p>
<p>to antibiotics, there are all these factors</p>
<p>that really can change that developmental process</p>
<p>and really change your microbial identity</p>
<p>eventually in life.</p>
<p>The reason that the field is paying really close attention</p>
<p>to this and studying this right now is because we know</p>
<p>from animal studies that depending upon the microbes</p>
<p>that you get early in life, you can send the immune system</p>
<p>or metabolism of an organism or other parts</p>
<p>of their biology in totally different</p>
<p>developmental trajectories.</p>
<p>So what microbes you&rsquo;re colonized with early in life</p>
<p>can really change your biology.</p>
<p>And we can come back to that later.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should.</p>
<p>Getting back to that original question</p>
<p>of where your microbes come from,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d think because you&rsquo;re born through your mother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>birth canal or exposed to her skin microbes</p>
<p>that a lot of your microbes would come from your mother.</p>
<p>But it actually turns out that we can certainly detect</p>
<p>that signal.</p>
<p>We certainly see maternal microbes in the infant,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of microbes that are coming</p>
<p>from other places, surfaces, other people,</p>
<p>perhaps other caregivers, but perhaps strangers as well.</p>
<p>So we acquire our microbes from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>The first ones are from our mom or from our caregivers</p>
<p>from the hospital, but then we add to that tremendously</p>
<p>over the first year or so of life.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>You even said pets.</p>
<p>So if a kid, if there&rsquo;s a dog in the home</p>
<p>or a parakeet in the home,</p>
<p>that clearly they have a microbiome also</p>
<p>and potentially the child is deriving microbiota species</p>
<p>from those pets, correct?</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>And so the best studies that have been done</p>
<p>have just looked at pets in the household as a factor</p>
<p>and whether that changes the group of infants</p>
<p>that have a pet to look slightly different</p>
<p>than the group of infants that don&rsquo;t have a pet.</p>
<p>And then the question is what is the pet doing</p>
<p>to change those microbes?</p>
<p>And some of it is probably actually contributing</p>
<p>direct members of the microbiota.</p>
<p>Actually, I have a dog,</p>
<p>that dog occasionally will lick my mouth</p>
<p>without me like paying attention,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably introducing microbes.</p>
<p>We also know that pets are down in the dirt,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re outside, they&rsquo;re being exposed</p>
<p>to a lot of environmental microbes.</p>
<p>And so just pets serving as a conduit</p>
<p>for a bunch of microbes</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise come in contact with</p>
<p>is a possibility as well.</p>
<p>We will return to pets and in particular, your dog,</p>
<p>an amazing dog, by the way,</p>
<p>I met your dog just the other day</p>
<p>and I had to force myself,</p>
<p>I had to pry myself away from, it&rsquo;s a Havanese, right?</p>
<p>Havanese.</p>
<p>Incredible, what was your dog&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>Louis, Louis Pasteur.</p>
<p>Louis Pasteur, I don&rsquo;t know how appropriate.</p>
<p>Amazing dog, what a personality on that dog.</p>
<p>The issue that I think a lot of people</p>
<p>are probably wondering is what is a healthy microbiome?</p>
<p>What is it supporting?</p>
<p>We hear that you need a healthy microbiome</p>
<p>to support the immune system or metabolism</p>
<p>or even the gut brain access.</p>
<p>How do we define a healthy versus a unhealthy microbiome?</p>
<p>Some people might know the unhealthy microbiome</p>
<p>as dysbiosis is the word that I encounter in the literature.</p>
<p>But given that there&rsquo;s so many species of microbiota</p>
<p>and given that I think we probably each have</p>
<p>a signature pattern of microbiota,</p>
<p>how do we define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota?</p>
<p>Is there a test for this?</p>
<p>Later we&rsquo;ll talk about technologies for testing microbiota.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies now,</p>
<p>a lot of people sending stool samples in the mail.</p>
<p>Never look at the postal service the same way again,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s out there and it&rsquo;s getting analyzed.</p>
<p>So how should I think about this?</p>
<p>I can think about things like heart rate,</p>
<p>heart rate variability, BMI, all sorts of metrics of health.</p>
<p>How should I think about the microbiota?</p>
<p>How do I know if my microbiome is healthy or unhealthy?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a million dollar question right now in the field</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of different ways of thinking about that.</p>
<p>And I can talk about some of those,</p>
<p>but I would say that there are sessions at conferences,</p>
<p>there are review articles being commissioned,</p>
<p>there are all sorts of kind of thought pieces</p>
<p>about this right now, like what is a healthy microbiota?</p>
<p>What are the features that define it?</p>
<p>And I think before diving into this,</p>
<p>the important thing to realize is it&rsquo;s a complex topic.</p>
<p>Context matters a lot.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s healthy for one person or one population</p>
<p>may not be healthy for another person or population.</p>
<p>And the microbiota is malleable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plastic, it changes our human biology,</p>
<p>which I think is how we think about health quite often,</p>
<p>BMI and longevity, reproductive success,</p>
<p>however you want to define it.</p>
<p>It certainly can accommodate a variety of configurations</p>
<p>of gut microbiota and we don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to untangle all of the different factors</p>
<p>of what could be very healthy</p>
<p>versus a little bit less healthy.</p>
<p>So I will say that there&rsquo;s no single answer to this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some really important considerations.</p>
<p>And perhaps the best way to start talking about this</p>
<p>is to go back to the inception</p>
<p>of the Human Microbiome Project,</p>
<p>which was this program that NIH started.</p>
<p>They invested a lot of money in 2008, 2009</p>
<p>for really propelling the field of gut microbiome research.</p>
<p>It was becoming evident at that point</p>
<p>that this was not just a curiosity of human biology,</p>
<p>that it was probably really important for our health.</p>
<p>And they had all this wonderful sequencing technology</p>
<p>from the Human Genome Sequencing Project.</p>
<p>And with the human genome complete at that point,</p>
<p>they started turning that technology</p>
<p>to sequencing our gut microbes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to contextualize</p>
<p>the amount of information that they&rsquo;re trying to document.</p>
<p>The collective genome of our gut microbes</p>
<p>is on the order of 100 to 500 times larger</p>
<p>than our human genome.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just in terms of the number of genes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just this vast number of genes.</p>
<p>And then if you start getting into</p>
<p>some of the fine variation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scales by 10 to 100 fold.</p>
<p>So really a huge amount of information</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to document.</p>
<p>And so it was a wonderful investment</p>
<p>and it continues to pay dividends to this day.</p>
<p>But one of their goals of that project</p>
<p>was to try to define what a healthy microbiome is</p>
<p>versus a diseased microbiome in different contexts.</p>
<p>And so they started enrolling a bunch of healthy people</p>
<p>and a bunch of people with, for instance,</p>
<p>inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases.</p>
<p>And the idea was let&rsquo;s document those microbiomes,</p>
<p>what microbes are there, what genes are there.</p>
<p>And then we can start to get a sense</p>
<p>of what are the commonalities of the healthy people</p>
<p>and how can that go wrong</p>
<p>in these different disease states?</p>
<p>And there were some answers from that,</p>
<p>but through those studies,</p>
<p>we really started to get the image</p>
<p>that there is this tremendous individuality</p>
<p>in the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really hard to start drawing conclusions</p>
<p>after initial pass of that project</p>
<p>of what is a healthy microbiome.</p>
<p>But the other thing that we started to realize</p>
<p>at the same time, there were studies going on</p>
<p>documenting the gut microbiome of traditional populations</p>
<p>of humans, hunter-gatherers,</p>
<p>rural agricultural populations.</p>
<p>And those studies were really mind-blowing</p>
<p>from the perspective of all these people are healthy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re living very different lifestyles,</p>
<p>and their microbiome doesn&rsquo;t look anything</p>
<p>like a healthy American microbiome.</p>
<p>So does that mean that the healthy American microbiome</p>
<p>is healthy, but only in the context</p>
<p>of living in the United States</p>
<p>and consuming what&rsquo;s consumed here?</p>
<p>Or is it that there is a superior microbiome signature</p>
<p>somewhere in our history or currently in the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s kind of a big question right now.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a great quote from Dubchansky</p>
<p>that says, nothing in biology makes sense</p>
<p>except in the light of evolution.</p>
<p>And these traditional populations</p>
<p>are all modern people living on the planet now,</p>
<p>but their lifestyle does represent</p>
<p>the closest approximation to how our ancestors,</p>
<p>early humans lived.</p>
<p>And so those microbiomes,</p>
<p>and now we know from sequencing of paleo feces,</p>
<p>the microbiome of these traditional populations</p>
<p>is more representative of the microbiome</p>
<p>that we evolved with,</p>
<p>that potentially shaped our human genome.</p>
<p>And so one possibility is that in the industrialized world,</p>
<p>we have a different microbiome from traditional populations,</p>
<p>and that microbiome is well-adapted to our current lifestyle</p>
<p>and therefore healthy</p>
<p>in the context of an industrialized society.</p>
<p>And there probably are elements of that that are true.</p>
<p>But another possibility is that this is a microbiome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gone off the rails,</p>
<p>that it is deteriorating in the face of antibiotic use</p>
<p>and all the problems associated with industrialized diet,</p>
<p>Western diet.</p>
<p>And that even though the Human Microbiome Project</p>
<p>documented the microbiome of healthy people,</p>
<p>healthy Americans,</p>
<p>that what they really may have been documenting there</p>
<p>is a perturbed microbiota</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really predisposing people</p>
<p>to a variety of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the, as a neurobiologist,</p>
<p>was weaned in the landscape of so-called critical periods</p>
<p>where early life environment very strongly shapes the brain.</p>
<p>And so many studies were done on animals</p>
<p>raised in traditional cages</p>
<p>with a water bottle and some food,</p>
<p>maybe a few other animals of the same species.</p>
<p>And then people came along and said,</p>
<p>wait, normally these species in the wild</p>
<p>would have things like things to climb over</p>
<p>and things to go through.</p>
<p>And you provide those very basic elements</p>
<p>and all of a sudden the architecture of neural circuits</p>
<p>looks very different.</p>
<p>And you realize that you were studying a deprived condition.</p>
<p>And earlier you actually referred to,</p>
<p>if I understood correctly,</p>
<p>to critical periods for gut microbiome development.</p>
<p>Is it fair to say that there are critical periods?</p>
<p>Meaning if my, let&rsquo;s say my, let&rsquo;s aim it at me.</p>
<p>If my gut microbiome was dysbiotic,</p>
<p>it was off early in life,</p>
<p>can I rescue that through proper conditions and exercise?</p>
<p>Or is there some sort of fixed pattern</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be hard for me to escape from?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a big field that&rsquo;s emerging now</p>
<p>that we refer to as kind of reprogramming</p>
<p>the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>I think if we wanna conceptualize humans</p>
<p>as this aggregate human microbial biology,</p>
<p>most people have heard of CRISPR</p>
<p>and the ability to potentially change our human genome</p>
<p>in ways that correct genetic problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a wonderful technology</p>
<p>and has kind of put on the table</p>
<p>genetic engineering for curing disease.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s much easier to change gut microbes for a problem</p>
<p>just because that community is malleable.</p>
<p>The issue that I think we&rsquo;re seeing in the field</p>
<p>is that microbiomes quite often,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re diseased or healthy,</p>
<p>exist in stable states.</p>
<p>They kind of tend towards this well that has gravity to it,</p>
<p>in a way, biological gravity,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s really hard to dislodge that community</p>
<p>from that state.</p>
<p>So even individuals, for instance,</p>
<p>that get antibiotics,</p>
<p>you take oral antibiotics,</p>
<p>the community takes this huge hit.</p>
<p>We know that a bunch of microbes die,</p>
<p>the composition changes,</p>
<p>and that represents a period of vulnerability</p>
<p>where pathogens can come in and take over and cause disease.</p>
<p>But if that doesn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>the microbiota kind of works its way back</p>
<p>to something that is not exactly like,</p>
<p>but similar to the pre-antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p>We know with dietary perturbations,</p>
<p>quite often you&rsquo;ll see a really rapid change</p>
<p>to the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s almost like a memory</p>
<p>where it snaps back to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very similar to the original state,</p>
<p>even though the diet remains different.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this incredible,</p>
<p>what we refer to as resilience of the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and resistance to change,</p>
<p>or at least resistance to establishing a new stable state.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s hopeless</p>
<p>to change an unhealthy microbiome to a healthy microbiome,</p>
<p>but it does mean that we need to think carefully</p>
<p>about restructuring these communities</p>
<p>in ways where we can achieve a new stable state</p>
<p>that will resist the microbial community</p>
<p>getting pulled back to that original state.</p>
<p>And one of the really kind of simplest</p>
<p>and nicest examples of this is an experiment</p>
<p>that we performed with mice,</p>
<p>where we were feeding mice a normal mouse diet,</p>
<p>a lot of nutrients there for the gut microbiota,</p>
<p>things like dietary fiber.</p>
<p>And we switched those mice,</p>
<p>half the mice to a low-fiber diet.</p>
<p>And we were basically asking the question that,</p>
<p>if you switch to kind of a Western-like diet,</p>
<p>a low-fiber, higher-fat diet,</p>
<p>what happens to the gut microbiota?</p>
<p>And we saw the microbiota change.</p>
<p>It lost diversity.</p>
<p>It was very similar to what we see</p>
<p>in the difference between industrialized</p>
<p>and traditional populations.</p>
<p>But when we brought back a healthy diet,</p>
<p>a lot of the microbes returned.</p>
<p>It was fairly, there was this kind of memory</p>
<p>where it went back to very similar to its original state.</p>
<p>The difference is that when we put the mice</p>
<p>on a low-fiber, high-fat diet,</p>
<p>and then kept them on that for multiple generations,</p>
<p>we saw this progressive deterioration</p>
<p>over the course of generations,</p>
<p>whereby the fourth generation,</p>
<p>the gut microbiome was a fraction</p>
<p>of what it originally was.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say 30% of the species only remained,</p>
<p>something like 70% of the species had gone extinct,</p>
<p>or appeared to have gone extinct.</p>
<p>We then put those mice back onto a high-fiber diet,</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t see recovery.</p>
<p>So in that case, it&rsquo;s a situation</p>
<p>where a new stable state has been achieved.</p>
<p>In that case, it&rsquo;s probably because those mice</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually have access to the microbes they&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>And we actually know that we did the control experiment</p>
<p>of mice on a high-fiber diet for four generations.</p>
<p>They maintain all their microbes.</p>
<p>If we take those fourth-generation mice</p>
<p>with all the diversity and do a fecal transplant</p>
<p>into the mice that had lost their microbes,</p>
<p>but had been returned to a high-fiber diet,</p>
<p>all of the diversity was reconstituted.</p>
<p>So it was, you know, so your question of like,</p>
<p>how do we establish new stable states?</p>
<p>How do we get back to a healthy microbiota</p>
<p>if we have taken a lot of antibiotics</p>
<p>or have a deteriorated microbiota?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a combination</p>
<p>of having access to the right microbes.</p>
<p>And we can talk about what that access looks like.</p>
<p>It may look like therapeutics in the future.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies working</p>
<p>on creating cocktails of healthy microbes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll be a combination of access to the right microbes</p>
<p>and nourishing those microbes with the proper diet.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>This multi-generational study reminds me</p>
<p>of something that I was told early in my training,</p>
<p>which was that it takes a long time for a trait to evolve,</p>
<p>but not a long time for traits to devolve.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Which generally is true of human behavior too,</p>
<p>although it depends.</p>
<p>We can all do better nonetheless.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>So I have a puzzle or a bit of a conundrum</p>
<p>around this notion of species of microbiota.</p>
<p>So if the pH, if the acidity differs</p>
<p>along the digestive tract,</p>
<p>but is more or less fixed for a given location, right?</p>
<p>I mean, unless something&rsquo;s really off,</p>
<p>the pH of the stomach is within a particular range</p>
<p>and the intestine and so forth.</p>
<p>And certain microbiota thrive at a given station,</p>
<p>a given location along the digestive tract.</p>
<p>And the pH is sort of fixed more or less.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out what is allowing</p>
<p>certain microbiota to stay in a given location.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they migrate up or down?</p>
<p>So are they pH sensitive?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re selecting for along the tract.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also trying to figure out</p>
<p>how these changes in food</p>
<p>so robustly change the microbiome.</p>
<p>The way you describe it almost makes it sound like</p>
<p>food is the variable that&rsquo;s going to dictate</p>
<p>the quality of the microbiome.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m sure there are other factors as well.</p>
<p>And then in the back of my mind,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I want to ask this question,</p>
<p>but I really want to ask this question,</p>
<p>which is where are they in there exactly?</p>
<p>And why don&rsquo;t they all get flushed out, right?</p>
<p>If 30% of fecal matter is microbiota,</p>
<p>then where are they living?</p>
<p>Are they along the lining</p>
<p>and the little microvilli of the intestine?</p>
<p>And what are they attaching to and interacting with?</p>
<p>We know there are neurons in there,</p>
<p>especially within the stomach.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work now being done on the gut neurons</p>
<p>and how they signal to the brain and so forth.</p>
<p>But who are they talking to in terms of the host cells?</p>
<p>Because if it&rsquo;s just from food,</p>
<p>I imagine that they&rsquo;re in there</p>
<p>having their good time or not.</p>
<p>And then some are getting flushed out or not,</p>
<p>but how do they actually stay in there?</p>
<p>Who are they attaching to?</p>
<p>What are they talking about?</p>
<p>What are they doing for fun and so forth?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, super, super interesting.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll come back to the attachment question</p>
<p>and kind of like why they don&rsquo;t get washed out,</p>
<p>because this is a super fascinating question.</p>
<p>And I think your initial point</p>
<p>of the kind of regional differences</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s happening in terms of physiology,</p>
<p>biochemistry along the length of the gut</p>
<p>is really interesting.</p>
<p>There certainly is a pH gradient</p>
<p>along the length of the gut.</p>
<p>There is actually bicarbonate that&rsquo;s secreted</p>
<p>into the small intestine to try to neutralize stomach acid.</p>
<p>There also is bile that&rsquo;s secreted.</p>
<p>That creates a different chemical environment</p>
<p>and there are bile-loving bacteria</p>
<p>that kind of live in that region of the gut.</p>
<p>And then there is a nutrient gradient</p>
<p>just because as food leaves the stomach,</p>
<p>a lot of the simple nutrients are absorbed.</p>
<p>And so you might see microbes in the small intestine,</p>
<p>for instance, that are better at consuming simple sugars,</p>
<p>but you won&rsquo;t find many microbes in the colon like that</p>
<p>because all the simple sugars</p>
<p>have been depleted at that point.</p>
<p>And then the immune system is a big factor as well.</p>
<p>And the immune system is incredibly active</p>
<p>in the small intestine.</p>
<p>The small intestine is this really interesting challenge</p>
<p>for the host because it&rsquo;s a tissue that&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>its purpose is mainly absorptive.</p>
<p>And so there has to be flow of a lot of things,</p>
<p>a lot of nutrients from the luminal contents</p>
<p>into host cells.</p>
<p>And so that means the barrier can&rsquo;t be as fortified.</p>
<p>And so the immune system is incredibly active</p>
<p>in the small intestine to make sure</p>
<p>that the microbes aren&rsquo;t getting so close.</p>
<p>And if they are getting close,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a response to them to put them back</p>
<p>in their right location.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, and then along this whole kind of architecture</p>
<p>of the gut, there&rsquo;s the longitudinal gradients,</p>
<p>things like pH and so forth.</p>
<p>And I should say that pH starts to drop again in the colon</p>
<p>because a lot of those microbes are fermenting things</p>
<p>and producing acids.</p>
<p>And so you actually end up with the pH starting to drop,</p>
<p>not as low as the stomach, but starting to drop again</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a lot of fermentation happening in the colon.</p>
<p>In addition, you also have a gradient</p>
<p>from the host surface epithelium</p>
<p>out to the middle of the gut.</p>
<p>And that is likely the key for what is retained in the gut</p>
<p>and how the community isn&rsquo;t washed out.</p>
<p>So lining the gut, we have epithelial cells</p>
<p>in the small intestine, they&rsquo;re largely absorptive.</p>
<p>In the colon, there&rsquo;s a lot of mucus production.</p>
<p>And we also see this in the small intestine</p>
<p>and this mucus lining is this substance that we secrete,</p>
<p>largely made of carbohydrate actually.</p>
<p>And the purpose of that is to keep microbes</p>
<p>in the right spot and to allow nutrients and water</p>
<p>to be absorbed in the small intestine and large intestine.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this mesh work that is supposed</p>
<p>to keep out large things like bacteria</p>
<p>and let in small things like nutrients.</p>
<p>That mucus layer, it turns over more slowly</p>
<p>than the luminal contents passing by.</p>
<p>And so if a microbe learns to hold onto that mucus layer,</p>
<p>it can actually resist the flow of the contents of the gut.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s many microbes in the gut</p>
<p>that are not just good at attaching to mucus,</p>
<p>but also good at nibbling on it, at eating it.</p>
<p>And there are these bacteria like Acromanzia mucinifola,</p>
<p>mucus loving, one of its main things it does</p>
<p>is actually eat mucus in the gut, that&rsquo;s its lifestyle.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s an incredible gradient of activity</p>
<p>from the host tissue working your way</p>
<p>out to the middle of the gut.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s amazing is some microbes</p>
<p>actually do penetrate past the mucus</p>
<p>and there are these invaginations in the intestine</p>
<p>known as crypts, actually where the stem cells live</p>
<p>that produce the epithelium.</p>
<p>And there are microbial communities</p>
<p>that can form in those crypts.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know completely what their function is,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve done some studies that appear to indicate</p>
<p>that if you can localize to a crypt,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve hit the jackpot as a microbe</p>
<p>for being able to maintain dominance in the gut.</p>
<p>So if you sit in the crypt and something similar to you,</p>
<p>another microbe that&rsquo;s similar to you comes into the gut,</p>
<p>you can actually exclude that microbe.</p>
<p>And the thinking is that it can&rsquo;t find a spot</p>
<p>to resist being washed out of the gut.</p>
<p>So there probably are these little niches</p>
<p>close to host tissue in the mucus</p>
<p>that are absolutely essential for resisting</p>
<p>getting washed out with the flow of all the contents.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>That raises a question about two things</p>
<p>that are reasonably popular.</p>
<p>One is this notion of cleanses from either direction.</p>
<p>People will consume things by mouth</p>
<p>to try and cleanse their digestive tract.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long history of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s differing opinions on whether or not</p>
<p>this is good or bad.</p>
<p>And the other is fasting or time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>The reason I ask about time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>is my understanding is that</p>
<p>after a prolonged period of fasting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some auto-absorption</p>
<p>or digestion of one&rsquo;s own digestive tract</p>
<p>that then gets renewed.</p>
<p>In other words, your intestine and stomach</p>
<p>start eating its own lining to some extent</p>
<p>in the absence of food.</p>
<p>So what do we know about cleanses?</p>
<p>Oh, and then I suppose there&rsquo;s cleanses</p>
<p>from the other direction too, right?</p>
<p>Which are less popular, but I&rsquo;ve never run the statistics,</p>
<p>but I certainly exist out there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea about cleanses and fasting</p>
<p>as it relates to the health</p>
<p>or the dysbiosis of the microbiota?</p>
<p>Yeah, there hasn&rsquo;t been a lot of high-quality science</p>
<p>in this area, and so it&rsquo;s really hard to conclude</p>
<p>whether these are good for health or bad for health.</p>
<p>I think the fasting,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a really interesting situation</p>
<p>in the industrialized world</p>
<p>because we have so many problems</p>
<p>associated with our digestive tract,</p>
<p>and that probably has to do with our highly processed diet</p>
<p>and perhaps having a microbiota</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fairly perturbed as well.</p>
<p>And so,</p>
<p>whether doing things like this are good or bad,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to define</p>
<p>because we may be starting off in a fairly bad state anyway.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many diseases that we&rsquo;re dealing with,</p>
<p>metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease,</p>
<p>that just put a massive portion of the population</p>
<p>in a very different category</p>
<p>than people that are thinking about,</p>
<p>how do I maintain health?</p>
<p>How do I live a long life?</p>
<p>From starting off in what we consider</p>
<p>a fairly healthy state.</p>
<p>And so, things like fasting</p>
<p>and a lot of other therapies</p>
<p>that have been developed in the field,</p>
<p>I think ketogenic diet</p>
<p>may be kind of in this category as well.</p>
<p>There can be tremendous benefits</p>
<p>in terms of their impact</p>
<p>in the context of metabolic syndrome</p>
<p>and for people that are battling</p>
<p>eating a continual bad diet or something like that.</p>
<p>And adherence.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons</p>
<p>for the popularity of intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>and sort of, what do they call them now?</p>
<p>Exclusion diets, where you entirely exclude meat</p>
<p>or you entirely exclude plants or whatever it is.</p>
<p>That adherence is sometimes easier in the all or none.</p>
<p>As neurobiologists, we think of this</p>
<p>as a go-no-go circuitry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to make decisions,</p>
<p>nuanced decisions often about food</p>
<p>than it is to just eliminate entire categories of food.</p>
<p>Not eating for many people</p>
<p>is easier than eating smaller portions.</p>
<p>So, some of it, I think,</p>
<p>is neurobiological and psychological.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and we&rsquo;ve had gastroenterology fellows</p>
<p>in our lab that come in</p>
<p>and we kind of,</p>
<p>I think that to kind of slice through the nuance</p>
<p>of all this, there&rsquo;s a very simple recipe</p>
<p>and a really well-accepted kind of broad definition</p>
<p>of what a healthy diet is.</p>
<p>Kind of the Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a ton of data that,</p>
<p>particularly people of European ancestry,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a pretty broad acceptance</p>
<p>that if you eat mostly plants,</p>
<p>for most people, that&rsquo;s gonna be very healthy,</p>
<p>to the point where a wonderful colleague of ours,</p>
<p>Christopher Gardner, who&rsquo;s studied diet his whole life,</p>
<p>trying to establish what a healthy diet is,</p>
<p>and people was giving advice.</p>
<p>I saw him giving advice to a dietician</p>
<p>who was trying to get all the rules</p>
<p>of what she should be recommending</p>
<p>to people that she deals with</p>
<p>that are interested in a healthy diet.</p>
<p>And she said, so, number one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say plant-based fiber is probably super important,</p>
<p>and that should be very high on the list.</p>
<p>She goes on to number two, and he said, stop.</p>
<p>He said, if people do number one well,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to know any other rules.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s basically like,</p>
<p>if you can have a high-fiber, plant-based diet,</p>
<p>for most people, at least, you know,</p>
<p>talking about the bucket of people</p>
<p>that are already in a healthy state,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really need to think about other things,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t eat too much meat,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t eat too many sweets,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already eaten a huge amount of plant-based fiber,</p>
<p>your gut is full, you&rsquo;re not gonna be hungry,</p>
<p>and it kind of takes care of worrying</p>
<p>about what should I eat or what shouldn&rsquo;t I eat,</p>
<p>just eat a ton of whole grains, legumes, vegetables,</p>
<p>fruit that&rsquo;s high-fiber-based, not high-sugar.</p>
<p>Does it completely exclude meat and fish and dairy?</p>
<p>And he was saying, like, you know,</p>
<p>people can add their own spins on this,</p>
<p>but I think that the main rule is just start off with,</p>
<p>you know, and it kind of gets back</p>
<p>to Michael Pollan&rsquo;s mantra, you know,</p>
<p>eat food, not too much, mostly plants.</p>
<p>You know, I think if you stick with kind of</p>
<p>these simple rules and don&rsquo;t overthink,</p>
<p>like, should I have this, you know, can I eat eggs,</p>
<p>can I eat, you know, just kind of stick</p>
<p>to these simple rules, it makes it very approachable.</p>
<p>But I agree, like, so these gastroenterology fellows</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had in our lab say that they,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard, we kind of say to them,</p>
<p>why won&rsquo;t you give this dietary advice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really well-known?</p>
<p>And they just said, well, it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to get people to change their diet</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing either a go-no-go sort of thing,</p>
<p>like, or eliminating something.</p>
<p>So, you know, if carrots are giving you problems,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat carrots.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very simple, easy instruction to follow,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t really deal with the root problem</p>
<p>of why can&rsquo;t you eat carrots?</p>
<p>Because you should be able to eat carrots.</p>
<p>Most people can eat carrots.</p>
<p>And so I think that, you know, there, we,</p>
<p>yeah, we, when we&rsquo;re thinking about things like fasting</p>
<p>and, you know, all these different dietary regimes</p>
<p>and cleanses that people do,</p>
<p>we have to step back for a moment and say,</p>
<p>okay, well, what are really the big high-level rules</p>
<p>that we should take home?</p>
<p>And then if you are experiencing problems</p>
<p>and you want to think about how to deal with them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to go to an evidence-based method</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s actually data to back it up.</p>
<p>The, you know, the data in the field</p>
<p>really shows that with like fasting,</p>
<p>particularly if you go to like animals that hibernate</p>
<p>or things like that, where there&rsquo;s really extended fast,</p>
<p>you actually have a microbiota come up</p>
<p>that blooms in the absence of food coming in through diet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really good at eating mucus.</p>
<p>So you have, you know, bacteria that specialize</p>
<p>in eating nutrients derived from the host</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no other nutrients to live on.</p>
<p>Now, whether this is good or bad, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it seems like the, you know,</p>
<p>consumption of mucus in excess is a problem</p>
<p>from the standpoint of microbes getting too close</p>
<p>to host tissue and inciting inflammation,</p>
<p>which is what we see in animal models</p>
<p>when we deprive of dietary fiber.</p>
<p>We see these mucus utilizers become abundant</p>
<p>and inflammatory markers start to come on.</p>
<p>So fasting short-term might be fine.</p>
<p>Probably, you know, there&rsquo;s definitely benefits</p>
<p>that are seen metabolically.</p>
<p>In terms of what it means for long-term health</p>
<p>from the standpoint of the gut microbiota,</p>
<p>I would say we don&rsquo;t have the answer to that yet.</p>
<p>In terms of the, you know, the cleanses and the flushes</p>
<p>and all this, personally, I think it&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that like if, you know,</p>
<p>in studies that are being done now</p>
<p>to reprogram the gut microbiota</p>
<p>to install a completely new microbial community,</p>
<p>the first step is to wash away</p>
<p>the resident microbial community that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in the process</p>
<p>of acquiring a really good microbiota</p>
<p>and you know how to do that,</p>
<p>then the flushing everything out is great.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what is happening is you&rsquo;re kind of leaving,</p>
<p>rebuilding of the community to chance.</p>
<p>Like, what is it?</p>
<p>And so, you know, what microbes are gonna colonize,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna take up space after you do this flush or cleanse</p>
<p>and, you know, that I think it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>like playing Russian roulette.</p>
<p>You may end up with a good microbial community</p>
<p>in there afterwards, you may not.</p>
<p>You certainly wanna pay close attention</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re doing the reconstitution of the community</p>
<p>after you do something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people are interested</p>
<p>in these kinds of elimination diets</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting slash time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>seems to be getting some traction in part</p>
<p>because at some level,</p>
<p>we are all doing this when we sleep.</p>
<p>Most of us aren&rsquo;t eating while we sleep anyway</p>
<p>and adjusting the numbers</p>
<p>seems more accessible for a lot of people.</p>
<p>We have a lot of colleagues at Stanford</p>
<p>who I know happen to follow that regimen</p>
<p>or a time-restricted feeding regimen,</p>
<p>but also some who follow the more traditional meal spacing</p>
<p>as well, of course.</p>
<p>The, one of the things that I wonder about</p>
<p>as we talk about primarily plant-based with some,</p>
<p>you know, what did you say the pollen thing was?</p>
<p>It was eat mostly plants and then maybe some meat,</p>
<p>but not too much or not too much.</p>
<p>Eat food, mostly plants, not too much.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Or sorry, eat food, not too much, mostly plants.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>You know, and in just, I hear this again and again,</p>
<p>I know there are a number of people</p>
<p>who do seem to do well on a lower carbohydrate,</p>
<p>you know, and even some people who report</p>
<p>feeling much better on a like really strictly</p>
<p>almost meat organ only diet.</p>
<p>And the only reason I raise this is not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t participate in it.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m one of those omnivores that out there,</p>
<p>I do eat some meat and I do eat plants as well.</p>
<p>But the reason I raise this is that earlier</p>
<p>you were talking about communities</p>
<p>that may have microbiota that are healthier than ours</p>
<p>or at least different than ours.</p>
<p>And there are communities in the world</p>
<p>that subsist largely on animal products</p>
<p>or for which unprocessed animal products</p>
<p>are considered the richest nutrient foods</p>
<p>in those communities.</p>
<p>Protein is very scarce and ancestrally</p>
<p>protein was more scarce.</p>
<p>So eggs and meat and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So could there be a genetic component?</p>
<p>In other words, if we fast forward 10 years</p>
<p>and we actually can make sense of all this</p>
<p>human genome stuff, are we gonna find that</p>
<p>someone who has Scandinavian roots</p>
<p>or somebody who has South American roots</p>
<p>or somebody who descended from a different tribe</p>
<p>will do better on one particular diet versus another</p>
<p>and thereby, or I should say,</p>
<p>and in parallel with that, that their gut microbiome</p>
<p>will have different signatures that are,</p>
<p>so your microbiome might thrive on plants</p>
<p>and mine might thrive on organ meats.</p>
<p>And as I say this, I&rsquo;m not a big consumer of organ meats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just laying this out for sake of example.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, great.</p>
<p>So a few notes.</p>
<p>The first one has to do with the carbohydrates</p>
<p>and restriction of carbohydrates</p>
<p>and some people feeling healthier</p>
<p>when they cut carbohydrates out.</p>
<p>My guess is, this is my theory to be tested,</p>
<p>that people feel better cutting carbohydrates out</p>
<p>because the diet that we eat in the United States</p>
<p>and in industrialized countries,</p>
<p>the carbohydrates are largely crap.</p>
<p>Processed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re processed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like starch, simple sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s things that contribute to glycemic index.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these sugars that we eat.</p>
<p>They make it to our small intestine.</p>
<p>They get chopped up into simple sugars,</p>
<p>absorbed into our bloodstream,</p>
<p>and we have a ton of glucose</p>
<p>then coursing through our veins,</p>
<p>which we know is bad and can lead to things like diabetes.</p>
<p>If the carbohydrates that were in our diet</p>
<p>were complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber,</p>
<p>and we like to refer to the subset of dietary fiber</p>
<p>that the microbiota can actually access</p>
<p>as microbiota-accessible carbohydrates,</p>
<p>and the reason that we like that term</p>
<p>is it has the word carbohydrate in it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s to point out that not all carbs are bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just there are bad carbs,</p>
<p>or carbs that are bad if you consume them</p>
<p>in too high a quantity,</p>
<p>things like table sugar and simple starches,</p>
<p>but there are good carbs as well,</p>
<p>and these microbiota-accessible carbohydrates</p>
<p>are the complex ones that we can&rsquo;t digest</p>
<p>and fuel our gut microbiota.</p>
<p>Our gut microbiota can ferment them,</p>
<p>and so I think we probably all would be better off</p>
<p>with less of the carbs that were typically served,</p>
<p>but most of us, and probably the vast majority of us,</p>
<p>would be better off by consuming a lot more carbs</p>
<p>that were complex, that were microbiota-accessible,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll come back to why that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>in terms of our biology.</p>
<p>There are some mechanisms that are known</p>
<p>as to why those complex carbohydrates</p>
<p>are so important for our health for most of us.</p>
<p>I think this aspect of human genetic adaptation to diet</p>
<p>is super interesting, and then layer on top of that</p>
<p>gut microbiota adaptation to diet,</p>
<p>which is another layer of this that is also fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that over very short periods of time,</p>
<p>humans can adapt to differences in their diet.</p>
<p>Lactase persistence is kind of the classic example of this.</p>
<p>Just over the past 10,000 years,</p>
<p>certain groups of humans have adapted</p>
<p>to being able to consume dairy</p>
<p>by taking this enzyme, lactase,</p>
<p>that normally is just expressed</p>
<p>in most of the world&rsquo;s population early in life</p>
<p>to be able to metabolize lactose in breast milk.</p>
<p>By extending the expression of that throughout life,</p>
<p>now you can consume milk for your whole life,</p>
<p>and so that is an example of specific populations</p>
<p>of human genome genetically adapting to diet</p>
<p>in a very short period of time,</p>
<p>and there are other examples of this,</p>
<p>and undoubtedly this has happened throughout the world</p>
<p>to various aspects of diet,</p>
<p>so certainly it&rsquo;s important to remember</p>
<p>that there will be different diets</p>
<p>that are better for different groups</p>
<p>based on what genes you harbor</p>
<p>and have in your human genome.</p>
<p>The other aspect on top of that</p>
<p>is that there are good examples</p>
<p>of the gut microbiome adapting</p>
<p>to cultural differences in diet,</p>
<p>and the classic example of this</p>
<p>is the degradation of seaweed.</p>
<p>So we know that most Americans,</p>
<p>if you eat sushi and there&rsquo;s nori there</p>
<p>and you eat some of this seaweed,</p>
<p>it has a dietary fiber in it known as porphyrin.</p>
<p>That porphyrin will shoot through most of us untransformed,</p>
<p>inert substance, it&rsquo;ll do other things like retain water</p>
<p>and serve as kind of something like cellulose,</p>
<p>not be fermented at a high level.</p>
<p>If somebody from Southeast Asia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always consumed seaweed</p>
<p>and is part of a culture that consumes seaweed eats seaweed,</p>
<p>they have a gut microbe that can now metabolize porphyrin,</p>
<p>and so there are these very specific gene transfer events</p>
<p>where the genes for breaking down porphyrin</p>
<p>have been imported into the microbiome</p>
<p>of many people in Southeast Asia to,</p>
<p>we can think of it as helping digest porphyrin,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really just a microbe that&rsquo;s found a niche,</p>
<p>found a way to make a living in the gut</p>
<p>by consuming something that&rsquo;s common in the diet there.</p>
<p>So there are these different layers.</p>
<p>There are human genetic adaptations</p>
<p>and there are microbiome adaptations that are cultural</p>
<p>and based on people&rsquo;s geographic location,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no escaping the fact</p>
<p>that for much of human evolution,</p>
<p>the vast majority of people that are on this planet</p>
<p>had ancestors that were hunter-gatherers,</p>
<p>foraging, consuming huge quantities of plant material</p>
<p>just because that&rsquo;s what was there.</p>
<p>And so one of the groups that we study,</p>
<p>the Hadza hunter-gatherers in Africa,</p>
<p>and I should take a moment just to say that</p>
<p>our research and research of many people in our field</p>
<p>and other fields rely on study of indigenous communities.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really important to think of these communities</p>
<p>as our equals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re modern people on the planet.</p>
<p>They have interesting lifestyles that are informative</p>
<p>with regard to certain aspects of human biology,</p>
<p>but in many cases, they also are</p>
<p>leading vulnerable existence.</p>
<p>And so we really take great care in our research program</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important for people to realize that</p>
<p>these populations take partner research</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re wonderful research partners</p>
<p>and we need to be mindful of kind of thinking about how,</p>
<p>yeah, both we talk about them and use our data</p>
<p>that has been gained through their generous contribution</p>
<p>to our research program.</p>
<p>The Hadza hunter-gatherers, it&rsquo;s estimated,</p>
<p>consume on the order of 100 to 150 grams</p>
<p>of dietary fiber per day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in stark contrast to the typical American</p>
<p>that consumes about 15 grams.</p>
<p>So somewhere seven to tenfold decrease</p>
<p>in the main nutrient that feeds our gut microbiome</p>
<p>in the American diet.</p>
<p>The Hadza are, you know, one example.</p>
<p>There are many different foraging populations,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of these populations</p>
<p>consume huge amounts of dietary fiber</p>
<p>because plants are the reliable, consistent source.</p>
<p>You know, if you, as a hunter-gatherer, go on a hunt,</p>
<p>usually that hunt is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>You know, I think the data are that, you know,</p>
<p>one out of 20 to 30 hunts are successful</p>
<p>in landing actually big game for the Hadza.</p>
<p>They have, you know, birds that they shoot</p>
<p>and small animals, but quite often, day after day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re relying upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re relying on the plants</p>
<p>in their environment.</p>
<p>And actually, if you go to the data</p>
<p>and look at what their food preferences are,</p>
<p>their food preferences are actually meat and honey.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t eat a high-fiber diet</p>
<p>because they love fiber.</p>
<p>They eat a high-fiber diet</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s available and consistent</p>
<p>for them to survive.</p>
<p>But, you know, our brains are wired for caloric density.</p>
<p>And so if you took a Hadza and put them in a restaurant</p>
<p>in the United States,</p>
<p>they would make the same crappy decisions</p>
<p>that we make because we, you know,</p>
<p>all want sugar and fat and calories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how our brain is wired.</p>
<p>And protein and fat are essential for brain development</p>
<p>as far as we know, right?</p>
<p>So it sounds like the Hadza,</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m pronouncing that correctly,</p>
<p>you said would prefer to eat meat and honey,</p>
<p>but they happen to consume a lot of plant fiber</p>
<p>as a consequence of what&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>One of the questions I have as it relates to all of this,</p>
<p>is it sounds to me like there is no question</p>
<p>from the pure vegan all the way to the extreme opposite,</p>
<p>which would be pure meat diet,</p>
<p>that avoiding processed foods is a good idea.</p>
<p>More heavily processed foods in general.</p>
<p>And I mean, not that, you know,</p>
<p>the occasional consumption is necessarily bad,</p>
<p>but whether or not one is thinking</p>
<p>about one macronutrient profile or another,</p>
<p>it sounds like consuming processed foods</p>
<p>is just bad for the microbiome.</p>
<p>Can we say that categorically?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re low carb person, you&rsquo;re zero carb person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re extreme vegan, no meat,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re all meat, organ meat,</p>
<p>it sounds to me as if the number one thing,</p>
<p>maybe even dare I say above Chris&rsquo;s point about plants,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m not gonna challenge Chris Gardner on nutrition,</p>
<p>I would be way outside the lane lines to do that.</p>
<p>What is it to avoiding processed foods is paramount.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that&rsquo;s completely compatible</p>
<p>with what Christopher was saying.</p>
<p>He was saying, if you prioritize getting a huge amount</p>
<p>of whole plant-based food with a lot of fiber first,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have room for eating a lot of processed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of the same as avoiding processed food.</p>
<p>So I think that those are exactly the same rule.</p>
<p>And I think that you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>And we can break down, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of data of why different components</p>
<p>of processed food are so bad for us</p>
<p>and so bad for our microbiome.</p>
<p>And I can talk about a few examples of that.</p>
<p>But the flip side of this is this mechanism of,</p>
<p>you know, and again, thinking about the spectrum</p>
<p>of a plant-based diet versus a meat-based diet,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of data to tell us</p>
<p>that a meat or ketogenic or high-fat diet</p>
<p>may have big benefits in terms of short-term metabolic health.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s typically how people think about that diet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of heart disease</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s linked with that as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good literature for that,</p>
<p>which is something for people to look at and be aware of.</p>
<p>The plant-based diet, if you&rsquo;re eating a bunch</p>
<p>of complex, you know, fibers that feed your gut microbiota,</p>
<p>your gut microbiota produces these substances</p>
<p>called short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s known that these short-chain fatty acids</p>
<p>play really essential components,</p>
<p>both in terms of fueling colonocytes,</p>
<p>enforcing the barrier, keeping inflammation low,</p>
<p>regulating the immune system, regulating metabolism.</p>
<p>And so, you know, a lot of people think of dietary fiber</p>
<p>as this inert substance that passes through,</p>
<p>makes us feel full maybe for a little bit,</p>
<p>but we get hungry afterwards right away.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating a lot of fiber</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s feeding your gut microbiota,</p>
<p>your gut microbiota is just producing this vast array</p>
<p>of fermentation end products</p>
<p>that then get absorbed into our bloodstream</p>
<p>and have all of these tremendous cascading effects</p>
<p>that appear to be largely beneficial on our biology.</p>
<p>And so to think about that paradigm</p>
<p>of simple carbs versus complex carbs,</p>
<p>in the case of simple carbs,</p>
<p>you end up with high blood sugar, you know,</p>
<p>something that will spike your insulin</p>
<p>and, you know, have all kinds of weird metabolic effects.</p>
<p>In the case of complex carbohydrates,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll end up with very low blood sugar</p>
<p>because most of those have low glycemic index</p>
<p>and a bunch of short-chain fatty acids</p>
<p>that are having regulatory roles.</p>
<p>So just to round out that topic,</p>
<p>I think there is a reason to think that, you know,</p>
<p>maybe not appropriate for absolutely everyone out there,</p>
<p>but I think the vast majority of people,</p>
<p>particularly given the statistics</p>
<p>of what we know people eat in the United States</p>
<p>and in industrialized countries,</p>
<p>most people would reap tremendous health benefits</p>
<p>from eating more whole plant-based dietary fiber.</p>
<p>Now, processed foods, I think, is this other dimension</p>
<p>where you have all of these weird chemicals,</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners, weird fats, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of refined, simple nutrients,</p>
<p>the simple nutrients we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>but we know that, for instance,</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners can have a massive negative impact</p>
<p>on the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and can lead us towards metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s been beautiful work</p>
<p>out of the Weizmann Institute on this.</p>
<p>And then emulsifiers,</p>
<p>these compounds that are put in processed foods</p>
<p>to help them maintain shelf stability</p>
<p>so things don&rsquo;t separate.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>all the moisture content is retained appropriately.</p>
<p>Many of these are known to disrupt the mucus layer.</p>
<p>And as soon as you start disrupting that barrier,</p>
<p>that can lead you in the direction of inflammation.</p>
<p>And in animal models,</p>
<p>we know that can lead towards metabolic syndrome as well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s components of processed food</p>
<p>that are, when studied in isolation,</p>
<p>known to have a direct negative impact</p>
<p>on gut biology and the microbiota.</p>
<p>The mention of artificial sweeteners is interesting.</p>
<p>I confess it&rsquo;s a third rail on social media,</p>
<p>talking about artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>There are two camps, it seems, or at least two camps.</p>
<p>One that say artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>are not detrimental at all.</p>
<p>Another that says they&rsquo;re very detrimental,</p>
<p>mainly based on the mouse studies.</p>
<p>And then there are people in the middle that are,</p>
<p>I put myself in that category.</p>
<p>I drink the occasional diet soda.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consume them in large volume,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sort of in the middle there.</p>
<p>However, and so I just throw that out there</p>
<p>because I know immediately people are jumping on that.</p>
<p>But I will just mention there&rsquo;s some recent data</p>
<p>out of Diego Borja&rsquo;s lab at Duke University</p>
<p>that the neurons that live in the gut mucosa,</p>
<p>these neuropod cells, can actually distinguish</p>
<p>between artificial and true sweet,</p>
<p>sugar versus artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>They send different patterns of neural signals</p>
<p>up to the brain,</p>
<p>and the brain circuitry seems strongly impacted.</p>
<p>So I think that as the data emerge,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re hearing more and more of these artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>Either are problematic,</p>
<p>or at least are signaling different events in the gut.</p>
<p>I do want to make sure that we distinguish</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>from non-caloric plant-based sweeteners.</p>
<p>And this is based on a mistake that I&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>over and over again on the podcast,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll just kind of lump artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>into one big category,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll mention Stevia.</p>
<p>So what about plant-based sweeteners</p>
<p>that are not artificial?</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t manufactured in a laboratory</p>
<p>like saccharin or sucralose or aspartame.</p>
<p>Do we know anything about plant-based</p>
<p>non-caloric sweeteners or low-caloric sweeteners?</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>A lot of those have a lot more bang for the buck.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re incredibly sweet,</p>
<p>so it takes a really small amount</p>
<p>for them to trigger a huge amount of sweetness.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s depending upon the mechanism of action</p>
<p>by which these sweeteners that are not sugar</p>
<p>are impacting our biology.</p>
<p>It may be that those are actually less negative</p>
<p>or more healthy than the ones that are artificial,</p>
<p>just because it requires less of them in the food</p>
<p>for us to perceive that sweet taste.</p>
<p>It may also be that because they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that everything that&rsquo;s natural</p>
<p>is better necessarily than things that are artificial,</p>
<p>but it may be that because of evolutionary exposure</p>
<p>to these compounds in our diet,</p>
<p>historically there are, I think,</p>
<p>traditional populations that use these,</p>
<p>for instance, to sweeten different foods,</p>
<p>that our bodies just kind of know</p>
<p>how to deal with those compounds better</p>
<p>than the ones that are synthetic.</p>
<p>But I think the studies still need to be done.</p>
<p>Do you actively avoid artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>sucralose, aspartame, saccharin, you personally?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I do.</p>
<p>I avoid them, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I work closely with my wife, Erica, as you know.</p>
<p>We run the lab together,</p>
<p>and we wrote this book, The Good Gut,</p>
<p>where we kind of document our journey</p>
<p>in changing our lifestyle, dietary habits,</p>
<p>choices we make based on the research</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve gotten to know it in the gut microbiota</p>
<p>over the past 15 years.</p>
<p>And I think that one of the lessons that we&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>is that just doing things in moderation</p>
<p>makes it a lot easier,</p>
<p>and doing things slowly makes it a lot easier.</p>
<p>And so there are very few rules that I have</p>
<p>that are hard and fast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty flexible eater.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that having an artificial,</p>
<p>having a Diet Coke will somehow cascade</p>
<p>into some terrible disease or something like that.</p>
<p>I try to avoid them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like the flavor of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super sensitive to the nuances of the flavor,</p>
<p>even with the stevia and mograsides</p>
<p>from monk fruit and stuff like that.</p>
<p>The off flavors are really hard for me to deal with.</p>
<p>But I also, in this journey of changing our diet,</p>
<p>when we started off in microbiome research,</p>
<p>I was in the habit of, in the afternoons,</p>
<p>having a sweet, a muffin or a cookie or something like that.</p>
<p>And when we started to realize</p>
<p>that we should be eating less sweets</p>
<p>and eating more dietary fiber,</p>
<p>this was an incredibly difficult change for me to make.</p>
<p>I was just wired to kind of crave this-</p>
<p>Classic scientist.</p>
<p>Scientists love the pastry in the afternoon and the coffee.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And in the old days, it used to be a cigarette too.</p>
<p>Right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>When I started my training, a lot of people still smoked.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And it was only during my postdoctoral training</p>
<p>that they eliminate smoking on campuses.</p>
<p>And productivity took a trough for a while</p>
<p>and until these people developed other tools</p>
<p>to focus their attention.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So there is this kind of like need.</p>
<p>And then once you have an ingrained behavior</p>
<p>and maybe things that are addictive,</p>
<p>it becomes incredibly difficult to break that habit.</p>
<p>And so I would say, gradually over the course of like,</p>
<p>five or more years, we have migrated our diet</p>
<p>away from sweet foods to things that are less sweet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a journey, it&rsquo;s been a slow process,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve gotten to the point now</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve just retrained our palates.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing how this happens now,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll have something that is something</p>
<p>that I would have used to have like daily</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unpalatable.</p>
<p>Like I just can&rsquo;t deal with the sweetness of it.</p>
<p>And so I avoid, I certainly avoid artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p>but I also avoid just sweet things in general</p>
<p>that have sugar in them, just because they now,</p>
<p>they, you know, as originally I was trying to be disciplined</p>
<p>and trying to change my diet,</p>
<p>but now they just don&rsquo;t taste good to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, likewise, I completely lost my appetite for sugar</p>
<p>at the turn of the last year</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it,</p>
<p>but the way I, even though I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a mechanistic explanation, I just, I say,</p>
<p>I like sweet people, I don&rsquo;t like sweet food anymore.</p>
<p>I have not lost my appetite for fatty foods.</p>
<p>I love cheese and certain meats for me.</p>
<p>I blame my Argentine lineage as I gravitate towards them.</p>
<p>But in any case, avoiding processed foods,</p>
<p>probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers,</p>
<p>these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And for people listening or watching,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not setting up strict guidelines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just bouncing around the carnival</p>
<p>that is the microbiome and nutrition,</p>
<p>because I think that these, we hear this everywhere,</p>
<p>eat this, don&rsquo;t eat that, or this is best for microbiome</p>
<p>or worse for microbiome,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hearing fiber again and again.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna come back to fiber,</p>
<p>but I wanna make sure that we close the hatch</p>
<p>on this issue of fasting and cleansing.</p>
<p>Based on your answer earlier, it sounds to me like</p>
<p>it is not necessary to do a cleanse or fast</p>
<p>prior to an attempt to repopulate the microbiome.</p>
<p>In other words, if I wanna make my microbiome healthier,</p>
<p>it sounds like I don&rsquo;t have to try</p>
<p>and flush all the current microbiota out of there first.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that those things</p>
<p>are known to be terrible,</p>
<p>or I would just say the studies haven&rsquo;t been done.</p>
<p>And to me, wiping out this microbial community,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s done in an informed way,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t really have the information</p>
<p>for how that would be done,</p>
<p>it just seems like playing the lottery a little bit.</p>
<p>And so I think, I don&rsquo;t wanna say that those are,</p>
<p>it may be that when the study is done,</p>
<p>those are shown to be amazing,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t think we have the data to know that yet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s somewhat of an arbitrary thing.</p>
<p>If somebody out there feels way better when they do this</p>
<p>and are not experiencing problems with it,</p>
<p>then maybe it&rsquo;s the right thing for them.</p>
<p>But I certainly can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s something great to do.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a future where as the microbiome</p>
<p>gets incorporated into this emerging paradigm</p>
<p>of precision health, you go into a clinic,</p>
<p>somebody types your microbiome and says,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s this huge, massive misconfiguration.</p>
<p>You have all these engrafted bacteria that live</p>
<p>that are residents in your gut microbiome</p>
<p>that are sending out molecules</p>
<p>that are not good for your health.</p>
<p>It would be good if we do a mass reprogramming of it.</p>
<p>The way that we do that is we flush your gut</p>
<p>and we actually give a light antibiotic treatment</p>
<p>to try to kill everything that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And then we repopulate with this other consortium</p>
<p>of microbes that we&rsquo;ve studied and know are healthy,</p>
<p>know are compatible with your human genome</p>
<p>and can be reinforced with a diet</p>
<p>that we know is good for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll install those microbes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll help you along in the diet</p>
<p>so you know how to nourish those microbes.</p>
<p>And that will be the way that we&rsquo;ll reconfigure</p>
<p>your gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t imagine a future where that sort of flushing</p>
<p>or cleansing is part of something for repopulating the gut.</p>
<p>But right now it seems a little half-baked to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk about fiber and fermented foods</p>
<p>because you and Chris had a really,</p>
<p>what I think is a really interesting and exciting paper</p>
<p>at the end of last year about comparing the inflammatome,</p>
<p>so inflammatory markers of people</p>
<p>who ate a certain amount of fiber</p>
<p>or a certain amount of these fermented foods.</p>
<p>This study is amazing for several reasons,</p>
<p>but almost as amazing is how diverse</p>
<p>the interpretation of this study was in the media.</p>
<p>If ever there was a study that was kind of hijacked</p>
<p>by different priority schemes out there, it&rsquo;s this study.</p>
<p>So you performed the study with Chris</p>
<p>and your postdocs and graduate students and staff.</p>
<p>What are the major conclusions and what sorts of directives,</p>
<p>if any, emerge from this study?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just preface this again by saying,</p>
<p>if I wasn&rsquo;t clear, some news reports said,</p>
<p>ah, this means fiber is not important.</p>
<p>And then others said,</p>
<p>this means fermented foods and fiber are important.</p>
<p>And others said, fermented foods are the thing</p>
<p>and the only thing.</p>
<p>It was all over the place.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons for doing this podcast at all</p>
<p>is so that we can go straight to the people</p>
<p>who perform the work.</p>
<p>And even though I&rsquo;m certainly not an expert in microbiome,</p>
<p>give you the opportunity to share with me</p>
<p>and me to ask the kinds of questions</p>
<p>that have zero agenda.</p>
<p>I do like sauerkraut.</p>
<p>I do drink the occasional kombucha.</p>
<p>I do like low sugar, not so sweet forms of fermented foods.</p>
<p>So I would be delighted if fermented foods are good for me,</p>
<p>but I have no stake in the fermented food industry.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, great.</p>
<p>Yeah, wonderful.</p>
<p>And an important note there is the one you pointed out</p>
<p>that this is an incredible collaboration</p>
<p>with Christopher Gardner&rsquo;s lab and a bunch of people,</p>
<p>Erica Sonnenberg helped lead this study</p>
<p>and then tons of, like you were saying, postdoc staff</p>
<p>and other people at Stanford</p>
<p>and then wonderful participants</p>
<p>that were part of this study.</p>
<p>So a huge team effort.</p>
<p>Before I dive into that study, let me take a step back</p>
<p>because I think the reason that we did this study</p>
<p>and kind of Christopher&rsquo;s group and our group</p>
<p>has started to pursue this line</p>
<p>of looking at dietary interventions</p>
<p>and how they impact our microbiome,</p>
<p>how they impact human biology,</p>
<p>goes back to this kind of epiphany that we had</p>
<p>while studying the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Because I think when we started studying it at Stanford,</p>
<p>we were thinking about it as this kind of newly appreciated</p>
<p>aspect of our biology,</p>
<p>almost like finding an organ that we didn&rsquo;t know was there</p>
<p>and starting to think about like all the drug targets</p>
<p>that were there.</p>
<p>Can we go in with small molecule drugs</p>
<p>and think of ways to manipulate this community</p>
<p>to ameliorate disease?</p>
<p>And this is largely the mindset of Western medicine</p>
<p>and largely born out of the era of infectious disease.</p>
<p>You wait for an infection to start a bacterial infection,</p>
<p>you treat with antibiotics</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the way medicine is practiced</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s become less successful over time</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve moved into this era</p>
<p>of inflammatory Western diseases</p>
<p>and with the exception of the current pandemic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sweeping the world,</p>
<p>largely moved out of the era of infectious diseases,</p>
<p>at least infectious bacterial diseases,</p>
<p>that this paradigm of waiting for diseases to appear</p>
<p>and come into the clinic is not really very effective</p>
<p>in the context of inflammatory Western diseases,</p>
<p>autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome,</p>
<p>heart diseases and inflammatory disease,</p>
<p>the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>And so we started to think a lot about</p>
<p>how can we get out in front of this?</p>
<p>How can we think about preventative ways</p>
<p>of dealing with this crisis</p>
<p>of metabolic and inflammatory diseases?</p>
<p>And this tremendous, beautiful body of literature</p>
<p>started to come forward in the field about 10 years ago</p>
<p>that showed that the gut microbiome</p>
<p>is absolutely critical to modulating our immune status.</p>
<p>So if you change the microbiome,</p>
<p>you can fundamentally change how the immune system operates.</p>
<p>And we know that the immune system</p>
<p>is at the basis of a lot of these diseases,</p>
<p>inflammatory chronic diseases.</p>
<p>And so it brought up this possibility</p>
<p>that maybe the fact that we&rsquo;re not nourishing</p>
<p>this community well enough,</p>
<p>maybe the fact that it&rsquo;s deteriorated over time</p>
<p>due to all of the things that go along</p>
<p>with an industrialized lifestyle, antibiotics and so forth,</p>
<p>maybe we have a microbiome right now</p>
<p>in the industrialized world</p>
<p>that is setting our immune system at a set point,</p>
<p>simmering inflammation that&rsquo;s driving us</p>
<p>towards these inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if we could figure out</p>
<p>how to use diet specifically,</p>
<p>but just kind of learn the rules of how to reconfigure</p>
<p>both the composition and function of our gut microbiome</p>
<p>so that inflammation was different in our bodies</p>
<p>so that each one of us was less likely to go on</p>
<p>and to develop an inflammatory disease,</p>
<p>leading to better longevity and health</p>
<p>over the course of our life.</p>
<p>And so we were studying this actually in mouse models</p>
<p>and realizing that we really needed</p>
<p>to start doing human studies.</p>
<p>We needed to start studying microbiome in humans.</p>
<p>And because we were studying diet,</p>
<p>we knew that this was something</p>
<p>we could go in and do right away.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to apply for FDA approval for a drug</p>
<p>before we could do a human study.</p>
<p>We could just start doing human dietary interventions,</p>
<p>longitudinally monitoring the immune system</p>
<p>and the microbiome,</p>
<p>and starting to put the pieces together</p>
<p>of what is it in diet that can change our microbiome</p>
<p>in a healthy way,</p>
<p>help us define what a healthy microbiome is,</p>
<p>and monitor the immune system in great detail.</p>
<p>And so there were really two critical components of this</p>
<p>in addition to our microbiome expertise.</p>
<p>One was Christopher Gardner&rsquo;s group.</p>
<p>We wanted to do these human studies,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re absolutely terrified of humans.</p>
<p>We work with mice.</p>
<p>Humans are terrifying in many ways.</p>
<p>But they house themselves.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to pay for their housing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, yeah.</p>
<p>For those that can afford housing, of course, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, sadly, just for that portion of the population.</p>
<p>So Christopher&rsquo;s group,</p>
<p>our masters are working with human populations.</p>
<p>And then the other wonderful thing that we have at Stanford</p>
<p>is this Human Immune Monitoring Center</p>
<p>run by Mark Davis and Holden Maker.</p>
<p>They started this beautiful center</p>
<p>for allowing people to do immunology in humans.</p>
<p>Critical element because a lot of the mouse studies</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t translate well to humans.</p>
<p>So if you can do the studies in humans,</p>
<p>similar to how we&rsquo;re thinking about the microbiome,</p>
<p>you learn something that you know is relevant to humans.</p>
<p>And so having that immune profiling capability</p>
<p>where we can monitor hundreds to thousands</p>
<p>of different parameters in the immune system</p>
<p>longitudinally in people from a blood draw,</p>
<p>and not just know if CRP goes up</p>
<p>or if interleukin-6 goes up or down,</p>
<p>but to be able to see all these facets</p>
<p>of the immune system change in concert</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re changing the microbiome with diet</p>
<p>was really a key component of this.</p>
<p>And so our flagship study, supported by wonderful donors,</p>
<p>so this actually isn&rsquo;t funded by typical foundations</p>
<p>and national institutes of health.</p>
<p>It was funded by philanthropy.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand if we put people</p>
<p>on a high-fiber diet,</p>
<p>how would that affect their microbiome and immune system?</p>
<p>And if we put them on a high-fermented food diet,</p>
<p>a diet rich in live microbes and all the metabolites</p>
<p>that are present from fermentation in foods,</p>
<p>how would that change microbiome and immune system?</p>
<p>Could you give us some examples</p>
<p>of what those diets look like?</p>
<p>And were you changing their basal diet</p>
<p>or were you just adding things on top</p>
<p>of what they were already eating?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s hard to change people&rsquo;s diets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>And you have to trust that they actually do it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not sneaking and-</p>
<p>Totally, yeah.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve started the Center</p>
<p>for Human Microbiome Studies at Stanford</p>
<p>for doing a lot of these studies.</p>
<p>And a portion of the studies we do focus on supplements,</p>
<p>probiotics, microbes delivered in pill form,</p>
<p>prebiotics, which are purified forms of fiber.</p>
<p>And in those cases, we actually can have placebo groups</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more like a drug study</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t change people&rsquo;s diets.</p>
<p>So we can just administer this on top of what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So in a way, they&rsquo;re a lot more controlled,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not food.</p>
<p>When you start doing food studies,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do a placebo group</p>
<p>because people know what they&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>And the other problem is that it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to just change one thing</p>
<p>because as soon as you start adding something,</p>
<p>people usually eliminate something else.</p>
<p>So the idea was to basically give these people</p>
<p>simple instructions for, in the case of the high-fiber diet,</p>
<p>just increasing plant-based fiber.</p>
<p>So can you eat more whole grains,</p>
<p>more legumes, more vegetables, nuts?</p>
<p>Get the fiber up in the range of,</p>
<p>from 15 to 20 grams per day, up to over 40 grams per day.</p>
<p>So can you kind of double or more</p>
<p>the amount of fiber that you eat per day,</p>
<p>knowing that that would have a tremendous impact</p>
<p>on a lot of other facets of their diet.</p>
<p>They eat less meat, animal-based protein,</p>
<p>less animal-based fats as a product of this.</p>
<p>I will say that getting back to Christopher&rsquo;s rule</p>
<p>for a healthy diet,</p>
<p>a lot of the macronutrient changes</p>
<p>that we saw in their diet</p>
<p>were consistent with healthy changes in diet,</p>
<p>less saturated fat, less animal-based protein,</p>
<p>more plant-based protein.</p>
<p>So a lot of changes that are known to be beneficial</p>
<p>kind of came in concert with just telling people,</p>
<p>eat a high plant-based fiber diet.</p>
<p>The people that were eating the high fermented food diet,</p>
<p>they were instructed to basically eat</p>
<p>foods that you could buy at a grocery store</p>
<p>that were naturally fermented and contain live microbes.</p>
<p>And so this largely consisted of yogurt,</p>
<p>kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi,</p>
<p>some fermented vegetables,</p>
<p>kind of brine-fermented vegetables.</p>
<p>Pickles.</p>
<p>Pickles, things like that.</p>
<p>But they do,</p>
<p>one of the things that I think is a pitfall</p>
<p>in choosing fermented foods</p>
<p>is you can go down the canned food aisle</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this huge section of pickles</p>
<p>in jars that are canned.</p>
<p>Those are not fermented foods.</p>
<p>Those are cucumbers that they&rsquo;ve put in,</p>
<p>acetic acid and vinegar</p>
<p>to reconstitute that fermented flavor,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no live microbes involved in that.</p>
<p>And even sauerkrauts in the canned food aisle,</p>
<p>even if they were naturally fermented,</p>
<p>quite often they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>quite often they&rsquo;re just brined in vinegar.</p>
<p>But even if they are naturally fermented,</p>
<p>all of the microbes are killed prior to canning</p>
<p>or during the process of canning.</p>
<p>And so what we use for this study,</p>
<p>and if you want to have live fermented foods</p>
<p>that contain live microbes,</p>
<p>you need to buy those out</p>
<p>of the refrigerated section, essentially.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really glad you pointed this out</p>
<p>because you can find sauerkraut</p>
<p>on the non-refrigerated shelf</p>
<p>that is indeed non-fermented.</p>
<p>A lot of fermented foods</p>
<p>that are available in the U.S.</p>
<p>can be high in sugar.</p>
<p>So was there any instruction as to</p>
<p>getting people to make sure</p>
<p>that they were consuming yogurts</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t loaded with sugar,</p>
<p>or did you let them just select</p>
<p>for the stuff in the cold section</p>
<p>that is fermented?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a super important point.</p>
<p>We instructed people to eat non-sweetened yogurts.</p>
<p>I think a huge pitfall in this area</p>
<p>is you can have a yogurt loaded with bacteria,</p>
<p>kind of the base of what&rsquo;s healthy,</p>
<p>and then a ton of artificial flavoring</p>
<p>and sugar loaded on top of that.</p>
<p>Manufacturers put a ton of sugar in</p>
<p>after the fact to kind of mask</p>
<p>the sour taste of fermented foods,</p>
<p>which is hard for some people</p>
<p>to become accustomed to.</p>
<p>When we were switching to more fermented foods,</p>
<p>when our daughters were young at that point,</p>
<p>we would take plain yogurt,</p>
<p>which they didn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>just kind of neat.</p>
<p>We would mix in a little maple syrup or honey,</p>
<p>just a little bit,</p>
<p>and gradually we reduced that over time</p>
<p>to the point where their palate adjusted,</p>
<p>and now they just really like plain yogurt.</p>
<p>But I think getting used to that sour flavor</p>
<p>is difficult,</p>
<p>but people really should try to stay away</p>
<p>from those fermented foods</p>
<p>that are loaded with sugar,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we instructed people</p>
<p>on this study.</p>
<p>And beer was not included, right?</p>
<p>The number of people that asked,</p>
<p>when I did a brief thing on social media</p>
<p>about this study,</p>
<p>and hopefully I got it right,</p>
<p>I think I did,</p>
<p>but people just ask about beer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a drinker,</p>
<p>so for me,</p>
<p>beer has no appeal anyway,</p>
<p>but beer is fermented, correct?</p>
<p>But were they instructed to avoid beer</p>
<p>or to drink beer?</p>
<p>Just to go with their normal dietary habits,</p>
<p>but that did not count as a fermented food.</p>
<p>And kombucha was,</p>
<p>and kombucha can have small amounts of alcohol in it,</p>
<p>but kombucha actually was one of the major things</p>
<p>that people drank or consumed</p>
<p>during the fermented food phase.</p>
<p>And the deal with beer</p>
<p>is that there may be beneficial properties</p>
<p>of the microbial communities</p>
<p>in naturally fermented beer,</p>
<p>but most of the beer that we buy,</p>
<p>again, is canned and filtered,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no live microbes there.</p>
<p>So very different than if you siphon it off</p>
<p>of your home brew and drink it, probably,</p>
<p>if you buy it in a store.</p>
<p>I will get to the results of the study</p>
<p>in just one moment,</p>
<p>but I want to say,</p>
<p>a lot of people shy away</p>
<p>from the high-quality fermented foods</p>
<p>because they can be quite costly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just refer people to a resource</p>
<p>in Tim Ferriss&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>The 4-Hour Chef.</p>
<p>He actually gives an excellent recipe</p>
<p>for making your own sauerkraut,</p>
<p>which basically involves cabbage and water and salt,</p>
<p>but you have to do it properly</p>
<p>because you can grow some,</p>
<p>not necessarily lethal,</p>
<p>but some somewhat dangerous bacteria</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t scrape off the top layer properly.</p>
<p>But he gives beautiful instructions</p>
<p>for how to do this in vats.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve started doing this at home now,</p>
<p>actually, which is a ceramic vat.</p>
<p>And you can make large amounts</p>
<p>of truly fermented sauerkraut</p>
<p>just from cabbage, water, and salt,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to follow the protocol.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in science,</p>
<p>that protocol looks a lot like</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll do for most of your graduate career,</p>
<p>except maybe some sequencing too.</p>
<p>So anyway, just to refer people</p>
<p>to a source that&rsquo;s very low cost</p>
<p>compared to buying the high-quality fermented foods.</p>
<p>Even kombuchas, for some people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like $5 a bottle, only this much.</p>
<p>And if you consume liquids the way I consume them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the start.</p>
<p>But if you can get your hands on a SCOBY,</p>
<p>kombucha&rsquo;s another one that&rsquo;s super simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>You can grow your own.</p>
<p>You can just make your own,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s super easy to do.</p>
<p>I constantly have a batch of kombucha going at home.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a SCOBY,</p>
<p>a symbiotic community of bacteria and yeast</p>
<p>that you brew tea, you add sugar to it,</p>
<p>and you put the SCOBY in,</p>
<p>and you wait a week or two,</p>
<p>depending upon the temperature.</p>
<p>And then you just move the SCOBY over to a new batch,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re old.</p>
<p>What the SCOBY was in is kombucha,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I would love it if members of this audience</p>
<p>would start to make their own kombucha and sauerkraut.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having so much fun.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s done in our home.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go anywhere near the food production,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s for everyone&rsquo;s benefit.</p>
<p>So how much fermented food,</p>
<p>and then were they consuming?</p>
<p>Because you mentioned the number of grams,</p>
<p>approximately, of fiber.</p>
<p>But was it in servings, ounces,</p>
<p>how many times a day, early day, late day?</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>So we had a wonderful dietician</p>
<p>instructing people for this,</p>
<p>and her name&rsquo;s Dahlia Pearlman,</p>
<p>and she really was the key,</p>
<p>and is the key for many of our studies</p>
<p>for getting people to eat differently.</p>
<p>And the general instructions were</p>
<p>for people to eat as much fermented foods as possible,</p>
<p>more is better.</p>
<p>And the reason is that with this initial study,</p>
<p>we really wanted to maximize our chance of seeing a signal</p>
<p>if there was something biological going on,</p>
<p>with the idea that if the dose was excessive</p>
<p>and not easily achievable by a lot of people in the end,</p>
<p>we can go back and say,</p>
<p>okay, this is the point at which</p>
<p>we lose the biological signal.</p>
<p>But people, during the height of the intervention phase,</p>
<p>the intervention phase was six weeks,</p>
<p>during the height of that,</p>
<p>were up over six servings on average per day</p>
<p>of fermented food,</p>
<p>so kind of two servings at each meal.</p>
<p>And the ounces or weight or size,</p>
<p>it really depended on what the fermented food was,</p>
<p>and we just told them to stick to what was a recommended</p>
<p>dose on the package that they were buying.</p>
<p>For a kombucha, it&rsquo;d be like a six to eight ounce glass,</p>
<p>sauerkraut, like a half cup or something like that,</p>
<p>and the same with yogurt.</p>
<p>Great, so what were the results?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the results astounded us in a way,</p>
<p>but then thinking more deeply,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be evident even after I explain it</p>
<p>in the context of this conversation,</p>
<p>likely why we saw the results we saw.</p>
<p>The results were astounding</p>
<p>because our hypothesis going into this</p>
<p>was that the high-fiber diet</p>
<p>was going to give the massive signal.</p>
<p>We know that this is the big deficiency</p>
<p>in the Western diet.</p>
<p>All the mouse studies have told us</p>
<p>that high fiber really leads to a much healthier microbiota,</p>
<p>can lead to positive changes in the immune system.</p>
<p>And in fact, even when we had a limited,</p>
<p>we had wonderful donor support,</p>
<p>but still a limited amount of money</p>
<p>when we started this study,</p>
<p>my lab was really very eager to do</p>
<p>the high-fiber part of this really well.</p>
<p>And Christopher kind of had to twist our arms</p>
<p>to do the fermented food side of it.</p>
<p>And we thought it was kind of quirky and neat,</p>
<p>like live microbes should be exciting,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s try it.</p>
<p>So we put that in,</p>
<p>and it turns out that we were very thankful</p>
<p>that he twisted our arms</p>
<p>because it was that high-fermented food arm</p>
<p>that really gave us the big signal,</p>
<p>even though our hypothesis was that the high-fiber</p>
<p>was going to lead to more short-chain fatty acids</p>
<p>produced in the gut, more diverse microbiota,</p>
<p>less inflammation in the immune system,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t see that across the cohort.</p>
<p>We actually saw very individualized responses</p>
<p>to the dietary fiber,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll come back to what those responses were.</p>
<p>The big signal really was in the fermented food group.</p>
<p>We saw all the things that you would hope to see</p>
<p>in a Western microbiota and Western human.</p>
<p>We saw this increase in microbiota diversity</p>
<p>over the course of the six weeks</p>
<p>while they were consuming the fermented foods.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t always say that higher diversity is better</p>
<p>when it comes to our microbial communities.</p>
<p>We know there are cases, for instance,</p>
<p>bacterial vaginosis where higher diversity</p>
<p>is actually indicative of a disease state.</p>
<p>But we know in the context of the gut</p>
<p>and for people living in the industrialized world,</p>
<p>higher diversity is generally better.</p>
<p>We know that there&rsquo;s a spectrum of diversity.</p>
<p>People with higher diversity generally</p>
<p>are healthier.</p>
<p>If you can push your diversity higher,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in better shape.</p>
<p>And so we saw that increase in diversity.</p>
<p>And then the major question is what happened</p>
<p>to the immune system as these people</p>
<p>were increasing their gut microbiota diversity</p>
<p>through the fermented foods?</p>
<p>So we did this massive immune profiling,</p>
<p>and we see a couple dozen immune markers,</p>
<p>inflammatory markers, decrease over the course of the study.</p>
<p>So we measure these at multiple time points</p>
<p>throughout the course of the study,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s kind of this stepwise reduction</p>
<p>in things like interleukin-6 and interleukin-12,</p>
<p>a variety of kind of famous inflammatory mediators.</p>
<p>And then even if you go into the immune cells</p>
<p>and you start looking at their signaling cascades,</p>
<p>we see that those signaling cascades are less activated</p>
<p>at the end of the study compared to the beginning</p>
<p>of the study, indicating an attenuation of inflammation.</p>
<p>So kind of exactly what we would hypothesize</p>
<p>would lead to less propensity</p>
<p>for inflammatory disease over time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge extension of a very short study.</p>
<p>How long was this study again?</p>
<p>So the complete protocol, I think,</p>
<p>was 14 to 17 weeks or something like that.</p>
<p>The actual intervention phase consisted</p>
<p>of a four-week ramp and then a six-week maintenance period.</p>
<p>So the intervention itself was 10 weeks,</p>
<p>but there were six weeks of really kind of</p>
<p>hardcore high levels of fiber or fermented foods.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned the ramp</p>
<p>because my experience with fermented foods</p>
<p>is that it can be beneficial to give the system</p>
<p>an opportunity to acclimate.</p>
<p>I mean, if you consume a giant bowl of sauerkraut,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be the worst day and night of your life,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll know you did, just leave it at that.</p>
<p>And so you want to kind of acclimate to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the point now where some people</p>
<p>might think this is gross.</p>
<p>But after I exercise, I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot.</p>
<p>I like the saltiness of the,</p>
<p>actually drink the liquid that the sauerkraut</p>
<p>has been stewing in.</p>
<p>And I like to think that I consume</p>
<p>some fermentation that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s salty.</p>
<p>It acts as kind of a post-training replenishment.</p>
<p>But if I had done that six months ago straight off,</p>
<p>I think it would have been pretty rough on my system.</p>
<p>I started taking little bits of it</p>
<p>and then adding it each day.</p>
<p>Totally, and so both with the fermented foods</p>
<p>and the fiber, it&rsquo;s well-known that this kind</p>
<p>of gradual ramping is a really important way</p>
<p>of mitigating bloating and other kind</p>
<p>of digestive discomfort that can happen</p>
<p>when your microbiome reconfigures</p>
<p>and starts fermenting more and changing community members.</p>
<p>So you should take that ramp at your own pace.</p>
<p>If something seems to be going wrong,</p>
<p>just kind of level off, stay there.</p>
<p>You know, we did this in a very delicate way</p>
<p>to get people up to the high dose.</p>
<p>The brine question, just a tangent here for a second,</p>
<p>that was actually one of the products</p>
<p>that we had people use in the fermented food phase.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a product called GutShots,</p>
<p>which is just the brine that they&rsquo;ve marketed.</p>
<p>We actually are now studying it in the lab.</p>
<p>I just actually, before this, came from a lab meeting</p>
<p>where a GI fellow in my lab is actually putting GutShots,</p>
<p>sterilized gut microbes, or the fermentation microbes,</p>
<p>removed or present into mice and looking at changes</p>
<p>in their mucosal immune system.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re studying this in detail now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a rich source of lactate</p>
<p>and a bunch of other interesting metabolites.</p>
<p>I love that my weird behavior is inadvertently being studied</p>
<p>at Stanford Medicine.</p>
<p>I want to just mention something about the GutShots.</p>
<p>Those are sold as a drink.</p>
<p>Those also, just for certain listeners</p>
<p>in different budgets, they can be very expensive</p>
<p>if you really think about,</p>
<p>some of them are exceedingly expensive.</p>
<p>But what I described before</p>
<p>with making your own kombuchas, it&rsquo;s not quite brining,</p>
<p>but the homemade sauerkraut,</p>
<p>that protocol is out there, as I mentioned in Tim&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>The Four-Hour Chef.</p>
<p>And you get a lot of the brining from that,</p>
<p>an almost endless amount.</p>
<p>A cautionary note, I once went into the refrigerator</p>
<p>and saw something similar to GutShot.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t GutShot.</p>
<p>And I drank the whole 12-ounce bottle</p>
<p>and realized that it was 24 servings.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I got my initial experience</p>
<p>with what it is to not do a ramp-up phase.</p>
<p>I do not recommend doing that.</p>
<p>Some of these, it&rsquo;s very potent, it seems,</p>
<p>and you can consume even a half an ounce or an ounce.</p>
<p>Yeah, very potent from the standpoint of fermentation,</p>
<p>but also very salty.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a lot of effects that can, yeah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do what I do, at least not at the outset.</p>
<p>And so, that is an experienced warning.</p>
<p>So, they did this, as I recall,</p>
<p>there was a swap condition or there was a halt condition.</p>
<p>So, you did controls, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just comparing groups.</p>
<p>You had individuals who were initially</p>
<p>in one group or the other move to a different group.</p>
<p>Well, so we-</p>
<p>Or to stop and then return.</p>
<p>Yeah, we actually just did a stop</p>
<p>and followed them during a washout phase.</p>
<p>And the ideal situation for dietary interventions like this</p>
<p>are to do crossover studies, as you&rsquo;re suggesting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recently completed a ketogenic</p>
<p>versus Mediterranean diet intervention.</p>
<p>Are those data published yet?</p>
<p>Not yet, but Christopher&rsquo;s been tweeting</p>
<p>a lot of these data</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a paper in revision right now.</p>
<p>So, if you go to Christopher Gardner&rsquo;s Twitter feed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to find him reporting</p>
<p>some of the early results of this study.</p>
<p>Can you give us a snippet of, was there a superior,</p>
<p>just give us a, you don&rsquo;t have to tell us which one,</p>
<p>but was there a superior condition</p>
<p>of either Mediterranean versus ketogenic?</p>
<p>So, the metabolic effects of these, it&rsquo;s a beautiful study.</p>
<p>I should let his group comment on that.</p>
<p>The microbiota data we actually are just generating now.</p>
<p>So, the study that his group has put together from this</p>
<p>is largely independent of the microbiota data.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re doing a more in-depth analysis</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll have more to say about that in the future.</p>
<p>But that-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to that, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a super exciting study</p>
<p>because it is one of these where people eat a certain way.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really beautiful about this</p>
<p>is we even got food delivered for part of the intervention.</p>
<p>So, we had complete control over what they</p>
<p>at least had available to eat.</p>
<p>And then the second phase, they make the food on their own</p>
<p>and then we cross over and do the same thing.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s really like the,</p>
<p>if you have a good enough budget,</p>
<p>the right way to do a study like this.</p>
<p>For this, we didn&rsquo;t have the time or money to do a crossover</p>
<p>but we did do a washout phase where people,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t make them stop eating whatever</p>
<p>if they were enjoying it, but we monitored</p>
<p>and there was some recidivism where there was a decrease</p>
<p>in fiber fermented food.</p>
<p>And we could see, for instance, diversity start</p>
<p>to plateau and reverse in many of these people.</p>
<p>So, there does appear to be like a need for maintenance</p>
<p>of the intervention to maintain</p>
<p>the perceived health benefits that we were measuring.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to the study in the caption</p>
<p>and thank you for that very clear and thorough description</p>
<p>from one of the investigators involved in the study.</p>
<p>That all, it&rsquo;s great to go direct to the source.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, were there improvements in mood,</p>
<p>in resistance to colds and infection</p>
<p>during the course of the study?</p>
<p>And this is kind of a prelude to where I&rsquo;m headed next,</p>
<p>which is there is a tremendous amount of interest</p>
<p>in the so-called gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>But also, I wanna make sure that we talk</p>
<p>about how these microbes and the conditions</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re establishing in the gut are creating positive</p>
<p>or negative health effects.</p>
<p>I mean, actually, basically how signals get out of the gut.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I certainly noticed that when I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>more fermented foods or there&rsquo;s probiotics</p>
<p>in drinks I consume and so forth,</p>
<p>that I feel, quote-unquote, air quotes,</p>
<p>completely subjective, I feel better.</p>
<p>I wish there was an objective measure of feeling better,</p>
<p>but I seem to think more clearly, sleep better,</p>
<p>mood, et cetera, and I know I&rsquo;m not alone in that.</p>
<p>And people, and anytime I&rsquo;ve taken harsh antibiotics,</p>
<p>I feel worse, but then again, I&rsquo;m usually taking them</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m feeling bad about something else, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take them just because.</p>
<p>So did people say they were feeling better in any way?</p>
<p>And if so, what did you observe?</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re highlighting these as anic data.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>As part of this effort to look at how dietary interventions</p>
<p>affect our health and wellbeing and so forth</p>
<p>in microbiome and immune system,</p>
<p>we interact with a lot of people who have read our book</p>
<p>or kind of have become microbiome enthusiasts</p>
<p>and have implemented a lot of these changes</p>
<p>in their personal life.</p>
<p>And I hear the same thing that you&rsquo;re saying, Andrew,</p>
<p>that tons of people say they have more energy,</p>
<p>they think more clearly, they sleep better,</p>
<p>their family is nicer to each other,</p>
<p>like the number of crazy things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really hard to uncouple like,</p>
<p>is this because these people have taken charge now</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re eating and just feel better in general</p>
<p>for being in control of kind of what they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Or is there this cascading set of effects</p>
<p>that are actually impacting</p>
<p>or kind of emanating from the gut-brain axis?</p>
<p>And so we actually implemented a bunch of questionnaires</p>
<p>and even a cognitive test to try to get at some of this.</p>
<p>And I should say, the list of this goes on and on.</p>
<p>There are people who claim that their complexion improves</p>
<p>and that their allergies,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s probably all sorts of ripple effects.</p>
<p>If you can affect your inflammation,</p>
<p>we know that you can affect your cognition.</p>
<p>We know that you can affect your skin</p>
<p>and inflammation that&rsquo;s occurring on your skin.</p>
<p>So I really think that there is a basis</p>
<p>for a lot of those anecdotes.</p>
<p>It may just be hard to see in a short study</p>
<p>and in a small cohort of people over a short period of time,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t really see significant things</p>
<p>associated with cognition and moods</p>
<p>and all of the things that we were testing for,</p>
<p>which, yeah, there could be a variety</p>
<p>of explanations for that.</p>
<p>We also have a standardized stool measure that people use,</p>
<p>and there was kind of less constipation,</p>
<p>better bowel movements over the course</p>
<p>of both of these interventions.</p>
<p>So it did seem like bowel habits improved,</p>
<p>which a lot of times can lead to better moods,</p>
<p>but we weren&rsquo;t able to measure that.</p>
<p>The classic psychoanalysts would have a field day with that.</p>
<p>What sorts of interesting things did you observe</p>
<p>in the fiber group?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s clear that that group</p>
<p>yielded some unexpected findings in both directions.</p>
<p>Things you expected to see,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t see to the same amplitude</p>
<p>as you did in the fermented food group,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing you also saw some very interesting things</p>
<p>in the fiber group.</p>
<p>Totally, yeah.</p>
<p>So we started looking at the data in more detail</p>
<p>when we didn&rsquo;t see the cohort-wide response.</p>
<p>One of the things we observed is that</p>
<p>in measuring all these immune parameters,</p>
<p>there appeared to be three different groups</p>
<p>of kind of immune responses that we were seeing.</p>
<p>One group that got overall less inflammatory,</p>
<p>and then two other groups that kind of had a mixed result,</p>
<p>partly more inflammatory, partly less inflammatory</p>
<p>in all these markers that we were looking at.</p>
<p>And when we started digging into like what aspect</p>
<p>of the biology of those people dictated or predicted</p>
<p>which group they fell into,</p>
<p>the really interesting part is the people</p>
<p>with the highest diversity gut microbiomes</p>
<p>to start the study were the ones that were most likely</p>
<p>to have the decreases in inflammation.</p>
<p>And so the data seemed to be telling us that</p>
<p>if you start off with a diverse microbiota,</p>
<p>maybe one that&rsquo;s better equipped to degrade</p>
<p>a wide variety of dietary fiber,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to respond positively to it.</p>
<p>If you have a very depleted gut microbiome,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not as likely to be able to respond to it.</p>
<p>And thinking back to that experiment</p>
<p>that we talked about before with the multi-generational loss</p>
<p>of fiber-fermenting microbes in mice</p>
<p>that were fed a Western diet,</p>
<p>it may be that many of us in the industrialized world</p>
<p>have a microbiome that&rsquo;s so depleted now</p>
<p>that even if we consume a high-fiber diet,</p>
<p>at least for a short period of time,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the right microbes in our gut</p>
<p>to degrade that fiber.</p>
<p>And this has actually been observed by other groups,</p>
<p>beautiful study out of University of Minnesota,</p>
<p>looking at immigrants coming to the United States.</p>
<p>And within nine months,</p>
<p>but certainly over the course of years,</p>
<p>immigrants that come here lose a lot of the diversity</p>
<p>in their gut microbiome,</p>
<p>but a lot of the fiber degrading capacity</p>
<p>in their gut microbiome too.</p>
<p>So it could be that over time,</p>
<p>this becomes a one-way street</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard for us to recover the microbes</p>
<p>that actually can degrade the fiber.</p>
<p>And I think that this probably intersects</p>
<p>with sanitation in our environment</p>
<p>and the fact that we don&rsquo;t have access to new microbes</p>
<p>that might help us degrade the fiber,</p>
<p>that we actually have lost these microbes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in some ways irrecoverable</p>
<p>without deliberate reintroduction</p>
<p>of fiber degrading microbes.</p>
<p>I can recall from childhood,</p>
<p>there were kids that would eat dirt and snails</p>
<p>and stuff that just sounds totally disgusting,</p>
<p>but kids covered with mud</p>
<p>and that maybe not so much anymore.</p>
<p>And certainly during the pandemic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot more use of these hand sanitizers</p>
<p>that prior to that, people seem pretty spooked about,</p>
<p>but then obviously they prioritize them.</p>
<p>So do you, while you have children,</p>
<p>do you encourage them to,</p>
<p>when they were young,</p>
<p>did you encourage them to interact with pets and dirt</p>
<p>and stuff in the environment</p>
<p>provided that stuff wasn&rsquo;t immediately toxic?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So this is really, it&rsquo;s a continual cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>I think the, I will say that with the pandemic now</p>
<p>and certainly just with infectious diseases in general,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important to be aware</p>
<p>of the possibility for compromising your health</p>
<p>through the spread of germs.</p>
<p>And so that is just, hand-washing is important</p>
<p>and we have to be careful with the spread of germs.</p>
<p>But I do think that the sanitization of our environment</p>
<p>has gone overboard with various things</p>
<p>being impregnated with antibiotics,</p>
<p>shopping carts and things like that,</p>
<p>and toothbrushes, and it&rsquo;s like antibiotics</p>
<p>and things for killing microbes are everywhere.</p>
<p>And when we were raising,</p>
<p>when our daughters were young</p>
<p>and we were making these decisions,</p>
<p>the calculations that we would make were really,</p>
<p>one, how likely are they to encounter</p>
<p>a disease-causing microbe?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve been out on a hike or in our garden,</p>
<p>just kind of working in the dirt or whatever,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not as important to wash your hands</p>
<p>before you have lunch,</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s a little bit of dirt on them.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;ve been in a public playground</p>
<p>where maybe there&rsquo;s other kids with germs</p>
<p>or maybe even chemicals like pesticides</p>
<p>and herbicides that are being used,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s more important than to wash your hands.</p>
<p>Certainly if you&rsquo;ve been in the grocery store</p>
<p>or on the subway, probably a good idea to wash your hands.</p>
<p>But so I think you really need to think about</p>
<p>kind of the context of it and exposure to microbes,</p>
<p>from the environment is likely an important part</p>
<p>of educating our immune system</p>
<p>and keeping the proper balance in our immune system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a matter of figuring out</p>
<p>the right way to do that safely.</p>
<p>And it may be that the fermented food result that we saw</p>
<p>is a way of tapping into those same pathways,</p>
<p>kind of an environmental exposure to microbes that&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to touch on how signals get from the gut</p>
<p>to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>And we probably don&rsquo;t have time to go into all the systems</p>
<p>that benefit from having a diverse microbiome</p>
<p>or healthy microbiome,</p>
<p>but we talked about the immune system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s active signaling and transport from the gut</p>
<p>all along its length, as far as I know,</p>
<p>into the bloodstream and to other organs and tissues.</p>
<p>So for the immune system, it seems straightforward.</p>
<p>It could reduce the amount or number</p>
<p>of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and so forth,</p>
<p>maybe increase the anti-inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>like IL-10 and others.</p>
<p>But we know there&rsquo;s a gut brain axis and neurons</p>
<p>that literally talk in both directions</p>
<p>between brain and gut.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m eating my fermented foods,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing all the right things and my gut is diverse</p>
<p>and I have all the goodies at all the right places.</p>
<p>How is it that the fact that those microbiota are thriving</p>
<p>is conveyed to the rest of the body?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re in there doing their thing</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that they have a mind,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re probably not thinking of taking care of me,</p>
<p>but I feel better or I might get sick less often</p>
<p>or combat any illness more quickly.</p>
<p>How is that actually happening?</p>
<p>I mean, is it that the microbiota stay restricted</p>
<p>to the gut, but the signaling molecules</p>
<p>are all in a downstream way</p>
<p>or are making good or bad things happen?</p>
<p>Or is there some sort of direct recognition</p>
<p>at the body level, or are there cells in the body</p>
<p>that are responding to, ah, the gut microbiome is healthy</p>
<p>and therefore I can make more of the good stuff</p>
<p>and less of the bad stuff, so to speak?</p>
<p>Yeah, great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s super complex.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge array of ways that our body perceives</p>
<p>both the microbes and the molecules that they produce</p>
<p>in our gut, and the molecules they produce</p>
<p>are, of course, a product of what microbes are there</p>
<p>and then what they receive as kind of metabolic inputs,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re eating and what other microbes are present</p>
<p>in the environment providing molecules to them.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s this complex matrix,</p>
<p>but we, you know, probably the simplest place to start</p>
<p>is just the immune system.</p>
<p>We have an immune system that, you know,</p>
<p>the vast majority of immune cells in our body</p>
<p>are located in our gut just because there&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>a dense population of microbes there that have,</p>
<p>you know, we consider them beneficial microbes,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re only beneficial if they&rsquo;re in the right spot</p>
<p>in the gut.</p>
<p>As soon as they mislocalize, we know that they can become</p>
<p>opportunistic pathogens.</p>
<p>And so the immune system really playing an important role</p>
<p>to keep them in place is essential for the system</p>
<p>not moving into a disease space.</p>
<p>The immune system has a variety of ways of monitoring</p>
<p>what microbes are there.</p>
<p>There are actually specialized structures in the gut</p>
<p>known as Peyer&rsquo;s patches that actually take up microbes.</p>
<p>They actually allow microbes to transit</p>
<p>into this population of immune cells</p>
<p>in a very controlled way so that that set of immune cells</p>
<p>becomes educated as to what microbes</p>
<p>are just on the other side of the barrier.</p>
<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s kind of like a border patrol.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>So they bring them in, they, you know, fingerprint them</p>
<p>and then, you know, have kind of this, you know,</p>
<p>set of responses ready to go if needed.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>There are other cells known as dendritic cells,</p>
<p>special types that actually send long arms,</p>
<p>these processes out into the lumen of the gut</p>
<p>and do the same thing, take up microbes,</p>
<p>bring them back in and sample them.</p>
<p>In addition to these direct sampling mechanisms,</p>
<p>the cells that line the gut have a huge array of receptors,</p>
<p>specialized proteins that perceive patterns</p>
<p>that the molecular patterns that the microbes make.</p>
<p>So things like endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide,</p>
<p>just the cell wall of the bacteria.</p>
<p>We have specialized receptors that recognize those.</p>
<p>If those signals become too profound</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re perceived in the wrong place,</p>
<p>that can stimulate an inflammatory response.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all these ways of kind of monitoring</p>
<p>the membership and where it is and how close it is.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s this whole other set of ways</p>
<p>of perceiving metabolic activity</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening in the gut.</p>
<p>And you mentioned before this direct,</p>
<p>these cell types that express taste receptors in the gut</p>
<p>and have ways of sampling dietary components.</p>
<p>There are those same types of analogous cells in our gut</p>
<p>that are perceiving metabolites produced by the microbiota</p>
<p>so that our bodies can perceive</p>
<p>what sort of metabolic activity is going on.</p>
<p>And then in addition to that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this tremendously important enteric nervous system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sending signals back to the brain,</p>
<p>dictating things like motility.</p>
<p>Do I get rid of what&rsquo;s in here?</p>
<p>Do I move it along quickly?</p>
<p>What actually is happening?</p>
<p>Do I need to interact with immune cells?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this really complex array of interactions</p>
<p>between the different cell types.</p>
<p>And then a lot of the cells that are in the gut</p>
<p>perceiving all of these signals,</p>
<p>a lot of the immune cells can actually get up and leave.</p>
<p>They can get into the blood cycle through</p>
<p>and then home to other regions of the mucosal surfaces</p>
<p>so that mucosal surfaces are educated broadly</p>
<p>against what&rsquo;s passing through our gut.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a variety of ways of cells communicating.</p>
<p>And then a lot of the molecules that the microbiota makes</p>
<p>can actually make their way into the bloodstream directly.</p>
<p>And so the array of molecules is still being defined.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to figure out what all these chemicals are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned the short-chain fatty acids,</p>
<p>but those are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>There are really interesting compounds</p>
<p>like indole derivatives and phenols</p>
<p>and derived from amino acids metabolized by gut microbes</p>
<p>taken up into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And then we further metabolize these.</p>
<p>They become kind of co-microbe host metabolites,</p>
<p>and then they can go on and bind to different receptors</p>
<p>throughout our body, anywhere our bloodstream has access to</p>
<p>and start to trigger signaling cascades.</p>
<p>Is it known whether or not any of those molecules</p>
<p>are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier?</p>
<p>Because the hypothesis and the current thinking</p>
<p>is that neurotransmitters manufactured in the gut</p>
<p>and signaling along the gut-brain axis,</p>
<p>literally neurons talking back and forth electrically</p>
<p>from brain to gut and gut to brain,</p>
<p>is what regulates things like mood</p>
<p>or at least in animal models.</p>
<p>And there are some emerging human studies,</p>
<p>improvement of symptoms in autism spectrum disorders,</p>
<p>maybe even in ADHD.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m basically saying here</p>
<p>is there is some evidence emerging</p>
<p>that improving the gut microbiome</p>
<p>can improve outcomes in psychiatric</p>
<p>and developmental disorders.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>is that the microbiota themselves</p>
<p>are manufacturing chemicals</p>
<p>that can make it into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And therefore, I&rsquo;m asking if those chemicals</p>
<p>can move from the bloodstream into the brain directly,</p>
<p>it may not be a gut-brain axis via neurons.</p>
<p>It actually could just be seepage of serotonin</p>
<p>into the brain or acetylcholine into the brain,</p>
<p>for that matter.</p>
<p>Totally, yeah.</p>
<p>And the biology of most of these molecules</p>
<p>is not well understood,</p>
<p>but certainly in cerebrospinal fluid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been analyzed,</p>
<p>you can perceive these microbial metabolites.</p>
<p>So they are there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the answer.</p>
<p>Yeah, some of them are getting across the barrier.</p>
<p>But so a really interesting thing</p>
<p>is I think a lot of these molecules are,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re experienced at high enough doses,</p>
<p>are toxic or have toxic properties.</p>
<p>We know that a lot of these metabolites,</p>
<p>when they make their way into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>eventually are excreted through the kidneys and urine.</p>
<p>So actually we can monitor the metabolism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in your gut</p>
<p>by actually looking at the metabolites</p>
<p>that are present in your urine,</p>
<p>because many of those originated in your gut</p>
<p>from your gut microbes.</p>
<p>But people with kidney disease,</p>
<p>whose kidneys&rsquo; filtering process</p>
<p>is not functioning properly,</p>
<p>actually build up high levels</p>
<p>of many of these metabolites into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And that can lead to more of these molecules</p>
<p>making it across the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>And in fact, some of the transporters in the kidney</p>
<p>that are responsible for shuttling</p>
<p>these molecules out into urine</p>
<p>are also found at the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>for shuttling the molecules back into the bloodstream</p>
<p>if they do get across.</p>
<p>And we know that mental fog</p>
<p>is one of the big symptoms of kidney disease,</p>
<p>potentially because a lot of these metabolites</p>
<p>accumulate in blood and then make their way</p>
<p>across the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>into the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned mental fog.</p>
<p>A few years back, there were some reports,</p>
<p>some scientific reports,</p>
<p>and as a consequence in the media,</p>
<p>that excessive intake of pill-form probiotics</p>
<p>could create mental fog.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that ever took hold.</p>
<p>And it raises a general question</p>
<p>about pill-form probiotics.</p>
<p>I took them for a few years,</p>
<p>just thinking that would be good for my gut microbiome,</p>
<p>and then I switched to the fermented food thing,</p>
<p>largely as a consequence of the work</p>
<p>that you and Chris published.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the thought about probiotics</p>
<p>for the typical person that&rsquo;s not recovering</p>
<p>from a round of antibiotics</p>
<p>or that has been prescribed to them?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that the species of microbiota</p>
<p>that they proliferate might not be the species</p>
<p>that we want to proliferate,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve also heard that maybe that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your general stance?</p>
<p>They can be quite expensive also.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve been talking about expense a lot today,</p>
<p>but I always wanna take into account</p>
<p>that people are showing up to the table</p>
<p>with a variety of budgets.</p>
<p>And probiotics are one of the more expensive</p>
<p>supplements out there.</p>
<p>You can quickly get into the several hundreds of dollars</p>
<p>per month if you&rsquo;re getting the quote-unquote</p>
<p>best quality ones.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re actually causing brain fog,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d wanna use them.</p>
<p>No, completely.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a ton of snake oil out there.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just people know that they,</p>
<p>I think many of these companies are aware</p>
<p>that they can pray off of people&rsquo;s fears</p>
<p>and get a lot of money from them</p>
<p>with absolutely no data to back up</p>
<p>that their probiotic is doing anything.</p>
<p>So I think the first thing to say is buyer beware</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a supplement market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s largely unregulated.</p>
<p>And that means that there are a lot of bad products</p>
<p>out there and a lot of products that,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re not intended to be bad,</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t have great quality control.</p>
<p>There have been several studies</p>
<p>that have taken off the, over the counter,</p>
<p>just kind of off the shelf probiotics,</p>
<p>surveyed what&rsquo;s in there based on sequencing.</p>
<p>And shown that they,</p>
<p>what is in there does not match what&rsquo;s on the label.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true of many supplements</p>
<p>and unfortunately supplement companies.</p>
<p>This is something we get into on the podcast a lot.</p>
<p>There are reputable brands</p>
<p>and they go through a lot of work to get things right.</p>
<p>And there are many that just, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t match what&rsquo;s listed.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so there are places that probiotic companies</p>
<p>can send their product to have it independently validated.</p>
<p>So you want to look for that sort of validation</p>
<p>on a product.</p>
<p>There also are names that are just very well-known</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>their reputations are on the line.</p>
<p>So they probably invest a little bit more</p>
<p>in quality control than maybe some of the</p>
<p>other lesser known names.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a huge range of data on probiotics.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that we kind of recommend</p>
<p>is try to find good products</p>
<p>and then experiment for yourself</p>
<p>and see if you can find something that works for you.</p>
<p>I know people who have experienced constipation</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t want to change their diet</p>
<p>and have found a probiotic that helps them with that.</p>
<p>If you can find that right mix, great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>I would say that the data right now</p>
<p>is not overwhelmingly positive</p>
<p>for what probiotics do to the gut microbiota.</p>
<p>So there have been some nice studies looking at</p>
<p>the impact of probiotics on recovery</p>
<p>after antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p>And it appears to slow down the recovery</p>
<p>of the mucosal microbiota.</p>
<p>And some other studies that have,</p>
<p>where the big signal isn&rsquo;t seen,</p>
<p>as you might hope with a probiotic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supposed to treat a different disease.</p>
<p>There have been meta-analysis that do suggest</p>
<p>in certain instances, recovery from antibiotics,</p>
<p>that even though it may cause your microbiota</p>
<p>to recover more slowly,</p>
<p>that it may actually prevent diarrheal disease,</p>
<p>recovery from viral diarrheas, probiotics may help.</p>
<p>But because there&rsquo;s such a huge range of products</p>
<p>and because each person is their own little caper</p>
<p>when it comes to the microbiome,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to know whether there are great products</p>
<p>for a given indication.</p>
<p>The really good advice that I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>is try to find a study that supports</p>
<p>in a really well-designed study.</p>
<p>And this is very hard for people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t scientists to evaluate.</p>
<p>But so if you&rsquo;re experiencing a medical problem</p>
<p>or wanna consult a doctor, that might be helpful.</p>
<p>But finding a study where a specific probiotic</p>
<p>has successfully done whatever it is you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>and then sticking with that probiotic</p>
<p>is really the best recipe as a place to start</p>
<p>in this space, I think.</p>
<p>And what about prebiotics?</p>
<p>Is there a number of reasons why I can imagine</p>
<p>that prebiotics would be beneficial?</p>
<p>Which essentially, you&rsquo;re pushing the fiber system,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about today.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>The studies that have been done on prebiotics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really kind of a mixed bag of results.</p>
<p>There have been studies done with purified fibers</p>
<p>where you actually see microbiota diversity plummet</p>
<p>over the course of the study</p>
<p>because you get a very specific bloom</p>
<p>in a small number of bacteria</p>
<p>that are good at using that one type of fiber.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s at the expense of all the other microbes</p>
<p>that are in the gut.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really hard to replicate with purified fiber</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;d get, for instance, at a salad bar</p>
<p>in terms of the array of complex carbohydrates</p>
<p>that you would be exposing your microbiota to.</p>
<p>And I think the kind of broad view of this in the field</p>
<p>is that consuming a broad variety of plants</p>
<p>and all the diverse fiber that comes with that</p>
<p>is probably better in fostering diversity</p>
<p>in your microbiota than purified fibers.</p>
<p>Now, there are, again, a lot of people</p>
<p>who benefit from purified fibers,</p>
<p>either for GI motility or for other aspects</p>
<p>of GI health problems that they&rsquo;ve been experiencing.</p>
<p>Again, I think it&rsquo;s the type of thing</p>
<p>where you have to try to find the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>But there also are studies that suggest</p>
<p>that if you layer rapidly fermentable fibers</p>
<p>on top of a Western diet,</p>
<p>you actually can result in weird metabolism</p>
<p>happening in your liver</p>
<p>because you have this incredibly rapid fermentation of fiber</p>
<p>along with a lot of fat coming into the system.</p>
<p>At least, that&rsquo;s the theory.</p>
<p>And in a mouse study that was published a few years ago,</p>
<p>they actually see that a subset of the mice</p>
<p>develop hepatocellular carcinoma</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re fed a high-dose prebiotic liver cancer</p>
<p>on top of a Western diet.</p>
<p>So whether that&rsquo;s representative of human biology,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But purified fibers are definitely very different,</p>
<p>both in terms of the diversity of structures,</p>
<p>but also in terms of how rapidly</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fermented in the gut.</p>
<p>Because if you are eating plants,</p>
<p>the complex structures there really slow the microbes down</p>
<p>in terms of fermentation,</p>
<p>and you end up with a slow rate of fermentation</p>
<p>over the length of your colon,</p>
<p>as opposed to this big burst of fermentation</p>
<p>that can happen if you eat something</p>
<p>that is highly soluble and easily accessed by the microbes.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So I guess, is it fair to come back to this idea,</p>
<p>trying to avoid processed foods,</p>
<p>the highly palatable foods,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all sometimes super highly palatable foods,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now called that are packed</p>
<p>with hidden sugars emulsifiers.</p>
<p>So it sounds like some fiber is good.</p>
<p>And despite the outcome of the study,</p>
<p>you identified that if you have the appropriate microbiota,</p>
<p>then you will background,</p>
<p>then one will respond even better to the fiber,</p>
<p>maybe a longer ramp up phase for those folks.</p>
<p>And then the fermented foods,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t do both.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ve talked about before,</p>
<p>a lot of fermented foods have fiber,</p>
<p>so you can kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And it could be that the diversity increase</p>
<p>that we saw in the high fermented food group</p>
<p>could be something that would aid the high fiber group.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re planning another study coming up</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re doing high fiber, high fermented food,</p>
<p>and then fiber plus fermented food,</p>
<p>just to see if there&rsquo;s a synergistic effect there.</p>
<p>Great, I want to enroll.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Although I guess I&rsquo;m biased</p>
<p>because I sort of know where you&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>well, is it blood draws</p>
<p>that you use to measure the inflammatome?</p>
<p>Exactly, so we do blood draws like every two weeks.</p>
<p>Blood draws don&rsquo;t lie, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve covered a tremendous amount of information</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful.</p>
<p>This was a area of biology that,</p>
<p>despite having learned a lot about through papers</p>
<p>and going to talks and reading articles in the media,</p>
<p>has remained somewhat mysterious to me until today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given us a very vivid picture</p>
<p>of how this system works.</p>
<p>Where can people find out more</p>
<p>about the work that you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>We can certainly provide links</p>
<p>and you and your wife who co-run your lab,</p>
<p>you have a book on this topic.</p>
<p>So could you tell us about the book</p>
<p>where we can learn more about the Sonnenberg Lab</p>
<p>and the work that you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Maybe people will even try and enroll</p>
<p>in some of these studies.</p>
<p>Yeah, fantastic.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be great if we could get people to enroll.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always looking for willing participants.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Erica, my wife, and I wrote a book</p>
<p>called The Good Gut and that really was a response</p>
<p>to how we were changing our lives</p>
<p>in response to being in the field,</p>
<p>being very familiar with the research,</p>
<p>seeing that a lot of our friends that weren&rsquo;t studying</p>
<p>the gut microbiome, but were very well-informed,</p>
<p>many of them scientists,</p>
<p>were not doing the same things we were doing.</p>
<p>And it was very clear that it was just</p>
<p>the lack of information funneling out of the field</p>
<p>to other people.</p>
<p>And so we wanted to make that accessible</p>
<p>to people who are not microbiome scientists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a really interesting story.</p>
<p>We were at a conference site</p>
<p>that just has scientific conferences all summer long,</p>
<p>week after week after week, different fields.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s people that work there</p>
<p>that are just dealing with these new groups</p>
<p>coming in week after week.</p>
<p>And the week we were there for a microbiome conference,</p>
<p>people that work in the dining commons came up to us</p>
<p>and they said, what group is this?</p>
<p>This is weird.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, what&rsquo;s weird?</p>
<p>And they said, we can&rsquo;t keep the salad bar stocked.</p>
<p>And it was just, it was very clear</p>
<p>that nobody was doing what we were doing</p>
<p>until we&rsquo;d go to a microbiome conference</p>
<p>and then everybody was doing the same stuff</p>
<p>that we were doing.</p>
<p>And so anyway, we wrote this book</p>
<p>to talk about our personal journey</p>
<p>and kind of the science in the field.</p>
<p>And yeah, just to lay a foundation for people</p>
<p>if they wanna start thinking about these changes.</p>
<p>And then in terms of kind of connecting with our research,</p>
<p>certainly there&rsquo;s the Center for Human Microbiome Studies</p>
<p>at Stanford, which is kind of our home base</p>
<p>for doing a lot of these dietary interventions.</p>
<p>We list the studies there,</p>
<p>give more information on what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And then we have a lab website too,</p>
<p>that people can go to and read more about our research.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re always looking for participants for our studies.</p>
<p>Great, well, we will provide links to all of those sources.</p>
<p>And I just wanna say thank you so much</p>
<p>for sharing with us your knowledge</p>
<p>for the incredible work that you and Erica,</p>
<p>your wife and Chris do and are continuing to do.</p>
<p>I think this is an area that, you know,</p>
<p>when I started my training,</p>
<p>I heard a little bit about microbiota</p>
<p>and I always just thought those are people</p>
<p>that work on infectious disease and like all the bad stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting and really important</p>
<p>that people realize that we&rsquo;re carrying</p>
<p>all this vital cargo and we need to take care of the cargo</p>
<p>so it can take care of us.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for your time and for the work you do.</p>
<p>And I hope we can do it again.</p>
<p>Thanks, Andrew.</p>
<p>This was a great conversation.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
