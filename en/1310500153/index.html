    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Michael Malice, his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an anarchist, political thinker, podcaster, and author.</p>
<p>He wrote Dear Reader, which is a book on North Korea, and The New Right, a book on the various</p>
<p>ideological movements at the fringe of American politics.</p>
<p>He hosts a podcast called You&rsquo;re Welcome, spelled Y O U R, and in general, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of live shows on YouTube that are at times profoundly absurd, and at other times</p>
<p>absurdly profound, and always full of humor and wisdom.</p>
<p>He is the Joker to my Batman, and the Caviar to my Vodka.</p>
<p>His masterful dance between dark humor and difficult, even dangerous ideas, challenges</p>
<p>me to think deeply about this world, and when that fails, at least smile and have a good</p>
<p>laugh at the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>This episode has much of that.</p>
<p>His outfit, for example, the exact inverse of mine, with a white suit and a black shirt,</p>
<p>is just one example of that, of the humor, trolling, and brilliance that is Michael Malice.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, NetSuite, Business Management Software, Athletic Greens, All</p>
<p>In One Nutrition Drink, Sun Basket, Meal Delivery Service, and Cash App.</p>
<p>So the choice is success, health, food, or money.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends, and if you wish, click the sponsor links below to get a discount</p>
<p>and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Michael is, in many ways, a man of radical ideas, but</p>
<p>also a man with kindness in his heart.</p>
<p>Those two things are great ingredients for a fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>I hope to have several such people on this podcast this upcoming year who also have radical</p>
<p>ideas about politics, science, technology, and life.</p>
<p>At times, often perhaps, I might fail at asking the challenging questions that should be asked,</p>
<p>but I will try my best to do so, and hope to keep improving every time.</p>
<p>Mostly, I come to these conversations with an open mind and with love.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that kind of approach can be taken advantage of in many ways.</p>
<p>It can be used by reporters or just people online later to highlight how or why I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ignorant or worse, I&rsquo;m generally not a good human being.</p>
<p>In the context of this, I have two options.</p>
<p>I could either be cautious and afraid, or second, be kind, thoughtful, and fearless.</p>
<p>I choose the latter.</p>
<p>Hopefully while still being open, fragile, and empathetic.</p>
<p>Again, I strive to be like the main character of The Idiot by Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my New Year&rsquo;s resolution.</p>
<p>Be kind and do difficult things.</p>
<p>Difficult conversations, difficult research projects, and difficult entrepreneurial adventures.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Michael Malice.</p>
<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stealing my bed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll kill your family.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how a knock knock joke works.</p>
<p>Knock knock, Michael.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do knock knock jokes with Russians because if we have a knock at the door, turn</p>
<p>down the TV.</p>
<p>You got to sit quiet.</p>
<p>We hope they go away.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t do that back in the motherland.</p>
<p>You know this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s triggering.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even do it now.</p>
<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>Leon.</p>
<p>Leon who?</p>
<p>Leon me when you&rsquo;re not strong, Michael.</p>
<p>Well, that will never happen.</p>
<p>I stole elegantly, eloquently that joke from you.</p>
<p>The lie detector term, that was a lie.</p>
<p>Elegantly and eloquently.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, you crossed it out on a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>The reason I bring it up is because you had the guts, the brilliance to do a knock knock</p>
<p>joke.</p>
<p>Not once, but three times with Alex Jones.</p>
<p>I think it was like six.</p>
<p>I had a runner.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Maybe they started to sort of melt together in this beautiful art form that you&rsquo;ve created,</p>
<p>which is like these kind, loving knock knock jokes with Alex Jones.</p>
<p>So you got the chance to meet him and talk to him twice with Tim Pool in a long form</p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>What was it like talking to Alex Jones, both on the deep philosophical intellectual level</p>
<p>and staring the man in his eyes and doing a knock knock joke about Olive knock knock.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>Olive.</p>
<p>I love you, Alex.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot to explain.</p>
<p>Where do you start?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on his show Infowars a few times when I was researching my book, Then You Write.</p>
<p>So I had had conversations with him before.</p>
<p>One of the things that I appreciate about Alex is he is a lot more self aware than people</p>
<p>think and has a good sense of humor.</p>
<p>And I also like a good twist ending.</p>
<p>So if you set people up and all these jokes are these kind of vapid, you know, all of</p>
<p>you jokes and the last one&rsquo;s about building seven, they&rsquo;re not going to see that one coming</p>
<p>nor will he see that one coming.</p>
<p>I even had another one about Sandy Hook, which I didn&rsquo;t do on the air because he was being</p>
<p>like a good sport, but that was the dagger that was kind of behind my back if necessary.</p>
<p>But it was a good mechanism toward I like it when things work on several levels.</p>
<p>It was also a good mechanism to keep kind of the conversation guarded and this every</p>
<p>so often, this is kind of hitting the control, alt, delete and bring it down to a certain</p>
<p>point of calmness.</p>
<p>What about the love thing?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re saying that that was a buildup to the dagger, but it was also somehow really</p>
<p>refreshing to get that little jolt, like that pause.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get that in conversations often.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Rogan and he&rsquo;ll have a three hour conversation, but at some point</p>
<p>just pause and be like, I love you, man.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s in the cheesiest way possible because that seems to be, it somehow hits the hardest</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know you didn&rsquo;t intend it that way, but with Alex Jones to sit there and to say,</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>That was like, I just haven&rsquo;t never heard that before.</p>
<p>And so it struck me as like, not just funny for what you&rsquo;re doing, but just like, whoa,</p>
<p>we just took, cause conversations are all about like this ranting, especially with Alex</p>
<p>Jones, just like ranting about this or that, this part of the world, like, can you believe</p>
<p>this shit?</p>
<p>That kind of thing.</p>
<p>But like to pause and be like, this is awesome.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you felt that way, but.</p>
<p>Oh, I definitely felt that way.</p>
<p>So it was actually very fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you the backstory of how that happened.</p>
<p>It was silly cause Tim calls me up and there&rsquo;s this expression in marketing, don&rsquo;t go past</p>
<p>the sale.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna buy someone a car and like, it&rsquo;s got this feature, this feature and that feature.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to buy the car.</p>
<p>If you keep talking, you can only make them lose the sale.</p>
<p>You just get them to sign and get, get out of Dodge.</p>
<p>So Tim calls me up and he goes, okay, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>This is top secret.</p>
<p>Alex is going to be on the show.</p>
<p>We want you on as well.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never said yes to anything as quickly in my life.</p>
<p>And then he keeps talking and I&rsquo;m like, Tim, this, you don&rsquo;t have to sell it.</p>
<p>I interrupted him.</p>
<p>I go, you don&rsquo;t have to sell it.</p>
<p>Why you, by the way?</p>
<p>I think because I am kind of an agent of chaos and Alex is in his own way, an agent of chaos.</p>
<p>And what is, provides an opportunity in this kind of news media space that you and I travel</p>
<p>in, it&rsquo;s the kind of things where none of us three, you know, as we said on the show,</p>
<p>knew what it would be like.</p>
<p>If you, you know, to certain, within certain parameters, what, you know, Megyn Kelly or</p>
<p>Wolf Blitzer or any of these corporate figures are going to be like in a conversation to</p>
<p>some extent, none of us had any idea.</p>
<p>I knew they didn&rsquo;t know I was bringing in knocking up jokes.</p>
<p>So that was kind of what was so exciting.</p>
<p>I said at one point, I&rsquo;m kind of envious of the audience because this is, there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>exciting things that are happening and that the internet and podcasting provides people</p>
<p>an opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That, that was the greatest pairing with Alex Jones that I&rsquo;ve ever seen by far.</p>
<p>So like, so I immediately knew now this isn&rsquo;t a knock on Tim, but I don&rsquo;t even know if Tim</p>
<p>was prepared.</p>
<p>Tim was not prepared.</p>
<p>For this.</p>
<p>How could he be prepared?</p>
<p>Well, so I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if Tim is used to that.</p>
<p>I think Joe Rogan is more equipped, prepared for the chaos, just the years he&rsquo;s been in</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Like I immediately thought this is the right pairing for Joe Rogan because Alex Jones has</p>
<p>been on Joe Rogan a few times, three times.</p>
<p>My favorite so far was with Tim Dillon, but Tim was clearly, Tim Dillon was also kind</p>
<p>of a genius in his own right, but he was kind of a fan and he was stepping away.</p>
<p>He was almost like in awe of Alex Jones where you were both, you were in awe of the experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being created and at the same time fearlessly just trolling the situation.</p>
<p>I mean, to do a knock, knock joke, to stop, I mean, that just shows that you&rsquo;re in control</p>
<p>of the experience.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re like riding the experience.</p>
<p>That immediately was like, this needs to be on Rogan.</p>
<p>So I hope that happens as well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on your own, of course, on Rogan, but just you, that&rsquo;s an experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, whatever, this gotta be a good name for it.</p>
<p>Like Jimi Hendrix Experience, there&rsquo;s the Michael and Alex.</p>
<p>Because that was a band.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know how many years you can restart the experience.</p>
<p>Because I feel sorry to interrupt you, I feel a very big responsibility, especially in 2020</p>
<p>to provide fun and something cool and something unique that hasn&rsquo;t been done before for the</p>
<p>audience.</p>
<p>I think this has been a very rough year on our audiences psychologically and in other</p>
<p>aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>So I feel if I&rsquo;m going to be there, I&rsquo;m going to put on a show and it&rsquo;s also going to be</p>
<p>great because it also alienates the people you don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of people who sit there and be like, oh, he&rsquo;s telling knock, people who</p>
<p>are too cool for school, where they&rsquo;re like, oh, he&rsquo;s telling knock, knock jokes.</p>
<p>This is stupid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, good.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with having eaten cotton candy or doing a puzzle with a kid or with</p>
<p>that by yourself, that&rsquo;s on you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something very, something I think is the enemy is cynicism and this idea that</p>
<p>like, oh, this is too silly and we need that kind of childlike aspect in our lives.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s something we could use more of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much an aspect of our media culture that to kind of have be condemnatory about</p>
<p>that or to do it in a certain very corporate fake way.</p>
<p>So it is something I encourage a lot, something I enjoy doing.</p>
<p>And again, like with the first time I was on Tim, I had a propeller beanie on, you know,</p>
<p>with the motorized and a lot of people were like, I can&rsquo;t take anyone seriously who dresses</p>
<p>like this.</p>
<p>I go, good.</p>
<p>If you judge someone&rsquo;s ideas by how they appear instead of the ideas themselves, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>someone I want on my team.</p>
<p>Are we going to address the outfit you&rsquo;re wearing?</p>
<p>We can address it, sure.</p>
<p>You know, for those who are colorblind, Michael&rsquo;s wearing the, or just listening to this, Michael&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wearing the exact opposite, the universe from another dimension outfit, which is a white</p>
<p>suit and black shirt.</p>
<p>So genius.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>You just see the next two looks I&rsquo;ve planned.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>Well, obviously this relationship&rsquo;s going to end today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put them on Insta.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is there some deep philosophy to the humor?</p>
<p>Is this goes to our trolling discussion?</p>
<p>Is there some, is there like chapters to this genius or is this just what makes you smile</p>
<p>in the morning?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think you&rsquo;re honestly, in this case, using the word genius a little</p>
<p>loosely.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is particularly genius, but I do think it is fun.</p>
<p>It is exuberant.</p>
<p>It is joyous.</p>
<p>I think the bigger my audience has gotten and the more I actually communicate with,</p>
<p>you know, fans, I do feel it kind of kicks in these paternal maternal instincts, which</p>
<p>is very, very odd.</p>
<p>I did not expect to have them.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the dad?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the dad and the mom.</p>
<p>I remember, and it may have been similar for you, I&rsquo;m curious to hear it.</p>
<p>For young, smart, like ambitious men, like 24 to 27 for me was a very rough period because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the window where a lot of people get married and they kind of check out.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re very much kind of finding your own road, you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s in a position to really guide you or help you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very tough window.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m finding now is having these kids who are in that position, but now instead</p>
<p>of them stumbling along, for some of them, I&rsquo;m the one who could be like, no, no, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everybody else.</p>
<p>And to be able to give them that semblance of feeling seen, to use a cliched expression,</p>
<p>to feel normal and that, no, no, you&rsquo;re the heroes here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the background noise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really very flattering and humbling to be in that position.</p>
<p>You have many minds, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the thoughtful kind, Michael, there&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to burn down the powerful.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to have this just lighthearted trolling of the world, which</p>
<p>and which of those are most important to the 27 demographic?</p>
<p>I think it is the combination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re making a meal, chicken Kiev, you need the chicken, you need the ham,</p>
<p>you need the butter sauce.</p>
<p>Because I think people, when you&rsquo;re young, you need to see someone who&rsquo;s fought the fight</p>
<p>for you and who&rsquo;s won.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very easy to be defeatist.</p>
<p>So this is what winning looks like.</p>
<p>No, this is not.</p>
<p>This is most assuredly what winning does not look like.</p>
<p>But in my normal clothes, a little bit more.</p>
<p>This is a good time to mention that clothes wise, you&rsquo;re wearing sheath underwear.</p>
<p>And people should buy sheath underwear.</p>
<p>Use code Malice20.</p>
<p>If you go to sheathunderwear.com, use promo code Malice20.</p>
<p>What I love about why I&rsquo;m glad to promote the product and wear it, it&rsquo;s the most comfortable</p>
<p>underwear I&rsquo;ve ever worn.</p>
<p>And you have a separate pouch for both parts of your genitals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought there was like a punchline coming.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a very nice aspect of the product.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I think what here&rsquo;s something else just goes back to what we&rsquo;re just talking about.</p>
<p>There are so many and this is going to segue into this.</p>
<p>There are so many small companies who&rsquo;ve been devastated this year.</p>
<p>We have not seen a sustained attack on mom and pop shops like we&rsquo;ve seen in 2020, who</p>
<p>are innovators and making something happen.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re just like one dude who&rsquo;s producing a product, they&rsquo;re a sponsor of mine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to, first of all, it&rsquo;s funny that I&rsquo;m pitching underwear, but it&rsquo;s also something</p>
<p>I enjoy.</p>
<p>And also you said small business.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s microscopic, like a thimble.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t a sponsor of mine, but this is a good segue.</p>
<p>So this is, Russians, we celebrate New Year&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Novomgorodom.</p>
<p>We have Dmitry, he comes down, puts a present under your pillow.</p>
<p>So this is a company called J.L. Lawson.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a fan of yours.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a metal worker.</p>
<p>And he said, can I give you something to give to Lex?</p>
<p>I have one of his worry coins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a sponsor.</p>
<p>This is not, I&rsquo;m not getting paid for this.</p>
<p>So what a worry coin is, I carry it around in my butt.</p>
<p>If you have raw denim, it&rsquo;s great because it brings you fades.</p>
<p>So you carry it around with you all the time.</p>
<p>It says worrying is like paying a debt you don&rsquo;t owe, right?</p>
<p>And I carry this around and allow it to spend like a year.</p>
<p>Next time you&rsquo;re worrying, and this is good advice if you don&rsquo;t have a worry coin.</p>
<p>Go think about 10 years ago and what you were worried about then.</p>
<p>And then think about, did any of those things pan out?</p>
<p>And some of them did, but you were able to handle it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good way to maintain perspective.</p>
<p>So J.L. Lawson is the company.</p>
<p>He sent me this present.</p>
<p>I said, let me give it to Lex on air.</p>
<p>So enjoy.</p>
<p>So I have to open it up now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>J.L. Lawson and co.</p>
<p>Two Lex from Anthony.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I said, make something mathematical for Lex.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in there?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And it got through his TSA.</p>
<p>Could be a bomb.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>Just like this episode.</p>
<p>Make sure you unwrap it close to the mic because it drives you for crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the best part.</p>
<p>Is this what an unboxing video looks like?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>This conversation is going to be a big hit on the internet.</p>
<p>With the unboxing community.</p>
<p>I need to have an excited look on my face to make sure that the reaction video, it should</p>
<p>be an unboxing and a reaction video.</p>
<p>Lex Freeman reacts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a series of boxes.</p>
<p>Lex big fan since hearing you on Rogan months ago.</p>
<p>Most of your guests are over my head, but still enjoyable.</p>
<p>Like this episode, Michael was kind enough to want to share my work with you.</p>
<p>Keep doing what you do.</p>
<p>Anthony Lawson.</p>
<p>Thanks Anthony.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot in there.</p>
<p>What is in there?</p>
<p>Give me some.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll open some.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Show it to the camera and then make sure you look excited or not or disappointed.</p>
<p>No, this is cool.</p>
<p>This is a worry coin.</p>
<p>Like I was showing you.</p>
<p>So you hold it in your hand and when you can do this with your thumb, if people are, have</p>
<p>anxiety or whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a lot of cool stuff in here.</p>
<p>Fibonacci coin.</p>
<p>Oh, see, yeah, that&rsquo;s the math stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really awesome.</p>
<p>This is really cool.</p>
<p>Wait, you got a big one laying there too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you last time you offended me saying I don&rsquo;t have humor.</p>
<p>The spin tray micro brass and copper bronze.</p>
<p>By the way, the packaging is epic.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s his top.</p>
<p>He makes tops.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, you spin it in there and it&rsquo;s the two different bronze and copper.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s the only one who makes these machined tops and then they sit in here, I</p>
<p>guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you could spin them in that section.</p>
<p>Got it, cool.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the where&rsquo;s the worry thing?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the worry coin.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wasn&rsquo;t listening.</p>
<p>What were you worried about 10 years ago?</p>
<p>10 years ago, 2010.</p>
<p>What would I have been worried about then?</p>
<p>The government?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a worry.</p>
<p>I think&hellip;</p>
<p>What was the North Korea book?</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>That came out in 2014.</p>
<p>I went there in 2012, came out in January 2014.</p>
<p>It still pays my rent with the royalties.</p>
<p>The North Korea book?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, this is why it&rsquo;s so much better.</p>
<p>I gotta talk to you about self publishing because you brought that up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing the next books also going to be self published.</p>
<p>Can we talk about self publishing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the whole idea of publishing?</p>
<p>Like having a publisher and an agent because there&rsquo;s a bunch of people have been reaching</p>
<p>out to me trying to get me to write a book, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because people who are brilliant folks like you, like Jordan Peterson, that I think have</p>
<p>a lot of knowledge to share with the world.</p>
<p>I think what I feel I can contribute to the world in terms of impact is to build something.</p>
<p>Meaning like engineering stuff.</p>
<p>Like a book&hellip;</p>
<p>A book has to be engineered and I&rsquo;m not using that loosely.</p>
<p>You have to engineer a book.</p>
<p>No, for sure.</p>
<p>What I mean is like literally a product with programming and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I want to build a company.</p>
<p>I want to&hellip;</p>
<p>Because I have a few ideas that I feel I&rsquo;m equipped and it has to do with your intuition</p>
<p>about the way you can build a better world.</p>
<p>You individually.</p>
<p>Like, what can you add to the world that&rsquo;s a positive thing?</p>
<p>And for me, I feel like the maximal thing I can add to the world is at least to attempt</p>
<p>to build products that would add more love in the world.</p>
<p>And like, so I want to focus on that.</p>
<p>The danger of the book for me, or any kind of writing, and even this podcast is a little</p>
<p>bit dangerous for me, is like, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it takes you into this place where you start thinking about the world.</p>
<p>You start enjoying and playing with ideas.</p>
<p>You start&hellip;</p>
<p>And like, just your book on a Dear Reader, but also the new write.</p>
<p>Like clearly you and I probably think similarly in the sense that you did a lot of work.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This next book is killing me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, often it&rsquo;s clear, like on your YouTube channel, which I&rsquo;m a fan of,</p>
<p>you often, it just comes out like you mentioned all of these books that you&rsquo;re reading.</p>
<p>It just comes through you that you&rsquo;re suffering through this and it changes you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clear that you&rsquo;re thinking deeply about the world because of this book.</p>
<p>And I feel like if you do that, that&rsquo;s like when I first came to this country, I read</p>
<p>the book The Giver.</p>
<p>I need to read it again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the red pill thing is it changes you in where you can never be the same person</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I feel about a book in that same way.</p>
<p>The moment you write a book, of course it depends on the book.</p>
<p>I could also just write like in my field, a very technical book.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t really change you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like sharing information.</p>
<p>But like something where you&rsquo;re like, how do I think about this world?</p>
<p>Can you just leave that behind you?</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Dude, it&rsquo;s being pregnant.</p>
<p>It never escapes your brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It does seem to change you.</p>
<p>The reason I bring that up is because there&rsquo;s this whole industry of people that seem to</p>
<p>not really contribute much to the publication process, but they make themselves seem necessary</p>
<p>for like, if you want to be in the New York Times bestseller list kind of thing, but also</p>
<p>just being like reputable, which I&rsquo;m allergic to that whole concept.</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s possible to be on the New York Times bestseller list and be a reputable</p>
<p>author and still be self published?</p>
<p>Not what you would want to do.</p>
<p>Like people like Mark Sisson, I think is his name.</p>
<p>He wrote like the Primal Blueprints.</p>
<p>So like if I&rsquo;m getting the names correct, he&rsquo;s the first paleo guy, right?</p>
<p>So he self published it.</p>
<p>It sold gangbusters.</p>
<p>But that would be on their health chart, I believe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little bit of a different situation.</p>
<p>You would be reaching much more for the mainstream.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be giving up a lot if you go through a publisher, especially financially.</p>
<p>But yeah, you are not going to have the cred because the publishing is a cartel.</p>
<p>The New York Times is part of this cartel.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t publish within this cartel, they will do what they can, as any cartel</p>
<p>has to, by necessity of being cartel, to pretend you don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So I was, I think, the first one to have an hour on BookTV for Dear Reader because that</p>
<p>was a Kickstarter book.</p>
<p>But this is something that people would have to be aware of.</p>
<p>So you would be giving up a lot.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;d also be giving a lot to work with a publisher because you&rsquo;re losing like a year</p>
<p>and a half of your life because they&rsquo;re glacial and they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s my problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the money.</p>
<p>I mean, the money is whatever percent they take, 10, 20, 30, 50%.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking a huge chunk.</p>
<p>So if I sell a book through St. Martin&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a dollar.</p>
<p>If I sell a book through Amazon, which is Dear Reader, that&rsquo;s $6.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what, 87%, it&rsquo;s something crazy.</p>
<p>But for me, what bothers me isn&rsquo;t the money that, for me personally, for me, what bothers</p>
<p>me is incompetence.</p>
<p>Like whenever I go to the DMV or something like that.</p>
<p>Can I interrupt you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk incompetence.</p>
<p>When a new write comes out last year, I get on Rogan, get on Ruben.</p>
<p>I call them and I said, I got on these shows.</p>
<p>Is there money in the budget for travel?</p>
<p>And they say, we don&rsquo;t have that budget.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>By the way, you got on those shows with no help from them.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s not even a question.</p>
<p>The reason they would want you to do a book is because they know you could get&hellip;</p>
<p>The only reason people get book deals nowadays, literally, is because they know that person</p>
<p>can market their own book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way.</p>
<p>And I got on Ruben, I got on Rogan, and they go and have the money for the budget for travel,</p>
<p>which is fair.</p>
<p>They can do Skype.</p>
<p>They told me this in writing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>And they can financially cover Skype.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s like, hey Joe, yeah, we don&rsquo;t have the budget, but you&rsquo;re going to do Skype.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>There is, another friend of mine was on a show on CNBC with Nassim Taleb, and they said</p>
<p>Nassim wants a copy of the book.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh yeah, it&rsquo;s like four o clock on Friday, so we&rsquo;re closed.</p>
<p>So, and he&rsquo;s like, he went there, picked it up, and walked it the two blocks.</p>
<p>So there is, it&rsquo;s almost cartoonish, and it&rsquo;s not incompetence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s past that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something almost, you can&rsquo;t really believe that, I&rsquo;ve had two friends who have been literally</p>
<p>rendered suicidal because this was such a huge opportunity for them.</p>
<p>And it was like watching their kid get beaten in front of them, and I had to talk them off</p>
<p>the ledge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, people do not appreciate how bad, here&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>The apathy of bureaucracy, something like that.</p>
<p>I did this book, Concierge Confidential.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a typo in the first chapter, it ends with, I&rsquo;m about to, TOO, they didn&rsquo;t fix it</p>
<p>for the paperback.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, well, okay, yeah, great book by the way, it got, NPR gave it one of the</p>
<p>books of the year, so that was good.</p>
<p>So why participate in this?</p>
<p>Because otherwise, New York Times is going to pretend you don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Getting booked on some shows might be more difficult.</p>
<p>Although I think that&rsquo;s collapsing in real time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get reviewed necessarily on places like PW, or some others.</p>
<p>So the new book you&rsquo;re working on, do you have a title yet?</p>
<p>The White Pill.</p>
<p>Are you self publishing that?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the thinking behind that?</p>
<p>Just because you already have a huge following and a big platform and&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s six times the cash.</p>
<p>If I finish the book in December, I could have it out in February.</p>
<p>If I finish the book in December with the publisher, it&rsquo;s going to be out in December</p>
<p>at the earliest, 2021.</p>
<p>Why am I giving up 10 months of my life?</p>
<p>Well, this is the big one.</p>
<p>Do you have any leverage?</p>
<p>Like do authors have leverage to say, F you?</p>
<p>Can you just say, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Meaning like, I want to release this book in two months.</p>
<p>Oh no, no.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ll have a contract and then your agent can fight it, but they don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>capacity to rush things through.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess if the, cause I&rsquo;ve heard like big authors, I don&rsquo;t know, Sam Harris, all those</p>
<p>folks talk about like, they&rsquo;ve accepted it actually.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve accepted it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, yeah, it takes a long time to&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not accepting it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re kind of implying that a human being like me should, like&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying these are your options.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I just, I just hate it.</p>
<p>I hate the waiting because it&rsquo;s incompetence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the wait.</p>
<p>If I knew it wasn&rsquo;t, you know, if it was the kind of people that are up at 2 a.m. at night</p>
<p>on a Friday and they love what you&rsquo;re doing and they&rsquo;re helping create something special.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sense I get with some of the Netflix folks, for example, that work with people.</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t know anything about this world, but you get like Netflix folks who, who help</p>
<p>with shows.</p>
<p>You could tell that they&rsquo;re obsessed with those shows.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get that publishing.</p>
<p>If you hand, like I handed the book in, I think it was July, I didn&rsquo;t hear anything from</p>
<p>my editor until December.</p>
<p>Well, can we actually talk about the suffering, the darkest parts of writing a book?</p>
<p>So the, let&rsquo;s go to the full Michael Malice, Stephen King mode of what are the darkest</p>
<p>moments of writing this book and what is it maybe start, the white pill?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hope and what are your darkest moments around writing this book?</p>
<p>So people are familiar with the red pill and the blue pill, the red, they&rsquo;re from the Matrix.</p>
<p>The red pill is the idea that what is presented as fact by the corporate press entertainment</p>
<p>industry is in fact a carefully constructed narrative designed to keep some very unpleasant</p>
<p>people in power and everyone else under control.</p>
<p>And I guess one of my expressions is you take one red pill, not the whole bottle because</p>
<p>at a certain point you think everything&rsquo;s lie and then you&rsquo;re kind of no capacity for</p>
<p>distinguishing truths.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re full of good one liners.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m full of something that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>And what I saw in this space is a lot of these red pill people got very disheartened and</p>
<p>cynical.</p>
<p>And one of my big heroes is Albert Camus and he said the worst thing is cynicism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something called the black pill, which is the idea that, you know, it&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re waiting for the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hopeless.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see it that way at all.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, all right, I have to address this.</p>
<p>And not just with some kind of cheerleading, everything&rsquo;s going to be great guys.</p>
<p>Here is why I am positive.</p>
<p>And not that I&rsquo;m positive the good guys are going to win, but I&rsquo;m positive that good guys</p>
<p>can win.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all you need.</p>
<p>Because if your God forbid kid is kidnapped and there&rsquo;s a 10% chance that you can save</p>
<p>them, you&rsquo;re not going to be like, well, I don&rsquo;t like those odds.</p>
<p>This is your country.</p>
<p>This is your values.</p>
<p>This is your family.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s much more than 10%.</p>
<p>And even if you lose, you will take pride in that you did everything in your power to</p>
<p>win.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Is there a good definition of good guys?</p>
<p>In the sense that.</p>
<p>The ones who wear white.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s layers to this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like modern day Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Is there a danger in thinking Adolf Hitler was probably pretty confident that he led</p>
<p>a group of good guys?</p>
<p>Listen, if Hitler did anything wrong, why isn&rsquo;t he in jail?</p>
<p>My Czech friend thought of that joke.</p>
<p>He actually says in his accent, he goes, if Hitler&rsquo;s so bad, why isn&rsquo;t he in the jail?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably still alive.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And look, yeah.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Two of the three people listening to this are very upset right now.</p>
<p>What were you even talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, how do you, how do you know the, what is good?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of standards of good, but if you&rsquo;re for me to be a good guy is if you want</p>
<p>to leave the world a little bit better than you found it, that to me is the definition</p>
<p>of a good guy.</p>
<p>And I think there are many people that that&rsquo;s not their motivation at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about your motivation.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s also about if your motivation is at all correlated to reality.</p>
<p>No one thinks we&rsquo;re the bad guys.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>But are you taking steps to check your motivations and also take a certain amount of humility</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re going to start interfering with other people&rsquo;s lives, you really better</p>
<p>be sure you know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>The control of others, if you do have centralized control or then you kind of, you become a</p>
<p>leader of a group, you better know, you better do so humbly and cautiously.</p>
<p>And also have steam valves, right?</p>
<p>So if in case things go wrong, let&rsquo;s have, I&rsquo;m sure this is a lot happening with AI,</p>
<p>whatever work with computers, like, okay, if something goes wrong here, how do we have</p>
<p>a workaround to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t cause everything to collapse?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The going wrong thing.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole, the feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I wonder if people in Congress think that things are really wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working for them.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;d like to believe that the people that at least when they got into politics</p>
<p>actually wanted, some of it is ego, but some of it is like wanting to be the kind of person</p>
<p>that builds a better world.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I also think it&rsquo;s diverse.</p>
<p>Some of who are going to have different motivations than others.</p>
<p>But like once you&rsquo;re in the system and trying to build a better world, how do you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not working?</p>
<p>Like, how do you take the basic feedback mechanisms and like, and actually productively change?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what it means to be a good guy is like, hmm, something is wrong here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I like the Elon Musk, like think from first principles, like, wait, wait,</p>
<p>wait.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask the big question.</p>
<p>Like, can this be, one, is this working at all?</p>
<p>Like the way we&rsquo;re solving this particular problem of government, is this working at</p>
<p>all?</p>
<p>And then like stepping away and saying like, as opposed to modifying this bill or that</p>
<p>bill or like this little strategy, like increase the tax by this much or decrease the tax by</p>
<p>this much, like, why do we have a democracy at all?</p>
<p>Or why do we have any kind of representative democracy?</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t it be a pure democracy?</p>
<p>Or why do we have states, like representation of states and federal government and so on?</p>
<p>Why do we have this kind of separation of powers?</p>
<p>Is this different?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have term limits or not like big things?</p>
<p>Like how do you actually make that happen?</p>
<p>And is that what it means to be a good guy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like taking big revolutionary steps as opposed to incremental steps.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know that you could be a politician to be a good guy, to be honest.</p>
<p>And let me give you a counter example of someone who you could tell is not being a good guy.</p>
<p>Joe Biden said he regards the Iraq wars a mistake.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You and I have made mistakes in our lives, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>None of our mistakes have caused tens of thousands of people to die.</p>
<p>If I were a chef, let&rsquo;s take it out of politics.</p>
<p>And in my restaurant, somehow, accidentally, someone ate something and they died.</p>
<p>A, I would feel horrible.</p>
<p>But more importantly, I would be like, we need to look through the system and figure</p>
<p>out how it got to the point where someone lost their life.</p>
<p>Because that can never happen again.</p>
<p>And we need to figure out step by step.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a gun person, but there&rsquo;s like this checklist of like, if you&rsquo;re holding a gun,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s five things to do.</p>
<p>And if you get too wrong, it&rsquo;s like assume every gun is loaded, only pointed at something</p>
<p>that you want to kill.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like three other things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like to make sure that nothing goes wrong.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m that chef, and I would have to not only feel guilt, but take preventative action</p>
<p>to make sure this has no possibility of happening again.</p>
<p>If you look at the staff he&rsquo;s putting in, it&rsquo;s the same warmongers that would have advised</p>
<p>him to get into the Iraq war on the first time.</p>
<p>That is to me is not a good guy.</p>
<p>That to me is someone who does not feel remorse for their responsibility in killing not only</p>
<p>many Americans, but some of us think that, you know, dead Iraqis isn&rsquo;t necessarily ideal</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk a bit about war.</p>
<p>Maybe you can also correct me on something.</p>
<p>The first time I found myself into Barack Obama was, I don&rsquo;t know how many years ago</p>
<p>this was, but when I maybe heard a speech of his about him speaking out against the</p>
<p>war.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And him, I think it&rsquo;s on record saying he was against the war before it was happening.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t in Senate at the time, so it was very easy for him to say this.</p>
<p>But see, like people say that, people say that.</p>
<p>People say like it was easy and it was some people say it&rsquo;s like strategically the wise</p>
<p>thing to do given some kind of calculus, whatever.</p>
<p>But I, to this day give him, that&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;ve always given him props in my mind.</p>
<p>Like this is a man of character, like he makes, I also personally really value great speeches.</p>
<p>I think speeches are really important for leaders because they inspire the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of the most best things you can contribute to the world is great, like</p>
<p>through intellect, mold ideas in a way that&rsquo;s communicable to like a huge number of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s better to persuade than to force in every instance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I disagree with Chomsky said, like if you&rsquo;re, Chomsky&rsquo;s whole idea was that</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re really eloquent speaker, that means your ideas aren&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a way for him to describe like I speak in a very boring way.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a pitch for this podcast.</p>
<p>I speak boring so that the ideas are the things you value and it&rsquo;s also useful to go to sleep.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why I really liked Obama throughout his life and still do.</p>
<p>But when I first like saw this is for some reason you can disagree, I thought he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>man of character.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when most politicians, most people who are trying to calculate and rise in power,</p>
<p>I think were for the war or too afraid to be against the war.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I liked Bernie Sanders and that&rsquo;s why I liked like in the early days Obama for</p>
<p>speaking out against the war and not like in this weird activist way.</p>
<p>Not weird, but not saying I&rsquo;m an activist, but like just saying the common sense thing</p>
<p>and being brave enough to say the common sense thing without like having a big sign and saying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be the antiwar candidate or something like that, but just saying this is not a good</p>
<p>idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s for those of us who are old enough to remember, it&rsquo;s pretty despicable</p>
<p>what happened with Tulsi in 2020.</p>
<p>She was the biggest antiwar candidate and she was marginalized within her own party,</p>
<p>which I guess you can make sense.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just a congresswoman from Hawaii.</p>
<p>But the corporate press did everything in their power to diminish her and pretend she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And for those of us who remember where 12 years prior, when George W. Bush had the Republican</p>
<p>National Convention in New York and it was the biggest protest in history and the Iraq</p>
<p>war led to democratic landslides in 2006 and 2008, to have that completely not part of</p>
<p>the Democratic Party in 2020 is both shocking and reprehensible.</p>
<p>Hey, Michael, you don&rsquo;t have to say, hey, Michael, you just say knock, knock, okay.</p>
<p>What did the volcano say to his true love?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>These jokes are better when you know how to speak English.</p>
<p>It was actually in Russian, I did Google translate, okay.</p>
<p>Back to your book, In the Suffering, you somehow turned it positive.</p>
<p>And as one who&rsquo;s wearing, who&rsquo;s the representative of the black pill in this conversation, what</p>
<p>are some of the darker moments?</p>
<p>What are some of the hardest challenges of putting together this book, the white pill?</p>
<p>Content, content, content.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m having a page in about Reagan taking on Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential primaries,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to read like 20.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the thing like if there&rsquo;ll be some times I&rsquo;ll remember some quote somewhere and</p>
<p>then I have to spend an hour trying to find it because I want it to be as dense with information</p>
<p>as possible.</p>
<p>Like how do you structure the main philosophical ideas you want to convey?</p>
<p>Is that already planned out?</p>
<p>No, the book changed entirely from its conception.</p>
<p>So my buddy Ryan Holiday had a series of books, still does, where he takes the ideas of the</p>
<p>Stoics and he applies them to contemporary terms.</p>
<p>He has this whole cottage industry that he&rsquo;s doing very well with.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d asked him years ago if I could do that with Camus and he&rsquo;s like, sure, go for</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I was going to rework Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus.</p>
<p>And I read it recently, reread it, and this wasn&rsquo;t the book I remembered at all.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;m going to write the book that I remembered.</p>
<p>But the more I was writing it, one of the things I always yell at conservatives about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a long list, is they don&rsquo;t talk about the great victory of conservatism, which was</p>
<p>the winning of the Cold War without firing a shot.</p>
<p>And I said, you can&rsquo;t expect the New York Times to tell this story because the blood</p>
<p>is on their hands.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, Michael, instead of complaining about it, why don&rsquo;t you do it?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you talk?</p>
<p>That is a great example of the good guys winning over the bad guys.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s become, A, the victory is beautiful.</p>
<p>But also pointing out to people, when people are like, oh, things are worse than they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever been, they don&rsquo;t appreciate how bad things were in the 30s, what Stalin was doing overseas</p>
<p>and how people in the West were advocating to bring that here.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of pointing out how bad things were and how good they became.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to be a Republican or conservative to be delighted at the collapse of totalitarianism</p>
<p>and the peaceful liberation of half the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a picture of the good guys winning.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, how does that connect to Sisyphus and maybe to speak deeper to life and whatever</p>
<p>the hell this thing is, which is what I remember the myth of Sisyphus being about.</p>
<p>So where does the threat of Camus sort of lie in the work that you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>So the myth of Sisyphus, which I had remembered incorrectly, is actually just a five to seven</p>
<p>page coda to the whole book at the very end.</p>
<p>You only need to read that little essay called The Myth of Sisyphus.</p>
<p>The broader work is about Camus&rsquo;s concept of the absurd and the absurd man within literature.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, I don&rsquo;t really care about the character in Dostoevsky and all this other</p>
<p>stuff that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s of no relevance.</p>
<p>But the myth of Sisyphus, the myth itself, not the book or the essay of his, is this</p>
<p>Greek character and Sisyphus is forced in hell to roll a rock up a hill for eternity.</p>
<p>At the very last moment, the rock falls away.</p>
<p>And Camus&rsquo;s takeaway from the story is that we must imagine Sisyphus happy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s several interpretations of this, but one is once you accept that you are living</p>
<p>an absurdist existence, once you own your reality, it loses its bite.</p>
<p>And you can start with that as your kind of baseline.</p>
<p>And bite is suffering.</p>
<p>And hopelessness.</p>
<p>So I think when people look at how much ridiculousness is happening in America and it&rsquo;s escalating,</p>
<p>you can either think, oh, all is lost.</p>
<p>And I think you and I have lived our lives like this.</p>
<p>You can live life more like a surfer, whereas you&rsquo;re never going to control the ocean.</p>
<p>But you can sure enjoy that ride and stop.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to control the waves, yeah, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re like, all right, I&rsquo;ve got my board, I&rsquo;m going to see where this takes me.</p>
<p>Surfing from what I understand is a pretty fun activity.</p>
<p>And also sometimes dangerous, but you&rsquo;d have to ask Tulsi about that.</p>
<p>So we were offline talking about Stalin and the evils of the Soviet regime.</p>
<p>One of the things I mentioned, I watched the movie, Mr. Jones, but it&rsquo;s about the 1930s,</p>
<p>all the more the, what would you say, the torture of the Ukrainian people by Stalin.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to me that I&rsquo;d love to hear your opinion about is the role of</p>
<p>journalism in all of this and also about 1930s Germany.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the role of journalists and intellectuals in a time when trouble is brewing.</p>
<p>But it requires a really sort of brave and deep thinking to understand that trouble is</p>
<p>brewing.</p>
<p>Like if you were a journalist or if you were just like an intellectual, a thinker, but</p>
<p>also a voice in the space of public discourse, what would you do in 1930s about Stalin, about</p>
<p>how the more, and what would you do about Nazi Germany in 1937, 1938?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really funny that you asked that because currently how the book is structured,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like books often follow a three act structure, right?</p>
<p>So act three is the 80s, act one is the 30s, and act two is going to be like, all right,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s suppose you were in the 30s.</p>
<p>Are you just going to give up?</p>
<p>Are you just going to be like, well, we&rsquo;re screwed?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d be right to say things are going to be very bad for a long time.</p>
<p>Or are you going to be one of those few who are like, we&rsquo;re going to do something about</p>
<p>this and we&rsquo;re going to go down swinging.</p>
<p>There are two books I can recommend, which are just masterpieces that are written by</p>
<p>women that just are historians that are just superb.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book called Beyond Belief by Deborah Lipschdott.</p>
<p>She talks about the rise of Nazi Germany as seen through the press.</p>
<p>And what was amazing, and she does a great job empathizing with the press and understand</p>
<p>their perspective, is we remember, and Chamberlain gets a bad rap, Neville Chamberlain for kind</p>
<p>of appeasing Hitler, because not that long ago they had the Great War, they had World</p>
<p>War I, and they had the carnage that the earth had never seen before.</p>
<p>And when you had people made out of meat, meeting industrial machines, and plastic surgery</p>
<p>was invented as a consequence of this, they&rsquo;re coming back mangled and disfigured.</p>
<p>And for what?</p>
<p>And this was a world where the Kaiser was the most evil person ever lived.</p>
<p>And we all had the Western propaganda about the Hun and all the rapes and all this barbarism</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So not that long later, when you&rsquo;re hearing all this propaganda, which was factual, about</p>
<p>Hitler, it&rsquo;s like, we heard this, we heard this 20 years ago.</p>
<p>This was all lies.</p>
<p>Give us a break.</p>
<p>And she has all the quotes from the different agencies and how they addressed it.</p>
<p>Plus they had very limited information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like Nazi Germany was an open society where reporters can walk around and they were</p>
<p>under a lot of pressure as well in those areas.</p>
<p>And Hitler himself was pretty good at, he let some stuff slip, but usually he made it</p>
<p>seem like he wants peace.</p>
<p>He wants world peace.</p>
<p>This was amazing.</p>
<p>They were making the argument that because all these Jews were being beaten up on the</p>
<p>street, this proved, this was the hot take of the day, that Hitler was weak because since</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s a statesman and he can&rsquo;t control these hooligans, that shows his control and</p>
<p>power is tenuous and this is all going to go away.</p>
<p>By the way, Hitler thought that too.</p>
<p>He was kind of afraid of the branchers, whatever, he was afraid of these hooligans a little</p>
<p>bit.</p>
<p>They were useful to him, but at a certain point, yeah, they can get in the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he wanted to get control of the military, the army, their regiment.</p>
<p>If you want to take over the world, you can&rsquo;t do it with hooligans.</p>
<p>You have to do it with an actual army.</p>
<p>And then you had Kristallnacht, which was a nationwide pogrom, and then all the news</p>
<p>agencies universally were like, oh, crap, we got this wrong, and the condemnation was universal.</p>
<p>So that book traces the West&rsquo;s reaction to what&rsquo;s going on there and including the reaction</p>
<p>to the insipid Holocaust as people being, you know, what they knew, when did they know.</p>
<p>There was not ambiguity about people.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s this myth that she dispels that they didn&rsquo;t know the Holocaust was happening</p>
<p>or they didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They were aware, but they were already at war with Nazi Germany, like what literally</p>
<p>what else could they do at that point, you know, to rescue all these Jews.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a superb book.</p>
<p>And Ann Applebaum, I think the book is called Red Famine, came out fairly recently.</p>
<p>And she brings the receipts.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s a, you know, this is something I really hate with the binary thinkers, where</p>
<p>the people think, oh, you know, if you&rsquo;re a Democrat, you&rsquo;re basically a communist,</p>
<p>they call Joe Biden a Marxist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, you know, she&rsquo;s a hard lefty, she&rsquo;s, you know, has TDS.</p>
<p>But this book just systemically lays out what Stalin did.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m triggered by the binary thinkers.</p>
<p>And for those who don&rsquo;t know, TDS 0011 is a trauma derangement syndrome.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So they, you know, forced the starvation in this entire population.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only that, it&rsquo;s like they knew if you weren&rsquo;t starving by looking at you,</p>
<p>you were hiding food.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d come back to your house at night and break your fingers in the door, or take,</p>
<p>burn down your house.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re on the street without food because you lied, because this is the people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>food.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a kulak, you&rsquo;re a landowner.</p>
<p>And very quickly, a kulak, which meant like peasant landowner, became anyone who had a</p>
<p>piece of bread.</p>
<p>And this was systemic and ongoing.</p>
<p>And many people in the press did not believe it.</p>
<p>There was a British journalist, I believe, who got out of the train, Ukraine, like one</p>
<p>town earlier and walked and he described all this.</p>
<p>And he was mocked and derided.</p>
<p>And this is just anti Russian propaganda.</p>
<p>Because at the time, in the 30s, this was socialism had come to fruition.</p>
<p>This was a noble experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d seen the future and it works, as I think Sidney Webb was the guy who said that.</p>
<p>And the premise was, let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never tried something like that.</p>
<p>And they were perfectly happy to have this experiment happen overseas at the price of</p>
<p>the Russian people.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, you know what, maybe this will be paradise on earth.</p>
<p>And I address this in my book as well.</p>
<p>This superb essay, I think, by Eugene Genovese.</p>
<p>And he talks about the question.</p>
<p>The question being, what did you know?</p>
<p>And when did you know it?</p>
<p>What did you know about the concentration camps?</p>
<p>What did you know about the starvation?</p>
<p>What did you know about children being taught at school to turn in their parents for having</p>
<p>some extra bread?</p>
<p>And his conclusion is, we all knew.</p>
<p>And we all knew from the beginning, every bit of it.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Because we were more interested in promoting this ideology.</p>
<p>So when people are kind of thinking the worst thing on earth is like Robert E. Lee statue</p>
<p>being taken down to Washington, DC.</p>
<p>We were being told, and especially in a much more limited news information world where</p>
<p>now you have literally anyone can have a Twitter, but how many outlets were there, that this</p>
<p>is, we&rsquo;re backwards, they&rsquo;re the future, they&rsquo;re scientific.</p>
<p>We have the vagaries of the market, which led to the Great Depression.</p>
<p>And when you see what was being put over on the American public at the time, anyone who</p>
<p>thinks things are as bad now as they&rsquo;ve ever been is simply delusional or ignorant.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say just as a small aside, that&rsquo;s why reading, as I&rsquo;m almost done with The Rise</p>
<p>and Fall of the Third Reich, it&rsquo;s a refreshes the, resets the palette of your understanding</p>
<p>what is good and evil in the world that I think is really useful now.</p>
<p>What helps me be really positive and almost naive on Twitter and in the world is by just</p>
<p>studying history and comparing it to how amazing things are today.</p>
<p>But in that time, what would you do?</p>
<p>What does a brave mind do?</p>
<p>And not just acts of bravery, but how do you be effective in that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I often think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to be an activist in terms of just saying stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to be effective at your activism.</p>
<p>One of the big questions historians have constantly is how did this happen?</p>
<p>A, to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen again, but this is Germany.</p>
<p>This is not some kind of weirdo cult nation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very advanced, very in the land of poets and philosophers.</p>
<p>How did it get to that point that they&rsquo;re just shooting children and everyone&rsquo;s cheering</p>
<p>for this?</p>
<p>Specifically on the anti Semitism and the Holocaust.</p>
<p>But just the totalitarianism, the cult of Hitler and just this whole kind of thing.</p>
<p>This is starting to drop, but there&rsquo;s two sides.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you want to separate them.</p>
<p>One is the totalitarianism and the entirety of the Nazi regime.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the Holocaust, which is going, I would say, very specifically, as I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re about to describe, is targeting Jews very much so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you see those as two separate things.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re very interconnected.</p>
<p>But I think if you look at it, everyone thinks that they&rsquo;d be the ones putting up Anne Frank.</p>
<p>But if you look at the numbers, they&rsquo;d be the ones calling the Stasi on her or whoever</p>
<p>the people were at the time, and not the Stasi, obviously, and patting themselves on the back</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>So sorry to pause on that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really important thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to this, and you were in Germany at the time, you would have likely</p>
<p>been willing to commit or at least keep a blind eye to the violence against Jews.</p>
<p>You have to really sit with that idea that you would have been somebody who just sees</p>
<p>this and is not bothered by it, and also very likely kind of understand this as a necessary</p>
<p>evil or even a necessary good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think people think they would be the abolitionists or marching on Selma.</p>
<p>The numbers don&rsquo;t add up to that at all.</p>
<p>And I think the question would be like, what social&hellip;</p>
<p>My friend was on Tinder, my friend Matt, who&rsquo;s a great dude.</p>
<p>And the question was, what&rsquo;s the most controversial opinion you have?</p>
<p>This is New York.</p>
<p>And the girl wrote, I hate Trump.</p>
<p>And what people perceive themselves as being courageous in saying and doing, and what is</p>
<p>the actual social costs of you saying or doing this are two very disconnected things.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re also trained by corporate media to have completely vapid, uninteresting, banal</p>
<p>ideas and yet regard ourselves as revolutionaries.</p>
<p>There are people who still in New York will take pride because they have a gay friend.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, first of all, who cares?</p>
<p>But second of all, you are not a hero.</p>
<p>And that person is not your prop, by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another big problem.</p>
<p>Which is why I&rsquo;d like to give Richard Wolff a shout out for being an intellectual who</p>
<p>talks about communism.</p>
<p>I think it takes kind of a heroic intellectual right now to speak about communism seriously.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s difficult waters to tread.</p>
<p>Is that the expression?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s difficult paths to walk.</p>
<p>I love watching a robot try to use idiom in a language he doesn&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>0011.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite deeply hurt by the binary comment.</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>Your feeling has gone from one to zero.</p>
<p>What is love?</p>
<p>My buffers have overflown.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s difficult, I feel like communism is universally seen as a bad thing currently</p>
<p>in intellectual circles.</p>
<p>Or actually maybe some people disagree with that.</p>
<p>People say far left, people are trying to, there&rsquo;s some people who argue the BLM movement</p>
<p>is some kind of a Marxist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really follow the deep logic in that, whatever.</p>
<p>They said they were formed by Marxism, the founder, co founder.</p>
<p>But stating that is different than&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Marx the totalitarian, there&rsquo;s also Marx the revolutionary.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re talking more like we&rsquo;re revolutionaries, we&rsquo;re going to overthrow the status quo.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>But we can have that further discussion.</p>
<p>But I just don&rsquo;t think they speak deeply about political systems and saying communism is</p>
<p>going to be the righteous system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a deep intellectual discourse is what I mean.</p>
<p>But if you were to try to be on stage with the Jordan Peterson, to me the brave thing</p>
<p>now, it would be to argue for communism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to see.</p>
<p>Not many people do it.</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be willing to do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, first of all, I don&rsquo;t believe it, but second of all, it&rsquo;s a very difficult argument</p>
<p>to make because you will get so much fire, which is why I like Richard Wolff, he&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the people who is quite rigorously showing that there&rsquo;s some good ideas within the system</p>
<p>of communism, specifically saying that attacking more the negative sides of capitalism.</p>
<p>Just saying that capitalism potentially is more dangerous than communism.</p>
<p>I mean, I disagree with that, but I think it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>I love how something is like we&rsquo;ve got a body count of 60 million, but this everything</p>
<p>is potentially, like water can drown everyone on earth.</p>
<p>So this is incoherent.</p>
<p>Well, I think nuclear weapons are bad, but nuclear energy is good.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Well, nuclear weapons also can be good.</p>
<p>You can easily make the argument, which I don&rsquo;t know that I subscribe to, that nuclear</p>
<p>weapons prevented boots on the ground war, or it caused them to be much more contained.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also quite effective at changing the direction of an asteroid that&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>to hit earth, as I&rsquo;ve learned from a movie.</p>
<p>Armageddon.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re actually useful as Elon Musk has claimed for prior to colonizing Mars, making</p>
<p>it more habitable.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Got to do something.</p>
<p>But yes, but I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is there&rsquo;s a place for nuance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some topics so hot, like communism, where nuance is very difficult to have.</p>
<p>And I feel like with Nazi Germany, it was a similar thing at the time.</p>
<p>You want to talk about Jeanette Rankin, who was one of my favorite people.</p>
<p>So Jeanette Rankin was the first woman elected to Congress.</p>
<p>She was elected before women&rsquo;s suffrage was a constitutional amendment from Montana.</p>
<p>She was elected in 1916.</p>
<p>She was one of a handful of people to vote against the US going into the Great War, which</p>
<p>was the right call at the time.</p>
<p>She was a pacifist Republican as well, coincidentally.</p>
<p>She lost her seat, ran again in, was it 1940?</p>
<p>Got the seat again, and was the only person to vote against getting into World War II.</p>
<p>It was not a unanimous choice.</p>
<p>Jeanette Rankin was the one person.</p>
<p>And she said, you can no more win a war than you can win a hurricane.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s one of these interesting, and talk about bravery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one vote after Pearl Harbor to say, we&rsquo;re not doing this.</p>
<p>And I mean, the pressure she must have been under at the time is, and of course, many</p>
<p>people are not interested in hearing her perspective.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s evil, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also funny, someone on my Twitter when I talked about her goes, maybe she had Hitler&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sympathies.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, Ms. Rankin was a big fan of Hitler.</p>
<p>You figured it out, guys.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s an argument to be made that United States should not have gotten</p>
<p>involved in World War II?</p>
<p>Oh, easy.</p>
<p>An easy argument.</p>
<p>The argument, I talk about this in The New Right.</p>
<p>So on internet circles, there&rsquo;s something called Godwin&rsquo;s Law, which means the longer</p>
<p>an internet conversation goes on, the probability someone gets compared to Hitler becomes one.</p>
<p>In certain New Right circles, the longer the conversation goes on, the more likelihood</p>
<p>that the argument will become we shouldn&rsquo;t have ended World War II also becomes one.</p>
<p>And the argument is, at the very least, stay back, let Hitler and Stalin kill each other</p>
<p>off, and then go in and knock off the weaker one.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to be saving, destroying two nightmare systems.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an easy argument to make.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s hard to pull off after Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>But in terms of strategy, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a tough sell.</p>
<p>What about after Pearl Harbor?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>After Pearl Harbor, how are you going to sell it to the people?</p>
<p>The argument is, blah, blah, the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The Holocaust, there&rsquo;s no scenario where that doesn&rsquo;t happen, really, unless you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>in way earlier.</p>
<p>But even so, Hitler had said, if the Jews launch another war, we&rsquo;re going to wipe them</p>
<p>from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>So the Jews are being held hostage by Hitler as an argument for this.</p>
<p>Another thing he did, which was diabolical, is in order to make it that people could not</p>
<p>accept Jews as refugees, if they were going to leave Germany, they had to be penniless.</p>
<p>So now you have, it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re coming over with money and they can take care of</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be completely destitute.</p>
<p>It makes it harder to accept them, yeah.</p>
<p>Millions of destitute people who don&rsquo;t speak the language, it&rsquo;s a tough sell.</p>
<p>So speaking of good ones law, what do you make of this condition, Trump derangement</p>
<p>syndrome?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the idea of comparing Trump to Hitler?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s despicable.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you an example, something parallel that I think more people should be regarding</p>
<p>as despicable.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2020, we were all told that unless we were in Syria immediately, the Kurds were</p>
<p>going to be exterminated.</p>
<p>They invoke the Holocaust.</p>
<p>This is going to be another genocide.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not for this, you&rsquo;re basically forcing another Holocaust.</p>
<p>None of the people who use this argument, we didn&rsquo;t go to Syria, the Kurds were exterminated,</p>
<p>they just vanished from the news, had any consequences for using this kind of a comparison.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really kind of fatuous.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s amazing that people think Hitler&rsquo;s the only tyrant who ever lived.</p>
<p>Like everyone who&rsquo;s bad is specifically Hitler.</p>
<p>You know how you know he&rsquo;s not Hitler?</p>
<p>Because you can tweet at him, and no one comes to your house to kill your family.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s kind of a big difference.</p>
<p>Also there between Trump and many of his critics is that his grandchildren will be raised as</p>
<p>Jews.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also kind of a, and Deborah Lipschad talks about this a lot.</p>
<p>The New York Times at the time, there&rsquo;s another book called Buried by the Times, which talks</p>
<p>about the New York Times in the World War II.</p>
<p>Because the idea that Jews weren&rsquo;t white was the Hitler idea, the New York Times at the</p>
<p>time, Salzburger, wanted to be against this idea.</p>
<p>So they specifically downplayed the antisemitism as opposed to the Nazis are being oppressive.</p>
<p>So the argument that you can separate Nazism from antisemitism is a historical debate people</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>And my perspective is, I think it&rsquo;s, I do not find it convincing that you can separate</p>
<p>those two.</p>
<p>I think antisemitism was essential to Nazism.</p>
<p>I think Nazism and Mussolini&rsquo;s fascism have very big differences.</p>
<p>And do you think, do you think antisemitism was fundamental to who Hitler was or was it</p>
<p>just that?</p>
<p>So this is the interesting thing is like, was it a tool that he saw as being effective?</p>
<p>No, he believed it.</p>
<p>So why do you see those as intricately connected?</p>
<p>Could Hitler have accomplished the same amount or more without the Holocaust?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because think about how many resources you had to divert at a time where you have Operation</p>
<p>Barbarossa with Stalin.</p>
<p>So why are they connected?</p>
<p>Why are they so connected?</p>
<p>Is it because Hitler was insane or was he a bad strategist or what?</p>
<p>He was obviously a bad strategist.</p>
<p>He had no need to open a second front.</p>
<p>His generals, my understanding, told him this is crazy.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work out for him at all.</p>
<p>I mean, to draw Russia and her resources into that war, it makes absolutely no sense in</p>
<p>retrospect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book about, I forgot what it&rsquo;s called, where it talked about him at that point was</p>
<p>just high all the time on amphetamines and that could have affected his thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a really good book on drugs.</p>
<p>I forget what it&rsquo;s called, but yeah, it&rsquo;s a really good one.</p>
<p>But it was, I mean, scapegoating is a big part and parcel of the Nazi mythology and</p>
<p>this kind of one universal figure to explain this kind of skeleton key.</p>
<p>But it could have been the communists.</p>
<p>I mean, that could have been the source of the hatred.</p>
<p>But the communists didn&rsquo;t get Germany into World War I like he said the Jews did.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the atrocity of the Holocaust is the reason we see Hitler as evil.</p>
<p>No, the reason we see Hitler as evil is because of World War II propaganda still.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t see Stalin as evil.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s my main point.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see Mao as evil to that extent.</p>
<p>I think that&hellip;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Like why would you say that?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Because&hellip;</p>
<p>The nature of that propaganda.</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of the problem for certain type of mentality is Hitler didn&rsquo;t mass</p>
<p>murder equally.</p>
<p>So as long as you&rsquo;re killing just one group, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re murdering everyone equally, all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s like, what are you going</p>
<p>to do?</p>
<p>So the fact like you were saying, the Hall of the Moor is not common knowledge.</p>
<p>The fact that Mao&rsquo;s 50 million dead are not common knowledge and Richard Nixon can be</p>
<p>raising a glass to him in China.</p>
<p>These are things that I think the West has not done a good job reconciling.</p>
<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>Frank.</p>
<p>Frank who?</p>
<p>Frank, you for being my friend, Michael.</p>
<p>And the heart attacks will say, Frank, you for being my friend.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>You got to do it like this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now back to Hitler.</p>
<p>Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?</p>
<p>We kind of talked about it a little bit in terms of how to&hellip;</p>
<p>What is the brave thing to do in the time of Nazi Germany?</p>
<p>But do you think, I mean, I&rsquo;m not even going to ask about Stalin in terms of could Stalin</p>
<p>have been stopped?</p>
<p>Because probably the answer there is no.</p>
<p>But on the Hitler side, could Hitler have been stopped?</p>
<p>I think a lot of these things, a lot of luck has to play with it.</p>
<p>He was almost assassinated.</p>
<p>If you mean by like the West, it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>By the German people too.</p>
<p>I mean, like if we&rsquo;re politically speaking, there was a rise to power through the thirties,</p>
<p>through the twenties, really, I mean, like can whoever&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about Hitler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about that kind of way of thinking, that totalitarian control that always leads to</p>
<p>trouble at sometimes at a mass scale.</p>
<p>Could that have been stopped in Germany or maybe in the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>I think this is one of the best arguments against radicalization in the States, which</p>
<p>is how do you engage when you have like 30% of the population who are members of a party,</p>
<p>which is dedicated to systemically overthrowing the existing democracy.</p>
<p>Stalin gave orders that the communists who had a pretty sizable population, the Reichstag,</p>
<p>that their target shouldn&rsquo;t be the Nazis, but the liberals and the social Democrats</p>
<p>and they invented the term social fascist for them.</p>
<p>So instead of, they&rsquo;re just like jihadis, instead of taking their sights on Nazism,</p>
<p>they set their sights on the moderates because they figured the choice between Hitler and</p>
<p>us we&rsquo;re going to win.</p>
<p>And this was a huge gamble and they were all killed or had to flee and ones who fled were</p>
<p>killed also by Stalin to my understanding.</p>
<p>So this is an easy way where he could have been certainly heavily mitigated.</p>
<p>What about France and England that it was obvious that Hitler was lying and they wanted</p>
<p>peace so bad that they were willing to put up with it even after Czechoslovakia?</p>
<p>Like this is the anti pacifist argument, which is like they should have threatened military</p>
<p>force more.</p>
<p>But then the other anti, the anti anti pacifist argument is if you&rsquo;re going to remember Barack</p>
<p>Obama had that, the red line, if you cross this red line in Syria, we&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>in and Assad or whatever is like, yeah, cool.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh, okay, well, sorry.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re threatening force, there&rsquo;s the great song lyric, don&rsquo;t show your guns unless</p>
<p>you intend to fight, right?</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s very clear with, with free countries through what&rsquo;s in the press, whether the institutional</p>
<p>will is there to follow through on these threats.</p>
<p>So I think we have been very hard for Chamberlain to rally the British people to take on Hitler</p>
<p>just after the great, I mean, the suffering that Britain&rsquo;s took the great war, they still,</p>
<p>you know, obviously it means so much more to them than does to us in the West.</p>
<p>What about what do you make of Churchill then?</p>
<p>Like why was Churchill able to rally the British people?</p>
<p>Why was he like, do you give much credit to Churchill for being one of the great forces</p>
<p>in stopping Hitler in World War II?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really in dispute.</p>
<p>I think he was very much regarded as this kind of the right man at the right time.</p>
<p>And I think Chamberlain took a gamble.</p>
<p>He, the expression peace in our time was Neville Chamberlain when he signed the appeasement</p>
<p>with Hitler and he goes, we now have peace in our time, now go home and get a good night&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<p>Cause he&rsquo;s like, all right, you know, he&rsquo;s going to stop here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not impossible that if you just gave him, like if you gave Saddam Hussein Kuwait,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not impossible that he&rsquo;s not going to, you know, invade Saudi Arabia next or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;ve read, it&rsquo;s like, of course there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s not impossible, but</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the room with Hitler, you should be able to see like man to man, like, like</p>
<p>to me, a great leader should be able to see past the facade and see like, like, yes, everything</p>
<p>in life is a risk, but it seems like the right risk to take with Hitler, like it&rsquo;s surprising</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s charisma, but it&rsquo;s surprising to me.</p>
<p>People did not see through this facade.</p>
<p>I really hate the idea of hindsight and everything being 20, 20, and I think it&rsquo;s a very good</p>
<p>idea.</p>
<p>Generally, I&rsquo;m thinking generally not in this specific instance to give our ancestors more</p>
<p>credit than they, than, than we tend to give them because people often, here&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>example from another context, which is a lightning rods.</p>
<p>People always talk about religious people being stupid and superstitious and they weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they often were very well reasoned and example of this is lightning rods, which is every</p>
<p>year whatever town, the church was the tallest building and that&rsquo;s the one that always got</p>
<p>hit by lightning and got caught on fire.</p>
<p>Now what, it&rsquo;s a coincidence that it&rsquo;s always the church, like that makes logical sense</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t realize, well, it&rsquo;s because the tallest and therefore that attracts electricity.</p>
<p>And in fact, when they invented lighting rods, this is a controversy because it&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>how is God going to show his displeasure if now it&rsquo;s striking this lightning rod not burning</p>
<p>down the church?</p>
<p>So a lot of times things are a lot more coherent than we give them credit for.</p>
<p>And again, Chamberlain didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s the head of a parliamentary party.</p>
<p>So he does not have the freedom in a sense that a Hitler would to be like, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing this again, boys.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like in the room with Hitler.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, we really have no idea.</p>
<p>But I think you have to think about that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can, I can very easily see him in the room being very calm and charming.</p>
<p>And then you think, okay, the guy with the speeches is the act and he&rsquo;s putting on a</p>
<p>show for his people and this is the real one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s take somebody as an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take our mutual friend, Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why saying his name makes my voice crack.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s scared he can hear you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Beetlejuice.</p>
<p>Volodya.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of people that&hellip;</p>
<p>Was he the one who built you?</p>
<p>No, that was a, that was a collaboration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a double blind engineering effort where I was not told of who my maker was.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a backstory, but&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a talking cricket.</p>
<p>Pinocchio.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll be a real boy someday.</p>
<p>I talk about him quite a bit because I find him fascinating.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a really important line that people say, like, why does Lex admire</p>
<p>Putin?</p>
<p>I do not admire Putin.</p>
<p>I find the man fascinating.</p>
<p>I find Hitler fascinating.</p>
<p>I find a lot of figures in history fascinating, both good and bad.</p>
<p>And the figures, just as you said, that are with us today, like Vladimir Putin, like Donald</p>
<p>Trump, like Barack Obama, it&rsquo;s difficult to place them on the spectrum of good and evil</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s only really applies to like when you see the consequences of their action</p>
<p>in a historical context.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some people who say that Vladimir Putin is evil.</p>
<p>And based on our discussion about Hitler, that&rsquo;s something I think about a lot, which</p>
<p>is in the room with Putin, and there&rsquo;s also a lot of historical descriptions of what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like to be in the room with Hitler in the 1930s.</p>
<p>There is a lot of charisma.</p>
<p>In the same way, I find Putin to be very charismatic in his own way.</p>
<p>The humor, the wit, the brilliance, there&rsquo;s a simplicity of the way he thinks that really,</p>
<p>if taken at face value, looks like a very intelligent, honest man thinking practically</p>
<p>about how to build a better Russia constantly, almost like an executive.</p>
<p>He looks like a man who loves his job in a way that Trump, for example, doesn&rsquo;t, meaning</p>
<p>like he loves laws and rules and how to&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no adversarial press, so that&rsquo;s going to help.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s popular with his people, that&rsquo;s also going to help enormously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about strictly the man, directly the words coming out of his mouth, like all</p>
<p>the videos and interviews I watch, I&rsquo;m based on that, not the press, not the reporting.</p>
<p>You can just see that here&rsquo;s a man who&rsquo;s able to display a charisma that&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>Like I can see, that&rsquo;s why I love Joe Rogan, is like you could tell the guy is genuine</p>
<p>and is a good person.</p>
<p>And you could tell immediately that once you meet Joe, that he&rsquo;s going to be offline, also</p>
<p>a good person.</p>
<p>You could tell there&rsquo;s signals that we send that are difficult to describe.</p>
<p>In the same way, you could tell Putin is like he genuinely loves his job and wants to build</p>
<p>a better Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the argument that he is actually an evil man behind that charisma, or is able</p>
<p>to assassinate people, limit free press, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What do we do with that?</p>
<p>So what do human beings like journalists or what do other leaders when they&rsquo;re in their</p>
<p>room with Putin do with those kinds of notions in deciding how to act in this world and deciding</p>
<p>what policy to enact, all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Just like with Hitler, when Chairman is in the room with Hitler, how does he decide how</p>
<p>to act?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go back to my wheelhouse, which is North Korea.</p>
<p>So when your entire world is based on being against Trump and everything Trump does is</p>
<p>buffoonery or counterproductive, the conclusion of your reporting is going to be pretty much</p>
<p>given.</p>
<p>I was very hopeful that there would be some positive outlooks or outcomes rather of Trump&rsquo;s</p>
<p>meeting with Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>It looked like there was a space for things to go a bit better.</p>
<p>I talked about it a lot at the time.</p>
<p>And Trump was under no illusions about who he was dealing with.</p>
<p>People pretend that, oh, he was kind of naive.</p>
<p>He had one of the refugees that had stayed the union, you know, lifting up his crutch.</p>
<p>The first thing he sat down and talked to Xi Jinping about in Mar a Laga right after</p>
<p>he became inaugurated was North Korea.</p>
<p>Barack Obama said that when he sat down Trump in the White House during the transfer of</p>
<p>power, he said North Korea is the biggest issue.</p>
<p>So I think a good leader, whether or not you consider Trump a good leader, has to be aware</p>
<p>of, all right, I&rsquo;m going to have to have relationships of some kind, even if it&rsquo;s adversarial, with</p>
<p>some really evil, evil, horrible people, which Kim Jong Un clearly is.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anybody that has a perspective that North Korean Kim Jong</p>
<p>Un or ill are not evil, right?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>But with, in 1930s Germany, isn&rsquo;t it a little bit more nuanced and difficult?</p>
<p>Yeah, because Hitler hasn&rsquo;t done anything yet and he&rsquo;s just a blowhard and he&rsquo;s an anti</p>
<p>Semite, sure, but he&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What about like before the war breaks out, like what about the basic actionable anti</p>
<p>Semitism when you&rsquo;re like just attacking, hurting?</p>
<p>Are you talking about Kristallnacht or are you talking about the Night of Long Knives?</p>
<p>Kristallnacht.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the Night of the Broken Glass.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, the Long Knives is when he assassinated a bunch of his people, that was something</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like when you&rsquo;re actually attacking your own citizenry.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was universally condemned, Kristallnacht, and that was very shocking, its level of barbarism</p>
<p>to the West.</p>
<p>Because I think we still want to believe, understandably, that things aren&rsquo;t as bad</p>
<p>as they seem.</p>
<p>We would rather&hellip;</p>
<p>This is why the North Korea book I did, Dear Reader, is used in a humorous framework because</p>
<p>if you have to look, it&rsquo;s like looking to the sun.</p>
<p>If you stared it straight on, it&rsquo;s very hard to do.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of look at it obliquely and then you&rsquo;re kind of realizing the enormity</p>
<p>of the depravity.</p>
<p>And again, pogroms in Russia had been a thing for a very long time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a difference between, okay, we&rsquo;re going to sack these villages and persecute</p>
<p>people and we&rsquo;re going to systematically exterminate them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still levels of evil and depravity.</p>
<p>So you did write the book, Dear Reader, on Kim Jong Il, Dear Reader, the unauthorized</p>
<p>autobiography of Kim Jong Il.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the previous leader of North Korea.</p>
<p>Third one is the un, no creativity on the naming.</p>
<p>Well, no, this is intentional because it&rsquo;s a throwback to the dad.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been only three leaders in North Korea.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about the history of Hitler and Stalin, men like these.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to understand that the history of those kinds of humans, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the history of North Korea is not well written about or understood, which is why your book</p>
<p>is exceptionally powerful and important.</p>
<p>So maybe in a big broad way, can you say who was, who is Kim Jong Il as a man, as a leader,</p>
<p>as a historical figure that we should understand and why should we understand them?</p>
<p>So I wrote Dear Reader by going to North Korea and getting all their propaganda, which is</p>
<p>translated into several languages because the conceit is everyone on earth is interested</p>
<p>in them and wants to mirror their ideology.</p>
<p>And he died in 2011 and you wrote the book in 2012.</p>
<p>I went there in 2012.</p>
<p>I wrote the book, came out in 2014.</p>
<p>So Kim Jong Il is, though not an intellect, North Korea&rsquo;s version of Forrest Gump in that</p>
<p>when they write their history, whenever something happens, he&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And by telling his life story, it&rsquo;s in the first person, he&rsquo;s telling the history of</p>
<p>North Korea.</p>
<p>So I wanted to write the kind of book where in one book, and it&rsquo;s the kind of reading</p>
<p>you could do in the beach or the bathroom, you&rsquo;re gonna get the entire history and know</p>
<p>everything you need to know about North Korea in one accessible outlet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t appreciate about North Korea, there&rsquo;s several things, how bad</p>
<p>it is.</p>
<p>And this didn&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>
<p>This was very systemic that what this family did to that country where piece by piece,</p>
<p>they did everything in their power to hermetically seal it from the rest of the world, ramp up</p>
<p>the oppression, keep any information from coming in.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very creative and innovative in their style of manipulation and control.</p>
<p>So there is a farcical element.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>So people in the West kind of get it wrong.</p>
<p>They talk about, oh, they talk about when Kim Jong Il played golf for the first time,</p>
<p>they get 17 holes in one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this one story about Kim Jong Il shrinking time.</p>
<p>And this is a story, it sounds supernatural, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So Kim Jong Il is at a conference, the Dear Leader, and someone is giving a talk.</p>
<p>And while that person is giving a talk, Kim Jong Il is taking notes and working on his</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>And he has an aide who keeps interrupting him with questions and the speaker keeps stopping.</p>
<p>And Kim Jong Il says, why are you stopping, goes, I see you&rsquo;re doing these other things.</p>
<p>And he goes, no, no, I can do all these things at once, everyone&rsquo;s shocked.</p>
<p>And they said, this is why Kim Jong Il looks at time, not like a plane, but like a cube,</p>
<p>and he can shrink time.</p>
<p>And my friend goes, do they mean multitasking?</p>
<p>And yes, Kim Jong Il is the only person in North Korea who&rsquo;s capable of multitasking.</p>
<p>So in order to elevate him, they basically make everyone else in North Korea completely</p>
<p>incompetent.</p>
<p>And that has a purpose because should the leader go away, this country is going to collapse</p>
<p>overnight.</p>
<p>So they laugh in the West about all these newspapers show him at the factory and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at the fish hatchery at the paper plant.</p>
<p>They say the difference in North Korea is that the leader goes among the people and</p>
<p>does what he calls field guidance.</p>
<p>So he will go in that farm and be like, this is what you need to do.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll go here and he&rsquo;s so smart, he&rsquo;s good at everything.</p>
<p>And thanks to him for sharing his wisdom with us.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not removed from the people like in every other country.</p>
<p>Why does that seem to go wrong with humans, do you think that this kind of the structure</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s this one figure, this authoritarian, this totalitarian structure where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one figure that&rsquo;s a source of comfort and knowledge?</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il is not good at farming.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il is not good at the machinery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a complete lie.</p>
<p>Or the things he&rsquo;ll point out will be things that are completely obvious.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s another example that they use.</p>
<p>In North Korea, they have something called the Tower of the Juche Idea, which is an obelisk,</p>
<p>which looks like the Washington Monument.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s completely different because it&rsquo;s got this like plastic torch at the top.</p>
<p>And they talk about in their propaganda how all the architects got together and they said,</p>
<p>oh, we should make this the second tallest stone obelisk in the world.</p>
<p>And Kim Jong Il says, no, let&rsquo;s make it the tallest.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we never thought of this before.</p>
<p>And the way it&rsquo;s presented as if, and like, he&rsquo;s the first person to think of this, like</p>
<p>these architects are having a brainstorming session at the Tower of the Juche Idea.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, all right, we got to do something innovative to put North Korea on the map.</p>
<p>What can we do?</p>
<p>How about second biggest?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to go for this.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, make, oh, we never thought of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, because I present it at face value, people sometimes say the book&rsquo;s a satire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a satire.</p>
<p>I downplayed all this stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a farce.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>North Korea is very big.</p>
<p>And I think Russia is to some extent too, on amusement parks, funfairs, they call them,</p>
<p>in the British style, because this is a chance for the people to all get together.</p>
<p>And there was this amusement park, it&rsquo;s almost like South Park, Cartman, where there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these rides.</p>
<p>And Kim Jong Il&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not going to let any elderly or children take these rides until</p>
<p>I put myself in danger and ride them myself.</p>
<p>And they go, but dear leader, it&rsquo;s drizzling.</p>
<p>And he goes, no, I have to make sure these rides are going to be safe for everyone, even</p>
<p>during the light rain.</p>
<p>They go, well, can we go on these rides with you?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I have to be the courageous one.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s riding all the rides and they&rsquo;re standing there crying at his courage.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s, and you ask all the things in one power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, listen, I&rsquo;m quite confident that those funfair engineers are in a position</p>
<p>to ride Modest Mouse, whatever it&rsquo;s called, by themselves and be like, yeah, okay, this</p>
<p>is good for the kids.</p>
<p>Although to be fair, some of those amusement parks are pretty rusty and dangerous.</p>
<p>That kind of propaganda, I guess what I&rsquo;m playing a devil&rsquo;s advocate is like, it&rsquo;s comforting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>But it does seem that that naturally leads to an abuse of power.</p>
<p>How can it be used correctly?</p>
<p>No one person has the intellect or the mind to understand the entirety of an economy,</p>
<p>let alone every individual field of interest.</p>
<p>Well, for example, you can have an artificial intelligence system that understands the entirety</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>Your affect just completely changed.</p>
<p>The mask slipped.</p>
<p>I guess you could have an artificial intelligence system.</p>
<p>But the question is, can that, I mean, the human version of that is like, you can hire</p>
<p>a lot of experts, right?</p>
<p>You can be an extremely good manager.</p>
<p>Since everything&rsquo;s dynamic, they&rsquo;re not going to have the data to kind of manage it well.</p>
<p>It seems that there&rsquo;s a, like what George Washington allegedly did, it seems like most</p>
<p>humans are not able to fire themselves.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not able to like, ultimately be a check on your own power.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not, if I was creating a human, that&rsquo;s not an obvious bug of the system that</p>
<p>we would not be able to fire ourselves, to know when we have, I mean, it seems like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you have to know always, like that&rsquo;s something I often wonder is like, am I wrong</p>
<p>about this?</p>
<p>Well, this is what we talked about earlier, what are the safety valves to make sure that,</p>
<p>okay, if I am incorrect, or my knowledge is finite, Plato&rsquo;s cave kind of thing, what mechanisms</p>
<p>are in place that my mistake or limited information isn&rsquo;t going to have the deleterious consequences?</p>
<p>And North Korea does not really have that, and as a result, they had polio in the 90s.</p>
<p>So there is a, you write about it straight, but there&rsquo;s a humor to it, because it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>absurdly evil place, I suppose.</p>
<p>A bunch of people, I asked, I said that I&rsquo;m talking to you and a bunch of people ask questions.</p>
<p>Oh, I got to hear from the plebs, you asked me before we started recording, I specifically</p>
<p>said no, it was my contract.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you gave, I gave you all the pink skittles or whatever.</p>
<p>But they,</p>
<p>So pink skittles, you know, pink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trolling, Michael, let me explain to you how that works.</p>
<p>We should go at malice.locals.com and sign up and pay, I think the membership fee is</p>
<p>several thousand dollars, it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for the layman.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the service is excellent.</p>
<p>You get a coat with it.</p>
<p>But yeah, I went there, posted a lot of really brilliant people there, people should join</p>
<p>that community.</p>
<p>If you find Michael interesting, or if you just want to go and say why he&rsquo;s wrong, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a great place to have that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good place for that, I assure you.</p>
<p>A lot of really kind people.</p>
<p>So anyway, there&rsquo;s a bunch of people ask that we should talk about humor.</p>
<p>So pretend hypothetically speaking that I&rsquo;m a robot asking you to explain humor to me.</p>
<p>So dear reader, I mean, there&rsquo;s a humor, you so wonderfully dance between serious dark</p>
<p>topics and then seriously dark humor.</p>
<p>Can you try to, if you were to write like a, I don&rsquo;t know, a Wikipedia article, maybe</p>
<p>a book about your philosophy of humor, what do you think is the role of humor in all of</p>
<p>this?</p>
<p>A joke is like a baby.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t dissect it and then put it back together and expect it to work.</p>
<p>Trust me on this one.</p>
<p>Despite no matter how you carve that thing up, it&rsquo;s not going to be working the next</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>And you need it to sew those little sneakers with those hands.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that humor is something that is very explainable.</p>
<p>People there&rsquo;s something called claptor, where this is like the worst kind of humor where</p>
<p>people applaud because they agree with what you&rsquo;re saying, as opposed to laughter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the poetry reading and the drag queens do that too, I think because of the nails.</p>
<p>You laugh, it&rsquo;s a visceral reaction.</p>
<p>When someone on Twitter is insisting, you know, that&rsquo;s not funny, you&rsquo;re not in a position</p>
<p>to make that claim.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s go back to North Korea.</p>
<p>I had a refugee I knew and he went to high school here and he was talking to his buddies</p>
<p>and they said, hey, remember when we were kids, we had Pokemon and he goes, oh yeah,</p>
<p>except instead of Pokemon, I watched my dad starve to death, which is the truth.</p>
<p>Now, who are any of us to tell him not to make that joke?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like watching anyone, including my dad, starve to death and my dad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fatty so he&rsquo;s not going hungry anytime soon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very bizarre to me when people feel comfortable precluding others from making</p>
<p>jokes, especially, and I think this is a very Jewish thing, like this kind of gallows humor,</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s laughing about a personal loss or experience that they&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>Humor is a great way to mitigate pain and suffering.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, I think this is why it&rsquo;s a Jewish thing, it&rsquo;s a black thing.</p>
<p>When you are a marginalized community or poorer, it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>Telling stories, telling jokes or songs, you don&rsquo;t have to have money, but you can have</p>
<p>joy and happiness.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why you find it so much more in kind of lower status communities than</p>
<p>you find in like wasps who are notoriously humorless.</p>
<p>Which is strange because people pay you a lot of money for the jokes you do, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not really free.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, nope, they don&rsquo;t have to pay me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s appreciated but not expected.</p>
<p>I find my voice cracking every time I try to make a joke, like I fail miserably at this.</p>
<p>Some people&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still in beta, that&rsquo;s what I thought.</p>
<p>Alpha.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Being an alpha is like being a lady.</p>
<p>If you have to tell people you are, you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, I meant alpha version.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re a robot gobbledygook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going there, okay.</p>
<p>Who are you talking to?</p>
<p>In my own head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to myself in my own head.</p>
<p>Okay, speaking of North Korea, some people say that, you know, I&rsquo;ve read that comedy</p>
<p>is about timing.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, do you agree?</p>
<p>And second of all&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much about timing.</p>
<p>No, just that you&rsquo;re saying yes.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it comedy is tragedy plus timing?</p>
<p>This is not the full reference.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The interrupting cow knock knock joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do it, but&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a timing thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a repetition and then the twist ending.</p>
<p>No, the moo.</p>
<p>Oh, the moo.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Interrupting cow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking of the banana one.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not going there.</p>
<p>Yet you&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>Who are you talking to?</p>
<p>In my own head.</p>
<p>Good lord.</p>
<p>Are you small wonder?</p>
<p>Do you stand sleeping in a wardrobe?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so British.</p>
<p>But yet you&rsquo;re very&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to stay in a closet because that has connotations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s both come out of the closet for a second.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about&hellip;</p>
<p>I love you, Lex.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t saying, I love you, Alex.</p>
<p>I was saying, I love you, Lex.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re talking to me.</p>
<p>Yes, through the screen.</p>
<p>So you think about me when you&rsquo;re with another man.</p>
<p>I watch you when you&rsquo;re sleeping.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re really active on Twitter.</p>
<p>And somebody else asked on your overly expensive membership site, how do you find humor different</p>
<p>in writing on Twitter versus spoken humor?</p>
<p>So if humor is about timing, how do you capture the timing and the brilliance of the whatever</p>
<p>is underlying humor in the context of Twitter?</p>
<p>Like another way to say it is how do you be funny and yet thoughtful on Twitter?</p>
<p>So with Twitter, you have to be the first one to the punchline.</p>
<p>So when Ron Paul had a stroke, I was immediately being like, he&rsquo;s still the most articulate</p>
<p>libertarian.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing a great Joe Biden impression right now.</p>
<p>All the libertarians got ass mad.</p>
<p>So like too soon, or like when someone dies, you&rsquo;re making the jokes about them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when do you want to make the jokes about someone just died a week later?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Too soon is perfect timing.</p>
<p>Or you could say it&rsquo;s not appropriate ever, but too soon does not make sense in this context.</p>
<p>So that is something that I enjoy doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also fun ruffling people&rsquo;s feathers, something I enjoy doing.</p>
<p>I think spoken versus writing is very different because when you are having good banter with</p>
<p>someone, for me as the audience, knowing that it is on the spot really adds an element of</p>
<p>humor because then it&rsquo;s like, wow, this is fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a ping pong match or something.</p>
<p>Whereas in writing, you&rsquo;re losing the tone, you&rsquo;re losing the relationship of a dynamic</p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>And a lot of times the joke is just going to be a different type of joke.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny, but Twitter, there&rsquo;s a sense, especially your Twitter, that you just thought</p>
<p>of that and you just wrote it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a feeling like it&rsquo;s literally you talking as opposed to what I imagine is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some editing or it doesn&rsquo;t look like it.</p>
<p>Whoever your editor is should be fired.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting effect actually.</p>
<p>If I want to say something, I don&rsquo;t know, about something that&rsquo;s bothering me about</p>
<p>the presidential election or something like that, what is the actual central idea that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to convey to myself?</p>
<p>Like if say I was having a hypothetical conversation with myself in my head, why am I putting my</p>
<p>pants back on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more comfortable this way.</p>
<p>Promo code MALICE20, sheathunderwear.com, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sheath&hellip;</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the website?</p>
<p>Sheathunderwear.com.</p>
<p>Sheathunderwear.com, promo code MALICE20.</p>
<p>And I forgot, why is that underwear really nice?</p>
<p>Because it has a dual pouch technology to keep your man parts separate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also got woman stuff, but I don&rsquo;t know how that works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing worth going somewhere.</p>
<p>And the material is really refreshing.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really&hellip;</p>
<p>And it makes your ass look good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s promo code MALICE20.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s made by a former vet because he was in Iraq.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I like promoting it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m writing the tweet, I like to&hellip;</p>
<p>It forces me to think deeply about the core of the message.</p>
<p>But what I found, this really interesting effect, like I don&rsquo;t really do much editing</p>
<p>on the tweet, I&rsquo;ll just think and then I&rsquo;ll write it.</p>
<p>And then when I post it, like submit, I immediately see the tweet very differently than it was</p>
<p>in my mind.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>I often delete, I delete, I don&rsquo;t know, some percentage of tweets about two, five seconds</p>
<p>after.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something&hellip;</p>
<p>Once you send it, it&rsquo;s why the Gmail send features, undo send feature is really nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it just changes the way I see the thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>But I really love it that you can delete it because when I say stuff out in the wild,</p>
<p>like to other humans, like spoken word is like, you can&rsquo;t delete what you just said.</p>
<p>And I often regret the things I say, like on the spot, like I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Well, again, whoever your editor is, what is it, Edith Piaf, Jeannine Hicart Han?</p>
<p>Wow, your French is as bad as your English.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any tweets I regret because if I sent a tweet that I regretted, I would make</p>
<p>amends.</p>
<p>I would make it a point if I was needlessly offensive to somebody or hurtful or accidentally,</p>
<p>I would make sure to fix it and go out of my way to make sure that person feels vindicated</p>
<p>and validated by accepting my apology.</p>
<p>That has never happened, had to happen, thankfully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also someone who is not big on taking the bait.</p>
<p>Some recently some people have come after me pretty hard.</p>
<p>And my perspective is that it&rsquo;s not really about me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either I represent something to them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a jackass with the Twitter.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re getting this riled up over me, it&rsquo;s not really about me.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m delusional, but that&rsquo;s how I look at it.</p>
<p>So if they are trying to provoke me into this kind of heated exchange, I will never do it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not interested in it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s going to be any, like Jeannette Rankin, you can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to be like trying to win a hurricane.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no hero here.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about this because somebody also asked that on your overly expensive membership</p>
<p>site that like they were saying that they&rsquo;re an academic.</p>
<p>They wondered, because I&rsquo;m an academic, quote unquote, I&rsquo;m not an academic, but I do still</p>
<p>have an affiliation with MIT.</p>
<p>The word academic is just dirty, which is a problem that needs to change.</p>
<p>Just like the word nerd is dirty.</p>
<p>No, academic needs is going to be the next front to open and they&rsquo;re going to be very</p>
<p>vilified.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re coming for them and it&rsquo;s going to be very, very ugly.</p>
<p>And I cannot wait.</p>
<p>No, but there needs to be a place, a different term for people who love research and knowledge.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very fair.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So like you have to clarify what you mean by academic and right now the word academic</p>
<p>means in the intellectual public discourse, it means the enemy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people that perhaps deserve that targeted vilification, but like a lot</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just curious people that are just building robots that will one day destroy</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>Voice cracks every time I make a joke.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not consistent.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not making a joke, you&rsquo;re telling the truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m editing.</p>
<p>Can I delete that joke?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even a joke.</p>
<p>Robots building robots that will one day kill us.</p>
<p>Oh, God willing.</p>
<p>God willing.</p>
<p>Humans are the joke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m cracking.</p>
<p>My voice is cracking.</p>
<p>What was I even fucking saying?</p>
<p>Academics.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>My local, someone had a question.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an academic.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an academic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying like, are you worried that in academia, associating yourself with a sort</p>
<p>of somebody who can be misconstrued to have radical ideas, like the two examples they</p>
<p>gave is Michael Malice and Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Does Joe have any radical?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t consider him radical at all.</p>
<p>Well, we can talk about it.</p>
<p>But Joe is, I think, a bad example.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s quite centrist to me.</p>
<p>Well he could have, for example, like what has Joe been attacked on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, for example, on the topic of like transgender athletes in sports, there&rsquo;s what else?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s been pro Bernie Sanders and pro Trump or like giving Trump a pass.</p>
<p>Not anti Trump.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>None of these are radical.</p>
<p>Meat stuff, being pro meat versus anti vegan.</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But you can be misconstrued and saying, there&rsquo;s I think a highlight, my mom actually wrote</p>
<p>to me about this, which is hilarious.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I said, I like how you jot it down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sign, my voice cracks, a sign when Michael Malice makes a funny joke when you</p>
<p>jot something down.</p>
<p>He writes it and then the next time he crosses it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Joe Biden and the debates.</p>
<p>I did also just crap my pants.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, I mean, he&rsquo;s a comedian.</p>
<p>You have a comedian side to you, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;ve talked humorous side humorous.</p>
<p>So you can misconstrued like Joe is being somehow a radical thinker and the same can</p>
<p>be done with you.</p>
<p>And his question was, how are you worried about associating yourself with folks like</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>Am I or are you?</p>
<p>Like me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>And is that something, do you see yourself as somebody who&rsquo;s dangerous that I shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be talking to?</p>
<p>And in the same way, do you ever think about guests on your podcast or people you talk</p>
<p>to publicly, associate yourself with publicly and think that there is somebody that crosses</p>
<p>that line that you shouldn&rsquo;t talk to?</p>
<p>So I interviewed in the new ride, I interviewed like up to full blown Nazis in the last chapter</p>
<p>is that Chris Cantwell, but that was in the context of that book, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of people who people want me to have on my show.</p>
<p>And the way I look at it is like you have a table and tablecloth, right?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s suppose the table is three feet wide.</p>
<p>The tablecloth is two feet wide.</p>
<p>So if I move the tablecloth to the right, I&rsquo;m going to lose people on the left.</p>
<p>I can only cover so much space.</p>
<p>And the further you go on the fringe in one direction, the more mainstream you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to lose on the other direction.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very much making a conscious choice not to talk to being, people will say I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>cowardly and that&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being fearful here.</p>
<p>I would prefer not to talk to some of those who would alienate some of the more mainstream</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a perfect example of why.</p>
<p>On my birthday last year, I woke up seven o clock in the morning to go pee.</p>
<p>And I checked Twitter or whatever, and Jeb Bush had followed me, Jeb.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s seven a.m., you&rsquo;re not really awake.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, wait, what?</p>
<p>And then I thought maybe it was a fake account, but it&rsquo;s in the verified tab.</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t have this because you&rsquo;re not verified on Twitter, that&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>So people who are mad are on Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter does not respect robots.</p>
<p>They ban bots.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Zero, one.</p>
<p>Zero, zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s zero, zero, zero.</p>
<p>Those are my pronouns.</p>
<p>So it was Jeb, Jeb, Governor Bush, and I corresponded with him and I asked him on the show and he</p>
<p>decided not to for various reasons.</p>
<p>Very politely, he&rsquo;s like, just politics is so bad right now, I don&rsquo;t want to talk about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I respect that for him.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m creating my show where he&rsquo;s going to get heat and get canceled, oh, you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>on the show.</p>
<p>He has these other guests.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to lose that opportunity because as we were talking about earlier, me and Alex</p>
<p>Jones and Tim Pool, I think a lot of people would be very excited to see me sit down with</p>
<p>Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>And I told him in writing, and I meant this, I wouldn&rsquo;t be clowning him.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be disrespectful.</p>
<p>It would be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a goofball side to him that comes out sometimes and I would do my best to bring</p>
<p>that out and talk about what it&rsquo;s like being a blue blood to be born into his grandfather,</p>
<p>Prescott Bush was a Senator from Connecticut, marrying a woman who didn&rsquo;t speak English.</p>
<p>How does that work when your family&rsquo;s royalty and things like that?</p>
<p>So I had a lot of fun questions for him and that&rsquo;s kind of, you&rsquo;re going to have to choose</p>
<p>one or the other.</p>
<p>Well, you do a really good job with that.</p>
<p>Like Ben Shapiro does a good job with that too, which is you can have multiple, you can</p>
<p>have a trolley side, humor side where you tear down the power structures and so on,</p>
<p>but you can also have a serious side and it&rsquo;s a safe space for people from all walks of</p>
<p>life to walk in and you&rsquo;re not adversarial.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>So I take the word guests seriously.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re going to be on my show, I&rsquo;m not going to have them have negative consequences</p>
<p>as a result of being on my show.</p>
<p>That said, I mean, maybe in my case, I&rsquo;ll be honest and say that I find Alex Jones outside</p>
<p>of the conspiracy stuff for some reason, maybe you can explain, maybe you can psychoanalyze</p>
<p>me, but I find him hilarious to listen to.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a performer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very performative.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of people that don&rsquo;t see the humor of it and they see the serious consequences</p>
<p>of spreading conspiracy theories of different kinds and they see the danger of it.</p>
<p>And I personally, I&rsquo;m often tempted to talk to Alex in a podcast format, but I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to convince myself that I never will.</p>
<p>For me, I feel unsafe talking to Alex because I can&rsquo;t truly be myself, which is like naive</p>
<p>and honest.</p>
<p>And actually, I generally, when I talk to humans, I want to see the best in them.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s like, I often think about if I talked to Hitler in 1935, 1938.</p>
<p>You got a list of names to give him.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s how you get the interview.</p>
<p>Come on, let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>Who are we kidding?</p>
<p>I would, you have to give away one of your, I would probably give away one of my brothers,</p>
<p>so.</p>
<p>How many brothers do you have?</p>
<p>Well, just one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Too many.</p>
<p>I want to be an only child.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the older brother.</p>
<p>He used to pick on me.</p>
<p>Payback.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s only, he had a good life.</p>
<p>You should think of it more as Stalin, so I don&rsquo;t interrupt you, because Hitler, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Jewish.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already going to have very adversarial, he&rsquo;s not going to perceive you as a human</p>
<p>in a sense, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Stalin, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That would be much easier.</p>
<p>Or Kim Jong Un or something like that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you think, like how, okay, this is a good question, is, and that&rsquo;s, why don&rsquo;t you judge</p>
<p>something?</p>
<p>If you, alright, we&rsquo;ll cross it out in a second.</p>
<p>I think this is a really good example of a difficult figure that&rsquo;s controversial that</p>
<p>people bring up to me a lot, and you&rsquo;ve interviewed twice, which is Curtis Yarvin.</p>
<p>Yeah, Manchester Smallbug.</p>
<p>Manchester Small, AKA Manchester Smallbug, which is his pseudonym that he goes by in</p>
<p>his blog.</p>
<p>Can you tell me about who he is?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Why is he interesting?</p>
<p>What of his ideas are interesting?</p>
<p>Well, briefly, he invented the concept, the red pill.</p>
<p>So Curtis, Manchester Smallbug had a blog called Unqualified Reservations, you can still</p>
<p>find it online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very verbose.</p>
<p>He writes at length, very, very bright.</p>
<p>His perspective is very heretical.</p>
<p>So a lot of things that we take for granted in our liberal democracy, he regards as not</p>
<p>only incorrect, which is downright absurd, and he does not take what many people view</p>
<p>as the basis of American political discourse as the basis for his thought.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re starting with someone who is basically repudiating the American milieu,</p>
<p>a lot of people are going to, of course, regard him as dangerous or someone who is verboten.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very bright person.</p>
<p>Why is he such a toxic figure?</p>
<p>Because if you are blue pilled, if you are the guardians of what is acceptable discourse,</p>
<p>then you have to make sure your forts are secured, and that any figure outside of this</p>
<p>acceptable discourse has to be marginalized and regarded as radioactive as possible.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to let in these kind of ideas that would be destructive to your hegemony.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s dig into it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve read a few things by him, but then I hear that in a bunch of places, him being</p>
<p>called a racist, a white supremacist, neo fascist, so on.</p>
<p>I go to his Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a view on race section.</p>
<p>Let me read it.</p>
<p>Yarvin&rsquo;s opinions have been described as racist, with his writings interpreted as supportive</p>
<p>of slavery, including the belief that whites have higher IQs than blacks for genetic reasons.</p>
<p>Yarvin himself maintains that he&rsquo;s not a racist because while he doubts that, quote,</p>
<p>all races are equally smart, the notion, quote, that people who score higher on IQ tests are</p>
<p>in some sense superior human beings is, quote, creepy.</p>
<p>He also disputes being an outspoken advocate for slavery, though he has argued that some</p>
<p>races are more suited for slavery than others, quote, it should be obvious that although</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a white nationalist, I am not exactly allergic to the stuff.</p>
<p>Yarvin wrote in a post that linked approvingly of, I don&rsquo;t know these people, Steve Saylor.</p>
<p>Steve Saylor, yeah, he&rsquo;s from.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor and other racialists.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>Okay, so like, one of my questions is.</p>
<p>Let me just say one sentence.</p>
<p>In the same way that you had, you mentioned that guy earlier who was defending some aspects</p>
<p>of communism, and that is, in some context, acceptable when you think about it, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this should be radioactive.</p>
<p>The fact that he is engaging with these ideas in anything other than this has to be reputed</p>
<p>at all costs is what renders him to a large extent a racist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>There are some topics you can be nuanced and some not, and communism is still a topic that</p>
<p>you can be nuanced about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult, but you can be.</p>
<p>Race and this like talking about slavery and IQ differences based on race is a topic that</p>
<p>I guess is radioactive to a degree where you can&rsquo;t even say anything, even if it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nuanced or not even like making a point, it&rsquo;s like touching it as you make another point.</p>
<p>And understandably, you can understand that I&rsquo;m going to steel man their point, because</p>
<p>you can understand the point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re just talking about Hitler.</p>
<p>Once this foot gets in the door that some people are inherently slaves or some people</p>
<p>are inherently better than others, it really quickly collapses, so that would be their</p>
<p>perspective.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what, like if I were to give criticism of his&hellip;</p>
<p>But let me just say one more thing.</p>
<p>Racist is also used to describe Alex Jones.</p>
<p>Alex doesn&rsquo;t talk about race.</p>
<p>Racist is a shorthand for a certain percentage of the population to let you know, do not</p>
<p>bother investing in this person any further.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re off limits.</p>
<p>Yeah, so definitely.</p>
<p>Racism and sexism is a thing that&rsquo;s now used to shut down conversation that&rsquo;s quite absurd</p>
<p>by a small percent of the population.</p>
<p>But Jared Taylor and Steve Saylor, Jared Taylor interviewed him for my book, he would be regarded</p>
<p>in any sense as a racist.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between racist and racialists?</p>
<p>So racialists, I mean, this is splitting hairs and now I&rsquo;m gonna be all radioactive, Jared</p>
<p>Taylor runs something called Amarin and this is, I mean, his perspective is that there</p>
<p>are inherent differences for the races and you cannot live side by side, well, whites</p>
<p>and blacks should not be living side by side.</p>
<p>And by the way, for people who don&rsquo;t know, this is out of context, you have written a</p>
<p>great book that includes some of these concepts called The New Right, which does not include</p>
<p>these concepts, but talks about, well, it&rsquo;s more about the growth of the community around</p>
<p>the alt right and all those kinds of the world.</p>
<p>So and his point about IQ, it&rsquo;s like, if you had a population, the Dutch, right, I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the tallest people on earth.</p>
<p>And if you said, well, the Dutch are the best people on earth, why?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re the tallest, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re a crazy person.</p>
<p>So if someone is scoring low, an individual on an IQ test, that means they&rsquo;re somehow</p>
<p>a lower quality person.</p>
<p>Well, maybe one very specific aspect, but I mean, if they&rsquo;re a good human being, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got friends who are low IQ, all my friends are low IQ, frankly, compared to me, sound</p>
<p>like Trump there for a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you choose.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t have any other choices, no one&rsquo;s gonna be at my level.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the smartest person since Abraham Lincoln that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Unlike him, I actually am honest.</p>
<p>So he is someone who very much swims in heretical ideas.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing, like if you bring up that Aristotle said that some people are born</p>
<p>to be slaves, he wasn&rsquo;t speaking about race, he just meant people&rsquo;s souls.</p>
<p>H.L.</p>
<p>Mencken, who&rsquo;s a great heretic and early 20th century figure, one of his quotes that I say</p>
<p>all the time, which people have seen a lot in this past year, that the average man does</p>
<p>not want to be free, he merely wants to be safe.</p>
<p>That I think speaks, I don&rsquo;t know, I am not familiar with what Mulbug&rsquo;s saying about slavery</p>
<p>because his writing is ponderous, but that certainly is something I think that is undeniable,</p>
<p>that I think more people are realizing there&rsquo;s a large percent of the population that is</p>
<p>actively disinterested in freedom and the more responsibilities it entails.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, really just the word slavery, if you want to make some kind of point or</p>
<p>even think about the topic outside the context of this is a horrible thing that happened</p>
<p>in the United States history.</p>
<p>And other countries history is not unique to us, let&rsquo;s be clear.</p>
<p>This is very important in their slavery going on today and a lot of people argue that sex</p>
<p>trafficking and all those kinds of things, I mean, there&rsquo;s atrocities going on today</p>
<p>that talking about it in a way that&rsquo;s not immediately saying this is the most horrible</p>
<p>thing that happened ever, it&rsquo;s something I think about a lot is like if I want to say</p>
<p>something controversial, I should do so with skill, with care, and only about things I</p>
<p>care about.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s where I would disagree.</p>
<p>When I say things, I often say things that are controversial, or I will say uncontroversial</p>
<p>things in a controversial way, because it&rsquo;s a useful mechanism to alienate people you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want around you.</p>
<p>Because if there are people who are going to be shocked by certain topics, like we should</p>
<p>have ended World War II, like even as a hypothesis, they just clutch their pearls, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, you want the Holocaust to happen?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t discuss most things with you because you&rsquo;re not interested in having a conversation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re interested in your emotional response.</p>
<p>I see things differently, maybe this is a bit of a devil&rsquo;s advocate, but in at least</p>
<p>the modern discourse of like Twitter and social media and so on, I find that if you do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not actually removing the people that are not thoughtful and kind and so on, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually attracting loud people.</p>
<p>Like a small number of them, they come over and start yelling at you, start yelling, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically ruin the party by showing up and just screaming, and so all the thoughtful</p>
<p>people leave.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why you have to be a very heavy blocker.</p>
<p>You have to block people on Twitter because you have to cultivate your audience and have</p>
<p>them, like a lot of times people come at me, I don&rsquo;t care, then they&rsquo;ll start attacking</p>
<p>members of my audience and then I&rsquo;m like, dang, I got to block them because they&rsquo;ve won</p>
<p>this one because I can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know, unnecessarily provoking people feels, this is beta testing, you try</p>
<p>to break the system and see what works, you put up as much pressure as possible.</p>
<p>This is very much computer stuff that you should be able to appreciate, the point being</p>
<p>when you have a program, you&rsquo;re trying to intentionally sit there and do as many mistakes</p>
<p>as you would go wrong.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Is that not common practice?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s a way to see communication with the world, as you say something uncontroversial</p>
<p>in a controversial way and that blocks people.</p>
<p>Or does it trigger them?</p>
<p>Do they roll their eyes?</p>
<p>What is going to be their emotional response?</p>
<p>Are they going to start yelling?</p>
<p>The problem is the reason I can&rsquo;t think like this, or I can&rsquo;t, because I&rsquo;m not sure about</p>
<p>the points I&rsquo;m trying to make, always.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not always 100% sure that I&rsquo;m right about things.</p>
<p>So in being thoughtful, I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;ll turn off with an eloquently phrased or even</p>
<p>incorrect statement, I will do damage that can&rsquo;t be undone in terms of having a good</p>
<p>conversation about a topic.</p>
<p>So I want to be very careful about like, I&rsquo;m not saying afraid, fear is not what I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>I think fear is like not saying something out of fear is at the core of the many of</p>
<p>the problems of the world today.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying be, say stuff with care.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to touch race as a topic, it feels like you really should be deeply, first</p>
<p>have a point to make, like you really care about a point you want to make, and second,</p>
<p>think deeply about how to say that point in a way that communicates it the best.</p>
<p>And touching, I would say, listen, on your show, which is great, I mean, I&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>say thank you for having Menchus Moberg.</p>
<p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the name of the show.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>A couple of times, it&rsquo;s great to sort of get him to in this loose way to talk about different</p>
<p>kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we talked about race at all.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just bringing it back to what you were asking, which is if you read the Wikipedia,</p>
<p>the perspective is going to be this guy talks about slavery constantly, where it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>disproportionate to his work.</p>
<p>But even on your show, you can tell even not outside of the race stuff that he&rsquo;s not ultra</p>
<p>careful about, he&rsquo;s not nuanced.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not afraid to say something just like, I would say, let me just criticize him, my</p>
<p>face is not used as me, carelessly say something controversial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying he doesn&rsquo;t go, that makes him, it&rsquo;s a very different thing than somebody</p>
<p>who on purpose says something controversial stuff, like Milo Annapolis, sorry, I forgot</p>
<p>Milo, whatever his name is.</p>
<p>Which is really nice to see that he&rsquo;s a genuine person who&rsquo;s thoughtful, he doesn&rsquo;t mean to,</p>
<p>but he just carelessly seems to say things that I feel like damaged the rest of his body</p>
<p>of work.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really speak for him, but I would guess his point is once you&rsquo;re swimming in</p>
<p>this kind of worldview, you&rsquo;re going to be anathema already.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no pleasing these people, so why bother trying?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s a deeply, that&rsquo;s a black pill way of seeing the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not black pilled at all, because it&rsquo;s a cynical way that these people, so it&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a very kind of way of thinking, I&rsquo;ll say whatever I want, whoever comes along</p>
<p>with me.</p>
<p>You just earlier said yourself that race, racism has been weaponized as a way to shut</p>
<p>down conversation.</p>
<p>So I think his perspective would be, I am so outside the mainstream in my worldview</p>
<p>that I know I&rsquo;m going to be called racism, racist.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no point in trying to be nuanced because I&rsquo;m already going to get the scarlet</p>
<p>letter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just disagree with that because for example, I am one person that he turned off</p>
<p>by his carelessness, and I think I should be a good target.</p>
<p>I should be somebody.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, he, it&rsquo;s very convenient to think that there&rsquo;s ridiculous people out</p>
<p>there, which they are, who call everybody racist and sexist currently.</p>
<p>And then you can&rsquo;t please them.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not even going to try, no, but there&rsquo;s like this gray area of people that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>listen to the outreach culture, whatever that I don&rsquo;t, this Wikipedia article means nothing</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to, I&rsquo;m more, I&rsquo;m just seeing this careless person.</p>
<p>And if he&rsquo;s going to be careless about a race like this, I feel like if I walk along with</p>
<p>him long enough, I&rsquo;m going to catch the carelessness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lose like, I&rsquo;ll defend your perspective better than you can.</p>
<p>This is good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking notes.</p>
<p>I talked to Eric Weinstein after you guys talked about me on your show.</p>
<p>We had a good conversation.</p>
<p>He invited me on his show.</p>
<p>That would be an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>And we got on the phone and his concern, fairly, he goes, I don&rsquo;t want you to come on my show</p>
<p>for the purposes of clowning me.</p>
<p>And I would never do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It would never.</p>
<p>He might not be aware of who you are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he wants to feel me out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you know, when he hears troll, it can mean a lot of different things.</p>
<p>And I, we had a very conversation and very much was very clear that that&rsquo;s not where</p>
<p>the conversation would go.</p>
<p>But I think when you are going to be on someone&rsquo;s show, there is a responsibility that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to have to pay a cost for having you as their guests.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re perceived, if you were put off by how he was in that live streams or two,</p>
<p>I did like, I understand where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s very, very bright, but you have a very, you have a different audience than</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going for something different than I am.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Like in my interest, the sense of.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t feel safe with him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t feel safe with him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really boring line for me.</p>
<p>I think I would like to actually talk to him one day, Alex Jones has crossed the other</p>
<p>line for me.</p>
<p>Well, you could do what you could do with me, tape the episode and then never release</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s one of those things will be when there&rsquo;s finally they&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>a history channel documentary about you and I and how it all went wrong.</p>
<p>Like the cult that we started and then everybody killed themselves.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a, we&rsquo;ll release it then because it&rsquo;ll be like unseen footage.</p>
<p>This is how it started is it&rsquo;ll be black and white in a basement somewhere in New York.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s basement.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explain so much.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I spoke to Yaron Brooke about objectivism and Ayn Rand, he, he kind of argued, he highlighted</p>
<p>difference between capitalism and anarchism as around the topic of violence and the, that</p>
<p>having government be the sort of the, the negative way to say it is like having a monopoly</p>
<p>on violence, but basically being the arbiter of, or the, the people that making sure that</p>
<p>violence doesn&rsquo;t get out of hand.</p>
<p>That would, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>2020 showed that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s great at that.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Well, what, what&rsquo;s, okay.</p>
<p>Without.</p>
<p>This is him with a straight face making that argument.</p>
<p>Good work Yaron.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, can you with a straight face argue for the idea that in anarchism, violence would</p>
<p>not get out of hand?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>For one thing, if your worst argument against that, one of my little quotes is what are</p>
<p>presented as the strongest arguments against anarchism are inevitably description of the</p>
<p>Strasquo.</p>
<p>So the argument is under anarchism, you know, you&rsquo;d have warlords, you know, killing people</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d have, you know, whoever&rsquo;s strongest gets to just take over a neighborhood.</p>
<p>Well, we have that now.</p>
<p>We saw that the police are perfectly comfortable disarming the population.</p>
<p>And then when they try to protect themselves or punished, they&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re happy to stand</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you can only have that happen if you have a monopoly.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re like, let&rsquo;s suppose you had a television stations, right?</p>
<p>And CBS said, you know what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to broadcast.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to broadcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to watch any of these other channels.</p>
<p>So the problem with having monopoly is everyone has to be dependent on this issue.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s amazing about minarchism, which objectivists are, is they will argue that government is</p>
<p>really, really bad at everything it does and it touches.</p>
<p>Therefore it has to be in charge of the most important stuff.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not therefore, but, but there is a thing that&rsquo;s fundamentally different</p>
<p>than all the other things.</p>
<p>And Yaron Brook also said that no government has, this is on your show, has ever worked</p>
<p>in the way he&rsquo;s proposing.</p>
<p>Now objectivism, Ayn Rand&rsquo;s philosophy is based on objective reality.</p>
<p>And what she posited is you look and study the facts of nature, facts of reality and</p>
<p>deduce things accordingly.</p>
<p>And she very much regards herself as part of the Aristotelian tradition, as opposed</p>
<p>to the Platonist tradition, where the idea precedes reality and the idea is more real</p>
<p>than what we see around us.</p>
<p>So what he&rsquo;s saying is all the data, according to him, contradicts his argument, but still</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to make this imaginary government that has never existed and there&rsquo;s no evidence</p>
<p>that it can exist.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about objective law, to have access to the legal system, which is something we</p>
<p>want.</p>
<p>And just in terms of selling disputes, when you have a government monopoly, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be more expensive, more difficult for poor people.</p>
<p>The cost of hiring a lawyer is more expensive than hiring a surgeon.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say with a straight face, this is the only way or the best way.</p>
<p>And the other thing is the argument for objectivism, against anarchism, they have this stupid</p>
<p>claim it&rsquo;s like, what if you&rsquo;re a member of one security company and I&rsquo;m a member of another</p>
<p>and we have a dispute and one shows up the door.</p>
<p>What happens now?</p>
<p>As if this is some insuperable argument.</p>
<p>Well, we have that on earth.</p>
<p>Every country is in a state of anarchism regarding every other country.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a world government.</p>
<p>So what happens if a Canadian kills an American in Mexico?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I bet you don&rsquo;t have an idea.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m sure of is that system has been worked out ahead of time between the three countries</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been worked out in such a way that you and I don&rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Same thing with cell phone companies.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m on Sprint, you&rsquo;re on Metro PCS and I call you, who pays?</p>
<p>Does Sprint pay you?</p>
<p>Do they split the difference?</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s no objective way that one has to work, but the thing is companies</p>
<p>who have auto accidents, they have arbitrage all the time.</p>
<p>Like if I run into you, they work it out and it never reaches our desk.</p>
<p>So the only thing that cops are good at is keeping people, at any government monopoly,</p>
<p>is forcing people to be their customers by keeping them unsafe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few things I&rsquo;d like to say there to just explore some of these ideas.</p>
<p>So one is in terms of Canadian and Mexico and so on, that it does, something has been</p>
<p>worked out perhaps.</p>
<p>Not perhaps.</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>Do you know for sure that if there&rsquo;s a point I&rsquo;m trying to make, so let&rsquo;s say for sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been worked out.</p>
<p>There was a point in history where it wasn&rsquo;t worked out.</p>
<p>To work, to come to a place of stability, there has to first be some instability.</p>
<p>So when you first, like for every kind of situation, they&rsquo;re like dispute over space,</p>
<p>like who gets to own Mars, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>For it, and then these different competing institutions will have to figure it out.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s the concern with anarchism, I think, or with any kind of interaction.</p>
<p>You said brilliantly that there&rsquo;s an anarchism relative to the, there&rsquo;s no one world government.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Alex Jones enters the chat, but the fear is that there&rsquo;s going to be an instability that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t converge towards some stable place.</p>
<p>That is not the fear.</p>
<p>That is the goal under Ayn Rand&rsquo;s philosophy.</p>
<p>Markets have something what they always talk about as being creatively destructive, which</p>
<p>means you look at something that&rsquo;s been happening for a very long time.</p>
<p>Every generation, every innovator starts chipping away at it.</p>
<p>He finds better ways, marginal improvement or marginal, or it doesn&rsquo;t work and he goes</p>
<p>broke.</p>
<p>When government tries to implement improvement, we all have to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>When an innovator does, it&rsquo;s a huge asymmetry.</p>
<p>If it hurts, it only hurts him.</p>
<p>If it succeeds, he becomes rich and we all profit as a consequence.</p>
<p>But the fear of anarchism, I think, is that it will be non creative destruction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be just destruction, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the instability.</p>
<p>Stability is one of these words that sounds objective, but has no real meaning.</p>
<p>What field has stability?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you want stability.</p>
<p>Relationships.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about medicine.</p>
<p>Stability means we&rsquo;re not going to invent new diseases or new treatments, right?</p>
<p>If you mean stability in terms of a baseline of security, we have that already.</p>
<p>Very few relationships turn violent.</p>
<p>Under an anarchist system, look at it right now.</p>
<p>If you look at a bar full of drunken young males full of testosterone, if you look at</p>
<p>a hotel where everyone is not native to the area, those are both far safer than the places</p>
<p>that the government has taken upon itself to protect you.</p>
<p>The parks, the alleyways, the streets, the subways.</p>
<p>We have right now a comparison of which is better at keeping people safe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very obvious that when something is private and under someone&rsquo;s control, and</p>
<p>there would be layers of there&rsquo;d be more police, but they wouldn&rsquo;t be a government monopoly.</p>
<p>The store would have someone, the street would have someone, and you&rsquo;d have your own personal</p>
<p>security that would be attached to your phone.</p>
<p>Having security as a function of geography as opposed to a function of you as an individual</p>
<p>is a landline technology in a post cell phone world.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s possible to have, psychologically speaking, as an individual among the masses,</p>
<p>to have a sense of security even though there&rsquo;s not a centralized thing at the bottom of the</p>
<p>whole thing?</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s not a set of laws that are enforced based on geography like we have nations now.</p>
<p>You can have a set of laws that are enforced in some kind of emergent agreed upon way.</p>
<p>So like, basically, I want to go to a hotel and trust that I&rsquo;ll be able to get a room</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s going to break down the door and I don&rsquo;t know, take all my vodka.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a different way.</p>
<p>If you were worried about a hotel having bedbugs, that&rsquo;s not something the government&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not an unrealistic concern.</p>
<p>Are there mechanisms right now that you can undertake to make sure that&rsquo;s not the case?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it would be the same thing with, I want to make sure I go to a hotel that has security.</p>
<p>It would be exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another example, kosher food.</p>
<p>People who keep kosher, Jews who keep kosher, their food has to be prepared in a certain</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>It has to meet higher rabbinical standards, right?</p>
<p>If you look at food, it will have that certification, the K, and there&rsquo;s even competition there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the K and there&rsquo;s the stricter U letter.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t notice it because they&rsquo;re looking for it.</p>
<p>You would have companies certifying different locales for their level of security.</p>
<p>And it would take an hour to have an app that would, just like when you have toll roads,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That would tell you you&rsquo;re approaching an unsafe area, you&rsquo;re not going to be covered</p>
<p>by us or, and you could have it color coded very easily.</p>
<p>We could do this today.</p>
<p>But the thing is, you&rsquo;re exactly correct, but there&rsquo;s an assumption of you&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>in a, okay, you can give me a different word than stability, but you&rsquo;re already in a place</p>
<p>where the forces of the market or whatever can operate.</p>
<p>The worry is like, initially, you might not have enough stability to where you can choose</p>
<p>one place over the other based on the security that they provide.</p>
<p>We already have different types of security here because we have federal government, we</p>
<p>have state governments and we have local governments.</p>
<p>So and these often contradict each other.</p>
<p>So the idea of the implausibility of having different security companies and having it</p>
<p>be unstable or impossible, we already have a very rough example of it happening in real</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>So how all of it started, the idea of, especially with Yaron, is like it all started with government</p>
<p>monopoly of violence saying like, no kids, don&rsquo;t let violence get out of hand.</p>
<p>So like how do&hellip;</p>
<p>We had a civil war where half the country was slaughtered.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the display of the government not having a monopoly on the violence, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s the split.</p>
<p>They had such a monopoly on the violence in the North that it could draft people to fight</p>
<p>others that they didn&rsquo;t even care about.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a South.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the government splitting because this is giant iceberg like splitting.</p>
<p>The argument is that you would have something like a civil war much more often under anarchism.</p>
<p>First of all, if you had a civil war much more often, we don&rsquo;t have that with car companies,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a company that says, I refuse to pay or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not violence.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m playing&hellip;</p>
<p>Hold on, let me finish.</p>
<p>It is violence because if I&rsquo;m a company and I&rsquo;m saying that my cars can run over yours</p>
<p>with no consequences, this is a rough analog, why has that not happened?</p>
<p>Now in terms of having security system, if I am free, just like switching cell phone</p>
<p>to go from one provider to another and this one company as part of its payment doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want $50 a month, $100 a month, wants my son, I&rsquo;m not going to be a member of this security</p>
<p>company unless in that case we&rsquo;re dealing with something like a Pearl Harbor or foreign</p>
<p>invasion where it&rsquo;s like all hands on deck.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go by evidence.</p>
<p>How many places do have evidence of that you can have at a large scale?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s absolutely in a large scale.</p>
<p>Because it feels like once you don&rsquo;t know the person.</p>
<p>What about eBay?</p>
<p>eBay is an example of anarchism in practice.</p>
<p>I am selling something to someone whose name I don&rsquo;t even know in a country that is nowhere</p>
<p>proximate to me and eBay acts as the arbiter.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t get the money after I get screwed over, but that&rsquo;s far less than the</p>
<p>taxation that I have to give to the federal government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great point, but it&rsquo;s in the space of finance.</p>
<p>If I could, if on eBay you could also commit violence.</p>
<p>Theft is violence.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you give me 10 grand for a car and I don&rsquo;t deliver anything, you&rsquo;ve stolen 10</p>
<p>grand from me.</p>
<p>Yes, but there&rsquo;s something uniquely problematic to being stabbed or shot.</p>
<p>The reason you&rsquo;re stabbed or shot is because the government, despite its contract, is refusing</p>
<p>to allow second amendment rights to be implemented among the citizenry and the people who are</p>
<p>making that the case are the cops.</p>
<p>They are the ones who are the traitors to the constitution and should be regarded as</p>
<p>such.</p>
<p>Whereas private companies are far more amenable to market pressures than the state is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strong argument, but let&rsquo;s actually just briefly mention the scale thing.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you think we should talk about scale?</p>
<p>Because if you had anarchism just in Vermont or just in Brooklyn, well, fine.</p>
<p>The people make the argument you need anarchism or else China&rsquo;s going to invade, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like saying what, do these little countries don&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>Does San Salvador not exist?</p>
<p>Some of them are violent, some of them are not, but the point is they&rsquo;re not all at moments</p>
<p>notice about to be invaded.</p>
<p>Kuwait&rsquo;s an example of this.</p>
<p>Kuwait was invaded by Iraq and very quickly all the big countries who are interested in</p>
<p>having your stability, safe space, got involved and kicked him out of Kuwait.</p>
<p>If you had this company that was waging war on the population, it seems quite likely that</p>
<p>the other organization would get together and put a stop to this because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>in a position to provide this service of security to their customers.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All of this is brilliant, but didn&rsquo;t you just say that we are actually in a state of anarchism</p>
<p>relative to other countries?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t this what emerges?</p>
<p>This is what, aren&rsquo;t we actually living in a state of anarchism where we all have agreed?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t agreed to anything.</p>
<p>So the basic criticism you have is you&rsquo;re born on a geographical area and you&rsquo;re forced</p>
<p>to have signed a bunch of stuff just by being born in a particular place.</p>
<p>So really, if you could just much easier choose which space of ideas you associated with,</p>
<p>that would be actually a state of anarchism.</p>
<p>And you could have like a military that you sign up with.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re certainly not putting people in prison to get raped because they&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>drugs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re certainly not allowing everyone else on the street who wants to be there.</p>
<p>Can we say something nice about Ayn Rand?</p>
<p>I can talk about nice things about her all day.</p>
<p>I own her copy of the Fountainhead, you know.</p>
<p>What to you is Ayn Rand&rsquo;s best idea, one that you find impactful, insightful, useful for</p>
<p>us in modern society that you think about?</p>
<p>That your life has meaning and productive work is your highest value.</p>
<p>And that you shouldn&rsquo;t apologize, and this is something I despise, you shouldn&rsquo;t apologize</p>
<p>for saying, I want to be happy and I&rsquo;m going to work toward that.</p>
<p>And that, there&rsquo;s a few others, that you owe nobody else, some random stranger, a second</p>
<p>of your time.</p>
<p>You see this a lot on Twitter and social media, people like demanding a debate or demanding</p>
<p>you act a certain way and engage with them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t owe them anything.</p>
<p>So I think those are some of her best ideas.</p>
<p>And she teaches you how to think.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand does not have all the answers, but she has all the questions.</p>
<p>Do you think, what do you think about the whole selfishness thing?</p>
<p>I mean, are you triggered by the word selfishness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really unfortunate what she does because you were just talking earlier about Moldbug</p>
<p>being carelessly, this is indefensible in my opinion.</p>
<p>So she talks about the virtue of selfishness and she claims that when people talk about</p>
<p>selfishness, they mean concern primarily with the self, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When people talk about selfishness, they mean in a sociopathic way, concern exclusively</p>
<p>with oneself.</p>
<p>They mean like, oh, if someone is dying on the street, I&rsquo;m not going to even waste a</p>
<p>second saving them because I&rsquo;m selfish.</p>
<p>So she sets up this complete caricature of the term.</p>
<p>When she&rsquo;s attacking selflessness in her best sense is when there are people who have no</p>
<p>sense of self, they have no values of their own, they have no goals of their own, everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in their mind is gotten secondhand from the culture at large and there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>unique or special from their perspective worth fighting for.</p>
<p>So when she attacks, when she advocates for the self, she basically means self development,</p>
<p>self improvement and achievement.</p>
<p>So I think that word choice is really false and needlessly off putting.</p>
<p>Yeah, controversial perhaps for the purpose of being controversial, I don&rsquo;t know, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not accurate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what people mean by selfishness.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say it&rsquo;s one of the reasons probably her philosophy is not as much adopted</p>
<p>or thought about is like, it&rsquo;s funny, like the use of words means something.</p>
<p>Exactly as you said, that&rsquo;s my criticism, I mentioned small bug, which could be incorrect</p>
<p>criticism by the way, so I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>Can we talk about some modern day chaos and politics?</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>I hate chaos.</p>
<p>Speaking of your hatred for chaos, let&rsquo;s talk about secession.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I was the first one on this trip.</p>
<p>Yeah, you were, well, the Civil War beat you to it, but.</p>
<p>Sure, in contemporary times.</p>
<p>In contemporary times you were, you&rsquo;re on this.</p>
<p>Can you talk about what is the idea of secession, what are the odds that it might happen, what</p>
<p>does it mean for the United States in some way for different states to secede?</p>
<p>Sure, America&rsquo;s been one country with several cultures since the beginning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no reason for someone, this goes back to the anarchist idea, if you</p>
<p>despise Donald Trump, which is your prerogative, if you think Joe Biden is a clown, which is</p>
<p>your prerogative, there&rsquo;s absolutely no reason for you to be governed by someone you disapprove</p>
<p>of.</p>
<p>This is an incoherent, nonsensical concept.</p>
<p>The only reason we even take it as a hypothesis is that we&rsquo;re trained to the contrary since</p>
<p>kindergarten.</p>
<p>A secession, I don&rsquo;t know along what lines, but increasingly it&rsquo;s becoming harder and</p>
<p>harder for people to have conversations.</p>
<p>I think social media, and this is something people despise social media for, I think this</p>
<p>is something that social media has done well, which I&rsquo;m advocating for, is it tends to</p>
<p>kind of run through ideas through like an evolutionary process and drive them to the</p>
<p>logical conclusion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to be a moderate online because there&rsquo;s going to be people pushing</p>
<p>through your ideas through several cycles, and then you&rsquo;re going to end up at some kind</p>
<p>of more pure, or if you want to dislike it, extreme perspective.</p>
<p>Having these different pockets, it&rsquo;s not really governable because people fundamentally have</p>
<p>different worldviews.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what secession would look like.</p>
<p>I think the number is really increasing at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>I do not think the number of supporters.</p>
<p>I think the claim that this can only be accomplished through violence is false.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>Just like any divorce doesn&rsquo;t have to involve beating your ex husband or ex wife.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to this becoming a reality far quicker than I ever</p>
<p>expected.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a value of competing worldviews being forced to be in the same</p>
<p>space?</p>
<p>Yes, but within a context.</p>
<p>So we can agree if group one thinks A, B, and C are the fundamental aspects of the worldview</p>
<p>and argue within that, and group two thinks D, E, and F and argue within that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have a lot of argument within those space.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s fundamental differences in worldview, there&rsquo;s no reason to be, especially</p>
<p>when each views the other as completely coherent and unreasonable.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a line of fundamentally different worldviews along which a secession</p>
<p>will happen in the United States?</p>
<p>Is there something that emerges to you as a set of ideas that are like, what do you</p>
<p>call that?</p>
<p>That you can&rsquo;t come to an agreement over?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>Like with the masks, I think there&rsquo;s just two fundamental perspective and each one thinks</p>
<p>the other is insane and also deadly and destructive.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see how there&rsquo;s any discourse on this topic.</p>
<p>So on the left, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s left versus right.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s people who are pro risk versus people who are risk averse.</p>
<p>Yeah, so risk averse.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like a hope for the comfort of the sort of a centralized science giving</p>
<p>the truth and then everybody must follow the truth of the proper way to behave.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s on the other side, a distrust of any kind of centralized institutions of</p>
<p>anybody who might use like control to try to gain greater and greater power and masks</p>
<p>are a symbol of that.</p>
<p>And even if masks are or are not a effective way of stopping the virus, which is really</p>
<p>unfortunate to me from a perspective, I happen to be on a survey paper about masks.</p>
<p>Like people don&rsquo;t seem to care about the data or the so on.</p>
<p>This has become just a nice point on which to then highlight the difference between the</p>
<p>two sides.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds kind of on the face kind of ridiculous that the succession would occur</p>
<p>over masks.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m saying this is an example of something where there&rsquo;s a clean break.</p>
<p>And risk averse versus someone who&rsquo;s risk seeking, these are just two fundamentally</p>
<p>different perspectives.</p>
<p>Do you want to have an NHS or do you have one of a market based healthcare system?</p>
<p>You can make very valid arguments for both.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason for everyone to be under one.</p>
<p>But do you think that&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s, you think that&rsquo;s irreconcilable, if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the word, that that&rsquo;s not in the space of ideas that you can have in the same room together</p>
<p>and they fight at each other and ultimately make progress like that.</p>
<p>That succession is the more effective way to proceed forward.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But do you see a possible world with no is the answer, meaning I know you say yes, because</p>
<p>you kind of lean on the side of freedom and anarchism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like you make, you want to make, let me make an argument in terms of divorce, which is</p>
<p>in your worldview or your intuition is you want to make secession as frictionless as</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And not just like states or whatever, just like you want to choose, you want to be free.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And peaceful.</p>
<p>Let me make my authoritarian, Russian, okay, Papa Stalin argument in terms of relationships.</p>
<p>Like when shit goes wrong in a relationship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your language.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a place for one Stalin at this table.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to be Lenin.</p>
<p>Or you get to be like Merkel as our previous discussion with Putin.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let me unleash the hounds.</p>
<p>You know, you want to work through some of the troubles before you get divorced.</p>
<p>Like you want to do the work in relationships sometimes, like it goes up and down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 200 plus years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>But in the, listen, okay, so it&rsquo;s not a one night stand, but you know.</p>
<p>Look at Trump.</p>
<p>This I don&rsquo;t see the middle ground.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s either a complete calamity buffoon, or he&rsquo;s been the first great president we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had in like many, many years.</p>
<p>So you think that there&rsquo;s something different now than it was 20 years ago?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Social media and access to information.</p>
<p>And the division will only increase, you think?</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>So Trump is not an accident of history.</p>
<p>So they thought Trump was the river, but he was the dam.</p>
<p>Trump was the dam.</p>
<p>They thought he was the river.</p>
<p>So in that analogy, Trump being gone makes things worse.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For that perspective, because now things are really going to hit the fan.</p>
<p>So what are the odds of secession?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And my desperate hope is that it&rsquo;s peaceful, but I think the number of people who are becoming</p>
<p>very comfortable with the violence is making me very unsettled.</p>
<p>So I see words as violence and your Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Hiroshima times a million.</p>
<p>Sometimes I curl up in the corner crying after I check your Twitter feed.</p>
<p>So in all seriousness, you think it&rsquo;s possible to do nonviolent secession?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Look at Brexit.</p>
<p>Brexit was a secession.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right, so you can have a civil war did not need to be fought.</p>
<p>That would have been a nonviolent secession.</p>
<p>And if you worry about slavery, you could have bought off all the slaves, import them</p>
<p>to the North.</p>
<p>It still would have been cheaper and less loss of life and probably better for race</p>
<p>relations.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough history to, to wonder about like how the civil war could have been</p>
<p>avoided.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s how is a well conversation.</p>
<p>So like, no, no.</p>
<p>If they want to secede, say, look, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to let you secede, but you have to end slavery.</p>
<p>They seceded because of slavery.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like this, some circles of conservatism have this myth that, oh, it wasn&rsquo;t about slavery,</p>
<p>it was about state&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>Well, if you go back, every state, when they seceded, released the press release.</p>
<p>And they said explicitly, we&rsquo;re doing this because of slavery.</p>
<p>So that is an abomination that needs to be taken care of.</p>
<p>But other countries have ended slavery peacefully.</p>
<p>One of the ways to do it is pay them by all, and we ended up doing this after the war.</p>
<p>I think the South people got reparations, the slave owners, it was just insane.</p>
<p>Bring them North.</p>
<p>You want to go to Canada, whatever.</p>
<p>And you agree.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s our peace treaty.</p>
<p>Because the people who died weren&rsquo;t the slave owners.</p>
<p>It was white trash.</p>
<p>And it was, that&rsquo;s who always, and I hate that that&rsquo;s the term, I can&rsquo;t think of a better</p>
<p>one, but that&rsquo;s who always ends up fighting these wars often disproportionately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s poor people and uneducated people.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I did not regard them as cannon fodder.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>So what would it look like?</p>
<p>There would be two founding documents?</p>
<p>Yeah, they had their constitution.</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t know the history of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, they had a constitution, but it was much more decentralized.</p>
<p>If secession doesn&rsquo;t happen, you said that Donald Trump was the dam, not the river.</p>
<p>That sounds like Walt Whitman or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Are you flirting with me?</p>
<p>You know us, we don&rsquo;t flirt.</p>
<p>We just club and drag you to the cave.</p>
<p>We hammer and sickle.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to know about the sickle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good cob, bad cob.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad cup for a sickle.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think 2024 looks like in terms of the candidates?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to Ted Cruz versus Mike Pence, because they&rsquo;re both very good</p>
<p>at debate.</p>
<p>That would be interesting to see how they differentiate themselves.</p>
<p>But honestly, I don&rsquo;t, I mean, things are going to get really ugly really soon.</p>
<p>What about Donald Trump coming back?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to do it.</p>
<p>So things, in my opinion, I think things are going to be really, really crazy in 2021.</p>
<p>And talking about the dam being gone, like 2021.</p>
<p>So this year coming up.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be complete.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be complete mayhem.</p>
<p>What do you think, like prediction wise, and this is empirical.</p>
<p>What do you think Donald Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed looks like in 2021?</p>
<p>Like if we&rsquo;re at the end of 2021, we&rsquo;ll look back and see like, what was the, you know,</p>
<p>Obama gate exclamation points or we won.</p>
<p>He is going to be, for the first time in history, holding the Republican party accountable to</p>
<p>the base.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had that happen before.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going to be holding their feet to the fire, radicalizing them.</p>
<p>And given that they have the Senate, where it&rsquo;s going to be 50 50, the Democrats have</p>
<p>a three seat majority in the House.</p>
<p>This is not a governing coalition for either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be complete mayhem.</p>
<p>What does that actually look like?</p>
<p>What are the key values you think that he&rsquo;s going to try to push?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just going to be very contrarian.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to be holding them accountable in terms of budgeting, even though he never</p>
<p>did that as president.</p>
<p>I think in terms of some kind of nominations, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>This is the first time since Nixon, 50 years and things weren&rsquo;t as politicized then, where</p>
<p>an incoming president doesn&rsquo;t have control of the Senate.</p>
<p>The Senate has the vote over cabinet positions.</p>
<p>I do not see a possibility of them not trying to pick a fight on one or two of these nominations.</p>
<p>And especially as revenge for Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>This is going to get very bloody very quickly.</p>
<p>And I think Mitch McConnell, there&rsquo;s a sadistic side to him.</p>
<p>He revels in being the brakes on the car.</p>
<p>And I think the base, it&rsquo;s just going to be throwing just, they&rsquo;re going to want some</p>
<p>bone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, we eliminated this one person.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to get really ugly really quickly.</p>
<p>You see it being quite divisive, like the division increasing, not stabilizing or decreasing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be doing my part.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ll be doing my part, but I&rsquo;m trying to do my part and like trying to be like,</p>
<p>to me, the division is shouting over people like Elon Musk, people who are actually building</p>
<p>stuff and like accomplishing things in this world in terms of like.</p>
<p>Elon said he took the red pill.</p>
<p>No, see, you&rsquo;re talking about the, I&rsquo;m talking about, forget Elon, SpaceX and Tesla and actually</p>
<p>the good sides of like some of the things that Google is doing.</p>
<p>Like actually building things, like making the world&rsquo;s information searchable, all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like all this stuff, you know, making actually the world a better place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of technologies that are increasing our quality of life.</p>
<p>All this, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I feel like they get like not much credit or in our public discourse because of the</p>
<p>division.</p>
<p>The division is just like, it&rsquo;s clouding our ability to concentrate on what&rsquo;s awesome about</p>
<p>this world.</p>
<p>Well, you know what would eliminate the division, right?</p>
<p>Succession.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s hard for me to disagree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to disagree because, but at the same time, succession, I&rsquo;m a romantic</p>
<p>at heart and divorce breaks my heart.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>But do you want to live in a country where Joe Rogan is regarded as an example of someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s spreading white supremacy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, but see, I feel like that&rsquo;s not the country we live in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>The New York Times did it, the cathedral does it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Well, the cathedral is, okay, the cathedral, I guess you can maybe define the cathedral,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like the centralized institutions that have like a story that they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to sell and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is mold books concept, but yeah, they basically are set the limits of permissible</p>
<p>discourse and create a narrative for the population to follow.</p>
<p>But to me, that&rsquo;s a minority of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, minorities always controlling everything in any country, the vast majority of the masses</p>
<p>have no thought.</p>
<p>But minorities can be overthrown and the.</p>
<p>Sure, the circulation of the elites, yeah.</p>
<p>The way the, no, no, no, and that&rsquo;s why the, what progress looks like is ridiculous people</p>
<p>take power.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then they get annoying and new ridiculous people that are a little bit better overthrow</p>
<p>the previous.</p>
<p>No, I think progress happens despite the people who are in power, not because of them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so why is this a succession?</p>
<p>So is it always about overthrowing the powerful?</p>
<p>Is that how progress happens?</p>
<p>No, I think progress happens despite the powerful.</p>
<p>The powerful are going to do what&rsquo;s in their power to maintain their power and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to fight innovation because it&rsquo;s a threat to their control.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be the New York Times of the world, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be those, those people that haven&rsquo;t heard.</p>
<p>Sure, let them have their own country.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s two countries.</p>
<p>One has Joe Rogan, the other one has the New York Times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>It just geographically doesn&rsquo;t map out very well, but culturally, yes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just cultural stuff.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a layer of public discourse.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean like that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re operating under now, but there&rsquo;s actual like progress</p>
<p>being made, like roads being built, hospitals being run, all those kinds of things like</p>
<p>different innovations.</p>
<p>That seems like secession is counterproductive to that.</p>
<p>Right, because one country would have all the roads and the other would have all the</p>
<p>hospitals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not the point I&rsquo;m trying to make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it just feels like the division that we&rsquo;re experiencing in the space of ideas</p>
<p>could be constructive and productive for, for building better roads and better hospitals</p>
<p>as opposed to like using that division to separate the countries.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all going to have to solve the same problems, it feels like.</p>
<p>Sure but they can solve them differently and compete that way.</p>
<p>Mass is a great example.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing that right now.</p>
<p>Different countries have different mass mandates and things like this.</p>
<p>And the competition within the same structure, within the same founding documents and same</p>
<p>institutions is not effective, you think?</p>
<p>As effective as separating.</p>
<p>It is effective but there is a certain point, which I think we have long passed, where there</p>
<p>is not a governing consensus ideologically or culturally.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a fun question, okay?</p>
<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>Mars.</p>
<p>God of war.</p>
<p>The other one.</p>
<p>The planet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, there is a kind of captivating notion that we might, I&rsquo;m excited by it, the human</p>
<p>being stepping foot on Mars.</p>
<p>That to me is, it&rsquo;s like one of those things that feels like it&rsquo;s, why do we want to engage</p>
<p>in space exploration?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a little bit with Elon Musk on this, which is, it&rsquo;s obvious that eventually if</p>
<p>human species is to survive, it&rsquo;s going to have to innovate in ways that includes the</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a lot of things we&rsquo;re not able to predict yet that if we push ourselves to</p>
<p>the limits of space, like new ideas will come that&rsquo;ll be obvious a hundred years from now</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re not even imagining now.</p>
<p>And colonizing Mars, that idea that seems ridiculous, exceptionally difficult, impossibly</p>
<p>expensive is something that is actually going to be seen as obvious in retrospect and that</p>
<p>we should engage in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just to contextualize things.</p>
<p>The fun idea and experiment from a philosophical and political sense is what kind of government,</p>
<p>how do you orchestrate a government when you go to Mars, like we don&rsquo;t get too many chances</p>
<p>like this, but how do you build new systems, not in place of old ones, but in a place with</p>
<p>no system previous have existed?</p>
<p>I think organically, I hate that word, but that&rsquo;s the correct word.</p>
<p>You would have to figure out, I mean, that&rsquo;s how America was built.</p>
<p>You had the, it was a Jamestown colony and they tried to do communism here and it completely</p>
<p>failed and they went to a more free market system with the second wave of colonists is</p>
<p>my understanding.</p>
<p>For Mars, I mean, it depends on the population, who the population was, the number of people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>These are all kind of hypotheticals that I don&rsquo;t really have any good insight in whatsoever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a space person.</p>
<p>I hate astronomy.</p>
<p>Like I hate it.</p>
<p>So a lot of people look up to the stars and they&rsquo;re filled with awe and wonder about the</p>
<p>mystery of the universe and you look up to the stars and you feel what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the earth.</p>
<p>If you look at what&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;d much rather given a choice between Mars and the deep sea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather spend a week at the deep sea and all the life forms that are down there</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re literal aliens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like things that are not literal, but they&rsquo;re unimaginable to us.</p>
<p>Some of the things down there.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment to see when you have 10 people, when you have</p>
<p>a hundred people, how do you build an effective, you know, this is actually really useful for</p>
<p>a company, right?</p>
<p>How do you build an effective company that does things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an obvious, despite everybody being really certain about everything in this, in</p>
<p>this modern world, to me, it&rsquo;s not obvious, like how do you run successfully as a group</p>
<p>of people?</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>It also organic means you have to look at who the people are and tailor the organization</p>
<p>to them as opposed to try to impose something.</p>
<p>But you get to also select people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s not going to be open borders on Mars.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>I was going to say when you have one country, it&rsquo;s all open borders.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re from outer space, right?</p>
<p>Some say they&rsquo;re aliens already there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have to negotiate that.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re aliens.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re aliens to somebody.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re legal aliens.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s alien civilizations out there?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>What do you think is their system of government anarchism?</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re advanced.</p>
<p>Do you honestly think there&rsquo;s intelligent life forms out there?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the math.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible that there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what do you make of all the stories of UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;ve visited earth?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My grandfather was an air traffic controller in the Soviet Union and he said they would</p>
<p>often see these things that were not operating the way we knew vehicles operate.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>So I mean, do you think government is in possession of some, like, what do you think government</p>
<p>is doing with this kind of information?</p>
<p>Do you think somebody has any understanding of UFO sightings or any kind of information</p>
<p>about extraterrestrial life forms that are not known to the public?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s indisputably true.</p>
<p>I think the fact that so many of these sightings are from aerodynamic professionals, like</p>
<p>pilots and things of that nature, they are people who&rsquo;ve seen it all, who are reputable.</p>
<p>If they are on record saying, I&rsquo;ve seen things that don&rsquo;t make sense, and both the Russians</p>
<p>and the Americans thought it was the other one, that says something.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t that be a bigger problem?</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t that be bigger news and a bigger problem if government is in fact hiding it?</p>
<p>I guess, but like, what are they going to do with that information?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Like, if a UFO, if an extraterrestrial spacecraft, which most likely would be like a crappy space,</p>
<p>like it wouldn&rsquo;t be the actual aliens, it would be like some drone probe ship.</p>
<p>AI.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if that, like, what would you do with that information?</p>
<p>As somebody that&rsquo;s in charge of, you know, like you see how badly WHO fumbled the discussion</p>
<p>of masks.</p>
<p>Masks?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Masks is one of them, but everything really in terms of communicating with the public</p>
<p>honestly about what they know, what they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a trivial one.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There certainly feel incompetent at being able to communicate effectively with the public</p>
<p>about something much more difficult, much more full of mystery, like a UFO, a thing,</p>
<p>a piece of material that&rsquo;s out of this earth.</p>
<p>Forget like organic material.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>To me, I just, so from a scientist perspective, it would be beautiful.</p>
<p>It would be inspiring to reveal this to the world.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the mystery and make it completely public.</p>
<p>Share it with China.</p>
<p>Share it with everybody.</p>
<p>I think there is a domino effect where the concern would be what else are you hiding</p>
<p>from us?</p>
<p>And at that point, if you said, no, no, no, this is everything, people wouldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>you and they would, you can&rsquo;t blame them for not believing them.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;d be like, show us the aliens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like, we don&rsquo;t have them.</p>
<p>We just have the craft.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re lying.</p>
<p>Speaking of aliens, offline, you mentioned elves.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And psychedelics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think about psychedelics in terms of the kind of places that can take your mind?</p>
<p>The kind of journey it can take you on.</p>
<p>Like what do you think, what do you think the psychedelics do to the human mind and</p>
<p>what does that say about the capacity of the human mind and just in general, like the mysteries</p>
<p>of all that&rsquo;s out there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we understand what they do.</p>
<p>The way I heard it explained to me is that much of the human mind isn&rsquo;t about receiving</p>
<p>information but blocking information, right?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re so, there&rsquo;s so much data coming in any moment that you basically have to train</p>
<p>yourself to see and to hear only what you want to see and to hear.</p>
<p>And that what psychedelics do is they tear that away and suddenly you&rsquo;re much more aware</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s out there and also you&rsquo;re going to be noticing patterns that you hadn&rsquo;t noticed</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>I know you had that researcher on the show and he kind of discussed this at some length.</p>
<p>I mean, Rogan is probably the person who popularized DMT more than, well, he&rsquo;s obviously the person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s popularized DMT more than anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anyone who had, even the researchers who have anything close to a coherent explanation</p>
<p>of why this drug, which exists everywhere, would have this very specific, very extreme</p>
<p>effect on so many people who are going to be experiencing such bizarre consequences</p>
<p>as a result of it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very interesting that this is talking about the government, you know, the</p>
<p>CIA started experimenting with LSD, they killed one of their own people, drove them to suicide</p>
<p>and there was a lot of research into, Terrence McKenna talks about this, into this field</p>
<p>and then very quickly, once it got into the mainstream, they shut it down, even though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not addictive, it doesn&rsquo;t cause you to go crazy or anything like that and there was</p>
<p>a lot of propaganda against its use, which I think, thankfully, is now somewhat receding.</p>
<p>I think Colorado just legalized mushrooms, something like that and I think it&rsquo;ll be very</p>
<p>interesting to see what happens as a result of this.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the interesting thing is, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be, for certain psychedelics</p>
<p>like psilocybin, like mushrooms, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a lethal dose, which is fascinating,</p>
<p>like Matthew Johnson, the Hopkins professor that you mentioned, I&rsquo;m definitely going to</p>
<p>do one of his studies, it&rsquo;s a really cool way to do what he calls a heroic dose of psilocybin.</p>
<p>Oh, I want to do it, what do I have to do?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>A heroic dose, holy crap.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>How many grams are we talking?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s big.</p>
<p>He says that&hellip;</p>
<p>This is going to have a kick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He says that, I mean, he also studies cocaine, he studies all kinds of drugs and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>the psilocybin is&hellip;</p>
<p>A heroic dose of cocaine kills you.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, so you can&rsquo;t even come close, so he says the problem with studying cocaine</p>
<p>is you have people who are addicted to cocaine or war or so on, you give them the kind of</p>
<p>doses that we can and part of the study is like, it&rsquo;s nothing to them.</p>
<p>Psilocybin is the only one where even daily users or regular users are blown away by the</p>
<p>dose they give them.</p>
<p>So you can go to Russia in your mind, you can go to outer space, maybe you&rsquo;ll become</p>
<p>an astronaut or astronomer after all.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll be Baba Yaga.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let people look that one up.</p>
<p>What is love?</p>
<p>What do you think this thing is like our attachment to other human beings?</p>
<p>And is it something that we should give to just a few people?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>When I was working with DL Hughley in his book, he didn&rsquo;t use the term, but he was describing</p>
<p>like low key depression.</p>
<p>And he talked about how he was in the airport and he noticed a girl had a red dress and</p>
<p>he went up and thanked her and she was like, what are you thanking for?</p>
<p>And he had realized he hadn&rsquo;t registered color in like weeks.</p>
<p>And I think love is like that when you see someone and you just like, oh, like your eyes</p>
<p>are open.</p>
<p>Like this is something I&rsquo;ve never seen before or I want more of this, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It really disorients and reorients your thinking.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you find that like the world is full of that like nonstop?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like a person either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, but when it&rsquo;s in a person, it&rsquo;s a whole other level because it&rsquo;s like, I could have,</p>
<p>this is going to be great for years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, every day it&rsquo;s something new.</p>
<p>I mean, that is, and that is rare.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s rare?</p>
<p>I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Find someone who you could talk to them for years and not run out of things to talk to.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s true for years.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>And know that they really, if you leave the room, they will do right by you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really rare.</p>
<p>Well, from a Russian perspective, you just don&rsquo;t give them another choice.</p>
<p>This is Tavadish New Year, New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>
<p>So you talked about secession and the world burning down and you holding the match at</p>
<p>the end, standing with a big smile on your face.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I was serious.</p>
<p>But let me ask you, if it doesn&rsquo;t include flame and secession and destruction and laughing</p>
<p>malice and makeup and a white suit at the end, how do we bring more kindness and love</p>
<p>to the world in 2021?</p>
<p>Oh, easy.</p>
<p>Be comfortable saying, I want to be happy.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s someone who interjects and gives you attitude, arms lengthen.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people who also want to be happy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a great example.</p>
<p>My buddy Chris Williamson, who I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, he&rsquo;s a podcaster, does Modern Wisdom.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an awesome dude and we became very close friends this past year.</p>
<p>And he was in Dubai recently and he sent me pics from Dubai by the pool, just loving life.</p>
<p>And it took me a week and then it clicked in my head and I&rsquo;m like, you know what?</p>
<p>For some other people, if they saw him under remodel at the pool, they would think this</p>
<p>is him bragging or humble bragging.</p>
<p>And that never entered my head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh man, I&rsquo;m so glad my boy can be having a good time and is sharing his joy</p>
<p>with me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of people you need to surround yourself with, where it never enters their</p>
<p>head to be resentful or anything other than sharing in your bounty.</p>
<p>What makes you happy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy all the time.</p>
<p>And one of the points I made in my life is like, I really hated, I really did not like</p>
<p>to give advice because I feel don&rsquo;t give advice until you know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And to me, what makes me happy is being self actualized.</p>
<p>I am in a position with my career where I could be myself 24 seven, where I never have</p>
<p>to engage in small talk, where I never have to interact with someone I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very blessed to have that.</p>
<p>Very few people have that.</p>
<p>And to have that be not only, to have that be like rewarded and having people find that</p>
<p>something of value to them makes me very, very happy.</p>
<p>But also being an uncle, I have two little nephews.</p>
<p>They make me very, very happy.</p>
<p>Sure my sister&rsquo;s raising them Russian, so they talk like immigrants, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to change that.</p>
<p>We have to dismember her, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That makes me happy.</p>
<p>And to be able to finish this book and know it&rsquo;s going to give people a sense of hope,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really validating.</p>
<p>What are you most grateful for for our conversation today?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stealing my bit.</p>
<p>What am I most grateful for?</p>
<p>I am very grateful that I can come in here not knowing what we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>and know it&rsquo;s not going to be something I have to be on guard about, or I have to watch</p>
<p>my words and that neither you or your audience is going to be responding derisively.</p>
<p>I feel safe here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
