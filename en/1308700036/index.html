    <p>Our card this week is Mary Frankie Harvey, the Jack of Hearts from Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Forty-two years have passed since Frankie was left for dead in a southeastern Massachusetts</p>
<p>gravel pit.</p>
<p>Frankie&rsquo;s case is unique in a lot of ways, but one reason is because her story straddles</p>
<p>the state line of Rhode Island, where she was last seen alive, and Massachusetts, where</p>
<p>her body was found, which complicated the investigation from the get-go.</p>
<p>And while her case is still unresolved today, recent discoveries have revealed major breakthroughs</p>
<p>that have investigators truly on the cusp of solving her murder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>November 29, 1980 was a gray, cool day in the small town of Rentham, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>It was the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and the day had been pretty quiet around town.</p>
<p>Until that afternoon, when Rentham Police Dispatch got a call.</p>
<p>It was close to 3 or 3.30 in the afternoon, they received a call from the media inquiring</p>
<p>as to where the body was located on Route 1.</p>
<p>Rentham Police Detective James Barrett said the dispatcher responded to the reporter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>call with the question, what body?</p>
<p>The reporter said they heard on scanner traffic that law enforcement was responding to a sand</p>
<p>pit area in Rentham because someone had discovered a woman&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>But Rentham Police had no idea what was going on, so a sergeant and an officer drove out</p>
<p>to Route 1, and to their surprise, they found Massachusetts State Police and local media</p>
<p>gathering in a gravel pit just off the highway.</p>
<p>So the reports describe a somewhat chaotic crime scene.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s indicated in multiple reports that there appeared to be between 8 and 12 vehicles</p>
<p>in the crime scene area, like a mix of media vehicles as well as state police cruisers.</p>
<p>When Rentham PD approached, a lieutenant with the state police said that they&rsquo;d gotten a</p>
<p>call from a property owner of the sand and gravel excavation company around there at</p>
<p>around 1 p.m.</p>
<p>The caller said he found a woman who appeared to have been shot and killed.</p>
<p>The lieutenant said that state police responded and had been roping off the area when reporters</p>
<p>started showing up.</p>
<p>Now right away, there was tension at the scene with Rentham Police and the state police because</p>
<p>both were claiming ownership of the crime scene.</p>
<p>Massachusetts is set up where the state police head up the state&rsquo;s criminal investigations</p>
<p>on most occasions, but it&rsquo;s not exactly black and white, and this scene was one of those</p>
<p>gray areas.</p>
<p>So the Rentham officers radioed back to the station and told their chief of police and</p>
<p>a detective to join them at the scene to better assess the situation.</p>
<p>Once the chief of police got there, he took a closer look at the woman, the very young</p>
<p>woman.</p>
<p>She was fully clothed and lying on her back in the gravel area.</p>
<p>She appeared to be in her teens, maybe early 20s tops.</p>
<p>There were shell casings near her body, and the chief of police also observed tire marks</p>
<p>close by.</p>
<p>But because of all the cars at the crime scene, he couldn&rsquo;t tell if they were relevant</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>One of the shell casings even had a distinct footprint over it.</p>
<p>But by the time Rentham PD was there, state police said that they had already taken photos</p>
<p>and were done processing the crime scene.</p>
<p>The woman didn&rsquo;t seem to have any ID on her, so police knew that they needed to try</p>
<p>and identify her through other means.</p>
<p>While she was being taken away for autopsy by the local funeral home, Rentham Police</p>
<p>set out to do an initial canvas.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much in the gravel pit area besides a parking lot next door, where long-haul</p>
<p>truckers sometimes parked, and a place called Mike&rsquo;s Truck Stop across the highway.</p>
<p>So officers started there.</p>
<p>They asked truck drivers if anyone had seen anything or heard any gunshots, and they asked</p>
<p>truck stop employees and customers if anyone had seen the young woman or if they noticed</p>
<p>anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>When they didn&rsquo;t get any helpful information, they spent the rest of the afternoon and night</p>
<p>working their way up and down Route 1, stopping at every diner and bar looking for possible</p>
<p>witnesses.</p>
<p>But every stop they made, they struck out.</p>
<p>No one remembered seeing the woman, who they were describing as white and petite with long</p>
<p>brown hair, maybe between 17 and 20 years old.</p>
<p>The next day, November 30th, an autopsy was performed at Ross&rsquo;s funeral home in Rentham.</p>
<p>Nowadays, bodies in the area are usually taken back to Boston for examinations, but in 1980,</p>
<p>at least in this case, the medical examiner actually went to the private funeral home</p>
<p>and did the autopsy there.</p>
<p>Now, before the autopsy even really got underway, the ME discovered something strange in the</p>
<p>girl&rsquo;s pocket that police missed at the scene.</p>
<p>It was a note.</p>
<p>The note was dated November 24th and addressed to someone named Frankie.</p>
<p>The letter said, quote, Hey kid, how&rsquo;s life treating you?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s Ruth?</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m listening to the radio and writing to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1028 p.m.</p>
<p>Has Paula been working lately?</p>
<p>Hope your Thanksgiving day is okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure mine will be.</p>
<p>Well, I really have nothing to say, but I finally made it home.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is so short and sloppy.</p>
<p>Sharon.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>The ME set the letter aside to give to police later, and they continued on.</p>
<p>At some point, a dentist was called to examine her teeth, which were in great condition,</p>
<p>but it was the dentist who discovered something else interesting.</p>
<p>This woman was no woman at all.</p>
<p>She was probably just a girl, likely much younger than investigators had assumed.</p>
<p>After the autopsy, the ME ruled it a homicide by gunshot wound.</p>
<p>Detective Barrett, who&rsquo;s working the case today, asked us to keep the specifics, like</p>
<p>where on her body she was shot, under wraps.</p>
<p>But he did say that the bullets they extracted during the autopsy were helpful to the investigation.</p>
<p>So at that point, two .45 caliber bullets were recovered from her body that were consistent</p>
<p>with the shell casings that were recovered at the scene, which I think would lead one</p>
<p>to believe that she was probably shot there at that scene.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s body didn&rsquo;t have any other signs of trauma.</p>
<p>And I know you&rsquo;re all wondering if the ME was able to determine whether or not the</p>
<p>girl had been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>But the thing is, we were asked not to disclose information specific to those findings.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what I can tell you.</p>
<p>Even though it was 1980, biological evidence was recovered during the autopsy and preserved.</p>
<p>And other evidence, like the bullets and clothing, were sent to the state crime lab in Boston</p>
<p>right after the examination.</p>
<p>Now while they waited for any kind of analysis to come back, Rentham police were checking</p>
<p>out the letter that was in the girl&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>Could this young girl be the Frankie that this note was addressed to?</p>
<p>They checked missing persons reports to see if there were any missing Frankies or any</p>
<p>names that Frankie could be short for like Francis or Francine, but they turned up nothing.</p>
<p>So police started contacting high schools and colleges in the area to see if any students</p>
<p>by that name were missing.</p>
<p>It was tricky timing because most schools were on Thanksgiving break, but police were</p>
<p>grasping at straws trying to do anything they could think of to find out who this girl was.</p>
<p>They knew that they were missing out on valuable investigative time simply by not knowing this</p>
<p>girl&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>On December 2nd, to try and redeem themselves for the chaotic crime scene, state police</p>
<p>and Rentham police had a sit-down meeting and the case was formally assigned to Rentham</p>
<p>detective John Barrett and Massachusetts state trooper Joseph Brooks.</p>
<p>The two were told to work the case together from that point forward.</p>
<p>And as a quick side note, the detective that you&rsquo;re hearing from in this episode, James</p>
<p>Barrett, that&rsquo;s John Barrett&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>So the OG detective on this case in 1980 was James&rsquo;s dad.</p>
<p>James was just a kid when this happened, but he remembers his dad coming home and showing</p>
<p>him a crime scene photo of the girl who&rsquo;d been shot, hoping maybe he knew her, which</p>
<p>just goes to show you how desperate police were to identify her.</p>
<p>And he kind of held it up.</p>
<p>It was very shocking because I don&rsquo;t think even at 11, I&rsquo;d even seen what a dead person</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, do you recognize this girl?</p>
<p>So you could almost sense the desperation in him when, you know, when you&rsquo;re showing</p>
<p>a picture of a dead person to your 11-year-old and 12-year-old, because my older brother</p>
<p>is a year older, to see if we recognize her.</p>
<p>It must have been pretty worrisome for him that they didn&rsquo;t know who she was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s never left me.</p>
<p>It was traumatic.</p>
<p>James and his brother did not recognize the girl in the photo.</p>
<p>As a last resort, police finally decided to turn to the press to see if the public could</p>
<p>help identify her.</p>
<p>The funeral home cleaned her up, and they took a tight close-up photo of just the girl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>face with her eyes closed and her brown hair splayed out behind her.</p>
<p>And that photo was released to the media, along with a detailed description of her clothing</p>
<p>on December 3rd.</p>
<p>Now, they didn&rsquo;t feel good about releasing a photo of a young dead girl to the public,</p>
<p>but they felt as if they had tried everything else by that point.</p>
<p>Two local newspapers, the Rentham Sun Chronicle and the Woonsocket Call, ran the photo and</p>
<p>the information police provided.</p>
<p>They reported that the girl was about 5'3&quot;, 115 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes,</p>
<p>wearing a waist-length brown jacket with raglan sleeves.</p>
<p>They reported that she was also wearing a Ketchcan brand quilted maroon blouse under</p>
<p>the jacket.</p>
<p>And they even released the size and brand of her bra, hoping that regional clothing</p>
<p>makers might remember her as a customer and come forward.</p>
<p>The other thing police gave to the media were the details of the letter found in the girl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pocket.</p>
<p>They were hoping someone could give them a lead on who Frankie was or even the letter</p>
<p>writer, Sharon.</p>
<p>And the media attention paid off, and people started calling in with ideas about who the</p>
<p>girl might be.</p>
<p>Police spent a few days running down the tips, but ultimately came up with nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, on December 7th, a week after she was found, Rentham police got a call from</p>
<p>someone saying,</p>
<p>That girl in the newspaper?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s my niece, Frankie Harvey.</p>
<p>Frankie Harvey&rsquo;s uncle was calling from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, which is just 25 minutes south.</p>
<p>As he went on to describe his niece, there was little doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind that they</p>
<p>finally had a match.</p>
<p>Not just because his description was spot on, but because he said they were supposed</p>
<p>to spend Thanksgiving Day with her, but she was a no-show, and nobody in their family</p>
<p>had seen her in a while.</p>
<p>There was just one discrepancy.</p>
<p>Her uncle said that Frankie was only 13, which was way younger than anyone had even guessed.</p>
<p>And you might be wondering why a 13-year-old&rsquo;s family hadn&rsquo;t reported her missing after</p>
<p>going weeks without seeing her.</p>
<p>But the answer was, she had been reported missing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the whole story that her uncle told police.</p>
<p>He said that Frankie had been staying at a girls&rsquo; home called the Marathon House</p>
<p>in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
<p>And her uncle and his wife, Frankie&rsquo;s aunt, were supposed to pick her up from that house</p>
<p>on Wednesday, November 26th.</p>
<p>She was going to stay that night, have Thanksgiving dinner with them on Thursday, and then stay</p>
<p>through the whole weekend before going back on Monday.</p>
<p>Detective Barrett said that the aunt and uncle were looking forward to spending time with</p>
<p>Frankie over the holiday.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, before they left to go get her, their phone rang.</p>
<p>They had received a call from Marathon House not to come pick her up because she had run</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>They were told she was missing in action.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know where she was, and to not waste their time coming to pick her up because</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Frankie&rsquo;s uncle told police that she had only been living at Marathon House for a week,</p>
<p>maybe two, and had just been placed there after running away from a different youth</p>
<p>home.</p>
<p>On the phone that day, the staff at Marathon House told her uncle not to worry because</p>
<p>they had already reported Frankie missing to police in Providence, per their policy.</p>
<p>Since Frankie took off on her own pretty often and always showed back up, nobody thought</p>
<p>much of it at the time.</p>
<p>And that missing persons report that was filed in Providence didn&rsquo;t make it onto Rentham</p>
<p>Police&rsquo;s radar when they were first trying to identify her because they were checking</p>
<p>reports from Massachusetts, not Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Just so you know, Rentham, Massachusetts is only about 40 minutes north of Providence,</p>
<p>Rhode Island.</p>
<p>But because they&rsquo;re in two different states, there was a bit of a barrier when it came</p>
<p>to information sharing.</p>
<p>And Providence is a bigger metro area, so while sleepy little Rentham is just 25 miles</p>
<p>up the road, it sort of feels like a world away from Providence.</p>
<p>Rentham police immediately drove to Providence to tell Frankie&rsquo;s mom about her death.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there aren&rsquo;t any reports to tell us what her mom&rsquo;s reaction was or what</p>
<p>she said, and there are no written reports to explain Frankie&rsquo;s relationship with her</p>
<p>mom or any explanation as to why Frankie wasn&rsquo;t living at home with her.</p>
<p>And police say that she&rsquo;s since passed away.</p>
<p>But Frankie&rsquo;s little brother, Michael Harvey, who was just six years old at the time, was</p>
<p>absolutely gutted over the news of his sister&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Michael told our reporting team that Frankie was more than a big sister.</p>
<p>She mothered him, and the two were as close as two siblings can be.</p>
<p>She was my best friend.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>She got me dressed.</p>
<p>She gave me breakfast.</p>
<p>She got me to go to school.</p>
<p>The last memory I have is me holding onto the casket, and people trying to pull me away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it hurts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it hurts the most.</p>
<p>He just took my best friend away from me, and my life went to shit afterwards.</p>
<p>My arms weren&rsquo;t big enough to go around the whole casket, but I was holding on.</p>
<p>I was holding on.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t let go.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen this way.</p>
<p>Her family members told police Frankie was a bright light and fiercely independent and</p>
<p>brave for her age.</p>
<p>They said she was trusting of people, and she often hitchhiked different places.</p>
<p>Some relatives said she&rsquo;d been enrolled in a school for a while but got kicked out for</p>
<p>possibly selling pills.</p>
<p>It became clear to police that Frankie might not have had the best home life and was trying</p>
<p>to make it on her own at the young age of 13.</p>
<p>While her extended family like her aunts and uncles would try and keep her out of trouble,</p>
<p>she was hard to keep track of, bouncing from youth home to youth home.</p>
<p>Which is why when they interviewed the employees at Marathon House, it didn&rsquo;t reveal a ton</p>
<p>about her.</p>
<p>Employees told police that Frankie had been staying there less than two weeks, so no one</p>
<p>had really gotten to know her yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really unclear.</p>
<p>Her existence is something of a mystery because, again, she never stayed anywhere long enough</p>
<p>for people to establish a meaningful friendship with her.</p>
<p>They did find out that Frankie was known to hang out with a couple of other residents</p>
<p>who were a little older than her, closer to 16.</p>
<p>None of them were Sharon or even knew who Sharon might be, but they did learn something</p>
<p>from their conversations with these girls.</p>
<p>One of them said that they&rsquo;d seen her around the time that she went missing.</p>
<p>I believe the Federal Hill area, Providence, where I guess a lot of kids that were just</p>
<p>out and about looking for trouble and just looking to party or whatever would hang around</p>
<p>at all hours of the night.</p>
<p>Interestingly, one of the witnesses that had seen her said that she had seen her in the</p>
<p>early morning hours of Thanksgiving Day, between two and five o&rsquo;clock in the morning in this</p>
<p>area of Providence, just outside talking to people through car doors, just talking to</p>
<p>people with another girl.</p>
<p>The girl said that she specifically remembered Frankie being there because she sort of stuck</p>
<p>out since she was several years younger than everyone else who hung around that area.</p>
<p>And because what she was wearing stood out.</p>
<p>She was wearing a light coat, I think in jeans or corduroy pants, but not something that</p>
<p>it looked like it was too cold to be wearing what she was wearing.</p>
<p>And that when they asked if she was okay, when they drove by, she said, she&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just waiting for somebody.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the girl didn&rsquo;t know who Frankie was waiting for.</p>
<p>So detectives set out to talk to the other teenagers who ran in the same circle.</p>
<p>And another one of the girls who was friends with Frankie had more information.</p>
<p>The girl told police that she was at Federal Hill with Frankie when two guys picked up</p>
<p>both of them.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was November 26th or 27th, and she also wasn&rsquo;t sure what time</p>
<p>it was.</p>
<p>But she said that she and Frankie cruised around with these guys aimlessly for a little</p>
<p>while and eventually this girl asked the guys to take her home to her mom&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>The girl said that when the guys dropped her off at her mom&rsquo;s house, she went inside</p>
<p>to ask her mom if Frankie could stay the night, but her mom said no.</p>
<p>So she went back outside and told Frankie that she couldn&rsquo;t stay over.</p>
<p>And so Frankie left with the guys.</p>
<p>That was the last contact that anyone had with Frankie.</p>
<p>So who were these guys?</p>
<p>The girl didn&rsquo;t know their names.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s very little information in old reports to tell modern day investigators who</p>
<p>they were or how police identified them.</p>
<p>But investigators eventually did find them and interview them.</p>
<p>And as far as Detective Barrett can tell, they were cooperative and ruled out as suspects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>I think that, again, the leads of who Frankie and her friend were with led to nothing.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t believe that they were necessarily suspects.</p>
<p>I think they were initially, but I think that there were enough details given that</p>
<p>they had been re-interviewed.</p>
<p>They were definitely re-interviewed.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I think that the story is just kind of checked out.</p>
<p>Police were really worried about their lack of investigative leads at this point in the</p>
<p>investigation.</p>
<p>It seemed like everyone they interviewed and every corner they turned led to nothing.</p>
<p>But then police got a tip from someone who said that they should be looking for a guy</p>
<p>who went by the nickname T-Man.</p>
<p>The tipster said T-Man was involved with a lot of younger girls from Marathon House.</p>
<p>He had a reputation for trafficking the girls.</p>
<p>Now the tipster didn&rsquo;t say that Frankie was being trafficked, but they knew that Frankie</p>
<p>hung out with the girls who definitely were victims of T-Man because the tipster herself</p>
<p>said that she had been introduced to T-Man by Frankie.</p>
<p>She said that she knew T-Man.</p>
<p>She knew who he was and that he was a bad guy, that he carried a gun under his front</p>
<p>seat of his car, that he would drop girls off at houses and wait outside while they</p>
<p>went in to have sex with clients.</p>
<p>And a lot of it was done just in exchange for drugs.</p>
<p>This tip sent police on a wild goose chase over the next few months because nobody seemed</p>
<p>to know T-Man&rsquo;s real name or even what he looked like or what kind of car he drove.</p>
<p>The only information they were able to get about T-Man was that he was white and maybe</p>
<p>in his 20s.</p>
<p>They went everywhere and tried to track this person down.</p>
<p>No one really had a lot of information.</p>
<p>And I think we also have to bear in mind a lot of these interviews were of young teenagers</p>
<p>that were intoxicated at the time when they had interactions with T-Man.</p>
<p>There was also the possibility that people were scared of T-Man.</p>
<p>But the path to finding or even identifying him went nowhere.</p>
<p>And over the next few months, police still hadn&rsquo;t gotten any helpful information from</p>
<p>the evidence they&rsquo;d sent to the state lab.</p>
<p>So by 1981, the investigation into Frankie&rsquo;s murder went cold.</p>
<p>Detectives retired, other murders took precedence, and years flew by.</p>
<p>The detectives were forced to look square at Frankie&rsquo;s case again 13 years after her</p>
<p>murder when someone, completely out of the blue, sent a letter to the Rentham Police</p>
<p>Department with a tip.</p>
<p>The letter said Frankie was last seen with a pimp named Johnny at a truck stop one town</p>
<p>over from Rentham right before she was killed.</p>
<p>The tipster said that her body was then dumped in Rentham, and Johnny, the pimp, was later</p>
<p>murdered in Pawtucket.</p>
<p>This obviously reignited a flurry of activity on the case.</p>
<p>However, his lack of knowledge of the details of the Mary Harvey homicide basically led</p>
<p>detectives to believe that it was just a made-up story for the purpose of either doing harm</p>
<p>to other individuals or for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Even though police basically decided this letter writer was a liar, it was enough to</p>
<p>spark some new interest in Frankie&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>A detective at the time decided to try and re-interview old witnesses and go back through</p>
<p>old reports.</p>
<p>He even submitted a 15-page questionnaire to VICAP, the FBI&rsquo;s Violent Crime Apprehension</p>
<p>Program that identifies similarities in cases, but nothing came from it, and Frankie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case went back on the shelf.</p>
<p>Until 1998, when Frankie&rsquo;s little brother, Michael, who was in his 20s by then, called</p>
<p>to ask if they were any closer to catching his sister&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>Michael said losing his sister ruined him, and he called police because he wanted to</p>
<p>at least know if someone in power was still trying to do something about it.</p>
<p>He said for years, he would think about all the things Frankie was missing out on, all</p>
<p>the memories that he was making that he would have shared with his big sister, and all the</p>
<p>firsts that she didn&rsquo;t get to have.</p>
<p>But she never had a family, she never got to have anything, nothing.</p>
<p>Not a chance for a boyfriend, not for a chance to have kids, not to have grandkids, have</p>
<p>a career, have a life, nothing.</p>
<p>Gone.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>It took mine, too, because I had no ambition, I had no f***ing stride in life.</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s call prompted the Rentham PD to take a hard look at Frankie&rsquo;s case again,</p>
<p>This time, they submitted the biological evidence which had been preserved for all these years</p>
<p>to see if they could generate a DNA profile.</p>
<p>Everyone had their fingers crossed and was literally, you know, on the edge of their</p>
<p>seat hoping that if this DNA profile was good enough, it could be instrumental in helping</p>
<p>us to identify a suspect, or at least a person of interest.</p>
<p>But the technology wasn&rsquo;t advanced enough back then, and the evidence didn&rsquo;t produce</p>
<p>enough markers to be submitted to the national database.</p>
<p>But it did produce a partial profile that they submitted to the Massachusetts State</p>
<p>Database.</p>
<p>Which was, you know, problematic, clearly, Mary Harvey, you know, was identified as someone</p>
<p>from Providence, Rhode Island, and that the person who murdered her may not even be from</p>
<p>Massachusetts or have a profile in the Massachusetts database.</p>
<p>They never got any hits in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Even after the years passed, nothing popped up.</p>
<p>So in 2018, Detective Barrett decided to take a look at the case and see if there was anything</p>
<p>worth reexamining using more advanced technology.</p>
<p>I think I was just curious about it.</p>
<p>I think, you know, going back through my time as a police officer, in my recollection, this</p>
<p>is a case that kind of was always just sitting on the shelf in the Rentham Records room.</p>
<p>And knowing that my dad had worked on it, my dad passed away in 99.</p>
<p>But I know that it always troubled him that they were never able to solve this case.</p>
<p>And I figured, you know, I don&rsquo;t know how many years I have left on the department.</p>
<p>Like, you know, maybe it&rsquo;s time now where technology is improved to at least take a</p>
<p>look at the case again.</p>
<p>So it was just kind of on my mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been on the back of my mind.</p>
<p>But I think I figured I&rsquo;d just make a phone call and find out.</p>
<p>Detective Barrett called the state crime lab in Boston to ask if the DNA evidence from</p>
<p>the Frankie Harvey homicide could be enough, per modern standards, to submit to CODIS.</p>
<p>While he waited for that, Detective Barrett got a call from Michael, who was again inquiring</p>
<p>to see what progress had been made in his sister&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>So I was able to tell him, no, we&rsquo;re actually, we just started looking at your sister&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case again.</p>
<p>And he just, he started bawling.</p>
<p>This was good news for Michael, which was followed by more good news.</p>
<p>The state crime lab reanalyzed the DNA evidence and was actually able to get enough markers</p>
<p>this time to submit it to CODIS.</p>
<p>But two steps forward, one step back.</p>
<p>There were no matches in the national database once it was submitted.</p>
<p>But the case was heating up again.</p>
<p>Detective Barrett teamed up with a detective from the Massachusetts State Police, Dave</p>
<p>DiCicco, to read all of the reports associated with Frankie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And deep in the file, they came across a really interesting ballistics report that</p>
<p>changed what Detective Barrett thought he knew about Frankie&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Get this.</p>
<p>So apparently, way back in like 1982, another man was killed with the same weapon that killed</p>
<p>Frankie.</p>
<p>So you got to get a load of this story because it is a strange connection that I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite wrap my head around.</p>
<p>So on October 3rd, 1982, an officer with Pawtucket Police Department was dispatched to a sand</p>
<p>and gravel pit for a car that had been abandoned.</p>
<p>The officer went to check it out and ran the registration of the Oldsmobile, which came</p>
<p>back to a Providence, Rhode Island man named Frank Cannon.</p>
<p>The officer looked around the immediate area and didn&rsquo;t see anyone.</p>
<p>So he tried to find Frank by going to his listed address, but no one answers the door.</p>
<p>The officer was able to track down Frank&rsquo;s sister though.</p>
<p>And she said that she hadn&rsquo;t seen her brother that day, but she would be on the lookout</p>
<p>for him.</p>
<p>Pawtucket Police cold case detective Susan Cormier said after a few hours, Frank&rsquo;s sister</p>
<p>decided to round up some relatives and go check things out for themselves.</p>
<p>Later on, his sister and sister-in-law responded out there to go find the car.</p>
<p>And they had a couple of other family members and friends with them, and they kind of spread</p>
<p>out calling out his name, looking for him.</p>
<p>And the sister-in-law ended up finding him in the bushes a little ways away.</p>
<p>Frank was dead with several obvious bullet wounds.</p>
<p>When officers were called to the scene, they found a shell casing and blood on the ground.</p>
<p>They also observed what looked like drag marks, making them wonder if whoever shot Frank had</p>
<p>killed him near his car and then dragged him to the bushes.</p>
<p>Police interviewed Frank&rsquo;s sister, who said that her brother worked at the Urban League</p>
<p>in Providence as a counselor and that he was actively involved in a local political campaign.</p>
<p>And interestingly, Frank&rsquo;s sister said that this was not the first time Frank had been</p>
<p>targeted.</p>
<p>She said that the year prior, in 1981, Frank had been abducted by two men who shot him</p>
<p>multiple times, but he survived the attack.</p>
<p>The only problem was Frank refused to tell police who shot him.</p>
<p>He was even hospitalized after the shooting, but Frank would not give up a name or even</p>
<p>a reason for the shooting.</p>
<p>Now when they sent the shell casings from his scene to Boston to get analyzed, the ballistics</p>
<p>analysts said with 100 percent confidence that the gun that killed 33-year-old Frank</p>
<p>Cannon in Rhode Island was the same gun that killed 13-year-old Frankie Harvey in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Now at the time, it seems like nothing was done about it.</p>
<p>Or if police in both Rentham and Pawtucket did get together to further investigate how</p>
<p>the murders were connected, it wasn&rsquo;t documented in any reports.</p>
<p>You would think, but it doesn&rsquo;t appear based on the reports that we have that that was</p>
<p>done.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s because at the time, they just couldn&rsquo;t fathom how they could</p>
<p>be connected.</p>
<p>Like on paper, as far as victimology goes, Frank Cannon and Frankie Harvey had nothing</p>
<p>in common.</p>
<p>Different genders, different races, different ages, different hometowns, different lifestyles.</p>
<p>I mean, the only thing that the crime scenes had in common, besides the bullets, were the</p>
<p>locations.</p>
<p>Even though they were in different states, both Frank and Frankie were shot and killed</p>
<p>in gravel pits.</p>
<p>Also, kind of weird that both of their names are similar, right?</p>
<p>I mean, like no one brings this up, and I&rsquo;m sure it has nothing to do with it, but it</p>
<p>stands out to me.</p>
<p>But at the time, police in Pawtucket had started leaning into a theory that Frank Cannon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder was connected to organized crime, mostly because of his political work.</p>
<p>And listen, him being so closed lip about who was trying to kill him the first time</p>
<p>around, that&rsquo;s got funny business written all over it.</p>
<p>I think Frank was scared of people.</p>
<p>But as far as Frankie goes, how could a 13-year-old girl be caught up with a crime family?</p>
<p>So Detective Barrett thinks investigators at the time might have just dismissed the</p>
<p>ballistics connection as a coincidence, like maybe it was a street gun that got tossed</p>
<p>around.</p>
<p>Whether or not there&rsquo;d be an organized crime connection to the murder of a 13-year-old</p>
<p>girl in Rentham, I don&rsquo;t know if they would have made that connection, if that would have</p>
<p>actually been connected, or if the investigators at the time really gave it much thought.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But fast forward to 2018 when Barrett comes across this report, and he doesn&rsquo;t buy it</p>
<p>as a coincidence.</p>
<p>I contacted the cold case detective down in Pawtucket because I don&rsquo;t believe really</p>
<p>in coincidences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a connection.</p>
<p>Detective Cormier took Detective Barrett&rsquo;s call, and they all agreed that the gun connection</p>
<p>was worth investigating further.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even aware of the case in Rentham with Mary Frances Harvey until sometime last</p>
<p>year when I started working with Jim Barrett from Rentham and Dave DiCicco from the Mass</p>
<p>State Police.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s certainly some interesting facts on both cases that, you know, shows</p>
<p>that type of connection.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just trying to connect the dots.</p>
<p>One of the first things they did was process of elimination.</p>
<p>Now that they had the DNA profile from Frankie&rsquo;s crime scene, they wanted to test Frank Cannon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>DNA against it.</p>
<p>And through a family member&rsquo;s sample, they were able to rule him out, at least forensically</p>
<p>as a suspect in Frankie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>There is always those missing puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said many times, a cold case like this is like somebody handing you a puzzle</p>
<p>and dumping it out on the table and taking away the box with the picture on it.</p>
<p>And some of those pieces may have fallen, you know, where you just try and put it all</p>
<p>together and the best that you can.</p>
<p>In this puzzle, there are a few missing pieces.</p>
<p>First, the gun has never been found.</p>
<p>Second, motive.</p>
<p>Police can&rsquo;t say in either case what made Frankie or Frank targets.</p>
<p>Frank Cannon had his wallet and cash on him, so police knew that it hadn&rsquo;t been a robbery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to say because while we can say the same gun killed both people, who pulled</p>
<p>the trigger is a lot more difficult to prove.</p>
<p>So depending on how this goes with all of the different theories, you know, you have</p>
<p>people saying, well, there was the mafia.</p>
<p>Well, could it be a racial thing?</p>
<p>Well, he worked, you know, as a counselor here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s finding out what the motive for each one of them was to see who was the trigger person.</p>
<p>The pandemic severely delayed the collaboration on the cases, but a week after our reporting</p>
<p>team was in Massachusetts and Rhode Island for this episode, Detective Cormier, Barrett</p>
<p>and DiCicco finally got together to compare notes.</p>
<p>At the meeting, they made a to-do list.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now working with Parabon NanoLabs to put together a snapshot of the suspect</p>
<p>in Frankie&rsquo;s case, and they&rsquo;re using genealogy databases to see if they can get any familial</p>
<p>matches to a possible perpetrator.</p>
<p>The team&rsquo;s also getting creative to try and look at other avenues.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing archival research to see if there are any old records of residents who</p>
<p>stayed at Marathon House back when Frankie lived there who were never interviewed.</p>
<p>Because even today, they still don&rsquo;t know who Sharon is, the person who wrote that letter</p>
<p>to Frankie.</p>
<p>In addition to that, they&rsquo;re doing some boots-on-the-ground investigative work, just</p>
<p>trying to find T-Man&rsquo;s real name, which, of course, is where you come in.</p>
<p>I think T-Man is definitely, if there&rsquo;s any of your listeners that are from this area</p>
<p>that are old enough to maybe have been around the Providence area, if they recognize that</p>
<p>name would definitely.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a pivotal person in this investigation.</p>
<p>If he wasn&rsquo;t that much older, the likelihood that he may still be alive, if not incarcerated,</p>
<p>is pretty high.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been 42 years, but, you know, we can keep our fingers crossed.</p>
<p>If there are people that listen to the podcast in Providence, Rhode Island, that area that</p>
<p>may have lived there in the 80s, they may recognize that nickname.</p>
<p>Oh, I knew that guy.</p>
<p>You know, he was a bad dude who was constantly at Federal Hill, and, you know, that would</p>
<p>definitely be helpful.</p>
<p>This is a very solvable case.</p>
<p>Whether a match gets generated in CODIS or a familial hit comes from their new genealogy</p>
<p>efforts or a significant tip comes in, it is just a matter of time.</p>
<p>So if you have any information that you think could help detectives close this case for</p>
<p>good, please speak up.</p>
<p>There are three different detectives from three different agencies who right now would</p>
<p>love to hear from you.</p>
<p>If you have any information about Frank Cannon&rsquo;s 1982 murder, call the Rhode Island Cold Case</p>
<p>tip line at 877-747-6583.</p>
<p>Or if you know anything about Frankie Harvey&rsquo;s 1980 murder, please call the Rentham Police</p>
<p>Department at 508-384-2121.</p>
<p>Or you can call the Massachusetts State Police at 855-627-6583.</p>
<p>Their families deserve justice.</p>
<p>Michael Harvey deserves to know what happened to his big sister.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m really looking for is the answer, the reason why.</p>
<p>What was the whole reason why I was killing her?</p>
<p>What was so bad that you had to kill my sister for?</p>
<p>What did she know?</p>
<p>Forty years, I have not given up one day.</p>
<p>Every day I think about her, every day I f***ing, I cry about her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not giving up.</p>
