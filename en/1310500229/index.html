    <p>The following is a conversation with Jeff Schoenlein,</p>
<p>a scientist at NIST</p>
<p>interested in optoelectronic intelligence.</p>
<p>We have a deep technical dive into computing hardware</p>
<p>that will make Jim Keller proud.</p>
<p>I urge you to hop onto this rollercoaster ride</p>
<p>through neuromorphic computing</p>
<p>and superconducting electronics</p>
<p>and hold on for dear life.</p>
<p>Jeff is a great communicator of technical information</p>
<p>and so it was truly a pleasure to talk to him</p>
<p>about some physics and engineering.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Jeff Schoenlein.</p>
<p>I got a chance to read a fascinating paper you authored</p>
<p>called Optoelectronic Intelligence.</p>
<p>So maybe we can start by talking about this paper</p>
<p>and start with the basic questions.</p>
<p>What is optoelectronic intelligence?</p>
<p>Yeah, so in that paper,</p>
<p>the concept I was trying to describe</p>
<p>is sort of an architecture</p>
<p>for building brain inspired computing</p>
<p>that leverages light for communication</p>
<p>in conjunction with electronic circuits for computation.</p>
<p>In that particular paper,</p>
<p>a lot of the work we&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>in our project at NIST</p>
<p>is focused on superconducting electronics for computation.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into why that is,</p>
<p>but that might make a little more sense in context</p>
<p>if we first describe what that is in contrast to,</p>
<p>which is semiconducting electronics.</p>
<p>So is it worth taking a couple minutes</p>
<p>to describe semiconducting electronics?</p>
<p>It might even be worthwhile to step back</p>
<p>and talk about electricity and circuits</p>
<p>and how circuits work</p>
<p>before we talk about superconductivity.</p>
<p>Right, okay.</p>
<p>How does a computer work, Jeff?</p>
<p>Well, I won&rsquo;t go into everything</p>
<p>that makes a computer work,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about the basic building blocks,</p>
<p>a transistor, and even more basic than that,</p>
<p>a semiconductor material, silicon, say.</p>
<p>So in silicon, silicon is a semiconductor,</p>
<p>and what that means is at low temperature,</p>
<p>there are no free charges,</p>
<p>no free electrons that can move around.</p>
<p>So when you talk about electricity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about predominantly electrons</p>
<p>moving to establish electrical currents,</p>
<p>and they move under the influence of voltages.</p>
<p>So you apply voltages, electrons move around,</p>
<p>those can be measured as currents,</p>
<p>and you can represent information in that way.</p>
<p>So semiconductors are special</p>
<p>in the sense that they are really malleable.</p>
<p>So if you have a semiconductor material,</p>
<p>you can change the number of free electrons</p>
<p>that can move around by putting different elements,</p>
<p>different atoms in lattice sites.</p>
<p>So what is a lattice site?</p>
<p>Well, a semiconductor is a crystal,</p>
<p>which means all the atoms that comprise the material</p>
<p>are at exact locations</p>
<p>that are perfectly periodic in space.</p>
<p>So if you start at any one atom</p>
<p>and you go along what are called the lattice vectors,</p>
<p>you get to another atom and another atom and another atom,</p>
<p>and for high quality devices,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that it&rsquo;s a perfect crystal</p>
<p>with very few defects,</p>
<p>but you can intentionally replace a silicon atom</p>
<p>with say a phosphorus atom,</p>
<p>and then you can change the number of free electrons</p>
<p>that are in a region of space</p>
<p>that has that excess of what are called dopants.</p>
<p>So picture a device that has a left terminal</p>
<p>and a right terminal,</p>
<p>and if you apply a voltage between those two,</p>
<p>you can cause electrical current to flow between them.</p>
<p>Now we add a third terminal up on top there,</p>
<p>and depending on the voltage</p>
<p>between the left and right terminal and that third voltage,</p>
<p>you can change that current.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s commonly done in digital electronic circuits</p>
<p>is to leave a fixed voltage from left to right,</p>
<p>and then change that voltage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s applied at what&rsquo;s called the gate,</p>
<p>the gate of the transistor.</p>
<p>So what you do is you make it to where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an excess of electrons on the left,</p>
<p>excess of electrons on the right,</p>
<p>and very few electrons in the middle,</p>
<p>and you do this by changing the concentration</p>
<p>of different dopants in the lattice spatially.</p>
<p>And then when you apply a voltage to that gate,</p>
<p>you can either cause current to flow or turn it off,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s sort of your zero and one.</p>
<p>If you apply voltage, current can flow,</p>
<p>that current is representing a digital one,</p>
<p>and from that, from that basic element,</p>
<p>you can build up all the complexity</p>
<p>of digital electronic circuits</p>
<p>that have really had a profound influence on our society.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re talking about electrons.</p>
<p>Can you give a sense of what scale we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about in silicon</p>
<p>being able to mass manufacture these kinds of gates?</p>
<p>Yeah, so scale in a number of different senses.</p>
<p>Well, at the scale of the silicon lattice,</p>
<p>the distance between two atoms there is half a nanometer.</p>
<p>So people often like to compare these things</p>
<p>to the width of a human hair.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s some six orders of magnitude smaller</p>
<p>than the width of a human hair, something on that order.</p>
<p>So remarkably small,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about individual atoms here,</p>
<p>and electrons are of that length scale</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in that environment.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another sense</p>
<p>that scale matters in digital electronics.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the more important sense,</p>
<p>although they&rsquo;re related.</p>
<p>Scale refers to a number of things.</p>
<p>It refers to the size of that transistor.</p>
<p>So for example, I said you have a left contact,</p>
<p>a right contact, and some space between them</p>
<p>where the gate electrode sits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called the channel width or the channel length.</p>
<p>And what has enabled what we think of as Moore&rsquo;s law</p>
<p>or the continued increased performance</p>
<p>in silicon microelectronic circuits</p>
<p>is the ability to make that size, that feature size,</p>
<p>ever smaller, ever smaller at a really remarkable pace.</p>
<p>I mean, that feature size has decreased consistently</p>
<p>every couple of years since the 1960s.</p>
<p>And that was what Moore predicted in the 1960s.</p>
<p>He thought it would continue for at least two more decades,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been much longer than that.</p>
<p>And so that is why we&rsquo;ve been able to fit ever more devices,</p>
<p>ever more transistors, ever more computational power</p>
<p>on essentially the same size of chip.</p>
<p>So a user sits back and does essentially nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re running the same computer program,</p>
<p>but those devices are getting smaller, so they get faster,</p>
<p>they get more energy efficient,</p>
<p>and all of our computing performance</p>
<p>just continues to improve.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have to think too hard</p>
<p>about what we&rsquo;re doing as, say,</p>
<p>a software designer or something like that.</p>
<p>I absolutely don&rsquo;t mean to say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no innovation in software or the user side</p>
<p>of things, of course there is.</p>
<p>But from the hardware perspective,</p>
<p>we just have been given this gift</p>
<p>of continued performance improvement</p>
<p>through this scaling that is ever smaller feature sizes</p>
<p>with very similar, say, power consumption.</p>
<p>That power consumption has not continued to scale</p>
<p>in the most recent decades, but nevertheless,</p>
<p>we had a really good run there for a while.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re down to gates that are seven nanometers,</p>
<p>which is state of the art right now.</p>
<p>Maybe GlobalFoundries is trying to push it</p>
<p>even lower than that.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t keep up with where the predictions are</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna end.</p>
<p>But seven nanometer transistor has just a few tens of atoms</p>
<p>along the length of the conduction pathway.</p>
<p>So a naive semiconductor device physicist</p>
<p>would think you can&rsquo;t go much further than that</p>
<p>without some kind of revolution in the way we think</p>
<p>about the physics of our devices.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said</p>
<p>about the mass manufacture of these devices?</p>
<p>Right, right, so that&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>So how have we been able</p>
<p>to make those transistors smaller and smaller?</p>
<p>Well, companies like Intel, GlobalFoundries,</p>
<p>they invest a lot of money in the lithography.</p>
<p>So how are these chips actually made?</p>
<p>Well, one of the most important steps</p>
<p>is this what&rsquo;s called ion implantation.</p>
<p>So you start with sort of a pristine silicon crystal</p>
<p>and then using photolithography,</p>
<p>which is a technique where you can pattern</p>
<p>different shapes using light,</p>
<p>you can define which regions of space</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to implant with different species of ions</p>
<p>that are going to change</p>
<p>the local electrical properties right there.</p>
<p>So by using ever shorter wavelengths of light</p>
<p>and different kinds of optical techniques</p>
<p>and different kinds of lithographic techniques,</p>
<p>things that go far beyond my knowledge base,</p>
<p>you can just simply shrink that feature size down.</p>
<p>And you say you&rsquo;re at seven nanometers.</p>
<p>Well, the wavelength of light that&rsquo;s being used</p>
<p>is over a hundred nanometers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already deep in the UV.</p>
<p>So how are those minute features patterned?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s an extraordinary amount of innovation</p>
<p>that has gone into that,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, it stayed very consistent</p>
<p>in this ever shrinking feature size.</p>
<p>And now the question is, can you make it smaller?</p>
<p>And even if you do, do you still continue</p>
<p>to get performance improvements?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another kind of scaling</p>
<p>where these companies have been able to&hellip;</p>
<p>So, okay, you picture a chip that has a processor on it.</p>
<p>Well, that chip is not made as a chip.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made on a wafer.</p>
<p>And using photolithography,</p>
<p>you basically print the same pattern on different dyes</p>
<p>all across the wafer, multiple layers,</p>
<p>tens, probably a hundred some layers</p>
<p>in a mature foundry process.</p>
<p>And you do this on ever bigger wafers too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another aspect of scaling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurred in the last several decades.</p>
<p>So now you have this 300 millimeter wafer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like as big as a pizza</p>
<p>and it has maybe a thousand processors on it.</p>
<p>And then you dice that up using a saw.</p>
<p>And now you can sell these things so cheap</p>
<p>because the manufacturing process was so streamlined.</p>
<p>I think a technology as revolutionary</p>
<p>as silicon microelectronics has to have</p>
<p>that kind of manufacturing scalability,</p>
<p>which I will just emphasize,</p>
<p>I believe is enabled by physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I mean, of course there&rsquo;s human ingenuity</p>
<p>that goes into it, but at least from my side where I sit,</p>
<p>it sure looks like the physics of our universe</p>
<p>allows us to produce that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve discovered how more so than we&rsquo;ve invented it,</p>
<p>although of course we have invented it,</p>
<p>humans have invented it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost as if it was there</p>
<p>waiting for us to discover it.</p>
<p>You mean the entirety of it</p>
<p>or are you specifically talking about</p>
<p>the techniques of photolithography,</p>
<p>like the optics involved?</p>
<p>I mean, the entirety of the scaling down</p>
<p>to the seven nanometers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to have electrons not interfere with each other</p>
<p>in such a way that you could still have gates.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s enabled.</p>
<p>To achieve that scale, spatial and temporal,</p>
<p>it seems to be very special</p>
<p>and is enabled by the physics of our world.</p>
<p>All of the things you just said.</p>
<p>So starting with the silicon material itself,</p>
<p>silicon is a unique semiconductor.</p>
<p>It has essentially ideal properties</p>
<p>for making a specific kind of transistor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extraordinarily useful.</p>
<p>So I mentioned that silicon has,</p>
<p>well, when you make a transistor,</p>
<p>you have this gate contact</p>
<p>that sits on top of the conduction channel.</p>
<p>And depending on the voltage you apply there,</p>
<p>you pull more carriers into the conduction channel</p>
<p>or push them away so it becomes more or less conductive.</p>
<p>In order to have that work</p>
<p>without just sucking those carriers right into that contact,</p>
<p>you need a very thin insulator.</p>
<p>And part of scaling has been to gradually decrease</p>
<p>the thickness of that gate insulator</p>
<p>so that you can use a roughly similar voltage</p>
<p>and still have the same current voltage characteristics.</p>
<p>So the material that&rsquo;s used to do that,</p>
<p>or I should say was initially used to do that</p>
<p>was a silicon dioxide,</p>
<p>which just naturally grows on the silicon surface.</p>
<p>So you expose silicon to the atmosphere that we breathe</p>
<p>and well, if you&rsquo;re manufacturing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna purify these gases,</p>
<p>but nevertheless,</p>
<p>that what&rsquo;s called a native oxide will grow there.</p>
<p>There are essentially no other materials</p>
<p>on the entire periodic table</p>
<p>that have as good of a gate insulator</p>
<p>as that silicon dioxide.</p>
<p>And that has to do with nothing but the physics</p>
<p>of the interaction between silicon and oxygen.</p>
<p>And if it wasn&rsquo;t that way,</p>
<p>transistors could not perform</p>
<p>in nearly the degree of capability that they have.</p>
<p>And that has to do with the way that the oxide grows,</p>
<p>the reduced density of defects there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insulation, meaning essentially it&rsquo;s energy gaps.</p>
<p>You can apply a very large voltage there</p>
<p>without having current leak through it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s physics right there.</p>
<p>There are other things too.</p>
<p>Silicon is a semiconductor in an elemental sense.</p>
<p>You only need silicon atoms.</p>
<p>A lot of other semiconductors,</p>
<p>you need two different kinds of atoms,</p>
<p>like a compound from group three</p>
<p>and a compound from group five.</p>
<p>That opens you up to lots of defects that can occur</p>
<p>where one atom&rsquo;s not sitting quite at the lattice site,</p>
<p>it is and it&rsquo;s switched with another one</p>
<p>that degrades performance.</p>
<p>But then also on the side that you mentioned</p>
<p>with the manufacturing,</p>
<p>we have access to light sources</p>
<p>that can produce these very short wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>How does photolithography occur?</p>
<p>Well, you actually put this polymer on top of your wafer</p>
<p>and you expose it to light,</p>
<p>and then you use a aqueous chemical processing</p>
<p>to dissolve away the regions that were exposed to light</p>
<p>and leave the regions that were not.</p>
<p>And we are blessed with these polymers</p>
<p>that have the right property</p>
<p>where they can cause scission events</p>
<p>where the polymer splits where a photon hits.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe that&rsquo;s not too surprising,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, it all comes together</p>
<p>to have this really complex,</p>
<p>manufacturable ecosystem</p>
<p>where very sophisticated technologies can be devised</p>
<p>and it works quite well.</p>
<p>And amazingly, like you said,</p>
<p>with a wavelength at like 100 nanometers</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still able to achieve on this polymer</p>
<p>precision of whatever we said, seven nanometers.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve heard like four nanometers</p>
<p>being talked about, something like that.</p>
<p>If we could just pause on this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll return to superconductivity,</p>
<p>but in this whole journey from a history perspective,</p>
<p>what do you think is the most beautiful</p>
<p>at the intersection of engineering and physics</p>
<p>to you in this whole process</p>
<p>that we talked about with silicon and photolithography,</p>
<p>things that people were able to achieve</p>
<p>in order to push Moore&rsquo;s law forward?</p>
<p>Is it the early days,</p>
<p>the invention of the transistor itself?</p>
<p>Is it some particular cool little thing</p>
<p>that maybe not many people know about?</p>
<p>Like, what do you think is most beautiful</p>
<p>in this whole process, journey?</p>
<p>The most beautiful is a little difficult to answer.</p>
<p>Let me try and sidestep it a little bit</p>
<p>and just say what strikes me about looking</p>
<p>at the history of silicon microelectronics is that,</p>
<p>so when quantum mechanics was developed,</p>
<p>people quickly began applying it to semiconductors</p>
<p>and it was broadly understood</p>
<p>that these are fascinating systems</p>
<p>and people cared about them for their basic physics,</p>
<p>but also their utility as devices.</p>
<p>And then the transistor was invented in the late forties</p>
<p>in a relatively crude experimental setup</p>
<p>where you just crammed a metal electrode</p>
<p>into the semiconductor and that was ingenious.</p>
<p>These people were able to make it work.</p>
<p>But so what I wanna get to that really strikes me</p>
<p>is that in those early days,</p>
<p>there were a number of different semiconductors</p>
<p>that were being considered.</p>
<p>They had different properties, different strengths,</p>
<p>different weaknesses.</p>
<p>Most people thought germanium was the way to go.</p>
<p>It had some nice properties related to things</p>
<p>about how the electrons move inside the lattice.</p>
<p>But other people thought that compound semiconductors</p>
<p>with group three and group five also had</p>
<p>really, really extraordinary properties</p>
<p>that might be conducive to making the best devices.</p>
<p>So there were different groups exploring each of these</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s great, that&rsquo;s how science works.</p>
<p>You have to cast a broad net.</p>
<p>But then what I find striking is why is it that silicon won?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not that germanium is a useless material</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not present in technology</p>
<p>or compound semiconductors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both doing exciting and important things,</p>
<p>slightly more niche applications</p>
<p>whereas silicon is the semiconductor material</p>
<p>for microelectronics which is the platform</p>
<p>for digital computing which has transformed our world.</p>
<p>Why did silicon win?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of a remarkable assemblage of qualities</p>
<p>that no one of them was the clear winner</p>
<p>but it made these sort of compromises</p>
<p>between a number of different influences.</p>
<p>It had that really excellent gate oxide</p>
<p>that allowed us to make MOSFETs,</p>
<p>these high performance transistors,</p>
<p>so quickly and cheaply and easily</p>
<p>without having to do a lot of materials development.</p>
<p>The band gap of silicon is actually,</p>
<p>so in a semiconductor there&rsquo;s an important parameter</p>
<p>which is called the band gap</p>
<p>which tells you there are sort of electrons</p>
<p>that fill up to one level in the energy diagram</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a gap where electrons aren&rsquo;t allowed</p>
<p>to have an energy in a certain range</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s another energy level above that.</p>
<p>And that difference between the lower sort of filled level</p>
<p>and the unoccupied level,</p>
<p>that tells you how much voltage you have to apply</p>
<p>in order to induce a current to flow.</p>
<p>So with germanium, that&rsquo;s about 0.75 electron volts.</p>
<p>That means you have to apply 0.75 volts</p>
<p>to get a current moving.</p>
<p>And it turns out that if you compare that</p>
<p>to the thermal excitations that are induced</p>
<p>just by the temperature of our environment,</p>
<p>that gap&rsquo;s not quite big enough.</p>
<p>You start to use it to perform computations,</p>
<p>it gets a little hot and you get all these accidental</p>
<p>carriers that are excited into the conduction band</p>
<p>and it causes errors in your computation.</p>
<p>Silicon&rsquo;s band gap is just a little higher,</p>
<p>1.1 electron volts,</p>
<p>but you have an exponential dependence</p>
<p>on the number of carriers that are present</p>
<p>that can induce those errors.</p>
<p>It decays exponentially with that voltage.</p>
<p>So just that slight extra energy in that band gap</p>
<p>really puts it in an ideal position to be operated</p>
<p>in the conditions of our ambient environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating that, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>errors decrease exponentially with the voltage.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny because this error thing comes up</p>
<p>when you start talking about quantum computing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of amazing that everything</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about, the errors,</p>
<p>as we scale down, seems to be extremely low.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And like all of our computation is based</p>
<p>on the assumption that it&rsquo;s extremely low.</p>
<p>Yes, well it&rsquo;s digital computation.</p>
<p>Digital, sorry, digital computation.</p>
<p>So as opposed to our biological computation in our brain,</p>
<p>is like the assumption is stuff is gonna fail</p>
<p>all over the place and we somehow</p>
<p>have to still be robust to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So this also, this is gonna be the most controversial part</p>
<p>of our conversation where you&rsquo;re gonna make some enemies.</p>
<p>So let me ask,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve been talking about physics and engineering.</p>
<p>Which group of people is smarter</p>
<p>and more important for this one?</p>
<p>Let me ask the question in a better way.</p>
<p>Some of the big innovations,</p>
<p>some of the beautiful things that we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>how much of it is physics?</p>
<p>How much of it is engineering?</p>
<p>My dad is a physicist and he talks down</p>
<p>to all the amazing engineering that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>in the artificial intelligence and the computer science</p>
<p>and the robotics and all that space.</p>
<p>So we argue about this all the time.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Who gets more credit?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely not trying to just be politically correct here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how you would have any of the,</p>
<p>what we consider sort of the great accomplishments</p>
<p>of society without both.</p>
<p>You absolutely need both of those things.</p>
<p>Physics tends to play a key role earlier in the development</p>
<p>and then engineering optimization, these things take over.</p>
<p>And I mean, the invention of the transistor</p>
<p>or actually even before that,</p>
<p>the understanding of semiconductor physics</p>
<p>that allowed the invention of the transistor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all physics.</p>
<p>So if you didn&rsquo;t have that physics,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even get to get on the field.</p>
<p>But once you have understood and demonstrated</p>
<p>that this is in principle possible,</p>
<p>more so as engineering.</p>
<p>Why we have computers more powerful</p>
<p>than old supercomputers in each of our phones,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all engineering.</p>
<p>And I think I would be quite foolish to say</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not valuable, that&rsquo;s not a great contribution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful dance.</p>
<p>Would you put like Silicon,</p>
<p>the understanding of the material properties</p>
<p>in the space of engineering?</p>
<p>Like how does that whole process work?</p>
<p>To understand that it has all these nice properties</p>
<p>or even the development of photolithography,</p>
<p>is that basically,</p>
<p>would you put that in a category of engineering?</p>
<p>No, I would say that it is basic physics,</p>
<p>it is applied physics, it&rsquo;s material science,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s X ray crystallography, it&rsquo;s polymer chemistry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>Chemistry even is thrown in there?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Just no biology.</p>
<p>We can get to biology.</p>
<p>Or the biologies and the humans</p>
<p>that are engineering the system,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s all integrated deeply.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s return,</p>
<p>you mentioned this word superconductivity.</p>
<p>So what does that have to do with what we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Right, okay, so in a semiconductor,</p>
<p>as I tried to describe a second ago,</p>
<p>you can sort of induce currents by applying voltages</p>
<p>and those have sort of typical properties</p>
<p>that you would expect from some kind of a conductor.</p>
<p>Those electrons, they don&rsquo;t just flow</p>
<p>perfectly without dissipation.</p>
<p>If an electron collides with an imperfection in the lattice</p>
<p>or another electron, it&rsquo;s gonna slow down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna lose its momentum.</p>
<p>So you have to keep applying that voltage</p>
<p>in order to keep the current flowing.</p>
<p>In a superconductor, something different happens.</p>
<p>If you get a current to start flowing,</p>
<p>it will continue to flow indefinitely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no dissipation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>How does that happen?</p>
<p>Well, it happens at low temperature and this is crucial.</p>
<p>It has to be a quite low temperature</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m talking about there,</p>
<p>for essentially all of our conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be talking about conventional superconductors,</p>
<p>sometimes called low TC superconductors,</p>
<p>low critical temperature superconductors.</p>
<p>And so those materials have to be at a temperature around,</p>
<p>say around four Kelvin.</p>
<p>I mean, their critical temperature might be 10 Kelvin,</p>
<p>something like that,</p>
<p>but you wanna operate them at around four Kelvin,</p>
<p>four degrees above absolute zero.</p>
<p>And what happens at that temperature,</p>
<p>at very low temperatures in certain materials</p>
<p>is that the noise of atoms moving around,</p>
<p>the lattice vibrating, electrons colliding with each other,</p>
<p>that becomes sufficiently low</p>
<p>that the electrons can settle into this very special state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes referred to as a macroscopic quantum state</p>
<p>because if I had a piece of superconducting material here,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say niobium is a very typical superconductor.</p>
<p>If I had a block of niobium here</p>
<p>and we cooled it below its critical temperature,</p>
<p>all of the electrons in that superconducting state</p>
<p>would be in one coherent quantum state.</p>
<p>The wave function of that state is described</p>
<p>in terms of all of the particles simultaneously,</p>
<p>but it extends across macroscopic dimensions,</p>
<p>the size of whatever block of that material</p>
<p>I have sitting here.</p>
<p>And the way this occurs is that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try to be a little bit light on the technical details,</p>
<p>but essentially the electrons coordinate with each other.</p>
<p>They are able to, in this macroscopic quantum state,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to sort of,</p>
<p>one can quickly take the place of the other.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell electrons apart.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re what&rsquo;s known as identical particles.</p>
<p>So if this electron runs into a defect</p>
<p>that would otherwise cause it to scatter,</p>
<p>it can just sort of almost miraculously avoid that defect</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not really in that location.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a macroscopic quantum state</p>
<p>and the entire quantum state</p>
<p>was not scattered by that defect.</p>
<p>So you can get a current that flows without dissipation</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called a supercurrent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of just very much scratching the surface</p>
<p>of superconductivity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very deep and rich physics there,</p>
<p>just probably not the main subject</p>
<p>we need to go into right now.</p>
<p>But it turns out that when you have this material,</p>
<p>you can do usual things like make wires out of it</p>
<p>so you can get current to flow in a straight line on a chip,</p>
<p>but you can also make other devices</p>
<p>that perform different kinds of operations.</p>
<p>Some of them are kind of logic operations</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;d get in a transistor.</p>
<p>The most common or the most,</p>
<p>I would say, diverse in its utility component</p>
<p>is a Josephson junction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not analogous to a transistor</p>
<p>in the sense that if you apply a voltage here,</p>
<p>it changes how much current flows from left to right,</p>
<p>but it is analogous in sort of a sense</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s the go to component</p>
<p>that a circuit engineer is going to use</p>
<p>to start to build up more complexity.</p>
<p>So these junctions serve as gates.</p>
<p>They can serve as gates.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure how concerned to be with semantics,</p>
<p>but let me just briefly say what a Josephson junction is</p>
<p>and we can talk about different ways that they can be used.</p>
<p>Basically, if you have a superconducting wire</p>
<p>and then a small gap of a different material</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not superconducting, an insulator or normal metal,</p>
<p>and then another superconducting wire on the other side,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a Josephson junction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sometimes referred to</p>
<p>as a superconducting weak link.</p>
<p>So you have this superconducting state on one side</p>
<p>and on the other side, and the superconducting wave function</p>
<p>actually tunnels across that gap.</p>
<p>And when you create such a physical entity,</p>
<p>it has very unusual current voltage characteristics.</p>
<p>In that gap, like weird stuff happens.</p>
<p>Through the entire circuit.</p>
<p>So you can imagine, suppose you had a loop set up</p>
<p>that had one of those weak links in the loop.</p>
<p>Current would flow in that loop independent,</p>
<p>even if you hadn&rsquo;t applied a voltage to it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called the Josephson effect.</p>
<p>So the fact that there&rsquo;s this phase difference</p>
<p>in the quantum wave function from one side</p>
<p>of the tunneling barrier to the other</p>
<p>induces current to flow.</p>
<p>So how does you change state?</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So how do you change state?</p>
<p>Now picture if I have a current bias coming down</p>
<p>this line of my circuit and there&rsquo;s a Josephson junction</p>
<p>right in the middle of it.</p>
<p>And now I make another wire</p>
<p>that goes around the Josephson junction.</p>
<p>So I have a loop here, a superconducting loop.</p>
<p>I can add current to that loop by exceeding</p>
<p>the critical current of that Josephson junction.</p>
<p>So like any superconducting material,</p>
<p>it can carry this supercurrent that I&rsquo;ve described,</p>
<p>this current that can propagate without dissipation</p>
<p>up to a certain level.</p>
<p>And if you try and pass more current than that</p>
<p>through the material, it&rsquo;s going to become</p>
<p>a resistive material, normal material.</p>
<p>So in the Josephson junction, the same thing happens.</p>
<p>I can bias it above its critical current.</p>
<p>And then what it&rsquo;s going to do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to add a quantized amount of current</p>
<p>into that loop.</p>
<p>And what I mean by quantized is it&rsquo;s going to come</p>
<p>in discrete packets with a well defined value of current.</p>
<p>So in the vernacular of some people working</p>
<p>in this community, you would say you pop a flux on</p>
<p>into the loop.</p>
<p>So a flux on.</p>
<p>You pop a flux on into the loop.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a flux on.</p>
<p>Sounds like skateboarder talk, I love it.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>A flux on is one of these quantized sort of amounts</p>
<p>of current that you can add to a loop.</p>
<p>And this is a cartoon picture,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s sufficient for our purposes.</p>
<p>So which, maybe it&rsquo;s useful to say,</p>
<p>what is the speed at which these discrete packets</p>
<p>of current travel?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ll be talking about light a little bit.</p>
<p>It seems like the speed is important.</p>
<p>The speed is important, that&rsquo;s an excellent question.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder where you, how you became so astute.</p>
<p>But so this.</p>
<p>Matrix 4 is coming out, so maybe that&rsquo;s related.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dressed for the job.</p>
<p>I was trying to get to become an extra on Matrix 4,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>Anyway, so what&rsquo;s the speed of these packets?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to find another gig.</p>
<p>I know, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>So the speed of the pack is actually these flux ons,</p>
<p>these sort of pulses of current</p>
<p>that are generated by Joseph&rsquo;s injunctions,</p>
<p>they can actually propagate very close</p>
<p>to the speed of light,</p>
<p>maybe something like a third of the speed of light.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite fast.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons why Joseph&rsquo;s injunctions are appealing</p>
<p>is because their signals can propagate quite fast</p>
<p>and they can also switch very fast.</p>
<p>What I mean by switch is perform that operation</p>
<p>that I described where you add current to the loop.</p>
<p>That can happen within a few tens of picoseconds.</p>
<p>So you can get devices that operate</p>
<p>in the hundreds of gigahertz range.</p>
<p>And by comparison, most processors</p>
<p>in our conventional computers operate closer</p>
<p>to the one gigahertz range, maybe three gigahertz</p>
<p>seems to be kind of where those speeds have leveled out.</p>
<p>The gamers listening to this are getting really excited</p>
<p>to overclock their system to like, what is it?</p>
<p>Like four gigahertz or something,</p>
<p>a hundred sounds incredible.</p>
<p>Can I just as a tiny tangent,</p>
<p>is the physics of this understood well</p>
<p>how to do this stably?</p>
<p>Oh yes, the physics is understood well.</p>
<p>The physics of Joseph&rsquo;s injunctions is understood well.</p>
<p>The technology is understood quite well too.</p>
<p>The reasons why it hasn&rsquo;t displaced</p>
<p>silicon microelectronics in conventional digital computing</p>
<p>I think are more related to what I was alluding to before</p>
<p>about the myriad practical, almost mundane aspects</p>
<p>of silicon that make it so useful.</p>
<p>You can make a transistor ever smaller and smaller</p>
<p>and it will still perform its digital function quite well.</p>
<p>The same is not true of a Joseph&rsquo;s injunction.</p>
<p>You really, they don&rsquo;t, they just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the same thing that there&rsquo;s this feature</p>
<p>that you can keep making smaller and smaller</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll keep performing the same operations.</p>
<p>This loop I described, any Joseph&rsquo;s in circuit,</p>
<p>well, I wanna be careful, I shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>any Joseph&rsquo;s in circuit, but many Joseph&rsquo;s in circuits,</p>
<p>the way they process information</p>
<p>or the way they perform whatever function it is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s sensing a weak magnetic field,</p>
<p>it depends on an interplay between the junction</p>
<p>and that loop.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t make that loop much smaller.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not for practical reasons</p>
<p>that have to do with lithography.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for fundamental physical reasons</p>
<p>about the way the magnetic field interacts</p>
<p>with that superconducting material.</p>
<p>There are physical limits that no matter how good</p>
<p>our technology got, those circuits would,</p>
<p>I think would never be able to be scaled down</p>
<p>to the densities that silicon microelectronics can.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we mentioned,</p>
<p>is there something interesting</p>
<p>about the various superconducting materials involved</p>
<p>or is it all?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not silicon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not silicon, no.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s some materials that also required</p>
<p>to be super cold, four Kelvin and so on.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s dissect a couple of those different things.</p>
<p>The super cold part,</p>
<p>let me just mention for your gamers out there</p>
<p>that are trying to clock it at four gigahertz</p>
<p>and would love to go to 400.</p>
<p>What kind of cooling system can achieve four Kelvin?</p>
<p>Four Kelvin, you need liquid helium.</p>
<p>And so liquid helium is expensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inconvenient.</p>
<p>You need a cryostat that sits there</p>
<p>and the energy consumption of that cryostat</p>
<p>is impracticable for, it&rsquo;s not going in your cell phone.</p>
<p>So you can picture holding your cell phone like this</p>
<p>and then something the size of a keg of beer or something</p>
<p>on your back to cool it.</p>
<p>Like that makes no sense.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to make this in consumer devices,</p>
<p>electronics that are ubiquitous across society,</p>
<p>superconductors are not in the race for that.</p>
<p>For now, but you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>so just to frame the conversation,</p>
<p>maybe the thing we&rsquo;re focused on</p>
<p>is computing systems that serve as servers, like large.</p>
<p>Yes, large systems.</p>
<p>So then you can contrast what&rsquo;s going on in your cell phone</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on at one of the supercomputers.</p>
<p>Colleague Katie Schuman invited us out to Oak Ridge</p>
<p>a few years ago, so we got to see Titan</p>
<p>and that was when they were building Summit.</p>
<p>So these are some high performance supercomputers</p>
<p>out in Tennessee and those are filling entire rooms</p>
<p>the size of warehouses.</p>
<p>So once you&rsquo;re at that level, okay,</p>
<p>there you&rsquo;re already putting a lot of power into cooling.</p>
<p>Cooling is part of your engineering task</p>
<p>that you have to deal with.</p>
<p>So there it&rsquo;s not entirely obvious</p>
<p>that cooling to four Kelvin is out of the question.</p>
<p>It has not happened yet and I can speak to why that is</p>
<p>in the digital domain if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think superconductors are gonna replace</p>
<p>semiconductors for digital computation.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons for that,</p>
<p>but I think ultimately what it comes down to</p>
<p>is all things considered cooling errors,</p>
<p>scaling down to feature sizes, all that stuff,</p>
<p>semiconductors work better at the system level.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of just curious</p>
<p>about the historical momentum of this?</p>
<p>Is there some power to the momentum of an industry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mass manufacturing using a certain material?</p>
<p>Is this like a Titanic shifting?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s your sense when a good idea comes along,</p>
<p>how good does that idea need to be</p>
<p>for the Titanic to start shifting?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent way to frame it.</p>
<p>And you know, I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that,</p>
<p>but what I think is, okay,</p>
<p>so the history of the superconducting logic</p>
<p>goes back to the 70s.</p>
<p>IBM made a big push to do</p>
<p>superconducting digital computing in the 70s.</p>
<p>And they made some choices about their devices</p>
<p>and their architectures and things that in hindsight,</p>
<p>were kind of doomed to fail.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean any disrespect for the people that did it,</p>
<p>it was hard to see at the time.</p>
<p>But then another generation of superconducting logic</p>
<p>was introduced, I wanna say the 90s,</p>
<p>someone named Lykarev and Seminov,</p>
<p>they proposed an entire family of circuits</p>
<p>based on Joseph&rsquo;s injunctions</p>
<p>that are doing digital computing based on logic gates</p>
<p>and or not these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And they showed how it could go hundreds of times faster</p>
<p>than silicon microelectronics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s extremely exciting.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t working in the field at that time,</p>
<p>but later when I went back and read the literature,</p>
<p>I was just like, wow, this is so awesome.</p>
<p>And so you might think, well,</p>
<p>the reason why it didn&rsquo;t display silicon</p>
<p>is because silicon already had so much momentum</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>But that was the 90s.</p>
<p>Silicon kept that momentum</p>
<p>because it had the simple way to keep getting better.</p>
<p>You just make features smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>So it would have to be,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it would have to be that much better</p>
<p>than silicon to displace it.</p>
<p>But the problem is it&rsquo;s just not better than silicon.</p>
<p>It might be better than silicon in one metric,</p>
<p>speed of a switching operation</p>
<p>or power consumption of a switching operation.</p>
<p>But building a digital computer is a lot more</p>
<p>than just that elemental operation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything that goes into it,</p>
<p>including the manufacturing, including the packaging,</p>
<p>including the various materials aspects of things.</p>
<p>So the reason why,</p>
<p>and even in some of those early papers,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember which one it was,</p>
<p>Lykarev said something along the lines of,</p>
<p>you can see how we could build an entire family</p>
<p>of digital electronic circuits based on these components.</p>
<p>They could go a hundred or more times faster</p>
<p>than semiconductor logic gates.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right way</p>
<p>to use superconducting electronic circuits.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say what the right way was,</p>
<p>but he basically said digital logic,</p>
<p>trying to steal the show from silicon</p>
<p>is probably not what these circuits</p>
<p>are most suited to accomplish.</p>
<p>So if we can just linger and use the word computation.</p>
<p>When you talk about computation, how do you think about it?</p>
<p>Do you think purely on just the switching,</p>
<p>or do you think something a little bit larger scale,</p>
<p>a circuit taken together,</p>
<p>performing the basic arithmetic operations</p>
<p>that are then required to do the kind of computation</p>
<p>that makes up a computer?</p>
<p>Because when we talk about the speed of computation,</p>
<p>is it boiled down to the basic switching,</p>
<p>or is there some bigger picture</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re thinking about?</p>
<p>Well, all right, so maybe we should disambiguate.</p>
<p>There are a variety of different kinds of computation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to be an expert</p>
<p>in the theory of computation or anything like that.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s important to differentiate though</p>
<p>between digital logic,</p>
<p>which represents information as a series of bits,</p>
<p>binary digits, which you can think of them</p>
<p>as zeros and ones or whatever.</p>
<p>Usually they correspond to a physical system</p>
<p>that has two very well separated states.</p>
<p>And then other kinds of computation,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ll get into more the way your brain works,</p>
<p>which it is, I think,</p>
<p>indisputably processing information,</p>
<p>but where the computation begins and ends</p>
<p>is not anywhere near as well defined.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t depend on these two levels.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a zero, here&rsquo;s a one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of gray area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually referred to as analog computing.</p>
<p>Also in conventional digital computers</p>
<p>or digital computers in general,</p>
<p>you have a concept of what&rsquo;s called arithmetic depth,</p>
<p>which is jargon that basically means</p>
<p>how many sequential operations are performed</p>
<p>to turn an input into an output.</p>
<p>And those kinds of computations in digital systems</p>
<p>are highly serial, meaning that data streams,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t branch off too far to the side.</p>
<p>You do, you have to pull some information over there</p>
<p>and access memory from here and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But by and large, the computation proceeds</p>
<p>in a serial manner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that way in the brain.</p>
<p>In the brain, you&rsquo;re always drawing information</p>
<p>from different places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more network based computing.</p>
<p>Neurons don&rsquo;t wait for their turn.</p>
<p>They fire when they&rsquo;re ready to fire.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s asynchronous.</p>
<p>So one of the other things about a digital system</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re performing these operations on a clock.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a crucial aspect of it.</p>
<p>Get rid of a clock in a digital system,</p>
<p>nothing makes sense anymore.</p>
<p>The brain has no clock.</p>
<p>It builds its own timescales based on its internal activity.</p>
<p>So you can think of the brain as kind of like this,</p>
<p>like network computation,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s actually really trivial, simple computers,</p>
<p>just a huge number of them and they&rsquo;re networked.</p>
<p>I would say it is complex, sophisticated little processors</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a huge number of them.</p>
<p>Neurons are not, are not simple.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to offend neurons.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very complicated and beautiful and yeah,</p>
<p>but we often oversimplify them.</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re actually like there&rsquo;s computation happening</p>
<p>within a neuron.</p>
<p>Right, so I would say to think of a transistor</p>
<p>as the building block of a digital computer is accurate.</p>
<p>You use a few transistors to make your logic gates.</p>
<p>You build up more, you build up processors</p>
<p>from logic gates and things like that.</p>
<p>So you can think of a transistor</p>
<p>as a fundamental building block,</p>
<p>or you can think of,</p>
<p>as we get into more highly parallelized architectures,</p>
<p>you can think of a processor</p>
<p>as a fundamental building block.</p>
<p>To make the analogy to the neuro side of things,</p>
<p>a neuron is not a transistor.</p>
<p>A neuron is a processor.</p>
<p>It has synapses, even synapses are not transistors,</p>
<p>but they are more,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lower on the information processing hierarchy</p>
<p>in a sense.</p>
<p>They do a bulk of the computation,</p>
<p>but neurons are entire processors in and of themselves</p>
<p>that can take in many different kinds of inputs</p>
<p>on many different spatial and temporal scales</p>
<p>and produce many different kinds of outputs</p>
<p>so that they can perform different computations</p>
<p>in different contexts.</p>
<p>So this is where enters this distinction</p>
<p>between computation and communication.</p>
<p>So you can think of neurons performing computation</p>
<p>and the inter, the networking,</p>
<p>the interconnectivity of neurons</p>
<p>is communication between neurons.</p>
<p>And you see this with very large server systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, I mentioned offline,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking to Jim Keller,</p>
<p>whose dream is to build giant computers</p>
<p>that, you know, the bottom like there</p>
<p>is often the communication</p>
<p>between the different pieces of computing.</p>
<p>So in this paper that we mentioned,</p>
<p>Optoelectronic Intelligence,</p>
<p>you say electrons excel at computation</p>
<p>while light is excellent for communication.</p>
<p>Maybe you can linger and say in this context,</p>
<p>what do you mean by computation and communication?</p>
<p>What are electrons, what is light</p>
<p>and why do they excel at those two tasks?</p>
<p>Yeah, just to first speak to computation</p>
<p>versus communication,</p>
<p>I would say computation is essentially taking in</p>
<p>some information, performing operations</p>
<p>on that information and producing new,</p>
<p>hopefully more useful information.</p>
<p>So for example, imagine you have a picture in front of you</p>
<p>and there is a key in it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, you wanna find the key,</p>
<p>we all wanna find the key.</p>
<p>So the input is that entire picture</p>
<p>and the output might be the coordinates where the key is.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve reduced the total amount of information you have</p>
<p>but you found the useful information</p>
<p>for you in that present moment,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the useful information.</p>
<p>And you think about this computation</p>
<p>as the controlled synchronous sequential?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, it could be,</p>
<p>that could be how your system is performing the computation</p>
<p>or it could be asynchronous,</p>
<p>there are lots of ways to find the key.</p>
<p>It depends on the nature of the data,</p>
<p>it depends on, that&rsquo;s a very simplified example,</p>
<p>a picture with a key in it,</p>
<p>what about if you&rsquo;re in the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to decide the best way</p>
<p>to live your life?</p>
<p>It might be interactive,</p>
<p>it might be there might be some recurrence</p>
<p>or some weird asynchrony, I got it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an input and there&rsquo;s an output</p>
<p>and you do some stuff in the middle</p>
<p>that actually goes from the input to the output.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taken in information</p>
<p>and output different information,</p>
<p>hopefully reducing the total amount of information</p>
<p>and extracting what&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>Communication is then getting that information</p>
<p>from the location at which it&rsquo;s stored</p>
<p>because information is physical as Landauer emphasized</p>
<p>and so it is in one place</p>
<p>and you need to get that information to another place</p>
<p>so that something else can use it</p>
<p>for whatever computation it&rsquo;s working on.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s part of the same network</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re all trying to solve the same problem</p>
<p>but neuron A over here just deduced something</p>
<p>based on its inputs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now sending that information across the network</p>
<p>to another location</p>
<p>so that would be the act of communication.</p>
<p>Can you linger on Landauer</p>
<p>and saying information is physical?</p>
<p>Rolf Landauer, not to be confused with Lev Landauer.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he made huge contributions</p>
<p>to our understanding of the reversibility of information</p>
<p>and this concept that energy has to be dissipated</p>
<p>in computing when the computation is irreversible</p>
<p>but if you can manage to make it reversible</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t need to expend energy</p>
<p>but if you do expend energy to perform a computation</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of a minimal amount that you have to do</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s KT log two.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all somehow related</p>
<p>to the second law of thermodynamics</p>
<p>and that the universe is an information process</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re living in a simulation.</p>
<p>So okay, sorry, sorry for that tangent.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the defining the distinction</p>
<p>between computation and communication.</p>
<p>Let me say one more thing just to clarify.</p>
<p>Communication ideally does not change the information.</p>
<p>It moves it from one place to another</p>
<p>but it is preserved.</p>
<p>Got it, okay.</p>
<p>All right, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>So then the electron versus light distinction</p>
<p>and why are electrons good at computation</p>
<p>and light good at communication?</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot that goes into it I guess</p>
<p>but just try to speak to the simplest part of it.</p>
<p>Electrons interact strongly with one another.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re charged particles.</p>
<p>So if I pile a bunch of them over here</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re feeling a certain amount of force</p>
<p>and they wanna move somewhere else.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re strongly interactive.</p>
<p>You can also get them to sit still.</p>
<p>You can, an electron has a mass</p>
<p>so you can cause it to be spatially localized.</p>
<p>So for computation that&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>because now I can make these little devices</p>
<p>that put a bunch of electrons over here</p>
<p>and then I change the state of a gate</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been describing,</p>
<p>put a different voltage on this gate</p>
<p>and now I move the electrons over here.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re sitting somewhere else.</p>
<p>I have a physical mechanism</p>
<p>with which I can represent information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s spatially localized and I have knobs</p>
<p>that I can adjust to change where those electrons are</p>
<p>or what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Light by contrast, photons of light</p>
<p>which are the discrete packets of energy</p>
<p>that were identified by Einstein,</p>
<p>they do not interact with each other</p>
<p>especially at low light levels.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a medium and you have a bright high light level</p>
<p>you can get them to interact with each other</p>
<p>through the interaction with that medium that they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a little bit more exotic.</p>
<p>And for the purposes of this conversation</p>
<p>we can assume that photons don&rsquo;t interact with each other.</p>
<p>So if you have a bunch of them</p>
<p>all propagating in the same direction</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t interfere with each other.</p>
<p>If I wanna send, if I have a communication channel</p>
<p>and I put one more photon on it,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t screw up with those other ones.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t change what those other ones were doing at all.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really useful for communication</p>
<p>because that means you can sort of allow</p>
<p>a lot of these photons to flow</p>
<p>without disruption of each other</p>
<p>and they can branch really easily and things like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not good for computation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very hard for this packet of light</p>
<p>to change what this packet of light is doing.</p>
<p>They pass right through each other.</p>
<p>So in computation you want to change information</p>
<p>and if photons don&rsquo;t interact with each other</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to get them to change the information</p>
<p>represented by the others.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the fundamental difference.</p>
<p>Is there also something about the way they travel</p>
<p>through different materials</p>
<p>or is that just a particular engineering?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s deep physics I think.</p>
<p>So this gets back to electrons interact with each other</p>
<p>and photons don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So say I&rsquo;m trying to get a packet of information</p>
<p>from me to you and we have a wire going between us.</p>
<p>In order for me to send electrons across that wire</p>
<p>I first have to raise the voltage on my end of the wire</p>
<p>and that means putting a bunch of charges on it</p>
<p>and then that charge packet has to propagate along the wire</p>
<p>and it has to get all the way over to you.</p>
<p>That wire is gonna have something that&rsquo;s called capacitance</p>
<p>which basically tells you how much charge</p>
<p>you need to put on the wire</p>
<p>in order to raise the voltage on it</p>
<p>and the capacitance is gonna be proportional</p>
<p>to the length of the wire.</p>
<p>So the longer the length of the wire is</p>
<p>the more charge I have to put on it</p>
<p>and the energy required to charge up that line</p>
<p>and move those electrons to you</p>
<p>is also proportional to the capacitance</p>
<p>and goes as the voltage squared.</p>
<p>So you get this huge penalty if you wanna send electrons</p>
<p>across a wire over appreciable distances.</p>
<p>So distance is an important thing here</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing communication.</p>
<p>Distance is an important thing.</p>
<p>So is the number of connections I&rsquo;m trying to make.</p>
<p>Me to you, okay one, that&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
<p>If I want to now send it to 10,000 other friends</p>
<p>then all of those wires are adding tons</p>
<p>of extra capacitance.</p>
<p>Now not only does it take forever</p>
<p>to put the charge on that wire</p>
<p>and raise the voltage on all those lines</p>
<p>but it takes a ton of power</p>
<p>and the number 10,000 is not randomly chosen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s roughly how many connections</p>
<p>each neuron in your brain makes.</p>
<p>So a neuron in your brain needs to send 10,000 messages</p>
<p>every time it has something to say.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that if you&rsquo;re trying to drive electrons</p>
<p>from here to 10,000 different places.</p>
<p>The brain does it in a slightly different way</p>
<p>which we can discuss.</p>
<p>How can light achieve the 10,000 connections</p>
<p>and why is it better?</p>
<p>In terms of like the energy use required</p>
<p>to use light for the communication of the 10,000 connections.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So now instead of trying to send electrons</p>
<p>from me to you, I&rsquo;m trying to send photons.</p>
<p>So I can make what&rsquo;s called a wave guide</p>
<p>which is just a simple piece of a material.</p>
<p>It could be glass like an optical fiber</p>
<p>or silicon on a chip.</p>
<p>And I just have to inject photons into that wave guide</p>
<p>and independent of how long it is,</p>
<p>independent of how many different connections I&rsquo;m making,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t change the voltage or anything like that</p>
<p>that I have to raise up on the wire.</p>
<p>So if I have one more connection,</p>
<p>if I add additional connections,</p>
<p>I need to add more light to the wave guide</p>
<p>because those photons need to split</p>
<p>and go to different paths.</p>
<p>That makes sense but I don&rsquo;t have a capacitive penalty.</p>
<p>Sometimes these are called wiring parasitics.</p>
<p>There are no parasitics associated with light</p>
<p>in that same sense.</p>
<p>So this might be a dumb question</p>
<p>but how do I catch a photon on the other end?</p>
<p>Is it material?</p>
<p>Is it the polymer stuff you were talking about</p>
<p>for a different application for photolithography?</p>
<p>Like how do you catch a photon?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to catch a photon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a dumb question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep and important question</p>
<p>that basically defines a lot of the work</p>
<p>that goes on in our group at NIST.</p>
<p>One of my group leaders, Seywoon Nam,</p>
<p>has built his career around</p>
<p>these superconducting single photon detectors.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to try to sort of reach a lower limit</p>
<p>and detect just one particle of light,</p>
<p>superconductors come back into our conversation</p>
<p>and just picture a simple device</p>
<p>where you have current flowing</p>
<p>through a superconducting wire and&hellip;</p>
<p>A loop again or no?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say yes, you have a loop.</p>
<p>So you have a superconducting wire</p>
<p>that goes straight down like this</p>
<p>and on your loop branch, you have a little ammeter,</p>
<p>something that measures current.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a resistor up there too.</p>
<p>Go with me here.</p>
<p>So your current biasing this,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s current flowing</p>
<p>through that superconducting branch.</p>
<p>Since there&rsquo;s a resistor over here,</p>
<p>all the current goes through the superconducting branch.</p>
<p>Now a photon comes in, strikes that superconductor.</p>
<p>We talked about this superconducting</p>
<p>macroscopic quantum state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be destroyed by the energy of that photon.</p>
<p>So now that branch of the circuit is resistive too.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve properly designed your circuit</p>
<p>so that the resistance on that superconducting branch</p>
<p>is much greater than the other resistance.</p>
<p>Now all of your current&rsquo;s going to go that way.</p>
<p>Your ammeter says, oh, I just got a pulse of current.</p>
<p>That must mean I detected a photon.</p>
<p>Then where you broke that superconductivity</p>
<p>in a matter of a few nanoseconds,</p>
<p>it cools back off, dissipates that energy</p>
<p>and the current flows back</p>
<p>through that superconducting branch.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful superconducting device</p>
<p>that allows us to understand quantum states of light.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize a loop like that</p>
<p>could be sensitive to a single photon.</p>
<p>I mean, that seems strange to me because,</p>
<p>I mean, so what happens when you just barrage it</p>
<p>with photons?</p>
<p>If you put a bunch of photons in there,</p>
<p>essentially the same thing happens.</p>
<p>You just drive it into the normal state,</p>
<p>it becomes resistive and it&rsquo;s not particularly interesting.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful how many photons you send.</p>
<p>Like you have to be very precise with your communication.</p>
<p>Well, it depends.</p>
<p>So I would say that that&rsquo;s actually in the application</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to use these detectors for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a feature because what we want is for,</p>
<p>if a neuron sends one photon to a synaptic connection</p>
<p>and one of these superconducting detectors is sitting there,</p>
<p>you get this pulse of current.</p>
<p>And that synapse says event,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m gonna do what I do when there&rsquo;s a synapse event,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna perform computations, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But if accidentally you send two there or three or five,</p>
<p>it does the exact same.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And so this is how in the system that we&rsquo;re devising here,</p>
<p>communication is entirely binary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I tried to emphasize a second ago.</p>
<p>Communication should not change the information.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not saying, oh, I got this kind of communication</p>
<p>event for photons.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not keeping track of that.</p>
<p>This neuron fired, this synapse says that neuron fired,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a noise filtering property of those detectors.</p>
<p>However, there are other applications</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d rather know the exact number of photons</p>
<p>that can be very useful in quantum computing with light.</p>
<p>And our group does a lot of work</p>
<p>around another kind of superconducting sensor</p>
<p>called a transition edge sensor that Adrian Alita</p>
<p>in our group does a lot of work on that.</p>
<p>And that can tell you based on the amplitude</p>
<p>of the current pulse you divert exactly how many photons</p>
<p>were in that pulse.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that useful for?</p>
<p>One way that you can encode information</p>
<p>in quantum states of light is in the number of photons.</p>
<p>You can have what are called number states</p>
<p>and a number state will have a well defined number</p>
<p>of photons and maybe the output of your quantum computation</p>
<p>encodes its information in the number of photons</p>
<p>that are generated.</p>
<p>So if you have a detector that is sensitive to that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely useful.</p>
<p>Can you achieve like a clock with photons</p>
<p>or is that not important?</p>
<p>Is there a synchronicity here?</p>
<p>In general, it can be important.</p>
<p>Clock distribution is a big challenge</p>
<p>in especially large computational systems.</p>
<p>And so yes, optical clocks, optical clock distribution</p>
<p>is a very powerful technology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the state of that field right now,</p>
<p>but I imagine that if you&rsquo;re trying to distribute a clock</p>
<p>across any appreciable size computational system,</p>
<p>you wanna use light.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder how these giant systems work,</p>
<p>especially like supercomputers.</p>
<p>Do they need to do clock distribution</p>
<p>or are they doing more ad hoc parallel</p>
<p>like concurrent programming?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some kind of locking mechanisms or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating question,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s zoom in at this very particular question</p>
<p>of computation on a processor</p>
<p>and communication between processors.</p>
<p>So what does this system look like</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re envisioning?</p>
<p>One of the places you&rsquo;re envisioning it</p>
<p>is in the paper on optoelectronic intelligence.</p>
<p>So what are we talking about?</p>
<p>Are we talking about something</p>
<p>that starts to look a lot like the human brain</p>
<p>or does it still look a lot like a computer?</p>
<p>What are the size of this thing?</p>
<p>Is it going inside a smartphone or as you said,</p>
<p>does it go inside something that&rsquo;s more like a house?</p>
<p>Like what should we be imagining?</p>
<p>What are you thinking about</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about these fundamental systems?</p>
<p>Let me introduce the word neuromorphic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this concept of neuromorphic computing</p>
<p>where what that broadly refers to</p>
<p>is computing based on the information processing principles</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>And as digital computing seems to be pushing</p>
<p>towards some fundamental performance limits,</p>
<p>people are considering architectural advances,</p>
<p>drawing inspiration from the brain,</p>
<p>more distributed parallel network kind of architectures</p>
<p>and stuff.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this continuum of neuromorphic</p>
<p>from things that are pretty similar to digital computers,</p>
<p>but maybe there are more cores</p>
<p>and the way they send messages is a little bit more</p>
<p>like the way brain neurons send spikes.</p>
<p>But for the most part, it&rsquo;s still digital electronics.</p>
<p>And then you have some things in between</p>
<p>where maybe you&rsquo;re using transistors,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re starting to use them</p>
<p>instead of in a digital way, in an analog way.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re trying to get those circuits</p>
<p>to behave more like neurons.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s a little bit,</p>
<p>quite a bit more on the neuromorphic side of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to get your circuits,</p>
<p>although they&rsquo;re still based on silicon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to get them to perform operations</p>
<p>that are highly analogous to the operations in the brain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where a great deal of work is</p>
<p>in neuromorphic computing,</p>
<p>people like Giacomo Indoveri and Gert Kauenberg,</p>
<p>Jennifer Hasler, countless others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rich and exciting field going back to Carver Mead</p>
<p>in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>And then all the way on the other extreme of the continuum</p>
<p>is where you say, I&rsquo;ll give up anything related</p>
<p>to transistors or semiconductors or anything like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not starting with the assumption</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna use any kind</p>
<p>of conventional computing hardware.</p>
<p>And instead, what I wanna do is try and understand</p>
<p>what makes the brain powerful</p>
<p>at the kind of information processing it does.</p>
<p>And I wanna think from first principles</p>
<p>about what hardware is best going to enable us</p>
<p>to capture those information processing principles</p>
<p>in an artificial system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I live.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m doing my exploration these days.</p>
<p>So what are the first principles</p>
<p>of brain like computation communication?</p>
<p>Right, yeah, this is so important</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m glad we booked 14 hours for this because.</p>
<p>I only have 13, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, so the brain is notoriously complicated.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an important part</p>
<p>of why it can do what it does.</p>
<p>But okay, let me try to break it down.</p>
<p>Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said before,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sophisticated devices in and of themselves</p>
<p>and synapses are too.</p>
<p>They can change their state based on the activity.</p>
<p>So they adapt over time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crucial to the way the brain works.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just adapt on one timescale,</p>
<p>they can adapt on myriad timescales</p>
<p>from the spacing between pulses,</p>
<p>the spacing between spikes that come from neurons</p>
<p>all the way to the age of the organism.</p>
<p>Also relevant, perhaps I think the most important thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s guided my thinking is the network structure</p>
<p>of the brain, so.</p>
<p>Which can also be adjusted on different scales.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yes, so you&rsquo;re making new,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re changing the strength of contacts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re changing the spatial distribution of them,</p>
<p>although spatial distribution doesn&rsquo;t change that much</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re a mature organism.</p>
<p>But that network structure is really crucial.</p>
<p>So let me dwell on that for a second.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t talk about the brain without emphasizing</p>
<p>that most of the neurons in the neocortex</p>
<p>or the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain</p>
<p>that we think is most responsible for high level reasoning</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>those neurons make thousands of connections.</p>
<p>So you have this network that is highly interconnected.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that one of the primary reasons</p>
<p>that they make so many different connections</p>
<p>is that allows information to be communicated very rapidly</p>
<p>from any spot in the network</p>
<p>to any other spot in the network.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a sort of spatial aspect of it.</p>
<p>You can quantify this in terms of concepts</p>
<p>that are related to fractals and scale invariants,</p>
<p>which I think is a very beautiful concept.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is kind of,</p>
<p>no matter what spatial scale you&rsquo;re looking at in the brain</p>
<p>within certain bounds, you see the same</p>
<p>general statistical pattern.</p>
<p>So if I draw a box around some region of my cortex,</p>
<p>most of the connections that those neurons</p>
<p>within that box make are gonna be within the box</p>
<p>to each other in their local neighborhood.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of called clustering, loosely speaking.</p>
<p>But a non negligible fraction</p>
<p>is gonna go outside of that box.</p>
<p>And then if I draw a bigger box,</p>
<p>the pattern is gonna be exactly the same.</p>
<p>So you have this scale invariants,</p>
<p>and you also have a non vanishing probability</p>
<p>of a neuron making connection very far away.</p>
<p>So suppose you wanna plot the probability</p>
<p>of a neuron making a connection as a function of distance.</p>
<p>If that were an exponential function,</p>
<p>it would go e to the minus radius</p>
<p>over some characteristic radius,</p>
<p>and it would drop off up to some certain radius,</p>
<p>the probability would be reasonably close to one,</p>
<p>and then beyond that characteristic length R zero,</p>
<p>it would drop off sharply.</p>
<p>And so that would mean that the neurons in your brain</p>
<p>are really localized, and that&rsquo;s not what we observe.</p>
<p>Instead, what you see is that the probability</p>
<p>of making a longer distance connection, it does drop off,</p>
<p>but it drops off as a power law.</p>
<p>So the probability that you&rsquo;re gonna have a connection</p>
<p>at some radius R goes as R to the minus some power.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s more, that&rsquo;s what we see with forces in nature,</p>
<p>like the electromagnetic force</p>
<p>between two particles or gravity</p>
<p>goes as one over the radius squared.</p>
<p>So you can see this in fractals.</p>
<p>I love that there&rsquo;s like a fractal dynamics of the brain</p>
<p>that if you zoom out, you draw the box</p>
<p>and you increase that box by certain step sizes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see the same statistics.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably very important</p>
<p>to the way the brain processes information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just in the spatial domain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also in the temporal domain.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible that this emerged</p>
<p>through the evolutionary process</p>
<p>that potentially somehow connected</p>
<p>to the way the physics of the universe works.</p>
<p>Yeah, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more that it&rsquo;s a deep</p>
<p>and fascinating subject that I hope to be able</p>
<p>to spend the rest of my life studying.</p>
<p>You think you need to solve, understand this,</p>
<p>this fractal nature in order to understand intelligence</p>
<p>and communication. I do think so.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re deeply intertwined.</p>
<p>Yes, I think power laws are right at the heart of it.</p>
<p>So just to push that one through,</p>
<p>the same thing happens in the temporal domain.</p>
<p>So suppose your neurons in your brain</p>
<p>were always oscillating at the same frequency,</p>
<p>then the probability of finding a neuron oscillating</p>
<p>as a function of frequency</p>
<p>would be this narrowly peaked function</p>
<p>around that certain characteristic frequency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not at all what we see.</p>
<p>The probability of finding neurons oscillating</p>
<p>or producing spikes at a certain frequency</p>
<p>is again a power law,</p>
<p>which means there&rsquo;s no defined scale</p>
<p>of the temporal activity in the brain.</p>
<p>At what speed do your thoughts occur?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a fastest speed they can occur</p>
<p>and that is limited by communication and other things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not a characteristic scale.</p>
<p>We have thoughts on all temporal scales</p>
<p>from a few tens of milliseconds,</p>
<p>which is physiologically limited by our devices,</p>
<p>compare that to tens of picoseconds</p>
<p>that I talked about in superconductors,</p>
<p>all the way up to the lifetime of the organism.</p>
<p>You can still think about things</p>
<p>that happened to you when you were a kid.</p>
<p>Or if you wanna be really trippy</p>
<p>then across multiple organisms</p>
<p>in the entirety of human civilization,</p>
<p>you have thoughts that span organisms, right?</p>
<p>Yes, taking it to that level, yes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to see the entirety of the human species</p>
<p>as a single organism with a collective intelligence</p>
<p>and that too on a spatial and temporal scale,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s thoughts occurring.</p>
<p>And then if you look at not just the human species,</p>
<p>but the entirety of life on earth</p>
<p>as an organism with thoughts that are occurring,</p>
<p>that are greater and greater sophisticated thoughts,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a different spatial and temporal scale there.</p>
<p>This is getting very suspicious.</p>
<p>Well, hold on though, before we&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>I just wanna just tie the bow</p>
<p>and say that the spatial and temporal aspects</p>
<p>are intimately interrelated with each other.</p>
<p>So activity between neurons that are very close to each other</p>
<p>is more likely to happen on this faster timescale</p>
<p>and information is gonna propagate</p>
<p>and encompass more of the brain,</p>
<p>more of your cortices, different modules in the brain</p>
<p>are gonna be engaged in information processing</p>
<p>on longer timescales.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this concept of information integration</p>
<p>where neurons are specialized.</p>
<p>Any given neuron or any cluster of neuron</p>
<p>has its specific purpose,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also very much integrated.</p>
<p>So you have neurons that specialize,</p>
<p>but share their information.</p>
<p>And so that happens through these fractal nested oscillations</p>
<p>that occur across spatial and temporal scales.</p>
<p>I think capturing those dynamics in hardware,</p>
<p>to me, that&rsquo;s the goal of neuromorphic computing.</p>
<p>So does it need to look,</p>
<p>so first of all, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>We stated some clear principles here.</p>
<p>Now, does it have to look like the brain</p>
<p>outside of those principles as well?</p>
<p>Like what other characteristics</p>
<p>have to look like the human brain?</p>
<p>Or can it be something very different?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on what you&rsquo;re trying to use it for.</p>
<p>And so I think a lot of the community</p>
<p>asks that question a lot.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do with it?</p>
<p>And I completely get it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very important question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also sometimes not the most helpful question.</p>
<p>What if what you wanna do with it is study it?</p>
<p>What if you just wanna see,</p>
<p>what do you have to build into your hardware</p>
<p>in order to observe these dynamical principles?</p>
<p>And also, I ask myself that question every day</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m able to answer that.</p>
<p>So like, what are you gonna do</p>
<p>with this particular neuromorphic machine?</p>
<p>So suppose what we&rsquo;re trying to do with it</p>
<p>is build something that thinks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to get it to make us any money</p>
<p>or drive a car.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll be able to do that, but that&rsquo;s not our goal.</p>
<p>Our goal is to see if we can get the same types of behaviors</p>
<p>that we observe in our own brain.</p>
<p>And by behaviors in this sense,</p>
<p>what I mean the behaviors of the components,</p>
<p>the neurons, the network, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another element that I didn&rsquo;t really hit on</p>
<p>that you also have to build into this.</p>
<p>And those are architectural principles.</p>
<p>They have to do with the hierarchical modular construction</p>
<p>of the network.</p>
<p>And without getting too lost in jargon,</p>
<p>the main point that I think is relevant there,</p>
<p>let me try and illustrate it with a cartoon picture</p>
<p>of the architecture of the brain.</p>
<p>So in the brain, you have the cortex,</p>
<p>which is sort of this outer sheet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a layered structure.</p>
<p>You can, if you could take it out of your brain,</p>
<p>you could unroll it on the table</p>
<p>and it would be about the size of a pizza sitting there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a module.</p>
<p>It does certain things.</p>
<p>It processes as Yogi Buzaki would say,</p>
<p>it processes the what of what&rsquo;s going on around you.</p>
<p>But you have another really crucial module</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the hippocampus.</p>
<p>And that network is structured entirely differently.</p>
<p>First of all, this cortex that had described</p>
<p>10 billion neurons in there.</p>
<p>So numbers matter here.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re organized in that sort of power law distribution</p>
<p>where the probability of making a connection drops off</p>
<p>as a power law in space.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is another module that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>for understanding how, where you are,</p>
<p>when you are keeping track of your position</p>
<p>in space and time.</p>
<p>And that network is very much random.</p>
<p>So the probability of making a connection,</p>
<p>it almost doesn&rsquo;t even drop off as a function of distance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same probability that you&rsquo;ll make it here</p>
<p>to over there, but there are only about 100 million neurons</p>
<p>there, so you can have that huge densely connected module</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not so big.</p>
<p>And the neocortex or the cortex and the hippocampus,</p>
<p>they talk to each other constantly.</p>
<p>And that communication is largely facilitated</p>
<p>by what&rsquo;s called the thalamus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a neuroscientist here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do my best to recite things.</p>
<p>Cartoon picture of the brain, I gotcha.</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>So this thalamus is coordinating the activity</p>
<p>between the neocortex and the hippocampus</p>
<p>and making sure that they talk to each other</p>
<p>at the right time and send messages</p>
<p>that will be useful to one another.</p>
<p>So this all taken together is called</p>
<p>the thalamocortical complex.</p>
<p>And it seems like building something like that</p>
<p>is going to be crucial to capturing the types of activity</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking for because those responsibilities,</p>
<p>those separate modules, they do different things,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotta be central to achieving these states</p>
<p>of efficient information integration across space and time.</p>
<p>By the way, I am able to achieve this state</p>
<p>by watching simulations, visualizations</p>
<p>of the thalamocortical complex.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few people I forget from where.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve created these incredible visual illustrations</p>
<p>of visual stimulation from the eye or something like that.</p>
<p>And this image flowing through the brain.</p>
<p>Wow, I haven&rsquo;t seen that, I gotta check that out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of those things,</p>
<p>you find this stuff in the world,</p>
<p>and you see on YouTube, it has 1,000 views,</p>
<p>these visualizations of the human brain</p>
<p>processing information.</p>
<p>And because there&rsquo;s chemistry there,</p>
<p>because this is from actual human brains,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re doing the coloring,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re able to actually trace</p>
<p>the different, the chemical and the electrical signals</p>
<p>throughout the brain, and the visual thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, whoa, because it looks kinda like the universe,</p>
<p>I mean, the whole thing is just incredible.</p>
<p>I recommend it highly, I&rsquo;ll probably post a link to it.</p>
<p>But you can just look for, one of the things they simulate</p>
<p>is the thalamocortical complex and just visualization.</p>
<p>You can find that yourself on YouTube, but it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>The other question I have for you is,</p>
<p>how does memory play into all of this?</p>
<p>Because all the signals sending back and forth,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s computation and communication,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kinda like processing of inputs and outputs,</p>
<p>to produce outputs in the system,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kinda like maybe reasoning,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s some kind of recurrence.</p>
<p>But is there a storage mechanism that you think about</p>
<p>in the context of neuromorphic computing?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely, so that&rsquo;s gotta be central.</p>
<p>You have to have a way that you can store memories.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of different kinds</p>
<p>of memory in the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s yet another example of how it&rsquo;s not a simple system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one kind of memory,</p>
<p>one way of talking about memory,</p>
<p>usually starts in the context of Hopfield networks.</p>
<p>You were lucky to talk to John Hopfield on this program.</p>
<p>But the basic idea there is working memory</p>
<p>is stored in the dynamical patterns</p>
<p>of activity between neurons.</p>
<p>And you can think of a certain pattern of activity</p>
<p>as an attractor, meaning if you put in some signal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s similar enough to other</p>
<p>previously experienced signals like that,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to converge to the same network dynamics</p>
<p>and you will see these neurons</p>
<p>participate in the same network patterns of activity</p>
<p>that they have in the past.</p>
<p>So you can talk about the probability</p>
<p>that different inputs will allow you to converge</p>
<p>to different basins of attraction</p>
<p>and you might think of that as,</p>
<p>oh, I saw this face and then I excited</p>
<p>this network pattern of activity</p>
<p>because last time I saw that face,</p>
<p>I was at some movie and that&rsquo;s a famous person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the screen or something like that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one memory storage mechanism.</p>
<p>But crucial to the ability to imprint those memories</p>
<p>in your brain is the ability to change</p>
<p>the strength of connection between one neuron and another,</p>
<p>that synaptic connection between them.</p>
<p>So synaptic weight update is a massive field of neuroscience</p>
<p>and neuromorphic computing as well.</p>
<p>So there are two poles on that spectrum.</p>
<p>Okay, so more in the language of machine learning,</p>
<p>we would talk about supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m trying to tie that down</p>
<p>to neuromorphic computing,</p>
<p>I will use a definition of supervised learning,</p>
<p>which basically means the external user,</p>
<p>the person who&rsquo;s controlling this hardware</p>
<p>has some knob that they can tune</p>
<p>to change each of the synaptic weights,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not the network</p>
<p>is doing what you want it to do.</p>
<p>Whereas what I mean in this conversation</p>
<p>when I say unsupervised learning</p>
<p>is that those synaptic weights</p>
<p>are dynamically changing in your network</p>
<p>based on nothing that the user is doing,</p>
<p>nothing that there&rsquo;s no wire from the outside</p>
<p>going into any of those synapses.</p>
<p>The network itself is reconfiguring those synaptic weights</p>
<p>based on physical properties</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve built into the devices.</p>
<p>So if the synapse receives a pulse from here</p>
<p>and that causes the neuron to spike,</p>
<p>some circuit built in there with no help from me</p>
<p>or anybody else adjust the weight</p>
<p>in a way that makes it more likely</p>
<p>to store the useful information</p>
<p>and excite the useful network patterns</p>
<p>and makes it less likely that random noise,</p>
<p>useless communication events</p>
<p>will have an important effect on the network activity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s memory encoded in the weights,</p>
<p>the synaptic weights.</p>
<p>What about the formation of something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not often done in machine learning,</p>
<p>the formation of new synaptic connections?</p>
<p>Right, well, that seems to,</p>
<p>so again, not a neuroscientist here,</p>
<p>but my reading of the literature</p>
<p>is that that&rsquo;s particularly crucial</p>
<p>in early stages of brain development</p>
<p>where a newborn is born</p>
<p>with tons of extra synaptic connections</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually pruned over time.</p>
<p>So the number of synapses decreases</p>
<p>as opposed to growing new long distance connections.</p>
<p>It is possible in the brain to grow new neurons</p>
<p>and assign new synaptic connections</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the primary mechanism</p>
<p>by which the brain is learning.</p>
<p>So for example, like right now,</p>
<p>sitting here talking to you,</p>
<p>you say lots of interesting things</p>
<p>and I learn from you</p>
<p>and I can remember things that you just said</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t grow new axonal connections</p>
<p>down to new synapses to enable those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plasticity mechanisms</p>
<p>in the synaptic connections between neurons</p>
<p>that enable me to learn on that timescale.</p>
<p>So at the very least,</p>
<p>you can sufficiently approximate that</p>
<p>with just weight updates.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to form new connections.</p>
<p>I would say weight updates are a big part of it.</p>
<p>I also think there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>because broadly speaking,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re doing machine learning,</p>
<p>our networks, say we&rsquo;re talking about feed forward,</p>
<p>deep neural networks,</p>
<p>the temporal domain is not really part of it.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re gonna put in an image</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna get out a classification</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna do that as fast as possible.</p>
<p>So you care about time</p>
<p>but time is not part of the essence of this thing really.</p>
<p>Whereas in spiking neural networks,</p>
<p>what we see in the brain,</p>
<p>time is as crucial as space</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re intimately intertwined</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve tried to say.</p>
<p>And so adaptation on different timescales</p>
<p>is important not just in memory formation,</p>
<p>although it plays a key role there,</p>
<p>but also in just keeping the activity</p>
<p>in a useful dynamic range.</p>
<p>So you have other plasticity mechanisms,</p>
<p>not just weight update,</p>
<p>or at least not on the timescale</p>
<p>of many action potentials,</p>
<p>but even on the shorter timescale.</p>
<p>So a synapse can become much less efficacious.</p>
<p>It can transmit a weaker signal</p>
<p>after the second, third, fourth,</p>
<p>that can second, third, fourth action potential</p>
<p>to occur in a sequence.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called short term synaptic plasticity,</p>
<p>which is a form of learning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re learning that I&rsquo;m getting too much stimulus</p>
<p>from looking at something bright right now.</p>
<p>So I need to tone that down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also another really important mechanism</p>
<p>in learning that&rsquo;s called metoplasticity.</p>
<p>What that seems to be is a way</p>
<p>that you change not the weights themselves,</p>
<p>but the rate at which the weights change.</p>
<p>So when I am in say a lecture hall and my,</p>
<p>this is a potentially terrible cartoon example,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m in a lecture hall</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s time to learn, right?</p>
<p>So my brain will release more,</p>
<p>perhaps dopamine or some neuromodulator</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna change the rate</p>
<p>at which synaptic plasticity occurs.</p>
<p>So that can make me more sensitive</p>
<p>to learning at certain times,</p>
<p>more sensitive to overriding previous information</p>
<p>and less sensitive at other times.</p>
<p>And finally, as long as I&rsquo;m rattling off the list,</p>
<p>I think another concept that falls in the category</p>
<p>of learning or memory adaptation is homeostasis</p>
<p>or homeostatic adaptation,</p>
<p>where neurons have the ability</p>
<p>to control their firing rate.</p>
<p>So if one neuron is just like blasting way too much,</p>
<p>it will naturally tone itself down.</p>
<p>Its threshold will adjust</p>
<p>so that it stays in a useful dynamical range.</p>
<p>And we see that that&rsquo;s captured in deep neural networks</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t just change the synaptic weights,</p>
<p>but you can also move the thresholds of simple neurons</p>
<p>in those models.</p>
<p>And so to achieve the spiking neural networks,</p>
<p>you want to use,</p>
<p>you want to implement the first principles</p>
<p>that you mentioned of the temporal</p>
<p>and the spatial fractal dynamics here.</p>
<p>So you can communicate locally,</p>
<p>you can communicate across much greater distances</p>
<p>and do the same thing in space</p>
<p>and do the same thing in time.</p>
<p>Now, you have like a chapter called</p>
<p>Superconducting Hardware for Neuromorphic Computing.</p>
<p>So what are some ideas that integrate</p>
<p>some of the things we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>in terms of the first principles of neuromorphic computing</p>
<p>and the ideas that you outline</p>
<p>in optoelectronic intelligence?</p>
<p>Yeah, so let me start, I guess,</p>
<p>on the communication side of things,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what led us down this track</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>By us, I&rsquo;m talking about my team of colleagues at NIST,</p>
<p>Saeed Han, Bryce Brimavera, Sonia Buckley,</p>
<p>Jeff Chiles, Adam McCallum to name,</p>
<p>Alex Tate to name a few,</p>
<p>our group leaders, Saewoo Nam and Rich Mirren.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all contributed to this.</p>
<p>So this is not me saying necessarily</p>
<p>just the things that I&rsquo;ve proposed,</p>
<p>but sort of where our team&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>has evolved over the years.</p>
<p>Can I quickly ask, what is NIST</p>
<p>and where is this amazing group of people located?</p>
<p>NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p>The larger facility is out in Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p>Our team is located in Boulder, Colorado.</p>
<p>NIST is a federal agency under the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p>We do a lot with, by we, I mean other people at NIST,</p>
<p>do a lot with standards,</p>
<p>making sure that we understand the system of units,</p>
<p>international system of units, precision measurements.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on in electrical engineering,</p>
<p>material science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s historic.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one of those, it&rsquo;s like MIT</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It has a reputation over many decades</p>
<p>of just being this really a place</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of brilliant people have done</p>
<p>a lot of amazing things.</p>
<p>But in terms of the people in your team,</p>
<p>in this team of people involved</p>
<p>in the concept we&rsquo;re talking about now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious,</p>
<p>what kind of disciplines are we talking about?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Mostly physicists and electrical engineers,</p>
<p>some material scientists,</p>
<p>but I would say,</p>
<p>yeah, I think physicists and electrical engineers,</p>
<p>my background is in photonics,</p>
<p>the use of light for technology.</p>
<p>So coming from there, I tend to have found colleagues</p>
<p>that are more from that background.</p>
<p>Although Adam McConn,</p>
<p>more of a superconducting electronics background,</p>
<p>we need a diversity of folks.</p>
<p>This project is sort of cross disciplinary.</p>
<p>I would love to be working more</p>
<p>with neuroscientists and things,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t reached that scale yet.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re focused on the hardware side,</p>
<p>which requires all the disciplines that you mentioned.</p>
<p>And then of course,</p>
<p>neuroscientists may be a source of inspiration</p>
<p>for some of the longterm vision.</p>
<p>I would actually call it more than inspiration.</p>
<p>I would call it sort of a roadmap.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to build exactly the brain,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough to just say,</p>
<p>oh, neurons kind of work like that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s kind of do that thing.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re very much following the concepts</p>
<p>that the cognitive sciences have laid out for us,</p>
<p>which I believe is a really robust roadmap.</p>
<p>I mean, just on a little bit of a tangent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often stated that we just don&rsquo;t understand the brain.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really hard to replicate it</p>
<p>because we just don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>And maybe five or seven years ago,</p>
<p>I would have said that,</p>
<p>but as I got more interested in the subject,</p>
<p>I read more of the neuroscience literature</p>
<p>and I was just taken by the exact opposite sense.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how much they know about this.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how mathematically rigorous</p>
<p>and sort of theoretically complete</p>
<p>a lot of the concepts are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say we understand consciousness</p>
<p>or we understand the self or anything like that,</p>
<p>but what is the brain doing</p>
<p>and why is it doing those things?</p>
<p>Neuroscientists have a lot of answers to those questions.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a hardware designer</p>
<p>that just wants to get going,</p>
<p>whoa, it&rsquo;s pretty clear which direction to go in, I think.</p>
<p>Okay, so I love the optimism behind that,</p>
<p>but in the implementation of these systems</p>
<p>that uses superconductivity, how do you make it happen?</p>
<p>So to me, it starts with thinking</p>
<p>about the communication network.</p>
<p>You know for sure that the ability of each neuron</p>
<p>to communicate to many thousands of colleagues</p>
<p>across the network is indispensable.</p>
<p>I take that as a core principle of my architecture,</p>
<p>my thinking on the subject.</p>
<p>So coming from a background in photonics,</p>
<p>it was very natural to say,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna use light for communication.</p>
<p>Just in case listeners may not know,</p>
<p>light is often used in communication.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think about radio, that&rsquo;s light,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s long wavelengths, but it&rsquo;s electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same physical phenomenon</p>
<p>obeying exactly the same Maxwell&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>And then all the way down to fiber, fiber optics.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re using visible</p>
<p>or near infrared wavelengths of light,</p>
<p>but the way you send messages across the ocean</p>
<p>is now contemporary over optical fibers.</p>
<p>So using light for communication is not a stretch.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>So you might ask, well, why don&rsquo;t you use light</p>
<p>for communication in a conventional microchip?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is, I believe, physical.</p>
<p>If we had a light source on a silicon chip</p>
<p>that was as simple as a transistor,</p>
<p>there would not be a processor in the world</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t use light for communication,</p>
<p>at least above some distance.</p>
<p>How many light sources are needed?</p>
<p>Oh, you need a light source at every single point.</p>
<p>A light source per neuron.</p>
<p>Per neuron, per little,</p>
<p>but then if you could have a really small</p>
<p>and nice light source,</p>
<p>your definition of neuron could be flexible.</p>
<p>Could be, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s helpful to me to say,</p>
<p>in this hardware, a neuron is that entity</p>
<p>which has a light source.</p>
<p>That, and I can explain.</p>
<p>And then there was light.</p>
<p>I mean, I can explain more about that, but.</p>
<p>Somehow this like rhymes with consciousness</p>
<p>because people will often say the light of consciousness.</p>
<p>So that consciousness is that which is conscious.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my quote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me, that&rsquo;s my quote.</p>
<p>You see, that quote comes from my background.</p>
<p>Yours is in optics, mine in light, mine&rsquo;s in darkness.</p>
<p>So go ahead.</p>
<p>So the point I was making there is that</p>
<p>if it was easy to manufacture light sources</p>
<p>along with transistors on a silicon chip,</p>
<p>they would be everywhere.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>People have been trying for decades</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually extremely difficult.</p>
<p>I think an important part of our research</p>
<p>is dwelling right at that spot there.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Is it physics or engineering?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s physics.</p>
<p>So, okay, so it&rsquo;s physics, I think.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is, as we discussed,</p>
<p>silicon is the material of choice for transistors</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very difficult to imagine</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s gonna change anytime soon.</p>
<p>Silicon is notoriously bad at emitting light.</p>
<p>And that has to do with the immutable properties</p>
<p>of silicon itself.</p>
<p>The way that the energy bands are structured in silicon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never going to make silicon efficient</p>
<p>as a light source at room temperature</p>
<p>without doing very exotic things</p>
<p>that degrade its ability to interface nicely</p>
<p>with those transistors in the first place.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like one of these things where it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>why is nature dealing us that blow?</p>
<p>You give us these beautiful transistors</p>
<p>and you give us all the motivation</p>
<p>to use light for communication,</p>
<p>but then you don&rsquo;t give us a light source.</p>
<p>So, well, okay, you do give us a light source.</p>
<p>Compound semiconductors,</p>
<p>like we talked about back at the beginning,</p>
<p>an element from group three and an element from group five</p>
<p>form an alloy where every other lattice site</p>
<p>switches which element it is.</p>
<p>Those have much better properties for generating light.</p>
<p>You put electrons in, light comes out.</p>
<p>Almost 100% of the electron hold,</p>
<p>it can be made efficient.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take your word for it, okay.</p>
<p>However, I say it&rsquo;s physics, not engineering,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to get those compound semiconductor light sources</p>
<p>situated with your silicon.</p>
<p>In order to do that ion implantation</p>
<p>that I talked about at the beginning,</p>
<p>high temperatures are required.</p>
<p>So you gotta make all of your transistors first</p>
<p>and then put the compound semiconductors on top of there.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t grow them afterwards</p>
<p>because that requires high temperature.</p>
<p>It screws up all your transistors.</p>
<p>You try and stick them on there.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the same lattice constant.</p>
<p>The spacing between atoms is different enough</p>
<p>that it just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So nature does not seem to be telling us that,</p>
<p>hey, go ahead and combine light sources</p>
<p>with your digital switches</p>
<p>for conventional digital computing.</p>
<p>And conventional digital computing</p>
<p>will often require smaller scale, I guess,</p>
<p>in terms of like smartphone.</p>
<p>So in which kind of systems does nature hint</p>
<p>that we can use light and photons for communication?</p>
<p>Well, so let me just try and be clear.</p>
<p>You can use light for communication in digital systems,</p>
<p>just the light sources are not intimately integrated</p>
<p>with the silicon.</p>
<p>You manufacture all the silicon,</p>
<p>you have your microchip, plunk it down.</p>
<p>And then you manufacture your light sources,</p>
<p>separate chip, completely different process</p>
<p>made in a different foundry.</p>
<p>And then you put those together at the package level.</p>
<p>So now you have some,</p>
<p>I would say a great deal of architectural limitations</p>
<p>that are introduced by that sort of</p>
<p>package level integration</p>
<p>as opposed to monolithic on the same chip integration,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a very useful thing to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I had done some work previously</p>
<p>before I came to NIST.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a project led by Vladimir Stoyanovich</p>
<p>that now spun out into a company called IR Labs</p>
<p>led by Mark Wade and Chen Sun</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re doing exactly that.</p>
<p>So you have your light source chip,</p>
<p>your silicon chip, whatever it may be doing,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s digital electronics,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s some other control purpose, something.</p>
<p>And the silicon chip drives the light source chip</p>
<p>and modulates the intensity of the lights.</p>
<p>You can get data out of the package on an optical fiber.</p>
<p>And that still gives you tremendous advantages in bandwidth</p>
<p>as opposed to sending those signals out</p>
<p>over electrical lines.</p>
<p>But it is somewhat peculiar to my eye</p>
<p>that they have to be integrated at this package level.</p>
<p>And those people, I mean, they&rsquo;re so smart.</p>
<p>Those are my colleagues that I respect a great deal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very clear that it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making a bad choice.</p>
<p>This is what physics is telling us.</p>
<p>It just wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>to try to stick them together.</p>
<p>Yeah, so even if it&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier than the alternative, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I think so, yes.</p>
<p>And again, I need to go back</p>
<p>and make sure that I&rsquo;m not taking the wrong way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the pursuit</p>
<p>of integrating compound semiconductors with silicon</p>
<p>is fruitless and shouldn&rsquo;t be pursued.</p>
<p>It should, and people are doing great work.</p>
<p>Kai Mei Lau and John Bowers, others,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing it and they&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>But to my eye, it doesn&rsquo;t look like that&rsquo;s ever going to be</p>
<p>just the standard monolithic light source</p>
<p>on silicon process.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so nature kind of points the way usually.</p>
<p>And if you resist nature,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to do a lot more work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna be expensive and not scalable.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But okay, so let&rsquo;s go far into the future.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine this gigantic neuromorphic computing system</p>
<p>that simulates all of our realities.</p>
<p>It currently is Mantra Matrix 4.</p>
<p>So this thing, this powerful computer,</p>
<p>how does it operate?</p>
<p>So what are the neurons?</p>
<p>What is the communication?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>All right, so let me now,</p>
<p>after spending 45 minutes trashing</p>
<p>light source integration with silicon,</p>
<p>let me now say why I&rsquo;m basing my entire life,</p>
<p>professional life, on integrating light sources</p>
<p>with electronics.</p>
<p>I think the game is completely different</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about superconducting electronics.</p>
<p>For several reasons, let me try to go through them.</p>
<p>One is that, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to integrate</p>
<p>those compound semiconductor light sources with silicon.</p>
<p>With silicon is a requirement that is introduced</p>
<p>by the fact that you&rsquo;re using semiconducting electronics.</p>
<p>In superconducting electronics,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still gonna start with a silicon wafer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the bread for your sandwich in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not using that silicon</p>
<p>in precisely the same way for the electronics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now depositing superconducting materials</p>
<p>on top of that.</p>
<p>The prospects for integrating light sources</p>
<p>with that kind of an electronic process</p>
<p>are certainly less explored,</p>
<p>but I think much more promising</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t need those light sources</p>
<p>to be intimately integrated with the transistors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the problems come up.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to be lattice matched to the silicon,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Instead, it seems possible</p>
<p>that you can take those compound semiconductor light sources,</p>
<p>stick them on the silicon wafer,</p>
<p>and then grow your superconducting electronics</p>
<p>on the top of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at least not obviously going to fail.</p>
<p>So the computation would be done</p>
<p>on the superconductive material as well?</p>
<p>Yes, the computation is done</p>
<p>in the superconducting electronics,</p>
<p>and the light sources receive signals</p>
<p>that say, hey, a neuron reached threshold,</p>
<p>produce a pulse of light,</p>
<p>send it out to all your downstream synaptic connections.</p>
<p>Those are, again, superconducting electronics.</p>
<p>Perform your computation,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re off to the races.</p>
<p>Your network works.</p>
<p>So then if we can rewind real quick,</p>
<p>so what are the limitations of the challenges</p>
<p>of superconducting electronics</p>
<p>when we think about constructing these kinds of systems?</p>
<p>So actually, let me say one other thing</p>
<p>about the light sources,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll move on, I promise,</p>
<p>because this is probably tedious for some.</p>
<p>This is super exciting.</p>
<p>Okay, one other thing about the light sources.</p>
<p>I said that silicon is terrible at emitting photons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not what it&rsquo;s meant to do.</p>
<p>However, the game is different</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re at low temperature.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working with superconductors,</p>
<p>you have to be at low temperature</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t work otherwise.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re at four Kelvin,</p>
<p>silicon is not obviously a terrible light source.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not as efficient as compound semiconductors,</p>
<p>but it might be good enough for this application.</p>
<p>The final thing that I&rsquo;ll mention about that is, again,</p>
<p>leveraging superconductors, as I said,</p>
<p>in a different context,</p>
<p>superconducting detectors can receive one single photon.</p>
<p>In that conversation, I failed to mention</p>
<p>that semiconductors can also receive photons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the primary mechanism by which it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>A camera in your phone that&rsquo;s receptive to visible light</p>
<p>is receiving photons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on silicon,</p>
<p>or you can make it in different semiconductors</p>
<p>for different wavelengths,</p>
<p>but it requires on the order of a thousand,</p>
<p>a few thousand photons to receive a pulse.</p>
<p>Now, when you&rsquo;re using a superconducting detector,</p>
<p>you need one photon, exactly one.</p>
<p>I mean, one or more.</p>
<p>So the fact that your synapses can now be based</p>
<p>on superconducting detectors</p>
<p>instead of semiconducting detectors</p>
<p>brings the light levels that are required</p>
<p>down by some three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>So now you don&rsquo;t need good light sources.</p>
<p>You can have the world&rsquo;s worst light sources.</p>
<p>As long as they spit out maybe a few thousand photons</p>
<p>every time a neuron fires,</p>
<p>you have the hardware principles in place</p>
<p>that you might be able to perform</p>
<p>this optoelectronic integration.</p>
<p>To me optoelectronic integration is, it&rsquo;s just so enticing.</p>
<p>We want to be able to leverage electronics for computation,</p>
<p>light for communication,</p>
<p>working with silicon microelectronics at room temperature</p>
<p>that has been exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p>And I hope that when we move to the superconducting domain,</p>
<p>target a different application space</p>
<p>that is neuromorphic instead of digital</p>
<p>and use superconducting detectors,</p>
<p>maybe optoelectronic integration comes to us.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>So one is temperature.</p>
<p>So in these kinds of hybrid heterogeneous systems,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the temperature?</p>
<p>What are some of the constraints to the operation here?</p>
<p>Does it all have to be a four Kelvin as well?</p>
<p>Four Kelvin.</p>
<p>Everything has to be at four Kelvin.</p>
<p>Okay, so what are the other engineering challenges</p>
<p>of making this kind of optoelectronic systems?</p>
<p>Let me just dwell on that four Kelvin for a second</p>
<p>because some people hear four Kelvin</p>
<p>and they just get up and leave.</p>
<p>They just say, I&rsquo;m not doing it, you know?</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s very earth centric, species centric.</p>
<p>We live in 300 Kelvin.</p>
<p>So we want our technologies to operate there too.</p>
<p>I totally get it.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s zero Celsius?</p>
<p>Zero Celsius is 273 Kelvin.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking very, very cold here.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>Not even Boston cold.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This is real cold.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Siberia cold, no.</p>
<p>Okay, so just for reference,</p>
<p>the temperature of the cosmic microwave background</p>
<p>is about 2.7 Kelvin.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re still warmer than deep space.</p>
<p>Yeah, good.</p>
<p>So that when the universe dies out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be colder than four K.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already colder than four K.</p>
<p>In the expanses, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to get that far away from the earth</p>
<p>in order to drop down to not far from four Kelvin.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is the aliens that live at the edge</p>
<p>of the observable universe</p>
<p>are using superconductive material for their computation.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to live at the edge of the universe.</p>
<p>The aliens that are more advanced than us</p>
<p>in their solar system are doing this</p>
<p>in their asteroid belt.</p>
<p>We can get to that.</p>
<p>Oh, because they can get that</p>
<p>to that temperature easier there?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>All you have to do is reflect the sunlight away</p>
<p>and you have a huge headstart.</p>
<p>Oh, so the sun is the problem here.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s warm here on earth.</p>
<p>Got it. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so can you&hellip;</p>
<p>So how do we get to four K?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, okay, so what I want to say about temperature&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What I want to say about temperature is that</p>
<p>if you can swallow that,</p>
<p>if you can say, all right, I give up applications</p>
<p>that have to do with my cell phone</p>
<p>and the convenience of a laptop on a train</p>
<p>and you instead&hellip;</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;m very much in the scientific head space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking at products.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking at what this will be useful</p>
<p>to sell to consumers.</p>
<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m thinking about scientific questions.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just not that bad to have to work at four Kelvin.</p>
<p>We do it all the time in our labs at NIST.</p>
<p>And so does&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, for reference,</p>
<p>the entire quantum computing sector</p>
<p>usually has to work at something like 100 millikelvin,</p>
<p>50 millikelvin.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re talking of another factor of 100</p>
<p>even colder than that, a fraction of a degree.</p>
<p>And everybody seems to think quantum computing</p>
<p>is going to take over the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much more expensive</p>
<p>to have to get that extra factor of 10 or whatever colder.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s not stopping people from investing in that area.</p>
<p>And by investing, I mean putting their research into it</p>
<p>as well as venture capital or whatever.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, so based on the energy of what you&rsquo;re commenting on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a sense that&rsquo;s one of the criticism</p>
<p>of this approach is 4K, 4 Kelvin is a big negative.</p>
<p>It is the showstopper for a lot of people.</p>
<p>They just, I mean, and understandably,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that that&rsquo;s not a consideration.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>For some&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, so different motivations for different people.</p>
<p>In the academic world,</p>
<p>suppose you spent your whole life</p>
<p>learning about silicon microelectronic circuits.</p>
<p>You send a design to a foundry,</p>
<p>they send you back a chip</p>
<p>and you go test it at your tabletop.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>here now learn how to use all these cryogenics</p>
<p>so you can do that at 4 Kelvin.</p>
<p>No, come on, man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>That sounds bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the old momentum, the Titanic of the turning.</p>
<p>Yeah, kind of.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s not too much of a&hellip;</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re looking at large systems</p>
<p>and the gain you can potentially get from them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not that much of a cost.</p>
<p>And when you wanna answer the scientific question</p>
<p>about what are the physical limits of cognition?</p>
<p>Well, the physical limits,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re at 4 Kelvin.</p>
<p>If you can perform cognition at a scale</p>
<p>orders of magnitude beyond any room temperature technology,</p>
<p>but you gotta get cold to do it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do it.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s the interesting application space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even an application space,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the interesting scientific paradigm.</p>
<p>So I personally am not going to let low temperature</p>
<p>stop me from realizing a technological domain or realm</p>
<p>that is achieving in most ways everything else</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m looking for in my hardware.</p>
<p>So that, okay, that&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>Is there other kind of engineering challenges</p>
<p>that you envision?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So let me take a moment here</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t really described what I mean</p>
<p>by a neuron or a network in this particular hardware.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you wanna talk about loop neurons</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many fascinating&hellip;</p>
<p>But you just have so many amazing papers</p>
<p>that people should definitely check out</p>
<p>and the titles alone are just killer.</p>
<p>So anyway, go ahead.</p>
<p>Right, so let me say big picture,</p>
<p>based on optics, photonics for communication,</p>
<p>superconducting electronics for computation,</p>
<p>how does this all work?</p>
<p>So a neuron in this hardware platform</p>
<p>can be thought of as circuits</p>
<p>that are based on Josephson junctions,</p>
<p>like we talked about before,</p>
<p>where every time a photon comes in&hellip;</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start by talking about a synapse.</p>
<p>A synapse receives a photon, one or more,</p>
<p>from a different neuron</p>
<p>and it converts that optical signal</p>
<p>to an electrical signal.</p>
<p>The amount of current that that adds to a loop</p>
<p>is controlled by the synaptic weight.</p>
<p>So as I said before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re popping fluxons into a loop, right?</p>
<p>So a photon comes in,</p>
<p>it hits a superconducting single photon detector,</p>
<p>one photon, the absolute physical minimum</p>
<p>that you can communicate</p>
<p>from one place to another with light.</p>
<p>And that detector then converts that</p>
<p>into an electrical signal</p>
<p>and the amount of signal</p>
<p>is correlated with some kind of weight.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the synaptic weight will tell you</p>
<p>how many fluxons you pop into the loop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an analog number.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing analog computation now.</p>
<p>Well, can you just linger on that?</p>
<p>What the heck is a fluxon?</p>
<p>Are we supposed to know this?</p>
<p>Or is this a funny,</p>
<p>is this like the big bang?</p>
<p>Is this a funny word for something deeply technical?</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s try to avoid using the word fluxon</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not actually necessary.</p>
<p>When a photon&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to say though.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very necessary, I would say.</p>
<p>When a photon hits</p>
<p>that superconducting single photon detector,</p>
<p>current is added to a superconducting loop.</p>
<p>And the amount of current that you add</p>
<p>is an analog value,</p>
<p>can have eight bit equivalent resolution,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>10 bits, maybe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing, by the way.</p>
<p>This is starting to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re using superconductors for this,</p>
<p>the energy of that circulating current</p>
<p>is less than the energy of that photon.</p>
<p>So your energy budget is not destroyed</p>
<p>by doing this analog computation.</p>
<p>So now in the language of a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>you would say that&rsquo;s your postsynaptic signal.</p>
<p>You have this current being stored in a loop.</p>
<p>You can decide what you wanna do with it.</p>
<p>Most likely you&rsquo;re gonna have it decay exponentially.</p>
<p>So every single synapse</p>
<p>is gonna have some given time constant.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s determined by putting some resistor</p>
<p>in that superconducting loop.</p>
<p>So a synapse event occurs when a photon strikes a detector,</p>
<p>adds current to that loop, it decays over time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the postsynaptic signal.</p>
<p>Then you can process that in a dendritic tree.</p>
<p>Bryce Primavera and I have a paper</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve submitted about that.</p>
<p>For the more neuroscience oriented people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of dendritic processing,</p>
<p>a lot of plasticity mechanisms you can implement</p>
<p>with essentially exactly the same circuits.</p>
<p>You have this one simple building block circuit</p>
<p>that you can use for a synapse, for a dendrite,</p>
<p>for the neuron cell body, for all the plasticity functions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all based on the same building block,</p>
<p>just tweaking a couple parameters.</p>
<p>So this basic building block</p>
<p>has both an optical and an electrical component,</p>
<p>and then you just build arbitrary large systems with that?</p>
<p>Close, you&rsquo;re not at fault</p>
<p>for thinking that that&rsquo;s what I meant.</p>
<p>What I should say is that if you want it to be a synapse,</p>
<p>you tack a superconducting detector onto the front of it.</p>
<p>And if you want it to be anything else,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no optical component.</p>
<p>Got it, so at the front,</p>
<p>optics in the front, electrical stuff in the back.</p>
<p>Electrical, yeah, in the processing</p>
<p>and in the output signal that it sends</p>
<p>to the next stage of processing further.</p>
<p>So the dendritic trees is electrical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all electrical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all electrical in the superconducting domain.</p>
<p>For anybody who&rsquo;s up on their superconducting circuits,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just based on a DC squid, the most ubiquitous,</p>
<p>which is a circuit composed of two Joseph&rsquo;s injunctions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very bread and butter kind of thing.</p>
<p>And then the only place where you go beyond that</p>
<p>is the neuron cell body itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s receiving all these electrical inputs</p>
<p>from the synapses or dendrites</p>
<p>or however you&rsquo;ve structured that particular unique neuron.</p>
<p>And when it reaches its threshold,</p>
<p>which occurs by driving a Joseph&rsquo;s injunction</p>
<p>above its critical current,</p>
<p>it produces a pulse of current,</p>
<p>which starts an amplification sequence,</p>
<p>voltage amplification,</p>
<p>that produces light out of a transmitter.</p>
<p>So one of our colleagues, Adam McCann,</p>
<p>and Sonia Buckley as well,</p>
<p>did a lot of work on the light sources</p>
<p>and the amplifiers that drive the current</p>
<p>and produce sufficient voltage to drive current</p>
<p>through that now semiconducting part.</p>
<p>So that light source is the semiconducting part of a neuron.</p>
<p>And that, so the neuron has reached threshold.</p>
<p>It produces a pulse of light.</p>
<p>That light then fans out across a network of wave guides</p>
<p>to reach all the downstream synaptic terminals</p>
<p>that perform this process themselves.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably worth explaining</p>
<p>what a network of wave guides is,</p>
<p>because a lot of listeners aren&rsquo;t gonna know that.</p>
<p>Look up the papers by Jeff Chiles on this one.</p>
<p>But basically, light can be guided in a simple,</p>
<p>basically wire of usually an insulating material.</p>
<p>So silicon, silicon nitride,</p>
<p>different kinds of glass,</p>
<p>just like in a fiber optic, it&rsquo;s glass, silicon dioxide.</p>
<p>That makes it a little bit big.</p>
<p>We wanna bring these down.</p>
<p>So we use different materials like silicon nitride,</p>
<p>but basically just imagine a rectangle of some material</p>
<p>that just goes and branches,</p>
<p>forms different branch points</p>
<p>that target different subregions of the network.</p>
<p>You can transition between layers of these.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re talking about building in the third dimension,</p>
<p>which is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what wave guides are.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Why the third dimension is crucial?</p>
<p>Okay, so yes, you were talking about</p>
<p>what are some of the technical limitations.</p>
<p>One of the things that I believe we have to grapple with</p>
<p>is that our brains are miraculously compact.</p>
<p>For the number of neurons that are in our brain,</p>
<p>it sure does fit in a small volume,</p>
<p>as it would have to if we&rsquo;re gonna be biological organisms</p>
<p>that are resource limited and things like that.</p>
<p>Any kind of hardware neuron</p>
<p>is almost certainly gonna be much bigger than that</p>
<p>if it is of comparable complexity,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s based on silicon transistors.</p>
<p>Okay, a transistor, seven nanometers,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean a semiconductor based neuron</p>
<p>is seven nanometers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re big.</p>
<p>They require many transistors,</p>
<p>different other things like capacitors and things</p>
<p>that store charge.</p>
<p>They end up being on the order of 100 microns</p>
<p>by 100 microns,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s difficult to get them down any smaller than that.</p>
<p>The same is true for superconducting neurons,</p>
<p>and the same is true</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re trying to use light for communication.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re using electrons for communication,</p>
<p>you have these wires where, okay,</p>
<p>the size of an electron might be angstroms,</p>
<p>but the size of a wire is not angstroms,</p>
<p>and if you try and make it narrower,</p>
<p>the resistance just goes up,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t actually win.</p>
<p>To communicate over long distances,</p>
<p>you need your wires to be microns wide,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same thing for wave guides.</p>
<p>Wave guides are essentially limited</p>
<p>by the wavelength of light,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna be about a micron,</p>
<p>so whereas compare that to an axon,</p>
<p>the analogous component in the brain,</p>
<p>which is 10 nanometers in diameter, something like that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bigger when they need to communicate</p>
<p>over long distances,</p>
<p>but grappling with the size of these structures</p>
<p>is inevitable and crucial,</p>
<p>and so in order to make systems of comparable scale</p>
<p>to the human brain, by scale here,</p>
<p>I mean number of interconnected neurons,</p>
<p>you absolutely have to be using</p>
<p>the third spatial dimension,</p>
<p>and that means on the wafer,</p>
<p>you need multiple layers</p>
<p>of both active and passive components.</p>
<p>Active, I mean superconducting electronic circuits</p>
<p>that are performing computations,</p>
<p>and passive, I mean these wave guides</p>
<p>that are routing the optical signals to different places,</p>
<p>you have to be able to stack those.</p>
<p>If you can get to something like 10 planes</p>
<p>of each of those, or maybe not even 10,</p>
<p>maybe five, six, something like that,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re in business.</p>
<p>Now you can get millions of neurons on a wafer,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not anywhere close to the brain scale.</p>
<p>In order to get to the scale of the human brain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to also use the third dimension</p>
<p>in the sense that entire wafers</p>
<p>need to be stacked on top of each other</p>
<p>with fiber optic communication between them,</p>
<p>and we need to be able to fill a space</p>
<p>the size of this table with stacked wafers,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you can get to some 10 billion neurons</p>
<p>like your human brain,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s specific</p>
<p>to the optoelectronic approach that we&rsquo;re taking.</p>
<p>I think that applies to any hardware</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to reach commensurate scale</p>
<p>and complexity as the human brain.</p>
<p>So you need that fractal stacking,</p>
<p>so stacking on the wafer,</p>
<p>and stacking of the wafers,</p>
<p>and then whatever the system that combines,</p>
<p>this stacking of the tables with the wafers.</p>
<p>And it has to be fractal all the way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exactly right,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>that you can efficiently get information</p>
<p>from a small point to across that whole network.</p>
<p>It has to have the power law connected.</p>
<p>And photons are like optics throughout.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re at this scale, to me it&rsquo;s just obvious.</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;re using light for communication.</p>
<p>You have fiber optics given to us from nature, so simple.</p>
<p>The thought of even trying to do</p>
<p>any kind of electrical communication</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s wrong, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m coming from.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s return to loop neurons.</p>
<p>Why are they called loop neurons?</p>
<p>Yeah, the term loop neurons comes from the fact,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>that they rely heavily on these superconducting loops.</p>
<p>So even in a lot of forms of digital computing</p>
<p>with superconductors,</p>
<p>storing a signal in a superconducting loop</p>
<p>is a primary technique.</p>
<p>In this particular case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just loops everywhere you look.</p>
<p>So the strength of a synaptic weight</p>
<p>is gonna be set by the amount of current circulating</p>
<p>in a loop that is coupled to the synapse.</p>
<p>So memory is implemented as current circulating</p>
<p>in a superconducting loop.</p>
<p>The coupling between, say, a synapse and a dendrite</p>
<p>or a synapse in the neuron cell body</p>
<p>occurs through loop coupling through transformers.</p>
<p>So current circulating in a synapse</p>
<p>is gonna induce current in a different loop,</p>
<p>a receiving loop in the neuron cell body.</p>
<p>So since all of the computation is happening</p>
<p>in these flux storage loops</p>
<p>and they play such a central role</p>
<p>in how the information is processed,</p>
<p>how memories are formed, all that stuff,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think too much about it,</p>
<p>I just called them loop neurons</p>
<p>because it rolls off the tongue a little bit better</p>
<p>than superconducting optoelectronic neurons.</p>
<p>Okay, so how do you design circuits for these loop neurons?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different scales of design.</p>
<p>So at the level of just one synapse,</p>
<p>you can use conventional methods.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not that complicated</p>
<p>as far as superconducting electronics goes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just four Joseph&rsquo;s injunctions or something like that</p>
<p>depending on how much complexity you wanna add.</p>
<p>So you can just directly simulate each component in SPICE.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s SPICE?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Standard Electrical Simulation Software, basically.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just explicitly solving the differential equations</p>
<p>that describe the circuit elements.</p>
<p>And then you can stack these things together</p>
<p>in that simulation software to then build circuits.</p>
<p>You can, but that becomes computationally expensive.</p>
<p>So one of the things when COVID hit,</p>
<p>we knew we had to turn some attention</p>
<p>to more things you can do at home in your basement</p>
<p>or whatever, and one of them was computational modeling.</p>
<p>So we started working on adapting,</p>
<p>abstracting out the circuit performance</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t have to explicitly solve</p>
<p>the circuit equations, which for Joseph&rsquo;s injunctions</p>
<p>usually needs to be done on like a picosecond timescale</p>
<p>and you have a lot of nodes in your circuit.</p>
<p>So it results in a lot of differential equations</p>
<p>that need to be solved simultaneously.</p>
<p>We were looking for a way to simulate these circuits</p>
<p>that is scalable up to networks of millions or so neurons</p>
<p>is sort of where we&rsquo;re targeting right now.</p>
<p>So we were able to analyze the behavior of these circuits.</p>
<p>And as I said, it&rsquo;s based on these simple building blocks.</p>
<p>So you really only need to understand</p>
<p>this one building block.</p>
<p>And if you get a good model of that, boom, it tiles.</p>
<p>And you can change the parameters in there</p>
<p>to get different behaviors and stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all based on now it&rsquo;s one differential equation</p>
<p>that you need to solve.</p>
<p>So one differential equation for every synapse,</p>
<p>dendrite or neuron in your system.</p>
<p>And for the neuroscientists out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a simple leaky integrate and fire model,</p>
<p>leaky integrator, basically.</p>
<p>A synapse is a leaky integrator,</p>
<p>a dendrite is a leaky integrator.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really fascinated by how this one simple component</p>
<p>can be used to achieve lots of different types</p>
<p>of dynamical activity.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s where scalability comes from.</p>
<p>And also complexity as well.</p>
<p>Complexity is often characterized</p>
<p>by relatively simple building blocks</p>
<p>connected in potentially simple</p>
<p>or sometimes complicated ways,</p>
<p>and then emergent new behavior that was hard to predict</p>
<p>from those simple elements.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re working with here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very exciting platform,</p>
<p>both from a modeling perspective</p>
<p>and from a hardware manifestation perspective</p>
<p>where we can hopefully start to have this test bed</p>
<p>where we can explore things,</p>
<p>not just related to neuroscience,</p>
<p>but also related to other things</p>
<p>that connected to other physics like critical phenomenon,</p>
<p>Ising models, things like that.</p>
<p>So you were asking how we simulate these circuits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at different levels</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got the simple spice circuit stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re building these network models</p>
<p>based on this more efficient leaky integrator.</p>
<p>So we can actually reduce every element</p>
<p>to one differential equation.</p>
<p>And then we can also step through it</p>
<p>on a much coarser time grid.</p>
<p>So it ends up being something like a factor</p>
<p>of a thousand to 10,000 speed improvement,</p>
<p>which allows us to simulate,</p>
<p>but hopefully up to millions of neurons.</p>
<p>Whereas before we would have been limited to tens,</p>
<p>a hundred, something like that.</p>
<p>And just like simulating quantum mechanical systems</p>
<p>with a quantum computer.</p>
<p>So the goal here is to understand such systems.</p>
<p>For me, the goal is to study this</p>
<p>as a scientific physical system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not drawn towards turning this</p>
<p>into an enterprise at this point.</p>
<p>I feel short term applications</p>
<p>that obviously make a lot of money</p>
<p>is not necessarily a curiosity driver for you at the moment.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in short term making money,</p>
<p>go with deep learning, use silicon microelectronics.</p>
<p>If you wanna understand things like the physics</p>
<p>of a fascinating system,</p>
<p>or if you wanna understand something more</p>
<p>along the lines of the physical limits</p>
<p>of what can be achieved,</p>
<p>then I think single photon communication,</p>
<p>superconducting electronics is extremely exciting.</p>
<p>What if I wanna use superconducting hardware</p>
<p>at four Kelvin to mine Bitcoin?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my main interest.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to talk to you today,</p>
<p>I wanna say, no, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Look it up on the internet.</p>
<p>Somebody told me about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what it is.</p>
<p>But let me ask nevertheless</p>
<p>about applications to machine learning.</p>
<p>Okay, so if you look at the scale of five, 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>is it possible to, before we understand the nature</p>
<p>of human intelligence and general intelligence,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll start falling out of this exploration</p>
<p>of neuromorphic systems ability to solve some</p>
<p>of the problems that the machine learning systems</p>
<p>of today can&rsquo;t solve?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m really hesitant to over promise.</p>
<p>So I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t really understand machine learning</p>
<p>in a lot of senses.</p>
<p>I mean, machine learning from my perspective appears</p>
<p>to require that you know precisely what your input is</p>
<p>and also what your goal is.</p>
<p>You usually have some objective function</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very limiting.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, a lot of times that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a picture and there&rsquo;s a horse in it, so you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not a very interesting problem.</p>
<p>I think when I think about intelligence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost defined by the ability to handle problems</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t know what your inputs are going to be</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even necessarily know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish</p>
<p>in this world.</p>
<p>Yeah, at all scales.</p>
<p>Yeah, at all scales, right.</p>
<p>I mean, so I&rsquo;m more drawn to the underlying phenomena,</p>
<p>the critical dynamics of this system,</p>
<p>trying to understand how elements that you build</p>
<p>into your hardware result in emergent fascinating activity</p>
<p>that was very difficult to predict, things like that.</p>
<p>So, but I gotta be really careful</p>
<p>because I think a lot of other people who,</p>
<p>if they found themselves working on this project</p>
<p>in my shoes, they would say, all right,</p>
<p>what are all the different ways we can use this</p>
<p>for machine learning?</p>
<p>Actually, let me just definitely mention colleague</p>
<p>at NIST, Mike Schneider.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also very much interested,</p>
<p>particularly in the superconducting side of things,</p>
<p>using the incredible speed, power efficiency,</p>
<p>also Ken Seagal at Colgate,</p>
<p>other people working on specifically</p>
<p>the superconducting side of this for machine learning</p>
<p>and deep feed forward neural networks.</p>
<p>There, the advantages are obvious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely fast.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s less on the nature of intelligences</p>
<p>and more on various characteristics of this hardware</p>
<p>that you can use for the basic computation</p>
<p>as we know it today and communication.</p>
<p>One of the things that Mike Schneider&rsquo;s working on right now</p>
<p>is an image classifier at a relatively small scale.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s targeting that nine pixel problem</p>
<p>where you can have three different characters</p>
<p>and you put in a nine pixel image</p>
<p>and you classify it as one of these three categories.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna be really interesting</p>
<p>to see what happens there,</p>
<p>because if you can show that even at that scale,</p>
<p>you just put these images in and you get it out</p>
<p>and he thinks he can do it,</p>
<p>I forgot if it&rsquo;s a nanosecond</p>
<p>or some extremely fast classification time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably less,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a hundred picoseconds or something.</p>
<p>There you have challenges though,</p>
<p>because the Joseph&rsquo;s injunctions themselves,</p>
<p>the electronic circuit is extremely power efficient.</p>
<p>Some orders of magnitude for something more</p>
<p>than a transistor doing the same thing,</p>
<p>but when you have to cool it down to four Kelvin,</p>
<p>you pay a huge overhead just for keeping it cold,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not doing anything.</p>
<p>So it has to work at large scale</p>
<p>in order to overcome that power penalty,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s gonna have to get that performance.</p>
<p>And this is sort of what you were asking about before</p>
<p>is like how much better than silicon would it need to be?</p>
<p>And the answer is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think if it&rsquo;s just overall better than silicon</p>
<p>at a problem that a lot of people care about,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s image classification,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s facial recognition,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s monitoring credit transactions, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>then I think it will have a place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be in your cell phone,</p>
<p>but it could be in your data center.</p>
<p>So what about in terms of the data center,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>to the various systems,</p>
<p>like Tesla recently announced DOJO,</p>
<p>which is a large scale machine learning training system,</p>
<p>that again, the bottleneck there</p>
<p>is probably going to be communication</p>
<p>between those systems.</p>
<p>Is there something from your work</p>
<p>on everything we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>in terms of superconductive hardware</p>
<p>that could be useful there?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, okay, tomorrow, no.</p>
<p>In the long term, it could be the whole thing.</p>
<p>It could be nothing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but definitely, definitely.</p>
<p>When you look at the,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know that much about DOJO.</p>
<p>My understanding is that that&rsquo;s new, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just coming online.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t even know where it hasn&rsquo;t come online.</p>
<p>And when you announce big, sexy,</p>
<p>so let me explain to you the way things work</p>
<p>in the world of business and marketing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always clear where you are</p>
<p>on the coming online part of that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know where they are exactly,</p>
<p>but the vision is from a ground up</p>
<p>to build a very, very large scale,</p>
<p>modular machine learning, ASIC,</p>
<p>basically hardware that&rsquo;s optimized</p>
<p>for training neural networks.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s a lot of companies</p>
<p>that are small and big working on this kind of problem.</p>
<p>The question is how to do it in a modular way</p>
<p>that has very fast communication.</p>
<p>The interesting aspect of Tesla is you have a company</p>
<p>that at least at this time is so singularly focused</p>
<p>on solving a particular machine learning problem</p>
<p>and is making obviously a lot of money doing so</p>
<p>because the machine learning problem</p>
<p>happens to be involved with autonomous driving.</p>
<p>So you have a system that&rsquo;s driven by an application.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really interesting because you have maybe Google</p>
<p>working on TPUs and so on.</p>
<p>You have all these other companies with ASICs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually more kind of always thinking general.</p>
<p>So I like it when it&rsquo;s driven by a particular application</p>
<p>because then you can really get to the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somehow if you just talk broadly about intelligence,</p>
<p>you may not always get to the right solutions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to couple that sometimes</p>
<p>with specific clear illustration</p>
<p>of something that requires general intelligence,</p>
<p>which for me driving is one such case.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>Sometimes just having that focus on that application</p>
<p>brings a lot of people focuses their energy and attention.</p>
<p>I think that, so one of the things that&rsquo;s appealing</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re saying is not just</p>
<p>that the application is specific,</p>
<p>but also that the scale is big</p>
<p>and that the benefit is also huge.</p>
<p>Financial and to humanity.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I guess let me just try to understand</p>
<p>is the point of this dojo system</p>
<p>to figure out the parameters</p>
<p>that then plug into neural networks</p>
<p>and then you don&rsquo;t need to retrain,</p>
<p>you just make copies of a certain chip</p>
<p>that has all the other parameters established or?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s straight up retraining a large neural network</p>
<p>over and over and over.</p>
<p>So you have to do it once for every new car?</p>
<p>No, no, you have to, so they do this interesting process,</p>
<p>which I think is a process for machine learning,</p>
<p>supervised machine learning systems</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to do, which is you have a system,</p>
<p>you train your network once, it takes a long time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long, but maybe a week.</p>
<p>Okay. To train.</p>
<p>And then you deploy it on, let&rsquo;s say about a million cars.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the number is.</p>
<p>But that part, you just write software</p>
<p>that updates some weights in a table and yeah, okay.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a loop back.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Each of those cars run into trouble, rarely,</p>
<p>but they catch the edge cases</p>
<p>of the performance of that particular system</p>
<p>and then send that data back</p>
<p>and either automatically or by humans,</p>
<p>that weird edge case data is annotated</p>
<p>and then the network has to become smart enough</p>
<p>to now be able to perform in those edge cases,</p>
<p>so it has to get retrained.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clever ways of retraining different parts</p>
<p>of that network, but for the most part,</p>
<p>I think they prefer to retrain the entire thing.</p>
<p>So you have this giant monster</p>
<p>that kind of has to be retrained regularly.</p>
<p>I think the vision with Dojo is to have</p>
<p>a very large machine learning focused,</p>
<p>driving focused supercomputer</p>
<p>that then is sufficiently modular</p>
<p>that can be scaled to other machine learning applications.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not limiting themselves completely</p>
<p>to this particular application,</p>
<p>but this application is the way they kind of test</p>
<p>this iterative process of machine learning</p>
<p>is you make a system that&rsquo;s very dumb,</p>
<p>deploy it, get the edge cases where it fails,</p>
<p>make it a little smarter, it becomes a little less dumb</p>
<p>and that iterative process achieves something</p>
<p>that you can call intelligent or is smart enough</p>
<p>to be able to solve this particular application.</p>
<p>So it has to do with training neural networks fast</p>
<p>and training neural networks that are large.</p>
<p>But also based on an extraordinary amount of diverse input.</p>
<p>Data, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things,</p>
<p>so this does seem like one of those spaces</p>
<p>where the scale of superconducting optoelectronics,</p>
<p>the way that, so when you talk about the weaknesses,</p>
<p>like I said, okay, well, you have to cool it down.</p>
<p>At this scale, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s not too much of an added cost.</p>
<p>Most of your power is being dissipated</p>
<p>by the circuits themselves, not the cooling.</p>
<p>And also you have one centralized kind of cognitive hub,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re talking about putting</p>
<p>a superconducting system in a car, that&rsquo;s questionable.</p>
<p>Do you really wanna cryostat</p>
<p>in the trunk of everyone in your car?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll fit, it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal,</p>
<p>but hopefully there&rsquo;s a better way, right?</p>
<p>But since this is sort of a central supreme intelligence</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>and it needs to really have this massive data acquisition,</p>
<p>massive data integration,</p>
<p>I would think that that&rsquo;s where large scale</p>
<p>spiking neural networks with vast communication</p>
<p>and all these things would have something</p>
<p>pretty tremendous to offer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of development that needs to be done.</p>
<p>But we have to be patient with self driving cars</p>
<p>for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>We were all optimistic that they would be here by now.</p>
<p>And okay, they are to some extent,</p>
<p>but if we&rsquo;re thinking five or 10 years down the line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not unreasonable.</p>
<p>One other thing, let me just mention,</p>
<p>getting into self driving cars and technologies</p>
<p>that are using AI out in the world,</p>
<p>this is something NIST cares a lot about.</p>
<p>Elham Tabassi is leading up a much larger effort in AI</p>
<p>at NIST than my little project.</p>
<p>And really central to that mission</p>
<p>is this concept of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re going to deploy this neural network</p>
<p>in every single automobile with so much on the line,</p>
<p>you have to be able to trust that.</p>
<p>So now how do we know that we can trust that?</p>
<p>How do we know that we can trust the self driving car</p>
<p>or the supercomputer that trained it?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of that going on at NIST.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still early days.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re familiar with the problem and all that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a fascinating dance in engineering</p>
<p>with safety critical systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a desire in computer science,</p>
<p>just recently talked to Don Knuth,</p>
<p>for algorithms and for systems,</p>
<p>for them to be provably correct or provably safe.</p>
<p>And this is one other difference</p>
<p>between humans and biological systems</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re not provably anything.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some aspect of imperfection</p>
<p>that we need to have built in,</p>
<p>like robustness to imperfection be part of our systems,</p>
<p>which is a difficult thing for engineers to contend with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very uncomfortable with the idea</p>
<p>that you have to be okay with failure</p>
<p>and almost engineer failure into the system.</p>
<p>Mathematicians hate it too.</p>
<p>But I think it was Turing who said something</p>
<p>along the lines of,</p>
<p>I can give you an intelligent system</p>
<p>or I can give you a flawless system,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t give you both.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in sort of creativity and abstract thinking</p>
<p>seem to rely somewhat on stochasticity</p>
<p>and not having components</p>
<p>that perform exactly the same way every time.</p>
<p>This is where like the disagreement I have with,</p>
<p>not disagreement, but a different view on the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Turing,</p>
<p>but when I talk to robotic, robot colleagues,</p>
<p>that sounds like I&rsquo;m talking to robots,</p>
<p>colleagues that are roboticists,</p>
<p>the goal is perfection.</p>
<p>And to me is like, no,</p>
<p>I think the goal should be imperfection</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s communicated.</p>
<p>And through the interaction between humans and robots,</p>
<p>that imperfection becomes a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Like together, seen as a system,</p>
<p>the human and the robot together</p>
<p>are better than either of them individually,</p>
<p>but the robot itself is not perfect in any way.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a bunch of disagreements,</p>
<p>including with Mr. Elon about,</p>
<p>to me, autonomous driving is fundamentally</p>
<p>a human robot interaction problem,</p>
<p>not a robotics problem.</p>
<p>To Elon, it&rsquo;s a robotics problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually an open and fascinating question,</p>
<p>whether humans can be removed from the loop completely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about a lot of fascinating chemistry</p>
<p>and physics and engineering,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re always running up against this issue</p>
<p>that nature seems to dictate what&rsquo;s easy and what&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>So you have this cool little paper</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d love to just ask you about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s titled,</p>
<p>Does Cosmological Evolution Select for Technology?</p>
<p>So in physics, there&rsquo;s parameters</p>
<p>that seem to define the way our universe works,</p>
<p>that physics works, that if it worked any differently,</p>
<p>we would get a very different world.</p>
<p>So it seems like the parameters are very fine tuned</p>
<p>to the kind of physics that we see.</p>
<p>All the beautiful E equals MC squared,</p>
<p>they would get these nice, beautiful laws.</p>
<p>It seems like very fine tuned for that.</p>
<p>So what you argue in this article</p>
<p>is it may be that the universe has also fine tuned</p>
<p>its parameters that enable the kind of technological</p>
<p>innovation that we see, the technology that we see.</p>
<p>Can you explain this idea?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you&rsquo;ve introduced it nicely.</p>
<p>Let me just try to say a few things in my language layout.</p>
<p>What is this fine tuning problem?</p>
<p>So physicists have spent centuries trying to understand</p>
<p>the system of equations that govern the way nature behaves,</p>
<p>the way particles move and interact with each other.</p>
<p>And as that understanding has become more clear over time,</p>
<p>it became sort of evident that it&rsquo;s all well adjusted</p>
<p>to allow a universe like we see, very complex,</p>
<p>this large, long lived universe.</p>
<p>And so one answer to that is, well, of course it is</p>
<p>because we wouldn&rsquo;t be here otherwise.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s not very satisfying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s known</p>
<p>as the weak anthropic principle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a statement of selection bias.</p>
<p>We can only observe a universe that is fit for us to live in.</p>
<p>So what does it mean for a universe</p>
<p>to be fit for us to live in?</p>
<p>Well, the pursuit of physics,</p>
<p>it is based partially on coming up with equations</p>
<p>that describe how things behave</p>
<p>and interact with each other.</p>
<p>But in all those equations you have,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s the form of the equation,</p>
<p>sort of how different fields or particles</p>
<p>move in space and time.</p>
<p>But then there are also the parameters</p>
<p>that just tell you sort of the strength</p>
<p>of different couplings.</p>
<p>How strongly does a charged particle</p>
<p>couple to the electromagnetic field or masses?</p>
<p>How strongly does a particle couple</p>
<p>to the Higgs field or something like that?</p>
<p>And those parameters that define,</p>
<p>not the general structure of the equations,</p>
<p>but the relative importance of different terms,</p>
<p>they seem to be every bit as important</p>
<p>as the structure of the equations themselves.</p>
<p>And so I forget who it was.</p>
<p>Somebody, when they were working through this</p>
<p>and trying to see, okay, if I adjust the parameter,</p>
<p>this parameter over here,</p>
<p>call it the, say the fine structure constant,</p>
<p>which tells us the strength</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic interaction.</p>
<p>Oh boy, I can&rsquo;t change it very much.</p>
<p>Otherwise nothing works.</p>
<p>The universe sort of doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it just pops into existence and goes away</p>
<p>in a nanosecond or something like that.</p>
<p>And somebody had the phrase,</p>
<p>this looks like a put up job,</p>
<p>meaning every one of these parameters was dialed in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arguable how precisely they have to be dialed in,</p>
<p>but dialed in to some extent,</p>
<p>not just in order to enable our existence,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very anthropocentric view,</p>
<p>but to enable a universe like this one.</p>
<p>So, okay, maybe I think the majority position</p>
<p>of working physicists in the field is,</p>
<p>it has to be that way in order for us to exist.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here, we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the way the universe is.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, for a while,</p>
<p>that never sat well with me,</p>
<p>but I just kind of moved on</p>
<p>because there are things to do</p>
<p>and a lot of exciting work.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t depend on resolving this puzzle,</p>
<p>but as I started working more with technology,</p>
<p>getting into the more recent years of my career,</p>
<p>particularly when I started,</p>
<p>after having worked with silicon for a long time,</p>
<p>which was kind of eerie on its own,</p>
<p>but then when I switched over to superconductors,</p>
<p>I was just like, this is crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just absolutely astonishing</p>
<p>that our universe gives us superconductivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful physical phenomena</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also extraordinarily useful for technology.</p>
<p>So you can argue that the universe</p>
<p>has to have the parameters it does for us to exist</p>
<p>because we couldn&rsquo;t be here otherwise,</p>
<p>but why does it give us technology?</p>
<p>Why does it give us silicon that has this ideal oxide</p>
<p>that allows us to make a transistor</p>
<p>without trying that hard?</p>
<p>That can&rsquo;t be explained by the same anthropic reasoning.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s asking the why question.</p>
<p>I mean, a slight natural extension of that question is,</p>
<p>I wonder if the parameters were different</p>
<p>if we would simply have just another set of paint brushes</p>
<p>to create totally other things</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t look like anything</p>
<p>like the technology of today,</p>
<p>but would nevertheless have incredible complexity,</p>
<p>which is if you sort of zoom out and start defining things,</p>
<p>not by like how many batteries it needs</p>
<p>and whether it can make toast,</p>
<p>but more like how much complexity is within the system</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you can start to quantify things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>So nowhere am I arguing that</p>
<p>in all of the vast parameter space</p>
<p>of everything that could conceivably exist</p>
<p>in the multiverse of nature,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this one point in parameter space</p>
<p>where complexity arises.</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>That would be a shameful waste of resources, it seems.</p>
<p>But it might be that we reside</p>
<p>at one place in parameter space</p>
<p>that has been adapted through an evolutionary process</p>
<p>to allow us to make certain technologies</p>
<p>that allow our particular kind of universe to arise</p>
<p>and sort of achieve the things it does.</p>
<p>See, I wonder if nature in this kind of discussion,</p>
<p>if nature is a catalyst for innovation</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s a ceiling for innovation.</p>
<p>So like, is it going to always limit us?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re talking about silicon.</p>
<p>Is it just make it super easy to do awesome stuff</p>
<p>in a certain dimension,</p>
<p>but we could still do awesome stuff in other ways,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just be harder?</p>
<p>Or does it really set like the maximum we can do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good subject to discuss.</p>
<p>I guess I feel like we need to lay</p>
<p>a little bit more groundwork.</p>
<p>So I want to make sure that</p>
<p>I introduce this in the context</p>
<p>of Lee Smolin&rsquo;s previous idea.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s Lee Smolin and what kind of ideas does he have?</p>
<p>Okay, Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist</p>
<p>who back in the late 1980s published a paper</p>
<p>in the early 1990s introduced this idea</p>
<p>of cosmological natural selection,</p>
<p>which argues that the universe did evolve.</p>
<p>So his paper was called, did the universe evolve?</p>
<p>And I gave myself the liberty of titling my paper</p>
<p>does cosmological selection</p>
<p>or does cosmological evolution select for technology</p>
<p>in reference to that.</p>
<p>So he introduced that idea decades ago.</p>
<p>Now he primarily works on quantum gravity,</p>
<p>loop quantum gravity, other approaches to</p>
<p>unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity,</p>
<p>as you can read about in his most recent book, I believe,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s been on your show as well.</p>
<p>So, but I want to introduce this idea</p>
<p>of cosmological natural selection,</p>
<p>because I think that is one of the core ideas</p>
<p>that could change our understanding</p>
<p>of how the universe got here, our role in it,</p>
<p>what technology is doing here.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a couple more pieces</p>
<p>that need to be set up first.</p>
<p>So the beginning of our universe is largely accepted</p>
<p>to be the big bang.</p>
<p>And what that means is if you look back in time</p>
<p>by looking far away in space,</p>
<p>you see that everything used to be at one point</p>
<p>and it expanded away from there.</p>
<p>There was an era in the evolutionary process of our universe</p>
<p>that was called inflation.</p>
<p>And this idea was developed primarily by Alan Guth</p>
<p>and others, Andre Linde and others in the 80s.</p>
<p>And this idea of inflation is basically that</p>
<p>when a singularity begins this process of growth,</p>
<p>there can be a temporary stage</p>
<p>where it just accelerates incredibly rapidly.</p>
<p>And based on quantum field theory,</p>
<p>this tells us that this should produce matter</p>
<p>in precisely the proportions that we find</p>
<p>of hydrogen and helium in the big bang,</p>
<p>lithium too, lithium also, and other things too.</p>
<p>So the predictions that come out of big bang</p>
<p>inflationary cosmology have stood up extremely well</p>
<p>to empirical verification,</p>
<p>the cosmic microwave background, things like this.</p>
<p>So most scientists working in the field</p>
<p>think that the origin of our universe is the big bang.</p>
<p>And I base all my thinking on that as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just laying this out there so that people understand</p>
<p>that where I&rsquo;m coming from is an extension,</p>
<p>not a replacement of existing well founded ideas.</p>
<p>In a paper, I believe it was 1986 with Alan Guth</p>
<p>and another author Farhi,</p>
<p>they wrote that a big bang,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the exact quote,</p>
<p>a big bang is inextricably linked with a black hole.</p>
<p>The singularity that we call our origin</p>
<p>is mathematically indistinguishable from a black hole.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same thing.</p>
<p>And Lee Smolin based his thinking on that idea,</p>
<p>I believe, I don&rsquo;t mean to speak for him,</p>
<p>but this is my reading of it.</p>
<p>So what Lee Smolin will say is that</p>
<p>a black hole in one universe is a big bang</p>
<p>in another universe.</p>
<p>And this allows us to have progeny, offspring.</p>
<p>So a universe can be said to have come</p>
<p>before another universe.</p>
<p>And very crucially, Smolin argues,</p>
<p>I think this is potentially one of the great ideas</p>
<p>of all time, that&rsquo;s my opinion,</p>
<p>that when a black hole forms, it&rsquo;s not a classical entity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a quantum gravitational entity.</p>
<p>So it is subject to the fluctuations</p>
<p>that are inherent in quantum mechanics, the properties,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re calling the parameters</p>
<p>that describe the physics of that system</p>
<p>are subject to slight mutations</p>
<p>so that the offspring universe</p>
<p>does not have the exact same parameters</p>
<p>defining its physics as its parent universe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re close, but they&rsquo;re a little bit different.</p>
<p>And so now you have a mechanism for evolution,</p>
<p>for natural selection.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s mutation, so there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and then if you think about the DNA of the universe</p>
<p>are the basic parameters that govern its laws.</p>
<p>Exactly, so what Smolin said is our universe results</p>
<p>from an evolutionary process that can be traced back</p>
<p>some, he estimated, 200 million generations.</p>
<p>Initially, there was something like a vacuum fluctuation</p>
<p>that produced through random chance a universe</p>
<p>that was able to reproduce just one.</p>
<p>So now it had one offspring.</p>
<p>And then over time, it was able to make more and more</p>
<p>until it evolved into a highly structured universe</p>
<p>with a very long lifetime, with a great deal of complexity</p>
<p>and importantly, especially importantly for Lee Smolin,</p>
<p>stars, stars make black holes.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should expect our universe</p>
<p>to be optimized, have its physical parameters optimized</p>
<p>to make very large numbers of stars</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you make black holes</p>
<p>and black holes make offspring.</p>
<p>So we expect the physics of our universe to have evolved</p>
<p>to maximize fecundity, the number of offspring.</p>
<p>And the way Lee Smolin argues you do that</p>
<p>is through stars that the biggest ones die</p>
<p>in these core collapse supernova</p>
<p>that make a black hole and a child.</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, I agree with you</p>
<p>that this is back to our fractal view of everything</p>
<p>from intelligence to our universe.</p>
<p>That is very compelling and a very powerful idea</p>
<p>that unites the origin of life</p>
<p>and perhaps the origin of ideas and intelligence.</p>
<p>So from a Dawkins perspective here on earth,</p>
<p>the evolution of those and then the evolution</p>
<p>of the laws of physics that led to us.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And then you stacking on top of that,</p>
<p>that maybe we are one of the offspring.</p>
<p>Right, okay, so before getting into where I&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to take that idea, let me just a little bit more groundwork.</p>
<p>There is this concept of the multiverse</p>
<p>and it can be confusing.</p>
<p>Different people use the word multiverse in different ways.</p>
<p>In the multiverse that I think is relevant to picture</p>
<p>when trying to grasp Lee Smolin&rsquo;s idea,</p>
<p>essentially every vacuum fluctuation</p>
<p>can be referred to as a universe.</p>
<p>It occurs, it borrows energy from the vacuum</p>
<p>for some finite amount of time</p>
<p>and it evanesces back into the quantum vacuum.</p>
<p>And ideas of Guth before that and Andrei Linde</p>
<p>with eternal inflation aren&rsquo;t that different</p>
<p>that you would expect nature</p>
<p>due to the quantum properties of the vacuum,</p>
<p>which we know exist, they&rsquo;re measurable</p>
<p>through things like the Casimir effect and others.</p>
<p>You know that there are these fluctuations</p>
<p>that are occurring.</p>
<p>What Smolin is arguing is that there is</p>
<p>this extensive multiverse, that this universe,</p>
<p>what we can measure and interact with</p>
<p>is not unique in nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just our residents, it&rsquo;s where we reside.</p>
<p>And there are countless, potentially infinity</p>
<p>other universes, other entire evolutionary trajectories</p>
<p>that have evolved into things like</p>
<p>what you were mentioning a second ago</p>
<p>with different parameters and different ways</p>
<p>of achieving complexity and reproduction</p>
<p>and all that stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that the evolutionary process</p>
<p>is a funnel towards this end point, not at all.</p>
<p>Just like the biological evolutionary process</p>
<p>that has occurred within our universe</p>
<p>is not a unique route toward achieving</p>
<p>one specific chosen kind of species.</p>
<p>No, we have extraordinary diversity around us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what evolution does.</p>
<p>And for any one species like us,</p>
<p>you might feel like we&rsquo;re at the center of this process.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the destination of this process,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just one of the many</p>
<p>nearly infinite branches of this process.</p>
<p>And I suspect it is exactly infinite.</p>
<p>I mean, I just can&rsquo;t understand how with this idea,</p>
<p>you can ever draw a boundary around it and say,</p>
<p>no, the universe, I mean, the multiverse</p>
<p>has 10 to the one quadrillion components,</p>
<p>but not infinity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I have cognitively incapable</p>
<p>as I think all of us are</p>
<p>and truly understanding the concept of infinity.</p>
<p>And the concept of nothing as well.</p>
<p>And nothing, but also the concept of a lot</p>
<p>is pretty difficult.</p>
<p>I can just, I can count.</p>
<p>I run out of fingers at a certain point</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re wearing shoes</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t even get down to your toes, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, a thousand fine, a million.</p>
<p>Is that what?</p>
<p>And then it gets crazier and crazier.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So this particular, so when we say technology, by the way,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some, not to over romanticize the thing,</p>
<p>but there is some aspect about this branch of ours</p>
<p>that allows us to, for the universe to know itself.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So to be, to have like little conscious cognitive fingers</p>
<p>that are able to feel like to scratch the head.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>To be able to construct E equals MC squared</p>
<p>and to introspect, to start to gain some understanding</p>
<p>of the laws that govern it.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that, isn&rsquo;t that kind of amazing?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m just human, but it feels like that,</p>
<p>if I were to build a system that does this kind of thing,</p>
<p>that evolves laws of physics, that evolves life,</p>
<p>that evolves intelligence, that my goal would be</p>
<p>to come up with things that are able to think about itself.</p>
<p>Right, aren&rsquo;t we kind of close to the design specs,</p>
<p>the destination?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty close, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m spending my career designing things</p>
<p>that I hope will think about themselves,</p>
<p>so you and I aren&rsquo;t too far apart on that one.</p>
<p>But then maybe that problem is a lot harder</p>
<p>than we imagine.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get, let&rsquo;s not get too far</p>
<p>because I want to emphasize something that,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying is, isn&rsquo;t it fascinating</p>
<p>that the universe evolved something</p>
<p>that can be conscious, reflect on itself?</p>
<p>But Lee Smolin&rsquo;s idea didn&rsquo;t take us there, remember?</p>
<p>It took us to stars.</p>
<p>Lee Smolin has argued, I think,</p>
<p>right on almost every single way</p>
<p>that cosmological natural selection</p>
<p>could lead to a universe with rich structure.</p>
<p>And he argued that the structure,</p>
<p>the physics of our universe is designed</p>
<p>to make a lot of stars so that they can make black holes.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t explain what we&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>In order for that to be an explanation of us,</p>
<p>what you have to assume is that once you made that universe</p>
<p>that was capable of producing stars,</p>
<p>life, planets, all these other things,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re along for the ride.</p>
<p>They got lucky.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of arising, growing up in the cracks,</p>
<p>but the universe isn&rsquo;t here for us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still kind of a fluke in that picture.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t necessarily have</p>
<p>like a philosophical opposition to that stance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not, okay, so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s complete.</p>
<p>So it seems like whatever we got going on here to you,</p>
<p>it seems like whatever we have here on earth</p>
<p>seems like a thing you might want to select for</p>
<p>in this whole big process.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So if what you are truly,</p>
<p>if your entire evolutionary process</p>
<p>only cares about fecundity,</p>
<p>it only cares about making offspring universes</p>
<p>because then there&rsquo;s gonna be the most of them</p>
<p>in that local region of hyperspace,</p>
<p>which is the set of all possible universes, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care how those universes are made.</p>
<p>You know they have to be made by black holes.</p>
<p>This is what inflationary theory tells us.</p>
<p>The big bang tells us that black holes make universes.</p>
<p>But what if there was a technological means</p>
<p>to make universes?</p>
<p>Stars require a ton of matter</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not thinking very carefully</p>
<p>about how you make a black hole.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just using gravity, you know?</p>
<p>But if we devise technologies</p>
<p>that can efficiently compress matter into a singularity,</p>
<p>it turns out that if you can compress about 10 kilograms</p>
<p>into a very small volume,</p>
<p>that will make a black hole</p>
<p>that is likely highly probable to inflate</p>
<p>into its own offspring universe.</p>
<p>This is according to calculations done by other people</p>
<p>who are professional quantum theorists,</p>
<p>quantum field theorists,</p>
<p>and I hope I am grasping what they&rsquo;re telling me correctly.</p>
<p>I am somewhat of a translator here.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s the position</p>
<p>that is particularly intriguing to me,</p>
<p>which is that what might have happened is that,</p>
<p>okay, this particular branch on the vast tree of evolution,</p>
<p>cosmological evolution that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>not biological evolution within our universe,</p>
<p>but cosmological evolution,</p>
<p>went through exactly the process</p>
<p>that Elise Mullen described,</p>
<p>got to the stage where stars were making lots of black holes</p>
<p>but then continued to evolve and somehow bridged that gap</p>
<p>and made intelligence and intelligence</p>
<p>capable of devising technologies</p>
<p>because technologies, intelligent species</p>
<p>working in conjunction with technologies</p>
<p>could then produce even more.</p>
<p>Yeah, more efficiently, more faster and better</p>
<p>and more different.</p>
<p>Then you start to have different kind of mechanisms</p>
<p>and mutation perhaps, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And so if you do a simple calculation that says,</p>
<p>all right, if I want to,</p>
<p>we know roughly how many core collapse supernovae</p>
<p>have resulted in black holes in our galaxy</p>
<p>since the beginning of the universe</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something like a billion.</p>
<p>So then you would have to estimate</p>
<p>that it would be possible for a technological civilization</p>
<p>to produce more than a billion black holes</p>
<p>with the energy and matter at their disposal.</p>
<p>And so one of the calculations in that paper,</p>
<p>back of the envelope,</p>
<p>but I think revealing nonetheless is that</p>
<p>if you take a relatively common asteroid,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s about a kilometer in diameter,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m thinking of is just scrap material</p>
<p>laying around in our solar system</p>
<p>and break it up into 10 kilogram chunks</p>
<p>and turn each of those into a universe,</p>
<p>then you would have made at least a trillion black holes</p>
<p>outpacing the star production rate</p>
<p>by some three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one asteroid.</p>
<p>So now if you envision an intelligent species</p>
<p>that would potentially have been devised initially</p>
<p>by humans, but then based on superconducting</p>
<p>optoelectronic networks, no doubt,</p>
<p>and they go out and populate,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to fill the galaxy.</p>
<p>They just have to get out to the asteroid belt.</p>
<p>They could potentially dramatically outpace</p>
<p>the rate at which stars are producing offspring universes.</p>
<p>And then wouldn&rsquo;t you expect that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we came from instead of a star?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have to somehow become masters of gravity,</p>
<p>so like, or generate.</p>
<p>John, this is really gravity.</p>
<p>So stars make black holes with gravity,</p>
<p>but any force that can make the energy density</p>
<p>can compactify matter to produce</p>
<p>a great enough energy density can form a singularity.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it would not likely be gravity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the weakest force.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more likely to use something like the technologies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re developing for fusion, for example.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, the Large Ignition Facility</p>
<p>recently blasted a pellet with 100 really bright lasers</p>
<p>and caused that to get dense enough</p>
<p>to engage in nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>So something more like that,</p>
<p>or a tokamak with a really hot plasma, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Something, I don&rsquo;t know exactly how it would be done.</p>
<p>I do like the idea of that,</p>
<p>especially just been reading a lot about gravitational waves</p>
<p>and the fact that us humans with our technological</p>
<p>capabilities, one of the most impressive</p>
<p>technological accomplishments of human history is LIGO,</p>
<p>being able to precisely detect gravitational waves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly find appealing the idea</p>
<p>that other alien civilizations from very far distances</p>
<p>communicate with gravity, with gravitational waves,</p>
<p>because as you become greater and greater master of gravity,</p>
<p>which seems way out of reach for us right now,</p>
<p>maybe that seems like a effective way of sending signals,</p>
<p>especially if your job is to manufacture black holes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that, so let me ask there,</p>
<p>whatever, I mean, broadly thinking,</p>
<p>because we tend to think other alien civilizations</p>
<p>would be very human like,</p>
<p>but if we think of alien civilizations out there</p>
<p>as basically generators of black holes,</p>
<p>however they do it, because they got stars,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s a lot of them</p>
<p>in our particular universe out there?</p>
<p>In our universe?</p>
<p>Well, okay, let me ask, okay, this is great.</p>
<p>Let me ask a very generic question</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s see how you answer it,</p>
<p>which is how many alien civilizations are out there?</p>
<p>If the hypothesis that I just described</p>
<p>is on the right track,</p>
<p>it would mean that the parameters of our universe</p>
<p>have been selected so that intelligent civilizations</p>
<p>will occur in sufficient numbers</p>
<p>so that if they reach something</p>
<p>like supreme technological maturity,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s define that as the ability to produce black holes,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s not a highly improbable event.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to happen often</p>
<p>because as I just described,</p>
<p>if you get one of them in a galaxy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna make more black holes</p>
<p>than the stars in that galaxy.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also not a super strong motivation,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s not obvious that you need them</p>
<p>to be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>One of the things that I try to emphasize in that paper</p>
<p>is that given this idea</p>
<p>of how our parameters might&rsquo;ve been selected,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s a series of trade offs, right?</p>
<p>If you make, I mean, in order for intelligent life</p>
<p>of our variety or anything resembling us to occur,</p>
<p>you need a bunch of stuff, you need stars.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s right back to Smolin&rsquo;s roots of this idea,</p>
<p>but you also need water to have certain properties.</p>
<p>You need things like the rocky planets,</p>
<p>like the Earth to be within the habitable zone,</p>
<p>all these things that you start talking about</p>
<p>in the field of astrobiology,</p>
<p>trying to understand life in the universe,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t over emphasize,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tune the parameters so precisely</p>
<p>to maximize the number of stars</p>
<p>or to give water exactly the properties</p>
<p>or to make rocky planets like Earth the most numerous.</p>
<p>You have to compromise on all these things.</p>
<p>And so I think the way to test this idea</p>
<p>is to look at what parameters are necessary</p>
<p>for each of these different subsystems,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve laid out a few that I think are promising,</p>
<p>there could be countless others,</p>
<p>and see how changing the parameters</p>
<p>makes it more or less likely that stars would form</p>
<p>and have long lifetimes or that rocky planets</p>
<p>in the habitable zone are likely to form,</p>
<p>all these different things.</p>
<p>So we can test how much these things are in a tug of war</p>
<p>with each other, and the prediction would be</p>
<p>that we kind of sit at this central point</p>
<p>where if you move the parameters too much,</p>
<p>stars aren&rsquo;t stable, or life doesn&rsquo;t form,</p>
<p>or technology&rsquo;s infeasible,</p>
<p>because life alone, at least the kind of life</p>
<p>that we know of, cannot make black holes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have this, well, I&rsquo;m speaking for myself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a very fit and strong person,</p>
<p>but it might be possible for you,</p>
<p>but not for me to compress matter.</p>
<p>So we need these technologies, but we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>we have not been able to quantify yet</p>
<p>how finely adjusted the parameters would need to be</p>
<p>in order for silicon to have the properties it does.</p>
<p>Okay, this is not directly speaking to what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting to the Fermi paradox,</p>
<p>which is where are they, where are the life forms out there,</p>
<p>how numerous are they, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to argue is that</p>
<p>if this framework is on the right track,</p>
<p>a potentially correct explanation for our existence,</p>
<p>we, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily predict</p>
<p>that intelligent civilizations are just everywhere,</p>
<p>because even if you just get one of them in a galaxy,</p>
<p>which is quite rare, it could be enough</p>
<p>to dramatically increase the fecundity</p>
<p>of the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I wonder, once you start generating</p>
<p>the offspring for universes, black holes,</p>
<p>how that has effect on the,</p>
<p>what kind of effect does it have</p>
<p>on the other candidate&rsquo;s civilizations</p>
<p>within that universe?</p>
<p>Maybe it has a destructive aspect,</p>
<p>or there could be some arguments</p>
<p>about once you have a lot of offspring,</p>
<p>that that just quickly accelerates</p>
<p>to where the other ones can&rsquo;t even catch up.</p>
<p>It could, but I guess if you want me</p>
<p>to put my chips on the table or whatever,</p>
<p>I think I come down more on the side</p>
<p>that intelligent life civilizations are rare.</p>
<p>And I guess I follow Max Tegmark here.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s a lot of papers coming out recently</p>
<p>in the field of astrobiology that are seeming to say,</p>
<p>all right, you just work through the numbers</p>
<p>on some modified Drake equation or something like that.</p>
<p>And it looks like it&rsquo;s not improbable.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that an intelligent species</p>
<p>has arisen in our galaxy,</p>
<p>but if you think there&rsquo;s one the next solar system over,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s highly improbable.</p>
<p>So I can see that the number,</p>
<p>the probability of finding a civilization in a galaxy,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s most likely that you&rsquo;re gonna find</p>
<p>one to a hundred or something.</p>
<p>But okay, now it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to put a time window on that, I think,</p>
<p>because does that mean in the entire lifetime of the galaxy</p>
<p>before it, so for in our case, before we run into Andromeda,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s highly probable, I shouldn&rsquo;t say I think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tempting to believe that it&rsquo;s highly probable</p>
<p>that in that entire lifetime of your galaxy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get at least one intelligent species,</p>
<p>maybe thousands or something like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, I think, a little bit naive to think</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to coincide in time</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be able to observe them.</p>
<p>And also, if you look at the span of life on Earth,</p>
<p>the Earth history, it was surprising to me</p>
<p>to kind of look at the amount of time,</p>
<p>first of all, the short amount of time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no life, it&rsquo;s surprising.</p>
<p>Life sprang up pretty quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s single cell.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m trying to make</p>
<p>is like so much of life on Earth</p>
<p>was just like single cell organisms, like most of it.</p>
<p>Most of it was like boring bacteria type of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, bacteria are fascinating, but I take your point.</p>
<p>No, I get it.</p>
<p>I mean, no offense to them.</p>
<p>But this kind of speaking from the perspective</p>
<p>of your paper of something that&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to generate technology as we kind of understand it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very short moment in time</p>
<p>relative to that full history of life on Earth.</p>
<p>And maybe our universe is just saturated</p>
<p>with bacteria like humans.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But not the special extra AGI super humans,</p>
<p>that those are very rare.</p>
<p>And once those spring up, everything just goes to like,</p>
<p>it accelerates very quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, we just don&rsquo;t have enough data to really say,</p>
<p>but I find this whole subject extremely engaging.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s this concept,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called the Rare Earth Hypothesis,</p>
<p>which is that basically stating that,</p>
<p>okay, microbes were here right away</p>
<p>after the Hadian era where we were being bombarded.</p>
<p>Well, after, yeah, bombarded by comets, asteroids,</p>
<p>things like that, and also after the moon formed.</p>
<p>So once things settled down a little bit,</p>
<p>in a few hundred million years,</p>
<p>you have microbes everywhere.</p>
<p>And it could have been, we don&rsquo;t know exactly</p>
<p>when it could have been remarkably brief that that took.</p>
<p>So it does indicate that, okay,</p>
<p>life forms relatively easily.</p>
<p>I think that alone is sort of a checker on the scale</p>
<p>for the argument that the parameters that allow</p>
<p>even microbial life to form are not just a fluke.</p>
<p>But anyway, that aside, yes,</p>
<p>then there was this long dormant period,</p>
<p>not dormant, things were happening,</p>
<p>but important things were happening</p>
<p>for some two and a half billion years or something</p>
<p>after the metabolic process</p>
<p>that releases oxygen was developed.</p>
<p>Then basically the planet&rsquo;s just sitting there,</p>
<p>getting more and more oxygenated,</p>
<p>more and more oxygenated until it&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>that you can build these large, complex organisms.</p>
<p>And so the Rare Earth Hypothesis would argue</p>
<p>that the microbes are common everywhere</p>
<p>in any planet that&rsquo;s roughly in the habitable zone</p>
<p>and has some water on it, it&rsquo;s probably gonna have those.</p>
<p>But then getting to this Cambrian explosion</p>
<p>that happened some between 500 and 600 million years ago,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rare, you know?</p>
<p>And I buy that, I think that is rare.</p>
<p>So if you say how much life is in our galaxy,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the right answer</p>
<p>is that microbes are everywhere.</p>
<p>Cambrian explosion is extremely rare.</p>
<p>And then, but the Cambrian explosion kind of went like that</p>
<p>where within a couple of tens or a hundred million years,</p>
<p>all of these body plans came into existence.</p>
<p>And basically all of the body plans</p>
<p>that are now in existence on the planet</p>
<p>were formed in that brief window</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve just been shuffling around since then.</p>
<p>So then what caused humans to pop out of that?</p>
<p>I mean, that could be another extremely rare threshold</p>
<p>that a planet roughly in the habitable zone with water</p>
<p>is not guaranteed to cross, you know?</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s fascinating for being humble,</p>
<p>like the humans cannot possibly be the most amazing thing</p>
<p>that such, if you look at the entirety of the system</p>
<p>that Lee Smolin and you paint,</p>
<p>that cannot possibly be the most amazing thing</p>
<p>that process generates.</p>
<p>So like, if you look at the evolution,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the equivalent in the cosmological evolution</p>
<p>and its selection for technology,</p>
<p>the equivalent of the human eye or the human brain?</p>
<p>Universes that are able to do some like,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t need the damn stars.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to just do some incredible generation</p>
<p>of complexity fast, like much more than,</p>
<p>if you think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like most of our universe is pretty freaking boring.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much going on, there&rsquo;s a few rocks flying around</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some like apes</p>
<p>that are just like doing podcasts on some weird planet.</p>
<p>It just seems very inefficient.</p>
<p>If you think about like the amazing thing in the human eye,</p>
<p>the visual cortex can do, the brain, the nervous,</p>
<p>everything that makes us more powerful</p>
<p>than single cell organisms.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s an equivalent of that for universes,</p>
<p>like the richness of physics</p>
<p>that could be expressed</p>
<p>through a particular set of parameters.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, like for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sort of from a computer science perspective,</p>
<p>huge fan of cellular automata,</p>
<p>which is a nice sort of pretty visual way</p>
<p>to illustrate how different laws</p>
<p>can result in drastically different levels of complexity.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s like, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all like celebrating,</p>
<p>look, our little cellular automata</p>
<p>is able to generate pretty triangles and squares</p>
<p>and therefore we achieve general intelligence.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be like some badass Chuck Norris type,</p>
<p>like universal Turing machine type of cellular automata.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to generate other cellular automata</p>
<p>that does any arbitrary level of computation off the bat.</p>
<p>Like those have to then exist.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re just like, we&rsquo;ll be forgotten.</p>
<p>This story, this podcast just entertains</p>
<p>a few other apes for a few months.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m kind of surprised to hear your cynicism.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m very up.</p>
<p>I usually think of you as like one who celebrates humanity</p>
<p>and all its forms and things like that.</p>
<p>And I guess I just, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I see it the way you just described.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, we&rsquo;ve been here for 13.7 billion years</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re saying, gosh, that&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get on with the show already.</p>
<p>Some other universe could have kicked our butt by now,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s putting a characteristic time.</p>
<p>I mean, why is 13.7 billion a long time?</p>
<p>I mean, compared to what?</p>
<p>I guess, so when I look at our universe,</p>
<p>I see this extraordinary hierarchy</p>
<p>that has developed over that time.</p>
<p>So at the beginning, it was a chaotic mess of some plasma</p>
<p>and nothing interesting going on there.</p>
<p>And even for the first stars to form,</p>
<p>that a lot of really interesting evolutionary processes</p>
<p>had to occur, by evolutionary in that sense,</p>
<p>I just mean taking place over extended periods of time</p>
<p>and structures are forming then.</p>
<p>And then it took that first generation of stars</p>
<p>in order to produce the metals</p>
<p>that then can more efficiently produce</p>
<p>another generation of stars.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only the third generation of stars.</p>
<p>So we might still be pretty quick to the game here.</p>
<p>So, but I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t, okay.</p>
<p>So then you have these stars</p>
<p>and then you have solar systems on those solar systems.</p>
<p>You have rocky worlds, you have gas giants,</p>
<p>like all this complexity.</p>
<p>And then you start getting life</p>
<p>and the complexity that&rsquo;s evolved</p>
<p>through the evolutionary process in life forms</p>
<p>is just, it&rsquo;s not a let down to me.</p>
<p>Just seeing that.</p>
<p>Some of it is like some of the planets is like icy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like different flavors of ice cream.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re icy, but there might be water underneath.</p>
<p>All kinds of life forms with some volcanoes,</p>
<p>all kinds of weird stuff.</p>
<p>No, no, I don&rsquo;t, I think it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I think our life is beautiful.</p>
<p>And I think it was designed that by design,</p>
<p>the scarcity of the whole thing.</p>
<p>I think mortality, as terrifying as it is,</p>
<p>is fundamental to the whole reason we enjoy everything.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I just think that all of us conscious beings</p>
<p>in the grand scheme of basically every scale</p>
<p>will be completely forgotten.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I think everything is transient</p>
<p>and that would go back to maybe something more like Lao Tzu,</p>
<p>the Tao Te Ching or something where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>yes, there is nothing but change.</p>
<p>There is nothing but emergence and dissolve and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>But I just, in this picture,</p>
<p>this hierarchy that&rsquo;s developed,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say that now it gets to us</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the pinnacle.</p>
<p>In fact, I think at a high level,</p>
<p>the story I&rsquo;m trying to tease out in my research is about,</p>
<p>okay, well, so then what&rsquo;s the next level of hierarchy?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s, okay, we&rsquo;re kind of pretty smart.</p>
<p>I mean, talking about people like Lee Small</p>
<p>and Alan Guth, Max Tegmark, okay, we&rsquo;re really smart.</p>
<p>Talking about me, okay, we&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>we can find our way to the grocery store or whatever,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I mean, what if there&rsquo;s another level of hierarchy</p>
<p>that grows on top of us</p>
<p>that is even more profoundly capable?</p>
<p>And I mean, we&rsquo;ve talked a lot</p>
<p>about superconducting sensors.</p>
<p>Imagine these cognitive systems far more capable than us</p>
<p>residing somewhere else in the solar system</p>
<p>off of the surface of the earth,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s much darker, much colder,</p>
<p>much more naturally suited to them.</p>
<p>And they have these sensors that can detect single photons</p>
<p>of light from radio waves out to all across the spectrum</p>
<p>of the gamma rays and just see the whole universe.</p>
<p>And they just live in space</p>
<p>with these massive collection optics so that they,</p>
<p>what do they do?</p>
<p>They just look out and experience that vast array</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s being developed.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re such a system,</p>
<p>presumably you would do some things for fun.</p>
<p>And the kind of fun thing I would do</p>
<p>as somebody who likes video games</p>
<p>is I would create and maintain</p>
<p>and observe something like earth.</p>
<p>So in some sense, we&rsquo;re like all what players on a stage</p>
<p>for this superconducting cold computing system out there.</p>
<p>I mean, all of this is fascinating to think.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re actually designing systems</p>
<p>here on earth that are trying to push this technological</p>
<p>at the very cutting edge and also thinking about</p>
<p>how does the like the evolution of physical laws</p>
<p>lead us to the way we are is fascinating.</p>
<p>That coupling is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the ultimate rigorous application of philosophy</p>
<p>to the rigorous application of engineering.</p>
<p>So Jeff, you&rsquo;re one of the most fascinating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I did not know much about you</p>
<p>except through your work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so glad we got this chance to talk.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the best explainers</p>
<p>of exceptionally difficult concepts.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also, speaking of like fractal,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to function intellectually</p>
<p>at all levels of the stack, which I deeply appreciate.</p>
<p>This was really fun.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great educator, a great scientist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor that you would spend</p>
<p>your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor that you would spend your time with me as well.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jeff.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jeff Schoenlein.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from the great John Carmack,</p>
<p>who surely will be a guest on this podcast soon.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of Moore&rsquo;s Law,</p>
<p>anything that an extremely clever graphics programmer</p>
<p>can do at one point can be replicated</p>
<p>by a merely competent programmer</p>
<p>some number of years later.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
