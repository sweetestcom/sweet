    <p>The following is a conversation with Grant Sanderson.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a math educator and creator of 3Blue1Brown,</p>
<p>a popular YouTube channel</p>
<p>that uses programmatically animated visualizations</p>
<p>to explain concepts in linear algebra, calculus,</p>
<p>and other fields of mathematics.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give us five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>I recently started doing ads</p>
<p>at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell,</p>
<p>and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has an investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,</p>
<p>no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,</p>
<p>best known for their FIRST Robotics and LEGO competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries</p>
<p>and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,</p>
<p>which means the donated money is used</p>
<p>to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store at Google Play</p>
<p>and use code LEXPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>which again is an organization</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys</p>
<p>to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Grant Sanderson.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there in the universe,</p>
<p>do you think their mathematics is different than ours?</p>
<p>Jumping right in.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably very different.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an obvious sense the notation is different, right?</p>
<p>I think notation can guide what the math itself is.</p>
<p>I think it has everything to do with the form</p>
<p>of their existence, right?</p>
<p>Do you think they have basic arithmetic?</p>
<p>Sorry, I interrupted.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think they count, right?</p>
<p>I think notions like one, two, three,</p>
<p>the natural numbers, that&rsquo;s extremely, well, natural.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost why we put that name to it.</p>
<p>As soon as you can count,</p>
<p>you have a notion of repetition, right?</p>
<p>Because you can count by two, two times or three times.</p>
<p>And so you have this notion of repeating</p>
<p>the idea of counting, which brings you addition</p>
<p>and multiplication.</p>
<p>I think the way that we extend it to the real numbers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of choice in that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this funny number system</p>
<p>called the servial numbers</p>
<p>that it captures the idea of continuity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a distinct mathematical object.</p>
<p>You could very well model the universe</p>
<p>and motion of planets with that</p>
<p>as the back end of your math, right?</p>
<p>And you still have kind of the same interface</p>
<p>with the front end of what physical laws you&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>or what physical phenomena you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to describe with math.</p>
<p>And I wonder if the little glimpses that we have</p>
<p>of what choices you can make along the way</p>
<p>based on what different mathematicians</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve brought to the table</p>
<p>is just scratching the surface</p>
<p>of what the different possibilities are</p>
<p>if you have a completely different mode of thought, right?</p>
<p>Or a mode of interacting with the universe.</p>
<p>And you think notation is a key part of the journey</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve taken through math.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the most salient part</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d notice at first.</p>
<p>I think the mode of thought is gonna influence things</p>
<p>more than like the notation itself.</p>
<p>But notation actually carries a lot of weight</p>
<p>when it comes to how we think about things,</p>
<p>more so than we usually give it credit for.</p>
<p>I would be comfortable saying.</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite or least favorite piece of notation</p>
<p>in terms of its effectiveness?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, well, so least favorite,</p>
<p>one that I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about</p>
<p>that will be a video I don&rsquo;t know when, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>The number e, we write the function e to the x,</p>
<p>this general exponential function</p>
<p>with a notation e to the x</p>
<p>that implies you should think about a particular number,</p>
<p>this constant of nature,</p>
<p>and you repeatedly multiply it by itself.</p>
<p>And then you say, oh, what&rsquo;s e to the square root of two?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, oh, well, we&rsquo;ve extended the idea</p>
<p>of repeated multiplication.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all nice, that&rsquo;s all nice and well.</p>
<p>But very famously, you have like e to the pi i,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, well, we&rsquo;re extending the idea</p>
<p>of repeated multiplication into the complex numbers.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can think about it that way.</p>
<p>In reality, I think that it&rsquo;s just the wrong way</p>
<p>of notationally representing this function,</p>
<p>the exponential function,</p>
<p>which itself could be represented</p>
<p>a number of different ways.</p>
<p>You can think about it in terms of the problem it solves,</p>
<p>a certain very simple differential equation,</p>
<p>which often yields way more insight</p>
<p>than trying to twist the idea of repeated multiplication,</p>
<p>like take its arm and put it behind its back</p>
<p>and throw it on the desk and be like,</p>
<p>you will apply to complex numbers, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s pedagogically helpful.</p>
<p>So the repeated multiplication is actually missing</p>
<p>the main point, the power of e to the x.</p>
<p>I mean, what it addresses is things where the rate</p>
<p>at which something changes depends on its own value,</p>
<p>but more specifically, it depends on it linearly.</p>
<p>So for example, if you have like a population</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s growing and the rate at which it grows</p>
<p>depends on how many members of the population</p>
<p>are already there,</p>
<p>it looks like this nice exponential curve.</p>
<p>It makes sense to talk about repeated multiplication</p>
<p>because you say, how much is there after one year,</p>
<p>two years, three years, you&rsquo;re multiplying by something.</p>
<p>The relationship can be a little bit different sometimes</p>
<p>where let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve got a ball on a string,</p>
<p>like a game of tetherball going around a rope, right?</p>
<p>And you say, its velocity is always perpendicular</p>
<p>to its position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another way of describing its rate of change</p>
<p>is being related to where it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different operation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not scaling it, it&rsquo;s a rotation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this 90 degree rotation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the whole idea of like complex exponentiation</p>
<p>is trying to capture,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s obfuscated in the notation</p>
<p>when what it&rsquo;s actually saying,</p>
<p>like if you really parse something like e to the pi i,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s saying is choose an origin,</p>
<p>always move perpendicular to the vector</p>
<p>from that origin to you, okay?</p>
<p>Then when you walk pi times that radius,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be halfway around.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the, you turn 90 degrees and you walk,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be going in a circle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the phenomenon that it&rsquo;s describing,</p>
<p>but trying to twist the idea</p>
<p>of repeatedly multiplying a constant into that.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t even think of the number of human hours</p>
<p>of like intelligent human hours that have been wasted</p>
<p>trying to parse that to their own liking and desire</p>
<p>among like scientists or electrical engineers</p>
<p>or students everywhere,</p>
<p>which if the notation were a little different</p>
<p>or the way that this whole function was introduced</p>
<p>from the get go were framed differently,</p>
<p>I think could have been avoided, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>the most beautiful equation in mathematics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still pretty mysterious, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re making it seem like it&rsquo;s a notational.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mysterious.</p>
<p>I think the notation makes it mysterious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s, I think the fact that it represents,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty, it&rsquo;s not like the most beautiful thing</p>
<p>in the world, but it&rsquo;s quite pretty.</p>
<p>The idea that if you take the linear operation</p>
<p>of a 90 degree rotation,</p>
<p>and then you do this general exponentiation thing to it,</p>
<p>that what you get are all the other kinds of rotation,</p>
<p>which is basically to say,</p>
<p>if your velocity vector is perpendicular</p>
<p>to your position vector, you walk in a circle,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the most beautiful thing in the world,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quite pretty.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, I think comes from perhaps</p>
<p>the awkwardness of the notation</p>
<p>somehow still nevertheless coming together nicely,</p>
<p>because you have like several disciplines coming together</p>
<p>in a single equation.</p>
<p>Well, I think.</p>
<p>In a sense, like historically speaking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got, so like the number E is significant.</p>
<p>Like it shows up in probability all the time.</p>
<p>It like shows up in calculus all the time.</p>
<p>It is significant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing it sort of mated with pi,</p>
<p>this geometric constant and I,</p>
<p>like the imaginary number and such.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s really happening there</p>
<p>is the way that E shows up is when you have things</p>
<p>like exponential growth and decay, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when this relation that something&rsquo;s rate of change</p>
<p>has to itself is a simple scaling, right?</p>
<p>A similar law also describes circular motion.</p>
<p>Because we have bad notation,</p>
<p>we use the residue of how it shows up</p>
<p>in the context of self reinforcing growth,</p>
<p>like a population growing or compound interest.</p>
<p>The constant associated with that</p>
<p>is awkwardly placed into the context</p>
<p>of how rotation comes about,</p>
<p>because they both come from pretty similar equations.</p>
<p>And so what we see is the E and the pi juxtaposed</p>
<p>a little bit closer than they would be</p>
<p>with a purely natural representation, I would think.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I would describe the relation between the two.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a very important function we might call exp.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the exponential function.</p>
<p>When you plug in one,</p>
<p>you get this nice constant called E</p>
<p>that shows up in like probability and calculus.</p>
<p>If you try to move in the imaginary direction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s periodic and the period is tau.</p>
<p>So those are these two constants</p>
<p>associated with the same central function,</p>
<p>but for kind of unrelated reasons, right?</p>
<p>And not unrelated, but like orthogonal reasons.</p>
<p>One of them is what happens</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re moving in the real direction.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s what happens when you move in the imaginary direction.</p>
<p>And like, yeah, those are related.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not as related as the famous equation</p>
<p>seems to think it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of putting all of the children in one bed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d kind of like to sleep in separate beds</p>
<p>if they had the choice, but you see them all there</p>
<p>and there is a family resemblance, but it&rsquo;s not that close.</p>
<p>So actually thinking of it as a function</p>
<p>is the better idea.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a notational idea.</p>
<p>And yeah, and like, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>The constant E sort of stands</p>
<p>as this numerical representative of calculus, right?</p>
<p>Calculus is the like study of change.</p>
<p>So at the very least there&rsquo;s a little cognitive dissonance</p>
<p>using a constant to represent the science of change.</p>
<p>I never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It makes sense why the notation came about that way.</p>
<p>Because this is the first way that we saw it</p>
<p>in the context of things like population growth</p>
<p>or compound interest.</p>
<p>It is nicer to think about as repeated multiplication.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely nicer.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more that that&rsquo;s the first application</p>
<p>of what turned out to be a much more general function</p>
<p>that maybe the intelligent life</p>
<p>your initial question asked about</p>
<p>would have come to recognize as being much more significant</p>
<p>than the single use case,</p>
<p>which lends itself to repeated multiplication notation.</p>
<p>But let me jump back for a second to aliens</p>
<p>and the nature of our universe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you think math is discovered or invented?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about the different kind of mathematics</p>
<p>that could be developed by the alien species.</p>
<p>The implied question is,</p>
<p>yeah, is math discovered or invented?</p>
<p>Is fundamentally everybody going to discover</p>
<p>the same principles of mathematics?</p>
<p>So the way I think about it,</p>
<p>and everyone thinks about it differently,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s my take.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a cycle at play</p>
<p>where you discover things about the universe</p>
<p>that tell you what math will be useful.</p>
<p>And that math itself is invented in a sense,</p>
<p>but of all the possible maths that you could have invented,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s discoveries about the world</p>
<p>that tell you which ones are.</p>
<p>So like a good example here is the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
<p>When you look at this,</p>
<p>do you think of that as a definition</p>
<p>or do you think of that as a discovery?</p>
<p>From the historical perspective, right, it&rsquo;s a discovery</p>
<p>because they were,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably because they were using physical object</p>
<p>to build their intuition.</p>
<p>And from that intuition came the mathematics.</p>
<p>So the mathematics wasn&rsquo;t in some abstract world</p>
<p>detached from physics,</p>
<p>but I think more and more math has become detached from,</p>
<p>you know, when you even look at modern physics</p>
<p>from string theory to even general relativity,</p>
<p>I mean, all math behind the 20th and 21st century physics</p>
<p>kind of takes a brisk walk outside of what our mind</p>
<p>can actually even comprehend</p>
<p>in multiple dimensions, for example,</p>
<p>anything beyond three dimensions, maybe four dimensions.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, higher dimensions</p>
<p>can be highly, highly applicable.</p>
<p>I think this is a common misinterpretation</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re asking questions</p>
<p>about like a five dimensional manifold,</p>
<p>that the only way that that&rsquo;s connected</p>
<p>to the physical world is if the physical world is itself</p>
<p>a five dimensional manifold or includes them.</p>
<p>Well, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling me you can imagine</p>
<p>a five dimensional manifold?</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s not what I said.</p>
<p>I would make the claim that it is useful</p>
<p>to a three dimensional physical universe,</p>
<p>despite itself not being three dimensional.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s useful meaning to even understand</p>
<p>a three dimensional world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be useful to have five dimensional manifolds.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, because of state spaces.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying there in some deep way for us humans,</p>
<p>it does always come back to that three dimensional world</p>
<p>for the usefulness that the dimensional world</p>
<p>and therefore it starts with a discovery,</p>
<p>but then we invent the mathematics</p>
<p>that helps us make sense of the discovery in a sense.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, just to jump off</p>
<p>of the Pythagorean theorem example,</p>
<p>it feels like a discovery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got these beautiful geometric proofs</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got squares and you&rsquo;re modifying the areas,</p>
<p>it feels like a discovery.</p>
<p>If you look at how we formalize the idea of 2D space</p>
<p>as being R2, right, all pairs of real numbers,</p>
<p>and how we define a metric on it and define distance,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, hang on a second,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve defined a distance</p>
<p>so that the Pythagorean theorem is true,</p>
<p>so that suddenly it doesn&rsquo;t feel that great.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s going on is the thing that informed us</p>
<p>what metric to put on R2,</p>
<p>to put on our abstract representation of 2D space,</p>
<p>came from physical observations.</p>
<p>And the thing is, there&rsquo;s other metrics</p>
<p>you could have put on it.</p>
<p>We could have consistent math</p>
<p>with other notions of distance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that those pieces of math</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be applicable to the physical world that we study</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not the ones</p>
<p>where the Pythagorean theorem holds.</p>
<p>So we have a discovery, a genuine bonafide discovery</p>
<p>that informed the invention,</p>
<p>the invention of an abstract representation of 2D space</p>
<p>that we call R2 and things like that.</p>
<p>And then from there,</p>
<p>you just study R2 as an abstract thing</p>
<p>that brings about more ideas and inventions and mysteries</p>
<p>which themselves might yield discoveries.</p>
<p>Those discoveries might give you insight</p>
<p>as to what else would be useful to invent</p>
<p>and it kind of feeds on itself that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think about it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not an either or.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that math is one of these</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s one of the others.</p>
<p>At different times, it&rsquo;s playing a different role.</p>
<p>So then let me ask the Richard Feynman question then,</p>
<p>along that thread,</p>
<p>is what do you think is the difference</p>
<p>between physics and math?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a giant overlap.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of intuition that physicists have</p>
<p>about the world that&rsquo;s perhaps outside of mathematics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this mysterious art that they seem to possess,</p>
<p>we humans generally possess.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the beautiful rigor of mathematics</p>
<p>that allows you to, I mean, just like as we were saying,</p>
<p>invent frameworks of understanding our physical world.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the difference there</p>
<p>and how big is it?</p>
<p>Well, I think of math as being the study</p>
<p>of abstractions over patterns and pure patterns in logic.</p>
<p>And then physics is obviously grounded in a desire</p>
<p>to understand the world that we live in.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna get very different answers</p>
<p>when you talk to different mathematicians</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a wide diversity in types of mathematicians.</p>
<p>There are some who are motivated very much by pure puzzles.</p>
<p>They might be turned on by things like combinatorics.</p>
<p>And they just love the idea of building up</p>
<p>a set of problem solving tools applying to pure patterns.</p>
<p>There are some who are very physically motivated,</p>
<p>who try to invent new math or discover math in veins</p>
<p>that they know will have applications to physics</p>
<p>or sometimes computer science.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what drives them.</p>
<p>Like chaos theory is a good example of something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pure math, that&rsquo;s purely mathematical.</p>
<p>A lot of the statements being made,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s heavily motivated by specific applications</p>
<p>to largely physics.</p>
<p>And then you have a type of mathematician</p>
<p>who just loves abstraction.</p>
<p>They just love pulling it to the more and more abstract</p>
<p>things, the things that feel powerful.</p>
<p>These are the ones that initially invented like topology</p>
<p>and then later on get really into category theory</p>
<p>and go on about like infinite categories and whatnot.</p>
<p>These are the ones that love to have a system</p>
<p>that can describe truths about as many things as possible.</p>
<p>People from those three different veins of motivation</p>
<p>into math are gonna give you very different answers</p>
<p>about what the relation at play here is.</p>
<p>Cause someone like Vladimir Arnold,</p>
<p>who has written a lot of great books,</p>
<p>many about like differential equations and such,</p>
<p>he would say, math is a branch of physics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how he would think about it.</p>
<p>And of course he was studying</p>
<p>like differential equations related things</p>
<p>because that is the motivator behind the study</p>
<p>of PDEs and things like that.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll have others who,</p>
<p>like especially the category theorists</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t really thinking about physics necessarily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about abstraction and the power of generality.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more of a happy coincidence</p>
<p>that that ends up being useful</p>
<p>for understanding the world we live in.</p>
<p>And then you can get into like, why is that the case?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of surprising</p>
<p>that that which is about pure puzzles and abstraction</p>
<p>also happens to describe the very fundamentals</p>
<p>of quarks and everything else.</p>
<p>So why do you think the fundamentals of quarks</p>
<p>and the nature of reality is so compressible</p>
<p>into clean, beautiful equations</p>
<p>that are for the most part simple, relatively speaking,</p>
<p>a lot simpler than they could be?</p>
<p>So you have, we mentioned somebody like Stephen Wolfram</p>
<p>who thinks that sort of there&rsquo;s incredibly simple rules</p>
<p>underlying our reality,</p>
<p>but it can create arbitrary complexity.</p>
<p>But there is simple equations.</p>
<p>What, I&rsquo;m asking a million questions</p>
<p>that nobody knows the answer to, but.</p>
<p>I have no idea, why is it simple?</p>
<p>It could be the case that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a filter iteration at play.</p>
<p>The only things that physicists find interesting</p>
<p>are the ones that are simple enough</p>
<p>they could describe it mathematically.</p>
<p>But as soon as it&rsquo;s a sufficiently complex system,</p>
<p>like, oh, that&rsquo;s outside the realm of physics,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s biology or whatever have you.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>of course there will always be something that is simple</p>
<p>when you wash away the like non important parts</p>
<p>of whatever it is that you&rsquo;re studying.</p>
<p>Just from like an information theory standpoint,</p>
<p>there might be some like,</p>
<p>you get to the lowest information component of it.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, maybe I&rsquo;m just having</p>
<p>a really hard time conceiving of what it would even mean</p>
<p>for the fundamental laws to be like intrinsically</p>
<p>complicated, like some set of equations</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t decouple from each other.</p>
<p>Well, no, it could be that sort of we take for granted</p>
<p>that the laws of physics, for example,</p>
<p>are for the most part the same everywhere</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>As opposed to the sort of an alternative could be</p>
<p>that the rules under which the world operates</p>
<p>is different everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a deeply distributed system</p>
<p>where just everything is just chaos,</p>
<p>not in a strict definition of chaos,</p>
<p>but meaning like just it&rsquo;s impossible for equations</p>
<p>to capture, for to explicitly model the world</p>
<p>as cleanly as the physical does.</p>
<p>I mean, we almost take it for granted that we can describe,</p>
<p>we can have an equation for gravity,</p>
<p>for action at a distance.</p>
<p>We can have equations for some of these basic ways</p>
<p>the planet&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>Just the low level at the atomic scale,</p>
<p>how the materials operate,</p>
<p>at the high scale, how black holes operate.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t, it seems like it could be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s infinite other possibilities</p>
<p>where none of it could be compressible into such equations.</p>
<p>So it just seems beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also weird, probably to the point you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very pleasant that this is true for our minds.</p>
<p>So it might be that our minds are biased</p>
<p>to just be looking at the parts of the universe</p>
<p>that are compressible.</p>
<p>And then we can publish papers on</p>
<p>and have nice E equals empty squared equations.</p>
<p>Right, well, I wonder would such a world</p>
<p>with uncompressible laws allow for the kind of beings</p>
<p>that can think about the kind of questions</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re asking?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Right, like an anthropic principle coming into play</p>
<p>in some weird way here?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about at all.</p>
<p>Maybe the universe is actually not so compressible,</p>
<p>but the way our brain, the way our brain evolved</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only able to perceive the compressible parts.</p>
<p>I mean, we are, so this is the sort of Chomsky argument.</p>
<p>We are just descendants of apes</p>
<p>over like really limited biological systems.</p>
<p>So it totally makes sense</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really limited little computers, calculators,</p>
<p>that are able to perceive certain kinds of things</p>
<p>and the actual world is much more complicated.</p>
<p>Well, but we can do pretty awesome things, right?</p>
<p>Like we can fly spaceships</p>
<p>and we have to have some connection of reality</p>
<p>to be able to take our potentially oversimplified models</p>
<p>of the world, but then actually twist the world</p>
<p>to our will based on it.</p>
<p>So we have certain reality checks</p>
<p>that like physics isn&rsquo;t too far a field</p>
<p>simply based on what we can do.</p>
<p>Yeah, the fact that we can fly is pretty good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, yeah, like it&rsquo;s a proof of concept</p>
<p>that the laws we&rsquo;re working with are working well.</p>
<p>So I mentioned to the internet that I&rsquo;m talking to you</p>
<p>and so the internet gave some questions.</p>
<p>So I apologize for these,</p>
<p>but do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation</p>
<p>that the universe is a computer</p>
<p>or the universe is a computation running on a computer?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceivable.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t buy is, you know, you&rsquo;ll have the argument</p>
<p>that, well, let&rsquo;s say that it was the case</p>
<p>that you can have simulations.</p>
<p>Then the simulated world would itself</p>
<p>eventually get to a point where it&rsquo;s running simulations.</p>
<p>And then the second layer down</p>
<p>would create a third layer down and on and on and on.</p>
<p>So probabilistically, you just throw a dart</p>
<p>at one of those layers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably in one of the simulated layers.</p>
<p>I think if there&rsquo;s some sort of limitations</p>
<p>on like the information processing</p>
<p>of whatever the physical world is,</p>
<p>like it quickly becomes the case</p>
<p>that you have a limit to the layers that could exist there</p>
<p>because like the resources necessary</p>
<p>to simulate a universe like ours clearly is a lot</p>
<p>just in terms of the number of bits at play.</p>
<p>And so then you can ask, well, what&rsquo;s more plausible?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s an unbounded capacity</p>
<p>of information processing</p>
<p>in whatever the like highest up level universe is,</p>
<p>or that there&rsquo;s some bound to that capacity,</p>
<p>which then limits like the number of levels available.</p>
<p>How do you play some kind of probability distribution</p>
<p>on like what the information capacity is?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, like people almost assume</p>
<p>a certain uniform probability</p>
<p>over all of those meta layers that could conceivably exist</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s a little bit like a Pascal&rsquo;s wager</p>
<p>on like you&rsquo;re not giving a low enough prior</p>
<p>to the mere existence of that infinite set of layers.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also very difficult to contextualize the amount.</p>
<p>So the amount of information processing power</p>
<p>required to simulate like our universe</p>
<p>seems like amazingly huge.</p>
<p>But you can always raise two to the power of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, like numbers get big.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re easily humbled</p>
<p>by basically everything around us.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very difficult to kind of make sense of anything</p>
<p>actually when you look up at the sky</p>
<p>and look at the stars and the immensity of it all,</p>
<p>to make sense of the smallness of us,</p>
<p>the unlikeliness of everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on this earth coming to be,</p>
<p>then you could basically anything could be,</p>
<p>all laws of probability go out the window to me</p>
<p>because I guess because the amount of information</p>
<p>under which we&rsquo;re operating is very low.</p>
<p>We basically know nothing about the world around us,</p>
<p>relatively speaking.</p>
<p>And so when I think about the simulation hypothesis,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just fun to think about it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, I think there is a thought experiment</p>
<p>kind of interesting to think of the power of computation,</p>
<p>whether the limits of a Turing machine,</p>
<p>sort of the limits of our current computers,</p>
<p>when you start to think about artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>how far can we get with computers?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of where the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>used with me as a thought experiment</p>
<p>is the universe just a computer?</p>
<p>Is it just a computation?</p>
<p>Is all of this just a computation?</p>
<p>And sort of the same kind of tools we apply</p>
<p>to analyzing algorithms, can that be applied?</p>
<p>If we scale further and further and further,</p>
<p>will the arbitrary power of those systems</p>
<p>start to create some interesting aspects</p>
<p>that we see in our universe?</p>
<p>Or is something fundamentally different</p>
<p>needs to be created?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting that in our universe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not arbitrarily large, the power,</p>
<p>that you can place limits on, for example,</p>
<p>how many bits of information can be stored per unit area.</p>
<p>Right, like all of the physical laws,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got general relativity and quantum coming together</p>
<p>to give you a certain limit on how many bits you can store</p>
<p>within a given range before it collapses into a black hole.</p>
<p>The idea that there even exists such a limit</p>
<p>is at the very least thought provoking,</p>
<p>when naively you might assume,</p>
<p>oh, well, technology could always get better and better,</p>
<p>we could get cleverer and cleverer,</p>
<p>and you could just cram as much information as you want</p>
<p>into like a small unit of space, that makes me think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at least plausible that whatever the highest level</p>
<p>of existence is doesn&rsquo;t admit too many simulations</p>
<p>or ones that are at the scale of complexity</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s just as conceivable that they do</p>
<p>and that there are many, but I guess what I&rsquo;m channeling</p>
<p>is the surprise that I felt upon learning that fact,</p>
<p>that there are, that information is physical in this way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a finiteness to it.</p>
<p>Okay, let me just even go off on that.</p>
<p>From a mathematics perspective</p>
<p>and a psychology perspective, how do you mix,</p>
<p>are you psychologically comfortable</p>
<p>with the concept of infinity?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Are you okay with it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>No, not really, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like how many words,</p>
<p>how many possible words do you think could exist</p>
<p>that are just like strings of letters?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a sort of mathematical statement as beautiful</p>
<p>and we use infinity in basically everything we do,</p>
<p>everything we do in science, math, and engineering, yes.</p>
<p>But you said exist, the question is,</p>
<p>you said letters or words?</p>
<p>I said words. Words.</p>
<p>To bring words into existence to me,</p>
<p>you have to start like saying them or like writing them</p>
<p>or like listing them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an instantiation.</p>
<p>Okay, how many abstract words exist?</p>
<p>Well, the idea of an abstract.</p>
<p>The idea of abstract notions and ideas.</p>
<p>I think we should be clear on terminology.</p>
<p>I mean, you think about intelligence a lot,</p>
<p>like artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Would you not say that what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>is a kind of abstraction?</p>
<p>That like abstraction is key</p>
<p>to conceptualizing the universe?</p>
<p>You get this raw sensory data.</p>
<p>I need something that every time you move your face</p>
<p>a little bit and they&rsquo;re not pixels,</p>
<p>but like analog of pixels on my retina changed entirely,</p>
<p>that I can still have some coherent notion of this is Lex,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to Lex, right?</p>
<p>What that requires is you have a disparate set</p>
<p>of possible images hitting me</p>
<p>that are unified in a notion of Lex, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a kind of abstraction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing that could apply</p>
<p>to a lot of different images that I see</p>
<p>and it represents it in a much more compressed way</p>
<p>and one that&rsquo;s like much more resilient to that.</p>
<p>I think in the same way,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m talking about infinity as an abstraction,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean nonphysical woo woo,</p>
<p>like ineffable or something.</p>
<p>What I mean is it&rsquo;s something that can apply</p>
<p>to a multiplicity of situations</p>
<p>that share a certain common attribute</p>
<p>in the same way that the images of like your face</p>
<p>on my retina share enough common attributes</p>
<p>that I can put the single notion to it.</p>
<p>Like in that way, infinity is an abstraction</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very powerful and it&rsquo;s only through</p>
<p>such abstractions that we can actually understand</p>
<p>like the world and logic and things.</p>
<p>And in the case of infinity,</p>
<p>the way I think about it,</p>
<p>the key entity is the property</p>
<p>of always being able to add one more.</p>
<p>Like no matter how many words you can list,</p>
<p>you just throw an A at the end of one</p>
<p>and you have another conceivable word.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to think of all the words at once.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that property, the oh, I could always add one more</p>
<p>that gives it this nature of infiniteness</p>
<p>in the same way that there&rsquo;s certain like properties</p>
<p>of your face that give it the Lexness, right?</p>
<p>So like infinity should be no more worrying</p>
<p>than the I can always add one more sentiment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really elegant,</p>
<p>much more elegant way than I could put it.</p>
<p>So thank you for doing that as yet another abstraction.</p>
<p>And yes, indeed, that&rsquo;s what our brain does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what intelligent systems do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what programming does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what science does is build abstraction</p>
<p>on top of each other.</p>
<p>And yet there is at a certain point abstractions</p>
<p>that go into the quote woo, right?</p>
<p>Sort of, and because we&rsquo;re now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we built this stack of, you know,</p>
<p>the only thing that&rsquo;s true is the stuff that&rsquo;s on the ground.</p>
<p>Everything else is useful for interpreting this.</p>
<p>And at a certain point you might start floating</p>
<p>into ideas that are surreal and difficult</p>
<p>and take us into areas that are disconnected</p>
<p>from reality in a way that we could never get back.</p>
<p>What if instead of calling these abstract,</p>
<p>how different would it be in your mind</p>
<p>if we called them general?</p>
<p>And the phenomenon that you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is overgeneralization.</p>
<p>When you try to have a concept or an idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so general as to apply to nothing in particular</p>
<p>in a useful way, does that map to what you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>of when you think of?</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m playing little just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>Devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>And I think our cognition, our mind is unable</p>
<p>to visualize.</p>
<p>So you do some incredible work with visualization and video.</p>
<p>I think infinity is very difficult to visualize</p>
<p>for our mind.</p>
<p>We can delude ourselves into thinking we can visualize it,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I would venture to say it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some concepts of mathematics,</p>
<p>like maybe multiple dimensions,</p>
<p>we could sort of talk about that are impossible</p>
<p>for us to truly intuit, like,</p>
<p>and it just feels dangerous to me to use these</p>
<p>as part of our toolbox of abstractions.</p>
<p>On behalf of your listeners,</p>
<p>I almost fear we&rsquo;re getting too philosophical.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Heck no.</p>
<p>I think to that point for any particular idea like this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s multiple angles of attack.</p>
<p>I think the, when we do visualize infinity,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re actually doing, you know,</p>
<p>you write dot, dot, dot, right?</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, dot, dot, dot, right?</p>
<p>Those are symbols on the page</p>
<p>that are insinuating a certain infinity.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re capturing with a little bit of design there</p>
<p>is the I can always add one more property, right?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m just as uncomfortable with you are</p>
<p>if you try to concretize it so much</p>
<p>that you have a bag of infinitely many things</p>
<p>that I actually think of, no, not one, two, three, four,</p>
<p>dot, dot, dot, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.</p>
<p>I try to get them all in my head and you realize,</p>
<p>oh, you know, your brain would literally collapse</p>
<p>into a black hole, all of that.</p>
<p>And I honestly feel this with a lot of math</p>
<p>that I try to read where I don&rsquo;t think of myself</p>
<p>as like particularly good at math in some ways.</p>
<p>Like I get very confused often</p>
<p>when I am going through some of these texts.</p>
<p>And often what I&rsquo;m feeling in my head is like,</p>
<p>this is just so damn abstract.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>I just want to put something concrete to it</p>
<p>that makes me understand.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the motivation for the channel</p>
<p>is channeling that sentiment of, yeah,</p>
<p>a lot of the things that you&rsquo;re trying to read out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so hard to connect to anything</p>
<p>that you spend an hour banging your head</p>
<p>against a couple of pages and you come out</p>
<p>not really knowing anything more</p>
<p>other than some definitions maybe</p>
<p>and a certain sense of self defeat, right?</p>
<p>One of the reasons I focus so much on visualizations</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m a big believer in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m just really hampering on</p>
<p>this idea of abstraction,</p>
<p>being clear about your layers of abstraction, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always tempting to start an explanation</p>
<p>from the top to the bottom, okay?</p>
<p>You give the definition of a new theorem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, this is the definition of a vector space.</p>
<p>For example, that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll start a course.</p>
<p>These are the properties of a vector space.</p>
<p>First from these properties, we will derive what we need</p>
<p>in order to do the math of linear algebra</p>
<p>or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how understanding works at all.</p>
<p>I think how understanding works</p>
<p>is you start at the lowest level you can get at</p>
<p>where rather than thinking about a vector space,</p>
<p>you might think of concrete vectors</p>
<p>that are just lists of numbers</p>
<p>or picturing it as like an arrow that you draw,</p>
<p>which is itself like even less abstract than numbers</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re looking at quantities,</p>
<p>like the distance of the x coordinate,</p>
<p>the distance of the y coordinate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as concrete as you could possibly get</p>
<p>and it has to be if you&rsquo;re putting it in a visual, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an actual arrow. It&rsquo;s an actual vector.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not talking about like a quote unquote vector</p>
<p>that could apply to any possible thing.</p>
<p>You have to choose one if you&rsquo;re illustrating it.</p>
<p>And I think this is the power of being in a medium</p>
<p>like video or if you&rsquo;re writing a textbook</p>
<p>and you force yourself to put a lot of images</p>
<p>is with every image, you&rsquo;re making a choice.</p>
<p>With each choice, you&rsquo;re showing a concrete example.</p>
<p>With each concrete example,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re aiding someone&rsquo;s path to understanding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt you,</p>
<p>but you just made me realize that that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So the visualizations you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re sometimes talking about abstractions,</p>
<p>the actual visualization is an explicit low level example.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an actual, like in the code,</p>
<p>you have to say what the vector is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the direction of the arrow,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the magnitude of the, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re going, the visualization itself</p>
<p>is actually going to the bottom of that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>I also think about this a lot in writing scripts</p>
<p>where even before you get to the visuals,</p>
<p>the first instinct is to, I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>I just always do, I say the abstract thing,</p>
<p>I say the general definition, the powerful thing,</p>
<p>and then I fill it in with examples later.</p>
<p>Always, it will be more compelling</p>
<p>and easier to understand when you flip that.</p>
<p>And instead, you let someone&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>do the pattern recognition.</p>
<p>You just show them a bunch of examples.</p>
<p>The brain is gonna feel a certain similarity between them.</p>
<p>Then by the time you bring in the definition,</p>
<p>or by the time you bring in the formula,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s articulating a thing that&rsquo;s already in the brain</p>
<p>that was built off of looking at a bunch of examples</p>
<p>with a certain kind of similarity.</p>
<p>And what the formula does is articulate</p>
<p>what that kind of similarity is,</p>
<p>rather than being a high cognitive load set of symbols</p>
<p>that needs to be populated with examples later on,</p>
<p>assuming someone&rsquo;s still with you.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful or awe inspiring idea</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve come across in mathematics?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s an idea you&rsquo;ve explored in your videos,</p>
<p>maybe not.</p>
<p>What just gave you pause?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most beautiful idea?</p>
<p>Small or big.</p>
<p>So I think often, the things that are most beautiful</p>
<p>are the ones that you have a little bit of understanding of,</p>
<p>but certainly not an entire understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of that mystery</p>
<p>that is what makes it beautiful.</p>
<p>What was the moment of the discovery for you personally,</p>
<p>almost just that leap of aha moment?</p>
<p>So something that really caught my eye,</p>
<p>I remember when I was little, there were these,</p>
<p>I think the series was called like wooden books</p>
<p>or something, these tiny little books</p>
<p>that would have just a very short description</p>
<p>of something on the left and then a picture on the right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who they&rsquo;re meant for,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s like loosely children</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t just be children,</p>
<p>because of some of the things I was describing.</p>
<p>On the last page of one of them,</p>
<p>somewhere tiny in there was this little formula</p>
<p>that on the left hand had a sum</p>
<p>over all of the natural numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one over one to the S plus one over two to the S</p>
<p>plus one over three to the S on and on to the infinity.</p>
<p>Then on the other side had a product over all of the primes</p>
<p>and it was a certain thing had to do with all the primes.</p>
<p>And like any good young math enthusiast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably been indoctrinated with how chaotic</p>
<p>and confusing the primes are, which they are.</p>
<p>And seeing this equation where on one side</p>
<p>you have something that&rsquo;s as understandable</p>
<p>as you could possibly get, the counting numbers.</p>
<p>And on the other side is all the prime numbers.</p>
<p>It was like this, whoa, they&rsquo;re related like this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a simple description that includes</p>
<p>all the primes getting wrapped together like this.</p>
<p>This is like the Euler product for the Zeta function,</p>
<p>as I like later found out.</p>
<p>The equation itself essentially encodes</p>
<p>the fundamental theorem of arithmetic</p>
<p>that every number can be expressed</p>
<p>as a unique set of primes.</p>
<p>To me still there&rsquo;s, I mean, I certainly don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>this equation or this function all that well.</p>
<p>The more I learn about it, the prettier it is.</p>
<p>The idea that you can, this is sort of what gets you</p>
<p>representations of primes, not in terms of primes themselves,</p>
<p>but in terms of another set of numbers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like the non trivial zeros of the Zeta function.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m very kind of in over my head</p>
<p>in a lot of ways as I like try to get to understand it.</p>
<p>But the more I do, it always leaves enough mystery</p>
<p>that it remains very beautiful to me.</p>
<p>So whenever there&rsquo;s a little bit of mystery</p>
<p>just outside of the understanding that,</p>
<p>and by the way, the process of learning more about it,</p>
<p>how does that come about?</p>
<p>Just your own thought or are you reading?</p>
<p>Reading, yeah.</p>
<p>Or is the process of visualization itself</p>
<p>revealing more to you?</p>
<p>Visuals help.</p>
<p>I mean, in one time when I was just trying to understand</p>
<p>like analytic continuation and playing around</p>
<p>with visualizing complex functions,</p>
<p>this is what led to a video about this function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s titled something like</p>
<p>Visualizing the Riemann Zeta Function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that came about because I was programming</p>
<p>and tried to see what a certain thing looked like.</p>
<p>And then I looked at it and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>whoa, that&rsquo;s elucidating.</p>
<p>And then I decided to make a video about it.</p>
<p>But I mean, you try to get your hands on</p>
<p>as much reading as you can.</p>
<p>You know, in this case, I think if anyone wants to start</p>
<p>to understand it, if they have like a math background</p>
<p>like they studied some in college or something like that,</p>
<p>like the Princeton Companion to Math</p>
<p>has a really good article on analytic number theory.</p>
<p>And that itself has a whole bunch of references</p>
<p>and you know, anything has more references</p>
<p>and it gives you this like tree to start piling through.</p>
<p>And like, you know, you try to understand,</p>
<p>I try to understand things visually as I go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not always possible,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very helpful when it does.</p>
<p>You recognize when there&rsquo;s common themes,</p>
<p>like in this case, Cousins of the Fourier Transform</p>
<p>that come into play and you realize,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s probably pretty important</p>
<p>to have deep intuitions of the Fourier Transform,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not explicitly mentioned in like these texts.</p>
<p>And you try to get a sense of what the common players are.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll emphasize again, like,</p>
<p>I feel very in over my head when I try to understand</p>
<p>the exact relation between like the zeros</p>
<p>of the Riemann Zeta function</p>
<p>and how they relate to the distribution of primes.</p>
<p>I definitely understand it better than I did a year ago.</p>
<p>I definitely understand it on 100th as well as the experts</p>
<p>on the matter do, I assume.</p>
<p>But the slow path towards getting there is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s charming,</p>
<p>and like to your question, very beautiful.</p>
<p>And the beauty is in the, what,</p>
<p>in the journey versus the destination?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s that each thing doesn&rsquo;t feel arbitrary.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big part,</p>
<p>is that you have these unpredictable,</p>
<p>no, yeah, these very unpredictable patterns</p>
<p>or these intricate properties of like a certain function.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel like humans ever made an arbitrary choice</p>
<p>in studying this particular thing.</p>
<p>So, you know, it feels like you&rsquo;re speaking</p>
<p>to patterns themselves or nature itself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big part of it.</p>
<p>I think things that are too arbitrary,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just hard for those to feel beautiful</p>
<p>because this is sort of what the word contrived</p>
<p>is meant to apply to, right?</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re not arbitrary means it could be,</p>
<p>you can have a clean abstraction and intuition</p>
<p>that allows you to comprehend it.</p>
<p>Well, to one of your first questions,</p>
<p>it makes you feel like if you came across</p>
<p>another intelligent civilization,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d be studying the same thing.</p>
<p>Maybe with different notation.</p>
<p>Certainly, yeah, but yeah.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>I think you talked to that other civilization,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably also studying the zeros</p>
<p>of the Riemann Zeta function</p>
<p>or like some variant thereof</p>
<p>that is like a clearly equivalent cousin</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s probably on their docket.</p>
<p>Whenever somebody does a lot of something amazing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask the question</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve already been asked a lot</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ll get more and more asked in your life.</p>
<p>But what was your favorite video to create?</p>
<p>Oh, favorite to create.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is,</p>
<p>the title is Who Cares About Topology?</p>
<p>You want me to pull it up or no?</p>
<p>If you want, sure, yeah.</p>
<p>It is about, well, it starts by describing</p>
<p>an unsolved problem that&rsquo;s still unsolved in math</p>
<p>called the inscribed square problem.</p>
<p>You draw any loop and then you ask,</p>
<p>are there four points on that loop that make a square?</p>
<p>Totally useless, right?</p>
<p>This is not answering any physical questions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly interesting that we can&rsquo;t answer that question.</p>
<p>And it seems like such a natural thing to ask.</p>
<p>Now, if you weaken it a little bit and you ask,</p>
<p>can you always find a rectangle?</p>
<p>You choose four points on this curve,</p>
<p>can you find a rectangle?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard, but it&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>And the path to it involves things like looking at a torus,</p>
<p>this surface with a single hole in it, like a donut,</p>
<p>or looking at a mobius strip.</p>
<p>In ways that feel so much less contrived</p>
<p>to when I first, as like a little kid,</p>
<p>learned about these surfaces and shapes,</p>
<p>like a mobius strip and a torus.</p>
<p>Like what you learn is, oh, this mobius strip,</p>
<p>you take a piece of paper, put a twist, glue it together,</p>
<p>and now you have a shape with one edge and just one side.</p>
<p>And as a student, you should think, who cares, right?</p>
<p>Like, how does that help me solve any problems?</p>
<p>I thought math was about problem solving.</p>
<p>So what I liked about the piece of math</p>
<p>that this was describing that was in this paper</p>
<p>by a mathematician named Vaughn</p>
<p>was that it arises very naturally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear what it represents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just playing with construction paper.</p>
<p>And the way that it solves the problem is really beautiful.</p>
<p>So kind of putting all of that down</p>
<p>and concretizing it, right?</p>
<p>Like I was talking about how</p>
<p>when you have to put visuals to it,</p>
<p>it demands that what&rsquo;s on screen</p>
<p>is a very specific example of what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>The construction here is very abstract in nature.</p>
<p>You describe this very abstract kind of surface in 3D space.</p>
<p>So then when I was finding myself,</p>
<p>in this case, I wasn&rsquo;t programming,</p>
<p>I was using a grapher that&rsquo;s like built into OSX</p>
<p>for the 3D stuff to draw that surface,</p>
<p>you realize, oh man, the topology argument</p>
<p>is very non constructive.</p>
<p>I have to make a lot of,</p>
<p>you have to do a lot of extra work</p>
<p>in order to make the surface show up.</p>
<p>But then once you see it, it&rsquo;s quite pretty</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very satisfying to see a specific instance of it.</p>
<p>And you also feel like, ah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually added something</p>
<p>on top of what the original paper was doing</p>
<p>that it shows something that&rsquo;s completely correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very beautiful argument,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t see what it looks like.</p>
<p>And I found something satisfying</p>
<p>in seeing what it looked like</p>
<p>that could only ever have come about</p>
<p>from the forcing function</p>
<p>of getting some kind of image on the screen</p>
<p>to describe the thing I was talking about.</p>
<p>So you almost weren&rsquo;t able to anticipate</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s gonna look like.</p>
<p>I had no idea.</p>
<p>And it was wonderful, right?</p>
<p>It was totally, it looks like a Sydney Opera House</p>
<p>or some sort of Frank Gehry design.</p>
<p>And it was, you knew it was gonna be something</p>
<p>and you can say various things about it.</p>
<p>Like, oh, it touches the curve itself.</p>
<p>It has a boundary that&rsquo;s this curve on the 2D plane.</p>
<p>It all sits above the plane.</p>
<p>But before you actually draw it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unclear what the thing will look like.</p>
<p>And to see it, it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s just pleasing, right?</p>
<p>So that was fun to make, very fun to share.</p>
<p>I hope that it has elucidated for some people out there</p>
<p>where these constructs of topology come from,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not arbitrary play with construction paper.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, I think this is a good sort of example</p>
<p>to talk a little bit about your process.</p>
<p>You have a list of ideas.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of the curse of having an active</p>
<p>and brilliant mind is I&rsquo;m sure you have a list</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s growing faster than you can utilize.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m ahead, absolutely.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some sorting procedure</p>
<p>depending on mood and interest and so on.</p>
<p>But okay, so you pick an idea</p>
<p>and then you have to try to write a narrative arc</p>
<p>that sort of, how do I elucidate?</p>
<p>How do I make this idea beautiful and clear</p>
<p>and explain it?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a set of visualizations</p>
<p>that will be attached to it.</p>
<p>Sort of, you&rsquo;ve talked about some of this before,</p>
<p>but sort of writing the story, attaching the visualizations.</p>
<p>Can you talk through interesting, painful,</p>
<p>beautiful parts of that process?</p>
<p>Well, the most painful is if you&rsquo;ve chosen a topic</p>
<p>that you do want to do, but then it&rsquo;s hard to think of,</p>
<p>I guess how to structure the script.</p>
<p>This is sort of where I have been on one</p>
<p>for like the last two or three months.</p>
<p>And I think that ultimately the right resolution</p>
<p>is just like set it aside and instead do some other things</p>
<p>where the script comes more naturally.</p>
<p>Because you sort of don&rsquo;t want to overwork a narrative.</p>
<p>The more you&rsquo;ve thought about it,</p>
<p>the less you can empathize with the student</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t yet understand the thing you&rsquo;re trying to teach.</p>
<p>Who is the judger in your head?</p>
<p>Sort of the person, the creature,</p>
<p>the essence that&rsquo;s saying this sucks or this is good.</p>
<p>And you mentioned kind of the student you&rsquo;re thinking about.</p>
<p>Can you, who is that?</p>
<p>What is that thing?</p>
<p>That says, the perfectionist that says this thing sucks.</p>
<p>You need to work on that for another two, three months.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s my past self.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the entity that I&rsquo;m most trying</p>
<p>to empathize with is like you take who I was,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s kind of the only person I know.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t really know anyone</p>
<p>other than versions of yourself.</p>
<p>So I start with the version of myself that I know</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t yet understand the thing, right?</p>
<p>And then I just try to view it with fresh eyes,</p>
<p>a particular visual or a particular script.</p>
<p>Like, is this motivating?</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p>
<p>Which has its downsides,</p>
<p>because sometimes I find myself speaking to motivations</p>
<p>that only myself would be interested in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like I did this project on quaternions</p>
<p>where what I really wanted was to understand</p>
<p>what are they doing in four dimensions?</p>
<p>Can we see what they&rsquo;re doing in four dimensions, right?</p>
<p>And I came up with a way of thinking about it</p>
<p>that really answered the question in my head</p>
<p>that made me very satisfied</p>
<p>and being able to think about concretely with a 3D visual,</p>
<p>what are they doing to a 4D sphere?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like, great,</p>
<p>this is exactly what my past self would have wanted, right?</p>
<p>And I make a thing on it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s what some other people wanted too.</p>
<p>But in hindsight, I think most people who wanna learn</p>
<p>about quaternions are like robotics engineers</p>
<p>or graphics programmers who want to understand</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re used to describe 3D rotations.</p>
<p>And like their use case was actually a little bit different</p>
<p>than my past self.</p>
<p>And in that way, like,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t actually recommend that video</p>
<p>to people who are coming at it from that angle</p>
<p>of wanting to know, hey, I&rsquo;m a robotics programmer.</p>
<p>Like, how do these quaternion things work</p>
<p>to describe position in 3D space?</p>
<p>I would say other great resources for that.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself wanting to say like,</p>
<p>but hang on,</p>
<p>in what sense are they acting in four dimensions?</p>
<p>Then come back.</p>
<p>But until then, that&rsquo;s a little different.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because you have incredible videos on neural networks,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>And from my sort of perspective,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve probably, I mean,</p>
<p>I looked at the,</p>
<p>is sort of my field</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve also looked at the basic introduction</p>
<p>of neural networks like a million times</p>
<p>from different perspectives.</p>
<p>And it made me realize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to present it.</p>
<p>So you were sort of, you did an incredible job.</p>
<p>I mean, sort of the,</p>
<p>but you could also do it differently</p>
<p>and also incredible.</p>
<p>Like to create a beautiful presentation of a basic concept</p>
<p>requires sort of creativity, requires genius and so on,</p>
<p>but you can take it from a bunch of different perspectives.</p>
<p>And that video on neural networks made me realize that.</p>
<p>And just as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>you kind of have a certain mindset, a certain view,</p>
<p>but from a, if you take a different view</p>
<p>from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>from a neuroscience perspective,</p>
<p>talking about neural networks</p>
<p>or from a robotics perspective,</p>
<p>or from, let&rsquo;s see,</p>
<p>from a pure learning, statistics perspective.</p>
<p>So you can create totally different videos.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve done that with a few actually concepts</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve have taken different cuts,</p>
<p>like at the Euler equation, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taken different views of that.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve made three videos on it</p>
<p>and I definitely will make at least one more.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Never enough.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the most beautiful equation</p>
<p>in mathematics?</p>
<p>Like I said, as we represent it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the most hideous.</p>
<p>It involves a lot of the most hideous aspects</p>
<p>of our notation.</p>
<p>I talked about E, the fact that we use pi instead of tau,</p>
<p>the fact that we call imaginary numbers imaginary,</p>
<p>and then, hence, I actually wonder if we use the I</p>
<p>because of imaginary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s historically accurate,</p>
<p>but at least a lot of people,</p>
<p>they read the I and they think imaginary.</p>
<p>Like all three of those facts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like those are things that have added more confusion</p>
<p>than they needed to,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re wrapping them up in one equation.</p>
<p>Like boy, that&rsquo;s just very hideous, right?</p>
<p>The idea is that it does tie together</p>
<p>when you wash away the notation.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s pretty, it&rsquo;s nice,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like mind blowing greatest thing</p>
<p>in the universe,</p>
<p>which is maybe what I was thinking of when I said,</p>
<p>like once you understand something,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have the same beauty.</p>
<p>Like I feel like I understand Euler&rsquo;s formula,</p>
<p>and I feel like I understand it enough</p>
<p>to sort of see the version that just woke up</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t really gotten itself dressed in the morning</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit groggy,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s bags under its eyes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re past the dating stage,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re no longer dating, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still dating the Zeta function,</p>
<p>and like she&rsquo;s beautiful and right,</p>
<p>and like we have fun,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that high dopamine part,</p>
<p>but like maybe at some point</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll settle into the more mundane nature of the relationship</p>
<p>where I like see her for who she truly is,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll still be beautiful in her own way,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t have the same romantic pizzazz, right?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the nice thing about mathematics.</p>
<p>I think as long as you don&rsquo;t live forever,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll always be enough mystery and fun</p>
<p>with some of the equations.</p>
<p>Even if you do, the rate at which questions comes up</p>
<p>is much faster than the rate at which answers come up, so.</p>
<p>If you could live forever, would you?</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>So you think, you don&rsquo;t think mortality</p>
<p>is the thing that makes life meaningful?</p>
<p>Would your life be four times as meaningful</p>
<p>if you died at 25?</p>
<p>So this goes to infinity.</p>
<p>I think you and I, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So what I said is infinite, not four times longer.</p>
<p>I said infinite.</p>
<p>So the actual existence of the finiteness,</p>
<p>the existence of the end, no matter the length,</p>
<p>is the thing that may sort of,</p>
<p>from my comprehension of psychology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a deeply human,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a fundamental part of the human condition,</p>
<p>the fact that there is, that we&rsquo;re mortal,</p>
<p>that the fact that things end,</p>
<p>it seems to be a crucial part of what gives them meaning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, at least for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very small percentage of my time</p>
<p>that mortality is salient,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of the end of my life.</p>
<p>What do you mean by me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trolling.</p>
<p>Is it the ego, is it the id, or is it the superego?</p>
<p>The reflective self, the Wernicke&rsquo;s area</p>
<p>that puts all this stuff into words.</p>
<p>Yeah, a small percentage of your mind</p>
<p>that is actually aware of the true motivations</p>
<p>that drive you.</p>
<p>But my point is that most of my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about death,</p>
<p>but I still feel very motivated to make things</p>
<p>and to interact with people,</p>
<p>experience love or things like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very motivated,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s strange that that motivation comes</p>
<p>while death is not in my mind at all.</p>
<p>And this might just be because I&rsquo;m young enough</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not salient.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s in your subconscious,</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;ve constructed an illusion</p>
<p>that allows you to escape the fact of your mortality</p>
<p>by enjoying the moment,</p>
<p>sort of the existential approach to life.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>Gun to my head, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yeah, another sort of way to say gun to the head</p>
<p>is sort of the deep psychological introspection</p>
<p>of what drives us.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, in some ways to me,</p>
<p>I mean, when I look at math, when I look at science,</p>
<p>is a kind of an escape from reality</p>
<p>in a sense that it&rsquo;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a beautiful journey of discovery</p>
<p>that it allows you to actually,</p>
<p>it sort of allows you to achieve a kind of immortality</p>
<p>of explore ideas and sort of connect yourself</p>
<p>to the thing that is seemingly infinite,</p>
<p>like the universe, right?</p>
<p>That allows you to escape the limited nature</p>
<p>of our little, of our bodies, of our existence.</p>
<p>What else would give this podcast meaning?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If not the fact that it will end.</p>
<p>This place closes in 40 minutes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so much more meaningful for it.</p>
<p>How much more I love this room</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll be kicked out.</p>
<p>So I understand just because you&rsquo;re trolling me</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>But I take your point.</p>
<p>I take your point.</p>
<p>Boy, that would be a good Twitter bio.</p>
<p>Just because you&rsquo;re trolling me doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, and sort of difference in backgrounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit Russian, so we&rsquo;re a bit melancholic</p>
<p>and seem to maybe assign a little too much value</p>
<p>to suffering and mortality and things like that.</p>
<p>Makes for a better novel, I think.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you need some sort of existential threat</p>
<p>to drive a plot.</p>
<p>So when do you know when the video is done</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re working on it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty easy actually,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll write the script.</p>
<p>I want there to be some kind of aha moment in there.</p>
<p>And then hopefully the script can revolve around</p>
<p>some kind of aha moment.</p>
<p>And then from there, you&rsquo;re putting visuals</p>
<p>to each sentence that exists,</p>
<p>and then you narrate it, you edit it all together.</p>
<p>So given that there&rsquo;s a script,</p>
<p>the end becomes quite clear.</p>
<p>And as I animate it, I often change</p>
<p>certainly the specific words,</p>
<p>but sometimes the structure itself.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very deterministic process at that point.</p>
<p>It makes it much easier to predict</p>
<p>when something will be done.</p>
<p>How do you know when a script is done?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, for problem solving videos,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quite simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s once you feel like someone</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t understand the solution now could.</p>
<p>For things like neural networks,</p>
<p>that was a lot harder because like you said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many angles at which you could attack it.</p>
<p>And there, it&rsquo;s just at some point</p>
<p>you feel like this asks a meaningful question</p>
<p>and it answers that question, right?</p>
<p>What is the best way to learn math</p>
<p>for people who might be at the beginning of that journey?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a question that a lot of folks</p>
<p>kind of ask and think about.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t, even for folks</p>
<p>who are not really at the beginning of their journey,</p>
<p>like there might be actually deep in their career,</p>
<p>some type they&rsquo;ve taken college</p>
<p>or taken calculus and so on,</p>
<p>but still wanna sort of explore math.</p>
<p>What would be your advice instead of education at all ages?</p>
<p>Your temptation will be to spend more time</p>
<p>like watching lectures or reading.</p>
<p>Try to force yourself to do more problems</p>
<p>than you naturally would.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>Like the focus time that you&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>should be on like solving specific problems</p>
<p>and seek entities that have well curated lists of problems.</p>
<p>So go into like a textbook almost</p>
<p>and the problems in the back of a textbook kind of thing,</p>
<p>back of a chapter.</p>
<p>So if you can take a little look through those questions</p>
<p>at the end of the chapter before you read the chapter,</p>
<p>a lot of them won&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Some of them might,</p>
<p>and those are the best ones to think about.</p>
<p>A lot of them won&rsquo;t, but just take a quick look</p>
<p>and then read a little bit of the chapter</p>
<p>and then maybe take a look again and things like that.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t consider yourself done with the chapter</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;ve actually worked through a couple exercises.</p>
<p>And this is so hypocritical, right?</p>
<p>Cause I like put out videos</p>
<p>that pretty much never have associated exercises.</p>
<p>I just view myself as a different part of the ecosystem,</p>
<p>which means I&rsquo;m kind of admitting</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not really learning,</p>
<p>or at least this is only a partial part</p>
<p>of the learning process if you&rsquo;re watching these videos.</p>
<p>I think if someone&rsquo;s at the very beginning,</p>
<p>like I do think Khan Academy does a good job.</p>
<p>They have a pretty large set of questions</p>
<p>you can work through.</p>
<p>Just the very basics,</p>
<p>sort of just picking up,</p>
<p>getting comfortable with the very basic linear algebra,</p>
<p>calculus or so on, Khan Academy.</p>
<p>Programming is actually I think a great,</p>
<p>like learn to program and like let the way</p>
<p>that math is motivated from that angle push you through.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who didn&rsquo;t like math</p>
<p>got into programming in some way</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what turned them on to math.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m biased cause like I live in the Bay area,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m more likely to run into someone</p>
<p>who has that phenotype.</p>
<p>But I am willing to speculate</p>
<p>that that is a more generalizable path.</p>
<p>So you yourself kind of in creating the videos</p>
<p>are using programming to illuminate a concept,</p>
<p>but for yourself as well.</p>
<p>So would you recommend somebody try to make a,</p>
<p>sort of almost like try to make videos?</p>
<p>Like you do as a way to learn?</p>
<p>So one thing I&rsquo;ve heard before,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is based on any actual study.</p>
<p>This might be like a total fictional anecdote of numbers,</p>
<p>but it rings in the mind as being true.</p>
<p>You remember about 10% of what you read,</p>
<p>you remember about 20% of what you listen to,</p>
<p>you remember about 70% of what you actively interact with</p>
<p>in some way, and then about 90% of what you teach.</p>
<p>This is a thing I heard again,</p>
<p>those numbers might be meaningless,</p>
<p>but they ring true, don&rsquo;t they, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to say I learned nine times better</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m teaching something than reading.</p>
<p>That might even be a low ball, right?</p>
<p>So doing something to teach</p>
<p>or to like actively try to explain things</p>
<p>is huge for consolidating the knowledge.</p>
<p>Outside of family and friends,</p>
<p>is there a moment you can remember</p>
<p>that you would like to relive</p>
<p>because it made you truly happy</p>
<p>or it was transformative in some fundamental way?</p>
<p>A moment that was transformative.</p>
<p>Or made you truly happy?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s times,</p>
<p>like music used to be a much bigger part of my life</p>
<p>than it is now, like when I was a, let&rsquo;s say a teenager,</p>
<p>and I can think of some times in like playing music.</p>
<p>There was one, like my brother and a friend of mine,</p>
<p>so this slightly violates the family and friends,</p>
<p>but it was the music that made me happy.</p>
<p>They were just accompanying.</p>
<p>We like played a gig at a ski resort</p>
<p>such that you like take a gondola to the top</p>
<p>and like did a thing.</p>
<p>And then on the gondola ride down,</p>
<p>we decided to just jam a little bit.</p>
<p>And it was just like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the gondola sort of came over a mountain</p>
<p>and you saw the city lights</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just like jamming, like playing some music.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t describe that as transformative.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but that popped into my mind</p>
<p>as a moment of, in a way that wasn&rsquo;t associated</p>
<p>with people I love, but more with like a thing I was doing,</p>
<p>something that was just, it was just happy</p>
<p>and it was just like a great moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can give you anything deeper than that.</p>
<p>Well, as a musician myself, I&rsquo;d love to see,</p>
<p>as you mentioned before, music enter back into your work,</p>
<p>back into your creative work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly allowing it to enter back into mine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing for a mathematician,</p>
<p>for a scientist to allow music to enter their work.</p>
<p>I think only good things can happen.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll try to promise you a music video by 2020.</p>
<p>By 2020?</p>
<p>By the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, good.</p>
<p>Give myself a longer window.</p>
<p>All right, maybe we can like collaborate</p>
<p>on a band type situation.</p>
<p>What instruments do you play?</p>
<p>The main instrument I play is violin,</p>
<p>but I also love to dabble around on like guitar and piano.</p>
<p>Beautiful, me too, guitar and piano.</p>
<p>So in a mathematician&rsquo;s lament, Paul Lockhart writes,</p>
<p>the first thing to understand</p>
<p>is that mathematics is an art.</p>
<p>The difference between math and the other arts,</p>
<p>such as music and painting,</p>
<p>is that our culture does not recognize it as such.</p>
<p>So I think I speak for millions of people, myself included,</p>
<p>in saying thank you for revealing to us</p>
<p>the art of mathematics.</p>
<p>So thank you for everything you do</p>
<p>and thanks for talking today.</p>
<p>Wow, thanks for saying that.</p>
<p>And thanks for having me on.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Grant Sanderson.</p>
<p>And thank you to our presenting sponsor, Cash App.</p>

<p>from one of Grant&rsquo;s and my favorite people, Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>Nobody ever figures out what this life is all about,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Explore the world.</p>
<p>Nearly everything is really interesting</p>
<p>if you go into it deeply enough.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
