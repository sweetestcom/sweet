    <p>The following is a conversation with Vitalik Buterin, co creator of and author of the white</p>
<p>paper that launched Ethereum and Ether, which is a cryptocurrency that is currently the</p>
<p>second largest digital currency after Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Ethereum has a lot of interesting technical ideas that are defining the future of blockchain</p>
<p>technology and Vitalik is one of the most brilliant people innovating in the space today.</p>
<p>Unlike Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown person or group that created Bitcoin, Vitalik is</p>
<p>very well known and at a young age is thrust into the limelight as one of the main faces</p>
<p>of the technology that may redefine the nature of money and all forms of digital transactions</p>
<p>in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the ads, two sponsors, Masterclass and ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Please consider supporting the podcast by signing up to Masterclass at masterclass.com</p>
<p>slash lex and getting ExpressVPN at expressvpn.com slash lexpod.</p>
<p>This show is sponsored by Masterclass sign up at masterclass.com slash lex to get a discount</p>
<p>and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>When I first heard about Masterclass, I honestly thought it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>For $180 a year, you get an all access pass to watch courses from experts at the top of</p>
<p>their field.</p>
<p>To list some of my favorites, Chris Hatfield on space exploration, Neil deGrasse Tyson</p>
<p>on scientific thinking and communication, Will Wright, the creator of SimCity and Sims</p>
<p>on game design, Jane Goodall on conservation, Carlos Santana, one of my favorite guitarists</p>
<p>on guitar, Garry Kasparov on chess, Daniel Negrano on poker, one of my favorite poker</p>
<p>players, Phil Ivey gives a course as well, and many more.</p>
<p>Chris Hatfield explaining how rockets work and the experience of being launched into</p>
<p>space alone is worth the money.</p>
<p>By way of advice, for me, the key is not to be overwhelmed by the abundance of choice.</p>
<p>Pick three courses you want to complete.</p>
<p>Watch each all the way through from start to finish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that long, but it&rsquo;s an experience that will stick with you for a long time,</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easily worth the money.</p>
<p>You can watch it on basically any device.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using ExpressVPN for many years.</p>
<p>I honestly love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to use, press the big power on button, and your privacy is protected.</p>
<p>And if you like, you can make it look like your location is anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>I might be in Boston now, but I can make it look like I&rsquo;m in New York, London, Paris,</p>
<p>or anywhere else.</p>
<p>This has a large number of obvious benefits.</p>
<p>For example, certainly it allows you to access international versions of streaming websites</p>
<p>like the Japanese version of Netflix or the UK version of Hulu.</p>
<p>As you probably know, I was born in the Soviet Union, so sadly, given my roots and appreciation</p>
<p>of Russian history and culture, my website and the website for this podcast is blocked</p>
<p>in Russia.</p>
<p>So this is another example of where you can use ExpressVPN to access sites like the podcast</p>
<p>that are not accessible in your country.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.</p>
<p>I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android, but it&rsquo;s available everywhere else</p>
<p>too.</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Vitalik Buterin.</p>
<p>So before we talk about the fundamental ideas behind Ethereum and cryptocurrency, perhaps</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be nice to talk about the origin story of Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>You gave a talk that started with sort of asking the question, what did Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
<p>actually invent?</p>
<p>Maybe you could say who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what did he invent?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came up with</p>
<p>Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So the reason why I say the name by which we know is that this is an anonymous fellow</p>
<p>who has shown himself to us only over the internet just by first publishing the white</p>
<p>paper for Bitcoin, then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin, and then talking</p>
<p>to the very early Bitcoin community on Bitcoin forums and interacting with them and helping</p>
<p>the project along for a couple of years.</p>
<p>And then at some point in late 2010 to early 2011, he disappeared.</p>
<p>So Bitcoin is a fairly unique project in how it has this kind of mythical, kind of quasi</p>
<p>godlike founder who just kind of popped in, did the thing and then disappeared and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>somehow just never heard from him again.</p>
<p>So in 2008, so the white paper was the first, do you know if the white paper was the first</p>
<p>time the name would actually appear, Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>So how is it possible that the creator of such an impactful project remains anonymous?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no similarity to it in the history of technology as far as I&rsquo;m aware.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So one possibility is that it&rsquo;s hellfinny because hellfinny was kind of also active</p>
<p>in the Bitcoin community and as hellfinny in those two beginning years.</p>
<p>Who is hellfinny, maybe you could say?</p>
<p>He is one of the people in the early cypherpunk community.</p>
<p>He was a computer scientist, cryptographers, people interested in technology, internet</p>
<p>freedom, like those kinds of topics.</p>
<p>Was it correct that I read that he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest</p>
<p>or the first transaction of Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The first transaction of Bitcoin was between Satoshi and hellfinny.</p>
<p>Do you think he knew who Satoshi was?</p>
<p>If he wasn&rsquo;t Satoshi, probably no.</p>
<p>How is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything</p>
<p>about their fundamental identity?</p>
<p>Is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the internet?</p>
<p>Like if we were to think about it, because you and I just met now, there&rsquo;s a depth of</p>
<p>knowledge that we now have about each other that&rsquo;s like physical, like my vision system</p>
<p>is able to recognize you.</p>
<p>I can also verify your identity of uniqueness, like it&rsquo;s very hard to fake you being you.</p>
<p>So the internet has a fundamentally different quality to it, which is just fascinating.</p>
<p>This is definitely interesting as I definitely just know a lot of people just by their internet</p>
<p>handles.</p>
<p>And to me, when I think of them, I see their internet handles and one of them has a kind</p>
<p>of profile picture as this kind of face that&rsquo;s kind of not quite human with a bunch of psychedelic</p>
<p>colors in it.</p>
<p>And when I visualize him, I could just visualize that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an actual face.</p>
<p>You are the creator of the second, well, he&rsquo;s currently the second most popular cryptocurrency</p>
<p>Ethereum.</p>
<p>So on this topic, if we just stick on Satoshi Nakamoto for a little bit longer, you may</p>
<p>be the most qualified person to speak to the psychology of this anonymity that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>Like your identity is known, like I&rsquo;ve just verified it.</p>
<p>But from your perspective, what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining</p>
<p>anonymous?</p>
<p>Like if it can psychoanalyze Satoshi Nakamoto, is there something interesting there?</p>
<p>Or is it just a peculiar quirk of him?</p>
<p>It definitely helps create this kind of image of this kind of neutral thing that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>belong to anyone.</p>
<p>And that you created a project and because you&rsquo;re anonymous and because you also disappear</p>
<p>or as unfortunately happened to Hal Finney, if that is him, he ended up dying of Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disease and he&rsquo;s in the cryogenic freezer now.</p>
<p>But if you pop in and you create it and you&rsquo;re gone and all that&rsquo;s remaining of that whole</p>
<p>process is the thing itself, then no one can go and try to interpret any of your other</p>
<p>behavior and try to understand like, oh, this person wrote this thing in some essay at age</p>
<p>16 where he expressed particular opinions about democracy.</p>
<p>And so because of that, this project is a statement that&rsquo;s trying to do this specific</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Instead, it creates this environment where the thing is what you make of it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the burden of your other ideas, political thought and so on.</p>
<p>So now that we&rsquo;re sitting with you, do you feel the burden of being kind of the face</p>
<p>of Ethereum?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a very large community of developers, but nevertheless, is there like</p>
<p>a burden associated with that?</p>
<p>There definitely is.</p>
<p>This is definitely a big reason why I&rsquo;ve been trying to kind of push for the Ethereum ecosystem</p>
<p>to become more decentralized in many ways, just encouraging a lot of core Ethereum work</p>
<p>to happen outside of the Ethereum Foundation and of expanding the number of people that</p>
<p>are making different kinds of decisions, having multiple software limitations instead of one</p>
<p>and all of these things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that I&rsquo;ve tried to do to remove myself as a single point of failure</p>
<p>because that is something that a lot of people criticize me for.</p>
<p>So if you look at like the most fundamentally successful open source projects, it seems</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like a sad reality when I think about it, is it seems to be that one person</p>
<p>is a crucial contributor often, if you look at Linus for Linux for the kernel.</p>
<p>That is possible and I&rsquo;m definitely not planning to disappear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting tension that projects like this kind of desire a single entity and</p>
<p>yet they&rsquo;re fundamentally distributed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking</p>
<p>about the future of cryptocurrency, does there need to be a leader?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different kinds of leaders.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s dictators who control all the money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who control organizations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s high priests that just have themselves other Twitter followers.</p>
<p>What kind of leader are you, would you say?</p>
<p>These days, actually a bit more in the high priest direction than before.</p>
<p>I definitely actually don&rsquo;t do all that much of going around and ordering Ethereum Foundation</p>
<p>people to do things because I think those things are important.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something that I do think is important, I do just usually kind of say it publicly</p>
<p>or just kind of say it to people and quite often projects just going to start doing it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s ask the high philosophical question about money.</p>
<p>What at the highest level is money?</p>
<p>What is money?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of game and it&rsquo;s a game where we have points and if you have points, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else&rsquo;s points</p>
<p>by the same number.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a fair game, hopefully.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s one kind of fair game.</p>
<p>For example, you can have other kinds of fair games.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have a game where if I give someone a point and you give someone a point</p>
<p>and instead of that person getting two points, that person gets four points and that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>fair.</p>
<p>But, you know, money is easy to kind of set up and it serves a lot of useful functions</p>
<p>and so it kind of just survives in society as a meme for thousands of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful for the storage of wealth, it&rsquo;s useful for the exchange of value.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also useful for denominating future payments, a unit of account.</p>
<p>A unit of account.</p>
<p>So what, if you look at the history of money in human civilization, just if you&rsquo;re a student</p>
<p>of history, how has its role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time in your view?</p>
<p>Even if we just look at the 20th century or before and then leading up to cryptocurrencies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something you think about?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think the big thing in the 20th century is kind of, we saw a lot more intermediation,</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>The first part is kind of the move from adding more of different kinds of banking and then</p>
<p>we saw the move from dollars being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only redeemable by certain people to dollars not being backed by anything to this system</p>
<p>where you have a bunch of free floating currencies and then people getting kind of bank accounts</p>
<p>and then those things becoming electronic, people getting accounts with payment processors</p>
<p>that have bank accounts.</p>
<p>So what do you make of that, that&rsquo;s such a fascinating philosophical idea that money</p>
<p>might not be backed by anything.</p>
<p>Is that like fascinating to you that money can exist without being backed by something</p>
<p>physical?</p>
<p>It definitely is.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>Is that stable?</p>
<p>If we look at the future of human civilization, is it possible to have money at the large</p>
<p>scale at such a hugely productive and rich societies be able to operate successfully</p>
<p>without money being backed by anything physical?</p>
<p>I feel like the interesting thing about the 21st century especially is that a lot of the</p>
<p>important valuable things are not backed by anything.</p>
<p>If you look at tech companies for example, something like Twitter, you could theoretically</p>
<p>imagine that if all of the employees wanted to, they could kind of come together, they</p>
<p>would quit and start working on Twitter 2.0 and then the value of and just kind of build</p>
<p>the exact same product or possibly build a better product and then just kind of continue</p>
<p>on from there and the original Twitter would just not have people left anymore.</p>
<p>There is theoretically kind of code and IP that&rsquo;s owned by the company but in reality</p>
<p>like good programmers could probably rewrite all that stuff in three months.</p>
<p>So the reason why the thing has value is just kind of network effects and coordination problems</p>
<p>right like these employees in reality aren&rsquo;t going to switch all at once and also the users</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t all going to switch at once because it&rsquo;s just difficult for them to switch at</p>
<p>once and so there&rsquo;s these kind of meta stable and of equilibrium in interactions between</p>
<p>thousands of millions of people that are just actually quite sticky even though if you try</p>
<p>to kind of assume that everyone&rsquo;s a perfectly rational and kind of perfectly slippery spherical</p>
<p>cow they don&rsquo;t seem to exist at all.</p>
<p>That stickiness.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense, a grasp of the sort of the fundamental dynamic like the physics of</p>
<p>that stickiness?</p>
<p>It seems to work but and I think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely on it working.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sort of thing that&rsquo;s definitely been economically modeled a lot like one of the</p>
<p>kind of analogy of something as similar that you often see in textbooks as like what is</p>
<p>a government like if for example like 80% of people in a country just like tomorrow</p>
<p>suddenly had the idea that like the laws that are currently the laws of the government that</p>
<p>currently is the government are just people and some other thing is the government and</p>
<p>they just kind of start acting like it then that would kind of become the new reality</p>
<p>and then the question is well what happens if and if between zero and 80% of people start</p>
<p>believing that and like what is the thing you also you see is that if there is one of</p>
<p>these kind of switches happening is kind of revolution then if you&rsquo;re the first person</p>
<p>to join then like you probably don&rsquo;t have the incentive to do that but then if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the 55th percentile person to join then suddenly becomes quite safe too and so it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>is the sort of thing that you can kind of try to analyze and understand mathematically</p>
<p>but one of the kind of results is that the sort of like when the switch happens definitely</p>
<p>can be chaotic sometimes yeah but still like to me the idea that the network affects that</p>
<p>the fact that human beings at a scale like millions billions can share even the idea</p>
<p>of currency like yeah I&rsquo;ll agree that&rsquo;s just uh I know economists can model it I&rsquo;m a skeptic</p>
<p>on the economic and uh it&rsquo;s like uh so my my favorite sort of field maybe recreationally</p>
<p>psychology is trying to understand human behavior and I think sometimes people just kind of</p>
<p>pretend that they can have a grasp on human behavior even though we it&rsquo;s such a messy</p>
<p>space that all the models that psychology or economics those different perspectives</p>
<p>on human behavior can have are are difficult it&rsquo;s difficult to know how much that&rsquo;s wishful</p>
<p>thinking and how much it is actually getting to the core of uh understanding human behavior</p>
<p>but on that idea what do you think is the role of money in human motivation so do you</p>
<p>think money from an economics perspective from a psychology perspective is core to like</p>
<p>human desires money is definitely very far from the only motivator um it is a big motivator</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s uh one of the closest things you have to a universal motivator think because</p>
<p>ultimately in like almost any person in the world if you ask them to do something like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be more inclined to do it if you also offer some uh offer them money right and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh like there&rsquo;s definitely many cases where people will do things other than things that</p>
<p>maximize how much money they have and that happens all the time but like though a lot</p>
<p>of those other things are kind of but much more specific to and of who that person is</p>
<p>and of what their situation is the relationship between the motive and the action and these</p>
<p>other things what do you think is the interplay of the other motivator from like Nietzsche</p>
<p>perspective is power do you think money equals power do you think those are conflicting ideas</p>
<p>do you think i mean that&rsquo;s the one of the ideas that decentralized currency decentralized</p>
<p>applications are looking at is uh who holds the power yeah money is definitely a kind</p>
<p>of power and there&rsquo;s definitely people who want money because it gives them power and</p>
<p>even if my money doesn&rsquo;t seem to and if explicitly be about money a lot of things that people</p>
<p>spend money on are ultimately about a social status of some kind um so i mean i definitely</p>
<p>view those two things as an of interplaying and then there&rsquo;s also money as just a way</p>
<p>of like measuring how successful you are like as a scoreboard right so this kind of gets</p>
<p>back to the game i mean like if you have four billion dollars then the main benefit you</p>
<p>get from going up one of the big benefits you get from going up to six million dollars</p>
<p>is that now instead of being below the guy who has five you&rsquo;re above the guy who has</p>
<p>five so you think money could be kind of uh in the game of life it&rsquo;s also a measure of</p>
<p>self worth it&rsquo;s like how we it&rsquo;s definitely how uh how a lot of people perceive it define</p>
<p>ourselves in the hierarchy of yeah and i&rsquo;m not yeah not saying it&rsquo;s kind of a healthy</p>
<p>thing that people uh define their self worth as money because it&rsquo;s definitely kind of far</p>
<p>from a uh perfect indicator of how much you value you provide the society or anything</p>
<p>like this but i definitely think that like as a matter of kind of current practice so</p>
<p>much of people do feel that way so what does utopia from an economic perspective look like</p>
<p>to you what does the perfect world look like i guess the economist&rsquo;s utopia would be one</p>
<p>where kind of everything is incentive aligned in the in the sense that there aren&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>conflicts between what satisfies your goals and kind of what is uh good for everyone in</p>
<p>the world in the world as a whole what do you think that would um look like does does</p>
<p>that mean there&rsquo;s still poor people and rich people there&rsquo;s still income inequality do</p>
<p>you think sort of uh marxist ideas are strong do you think sort of ideas of uh objectivism</p>
<p>like where the market rules is strong like what is there is the different economic philosophies</p>
<p>that just seem to be reflective what utopia would be so i definitely think that existing</p>
<p>economic philosophies do end up kind of systematically kind of deviating from the utopia in a lot</p>
<p>of ways yeah like one of the big things i talk about for example is public goods right</p>
<p>and public goods are especially important on the internet right because like the idea</p>
<p>is with kind of money as this game where you know i lose a few coin a few coins and you</p>
<p>gain the same number of coins is that this usually happens in a trade where i lose some</p>
<p>money you gain some money you lose a sandwich and i gain a sandwich and this kind of model</p>
<p>works really well when the thing that we&rsquo;re using money to incentivize this kind of private</p>
<p>goods right things that you provide to one person where the benefit comes to one person</p>
<p>but the like on the internet especially but also many many contexts and if off the internet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actions that kind of individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit</p>
<p>going to one person the benefit just goes to many people at the same time and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>control where the benefit goes to right so for example this podcast you know we publish</p>
<p>it and when it&rsquo;s published you don&rsquo;t have any fine grains control over like oh these</p>
<p>38 000 people can watch it and then like these other 29 000 people can&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s like once the</p>
<p>number goes high enough then you know people just like copy it and then when i write articles</p>
<p>on a blog then they&rsquo;re just like free for everyone and that stuff&rsquo;s even harder to prevent</p>
<p>anyone from copying so and aside from that things like you know scientific research for</p>
<p>example and even taking more pedestrian examples like climate change mitigation would be a</p>
<p>big one so there&rsquo;s a lot of things in the world where you have these kind of individual</p>
<p>actions with enough concentrated costs and distributed benefits and money as a point</p>
<p>system does not do a good job of encouraging these things and one of the kind of other</p>
<p>things even kind of tangentially connected to crypto but kind of theoretically outside</p>
<p>of it that i work on is this sort of mechanism called quadratic funding and the way to think</p>
<p>about it is i kind of imagine a point system where if like if one person gives coin gives</p>
<p>coins to one other person then it works the same way as money but if multiple people give</p>
<p>coins to one person and they do so anonymously so it&rsquo;s kind of not in consideration for a</p>
<p>specific service to that person themselves then the number of coins received by that</p>
<p>person is kind of greater than just the sum of the number of coins that have given by</p>
<p>those different people so the actual formula is you take the square root of the amount</p>
<p>that each person gave then you add all the square roots and then you kind of square the</p>
<p>sum yeah and then you give that and the idea here would basically be that if let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>for example you just start going off and kind of planting a lot of trees and there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of people that are really happy that you&rsquo;re planting trees and then so they go and all</p>
<p>kind of throw a coin your way then the like there is like basically the fact that kind</p>
<p>of you get more than the sub you get this kind of square of sum of these of square roots</p>
<p>of these tiny nodes that this actually kind of compensates for the tragedy of the commons</p>
<p>right this there&rsquo;s even this kind of mathematical proof that it&rsquo;s sort of optimally compensates</p>
<p>for it what is the tragedy of the common this is just this idea that like if there is this</p>
<p>situation where there&rsquo;s some public good that lots of people benefit from then no individual</p>
<p>person wants to contribute to it because if they contribute they only get a small part</p>
<p>of the benefit from their contribution but they pay the full cost of their contribution</p>
<p>in which context is this sorry what is the term quadratic what quadratic funding like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in which context is this mechanism useful so obviously you said to combat the</p>
<p>tragedy of the commons but you know in which context do you see it as useful actually practically</p>
<p>yeah theoretically public goods in general right so like like services like what are</p>
<p>we what are we talking about what&rsquo;s a public yeah so within the ethereum ecosystem for</p>
<p>example like we&rsquo;ve actually tried using this mechanism like yeah wrote a couple of articles</p>
<p>about this on vitalik.ca where i go through some of the most recent rounds and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>really interesting um some of the top ones that people supported there were um things</p>
<p>like kind of just online user interfaces that make it easier for people to interact with</p>
<p>ethereum um there was a documentation there were podcasts um there were kind of software</p>
<p>kind of clients like kind of implementations of the ethereum protocol of privacy tools</p>
<p>just like lots of things that are kind of useful to lots of people when a lot of people</p>
<p>are contributing for like funding a particular particular entity yeah that&rsquo;s really that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really interesting is there something special about the quadratic the the the summing of</p>
<p>the square roots and yeah so another way to think about it is like imagine if n people</p>
<p>each give a dollar then the person gets n squared right um and and so each individual</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s contribution gets multiplied by n right because you have n people and so that</p>
<p>kind of perfectly compensates for the kind like kind of n to one uh tragedy of the commons</p>
<p>i just wonder if the the squared part is yeah fundamental no it is um and i&rsquo;d uh recommend</p>
<p>you go to on vitalik.ca i have this article called quadratic payments a primer and highly</p>
<p>recommended it&rsquo;s kind of at least my attempt so far kind of explaining the intuition behind</p>
<p>this intuition so if we could can we go to the the very basics what is the blockchain</p>
<p>or perhaps we might even start at the uh the the byzantine generals problem and byzantine</p>
<p>fault tolerance in general that i i uh bitcoin was taking steps to uh providing a solution</p>
<p>for so the byzantine generals problem it&rsquo;s this uh paper that leslie lamport published</p>
<p>in 1982 where he has this thought experiments where if you have two generals that are kind</p>
<p>of camped out on opposite sides of a city um and they&rsquo;re planning when to attack the</p>
<p>city then uh the question is and if how could those generals coordinate with each other</p>
<p>and they could send messengers between each other but those messengers kind of could get</p>
<p>sniped by the enemy on the road road some of those messages could end up being traders</p>
<p>and if things could end up happening and with just two mess generals it turns out that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of no solution in a finite number of rounds that guarantees that they will be able</p>
<p>to kind of coordinate on the same answer but then in the case where you have more than</p>
<p>two generals that then leslie analyzes cases like um are the mess messages kind of just</p>
<p>oral messages um are the messages kind of signed messages so i could give you a signed</p>
<p>message and you can pass along that signed message and the third party can still verify</p>
<p>that i originally made that message and depending on those different cases there&rsquo;s kind of different</p>
<p>bounds on like given how many generals and how many traders among those generals and</p>
<p>if what like under what conditions you actually can&rsquo;t agree when to launch an attack uh so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a big misconception that the byzantine generalist problem was unsolved</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say lamport solved it the thing that was unsolved though is that all of these solutions</p>
<p>assume that you&rsquo;ve already agreed on and have fixed the list of who the generals are and</p>
<p>these generals have to be kind of semi trusted to some extent they can&rsquo;t just be anonymous</p>
<p>people because if they&rsquo;re anonymous then like the enemy could just be 99 percent of the</p>
<p>generals uh so right the um in the 1980s and the 1990s kind of the general use case</p>
<p>for distributed system stuff was more kind of enterprisey stuff where you could kind</p>
<p>of assume that uh you know you know who the nodes are that are running these kind of computer</p>
<p>networks so if he wants to have some kind of decentralized computer network that pretends</p>
<p>to be a single computer and that you can kind of do do kind of operations on then it&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>out of these kind of 15 specific computers and we know kind of who and where they are</p>
<p>and so we have a good reason to believe that say at least 11 of them would be fine and</p>
<p>it could also be within a single system exactly almost a network of devices sensors so on</p>
<p>like in airplanes and i think uh like flight systems in general still use these kinds of</p>
<p>ideas yep yep um so that&rsquo;s the 80s that&rsquo;s the 80s and 90s now the cypherpunks had a</p>
<p>different use case in mind which is that they wanted to create a fully decentralized global</p>
<p>permissionless currency and the problem here is that they didn&rsquo;t want any authorities and</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even want any kind of privileged list of people and so now the question is</p>
<p>well how do you use these techniques to create consensus when you have no way of kind of</p>
<p>measuring identities right you have no way of kind of determining whether or not some</p>
<p>99 of participants aren&rsquo;t actually all the same guy and so the clever solution that satoshi</p>
<p>had this is uh kind of going back to the that presentation i made at defcon a few months ago where i said that the</p>
<p>things that satoshi invented with crypto economics um is this uh really neat idea that you can</p>
<p>use economic resources to kind of limit identity how many identities you can get and the uh</p>
<p>if there isn&rsquo;t any existing decentralized digital currency then the only way to do this</p>
<p>is with proof of work right so with proof of work the solution is uh just uh you publish</p>
<p>a solution to a hard mathematical puzzle that takes some uh kind of clearly calculable amount</p>
<p>of computational power to solve you get an identity and then you solve five of those</p>
<p>puzzles you get five identities and then these are the identities that we run the consensus</p>
<p>algorithm between so the proof of work mechanism you just described is like the fundamental</p>
<p>idea proposed in the in the white paper that defines bitcoin uh what&rsquo;s the idea of consensus</p>
<p>that we wish to reach why is consensus important here what is consensus so the goal here in</p>
<p>just simple technical terms is to basically kind of wire together a set of a large number</p>
<p>of computers in such a way that they kind of pretends to the outside world to be a single</p>
<p>computer where that single computer keeps working even if a large portion of the kind</p>
<p>of constituents the computers that make it up break and kind of break in arbitrary ways</p>
<p>like they could shut off they could try to actively break a system they could do lots</p>
<p>of mean things so the reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do this is because they wanted to</p>
<p>run one particular program on this virtual computer and the one particular program that</p>
<p>they wanted to run is just a currency system right it&rsquo;s a system that just processes a</p>
<p>series of transactions and for every transaction it verifies that the sender has enough coins</p>
<p>to pay for the transaction it verifies that the digital signature is correct and if the</p>
<p>checks pass then it subtracts the coins from one account and adds the coins to the other</p>
<p>account roughly so first of all the the the proof of work idea is kind of i mean at least</p>
<p>to me seems pretty fascinating it is i mean that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s kind of a revolutionary idea</p>
<p>i mean is is it is it obvious to come up with that you can use uh you can exchange basically</p>
<p>computational resources for for identity it&rsquo;s uh it actually has a pretty long history it</p>
<p>was uh first proposed in a paper by uh mc cynthia dwork and nixon naor in 1994 i believe</p>
<p>and the original use case was uh combating email spam so the idea is that if you send</p>
<p>an email you have to send it with a proof of work attached and like this makes it reasonably</p>
<p>cheap to send emails to your friends but it makes it really expensive to send spam to</p>
<p>a million people yeah that&rsquo;s a simple brilliant idea so maybe also taking a step back so what</p>
<p>is the role of blockchain in this what is the blockchain sure so the blockchain my way</p>
<p>of thinking about it is that it is this kind of system where you have this kind of one</p>
<p>virtual computer created by this a bunch of these nodes in the network and the reason</p>
<p>why the term blockchain is used is because the data structure that these systems use</p>
<p>at least so far is one where they um different nodes in the network periodically publish</p>
<p>blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions together with a pointer like a hash of a previous</p>
<p>block that it builds on top of and so you have a series of blocks that that nodes in</p>
<p>the network create where each block points to the previous block and so you have this</p>
<p>chain of them is a fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of blockchain or is it</p>
<p>a lot of possibilities of different ways to make sure there&rsquo;s no funny stuff going on</p>
<p>there are indeed a lot of possibilities um so in a kind of just simple architecture as</p>
<p>I just described the way the fault tolerance happens is like this right so you have a bunch</p>
<p>of nodes and they&rsquo;re just happily and have occasionally creating blocks building on top</p>
<p>of them each other&rsquo;s blocks and let&rsquo;s say you have kind of one block we&rsquo;ll call it kind</p>
<p>of block one and then someone else builds another block honestly you&rsquo;ll call it block</p>
<p>two then we have an attacker and what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries</p>
<p>to revert block two and the way they revert block two is instead of doing the thing they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to do which is build a block on top of block two they&rsquo;re going to build another</p>
<p>block on top of block one um so you have block one which has two children block two and then</p>
<p>block two prime now this might sometimes even happen by random chance if you know two nodes</p>
<p>in the network just happen to create blocks at the same time and they don&rsquo;t hear about</p>
<p>each other&rsquo;s things before they create their own but this also could happen because of</p>
<p>an attack now if this happens you have an attack then the uh no in the bitcoin system</p>
<p>uh the nodes follow the longest chain um so if um this um attack had happened uh and when</p>
<p>the original chain had more than two blocks on it so if it was trying to kind of revert</p>
<p>more than more than two blocks then everyone would just would just ignore it and everyone</p>
<p>would just keep following the regular chain but here you know we have block two and we</p>
<p>have block two prime and so the two are kind of even and then whatever block um the next</p>
<p>block is created on top of so say block three is now created on top of block two prime then</p>
<p>everyone says uh agrees that block three is the new head um and block two prime is just</p>
<p>kind of forgotten and then everyone just kind of peacefully builds on top of block three</p>
<p>and the thing continues so how difficult is it to mess with the system right so how like</p>
<p>if we look at the general problem like how many what fraction of people who participate</p>
<p>in the system have to be bad players in order to mess with it truly like what&rsquo;s your is</p>
<p>there is there a good number there is um well depending on kind of what your model of the</p>
<p>participants is and like what kind of attack we&rsquo;re talking about it&rsquo;s anywhere between</p>
<p>23.2 and 50 of what of all of the computing power in the network sorry so 22 and 23 point</p>
<p>between 23.2 and 50 and 50 can be compromised so like once your once your your portion of</p>
<p>the total computing power in the network goes above the 23.2 level then there&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>things that you could mean things that you can potentially do and as your percentage</p>
<p>of the network kind of keeps going up then the your abilities as you mean things kind</p>
<p>of goes higher and then if you have above 50 then you can just break everything so how</p>
<p>how hard is it to achieve that level like it seems that so far historically speaking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been exceptionally difficult so this is a challenging question um so the economic</p>
<p>cost of acquiring that level of stuff from scratch is fairly high i think it&rsquo;s uh somewhere</p>
<p>in the low billions of dollars and when you say that stuff you mean computational resources</p>
<p>yeah so specifically specialized hardware and of asics that people use to solve these</p>
<p>puzzles to do the mining these days small tangent uh so obviously i work a lot in deep</p>
<p>learning with gpus and asics for that application and i tangentially kind of hear that so many</p>
<p>of these you know sometimes nvidia gpus are sold out because of this other application</p>
<p>like what do if you can comment i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar or interested in this space</p>
<p>what kind of asics what kind of hardware is generally used these days for to do the actual</p>
<p>computation for the proof of work sure so in the case in bitcoin and ethereum are a</p>
<p>bit different so in the case of bitcoin there is an algorithm called sha256 it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>hash function and so the puzzle is just coming up with a number where the hash of the number</p>
<p>is below some threshold and so because the hashes are designed to be random you just</p>
<p>have to keep on trying different numbers until one works and the asics are just like specialized</p>
<p>circuits that contain and if circuits for evaluating this hash over and over again and</p>
<p>you have like millions or billions of these hash evaluators and just stacked on top of</p>
<p>each other inside of a box and you just keep on running the box 24 7 in the asics there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally specialized hardware designed for this yes oh this is a little bit an amazing</p>
<p>world another tangent i&rsquo;ll come back to the basics but uh does quantum computing throw</p>
<p>a wrench into any of this very good question so uh quantum computers have two main uh kind</p>
<p>of families of algorithms that are relevant to cryptography one is shor&rsquo;s algorithm and</p>
<p>shor&rsquo;s algorithm is one that kind of completely breaks the hardness of some specific kinds</p>
<p>of mathematical problems so the one that you&rsquo;ve probably heard of is it makes it very easy</p>
<p>to factor numbers so figure out kind of what prime factors are the kind of that you need</p>
<p>to multiply together to get some number even if that number is extremely big shor&rsquo;s algorithm</p>
<p>can also be used to break elliptic curve cryptography it can break like any kind of hidden order</p>
<p>groups it breaks a lot of kind of cryptographic nice things that we&rsquo;re used to but the good</p>
<p>news is that for every kind of major use of things that shor&rsquo;s algorithm breaks we already</p>
<p>know of quantum proof alternatives right now we don&rsquo;t use these quantum proof alternatives</p>
<p>yet because in many cases they&rsquo;re five to ten times less efficient but the crypto industry</p>
<p>in general kind of knows that this is coming eventually and it&rsquo;s kind of ready to take</p>
<p>the hit and switch to that stuff when we when we have to the second algorithm that is relevant</p>
<p>to cryptography is grover&rsquo;s algorithm and in grover&rsquo;s algorithm might even be kind of</p>
<p>more familiar to ai people that&rsquo;s basically usually described as solving search problems</p>
<p>but the idea here is that if you have a problem of the form find a number that satisfies some</p>
<p>property then if with a classical computer you need to try and if n times before before</p>
<p>you find a number then with a quantum computer you only need to do square root of n computations</p>
<p>and grover&rsquo;s could potentially be used for mining but there&rsquo;s two possibilities here</p>
<p>one is that grover&rsquo;s could be used for mining and whoever creates the first working quantum</p>
<p>computer that could do grover&rsquo;s will just mine way faster than everyone else and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see another round of what we saw when a6 came out which is that kind of the new hardware</p>
<p>just kind of dominated the old stuff and then eventually it switched to a new equilibrium</p>
<p>but by the way way faster not exponentially faster quadratically faster quadratically</p>
<p>faster which is not sort of it&rsquo;s not game changing i would say it&rsquo;s like a6 like you</p>
<p>said it would be exactly yeah so it would not necessarily break proof of work as a that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right yeah now the other kind of possible world right is that quantum computers have</p>
<p>a lot of overhead there&rsquo;s a lot of a complexity involved in maintaining quantum states and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also as we&rsquo;ve been realizing recently making quantum computers actually work requires</p>
<p>kind of quantum error correction which requires kind of a thousand real qubits per logical</p>
<p>qubit and so there&rsquo;s the very real possibility that the overhead of running a quantum computer</p>
<p>will be higher than the speed up you get with grover&rsquo;s which would be kind of sad but which</p>
<p>would also mean that the given proof of work will just keep working fine so beautifully</p>
<p>put so so proof of work is the core idea of bitcoin is there other core ideas before we</p>
<p>kind of take a step towards the origin story and ideas of ethereum is there other stuff</p>
<p>that were key to the white paper of bitcoin there is proof of work and then there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the cryptography is just kind of public keys and signatures that are used to verify transactions</p>
<p>those two are the big things so then what is the origin story maybe the human side but</p>
<p>also the technical side of ethereum sure so i joined the bitcoin community in 2011 and</p>
<p>i started by just writing i first wrote for this sort of online thing called bitcoin weekly</p>
<p>then i started writing for bitcoin magazine um and uh sorry to interrupt you have this</p>
<p>funny kind of uh story true or not is uh that you were disillusioned by the downsides of</p>
<p>centralized control from your experience with wow world of warcraft is this true or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just being witty uh i mean the event is true the fact that that&rsquo;s the reason i do decentralization</p>
<p>is witty maybe just a small tangent do have you always had a skepticism of centralized</p>
<p>control is that sort of degree yeah has that feeling evolved over time or has that just</p>
<p>always been a core feeling that decentralized control is the future of a human society it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely been something that felt very attractive to me ever since i could have learned that</p>
<p>such a thing is possible it&rsquo;s possible even yeah so great so you&rsquo;re you joined the bitcoin</p>
<p>community in 2011 you said you began writing so what&rsquo;s next started writing uh moved from</p>
<p>high school to university halfway in between that and spent a year in university then at</p>
<p>the end of that year i dropped out to do bitcoin things full time and this was a combination</p>
<p>of continuing to write bitcoin magazine but also increasingly work on software projects</p>
<p>and i traveled around the world for about six months and just going to different bitcoin</p>
<p>communities like i went to first in new hampshire then spain other european places israel and</p>
<p>then san francisco and along the way i&rsquo;ve met a lot of other people that are working</p>
<p>on different bitcoin projects and when i was in israel there were some very smart teams</p>
<p>there that were working on ideas that people were starting to kind of call bitcoin 2.0</p>
<p>so one of these were colored coins which is basically saying that hey let&rsquo;s not just use</p>
<p>the blockchain for bitcoin but let&rsquo;s also like kind of issue other kinds of assets on</p>
<p>it and then there was a protocol called master coin that supported issuing assets but also</p>
<p>supported many other things like financial contracts like domain name registration and</p>
<p>a lot of different things together and i spent some time working with these teams and i quickly</p>
<p>kind of realized that this master coin protocol could be improved by kind of generalizing</p>
<p>it more right so the best the analogy i use is that the master coin protocol was like</p>
<p>this swiss army knife you have 25 different transaction types for 25 different applications</p>
<p>but what i realized is that you could replace a bunch of them with things that are more</p>
<p>general purpose so one of them was that you could replace like three transaction types</p>
<p>for three types of financial contracts with a generic transaction type for a financial</p>
<p>contract that just lets you specify a mathematical formula for kind of who how much money each</p>
<p>side gets by the way it&rsquo;s a small pause what&rsquo;s you say financial contract just the terminology</p>
<p>what is the contract what&rsquo;s a financial contract so this is just generally an agreement where</p>
<p>kind of either one or two parties kind of put collateral kind of in and then they depending</p>
<p>on kind of certain conditions like this could involve prices of assets this could involve</p>
<p>the actions of the two parties it could involve other things but they kind of get different</p>
<p>amounts of of assets out that just depend on things that happened so a contract is really</p>
<p>a financial contract is at the core it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the core interactive element of a financial</p>
<p>system yeah there&rsquo;s yeah there&rsquo;s many different kinds of financial contracts like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things like options where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing that you</p>
<p>have for some specific price for some period of time there&rsquo;s uh contracts for difference</p>
<p>where you basically are kind of making a bet that says like for every dollar this thing</p>
<p>goes up i&rsquo;ll give you seven dollars or for every dollar that thing goes down you give</p>
<p>me seven dollars or something like that and but the main idea that these contracts have</p>
<p>to be enforced and trusted them yes exactly you have to trust that they will work out</p>
<p>in a system where nobody can be trusted yes this is such a beautiful complicated system</p>
<p>okay so uh so you were seeking to kind of generalize this basic uh framework of contracts</p>
<p>um so what does that entail so what what technically are the steps to creating ethereum</p>
<p>sure so i guess just to kind of continue a bit with this master coin story um so started</p>
<p>by kind of giving ideas for how to generalize the thing and eventually um this turned into</p>
<p>a much more kind of fully fledged proposal that just says hey how about you scrap all</p>
<p>your futures and instead you just um put in this programming language and i gave this</p>
<p>idea to them and their response was something like hey this is great but this seems complicated</p>
<p>and it seems like something that we&rsquo;re not going to be able to put onto our roadmap for</p>
<p>a while and my response to this was like wait do you not realize how revolutionary this</p>
<p>is well i&rsquo;ll just go do it myself and then i what was the name of the programming language</p>
<p>i just called it ultimate scripting great uh so then i kind of went through a couple</p>
<p>more rounds of iteration and then the idea for a theorem itself started to form</p>
<p>um and the idea here is that you just have a blockchain where the core unit of the thing</p>
<p>is what we call contracts it&rsquo;s these kind of accounts that can hold assets um and like</p>
<p>they have their own internal memory but that are controlled by a piece of code and so if</p>
<p>i send some ether to a contract the only thing that can determine where that kind of ether</p>
<p>the currency inside ethereum and it goes after that um is the code of that contract itself</p>
<p>and so basically kind of sending assets to computer programs becomes this kind of paradigm</p>
<p>for creating these sort of agreements self executing agreements self executing it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>cool that code is sort of part of this contract so that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s meant by smart contracts</p>
<p>yeah so how hard was it to build this kind of thing harder than expected um and originally</p>
<p>i actually thought that this would be a thing that i would kind of casually work on for a</p>
<p>couple of months publish and then go back to university um then i released it and a bunch</p>
<p>of people or i released the white paper the white paper the idea is there the idea the</p>
<p>white paper um a whole bunch of people came in offering the help a huge number of people</p>
<p>and have expressed interest and this was something i was totally not expecting and then i kind of</p>
<p>realized that this would be something that&rsquo;s kind of much bigger than i had ever um thought</p>
<p>that it would be and then we started on this kind of much longer development slog of making</p>
<p>something that lives up to this sort of much higher level of expectations what are the some</p>
<p>of the is it fundamentally like software engineering challenges it was their social</p>
<p>okay so there&rsquo;s social so so what are the biggest interesting challenges that you&rsquo;ve learned about</p>
<p>human civilization and in in software engineering through this process</p>
<p>so i guess one of the challenges for me is that like i&rsquo;m one of the kind of apparently unusual</p>
<p>geek schoolers and i&rsquo;ve never treated with anything but kindness in school yes um and so</p>
<p>when i got into crypto i kind of expected everyone would just kind of be the same kind</p>
<p>of altruistic and nice in that same way um but the um kind of the algorithm that i used for</p>
<p>finding cofounders for this thing was not very good it was sort of literally one computer</p>
<p>scientist called the greedy algorithm it&rsquo;s sort of the first 15 people who replied back offering</p>
<p>to help kind of are the cofounders oh you mean like literally the the the people that for will</p>
<p>form to be the the founders cofounders of the community the algorithm i like how you call it</p>
<p>the algorithm yeah um and so what happened was that uh these um like especially as the project</p>
<p>got really big like there started to be a lot of this kind of infighting and there were a lot of</p>
<p>like i wanted the thing to be a non profit and some of them wanted to be a for profit</p>
<p>uh and then there started to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with each</p>
<p>other there were people that were kind of trying to get an advantage for themselves in a lot of</p>
<p>different ways and this uh just about six months later led to this big governance crisis and then</p>
<p>we kind of reshuffled leadership a bit and then uh the project kept on going then nine months</p>
<p>later there was another governance crisis and then there was a third governance crisis and so</p>
<p>is there a way to if you&rsquo;re looking at the human side of things is there a way to optimize this</p>
<p>aspect of the cryptocurrency world it seems that there is uh from my perspective there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>different characters and personalities and egos and like you said uh i don&rsquo;t know if you know i</p>
<p>also like to think that most of the world most of the people in the world are well intentioned</p>
<p>but the way those intentions are realized may perhaps come off as uh yeah as as negative like</p>
<p>what uh is there is there a hopeful message here about creating a governance structure for</p>
<p>cryptocurrency that uh where everyone gets along and after about four rounds of reshuffle like i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve actually come up with something that seems to be pretty stable and happy um i think uh</p>
<p>i mean i definitely do think that most people are well intentioned i just think that like one of the</p>
<p>reasons why i like decentralization is just because there&rsquo;s like this thing about power</p>
<p>where power attracts people with egos and so that just allows us a very small percentage of people</p>
<p>to just ruin so many things you think ego has a you think ego has a use like is ego always bad</p>
<p>it seems like sometimes does but then the ethereum research team i feel like we&rsquo;ve found</p>
<p>also kind of a lot like a lot of very good people that are just kind of primarily just interested</p>
<p>in things for the technology and uh things seem to just generally be going quite well</p>
<p>yeah when you&rsquo;re when the focus and the passion is in the tech so on the so that&rsquo;s the human side</p>
<p>of things but the technology side like what have you learned what have been the biggest challenges</p>
<p>of bringing ethereum to life on the technology side so i think first of all just uh you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like the first law of software development which is that when someone gives you a timetable</p>
<p>i switch the unit of time to the next largest unit of time and add one and like we basically</p>
<p>fell victim to that um and uh and so instead of taking like three months it ended up taking like</p>
<p>20 months to watch the thing um and that was just i think underestimating the sheer technical</p>
<p>complexity of the thing um there are research challenges like so for example one of the things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been saying from the start that we would do one is a switch from a proof of work</p>
<p>to a proof of stake um where proof of stake is so this uh alternative consensus mechanism where</p>
<p>instead of having to waste a lot of computing power on solving these mathematical puzzles</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t mean anything you kind of prove that you have access to coins inside of the system and</p>
<p>this uh then it gives you some level of participation in the consensus can you</p>
<p>maybe elaborate on that a little bit i understand the idea of proof of work</p>
<p>um i know that a lot of people say that the idea of proof of stake is really appealing can you</p>
<p>maybe linger on it longer explain what it is sure uh so basically the idea is like if i kind of lock</p>
<p>up a hundred coins then i turn that into a kind of quote virtual miner and the system itself kind</p>
<p>of automatically and randomly assigns that in a virtual miner the right to create blocks at</p>
<p>particular intervals and then if someone else has 200 coins and they walk on the walk there&rsquo;s 200</p>
<p>coins then they get a kind of twice as big virtual miner they&rsquo;ll be able to create blocks twice as</p>
<p>often so it tries to kind of do similar things to proof of work except instead of the thing</p>
<p>and of rate limiting your participation being your ability to crank out solutions to kind of</p>
<p>hash challenges the thing that really limits your participation is kind of how much coins you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of locking into this mechanism okay so interesting so that that limited participation</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require you to run a lot of compute does that mean that the richer you are so rich people</p>
<p>um are more like their identities more right and this stable yeah verifiable or whatever</p>
<p>whatever the right terminology is right and this is definitely a common critique i think my usual</p>
<p>answer to this is that like proof of work is even more of that kind of system exactly yeah because</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t mean it and that statement is a criticism i think you&rsquo;re exactly right that&rsquo;s equivalent</p>
<p>the proof of work is the same kind of thing but in the proof of work you have to also use physical</p>
<p>resources yes and burn computers and burn trees and all of that stuff is there um a way to mess</p>
<p>with the system of the proof of uh proof of stake there is but you will once again need to have a</p>
<p>very large portion of all the coins that are locked in the system to do anything bad got it</p>
<p>yeah and just that maybe take a small tangent one of the criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact</p>
<p>that i guess for the proof of work mechanism you have to use so much energy in the world</p>
<p>yes is one of the motivations of proof of stake is to move away from this definitely like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your sense of the uh maybe i&rsquo;m just under informed is there like legitimately environmental impact</p>
<p>from this yeah uh so the latest thing was that bitcoin consumed as much energy as the country of</p>
<p>austria or something like that yeah and then ethereum is like right now maybe only like</p>
<p>half in order of magnitude smaller than bitcoin i&rsquo;ve heard you talk about ethereum 2.0 so what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the what&rsquo;s the dream of ethereum 2.0 what&rsquo;s the the status of proof of stake is the mechanism that</p>
<p>ethereum moves towards and also how do you move to a different mechanism of consensus</p>
<p>within a cryptocurrency so ethereum 2.0 is a collection of major upgrades that we&rsquo;ve wanted</p>
<p>to do to ethereum for quite some time the two big ones uh one is a proof of stake and the other is</p>
<p>what we call sharding um sharding solves another problem with blockchains which is a scalability</p>
<p>and what sharding does is it basically says instead of every participant in the network</p>
<p>having to personally download and verify every transaction every participant in the network only</p>
<p>downloads and verifies a small portion of transactions and then you kind of randomly</p>
<p>distribute who gets how much work um and because of how the distribution is random it still has the</p>
<p>property that you need a large portion of the entire network to corrupt what&rsquo;s going on inside</p>
<p>of any shard but the system is still in a very redundant and very secure that&rsquo;s brilliant how</p>
<p>hard is that to implement and how hard is uh proof of stake to implement like on the technical level</p>
<p>yeah software level proof of stake and sharding are both challenging um i&rsquo;d say sharding is a bit</p>
<p>more challenging the reason is that proof of stake is kind of just a change to the how the</p>
<p>consensus layer works sharding does both that but it&rsquo;s also a change to the networking layer</p>
<p>um the reason is that sharding is kind of pointless if at the networking layer you still</p>
<p>do what you do today which is you kind of gossip everything which means that if someone publishes</p>
<p>something every other node and the client hears it like from uh on the networking layer and so</p>
<p>instead we have to have kind of subnetworks and the ability to quickly switch between subnetworks</p>
<p>and have the subnetworks talk to each other and this is all doable but it&rsquo;s a more complex</p>
<p>architecture and it&rsquo;s definitely the sort of thing that hasn&rsquo;t not yet been done in cryptocurrency</p>
<p>so most most of the networking layer in uh cryptocurrency is you&rsquo;re shouting you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>broadcasting messages and this is more like ad hoc networks like yeah you&rsquo;re shouting within</p>
<p>smaller groups smaller group but you have like a bunch of subnet like exactly then you have to</p>
<p>switch between oh man i&rsquo;d love to see the uh so it&rsquo;s a beautiful idea uh so from a graph</p>
<p>theoretical perspective but just the software that like who&rsquo;s responsible is the ethereum</p>
<p>project like the people involved would they be implementing like what&rsquo;s the actual</p>
<p>you know this is like legit software engineering uh who like how does that work how do people</p>
<p>collaborate build that kind of project is this like almost um like is there a software engineering</p>
<p>lead is there it&rsquo;s like is it a legit almost like large scale open source project there is</p>
<p>yeah so um we have uh someone named uh danny ryan on our team who&rsquo;s just been brilliant and</p>
<p>great all around and he is a kind of de facto kind of development coordinator i guess it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>have to invent job titles for this stuff the reason is that um like we also have this unique</p>
<p>kind of organizational structure where the ethereum foundation itself kind of does research</p>
<p>in house but then the actual implementation is done by independent teams that are separate</p>
<p>companies and they&rsquo;re located all around the world and like fun places like australia and and</p>
<p>and so uh you know you kind of just need a bunch of kind of almost nonstop cat herding to just</p>
<p>keep getting these people to kind of talk to each other and kind of implement this back make sure</p>
<p>that everyone agrees on kind of what what&rsquo;s going on and kind of how to interpret different things</p>
<p>so how far into the future are we from these two mechanisms in ethereum 2.0 like what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>sense of the timeline keeping in mind the previous comment you made about the sort of uh general</p>
<p>curse of software projects so ethereum 2.0 is split into three phases so phase zero just</p>
<p>creates a proof stake network and it&rsquo;s actually separate from kind of proof of uh the proof of</p>
<p>work network at the beginning just to kind of give it time to grow and improve itself</p>
<p>do people get to choose sorry to interrupt do people get to choose i guess yes they get they</p>
<p>get to choose to move over if they want to then phase one adds sharding but it only adds sharding</p>
<p>of data storage and not sharding of computation and then after that there is kind of the merger</p>
<p>phase which is where the uh and if the accounts uh kind of smart contracts like all of the activity</p>
<p>and uh the existing eth1 system just kind of gets cut and pasted into eth2 and then the proof of</p>
<p>work chain gets forgotten and then and things all the things that were living there before just</p>
<p>kind of continue living inside of the proof of stake system so for timelines um phase zero has</p>
<p>been uh kind of almost fully implemented um and now it&rsquo;s just a matter of uh a whole bunch of</p>
<p>security auditing and testing um my own experience is that right now it feels like we&rsquo;re at about a</p>
<p>phase comparable to when we were doing uh the original ethereum launch when we were maybe about</p>
<p>four months away from launch so that&rsquo;s just a hunch then that&rsquo;s just a hunch yeah so how you</p>
<p>know it took it took like over a decade for people to move from python 2 to python 3 uh how do you see</p>
<p>the move from like this phase zero of for for different consensus mechanism do you see there</p>
<p>being a a drastic phase shift in people just kind of jumping to this better mechanism so in phase</p>
<p>zero i don&rsquo;t expect too many people to do much because in phase zero in phase one the new chain</p>
<p>the get of deliberately enough doesn&rsquo;t have too much functionality turned on it&rsquo;s there just like</p>
<p>if you want to be a proof of stake validator you can get things started if you want to store data</p>
<p>for other blockchain applications you can get started but existing applications will largely</p>
<p>keep living on eth1 and then when the merger happens then the merger is a operation that</p>
<p>happens all at once so that&rsquo;s kind of one of the benefits of a consensus system that like on the</p>
<p>one hand you have to coordinate the upgrade but on the other hand the upgrade can be coordinated</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s casper ffg by the way um casper ffg is the consensus algorithm that we are using for</p>
<p>the proof of stake is there something interesting uh specific about casper ffg</p>
<p>like some beautiful aspect of it that&rsquo;s uh there is so casper ffg combines together kind of two</p>
<p>different schools of a consensus algorithm design uh so the general two different schools of the</p>
<p>of this design are right one is uh 50 fault tolerant but dependent on network synchrony</p>
<p>so 50 fault tolerant but it didn&rsquo;t tolerate up to 50 of faults but not more but it depends on</p>
<p>an assumption that all of the nodes can talk uh talk to each other within some</p>
<p>kind of limited period of time like if i send the message you&rsquo;ll receive it within a few seconds</p>
<p>and the second school is 33 fault tolerant but safe under asynchrony which means that</p>
<p>like if we agree on something then that thing is finalized and even if the network goes horribly</p>
<p>wonky the second after that thing is finalized there&rsquo;s no way to revert that thing um and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating how you would make that happen it&rsquo;s uh definitely quite clever um i&rsquo;d recommend the</p>
<p>uh casper ffg paper if you just search like archive as in like arxiv casper ffg it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an archive the paper is an archive yeah yeah who are the authors um myself and uh virgil</p>
<p>griffith that&rsquo;s awesome i take a small tangent this idea of just putting out white papers and</p>
<p>papers and putting them on archive and just putting them publicly is that is that at the core</p>
<p>is that a necessary component of the currency is that the tradition started with uh uh satoshi</p>
<p>nakamoto&rsquo;s what do you make of it like what do you make of the future of that kind of sharing of</p>
<p>ideas i guess so yeah and it&rsquo;s definitely something that&rsquo;s kind of mandatory for crypto because like</p>
<p>crypto is all about making systems where you know you don&rsquo;t have to trust the operators to</p>
<p>trust that the thing works and so if anything behind our system works is closed sourced and</p>
<p>that kind of uh kills the point and so there is the kind of a sense in which the fundamental</p>
<p>properties of the category of the thing we&rsquo;re trying to build just kind of forces openness</p>
<p>but also openness just has proven to be a really great way to collaborate and then there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>had a lot of kind of innovation and academic collaboration that&rsquo;s just kind of happened</p>
<p>ad hoc in the crypto space the last few years so like for example we have this forum called</p>
<p>eth research that&rsquo;s like e th r e s e a r and then dot ch um and there we publish kind of just</p>
<p>ideas in a form that&rsquo;s kind of half formal like it&rsquo;s halfway in between like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a kind of</p>
<p>a text write up and then you can have math in it but it&rsquo;s often and of much shorter than a paper</p>
<p>and it turns out that the great majority of new ideas like they&rsquo;re just kind of fairly small</p>
<p>nuggets that you can explain in like five to ten lines and they don&rsquo;t really they don&rsquo;t need the</p>
<p>whole formality of a paper exactly they don&rsquo;t require the kind of like 10 pages of a filler</p>
<p>and so introduction conclusion is not needed yeah and so instead you just kind of publish the idea</p>
<p>and then people can go comments on it and that&rsquo;s brilliant yeah this has been great for us i think</p>
<p>i interrupted you was there something else on casper ffg that&rsquo;s just casper ffg is just kind</p>
<p>of combines together these two schools um and so basically it creates this system where if you have</p>
<p>more than 50 that are honest then and you have network synchrony then the thing kind of goes</p>
<p>as a chain but then if network synchrony fails then kind of the last few blocks in the chain</p>
<p>might um kind of get replaced but anything that was finalized by this kind of more asynchronous</p>
<p>process uh gets uh can&rsquo;t be reverted and so you essentially get a kind of best of both worlds</p>
<p>between those two models okay so i know what i&rsquo;m doing tonight i&rsquo;m going to be reading the casper</p>
<p>fg paper uh apologize for the romanticized question but what to you are some or the most</p>
<p>beautiful idea in the world of ethereum just something uh surprising something beautiful</p>
<p>something powerful yeah i mean i think the fact that money can just emerge out of a database if</p>
<p>enough people believe in it i think is definitely one of those things that&rsquo;s up there um i think one</p>
<p>of the things that i really love about ethereum is also this concept of composability so this is the</p>
<p>idea that like if i build an application on top of ethereum then you can build an application that</p>
<p>talks to my application and you don&rsquo;t even need my permission you don&rsquo;t even need to talk to me</p>
<p>right so one really fun example of this is there was this game on ethereum called crypto kitties</p>
<p>that just involved kind of breeding digital cats yes and someone else created a game called crypto</p>
<p>dragons where the way you play crypto dragons is you have a dragon and you have to feed it crypto</p>
<p>kitties um and they just uh created the whole thing just like as an ethereum contract that you</p>
<p>would send these uh these tokens that are defined by this other ethereum contract and for the</p>
<p>interoperability to happen like the projects didn&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t really need to like the teams don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really need to talk to each other you just kind of interface with the existing program so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>arbitrarily composable in this kind of way so you have different uh you know different groups that</p>
<p>could be working and so you could see it scaling to just outside of dragons and kitties it could</p>
<p>be you could build like entire ecosystems of software yeah and in the i mean especially in</p>
<p>the decentralized finance space that&rsquo;s been popping up the last two years there has been</p>
<p>a huge amount of really interesting things happen as a result of this is a particular kind of like</p>
<p>financial applications kind of thing yeah i mean there&rsquo;s like stable coins so this is a kind of</p>
<p>tokens that retain a value equal to one dollar but they&rsquo;re kind of backed by a crypt uh cryptocurrency</p>
<p>um then there&rsquo;s decentralized exchanges um so when as far as the decentralized exchanges goes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this uh really interesting construction that um has existed for about one and one and a</p>
<p>half years now called uniswap so what uniswap is it&rsquo;s a smart contract that holds the balances of</p>
<p>two tokens we&rsquo;ll call them token a and token b and it maintains an invariance that the balance</p>
<p>of token a multiplied by the balance of token b has to equal the same value and so the way that</p>
<p>you trade against the thing is basically like you have this kind of curve you know like x times y</p>
<p>equals k and yeah before you trade it&rsquo;s at some points on the curve after you trade you just like</p>
<p>pick some different any to any other points on the curve and then whatever the delta x is that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>amount of a tokens you provide whatever the delta y is that&rsquo;s the amount of b tokens you get or vice</p>
<p>versa and that&rsquo;s just and then kind of the slope at the current points on the curve kind of is the</p>
<p>price um and so that just is the whole thing and that just allows you to have this exchange for</p>
<p>tokens and even if there&rsquo;s very few participants and the whole thing is just like so simple and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just very easy to set up very easy to participate in and it just provides so much value</p>
<p>to people so and uh the uh the fundamental the the distributed application infrastructure allows</p>
<p>that somehow yes so this is a smart contract meeting this is all a computer program that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just running on ethereum smart contracts too are just fascinating they are okay do you think</p>
<p>cryptocurrency may become the main currency in the world one day so where do you think we&rsquo;re headed</p>
<p>in terms of the role of currency the structure type of currency in the world i definitely expect</p>
<p>um fiat currencies to continue to exist and continue to be strong and i definitely expect</p>
<p>kind of fiat currencies to also digitize in their own way over the next couple of decades what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fiat currency by the way oh just like things like us dollars and like dollars and euros and yen and</p>
<p>these other things and they&rsquo;re sort of backed by governments yes but i also expect kind of</p>
<p>cryptocurrencies to play this kind of important role in just making sure that people always have</p>
<p>an alternative if fiat currencies start breaking so like if or if you&rsquo;re in you know some very</p>
<p>high inflation place like venice will for example or if uh your country just kind of gets cut off</p>
<p>from um cut off from other financial systems because of like something the banks do</p>
<p>uh if any kind of if there&rsquo;s even like some major trade disruption or something worse happens then</p>
<p>like cryptocurrencies are the sort of thing that just because of their kind of global neutrality</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just kind of always there and you can keep using them it&rsquo;s interesting that you&rsquo;re quite</p>
<p>humble about the possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a possible</p>
<p>future where it becomes the main set of currency because it feels like it feels like the centralized</p>
<p>control by governments of currency is limiting somehow maybe my naive utopian view of the world</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh i mean it&rsquo;s definitely very possible uh i mean i think like for cryptocurrencies being</p>
<p>the main form of value to kind of work well like you do need to have some much more price stability</p>
<p>than they have today and i mean there are now stable coins and there are kind of cryptic</p>
<p>cryptocurrencies that try to be more stable than existing things like bitcoin and ether but</p>
<p>and that just is to me the kind of the main challenge do you think oh that&rsquo;s do you think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a characteristic of this just being the early days it&rsquo;s such a young concept the 10 years</p>
<p>is nothing in the history of money yeah and i think it&rsquo;s a combination of two things right one</p>
<p>is um it&rsquo;s uh uh it&rsquo;s still early days but the other is a kind of more durable any kind of</p>
<p>economic problem which is that like demand for currency is volatile right because of like</p>
<p>recessions booms changes to technology lots of things and if people&rsquo;s demand for how much</p>
<p>currency they want to hold changes and if you have a currency that has a fixed supply</p>
<p>then the change in demand has to be entirely expressed as a change in value of the currency</p>
<p>and so what that means is that kind of the volatility of demand becomes entirely translated</p>
<p>into volatility and ahead of prices of things that dominated in that currency but if you have</p>
<p>a currency where instead the supply can change and so the supply can kind of go up when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more demand then you have the supply and of absorbing more of that volatility and so the</p>
<p>price of the currency would absorb less of the volatility on that topic so bitcoin does have a</p>
<p>limited supply a specific fixed supply yes uh what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the idea and ethereum doesn&rsquo;t but</p>
<p>can you clarify just in the comments you just made is ethereum qualify to the kind of currency</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about and being flexible in the supply i mean it&rsquo;s a bit more flexible but</p>
<p>kind of the thing that you would really want is something that&rsquo;s kind of specifically flexible</p>
<p>in response to how valuable the currency is and and i&rsquo;d recommend you to look at stable coins</p>
<p>as well so like things like die for example it&rsquo;s a new like how you spell that da i and what uh</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s stable coins is it a type of cryptocurrency it is a type of cryptocurrency it&rsquo;s um a type of</p>
<p>cryptocurrency that&rsquo;s issued by a smart contract one of these ethereum computer programs that um</p>
<p>where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether and then it is basically like that people deposit</p>
<p>and then it issues die and the reason why people deposit is because they want to kind of go high</p>
<p>leverage on their ether and so it kind of pairs these two sets of users one that wants stability</p>
<p>and one that kind of wants extra risk together with each other and it basically creates some</p>
<p>or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they&rsquo;ll be that they have this asset that can</p>
<p>that can be later converted back into ether but and like specifically at kind of the one dollar</p>
<p>rate and it has some kind of uh stabilizing network effects yeah it has this yeah it has</p>
<p>many kinds of stabilizing mechanisms in it that&rsquo;s fascinating okay this is this world is awesome</p>
<p>technically just from a scientific perspective is an awesome world uh that i i often don&rsquo;t see from</p>
<p>an outsider&rsquo;s perspective what i often see is kind of uh maybe hype and a little bit if i may say so</p>
<p>like charlatanism and you don&rsquo;t often see at least from my outsider&rsquo;s perspective the beautiful</p>
<p>science of it and the engineering of it i mean maybe is there a comment you can make of who to</p>
<p>follow how to learn about this world without being um interrupted by the charlatans and the hype</p>
<p>people in this space i think you do need to just know the specific kind of just people to follow</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s you know there&rsquo;s all the kind of the cryptographers and the researchers and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like even just the ethereum research crew like myself you know like dan grad danny justin</p>
<p>and of the other people were and then and of the academic cryptographers and like before um</p>
<p>this today i was at stanford and stanford has the center for blockchain research and of dan bonet</p>
<p>this and really a famous and great cryptographer um was uh running it and there&rsquo;s a lot of other</p>
<p>people there and there&rsquo;s people working on zero knowledge proofs for example and um zuko from</p>
<p>zcash has one other person that i respect so i think if you follow the technical you crawl along</p>
<p>that yeah yeah you just start with the theory group and then look at the academics day bonet</p>
<p>and so on and then just cautiously expand the network of people you follow yeah exactly and</p>
<p>like if someone seems too too self promotional then just like remove them is there books</p>
<p>that are so there&rsquo;s these white papers and we just discussed about about ideas being</p>
<p>condensed into really small parts is there books that are emerging that are kind of</p>
<p>good uh introductory material so for historical ones and there&rsquo;s like nathaniel popper&rsquo;s digital</p>
<p>gold which is just about the history of bitcoin there&rsquo;s like one and then matthew leising announced</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one about the history of ethereum um for technical ones and there&rsquo;s andreas hansenopoulos</p>
<p>is mastering ethereum great so um let me ask you sort of uh sorry to to pull back to the</p>
<p>the idea of governments and decentralized currency</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a tension between decentralization of currency and the power of nations</p>
<p>um the power of governments you um what&rsquo;s your sense about that tension can is there some rule</p>
<p>for regulation of currency you yeah is there like is the government the enemy of digital currency</p>
<p>of distributed currency or can they be like cautious friends i mean i think like</p>
<p>like the one thing that people forget is that it&rsquo;s clearly not entirely an enemy because i think</p>
<p>if uh there hadn&rsquo;t been so much government regulation on and if centralized uh issuing</p>
<p>centralized digital currencies then i like we&rsquo;d be seeing things people like google and facebook</p>
<p>and twitter just kind of issuing them left and right and then like if that was the case then</p>
<p>decentralized currencies would still appeal to some people but they definitely would appeal to</p>
<p>less people than today so even in that sense i think it&rsquo;s uh clearly been kind of more of a help</p>
<p>just kind of set the stage for the end of the existence as a of the sector in some ways but</p>
<p>also and i think some of both you know like there&rsquo;s definitely things that governments</p>
<p>and if can do in some cases have done to have hurt the spread of uh and of growth of uh of</p>
<p>blockchains there&rsquo;s uh things that they&rsquo;ve done to help and they&rsquo;ve uh in some cases definitely done</p>
<p>a good job of kind of going after fraudulent projects and going after some of the projects</p>
<p>that have some of the kind of craziest and most misleading marketing um there&rsquo;s uh also the</p>
<p>possibility that governments will end up using blockchains for a lot of different things like</p>
<p>you know governments yeah i mean they do a lot more than just regulating right like there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>like they have the kind of identity records and they have kind of like property registries</p>
<p>even just their own currency is like secure like lots of different kind of things that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>operating and there&rsquo;s even blockchain applications in a lot of those yeah and they can you know they</p>
<p>can leverage technology do a lot of good for our societies it is a little unfortunate that</p>
<p>governments often lag behind in terms of their acceptance and leverage of technology if you look</p>
<p>at the autonomous vehicle space ai in general they&rsquo;re uh they&rsquo;re a few years behind it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>nice uh to help them catch up that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a always ongoing problem you um met</p>
<p>vladimir putin to discuss the centralized currency here you&rsquo;re born in the where were you born</p>
<p>columbia it&rsquo;s a city about 115 kilometers south of moscow in russia yes yeah i grew up in moscow</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s vladimir putin is a is a central figure in this part of the world so what was</p>
<p>that like meeting or meeting him what was that experience like he&rsquo;s taller in photos than in</p>
<p>person yeah he&rsquo;s yeah that&rsquo;s right he&rsquo;s 57 i think 58 maybe yeah that&rsquo;s uh unfortunately we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t actually kind of have too much of a chance to talk to him like i managed to see him for about</p>
<p>one minute at the end of this meeting and i did get a chance to see a lot like some of the other</p>
<p>end of government ministers and like he recommended some and uh some of them are are actually</p>
<p>kind of interested in trying to use um like blockchains to like for various government</p>
<p>use cases they kind of limit corruption and other things and i have like it&rsquo;s hard to tell from one</p>
<p>conversation kind of what things are genuine and what things are just like oh blockchain is cool</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do blockchain right but you know when i when i listen to like um barack obama talk about</p>
<p>artificial intelligence there&rsquo;s certain things i hear where okay so he might not be an expert in</p>
<p>ai but he know he like actually studied it carefully enough to think about it like he</p>
<p>internally like uh even if he&rsquo;s just reading a wikipedia page like he really thought about what</p>
<p>this technology means did you get a sense that uh putin or some of the ministers like thought about</p>
<p>blockchain like thought about the fundamentals of technical like understand it intuitively</p>
<p>are they too old school to try to grasp it some are old school some are more new school</p>
<p>it depends it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely like depends on who you talk to i mean that&rsquo;s an open question</p>
<p>for me with putin because putin has said i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;ve only talked to him for about one minute</p>
<p>so but sometimes you can pick up sort of insights there&rsquo;s a quick comment there they&rsquo;re about maybe</p>
<p>you can correct me on this but they&rsquo;re about 3000 cryptocurrencies being actively traded yes uh and</p>
<p>ethereum is one of you know a lot of people believe that there will be the the main cryptocurrency i</p>
<p>think bitcoin is currently still the main cryptocurrency but ethereum very likely might</p>
<p>become that the the main one um is this kind of diversity good in the crypto world do you see it</p>
<p>sticking around should there should there be a winner like should there be some consensus globally</p>
<p>around uh bitcoin or around ethereum like what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your sense i definitely think the</p>
<p>diversity is good and i definitely think also that there&rsquo;s probably too many people trying to</p>
<p>make separate blockchains kind of right now the number should definitely be greater than one and</p>
<p>probably greater than two or even five um not three thousand not three thousand yeah and also</p>
<p>not even like 40 high quality platforms that try to do the same thing i mean there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>this range from just like one person who just like wrongly thinks that you can create a cryptocurrency</p>
<p>in like 12 hours and uh doesn&rsquo;t even think about kind of the community aspects of maintaining it</p>
<p>going to uh people actually trying but only creating a really tiny one to like scammers</p>
<p>to people like making something that&rsquo;s actually successful and then there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>categories of blockchain and you have project in terms of what it&rsquo;s trying to do and what</p>
<p>applications it&rsquo;s for um and i think the experimentation is definitely healthy</p>
<p>if you look at the two worlds it might be a little bit disjoint but uh the distributed</p>
<p>applications cryptocurrency and then the world of artificial intelligence do you see there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>overlap between these worlds that both worry about centralized control is there some overlap that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting that you think about do you think about ai much yeah and i think uh definitely</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d have thought about things like in like the ai and if control problems and alignment problems and</p>
<p>all of those things do you worry about the existential threat of ai it&rsquo;s definitely one</p>
<p>of the things i worry about they think um block there&rsquo;s a lot of uh kind of common challenges</p>
<p>because in in both cases what you&rsquo;re ultimately trying to do is you&rsquo;re trying to kind of get a</p>
<p>simple system to direct a more complex system like in the case of uh this is drawing ai&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>idea would be that the simple system is people and the complex system is well whatever um thing</p>
<p>uh the people uh the people end up kind of unleashing on the universe that&rsquo;ll hopefully be</p>
<p>a great thing um and in the case of blockchains and of the complex well the simple thing is uh</p>
<p>the algorithm which is a piece of static and fully open source code and the more complex thing is</p>
<p>just the all of the different possible kind of human actors and the end of the strategy is that</p>
<p>they might end up used to participate in the network do you think about your own mortality</p>
<p>like what you hope to accomplish in your life oh i definitely i definitely think about ending my</p>
<p>own mortality so that&rsquo;s if i gave you the option to live forever would you depends a lot on what</p>
<p>the fine birds is but i mean you know if it&rsquo;s one of those things where i&rsquo;m going to be kind</p>
<p>of like floating through empty space for 10 to the 75 years then no if it&rsquo;s uh um forever worth</p>
<p>of uh and of having you know fulfilling life with uh and of meaning like with with friends to uh to</p>
<p>spend the time with with kind of meaningful challenges to explore and individual interesting</p>
<p>things to be working on then i think absolutely move that&rsquo;s uh beautifully put live forever</p>
<p>but uh you&rsquo;d have to check the fine print i think there&rsquo;s no better way to end it vitalik</p>
<p>thank you so much for talking to us so exciting to follow your work from a distance and uh thank</p>
<p>you for creating a revolutionary idea and sticking with it and building it out and doing some</p>
<p>incredible engineering work and thanks for talking today yeah thank you thanks for listening to this</p>

<p>twitter at lex friedman and now let me leave you with some words from vitalik buterin the thing</p>
<p>that i often ask startups on top of ethereum is can you please tell me why using ethereum blockchain</p>
<p>is better than using excel and if they can come up with a good answer that&rsquo;s when you know you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got something really interesting thank you for listening and hope to see you next time</p>
