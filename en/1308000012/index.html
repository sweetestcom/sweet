    <p>Hello everybody. Welcome. Uh, we are live at the all-in headquarters</p>
<p>And the all-in podcast is now live. We have 63 people watching already</p>
<p>And bear with us while we get the besties on the line. I&rsquo;ll be doing my introductions in just a moment after I tweet this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But it is an eventful night and we had to start early</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s looking like this could be another shocker</p>
<p>And I am not uh being facetious here. I am not</p>
<p>Happy about this obviously</p>
<p>But uh trump looks like he&rsquo;s been underestimated again. This is not a blowout</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>We are going live early</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>This could be a shocker folks</p>
<p>Okay, so uh with me early on the pod is regular david friedberg</p>
<p>Uh david you&rsquo;re watching this early action</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s your early uh reaction to what we&rsquo;re seeing?</p>
<p>Um, you know</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s moved</p>
<p>We there&rsquo;s nothing definitive yet, but uh, he&rsquo;s moved. Uh in the results and he&rsquo;s moving markets</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing forex markets show a sharp indication</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>That trump has a real shot at winning here</p>
<p>treasury markets</p>
<p>And as phil helmuth will share with us betting markets as well</p>
<p>So it is more it is more of a nail-biter. Um, then game seven of the warriors calves</p>
<p>So here we go</p>
<p>Hell of a nail</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hell of a nail biter guys, and i&rsquo;m just going to say this. Uh, the uk markets had it first</p>
<p>They he was five to two, uh, you could you could get trump at five to two two and a half to one</p>
<p>Then it hit five to four and I thought that was quite</p>
<p>Crazy, you&rsquo;re watching cnn. You&rsquo;re watching these networks and they&rsquo;re saying oh my god. Biden&rsquo;s winning this</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not even in the right neighborhood. I&rsquo;ll never watch a network again on election night and now</p>
<p>the market from five minutes ago</p>
<p>368 million pounds</p>
<p>wagered 368 million pounds</p>
<p>Trump is now a three to ten</p>
<p>Favorite okay. So for people, uh phil who are not gamblers if you bet three dollars you bet three dollars</p>
<p>No, no jason you have to understand if you bet 13</p>
<p>Okay, you don&rsquo;t get 13 back. You only get uh 10 back</p>
<p>Okay. Now if you want to bet biden, it&rsquo;s seven to four. So if I bet 70</p>
<p>Uh, if I bet 40 I can get 70</p>
<p>Back on biden now the shocker is right around 6 28 p.m</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>The betting odds the markets have been in biden&rsquo;s favor for three straight months</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been live posting them on my twitter all day</p>
<p>The worst I saw was uh was trump was uh was biden was minus a dollar 25 still a big favorite to win and then boom</p>
<p>And uh, you know, there are people in my house that are actually crying</p>
<p>Uh, you know, i&rsquo;m very more much more in the middle of this thing</p>
<p>But all of a sudden, uh trump</p>
<p>All of a sudden it was five to four then it was even and then all of a sudden trump was nearly a two-to-one favorite</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting live information from my friends right now</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;m seeing that uh</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s a little bit lower on some of these sites</p>
<p>Um, I saw 267 that&rsquo;s for a 200 dollar bet. So he&rsquo;s a pretty big favorite</p>
<p>Um, I saw the lowest i&rsquo;ve seen is 217</p>
<p>But jason if you&rsquo;re watching the odds and I put some stuff on my twitter, it&rsquo;s amazing how it went from you know</p>
<p>minus a dollar 70</p>
<p>You know all the way down minus a 30 then it came all the way up to minus a dollar 70</p>
<p>This is crazy and and i&rsquo;ve seen this movie before in 2016 actually</p>
<p>Okay, so we all know that you need 270 electoral votes to win</p>
<p>And that there were a couple of states that were critical</p>
<p>for trump to win</p>
<p>And it seems like those states that trump was critical to win</p>
<p>He has now won so let&rsquo;s bring in david sacks</p>
<p>Uh david, we just turned on the live stream</p>
<p>And boy, is this a turn of events that I don&rsquo;t think any of us except for maybe you</p>
<p>But you were very pessimistic on the last maybe three or four</p>
<p>All in podcasts you&rsquo;re watching these results come in the betting markets have totally flipped to trump</p>
<p>What are you seeing and what can we expect tonight? What are you looking for?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s looking just like</p>
<ol start="2016">
<li>Um, I mean you&rsquo;re right that</li>
</ol>
<p>I was looking at the polls in the last few pods that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and there was no way to say anything other than you know, trump was the</p>
<p>uh was the underdog, um, but at the same time, I I still thought that</p>
<p>Um trump had a really good shot because I was watching</p>
<p>Both candidates, you know on youtube all the time. They both were doing live events. I wasn&rsquo;t watching it with the commentary</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t watching the clips. I was watching trump do these rallies. I was watching</p>
<p>Biden do these parking lot events</p>
<p>And I would see trump do four five events a day flying from</p>
<p>Um tarmac to tarmac on air force one having these huge crowds. I saw him do this event in</p>
<p>Butler pennsylvania over the weekend. It looked to me like there was tens of thousands of people there</p>
<p>um, and I remember trump saying a line like, you know, this doesn&rsquo;t seem like a second place crowd and</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s one of those trump lines, but you know, it did put in my mind this idea, you know, he&rsquo;s got a point</p>
<p>Um, whatever the polls say we&rsquo;re seeing tens of thousands of people show up at these events who are fanatical</p>
<p>I mean just fanatical</p>
<p>For trump and so you always had to think that he had a chance of pulling off an upset</p>
<p>Just like 2016. I will say what I said on our text earlier</p>
<p>donald trump</p>
<p>Ate the covid virus and killed it with his body</p>
<p>And then he stood in front of the white house and ripped his shirt off and let us all know that he is our leader</p>
<p>He did not get elected. He claimed victory</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016 and he has not and will not let go</p>
<p>Since then and I think it is that</p>
<p>um cult of personality</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>Draws so many people in that are just um</p>
<p>You know feeling like they need change and they need leadership and they don&rsquo;t need something from the old school and</p>
<p>He uh, he stood up and he showed us that this whole thing is a fake. Covid is a fake</p>
<p>Government is fake. The people are fake. The media is fake</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the only guy late numbers. I&rsquo;m getting some late numbers here you guys</p>
<p>Um, he&rsquo;s now a minus a dollar 59 to win pennsylvania and they took every other number off the board</p>
<p>however, if you&rsquo;re a biden person jason, uh, the number is only</p>
<p>2.17 right now</p>
<p>um, so, uh</p>
<p>But wow, the polls are pollsters were miles off on this</p>
<p>And this is just amazing</p>
<p>And it seems like from what we&rsquo;re hearing from the reporting is that the pollsters did not understand</p>
<p>Uh the latin or I guess latinx is a way to describe</p>
<p>um a group of people who actually don&rsquo;t think exactly the same i&rsquo;ve always had a</p>
<p>A weird, um understanding of this term latinx, which seems to come from the woke left</p>
<p>but cubans</p>
<p>puerto ricans</p>
<p>Mexicans, these are different countries. They&rsquo;re not all the same as waylands</p>
<p>Venezuelans, this is not a monoculture</p>
<p>Just because they all speak the same language and we&rsquo;re seeing something very different happen in florida right now. We&rsquo;re male</p>
<p>Uh cubans maybe are voting very differently than what pollsters expected</p>
<p>Uh bestie chamath is now fresh off a tight haircut and he&rsquo;s here on the pod. Can you hear me?</p>
<p>Uh, we&rsquo;ve got bestie phil as our first bestie guestie of the night bestie p. How are you bestie p?</p>
<p>Chamath you and I we shouldn&rsquo;t talk about this</p>
<p>This is about politics, but you and I were just filming high stakes poker in las vegas on friday night</p>
<p>It was great to see you bestie</p>
<p>Is there any indication you can give us besides?</p>
<p>I mean, of course, there&rsquo;s a presidential election that is going to determine the future of humanity</p>
<p>But more importantly, how did you each do in the high stakes poker game?</p>
<p>the biggest the biggest the biggest part of the night was</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>400k, maybe 500k played between me and dur</p>
<p>Yeah, and he won</p>
<p>He did not win the hint. Oh my lord. Chamath won that one go</p>
<p>Oh my lord</p>
<p>And uh, it was I think it was beautifully beautifully played. I think</p>
<p>Doug polk will definitely do a short video clip on it. Uh, I did a</p>
<p>I did a very uh, very sneaky</p>
<p>three bet pre-flop turn check</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>River over bluff and got him to call</p>
<p>Oh my lord</p>
<p>A little set bomb i&rsquo;m guessing but here we go. Uh, jason. I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>Uh since i&rsquo;m here to promote promote promote everything I promote, uh</p>
<p>You can only watch these episodes of high stakes poker a lot of players favorite show</p>
<p>You can only watch them on the poker go app. They&rsquo;re coming out. December 16th. Meet chamath phil ivy tom duan</p>
<p>Ben lamb a lot of your a lot of your heroes take it away. Oh, well, can&rsquo;t wait. Can&rsquo;t wait to uh,</p>
<p>And I have a subscription to that all in. Um, i&rsquo;m sorry the poker go app. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s well worth it</p>
<p>Uh david sacks you have one of your i&rsquo;m recording</p>
<p>Friends on the pod. Why don&rsquo;t you introduce?</p>
<p>Uh, one of your consulting friends and and uh, we&rsquo;ll have him t up</p>
<p>What we think the possible scenarios are and where we&rsquo;re at right now at this very moment</p>
<p>It is</p>
<p>657 in california. Yeah, so michael newman works for me as a researcher and um</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>As a political scientist, I guess you could say and i&rsquo;ve known him since college and he&rsquo;s very uh,</p>
<p>Steeped in these, uh, a lot of these races. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Yeah, I have been obsessively following politics since uh, the reagan election of 1980</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I I I I wasn&rsquo;t alive then so</p>
<p>No, i&rsquo;m afraid i&rsquo;m, uh, I I was only 10, but I was already</p>
<p>Uh a political obsessive and as you can imagine a real hit with the ladies as well</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>tell us what</p>
<p>What are the key states we need to focus in on here and which one of them?</p>
<p>uh have enough reporting for us to</p>
<p>Sort of put them in a column and then move on and understand the path to victory for trump</p>
<p>Or biden. Yes. Well, I mean, uh</p>
<p>Depending upon which network or news organization you&rsquo;re following</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re either calling calling a lot of states or they&rsquo;re being very conservative about their calls</p>
<p>I mean nbc has still not called florida for trump</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s really no path for biden to win that state</p>
<p>Uh, so you can put that safely in the trump column</p>
<p>He has just taken the lead in north carolina after trailing all night</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got about 88 of the vote in now</p>
<p>And I suspect he&rsquo;s home free as is the republican incumbent senator there</p>
<p>Can I can I just can I just ask a question? I mean, isn&rsquo;t it typically the case that the</p>
<p>counts from the most populous</p>
<p>Urban areas come last and those tend to skew more democrat than republican</p>
<p>That sometimes happens. Uh, it depends on the state. Um</p>
<p>Some states have their rural areas come in last</p>
<p>one of the things that has changed the vote in north carolina is as the early vote came in as the</p>
<p>Uh in-person early vote and mail-in ballots came in the last counties that reported that early vote were the rural counties</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why early on it looked very good for biden and now it looks</p>
<p>Like, uh, it&rsquo;s trending away from him. Well, wait a second north carolina according to the new york times and according to</p>
<p>um cnn right now is favoring</p>
<p>Slightly biden 49.7 to 49.1 for trump with 84</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite current. I think they&rsquo;re up to about 88</p>
<p>88 but again, yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very close. What&rsquo;s interesting is</p>
<p>Uh biden had five potential states where he could have knocked trump out</p>
<p>florida, georgia, north carolina, ohio, and texas</p>
<p>We are off the table</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t yeah florida&rsquo;s off the table. The others are still on the table</p>
<p>But none of them are trending biden&rsquo;s direction at the present time</p>
<p>so he uh</p>
<p>Yeah, so far trump is uh</p>
<p>Is staying in the hand is uh as you poker players would would say he&rsquo;s uh, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Uh, he&rsquo;s getting the cards. He needs to stay in the to stay in the game</p>
<p>Uh, but we still have the river to play and the river would be in this case, michigan wisconsin pennsylvania</p>
<p>texas</p>
<p>Had an early lead for biden, which was crazy to see</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s got donald trump at 50.3</p>
<p>Biden at 48.3 guys again. So that&rsquo;s starting to normalize</p>
<p>I I go back to this one very critical thing</p>
<p>the reason why michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania right now are trump is because you count the</p>
<p>The when the county is counted you can pass the votes and you can report and if you have 25 000 people in a county</p>
<p>versus allegheny county, which has like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know hundreds of thousands or a million plus people. It just takes longer</p>
<p>Yes. No, I listen. I don&rsquo;t characterize michigan wisconsin pennsylvania at all</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons why michigan right now looks so red is because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re counting</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s vote first a lot of these other states that like florida that had the</p>
<p>Option because their legislature allows them to do this. They counted all that early vote in advance and they dumped it in one big pile</p>
<p>Uh as soon as the polls closed in the in the various counties</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you saw early on a blue mirage there</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re seeing in a place like michigan right now is probably a red mirage</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s vote which was going to skew trump</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Because of the because of the way he presented it to his people. He uh, florida was the one state</p>
<p>uh, thank goodness for his uh sake that he</p>
<p>Encouraged people to vote early and by mail in the other states. He encouraged his people to vote today</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a here&rsquo;s a stat in pennsylvania. I&rsquo;m on the um</p>
<p>Secretary of state&rsquo;s reporting dashboard. They&rsquo;ve counted only 12 percent of the mail-in ballots</p>
<p>Um, which is and the total mail-in ballots is 2.5 million</p>
<p>Yeah, um, which is huge right and they&rsquo;ve only it should be a majority of the vote. I would imagine. Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve only and they&rsquo;ve only counted</p>
<p>24 actually, sorry. They&rsquo;ve only</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ve only counted a handful of precincts at this point</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>a quarter of the precincts</p>
<p>Right. So here&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t understand. So, uh, nick, uh carlson from uh, was it like business insider?</p>
<p>He just tweeted</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>minutes ago</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>North carolina biden is ahead with 99 of the vote counted and biden has a less than 0.2 percent lead</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s 9 000 votes. Well that I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>That would be a huge problem for trump</p>
<p>He lost north carolina. I listen I think a loss in any of those five states, florida, georgia, north carolina</p>
<p>Ohio or texas is probably shout out by the way guys</p>
<p>I just want to give a shout out to nothing who&rsquo;s listening here all the way from sri lanka. He&rsquo;s listening. He just texted me</p>
<p>Okay as much by the way guys</p>
<p>Right now the odds are three to one on the betting market</p>
<p>So I mean obviously the networks I realized are completely useless</p>
<p>I stopped watching him a long time ago when they had biden way ahead in florida</p>
<p>And the odds were 10 to 1 against right now</p>
<p>If you want to bet trump is a three to one favorite on and there&rsquo;s been billions of dollars spent in england australia</p>
<p>All over the world. He&rsquo;s a three to one favorite. It looks like it&rsquo;s real to me</p>
<p>And just to and just to just to build your side of the case</p>
<p>Uh nasdaq futures ripping s&amp;p futures falling and the 10 and 30 year falling remember ripping</p>
<p>These are all pro trump trades and and the euro the euro collapse the euro dollar falling uh falling sharply</p>
<p>Once the markets turn towards trump. Well, here&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re reacting to is wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania</p>
<p>Trump is all up big time</p>
<p>Now again, this this that lacks a very basic understanding of how county reporting is happening in these highly populous, you know</p>
<p>or these sort of sorry these these uh</p>
<p>bimodally distributed states where they have a bunch of suburban and rural vote that&rsquo;s fast to count and</p>
<p>The big places for example, like, you know, you&rsquo;re not going to see milwaukee and green bay report until probably close to midnight</p>
<p>So you have another two hours. So the question is why why are the betting markets so pro trump then?</p>
<p>What do they know that we don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>I will say this. Let me say this jason</p>
<p>I mean if you&rsquo;re like there you&rsquo;re talking about billions of dollars, right?</p>
<p>And so all you had to do was design a system</p>
<p>To figure out how to calculate votes earlier and make a couple hundred million dollars</p>
<p>Okay, these are the smartest people in the world. There&rsquo;s hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars at stake</p>
<p>They obviously do it 10 times better than any other site than any other network</p>
<p>So this information, I mean I give a friend of mine posted. Hey, i&rsquo;m laying two to one on uh on twitter guys</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buying my other friend bet four hundred thousand dollars to eight hundred thousand dollars trump and now he looks like a genius</p>
<p>Somebody knows something that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>Well trump just on bovada trump just moved to minus 600</p>
<p>Yeah, he just took michigan on</p>
<p>Unbelievable minus it looks like he&rsquo;s uh, it looks like he&rsquo;s ahead in michigan</p>
<p>But again, we have to see detroit and there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a bunch of places in michigan. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s look at the north. So here&rsquo;s the north carolina secretary of state dashboard</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re showing uh, two-thirds of the counties and you can actually see by county when you go onto their their dashboard</p>
<p>The um</p>
<p>You know jamaat the larger counties are partially reported. Most of the smaller counties are fully reported</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>63 total</p>
<p>with um</p>
<p>You know biden ahead by literally a thousand votes right now across 2.5 to 2 million to 2.5 to 1 million. Wow</p>
<p>What percent</p>
<p>Reported is that I mean, it&rsquo;s 63</p>
<p>Of the counties have completely reported</p>
<p>And so the remaining counties if you look at the reporting status the remaining counties that are partially reported</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mix of rural and some of the urban counties, you know durham&rsquo;s in there partially reported</p>
<p>Uh, so there is a mix. It&rsquo;s not durham should be a biden county. The research triangle is uh upscale</p>
<p>well-educated professionals</p>
<p>That I think are the the backbone of the democrats</p>
<p>uh coalition in a state like north carolina</p>
<p>Now they have um absentee votes that are counted</p>
<p>And they have so far counted</p>
<p>3.3 million</p>
<p>Absentee one-stop votes</p>
<p>And a million votes by mail, but that&rsquo;s how many came in. It actually shows that only</p>
<p>Five oh, I see. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Trump trump is now ahead in ohio</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the votes were post the link into the zoom chat. So nick can pull it up on the screen, please</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I need to get an understanding of something very basic here for the audience who&rsquo;s not degenerate gamblers</p>
<p>Are is there a chance here phil and chamath gambling experts both?</p>
<p>That people had put early money on biden</p>
<p>And are now covering or hedging some of those bets. Is that a possibility here? Yes</p>
<p>Okay, jason. Jason. The line is minus a dollar minus four ten on pinnacle right now</p>
<p>Let me just double check that source. So what what phil is saying? Jason is like yes, there&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of</p>
<p>Essentially covering now that covering will swing the line</p>
<p>But I think what phil is also saying is when a line moves this violently literally what we&rsquo;ve seen in the last 35 minutes</p>
<p>Is both the equity markets the currency markets and the betting markets flip?</p>
<p>180 degrees from where they have been not just all day</p>
<p>But frankly where they had been probably for the last few months</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was saying chamath for three months straight</p>
<p>Uh right now biden has been a favorite anywhere between three to one favorite at one point</p>
<p>All the way to maybe you know 50 percent favorite and all of a sudden today</p>
<p>The lowest I saw was a dollar 35 and I was kind of shocked and the next thing, you know, boom</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s a three to four to one favorite</p>
<p>So and and i&rsquo;m looking at cnn and i&rsquo;m looking at these networks and they&rsquo;re still they still have biden ahead and i&rsquo;m like wow</p>
<p>What is going on? They&rsquo;re way behind. That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the next thing. We need to take care of chamath</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a business for you is somehow we can deliver the right data on elections quickly. There you go</p>
<p>yeah, well, I think the betting markets know something we don&rsquo;t know because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Trump is just you know, if you look at like the live stream on twitter or the new york times or something</p>
<p>Trump just slightly took the lead in</p>
<p>Ohio</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the state he&rsquo;s supposed to win in north carolina</p>
<p>It looks like with over 99 reporting it looks like he lost by 9 000 votes</p>
<p>By the way, a 9 000 vote margin would probably trigger an automatic recount of north carolina</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like a hundred thousand absentee ballots there, I don&rsquo;t know if those have been counted yet</p>
<p>Okay, so i&rsquo;m gonna let&rsquo;s pause for one second on this everybody north carolina is one of the four or five states</p>
<p>Trump has to win</p>
<p>In order to have a victory right michael. I I absolutely agree with that</p>
<p>He had to have those five florida north carolina, georgia, ohio and texas. Okay, so we have florida</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got now there&rsquo;s four left. There&rsquo;s four left. Georgia&rsquo;s a very slow counting state</p>
<p>We really don&rsquo;t know all of atlanta could be out for all we know</p>
<p>But so we leave georgia on the side. So now we got four states we can work with north carolina</p>
<p>is in</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s pocket by just a hair</p>
<p>Yeah, that could change and it would trigger a recount which would take days to weeks</p>
<p>Yes, the other three states. Let&rsquo;s go through them systematically one by one michael. Okay, uh, ohio</p>
<p>Uh was the biggest surprise of the night when biden built an early lead there? Although again</p>
<p>a bit of a blue mirage based upon</p>
<p>Uh the fact that the mail-in vote and the early vote came in so strong for the democrats this year</p>
<p>Uh, because they emphasized it and the republicans kind of fought against it</p>
<p>Uh, but michael michael with 49 of the vote in ohio</p>
<p>Okay, he had a right now biden had a massive lead and he had about a 400 000 vote lead without the correct</p>
<p>And when you look at the betting odds, he was five to one underdog to win the state</p>
<p>So something doesn&rsquo;t add up there and you can you can say all right</p>
<p>Some of that is all the early voting went for biden. We know that to be a fact, but there&rsquo;s something else there</p>
<p>okay, i&rsquo;m just looking at the</p>
<p>Uh results for ohio. We&rsquo;ll stay on ohio for one more moment</p>
<p>And then we have another guest who just jumped on ohio</p>
<p>Is currently showing donald trump with two point</p>
<p>Rounding it up 2.4 million votes to 2.2 million slightly rounding up for joe biden</p>
<p>52 percent to 47</p>
<p>With 78 percent reporting does that mean we feel comfortable with?</p>
<p>trump</p>
<p>uh winning</p>
<p>Ohio unless all of cleveland is outstanding. I would say that&rsquo;s a trump state. Yeah</p>
<p>Okay, we now have john cohen on the line. John is</p>
<p>a uh</p>
<p>Member of the survey monkey team john. Welcome to the all-in pod. Can you hear us?</p>
<p>Thank you so much. I i&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t hear what was going on. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;ve been disparaging pollsters so far</p>
<p>Um, so let me know. Well, we were waiting for you. We&rsquo;re waiting to get here</p>
<p>Tell us as we start what your prediction was earlier today</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re very clear to say that we&rsquo;re doing measurements not predictions</p>
<p>Okay, that said the measurements that we are doing clearly pointed to biden advantages across the board</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t have we so far we have no surprises, you know, we had florida</p>
<p>Had been trump plus two basically all week going to dead even</p>
<p>Um, you know coming into election day itself. We don&rsquo;t know where the final votes will be</p>
<p>Most analysts think that it&rsquo;s in trump&rsquo;s camp. It may end up there, but it&rsquo;s super close. We had georgia close</p>
<p>We had north carolina close although and north carolina had been closing. It had been a big biden lead</p>
<p>It was down to under two points</p>
<p>Um with the senate, you know kind of even closer than that in some of our data</p>
<p>So, you know so far there&rsquo;s no obvious surprise. You&rsquo;re like damn the polls were really wrong. Certainly ours</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s our it&rsquo;s early though. We&rsquo;re not declaring victory on those</p>
<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot to watch but nothing really to surprise. Um, you know us given the numbers so far</p>
<p>What about ohio and georgia?</p>
<p>So we had ohio pretty consistently in trump&rsquo;s camp. We had him up four. So it&rsquo;s trending that way now</p>
<p>We had it as close as two points for trump. I mean again, I haven&rsquo;t mentioned the word margin of error</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in my professional</p>
<p>Obligation and duty to mention it. It&rsquo;s around three points. I believe two and a half in ohio</p>
<p>So close, but we always had it in trump&rsquo;s camp again biden</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t part of biden&rsquo;s, you know, any of the past victory that the campaign was counting on so</p>
<p>You know no big deal, but we went from having a early night to now</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re sure for sure and for a really late night here</p>
<p>John, um, let me ask you the one of the most basic questions that i&rsquo;ve had which is</p>
<p>What did we learn from 2016 and tell me what exactly did people try to fix? Like what was the thing that?</p>
<p>Everybody got wrong</p>
<p>And what changed?</p>
<p>Well, the biggest thing that polls fixed was how they adjust their polls by education</p>
<p>What we see in polling no matter how they&rsquo;re conducted whether online as we do at survey monkey</p>
<p>Or still on the telephone which most media pollsters do</p>
<p>Is you get people with more formal education to answer those surveys in far greater proportions than you do people with lower education</p>
<p>So the biggest thing you&rsquo;ve got to do and look we always did it</p>
<p>So we weren&rsquo;t in the among the state pollsters who kind of failed I think, um, you know kind of</p>
<p>negligently to</p>
<p>Adjust by education at all. We always adjust by education</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve what we failed to notice in 2016</p>
<p>Was there was an increasing gap between those with postgraduate degrees and those with bas?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve always been both to pro-democratic group, but the gap in 2016 was abnormally large</p>
<p>a fix to our polls</p>
<p>which I just point out weren&rsquo;t you know kind of were actually standouts in the in the upper midwest in terms of</p>
<p>Showing it as a close race not clear of clinton victories</p>
<p>We broke apart postgrads and grads into two distinct categories and that released kind of about a point and a half of unforced error</p>
<p>In our polling for 2016, so that&rsquo;s fixed. We&rsquo;ve used it to good effect again this time around</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t showing what all the other national polls were showing we&rsquo;ve had this between a four and six point national lead again</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get quickly into why national results don&rsquo;t matter, but you all know that all too</p>
<p>Well, everyone knows that all too well</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve had it kind of more narrow and that plays out in the states that I mentioned</p>
<p>We had florida tied not a four point biden five point biden</p>
<p>Advantage elsewhere, you know, but we&rsquo;ll see how it plays out in the midwest. We also had wisconsin</p>
<p>What was our final margin there?</p>
<p>I think it was, you know kind of nine and nine and a half points</p>
<p>Not the 17 points that you saw from my former colleagues at the washington post and abc news</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve always had it a little bit tighter</p>
<p>But again, it plays how it&rsquo;s going to play out in these states and so far no surprises</p>
<p>But the night is early and i&rsquo;m I have a healthy dose of pollsters paranoia jamal</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that answered your question well enough, but that was the main thing people did</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really helpful. But now take off your pollster measure, you know, chief research officer hat for a second</p>
<p>And put on just the american hat. Um</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>When you know, we had effectively a repudiation of the establishment in 2016</p>
<p>And despite everything that&rsquo;s happened over the last four years</p>
<p>We may be on the brink of another repudiation again if you</p>
<p>You know where you&rsquo;re there to measure the pulse of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>but less in</p>
<p>Sort of measurement speak and just more in just plain american english speak john</p>
<p>What like what&rsquo;s going on if this happens again?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re absolutely right there&rsquo;s something major I would also like to caveat it</p>
<p>We are looking once again at if trump wins it&rsquo;s because of the electoral college</p>
<p>Like he is going to lose the popular vote</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still far more americans and american voters who voted today and you know kind of over the past several weeks</p>
<p>Who would prefer joe biden to be president?</p>
<p>So again, we can&rsquo;t characterize with a broad brush the american voting population when this is about effectively</p>
<p>I hate to call it a quirk, but this is about our system of vote tallying and the president</p>
<p>You know that to pull back your point about kind of there is something major here the fact that many people, you know</p>
<p>Some of us might be friends with can&rsquo;t understand why this is an 100 to 0 race fail to understand that the president&rsquo;s base isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Small it is, you know, we&rsquo;ve had it 44 to 46</p>
<p>Approving of his job performance for many years now like he has a completely durable solid floor</p>
<p>He also has a high ceiling, right?</p>
<p>So he was never going to win the popular vote this time around but he had a chance at that electoral</p>
<p>You know squeaking out another electoral college win because he&rsquo;s been so stable, you know, this is a president who?</p>
<p>You know kind of up trump now had an nc. Thank you for uh the chat window</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re right that we need to understand more about what is the componentry of that 45?</p>
<p>That they would support trump when the other 55 are so dead set against him and see it as something really wrong with the country</p>
<p>So we still what I mean</p>
<p>No, I what have you guys done to though understand?</p>
<p>The people that are voting for trump better because I think that they are</p>
<p>protesting</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re protesting a lot</p>
<p>And I think that you know, if we didn&rsquo;t listen to him in 16, I think it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>Criminal to not listen to them in 2020</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>What are they what are they saying?</p>
<p>What are they rejecting or what is it that they want because at the end of the day, you know</p>
<p>I think his incompetence can&rsquo;t really be debated competence versus incompetence</p>
<p>I think what we can debate is he&rsquo;s a vessel and in that I think that it&rsquo;s incredibly important</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening irrespective of what happens today because we were supposed to walk into a landslide</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not as you said, we&rsquo;re going to be in a nail biter</p>
<p>What is what are what are they using him as a vessel to communicate to everybody else?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good question. I mean some of</p>
<p>That will depend on you know</p>
<p>A closer analysis of the surveys ours where we talk to more than a million voters and the exit polls</p>
<p>That are being conducted by two separate organizations today</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the what are the storylines that come out of the election?</p>
<p>You know, one of the things that&rsquo;s being reported early is there&rsquo;s a much tighter hispanic vote in florida than many early polls</p>
<p>You know predicted how will that play out as we start to get votes, you know coming out in texas</p>
<p>How does it be in arizona? See arizona looking positively for?</p>
<p>Biden and mark kelly in the senate, you know in arizona</p>
<p>You know kind of is it is it really hispanic votes that are driving some trump strength in these states?</p>
<p>Or you kind of is it the obsession that the news media has had for the past four years around the kind of trump middle-aged</p>
<p>white male voter with less than college education who has been displaced by</p>
<p>You know technological and industrial trends over the past 20 years</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to depend on what that voting coalition looks like for trump and it&rsquo;s more diverse than I think we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>Focusing on for four years. I think you&rsquo;re saying an incredibly important thing</p>
<p>I think that that was a ruse and i&rsquo;ve always thought that that was bullshit. It&rsquo;s not some</p>
<p>Under-educated rube that&rsquo;s running around voting for this guy</p>
<p>um, I think that there are there are people up and down the</p>
<p>The age spectrum the socio-economic spectrum</p>
<p>And this is what I mean by he has become a vessel for so many different messages</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I think we really have to start figuring out what the hell these messages actually mean because</p>
<p>If biden loses to your point, maybe in florida, it&rsquo;s a repudiation of socialism</p>
<p>Okay, but in pennsylvania, it&rsquo;s going to be something else in michigan. It&rsquo;s going to be something else in ohio</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be something else</p>
<p>For him to keep winning, right?</p>
<p>um, and and I just don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a consistent idea and it&rsquo;s very dismissive to say that i&rsquo;m not saying you are</p>
<p>But i&rsquo;m saying, you know that idea that it was</p>
<p>An out-of-work ex-factory worker, you know in rural. Ohio that was protesting</p>
<p>This is going to be much bigger than that because even if biden wins the popular vote</p>
<p>Until we figure out how to rebalance balance the electoral college in a completely, you know</p>
<p>New way or just get rid of it altogether</p>
<p>Um, we&rsquo;re going to have to live with understanding</p>
<p>How some folks in these extremely pivotal states?</p>
<p>Um are pushing back are they pushing back on political correctness?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s one thing that i&rsquo;ve always thought I think that there&rsquo;s a huge vote here</p>
<p>against um</p>
<p>Cancel culture, so all of that stuff. Absolutely. Absolutely</p>
<p>And and lockdowns, I think those are the underreported</p>
<p>Lockdowns are the I think the biggest one of the biggest drivers</p>
<p>No, go ahead. John. Go ahead. John</p>
<p>No, I was gonna say one of the components here that we have to pay a lot of attention is gender</p>
<p>Right kind of, you know the storyline for a long time</p>
<p>And when you think about you know</p>
<p>Kind of republican democratic politics is that you know, we talk about black voters and hispanic voters talking about them as if they&rsquo;re monoliths</p>
<p>What we have seen consistently over the course of the year is that trump does</p>
<p>Much better among black men and hispanic men than he does among black women and latinas and that is just kind of like</p>
<p>You know, whereas black women are 95 5, you know, he nears 20 among black men. It blends into the what we&rsquo;ve the 90</p>
<p>Look, but I look these are measurements. These are measurements. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re telling you the whys of anything and</p>
<p>Um, I think for the whys you have to go a lot deeper</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk about the lockdown issue. Can we just pull up that?</p>
<p>Tweet nick. I mean, so this is what I said back in may. This was like months ago before the election even hit</p>
<p>You know, which is if the woke left insists on permanent lockdowns trump will have an issue that supersedes</p>
<p>The incompetence of covid response because I think you know</p>
<p>We all we all agree on that which is whether our lives and livelihoods belong to politicians to meet or out</p>
<p>In dribs and drabs as they see fit and this was back when elon was being shut out of his factory in fremont</p>
<p>And then there was this hairdresser named shelly luther in texas</p>
<p>who was basically</p>
<p>Put on trial for opening up her hair salon</p>
<p>And the the judge wanted her to to grovel and beg for forgiveness</p>
<p>And this was the beginning of the rebellion over lockdowns and it was so obvious back then</p>
<p>That lockdowns weren&rsquo;t going to fly. They weren&rsquo;t sustainable. They were too politically unpopular</p>
<p>um, they weren&rsquo;t going to work and and by the way, if it was something a cause that the left agreed with like</p>
<p>You know a blm rally or something like that. Then you were allowed to do it. You know, it was that whole standard around</p>
<p>You know doing things that were essential</p>
<p>and so, you know this insistence on lockdowns even after the public had really</p>
<p>Repudiated them I think was a major issue for for trump</p>
<p>And it was crazy to me that biden was still insisting on lockdowns</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>Still I mean that is his official position</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the only reason why he&rsquo;s in trouble right now, but I think it&rsquo;s a big one</p>
<p>I think if he if trump reaches the blue wall again of michigan wisconsin pennsylvania</p>
<p>Lockdowns is the biggest reason why because those are three states that had extensive and still have</p>
<p>Uh extensive lockdowns it hurts it hurts people i&rsquo;ll here i&rsquo;ll read you a tweet</p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t name who it&rsquo;s from it&rsquo;s from a farmer</p>
<p>in um in the corn belt who&rsquo;s well followed on twitter believe it or not, there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>Ag twitter community and he says well, it&rsquo;s the day does this country turn down the road to be like venezuela?</p>
<p>Or do we continue on the road of capitalism?</p>
<p>and um, he&rsquo;s had this acute, um feeling that he&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>Uh vocalized on twitter for for months now</p>
<p>On how painful the lockdowns have been on him and his family and his business and on the community</p>
<p>And uh, it just feels like overreach to a lot of people</p>
<p>that the recognition that um</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>The left might be using to justify the decision is just not there that the the impact the near-term impact that folks are feeling is</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s there and that&rsquo;s driving a lot of behavior right now boys all markets are now up</p>
<p>Everything is green dow futures s&amp;p 500 futures</p>
<p>Oil is up gold is down</p>
<p>And come on</p>
<p>There were some guys that made some heavy bets against the dollar going into this thinking we were going to have massive inflation</p>
<p>With biden policy coming up and um some big fund managers</p>
<p>That went really big on on shorting the dollar this last week</p>
<p>Um, and the dollar is up right now. Yeah the dollar by the way</p>
<p>We should we should make sure at some point tonight to talk about these very important senate races because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just trump versus biden that there&rsquo;s also a bunch of</p>
<p>Hickenlooper one in colorado and louber one in colorado</p>
<p>But there have been some you know, some of the republicans who look to be in big trouble like lindsey graham</p>
<p>have uh have pulled it out and have won and um</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s looking like the senate is still very much in play. I would say as big a favorite</p>
<p>As biden was the senate</p>
<p>Shifting, uh from republican to democrat. I&rsquo;d say that was considered as equally big a favorite</p>
<p>And that that may not happen now, so we should make sure to talk about that at some point north carolina right now is 49.8</p>
<p>to 49 for biden</p>
<p>2.6 million versus 2.58</p>
<p>Ohio is at 2.4</p>
<p>to 2.251</p>
<p>52 percent to 47 trump is beating biden. I um, I have a question for john cohen john</p>
<p>um, let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>Um, sort of your understanding as you&rsquo;ve been measuring different trends. Have you</p>
<p>measured</p>
<p>um people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Sympathy towards lockdowns on a state by state level and then second question is have you measured people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Sympathy to cancel culture at a state by state level and by the way, you&rsquo;re on mute</p>
<p>So if you want to just take yourself off, yeah, thank you. We have not done anything on cancel culture</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a lot on the coronavirus. We&rsquo;ve been tracking that actually in three countries since mid-february</p>
<p>And we have a state by state look and what&rsquo;s interesting is we ask the question like this is primarily an economic issue</p>
<p>Or a primary health issue and those two have been running neck and neck</p>
<p>But the health you kind of more people on average say it&rsquo;s a health issue than an economic one</p>
<p>Trump with trump supporters overwhelmingly say the crisis is one that&rsquo;s financial not health related</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always been that but it&rsquo;s been like a 45 55 gap there</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been measuring it state by state, but there&rsquo;s a solid core of people and it gets to david&rsquo;s point about why?</p>
<p>What are they focused on? What is the what is affecting them and their you know pocketbooks?</p>
<p>It is the you know lockdowns and the kind of clamping down and what is this economic crisis?</p>
<p>Not a health care one, even though that&rsquo;s what we all say that they should follow</p>
<p>I mean there was a there was a there was a fantastic line that the democrats coined which essentially said something to the tune</p>
<p>Saksipu you&rsquo;ll tell me if I get this wrong, but it was</p>
<p>Socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the for the rest of us is essentially sort of their grab bag</p>
<p>phrase for um</p>
<p>For this election cycle and sort of to frame a lot of policies</p>
<p>But when you have in these states again, if we say this cuts along socioeconomic lines, but then maybe bleeds into</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>college and even you know</p>
<p>uh graduate level educated folks</p>
<p>Is there a vote here for um rugged individualism and just leave me the fuck alone?</p>
<p>There certainly could be I want to go back to what david said about measuring versus the why</p>
<p>Because I mentioned gender to point out a big difference that we&rsquo;re seeing across racial groups across the levels of education</p>
<p>But i&rsquo;m, you know, we&rsquo;re polling every day. So you guys have the right why question, you know, send it to me, you know</p>
<p>Send to xander. We&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll ask it, you know, we polled 9 000 people today</p>
<p>On you know kind of their willingness to accept the results and so we&rsquo;ll be putting that out</p>
<p>You know tomorrow we have a we&rsquo;ll have an exit poll running, uh every day from here on</p>
<p>To certainly until we get a result. So you have the question you want to ask send along</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll get you the data at the state level</p>
<p>All right, john. We very much appreciate you coming on the pod and we will be checking survey monkey&rsquo;s amazing data as we go</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to switch now and just john. John. John. Thank you and xander. Thanks for doing for hooking that up. Thanks, john</p>
<p>Thanks guys, and we&rsquo;ll have some more bestie guesties coming up some fan favorites from the twitter and the poker group</p>
<p>I just want to point out right now that it&rsquo;s very interesting to see that fox</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>biden at 129 electoral votes and trump at 109</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>Some of the other networks have it much lower. How do the networks make these decisions?</p>
<p>of when to call</p>
<p>A state because it&rsquo;s too early according to many to call florida, but we&rsquo;re sitting here with a pretty clear</p>
<p>Understanding of where florida&rsquo;s at does anybody have any thoughts on that of well?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re erring on the side of extreme caution because of the strange</p>
<p>Year that it is and the fact that there is all this</p>
<p>We had a hundred over a hundred million votes banked early through the mail or through early in-person voting</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Nobody sure how many more mail ballots there according to one side</p>
<p>I looked at there were still 27 million ballots outstanding now</p>
<p>Some of those are redundant ballots like david&rsquo;s father-in-law who got three ballots in the mail</p>
<p>in pennsylvania</p>
<p>And a lot of those are probably going in the trash</p>
<p>But there could be another five to ten million of those to come in</p>
<p>That are postmarked by today many states will accept them after the election as long as they&rsquo;re postmarked by election day</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re probably being very very careful</p>
<p>That they don&rsquo;t make a premature call</p>
<p>Of course, they all have ptsd about what happened in 2000 when they first prematurely called florida for al gore</p>
<p>Then prematurely called it for george w bush and we spent the next 37 days trying to figure out what the hell happened in florida</p>
<p>So, uh, I think they&rsquo;re going to err on the side of extreme caution across the board</p>
<p>Although, uh, I feel like the margin in florida at this point is</p>
<p>It feels insurmountable now, right? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Florida&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s about now. It&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about ohio, by the way, the betting markets have just moved again big time</p>
<p>So donald trump was at minus 600 now. He&rsquo;s minus 250 on bovado phil. What do you think about that?</p>
<p>Yeah snapping back. I will say let me let me address what jake jason was talking about a few seconds ago</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, you know, basically florida even the new york times had them at at 6 p.m</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>To go to trump at 95. That was a new york times site</p>
<p>My wife and I looked it up and the betting odds had him at over 10 to 1. This was at 5 30</p>
<p>This was two hours ago</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I mean, I just think there&rsquo;s a huge inefficiency with with the way that I think it was over as soon as the miami day</p>
<p>Dump showed that biden only won the early vote by nine points. I mean the hillary won it by 29</p>
<p>In 2016 and she lost the state. So</p>
<p>How much of this do we think has to do with tax policy?</p>
<p>People in florida are retiring</p>
<p>We have the aoc gang</p>
<p>We have come on jason. Elizabeth warren florida. It&rsquo;s his beloved state. He has</p>
<p>A place. Okay. So so hometown favorite mar-a-lago. I get that</p>
<p>but you have so many retirees and</p>
<p>We we have this bifurcation of how taxes should work in the united states</p>
<p>So I just want to open that up for the entire group to discuss</p>
<p>Of art are we seeing old people? Are we seeing people who are concerned about taxes?</p>
<p>Because we have had a flight</p>
<p>In the last couple of years of people from high tax states to low tax states. Is this about taxes? Do you think?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with you freedberg. No one wants to pay taxes the fuck</p>
<p>Like no one&rsquo;s gonna raise their hand</p>
<p>But I mean there&rsquo;s a moment where taxes don&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>well, but</p>
<p>Romney romney was in favor of taxes and he</p>
<p>You know, he didn&rsquo;t win</p>
<p>any any of these elections like the way that that trump looks like he&rsquo;s going to I think that</p>
<p>The the traditional republican messages message of taxes is sort of necessary but not sufficient</p>
<p>um trump obviously</p>
<p>brought a whole set of issues that previous republicans hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um hadn&rsquo;t brought and I think that</p>
<p>You I think you have to look at 2016 separately from 2020</p>
<p>And so starting with 2016, I think the big issue that trump</p>
<p>That no republican really had ever figured out except maybe pat buchanan 20 years ago was the trade issue with china</p>
<p>you know, we forget that</p>
<p>In the 1970s</p>
<p>when the great</p>
<p>Chinese economic reformer deng xiaoping decided to open up the chinese economy. The average chinese was making two dollars a day</p>
<p>And today their economy is roughly the size of the u.s. Now</p>
<p>You know, what was the reason for that?</p>
<p>Well, we had a bipartisan consensus in this country for 30 or 40 years on the part of both clinton&rsquo;s and both bushes</p>
<p>That we should you know open them. We should welcome them with open arms and we opened up our market to chinese products</p>
<p>We brought them into the world trade organization</p>
<p>But but that was the start that was the start of that was the the killer app or the killer issue</p>
<p>That trump figured out and that&rsquo;s what shattered the blue</p>
<p>Firewall in those rust belt states. I mean if you&rsquo;re going to try and figure out going back to 2016</p>
<p>Why trump won you have to explain why he won michigan?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying our jobs they took our jobs</p>
<p>But what i&rsquo;m saying is the manufacturing jobs went out and the fentanyl came in. I mean, that&rsquo;s his argument</p>
<p>And um, that was a killer argument. I mean and the proof is in the pudding</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the proof is that he won these states that hillary thought were so in the bag that she didn&rsquo;t even bother to campaign there</p>
<p>Uh, that was the big surprise</p>
<p>At 2020 and the issue of taxes. Well, no, no, no</p>
<p>No, let me let me explain what&rsquo;s going on in 2020 in my opinion</p>
<p>Okay, this is not a partisan explanation, but I think that after the loss in 2016</p>
<p>look</p>
<p>In business, we know that when you lose when you make a mistake</p>
<p>You make a bad investment or the company does something wrong you analyze what you did wrong, right?</p>
<p>And then you figure out what changes to make the democrat party did not do that. What did they do?</p>
<p>They blamed facebook. They blamed it on russian interference. They never really analyzed why they lost these rust belt states and made</p>
<p>Changes instead what they began was this hysterical?</p>
<p>denunciation of trump</p>
<p>um, you had this sort of um</p>
<p>You know, you sort of had this this sort of um</p>
<p>You know media culture</p>
<p>uh tech</p>
<p>uh industrial complex who decided that trump was a an illegitimate president and</p>
<p>You know, and so what they did is they went all in on impeachment</p>
<p>They went all in on this russia stuff and in the process they created this enormous backlash</p>
<p>And I think that 2020 if 2016 was an economic repudiation</p>
<p>Of the elites</p>
<p>2020 is a cultural repudiation of the elites. That is the big issue in 2020</p>
<p>yeah, I uh, I tend to I tend to</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sympathetic to david&rsquo;s view. I don&rsquo;t completely agree with all of it. But um</p>
<p>Just to build on something you said I don&rsquo;t think jason this has anything to do with taxes</p>
<p>um, I think that in florida</p>
<p>The if we if we end up really getting to the bottom of what happened</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Older people that probably lived through some version of mccarthyism</p>
<p>And immigrants who actually fled really shitty totalitarian countries who were like you want to do what?</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>um, and I think that there was a lot of people that basically</p>
<p>Are giving a very clear signal which is i&rsquo;m a democrat</p>
<p>But if you push me to the brink and talk about a socialized nanny state i&rsquo;m gonna vote republican</p>
<p>So to david&rsquo;s point I totally agree to david&rsquo;s point if there was an economic repudiation of sort of</p>
<p>traditional globalism</p>
<p>in 2016</p>
<p>and donald trump ends up carrying the day in today, then it&rsquo;s a repudiation of</p>
<p>sort of these cultural manifestos and norms that</p>
<p>were swinging to now</p>
<p>the the answer to that may be to say</p>
<p>Change the electoral college because it doesn&rsquo;t represent the majority or the plurality of americans</p>
<p>I hear that</p>
<p>but in the same way that you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve said for years now that the republicans will have to change to win the electoral college or to change to win</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s evolving in terms of</p>
<p>um people&rsquo;s perceptions on social policy</p>
<p>Uh, it may actually be the democrats that also have to change if this doesn&rsquo;t swing hard back in biden&rsquo;s favor</p>
<p>So and chamath when you when you make that statement</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s particularly prescient is the democrats believed that because of the demographic shift from white americans</p>
<p>To people of color latinos black americans that they were just going to win all of them. This is this is the problem</p>
<p>This is the problem with the stupidity of the establishment</p>
<p>Like if you take a thousand brown people and put us in a room</p>
<p>What I will tell you is just in case here&rsquo;s a fucking memo for all you white people out there</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not all the goddamn same</p>
<p>Okay, and if you put a thousand black people here&rsquo;s the memo</p>
<p>Now for the democrats and the republicans, they&rsquo;re not all the same</p>
<p>You can take a thousand hispanics and it turns out they&rsquo;re not all the same</p>
<p>So maybe you know, you can take a thousand straight people a thousand gay people</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re not all the fucking same</p>
<p>So maybe what this means is that we&rsquo;ve moved past color</p>
<p>and now ideology and social policy and economic and monetary and fiscal all of these things that the totality of how</p>
<p>a rational</p>
<p>well-developed person</p>
<p>Makes a decision maybe that&rsquo;s at hand and before if we historically only thought, you know</p>
<p>Older white men and white women could do it. Maybe now it actually applies independent of color and gender</p>
<p>yeah, I absolutely agree with that and I would add to that that um,</p>
<p>Uh, if trump&rsquo;s victory in 2016</p>
<p>Laid waste to the republican establishment if he wins again tonight</p>
<p>it will lay waste to the democratic establishment and the theory of the case that they&rsquo;ve had for 20 years the sort of uh,</p>
<p>share, uh emerging democratic majority</p>
<p>case that</p>
<p>They just had to sit back and let demography become destiny and they could just uh,</p>
<p>graft an identity politics onto the same</p>
<p>Neo-liberal economic agenda they&rsquo;ve been pushing since the late 1980s and it would all just somehow magically produce</p>
<p>Um majority results in the country. They are going to have to go back to the drawing board</p>
<p>And and I think get more populist themselves</p>
<p>and come up with some kind of version of politics that is</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it more in the bernie mold? It needs to be left but not woke. Isn&rsquo;t it going to be socialism?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it probably is going to be socialism, but I mean</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not like if you if you lay waste to the center</p>
<p>You know your left like I mean, that&rsquo;s basically what happened</p>
<p>Republicans and now if you&rsquo;re saying the same is going to happen with the democrats this time around you&rsquo;re going to have aoc</p>
<p>Running for president in four years</p>
<p>And she won&rsquo;t be the right brand though, because she&rsquo;s woke</p>
<p>Guys, there&rsquo;s you need a sherrod brown</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need uh aoc</p>
<p>We need a charismatic democratic candidate. Somehow. Sherrod brown keeps getting elected in in increasingly red. Ohio as a old school</p>
<p>gravelly voiced irish labor democrat</p>
<p>And somehow bernie ignited a movement as a very old school, uh, gravelly voiced, uh, jewish democrat</p>
<p>uh, neither of whom gave a damn about identity politics really they were principally concerned with inequality and</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Income redistribution. I uh, I want to I want to don&rsquo;t want to see that happen</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s the only path forward for the democrat</p>
<p>Hold on, let&rsquo;s let me go to phil because phil had something he wants to add there and then we&rsquo;ll go to you</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to say that we needed for the democrats and uh</p>
<p>They just needed to I think they needed a very they needed a charismatic powerful leader with a lot of charisma</p>
<p>I mean, I know that you know the I was hanging out with one of the trump guys</p>
<p>It was with him on the plane in the 2016 election. He said that you know, he outworked hillary</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that he outworked biden. I mean this guy&rsquo;s going to seven rallies a day</p>
<p>Um showing up with a ton of energy and he has you know, like him or not</p>
<p>He has a lot of charisma. Also. I can&rsquo;t help but think that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>repeating</p>
<p>Repudiating sorry i&rsquo;m getting that word wrong</p>
<p>Um to me this is all about I think a lot of people are really scared of socialism</p>
<p>Okay, and I think it&rsquo;s just like even the young people that you know, even the young people</p>
<p>You know who say that they love it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at their path to the future and and with and you know, they can they can still do great things</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt you can still be a 20 year old and and make a billion dollars by the time you&rsquo;re 30 or 40</p>
<p>And I think with socialism that goes away</p>
<p>I think that um</p>
<p>Look, I uh, I I think</p>
<p>if trump does win, um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think what it means is that you need a a person that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>At the extreme left to win. I actually counterintuitively would say the odd the opposite</p>
<p>Which is that you need just a more credible centered</p>
<p>person now that may only be possible if the democratic party cleaves in two</p>
<p>And the reality is the republicans may actually quasi cleave in two independent of whether trump wins or not. Anyways</p>
<p>Um, and we&rsquo;ll see as david said how some of these senate seats break because if that goes in a different direction</p>
<p>You know, for example if trump wins, but we have you know a democratic tie</p>
<p>In the senate, maybe that&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But I think that would say a lot around</p>
<p>um the need for</p>
<p>Pragmatic but more youthful leadership</p>
<p>Okay, I want to go around the horn right now. What is your gut telling me?</p>
<p>Who is going to win given what we know right now?</p>
<p>Everybody give it a thought. Uh when you&rsquo;re ready look into the camera and I will call on you michael</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking into the camera who&rsquo;s gonna win if you have to pick one right now michael. Give us your best guess</p>
<p>The winner of the recount in north carolina because that would tell me a lot but uh</p>
<p>Uh, i&rsquo;ve increasingly think trump is going to win</p>
<p>Okay, phil you&rsquo;re looking in the camera. Who do you think is going to win? We&rsquo;ve seen this movie before</p>
<p>Um, except that hillary was actually five to one favorite last time and I watched these numbers go straight up</p>
<p>And now i&rsquo;m watching the same thing. It seems like although I will say this, uh</p>
<p>You know sax has been posting some stuff within our channel about the numbers popping up and down</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting texts and they are popping up and down but still the lowest i&rsquo;ve seen is 2.5 to 1. I think trump wins</p>
<p>trump wins</p>
<p>Who do you got sax?</p>
<p>Well, i&rsquo;m gonna assume the betting markets know something. Um,</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>a little bit unclear on north carolina, um, because I saw some tweets that biden had won it by a few thousand votes, but</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>the the north carolina website is showing</p>
<p>Um that actually trumps ahead by like 70 000 votes, so i&rsquo;m not sure who to believe. Um,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna i&rsquo;m gonna go i&rsquo;m gonna i&rsquo;m gonna go with what the bad markets are saying which is trump and um,</p>
<p>you know, I thought that</p>
<p>He I thought he had a much better shot than the polls were reflecting and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s looking like</p>
<p>What do you got freeberg?</p>
<p>Donald trump took on coronavirus for us. He killed it</p>
<p>He is our true leader and he will prevail</p>
<p>Here in the united states of america tonight</p>
<p>At least the betting markets are telling me and the treasury markets and the smp futures are telling me that donald trump&rsquo;s gonna win</p>
<p>But I do think that the fact that this guy has never conceded defeat to anything in his life</p>
<p>Gives him a huge leg up and he uh, you know, he&rsquo;s he is like steve jobs</p>
<p>He warps reality and he tells everyone I am going to win. I have killed coronavirus and</p>
<p>It happens</p>
<p>Wait like a jedi knight. It&rsquo;s like a jedi. Yeah</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>404 so far picking</p>
<p>Uh exactly 7 45 pm california time chamath</p>
<p>Who do you have at this point if you had to shove your chips all in?</p>
<p>Uh, I still think the path is um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Uh, I um</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s biden and I have the advantage of some information which is that uh, they just announced</p>
<p>breaking news</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t counting mail-in votes in philadelphia tonight</p>
<p>And I uh i&rsquo;m going with so so we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>Uh</p>
<p>pennsylvania tonight</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s down to a few thousand votes philly, I think is going to break</p>
<p>I think you can count that as three or four</p>
<p>hundred thousand votes</p>
<p>Yeah, and it should be it should be five hundred thousand. It should be five hundred thousand</p>
<p>Well, then five hundred thousand would carry the state for joe biden. Yeah, they&rsquo;ve been um, so a hundred thousand</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m gonna i&rsquo;m gonna stick with biden here because I think that uh, that philadelphia vote count is uh,</p>
<p>Crucial it turns out that it may it may come down to philly</p>
<p>Which by the way, okay, what an incredibly poignant place</p>
<p>For the election to be won and lost</p>
<p>The city of underdogs the city of rocky, uh</p>
<p>I I think we can safely say that biden is going to win the popular vote and it might be by</p>
<p>four points five points, which means that there is a discrepancy</p>
<p>Uh between the popular vote and electoral college. We&rsquo;re going to hear a lot about that because uh, I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go with biden because</p>
<p>My heart is going to be so broken</p>
<p>if this country</p>
<p>Picks this sociopath to run it for another four years</p>
<p>After his absolute failure to content to do even the most modest things</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>battle coronavirus and the strife he has caused</p>
<p>Between americans and his personal style is so heartbreaking to me</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that I can</p>
<p>believe in america if they put this absolutely sociopathic person</p>
<p>Who has the least amount of character of any other human being anybody on this call has ever met in their lives</p>
<p>It would be a complete absolute utter disgrace if he makes it into office for a second term</p>
<p>What do you really exist? Are you going to respond to that?</p>
<p>Well, look, I mean the american people hold on it&rsquo;s an existential threat it&rsquo;s still going higher</p>
<p>Planet and humanity and democracy across the world</p>
<p>If this country puts that maniac into office again for four goddamn fucking more years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a prediction. That&rsquo;s my personal feeling. I can&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t care what the statistics say right now in my heart. I cannot</p>
<p>Give that man</p>
<p>Even a benefit of the doubt if he wins garbage if he wins is fauci the first guy fired</p>
<p>Oh, I think you can count on it and fauci fauci and christopher ray the fbi director and on right and increasingly maybe</p>
<p>And somehow</p>
<p>Shred of credibility or honor</p>
<p>Is gone. I wanna I want to just say to to jcow. I um, I really</p>
<p>empathize with how you&rsquo;re feeling because</p>
<p>Um, I have never as a person that has been a citizen of three countries</p>
<p>When I moved to america in 2000, I have never really I mean, you know edge cases</p>
<p>Yeah, I felt some racism here, obviously</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve but i&rsquo;ve never felt so unwanted</p>
<p>and I remember</p>
<p>2016</p>
<p>For the first time in my life feeling a level of insecurity</p>
<p>I had never felt before because I was so afraid I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant for donald trump to be elected</p>
<p>four years later</p>
<p>um, you know in in so many ways</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s like two realms of a coin, you know</p>
<p>um, I leave my house and</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>You can just see that there&rsquo;s just so much pain and divisiveness. I come back into my little world and</p>
<p>Things seem to be really great</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Really really terrible feeling to have jason. So I I know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about. I wanted to tell you guys</p>
<p>um, you know, I</p>
<p>There was like a I i&rsquo;ve always been sort of like, okay biden&rsquo;s gonna win biden&rsquo;s gonna win biden&rsquo;s gonna win</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a weird thing that I did and you guys can see it in the fec filings</p>
<p>But I gave a million bucks this year in the elections, but I gave 750 to the senate and I gave 250 to biden</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t understand why I did it</p>
<p>um, and I and I and I explained it to nat as</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, why did you do it that way?</p>
<p>And the best way that I could explain it is I I think that there are so much I don&rsquo;t know about what is driving</p>
<p>the vote for president that I wanted to make sure that</p>
<p>You know, there are checks and balances and the best check and balance was to</p>
<p>You know make sure that there was actually some senate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Check and balance on biden. I mean on uh on trump. So</p>
<p>You know, i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m gonna jason i&rsquo;m gonna accept the result. Um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try to figure out what the fuck I don&rsquo;t know because this is yet another layer of</p>
<p>I clearly don&rsquo;t know what the hell is going on. Um</p>
<p>But I I can tell you pretty assuredly guys, uh, any result that&rsquo;s called tonight I think is going to be</p>
<p>Uh incomplete because they&rsquo;re not going to call pennsylvania because they&rsquo;re not going to call philly</p>
<p>and so if there are in fact</p>
<p>Three no, I think that the exact math is about</p>
<p>350 000 votes</p>
<p>That show up in philadelphia a gap of 350 000 votes that show up in philly</p>
<p>Um biden will uh do what he needs to do, by the way, how many people live in philly?</p>
<p>Does anybody know how many registered voters?</p>
<p>Friedberg&rsquo;s is that is it is that on?</p>
<p>Philly, there&rsquo;s supposed to be it&rsquo;s supposed to be like half a million votes coming in there and I think they&rsquo;ve counted a hundred thousand</p>
<p>um, and so I think it&rsquo;d be more than half a million usually the dims, uh</p>
<p>Margin is about half a million the margin. Yeah, philly is uh, I want to say our fifth or sixth largest market</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve actually got it listed. It&rsquo;s a pretty significant population on that that link. I sent you there, right nick</p>
<p>and then if you click on uh, click to view precincts reporting</p>
<p>You can see the</p>
<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s tough to read</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean we care about allegheny</p>
<p>And then what else do we care about?</p>
<p>You care about philly and you care about those immediate suburbs outside of philly like box county and chester county and</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s four or five ringed suburbs of philly that</p>
<p>used to be</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Uh centerpiece of country club republicanism. They&rsquo;re the counties that elected arlen specter to the senate but over time as the republicans moved, right?</p>
<p>They moved more to or toward the democrats michael. Do you know why they&rsquo;re going to stop reporting? Um mail-in ballots tonight?</p>
<p>Why would they do that? They just probably just uh to go home and uh sleep for a while before they pick it up tomorrow</p>
<p>pennsylvania, unfortunately and michigan as well</p>
<p>Are states that aren&rsquo;t allowed to start tabulating until all the polls are closed?</p>
<p>Uh, that&rsquo;s why those uh states in the sun belt. We were all looking for</p>
<p>Uh to be a early bellwether because look at that guys. They can count</p>
<p>4.81 this is</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>Well, what are we seeing here? What&rsquo;s unbelievable chamath? So what that means jason is that uh in philadelphia, there are</p>
<p>1706 precincts. Okay of those only 82 have reported the their ballot tallies</p>
<p>So you have 95 percent of the precincts in philly</p>
<p>Not reporting if you take michael&rsquo;s framework and say there&rsquo;s a swing of 500 000 votes if it goes</p>
<p>Historically democrat as it has in the past you attack on 500 000 net new votes</p>
<p>to um</p>
<p>To biden and you know, and uh, he uh, he ekes out a win. Yeah, it goes blue probably in that scenario. Yeah</p>
<p>So then it becomes about but remember though</p>
<p>If trump is holding, um</p>
<p>If he if he manages to hold michigan</p>
<p>He could lose pennsylvania, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>Uh, he had a little bit of a margin. He had what he had 306 electoral votes last time</p>
<p>Uh, so if he holds everything he had minus pennsylvania</p>
<p>Actually could lose michigan too as long as he carried wisconsin. He has to have one of those two</p>
<p>But I think wisconsin&rsquo;s difficult. So by the way, uh</p>
<p>For all of our uh listeners and watchers in new jersey, they legalize recreational pots. So go out and get yourself</p>
<p>yeah, i&rsquo;m gonna i&rsquo;m I just took four gummies after my little tirade there because</p>
<p>The two xanax weren&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s gonna get really strange for me in about an hour</p>
<p>Just to go back the reason I mean are we gonna crack a bottle of wine or what somebody</p>
<p>I already got one. Yeah</p>
<p>This is mostly coffee, but trust me. There&rsquo;s some irish whiskey in here</p>
<p>I guess i&rsquo;m speaking to you, but it looks like i&rsquo;m seeing reports of the sound of arizona, pennsylvania, michigan and wisconsin</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all four of those states are going to probably take at least a day arizona</p>
<p>three days I think to count</p>
<p>maybe not this year because</p>
<p>So much of the vote was early. Maybe it&rsquo;ll move faster, but they are notoriously slow counters. So</p>
<p>Settle in it could be the weekend before we have a result</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>Okay, so let me just drop this if we don&rsquo;t know tonight</p>
<p>What</p>
<p>is going to happen over the next</p>
<p>week</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re gonna be we&rsquo;re gonna be we&rsquo;re gonna need a lot of gummies jason</p>
<p>No, I mean joking aside</p>
<p>There I think everybody&rsquo;s gonna be tense jay</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of action one way or the other I think that people</p>
<p>I think people in america are incredibly good people. I think that folks are just gonna sit tight</p>
<p>And hope that the folks whose job it is to do their job do their job</p>
<p>Um, I I but I hope you&rsquo;re right shemoff</p>
<p>But when I see a group of trucks surrounding people&rsquo;s cars when I see people bringing guns on both sides</p>
<p>Horrible people on both sides bringing guns</p>
<p>malicious style</p>
<p>To specifically taunt each other when you see people getting shot in the street chasing each other down over politics</p>
<p>This is something that has not happened in our lifetime</p>
<p>I mean phil&rsquo;s very old so he kind of remembers the 60s, but for the rest of us under</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>We have not witnessed</p>
<p>Americans shooting each other in the street over politics. We have not witnessed people taking people out of their lives</p>
<p>because of politics</p>
<p>And this is got trump&rsquo;s fingerprints on it from well, you mean since this summer?</p>
<p>I mean, what about all the looting and rioting and protests?</p>
<p>My point is when trump got in office</p>
<p>his</p>
<p>character</p>
<p>And his ability to trigger people his ability to abuse people</p>
<p>His rhetoric put everybody on tilt. I&rsquo;m not saying people looting stores are correct</p>
<p>What i&rsquo;m saying is george bush</p>
<p>And ronald reagan your heroes</p>
<p>Bill clinton obama other people&rsquo;s heroes on this call</p>
<p>There was a there was a a kindness in our differences and when people conceded they conceded with grace</p>
<p>and this individual this horrible human being bush wasn&rsquo;t a hero of mine, but um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll putting it aside. Yeah, I think reagan maybe bush senior was yeah</p>
<p>He look I respect him he&rsquo;s classiness and we had a mutual respect for each other that this deranged individual</p>
<p>has removed from america</p>
<p>And so jason i&rsquo;m not going to defend what&rsquo;s going to happen in the next week</p>
<p>Because i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not defending each other leading up to this. I think the next week</p>
<p>Could be incredibly violent</p>
<p>Thank you for that</p>
<p>Now look, uh jason i&rsquo;m not going to like disagree with you about any of that</p>
<p>Um, I the the only thing I would add though is I do think that the media has been a co-equal partner</p>
<p>in sowing this chaos and divisiveness, um</p>
<p>Because you know, we used to have a media that thought its job was objectivity and neutrality</p>
<p>Yes, and they ripped the umpire jersey off their back to go after this guy trump and um,</p>
<p>And why do you think they did?</p>
<p>money</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very profitable trump trump has made big money picking aside picking aside is is definitely more profitable to get more subscribers</p>
<p>It might also be that they were absolutely</p>
<p>Suffering from trumped arrangement syndrome from the fact that the person lies</p>
<p>And that he wants to separate children from their parents at the border</p>
<p>Listen, yes, but they&rsquo;re supposed to they have a job to do they&rsquo;re supposed to be neutral</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to be a rational opposition to trump</p>
<p>Yeah, but exactly but the but the reason why trump is doing well</p>
<p>Or better is because the opposition to him is increasingly irrational</p>
<p>And um, and people have voted for trump to to basically give the middle finger</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>You know to to the to the media who you know again who are taking sides to these big tech censors</p>
<p>You know who don&rsquo;t want us to read things that are critical of trump</p>
<p>um, you know and so on down the line, I mean</p>
<p>I I tweeted earlier. I mean rich. Lowry had a great post</p>
<p>Explaining why if trump was going to win why you know why that would happen and</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s the only middle finger available to these people and uh</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t disagree with you. He&rsquo;s not being no one&rsquo;s voting for trump because of his</p>
<p>Integrity perceived integrity. Oh, no or um integrity. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard integrity in the same sentence as trump</p>
<p>I thought you&rsquo;re i&rsquo;m agreeing with that point. Um, i&rsquo;m saying they&rsquo;re not voting for him because of that</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not voting for him because of even a second term. They&rsquo;re voting for him in order to stop</p>
<p>Cultural forces they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>Uh, I have two things to say decidedly by the way two things to say. Um,</p>
<p>according to um</p>
<p>The national political writer for the philly inquire</p>
<p>Jonathan tamari his tweet</p>
<p>Of 7 35 p.m. Said actually it was even greater than we thought there are still 2.2 million</p>
<p>Mail-in ballots to be counted in pa about 87 percent of the total</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s true, then we have that and philly number one</p>
<p>The second thing I wanted to say is that if you actually look at the sum counts right now in pennsylvania, it&rsquo;s 371</p>
<p>591 votes that separate trump and biden</p>
<p>Wow, so</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uh, you know</p>
<p>Not that much guys if 2.2 million vote votes are outstanding</p>
<p>Yeah, but if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s two if it&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see 60 percent or two-third kind of</p>
<p>To one third slash 40 percent</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not let&rsquo;s say it comes in under that right. They probably counted a couple hundred thousand already. I mean, it&rsquo;s still pretty close</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Um really close. Let me um, let me ask</p>
<p>Chamath do you think that part of the reason we&rsquo;re seeing futures markets jump?</p>
<p>and the dollar</p>
<p>jump and um</p>
<p>Uh, and all the kind of obviously correlated assets moving the way they are is not necessarily because of a trump win</p>
<p>But because the risk of a hung election seems to be coming out of the system right now</p>
<p>That it seems like we&rsquo;re gonna have a much more clear outcome here than we thought we would</p>
<p>Florida is going to be much more clear. That&rsquo;s always a worry state</p>
<p>Um, georgia is going to be clear</p>
<p>Obviously, we&rsquo;ve still got pennsylvania to kind of figure out here</p>
<p>But it seems like this is going to break one way or another whereas a lot of folks were concerned</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d end up in the court fighting over hanging chads for months and there was concern in the markets for months about that</p>
<p>um, do we think</p>
<p>No, I think that people were basically</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a reason to be long biden in the markets</p>
<p>Which is essentially that there are certain sectors of the economy that would have done very well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Those sectors of the economy were probably slightly different than trump&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Under a trump regime. The reality is that corporate taxes broadly speaking are not going to go up and so, you know</p>
<p>You can forecast higher earnings power for every stock and so everything goes up. Um</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s happening right now is more of that relief trade of maybe trump was winning so you could be kind of long everything</p>
<p>blindly</p>
<p>um, but you know the real canary in the coal mine was like if you looked at tech futures tech futures was just going</p>
<p>Bonkers when they thought he was going to win</p>
<p>Because they will probably disproportionately benefit of just having to pay no taxes because they pay no taxes today</p>
<p>um, I um</p>
<p>So so that&rsquo;s like kind of like what I what I think is happening on on that side</p>
<p>I mean trump is very pro business. That&rsquo;s why the markets are ripping, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, I feel like there was a real concern like there was a</p>
<p>a non-zero case here call it a 30 percent case that we were going to get stuck for a few months with uncertainty and</p>
<p>litigation about where this election was going to go I think I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that we we still we we could</p>
<p>still have that david because</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t if if this goes to tomorrow</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that that the game theory would tell you that tomorrow whoever loses pennsylvania</p>
<p>Should ask for an immediate recount, right? Right, and I don&rsquo;t know what the pro they have to I don&rsquo;t know what the process for that</p>
<p>Is if whoever loses, um, arizona should ask for an immediate recount, you know</p>
<p>Whatever is possible under the law. I think both biden and trump will exercise because let&rsquo;s face it</p>
<p>This is the highest stakes possible. And so you would hate to not if it&rsquo;s a margin of a few</p>
<p>Thousands of votes or tens of thousands of votes or even a hundred thousand votes and you&rsquo;re allowed to do a recount</p>
<p>so, um</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case tomorrow morning if we go to bed in another hour and a half or if we finish this thing in another</p>
<p>hour, and there is no</p>
<p>winner</p>
<p>Clear winner. I think markets will be back to sort of modestly risk off tomorrow</p>
<p>So david your thesis is that your thesis is a clear winner the markets rip either way</p>
<p>I think yeah clear winner. It&rsquo;s just like there was a lot of grinding expected here that was going to cause a lot of</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>trepidation and bouncing for a while that</p>
<p>Folks were concerned about and if you feel like you&rsquo;re going to have a clear election outcome or whether or not it gets litigated</p>
<p>If you feel clear about where it&rsquo;s going to go because it&rsquo;s 55 45, you know</p>
<p>Sure, they&rsquo;re going to ask for a recount. It&rsquo;s good news for everybody. It makes sense</p>
<p>Look, I think the market does not want those trump tax cuts repealed stocks just ripped after</p>
<p>um trump passed those corporate tax cuts, so</p>
<p>um if</p>
<p>Either trump wins or the republicans hold on to the senate</p>
<p>Then that would be a reason for the market to rip</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t mean trump has to win but but but if we have divided government gridlock</p>
<p>So between the two of you the best best possible scenario for the market is if trump clearly wins</p>
<p>Okay, I think I think we have another best online. Is it the case if we look at the senate races?</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t know if anyone I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s an easy way for us to pull this up</p>
<p>But do we have go pull that up david and and I just want to introduce our next bestie guestie brad gerstner is here</p>
<p>He oh, yeah</p>
<p>Brad runs a uh multi-billion dollar. I believe you would call it a hedge fund or a fund</p>
<p>Yeah, and he invests large swaths of money in the american economy</p>
<p>Has a very is he the best travel investor of all time jason calaganes?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s up there but um, he</p>
<p>Certainly, I would I would guess brad with covid and airlines being grounded. This has not been the easiest year for you</p>
<p>So apologies, no brad brad just made 10 billion dollars on snowflake. He&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>snowflake</p>
<p>Brad uh, what&rsquo;s going on? Tell us what&rsquo;s going on. What do you know? Well, um, hi y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a um</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating night. I mean all markets are ripping</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a massive reversal in the nasdaq a massive reversal in the bond market</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And it it appears that you know, everybody&rsquo;s now who is worried about a trump victory is now celebrating a trump victory</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>You know, one of the things people didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>About a clear biden victory is the underlying concern in the bond market</p>
<p>Right if there&rsquo;s one thing to explain the expansion and multiples in the market this year</p>
<p>Is the fact that rates have collapsed?</p>
<p>Right, so the 30 and 10 year went from</p>
<p>You know, a couple hundred basis points 20 months ago to basically 50 basis points in august of this year</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen them back up about 40 percent over the course of the last couple months</p>
<p>We see them backing up again tonight</p>
<p>The fact is the the market is seriously concerned about higher rates</p>
<p>which are the result of both a</p>
<p>turbocharged economy too much stimulus on top of</p>
<p>You know, uh vaccines and prophylactics for covid and so, you know, if you ask me</p>
<p>You know, we get all excited about the election</p>
<p>We get all excited about stimulus and tax policy, but the biggest elephant in the room is the fed and rates</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the 80 to 90 percent factor in the market this year</p>
<p>in q4 of 18 and so what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re looking at, you know, we see the the nasdaq now up 350 bips</p>
<p>The future is up 350 bips. So that says trump&rsquo;s winning. We&rsquo;re not going to break up the tech companies</p>
<p>We see the smp starting to rise again, and we see the bond market falling saying that we&rsquo;re going to have lower stimulus</p>
<p>Right in the market</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>So, you know, I I&rsquo;ve heard i&rsquo;ve heard y&rsquo;all talk about</p>
<p>You know a clear victory certainly is better than not a clear victory</p>
<p>um, but you know</p>
<p>Notwithstanding our own fucking anxiety that we have to live with for the next four years</p>
<p>In the short run the market is clearly voting on. Um,</p>
<p>You know is is voting that trump is a palatable alternative</p>
<p>Um, and I would tell you to keep your eyes on rates</p>
<p>Brad what you&rsquo;re on the market brad more more than uh, a great manager of money</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually a great human being but you&rsquo;re also very wired into</p>
<p>the dems, um, what are the dems getting wrong if they lose today?</p>
<p>Well, you know</p>
<p>First this is an upset already tonight</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it. This is a massive upset</p>
<p>relative to expectations</p>
<p>Win or lose the reversal in in the betting markets the reversal in the stock market</p>
<p>You know, I was just earlier tonight</p>
<p>You know a well-known</p>
<p>Organizers house, uh on the democratic side. I mean there is despondency. This is a massive upset</p>
<p>uh by trump</p>
<p>And once again a massive misread by the progressives and organizers in the democratic party</p>
<p>You know, I had my 84 year old mother out here from michigan over the weekend</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;ll tell you that ordinary people</p>
<p>Are made to be to feel bad about themselves</p>
<p>By people living in these parts</p>
<p>the sanctimony</p>
<p>that exists</p>
<p>in urban areas</p>
<p>you know and coastal elites is just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>You know, this is what we&rsquo;re seeing people vote against</p>
<p>Right the idea that you&rsquo;re going to close down the state of michigan not allow people to take their boats out on lakes</p>
<p>This is just you know, not something that people are willing to tolerate and I think more than anything else tonight</p>
<p>You see a protest vote</p>
<p>against sanctimony</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And this is just ordinary people saying</p>
<p>That you know, let us live our lives</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t act so much smarter than us</p>
<p>Um, you know and you know, I asked my 84 year old mother</p>
<p>You know who she voted for she goes don&rsquo;t ask me who I voted for</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s none of your business, right? Like that&rsquo;s her way of telling me right that uh,</p>
<p>You know that</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s frustrated</p>
<p>By how people in san francisco make her feel</p>
<p>Living in michigan. I I think that&rsquo;s I think that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s so smart. But david sacks before you talk. He&rsquo;s talking about you</p>
<p>Well, no look I mean i&rsquo;m on twitter and I</p>
<p>echo</p>
<p>Technology extremely. I mean, it&rsquo;s usually vcs</p>
<p>Basically, they can&rsquo;t comprehend how somebody could have a political opinion that&rsquo;s different than them without that person literally being evil</p>
<p>I mean, I see this on twitter over and over and over again. I&rsquo;m like really</p>
<p>yeah, but but but but this is like most of silicon valley and i&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>Look, I mean political opinions are like assholes</p>
<p>I mean everyone&rsquo;s got one and to think that yours is a lot prettier than everybody else&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s a bit ridiculous</p>
<p>um, welcome everybody to the</p>
<p>Podcast if you&rsquo;re just tuning in well the family hour just ended. There we go. Wait, brad brad. Can I ask a question?</p>
<p>Yeah, what um?</p>
<p>Like what what do we do?</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, you know for me listen a trump victory the reality is we&rsquo;ve learned to tolerate</p>
<p>the anxiety over the last four years and I think the market&rsquo;s fully prepared to</p>
<p>uh to manage its way through another four years of trump, so I think that&rsquo;s you know, the reason we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>The the futures react the way they are is it&rsquo;s a whole lot of nothing</p>
<p>I mean the fact that the batteries you&rsquo;re asking how do we get off of our horses if we&rsquo;re on horses the social elites?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, um</p>
<p>This is going to take a complete rewiring</p>
<p>right like an abandonment of um</p>
<p>You know the I mean listen you you and I all know the exodus of people out of the bay area right now</p>
<p>Right. The fact of the matter is like pragmatic politics in the democratic party in the state of california</p>
<p>vacated long ago</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>You know that is not a recipe for victory. It&rsquo;s not a recipe for victory at a national level</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a recipe for victory or tolerable victory at a state level. I think we&rsquo;re going to have the single largest migration</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>economic</p>
<p>Uh the single largest economic migration in the history of this country the convergence of covid which allows people to work from anywhere</p>
<p>And the risk of changing tax policies in states like california</p>
<p>Is going to cause mass economic migration and I think that people are voting with their feet and they&rsquo;re voting with their wallets</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re voting, you know tonight in in loud numbers no matter where this where this comes down</p>
<p>This is an upset and a defeat for what democrats expected to occur tonight</p>
<p>Do you do you buy the framing brad that this is about political correctness versus cancel culture?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s I think that&rsquo;s a big part of it. I mean like, you know, um</p>
<p>I think it comes out. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s amplified this year because of covid but it comes down to something very simple, which I talked about</p>
<p>Um, you know, sometimes my sister likes to call me fancy pants</p>
<p>Right. She&rsquo;s like, oh you fancy people live in san francisco. You have all the answers</p>
<p>Right. This is just the way that people in indiana and michigan and ohio</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re made to feel every day. You know, they don&rsquo;t sit around watching fox news</p>
<p>These are not people who are racist</p>
<p>Right chamath. I heard you say earlier tonight</p>
<p>The idea that trump could pull what he&rsquo;s pulling and yet if you talk to all of our friends</p>
<p>They would have you believe that it was just a small band of</p>
<p>You know racist pickup drivers carrying trump flags. I mean they are their head is in the sand</p>
<p>Their head is in the sand. Yeah, this is this is ceos. Yeah, you know, these are business owners</p>
<p>These are small business owners. These are farmers. These are old people. These are young people</p>
<p>I mean the the millennials you can&rsquo;t find a millennial in the state of indiana or michigan who supports biden, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t find them</p>
<p>and I mean just to add to that point about what they think about people in san francisco, why shouldn&rsquo;t they think that when</p>
<p>Tech giants and the people who work at these big tech companies like twitter and facebook are asserting a right</p>
<p>to censor articles that they don&rsquo;t like and trying to</p>
<p>Assert a power over what the american people get to see and read</p>
<p>I mean what a campaign issue that was for trump in the last two weeks</p>
<p>I mean whatever twitter and facebook thought they were doing to protect or help the biden campaign</p>
<p>I mean what a blunder I mean to give trump the issue of censorship in the last two weeks</p>
<p>And then the extraordinary thing, you know</p>
<p>We had that that congressional hearing in the senate commerce committee that I wrote a blog about</p>
<p>And the amazing thing is right on the heels of that after that hearing when we heard jack dorsey got that</p>
<p>You know, he just got grilled. He got ripped apart by the senators twitter doubled down on censorship after that</p>
<p>There was an article by jonathan turley talking about they censored a whole new batch of accounts</p>
<p>And so if anything, you know, it&rsquo;ll be really interesting to see I think you know</p>
<p>If you think back four years ago facebook was really for whatever reason became the scapegoat</p>
<p>For the election. I think this time around it&rsquo;s going to be twitter because they have been</p>
<p>So arrogant and their assertion of their right to censor</p>
<p>Viewpoints they don&rsquo;t like and if the republicans hold on to the senate</p>
<p>And or the presidency, I think you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>Jack dorsey become the poster child for this new censorship that they&rsquo;re going to target</p>
<p>and the paradox friedberg is that</p>
<p>Had they just let that new york post story be tweeted?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s the new york post this is I mean you may not like the new york post</p>
<p>It may have a sordid past or reputation</p>
<p>But if that had been a new york times story a washington post story or an msnbc story or a cnn story</p>
<p>It would not have been banned because it&rsquo;s a rupert murdoch new york post story</p>
<p>And because it was salacious</p>
<p>Somebody mid-level inside of twitter decided to ban it</p>
<p>How much you of that do you think?</p>
<p>Plays into what we&rsquo;re seeing here tonight friedberg, which is</p>
<p>This is not</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>a small event</p>
<p>This is a large group of people saying</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with the democratic party anymore. I just think back to 2016</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>You know everyone has their own priorities their own individual things that matter to them</p>
<p>And I remember in 2016 or leading up to it</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in what we call kind of the rust belt and the farm belt</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll remember this was around the time of kind of the transgender bathroom</p>
<p>Um, you know movement. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and this was felt very much like a coastal elite</p>
<p>um topic of interest</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the rust belt in the farm belt, you&rsquo;re like what the fuck?</p>
<p>How is this possibly something people are spending time on and arguing about and thinking about</p>
<p>And the disconnect between the priorities of the individuals that live</p>
<p>in the vast part of the united states</p>
<p>Versus what they read about and hear about others treat as their priority</p>
<p>um, I think is what partially helped support trump getting elected in the first place because the things that mattered to them that they felt</p>
<p>were highly consequential</p>
<p>Um were completely unrelated and not being paid attention to</p>
<p>While other folks, you know that had the money and the power in the big cities</p>
<p>Were focused on social matters and social issues and liberal decisions that they thought were inconsequential</p>
<p>Or shouldn&rsquo;t be a priority and I think that fast forward to 2020</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t moved in the right direction. It&rsquo;s moved in the wrong direction where the the disconnect is no longer a passive</p>
<p>Difference of priority it&rsquo;s actually become an active interest</p>
<p>Moving against you and so if you live in corn belt or the rust belt or vast parts of rural america</p>
<p>Um you to your point you&rsquo;re now not only feeling that there&rsquo;s this disconnect, but you&rsquo;re also feeling like this point of view is becoming</p>
<p>um overwhelming and stopping you from having a point of view</p>
<p>And I think whether your point of view is rooted in fact or not, you can base that however you want</p>
<p>um, it just feels like it&rsquo;s becoming a silencing effect and not just kind of a</p>
<p>You know ignoring the effect and I think let me</p>
<p>Let me just jump in here</p>
<p>I want to come back to this but I want to just jump to something that bogut just tweeted</p>
<p>Andrew bogut. Thank you for this. Um, detroit philadelphia and milwaukee all planning to post vote counts tomorrow as they work through absentee backlog</p>
<p>So if we look at the counts</p>
<p>that really could mean that phil you know, uh, pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan are</p>
<p>Either too close to call or not even yet ready to be called until tomorrow morning</p>
<p>Um, I think let&rsquo;s take a pause here and let&rsquo;s go through what the swing states are and where they stand at this very moment</p>
<p>Arizona is an important toss-up state, correct? Let&rsquo;s pull up arizona nick</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all just take a moment to look at arizona</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go through about six or seven of these states and just</p>
<p>Get our bearing right now because when we did the quick survey about 45 minutes ago four of us believed</p>
<p>Trump was going to win two of us believe one of us emotionally</p>
<p>one of us</p>
<p>Somewhat emotionally believed that&rsquo;s where we were at</p>
<p>guys</p>
<p>Guys before you start this hold on before you start this. I just want to read a tweet</p>
<p>Um two two tweets number one from nick builtin when do we get to vote on when we fire nate silver</p>
<p>and the second one</p>
<p>Wait the second one, which is even funnier. He&rsquo;s named nate silver because all his picks come in second place</p>
<p>Oh ouch</p>
<p>Wow, I mean I I was tweeting you guys for the election. I mean the nate silver thing was a joke</p>
<p>First of all, he was saying that biden was 90 percent favorite and at the same time</p>
<p>He said that if trump won pennsylvania, then he would become the favorite</p>
<p>But you knew that trump was a few points of the margin of error in pennsylvania</p>
<p>So how can you be a 90 percent favorite?</p>
<p>But some but but but pennsylvania is sort of neck and neck. I mean even his own internal projections weren&rsquo;t consistent with each other</p>
<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s nate silver one of the best sports predictors in history</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been an absolute genius he stepped into politics and now you guys are lashing</p>
<p>Yeah, but this this is the worst case of analytics since uh, tampa bay pulled their pitcher in the sixth inning of the world series</p>
<p>But I mean if we look at what&rsquo;s happening here, it&rsquo;s very clear that there are people who are either</p>
<p>Lying to the pollsters because they&rsquo;re embarrassed about their choice or they may actively be trolling the pollsters</p>
<p>So when a pollster calls them they lie to them to have this exact moment happen</p>
<p>Just like the tiktokers all registered for a trump event</p>
<p>So now we have a level of trolling going on on a national level hashtag poll</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a simpler explanation and that&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;re not all trolls</p>
<p>I think the simpler explanation is that pollsters are empiricists and they&rsquo;re experts and uh,</p>
<p>like a lot of experts</p>
<p>you you can kind of</p>
<p>You can kind of interpret the trump phenomenon of</p>
<p>Overperforming now two elections in a row is a kind of revolt against the experts</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t see their biases</p>
<p>Uh the way the way they should they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re blind to certain things</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no excuse for how bad they missed this one because michael they may have been experts yesterday, but they&rsquo;re not experts</p>
<p>Well, this is I mean</p>
<p>This is what trump does</p>
<p>This is why people support him in spite of the fact that I don&rsquo;t think anyone disagrees with jason&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Opinion of his of his character is that they love sticking it to the to the eggheads, you know, brad</p>
<p>Brad, yeah, brad. What happens to um</p>
<p>Media like what happens to how we conduct ourselves?</p>
<p>Like do you do you read the new york times tomorrow and think wow i&rsquo;m gonna trust the times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not saying you did before but i&rsquo;m just using it as a generality to sort of</p>
<p>Ask the question like what happens to media?</p>
<p>No, I think I I think our belief in</p>
<p>You know all of these polls and all of these mainstream press. I mean this validates the arguments effectively that trump has been making</p>
<p>Right that you&rsquo;ve been told lies</p>
<p>That these polls were lies</p>
<p>That everybody was trying to manipulate you. I mean, it&rsquo;s this is a</p>
<p>Validation of those who are flipping the middle finger at washington and at the coast</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;re not going to be told how to believe how to think how to vote</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>How to wear masks</p>
<p>How to wear masks and you know, it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a dangerous side to this 100</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the end of expertise. I mean who who can we ever trust?</p>
<p>I mean and this is putin ironically. It&rsquo;s the experts who got mass wrong. Remember that at the time that I was</p>
<p>Saying that we should wear masks the who was saying we shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>So they were lying they were deliberately lying to keep uh, ppe from being overrun</p>
<p>By so the experts have done a horrible job on kovat too. Jason. I mean look I think that&rsquo;s yes, I know but now</p>
<p>the cynicism of trump and his approach to absolutely undermine fauci and say</p>
<p>To and admonish people wearing masks while on stage is a level of danger</p>
<p>And is and is a dereliction of duty. That&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>So we know that mass work you actually were a proponent of it. Yes, of course mass mass should never become a political issue trump</p>
<p>Last week said don&rsquo;t wear a mask. No, he never said he was he literally made fun of a person wearing a mask</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just run through</p>
<p>Each of the states right now</p>
<p>Wait, can I just respond to that jason real quick? Yes, you may of course look look I you know</p>
<p>I wrote a blog post but going back to april 1st saying that we should that mass should be the policy</p>
<p>And it should never have become a political issue. Okay, um, it should have been a bipartisan response</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unfortunate. It became a political issue</p>
<p>um, but</p>
<p>Uh, and i&rsquo;m and i&rsquo;m not not forgiving that and it took trump way too long to get on board with mass</p>
<p>I think right around the time my blog was published a few days afterwards first</p>
<p>He said it was optional. You could do it</p>
<p>If you want it took him about another three months to actually say that mass were a good idea</p>
<p>I agree that had he just gone all in on a mass policy. I think this would not even be a close election</p>
<p>I mean that was probably the single biggest</p>
<p>Blunder that he made politically this year. Um 100 agree</p>
<p>Okay, so we agree on that but but but look but you&rsquo;re missing the other half of it</p>
<p>Which is what is our covid policy going to be today?</p>
<p>And the reality is that joe biden and all these blue state governors are still on the record</p>
<p>As being in favor of lockdowns and in fact, they are doing lockdowns</p>
<p>The only reason why michigan and wisconsin, but I say especially michigan would ever be in play tonight</p>
<p>What was because of lockdowns? Absolutely agree. Yes. This is a resounding rebuke of lockdowns</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s uh, just zip through these real quick. Arizona pull it up. Nick</p>
<p>Arizona, here. We are biden</p>
<p>54 if we round up 45 for donald trump 75</p>
<p>Looks like arizona is going to</p>
<p>Uh biden next up. Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at iowa</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Iowa 64 percent in and we&rsquo;re in a essentially a dead heat with yeah</p>
<p>Iowa&rsquo;s going to trump. Jason. I was going to trump. You can see how that numbers come down. Yeah as as the</p>
<p>Election day vote starts to trickle in that&rsquo;s going to try it. So they were one of the states that did</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>Drop-off ballots mail-in ballots first. Yes, I think I think that&rsquo;s fair to say. Yeah, okay, ohio critically important</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at ohio while we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>uh, ohio</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s really flipped hard with a commanding lead. Yeah, you can kiss that one. Goodbye. Yeah, ohio</p>
<p>North carolina we are now within one and we just all agree if we were I mean</p>
<p>All right, if we&rsquo;re momentum investors</p>
<p>I mean this thing is this is a disaster for biden right now</p>
<p>This is a disaster for biden and on top of this all our talk is about the presidency</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to get the senate either. No, uh, nor uh, tillis is running ahead of uh, trump in north carolina</p>
<p>So I think he&rsquo;s home free and uh, well the vote in maine is not fully in yet</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only about 41 percent collins has a 40 000 vote lead</p>
<p>Which is susan collins keeps her seat. That is the biggest</p>
<p>That that is like the mega upset the democrats were already counting. They were targeting her two years ago after she voted for kavanaugh</p>
<p>Yeah, okay</p>
<p>As we think through this by the way, just keep this in mind cnn right now shows</p>
<p>Um, I mean, I don&rsquo;t cnn&rsquo;s head must be up their ass or we don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing, but they show 192 to 114 biden</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>They called california when the polls closed so that&rsquo;s 55 it went. Yeah, but okay north carolina, here we go</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>We we or we did north carolina, I believe</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re at uh, 95 percent reporting and trump has a uh, a lead that looks like he&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s a lot of charlotte out. I think that north carolina is over and that by the way that uh percentage is outside</p>
<p>the recount</p>
<p>Uh window, I think you have to be within one percent</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s take a look at georgia for a quick sec and we said that was</p>
<p>Michael, you know if we&rsquo;ve counted north carolina&rsquo;s mail-in</p>
<p>I think that I think they were all dumped at the outset, right?</p>
<p>North carolina one of the reasons why we were watching them tonight is that like florida they can count in advance</p>
<p>And so they dumped they dumped a bunch right at the outset here, by the way</p>
<p>I just got it by the way</p>
<p>I just checked the betting lines trump is over a three to one favorite to win the election right now</p>
<p>Later the later it goes the more significant that is wait, why did it come down to 200 on bovado? That&rsquo;s the lowest it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. I just got three to one on one of the sides</p>
<p>Oh, this has two to one. Yeah, that&rsquo;s the lowest</p>
<p>If you assume that biden takes arizona</p>
<p>trump takes north carolina</p>
<p>south carolina georgia</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to georgia. Let&rsquo;s give him pennsylvania. Biden wins. Arizona</p>
<p>If biden wins arizona he could lose michigan</p>
<p>So georgia is currently 54 just declared that biden won. Arizona. Oh, well, okay. That&rsquo;s a quick call</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s biden has to take pennsylvania though</p>
<p>Okay. So now this is what i&rsquo;m saying. This is why this is in place</p>
<p>So if you assume biden takes arizona, so that&rsquo;s now on the table</p>
<p>Now if you say that trump takes north carolina, south carolina, georgia, pennsylvania, florida, texas, ohio, etc</p>
<p>He still needs</p>
<p>To pull out a victory in michigan</p>
<p>Wisconsin or minnesota otherwise get this or nevada. Well, actually nevada wouldn&rsquo;t be enough. Nevada wouldn&rsquo;t be enough. Yeah</p>
<p>Otherwise, let&rsquo;s go to minnesota guys. Hold on guys. Hold on. Just let me finish, please</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be if trump so if that happens trump needs to win one of michigan wisconsin or minnesota. Otherwise</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 270 268 biden</p>
<p>Wow, okay. So here&rsquo;s minnesota. Let&rsquo;s just pause for a second biden with a</p>
<p>biden&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>56 percent to 42 with 54 percent in so there&rsquo;s a lot more to come in</p>
<p>But I think michael you would agree. That&rsquo;s a bridge too far</p>
<p>I I never thought minnesota was in play. Uh, the republicans the republicans put a brave face on there</p>
<p>Uh, and they are making some gains in the rural areas, but minnesota was never in play</p>
<p>Okay time to go to wisconsin time to go to wisconsin. Let&rsquo;s take a let&rsquo;s pause here</p>
<p>We got to do this step by step everybody wisconsin 51 percent to 47 percent</p>
<p>Donald trump with 54 percent that too I think feels like a bridge too far or do we not know if they did?</p>
<p>You know, I think wisconsin is another one who&rsquo;s probably counted their election day vote first. So</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>So biden is still very much alive in wisconsin. Yeah, exactly milwaukee doesn&rsquo;t come in until tomorrow morning</p>
<p>Yeah, michigan, we need to take a quick look at michigan and then we&rsquo;re almost done</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s michigan donald trump at uh</p>
<p>Trending to 55 to 44 for biden only 44 are in</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be clear. Is this?</p>
<p>Um, detroit doesn&rsquo;t come in until tomorrow</p>
<p>Okay, is that michigan detroit doesn&rsquo;t yeah that that wayne county vote is very low. Yeah. Look at that 28</p>
<p>A lot of more a lot more votes there</p>
<p>Okay, so we don&rsquo;t know about michigan michigan is very much up in the air</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a pretty good margin for trump there</p>
<p>But I would say it&rsquo;s very much up in the air</p>
<p>But by the way, if you put arizona in biden&rsquo;s column, he can lose michigan</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at pennsylvania one more time actually and trumath is right</p>
<p>He could lose he could lose either michigan or pennsylvania and still</p>
<p>He could have trump needs to win michigan wisconsin one of michigan wisconsin or minnesota. So basically forget minnesota</p>
<p>If destroyed so so then if detroit doesn&rsquo;t show up and milwaukee and green bay don&rsquo;t show up trump wins</p>
<p>pennsylvania</p>
<p>Chamath does that assume that he wins pennsylvania?</p>
<p>Yes, if I give you if we give him pennsylvania. So again, this is why I think guys</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>It feels like biden</p>
<p>as I said</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little shaky on my prediction right now</p>
<p>Actually, I think the the the betting markets are showing, uh, it&rsquo;s tightened almost to even</p>
<p>And let me ask brad a question brad if the betting markets are saying it&rsquo;s almost even in the analysis</p>
<p>We just did isn&rsquo;t missing any information</p>
<p>Yeah, why are the um futures markets still trading up one and a half points and and why are things still you know?</p>
<p>I I think that listen</p>
<p>the the the stock markets ripped the last two days</p>
<p>Assuming that biden&rsquo;s going to win</p>
<p>And I think what the markets are starting to</p>
<p>uh price in</p>
<p>Is that this is not going to be a blue wave?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no mandate here for massive tax reform. There&rsquo;s going to be a divided senate. It&rsquo;s going to be hard to pass</p>
<p>Legislation that&rsquo;s going to be overly onerous</p>
<p>That the stimulus package is going to be smaller not larger, which is why the the rates are backing up</p>
<p>So I think from a I think from a public markets perspective</p>
<p>The idea that we&rsquo;re going to have some checks and balances in place. It can live with either</p>
<p>the the devil we know</p>
<p>Uh, or it can live with biden, but it doesn&rsquo;t want biden with elizabeth warren as treasury secretary. So democracy survives</p>
<p>I I think scenario three is starting to look very possible a biden and a republican senate and uh,</p>
<p>I could sleep soundly with that</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have I mean you guys I don&rsquo;t know what odds you&rsquo;re looking at but uh, but I mean 1.9 is I mean</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s a huge significant right there</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still good. I give you that but uh</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know those those numbers. It&rsquo;s moving phil. It&rsquo;s moving fast. Yeah. I um, I want to I want to take it&rsquo;s down to 180</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to go back to this topic. Um that that free work brought up. Um, okay guys</p>
<p>Look, we&rsquo;ll have a winner and it&rsquo;s going to be close-ish</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but think of how many people</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Like isn&rsquo;t there any empathy for all these people that are that just feel so completely shut out of the system?</p>
<p>Like what do we do tomorrow?</p>
<p>Like irrespective actually of whether trump wins or biden wins. I think brad&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;re going to basically get</p>
<p>You know, nothing much is going to happen at that level</p>
<p>but what do we do at the like on main street, like what are we doing to close the gap between folks so that</p>
<p>You know this entire cohort like literally I don&rsquo;t care whether biden wins by the popular vote by 5 million or 7 million</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about tens of millions of people</p>
<p>Bill gurley is now on the line</p>
<p>Another one of our bestie guesties bill. Thanks for joining us. You heard the question being teed up here. This is neck and neck</p>
<p>This is not something anybody at least pollsters came anywhere close to predicting</p>
<p>And chamat&rsquo;s question I think is a really valid one who has got a greater chance of bringing the country back together</p>
<p>And maybe leading from the middle and maybe healing this wound because this has been the worst four years</p>
<p>I believe in any of our lifetimes</p>
<p>In terms of the anxiety and the anger between people who used to be able to get a loaded question</p>
<p>Well, I want to know bill&rsquo;s opinion because</p>
<p>By the way bill gurley</p>
<p>Jason bill is the best venture capitalist in the world phil</p>
<p>Phil stop hijacking our fucking broadcast. Go ahead girly</p>
<p>So thanks for having me on. I you know, I think you guys have done a really good job of breaking down why?</p>
<p>People have misestimated this thing. There was a you know, there&rsquo;s such a rural urban split</p>
<p>There was a there was a really good new york times daily podcast about two weeks ago where they interviewed</p>
<p>Rural democrats in in pennsylvania that had switched to trump</p>
<p>and and all the voices they echoed were very similar to what brad</p>
<p>walked through with his mother and so I do think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>A true lack of empathy for the the center states and the rural areas from the coastal elites</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;d say part of breaking any of it down would be somehow</p>
<p>Trying to separate that I think a bigger issue</p>
<p>that has really been on my mind lately is just how tribal everyone&rsquo;s gotten and I i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve come to believe that the</p>
<p>the way you can</p>
<p>Probably just ruin your mind the most is to just join a tribe and quit thinking about things</p>
<p>And the number of people I know on both sides that have run off to their tribe</p>
<p>Um is shocking to me and and it&rsquo;s just not a way to go about being smart</p>
<p>because you know, and and if you anyone that makes fun of a you know,</p>
<p>A religion that&rsquo;s extreme or something. It&rsquo;s all the same shit. Like you&rsquo;re just believing dogma for the sake of it. So I</p>
<p>One of the things that I worry about about a trump victory is is just very tactically in my life</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s part of living in california</p>
<p>But a whole bunch of people and things that I want to get solved</p>
<p>Become more manic if he wins like my kid&rsquo;s school and the companies that I work with</p>
<p>And and kovid quite frankly</p>
<p>I I think that we can&rsquo;t get past kovid with trump because the tdsers are so convinced that it has to be</p>
<p>Problematic and it&rsquo;s just you know, so I don&rsquo;t I actually I don&rsquo;t know the exact path to solve it</p>
<p>But I I do worry about just being in a world where everyone hates each other and it just doesn&rsquo;t seem solvable that way</p>
<p>well, this is why I think you know, uh this this scenario, which uh,</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve called the soft landing where let&rsquo;s say you had a biden victory by two electoral votes. The republicans hold on to the senate</p>
<p>Um, I think the radical left gets a big. Um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say rebuke, um or a shock</p>
<p>And we have basically divided government in washington, but it takes the whole temperature down because</p>
<p>you know trump gets replaced by biden, but</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve kind of got you know, basically joe and his old pal mitch are in a power sharing arrangement in washington</p>
<p>It could be a really good situation for the country for the next four years</p>
<p>You know temperature would go down. There&rsquo;d be kind of this</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>Healing process if you will, um, but you know</p>
<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be a whole lot of new sort of legislation that we have to worry about</p>
<p>I think we would get what we want which is the ability to ignore washington for four years</p>
<p>Yeah, but we wouldn&rsquo;t get a solution to really what ails us</p>
<p>Which is the fact that there&rsquo;s all these people that just feel completely</p>
<p>shut out and I that really bothers me at some very basic level, which is like</p>
<p>I just think like, you know, I I fought my family my parents</p>
<p>Just escaped some third world fucking shithole to go to canada</p>
<p>And you know canada gave us a lot but it still wasn&rsquo;t enough for me</p>
<p>I crawled and scratched to get into the united states</p>
<p>Things work out, but I don&rsquo;t feel like I have a right to all of a sudden. Um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know just like</p>
<p>Look down on other people or make people feel like shit or not allow people</p>
<p>Do you actually think shamoff that biden is going to do that or do you think biden&rsquo;s going to know but jason?</p>
<p>I think middle ground. No who who?</p>
<p>Collaborates with the republicans in the senate in the congress</p>
<p>What i&rsquo;m saying is independent of what happens. We&rsquo;re going to have basically we&rsquo;re going to have a photo finish</p>
<p>And what I think what brad said is right</p>
<p>The the fact that we&rsquo;re in a photo finish</p>
<p>Means that there are a lot of people in pain</p>
<p>And I think we have a responsibility to get our heads out of our asses</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>Stop this sanctimonious holier-than-thou bullshit. I agree with brad when he says that it really hits a nerve with me</p>
<p>Because I feel like there are a lot of people we work with them all it&rsquo;s rife within the tech culture</p>
<p>And all these fuck bags think they know what they&rsquo;re talking about all the time and we&rsquo;re doing a disservice to so many americans</p>
<p>And we need to wake up and that&rsquo;s what bothers me the idea that there are so many people</p>
<p>Who feel like they&rsquo;re just getting so fucked?</p>
<p>Really bothers me that bothers me</p>
<p>So I I I can ignore trump i&rsquo;ll ignore his bullshit because honestly</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done nothing. He will do nothing. He is a complete fucking void</p>
<p>um, but whether it&rsquo;s trump or biden in a 270 268 election</p>
<p>The fact that so many people still use this guy as a vessel</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t know that makes that makes me more upset. I think some people I think a lot everyone thinks</p>
<p>everyone thinks</p>
<p>Has some degree of empathy to the problem</p>
<p>I think there are different points of view on the solution, which is where this stuff gets realized</p>
<p>The one point of view is we should have less government involved in our lives in our businesses</p>
<p>And the other point of view is we should have more support and help from the government</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where things diverge very quickly</p>
<p>Um, it doesn&rsquo;t feel to me like anyone</p>
<p>uh in politics is necessarily ignoring what you&rsquo;re highlighting and I don&rsquo;t think anyone in america does from the rich to the poor to the</p>
<p>Left to the right. I think the solutions are miscast because for example, like what are we supposed to do?</p>
<p>Like with our higher educational institutions the people that are churning out all these folks that are meant to go and collaborate and find middle ground</p>
<p>I mean, I clearly like all of this says our educational facilities are completely failing from grade school all the way through to</p>
<p>high school</p>
<p>Um community college college grad school. It&rsquo;s all just a contrived piece of shit</p>
<p>Right, we are completely putting out one in two people for failure</p>
<p>Okay, so that much is clear</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see politicians fixing that</p>
<p>On either side of the aisle what I mean, honestly, what are we supposed to do? Well, I mean, I just might I just suggest that</p>
<p>um two things</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>number one, I think in these results that you see there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>You know, there is extraordinary frustration</p>
<p>Right with this with the state of affairs the fact that trump in the middle of covet</p>
<p>After four years of torturous anxiety inducing tweets</p>
<p>Could even be in a</p>
<p>neck-to-neck race to win this election tells you</p>
<p>right how</p>
<p>Devastatingly bad people feel about how they&rsquo;re how they&rsquo;re being treated. I think that you know</p>
<p>I said recently I mean we have to redraft the social contract this idea</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been living under a social contract drafted post-world war ii</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>That you know, it&rsquo;s pre-technology revolution. We have a concentration of wealth today in the world and in this country like we&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>and we have</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Republicans that are setting their ways who say, you know, no, no universal</p>
<p>healthcare</p>
<p>You know no reform of the education system. You have democrats who are demanding that you have universal basic income</p>
<p>I think you have to have um pragmatic</p>
<p>smart</p>
<p>Younger politics. I mean the fact that we have two old white men</p>
<p>I mean neither of these folks</p>
<p>Is on top of their game</p>
<p>I mean neither of these and they like this is I mean you can you compare biden to pete budigig</p>
<p>I mean budigig is budigig walks into the lion&rsquo;s den of fox tv</p>
<p>And tames the lion every night</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>Right, let&rsquo;s get pete budigig solving some of these problems</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get some younger ideas on the republican side solving these problems, but we&rsquo;re going to have to re-architect</p>
<p>Architect that social contract no doubt about it. Um</p>
<p>You know, and I I think the second thing is that you know to me this is</p>
<p>going to be a wake-up call</p>
<p>To the nominating processes in both parties, but but let&rsquo;s be clear mike pence right has his road map</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>You know for you know how to win the election</p>
<p>indiana governor</p>
<p>Right. He&rsquo;s going to tap into the same fears that trump tapped into. I mean these fears aren&rsquo;t going away</p>
<p>Right the exact the exacerbation of the wealth disparity is going to increase not decrease. We see it every day out here</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to have to have you know, the democratic party who nominates people puts people</p>
<p>You know forward who can you know who can tap into this brad? Who do you like if it wasn&rsquo;t biden?</p>
<p>Who would you like?</p>
<p>budigig</p>
<p>budigig he&rsquo;s a south</p>
<p>This was the you know an openly gay</p>
<p>mayor</p>
<p>Of my hometown in indiana</p>
<p>You think he can sell right who fought who fought in afghanistan</p>
<p>And who goes on fox news every damn night?</p>
<p>Right and has a conversation that leaves</p>
<p>Republicans saying oh that guy&rsquo;s pretty smart</p>
<p>Right. Yeah, I I agree that he&rsquo;s a tremendous political talent</p>
<p>Do you think that he&rsquo;s pragmatic enough brad or he&rsquo;s he would he would end up veering?</p>
<p>more towards uh, you know sort of like</p>
<p>Politically correct leftist socialist agenda and then have the same result</p>
<p>I think that there is a</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a doctrine in the in the democratic party that to win the primary you got to veer to the left</p>
<p>Right, you got to contend</p>
<p>With bernie, you got to contend with elizabeth warren, but ultimately that&rsquo;s a losing strategy in in the election</p>
<p>and so I think you&rsquo;re going to have the emergence of a</p>
<p>Middle of the country governor middle of the country mayor somebody like pete</p>
<p>Um who&rsquo;s going to run, you know on a smart younger pragmatic</p>
<p>democratic ticket</p>
<p>Um, I think that&rsquo;s a winning formula. I mean, I think that&rsquo;s the clinton formula</p>
<p>um, you know obama was a bit of an anomaly, but the clinton formula was a</p>
<p>conservative pragmatic form of of</p>
<p>Democratic party leadership. I mean I suspect that in the next three or four days</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to get a call from the democratic leadership figuring out how much they can count on me and my message to them is</p>
<p>you guys can go fuck yourselves until you figure this out because to your point brad it is</p>
<p>absolutely shameful that</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in no, no, i&rsquo;m serious that we are in I know you are. That&rsquo;s what I love</p>
<p>Well, but chamath. I mean what you should tell them to do is go form a dlc</p>
<p>Remember the democrat democrat leadership committee that bill clinton formed. So remember what what bill clinton did?</p>
<p>You know when he won in 92 we had three straight republican presidential terms ronald reagan incredibly successful president then</p>
<p>His successor basically reagan won a bush won a third term for reagan, but he was a weak</p>
<p>Candidate and clinton came in there. What did he do? He triangulated he tacked toward the center. Um,</p>
<p>And you know, he he actually passed a lot of bipartisan legislation david david david. Let me make this even more blunt. Okay</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>My million bucks will grow to 10 million dollars per election to 50 million dollars per election as I get older</p>
<p>Okay, so if these motherfuckers want a single goddamn dollar from me</p>
<p>What I want first is a root cause analysis to understand what is actually going on</p>
<p>So to your point before you fix it, you need to be honest and identify the problem</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I I think that I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s because the the issue that trump ran against</p>
<p>Was that joe biden was a trojan horse for radical for a radical left that really?</p>
<p>Owns the democratic party right now. That&rsquo;s what he ran against bill gurley</p>
<p>What do you think the issues are that if we were going to try to have a great reconciliation between these two parties?</p>
<p>between middle america and the coastal elites where you have spent</p>
<p>You know large swaths of your life. I think perhaps you&rsquo;re the only person here who has lived in both places</p>
<p>Middle of america from indiana</p>
<p>Okay, but you don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>I trust your judgment on these issues</p>
<p>but what does the what does the</p>
<p>What are the coasts need to understand about the people who believe who win who live between the coasts?</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re trying to express to us and how can we as coastal?</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>occupants and citizens do</p>
<p>To kind of bridge this gap other than just moving to austin and getting the hell out of california, which is devolving</p>
<p>Which is what I feel like doing at this point</p>
<p>Well, two i&rsquo;d have two comments on this one, you know having having listened to</p>
<p>You know as much as I can on on all the of the the voter conversations including this call</p>
<p>Um, i&rsquo;m not 100 sure that that these people feel</p>
<p>Unrepresented. I think a lot of them want to be left alone. And so part part of what&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>Engineered or what they fear is being engineered is someone sitting in a city with views that are very different than them</p>
<p>Telling them that this is the world they have to live by and I think the lockdown fit in with that</p>
<p>But a lot of other things too that the the daily podcast I mentioned, you know, there was this guy just saying</p>
<p>What is what does nancy pelosi know about what I want in my day-to-day life?</p>
<p>You know and so there is a notion of being left alone brad&rsquo;s story about his mom was like hey</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fine here. Like don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t bother me</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a difference between trying to solve a problem for him and being empathetic to their point of view</p>
<p>and and I would say</p>
<p>um having spent a lot of time in these areas and being a slow talker and sometimes, uh made fun of for that there is a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s unquestionably a uh, a a type of</p>
<p>Social bias against rural americans in in urban cities. There&rsquo;s just no doubt</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the only joke you&rsquo;re allowed to tell without getting</p>
<p>rebuked</p>
<p>In other words, we can make fun of the rednecks and we can oh, absolutely all day long all day long</p>
<p>We can we can do a bill gurley impersonation</p>
<p>I mean if we and this is the thing that I don&rsquo;t understand when I grew up and I&rsquo;m curious other people&rsquo;s opinions here</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;ll let anybody who wants to jump in on this</p>
<p>It feels like the lessons I was taught in the 70s and 80s which were</p>
<p>America is strong because we&rsquo;re a melting pot</p>
<p>We take the best of all the cultures and we try to make our own out of it</p>
<p>And that you get to make choices for your life</p>
<p>And in your city town and state that don&rsquo;t have to be the same as the ones we make in new york</p>
<p>So if you want to have a handgun and you want to put it on your waistband</p>
<p>In texas or wherever and in new york city</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to have handguns in the city because it&rsquo;s a little bit more crowded</p>
<p>We can we can have that difference</p>
<p>And we can coexist</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know when we lost this script</p>
<p>That what makes america great is the differences and that people living in different parts of a very large</p>
<p>diverse country can have different opinions about</p>
<p>You know abortion and and what month abortion is allowed to occur at or the owning of a gun</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>How tall a building can be built?</p>
<p>When did that get taken off the table and who took it off the table?</p>
<p>You know who took it off the table was these hysterical libs</p>
<p>And I think the hysterical as much as this far right trump, you know</p>
<p>Uh, you know flags on pickup trucks surrounding other cars is absolutely horrible to watch</p>
<p>I I have equal disdain for hysterical libs trying to tell somebody who lives on a ranch</p>
<p>That they can&rsquo;t have a gun when they&rsquo;ve never even been to a goddamn ranch</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve never had to use a gun to protect their family because then a cop coming to your ranch</p>
<p>Is going to take 45 minutes</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what america needs to get back to is respecting each other&rsquo;s different lifestyles whether you&rsquo;re an atheist or you&rsquo;re devoutly</p>
<p>catholic</p>
<p>Viva la difference let people live their goddamn lives. I think it&rsquo;s an astute point bill</p>
<p>J cal can we run down california next? Yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, very curious how prop 22 is doing and</p>
<p>Is ahead bill gurley</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Jesus the goddamn people are allowed bill. Can you tell everyone what prop 22 is and why yeah, please?</p>
<p>Why why it got?</p>
<p>Yeah, but and and and and it would transition to a whole bunch of conversations about politics that I I feel more passionate about</p>
<p>than who gets elected, which is</p>
<p>if you know</p>
<p>In order to solve the problems that everyone&rsquo;s upset about with inequality and whatnot</p>
<p>I think you have to have massive innovation and you have to have job growth and I don&rsquo;t know of any</p>
<p>waves in history where you get a whole bunch of improvement in in</p>
<p>standard of living for broad swaths of a population</p>
<p>without being positively aligned with job growth and</p>
<p>What the where i&rsquo;m going with this is my my biggest concern about washington</p>
<p>I used to say the main reasons silicon valley works is because it&rsquo;s so fucking far away from dc</p>
<p>um, and it&rsquo;s because regulation</p>
<p>Is the friend of the incumbent and it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the opposite of innovation. It locks in things and it&rsquo;s very resistant to change and</p>
<p>Matt ridley&rsquo;s new book how innovation works goes through this over a very very long period of time. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Fantastic, and he talks about why europe&rsquo;s gotten stuck and like the top 50 market cap companies in europe</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no new entrant in 30 years or something like that</p>
<p>um because of this anyway prop</p>
<p>22 is a california proposition reaction to a law that was put on the california books called ab5</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge and this is consistent with the editorial groups at the la times the san francisco chronicle and the san diego</p>
<p>Tribune is that it was written entirely by a union the seiu who has no</p>
<p>representation over</p>
<p>Over drivers or gig workers whatsoever. They represent service industry workers</p>
<p>Um, and they would like to represent uber drivers, but they don&rsquo;t today</p>
<p>And I I think I think about this like a bunch of people living in nevada trying to pass a law</p>
<p>for the citizens of california</p>
<p>Unfortunately because the regulatory capture which which I think is unfortunate on both sides of the aisle</p>
<p>Um, the union&rsquo;s able through a woman named lorraine</p>
<p>And gonzalez is able to get the state to pass a law</p>
<p>that that</p>
<p>Basically targeted gig workers, which was this new job type that has all these fantastic benefits. Anyway, um,</p>
<p>Immediately thereafter there were several industries who were like, oh we don&rsquo;t want this for us</p>
<p>So them and their unions and constituents started calling on</p>
<p>sacramento with lorraine and gonzalez and and and carving them out one by one so</p>
<p>By the by the time ab5 was set to be put in action</p>
<p>There were over 100 industries that have been carved out</p>
<p>Because it was a stupid law written just to target and a single industry and it was written with political donor dollars</p>
<p>now in a moment that I would say is</p>
<p>Completely outside of my realm of what I expected</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all of the newspaper all the editorial boards for all of the major newspapers in</p>
<p>California came to the conclusion that this was a bad law that this was crony capitalism</p>
<p>Written with donor dollars and they all got behind prop 22, which is because we have this ballot initiative</p>
<p>in california as a way for the voters to tell sacramento that they&rsquo;re full of shit and</p>
<p>That looks like what&rsquo;s happening right now</p>
<p>Sorry for the long answer. No. No, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a great answer. And what what&rsquo;s particularly</p>
<p>infuriating about this</p>
<p>Um, and listen you and I are both, um, you know, um investors in companies impacted by this</p>
<p>um is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a group of people who&rsquo;ve been exempted from this and the list of people exempted</p>
<p>All seem to be just slightly more powerful and slightly</p>
<p>better paid</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>salespeople</p>
<p>uh fishermen</p>
<p>psychologists</p>
<p>Surgeons dentists engineers architects lawyers, etc</p>
<p>And if this had passed or if it still does pass because we&rsquo;re only at 15 or 20 percent of people</p>
<p>Have been counted so far, but it&rsquo;s looking like prop 22 will pass</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>in one of the businesses I run inside.com we had to</p>
<p>Uh tell all of the freelancers we were hiring who are writers that they would lose their gig work with us</p>
<p>Because they could only write five stories a year or ten stories a year and vox</p>
<p>One of the big publishing companies, which is incredibly left-leaning as left as it gets</p>
<p>They</p>
<p>Stopped hiring people in california and they fired and laid off all their california freelance writers nick and what this does to</p>
<p>People who are doing gig economy 70 of them are working part-time nick</p>
<p>Can you go back to uh, can you I I need to switch topics nick</p>
<p>Can you go to georgia, please for a second? Uh little little late breaking data</p>
<p>Uh over 400 000 votes outstanding in atlanta and the suburbs. Um, how close is georgia?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how oh my god</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a statistical dead heat if you add back in 400 000 for all biden</p>
<p>Now i&rsquo;m just saying that&rsquo;s not where it&rsquo;s going to be but uh, they won&rsquo;t all be provided. Yeah</p>
<p>I mean atlanta atlanta should go 70 percent by oh sure it will yeah, maybe 75 80, but</p>
<p>I guess he&rsquo;d have to be 100 to 0</p>
<p>to catch up</p>
<p>If i&rsquo;m reading that right anyone cynic anyone here cynical enough to think that there&rsquo;s some operative in these states</p>
<p>Holding these on purpose so that they can be the center of importance tomorrow</p>
<p>No, I just think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost midnight on the east coast and people are tired and they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>Go home and uh, have a shit shower and a shave and uh start again tomorrow. That&rsquo;s the reason girly is so successful</p>
<p>He always girly always knows how to diagnose the individual motivation</p>
<p>And he can diagnose the shit out of it by just thinking about what one guy&rsquo;s motive is and then he&rsquo;s figured the whole</p>
<p>Thing out he makes a billion dollars over master of self-interest bill girly</p>
<p>True</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it comes down to so trump needs to win two out of four of these states nevada</p>
<p>pennsylvania wisconsin or michigan</p>
<p>and um, he&rsquo;s got to win two of those four so it&rsquo;s got to be probably pennsylvania</p>
<p>and michigan or</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and wisconsin, but he&rsquo;s got to win if he loses nevada. He needs to win two out of those three rust belt states</p>
<p>Or he wins nevada plus like a pennsylvania</p>
<p>Yeah, this is gonna be this is gonna be really michigan&rsquo;s gonna go to trump this is gonna come down to pennsylvania</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And really to the to to the philly suburbs. I was reading on twitter. Uh,</p>
<p>Election official in michigan says don&rsquo;t expect results before friday</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy well and by the way, I mean so so so</p>
<p>I mean, but let&rsquo;s just think for a second how extraordinary it is that trump looks like he might win michigan</p>
<p>I mean just to go back to the you know, the the theory of the of the case that we were laying out earlier</p>
<p>Um about how china about how trump picked up this this china trade issue</p>
<p>Four years ago and and and this this time he combined it with the lockdown issue</p>
<p>um, I mean</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really amazing that that state</p>
<p>Is leaning trump right now, michigan michigan was two issues</p>
<p>it was</p>
<p>Uh, you know working class democrats</p>
<p>Feeling like trump&rsquo;s standing up for them with respect to china and it was lockdown</p>
<p>And lockdown wasn&rsquo;t it was an overwhelming issue</p>
<p>Uh, you know for my for my friends and my folks in michigan for sure</p>
<p>can we go back to prop 22 for a second jason because I think that this is um,</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>This is a uh, an issue of extreme</p>
<p>importance</p>
<p>you know, one of the things that bill didn&rsquo;t say is</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re talking earlier chamath brought up, you know, what&rsquo;s the third way?</p>
<p>you know, we we</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve built a social contract on the back of</p>
<p>Kind of w2 tied employment for the better part of the last 70 years</p>
<p>We now have a massive part of the economy. That&rsquo;s gig and it&rsquo;s not just this is all freelancers</p>
<p>This is all part-time workers and post covet</p>
<p>This is just a massive portion of the economy and the idea</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re going to tie all benefits to w2 is just totally asinine. It&rsquo;s got to be re-architected</p>
<p>And what prop 22 does?</p>
<p>Is say it&rsquo;s ic plus</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s independent contractor plus benefits</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s this idea that we don&rsquo;t have to tie benefits to w2 employment</p>
<p>Right, so the nonsensical no argument against prop 22</p>
<p>That this was an abandonment of the employee is just that</p>
<p>It combines flexibility</p>
<p>with benefits</p>
<p>And you know from my perspective you&rsquo;re going to see if prop 22 passes, which I think it will tonight</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be the architecture that new york and many other states follow</p>
<p>Um, they&rsquo;re certainly not going to follow the disastrous ab5</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>um, but we also know that it&rsquo;s not sufficient just to have</p>
<p>uh a bunch of workers with with zero health care and you know, and so I think that this is a</p>
<p>Uh, you know hats off to doordash instacart, you know uber and lyft trying to trying to design something that is a middle way</p>
<p>And you know chamath if we don&rsquo;t have politicians designing a middle way</p>
<p>Right, then we need leadership out of the business community design in a middle way</p>
<p>well that so you just said something so so profound and I was gonna</p>
<p>I would like to build on that. I think what california shows is that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>If you have a completely democratic up and down ticket and it veers too far to this</p>
<p>coastal naval gazing socialist nanny state</p>
<p>Then it requires money</p>
<p>and companies</p>
<p>To basically level the playing field because the republicans can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to</p>
<p>fight back</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting to me is nobody ever talks about</p>
<p>Or or maybe they do and I just don&rsquo;t hear it about how the equivalent happens on the right</p>
<p>um, it&rsquo;d be interesting to know if you guys know of any states where there&rsquo;s just republican up and down the ticket and they</p>
<p>just veer into such a</p>
<p>Detached laissez-faire where the whole state needs to get corrected by for-profit organizations, but it&rsquo;s it seems like we&rsquo;re setting up for</p>
<p>democrats versus companies</p>
<p>And people moving to republican states to have low taxes and to be left alone</p>
<p>Well, you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sensible set of outcomes in california, right? I mean, do you guys not agree that the uh, the yes on prop 22?</p>
<p>And sax it looks like your commercial property tax</p>
<p>Proposition that zuck helped fund</p>
<p>May not pass. It&rsquo;s a oh, thank god. It&rsquo;s a yes. We don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a point one percent differential. Yes</p>
<p>Which I know I agree. It&rsquo;s look the california ballot initiatives are looking really good right now</p>
<p>it gives me a lot of hope it gives me a lot of hope about the state because</p>
<p>The most anti-economic the most let&rsquo;s put a business unfriendly ballot initiatives looks like they&rsquo;re going down</p>
<p>Starting, you know with the win on prop 22, that&rsquo;s huge. But then prop 15</p>
<p>You know, we talked about that on a former</p>
<p>Episode of the all-in pod. This was chipping away at prop 13, which is the great</p>
<p>Shield of the middle class in terms of property taxes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not saying you couldn&rsquo;t get a better tax regime that would</p>
<p>tax commercial property of fair market value, but you sure wouldn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>Give that card away without demanding some structural reform in exchange for it</p>
<p>Which is why I thought it was just so stupid for</p>
<p>You know tech billionaires to be funding, you know, these these ballot initiatives for higher taxes, you know</p>
<p>This is definitely looking like a like a sensible kind of middle ground outcome where a lot of folks who were concerned about california</p>
<p>Swinging all the way left and chasing</p>
<p>Uh business and enterprise out of the state</p>
<p>Um, you know, maybe kind of getting reeled in and I think it gives some hope and gives some pause</p>
<p>Uh to a lot of folks who are trying to build businesses in california to recognize that you know</p>
<p>Hey, there there is a thoughtful populace here. Um, totally agree</p>
<p>And this is this is a great outcome tonight. I feel I I personally feel really good about</p>
<p>I I agree. I mean if this sticks it it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>It it is because the the big the big issue with california right now is that we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>You know people we&rsquo;ve got net migration out of the state because it&rsquo;s just so hard</p>
<p>Uh for for the middle class to live here and to build businesses here</p>
<p>I hope what we hear, you know, if if we&rsquo;re fortunate enough for prop 22 to pass</p>
<p>I hear we I hope we see a coalition</p>
<p>Among these companies come together</p>
<p>and really</p>
<p>Promote this as a national architecture</p>
<p>for a</p>
<p>Third way for independent contractors free agents across the country</p>
<p>Uh to have a living wage and benefits</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally detached from w-2 employment. I really do believe</p>
<p>um a bunch of people on this call will were helpful to</p>
<p>an</p>
<p>An effort I launched around the board challenge, you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time for the social consciousness of corporate america to take the leadership position</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s not coming out of washington</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many issues that the solution lies</p>
<p>Among us and we got to stop spending our election nights wondering when somebody&rsquo;s going to deliver us from ourselves</p>
<p>We got to start delivering ourselves</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a girl. How do you think you resolve bad unions?</p>
<p>I mean like, you know girlies</p>
<p>Girl, are you still with us? Yes</p>
<p>How do you resolve things with the unions after this? I mean if prop 22 passes</p>
<p>is there a uh a coming to the middle ground with unions and</p>
<p>Or unions always just a kind of directional vector, you know, they&rsquo;re always like a force on the system</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not an absolute or objective, right? They&rsquo;re uh, they&rsquo;re just always pushing in one direction</p>
<p>I mean what ends up happening with the resolution with unions or is it just a constant back and forth to try and manage?</p>
<p>The impact they&rsquo;ll have on policy politics tax</p>
<p>um free market, etc</p>
<p>so from from my point of view the</p>
<p>If you if you think about citizens united which a lot of people were upset about I think rightfully so</p>
<p>uh, because dc is so money oriented like it&rsquo;s coin operated and a lot of people have</p>
<p>Vivid awareness of it being</p>
<p>Coin operated on the right through corporations. This is why</p>
<p>The most heavily regulated industries are the hardest to break into hardest to innovate against</p>
<p>What what I think they miss is how much of it&rsquo;s right is is is regulatory capture on the left</p>
<p>And the difference that a union has versus a company is it&rsquo;s a natural monopoly</p>
<p>And so it actually has more power to write regulation</p>
<p>Than a company does. Um, but and it&rsquo;s going to be around every single election cycle</p>
<p>so if you listen to them, you know, you get what you want and</p>
<p>the you know people have pointed out that the um,</p>
<p>The gentleman or he&rsquo;s not a gentleman the the individual that that</p>
<p>That killed george floyd probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been on the force if it weren&rsquo;t for the union protecting him</p>
<p>Because of the stuff he had done before</p>
<p>But and this goes back to the red and blue and blindness of just being dogmatic to your party</p>
<p>most of the people I know that are heavily</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>prescribed to the to the democratic tribe refused to acknowledge</p>
<p>That one of the big problems in police reform comes from the unions</p>
<p>And and you can&rsquo;t see those things unless you take yourself out of that single place</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would tell you the california situation. I think is deeper than than maybe what brad talked about there</p>
<p>The the rule the law that&rsquo;s causing more companies to leave from my perspective than ab5 is something called paga</p>
<p>Which was passed about 25 years ago, but has finally reached momentum where it&rsquo;s causing problems for companies</p>
<p>and this was a law passed by</p>
<p>Litigators with donor dollars in sacramento that lets any lawyer bring a case on behalf of the state</p>
<p>against the company</p>
<p>And so they they&rsquo;re basically like local sheriffs just running around bringing claims and of course</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll settle every time the the the supposed victims are getting about 10 on average</p>
<p>On paga claims and once your company&rsquo;s been shook down on three or four paga claims by a lawyer</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s only going to give 10 cents on the dollar to these?</p>
<p>People that used to work for you. You finally just throw up your hands and say, you know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to hire someone here. I&rsquo;ll hire someone somewhere else cost twice as much to hire someone here</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>I I do worry that if any state or country wants to move forward</p>
<p>In in our new economy, they can&rsquo;t just be completely anti-business anti-tech</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that I have a strong point of view on that, but</p>
<p>It it won&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;re gonna grind to a halt. Hey, jay. Jason. Can we go back to the senate?</p>
<p>Is anybody prepared to I i&rsquo;m getting a read from my analysts?</p>
<p>Who are live blogging to me that the senate is almost certain to go republican at this point</p>
<p>With iowa, maine and north carolina going republican</p>
<p>That would do it and michigan and montana both in real danger for democrats, but even if they lost both of those</p>
<p>Um, you&rsquo;re gonna have 51 49</p>
<p>to republicans in the senate</p>
<p>Hey, brad, why are markets trading down a bit right now from where they were?</p>
<p>Um, I still have it at uh, you know nasdaq 280</p>
<p>Yeah, so i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not prepared to call that down. I just think that&rsquo;s within it&rsquo;s bouncing and bovada, I guess which is the um,</p>
<p>Nevada just came back up. They stopped taking action now. They&rsquo;ve got trump</p>
<p>Uh minus 150. Is that how you say it and joe biden plus 115?</p>
<p>So to if you put a hundred dollars on joe biden, you win 15. Is that right?</p>
<p>And if you know you want to you win 115</p>
<p>You win 115</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s pretty close win 15</p>
<p>115 is very close</p>
<p>jason</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Donald trump if you were to put a hundred dollars in you make 150. Is that right phil hellmuth?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to know</p>
<p>150 to win 100</p>
<p>Exactly. Got it. Okay</p>
<p>I think the more surprising thing at this point is it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>you know, and i&rsquo;m certainly going to uh live to regret this but</p>
<p>It appears at this point that the market&rsquo;s going to be up tomorrow</p>
<p>Almost either way and if you look at what the market was saying last week</p>
<p>Uh, you know just yet another surprise</p>
<p>Um, the market is celebrating the fact that this is a close election</p>
<p>um, but you know if it&rsquo;s a uh,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a contested transfer of power and we have a you know, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of room for</p>
<p>Uncertainty uncertainty to still be injected into this but it likes the fact that we whether it&rsquo;s biden or trump</p>
<p>Uh who pulls out the presidency is certainly liking the fact that it&rsquo;s going to be a close election</p>
<p>Right now just to give people an indication fox news has joe biden at 227 electoral votes and trump at 204</p>
<p>The new york times is at 213 and 136 for trump</p>
<p>The senate on the new york times is 44 dems</p>
<p>45 republicans</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re supposed to who we&rsquo;re supposed to trust here</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a senate the senate on fox news is 45 democrat</p>
<p>44 republican</p>
<p>So this is a dead heat which I think could lean us towards the great reconciliation</p>
<p>Which is if trump comes out of office</p>
<p>Biden becomes the elder statesman biden reaches across the aisle. We have a massive balance of power in the senate</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s forced to work together in order to get anything done. Am I correct in my reading of this as a non-political expert?</p>
<p>Well, what you&rsquo;re describing is the great gerontocracy. We&rsquo;ll have 78 year old biden</p>
<p>negotiating</p>
<p>79 year old mcconnell and schumer is what 74 75?</p>
<p>Pelosi&rsquo;s over 80 stinney hoyer. Her deputy is over 80. So who do we have in the death pool?</p>
<p>Because two or three of those are dying in the next four years</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to make it dark, but uh</p>
<p>Just looking at mcconnell and his bruised, uh hands and lips and everything. Uh, something&rsquo;s eating him alive</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m, not exactly sure what it is, but uh</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bad bad scene</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Is that on the betting markets phil?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not on the betting markets and by the way the other direction you&rsquo;re talking about trump who&rsquo;s 74</p>
<p>Negotiating. I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s everybody we&rsquo;ve got to get younger in our political leadership across the board</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s there. It&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>Who who had a better chance?</p>
<p>of beating</p>
<p>trump would bernie elizabeth warren or buddha judge would one of those three if you had to pick one of those three and</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of those rates or you could pick your other which one would have performed better brad</p>
<p>You said i&rsquo;m with brad. I&rsquo;m with brad on mayor pete for sure. I&rsquo;m with brad on that one here</p>
<p>Okay, so bill you believe mayor pete</p>
<p>Would have had a better performance. He would have been more inspiring</p>
<p>He would have been more energy. I I think that there is a lot of people that that want</p>
<p>what brad talked about which is someone who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s rational and calm and and</p>
<p>Centered and I also think that if you look at the history of</p>
<p>of presidential campaigns</p>
<p>Most americans favor an outsider and I I attribute that to personally to them</p>
<p>feeling like washington&rsquo;s on the hook and been bought and</p>
<p>You know biden would be an outlier for a lifetime senator. I mean, there was a lot</p>
<p>There was a lot of excitement around obama. There was a lot of excitement about reagan who came, you know from hollywood</p>
<p>There was a lot of excitement about clinton</p>
<p>So, you know a lot of governors a lot of a lot of first-time senators is what you tend to see</p>
<p>And so pete fit that mold</p>
<p>Why some youth and some charisma would be nice</p>
<p>Uh and and david the two davids and michael</p>
<p>Who do you think would have put up the best fight?</p>
<p>because tonight</p>
<p>If biden does win and it&rsquo;s feeling maybe like that&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s clearly a jump ball here. It&rsquo;s any it&rsquo;s coming down to the last 30 sec last minute of the game if biden</p>
<p>does lose</p>
<p>Who would have been the candidate that would have?</p>
<p>Beaten trump if there was another one who would have had the next best chance david&rsquo;s well</p>
<p>Well biden&rsquo;s still looking pretty good right now</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know that there I don&rsquo;t know that there was somebody better, but I do agree that I always was</p>
<p>most impressed with</p>
<p>Buddha judge out of the candidates in the sense that</p>
<p>I thought he was the most articulate. I thought he was the best debater</p>
<p>I thought he was the best on tv and he knew how to reach for the center</p>
<p>and he had the kind of obama thing of</p>
<p>Having identity politics politics working for him, but without making a big deal out of it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And um, and so yeah, I mean what you mean by that. Mr. Sacks. Well, he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s gay</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be the first gay president, but he&rsquo;s not making that an explicit part of the reason to vote for him</p>
<p>And but it would have been a first and his voters would know that but he doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>You know, he doesn&rsquo;t want to run on the idea of identity politics. And so so he&rsquo;s not leading with that</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not leading with it. I think that&rsquo;s a smart way to play it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you know obama was obviously making an incredibly important first</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t lead with that as the reason why you should vote for him</p>
<p>um, so to a certain extent hillary did lead with that hillary was going to be the i&rsquo;m with her, you know, and</p>
<p>Was the slogan?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think a lot of people did want to make that first, but I think</p>
<p>You have those votes. You need to make the case to everybody else</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>So yeah, I think he he&rsquo;s a great political athlete</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>You know, someone&rsquo;s got probably a bright future in the democrat party</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing some people on twitter say that biden&rsquo;s now become the favorite but I just checked pet fair. It&rsquo;s basically 1.1</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very close now kind of crazy</p>
<p>This is going to come down to one</p>
<p>This is going to come down to pennsylvania, michigan</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to take days to do those counts and we&rsquo;re probably gonna end up in the courts</p>
<p>Friedberg who would have done a better job here?</p>
<p>Look, I mean the market already voted right it voted for for biden</p>
<p>He is the the leading candidate. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else would have outperformed biden at this point</p>
<p>I think you know, the next in line was a very different ideology and that&rsquo;s bernie and</p>
<p>um, you know bernie really is the contrast to um,</p>
<p>You know the points that we were making earlier</p>
<p>you either think that the way forward is to have</p>
<p>The government leave me alone or to wrap me up in a blanket and give me a hot cocoa and rub my feet</p>
<p>And bernie sanders is the you know</p>
<p>The guy in middle school who runs for class president and tells you the vending machines are all going to be free if you elect me</p>
<p>um, and that&rsquo;s a broadly</p>
<p>You know like everyone votes for that guy</p>
<p>and let me uh</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question brad that I build off of david</p>
<p>I just think the mayor pete thing by the way</p>
<p>Let me just say I think mayor pete is a great articulate thoughtful guy</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s certainly appealing to those of us who want to have a thoughtful</p>
<p>Well articulated response to the problems we&rsquo;re facing</p>
<p>But I think that there is a guttural kind of you know innate um drive that folks want they either want free shit</p>
<p>Or they want to be left alone</p>
<p>And you know you you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re gonna need to appeal to one of those two motives</p>
<p>Brad how would you have voted had your choice been and i&rsquo;m going to go around the horn on this?</p>
<p>So everybody gets a chance to think about it except really brad</p>
<p>Brad if you had the choice, yep</p>
<p>elizabeth warren slash bernie</p>
<p>Hardcore socialists. Let&rsquo;s go with bernie since I think he&rsquo;s even more on the socialist side</p>
<p>or trump</p>
<p>Could you have conceived of voting for trump over bernie or would you have voted actually voted for bernie sanders?</p>
<p>Take your time and you can think out loud when you answer that. No, I mean I I have to say that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>You know, I have a 9 and 12 year old boy</p>
<p>boys and um the conversation we had is it&rsquo;s not just about</p>
<p>What you stand for it&rsquo;s about how you stand for it</p>
<p>character</p>
<p>Character, and I just couldn&rsquo;t tolerate</p>
<p>uh trump&rsquo;s character either in my own life my own level of anxiety or or</p>
<p>Standing for that, you know and and telling my boys that that&rsquo;s a okay way to lead</p>
<p>And um, so for me, I was willing to vote against my own interests</p>
<p>um, and</p>
<p>Taking comfort in the fact that four years under any president is not enough to really change the arc</p>
<p>of uh of of the country</p>
<p>Um, but to send a signal that you know, how you lead matters in this country</p>
<p>In this country</p>
<p>And uh a rejection of this form of leadership</p>
<p>Yeah, but brad if you didn&rsquo;t think that bernie sanders policies would actually I mean if you thought they would actually pass everything</p>
<p>He wanted to do you couldn&rsquo;t conceive then of voting for trump</p>
<p>yeah, I mean</p>
<p>you know again, like I would just say that I would have bet that</p>
<p>the system that we have</p>
<p>Would have been slow enough in moving</p>
<p>That that bernie would not have been you know that when weighing those two evils</p>
<p>Right that you know again for me socialism versus trump or you&rsquo;re doing I can I can tolerate the mean-spiritedness</p>
<p>perhaps myself</p>
<p>um, but you know, like i&rsquo;m trying to you know, I think it is important that we we say that like this is not</p>
<p>what we stand for this is not a</p>
<p>an honorable way to lead and and certainly when it comes to</p>
<p>Sitting around the dinner table every night and talking to them about the way I expect them to behave in their form of leadership</p>
<p>You know that that mean-spiritedness just didn&rsquo;t work for me</p>
<p>Would anybody else like to answer that question or is it?</p>
<p>Well, i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not going to disagree with any of that, but I would just like to point out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask a question actually which is</p>
<p>if if this president</p>
<p>Was so bad that he had to be impeached. Why wasn&rsquo;t that a campaign issue?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember being mentioned once</p>
<p>by biden</p>
<p>That trump was impeached you would think that impeaching the president would be something you&rsquo;d want to make a major campaign issue</p>
<p>So I just think this idea that trump is the only one who&rsquo;s dishonest and unethical</p>
<p>um, you know that whole russian</p>
<p>Insane hoax that they put us through for years. They put this whole country through</p>
<p>Before the guy even took office. They were trying to delegitimize his election</p>
<p>I mean, come on</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just look at trump&rsquo;s behavior, which I agree is outrageous and not look at the other side and say they&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>Same thing and this is like a they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re sort of like co-equal</p>
<p>Partners in this chaos that&rsquo;s been uh created david. Let&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re co-founders in chaos</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be candid all these politicians that we&rsquo;ve had to live with in our lifetime are grifters</p>
<p>We know that and their kids are grifters</p>
<p>Putting that aside. Do you think there is any chance?</p>
<p>That the russians have not bought an inordinate amount of apartments from donald trump at extraordinary prices</p>
<p>Are you just making that up or?</p>
<p>I mean, i&rsquo;m just going with my gut</p>
<p>Right exactly. Yeah qed case in point because you feel it you can now make an accusation</p>
<p>That the president has received bribes from the russians. I mean, come on</p>
<p>Well, we know and actually I want to I want to bring up something election</p>
<p>We all know putin interfered with the election and we all know he interfered on behalf of one candidate</p>
<p>Okay, I I honestly like unless you don&rsquo;t trust the cia unless you don&rsquo;t trust the fbi</p>
<p>If you unless you don&rsquo;t trust our agents really, I mean you believe in the deep you&rsquo;re still holding the russians</p>
<p>Every election we&rsquo;ve ever had jason</p>
<p>Than the new york post we had we had bob we had bob mueller with a team of like 18</p>
<p>Like pitbull democratic prosecutors and 50 special</p>
<p>Fbi agents, let me finish what happened to manifer who investigated for two years and they couldn&rsquo;t find any collusion</p>
<p>I mean come on and you&rsquo;re still hanging on to this this insane</p>
<p>Fallacy and you&rsquo;re wondering why the american people are turning</p>
<p>Against why they&rsquo;re willing to vote for trump again. Come on. Can&rsquo;t you see the insanity of the other side?</p>
<p>Well, I mean I did see manifer go to jail and pay a 25 30 million dollar fine</p>
<p>And I did see that</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s kids took the meeting with the russians to try to set up a secret back channel</p>
<p>So while they might not have been smart enough or effective enough to actually collude</p>
<p>There certainly was a lot of graph going. This is this is this is on the level</p>
<p>If not worse than the whole hunter biden hard drive story, which I thought</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Which I thought was a ridiculous story an attempt to smear up biden</p>
<p>Come on</p>
<p>For you to lay this integrity issue on trump alone, which I agree</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some truth there and not lay it on his democratic</p>
<p>Inquisitors in the senate who put in the house who put us through this impeachment hoax for two years. Come on</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to sound a little like am radio. Let&rsquo;s get it. We did go there. No sax is a free thinker</p>
<p>I like this. He&rsquo;s a free thinker for sure</p>
<p>But this word impeachment this entire campaign all sax is saying is own both sides of this</p>
<p>Jason can you say the word i&rsquo;m agreeing with you? Can you say it biden?</p>
<p>Can you say the word impeachment?</p>
<p>Impeachment, I just said, okay. There we go. I was wondering what happened to that word, you know, normally</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it was a winning strategy if normally when you impeach a president it becomes a really big campaign issue</p>
<p>It becomes a really big campaign issue nick. Can you please throw georgia back on the map, please?</p>
<p>Are you guys seeing this that that now they&rsquo;re tipping georgia back?</p>
<p>to uh</p>
<p>biden</p>
<p>Who is</p>
<p>This is insane</p>
<p>Where well, they&rsquo;re also saying that arizona may have been prematurely called for biden. So arizona may be back in play for trump</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Was really weird that they called arizona so early wasn&rsquo;t it nick and only fox only fox has done it I think yeah</p>
<p>Nick, where do you have? How do you have georgia reporting right now? How much is in right now?</p>
<p>uh, yeah kick on georgia just for a second we have</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Yeah, the times had it flip on at 9 13 p.m. I have a screenshot which shows biden plus four</p>
<p>And then north carolina is now just trump plus 1.1</p>
<p>Michael isn&rsquo;t in arizona when they show the reporting it&rsquo;s precincts reporting, right? It doesn&rsquo;t show</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Mail-ins are by precinct or mail-ins are at the state level. Well, a precinct will have both mail-ins and uh election day votes</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>And when they and when they say 81 percent of precincts reporting that doesn&rsquo;t mean that 81 percent of precincts</p>
<p>Are finished reporting. It&rsquo;s a very misleading</p>
<p>Uh number because what it means that 81 percent of precincts have reported</p>
<p>What they have but doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re finished counting necessarily, right?</p>
<p>So, you know atlanta is probably the precincts in atlanta have probably reported some vote</p>
<p>In fact, we we see that when we click on it</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s obviously a lot of outstanding vote</p>
<p>in georgia</p>
<p>there could be outstanding vote, uh in some precincts in north carolina as well and they</p>
<p>At this point once you get into the 95 percent and above range they do tend to be</p>
<p>Uh urban centers that are that obviously have a lot more vote to count. It gets late at night. They go home</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>They finish in the morning or three days later if you go zoom in on arizona, please 76</p>
<p>Of voting reporting. I mean, how is this possible?</p>
<p>54 basically, I don&rsquo;t know but in all those states you&rsquo;re going to have the intensity you had around hanging chads</p>
<p>and dade county you&rsquo;re just gonna have</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>massive tension and drama around</p>
<p>Counting each of these last. Oh, yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna have five floridas</p>
<p>You knew 2020 would do this on the way out the door</p>
<p>Yeah, so so arizona they counted all the the absentee ballots for the mail-in ballots first, but the in-person voting hasn&rsquo;t been counted yet</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t call that state if they haven&rsquo;t counted all the in-person because trump&rsquo;s going to do better</p>
<p>With you know election day ballots, I agree. It&rsquo;s pretty premature. Well, it depends on whether they&rsquo;re considering phoenix as part of that, right?</p>
<p>Okay, why is nevada only reporting one percent?</p>
<p>In local news there are now groups of people gathering at oakland city hall</p>
<p>So they they go there when like</p>
<p>What night aren&rsquo;t they riding in oakland, I mean come on</p>
<p>In berkeley, they smashed a pizzeria window. They do it every other week</p>
<p>Hey, hey guys, I want to I want to just discuss an idea</p>
<p>I have that might be a little bit cheeky</p>
<p>But since j cal and I were getting into it before I kind of want to I want to talk about a little bit</p>
<p>um, okay, let&rsquo;s do it, which is I i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>called the trump derangement score</p>
<p>Um, which is if you go to twitter that yeah trump derangement score</p>
<p>Which is if you go to twitter</p>
<p>And search trump</p>
<p>From your username. It&rsquo;ll show you how many tweets you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve published</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;ve posted that mentioned the word trump. And um, so I did this before the show to see</p>
<p>Which bestie had tweeted the most?</p>
<p>And see what the score was and my sense is like if your your score is like zero to ten</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t really paid a lot of attention to trump</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably like very healthy and then if you&rsquo;re in like the 10 to 30 range</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying a little more attention. This could be a normal interest here it comes</p>
<p>Hold on if you&rsquo;re in like the 30 to 50 range, I think you pretty much are infected. There&rsquo;s two strains</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of the magus strain and then there&rsquo;s the resistance strain, but clearly you&rsquo;ve tested positive for</p>
<p>trump derangement</p>
<p>syndrome</p>
<p>and then I would say there&rsquo;s kind of like an advanced level where um</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even count how many tweets there are you&rsquo;ve got to like scroll and like you keep scrolling</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t even get to the bottom</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s like a level of infection where you need to immediately quarantine yourself and um,</p>
<p>so anyway, I I I did this and uh,</p>
<p>And anyway, the winner actually was freeberg freeberg only had he had a score of one. He literally only had one tweet</p>
<p>Mentioning trump for the last four years</p>
<p>I only had eight but in fairness five of them were posted yesterday to advertise this this pod. So I</p>
<p>Um</p>
<p>My one was during this podcast by the way, yeah</p>
<p>20 I had 20</p>
<p>You had about 20 about 20. Yeah</p>
<p>And then jake al you you were in scrolling territory. I couldn&rsquo;t even I couldn&rsquo;t even count I gave up</p>
<p>Ha ha ha</p>
<p>Well played</p>
<p>I feel for you. I I really feel for you that you&rsquo;re hurting over this election</p>
<p>I you know, I don&rsquo;t like i&rsquo;m not trying to make fun of you or or see you. Hey guys guys</p>
<p>another just another quick update here that um,</p>
<p>uh decob county fulton county and cop county in georgia are</p>
<p>pro-democrat</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re huge</p>
<p>uh, and they&rsquo;re at 31 percent 58 percent and</p>
<p>70 percent and if you play these out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s somewhere between 400 and 500</p>
<p>thousand, uh</p>
<p>potential incremental votes for biden</p>
<p>Which would eke out georgia for biden potentially according to</p>
<p>Just this last wow</p>
<p>Just looking at fox news, I think that they&rsquo;re trolling the libs</p>
<p>Because they have trump at 210</p>
<p>Uh, and they have joe biden at 237</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>The the new york times has let me just make sure i&rsquo;m refreshing here and have the latest data</p>
<p>213 to 145. So</p>
<p>Fox is aggressively calling</p>
<p>electoral votes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>at a level that uh</p>
<p>Uh</p>
<p>The new york times is is far behind like behind by 50</p>
<p>at least a hundred</p>
<p>What what is the explanation of this? Wow?</p>
<p>Uh, I this is I mean, this is nuts. Um msnbc 205 electoral votes for joe biden</p>
<p>which uh</p>
<p>NBC has been the most conservative overall</p>
<p>And what happens if it&rsquo;s tied it can tie right we still have that scenario on the table 269 269, uh, uh,</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s probably a way to to get there</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see. Well, interestingly, uh</p>
<p>Biden did not get that one</p>
<p>District in omaha nebraska that he had targeted that obama won his first time</p>
<p>That would give you one electoral vote in in nebraska nebraska and maine</p>
<p>Both</p>
<p>you get you get uh</p>
<p>Two for winning the state and you get one for each of the congressional districts. So</p>
<p>Well, while biden was not going to play in overall in nebraska</p>
<p>He had a shot at omaha and that 270 268 scenario. We talked about earlier</p>
<p>Could have potentially been 269 269 if that omaha district was in play</p>
<p>But the polling really missed it michael just to jump in. Uh bg girl</p>
<p>Girly&rsquo;s gotta hop off boys say bye to girl. Thanks. I appreciate it</p>
<p>Speaking of bill girly, uh, how about texas? I mean, I think I think texas is definitely going to be republican, right michael</p>
<p>Yeah, that one&rsquo;s trending far away from biden. He looks like he&rsquo;s down about 500 000. How many points is that?</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s called that yet, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bizarre that florida and texas are still listed as uh,</p>
<p>Uh, right so that could explain what jacob&rsquo;s looking at between the disparity and yeah</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame if if fox called texas, I don&rsquo;t blame them, but I think arizona. Yeah, that might</p>
<p>That might that would explain your difference jaco texas and florida</p>
<p>Fox. Yeah, fox. Yeah, that&rsquo;s 60 67 votes right there</p>
<p>Yeah, that explains it. Yeah, so the new york times has not called florida or texas</p>
<p>New york times at florida 98 i&rsquo;m getting it&rsquo;s like 99.9 or something right if you add</p>
<p>Uh 38 for texas 29 for florida. You&rsquo;re 67</p>
<p>67 until the 145</p>
<p>Put you at 212</p>
<p>And joe biden at 213</p>
<p>Which would be one point difference ralph warnock and kelly loeffler and a runoff for the senate seat in georgia</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just incredible. I mean, hey guys a comment and then a question</p>
<p>Uh, it looks like the washington post is projecting that california approved prop 22</p>
<p>um, so there&rsquo;s a uh, that&rsquo;s the first one that due to</p>
<p>Right now I think right do we have biden is not speaking yet, but he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s getting ready to speak the implied volatility on uber stock</p>
<p>At the close today was 14 percent</p>
<p>By the way, every ballot initiative in san francisco the city level ballot initiatives passed</p>
<p>One of them the prop h was good all the rest were a disaster</p>
<p>So sam so the the state level ballot initiatives were pretty good news for california, but san francisco</p>
<p>Okay, not much not so good</p>
<p>So, you know in in terms of what we were talking about earlier about creating a more business friendly environment</p>
<p>Unfortunately what happened in san francisco? I think california as a whole is positive with prop 22 prop 15</p>
<p>failing</p>
<p>Um, but every single crazy ballot initiative in san francisco passed</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just getting crazier in san francisco</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you did this in your household</p>
<p>but with my 10 year old brad, I went through my wife and I jade we we went through each of the</p>
<p>uh ballot initiatives as many as we could we listened to</p>
<p>little encapsulations of</p>
<p>What they were and we talked about the stem cell one</p>
<p>And I just thought why is california?</p>
<p>Which is losing</p>
<p>All of these businesses adding to the tax burden</p>
<p>stem cell research</p>
<p>And why isn&rsquo;t that being done by the private sector if there is a huge prize to be had with stem cell?</p>
<p>Why would we have california send billions of dollars on this when we&rsquo;re losing all the this government? I&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>You know how people thought about something like that like the stem cell. Did you vote for that david?</p>
<p>To continue to have california flip the bill first</p>
<p>I by the way, just before you answer david</p>
<p>I took the pages of the ballot initiative and I used them to keep my white truffles from developing humidity</p>
<p>I mean basically the truth of the matter jason is that when when I don&rsquo;t understand a ballot initiative, I just vote against it</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t really understand that the some the stem cell ballot initiative or why</p>
<p>Even why if if that was a spending priority why it couldn&rsquo;t just be handled by the state, you know the legislature</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand why that needed to be a ballot initiative</p>
<p>So, you know, I feel like ballot initiatives like i&rsquo;ll support them when this when the state legislature does something wrong</p>
<p>like it was a perfect example where</p>
<p>You know lorraine or whatever the had this tremendous amount of power passed this crazy ab5 and the people had to overrule that</p>
<p>um, so I feel like that&rsquo;s where like these ballot initiatives make sense is when you want to overrule the legislature, but</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s kind of crazy for</p>
<p>To be passing these laws directly when you know, we don&rsquo;t know that much about them</p>
<p>Concur</p>
<p>I mean the founders had this vision of representative democracy not direct democracy and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally a good idea</p>
<p>So jason, I don&rsquo;t know you have to kind of like what director the results that direct democracy has produced tonight</p>
<p>The initiatives may be saving us from ourselves since we don&rsquo;t have in this state. Unfortunately a viable republican party to represent us</p>
<p>Uh, this the initiatives may be our last line of defense</p>
<p>Well, I think I think you&rsquo;re right in terms of overruling things but like in san francisco</p>
<p>You know every single ballot initiative path, I think most of them are there&rsquo;s no saving san francisco. We all knew that</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t like hearing that</p>
<p>Come to la baby, we we got a few more years at least</p>
<p>Um, what is the consensus view seems to be the markets are still up nasdaq futures up 280 still</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>What causes us to wake up tomorrow or the next day?</p>
<p>And have the futures down</p>
<p>Three four or five hundred bits. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s one thing and so far it hasn&rsquo;t happened. And if we avoid it</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to fade a really big out here</p>
<p>um, which is trump</p>
<p>Declares victory right now</p>
<p>I think that is the disaster scenario because I think biden&rsquo;s going to get up there</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to say much of anything. He&rsquo;ll be very kind of down the middle</p>
<p>You know kind of let&rsquo;s take a wait-and-see approach. We&rsquo;re waiting until tomorrow. There&rsquo;s a lot to go</p>
<p>Grind it out blah blah blah, but if trump comes out and says we won we&rsquo;re done. Let&rsquo;s move on</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be uh panic because look I mean he&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t certify georgia apparently, right?</p>
<p>So, you know there there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a path where there&rsquo;s seven or eight states that have to go through on a meticulous recount</p>
<p>I think this thing is back to a coin flip. I mean trump now has to win</p>
<p>georgia</p>
<p>Michigan and pennsylvania</p>
<p>In order to win the presidency if biden wins any one of those three states he wins</p>
<p>He has to be a three for three in georgia pennsylvania</p>
<p>and michigan</p>
<p>Three for three and god</p>
<p>Well, but we&rsquo;re saying that may that may become ungod. Um</p>
<p>So if if he loses georgia, he loses if he loses pennsylvania, he loses if he loses michigan he loses assuming he&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>um lost wisconsin and</p>
<p>Um and arizona, so hey guys biden&rsquo;s coming out, but my analysts just run this analysis</p>
<p>If biden wins ann arbor and detroit by the same percentage as 2016</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 420 000 biden incremental votes versus the 300 000 current trump lead</p>
<p>Just apply the math and he wins michigan. We feel good about where we are</p>
<p>We really do</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to tell you tonight. We believe we&rsquo;re on track to win this election</p>
<p>We knew because of the unprecedented early vote in the mail-in vote</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to take a while</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to be patient</p>
<p>Until we uh, the hard work of tallying the votes is finished</p>
<p>And it ain&rsquo;t over till every vote is counted every ballot is counted</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re feeling good</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re feeling good about where we are</p>
<p>We believe one of the nets has suggested. We&rsquo;ve already won arizona, but we&rsquo;re confident about arizona</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a turnaround</p>
<p>We also just called it for minnesota</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still in the game in georgia, although that&rsquo;s not what we expected</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re feeling real good about wisconsin and michigan</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s going to take time to count the votes we&rsquo;re going to win pennsylvania</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>There it is</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk to the folks in philly allegheny county scranton and they&rsquo;re really encouraged by the turnout and what they see</p>
<p>look</p>
<p>You know, we could know the results</p>
<p>As early as tomorrow morning</p>
<p>But it may take a little longer as i&rsquo;ve said all along</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my place or donald trump&rsquo;s place to declare who&rsquo;s won this election</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the decision of the american people</p>
<p>But i&rsquo;m optimistic about this outcome</p>
<p>And I want to thank every one of you came out and voted in this election</p>
<p>And by the way, chris coons and the democrats. Congratulations here in delaware</p>
<p>Hey john the gov, yeah</p>
<p>The whole team man. You&rsquo;ve done a great job. I&rsquo;m grateful</p>
<p>to the poll workers to our volunteers our canvassers</p>
<p>Everyone who participated in this democratic process</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;m grateful to all of my supporters here in delaware and all across the nation</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you</p>
<p>and folks</p>
<p>You heard me say it before</p>
<p>Every time I walk out of my grandpa&rsquo;s house up in scranton. He yelled joey</p>
<p>Keep the faith</p>
<p>And my grandma when she was alive, he&rsquo;ll know joey spread it keep the faith guys. We&rsquo;re gonna win this</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you</p>
<p>Oh my god, well there you guys before</p>
<p>Before before we just I just want to give a big shout out and thank you to brad gersner. Um, thanks brad incredible investor and person</p>
<p>And thinker. Thank you bg for uh</p>
<p>Being on the call. Thanks for having me guys. I really appreciate it</p>
<p>Thanks to bill girley who stepped in and phil helm youth</p>
<p>Uh, this has been a great first time effort. Uh</p>
<p>We we had uh, I think about 4 000 of you at the peak</p>
<p>Here and and certainly five or six thousand over the night. This was an experiment</p>
<p>I think a successful one</p>
<p>Um, and of course i&rsquo;m speaking about this country america. What a successful experiment it has been</p>
<p>Jason you can unclench</p>
<p>Your your nether regions because I think we&rsquo;re going to be okay, I think we&rsquo;re going to be okay</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very tight. Anyways. See you guys. Good night. Thank you. Thank you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m changing my prediction to scenario three biden president. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let&rsquo;s do that as we wrap besties</p>
<p>besties</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still sticking with biden. I&rsquo;m still sticking with biden</p>
<p>Okay, trump trump just tweeted that I will be making a statement tonight a big win. So we we&rsquo;re either in scenarios</p>
<p>well, I mean</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two three and two three and four are all still on the table</p>
<p>Just for I don&rsquo;t know if the viewers remember scenario one was a biden landslide. That&rsquo;s clearly not off the table two</p>
<p>Was um was basically, um</p>
<p>what was</p>
<p>Was um trump pulling a big upset that&rsquo;s still on the table i&rsquo;d say probably</p>
<p>49 percent chance right now 40 45 percent chance</p>
<p>uh, then you&rsquo;ve kind of got the scenario three was the soft landing where biden wins the presidency, but the republicans take</p>
<p>the uh the senate</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s probably like the 51 and then scenario four was the shit show that was a totally inconclusive outcome</p>
<p>And here we are here we are. So, I mean the reality is I think this thing</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s probably at the end of the day</p>
<p>5149 in favor of biden right now, but we probably have at least three more days and maybe a bunch of court cases</p>
<p>Yeah, this could this could be really bad. I mean, we may not know who the winner is till</p>
<p>December and this may require another supreme court case</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll know within a week who won</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to be a it&rsquo;s going to be a white knuckle kind of week. We um, did you know?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to know tomorrow</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna know tomorrow. I&rsquo;m with john. I I I guess you know, I guess based on the electoral map</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s 5149 in favor of biden at this moment. Okay, so sax wants biden to win</p>
<p>Friedberg where are you at the end of this shit show?</p>
<p>I was doing this 2020. I was looking at which island in hawaii. I want to go to</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at austin and then just to uh, look at our final</p>
<p>The dots are getting a little better for trump, I wonder</p>
<p>Who the hell knows no, uh, this has been an incredible evening. I just feel better about the market reaction</p>
<p>I feel like you know</p>
<p>Those of us who operate businesses and try and build businesses and you know have employees and all this stuff</p>
<p>I mean i&rsquo;m disappointed in san francisco. It&rsquo;s a fucking shit show of the city</p>
<p>But uh, I feel good about the fact that markets are taking this well</p>
<p>and it you know means businesses will continue to operate and find funding and</p>
<p>Shout out billy in hawaii. Muthi berg is muthi. What&rsquo;s your pick and then j. Cal and then we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re gonna bounce</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to go with the math. I think trump uh dollar 60 is pretty significant. So</p>
<p>I have to pick that direction and i&rsquo;m going by all right, everybody</p>
<p>This has been a special edition of the love you besties</p>
<p>Michael besties. Thank you. Thank you for having me. I enjoyed it. Thank you. Later guys</p>
<p>The poker table soon. Yeah, hopefully soon. Yes. Bye. Bye</p>
