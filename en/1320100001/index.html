    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Connie Loizis, and this is Alex Gove, and this is Strictly VC Download.</p>
<p>Hey everybody, hope you&rsquo;ve had a good week. We are just beginning to dry out here in Marin</p>
<p>after weeks and weeks of rain. Speaking of misery, perhaps the biggest story this week is all of the</p>
<p>layoffs that have been taking place. On Wednesday, Microsoft sacked 10,000 employees, roughly 5% of</p>
<p>its workforce. And today, Google&rsquo;s parent company, Alphabet, announced that it is laying off 12,000</p>
<p>workers, or approximately 6% of its total employees. When you also take into account</p>
<p>the massive number of folks Meta, Amazon, and Salesforce have cut in recent weeks,</p>
<p>it feels like open season on the technorati. With the disappearance of so many jobs,</p>
<p>all of this talk about AI and chat GPT is good news, bad news. On the one hand,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence could spur the creation of the next Google, or Googles. On the other hand,</p>
<p>it also promises to eliminate many jobs forever. One can&rsquo;t help but think about the darker side</p>
<p>of AI when reading an article in today&rsquo;s times entitled, How Smart Are the Robots Getting?</p>
<p>In an opening anecdote, author Cade Metz recounts the experience of Klaus de Graaff,</p>
<p>a chemist from the Netherlands who is playing the online version of Diplomacy,</p>
<p>a legendary strategy game in which players assume the role of a major European power</p>
<p>and attempt to hoodwink other players in the run up to World War I. De Graaff formed an alliance</p>
<p>with a player named Franz Brosef that he believed would allow them to leapfrog the other 18 players</p>
<p>in the game, but Brosef ultimately betrayed de Graaff and finished on top. It should not</p>
<p>surprise you at this point to learn that Brosef was an AI. I was flabbergasted, de Graaff told</p>
<p>the Times. It seemed so genuine, so lifelike. It could read my texts, and converse with me,</p>
<p>and make plans that were mutually beneficial, that would allow both of us to get ahead.</p>
<p>It also lied to me and betrayed me like top players frequently do. As Metz points out,</p>
<p>the Turing test, a framework created by British scientist Alan Turing more than 70 years ago</p>
<p>to determine whether a person is conversing with a man or machine, is now wholly inadequate,</p>
<p>an anachronism in an age when AIs can write novels in the style of James Joyce at the click</p>
<p>of a mouse. Which brings us to Sam Altman, a serial entrepreneur and investor, the former</p>
<p>head of Y Combinator, and now co-founder and president of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Connie sat down with Sam at our event last week in San Francisco, and Sam touched on many topics,</p>
<p>such as OpenAI&rsquo;s deal with Microsoft, what education will look like in a world in which</p>
<p>students can instantly generate term papers, and more. Stay tuned for Connie&rsquo;s interview with Sam.</p>
<p>But first, a word from our sponsor.</p>
<p>Did you know that incorrectly reporting your emissions, or worse yet, not understanding them</p>
<p>in the first place, is a form of greenwashing? It&rsquo;s time to get ahead of regulations and quit</p>
<p>misleading customers and stakeholders. Get a handle on your carbon footprint with</p>
<p>Sustain Life&rsquo;s complete carbon accounting and ESG platform. Learn how to increase the ROI</p>
<p>of your ESG program. Visit sustain.life slash StrictlyVC. That&rsquo;s sustain.life slash StrictlyVC.</p>
<p>And now, yes, I&rsquo;m so excited to introduce Sam Altman. I know you&rsquo;re all so excited about him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled that he&rsquo;s here. Sam is a really good sport because, you know, originally I had talked</p>
<p>to him about having an event with him and his brothers, and life gets busy, and so we realized</p>
<p>a long time ago that that wasn&rsquo;t going to be possible. And he very nicely, despite what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in his life right now, came anyway. So thank you, Sam. So appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>So Sam, you also very nicely came to an event that happened to be right here three years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been happening?</p>
<p>Opened their eye, mostly. Yeah, it&rsquo;s just taken up a lot of my time, but it&rsquo;s super great, and</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re doing a lot of stuff we&rsquo;re really proud of.</p>
<p>I know. I mean, I&rsquo;m half kidding, obviously, but, you know, you&rsquo;ve been at the center of the</p>
<p>startup conversation for almost 10 years since you had taken over as the president of Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Wow, that has been 10 years, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, or something like that.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>Paul Graham once said that Sam is exceedingly good at becoming powerful, which I think is very funny.</p>
<p>But you are now at the center of the national conversation. I mean, to an extent that I think,</p>
<p>you know, sort of has taken us all collectively aback. I&rsquo;m just wondering, how is that for you?</p>
<p>Are you like springing out of bed? Are you like waking up dreading, you know, the headlines?</p>
<p>I saw that you had posted&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t read the news. Honestly, I think if I, and I don&rsquo;t really do stuff like this much,</p>
<p>at all, I think if I could, like, just stop trolling on Twitter, which I really love,</p>
<p>for some reason, I can&rsquo;t explain. I think I would just like really accomplish my goal of</p>
<p>not, you know, being very quiet. But Twitter is fun.</p>
<p>Well, I saw that you posted a barfing emoji yesterday without comment. And I wondered</p>
<p>if that had anything to do with the headlines?</p>
<p>No, I had a bad morning for like extremely pedestrian reasons. Like my house flooded,</p>
<p>I got in a car crash. And, you know, I&rsquo;m allowed to use Twitter like a regular person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry. Sure, absolutely. Oh, well, I mean, we&rsquo;re not here to talk about Twitter,</p>
<p>but any thoughts about, you know, your friend is running it? What do you think? How do you</p>
<p>think things are going?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be fine. I remember that night where everyone was like,</p>
<p>get your tweets off right now. Say your goodbyes. I heard from my like, you know, brothers,</p>
<p>roommates, father&rsquo;s uncle, whatever that like, it&rsquo;s all gonna melt down tonight. And it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s still here. I think it&rsquo;s gonna&hellip;</p>
<p>Because they went to Mastin and then they saw what the alternative was.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s, I would be making some different decisions. But also,</p>
<p>I have like unbelievable respect for Elon, I wouldn&rsquo;t bet against him.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s most likely going to be fine.</p>
<p>Great. Well, you know, there are a lot of reporters here who have been generating the</p>
<p>coverage that we&rsquo;ve all been reading. So I was going to say, if there&rsquo;s anything that</p>
<p>you want to confirm, or correct, I&rsquo;m sure they would be delighted. But in the meantime,</p>
<p>you know, Strictly VC is really about investors and startup founders. And I think in the same</p>
<p>way that people are very interested in open AI because of your involvement, they are really</p>
<p>interested in your work as an investor. So I thought just to start, if it&rsquo;s okay with you,</p>
<p>we could kind of talk a little bit about that aspect of your life. Starting with&hellip;</p>
<p>Sure. But can I correct one thing first? I don&rsquo;t think people are interested in open AI</p>
<p>because of my involvement. I think open AI has managed to pull together the most talent dense</p>
<p>researchers and engineers in the field of AI, who have done just like incredible work. And I think</p>
<p>what people are interested in is like, open AI from a cold start a few years ago has managed to</p>
<p>do this thing that I think is going to be incredibly important to the next many decades,</p>
<p>at least of society and how we all live our lives and what we do and what&rsquo;s possible. And I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be tremendously good. But the reason people I think are interested in open AI is</p>
<p>because of the work that those people do. We&rsquo;ve managed to make a research lab that has been able</p>
<p>to deliver some cool stuff. And I think we&rsquo;ll deliver a lot more cool things. So just wanted</p>
<p>to add that. Absolutely. But I mean, you are one of the best storytellers in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>possibly the business. I think that counts for a lot. So I&rsquo;m going to argue with you there. But</p>
<p>how many investments do you have, like all together? Active. Trying to get a sense for&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, counting all the YC ones, like a few thousand personal ones,</p>
<p>I would guess 400. Wow, really?</p>
<p>Something. Well, I&rsquo;ve been doing this for a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I mean,</p>
<p>and every once in a while I see like a really gigantic deal. What makes a Sam Altman deal?</p>
<p>I try to just do things that I&rsquo;m interested in at this point. One of the things I have realized</p>
<p>is all of the companies I think I have added a lot of value to are the ones that I sort of like</p>
<p>think about in my free time on a hike or whatever, and then text the founders,</p>
<p>hey, I have this idea for you. And I have learned kind of like what those are and the ones that are</p>
<p>not. I think like every founder deserves an investor who is like going to think about them</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re hiking. And so I&rsquo;ve tried to like hold myself to the stuff that I really love,</p>
<p>which tends to be like the hard tech years of R&amp;D, capital intensive or like sort of like risky</p>
<p>research. But if it works, it really works. Well, one of the investments that I think is</p>
<p>so interesting, and obviously it&rsquo;s very interesting to you too, is Helion.</p>
<p>That company announced, so you&rsquo;ve been investing in Helion since 2015,</p>
<p>but announced a $500 million investment last year and you participated, you wrote them a $375</p>
<p>million check, which I think probably surprised people because there&rsquo;s not that many people who</p>
<p>can write a $375 million check. Or not that many people who would like</p>
<p>do it until like one risky fusion company. Well, I mean, I wanted to ask, so you mentioned</p>
<p>your YC companies, and I guess in the aggregate, maybe that&rsquo;s the answer. I just wondered,</p>
<p>which have been your most successful investments to date?</p>
<p>I mean, probably on a multiples basis, definitely on a multiples basis,</p>
<p>Stripe. And also I think that was like my second investment ever. So it seemed like a lot easier.</p>
<p>This was also a time when valuations were different. It was great. But probably that</p>
<p>one on a multiples basis. But then, yeah, I&rsquo;ve been doing this for like 17 years, I guess. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of really good ones. And super grateful to have been in Silicon Valley at what</p>
<p>was such a magical time. Helion is more than an investment to me. That&rsquo;s the other thing besides</p>
<p>OpenAI I spend a lot of time on. And just super excited about what&rsquo;s going to happen there.</p>
<p>So tell me about it, because I don&rsquo;t really, I mean, I don&rsquo;t understand this. I saw what</p>
<p>happened at Lawrence Livermore last month, and I wondered what you thought of that. It&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>different approach. Maybe if you can sort of explain since you&rsquo;re the expert.</p>
<p>Super happy for them. I think it&rsquo;s like a very cool scientific result. As they themselves said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be commercially relevant. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m excited about. Not sort</p>
<p>of getting fusion to work in a lab, although that is cool, too. But building a system that</p>
<p>will work at a super low cost. So if you look at the previous energy transitions, if you can get</p>
<p>the cost of a new form of energy down, it can take over everything else in a couple of decades.</p>
<p>Just phenomenally fast. And then also a system where we can create enough energy,</p>
<p>enough reliable energy, both in terms of the machines not breaking and also not having the</p>
<p>intermittence or the need for storage of solar or wind or something like that. If we can create</p>
<p>enough for Earth in like 10 years, and I think that&rsquo;s actually the hardest challenge that Helion</p>
<p>faces. As we sketch out what it takes operationally to do that, to replace all the</p>
<p>current generative capacity on Earth with fusion and to do it really fast and to think about what</p>
<p>it really means to build a factory that&rsquo;s capable of putting out two of these machines a day for a</p>
<p>decade, that&rsquo;s really hard, but also a super fun problem. So I&rsquo;m very happy there&rsquo;s a fusion race.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;m also very happy solar and batteries are getting so cheap.</p>
<p>But I think what will matter is who can deliver energy the cheapest and enough of it.</p>
<p>And again, just knowing only what I read in a superficial way, why is Helion&rsquo;s approach</p>
<p>to your mind superior than what dozens of nations are working on in the south of France?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, that thing I think probably will work either. But to what I was just saying earlier,</p>
<p>I think it will be commercially irrelevant. They also think it&rsquo;ll be commercially irrelevant.</p>
<p>The thing that is so exciting to me about Helion is that it&rsquo;s a simple machine that is</p>
<p>an affordable cost and a reasonable size. There&rsquo;s a bunch of different elements of it than the</p>
<p>giant tokamaks. But one that is very cool is what comes out of the reaction is charged particles,</p>
<p>not heat. Almost all others, like a coal plant or a natural gas plant or whatever,</p>
<p>makes heat, drives a steam turbine. That&rsquo;s what it does. Helion makes charged particles,</p>
<p>which push back on the magnet and drive an electrical current down a wire. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>heat cycle at all. And so it can be a much simpler, much more efficient system.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is missed out of the whole discussion on fusion, but really great. It also</p>
<p>means we don&rsquo;t have to deal with much nuclear material. We don&rsquo;t ever have dangerous waste or</p>
<p>even a dangerous system. You could touch it pretty shortly after it turns off.</p>
<p>And so I know it&rsquo;s building a big facility right now. Has it proven its thesis?</p>
<p>We will have more to share there shortly.</p>
<p>OK. Well, after talking to you last time a few years ago and looking back on our conversation,</p>
<p>where I was like, ah, Sam. No, everything that you said was going to happen is happening. I</p>
<p>take you more seriously than I did and should have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long way to go, but thank you.</p>
<p>So I also wanted to ask about some of your other investments, one of which I think is really</p>
<p>interesting, Hermes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Hermes is interesting for a few reasons. Hermes is a supersonic jet company that wants</p>
<p>to go at, like, five times the speed of sound. So that&rsquo;s cool. Also, a big investment from you,</p>
<p>I think. It was like a $100 million round that you led. But also, you were involved with a</p>
<p>competitor for a while. You were on the board of Boom Supersonic, whose CEO has also participated</p>
<p>in a Strictly VC event. So just wondering, why change horses?</p>
<p>Yeah. Not at all change horses. Boom is a different technology. And it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>Mach 2-ish airplane instead of a Mach 5-ish airplane. Hermes is like a ramjet technology</p>
<p>that has very different characteristics. But I think there will be, like, it&rsquo;s a huge market.</p>
<p>I think there will be multiple needs. I think these are very different approaches. And my</p>
<p>general approach is, if there&rsquo;s an area that I think is really important, like energy, for</p>
<p>example, I try to fund the best fusion and the best fission company I can. They&rsquo;re competitive</p>
<p>in the sense that they&rsquo;re both trying to make cheap energy, but, like, we desperately need</p>
<p>more cheap energy. It&rsquo;s a huge market. I think they can both work. I wouldn&rsquo;t have funded two,</p>
<p>like, exact same approach airplane companies. But I think these are, like, very different.</p>
<p>And also, you know, you are somebody who thinks about sort of second-order effects.</p>
<p>When you think about Hermes, I mean, first of all, I guess, is it climate-friendly? And second,</p>
<p>what are the impacts, I guess, good and bad of us traveling around the world much faster</p>
<p>than we do right now? Part of my theory is that, so it&rsquo;s not climate-friendly if it&rsquo;s using</p>
<p>current aviation fuel. I think even if something like fusion doesn&rsquo;t happen, there&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>good move to sustainable aviation fuel. And, you know, at some point, we&rsquo;ll be all using that</p>
<p>anyway. If something like fusion does work, it will so change the dynamics of what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>in terms of our ability to create things like aviation fuel easily or capture carbon out of</p>
<p>the atmosphere, and I am confident enough in that working, that things I was much more nervous</p>
<p>about doing a few years ago, like creating faster airplanes that will increase the need for fuel,</p>
<p>because you have to burn a lot more fuel to go even a little bit faster, I&rsquo;m sort of muddling</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of much more open to in terms of like the benefits of traveling fast.</p>
<p>I think human history is like a pretty good, there&rsquo;s like quite good evidence that when we</p>
<p>are able to travel faster and more conveniently, good things happen. More commerce happens,</p>
<p>more innovation happens. I think people develop much more empathy. Certainly the time I have spent</p>
<p>like traveling around the world and seeing very different things, very different problems,</p>
<p>meeting very different people have been like super formative for me, and I think more of</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing. I guess one downside is the spread of disease happens faster, but that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yes, although I like, I think blaming faster planes for the spread of disease rather than</p>
<p>the incompetence of governments and insufficient funding for pandemic response is sort of the</p>
<p>wrong way to go about it. What about WorldCoin? That was a strange one, and that one was not</p>
<p>received well by the media. We probably didn&rsquo;t understand it. You can&rsquo;t win them all. Wait,</p>
<p>wait, can I read the headline in Bloomberg? Please. Sam Altman wants to scan your eyeball</p>
<p>in exchange for cryptocurrency. What is going on with that company? Is it still,</p>
<p>are you still working on it and should we be scared? I am. Yeah, like I think that&rsquo;s they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have more to share soon. I am. I&rsquo;m like a co-founder. I&rsquo;m on the board. I&rsquo;m not day to day</p>
<p>involved, but I think super highly of them. I think the press cycle, it was like came from a</p>
<p>leak. The company hadn&rsquo;t like was not ready to tell its story yet. That was unfortunate. I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll do it soon. And I think it will go over well. I think the need, so I like, I try to think</p>
<p>about like not any individual company, but sort of where the world is going to co-evolve. And I</p>
<p>think at this point, the need for systems that provide proof of personhood and the need for like</p>
<p>new experiments with wealth redistribution and global governance of systems like say,</p>
<p>an AGI is higher. So I&rsquo;m very glad this experiment is running. I&rsquo;d like to see many more. I think</p>
<p>the, like to me personally, and again, people will have different opinions and they&rsquo;ll do what</p>
<p>they want, but like the amount of privacy you give up to like use Facebook or something versus</p>
<p>the amount of privacy you like give up for like a scan of your, of your retina and nothing else.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d much rather have the latter. And many people won&rsquo;t want that and that&rsquo;s fine. But I</p>
<p>think more experiments about how, what we can do, what problems we can solve with technology</p>
<p>in this sort of new world, like great to try that stuff. I think it&rsquo;s a phenomenal team. I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got a great product. I&rsquo;m excited for the launch. When is that? I don&rsquo;t know exactly,</p>
<p>but pretty soon, like months. And you&rsquo;re a co-founder, but you&rsquo;re obviously not</p>
<p>very involved. Correct. Okay. One of the investors I just happened to notice was Sam</p>
<p>Bankman-Freed, who&rsquo;s also like you. I did not know that. Interesting. I really didn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>personally an investor in the company. I mean, according to some report. No, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Are you, do you know him? We met briefly, very briefly once only. Okay. So not enough</p>
<p>to form an opinion. Okay. Scratch that hard questions. Not good. I wanted to ask about</p>
<p>then crypto more broadly. You have a smattering of crypto investments. I don&rsquo;t know how interested</p>
<p>you are, if this is like friends that you&rsquo;ve backed. Honestly, not super interested. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>interested in world coin, not because it&rsquo;s crypto, but because I think it&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting attempt to use technology to solve something that is beyond what even</p>
<p>like governments in the world can effectively do. And I think if we can, if we can use technology,</p>
<p>any technology to experiment with global UBI instead of what one country could do, I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>very happy to see what happens there. But that&rsquo;s not really about any particular technology. I</p>
<p>think crypto is just like a way that we should try implementing that. And we should, again,</p>
<p>try lots and lots of other things. So we don&rsquo;t need a, like a new web. We don&rsquo;t need new</p>
<p>infrastructure. We don&rsquo;t need decentralization. You know, this is like one of the things that</p>
<p>makes me feel really old and out of touch. I&rsquo;ve never quite understood that. Like, I love the</p>
<p>spirit of the Web3 people, but I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t intuitively feel why we need it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s a relief because I think a lot of people feel the same way. I want to</p>
<p>move on soon, but another company that I think is so interesting, and again, these are all so</p>
<p>different and ambitious, is Conception, which is a startup pursuing what&rsquo;s called in vitro</p>
<p>gametogenesis, which refers to turning adult cells into gametes, sperm or egg cells. So,</p>
<p>I mean, is this fantasy? What makes you think that like artificial eggs is possible?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fantasy. You know, there was a recent paper, they really truly have this not working</p>
<p>in mice. Obviously, working in mice is very different than working in humans. We&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>that lesson many times. But it seems to me like it should work at some point. It&rsquo;s not soon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a gigantic amount of work left to do. But I think what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>biotech in general is just tremendously exciting now. It&rsquo;s, you know, I think it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>kind of in the shadow of AI, which has taken over like so much of the of the mindshare. But I think</p>
<p>the next five, seven years of biotech progress is going to be remarkable. And yeah, I think like,</p>
<p>like, if we do this again, three years later, it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll start that one in particular,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go, yeah, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s gonna work. And I think things that are even further out there,</p>
<p>like, you know, human life extension or whatever will also seem like, yeah, maybe that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>work. That&rsquo;s phenomenal. I guess there&rsquo;s obviously a lot of overlap, which is why</p>
<p>you think that these things are going to work. Yeah, I think a lot of these things have these</p>
<p>weirdly synergistic effects with each other. But even without that, I would just say,</p>
<p>a biotech on its own is has made quite a lot of progress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much interesting stuff going on. I interviewed a founder recently,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to extend the life of women&rsquo;s ovaries, which I also think is,</p>
<p>is really interesting. Okay, before we move on, you have been investing for 20 years,</p>
<p>you were the president of Y Combinator for something like five or six years,</p>
<p>you have your successor, Jeff Ralston, just left Gary Tan came in, you had told Tad Friend once,</p>
<p>that when a CEO takes over a company, they have to kind of refound I think was the word you use,</p>
<p>the company, do you think Gary&rsquo;s got to do anything differently?</p>
<p>Gary&rsquo;s awesome. I think Gary will do a lot of things differently, and be wildly successful at</p>
<p>it. We&rsquo;re in a very different world and market now. You know, like, I got to run, I said this</p>
<p>once to somebody, I got to like run YC at the time where like any idiot would have been wildly</p>
<p>successful. And that was great. That was a lot of fun. It&rsquo;s and then like the last couple of years,</p>
<p>I think were really hard. But now, when everything is like bombed out, I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful</p>
<p>opportunity. And I think YC can really remake itself. And I think Gary is an incredible leader</p>
<p>to do that. And at the time when all of the tourists are leaving, and all of the people</p>
<p>who are like, you know, starting startups or raising the their seed fund or whatever,</p>
<p>because it was like the fashionable thing to do are leaving like, this is when the great value</p>
<p>gets created. This is like the best time to start a startup in many, many, many years.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very excited for him.</p>
<p>So moving on to AI, which is where you&rsquo;ve obviously spent the bulk of your time.</p>
<p>Since I saw you, we sat here three years ago. And as I was teasing you, but it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true. You were telling us what was coming. And we all thought you were being sort of like,</p>
<p>you know, hyperbolic, I guess you were dead serious. Why do you think I mean, people knew</p>
<p>that you were working on this Google&rsquo;s working on this. Why do you think that chat GPT and Dolly</p>
<p>so surprised people? I genuinely don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve reflected on it a lot.</p>
<p>We had that we had a model in the we had the model for chat GPT in the API for like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 10 months or something before we made chat GPT. And I sort of thought someone</p>
<p>was going to just build it or whatever. And that, you know, enough people had played around with it.</p>
<p>Definitely, if you make a really good user experience on top of something, like one thing</p>
<p>that I very deeply believed was the way people wanted to interact with these models was via</p>
<p>dialogue. And I, you know, we kept telling people this, we kept trying to convince people to build</p>
<p>it, and people wouldn&rsquo;t quite do it. So we finally said, All right, we&rsquo;re just going to do it.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think the pieces were there for a while. I think one of the reasons I think Dolly</p>
<p>surprised people is if you asked, you know, five or seven years ago, that kind of ironclad wisdom</p>
<p>on AI. First, it comes for physical labor, truck driving, working in a factory, working factory,</p>
<p>then truck driving, then the sort of less demanding cognitive labor, then the really</p>
<p>demanding cognitive labor, like computer programming, and then and then very last of</p>
<p>all, or maybe never, because maybe it&rsquo;s like some deep human special sauce was creativity.</p>
<p>And of course, we can look now and say, really looks like it&rsquo;s going to go exactly the opposite</p>
<p>direction. But I think that is not super intuitive. And so I can see why Dolly surprised people.</p>
<p>But I genuinely felt somewhat confused about why chat GPT did, you know, one of the things we</p>
<p>really believe is that the most responsible way to put this out in society is very gradually,</p>
<p>and to get people, institutions, policymakers, get them familiar with it, thinking about the</p>
<p>implications, feeling the technology, getting a sense for what it can do and can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>very early, rather than drop a super powerful AGI in the world all at once. And so</p>
<p>we put GPT three out almost three years ago. And then we put it into an API, like,</p>
<p>you know, kind of, I think it was maybe like June of two, like two and a half years ago.</p>
<p>And the the incremental update from that to chat GPT, I felt like should have been predictable.</p>
<p>And I want to like do more introspection on why I was sort of miscalibrated on that.</p>
<p>So, you know, you had talked when you were here about releasing things in a responsible way,</p>
<p>I guess, what gave you the confidence to release what you have released already? I mean,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;re ready for it? Are there enough guardrails in place?</p>
<p>It seems like it. We do, we have like an internal process where we kind of try to break things and</p>
<p>study impacts. We use external auditors, we have external red teamers, we work with other labs and</p>
<p>have safety organizations look at stuff. There are societal changes that chat GPT is going to</p>
<p>cause or is causing. There&rsquo;s, I think, a big one going now about the impact of this on education,</p>
<p>academic integrity, all of that. But starting these now, where I think it&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>look at where the stakes are still relatively low, rather than just put out what the whole</p>
<p>industry will have in a few years with no time for society to update, I think would be bad.</p>
<p>COVID did show us for better or for worse, or at least me, that society can update to like</p>
<p>massive changes sort of faster than I would have thought in many ways. But I still think like,</p>
<p>given the magnitude of the economic impact we expect here, more gradual is better. And so</p>
<p>putting out a very weak and imperfect system like chat GPT, and then making it a little better this</p>
<p>year, a little better later this year, a little better next year, that seems much better than</p>
<p>the alternative.</p>
<p>Can you comment on whether GPT-4 is coming out in the first quarter, first half of the year?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll come out at some point when we are like confident that we can do it safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>I think in general, we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would</p>
<p>like. We&rsquo;re going to sit on it for much longer than people would like. And eventually people</p>
<p>will be like happy with our approach to this. But at the time, I realized like people want</p>
<p>the shiny toy and it&rsquo;s frustrating. I totally get that.</p>
<p>I saw a visual and I don&rsquo;t know if it was accurate, but it showed GPT-3.5 versus I guess</p>
<p>what GPT-4 is expected.</p>
<p>I saw that thing on Twitter.</p>
<p>Did you? Was that accurate?</p>
<p>Complete bullshit. No.</p>
<p>Okay. Because that was a little bit scary.</p>
<p>The GPT-4 rumor mill is like a ridiculous thing. I don&rsquo;t know where it all comes from.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why people don&rsquo;t have like better things to speculate on. I get a little bit</p>
<p>of it. Like it&rsquo;s sort of fun, but that it&rsquo;s been going for like six months at this volume.</p>
<p>People are begging to be disappointed and they will be like, it&rsquo;s, you know, people</p>
<p>are going to like, the hype is just like, we don&rsquo;t have an actual AGI. And I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of what is expected of us. And, you know, yeah, we&rsquo;re going to disappoint those people.</p>
<p>Right, right. Well, I want to talk to you about how close that is. So, you know, another</p>
<p>thing a few years ago you said, and this was funny, I thought, we were talking about revenue.</p>
<p>This is before you announced your partnership with Microsoft. And you said, and I quote,</p>
<p>basically, we made a soft promise to investors that once we built this generally intelligent</p>
<p>system, we will ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return.</p>
<p>We all kind of laughed at this. And you said, it sounds like an episode of Silicon Valley. I know,</p>
<p>but it is actually what I believe. Someone sent me that video a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I mean, in some sense, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening. Like we built a thing deeply imperfect as it is,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to monetize it. You could talk to it. We put it out into the world</p>
<p>via an API, and other people, by playing around with it, figured out all these things to do.</p>
<p>So it was not quite the like ask thing, and it tells you how to monetize.</p>
<p>But it hasn&rsquo;t been hasn&rsquo;t gone totally the other direction either.</p>
<p>Okay, but we&rsquo;re not quite there yet. You obviously have figured out a way to make some revenue.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re licensing your models.</p>
<p>Not much. We&rsquo;re very early.</p>
<p>Right. But so right now, licensing to startups. So you are early on, and people are sort of looking</p>
<p>at the whole of what&rsquo;s happening out there. And they&rsquo;re saying, you&rsquo;ve got like Google,</p>
<p>which could potentially release things this year. You have a lot of AI upstarts nipping at your</p>
<p>heels. Are you worried about what you&rsquo;re building being commoditized? And I guess, driving the</p>
<p>I mean, to some degree, I hope it is. The future I would like to see is where access to AI is</p>
<p>super democratized, where there are several AGIs in the world that can kind of like help allow for</p>
<p>multiple viewpoints, and not have anyone get too powerful. And that, and that, like, the cost of</p>
<p>intelligence and energy, because it gets commoditized, trends down and down and down,</p>
<p>and the massive surplus their access to the systems, eventually governance of the systems</p>
<p>benefits all of us. So yeah, I sort of hope that happens. I think competition is good.</p>
<p>At least, you know, until we get to AGI, I like deeply believe in capitalism and</p>
<p>competition to offer the best service at the lowest price.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not great from a business standpoint.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be fine. We&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>I also find it interesting that you say, differing viewpoints, or these AGIs would</p>
<p>have different differing viewpoints, I guess how I mean, they&rsquo;re all being trained on like</p>
<p>all the data that&rsquo;s available in the world. So how do we come up with differing viewpoints?</p>
<p>What I think is going to have to happen is society will have to agree and like set some laws</p>
<p>on what an AGI can never do, or what one of these systems should never do.</p>
<p>And one of the cool things about the path of the technology tree that we&rsquo;re on, which is very</p>
<p>different, like before we came along, and it was sort of deep mind having these games that were</p>
<p>like, you know, having agents play each other and try to deceive each other and kill each other and</p>
<p>all that, which I think could have gone in a bad direction. We now have these language models that</p>
<p>can understand language. And so we can say, hey, you know, model, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d like you to do.</p>
<p>Here are the values we&rsquo;d like you to align to. And we don&rsquo;t have it working perfectly yet,</p>
<p>but it works a little and it&rsquo;ll get better and better. And the world can say, all right,</p>
<p>here are the rules. Here&rsquo;s the very broad bounds, very broad, like absolute rules of a system.</p>
<p>But within that, people should be allowed very different things that they want their AI to do.</p>
<p>And so if you want the super, like, you know, never offend, safe for work model,</p>
<p>you should get that. And if you want an edgier one, that, you know, is sort of like creative</p>
<p>and exploratory, but says some stuff you like, might not be comfortable with, or some people</p>
<p>might not be comfortable with, you should get that. And I think there will be many systems</p>
<p>in the world that have different settings of the values that they enforce. And really what I think,</p>
<p>and this will take longer, is that you as a user should be able to write up a few pages of here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I want, here are my values, here&rsquo;s how I want the AI to behave. And it reads it and</p>
<p>thinks about it and acts exactly how you want, because it&rsquo;s like, should be your AI. And,</p>
<p>you know, it should be there to serve you and do the things you believe in.</p>
<p>So that to me is much better than one system where like one tech company says, here are the rules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting. So also, when we sat down, it was right before your partnership with</p>
<p>Microsoft. So when you say we&rsquo;re going to be okay, I wonder if&hellip;</p>
<p>No, nothing about that. We&rsquo;re just going to build a fine business. Like even if the</p>
<p>competitive pressure pushes the price that people will like pay token down, we&rsquo;re going to do fine.</p>
<p>We also have this like cap profit model. So we don&rsquo;t have this incentive to just like</p>
<p>capture all of the infinite dollars out there anyway. And to like generate enough money for</p>
<p>our equity structure, like, yeah, I believe we&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Well, I know you&rsquo;re not crazy about talking about deal making, so we won&rsquo;t. But can you</p>
<p>talk a little bit about your partnership with Microsoft, I guess, how it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re using your tech?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. They&rsquo;re the only tech company out there that I think</p>
<p>we I&rsquo;d be excited to partner with this deeply. I think Satya is an amazing CEO,</p>
<p>but more than that human being and understands. So do Kevin Scott and Mikhail, who we work with</p>
<p>closely as well, like understand the stakes of what AGI means and why we need to have all the</p>
<p>weirdness we do in our structure and our agreement with them. And so I really feel like it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>values aligned company. And there&rsquo;s some things they&rsquo;re very good at, like building very large</p>
<p>supercomputers and the infrastructure we operate on and putting the technology into products.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things we&rsquo;re very good at, like doing research. And it&rsquo;s been a great partnership.</p>
<p>Can you comment on whether the reports are accurate,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be in being an office or maybe it&rsquo;s already in those things?</p>
<p>You are a very experienced and professional reporter.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t comment on that. I know, you know, I can&rsquo;t comment on that. You know,</p>
<p>I know, you know, you can&rsquo;t comment on that. In the spirit of shortness of life</p>
<p>and our precious time here, why do you ask?</p>
<p>Sam.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely curious. Like if you ask a question, you know I&rsquo;m not going to answer.</p>
<p>Well, I thought you might answer that one. No. Okay. I know there&rsquo;s some things you don&rsquo;t answer,</p>
<p>but I got to try.</p>
<p>Another company&rsquo;s product plans I&rsquo;m definitely not going to touch.</p>
<p>Well, okay. Let me ask you about yours then. Do you, is your pact with Microsoft,</p>
<p>does it preclude you from building software and services?</p>
<p>No, no. We build stuff. I mean, we just, as we talked about chat GPT,</p>
<p>we have lots more cool stuff coming.</p>
<p>Okay. And you, and what about other partnerships other than with Microsoft also?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, again, in general, we are very much here to build AGI</p>
<p>and products and services are tactics and service of that partnerships too.</p>
<p>But important ones, and we like, we really want to be useful to people.</p>
<p>And I think if we just build this in a lab and don&rsquo;t figure out how to get out into the world,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s like somehow we&rsquo;re really falling short there.</p>
<p>Well, I wondered what you made of the fact that Google has said</p>
<p>to its employees, we just, it&rsquo;s too imperfect. It could harm our reputation. We&rsquo;re not ready.</p>
<p>I hope, I hope when they launch something anyway, you really hold them to that comment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just leave it there.</p>
<p>Okay. Let me ask you this. What did you think when they suspended that seven-year veteran</p>
<p>of their responsible AI organization who thought that the chat bot that he was working on for them</p>
<p>had become sentient?</p>
<p>You know, I read, I remember reading a little bit about that,</p>
<p>but not enough that I feel like I can comment. Like I basically only remember the headline.</p>
<p>I guess I thought at the time he sounded like a crackpot. And now that I&rsquo;ve seen chat GPT,</p>
<p>I think maybe that&rsquo;s why you rushed out chat GPT because yours is amazing. And if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this also amazing, um, you know, I haven&rsquo;t seen theirs. Um, I would, I think they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>a competent org, so I would assume they have something good, but I, I don&rsquo;t know anything about</p>
<p>it. Um, so we talked earlier on about education. People are scared and excited. I was just telling</p>
<p>you that my 13 year old came home from school a couple of days ago and his teacher was telling</p>
<p>him, um, not to be scared by AI, but you know, you guys are going to have to sort of, um,</p>
<p>develop different skill sets in your lifetime, um, that are valued. So, but there is a lot of</p>
<p>concern. The New York public school system, just restricted access to jet GPT, which is probably,</p>
<p>um, not as big a story as it sort of seemed from the headline, but what do you think about</p>
<p>educators? What are misconceptions about what you&rsquo;re working on? How can you kind of allay</p>
<p>their concerns? Look, I get it. Um, I get why educators feel the way they feel about this.</p>
<p>And, and probably like, this is just a preview of what we&rsquo;re going to see in a lot of other areas.</p>
<p>Um, I think this is just the new, we&rsquo;re going to try to, you know, do some things in the short term.</p>
<p>Um, and there may be ways we can help teachers be like a little bit more likely to detect output or</p>
<p>anyone output of like a GPT like system. But honestly, a determined person is going to get</p>
<p>around them. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be something society can or should rely on longterm. Um, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just in a new world now, like generated text is something we all need to adapt to. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine. Um, we adapted to, you know, calculators and changed what we tested for in math classes.</p>
<p>I imagine, uh, this is a more extreme version of that, no doubt. Um, but also the benefits of it</p>
<p>are more extreme as well. Um, you know, we hear about, we hear from teachers who are understandably</p>
<p>very nervous about the impact of this on homework. We also hear a lot from teachers who are like,</p>
<p>wow, this is like an unbelievable personal tutor for me. Um, and I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Wow. This is like an unbelievable personal tutor for each kid. And I think that I have used it to</p>
<p>learn things myself, uh, and found it like much more compelling than other ways. I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>things in the past. Like I would much rather have chat GPT teach me about something, then go read a</p>
<p>textbook. Uh, so, you know, it&rsquo;s like an evolving world and we&rsquo;ll all adapt and I think be better</p>
<p>off for it. And we won&rsquo;t want to go back. Well, my 15 year old son came home one day and was</p>
<p>using it to understand some science concepts better, which I thought was really great. Yeah.</p>
<p>But the same kid also was like, could I use this to write my papers? So, so I did want to ask about,</p>
<p>um, watermarking technologies and other techniques. So it sounds like you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>no, I think, you know, we will, we will experiment with this. Other people will too.</p>
<p>I think it is important for the transition. Um, but I, I would caution policy,</p>
<p>national policy, individual schools, whatever, from relying on this. Um, because I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>fundamentally, I think it&rsquo;s impossible to make it perfect. You&rsquo;ll think, you know, people will</p>
<p>figure out how much of the text they have to change. There&rsquo;ll be other things that modify</p>
<p>the outputted text. Um, I think it&rsquo;s good to pursue and we will. Um, but I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to realize is like the playing field has shifted and that&rsquo;s fine. Uh, there&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>and bad. And we just figure out like, rather than try to go back, we figure out the way forward.</p>
<p>So even if you develop technologies that could be sort of rendered like irrelevant</p>
<p>in a few months, I suspect. Yeah. Um, I also wanted to ask, uh, anthropic, um, arrival,</p>
<p>I guess, uh, founded by a former, yeah, again, like I arrival in some sense,</p>
<p>I think super highly of those people, uh, like very, very talented and multiple AGI&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>world, I think is better than one. Sure. Uh, well, what I was going to ask,</p>
<p>and just for some background, um, it was founded by a former open AI VP of research who you,</p>
<p>I think met like when he was at Google. Um, but it, um, is stressing, um, an ethical layer</p>
<p>as a kind of distinction from other players. And I just wondered, um, if you think that systems</p>
<p>should adopt, uh, you know, I kind of a common code of principles and, and also whether that</p>
<p>should be regulated. Yeah. I mean, that was my earlier point. I think society should adopt</p>
<p>and should regulate what the kind of the wide bounds are, but then I think individual users</p>
<p>should have a huge amount of Liberty to decide how they want their experience and their interaction</p>
<p>to go. So I think it is like a combination of society, you know, like we have, there are a few</p>
<p>asterisks on the free speech rules. Um, and society has decided like free speech, not quite absolute.</p>
<p>I think society will decide also decide like language models, not quite absolute, but there</p>
<p>are a lot of, there&rsquo;s a lot of speech that is legal that you find distasteful that I find</p>
<p>distasteful that he finds distasteful. And we all probably have somewhat different definitions of</p>
<p>that. And I think it is very important that that is left to the responsibility of individual users</p>
<p>and groups, not, not one company and that the government they&rsquo;re like govern and not dictate</p>
<p>all of the rules. Um, and there are a lot of people here who I think want to ask you questions</p>
<p>and I know you can&rsquo;t stay forever. I wanted to ask one more question before I turn it over to the</p>
<p>crowd. Um, video, is that coming? It will come. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to make a confident prediction</p>
<p>about when, um, obviously like people are interested in it. Uh, we&rsquo;ll try to do it.</p>
<p>Other people will try to do it. Um, it could be like pretty soon it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a legitimate</p>
<p>research project, so it could be pretty soon. It could take a while. Okay. Uh, let&rsquo;s see,</p>
<p>who would like to ask Sam a question? Oh, great. Hold on. I got to run over here.</p>
<p>Thank you. Hi fusion. When do you think there will be a commercial plant actually producing</p>
<p>electricity economically? Yeah, I think, I think by like 2028 pending, you know,</p>
<p>good fortune with regulators, we could be plugging them into the grid.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll do it, uh, you know, a really great demo well before that, like hopefully pretty soon.</p>
<p>Hey Sam, thank you. Um, what is your, and I don&rsquo;t know if you are allowed to answer this,</p>
<p>but what is your like best case scenario for AI and worst case, or more pointedly,</p>
<p>what would you like to see and what would you not like to see out of AI in the future?</p>
<p>I mean, I, I think the best case is like so unbelievably good that it&rsquo;s like hard to,</p>
<p>I, I think it&rsquo;s like hard for me to even imagine, like, I can sort of, I can sort of think about</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like when we make more progress of discovering new, new knowledge with these systems</p>
<p>than humanity has done so far, but like in a year instead of 70,000, um, I can sort of imagine what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when we kind of like launch probes out to the whole universe and find out really, you</p>
<p>know, everything going on out there. I can sort of imagine what it&rsquo;s like when we have, you know,</p>
<p>help us resolve deadlocks and improve all aspects of reality and, uh, kind of like, let us all live</p>
<p>our best lives. But I can&rsquo;t quite like, I think the, the, the good case is just so unbelievably</p>
<p>good that you sound like a really crazy person to start talking about it. Um, and the bad case,</p>
<p>and I think this is like important to say is like lights out, right? And, and, and, and, and, and,</p>
<p>and the bad case, and I think this is like important to say is like lights out for all of us.</p>
<p>Um, I&rsquo;m more worried about like an accidental misuse case in the short term where, you know,</p>
<p>someone gets a super powerful, like, it&rsquo;s not like the AI wakes up and decides to be evil.</p>
<p>And I think all of the sort of traditional AI safety thinkers reveal a lot about more about</p>
<p>themselves than they mean to when they talk about what they think the AGI is going to be like,</p>
<p>but, but I can see the accidental misuse case clearly. And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s super bad. Um,</p>
<p>so I think like, uh, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s like impossible to overstate the importance of AI</p>
<p>safety and alignment work. Um, I would like to see much, much more happening, but I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more subtle than most people think. And that, you know, you hear a lot of people talk about</p>
<p>AI capabilities and AI alignment as like orthogonal vectors. And, you know, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bad if you&rsquo;re a capabilities researcher and you&rsquo;re, but if you&rsquo;re an alignment researcher,</p>
<p>it actually sounds very reasonable. Um, but they&rsquo;re almost the same thing. Like</p>
<p>deep learning is just going to like solve all of these problems. And so far that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>progress has been. And progress on capabilities is also what has let us make the systems safer</p>
<p>and vice versa, surprisingly. Um, and so I think, and none of this sort of sound bite,</p>
<p>easy answers work. Alfred Lynn told me to ask you, and I was going to ask anyway,</p>
<p>how far away do you think AGI is? He said, Sam, I&rsquo;ll probably tell you sooner than you thought.</p>
<p>The closer we get, the harder time I have answering, because I think that it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be much blurrier, uh, and much more of a gradual transition than, than people think.</p>
<p>If you, if you imagine like a two by two matrix of sort of short timelines until the AGI takeoff</p>
<p>era begins and long timelines until it begins, and then a slow takeoff or a fast takeoff,</p>
<p>the world I think we&rsquo;re heading to and the safest world, the one I most hope for</p>
<p>is the short timeline, slow takeoff. But I think people are going to have hugely different</p>
<p>opinions about when in there you kind of like declare victory on the AGI thing.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sam. Um, 30 seconds versus when you spoke a few years ago, I was highly skeptical.</p>
<p>Um, and so you&rsquo;ve put me on notice, felt like Netscape when I was a teenager,</p>
<p>check, uh, GPT. Thank you very much. The question I have is less science and technology and more</p>
<p>geography, which is what&rsquo;s your take on San Francisco and Southern Valley? Cause you referenced</p>
<p>it earlier in like, man, I love this city so much. Um, and it is so sad what like the current state</p>
<p>is. I do think it&rsquo;s like somewhat come back to life after the pandemic, but yeah, like when you</p>
<p>walk down market street at night, or like if I try to walk home and walk through the Tenderloin</p>
<p>like late, it&rsquo;s not great. And I think it&rsquo;s like a real shame, uh, that we put up with treating</p>
<p>people like this. And we continue to elect leaders who sort of don&rsquo;t think this is okay, but also</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fix the problem. Um, I totally get how hard this is. I totally get how complicated this is.</p>
<p>I also, I think, unlike other tech people will say that tech has some responsibility for it. Um,</p>
<p>but other cities managed to do better than this. Like it is a solvable problem and to entirely</p>
<p>blame tech companies who don&rsquo;t get to run the city, uh, that doesn&rsquo;t feel good either. Uh,</p>
<p>and I wish there could be a more collaborative partnership instead of all of the finger</p>
<p>pointing. Um, I am super long in-person work. I am super long, the Bay area. I&rsquo;m super long,</p>
<p>California. I think we are probably going through some trying times. Um, but I am hopeful we like</p>
<p>come out of the fire better for it. Can you talk a little bit more about, um, what you expected the</p>
<p>reaction to chat GPT to, to be, and also would you prefer that there wasn&rsquo;t so much hype? Like,</p>
<p>is that potentially detrimental to the company? Yeah. Um, I would have expected maybe like one</p>
<p>order of magnitude, less of everything, like one order of magnitude, less of, um, hype,</p>
<p>one order of magnitude, less of users. Um, yeah, I would have expected sort of one order of</p>
<p>magnitude, less on everything. Um, and I think less hype is probably better just as like a general</p>
<p>rule that one of the sort of strange things about these technologies is they are impressive, but not</p>
<p>robust. And so you use them in a first demo, you kind of have this like very impressive, like,</p>
<p>wow, this is like incredible and ready to go. Um, you use them a hundred times, you see the</p>
<p>weaknesses. And so I think people can get a much sort of a false impression of how good they are.</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s all going to get better. The critics who point these problems out and say,</p>
<p>well, this is why it&rsquo;s like, you know, all like, like, you know, fake news or whatever</p>
<p>are equally wrong. And so I think it&rsquo;s good in the sense that people are updating to this,</p>
<p>thinking hard about it and all of that. Can I ask, how do you use it? You know,</p>
<p>when we were emailing back and forth, I thought, am I talking to Sam? Um,</p>
<p>I have occasionally used it to summarize super long emails, but I&rsquo;ve never used it to write one.</p>
<p>Um, I actually summarized something. I use it for a lot. It&rsquo;s super good at that.</p>
<p>I use it for translation. I use it to like learn things.</p>
<p>So two quick questions. When people talk about, um, your technologies being the end of Google,</p>
<p>how do you unpack or how do you understand that? And then also your thoughts on UBI.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think whenever someone like talks about a technology being the end of some other giant</p>
<p>companies, it&rsquo;s usually wrong. Like I think people forget they get, they get to make a counter move</p>
<p>here and they&rsquo;re like pretty smart, pretty competent, but I do think it means there is</p>
<p>a change for search that will probably come at some point, but not as dramatically as people</p>
<p>think in the short term would like, my guess is that people are going to be using Google</p>
<p>the same way people are using Google now for quite some time. And also Google for whatever</p>
<p>this whole like code red thing is, it&rsquo;s probably not going to change that dramatic would be my</p>
<p>guess. Um, UBI, I think UBI is good and important, but, uh, very far from sufficient. I think it is</p>
<p>like a little part of the solution. Uh, I think it&rsquo;s great. Like, I think we should, as AGI</p>
<p>participates more and more in the economy, I think we should distribute wealth and resources much</p>
<p>more than we have. Um, and that&rsquo;ll be important over time, but I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to like solve the problem. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to give people meaning. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it means people are going to like entirely stop trying to create and do new things and</p>
<p>whatever else. So I sort of would consider it like an enabling technology, but not like a plan</p>
<p>for society. Is that why your company though, as a capped profit company, I mean, are you planning</p>
<p>to take the proceeds that presumably you&rsquo;re presuming you&rsquo;re going to make someday and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to give them back to society? I mean, is that whether we do that just by like</p>
<p>saying here&rsquo;s cash for everyone, totally possible. Or whether we do that by saying like here is,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re going to like invest all of this in a nonprofit that does a bunch of science</p>
<p>because scientific progress is how we all make progress. I&rsquo;m unsure, but yeah, we would like</p>
<p>to operate for, for the good of society. And I think I&rsquo;m like a big believer in sort of design</p>
<p>a custom structure for whatever you&rsquo;re trying to do. And I think AGI is just like really different.</p>
<p>And so the cap will turn out to be super important. Can I ask selfishly? So if UBI is only</p>
<p>part of the solution and I&rsquo;ve got teenagers and we all have jobs, what should we be preparing for?</p>
<p>You know, as I said, my, my son&rsquo;s teacher was trying to prepare them, but of course you would</p>
<p>maybe be better positioned to have some ideas on this. Resilience, adaptability, ability to like</p>
<p>learn new things quickly, creativity, although it&rsquo;ll be aided creativity and aided learning</p>
<p>things quickly. I mean, I feel like my, for sure, like in some sense before Google came along,</p>
<p>there was like a bunch of things that we learned, like memorizing facts was really important.</p>
<p>And that changed. And now I think learning will change again and we&rsquo;ll probably adapt</p>
<p>faster than we think. Yeah. So, um, okay. I think we have to let Sam go, but how about like</p>
<p>two more questions. Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh, the future workplace for, um,</p>
<p>tech workers, you think it&rsquo;ll be out of the home, out of the office? What percent in each?</p>
<p>I have like, I look, I think people are going to do different things. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be one answer. And I think people will sort the people who want fully in person. We&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>People want fully remote. We&rsquo;ll do that. I think a lot of people will do like hybrid.</p>
<p>I have always been a fan of going to the office a few days a week and work at home a day or two a</p>
<p>week. Um, YC was like very much like being a YC partner was very much that way. Opening. I was</p>
<p>that way before the pandemic opening eyes that way. Now, I personally, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I personally am skeptical that fully remote is going to be the thing that everyone does.</p>
<p>And I think even the people who thought it was a really good idea are now sort of saying like,</p>
<p>Hmm, the next, like 40 years sitting in my bedroom, looking at a computer screen on zoom,</p>
<p>do I really want that? Am I really sure with some skepticism, there are some people who do</p>
<p>what I think has been the hardest is companies who are the wrong kind of hybrid where it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>you know, these four days, everyone&rsquo;s in these two days, everyone&rsquo;s home, whatever, but it&rsquo;s, uh,</p>
<p>come in if you want, be at home if you want. And then you have like half the people in the</p>
<p>meeting, this little box on the screen, have people in person. It&rsquo;s clearly a way better</p>
<p>experience in person. The people that are not there, like do get sort of like left out that,</p>
<p>that I think is the hardest, but it&rsquo;s all gonna like continue to evolve and people will sort into</p>
<p>what they want. I would bet that many of the most important companies of this decade are still</p>
<p>pretty heavily in person. Do you work for CBRE? No. Maybe that. So, um, one of you guys want to</p>
<p>wrestle for it. He has a white t-shirt. So let&rsquo;s do him too. Great, great, great, great. Sure.</p>
<p>So given your experience with the open AI safety and the conversation around it,</p>
<p>how do you think about safety and other AI fields like autonomous vehicles?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s like a bunch of safety issues for</p>
<p>any new technology and particularly any narrow vertical of AI.</p>
<p>And we kind of have learned a lot in the past few decades of, or more than a few past like</p>
<p>seven or eight decades of technological progress about how to do really good safety engineering</p>
<p>and safety systems management. And a lot of that about how we like learn how to build safe systems</p>
<p>and safe processes will translate imperfect. There&rsquo;ll be mistakes, but we know how to do that.</p>
<p>I think the AGI safety stuff is really different personally and worthy of study as its own</p>
<p>category. And they&rsquo;re there because the stakes are so high and the, and the irreversible situations</p>
<p>are so easy to imagine. We do need to somehow treat that differently and figure out a new set</p>
<p>of safety processes and standards. So you said like right now is one of the</p>
<p>best times to start a company. I found that counterintuitive. Maybe you can explain why</p>
<p>and what companies should I tell my friends to go start? Cause I have actually pretty few</p>
<p>smart friends who are looking to do something. The only thing that I think is like easy in</p>
<p>a mega bubble is capital. So it was a great time to raise capital for a startup from say 2015 to</p>
<p>20, when did that go wrong? End of 2021, but everything else was pretty hard. It was like</p>
<p>pretty hard to hire people. It was like pretty hard to like rise above the noise. It was pretty</p>
<p>hard to do something that mattered without having like thousands of competitors right away.</p>
<p>And a lot of those startups that looked like they were doing well, because of the same reason</p>
<p>capital was cheap, found that actually they were not able to like build as much enduring value as</p>
<p>they hoped. Now raising capital is like tough. It&rsquo;s still sort of reasonable, I think at like</p>
<p>seed stages, but it certainly seems much tougher at later stages. But all the other stuff is much</p>
<p>easier. You actually can concentrate talent. People are not constantly poached. You can rise</p>
<p>above the noise threshold, whether that&rsquo;s with like customers, the press, you know, users,</p>
<p>whatever. I would much rather be, have a hard time raising capital, but an easier time doing</p>
<p>everything else than the other way around. So that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s a better time.</p>
<p>In terms of like what I would do now, I would probably like go do AI for some vertical.</p>
<p>Well, it brought to mind this information story about Jasper that I thought was interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a customer of yours, a copywriting company relying on your, you know, AI language models.</p>
<p>And now ChatGPT is so good that it&rsquo;s got to kind of like find a new reason for being, I think.</p>
<p>Is that a danger for many startups? I guess, which ones if so?</p>
<p>I heard about this article, but I didn&rsquo;t read it. But if I understand that it was basically like</p>
<p>the company was saying like, you know, we had built this thing on GPT-3 and now ChatGPT is</p>
<p>available for free and that&rsquo;s causing us problems. Is that right? I think probably the wrong thing to</p>
<p>do in, to make an AI startup. Well, let me say, I think the best thing you can do to make an AI</p>
<p>startup is the same way that like a lot of other companies differentiate, which is to build like</p>
<p>deep relationships with customers, a product they love, and some sort of moat that doesn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>be technology and network effect or whatever. And I think a lot of companies in the AI space</p>
<p>are doing exactly that. And you&rsquo;ve got to plan that open AI&rsquo;s models are going to get better</p>
<p>and better. We view ourselves more as a platform company, but we will do some, you know, like a</p>
<p>business strategy I&rsquo;ve always really respected is like the platform plus killer app together.</p>
<p>And so we will probably do something to help show people what we think is possible. But I think you</p>
<p>want to build a startup. And I think Jasper is going to do this or already is doing this that</p>
<p>has like deep value on top of the fundamental language model. And we are a piece of enabling</p>
<p>technology. Is there anybody knowing what you know, or you think you see coming that should</p>
<p>like basically drop what they&rsquo;re doing right now because they&rsquo;re cooked?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m sure if I had more time to think about it, I could come up with an answer. But</p>
<p>in general, I think there&rsquo;s going to be way, way more new value created. Like this is going to be</p>
<p>a golden few years, then people who are should just like stop what they&rsquo;re doing. I would not</p>
<p>ignore it. I think you got to like embrace it big time. But I think the amount of value that&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>to get created, we have not seen like, since the launch of the iPhone app store, something like</p>
<p>that. It&rsquo;s incredible. This is going to be an amazing year. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m so thankful. Thank</p>
<p>you for having me. My gosh, Sam. Thank you. For sure.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Thanks for listening, everybody. And special thanks to sustain.life. Make sure to</p>
<p>check out their site at sustain.life slash StrictlyVC. Have a great weekend. And we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see you back here next week.</p>
