    <p>Our card this week is Viola Pendergrass, a wild card from North Carolina.</p>
<p>I felt compelled to tell you Viola&rsquo;s story even though she&rsquo;s not featured on a cold</p>
<p>case deck because she was the matriarch of not just her sprawling family, but also those</p>
<p>at the apartment complex where she&rsquo;d lived for two decades.</p>
<p>Residents there even called her Ma.</p>
<p>That is, until one winter morning in 1992 when someone came into her home and viciously</p>
<p>attacked her, shocking a community and dividing a close-knit family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On February 7th, 1992, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Iris Howard called her grandmother</p>
<p>Viola to make sure that she could still watch her four-year-old son that day while she went</p>
<p>to work.</p>
<p>Viola said yes, and Iris was like, great, I&rsquo;ll see you in an hour.</p>
<p>Around 730, Iris loaded her toddler son into her car and headed towards Viola&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>a few minutes away.</p>
<p>But when Iris got there, the door to Viola&rsquo;s second-story apartment was locked.</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t make a ton of sense to Iris, because obviously Viola was expecting her,</p>
<p>and she typically just let herself in.</p>
<p>I mean, this was part of their routine.</p>
<p>She watched him all the time, and the door would always be open for her to come in.</p>
<p>So Iris knocked and called out for Viola, but as she listened for footsteps coming toward</p>
<p>the door, there was just silence.</p>
<p>Iris started to worry.</p>
<p>Not only was she going to be late for work, but she was concerned about her grandmother.</p>
<p>Iris tracked down a spare key from a neighbor that she knew and let herself in.</p>
<p>Once inside the apartment, Iris immediately checked the bedroom, and there, slumped upright</p>
<p>in a chair across from the bed and wearing a blood-soaked robe, was Viola.</p>
<p>Iris raced out of the bedroom and ran back to the neighbor who&rsquo;d given her the key,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where she called 911.</p>
<p>Officers with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department met Iris outside the complex within</p>
<p>minutes, and she cried and screamed as she pleaded with them to save her grandmother.</p>
<p>But when they went into the apartment and entered the bedroom, first responders knew</p>
<p>there was nothing that could be done.</p>
<p>Viola was already dead.</p>
<p>With a bloody kitchen knife at the elderly woman&rsquo;s feet, it wasn&rsquo;t difficult for investigators</p>
<p>to deduce how she was killed.</p>
<p>They counted at least 16 stab wounds across her chest and stomach.</p>
<p>Back then, Detective Ed Williams was relatively new to the force, but something that stuck</p>
<p>out to him and the other officers was the way Viola&rsquo;s body was positioned and what</p>
<p>it potentially told them about her killer.</p>
<p>She was found in her bedroom in a chair right next to the bed, sitting in her chair.</p>
<p>So it appears that she may have been even having a conversation with this person.</p>
<p>My assumption, I don&rsquo;t know, but my assumption was that she was just sitting on a chair next</p>
<p>to her bed.</p>
<p>Whoever did this was sitting on the bed having a conversation with her, and then it went south.</p>
<p>Apparent defensive cuts and scratches on her arms that were noted in her autopsy told police</p>
<p>that whatever happened, Viola didn&rsquo;t even have time to stand herself upright from where</p>
<p>she was seated in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Investigators combed through the rest of the apartment looking for more clues that</p>
<p>could lead them to Viola&rsquo;s attacker.</p>
<p>But aside from the bedroom where Viola was killed, there wasn&rsquo;t anything obviously</p>
<p>out of place throughout the rest of the home.</p>
<p>The apartment was undisturbed as far as investigators could tell, and nothing really gave them the</p>
<p>impression that it had been rummaged through.</p>
<p>But then they spotted one clue left behind in the bedroom.</p>
<p>The bedside phone in Viola&rsquo;s room was off the hook and dangled to the floor.</p>
<p>There was also blood smeared across the receiver and the phone itself.</p>
<p>To police, that meant one of two things.</p>
<p>Either whoever attacked Viola clearly went out of their way to make it as hard as possible</p>
<p>for her to call for help, or Viola herself had reached for the phone trying to call for</p>
<p>help after she was stabbed.</p>
<p>As law enforcement and crime scene technicians continued their work in the apartment, framed</p>
<p>photos of Viola and her larger-than-life family surrounded police as they worked to collect</p>
<p>possible evidence.</p>
<p>Iris was the first person to talk with Charlotte-Mecklenburg police since she was the one who found Viola</p>
<p>and she was the one who called 911.</p>
<p>She was quickly cleared of any involvement in her grandmother&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Not only had she been back at her own apartment getting ready for the day before driving over</p>
<p>to drop off her kid, which phone records confirmed, but there was also the neighbor who said Iris</p>
<p>did in fact borrow a key just to get into Viola&rsquo;s apartment, and she quickly came</p>
<p>running back to call for help.</p>
<p>When the police got there, she was hysterical.</p>
<p>You can kind of tell when someone, I mean, we&rsquo;re all human beings, we all have been</p>
<p>since our infancy, I think we can, you could say we&rsquo;re all students of human behavior.</p>
<p>I think for the most part, people can kind of tell when someone is genuine and when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not genuine.</p>
<p>This was genuine.</p>
<p>The neighbor who loaned Iris the spare key was a friend of Viola&rsquo;s, someone she trusted.</p>
<p>And that much was clear considering Iris went straight there for a key when she couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get inside the apartment.</p>
<p>So investigators spoke with this neighbor too, and they were able to rule her out as</p>
<p>a suspect pretty much right away as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those working the case today were not able to share the ins and outs of</p>
<p>why with us, but they did give our reporter an answer to something that I was wondering</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>They said that the knob on the inside of Viola&rsquo;s front door did not require a key to be able</p>
<p>to lock it.</p>
<p>Like, you could twist the lock and then shut the door.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like whoever killed her would have had to be someone with a key.</p>
<p>Even though this neighbor couldn&rsquo;t give them anything helpful other than confirming</p>
<p>Iris&rsquo;s story, the detectives were eager to talk to other people who might have been</p>
<p>around and may have seen someone coming or going from Viola&rsquo;s place that morning.</p>
<p>Little Rock Apartments, which is still there today, is on the west side of Charlotte.</p>
<p>And back in the early 90s, it was made up of working class families.</p>
<p>And it was facing increased challenges with a rising crime rate.</p>
<p>But Viola was a fixture there.</p>
<p>Some neighbors told police that Viola had been through a lot of hardship in her life.</p>
<p>As a young adult in South Carolina, she picked cotton on a farm along with her eventual husband,</p>
<p>who died in a car crash in 1953.</p>
<p>Now Viola was retired and loved to help take care of her grandkids, of which she had plenty</p>
<p>because Viola herself had 11 children, five sons and six daughters.</p>
<p>After her husband died, Viola raised her kids largely on her own.</p>
<p>And now she was helping raise her grandchildren.</p>
<p>Because to Viola, family meant everything.</p>
<p>And her neighbors were treated like family too.</p>
<p>Viola wasn&rsquo;t just the elderly woman who lived upstairs and kept to herself.</p>
<p>She knew everyone and everyone knew her.</p>
<p>The headline to an article in the Charlotte Observer the day after her murder, February</p>
<p>8th, read,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neighborhood&rsquo;s Ambassador Fatally Stabbed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man named William McRae, who was identified in the article as Viola&rsquo;s nephew by marriage,</p>
<p>was quoted saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She was the type of person, if you were hungry, she would feed you.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t even have to know your name.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way she was.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so loved that most people around her apartment complex called her Ma.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Williams again.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s always one or two or three people that are the go-to people in</p>
<p>the neighborhood where people hang out, people really enjoy seeing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have a lot of kids and a lot of adults that just hang out at these</p>
<p>different apartments or houses in neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Well, her apartment was one of these apartments.</p>
<p>She was the grandmother of the apartment complex, per se.</p>
<p>Despite her close ties and popularity in the community, canvassing the apartment complex</p>
<p>turned up nothing.</p>
<p>But police still had the daunting task before them of notifying and speaking with Viola&rsquo;s</p>
<p>family.</p>
<p>And those conversations led police to one crucial detail.</p>
<p>When police spoke with Viola&rsquo;s extended family, one detail stood out as a common theme in</p>
<p>interviews.</p>
<p>Viola&rsquo;s social security checks.</p>
<p>Viola, who was 79 years old at the time of her murder, depended on those checks to support</p>
<p>herself.</p>
<p>Each month, she&rsquo;d receive $700, which is about $1,400 today when adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>Her family members told police that whenever Viola received her checks, she would cash</p>
<p>them, but she usually kept the money out of a bank.</p>
<p>For safekeeping, I mean, at least that was the intent behind it, she sometimes enlisted</p>
<p>nearby relatives to hold on to the cash for her, and then whenever she needed it, they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>bring it over.</p>
<p>This was in large part how Viola managed her savings, and apparently for good reason.</p>
<p>When our team was in North Carolina reporting for this episode, a family member disclosed</p>
<p>to us that lump sums of Viola&rsquo;s cashed social security checks had actually been taken from</p>
<p>her apartment at least three times before.</p>
<p>The most recent time someone allegedly stole from Viola was as little as four months before</p>
<p>she was murdered, and for the very last check she received, Viola made the decision to hold</p>
<p>on to the cash herself.</p>
<p>Those closest to her would know that she kept the $700 in the same place she always did,</p>
<p>on top of her bedroom dresser.</p>
<p>So if no family members were holding on to that money for her after she cashed that last</p>
<p>check, the money should have been in that same spot as it always was.</p>
<p>Except when police processed the crime scene, no cash was found on the dresser, which was</p>
<p>right next to Viola.</p>
<p>And just so you guys can visualize it a little bit, based on where Viola&rsquo;s body was found,</p>
<p>police thought that it was likely that her killer attacked as she was seated in that</p>
<p>same chair.</p>
<p>And if that were the case, with Viola immobilized, there was nothing standing between the assailant</p>
<p>and the money.</p>
<p>In fact, it would have been pretty easy for whomever murdered Viola to swipe the cash</p>
<p>from the top of the dresser and then just bail.</p>
<p>And that seems likely because police did not find that cash anywhere in the apartment.</p>
<p>It appears that that is probably the motive, because there is no indication that Ms. Pendergrass</p>
<p>ever did anything to anyone that would cause them to kill her.</p>
<p>The only motive we see, and when I say we, we from the police department, the investigative</p>
<p>standpoint, is that $700 is missing.</p>
<p>So it appears that this was a robbery.</p>
<p>As police continued interviewing her relatives, it was clear that faith and family were two</p>
<p>central pillars in Viola&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And she held especially close to both after her husband died in a car crash 40 years earlier.</p>
<p>Her loved ones told officers that Viola never remarried and spent her working years as a</p>
<p>cook in restaurants to support her kids, who at the time of her death were mostly located</p>
<p>in her native South Carolina, but were also spread out across New Jersey and North Carolina.</p>
<p>As of February 1992, she also had 27 grandchildren and 46 great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>With Viola&rsquo;s sprawling family, it took several days for the news of their matriarch&rsquo;s shocking</p>
<p>death to trickle down.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t until three days after her death on February 10th, when one of Viola&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grandsons, then 19-year-old Christopher Pendergrass, got word that he needed to call his mother</p>
<p>immediately.</p>
<p>Christopher was in the U.S. Navy at the time and was stationed off the coast of San Diego.</p>
<p>When he got a hold of his mom, she told him that his grandmother was killed.</p>
<p>He was spared the details over the phone, but the following day, Christopher was on</p>
<p>the next flight back to North Carolina.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t even made it out of the Charlotte airport when he insisted on knowing exactly</p>
<p>how his grandmother was taken from them.</p>
<p>And he cried into his mother&rsquo;s arms when she finally told him.</p>
<p>I mean, the news was almost too unbearable for him to process.</p>
<p>Even 2,000-some miles apart, with him being stationed in California, he and Viola made</p>
<p>time for one another whenever possible, and the two would talk on the phone every other</p>
<p>day before he shipped out.</p>
<p>I mean, this was someone who helped raise him, someone who was a vivid part of his earliest</p>
<p>memories.</p>
<p>Brought on some sadness and depression.</p>
<p>You know, up until I was in kindergarten, I spent almost every day of my life with my</p>
<p>grandmother.</p>
<p>I was with her almost every, every day.</p>
<p>So I was the baby grandson for a long time.</p>
<p>I guess the term, they say, well, he was spoiled, and with me, I was just that close and had</p>
<p>that much love for her and respect.</p>
<p>Christopher said that the last time he talked to Viola was on February 5th, just two days</p>
<p>before she was killed.</p>
<p>She was in good spirits and seemed to be strong and healthy, you know, just judging her, being</p>
<p>able to hold a conversation and have good memory to recollect anything that she was</p>
<p>discussing.</p>
<p>She talked about the crime that had gone up around in Charlotte and even around in her</p>
<p>immediate area.</p>
<p>On top of that, Viola witnessed an altercation between two men at the apartment complex,</p>
<p>and things escalated to the point where one of the men pulled a gun on the other.</p>
<p>Viola intervened, placed a hand on the shoulder of the man with the gun, and said something</p>
<p>to the effect of,</p>
<p>Mr. Please don&rsquo;t shoot that man.</p>
<p>After defusing what sounded like an incredibly dangerous situation, she walked away unharmed.</p>
<p>But before her death, Viola assured Christopher and other nervous family members that she</p>
<p>had no reason to be afraid in her own community.</p>
<p>Despite the area becoming increasingly crime-challenged, Christopher said there&rsquo;s no way his grandma</p>
<p>would have ever welcomed a complete stranger into her home, because she&rsquo;d made those</p>
<p>recent comments about the crime rate in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>That meant, whoever this person was, she trusted them enough to apparently have a sit-down</p>
<p>conversation in the comfort of her bedroom, dressed in her nightgown.</p>
<p>Well, with that, and the way her apartment was set up, she had to have let them in, because</p>
<p>if it was somebody that would have attacked her from the front door and gotten her all</p>
<p>the way back into her bedroom where she was found, it would have put up a bigger fight.</p>
<p>You know, it would have been more things like turned over, or what have you, as far as the</p>
<p>crime scene goes.</p>
<p>So whoever it was, she trusted them enough to get that far back into her home, into her</p>
<p>bedroom, because she was, you know, sitting in a chair.</p>
<p>So for them to get that far in her house, she definitely trusted them.</p>
<p>As weeks turned into months without any answers, some of Viola&rsquo;s family members started to</p>
<p>suspect each other.</p>
<p>And that suspicion bred resentment in the family after her murder, and it made people</p>
<p>like Christopher wonder who in his family he could even trust.</p>
<p>Police never did a press conference or anything announcing a theory about who killed Viola,</p>
<p>but they were having conversations with some of Viola&rsquo;s relatives about who had a habit</p>
<p>of stealing or borrowing Viola&rsquo;s cash, and who in the family knew about her social</p>
<p>security checks.</p>
<p>When months went by with no new tips or leads, police started to lean further into the theory</p>
<p>that one of Viola&rsquo;s own family members killed her.</p>
<p>Because again, few if any people outside of the Pendergrass family knew when she would</p>
<p>deposit her social security check and where she would keep the cash.</p>
<p>But to prove it, police needed more.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t build a case on suspicion alone.</p>
<p>They needed evidence, which, to put it mildly, was sorely lacking.</p>
<p>Aside from their shoe-leather police work in the field, police tried in more ways than</p>
<p>one to engage with the community to solve Viola&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>In 2003, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department empaneled a civilian review board</p>
<p>meant to add fresh eyes and perspective to some of the agency&rsquo;s coldest cases, including</p>
<p>Viola&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>According to a news story published in the Charlotte Observer in July 2006, the team,</p>
<p>which to this day is made up of volunteers who have law enforcement backgrounds, would</p>
<p>re-evaluate evidence, re-evaluate interviews, reports, and prepare summaries of their findings</p>
<p>for sworn law enforcement.</p>
<p>And honestly, they had a pretty solid track record.</p>
<p>According to that same article, the work of the civilian review board as of July 2006</p>
<p>led to at least 15 arrests, leading to the closure of 17 cases.</p>
<p>But Viola&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t one of them.</p>
<p>Then in 2006, this is 14 years after Viola&rsquo;s murder, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department</p>
<p>created a special webpage that featured information about seven unsolved homicides.</p>
<p>Now I know a simple website may sound like a no-brainer for most of us today, but this</p>
<p>was 2006 and kind of on the heels of the internet boom.</p>
<p>But as far as we know, that website didn&rsquo;t actually result in any definitive leads.</p>
<p>Part of someone coming forward with information, the best bet at solving Viola&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>police said, rests with figuring out whose DNA was on the physical evidence collected</p>
<p>from the scene.</p>
<p>Again, the most promising pieces of evidence was that blood that was found on the phone</p>
<p>in the bedroom and the bloodied knife found near Viola&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>But the test results from the blood smear found on Viola&rsquo;s phone were very interesting.</p>
<p>According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, those results showed a mixture</p>
<p>of Viola&rsquo;s blood and a second unknown person.</p>
<p>At least five DNA samples were collected from relatives to compare against the blood smear,</p>
<p>but Detective Williams told us none of them were a positive match.</p>
<p>And you might be scratching your head over this because I was.</p>
<p>If they were able to extract a foreign profile from the phone, why couldn&rsquo;t they immediately</p>
<p>tell whether or not that second person was a relative of Viola&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I mean, that would at least confirm or debunk the family member theory.</p>
<p>But after calling up a couple of DNA experts, we found that it&rsquo;s not so simple.</p>
<p>Things get very complicated beyond just trying to prove a genetic match to someone&rsquo;s parent,</p>
<p>child, or full siblings.</p>
<p>Like, pretty much, like, you have to be that close in order for it to be a hit right away.</p>
<p>So CPD had to outsource the non-Viola profile for forensic genetic genealogy testing.</p>
<p>And as of this recording, they&rsquo;re still waiting to find out if that person is in fact</p>
<p>related to her.</p>
<p>In 2018, detectives decided to try something that they never thought to try before, thanks</p>
<p>to advances in forensic DNA testing.</p>
<p>They sent the knife back to the lab and had analysts take the knife apart and test it</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>This was done in the event that blood, or any other physical kind of DNA, managed to</p>
<p>seep into the inside crevices of the knife, like between the handle and the metal.</p>
<p>Analysts use what&rsquo;s called MVAC testing, which I&rsquo;ve talked about in some other episodes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically when DNA lab techs use this vacuum-like device to suck out hard-to-access</p>
<p>trace evidence that they can then test.</p>
<p>But just quick sidebar, because I know that you&rsquo;re all DNA nerds like me, the MVAC apparatus</p>
<p>is usually used on fabric or cloth evidence, but in this case, they used it on the handle</p>
<p>of the knife after splitting it open to make a flat surface.</p>
<p>And using that method, they were able to retrieve some blood and they compared it against</p>
<p>the blood that was found on Viola&rsquo;s phone, but there wasn&rsquo;t enough to get a match.</p>
<p>Now, around that same time, police also sent Viola&rsquo;s blood-stained robe to be analyzed</p>
<p>in order to determine whether there was DNA profiles present on that that weren&rsquo;t Viola&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But that testing was also inconclusive.</p>
<p>After all of these years, Detective Williams can&rsquo;t help but feel frustrated over Viola&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>She was a caring person, and it makes me sad that this happened, but it makes me sad that</p>
<p>I never had the opportunity to meet her, because it sounds like somebody I would have liked</p>
<p>very, very much.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get all emotional, but that just tears my heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting that this happened, and I don&rsquo;t get like that with many cases.</p>
<p>But this one, I don&rsquo;t know, something about this case has just touched me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this for 36 years now, and I&rsquo;ve only had a few cases like this where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone home and thought about it, I&rsquo;ve woken up in the middle of the night thinking</p>
<p>about it, I wake up in the morning thinking about it, thinking, what did I miss?</p>
<p>The family was, and remains, basically divided into two camps.</p>
<p>One side insists that the killer was among them, and that nobody outside of the family</p>
<p>knew when Viola cashed her checks, and more crucially, where she kept the actual money.</p>
<p>And then you have the other side, which grew defensive and resented Christopher and investigators</p>
<p>for even suggesting the possibility.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s a suspect to me, until we get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>It could have possibly been anyone in the immediate vicinity between the neighbors and</p>
<p>family, because somebody knows exactly what happened.</p>
<p>So like I said, I&rsquo;m hoping that the police department can make the arrests they need</p>
<p>to in this investigation.</p>
<p>As they&rsquo;ve continued to investigate, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police have had their eyes on a relative</p>
<p>of Viola&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s battled substance use disorder and had a history of allegedly stealing</p>
<p>from family to support his addiction.</p>
<p>Police have remained interested in him, and he has agreed to talk to police as recently</p>
<p>as 2021, but detectives believe that he knows more than he&rsquo;s letting on.</p>
<p>He is still alive today and lives in the Charlotte area.</p>
<p>Now that man, who police declined to identify, was considered a strong person of interest</p>
<p>then and still today.</p>
<p>But police do have his DNA on file, and it did not match the unknown evidence from Viola&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone.</p>
<p>So suspicion, coupled with circumstantial evidence, however credible, just isn&rsquo;t enough,</p>
<p>at least in most investigations, to charge someone with murder.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s assume for a minute that this man&rsquo;s prints or DNA did turn up in the apartment</p>
<p>when police were working the scene.</p>
<p>People were always coming and going from Viola&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>It was a hub of social activity, and this guy was family.</p>
<p>He had spent many years around that apartment.</p>
<p>So honestly, uncovering his prints in the apartment would prove very little, if anything.</p>
<p>I mean, as Viola&rsquo;s grandson, he had a perfectly legitimate reason for being in the apartment.</p>
<p>In March of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down day-to-day life and forced most</p>
<p>work to go remote, Detective Williams, like the rest of us, had no idea what was ahead</p>
<p>or how long he was going to have to keep out of the field.</p>
<p>So when he started working from home, he took Viola&rsquo;s case file with him.</p>
<p>And all I did in my basement every day was read the case, thinking there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m missing, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m missing.</p>
<p>As he poured over the materials in his basement, Detective Williams felt compelled to do something.</p>
<p>And while in quarantine, there was only so much he could do.</p>
<p>But because Detective Williams moonlights as a radio DJ for WSGE in Charlotte, he decided</p>
<p>to use his unique platform and hit the airwaves to make a call out for Viola in November of</p>
<p>2020.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason anybody should be murdered, but there was no reason this lady should have</p>
<p>been murdered.</p>
<p>She was just minding her own business.</p>
<p>She was a happy lady, a happy grandmother, a happy mom.</p>
<p>And somebody took her life for $700.</p>
<p>And I want to bring closure to this family because, again, nobody, and I mean nobody</p>
<p>deserves to die like this woman died.</p>
<p>So if you have any information at all, please contact me.</p>
<p>Even though that broadcast was almost two years ago, Detective Williams&rsquo; message these</p>
<p>days, both on and off the airwaves, remains the same.</p>
<p>Is this case solvable?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If this case was unsolvable, you and I wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here because I would have thought</p>
<p>this is a waste of time.</p>
<p>But yes, I think it&rsquo;s solvable.</p>
<p>I think we just need one person to tell us something because we have some other evidence,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have enough evidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to put somebody in jail because I think they did it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t work like that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know anybody in my unit that works like that.</p>
<p>We put people in jail because we know they did it.</p>
<p>And I want to know without a doubt that if I&rsquo;m putting handcuffs on somebody, that they</p>
<p>committed this crime.</p>
<p>And all I need is for one person to come out and tell me, tell me something, tell me the</p>
<p>information I need, and I can wrap everything up.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re that close, but we just need someone to talk to us.</p>
<p>Christopher said there have been times over the last 30 years that he&rsquo;s wanted to give</p>
<p>up because he felt like he would never know what happened to his grandma.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of family members since that time.</p>
<p>They went on and died without knowing the truth, at least here on earth.</p>
<p>While he has gone back to being hopeful for an arrest in Viola&rsquo;s case, Christopher knows</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a chance that he too will pass on someday not knowing what happened that</p>
<p>morning inside his grandma&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>I tell my children that if you have to, I tell my older children, if I&rsquo;m not here, you</p>
<p>keep calling the police to see if there are any new leads, anything, that we can get this</p>
<p>solved.</p>
