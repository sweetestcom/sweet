    <p>hi how are you today</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Syrian</p>
<p>and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder Mystery and makeup Monday</p>
<p>mmm mmm mmm</p>
<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>every Monday I sit down</p>
<p>I get ready and I talk about a true crime story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on my brain</p>
<p>if you like true crime</p>
<p>and you like makeup</p>
<p>well guess what welcome</p>
<p>you made it</p>
<p>so I just have to start this off with a disclaimer</p>
<p>I do I should be doing this in every video</p>
<p>but today&rsquo;s kind of gruesome</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie</p>
<p>warning The following presentation is intended for</p>
<p>mature audiences</p>
<p>viewer discretion is advised</p>
<p>so maybe you&rsquo;ve seen Psycho</p>
<p>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</p>
<p>mmm the Silence of the Lambs</p>
<p>these are the types of films that you see</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like oh my gosh</p>
<p>thank God it&rsquo;s just a movie</p>
<p>but what if I told you that characters in those movies</p>
<p>were based off a real guy</p>
<p>his name was Edward Guin</p>
<p>are you familiar</p>
<p>okay well that&rsquo;s who we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about edward&rsquo;s family first</p>
<p>I think we should start there</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good place to start</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s mother and father were Augusta and George</p>
<p>and Augusta would be described as a thick set</p>
<p>books and woman</p>
<p>she was very intimidating</p>
<p>like she had a very stern face</p>
<p>Augusta had been brought up to obey</p>
<p>strict code of conduct</p>
<p>which her father had not hesitated to reinforce</p>
<p>with regular beatings</p>
<p>and was raised in an extremely strict household</p>
<p>with very hardcore religious beliefs</p>
<p>George as soon to be father</p>
<p>he was described as a strong</p>
<p>straight man</p>
<p>with a reserved</p>
<p>even dignified manner</p>
<p>he was an orphan at a young age</p>
<p>sadly his family had died in</p>
<p>I think I read sorry</p>
<p>the Mississippi River</p>
<p>I guess there was a flooding</p>
<p>and they drowned</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a stable home</p>
<p>George worked many jobs</p>
<p>he worked on a railroad carpenter</p>
<p>insurance salesman</p>
<p>it was rumored that he couldn&rsquo;t keep a job</p>
<p>because he loved to drink</p>
<p>he liked alcohol</p>
<p>and he was always getting drunk</p>
<p>he would spend all of his money on alcohol</p>
<p>so how Augusta</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s mom and George got together</p>
<p>is no I don&rsquo;t think anybody really knows</p>
<p>but they somehow got together</p>
<p>said to be that Augusta liked George</p>
<p>because he was a pushover</p>
<p>and George liked Augusta because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>people would say that</p>
<p>Augusta was verbally abusive to him</p>
<p>calling him worthless</p>
<p>good for nothing lazy dog</p>
<p>and she would do it in public too</p>
<p>George would go to a local tavern after work</p>
<p>and he would get pretty drunk</p>
<p>and when he would go back home</p>
<p>he would beat Augusta</p>
<p>cause that was like</p>
<p>the only way he would get any type of courage</p>
<p>to stand up to her</p>
<p>when he would beat Augusta</p>
<p>it would lead to Augusta on her hands and knees</p>
<p>praying to God to please kill her husband</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a good situation</p>
<p>but Augusta did crave the need for children</p>
<p>and for family as well</p>
<p>so in January of 19 o 2</p>
<p>the first born came</p>
<p>his name was Henry</p>
<p>19 o 6 Edward was born</p>
<p>and they lived in Lacrosse Wisconsin</p>
<p>so then in 1915 Augusta</p>
<p>she forced her husband to leave the sinkhole of filth</p>
<p>which was lacrosse</p>
<p>and moved to what she believed</p>
<p>to be a more righteous location</p>
<p>which was on 155 acre farm</p>
<p>in the town of Plainfield Wisconsin</p>
<p>she kept her 2 sons on the farm</p>
<p>and away from anything considered dangerous or sinful</p>
<p>she kept her boys away from those sinful</p>
<p>whorish women</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what she said</p>
<p>she was afraid of horse</p>
<p>or she no no no no</p>
<p>she highly disliked horse</p>
<p>she just thought every woman besides her</p>
<p>I guess was a whore</p>
<p>and she took full advantage of this farm</p>
<p>that they lived on</p>
<p>because they were in complete isolation</p>
<p>so she just like</p>
<p>really locked up the kids</p>
<p>she just would make them do chores around the farm</p>
<p>and then they could go to school</p>
<p>that was it</p>
<p>and then they had to come straight home</p>
<p>do their chores</p>
<p>Augusta was extremely religious</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t caught on</p>
<p>she preached to her boys</p>
<p>about the immorality of the world</p>
<p>and her belief that all women except herself</p>
<p>were naturally prostitutes</p>
<p>and instruments of the devil</p>
<p>so Edward Edward</p>
<p>Edward Edward</p>
<p>Edward was described as being shy</p>
<p>his classmates</p>
<p>teachers would say that he had very strange mannerisms</p>
<p>when I first read these mannerisms</p>
<p>I was like is that strange</p>
<p>though you see</p>
<p>I guess Edward would just like</p>
<p>bust out laughing randomly</p>
<p>and Edward would say that</p>
<p>he was laughing at his own inside jokes</p>
<p>that he was saying in his head</p>
<p>and that was odd</p>
<p>is that weird</p>
<p>I thought that was normal</p>
<p>anyways I just had to say that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hilarious</p>
<p>and I make myself laugh all the time</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not a killer</p>
<p>so I guess that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>oh Edward did not have many friends</p>
<p>actually he really didn&rsquo;t have any friends at all</p>
<p>poor kid and when he did make friends</p>
<p>his mom Augusta was</p>
<p>heavily against that</p>
<p>because they were gonna allow sin into his life</p>
<p>she did not want him to have friends</p>
<p>so she completely went off on him</p>
<p>if he even mentioned to talking to anybody else now</p>
<p>because Edward</p>
<p>Henry Augusta</p>
<p>and George well</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where George was at</p>
<p>he apparently was always working or drunk</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really all you hear about</p>
<p>Augusta and Ed</p>
<p>they were very very close</p>
<p>they were like</p>
<p>inseparable</p>
<p>Edward would say that</p>
<p>his mom was like</p>
<p>his first love</p>
<p>his best friend</p>
<p>he was obsessed with his mom</p>
<p>then comes April 1st 1940</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>George dies</p>
<p>he dies of heart failure</p>
<p>they think it had to do with him drinking</p>
<p>so Henry and Ed</p>
<p>they both had to pick up some</p>
<p>odd jobs around the town</p>
<p>to help cover living expenses</p>
<p>and then Henry</p>
<p>the brother</p>
<p>he began dating</p>
<p>a divorced single</p>
<p>mother of 2</p>
<p>and they were planning on moving in together</p>
<p>Henry was concerned for Edward</p>
<p>he seemed very attached to his mom</p>
<p>and like Henry was moving on with his life</p>
<p>he was getting out</p>
<p>he was gonna get married</p>
<p>to this new girl</p>
<p>Edward was just kind of stuck at home</p>
<p>obsessed with his mom</p>
<p>he needed to get out there</p>
<p>meet some ladies</p>
<p>start his own life</p>
<p>so Henry kind of expressed this to Edward</p>
<p>and then he also</p>
<p>spoke pretty poorly</p>
<p>about Augusta to Edward</p>
<p>and this upset Edward</p>
<p>so then May 16th 1944</p>
<p>Henry and Ed</p>
<p>they were out working on the farm</p>
<p>and they were burning away</p>
<p>marsh vegetation on the property</p>
<p>reportedly the fire got out of control</p>
<p>fire department came out</p>
<p>put the fire out</p>
<p>but then Edwards said that his brother was missing</p>
<p>like where&rsquo;s Henry</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s at a search party was together looking for Henry</p>
<p>and then eventually they found his body lying face down</p>
<p>apparently he had been dead for some time Henry</p>
<p>it appeared that the cause of death was heart failure</p>
<p>since he had not been burned</p>
<p>it was later reported that</p>
<p>Henry had bruises on his head</p>
<p>which was weird but okay</p>
<p>police dismissed the possibility of foul playing</p>
<p>coroner later officially listed asphyxiation</p>
<p>as the cause of death</p>
<p>some would suspect that Ed killed his brother</p>
<p>but this would just be all speculation</p>
<p>no one really has proof of that</p>
<p>but knowing what we&rsquo;re gonna know</p>
<p>he probably killed his brother</p>
<p>yeah Edward seemed to be happy</p>
<p>he finally had his mother all to himself</p>
<p>although a year later</p>
<p>Augusta had a stroke and was confined to her bed</p>
<p>ed would tend to her day and night</p>
<p>and she would still like</p>
<p>verbally abuse him</p>
<p>he was very mean to him</p>
<p>she would call him a weakling</p>
<p>and a failure</p>
<p>and that he would never be able to survive without her</p>
<p>anyway so it turns out Augusta died</p>
<p>sorry she died</p>
<p>December 1945</p>
<p>she had a stroke</p>
<p>so this poor family is just not doing too well right</p>
<p>so Edward was 39 when this happened right</p>
<p>and he was devastated by the loss of his mother</p>
<p>he was left alone to really fend for himself</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been given no life skills</p>
<p>well besides like</p>
<p>working small odd jobs</p>
<p>but like no social skills</p>
<p>yeah so doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s gonna be good</p>
<p>but this is when things just went downhill</p>
<p>now the home that they lived in was huge</p>
<p>it was a pretty good sized home</p>
<p>so Edward had it all to himself</p>
<p>so he ended up like</p>
<p>boarding up all the rooms to the house</p>
<p>and he kept his mom&rsquo;s room in perfect condition</p>
<p>like she never left</p>
<p>I mean that was probably because it was an effort</p>
<p>to repress the fact that she had died</p>
<p>the rest of the house was completely neglected</p>
<p>I mean there was trash piled everywhere</p>
<p>inside this home</p>
<p>he had piles of household items furniture</p>
<p>mounds of dust</p>
<p>collecting on all of the items inside of the home</p>
<p>he mainly like</p>
<p>hung out in the kitchen area</p>
<p>and it was just trash</p>
<p>and garbage everywhere</p>
<p>it looked like</p>
<p>what we know now</p>
<p>is someone who is a hoarder</p>
<p>for some time</p>
<p>no one seemed to really even notice</p>
<p>Ed poor guy</p>
<p>he was a loner</p>
<p>he rarely ventured off the farm</p>
<p>you would only see him in town</p>
<p>when he was running errands</p>
<p>or stop for an occasional beer</p>
<p>at Mary hogan&rsquo;s Tavern</p>
<p>and then of course</p>
<p>once everything went down</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when people started to like</p>
<p>second guess on</p>
<p>maybe some conversations they had with Ed like</p>
<p>maybe they should have paid more attention to the signs</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard because sometimes people are just odd</p>
<p>and like that&rsquo;s who they are</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not doing anything shady within</p>
<p>there are people who are odd</p>
<p>like Edward</p>
<p>and they are up to no good</p>
<p>how do you tell the difference</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>after everything comes out</p>
<p>about Edward</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when people are</p>
<p>starting to realize</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>he made some weird comments</p>
<p>a lot of the time</p>
<p>ed&rsquo;s jokes they were always weird</p>
<p>Mary Hogan she&rsquo;s the tavern owner</p>
<p>that everyone</p>
<p>would go have a beer at</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>she went missing one day</p>
<p>and like the only thing that was left behind</p>
<p>of Mary was a</p>
<p>like a pool of blood</p>
<p>but no one ever saw Mary again</p>
<p>but Ed would joke</p>
<p>saying that she was staying overnight at his house</p>
<p>he would say it</p>
<p>in a joking manner</p>
<p>but in their mind</p>
<p>they would think</p>
<p>that was a tasteless joke</p>
<p>people in the town</p>
<p>would think oh</p>
<p>old Ed wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anybody</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>bernice Warden</p>
<p>disappeared</p>
<p>bernice Warden</p>
<p>she disappeared</p>
<p>November 16th 1957</p>
<p>late that afternoon</p>
<p>Frank Warden returned to town</p>
<p>from a day of deer hunting</p>
<p>and stopped by the hardware store</p>
<p>where Bernice worked</p>
<p>bernice was his mom</p>
<p>and he was just stopping by</p>
<p>to check on her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s 58 years old</p>
<p>she was a widow</p>
<p>he noticed that</p>
<p>bernice wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>and it was weird</p>
<p>because she had left the door unlocked</p>
<p>and she left the back door open</p>
<p>so then Frank kind of</p>
<p>looks around the hardware store</p>
<p>and then he sees</p>
<p>by the register</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a trail of blood</p>
<p>like I guess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just blood</p>
<p>is on the floor</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>leading outwards</p>
<p>or like smudge</p>
<p>towards the exit</p>
<p>and this worries Frank</p>
<p>frank looks at like</p>
<p>the register area</p>
<p>and he finds a receipt</p>
<p>and it was a receipt for 1/2 gallon of antifreeze</p>
<p>and it had been made out</p>
<p>to Ed ed ed</p>
<p>ed so Frank</p>
<p>is thinking suspicious</p>
<p>not even suspicious</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a full red flag</p>
<p>ed no something</p>
<p>he notifies police</p>
<p>and lets them know like hey</p>
<p>my mom&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>ed I think he was the last customer</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no receipts</p>
<p>after that the police come out</p>
<p>and they look at the hardware store</p>
<p>and then they decide to</p>
<p>all pretty much</p>
<p>go to ed&rsquo;s farm</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>need to question him</p>
<p>he was doing</p>
<p>at the hardware store</p>
<p>does he know</p>
<p>where Miss warden&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whereabouts are</p>
<p>so the police officers</p>
<p>when they arrive</p>
<p>they search his home</p>
<p>and then they find</p>
<p>the body of Bernice</p>
<p>in the back</p>
<p>they call it</p>
<p>a summer kitchen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s behind the house</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what a summer kitchen is</p>
<p>it sounds fancy</p>
<p>but Bernice</p>
<p>was in there again</p>
<p>I added a disclaimer</p>
<p>and I apologize</p>
<p>but like this is weird</p>
<p>bernice they</p>
<p>they find Bernice</p>
<p>she was hanging</p>
<p>by her feet</p>
<p>from an overhead pulley</p>
<p>and she was naked</p>
<p>there was a cut in Bernice</p>
<p>from her pelvic bone</p>
<p>all the way to like</p>
<p>her chest area</p>
<p>Edward was taking out</p>
<p>her insides</p>
<p>and like letting it drain</p>
<p>also she was</p>
<p>decapitated</p>
<p>for obvious reasons</p>
<p>this stunned</p>
<p>and sickened officers</p>
<p>and they immediately called for backup</p>
<p>and a short time later</p>
<p>about a dozen</p>
<p>other law enforcement</p>
<p>officers showed up</p>
<p>to the house</p>
<p>they go in and they see</p>
<p>carbon bernice</p>
<p>so that warrants them</p>
<p>to then search</p>
<p>the rest of the farm</p>
<p>area and make sure</p>
<p>well first of all</p>
<p>they need to find</p>
<p>bernice&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>but they also</p>
<p>wanna make sure that</p>
<p>like what else</p>
<p>is on this property</p>
<p>so they all</p>
<p>started combing the farm</p>
<p>and exploring</p>
<p>the contents</p>
<p>of what would become</p>
<p>known as Ed</p>
<p>geen&rsquo;s House</p>
<p>of Horrors oh</p>
<p>horrors not horrors</p>
<p>so when the police officers</p>
<p>searched the home</p>
<p>they found lots of</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>now the things</p>
<p>that are gonna come out of my</p>
<p>mouth right</p>
<p>now the things</p>
<p>that were found</p>
<p>in this house</p>
<p>are so hard to believe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like yeah right</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>and then you Google the images</p>
<p>you realize that it&rsquo;s very much real</p>
<p>they search the home</p>
<p>what do they find</p>
<p>where do we begin</p>
<p>a lot of skulls</p>
<p>human skulls</p>
<p>and these skulls have been sought off</p>
<p>and turned into soup bowls</p>
<p>they also found a chair</p>
<p>that had been upholstered in human skin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the seat of the chair</p>
<p>like he used human skin and sewed it onto this chair</p>
<p>I thought Armin was crafty</p>
<p>nene ed was a different level</p>
<p>yep he did that</p>
<p>so then he made lampshades out of flesh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding you</p>
<p>he made lampshades out of flesh</p>
<p>there was a box that was discovered</p>
<p>and it contained nothing but human noses</p>
<p>like he sawed off the nose</p>
<p>and he put it in a box for a rainy day</p>
<p>but I remember back in high school reading about this</p>
<p>and it was just like what Edward made a belt</p>
<p>you know a belt that you wear on your jeans</p>
<p>he made a belt</p>
<p>and it had the whole buckle and everything on it</p>
<p>but he made it out of women&rsquo;s nipples</p>
<p>I wish I could show you a picture</p>
<p>I really do because it&rsquo;s like huh first of all</p>
<p>how did he even think of this thing nipples belt</p>
<p>Edward um he made a shade pole</p>
<p>and it had been decorated with a pair of women&rsquo;s lips</p>
<p>there was a shoebox under a bed</p>
<p>and it contained a collection of</p>
<p>dried women&rsquo;s genitalia</p>
<p>guess what there&rsquo;s more then okay</p>
<p>on one wall of this house</p>
<p>I there was the faces of 9 women</p>
<p>so Edward cut I don&rsquo;t even know how to describe this</p>
<p>he cut the face peeled the skin off</p>
<p>made sure to keep like the face intact</p>
<p>so you could see tell it&rsquo;s a face</p>
<p>and then he used it as wall decoration</p>
<p>Edward had seemed to be making or like sewing</p>
<p>hand sewing a shirt out of human skin</p>
<p>and there was breasts that he peeled off of somebody</p>
<p>and sewed it onto the shirt</p>
<p>and he sewed together this</p>
<p>this this shirt</p>
<p>this long sleeve shirt of different types of skin</p>
<p>that he collected from different bodies</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all sewn together</p>
<p>wow now Edward would later explain</p>
<p>what exactly he was doing</p>
<p>because he made leggings out of skin as well</p>
<p>he was making a whole bodysuit</p>
<p>he made leggings</p>
<p>he made a corset from a female torso</p>
<p>Edward would later on say that</p>
<p>he would put on this long sleeve shirt and leggings</p>
<p>he wanted to essentially dress up and be a woman</p>
<p>and that he wanted to be his mother</p>
<p>so he would dress up like a lady</p>
<p>in his skin outfit and walk around in it</p>
<p>for the night</p>
<p>he said he would just kind of sit around</p>
<p>or even go outside in his new skin</p>
<p>he was pretending to be his mother</p>
<p>they just kept finding more and more stuff</p>
<p>they found skulls on his bed post</p>
<p>do you remember Mary</p>
<p>the tavern owner</p>
<p>well they ended up finding her face in a plastic bag</p>
<p>he like skinned it already</p>
<p>and then they found like tons of fingernails tongs</p>
<p>they found it all</p>
<p>and then just to make it all worse</p>
<p>because you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already here</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s just keep it going</p>
<p>they opened up the refrigerator</p>
<p>and then they see that there is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just stocked with human organs</p>
<p>there was a human heart that was found on the stove</p>
<p>no word on what he was gonna do</p>
<p>was he gonna eat it</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they think roughly</p>
<p>there is about 15 different bodies</p>
<p>that was found in edward&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>the police had been at the house</p>
<p>like all day</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>searching and grabbing all these items for evidence</p>
<p>discovering more and more stuff</p>
<p>and then at about 4 30 in the morning</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they discovered a bloody burlap sack</p>
<p>and then inside of it was a freshly severed head</p>
<p>inserted into the ears</p>
<p>were large nails connected with twine</p>
<p>it was indeed Bernice</p>
<p>they asked Edward</p>
<p>you know what were you doing</p>
<p>why are there nails in her head</p>
<p>and Edward said</p>
<p>that he was gonna hang bernice&rsquo;s head on the wall</p>
<p>as decoration</p>
<p>so again for a minute</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super easy to be like this is this can&rsquo;t be real</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>ed had some problems</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you caught on to that yet</p>
<p>now I just have to say just really quick side note</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t insert any of the images because they are</p>
<p>they could ruin your day</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re curious</p>
<p>you can Google these images and see</p>
<p>like the lampshades and stuff</p>
<p>and this bodysuit</p>
<p>he made gloves</p>
<p>he made gloves</p>
<p>the flipping nipple belt</p>
<p>how did he think of these things</p>
<p>how do you learn how to sew the lampshade</p>
<p>you have to see the lampshade</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what the how did</p>
<p>but look I got</p>
<p>I just got keep it Real</p>
<p>he was really like what&rsquo;s the word</p>
<p>um crafty DIY King</p>
<p>and yes it&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting</p>
<p>what he did</p>
<p>obviously Edward was taken</p>
<p>and eventually they got Edward to admit the murders</p>
<p>of Bernice and the tavern owner Mary</p>
<p>he confessed to killing Mary later on down the road</p>
<p>I think a couple years later</p>
<p>but they eventually got him to confess about it</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re probably wondering like okay</p>
<p>well if you only killed those 2 people</p>
<p>where did he get all those bodies</p>
<p>he lived not far from a cemetery for about 12 years</p>
<p>after his mom died</p>
<p>he would visit the local cemetery at night</p>
<p>he met a friend there</p>
<p>his name was Gus</p>
<p>and Gus would help him dig up grave sites or graves</p>
<p>and open up the caskets and get the bodies out</p>
<p>gus didn&rsquo;t help participate in the crafting</p>
<p>that Edward had going on</p>
<p>Edward would say that the skin of the bodies</p>
<p>that were already dead</p>
<p>for a while</p>
<p>the skin was really dry and hard to work with</p>
<p>like it wasn&rsquo;t easy to sew the skin</p>
<p>and make his little outfits</p>
<p>so he needed new and fresh skin</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why he decided to kill</p>
<p>he liked fresh skin</p>
<p>because it was plump and moisturized</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making this up</p>
<p>Edward was charged with one</p>
<p>count of first degree murder</p>
<p>he pled not guilty for reasons of insanity</p>
<p>a lot of people claim that they&rsquo;re insane</p>
<p>just so they could get like</p>
<p>an easier sentence</p>
<p>but I will have to 100 agree that Edward</p>
<p>would fall into that category</p>
<p>for sure yeah</p>
<p>he was unfit to stand trial</p>
<p>and was sent to the Central State Hospital</p>
<p>for the Criminally Insane</p>
<p>and then 10 years later</p>
<p>he was sane enough for trial</p>
<p>within a week</p>
<p>he was found</p>
<p>guilty of first degree murder</p>
<p>as far as edward&rsquo;s house goes</p>
<p>so people in the community hated this house</p>
<p>not only did they think it</p>
<p>it was just representing evil and absolute disgust</p>
<p>but it was also bringing a lot of tourists</p>
<p>but they decided to put the house up for auction</p>
<p>and then mysteriously</p>
<p>edward&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>caught on fire</p>
<p>and burned down to the ground</p>
<p>arson was suspected</p>
<p>and people were actually kind of happy</p>
<p>that the house was gone</p>
<p>honestly I think it&rsquo;s probably better</p>
<p>that the house was gone</p>
<p>yeah yeah Ed stayed locked up in an institution</p>
<p>for the rest of his life</p>
<p>he ended up passing away</p>
<p>July 26 1984</p>
<p>when he passed away</p>
<p>and then when he died</p>
<p>they took his body and buried it in Plain Fields</p>
<p>and they gave him a headstone</p>
<p>had his name on it</p>
<p>course people went crazy</p>
<p>I guess people would go and visit his grave</p>
<p>and then they would take peace</p>
<p>like they would break off a piece of his headstone</p>
<p>to take home as</p>
<p>like a souvenir</p>
<p>which come on</p>
<p>you guys get better idols</p>
<p>eventually in 2000</p>
<p>somebody stole the whole headstone</p>
<p>was found later in</p>
<p>like Seattle</p>
<p>okay it was decided that</p>
<p>Ed was not gonna get a headstone</p>
<p>because it was just bringing too many people</p>
<p>ed is still buried in playing field</p>
<p>but he has no headstone</p>
<p>so then of course</p>
<p>his story did not end there</p>
<p>so in 1960 the movie</p>
<p>psycho came out</p>
<p>and it was based off the character</p>
<p>in a book by Robert Blotsch</p>
<p>who was based off of Ed</p>
<p>and then in 1974</p>
<p>there was a movie called deranged</p>
<p>and in that movie</p>
<p>there is a killer named Ezra</p>
<p>and who is also based off of Edward</p>
<p>1974 we have the Texas Chainsaw Massacre</p>
<p>based off Ed</p>
<p>and then in 1999 no</p>
<p>and then in 1991</p>
<p>we have Academy Award winning movie</p>
<p>silence of the Lambs</p>
<p>the character</p>
<p>Buffalo Bill</p>
<p>was based off of Edward</p>
<p>I guess Edward brought good movies</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to turn this into a positive</p>
<p>Edwards story</p>
<p>inspired many documentaries many books</p>
<p>some people would call Edward a serial killer</p>
<p>but I feel like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s debatable</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>Edward was a serial killer</p>
<p>I think he was more of a just a straight body snatcher</p>
<p>would be the best way to describe him</p>
<p>I think we can all agree</p>
<p>he was very sick</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what will a switch went off in his head</p>
<p>to actually take it</p>
<p>to the level that it was taken</p>
<p>with that being said</p>
<p>what can we take away</p>
<p>and learn from this story</p>
<p>I have no idea</p>
<p>yeah and that&rsquo;s the story about</p>
<p>Edward Keen</p>
<p>so sorry to ruin your day like this</p>
<p>but we needed to learn about Ed anyways</p>
<p>I hope you have a really good day today</p>
<p>sorry but other than that</p>
<p>I hope you have a really good day</p>
<p>today you make good choices</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
