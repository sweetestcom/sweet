about the relationship between the friendly bacteria you have in your gut and around your body as well as the friendly fungus and so i want to talk about this relationship because people think that your microbiome all your microbes are just primarily bacteria when you have a lot of different species going on you have viruses you have different types of funguses like yeast and so they&amp;rsquo;re all supposed to live together in harmony but anytime you learn a new topic it&amp;rsquo;s very important to define the words within that topic to really understand the definitions of these basic words so let me go through a few things and so all the bacteria in your gut the friendly bacteria is called the microbiome and all the friendly fungus is called the mycobiome one of the challenges with studying fungus and which by the way it&amp;rsquo;s not very studied because it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to culture fungus and so the friendly bacteria and the friendly fungus remain friendly until the environment changes they have the potential to become pathogenic so they can actually morph into pathogenic strains and create a lot of problems in center bodies now the three new words i&amp;rsquo;m going to define and this basically relates to the relationship that you have with these microbes you have mutualism which you have two organisms two different species that are benefiting from each other right they&amp;rsquo;re exchanging with each other and so we give our microbes a place to stay we give them space and they give us immune protection they give us vitamins they give us a lot of other things so that&amp;rsquo;s called mutualism then you have something called commensalism okay that&amp;rsquo;s where one species benefits while the other one neither benefits nor is harmful so that would be maybe someone that lives with you that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily take up too much space they&amp;rsquo;re not paying for rent they&amp;rsquo;re not doing much to help you but they&amp;rsquo;re also not doing anything to harm you as well so that&amp;rsquo;s called commensalism then we have another relationship called parasitism okay this is where you have someone that takes but doesn&amp;rsquo;t give back but also creates some destruction or harm so for example if you get a parasite in your gut they&amp;rsquo;re gonna rub all your nutrition they don&amp;rsquo;t protect your immune system they just deplete you of nutrients and they create other problems and that could be someone that comes to your house and actually rips you off or steals something they take something but they don&amp;rsquo;t give you anything back and so in our bodies we have these different relationships with microbes that can either help us do nothing or harm us just like we have in life right but the main point i want to bring up about this video because people think that all funguses are bad what are some benefits that the fungus gives us well it just so happens when you get treated with an antibiotic you end up getting a fungal infection like candida but when you get treated with an anti-fungal infections and it kills off all the fungus you end up getting a bacterial infection so that bacteria becomes pathogenic one bacterial infection would be e coli for example see normally we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to have a certain amount of key coli that lives in our body that is not unfriendly until the environment changes and so one big function that the fungus has is to keep the bacteria in check so you don&amp;rsquo;t actually have these fungus turning to the dark side becoming pathogenic or overgrowing in large amounts same thing with viruses you have viruses in your gut that actually keep the bacteria in check and also the bacteria keep the fungus in check so they all work together and so the really important thing we need to learn from this is that anytime you use an antibiotic or an antifungal or anything that destroys the microorganisms living in our body it comes with a package you start getting unfriendly bacteria unfriendly fungus unfriendly parasites and so it&amp;rsquo;s very very important to recognize the function of these microbes and take care of them now if you have a candida infection or you have a fungus growing in your toenails or whatever there&amp;rsquo;s various things that you can do instead of taking an anti-fungal which has side effects there&amp;rsquo;s things that you can take that have no side effects but they can definitely help control the pathogenic fungus as well as the pathogenic bacteria and the number one thing that will do that would be oregano oil now you can take that as a supplement or you can actually even take the oil and put into it like a neti pot and infuse it into the sinuses if there&amp;rsquo;s a fungus infection in your sinuses another really interesting natural anti-fungal would be gemnema which normally is a plant that helps diabetes in fact if you ever take gemnema as a herb and you chew on it it&amp;rsquo;ll actually block the taste of sweet so if you&amp;rsquo;re consuming anything with sugar you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to taste that sugar so i&amp;rsquo;ve done videos on that before so oregano oil is really really powerful gemnema is a really good one as well as taking a friendly fungus and there&amp;rsquo;s two that i recommend saccharomyces cervicia is one of them and the other one is saccharomyces bilardi both of these are friendly yeast and they&amp;rsquo;re even added to certain probiotics and i put a link down below if you want more information about that anyway i think this is an important topic the relationship between bacteria and fungus and the importance of keeping them in check so they don&amp;rsquo;t turn on you and become pathogenic hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down

around your body as well as the friendly fungus  </p><p>and so i want to talk about this relationship 
because people think that your microbiome  </p><p>all your microbes are just primarily bacteria 
when you have a lot of different species going  </p><p>on you have viruses you have different types of 
funguses like yeast and so they&rsquo;re all supposed  </p><p>to live together in harmony but anytime you 
learn a new topic it&rsquo;s very important to define  </p><p>the words within that topic to really understand 
the definitions of these basic words so let me  </p><p>go through a few things and so all the bacteria 
in your gut the friendly bacteria is called the  </p><p>microbiome and all the friendly fungus is called 
the mycobiome one of the challenges with studying  </p><p>fungus and which by the way it&rsquo;s not 
very studied because it&rsquo;s very hard to  </p><p>culture fungus and so the friendly bacteria 
and the friendly fungus remain friendly until  </p><p>the environment changes they have the potential to 
become pathogenic so they can actually morph into  </p><p>pathogenic strains and create a lot of problems 
in center bodies now the three new words i&rsquo;m  </p><p>going to define and this basically relates to the 
relationship that you have with these microbes  </p><p>you have mutualism which you have two organisms 
two different species that are benefiting from  </p><p>each other right they&rsquo;re exchanging with each 
other and so we give our microbes a place to  </p><p>stay we give them space and they give us immune 
protection they give us vitamins they give us a  </p><p>lot of other things so that&rsquo;s called mutualism 
then you have something called commensalism  </p><p>okay that&rsquo;s where one species benefits while 
the other one neither benefits nor is harmful  </p><p>so that would be maybe someone that lives 
with you that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily take up too  </p><p>much space they&rsquo;re not paying for rent they&rsquo;re not 
doing much to help you but they&rsquo;re also not doing  </p><p>anything to harm you as well so that&rsquo;s called 
commensalism then we have another relationship  </p><p>called parasitism okay this is where you have 
someone that takes but doesn&rsquo;t give back but also  </p><p>creates some destruction or harm so for example 
if you get a parasite in your gut they&rsquo;re gonna  </p><p>rub all your nutrition they don&rsquo;t protect your 
immune system they just deplete you of nutrients  </p><p>and they create other problems and that could be 
someone that comes to your house and actually rips  </p><p>you off or steals something they take something 
but they don&rsquo;t give you anything back and so in  </p><p>our bodies we have these different relationships 
with microbes that can either help us do nothing  </p><p>or harm us just like we have in life right but 
the main point i want to bring up about this video  </p><p>because people think that all funguses are bad 
what are some benefits that the fungus gives us  </p><p>well it just so happens when you 
get treated with an antibiotic  </p><p>you end up getting a fungal infection like 
candida but when you get treated with an  </p><p>anti-fungal infections and it kills off all the 
fungus you end up getting a bacterial infection  </p><p>so that bacteria becomes pathogenic one bacterial 
infection would be e coli for example see normally  </p><p>we&rsquo;re supposed to have a certain amount 
of key coli that lives in our body that is  </p><p>not unfriendly until the environment changes 
and so one big function that the fungus has  </p><p>is to keep the bacteria in check so 
you don&rsquo;t actually have these fungus  </p><p>turning to the dark side becoming pathogenic 
or overgrowing in large amounts same thing with  </p><p>viruses you have viruses in your gut that actually 
keep the bacteria in check and also the bacteria  </p><p>keep the fungus in check so they all work together 
and so the really important thing we need to learn  </p><p>from this is that anytime you use an antibiotic 
or an antifungal or anything that destroys the  </p><p>microorganisms living in our body it comes with 
a package you start getting unfriendly bacteria  </p><p>unfriendly fungus unfriendly parasites and so 
it&rsquo;s very very important to recognize the function  </p><p>of these microbes and take care of them now 
if you have a candida infection or you have a  </p><p>fungus growing in your toenails or whatever 
there&rsquo;s various things that you can do  </p><p>instead of taking an anti-fungal which 
has side effects there&rsquo;s things that you  </p><p>can take that have no side effects but they 
can definitely help control the pathogenic  </p><p>fungus as well as the pathogenic bacteria and 
the number one thing that will do that would be  </p><p>oregano oil now you can take that as a supplement 
or you can actually even take the oil and put into  </p><p>it like a neti pot and infuse it into the sinuses 
if there&rsquo;s a fungus infection in your sinuses  </p><p>another really interesting natural anti-fungal 
would be gemnema which normally is a plant  </p><p>that helps diabetes in fact if you ever take 
gemnema as a herb and you chew on it it&rsquo;ll  </p><p>actually block the taste of sweet so if you&rsquo;re 
consuming anything with sugar you won&rsquo;t be able  </p><p>to taste that sugar so i&rsquo;ve done videos on that 
before so oregano oil is really really powerful  </p><p>gemnema is a really good one as well as taking a 
friendly fungus and there&rsquo;s two that i recommend  </p><p>saccharomyces cervicia is one of them and the 
other one is saccharomyces bilardi both of these  </p><p>are friendly yeast and they&rsquo;re even added to 
certain probiotics and i put a link down below  </p><p>if you want more information about that anyway i 
think this is an important topic the relationship  </p><p>between bacteria and fungus and the importance of 
keeping them in check so they don&rsquo;t turn on you  </p><p>and become pathogenic hey before you go real 
quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof  </p><p>your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course i want 
you to take it and here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you  </p><p>here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here  </p><p>avoiding your environment but what about here 
what about strengthening your immune system  </p><p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show 
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you  </p><p>can tolerate and resist your environment much 
better by strengthening your own immune system  </p><p>i put a link down in the description right
