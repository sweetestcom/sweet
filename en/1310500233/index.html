    <p>The following is a conversation with Richard Wrangham,</p>
<p>a biological anthropologist at Harvard</p>
<p>specializing in the study of primates</p>
<p>and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,</p>
<p>and other aspects of ape and human behavior</p>
<p>at the individual and societal level.</p>
<p>He began his career over four decades ago</p>
<p>working with Jane Goodall</p>
<p>and studying the behavior of chimps,</p>
<p>and since then has done a lot of seminal work</p>
<p>on human evolution and has proposed</p>
<p>several theories for the roles of fire and violence</p>
<p>in the evolution of us, hairless apes,</p>
<p>otherwise known as homo sapiens.</p>
<p>This is the Lux Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Richard Wrangham.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that we&rsquo;re much less violent</p>
<p>than our close living relatives, the chimps.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are</p>
<p>and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?</p>
<p>Well, I haven&rsquo;t said exactly</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re less violent than chimps.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve said is that there are two kinds of violence.</p>
<p>One stems from proactive aggression</p>
<p>and the other stems from reactive aggression.</p>
<p>Proactive aggression is planned aggression.</p>
<p>Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reactive because it takes place</p>
<p>in seconds after the threat.</p>
<p>And the thing that is really striking about humans</p>
<p>compared to our close relatives is the great reduction</p>
<p>in the degree of reactive aggression.</p>
<p>So we are far less violent than chimps</p>
<p>when prompted by some relatively minor threat</p>
<p>within our own society.</p>
<p>And the way I judge that is with not super satisfactory data</p>
<p>but the study which is particularly striking</p>
<p>is one of people living as hunter gatherers</p>
<p>in a really upsetting kind of environment,</p>
<p>namely people in Australia living in a place</p>
<p>where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of domestic violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a sort of a society that is as bad</p>
<p>from the point of view of violence</p>
<p>as an ordinary society can get.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s excellent data on the frequency</p>
<p>with which people actually have physical violence</p>
<p>and hit each other.</p>
<p>And we can compare that to data</p>
<p>from several different sites comparing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence.</p>
<p>And the difference is between two and three orders</p>
<p>of magnitude.</p>
<p>The frequency with which chimps and bonobos hit each other,</p>
<p>chase each other, charge each other, physically engage</p>
<p>is somewhere between 500 and a thousand times</p>
<p>higher than in humans.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something just amazing about us.</p>
<p>And this has been recognized for centuries.</p>
<p>Aristotle drew attention to the fact that we behave</p>
<p>in many ways like domesticated animals</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so unviolent.</p>
<p>But people say, well, what about the hideous engagements</p>
<p>of this 20th century?</p>
<p>The First and Second World War and much else besides.</p>
<p>And that is all proactive violence.</p>
<p>All of that is gangs of people</p>
<p>making deliberate decisions to go off and attack</p>
<p>in circumstances which ideally the attackers</p>
<p>are going to be able to make their kills</p>
<p>and then get out of there.</p>
<p>In other words, not face confrontation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ordinary way that armies try and work.</p>
<p>And there it turns out that humans and chimpanzees</p>
<p>are in a very similar kind of state.</p>
<p>That is to say, if you look at the rate of death</p>
<p>from chimpanzees conducting proactive coalition violence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very similar in many ways to what you see in humans.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not down regulated with proactive violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this reactive violence</p>
<p>that is strikingly reduced in humans.</p>
<p>So chimpanzees also practiced kind of tribal warfare.</p>
<p>Indeed they do, yeah.</p>
<p>So this was discovered first in 1974.</p>
<p>It was observed first in 1974,</p>
<p>which was about the time that the first major study</p>
<p>of chimpanzees in the wild by Jane Goodall</p>
<p>had been going for something like five years</p>
<p>during of the chimpanzees being observed wherever they went.</p>
<p>Until then, they&rsquo;d been observed at a feeding station</p>
<p>where Jane was luring them in to be observed</p>
<p>by seeing bananas, which is great.</p>
<p>She learned a lot, but she didn&rsquo;t learn</p>
<p>what was happening at the edges of their ranges.</p>
<p>So five years later, it became very obvious</p>
<p>that there was hostile relationships between groups.</p>
<p>And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form</p>
<p>of the kind of hostile relationships</p>
<p>that you see in many animals,</p>
<p>which is a bunch of chimps in this case</p>
<p>shouting at a bunch of other chimps on their borders.</p>
<p>But dramatically, in addition to that,</p>
<p>there is a second kind of interaction.</p>
<p>And that is when a party of chimpanzees</p>
<p>makes a deliberate venture to the edge of their territory,</p>
<p>silently, and then search for members of neighboring groups.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re searching for is a lone individual.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been with chimps when they&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>a lone individual under these circumstances,</p>
<p>or what they think is a lone one,</p>
<p>and they touch each other and look at each other</p>
<p>and then charge forward, very excited.</p>
<p>And then while they&rsquo;re charging,</p>
<p>all of a sudden, the place where they heard a lone call</p>
<p>erupts with a volley of calls.</p>
<p>It was just one calling out of a larger party.</p>
<p>And our chimps put on the brakes</p>
<p>and scoot back for safety into their own territory.</p>
<p>But if in fact they do find a lone individual</p>
<p>and they can sneak up to them,</p>
<p>then they make a deliberate attack.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hunting, they&rsquo;re stalking and hunting,</p>
<p>and then they impose terrible damage,</p>
<p>which typically ends in a kill straight away,</p>
<p>but it might end up with the victim so damaged</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.</p>
<p>So that was a very dramatic discovery</p>
<p>because it really made people realize for the first time</p>
<p>that Conrad Lorentz had been wrong</p>
<p>when in the 1960s, in his famous book, On Aggression,</p>
<p>he said, warfare is restricted to humans.</p>
<p>Animals do not deliberately kill each other.</p>
<p>Well, now we know that actually there&rsquo;s a bunch of animals</p>
<p>that deliberately kill each other,</p>
<p>and they always do so under essentially</p>
<p>the same circumstances, which is</p>
<p>when they feel safe doing it.</p>
<p>So humans feel safe doing it when they got a weapon.</p>
<p>Animals feel safe when they have a coalition.</p>
<p>A coalition that has overwhelming power</p>
<p>compared to the victim.</p>
<p>And so wolves will do that, and lions will do that,</p>
<p>and hyenas will do that, and chimpanzees will do it,</p>
<p>and humans do it too.</p>
<p>Can they pull themselves into something</p>
<p>that looks more like a symmetric war</p>
<p>as opposed to an asymmetric one?</p>
<p>So accidentally engaging on the lone individual</p>
<p>and then getting themselves into trouble?</p>
<p>Or are they more aggressive</p>
<p>in avoiding these kinds of battles?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re very, very keen to avoid those kinds of battles,</p>
<p>but occasionally, they can make a mistake.</p>
<p>But so far, there have been no observations</p>
<p>of anything like a battle</p>
<p>in which both sides maintain themselves.</p>
<p>And I think you can very confidently say</p>
<p>that overwhelmingly what happens is</p>
<p>that if they discover that there&rsquo;s several individuals</p>
<p>on the other side, then both sides retreat.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to get hurt.</p>
<p>What they want to do is to hurt others.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Jane Goodall.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve worked with her.</p>
<p>What was it like working with her?</p>
<p>What have you learned from her?</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s a wonderfully independent, courageous person</p>
<p>who she famously began her studies</p>
<p>not as a qualified person in terms of education,</p>
<p>but qualified only by enthusiasm and a considerable</p>
<p>experience, even in her early 20s, with nature.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s courageous in the sense</p>
<p>of being able to take on challenges.</p>
<p>The thing that is very impressive about her</p>
<p>is her total fidelity to the observations,</p>
<p>very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,</p>
<p>waiting until they mount up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve really got a confident picture,</p>
<p>and tremendous attention to individuals.</p>
<p>So that was an interesting problem from her point of view</p>
<p>because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,</p>
<p>this particular community of Kazakus,</p>
<p>this particular community of Kazakela,</p>
<p>about 60 individuals,</p>
<p>so Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.</p>
<p>She was there initially with her mother</p>
<p>and then alone for two or three years</p>
<p>of really intense observation</p>
<p>and then slowly joined by other people.</p>
<p>What she discovered was that there were obvious differences</p>
<p>in individual personality</p>
<p>and the difficulty about that was that</p>
<p>when she reported this to the larger scientific world,</p>
<p>initially her advisors at Cambridge,</p>
<p>they said, well, we don&rsquo;t know how to handle that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got to treat all these animals</p>
<p>as the same basically,</p>
<p>because there is no research tradition</p>
<p>of thinking about personalities.</p>
<p>Well now, whatever it is, 60 years later,</p>
<p>the study of personalities is a very rich part</p>
<p>of the study of animal behavior.</p>
<p>At any rate, the important point in terms of</p>
<p>what was she like is that she stuck to her guns</p>
<p>and she absolutely insisted that we have to show,</p>
<p>describe in great detail the differences in personality</p>
<p>among these individuals</p>
<p>and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologists</p>
<p>to think about what it means.</p>
<p>So what is the process of observation like this like?</p>
<p>Observing the personality but also observing in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not projecting your beliefs about human nature</p>
<p>or animal nature onto chimps,</p>
<p>which is probably really tempting to project.</p>
<p>So your understanding of the way the human world works,</p>
<p>projecting that onto the chimp world.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, it&rsquo;s particularly difficult with chimps</p>
<p>because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very easy to make those projections, as you say.</p>
<p>The process involves making very clear definitions</p>
<p>of what a behavior is.</p>
<p>Aggression can be defined in terms of a forceful hit,</p>
<p>a bite, and so on,</p>
<p>and writing down every time these things happen</p>
<p>and then slowly totting up the numbers of times</p>
<p>that they happen from individual A</p>
<p>towards individuals B, C, D, and E,</p>
<p>so that you build up a very concrete picture</p>
<p>rather than interpreting at any point</p>
<p>and stopping and saying,</p>
<p>well, they seem to be rather aggressive.</p>
<p>So the sort of formal system</p>
<p>is that you build up a pattern of the relationships</p>
<p>based on a description of the different types</p>
<p>of interactions, the aggressive</p>
<p>and the friendly interactions,</p>
<p>and all of these are defined in concrete.</p>
<p>And so from that, you extract a pattern of relationships.</p>
<p>And the relationships can be defined as</p>
<p>relatively friendly, relatively aggressive, competitive,</p>
<p>based on the frequency of these types of interactions.</p>
<p>And so one can talk in terms of individuals</p>
<p>having a relationship which, on the scores of friendliness,</p>
<p>is two standard deviations outside the mean.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>In which direction, sorry, both directions?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that would be, obviously,</p>
<p>the friendly ones would be the ones</p>
<p>who have exceptionally high rates</p>
<p>of spending time close to each other,</p>
<p>of touching each other in a gentle way,</p>
<p>of grooming each other, and, by the way,</p>
<p>finding that those things are correlated with each other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to define a friendship</p>
<p>with a capital F in a very systematic way,</p>
<p>and to compare that between individuals,</p>
<p>but also between communities of chimpanzees</p>
<p>and between different species.</p>
<p>So that, you know, we can say that in some species,</p>
<p>individuals have friends, and others, they don&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>What about just, because there&rsquo;s different personalities</p>
<p>and because they&rsquo;re so fascinating,</p>
<p>what about sort of falling in love</p>
<p>or forming friendships with chimps, you know?</p>
<p>Like really, you know, connecting with them as an observer?</p>
<p>What role does that play?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re tracking these individuals</p>
<p>that are full of life and intelligence</p>
<p>for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Plus, as a human, especially in those days for Jane,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s alone, observing it.</p>
<p>It gets lonely as a human.</p>
<p>I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human being,</p>
<p>observing these other intelligent species.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very reasonable question,</p>
<p>and of course, Jane, in those early years,</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s willing now to talk about the fact</p>
<p>that she regrets, to some extent, how close she became.</p>
<p>And the problem is not just from the humans.</p>
<p>The problem is from the chimpanzees as well,</p>
<p>because they do things</p>
<p>that are extremely affectionate, if you like.</p>
<p>You know, at one point, Jane offered a ripe fruit</p>
<p>to a chimpanzee called David Greybeard.</p>
<p>David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand,</p>
<p>as if to say thank you.</p>
<p>And then I think he gave it back, if I remember rightly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s almost like thank you</p>
<p>and returning the affection by giving the fruit.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>If they did something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it was a gentle squeeze.</p>
<p>I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard,</p>
<p>as occasionally has happened.</p>
<p>Some chimps are aggressive to people,</p>
<p>and others are friendly.</p>
<p>And the ones that are friendly tend to be</p>
<p>rather sympathetic characters,</p>
<p>because they might be ones who are having problems</p>
<p>in their own society.</p>
<p>You know, so Joe Mio in Gombe used to come</p>
<p>and sit next to me quite often,</p>
<p>and he was having a hard time making it in that society,</p>
<p>which I can describe to you in terms of the number</p>
<p>of aggressive interactions, if you want, you know,</p>
<p>but just to be informed about it.</p>
<p>So all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.</p>
<p>And in the community that I&rsquo;ve been working with in Uganda</p>
<p>for the last 30 years, we try extremely hard to impress</p>
<p>on all of the research students who come with us,</p>
<p>that it is absolutely vital that you do not fall</p>
<p>into that temptation.</p>
<p>Now, you know, we heard a story of one person</p>
<p>who did reach out and touch one of our chimps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very bad idea.</p>
<p>Not because the chimp is going to do anything violent</p>
<p>at the time, but because if they learn that humans</p>
<p>are as weak physically as we are compared to them,</p>
<p>then they can take advantage of us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened in Gombe.</p>
<p>So after Jane had done the very obvious thing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re first engaged in this game</p>
<p>of allowing the infants to approach her</p>
<p>and then tickling them and playing with them,</p>
<p>some of those infants had the personality</p>
<p>of wanting to take advantage of that knowledge later.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you had an individual, Frodo,</p>
<p>who was violent on a regular basis towards humans</p>
<p>when he was an adult, and he was quite dangerous.</p>
<p>I mean, he could easily have killed someone.</p>
<p>In fact, he did kill one person.</p>
<p>He killed a baby that he took from a mother,</p>
<p>a human baby, that he took off her hip</p>
<p>when he met her on the path.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a reminder that we&rsquo;re dealing with a species</p>
<p>that are rather humanlike in the range of emotions</p>
<p>they have, in the capacities they have,</p>
<p>and even in the strength they have,</p>
<p>they are in many ways stronger than humans.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to be careful.</p>
<p>So in the full range of friendliness and violence,</p>
<p>the capacity for these very human things.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, it&rsquo;s very obvious with violence,</p>
<p>as we talked about, that they will kill.</p>
<p>They will kill not just strangers.</p>
<p>They can kill other adults within their own group.</p>
<p>They can kill babies that are strangers.</p>
<p>They can kill babies in their own group.</p>
<p>So, you know, this is a long lived individual.</p>
<p>Obviously, these killings can&rsquo;t have very often</p>
<p>because otherwise they&rsquo;d all be dead.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now finding that they can live</p>
<p>to 50 or 60 years in the wild</p>
<p>at relatively low population density</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re big animals eating</p>
<p>a rather specialized kind of food, the ripe fruits.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t happen all the time.</p>
<p>With friendliness, they are very strong</p>
<p>to support each other.</p>
<p>They very much depend on their close friendships,</p>
<p>which they express through physical contact</p>
<p>and particularly through grooming.</p>
<p>So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another.</p>
<p>I might present for grooming,</p>
<p>a very common way of starting,</p>
<p>turning their back or presenting an arm</p>
<p>or something like that, and the other</p>
<p>just riffles their fingers through the hair.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s partly just soothing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s partly looking for parasites,</p>
<p>but mostly it&rsquo;s just soothing.</p>
<p>And the point about this is it can go on</p>
<p>for half an hour, it can go on for sometimes even an hour.</p>
<p>So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.</p>
<p>When did your interest in this one particular aspect</p>
<p>of Chim come to be, which is violence?</p>
<p>When did the study of violence in chimps</p>
<p>become something you&rsquo;re deeply interested in?</p>
<p>Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,</p>
<p>I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall</p>
<p>and was studying feeding behavior.</p>
<p>But during that time, we were seeing,</p>
<p>and I say we because there were half a dozen</p>
<p>research students all in her camp,</p>
<p>we were discovering that chimps</p>
<p>had this capacity for violence.</p>
<p>The first kill happened during that time,</p>
<p>which was of an infant in a neighboring group.</p>
<p>And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.</p>
<p>And this was the start of my interest</p>
<p>because it was such chilling evidence</p>
<p>of an extraordinary similarity between chimps</p>
<p>and humans. Now, at that time,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know very much about how chimpanzees</p>
<p>and humans were related.</p>
<p>Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three</p>
<p>big black hairy things that live in the African forests</p>
<p>and eat fruits and leaves when they can&rsquo;t find fruits</p>
<p>and walk on their knuckles.</p>
<p>And they all look rather similar to each other.</p>
<p>So they seem as though they&rsquo;re very similar</p>
<p>so they seem as though those three species,</p>
<p>chimps and gorillas and bonobos,</p>
<p>should all be each other&rsquo;s closest relatives</p>
<p>and humans are something rather separate.</p>
<p>And so any of them would be of interest to us.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we learn that actually that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a special relationship</p>
<p>between humans and chimpanzees.</p>
<p>But at the time, even without knowing that,</p>
<p>it was obvious that there was something very odd</p>
<p>about chimpanzees because Jane had discovered</p>
<p>they were making tools.</p>
<p>She had seen that they were hunting meat.</p>
<p>She had seen that they were sharing the meat</p>
<p>among each other.</p>
<p>She had seen that the societies were dominated politically</p>
<p>by males, coalitions of males.</p>
<p>All of these things, of course,</p>
<p>resonate so closely with humans.</p>
<p>And then it turns out that in contrast</p>
<p>to conventional wisdom at the time,</p>
<p>the chimpanzees were capable of hunting</p>
<p>and killing members of neighboring groups.</p>
<p>Well, at that point, the similarities</p>
<p>between chimps and humans become less a matter</p>
<p>of sort of sheer intellectual fascination</p>
<p>than something that has a really deep meaning</p>
<p>about our understanding of ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans</p>
<p>as a species apart from the rest of nature</p>
<p>because we are so peculiar.</p>
<p>But when it turns out that, as it turns out,</p>
<p>one of our two closest relatives</p>
<p>has got these features that we share</p>
<p>and that one of the features is something</p>
<p>that is the most horrendous,</p>
<p>as well as fascinating, aspect of human behavior,</p>
<p>then how can you resist just trying</p>
<p>to find out what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>So I have to say this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with a man,</p>
<p>but fans of this podcast are.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about chimps, we&rsquo;re talking about violence.</p>
<p>My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>is a big fan of those things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of these topics.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;re saying, why do we find</p>
<p>the exploration of violence</p>
<p>and the relations between chimps so interesting?</p>
<p>What can they teach us about ourselves?</p>
<p>Until we had this information about chimpanzees,</p>
<p>it was possible to believe that the psychology</p>
<p>behind warfare was totally the result</p>
<p>of some kind of recent cultural innovation.</p>
<p>It had nothing to do with our biology.</p>
<p>Or if you like, that it&rsquo;s got something to do</p>
<p>with sin and God and the devil and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully</p>
<p>about it is that it seems undoubtedly the case</p>
<p>that our evolutionary psychology has given us</p>
<p>the same kind of attitude towards violence</p>
<p>as has occurred in chimpanzees and in both species.</p>
<p>It has evolved because of its evolutionary significance.</p>
<p>In other words, because it&rsquo;s been helpful</p>
<p>to the individuals who have practiced it.</p>
<p>And now we know that, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>other species do this as well.</p>
<p>In fact, wolves, which this is a really kind of</p>
<p>ironical observation, Conrad Lorentz, who I mentioned</p>
<p>had been the person who thought that human aggression</p>
<p>in the form of killing members of our own species</p>
<p>was unique to our species, he was a great fan of wolves.</p>
<p>He studied wolves.</p>
<p>And in captivity, he noted that wolves are very unlikely</p>
<p>to harm each other in spats among members of the same group.</p>
<p>What happens is that one of them will roll over</p>
<p>and present their neck, much as you see in a dog park</p>
<p>nowadays, and the other might put their jaws on the neck</p>
<p>but will not bite.</p>
<p>Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves</p>
<p>in the wild, then neighboring packs often go hunting</p>
<p>for each other, they are in fierce competition,</p>
<p>and as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves</p>
<p>is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really serious business.</p>
<p>The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern</p>
<p>of understanding animals in which you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>an instinct for violence, what you have is an instinct,</p>
<p>if you like, to use violence adaptively.</p>
<p>And if the right circumstances come up, it&rsquo;ll be adaptive,</p>
<p>if the right circumstances don&rsquo;t come up, it won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>So some chimpanzee communities are much more violent</p>
<p>than others because of things like the frequency</p>
<p>with which a large party of males is likely to meet</p>
<p>a lone victim, and that&rsquo;s going to depend</p>
<p>on the local ecology.</p>
<p>But, you know, so the overall answer to the question</p>
<p>of what do chimps teach us is that we have to take</p>
<p>very seriously the notion that in humans,</p>
<p>the tendency to make war is a consequence</p>
<p>of a long term evolutionary adaptation</p>
<p>and not just a military ideology</p>
<p>or some sort of local patriarchal phenomenon.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, a reading of history,</p>
<p>a judicious reading of history fits that very easily</p>
<p>because war is so commonplace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an accident, so it&rsquo;s not a constraint.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an accident, so it&rsquo;s not a construction</p>
<p>of human civilization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deeply within us, violence.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between violence</p>
<p>on the individual level versus group is,</p>
<p>it seems like with chimps and with wolves,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about the dynamic of multiple</p>
<p>chimps together that increase the chance of violence.</p>
<p>Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?</p>
<p>Like would an individual be as violent</p>
<p>as they might be as part of a group?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about killing,</p>
<p>then violence in the sense of killing</p>
<p>is very much associated with a group.</p>
<p>And the reason is that individuals don&rsquo;t benefit</p>
<p>by getting into a fight</p>
<p>in which they risk being hurt themselves.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only when you have overwhelming power</p>
<p>that the temptation to try and kill another victim</p>
<p>rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.</p>
<p>The average number of chimpanzee males</p>
<p>that attack a single male</p>
<p>in something like 50 observations</p>
<p>that have accumulated in the last 50 years</p>
<p>from various different study sites</p>
<p>is eight, eight to one.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes it can go as low as three to one,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s getting risky.</p>
<p>But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.</p>
<p>I mean, basically you have one male on one foot,</p>
<p>another male on another foot, another male on an arm,</p>
<p>another male on another arm.</p>
<p>Now you have an immobilized victim</p>
<p>with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.</p>
<p>And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax</p>
<p>and tear off his testicles</p>
<p>and twist an arm until it breaks</p>
<p>and do this appalling damage with no weapons.</p>
<p>What is the way in which they prefer to commit the violence?</p>
<p>Is there something to be said</p>
<p>about the actual process of it?</p>
<p>Is there an artistry to it?</p>
<p>So if you look at human warfare,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different parts in history</p>
<p>prefer different kind of approaches to violence.</p>
<p>It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side.</p>
<p>But just the nature of violence itself,</p>
<p>sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,</p>
<p>is it basically the same?</p>
<p>You improvise, you immobilize the victim,</p>
<p>and they just rip off different parts</p>
<p>of their body kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to understand</p>
<p>that these things are happening at high speed</p>
<p>in thick vegetation, mostly,</p>
<p>so that they have not been filmed carefully.</p>
<p>We have a few little glimpses of them</p>
<p>from one or two people like David Watts,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got some great video,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know enough to be able to say that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine that there are styles</p>
<p>that vary between communities, cultural styles,</p>
<p>but it is possible.</p>
<p>It is possible, and one thing that is striking</p>
<p>is that the number of times that an individual victim</p>
<p>has been killed immediately has been higher</p>
<p>in Kibale forest in Uganda</p>
<p>than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceivable that&rsquo;s just chance.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have real numbers now, but what is this?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the exact numbers,</p>
<p>but 10 versus 15 or something.</p>
<p>So maybe they damaged to the point</p>
<p>of expecting a death in one place</p>
<p>and they just finished it off in the other,</p>
<p>but most likely that sort of difference</p>
<p>will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.</p>
<p>You know, human beings are able to conceive</p>
<p>of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.</p>
<p>Is there any of that for chimps</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re thinking about violence?</p>
<p>Is violence, like what is the nature</p>
<p>of their conception of violence, do you think?</p>
<p>Do they realize they&rsquo;re taking another conscious being&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>or is it some kind of like optimization</p>
<p>over the use of resources or something like that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s, I can&rsquo;t think of any way</p>
<p>to get an answer to the question</p>
<p>of what they know about that.</p>
<p>I think that the way to think about the motivation</p>
<p>is rather like the motivation in sex.</p>
<p>So when males are interested in having sex with a female,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in chimpanzees or in humans,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t think about the fact</p>
<p>that what this is going to do is to lead to a baby, mostly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Mostly what they&rsquo;re thinking about is,</p>
<p>I wanna get my end away.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s a similar kind of process</p>
<p>with the chimps.</p>
<p>What they are thinking about is,</p>
<p>I wanna kill this individual.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that taking</p>
<p>the other individual&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>and thinking about what it means for them to die</p>
<p>is gonna be an important part of that.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s reasons to think</p>
<p>it should not be an important part of it</p>
<p>because it might inhibit them</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want to be inhibited.</p>
<p>The more efficient they are in doing this, the better.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s interesting to think about</p>
<p>this whole motivational question</p>
<p>because it does produce this rather haunting thought</p>
<p>that there has been selection</p>
<p>in favor of enthusiasm about killing.</p>
<p>And in our relatively gentle</p>
<p>and deliberately moral society that we have today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult for us to face the thought</p>
<p>that in all of us,</p>
<p>there might&rsquo;ve been residue</p>
<p>and more than that, sort of an active potential</p>
<p>for that thought of really enjoying killing someone else.</p>
<p>But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously</p>
<p>by thinking of circumstances in which it would be true</p>
<p>that the ordinary human male would be delighted</p>
<p>to be part of a group that was killing someone.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ve got to do is to be in a position</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re regarding the victim</p>
<p>as dangerous and thoroughly hostile.</p>
<p>But the pure enjoyment of violence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if you know this historian,</p>
<p>Dan Carlin, he has a podcast.</p>
<p>He has an episode, three, four hour episode</p>
<p>that I recommend to others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite haunting.</p>
<p>But he takes us through an entire history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called painfotainment.</p>
<p>The history of humans</p>
<p>enjoying the murder of others in a large group.</p>
<p>So like public executions were long part of human history.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something that for some reason,</p>
<p>humans seem to have been drawn to just watching others die.</p>
<p>And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.</p>
<p>For example, he said if it was possible to televise,</p>
<p>to stream online for example,</p>
<p>the execution and the murder of somebody</p>
<p>or even the torture of somebody,</p>
<p>that a very large fraction of the population on earth</p>
<p>would not be able to look away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be drawn to that somehow.</p>
<p>As a very dark thought that we were drawn to that.</p>
<p>So you think that&rsquo;s part of us in there somewhere.</p>
<p>That selection that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing</p>
<p>and the enjoyment of observing</p>
<p>those in our tribe doing the killing.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, and that word you produced at the end</p>
<p>is critical I think.</p>
<p>Because it would be a little bit weird I think</p>
<p>to imagine a lot of enjoyment about people</p>
<p>in your own tribe being killed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re interested in violence</p>
<p>for violence&rsquo;s sake that much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you get these social boundaries set up.</p>
<p>And in today&rsquo;s world, happily,</p>
<p>we kind of are already one world.</p>
<p>You have to dehumanize someone to get to the point</p>
<p>where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe</p>
<p>at some level, which is the whole human species.</p>
<p>But in ancient times, that would not have been true.</p>
<p>Because in ancient times,</p>
<p>there are lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers</p>
<p>in which the appearance of a stranger</p>
<p>would lead to an immediate response of shooting on sight.</p>
<p>Because what was human was the people</p>
<p>that were in your society.</p>
<p>And the other things that actually looked like us</p>
<p>and were human in that sense, were not regarded as human.</p>
<p>So there was a kind of automatic dehumanization</p>
<p>of everybody that didn&rsquo;t speak our language</p>
<p>or hadn&rsquo;t already somehow become recognized</p>
<p>as sufficiently like us to escape</p>
<p>the dehumanization contact.</p>
<p>And so hopefully the story of human history</p>
<p>is that tribalism fades away,</p>
<p>that our dehumanization, the natural desire to dehumanize</p>
<p>or tendency to dehumanize groups</p>
<p>that are not within this tribe, decreases over time.</p>
<p>And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s the optimistic perspective.</p>
<p>And the great sort of concern, of course,</p>
<p>is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts</p>
<p>and then dehumanization happens</p>
<p>and then violence is released.</p>
<p>As Hannah Arendt says,</p>
<p>there currently is no known alternative to war</p>
<p>as a means of settling really important conflicts.</p>
<p>So if we look at the big picture,</p>
<p>what role has violence or do you think violence</p>
<p>has played in the evolution of Homo sapiens?</p>
<p>So we are quite an intelligent, quite a beautiful,</p>
<p>particular little branch on the evolutionary tree.</p>
<p>What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?</p>
<p>Well, I think that violence was responsible</p>
<p>for creating your Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>And that raises the question of what Homo sapiens is.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So nowadays people begin the concept</p>
<p>of what Homo sapiens is by thinking about features</p>
<p>that are very obviously different</p>
<p>from all of the other species of Homo.</p>
<p>And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,</p>
<p>our relatively small face, these are characteristics</p>
<p>which are developed in a relatively modern way</p>
<p>by about 170,000 years ago.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the earliest skulls in Africa</p>
<p>that really captures that.</p>
<p>But it has been argued that that is an episode</p>
<p>in a process that has been started substantially earlier.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no doubt that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing</p>
<p>pretty continuously throughout the length of time it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it goes back to 300,000 years ago,</p>
<p>315 literally is the time, the best estimate of a date</p>
<p>for a series of bones from Morocco</p>
<p>that have been dated three or four years ago at that time</p>
<p>and have been characterized as earliest Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>Now at that point, they are only beginning</p>
<p>the trend of sapionization.</p>
<p>And that trend consists basically of gracilization</p>
<p>of making our ancestors less robust,</p>
<p>shorter faces, smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,</p>
<p>narrower face, thinner cranium,</p>
<p>all these things that are associated with reduced violence.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s saying what,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Homo sapiens beginning.</p>
<p>So it began sometime three to 400,000 years ago</p>
<p>because by 315,000 years ago,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already got something recognizable.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re more on that side of things</p>
<p>that those are this gradual process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 150, 170,000 years ago.</p>
<p>It started like 400,000 years ago and it&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>It started three to 400,000 years ago</p>
<p>and if you look at 170, it&rsquo;s got even more like us.</p>
<p>And then if you look at 100, it&rsquo;s got more like us again.</p>
<p>And if you look at 50, it&rsquo;s more like us again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the way, it&rsquo;s just getting</p>
<p>more and more like the moderns.</p>
<p>So the question is what happened</p>
<p>between three and 400,000 years ago</p>
<p>to produce Homo sapiens?</p>
<p>And I think we have a pretty good answer now.</p>
<p>And the answer comes from violence.</p>
<p>And the story begins by focusing on this question.</p>
<p>Why is it that in the human species,</p>
<p>we are unique among all primates</p>
<p>in not having an alpha male in any group</p>
<p>in the sense that what we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>is an alpha male who personally beats up every other male?</p>
<p>And the answer that has been portrayed most richly</p>
<p>by Christopher Boehm and whose work I&rsquo;ve elaborated on</p>
<p>is that only in humans do you have a system</p>
<p>by which any male who tries to bully others</p>
<p>and become the alpha equivalent to an alpha gorilla</p>
<p>or an alpha chimpanzee or an alpha bonobo</p>
<p>or an alpha baboon or anything like that,</p>
<p>any male who tries to do that in humans</p>
<p>gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.</p>
<p>That coalition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good picture of human society, yes.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Okay, and that&rsquo;s the way all our societies work now.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because individuals try and be alpha</p>
<p>and then they get taken out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we don&rsquo;t usually think of ourselves</p>
<p>as beta males, but yes, I suppose that&rsquo;s what democracy is.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way we think of ourselves.</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s what democracy is.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, so at some point alpha males get taken out.</p>
<p>Well, what alpha males are are males</p>
<p>who respond with high reactive violence</p>
<p>to any challenge to their status.</p>
<p>You see it all the time in primates.</p>
<p>Some beta male thinks he&rsquo;s getting strong</p>
<p>and maturing in wisdom and so on,</p>
<p>and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male.</p>
<p>And the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.</p>
<p>Or maybe he&rsquo;ll just wait for a few minutes</p>
<p>and then take an opportunity to attack him.</p>
<p>All of these primates have got a high tendency</p>
<p>for reactive aggression,</p>
<p>and that enables the possibility of alpha males.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We have this great reduction, as I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And the question is, when did that reduction happen?</p>
<p>Well, cut to the famous experiments</p>
<p>by the Russian biologist Dmitry Belyaev,</p>
<p>who tried domesticating wild animals.</p>
<p>When you domesticate wild animals,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is reducing reactive aggression.</p>
<p>You are selecting those individuals to breed</p>
<p>who are most willing to be approached by a human</p>
<p>or by another member of their own species</p>
<p>and are least likely to erupt in reactive aggression.</p>
<p>And you only have to do that for a few generations</p>
<p>to discover that there are changes in the skull.</p>
<p>And those changes consist of shorter face, smaller teeth,</p>
<p>reduced maleness,</p>
<p>the males become increasingly female like,</p>
<p>and reduced brain size.</p>
<p>Well, the changes that are characteristic</p>
<p>of domesticated animals in general</p>
<p>compared to wild animals are all found in Homo sapiens</p>
<p>compared to our early ancestors.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very strong signal</p>
<p>that when we first see Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re seeing is that there&rsquo;s a lot of change</p>
<p>in the shape of the animal.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing is evidence</p>
<p>of a reduction in reactive aggression.</p>
<p>And that suggests that what&rsquo;s happening with Homo sapiens</p>
<p>is that that is the point</p>
<p>at which there is selection against the alpha males.</p>
<p>And therefore, the way in which the selection happened</p>
<p>would have been the way it happens today.</p>
<p>The beta males take them out.</p>
<p>So I think that Homo sapiens is a species</p>
<p>characterized by the suppression of reactive aggression</p>
<p>as a kind of incidental consequence</p>
<p>of the suppression of the alpha male.</p>
<p>And the story of our species</p>
<p>is the story of how the beta males took charge</p>
<p>and have been responsible for the generation</p>
<p>of a new kind of human.</p>
<p>And incidentally, for imposing on the society</p>
<p>a new set of values.</p>
<p>Because when those beta males discovered</p>
<p>that they could take out the previous alpha male</p>
<p>and continue to do so,</p>
<p>because in every generation there&rsquo;ll always be some male</p>
<p>who says, maybe I&rsquo;ll become the alpha male.</p>
<p>So they just keep chopping them down.</p>
<p>In discovering that, they also obviously discovered</p>
<p>that they could kill anybody in the group.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Females, young males, anybody who didn&rsquo;t follow their values.</p>
<p>And so this story is one in which the males of our species,</p>
<p>and these would be the breeding males,</p>
<p>have been able to impose their values on everybody else.</p>
<p>And there is two kind of values.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one kind of value is things</p>
<p>that are good for the group.</p>
<p>Like, thou shalt not murder.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>And the other kind of value is things</p>
<p>that are good for the males.</p>
<p>Such as, hey, guess what?</p>
<p>When good food comes in, males get it first.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating that that kind of set of ideals</p>
<p>could outcompete the others.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of why,</p>
<p>or maybe you can comment on Neanderthals</p>
<p>and all the other early humans.</p>
<p>Why did Homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish</p>
<p>and all the other ones,</p>
<p>all the other branches of evolution died out?</p>
<p>Or got murdered out.</p>
<p>I mean, nowadays, when Homo sapiens meets Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know each other initially,</p>
<p>then conflict breaks out</p>
<p>and the more militarily able group wins.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that everywhere throughout the age</p>
<p>of exploration and throughout history.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m rather surprised.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom that you see nowadays</p>
<p>in contemporary anthropology is very reluctant</p>
<p>to point to success in warfare</p>
<p>as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals</p>
<p>within about 3000 years of the sapiens.</p>
<p>Coming into Europe 43,000 years ago.</p>
<p>And people are much more inclined to say,</p>
<p>well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,</p>
<p>so they just couldn&rsquo;t survive the demographic sort of sweep</p>
<p>or the disease came in.</p>
<p>And maybe those things might&rsquo;ve been important,</p>
<p>but far and away, the most obvious possibility</p>
<p>is that sapiens were just,</p>
<p>sapiens were just powerful.</p>
<p>They had, everyone agrees they had larger groups.</p>
<p>They had better weapons.</p>
<p>They had projectile weapons, bows and arrows,</p>
<p>to judge from the little microlith bits of flake,</p>
<p>which the Neanderthals didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s evidence of interbreeding,</p>
<p>quite extensive interbreeding</p>
<p>between sapiens and Neanderthals,</p>
<p>as well as with some other groups.</p>
<p>And sometimes people say, well, you know,</p>
<p>so they loved each other.</p>
<p>They made love, not war.</p>
<p>I think they made love and war.</p>
<p>And it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily mean too loving.</p>
<p>I mean, if you just follow through</p>
<p>from typical ethnographies nowadays</p>
<p>of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know each other,</p>
<p>then you can imagine that Neanderthal females</p>
<p>would essentially be captured</p>
<p>and taken into sapiens groups.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment on this cautiously and eloquently.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of sexual violence in human evolution?</p>
<p>Because you mentioned taking Neanderthal females.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also mentioned that some of these rules</p>
<p>are defined by the male side of the society.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of sexual violence in this story?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve got to distinguish</p>
<p>between groups and within groups.</p>
<p>And I think the world has been slowly waking up</p>
<p>over the last several decades</p>
<p>to the fact that sexual violence is routine in war.</p>
<p>And that to me says that it&rsquo;s just another example</p>
<p>of power corrupts because when frustrated,</p>
<p>scared, elated soldiers come upon females</p>
<p>in a group that has been essential dehumanization of,</p>
<p>then they get carried away by opportunity.</p>
<p>It is not always possible to argue</p>
<p>that this is adaptive nowadays</p>
<p>because you get lots and lots of stories</p>
<p>of women being abused to the point of being killed.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll be gang raped and then killed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of terrible cases of that reported</p>
<p>from all sorts of different wars.</p>
<p>But you can see that that could build on a pattern</p>
<p>that would have been adaptive</p>
<p>if happening under so much less extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>The war is very extreme nowadays</p>
<p>in the sense that you get battles</p>
<p>in which people are sent by a military hierarchy</p>
<p>into a war situation in which they do not feel</p>
<p>what hunters and gatherers would typically have felt,</p>
<p>which would have been that if we attack,</p>
<p>we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you&rsquo;re sent in across the Somme or whatever it is</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a very high chance you will be killed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s totally unnatural</p>
<p>and a novel evolutionary experience, I think.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s sexual coercion within groups.</p>
<p>And so that takes various kinds of forms.</p>
<p>But nowadays, of course,</p>
<p>I think people recognize increasingly</p>
<p>that the principle form of sexual intimidation</p>
<p>and rape occurs within relationships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stranger rape</p>
<p>that is really statistically important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more what happens behind the walls</p>
<p>of a bedroom where people have been living for some time.</p>
<p>And just two sort of thoughts and observations about this.</p>
<p>One is that it may seem odd</p>
<p>that males should think it a good idea, as it were,</p>
<p>to impose themselves sexually on someone</p>
<p>with whom they have a relationship.</p>
<p>But what they&rsquo;re doing is intimidating someone</p>
<p>in a relationship in which the relative power</p>
<p>in the relationship has continuing significance</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to do with domestic relationships,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to do with the man getting his own way all the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s power dynamics and the sexual aggression</p>
<p>is one of the tools to regain power,</p>
<p>gain power, gain more power and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And in that respect, it&rsquo;s worth noting</p>
<p>that although this wasn&rsquo;t appreciated for some time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s emerging that in a bunch of primates</p>
<p>you have somewhat similar, somewhat parallel</p>
<p>kinds of sexual intimidation</p>
<p>where males will target particular females,</p>
<p>even in a group in which the norm is for females</p>
<p>to mate with multiple males.</p>
<p>But each male will target a particular female</p>
<p>and the more he is aggressive towards her,</p>
<p>then the more she conforms to his wishes</p>
<p>when he wants to mate.</p>
<p>So a long term pattern of sexual intimidation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that aspect.</p>
<p>The other aspect I would just note is that</p>
<p>males get away with a lot compared to females</p>
<p>in any kind of intersexual conflict.</p>
<p>So the punishment, here&rsquo;s one example of this,</p>
<p>the punishment for a husband killing a wife</p>
<p>has always been much less than the punishment</p>
<p>for a wife killing a husband.</p>
<p>And you see similar sorts of things</p>
<p>in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.</p>
<p>I bring this up in the context of males</p>
<p>sexually intimidating their partners,</p>
<p>be it wives or whoever,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a reminder that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a patriarchal world that we have come from.</p>
<p>A patriarchal world in which male alliances</p>
<p>tend to support males and take advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that they have political power at the expense of females.</p>
<p>And I would say that that all goes back</p>
<p>to what happened three to 400,000 years ago</p>
<p>when the beta males took charge</p>
<p>and they started imposing their own norms</p>
<p>on society as a whole and they&rsquo;ve continued to do so.</p>
<p>And we now look at ourselves and Jordan Peterson says,</p>
<p>we are not a patriarchal society.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s true that the laws try and make it even handed</p>
<p>nowadays between males and females,</p>
<p>but obviously we are patriarchal de facto</p>
<p>because society still in many ways supports men</p>
<p>better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.</p>
<p>So beta male patriarchal.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re looking at the evolutionary history.</p>
<p>Okay, is there, maybe sticking on Jordan for a second,</p>
<p>is there, so he&rsquo;s a psychologist, right?</p>
<p>And what part of the picture do you think he&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>in analyzing the human relations?</p>
<p>Like what does he need to understand</p>
<p>about our origins in violence</p>
<p>and the way that society has been constructed?</p>
<p>Or I don&rsquo;t want to go deep into his missing perspectives,</p>
<p>but I just think that what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>in that particular example is focusing</p>
<p>on the legalistic position.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great that you do not find formal patriarchy</p>
<p>in the law, anything like to the extent</p>
<p>that you could find it 100 years ago and so on.</p>
<p>Women have got the vote now, hooray.</p>
<p>But it took a long time for women to get the vote.</p>
<p>And it remains the case that women suffer</p>
<p>in various kinds of ways.</p>
<p>I mean, a woman who has lots of sexual partners</p>
<p>is treated much more rudely than a male</p>
<p>who has lots of sexual partners.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of informal ways</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s rougher being a woman than it is a man.</p>
<p>And if we look at the surface layer of the law,</p>
<p>we may miss the deeper human nature,</p>
<p>like the origins of our human nature that still operates</p>
<p>no matter what the law says.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward</p>
<p>because it includes some unpleasant features</p>
<p>that when we sit back and reflect about them,</p>
<p>we would like them to go away.</p>
<p>But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned</p>
<p>to try and have sex with at least one woman,</p>
<p>and you know, often lots of women.</p>
<p>And so men are constantly putting pressure on women</p>
<p>in ways that women find unpleasant.</p>
<p>And if men sit back and reflect about it,</p>
<p>they think, yeah, we shouldn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>But actually, it just goes on because of human nature.</p>
<p>So maybe looking at particular humans in history,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>So is this particular human who was one</p>
<p>of the most famous examples of large scale violence,</p>
<p>is he a deep representative of human nature</p>
<p>or is he a rare exception?</p>
<p>Well, I think that it&rsquo;s easy to imagine</p>
<p>that most men could have become Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that he had a particular streak</p>
<p>of psychopathy.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s striking that by the time you become</p>
<p>immensely powerful, then your willingness</p>
<p>to do terrible things for the interest of yourself</p>
<p>and your group becomes very high.</p>
<p>Stalin, Mao Zedong, these sorts of people have histories</p>
<p>in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.</p>
<p>But by the time they are big leaders,</p>
<p>they are really psychopathic in the sense</p>
<p>that they do not follow the ordinary morality</p>
<p>of considering the harm that they are doing</p>
<p>to their victims.</p>
<p>What kind of experiment would we need to discover</p>
<p>whether or not anybody could fall into this position?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but Lord Acton&rsquo;s famous dictum</p>
<p>was power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>And then the point that people often forget</p>
<p>is the next sentence that he said,</p>
<p>which is, great men are almost always bad men.</p>
<p>And that is right.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to find a great man in history</p>
<p>who was not responsible for terrible things.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some aspect of it that it&rsquo;s not just power.</p>
<p>I think men who have been the most destructive</p>
<p>in human history are not psychopathic completely.</p>
<p>They have convinced themselves of an idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the idea is psychopathic.</p>
<p>Stalin, for example, Hitler&rsquo;s a complicated one.</p>
<p>I think he was legitimately insane.</p>
<p>But I think Stalin has convinced himself that he&rsquo;s doing good.</p>
<p>So the idea of communism is the thing that&rsquo;s psychopathic</p>
<p>in his mind, like it bred, you construct the worldview</p>
<p>in which the violence is justified, the cruelty is justified.</p>
<p>So there, in that sense, first of all,</p>
<p>you can construct experiments, unethical experiments</p>
<p>that could test this, but in that sense,</p>
<p>anybody else could have been in Stalin&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the idea that could overtake the mind</p>
<p>of a human being and in so doing justify cruel acts.</p>
<p>And that seems to be, at least in part, unique to humans,</p>
<p>is the ability to hold ideas in our minds</p>
<p>and share those ideas and use those ideas</p>
<p>to convince ourselves that proactive violence</p>
<p>on a large scale is a good idea.</p>
<p>So that, I don&rsquo;t know if you have a comment.</p>
<p>I suppose so, I mean, but it seems to me</p>
<p>what really motivated Stalin was not so much communism</p>
<p>as the retention of power.</p>
<p>So once he became leader and in the process</p>
<p>of becoming leader, he was absolutely desperate</p>
<p>to get rid of anybody who was a challenger.</p>
<p>He was deeply suspicious, suspicious of anybody,</p>
<p>even on his side, who might possibly be showing</p>
<p>a glimmerings of willingness to challenge him.</p>
<p>So when he apparently had Kirov murdered,</p>
<p>Kirov was a great communist, Trotsky was a great communist,</p>
<p>all his rivals, and I mean, when he went into the towns</p>
<p>and murdered people by the tenths of thousands.</p>
<p>They were all communists.</p>
<p>A lot of them were explicit communists, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But what he was worried about was that they were rivals</p>
<p>to him.</p>
<p>I suppose the thought is I am the best person</p>
<p>to bring about a global sort of embrace of communism</p>
<p>and others are not, and so we have to get rid</p>
<p>of those others.</p>
<p>Well, I suspect you&rsquo;re being very charitable here,</p>
<p>but I mean, maybe you know enough about Stalin to really.</p>
<p>Yes, well, so the point I&rsquo;m making, I do quite a bit,</p>
<p>is from my understanding and sense, of course,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t know for sure, is he believed in communism.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t purely a game of power.</p>
<p>Now, he got drunk with power pretty quickly,</p>
<p>but he really believed for, I believe his whole life,</p>
<p>that communism is good for the world.</p>
<p>And that, I don&rsquo;t know what role that belief plays</p>
<p>with the more natural human desire for power.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it just seems like.</p>
<p>As we agreed, he&rsquo;s killing a lot of communists</p>
<p>On his journey.</p>
<p>Hmm, but it&rsquo;s not, that calculus doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s humans who are communists</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the idea of communism.</p>
<p>So for him, in his delusional world view,</p>
<p>killing a few people is worth the final result</p>
<p>of bringing communism to the whole world.</p>
<p>But it was more than that, again, because I mean,</p>
<p>he really wanted power for the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and so surely the reason that he orchestrated</p>
<p>the export of wheat from Ukraine</p>
<p>and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation</p>
<p>was because he wanted to sell it on the market</p>
<p>in order to be able to build up</p>
<p>the power of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Alternative view of communism might have been,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s just make sure everybody survives</p>
<p>and make sure everybody has enough to eat</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll all be mutually supportive in a communal network.</p>
<p>But no, but he wanted the power for the country.</p>
<p>Well, I guess exactly, so that it&rsquo;s not even communism,</p>
<p>the set of ideas are like Marxism or something like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the country.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is it&rsquo;s not purely power</p>
<p>for the individual, it&rsquo;s power for a vision</p>
<p>for this great nation, the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s similar with Hitler, the guy believed</p>
<p>that this is a great nation, Germany,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a nation that&rsquo;s been wronged throughout history</p>
<p>and needs to be righted.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some dance between the individual human</p>
<p>and the tribe.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, yes, and so just like chimpanzees,</p>
<p>we are fiercely tribal and the tribalism resides</p>
<p>particularly in male psychology and it&rsquo;s very scary</p>
<p>because once you assemble a set of males</p>
<p>who share a tribal identity, then they have power</p>
<p>that they can exert with very little concern</p>
<p>about what they&rsquo;re doing to damage other people.</p>
<p>Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power,</p>
<p>we talked about the corrupting nature of power,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s a manifestation</p>
<p>of those early origins of violence?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection of this desire for power</p>
<p>and our proclivity for violence?</p>
<p>You know, what we&rsquo;re talking about is tribal power, right?</p>
<p>Power on behalf of a group.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And yeah, that seems to me to go right back</p>
<p>to a deep evolutionary origin</p>
<p>because you see essentially the same thing</p>
<p>in a whole bunch of animals.</p>
<p>That most of the sort of cognitively complex animals</p>
<p>live in social groups in which they have tribal boundaries.</p>
<p>And so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed</p>
<p>in almost all of the primates.</p>
<p>The difference between us and, you know,</p>
<p>chimpanzees and humans on the one hand</p>
<p>and other primates on the other</p>
<p>is that we kill and they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the reason they don&rsquo;t is because they never meet</p>
<p>in the context where there are massive imbalances of power.</p>
<p>So two groups of baboons, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 30 on this side and 50 on this side, fine.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s gonna try and kill anybody else</p>
<p>because the serious risks involved.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, they are tribal.</p>
<p>So, you know, they will have fairly intense</p>
<p>intergroup interactions in which everybody knows</p>
<p>who is on whose side.</p>
<p>And the longterm consequences of winning those battles,</p>
<p>nonlethal battles, is that the dominance get access</p>
<p>to larger areas of land, more safety and so on,</p>
<p>with chances are better record</p>
<p>of reproductive success subsequently.</p>
<p>Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>is a feature or a bug?</p>
<p>Our natural sort of tendency to form tribes?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a bug?</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy,</p>
<p>meaning like it would be more beneficial.</p>
<p>Is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes</p>
<p>from an evolutionary perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but, but, but.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>What does a bug mean?</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, like where&rsquo;s evolution going anyway?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beneficial from, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beneficial in the sense that it evolved</p>
<p>by natural selection to benefit the individuals who did it.</p>
<p>But if by bug you mean something that,</p>
<p>from the point of view of the species,</p>
<p>it would be great if you could just wipe this out</p>
<p>because the species would somehow do better as a result.</p>
<p>Then yes, but then, you know, males are a bug.</p>
<p>Come on now, there&rsquo;s some nice things to males,</p>
<p>speaking as a male.</p>
<p>The fact that there are some nice things to males</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re not bugs.</p>
<p>You know, maybe they&rsquo;re quite nice bugs,</p>
<p>but it would be much better for the species as a whole</p>
<p>not to have to have males who impose this violence</p>
<p>on the species as a whole.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As somebody who practiced controlled violence</p>
<p>and doing a lot of martial arts, yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>It does seem kind of fun to have this kind</p>
<p>of controlled violence, also sports.</p>
<p>Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the deeper question.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s some value to conflict</p>
<p>for the improvement of society, for progress?</p>
<p>That this tension between tribes,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this like a experiment,</p>
<p>a continued experiment we conduct with each other</p>
<p>to figure out what is a better world to build?</p>
<p>Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas</p>
<p>to go to war with each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the United States with the 50 states</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the laboratory of ideas.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think that is, again, feature versus bug?</p>
<p>This kind of conflict, when it doesn&rsquo;t get out of hand,</p>
<p>is actually ultimately progressive,</p>
<p>productive for a better world.</p>
<p>Well, what do you mean by conflict?</p>
<p>I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of</p>
<p>people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.</p>
<p>And so their ideas are in conflict.</p>
<p>They can sit down on a log and chat about it</p>
<p>and then decide, okay, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m wrong or whatever.</p>
<p>But if by conflict, you mean a great idea</p>
<p>to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,</p>
<p>then no, I don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>to have all this violence.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, I wonder, I mean, it&rsquo;s not a good idea,</p>
<p>but I wonder if human history would evolve</p>
<p>the way it did without the violence.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Probably humans would not have evolved</p>
<p>in the sense that we have.</p>
<p>But I would hope that the course of violence in evolution</p>
<p>will continue in the way it has.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s all sorts of indications</p>
<p>that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.</p>
<p>And this is made famous in Steven Pinker&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>but others have written about it too,</p>
<p>that the frequency of death from violence</p>
<p>in every country you look at,</p>
<p>has been declining, that&rsquo;s just great.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the amazing thing about this</p>
<p>is that even when you take the deaths</p>
<p>due to the First World War and the Second World War,</p>
<p>the 20th century appears to have been statistically,</p>
<p>meaning rates of death per individual,</p>
<p>the least violent in history.</p>
<p>So, we haven&rsquo;t got very far down the course</p>
<p>to nonviolence, but we&rsquo;ve got a long way to go.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t just carry on doing it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ridiculous, frankly, excuse my frankness,</p>
<p>to say that violence is a good thing.</p>
<p>I think that it would be a wonderful concept</p>
<p>if we could evolve somehow to a world</p>
<p>3,000 years from now,</p>
<p>where violence is really regarded as simply appalling,</p>
<p>and that they look back on our time</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t believe what we were doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but of course,</p>
<p>violence takes a lot of different shapes.</p>
<p>As we start to think deeper and deeper</p>
<p>about living beings on Earth,</p>
<p>for example, the violence we commit</p>
<p>and the torture we commit to animals,</p>
<p>and then perhaps down the line,</p>
<p>as we talked offline about with robots,</p>
<p>and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just so many ways to commit violence to others.</p>
<p>And some people now talk about violence</p>
<p>in the space of ideas, which of course, to me at least,</p>
<p>is a bit of a silly notion relative</p>
<p>to use that same V word for the space of ideas</p>
<p>versus actual physical violence.</p>
<p>But it may be that a long time from now,</p>
<p>we see that even violence in the space of ideas</p>
<p>is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.</p>
<p>And so it is interesting where this is headed.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>A world, a nonviolent world, does seem like a better world.</p>
<p>I wonder if the constraints on resources</p>
<p>somehow make that world more and more difficult,</p>
<p>especially as we run out of resources.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s got to be very, very different</p>
<p>from what we&rsquo;re doing nowadays.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unimaginably different.</p>
<p>If we could imagine it,</p>
<p>then maybe we could work towards it.</p>
<p>At the moment, nobody knows how to work towards it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s kind of the stories of humans</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t really know the future.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to ad hoc kind of develop it as we go</p>
<p>and sometimes get into trouble.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the violence.</p>
<p>But George Orwell&rsquo;s vision in 1984</p>
<p>was of two or three world powers each so powerful</p>
<p>that nobody could destroy the other.</p>
<p>But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship</p>
<p>among heavily armed world powers</p>
<p>just does not seem as though it&rsquo;s reasonable at all.</p>
<p>That is to say, we&rsquo;ve now got 170 or 190 nations in the world</p>
<p>dominated by a few big ones,</p>
<p>all with arms pointing at each other.</p>
<p>And the notion that we could just carry on</p>
<p>having peace talks and making sure that these arms</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get involved in some kind of massive conflagration</p>
<p>seems incredibly optimistic.</p>
<p>Some kind of major change has to happen whereby,</p>
<p>and some people would like to see all the weapons go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a member of that sort of group</p>
<p>that tries to see that happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be very difficult to see it happen.</p>
<p>Another kind of concept is the nations themselves</p>
<p>will dissolve and will become one government.</p>
<p>That itself is a terrifying vision</p>
<p>because the capacity for abuse by a single world power</p>
<p>would be so problematic.</p>
<p>And in addition, how do you get there</p>
<p>without a war in the first place?</p>
<p>So at the moment, we have no reasonable kind of future</p>
<p>in mind, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s there somewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we haven&rsquo;t yet to find it.</p>
<p>And a lot of people like in the cryptocurrency space</p>
<p>argue that you can create decentralized societies</p>
<p>if you take away the power from states</p>
<p>to define the monetary system.</p>
<p>So they argue like if you make the monetary system</p>
<p>such that it&rsquo;s disjoint from the control</p>
<p>of any one individual, any one government,</p>
<p>then that might be a way to form</p>
<p>sort of ad hoc decentralized societies.</p>
<p>They just pop up all over the place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting technological solution</p>
<p>to how to remove the overreach of power from governments.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And it may well be that the future will emerge</p>
<p>out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.</p>
<p>Is it nevertheless surprising to you</p>
<p>that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>So the mutually assured destruction</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had for many decades</p>
<p>from somebody who studies violence,</p>
<p>how does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m surprised only in the sense</p>
<p>that accidental, the fact that we have not had an accident</p>
<p>yet has been quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Yeah, because all the accounts are</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve come very close to having very serious accidents</p>
<p>where people on either side have misread intentions</p>
<p>or apparent launches and so on.</p>
<p>So yes, I think it is remarkable.</p>
<p>There is a nasty generalization that can be made</p>
<p>that the longer that powerful states go without having wars</p>
<p>than the worst the war is afterwards.</p>
<p>And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense</p>
<p>because basically what&rsquo;s happening with these tribal groups</p>
<p>that the nations are at the moment</p>
<p>is that after a big war like the Second World War,</p>
<p>they establish new kinds of dominance relationships.</p>
<p>And then during the periods of peace,</p>
<p>what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships</p>
<p>change because some nations become poorer,</p>
<p>some become richer,</p>
<p>some become more militarily powerful and so on.</p>
<p>Generally, economy and military goes hand in hand.</p>
<p>So right now, China emerged from the war</p>
<p>as a relatively low status state and is now high status.</p>
<p>So if this were chimpanzees, what would happen</p>
<p>is that you would predict a conflict</p>
<p>because you need to have a readjustment</p>
<p>of the formal dominance relationships</p>
<p>to recognize the new in practice dominance relationships</p>
<p>recognized by the economy and the military.</p>
<p>So the longer that you have of a period of peace</p>
<p>following a war, then the more these tensions</p>
<p>of unresolved changed dominance relationships build up.</p>
<p>And the longer they take to occur,</p>
<p>then the more challenging are gonna be the conflicts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrifying view</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve been out of conflict for quite a bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Maybe it&rsquo;s building up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a scary view.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, things have changed hugely</p>
<p>with the advent of nuclear weapons</p>
<p>because at least that conforms to this psychology</p>
<p>that is very clear in other animals,</p>
<p>which is you don&rsquo;t want to get into a fight</p>
<p>if you are going to get hurt.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the whole principle of MAD,</p>
<p>Mutual Assured Destruction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s doubtless been why powerful nations</p>
<p>like America and Russia have not used their nuclear weapons</p>
<p>since 1945.</p>
<p>So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches,</p>
<p>then maybe the fact of MAD does fit into human psychology</p>
<p>in a way that means that we really will resolve our tensions</p>
<p>without using them.</p>
<p>But we haven&rsquo;t yet really faced that challenge.</p>
<p>I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed</p>
<p>because of the poor economy,</p>
<p>but with China desperate to take back Taiwan</p>
<p>and America shifting its focus on the Pacific,</p>
<p>the potential for something going wrong</p>
<p>is clearly very high.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the hopeful case that you can make</p>
<p>for a long term surviving and thriving human civilization</p>
<p>given all the dangers that we face?</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t really exactly make one.</p>
<p>I would just say that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the dangers,</p>
<p>obviously the dangers are there.</p>
<p>But what I would sort of think about</p>
<p>is the notion that surprises come from all sorts</p>
<p>of different directions.</p>
<p>And I mean, you work in robotics</p>
<p>and I can well imagine that you have a lot of experience</p>
<p>and imagine that there will be advances in robotics</p>
<p>that in some way I can&rsquo;t even conceive</p>
<p>will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.</p>
<p>Something about by the time chips have been planted</p>
<p>in human brains and we&rsquo;re all instantly sharing information</p>
<p>in a way that we never did before,</p>
<p>will this change the nature of human existence</p>
<p>in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?</p>
<p>So remove the conflicts, but keep some of the magic,</p>
<p>the beauty of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>So like still be able to enjoy life, the richness of life,</p>
<p>the full complexity of life.</p>
<p>Cause you can remove conflict by giving everybody a pill</p>
<p>and then they go to sleep, right?</p>
<p>You still want life to be amazing, exciting, interesting.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where you have to find the balance.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, yes, I mean, it&rsquo;s all science fiction stuff.</p>
<p>And so how it&rsquo;s gonna work out, totally unclear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any worry about the magic of life disappearing.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.</p>
<p>I think you really need to get rid of males</p>
<p>cause males are the source of a major problem,</p>
<p>which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think the males are also source of beauty</p>
<p>and creation?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I don&rsquo;t have anything against males</p>
<p>as individuals and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And males have clearly done a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve been incredibly exploratory and creative</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;ve done in art and music has been wonderful</p>
<p>and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s anything particularly special.</p>
<p>And I think that probably females could do the same thing</p>
<p>just as well when given the chance.</p>
<p>Yes, including the dark stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, a partial part of me is not understanding the,</p>
<p>so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women,</p>
<p>but I tend to believe both men and women,</p>
<p>if you look out into the future, can be destructive,</p>
<p>can be evil, can be greedy, can be corrupted by power.</p>
<p>So if you move males from the picture,</p>
<p>which are historically connected to this evolution</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about, that women are gonna fill</p>
<p>that role quite nicely.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;ll be just the same kind of process.</p>
<p>Not the same, but it&rsquo;ll be new and interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense that the will to power, craving power,</p>
<p>committing violence is somehow coupled</p>
<p>with all of the things that are beautiful about life.</p>
<p>That if you remove conflict completely,</p>
<p>if you remove all of the evil in the world,</p>
<p>it seems like you&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to have a stable place</p>
<p>for the beauty, for the goodness.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s always has to be a dragon to fight for the way.</p>
<p>If you look at human history, now you can say,</p>
<p>the reason I&rsquo;m nervous about a sort of utopia</p>
<p>where everything is great is every time you look</p>
<p>through human history when utopia has been chased,</p>
<p>you run into a lot of trouble or again,</p>
<p>sneaks into this evil, this craving for power.</p>
<p>Now you could say that&rsquo;s a male problem,</p>
<p>but I just think it&rsquo;s a human problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even a human problem, it&rsquo;s a chimp problem too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s life on earth problem,</p>
<p>intelligent life on earth problem.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s better to not necessarily get rid</p>
<p>of the sources of the darker sides of human nature,</p>
<p>but more create mechanisms that the kindness,</p>
<p>the goodness as the goodness paradox, your book,</p>
<p>that that is incentivized and encouraged, empowered.</p>
<p>Well, look, I don&rsquo;t think it would be utopia</p>
<p>if you got rid of the males.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And certainly females are capable of conflict.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a gamble worth taking</p>
<p>if you could actually do it.</p>
<p>You can certainly find females in history</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve done unpleasant things, but nevertheless,</p>
<p>we have a very strong evolutionary theory</p>
<p>which explains why males benefit more</p>
<p>by having conflict and winning conflicts than females do.</p>
<p>And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict,</p>
<p>then it would reduce it to get rid of males.</p>
<p>Now I understand this is a fantasy,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a fantasy that people would be able</p>
<p>to talk about fairly soon because reproductive technology</p>
<p>is getting to the point where it&rsquo;s quite likely</p>
<p>that human females could breed without the use of males.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>And so there would be a sort of a potential dynamic</p>
<p>if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting thought experiment.</p>
<p>I will agree with you that if given two buttons,</p>
<p>one is get rid of all women,</p>
<p>and the other button is get rid of all men,</p>
<p>realizing that I have a stake in this choice,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably getting rid of all men</p>
<p>if I wanted to preserve earth</p>
<p>and the richness of life on earth,</p>
<p>I would probably get rid of all men.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have a stake in it.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you&rsquo;re saying that because you&rsquo;re a man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see why being a man should make you</p>
<p>any more interested in having a male future for the world</p>
<p>than a female future.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got just as many ancestors</p>
<p>who were male as were female.</p>
<p>Well, my problem is I&rsquo;ll have to die.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s gonna happen anyway.</p>
<p>I know, but like, I prefer to die tomorrow, not today.</p>
<p>You know, I prefer to hit the snooze button</p>
<p>on the whole mortality thing, but it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But this is not suggesting that males have to die</p>
<p>in order to make room for females.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, all you have to do is just say,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have any more males born.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Of course, you know, the difficulty is that</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re tribal, you know, some country somewhere</p>
<p>would say, well, we&rsquo;re not gonna do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then guess what?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d take over, you know, because they&rsquo;re male.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s impossible to imagine actually happening.</p>
<p>You know what, I&rsquo;m gonna take that</p>
<p>and actually think about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m uncomfortable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain kind of woke culture</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been kind of uncomfortable with</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not women necessarily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more just, there&rsquo;s a lot of bullying I see.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness</p>
<p>towards others that&rsquo;s created by that culture.</p>
<p>So, but you&rsquo;re speaking about something else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re speaking about reducing conflict in this world</p>
<p>and looking at the basics of our human nature</p>
<p>and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens</p>
<p>and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature</p>
<p>if we get rid of them will make for a better world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment worth thinking about.</p>
<p>But it is only a thought experiment.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s got no practical meaning right now.</p>
<p>And I take your point that, you know,</p>
<p>males get a hard rap nowadays in some ways</p>
<p>because the balance of social power</p>
<p>is moving against,</p>
<p>I mean, you know, quite rightly</p>
<p>and in a strong sense, of course,</p>
<p>against all the nasty things that males do.</p>
<p>But what people sometimes fail to remember</p>
<p>is that life is very hard for males</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have the power,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have money,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have access to women.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m sympathetic to incels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sympathetic to them using violence</p>
<p>to solve their problems.</p>
<p>But I am very sympathetic to the fact that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy simply to be told by</p>
<p>well off, feminist, middle class people</p>
<p>that you shouldn&rsquo;t behave like this</p>
<p>or you shouldn&rsquo;t feel like this because you do.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s who you are.</p>
<p>I mean, in general, just empathy and kindness,</p>
<p>male or female,</p>
<p>I believe will be the thing that builds a better world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s practiced in different ways</p>
<p>from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>But ultimately, you should listen to others</p>
<p>and empathize with the experience of others</p>
<p>and put more love out there in the world.</p>
<p>Now, that hopefully is the way to reduce conflict,</p>
<p>reduce violence,</p>
<p>and reduce that whole psychological experience</p>
<p>of being powerless in this world,</p>
<p>powerless to become the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>And that, you know.</p>
<p>Well, no one&rsquo;s gonna disagree</p>
<p>with all those fine sentiments, right?</p>
<p>But that, yes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an actionable thing</p>
<p>is actually practice empathy, right?</p>
<p>Like saying that somebody should be silenced</p>
<p>or just like this group is bad and this group is good.</p>
<p>I just feel like that&rsquo;s not empathy.</p>
<p>Empathy is understanding the experience of others</p>
<p>and like respecting it.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, that&rsquo;s what a better world looks like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the reduction of conflict looks like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, as opposed to saying my tribe is right,</p>
<p>your tribe is wrong.</p>
<p>Forget the violence and nonviolence part.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just that act of saying my tribe is right,</p>
<p>that tribe is wrong.</p>
<p>Removing that from the picture,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way to make a better world.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the way to reduce the violence, I think.</p>
<p>Not necessarily removing the people</p>
<p>who are causing the violence.</p>
<p>You have to get to the source of the problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean the evolutionary source,</p>
<p>but just the mindset that creates the violence</p>
<p>is usually just the lack of empathy for others.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you know, I mean, you can&rsquo;t just teach that</p>
<p>because our evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>puts us in particular directions.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think, do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to learn through practice to resist the basics</p>
<p>of our evolutionary psychology, the basic forces?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, lots and lots of training.</p>
<p>Lots and lots of education can do it.</p>
<p>The famously most peaceful society</p>
<p>that anthropologists have recorded</p>
<p>involves tremendous amount of teaching,</p>
<p>including some punishment.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a society in Thailand.</p>
<p>You have to beat it out of children to make them nice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s carrot and steak.</p>
<p>You know, the point is that you do not find societies</p>
<p>in which people are spontaneously</p>
<p>showing the kinds of behaviors</p>
<p>that we would all love them to show.</p>
<p>It requires work.</p>
<p>What is your book titled, Goodness Paradox?</p>
<p>What are the main ideas in this book?</p>
<p>Well, the paradox is the fact that humans show extremes</p>
<p>in relationship to both violence and nonviolence.</p>
<p>And the violence is that we are one of these few animals</p>
<p>in which we use coalitionary proactive violence</p>
<p>to kill members of our own species.</p>
<p>And we do it in large numbers,</p>
<p>just like a few other species.</p>
<p>And the nonviolence is we&rsquo;re particularly extreme</p>
<p>in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.</p>
<p>And I told you the story of how we get there.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s so extraordinary about it is that</p>
<p>most animals are either high on both</p>
<p>or relatively low on both.</p>
<p>So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence</p>
<p>and reactive violence.</p>
<p>Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those,</p>
<p>but still hundreds of times more</p>
<p>reactively aggressive than humans are.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve done is retain proactive violence being high</p>
<p>and got reactive violence really being low.</p>
<p>And so we have these wonderful societies</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;re all so incredibly nice to each other</p>
<p>and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers</p>
<p>and have no problem about</p>
<p>leading to any kind of conflict</p>
<p>at the same time as we are one of the worst</p>
<p>killing machine species that&rsquo;s ever existed.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s so extraordinary about this is that</p>
<p>if you look at the political philosophers</p>
<p>of the last few hundred years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this fight famously between Thomas Hobbes</p>
<p>and Jean Jacques Rousseau,</p>
<p>or literally you&rsquo;ve got the fight between their followers.</p>
<p>So the followers of Hobbes say,</p>
<p>well, Hobbes was right,</p>
<p>because he says that we are naturally violent</p>
<p>and you need a Leviathan,</p>
<p>a sort of central government or a king</p>
<p>to be able to suppress the violence.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re naturally horrid</p>
<p>and we can learn to be good.</p>
<p>Whereas Jean Jacques Rousseau is interpreted</p>
<p>as saying the opposite,</p>
<p>that we are naturally good</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only when culture intervenes</p>
<p>and horrid ideologies come in</p>
<p>that we become uncivilized.</p>
<p>And so people have had this endless fight</p>
<p>between are we naturally corrupt</p>
<p>or are we naturally kind?</p>
<p>And that has gone on for years</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only in the last two or three decades</p>
<p>that anthropologists like Christopher Boehm</p>
<p>and Bruce Naft have said,</p>
<p>look, it&rsquo;s obvious what the answer is,</p>
<p>we are both of these things.</p>
<p>And what is so exciting now</p>
<p>is I think we can understand why we are both.</p>
<p>And the answer is we come from ancestors</p>
<p>that were elevated on proactive aggression,</p>
<p>that were hunters and killers,</p>
<p>both of animals and of each other.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to include that</p>
<p>as almost certain from the past.</p>
<p>And then now we&rsquo;ve taken our reactive aggression</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve down regulated it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s given us power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s given us power because</p>
<p>once you get rid of the alpha male,</p>
<p>once the beta males take over</p>
<p>and force selection in favor of a more tolerant,</p>
<p>less reactively aggressive individual,</p>
<p>the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable</p>
<p>of focusing on things other than conflict.</p>
<p>And so we have social groups</p>
<p>in which individuals, instead of constantly being on edge</p>
<p>in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,</p>
<p>are able to interact in ways that enable them to share</p>
<p>looking at a tool together or share their food together</p>
<p>or pass ideas from one to the other</p>
<p>or support each other when they&rsquo;re ill</p>
<p>or whatever the issue is.</p>
<p>Cooperate in ways that make the group far more effective.</p>
<p>So you asked earlier, what did I think about</p>
<p>why sapiens were able to expand</p>
<p>at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically</p>
<p>around 40,000 years ago?</p>
<p>And the answer is that whatever it was,</p>
<p>it had something to do</p>
<p>with the sapiens ability to cooperate.</p>
<p>That was what gave them bigger groups.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what enabled them to have</p>
<p>a far more effective way of living.</p>
<p>And I suspect it was to do with the weapons</p>
<p>and military aspects.</p>
<p>But even if it wasn&rsquo;t that,</p>
<p>the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing</p>
<p>would have been hugely important.</p>
<p>So sapiens then had groups of,</p>
<p>who knows exactly how big they were,</p>
<p>but scores of people to judge from their remains.</p>
<p>Whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated,</p>
<p>small groups of maybe as many as 15 or 20 people sometimes,</p>
<p>where they saw others so rarely</p>
<p>that they were inbreeding at high levels.</p>
<p>Fathers having babies with their daughters.</p>
<p>Very different world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably what our world was like</p>
<p>Before we got sapiens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating that there was that kind of violence</p>
<p>against, once you get rid of the alpha males,</p>
<p>you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta.</p>
<p>The beta males.</p>
<p>Not kindness, but collaboration, that&rsquo;s the better word.</p>
<p>Yes, right, much more corruption.</p>
<p>Not just among the males, among the beta males,</p>
<p>but also among the gamma males and the females.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what a gamma male is,</p>
<p>but I imagine there&rsquo;s a whole alphabet.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about a whole alphabet,</p>
<p>but I think the big layers are the married men</p>
<p>and the unmarried men.</p>
<p>Because the married men had a problem</p>
<p>with the unmarried men, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you see it in ethnographies</p>
<p>of hunters and gatherers recently,</p>
<p>where the unmarried men would be given rules,</p>
<p>such as, I mean, a very extreme rule in Northern Australia</p>
<p>was you cannot come to the camp for months.</p>
<p>You have to go away and live somewhere out in the bush.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t want you anywhere near our wives.</p>
<p>And then another kind of rule is,</p>
<p>if you are in the camp,</p>
<p>you must be in the firelight all the time.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing out in the dark.</p>
<p>You really have to control them</p>
<p>because the men who had lots of wives</p>
<p>did not want those horrid bachelors</p>
<p>sneaking around the place.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>You also wrote the book titled Catching Fire,</p>
<p>How Cooking Made Us Human.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the central idea in this book?</p>
<p>The subtitle How Cooking Made Us Human</p>
<p>refers not to Homo sapiens, but to Homo erectus.</p>
<p>So human there means the genus Homo.</p>
<p>And Homo erectus is the first full member</p>
<p>of the genus Homo in the sense that it looked like us,</p>
<p>just with a sort of slightly more robust build</p>
<p>and a smaller brain.</p>
<p>And the central idea of Catching Fire</p>
<p>is that it was the control of fire</p>
<p>that was responsible for the emergence of Homo erectus</p>
<p>and therefore the genus Homo,</p>
<p>which happened two million years ago.</p>
<p>And it was an evolution from a line of Australopithecines.</p>
<p>And Australopithecines are the creatures</p>
<p>from whom we evolved.</p>
<p>They were present in Africa</p>
<p>from something like six or seven million years ago,</p>
<p>up to actually up to one million years ago.</p>
<p>And then a branch led off to Homo</p>
<p>around two million years ago.</p>
<p>And the way to think of Australopithecines</p>
<p>is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.</p>
<p>So they were erect bipedal walkers.</p>
<p>They were like chimpanzees in the sense</p>
<p>that they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.</p>
<p>They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee,</p>
<p>a little bit smaller actually.</p>
<p>And they had big jaws</p>
<p>because they were still eating raw food.</p>
<p>They had big teeth and big jaws.</p>
<p>And then around two million years ago,</p>
<p>the line of Australopithecines,</p>
<p>which ended with an intermediate species,</p>
<p>a kind of missing link area,</p>
<p>because it is not missing, called habilis,</p>
<p>sometimes called Homo habilis,</p>
<p>but more properly, in my view,</p>
<p>called Australopithecus habilis.</p>
<p>That gave rise to Homo erectus.</p>
<p>And Homo erectus, here&rsquo;s how different it was.</p>
<p>It had a smaller mouth,</p>
<p>a smaller jaw, smaller teeth,</p>
<p>and to judge from its ribs and pelvis, smaller gut.</p>
<p>In addition, it had lost what Australopithecines all had,</p>
<p>which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.</p>
<p>And that meant that Homo erectus must have slept</p>
<p>on the ground.</p>
<p>And since it slept on the ground,</p>
<p>it should have been able to defend itself somehow</p>
<p>against predators.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t think of any way they could have done that</p>
<p>unless they had fire.</p>
<p>So there are two major clues to why it was</p>
<p>with Homo erectus that our ancestors</p>
<p>first acquired the control of fire.</p>
<p>One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees</p>
<p>in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos</p>
<p>and all the other primates do.</p>
<p>And the other is that there was this striking reduction</p>
<p>throughout the gut,</p>
<p>reduction in size of the mouth and the chewing apparatus</p>
<p>and in the gut itself.</p>
<p>And that conforms to what we have today,</p>
<p>that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans,</p>
<p>which is that our guts are about two thirds of the size</p>
<p>of what they would be if we ate raw food</p>
<p>to judge by the great apes.</p>
<p>So at some point in our evolution,</p>
<p>we acquired the skill of cooking</p>
<p>and skill of controlling fire.</p>
<p>At no time between two million years ago and the present,</p>
<p>do we see any changes in our anatomy</p>
<p>that can, as it were, justify the enormous change</p>
<p>that happens when you are an animal</p>
<p>that learns to control fire.</p>
<p>But at two million years ago,</p>
<p>we have exactly what you&rsquo;d expect,</p>
<p>namely the guts becoming smaller</p>
<p>because the food is becoming softer</p>
<p>and much more easy to digest</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to work so hard in the kitchen</p>
<p>or so hard in your body to digest it.</p>
<p>And as I say, a commitment to sleeping on the ground,</p>
<p>which I think you&rsquo;d be absolutely crazy to do nowadays</p>
<p>on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti</p>
<p>unless you had fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa</p>
<p>in the bush and you will not catch me</p>
<p>just lying on the ground in an area with lots of predators</p>
<p>unless I got a fire with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get eaten.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get terrified and you&rsquo;re gonna get eaten.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a million questions I wanna ask.</p>
<p>So one, is it very naturally coupled,</p>
<p>the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire?</p>
<p>Is that an obvious leap?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what we know.</p>
<p>We know that all the animals that we&rsquo;ve tested</p>
<p>like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.</p>
<p>So this is true for all the great apes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve tested them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating, by the way.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like a property of food, I suppose.</p>
<p>Yes, I think what it is is that animals are always looking</p>
<p>for any kind of way to get food that is easier to digest.</p>
<p>And there are various signals in the food</p>
<p>such as the amount of sugar there,</p>
<p>the amount of free amino acids</p>
<p>because the amino acids can be tasted.</p>
<p>And the physical qualities of the food</p>
<p>be particularly important, how tough the food is.</p>
<p>Always prefer softer food, provided it feels safe,</p>
<p>tastes safe.</p>
<p>And these kinds of sensory cues</p>
<p>are all there in cooked food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s soft, it doesn&rsquo;t have so many toxins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.</p>
<p>So everyone loves it spontaneously.</p>
<p>Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food to raw food.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you can say that&rsquo;s a consequence</p>
<p>of domestication, but even, as I say,</p>
<p>all of the great apes, you test naive ones</p>
<p>and they prefer it cooked if they can.</p>
<p>So then obvious, once you have fire,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to accidentally discover</p>
<p>that food changes when you apply fire to it</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s going to be the big, crazy new fad.</p>
<p>You took the words out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I mean, if they have fire at all</p>
<p>and their food rolls into it,</p>
<p>five minutes later it tastes better than it did before.</p>
<p>How big of an invention from an engineering perspective</p>
<p>do you think is the discovery of fire?</p>
<p>Do you think for homo erectus, homo sapiens,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s the greatest invention ever?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that the control of fire</p>
<p>has been ultimately responsible for essentially</p>
<p>how grandiose do I want to be here,</p>
<p>the entire human story, going back to homo.</p>
<p>It is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.</p>
<p>And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely</p>
<p>to have changed us is it reduced the difficulty</p>
<p>of making a large brain.</p>
<p>So the story here is that the constraints</p>
<p>on brain size are energetic.</p>
<p>You and I have brains that are something</p>
<p>like 2.5% of our body weight.</p>
<p>It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s disproportionate.</p>
<p>There are other expensive organs in our body as well,</p>
<p>such as the heart.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s different about the brain is that in addition</p>
<p>to us being able to fuel it in a way</p>
<p>that other animals can&rsquo;t, we also have reasons</p>
<p>for wanting to have an even bigger brain,</p>
<p>whereas we don&rsquo;t want an even bigger heart.</p>
<p>So what those reasons are is unclear.</p>
<p>But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain,</p>
<p>cooking makes it possible</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s supplying more calories</p>
<p>and it is enormously reducing the amount of time</p>
<p>that it takes to chew your food.</p>
<p>So if you were a gorilla and you wanted</p>
<p>to have a bigger brain, you might say, okay,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s just eat some more.</p>
<p>But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day</p>
<p>in the sense that they are eating</p>
<p>for maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just chewing.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ve got to sit around and digest their food</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t just eat all the time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to take a break while the food is digested</p>
<p>in the stomach and then passed into the gut.</p>
<p>So the stomach is already full.</p>
<p>So basically gorillas are eating</p>
<p>about the maximum rate already.</p>
<p>So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s actually got a smaller brain</p>
<p>relative to its body size than a chimpanzee does.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the basic problem for our ancestors.</p>
<p>Then you come along and cook and all of a sudden</p>
<p>you can get an increased amount of energy from your food.</p>
<p>You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.</p>
<p>You know, there are 25 bodily processes or more</p>
<p>that are involved in digesting your food,</p>
<p>making the acid that takes the proteins apart,</p>
<p>maintaining the brush border where the molecules</p>
<p>are taken across the gut wall and so on.</p>
<p>That all costs.</p>
<p>It costs you to digest your food.</p>
<p>It costs less if you cook your food.</p>
<p>So you get a net gain in the amount of energy</p>
<p>and you are reducing the amount of time</p>
<p>from in our case, our ancestors,</p>
<p>probably around 50% of the day chewing</p>
<p>to nowadays one hour a day chewing.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got hours a day</p>
<p>in which to do other things and to use those brains</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve now enabled to grow.</p>
<p>So with Homo erectus, you start the process</p>
<p>of getting a bigger brain and famously,</p>
<p>throughout the whole period of the evolution</p>
<p>of the genus Homo, you have a steadily increasing</p>
<p>size of brain until right at the end</p>
<p>when it actually gets smaller, but that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>Which end is this?</p>
<p>Which, are we talking about Homo sapiens?</p>
<p>Yeah, with Homo sapiens, you&rsquo;ve got a smaller brain</p>
<p>from, people haven&rsquo;t got it exactly down,</p>
<p>but at least 30,000 years ago, it starts declining.</p>
<p>And so the fascinating thing about that</p>
<p>is that all domesticated animals have smaller brains</p>
<p>than their wild ancestors.</p>
<p>And I.</p>
<p>The domestication is intricately connected</p>
<p>to this brain size, you think?</p>
<p>And exactly, so I think what we&rsquo;re seeing in humans</p>
<p>is that same manifestation.</p>
<p>And then the fascinating question is why?</p>
<p>And the only point I would want to make about this</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s no evidence that in the small brain</p>
<p>domesticates, they&rsquo;re losing say an average</p>
<p>about 15% of brain size.</p>
<p>In the small brain domesticates compared</p>
<p>to their wild ancestors, there&rsquo;s no indication</p>
<p>of a loss of cognitive ability.</p>
<p>So I think what&rsquo;s going on is that it&rsquo;s a younger brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a more pedomorphic brain,</p>
<p>looking like the juveniles of the ancestor.</p>
<p>But just as our kids are very smart</p>
<p>and can learn amazing things compared to adults,</p>
<p>all they lack is wisdom and maturity,</p>
<p>but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the same with domesticated animals</p>
<p>compared to their wild ancestors,</p>
<p>and probably therefore with Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>say 30,000 years ago, compared to their ancestors.</p>
<p>So we have smaller brains than Neanderthals.</p>
<p>Size, Richard, isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection between fire, cooking,</p>
<p>and the eating of meat?</p>
<p>Which came first, do you think?</p>
<p>Humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat</p>
<p>or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?</p>
<p>I think that fire increased the using of meat.</p>
<p>But the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt</p>
<p>and kill meat, as do bonobos, certainly puts us in,</p>
<p>so those two species have a common ancestor with us</p>
<p>going six, seven million years ago,</p>
<p>and it was from that common ancestor</p>
<p>that you get the Australopithecine line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely therefore Australopithecines</p>
<p>were eating meat when they could get it,</p>
<p>which wouldn&rsquo;t be very often</p>
<p>because they wouldn&rsquo;t be very good sprinters.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, they would occasionally be able</p>
<p>to get some meat, and I bet they loved it all the time,</p>
<p>and basically all primates like meat</p>
<p>if they can get it, almost all of them.</p>
<p>But I think fire would have been very important</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One is that once you eat your food cooked,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re saving yourself time.</p>
<p>By saving yourself time, you can free up</p>
<p>the opportunity to go and hunt more.</p>
<p>Because hunting is a high risk, high gain activity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s every risk that you will get nothing</p>
<p>on one particular afternoon that you go off</p>
<p>looking for opportunities to kill.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s high gain because when you do get something,</p>
<p>you bring down a kudu,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got a serious amount of meat.</p>
<p>What did males and females do</p>
<p>with the time they were saving</p>
<p>from not having to chew their food?</p>
<p>I think that in the case of males,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very reasonable to think they spent</p>
<p>a greatly increased amount of time hunting.</p>
<p>So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month,</p>
<p>and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.</p>
<p>With humans, they&rsquo;re hunting maybe 20 times a month,</p>
<p>and the average hunt length is six hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge difference.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s possible because the time was available,</p>
<p>because they were cooking.</p>
<p>Less chewing, more hunting.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.</p>
<p>So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,</p>
<p>and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so excited about going into the hunt,</p>
<p>and when they make the kill,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s screams everywhere,</p>
<p>and some don&rsquo;t like to seize it and capture it</p>
<p>and take it away from the others,</p>
<p>and eventually the strongest one has it,</p>
<p>and the others sit around begging</p>
<p>and trying to get some and tear it off,</p>
<p>and so they all love it.</p>
<p>There are others who, he often goes to the top of a tree</p>
<p>in order to be able to get away</p>
<p>from all of these beggars and scavengers,</p>
<p>and while he&rsquo;s there, drops of blood</p>
<p>or little scraps will fall down to the bottom,</p>
<p>and the junior members of society,</p>
<p>you know, the females and young and that sort of thing,</p>
<p>they are racing through to find a particular leaf</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got a drop of blood on it so they can lick it.</p>
<p>I mean, they love it, but it takes them a lot of time</p>
<p>to chew it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the same thing as for cooked food in general.</p>
<p>So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies,</p>
<p>and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had enough of this, I need real food,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again</p>
<p>because they can get fruit into their bodies</p>
<p>so much faster than they can get meat.</p>
<p>So once they&rsquo;re cooking, that problem is solved,</p>
<p>and they can eat the meat much more readily.</p>
<p>So I think that meat eating would become important</p>
<p>for two reasons with cooking.</p>
<p>So the key, not to oversimplify,</p>
<p>but the key moments in human history</p>
<p>are with Homo erectus, the discovery of fire</p>
<p>and the use of fire for cooking,</p>
<p>and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males</p>
<p>killing off the alpha males so that the cooperation</p>
<p>can exist, and cooperation leads to communication</p>
<p>and language and ideas, the sharing of ideas,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that</p>
<p>is that you have to ask, how is it that the beta males</p>
<p>were able to kill the alpha male?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males</p>
<p>within their own group sometimes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a process of killing the alpha male.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking advantage of opportunity</p>
<p>when some male gets into a bad position,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.</p>
<p>And you can see why, because they don&rsquo;t have language,</p>
<p>and without language, it&rsquo;s very difficult to know</p>
<p>how confident you can be of the support of others</p>
<p>against a particular individual within your own group.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re attacking someone from another group,</p>
<p>that problem is solved.</p>
<p>We all hate those guys, but the alpha male</p>
<p>has got alliances within his group.</p>
<p>Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.</p>
<p>Some of them might be harboring deep feelings</p>
<p>of resentment, but how does anyone else know that?</p>
<p>So in other words, I think that you have to have</p>
<p>some kind of language that is pretty good</p>
<p>to solve the problems of gaining confidence</p>
<p>that five of you say, or some number,</p>
<p>can trust each other in this final attack.</p>
<p>And even nowadays, it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, you mentioned Stalin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why was everybody terrified?</p>
<p>Any dictator that takes control.</p>
<p>Why is all of us as individuals terrified</p>
<p>when you know there&rsquo;s millions of us?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so like that, we lack the language,</p>
<p>because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.</p>
<p>Like, who can we talk to?</p>
<p>Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?</p>
<p>Exactly, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But do you have this intuition that some kind of language</p>
<p>was developing along with this process</p>
<p>of beta males taking over?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I mean, once you have sufficient language</p>
<p>to be able to have the beta males conspiring</p>
<p>to kill the alpha male, then you have selection</p>
<p>in favor of cooperation and tolerance, as we spoke about.</p>
<p>And at that point, there will be increased ability</p>
<p>to communicate and the language will get richer</p>
<p>and better and better.</p>
<p>So yes, absolutely, positive feedback loop</p>
<p>once you get the situation started.</p>
<p>Can you maybe comment on the full complexity</p>
<p>and richness of the human mind through this process?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been casually saying cooking, fire,</p>
<p>and beta males leading to cooperation.</p>
<p>But how does the beauty of the human mind</p>
<p>emerge from all of this?</p>
<p>Is there other further steps we need to understand?</p>
<p>Or is it as simple as this language emerging</p>
<p>from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?</p>
<p>Or am I also over romanticizing</p>
<p>how amazing the human mind is?</p>
<p>Is it just like one small step</p>
<p>in a long journey of evolution?</p>
<p>Well, if the beauty of the human mind</p>
<p>is the ability of us all to be creative, to explore,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one kind of beauty.</p>
<p>Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.</p>
<p>And we think of that as beautiful</p>
<p>because it is a kind of rare and special ability</p>
<p>compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness</p>
<p>that can commonly predominate.</p>
<p>I suppose we have to think of different sources</p>
<p>for those two types.</p>
<p>I suppose a general answer is that</p>
<p>there has been selection in favor of bigger brains,</p>
<p>which probably in general has been associated</p>
<p>with increasing cognitive ability.</p>
<p>And as that has happened,</p>
<p>the complexity of life has increased</p>
<p>because people have more and more complex,</p>
<p>highly differentiated strategies</p>
<p>in response to each other&rsquo;s more complex,</p>
<p>highly differentiated strategies.</p>
<p>We get to a point where there is deception</p>
<p>and self deception.</p>
<p>There is a manipulation of ideas</p>
<p>through stories that we invent and stories that we pass on.</p>
<p>I guess all I&rsquo;m wanting to say is that</p>
<p>there is a world of the mind that evolves in response</p>
<p>to these platforms that are put there.</p>
<p>The platform of increasing brain size</p>
<p>and therefore cognitive ability</p>
<p>made possible by increased energy supply.</p>
<p>The platform of cooperation and tolerance</p>
<p>in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict</p>
<p>and therefore a need to respond to the conflict</p>
<p>and manipulate your allies appropriately.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see beauty as coming,</p>
<p>either kind of beauty as coming</p>
<p>sort of totally independently of these things.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a selection</p>
<p>for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, but I guess sexual selection,</p>
<p>you know, males wanting to impress females</p>
<p>in different ways will lead to them wanting to.</p>
<p>Write poetry?</p>
<p>Well, yes, you know, show off.</p>
<p>Yeah, in all the different ways.</p>
<p>So all of these are natural consequences</p>
<p>of just coming up with strategies of how to cooperate</p>
<p>and how to achieve certain ends.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just like a natural.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we haven&rsquo;t spoken about sexual selection,</p>
<p>but that is a really important part of it.</p>
<p>You know, they try to out compete each other</p>
<p>in, you know, normally without any physical conflict,</p>
<p>just in order to be able to be chosen</p>
<p>by mates of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>And that is certainly a major source of creativity.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve studied chimps.</p>
<p>You also, all the other relatives, gorillas.</p>
<p>What do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps,</p>
<p>about gorillas, about humans?</p>
<p>Maybe you can paint the whole picture of that evolutionary,</p>
<p>that little local pocket of the evolutionary tree.</p>
<p>How are we related?</p>
<p>What is the common ancestor?</p>
<p>What are the interesting differences?</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m asking a million questions,</p>
<p>but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas,</p>
<p>and humans, like how we&rsquo;re related,</p>
<p>and what you find fascinating about each?</p>
<p>In Africa, straddling the equator,</p>
<p>there is a strip of rainforest</p>
<p>that relies on the combination of high temperatures</p>
<p>and rainfall that you get around the equator.</p>
<p>That rainforest goes into about 22 countries.</p>
<p>And throughout those countries, you have chimpanzees,</p>
<p>although they&rsquo;ve gone extinct in two of them.</p>
<p>In just a fraction of them,</p>
<p>but it was five countries,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got gorillas, where there are mountains.</p>
<p>And in one country, on the left bank</p>
<p>of the Great Congo River, you have bonobos.</p>
<p>So in the African forest,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got these three African apes, the only African apes,</p>
<p>all of which are very similar in much of their way of life.</p>
<p>They walk on their knuckles through the forest,</p>
<p>looking for fruit trees,</p>
<p>and eating herbs when they can&rsquo;t find fruits.</p>
<p>Gorillas represent the oldest chain.</p>
<p>So about 10 million years ago,</p>
<p>maybe as recently as eight million years ago,</p>
<p>the ancestor of gorillas broke off</p>
<p>from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve probably remained very similar now</p>
<p>to what, very similar to what they were then.</p>
<p>They were probably the largest apes,</p>
<p>living in montane areas and spending more time</p>
<p>eating just herbs, stems,</p>
<p>not so vitally dependent on fruit.</p>
<p>And living in, if it was like the present,</p>
<p>groups up to about 50 stable groups,</p>
<p>with one alpha male who was in charge.</p>
<p>Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive</p>
<p>compared to chimps and bonobos.</p>
<p>And I had the privilege of spending a week or two</p>
<p>with gorillas at Dian Fossey&rsquo;s camp before she was murdered.</p>
<p>And I went out with two women,</p>
<p>Kelly and Barb, to a particular group.</p>
<p>And there was a young female in the group called Simba.</p>
<p>And Simba approached us and stared at the two women.</p>
<p>And then she came towards me</p>
<p>and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles</p>
<p>and touched me on the forehead.</p>
<p>She was watched in doing this by a young male</p>
<p>who was quite keen on her.</p>
<p>And he was called Digit.</p>
<p>And about five minutes later,</p>
<p>Digit stood in front of us on the path.</p>
<p>And Kelly was in front of me,</p>
<p>and then there was Barb, and then there was me.</p>
<p>And he came charging down the path</p>
<p>and he sidestepped around Kelly,</p>
<p>and he sidestepped around Barb,</p>
<p>and me, he just knocked with his arm</p>
<p>and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.</p>
<p>And I love the way that that was a very deliberate response.</p>
<p>And I love the way that Simba had been so interested in me</p>
<p>and held my eye.</p>
<p>Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye,</p>
<p>but gorillas really look as though</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to sort of figure out</p>
<p>what are you thinking about?</p>
<p>That was a species that has, goes back</p>
<p>for something like 10 million years.</p>
<p>In that situation, was there a game being played?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you messing with Simba.</p>
<p>But was Simba using you?</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a fun idea.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why she should be using me,</p>
<p>but you mean to use me?</p>
<p>I see why she should be using me, but you mean testing</p>
<p>how strongly Digit was prepared to intervene to?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s come straight out of a sort of adolescent</p>
<p>high school playbook.</p>
<p>All right, well, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>No, no, no, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I never thought of that, and you never know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So, yeah, so, okay, so this is an ancient branch</p>
<p>of the evolutionary tree, this gorilla</p>
<p>that led to gorillas.</p>
<p>Gorillas.</p>
<p>So then the next thing that happened</p>
<p>on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago</p>
<p>when you have the line between chimps and bonobos</p>
<p>on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.</p>
<p>And basically what happened is that at that point,</p>
<p>a chimp like ancestor leaves the forest,</p>
<p>gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts,</p>
<p>and that becomes the Australopithecines</p>
<p>and meanwhile, the chimpanzees and bonobo ancestor</p>
<p>continues in the forest.</p>
<p>And later what happens is that one branch of that</p>
<p>crosses the Congo River and becomes the bonobos.</p>
<p>That was only about two million years ago,</p>
<p>maybe one million years ago.</p>
<p>Now the chimps that remained in the forest</p>
<p>throughout this time and occupied all the countries</p>
<p>across from west to east Africa now,</p>
<p>again, we assume that they&rsquo;re pretty similar</p>
<p>to the ones that live nowadays,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some variation from west to east.</p>
<p>And these are animals that live in social communities</p>
<p>of between say 20 and 200.</p>
<p>They have a lot of them in one group,</p>
<p>but they never come together in a single unit.</p>
<p>These are, they share an area, a community territory,</p>
<p>and that area is defended by males</p>
<p>and within it, females wander</p>
<p>and bring up their young independently.</p>
<p>And the females are very scared</p>
<p>about the possibility that males</p>
<p>will be mean to their infants.</p>
<p>And in order to avoid them doing that,</p>
<p>they do their best to mate with every single male</p>
<p>in the group multiple times,</p>
<p>as if to give a memory in that male of,</p>
<p>yeah, yeah, I reminded you,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not gonna be mean to your baby.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s wonderful about chimps?</p>
<p>Well, you know, as we&rsquo;ve spoken about them,</p>
<p>they are creative and sort of amazingly humanlike,</p>
<p>but I love the sort of, you know, the quiet moments.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two chimps who are grooming each other</p>
<p>on a day when they are utterly exhausted.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve walked 11 kilometers the day before,</p>
<p>up and down hills.</p>
<p>And on this particular day,</p>
<p>all they do is they get to one tree</p>
<p>and they eat from that tree.</p>
<p>And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards</p>
<p>and they go back to sleep in the nest in which they woke up.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re utterly exhausted</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just eating nonstop</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to recover their energy.</p>
<p>And this is Hugh and Charlie.</p>
<p>And we think they were probably brothers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never actually got the genetic evidence to prove it.</p>
<p>Well, I never remember now who it is,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say that they both come down from the tree</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both carrying branches of the food.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually seeds from these branches.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both engaged, even in the midday sun</p>
<p>when they want to come down and unshade themselves</p>
<p>for a bit on the ground, they&rsquo;re still eating.</p>
<p>But then Charlie finishes his branch</p>
<p>and he starts grooming Hugh.</p>
<p>And Hugh continues eating from his branch.</p>
<p>Charlie eventually gets bored of this after a few minutes</p>
<p>and he reaches out and he lifts the branch</p>
<p>from which Hugh is still taking seeds</p>
<p>and puts it over his head and puts it behind his back</p>
<p>as far as possible away from Hugh.</p>
<p>Hugh doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>He just finishes his mouthful</p>
<p>and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.</p>
<p>So this very polite way of saying,</p>
<p>will you groom me please has worked.</p>
<p>Then Hugh grooms around Charlie&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>and around to the right side and then down his arm</p>
<p>to what point where he can reach the branch again.</p>
<p>And then he picks up the branch</p>
<p>and continues nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So in other words, a very sort of simple little strategy</p>
<p>but it just shows the courtesy</p>
<p>with which they can treat each other.</p>
<p>And the days I love with chimps</p>
<p>are when you see that sort of thing</p>
<p>or when you see mothers just lying</p>
<p>in a sunlit patch in the forest</p>
<p>with their babies bouncing on top of them,</p>
<p>just having a wonderful peaceful time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what most of their lives are like.</p>
<p>So chimpanzees are the species</p>
<p>that kind of unites the rest of the apes</p>
<p>because a gorilla is in many ways</p>
<p>just a big version of a chimpanzee.</p>
<p>If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee in your mind</p>
<p>to be bigger, it basically turns into a gorilla.</p>
<p>And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River</p>
<p>are like a domesticated form of a chimpanzee</p>
<p>but obviously humans didn&rsquo;t domesticate them.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re self domesticated.</p>
<p>They are less aggressive</p>
<p>and they show all the marks of domestication</p>
<p>that domestication animals do</p>
<p>compared to wild animals in their bones.</p>
<p>So they have reduced differences between males and females</p>
<p>in which the males are more like females.</p>
<p>They have smaller brains, they have shorter faces,</p>
<p>smaller teeth and smaller bodies.</p>
<p>All the things that domesticated animals show.</p>
<p>And bonobos live in this environment</p>
<p>in a strikingly peaceful way compared to the chimpanzees.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no indication that they will have</p>
<p>these aggressive kills and enough data now to show</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a statistical difference</p>
<p>in the frequency of which it would happen.</p>
<p>And bonobos are famously erotic.</p>
<p>The females have enlarged sexual parts</p>
<p>which swell to particularly large size</p>
<p>compared to the female chimpanzees.</p>
<p>And the females have a lot of interactions with each other</p>
<p>in which they excitedly rub their clitorises together</p>
<p>and appear to have orgasms.</p>
<p>And these occur in the context</p>
<p>of some kind of social tension.</p>
<p>And they sometimes happen before,</p>
<p>they sometimes happen after the social tension,</p>
<p>and they seem to be devices, these interactions,</p>
<p>for ensuring that everyone&rsquo;s friends</p>
<p>and reducing the chances</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actually gonna get into a fight.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a kind of conflict resolution through sex</p>
<p>or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s often characterized as make love, not war.</p>
<p>Make love, not war.</p>
<p>Okay, you mentioned to me offline</p>
<p>that you have a deep love for nature.</p>
<p>If we look at the world today,</p>
<p>how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature</p>
<p>remain a big part of our lives as human beings</p>
<p>in the way we think about it,</p>
<p>in the way we also keep it around, preserve it?</p>
<p>You know, we keep it part of our minds</p>
<p>and part of our world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very difficult question</p>
<p>because every time there was a conflict</p>
<p>between conservation of a natural habitat</p>
<p>and allowing people to get that little bit of extra food</p>
<p>for their babies,</p>
<p>then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.</p>
<p>And so we have this steady erosion</p>
<p>in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.</p>
<p>We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats</p>
<p>and all the species,</p>
<p>and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples</p>
<p>of something being saved,</p>
<p>but the overall trend is clear.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult to see how one can ever escape that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not human.</p>
<p>Now that we are essentially a single tribe,</p>
<p>to want to save an elephant if it means killing 20 humans.</p>
<p>So I think the only way in which we can really conserve</p>
<p>is if we put tremendous effort</p>
<p>into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.</p>
<p>Often this will be the national parks that already exist.</p>
<p>And what we have to do is to make them so valuable</p>
<p>that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival</p>
<p>to be able to keep those sorts of places.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the attitude that my colleagues and I</p>
<p>have taken in Uganda,</p>
<p>where we want to keep the Kibale National Park alive,</p>
<p>which has got the largest population chimpanzees</p>
<p>in Uganda,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got elephants and wonderful birds</p>
<p>and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so on,</p>
<p>and visitors, and lots and lots of visitors.</p>
<p>It may be that we&rsquo;re going to have to have huge increases</p>
<p>in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism.</p>
<p>And you need to make sure that ecotourism is done right.</p>
<p>In other places, you will keep nature there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s useful for maintaining the climate,</p>
<p>bringing rain.</p>
<p>Maybe you can in some places convince people</p>
<p>of the sheer sort of aesthetics of keeping nature</p>
<p>that even over the long term,</p>
<p>presidents whose job it is to look for the future</p>
<p>of the country will be persuaded</p>
<p>that you can do it for purely aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p>But overall, what is required is for people</p>
<p>in the rich countries to do much more investment</p>
<p>than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places</p>
<p>in their own countries and in the tropics.</p>
<p>And if you look at Africa,</p>
<p>I mean, the population trends are that Nigeria</p>
<p>may become the most populous country in the world, I think,</p>
<p>or within a century.</p>
<p>The future of African habitats,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s clear what&rsquo;s gonna happen in general.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a huge conversion</p>
<p>towards agricultural land.</p>
<p>I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago</p>
<p>about the prospect of the entire globe</p>
<p>being turned into a single human feedlot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take a lot to avoid that.</p>
<p>He is out there calling for half the earth</p>
<p>to be devoted to nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic.</p>
<p>But unless you have really exciting goals,</p>
<p>probably nothing will be achieved.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s something to me,</p>
<p>like when I visit New York and I see Central Park</p>
<p>and then somehow constructed a situation</p>
<p>where you preserve this park in the middle of the park,</p>
<p>probably some of the most expensive land in the world.</p>
<p>The fact that that&rsquo;s possible gives me hope</p>
<p>that you can do this kind of preservation at a global scale,</p>
<p>perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons</p>
<p>of just valuing the beauty</p>
<p>and just respecting our origins</p>
<p>of having come from the earth.</p>
<p>We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees,</p>
<p>bonobos and gorillas as our close relatives</p>
<p>still living on the earth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re unlucky that we don&rsquo;t have Australopithecines</p>
<p>and other species of homo,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re still lucky to have those</p>
<p>because they are incredibly closely related to us</p>
<p>compared to what most animals have.</p>
<p>There are many animals that don&rsquo;t have any close relatives</p>
<p>to them on the earth.</p>
<p>But not only are they relatively close,</p>
<p>but they teach us so much about ourselves.</p>
<p>The similarities between them and ourselves</p>
<p>raise questions that we can then test</p>
<p>about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities</p>
<p>are derived from the same evolutionary stock</p>
<p>as in those great apes.</p>
<p>Well, how much is that worth?</p>
<p>I mean, we could spend billions going to the Mars</p>
<p>to find evidence of bacteria there,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fascinating too.</p>
<p>But we should be spending billions on this earth</p>
<p>in order to make sure that we have,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to say it,</p>
<p>substantial representative populations</p>
<p>of these close relatives.</p>
<p>Yeah, that we can meet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something like space tourism</p>
<p>when you go out into space and you look back down on earth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to a lot of people, including myself,</p>
<p>is worth a lot.</p>
<p>But why is that worth a lot?</p>
<p>Is because it&rsquo;s humbling and beautiful</p>
<p>in the same way that meeting</p>
<p>our close evolutionary relatives is humbling and beautiful.</p>
<p>Just to know that this is what we come from.</p>
<p>This is who we are.</p>
<p>Not just for the understanding or the science of it,</p>
<p>but just something about just the beauty of witnessing this.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s both humbling and empowering</p>
<p>that this place is fragile and we&rsquo;re damn lucky to be here.</p>
<p>Yes, and unfortunately,</p>
<p>the problems are incredibly difficult to solve</p>
<p>and there is no one solver.</p>
<p>It has to happen from a network</p>
<p>of potentially cooperating people.</p>
<p>But I mean, you&rsquo;re so right about it being daunting</p>
<p>to think about what it looks like from space.</p>
<p>And I love the view that Herman Muller expressed</p>
<p>of being able to go out from space.</p>
<p>And he said the whole of life</p>
<p>would look like a kind of rust on the planet.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the aliens were to visit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure they would notice the life.</p>
<p>They would probably notice the trees or ocean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of rust.</p>
<p>But let me ask the big ridiculous philosophical question.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this rust?</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life on Earth?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of our human intelligent life?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that we have an evolutionary story</p>
<p>that is only getting challenged around the edges.</p>
<p>We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.</p>
<p>And the meaning is we are here</p>
<p>as a consequence of materialistic processes that began,</p>
<p>in our sense, with the establishment of the Earth</p>
<p>four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was,</p>
<p>and then water and oxygen and so on.</p>
<p>And we are the astonishing consequence</p>
<p>of the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>The word random is the wrong word to use</p>
<p>unless you understand what it means.</p>
<p>You know, it didn&rsquo;t happen by chance,</p>
<p>but a lot of random events had to happen</p>
<p>to make this possible.</p>
<p>And those random events, of course,</p>
<p>are the production of appropriate mutations.</p>
<p>But the meaning of life is there is no meaning.</p>
<p>The really big mystery of life is why is there a universe?</p>
<p>And that same why propagates itself through the whole of it,</p>
<p>through the whole process of it,</p>
<p>for the emergence of planets, the emergence,</p>
<p>first of all, of galaxies, of star systems.</p>
<p>Of planets, of the proteins required</p>
<p>to construct the single cell organisms</p>
<p>and the single cell organism becoming complex organisms</p>
<p>and some of the clever fish crawling out onto the land</p>
<p>and the whole of it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s fire,</p>
<p>some clever guy or lady invented fire,</p>
<p>and then now here we are.</p>
<p>It just does seem, speaking as a human,</p>
<p>kind of special that we&rsquo;re able to reflect on the whole thing</p>
<p>or the whole&hellip;</p>
<p>Wonderful story.</p>
<p>So much more interesting than the stories produced by religion.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is beautiful,</p>
<p>but it just seems special that us humans</p>
<p>are able to write religions and construct stories</p>
<p>and also do science.</p>
<p>That seems kind of amazing.</p>
<p>It seems like the universe is such that it creates beings like us</p>
<p>that are able to investigate it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s this longing for why.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just such a beautiful little pocket of complexity</p>
<p>created by the universe.</p>
<p>It seems like there should be a why,</p>
<p>but maybe there&rsquo;s just an infinite number of universes</p>
<p>and this is the one that led to this particular set of humans.</p>
<p>Even without an infinite number of universes,</p>
<p>I bet there&rsquo;s an infinite number of intelligent beings.</p>
<p>Throughout this universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, now that we know how many planets</p>
<p>have the right sort of conditions,</p>
<p>which is what, I can&rsquo;t remember, a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some significant percentage of all planets.</p>
<p>Then there are apparently billions of planets.</p>
<p>Things happen so quickly on Earth.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got water, then you&rsquo;ve got life.</p>
<p>It did not take long for life to evolve</p>
<p>in the big scheme of things.</p>
<p>And if you think, you look out there,</p>
<p>say there&rsquo;s a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations,</p>
<p>one dimension you can look at is the proclivity to violence they have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think what level of violence is useful</p>
<p>for extending the life of a civilization.</p>
<p>So we have a particular set of violence in our history.</p>
<p>Maybe being too peaceful is a problem in the early days.</p>
<p>Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem.</p>
<p>So you look at viruses.</p>
<p>What kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too deadly, that&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not deadly enough, that&rsquo;s also a problem.</p>
<p>So that is a fascinating exploration of&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any evidence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see where you&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>when you say that being too peaceful is a problem.</p>
<p>Well, because, I&rsquo;ll say it this way,</p>
<p>death is a way to get rid of suboptimal solutions.</p>
<p>So violence&hellip;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s lots of ways to die without violence.</p>
<p>Right. To me, death in itself is violence.</p>
<p>And you can&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people that talk about, for example,</p>
<p>longevity and disease and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>they see death as a&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the way they talk about it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to philosophically think of it that way.</p>
<p>Death is like mass murder that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>People that try to, from a biological perspective, help extend life,</p>
<p>they see that you&rsquo;re helping&hellip;</p>
<p>The biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization,</p>
<p>from their perspective,</p>
<p>is not allocating all our resources to solving death.</p>
<p>Right. Because death is a kind of violence.</p>
<p>It is the kind of murder that we&rsquo;re allowing</p>
<p>to be committed on us by nature.</p>
<p>And so the flip side of that is death makes way for new life,</p>
<p>for new ideas.</p>
<p>Yes. But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with peace versus war.</p>
<p>You have animals that are very, very peaceful,</p>
<p>but they evolve just in the same way as other animals do.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t do it with death caused by violence.</p>
<p>And violent death is premature death, surely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind about people dying.</p>
<p>What I mind about is people dying in their youth, middle age.</p>
<p>Prematurely.</p>
<p>But some people would say all death is premature.</p>
<p>It certainly feels that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s died too soon.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s ever died, died too soon.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I mean, if we can become like sequoias</p>
<p>and live for hundreds of years or thousands of years,</p>
<p>that would be great.</p>
<p>Do you ponder your own mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m afraid of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reconciled to the fact it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to leave the party.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s kind of a fun party.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to leave the party either.</p>
<p>So however we got here, we made one heck of an awesome party.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Having a party with a little bit less violence in it</p>
<p>is an even more fun party.</p>
<p>Richard, I&rsquo;m deeply honored that you spent time with me today.</p>
<p>Your work is amazing.</p>
<p>It includes some of the deepest thinking about our human history</p>
<p>and the nature of human civilization.</p>
<p>So again, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for your great questions.</p>
<p>It was a fun conversation.</p>
