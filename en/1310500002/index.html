    <p>As part of MIT course 6S099 on artificial general intelligence, I got a chance to sit</p>
<p>down with Christoph Koch, who is one of the seminal figures in neurobiology, neuroscience,</p>
<p>and generally in the study of consciousness.</p>
<p>He is the president, the chief scientific officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science</p>
<p>in Seattle.</p>
<p>From 1986 to 2013, he was a professor at Caltech.</p>
<p>Before that, he was at MIT, he is extremely well cited, over 100,000 citations.</p>
<p>His research, his writing, his ideas have had big impact on the scientific community</p>
<p>and the general public in the way we think about consciousness, in the way we see ourselves</p>
<p>as human beings.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of several books, The Quest for Consciousness and Neurobiological Approach,</p>
<p>and a more recent book, Consciousness, Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this conversation, this course, subscribe, click the little bell icon to make</p>
<p>sure you never miss a video, and in the comments, leave suggestions for any people you&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to see be part of the course or any ideas that you would like us to explore.</p>
<p>Thanks very much and I hope you enjoy.</p>
<p>Okay, before we delve into the beautiful mysteries of consciousness, let&rsquo;s zoom out a little</p>
<p>bit and let me ask, do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there in the universe?</p>
<p>Yes, I do believe so.</p>
<p>We have no evidence of it, but I think the probabilities are overwhelming in favor of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Given a universe where we have 10 to the 11 galaxies and each galaxy has between 10 to</p>
<p>the 11, 10 to the 12 stars and we know most stars have one or more planets.</p>
<p>So how does that make you feel?</p>
<p>It still makes me feel special because I have experiences.</p>
<p>I feel the world, I experience the world and independent of whether there are other creatures</p>
<p>out there, I still feel the world and I have access to this world in this very strange</p>
<p>compelling way and that&rsquo;s the core of human existence.</p>
<p>Now, you said human, do you think if those intelligent creatures are out there, do you</p>
<p>think they experience their world?</p>
<p>Yes, if they are evolved, if they are a product of natural evolution as they would have to</p>
<p>be, they will also experience their own world.</p>
<p>The consciousness isn&rsquo;t just human, you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s much wider.</p>
<p>It may be spread across all of biology.</p>
<p>The only thing that we have special is we can talk about it.</p>
<p>Of course, not all people can talk about it.</p>
<p>Babies and little children can talk about it.</p>
<p>Patients who have a stroke in the left inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it, but most</p>
<p>normal adult people can talk about it and so we think that makes us special compared</p>
<p>to let&rsquo;s say monkeys or dogs or cats or mice or all the other creatures that we share the</p>
<p>planet with, but all the evidence seems to suggest that they too experience the world</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s overwhelmingly likely that aliens would also experience their world.</p>
<p>Of course, differently because they have a different sensorium, they have different sensors,</p>
<p>they have a very different environment, but the fact that I would strongly suppose that</p>
<p>they also have experiences.</p>
<p>They feel pain and pleasure and see in some sort of spectrum and hear and have all the</p>
<p>other senses.</p>
<p>Of course, their language, if they have one, would be different so we might not be able</p>
<p>to understand their poetry about the experiences that they have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>So in a talk, in a video, I&rsquo;ve heard you mention Siputzo, a dachshund that you came up with,</p>
<p>that you grew up with, it was part of your family when you were young.</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re technically a Midwestern boy.</p>
<p>You just ‚Äì</p>
<p>Technically.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But after that, you traveled around a bit, hence a little bit of the accent.</p>
<p>You talked about Siputzo, the dachshund, having these elements of humanness, of consciousness</p>
<p>that you discovered.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to ask, can you look back in your childhood and remember when was the</p>
<p>first time you realized you yourself, sort of from a third person perspective, are a</p>
<p>conscious being?</p>
<p>This idea of stepping outside yourself and seeing there&rsquo;s something special going on</p>
<p>here in my brain.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really actually ‚Äì it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I recall a discrete moment.</p>
<p>I mean, you take it for granted because that&rsquo;s the only world you know.</p>
<p>The only world I know and you know is the world of seeing and hearing voices and touching</p>
<p>and all the other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only much later at early ‚Äì in my underguided days when I enrolled in physics</p>
<p>and in philosophy that I really thought about it and thought, well, this is really fundamentally</p>
<p>very, very mysterious and there&rsquo;s nothing really in physics right now that explains</p>
<p>this transition from the physics of the brain to feelings.</p>
<p>Where do the feelings come in?</p>
<p>So you can look at the foundational equation of quantum mechanics, general relativity.</p>
<p>You can look at the periodic table of the elements.</p>
<p>You can look at the endless ATGC chat in our genes and nowhere is consciousness.</p>
<p>Yet I wake up every morning to a world where I have experiences.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the heart of the ancient mind body problem.</p>
<p>How do experiences get into the world?</p>
<p>So what is consciousness?</p>
<p>Experience.</p>
<p>This is any experience.</p>
<p>Some people call it subjective feeling.</p>
<p>Some people call it phenomenology.</p>
<p>Some people call it qualia of the philosopher.</p>
<p>But they all denote the same thing.</p>
<p>It feels like something in the famous word of the philosopher Thomas Nagel.</p>
<p>It feels like something to be a bat or to be an American or to be angry or to be sad</p>
<p>or to be in love or to have pain.</p>
<p>And that is what experience is, any possible experience.</p>
<p>Could be as mundane as just sitting in a chair.</p>
<p>Could be as exalted as having a mystical moment in deep meditation.</p>
<p>Those are just different forms of experiences.</p>
<p>Experience.</p>
<p>So if you were to sit down with maybe the next, skip a couple generations, of IBM Watson,</p>
<p>something that won Jeopardy, what is the gap, I guess the question is, between Watson, that</p>
<p>might be much smarter than you, than us, than any human alive, but may not have experience,</p>
<p>what is the gap?</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s a big, big question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s occupied people for the last, certainly last 50 years since we, you know, since the</p>
<p>advent, the birth of computers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question Alan Turing tried to answer.</p>
<p>And of course he did it in this indirect way by proposing a test, an operational test.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not really, that&rsquo;s, you know, he tried to get at what does it mean for a person</p>
<p>to think, and then he had this test, right?</p>
<p>You lock them away, and then you have a communication with them, and then you try to guess after</p>
<p>a while whether that is a person or whether it&rsquo;s a computer system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that now or very soon, you know, Alexa or Siri or, you know, Google</p>
<p>now will pass this test, right?</p>
<p>And you can game it, but you know, ultimately, certainly in your generation, there will be</p>
<p>machines that will speak with complete poise that will remember everything you ever said.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll remember every email you ever had, like Samantha, remember in the movie Her?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>But of course, the key question is, does it feel like anything to be Samantha in the movie</p>
<p>Her?</p>
<p>Or does it feel like anything to be Watson?</p>
<p>And there one has to very, very strongly think there are two different concepts here that</p>
<p>we co mingle.</p>
<p>There is the concept of intelligence, natural or artificial, and there is a concept of consciousness,</p>
<p>of experience, natural or artificial.</p>
<p>Those are very, very different things.</p>
<p>Now, historically, we associate consciousness with intelligence.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we live in a world, leaving aside computers, of natural selection, where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>surrounded by creatures, either our own kin that are less or more intelligent, or we go</p>
<p>across species.</p>
<p>Some are more adapted to a particular environment.</p>
<p>Others are less adapted, whether it&rsquo;s a whale or dog, or you go talk about a paramecium</p>
<p>or a little worm.</p>
<p>And we see the complexity of the nervous system goes from one cell to specialized cells, to</p>
<p>a worm that has three nets, that has 30 percent of its cells are nerve cells, to creature</p>
<p>like us or like a blue whale that has 100 billion, even more nerve cells.</p>
<p>And so based on behavioral evidence and based on the underlying neuroscience, we believe</p>
<p>that as these creatures become more complex, they are better adapted to their particular</p>
<p>ecological niche, and they become more conscious, partly because their brain grows.</p>
<p>And we believe consciousness, unlike the ancient, ancient people thought most, almost every</p>
<p>culture thought that consciousness with intelligence has to do with your heart.</p>
<p>And you still see that today.</p>
<p>You see, honey, I love you with all my heart.</p>
<p>But what you should actually say is, no, honey, I love you with all my lateral hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, you should give your sweetheart, you know, hypothalamus, a piece</p>
<p>of chocolate and not a heart shaped chocolate.</p>
<p>Anyway, so we still have this language, but now we believe it&rsquo;s a brain.</p>
<p>And so we see brains of different complexity and we think, well, they have different levels</p>
<p>of consciousness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re capable of different experiences.</p>
<p>But now we confront the world where we know where we&rsquo;re beginning to engineer intelligence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s radical unclear whether the intelligence we&rsquo;re engineering has anything to do with</p>
<p>consciousness and whether it can experience anything.</p>
<p>Because fundamentally, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Intelligence is about function.</p>
<p>Intelligence no matter exactly how you define it, sort of adaptation to new environments,</p>
<p>being able to learn and quickly understand, you know, the setup of this and what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on and who are the actors and what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all about function.</p>
<p>Consciousness is not about function.</p>
<p>Consciousness is about being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in some sense much fundamental.</p>
<p>You can see this in several cases.</p>
<p>You can see it, for instance, in the case of the clinic.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re dealing with patients who are, let&rsquo;s say, had a stroke or had were in traffic</p>
<p>accident, et cetera, they&rsquo;re pretty much immobile.</p>
<p>Terri Schiavo, you may have heard historically, she was a person here in the 90s in Florida.</p>
<p>Her heart stood still.</p>
<p>She was reanimated.</p>
<p>And then for the next 14 years, she was what&rsquo;s called in a vegetative state.</p>
<p>So there are thousands of people in a vegetative state.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re like this.</p>
<p>Occasionally, they open their eyes for two, three, four, five, six, eight hours, and then</p>
<p>close their eyes.</p>
<p>They have sleep wake cycle.</p>
<p>Occasionally, they have behaviors.</p>
<p>They do like, you know, but there&rsquo;s no way that you can establish a lawful relationship</p>
<p>between what you say or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient does.</p>
<p>So there isn&rsquo;t any behavior, yet in some of these people, there is still experience.</p>
<p>You can design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see there&rsquo;s still experience</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>And of course, these cases of locked in state, there&rsquo;s this famous book called The Diving</p>
<p>Bell and the Butterfly, where you had an editor, a French editor, he had a stroke in the brainstem,</p>
<p>unable to move except his vertical eyes, eye movement.</p>
<p>He could just move his eyes up and down.</p>
<p>And he dictated an entire book.</p>
<p>And some people even lose this at the end.</p>
<p>All the evidence seems to suggest that they&rsquo;re still in there.</p>
<p>In this case, you have no behavior, you have consciousness.</p>
<p>Second case is tonight, like all of us, you&rsquo;re going to go to sleep, close your eyes, you</p>
<p>go to sleep, you will wake up inside your sleeping body, and you will have conscious</p>
<p>experiences.</p>
<p>They are different from everyday experience.</p>
<p>You might fly, you might not be surprised that you&rsquo;re flying, you might meet a long</p>
<p>dead pet, childhood dog, and you&rsquo;re not surprised that you&rsquo;re meeting them.</p>
<p>But you have conscious experience of love, of hate, they can be very emotional.</p>
<p>Your body during this state, typically it&rsquo;s REM state, sends an active signal to your</p>
<p>motor neurons to paralyze you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called atonia.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have that, like some patients, what do you do?</p>
<p>You act out your dreams.</p>
<p>You get, for example, REM behavioral disorder, which is bad juju to get.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Third case is pure experience.</p>
<p>So I recently had this, what some people call a mystical experience.</p>
<p>I went to Singapore and went into a flotation tank.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So this is a big tub filled with water, that&rsquo;s body temperature and Epsom salt.</p>
<p>You strip completely naked, you lie inside of it, you close the lid.</p>
<p>Darkness.</p>
<p>Complete darkness, soundproof.</p>
<p>So very quickly, you become bodiless because you&rsquo;re floating and you&rsquo;re naked.</p>
<p>You have no rings, no watch, no nothing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t feel your body anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sound, soundless.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no photon, sightless, timeless, because after a while, early on you actually hear</p>
<p>your heart, but then you sort of adapt to that and then sort of the passage of time</p>
<p>ceases.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you train yourself, like in a meditation, not to think, early on you think a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit spooky.</p>
<p>You feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think, well, I&rsquo;m going to get bored.</p>
<p>And if you try to not to think actively, you become mindless.</p>
<p>There you are, bodiless, timeless, you know, soundless, sightless, mindless, but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in a conscious experience.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not asleep.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not asleep.</p>
<p>You are a being of pure, you&rsquo;re a pure being.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t any function.</p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t doing any computation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not remembering.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not projecting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not planning.</p>
<p>Yet you are fully conscious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fully conscious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something going on there.</p>
<p>It could be just a side effect.</p>
<p>So what is the&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean epiphenomena.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the select, meaning why, what is the function of you being able to lay in this</p>
<p>sensory free deprivation tank and still have a conscious experience?</p>
<p>Evolutionary?</p>
<p>Evolutionary.</p>
<p>Obviously we didn&rsquo;t evolve with flotation tanks in our environment.</p>
<p>I mean, so biology is notoriously bad at asking why question, telenormical question.</p>
<p>Why do we have two eyes?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have four eyes like some teachers or three eyes or something?</p>
<p>Well, no, there&rsquo;s probably, there is a function to that, but we&rsquo;re not very good at answering</p>
<p>those questions.</p>
<p>We can speculate endlessly where biology is very, or science is very good about mechanistic</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>Why is there a charge in the universe?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We find a certain universe where there are positive and negative charges.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why does quantum mechanics hold?</p>
<p>You know, why doesn&rsquo;t some other theory hold?</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics holding our universe is very unclear why.</p>
<p>So telenormical question, why questions are difficult to answer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some relationship between complexity, brain processing power and consciousness.</p>
<p>But however, in these cases, in these three examples I gave, one is an everyday experience</p>
<p>at night.</p>
<p>The other one is trauma.</p>
<p>And third one is in principle, you can, everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences.</p>
<p>You have a dissociation of function from, of intelligence from consciousness.</p>
<p>You caught me asking a why question.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question that&rsquo;s not a why question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving a talk later today on the Turing test for intelligence and consciousness, drawing</p>
<p>lines between the two.</p>
<p>So is there a scientific way to say there&rsquo;s consciousness present in this entity or not?</p>
<p>And to anticipate your answer, cause you, you will also, there&rsquo;s a neurobiological answer.</p>
<p>So we can test the human brain, but if you take a machine brain that you don&rsquo;t know tests</p>
<p>for yet, how would you even begin to approach a test if there&rsquo;s consciousness present in</p>
<p>this thing?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>So let me take it in two steps.</p>
<p>So as you point out for, for, for, for humans, let&rsquo;s just stick with humans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now a test called the Zap and Zip is a procedure where you ping the brain using</p>
<p>transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>
<p>You look at the electrical reverberations essentially using EG, and then you can measure</p>
<p>the complexity of this brain response.</p>
<p>And you can do this in awake people, in asleep, normal people, you can do it in awake people</p>
<p>and then anesthetize them.</p>
<p>You can do it in patients.</p>
<p>And it, it, it has a hundred percent accuracy that in all those cases, when you&rsquo;re clear,</p>
<p>the patient or the person is either conscious or unconscious, the complexity is either high</p>
<p>or low.</p>
<p>And then you can adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and,</p>
<p>and, and mice that have very similar brains.</p>
<p>Now of course you, you point out that may not help you because we don&rsquo;t have a cortex,</p>
<p>you know, and if I send a magnetic pulse into my iPhone or my computer, it&rsquo;s probably going</p>
<p>to break something.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>So what we need ultimately, we need a theory of consciousness.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just rely on our intuition.</p>
<p>Our intuition is, well, yeah, if somebody talks, they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>However, then there are all these patients, children, babies don&rsquo;t talk, right?</p>
<p>But we believe that, that the babies also have conscious experiences, right?</p>
<p>And then there are all these patients I mentioned and they don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>When you dream, you can&rsquo;t talk because you&rsquo;re paralyzed.</p>
<p>So what we ultimately need, we can&rsquo;t just rely on our intuition.</p>
<p>We need a theory of conscience that tells us what is it about a piece of matter?</p>
<p>What is it about a piece of highly excitable matter like the brain or like a computer that</p>
<p>gives rise to conscious experience?</p>
<p>We all believe, none of us believes anymore in the old story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a soul, right?</p>
<p>That used to be the most common explanation that most people accept that instill a lot</p>
<p>of people today believe, well, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s God endowed only us with a special thing</p>
<p>that animals don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Rene Descartes famously said, a dog, if you hit it with your carriage may yell, may cry,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have this special thing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the magic, the magic soul.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have res cogitans, the soul.</p>
<p>Now we believe that isn&rsquo;t the case anymore.</p>
<p>So what is the difference between brains and, and these guys, silicon?</p>
<p>And in particular, once their behavior matches.</p>
<p>So if you have Siri or Alexa in 20 years from now that she can talk just as good as any</p>
<p>possible human, what grounds do you have to say she&rsquo;s not conscious in particular, if</p>
<p>she says it&rsquo;s of course she will, well, of course I&rsquo;m conscious.</p>
<p>You ask her how are you doing?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;ll say, well, you know, they, they&rsquo;ll generate some way to, of course she&rsquo;ll behave</p>
<p>like a, like a person.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s several differences.</p>
<p>One is, so this relates to the problem, the very hard, why is consciousness a hard problem?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s subjective, right?</p>
<p>Only I have it, for only I know I have direct experience of my own consciousness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have experience in your consciousness.</p>
<p>Now I assume as a sort of a Bayesian person who believes in probability theory and all</p>
<p>of that, you know, I can do, I can do an abduction to the, to the best available facts.</p>
<p>I deduce your brain is very similar to mine.</p>
<p>If I put you in a scanner, your brain is roughly going to behave the same way as I do.</p>
<p>If, if, if, you know, if I give you this muesli and ask you, how does it taste?</p>
<p>You tell me things that, you know, that, that I would also say more or less, right?</p>
<p>So I infer based on all of that, that you&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>Now with theory, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So there I really need a theory that tells me what is it about, about any system, this</p>
<p>or this, that makes it conscious.</p>
<p>We have such a theory.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the integrated information theory, but let me first, maybe as an introduction for</p>
<p>people who are not familiar, Descartes, can you, you talk a lot about pan, panpsychism.</p>
<p>Can you describe what, uh, physicalism versus dualism?</p>
<p>This you, you mentioned the soul, what, what is the history of that idea?</p>
<p>What is the idea of panpsychism or no, the debate really, uh, out of which panpsychism</p>
<p>can, um, emerge of, of, of, um, dualism versus, uh, physicalism or do you not see panpsychism</p>
<p>as fitting into that?</p>
<p>No, you can argue there&rsquo;s some, okay, so let&rsquo;s step back.</p>
<p>So panpsychism is a very ancient belief that&rsquo;s been around, uh, I mean, Plato and Aristotle</p>
<p>talks about it, uh, modern philosophers talk about it.</p>
<p>Of course, in Buddhism, the idea is very prevalent that, I mean, there are different versions</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>One version says everything is ensouled, everything, rocks and stones and dogs and people and forest</p>
<p>and iPhones, all of us all, right?</p>
<p>All matter is ensouled.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of one version.</p>
<p>Another version is that all biology, all creatures, small or large, from a single cell to a giant</p>
<p>sequoia tree feel like something.</p>
<p>This one I think is somewhat more realistic.</p>
<p>Um, so the different versions, what do you mean by feel like something, have, have feelings,</p>
<p>have some kind of, it feels like something, it may well be possible that it feels like</p>
<p>something to be a paramecium.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty likely it feels like something to be a bee or a mouse or a dog.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>So, so that you can see that&rsquo;s also, so panpsychism is very broad and you can, so some people,</p>
<p>for example, Bertrand Russell, tried to advocate this, this idea, it&rsquo;s called Rasselian Monism,</p>
<p>that that panpsychism is really physics viewed from the inside.</p>
<p>So the idea is that physics is very good at describing relationship among objects like</p>
<p>charges or like gravity, right?</p>
<p>You know, describe the relationship between curvature and mass distribution, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the relationship among things.</p>
<p>Physics doesn&rsquo;t really describe the ultimate reality itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just relationship among, you know, quarks or all these other stuff from like a third</p>
<p>person observer.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And consciousness is what physics feels from the inside.</p>
<p>So my conscious experience, it&rsquo;s the way the physics of my brain, particularly my cortex</p>
<p>feels from the inside.</p>
<p>And so if you are paramecium, you got to remember, you say paramecium, well, that&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>dumb creature.</p>
<p>It is, but it has already a billion different molecules, probably, you know, 5,000 different</p>
<p>proteins assembled in a highly, highly complex system that no single person, no computer</p>
<p>system so far on this planet has ever managed to accurately simulate.</p>
<p>Its complexity vastly escapes us.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it may well be that that little thing feels like a tiny bit.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t have a voice in the head like me.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have expectations.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t have all that complex things, but it may well feel like something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is really interesting.</p>
<p>Can we draw some lines and maybe try to understand the difference between life, intelligence</p>
<p>and consciousness?</p>
<p>How do you see all of those?</p>
<p>If you had to define what is a living thing, what is a conscious thing and what is an intelligent</p>
<p>thing?</p>
<p>Do those intermix for you or are they totally separate?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So A, that&rsquo;s a question that we don&rsquo;t have a full answer to.</p>
<p>A lot of the stuff we&rsquo;re talking about today is full of mysteries and fascinating ones,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>For example, you can go to Aristotle, who&rsquo;s probably the most important scientist and</p>
<p>philosopher who&rsquo;s ever lived in, certainly in Western culture.</p>
<p>He had this idea, it&rsquo;s called hylomorphism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite popular these days, that there are different forms of soul.</p>
<p>The soul is really the form of something.</p>
<p>He says, all biological creatures have a vegetative soul.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s life principle.</p>
<p>Today, we think we understand something more than it is biochemistry and nonlinear thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Then he said they have a sensitive soul.</p>
<p>Only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul or a petitive soul.</p>
<p>They can see, they can smell, and they have drives.</p>
<p>They want to reproduce, they want to eat, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then only humans have what he called a rational soul, okay?</p>
<p>And that idea then made it into Christendom and then the rational soul is the one that</p>
<p>lives forever.</p>
<p>He was very unclear.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t really, I mean, different readings of Aristotle give different, whether did he</p>
<p>believe that rational soul was immortal or not.</p>
<p>I probably think he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But then, of course, that made it through Plato into Christianity, and then this soul</p>
<p>became immortal and then became the connection to God.</p>
<p>So you ask me, essentially, what is our modern conception of these three, Aristotle would</p>
<p>have called them different forms.</p>
<p>Life, we think we know something about it, at least life on this planet, right?</p>
<p>Although we don&rsquo;t understand how to originate it, but it&rsquo;s been difficult to rigorously</p>
<p>pin down.</p>
<p>You see this in modern definitions of death.</p>
<p>In fact, right now, there&rsquo;s a conference ongoing, again, that tries to define legally and medically</p>
<p>what is death.</p>
<p>It used to be very simple.</p>
<p>Death is you stop breathing, your heart stops beating, you&rsquo;re dead, totally uncontroversial.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unsure, you wait another 10 minutes.</p>
<p>If the patient doesn&rsquo;t breathe, he&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Well, now we have ventilators, we have heart pacemakers, so it&rsquo;s much more difficult to</p>
<p>define what death is.</p>
<p>Typically, death is defined as the end of life and life is defined before death.</p>
<p>Okay, so we don&rsquo;t have really very good definitions.</p>
<p>Intelligence, we don&rsquo;t have a rigorous definition.</p>
<p>We know something how to measure, it&rsquo;s called IQ or G factors, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re beginning to build it in a narrow sense, right?</p>
<p>Like go, AlphaGo and Watson and, you know, Google cars and Uber cars and all of that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still narrow AI and some people are thinking about artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>But roughly, as we said before, it&rsquo;s something to do with ability to learn and to adapt to</p>
<p>new environments.</p>
<p>But that is, as I said, also, it&rsquo;s radical difference from experience.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very unclear if you build a machine that has AGI, it&rsquo;s not at all a priori, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not at all clear that this machine will have consciousness, it may or may not.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s ask it the other way, do you think if you were to try to build an artificial</p>
<p>general intelligence system, do you think figuring out how to build artificial consciousness</p>
<p>would help you get to an AGI?</p>
<p>So or put another way, do you think intelligent requires consciousness?</p>
<p>In human, it goes hand in hand.</p>
<p>In human, or I think in biology, consciousness, intelligence goes hand in hand, quay is illusion</p>
<p>because the brain evolved to be highly complex, complexity via the theory integrated information</p>
<p>theory is sort of ultimately is what is closely tied to consciousness.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s causal power upon itself.</p>
<p>And so in evolved systems, they go together.</p>
<p>In artificial system, particularly in digital machines, they do not go together.</p>
<p>And if you ask me point blank, is Alexa 20.0 in the year 2040, when she can easily pass</p>
<p>every Turing test, is she conscious?</p>
<p>No, even if she claims she&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>In fact, you could even do a more radical version of this thought experiment.</p>
<p>You can build a computer simulation of the human brain.</p>
<p>You know what Henry Markham in the Blue Brain Project or the Human Brain Project in Switzerland</p>
<p>is trying to do.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s grant them all the success.</p>
<p>So in 10 years, we have this perfect simulation of the human brain.</p>
<p>Every neuron is simulated and it has a larynx and it has motor neurons.</p>
<p>It has a Broca&rsquo;s area and of course they&rsquo;ll talk and they&rsquo;ll say, hi, I just woke up.</p>
<p>I feel great.</p>
<p>OK, even that computer simulation that can in principle map onto your brain will not</p>
<p>be conscious.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it simulates, it&rsquo;s a difference between the simulated and the real.</p>
<p>So it simulates the behavior associated with consciousness.</p>
<p>It might be, it will, if it&rsquo;s done properly, will have all the intelligence that that particular</p>
<p>person they&rsquo;re simulating has.</p>
<p>But simulating intelligence is not the same as having conscious experiences.</p>
<p>And I give you a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists typically get.</p>
<p>I can write down Einstein&rsquo;s field equation, nine or ten equations that describe the link</p>
<p>in general relativity between curvature and mass.</p>
<p>I can do that.</p>
<p>I can run this on my laptop to predict that the central, the black hole at the center</p>
<p>of our galaxy will be so massive that it will twist space time around it so no light can</p>
<p>escape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a black hole.</p>
<p>But funny, have you ever wondered why doesn&rsquo;t this computer simulation suck me in?</p>
<p>It simulates gravity, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the causal power of gravity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge difference.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a difference between the real and the simulator, just like it doesn&rsquo;t get wet</p>
<p>inside a computer when the computer runs code that simulates a weather storm.</p>
<p>And so in order to have, to have artificial consciousness, you have to give it the same</p>
<p>causal power as the human brain.</p>
<p>You have to build so called a neuromorphic machine that has hardware that is very similar</p>
<p>to the human brain, not a digital clocked phenomenon computer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, just to clarify though, you think that consciousness is not required to create</p>
<p>human level intelligence.</p>
<p>It seems to accompany in the human brain, but for machine not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>So maybe just because this is AGI, let&rsquo;s dig in a little bit about what we mean by intelligence.</p>
<p>So one thing is the G factor, these kind of IQ tests of intelligence.</p>
<p>But I think if you, maybe another way to say, so in 2040, 2050, people will have Siri that</p>
<p>is just really impressive.</p>
<p>Do you think people will say Siri is intelligent?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Intelligence is this amorphous thing.</p>
<p>So to be intelligent, it seems like you have to have some kind of connections with other</p>
<p>human beings in a sense that you have to impress them with your intelligence.</p>
<p>And there feels, you have to somehow operate in this world full of humans.</p>
<p>And for that, there feels like there has to be something like consciousness.</p>
<p>So you think you can have just the world&rsquo;s best natural NLP system, natural language</p>
<p>understanding generation, and that will be, that will get us happy and say, you know what,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve created an AGI.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know happy, but yes, I do believe we can get what we call high level functional</p>
<p>intelligence, particular sort of the G, you know, this fluid like intelligence that we</p>
<p>cherish, particularly at a place like MIT, right, in machines.</p>
<p>I see a priori no reasons, and I see a lot of reason to believe it&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>very, you know, over the next 50 years or 30 years.</p>
<p>So for beneficial AI, for creating an AI system that&rsquo;s, so you mentioned ethics, that is exceptionally</p>
<p>intelligent but also does not do, does, you know, aligns its values with our values as</p>
<p>humanity.</p>
<p>Do you think then it needs consciousness?</p>
<p>Yes, I think that that is a very good argument that if we&rsquo;re concerned about AI and the threat</p>
<p>of AI, a la Nick Bostrom, existentialist threat, I think having an intelligence that has empathy,</p>
<p>right, why do we find abusing a dog, why do most of us find that abhorrent, abusing any</p>
<p>animal, right?</p>
<p>Why do we find that abhorrent because we have this thing called empathy, which if you look</p>
<p>at the Greek really means feeling with, I feel a path of empathy, I have feeling with</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>I see somebody else suffer that isn&rsquo;t even my conspecific, it&rsquo;s not a person, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>my wife or my kids, it&rsquo;s a dog, but I feel naturally most of us, not all of us, most</p>
<p>of us will feel emphatic.</p>
<p>And so it may well be in the long term interest of survival of homo sapiens sapiens that if</p>
<p>we do build AGI and it really becomes very powerful that it has an emphatic response</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t just exterminate humanity.</p>
<p>So as part of the full conscious experience to create a consciousness, artificial or in</p>
<p>our human consciousness, do you think fear, maybe we&rsquo;re going to get into the earlier</p>
<p>days with Nietzsche and so on, but do you think fear and suffering are essential to</p>
<p>have consciousness?</p>
<p>Do you have to have the full range of experience to have a system that has experience or can</p>
<p>you have a system that only has very particular kinds of very positive experiences?</p>
<p>Look you can have in principle, people have done this in the rat where you implant an</p>
<p>electrode in the hypothalamus, the pleasure center of the rat and the rat stimulates itself</p>
<p>above and beyond anything else.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t care about food or natural sex or drink anymore, it just stimulates itself</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a pleasurable feeling.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s like an orgasm just you have all day long.</p>
<p>And so a priori I see no reason why you need a great variety.</p>
<p>Now clearly to survive that wouldn&rsquo;t work, right?</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;d engineered artificially, I don&rsquo;t think you need a great variety of conscious</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>You could have just pleasure or just fear.</p>
<p>It might be a terrible existence, but I think that&rsquo;s possible at least on conceptual logical</p>
<p>ground.</p>
<p>Because any real creature whether artificially engineered, you want to give it fear, the</p>
<p>fear of extinction that we all have.</p>
<p>And you also want to give it positive repetitive states, states that you want the machine encouraged</p>
<p>to do because they give the machine positive feedback.</p>
<p>So you mentioned panpsychism, to jump back a little bit, everything having some kind</p>
<p>of mental property.</p>
<p>How do you go from there to something like human consciousness?</p>
<p>So everything having some elements of consciousness, is there something special about human consciousness?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not everything.</p>
<p>Like a spoon, the form of panpsychism I think about doesn&rsquo;t ascribe consciousness to anything</p>
<p>like this, the spoon on my liver.</p>
<p>However, the theory, the integrated information theory does say that the system, even one</p>
<p>that looks from the outside relatively simple, at least if they have this internal causal</p>
<p>power, it does feel like something.</p>
<p>The theory a priori doesn&rsquo;t say anything what&rsquo;s special about human.</p>
<p>Biologically we know the one thing that&rsquo;s special about human is we speak and we have</p>
<p>an overblown sense of our own importance.</p>
<p>We believe we&rsquo;re exceptional and we&rsquo;re just God&rsquo;s gift to the universe.</p>
<p>But behaviorally the main thing that we have, we can plan over the long term, we have language</p>
<p>and that gives us an enormous amount of power and that&rsquo;s why we are the current dominant</p>
<p>species on the planet.</p>
<p>So you mentioned God, you grew up a devout Roman Catholic family, so with consciousness</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sort of exploring some really deeply fundamental human things that religion also</p>
<p>touches on.</p>
<p>Where does religion fit into your thinking about consciousness?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve grown throughout your life and changed your views on religion as far as I understand.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean I&rsquo;m now much closer to, I&rsquo;m not a Roman Catholic anymore, I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s sort of this God, the God I was educated to believe in, sits somewhere in the fullness</p>
<p>of time, I&rsquo;ll be united in some sort of everlasting bliss, I just don&rsquo;t see any evidence for that.</p>
<p>Look, the world, the night is large and full of wonders, there are many things that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand, I think many things that we as a cult, look we don&rsquo;t even understand more</p>
<p>than 4% of all the universe, dark matter, dark energy, we have no idea what it is, maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s lost socks, what do I know?</p>
<p>So all I can tell you is it&rsquo;s sort of my current religious or spiritual sentiment is much closer</p>
<p>to some form of Buddhism, without the reincarnation unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no evidence for it</p>
<p>than reincarnation.</p>
<p>So can you describe the way Buddhism sees the world a little bit?</p>
<p>Well so they talk about, so when I spent several meetings with the Dalai Lama and what always</p>
<p>impressed me about him, he really, unlike for example let&rsquo;s say the Pope or some Cardinal,</p>
<p>he always emphasized minimizing the suffering of all creatures.</p>
<p>So they have this, from the early beginning they look at suffering in all creatures, not</p>
<p>just in people, but in everybody, this universal and of course by degrees, an animal in general</p>
<p>is less capable of suffering than a well developed, normally developed human and they think consciousness</p>
<p>pervades in this universe and they have these techniques, you can think of them like mindfulness</p>
<p>etc. and meditation that tries to access what they claim of this more fundamental aspect</p>
<p>of reality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s more fundamental, I think about it, there&rsquo;s the physical and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this inside view, consciousness and those are the two aspects that&rsquo;s the only thing</p>
<p>I have access to in my life and you&rsquo;ve got to remember my conscious experience and your</p>
<p>conscious experience comes prior to anything you know about physics, comes prior to knowledge</p>
<p>about the universe and atoms and super strings and molecules and all of that.</p>
<p>The only thing you directly are acquainted with is this world that&rsquo;s populated with things</p>
<p>in images and sounds in your head and touches and all of that.</p>
<p>I actually have a question, so it sounds like you kind of have a rich life, you talk about</p>
<p>rock climbing and it seems like you really love literature and consciousness is all about</p>
<p>experiencing things, so do you think that has helped your research on this topic?</p>
<p>Yes, particularly if you think about it, the various states, so for example when you do</p>
<p>rock climbing or now I do rowing, crew rowing and a bike every day, you can get into this</p>
<p>thing called the zone and I&rsquo;ve always wanted about it, particularly with respect to consciousness</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a strangely addictive state.</p>
<p>Once people have it once, they want to keep on going back to it and you wonder what is</p>
<p>it so addicting about it and I think it&rsquo;s the experience of almost close to pure experience</p>
<p>because in this zone, you&rsquo;re not conscious of inner voice anymore, there&rsquo;s always inner</p>
<p>voice nagging you, you have to do this, you have to do that, you have to pay your taxes,</p>
<p>you have to fight with your ex and all of those things, they&rsquo;re always there.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re in the zone, all of that is gone and you&rsquo;re just in this wonderful state</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re fully out in the world, you&rsquo;re climbing or you&rsquo;re rowing or biking or doing</p>
<p>soccer or whatever you&rsquo;re doing and sort of consciousness is this, you&rsquo;re all action or</p>
<p>in this case of pure experience, you&rsquo;re not action at all but in both cases, you experience</p>
<p>some aspect of conscious, you touch some basic part of conscious existence that is so basic</p>
<p>and so deeply satisfying.</p>
<p>You I think you touch the root of being, that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re touching there, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting close to the root of being and that&rsquo;s very different from intelligence.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the simulation hypothesis, simulation theory, the idea that</p>
<p>we all live in a computer simulation?</p>
<p>Rapture for nerds.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s as likely as the hypothesis had engaged hundreds of scholars for many centuries,</p>
<p>are we all just existing in the mind of God?</p>
<p>And this is just a modern version of it, it&rsquo;s equally plausible.</p>
<p>People love talking about these sort of things, I know they&rsquo;re book written about this simulation</p>
<p>hypothesis, if that&rsquo;s what people want to do, that&rsquo;s fine, it seems rather esoteric,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never testable.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not useful for you to think of in those terms, so maybe connecting to the questions</p>
<p>of free will which you&rsquo;ve talked about, I vaguely remember you saying that the idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no free will, it makes you very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So what do you think about free will from a physics perspective, from a conscious perspective,</p>
<p>what does it all fit?</p>
<p>Okay, so from the physics perspective, leaving aside quantum mechanics, we believe we live</p>
<p>in a fully deterministic world, right?</p>
<p>But then comes of course quantum mechanics, so now we know that certain things are in</p>
<p>principle not predictable, which as you said I prefer, because the idea that the initial</p>
<p>condition of the universe and then everything else, we&rsquo;re just acting out the initial condition</p>
<p>of the universe, that doesn&rsquo;t‚Ä¶</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a romantic notion.</p>
<p>Certainly not.</p>
<p>Now when it comes to consciousness, I think we do have certain freedom.</p>
<p>We are much more constrained by physics of course and by our past and by our own conscious</p>
<p>desires and what our parents told us and what our environment tells us.</p>
<p>We all know that, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hundreds of experiments that show how we can be influenced.</p>
<p>But finally in the final analysis, when you make a life ‚Äì and I&rsquo;m talking really about</p>
<p>critical decision where you really think, should I marry, should I go to this school</p>
<p>or that school, should I take this job or that job, should I cheat on my taxes or not?</p>
<p>These are things where you really deliberate and I think under those conditions, you are</p>
<p>as free as you can be.</p>
<p>When you bring your entire being, your entire conscious being to that question and try to</p>
<p>analyze it under all the various conditions, then you make a decision, you are as free</p>
<p>as you can ever be.</p>
<p>That is I think what free will is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a will that&rsquo;s totally free to do anything it wants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So as Jack mentioned, you actually write a blog about books you&rsquo;ve read, amazing books</p>
<p>from, I&rsquo;m Russian, from Bulgakov, Neil Gaiman, Carl Sagan, Murakami.</p>
<p>So what is a book that early in your life transformed the way you saw the world, something</p>
<p>that changed your life?</p>
<p>Nietzsche I guess did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Brooks R. Truster because he talks about some of these problems.</p>
<p>He was one of the first discoverer of the unconscious.</p>
<p>This is a little bit before Freud when he was in the air.</p>
<p>He makes all these claims that people sort of under the guise or under the mass of charity</p>
<p>actually are very noncharitable.</p>
<p>So he is sort of really the first discoverer of the great land of the unconscious and that</p>
<p>really struck me.</p>
<p>And what do you think about the unconscious, what do you think about Freud, what do you</p>
<p>think about these ideas?</p>
<p>Just like dark matter in the universe, what&rsquo;s over there in that unconscious?</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>I mean much more than we think.</p>
<p>This is what a lot of last 100 years of research has shown.</p>
<p>So I think he was a genius, misguided towards the end, but he started out as a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>He contributed, he did the studies on the lamprey, he contributed himself to the neuron</p>
<p>hypothesis, the idea that there are discrete units that we call nerve cells now.</p>
<p>And then he wrote about the unconscious and I think it&rsquo;s true, there&rsquo;s lots of stuff happening.</p>
<p>You feel this particular when you&rsquo;re in a relationship and it breaks asunder, right?</p>
<p>And then you have this terrible, you can have love and hate and lust and anger and all of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mixed in.</p>
<p>And when you try to analyze yourself, why am I so upset?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very difficult to penetrate to those basements, those caverns in your mind</p>
<p>because the prying eyes of conscious doesn&rsquo;t have access to those, but they&rsquo;re there in</p>
<p>the amygdala or lots of other places.</p>
<p>They make you upset or angry or sad or depressed and it&rsquo;s very difficult to try to actually</p>
<p>uncover the reason.</p>
<p>You can go to a shrink, you can talk with your friend endlessly, you construct finally</p>
<p>a story why this happened, why you love her or don&rsquo;t love her or whatever, but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know whether that actually happened because you simply don&rsquo;t have access to those</p>
<p>parts of the brain and they&rsquo;re very powerful.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a feature or a bug of our brain?</p>
<p>The fact that we have this deep, difficult to dive into subconscious?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a feature because otherwise, look, we are like any other brain or nervous</p>
<p>system or computer, we are severely band limited.</p>
<p>If everything I do, every emotion I feel, every eye movements I make, if all of that</p>
<p>had to be under the control of consciousness, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>What you do early on, your brain, you have to be conscious when you learn things like</p>
<p>typing or like riding on a bike, but then what you do, you train up routes, I think</p>
<p>that involve basal ganglia and striatum.</p>
<p>You train up different parts of your brain and then once you do it automatically like</p>
<p>typing, you can show you do it much faster without even thinking about it because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got these highly specialized, what Frans Krik and I call zombie agents, they&rsquo;re taking care</p>
<p>of that while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of the text</p>
<p>you want to write.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true for many, many things.</p>
<p>But for the things like all the fights you had with an ex girlfriend, things that you</p>
<p>would think are not useful to still linger somewhere in the subconscious.</p>
<p>So that seems like a bug that it would stick to there.</p>
<p>You think it would be better if you can analyze it and then get it out of the system.</p>
<p>Better to get it out of the system or just forget it ever happened.</p>
<p>That seems a very buggy kind of.</p>
<p>Well yeah, in general we don&rsquo;t have, and that&rsquo;s probably functional, we don&rsquo;t have an ability</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s extreme, there are cases, clinical dissociations, right?</p>
<p>When people are heavily abused, when they completely repress the memory, but that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happen in normal people.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have an ability to remove traumatic memories and of course we suffer from that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, probably if you had the ability to constantly wipe your memory, you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>probably do it to an extent that isn&rsquo;t useful to you.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a good question to balance.</p>
<p>So on the books, as Jack mentioned, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but broadly speaking, academia</p>
<p>and the different scientific disciplines, certainly in engineering, reading literature</p>
<p>seems to be a rare pursuit.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m wrong on this, but that&rsquo;s in my experience, most people read much more technical text</p>
<p>and do not sort of escape or seek truth in literature.</p>
<p>It seems like you do.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the value, what do you think literature adds to the pursuit of</p>
<p>scientific truth?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s useful for everybody?</p>
<p>Gives you access to a much wider array of human experiences.</p>
<p>How valuable do you think it is?</p>
<p>Well if you want to understand human nature and nature in general, then I think you have</p>
<p>to better understand a wide variety of experiences, not just sitting in a lab staring at a screen</p>
<p>and having a face flashed onto you for a hundred milliseconds and pushing a button.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I used to do, that&rsquo;s what most psychologists do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, but you need to consider lots of other strange states.</p>
<p>And literature is a shortcut for this.</p>
<p>Well yeah, because literature, that&rsquo;s what literature is all about, all sorts of interesting</p>
<p>experiences that people have, the contingency of it, the fact that women experience the</p>
<p>world different, black people experience the world different.</p>
<p>The one way to experience that is reading all these different literature and try to</p>
<p>find out.</p>
<p>You see, everything is so relative.</p>
<p>You read a book 300 years ago, they thought about certain problems very, very differently</p>
<p>than us today.</p>
<p>We today, like any culture, think we know it all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s common to every culture.</p>
<p>Every culture believes at its heyday they know it all.</p>
<p>And then you realize, well, there&rsquo;s other ways of viewing the universe and some of them</p>
<p>may have lots of things in their favor.</p>
<p>So this is a question I wanted to ask about time scale or scale in general.</p>
<p>When you, with IIT or in general, try to think about consciousness, try to think about these</p>
<p>ideas, we kind of naturally think in human time scales, and also entities that are sized</p>
<p>close to humans.</p>
<p>Do you think of things that are much larger and much smaller as containing consciousness?</p>
<p>And do you think of things that take, you know, eons to operate in their conscious cause</p>
<p>effect?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>So I think a lot about small creatures because experimentally, you know, a lot of people</p>
<p>work on flies and bees, right?</p>
<p>So most people just think they are automata, they&rsquo;re just bugs for heaven&rsquo;s sake, right?</p>
<p>But if you look at their behavior, like bees, they can recognize individual humans.</p>
<p>They have this very complicated way to communicate.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been involved or you know your parents when they bought a house, what sort</p>
<p>of agonizing decision that is.</p>
<p>And bees have to do that once a year, right, when they swarm in the spring.</p>
<p>And then they have this very elaborate way, they have free and scouts, they go to the</p>
<p>individual sites, they come back, they have this power, this dance, literally, where they</p>
<p>dance for several days, they try to recruit other deets, this very complicated decision</p>
<p>rate, when they finally, once they make a decision, the entire swarm, the scouts warm</p>
<p>up the entire swarm and then go to one location.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go to 50 locations, they go to one location that the scouts have agreed upon</p>
<p>by themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>If we look at the circuit complexity, it&rsquo;s 10 times more denser than anything we have</p>
<p>in our brain.</p>
<p>Now they only have a million neurons, but the neurons are amazingly complex.</p>
<p>Complex behavior, very complicated circuitry, so there&rsquo;s no question they experience something,</p>
<p>their life is very different, they&rsquo;re tiny, they only live, you know, for, well, workers</p>
<p>live maybe for two months.</p>
<p>So I think, and IIT tells you this, in principle, the substrate of consciousness is the substrate</p>
<p>that maximizes the cause effect power over all possible spatial temporal grains.</p>
<p>So when I think about, for example, do you know the science fiction story, The Black</p>
<p>Cloud?</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s a classic by Fred Hoyle, the astronomer.</p>
<p>He has this cloud intervening between the earth and the sun and leading to some sort</p>
<p>of, to global cooling, this is written in the 50s.</p>
<p>It turns out you can, using the radio dish, they communicate with actually an entity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually an intelligent entity, and they sort of, they convince it to move away.</p>
<p>So here you have a radical different entity, and in principle, IIT says, well, you can</p>
<p>measure the integrated information, in principle at least, and yes, if the maximum of that</p>
<p>occurs at a time scale of months, rather than in assets for a fraction of a second, yes,</p>
<p>then they would experience life where each moment is a month rather than, or microsecond,</p>
<p>right, rather than a fraction of a second in the human case.</p>
<p>And so there may be forms of consciousness that we simply don&rsquo;t recognize for what they</p>
<p>are because they are so radical different from anything you and I are used to.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to read or to watch science fiction movies, well, to think</p>
<p>about this.</p>
<p>Do you know Stanislav Lem, this Polish science fiction writer, he wrote Solaris and was turned</p>
<p>into a Hollywood movie?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>His best novel is in the 60s, a very engineer, he&rsquo;s an engineer in background.</p>
<p>His most interesting novel is called The Victorious, where human civilization, they have this</p>
<p>mission to this planet and everything is destroyed and they discover machines, humans got killed</p>
<p>and then these machines took over and there was this machine evolution, Darwinian evolution,</p>
<p>he talks about this very vividly.</p>
<p>And finally, the dominant machine intelligence organism that survived were gigantic clouds</p>
<p>of little hexagonal universal cellular automata.</p>
<p>This was written in the 60s, so typically they&rsquo;re all lying on the ground individual</p>
<p>by themselves, but in times of crisis, they can communicate, they assemble into gigantic</p>
<p>nets into clouds of trillions of these particles and then they become hyper intelligent and</p>
<p>they can beat anything that humans can throw at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very beautiful and compelling where you have an intelligence where finally the humans</p>
<p>leave the planet, they&rsquo;re simply unable to understand and comprehend this creature.</p>
<p>They can say, well, either we can nuke the entire planet and destroy it or we just have</p>
<p>to leave because fundamentally it&rsquo;s an alien, it&rsquo;s so alien from us and our ideas that we</p>
<p>cannot communicate with them.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually in conversation, so you&rsquo;re talking to us, Steven Wolf from Brought Up</p>
<p>is that there could be ideas that you already have these artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>like super smart or maybe conscious beings in the cellular automata, we just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to talk to them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the language of communication, but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one sort of view is consciousness is only something you can measure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not conscious if you can&rsquo;t measure it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re making an ontological and an epistemic statement.</p>
<p>One is it&rsquo;s just like seeing the multiverses, that might be true, but I can&rsquo;t communicate</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have any knowledge of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an epistemic argument.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So those are two different things.</p>
<p>So it may well be possible.</p>
<p>Look, in another case that&rsquo;s happening right now, people are building these mini organoids.</p>
<p>Do you know what this is?</p>
<p>So you can take stem cells from under your arm, put it in a dish, add four transcription</p>
<p>factors and then you can induce them to grow into large, well, large, they&rsquo;re a few millimeters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like a half a million neurons that look like nerve cells in a dish called mini</p>
<p>organoids at Harvard, at Stanford, everywhere they&rsquo;re building them.</p>
<p>It may well be possible that they&rsquo;re beginning to feel like something, but we can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>communicate with them right now.</p>
<p>So people are beginning to think about the ethics of this.</p>
<p>So yes, he may be perfectly right, but it&rsquo;s one question, are they conscious or not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a totally separate question.</p>
<p>How would I know?</p>
<p>Those are two different things.</p>
<p>If you could give advice to a young researcher, sort of dreaming of understanding or creating</p>
<p>human level intelligence or consciousness, what would you say?</p>
<p>Just follow your dreams.</p>
<p>Read widely.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I suppose with discipline, what is the pursuit that they should take on?</p>
<p>Is it neuroscience?</p>
<p>Is it computational cognitive science?</p>
<p>Is it philosophy?</p>
<p>Is it computer science or robotics?</p>
<p>No, in a sense that, okay, so the only known system that have high level of intelligence</p>
<p>is homo sapiens.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to build it, it&rsquo;s probably good to continue to study closely what humans</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>So cognitive neuroscience, you know, somewhere between cognitive neuroscience on the one hand</p>
<p>and some philosophy of mind and then AI, AI computer science.</p>
<p>You can look at all the original ideas in your network, they all came from neuroscience,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Reinforce whether it&rsquo;s Snarky, Minsky building is Snarky or whether it&rsquo;s, you know, the early</p>
<p>Hubel and Wiesel experiments at Harvard that then gave rise to networks and then multi</p>
<p>layer networks.</p>
<p>So it may well be possible, in fact, some people argue that to make the next big step</p>
<p>in AI once we realize the limits of deep convolutional networks, they can do certain things, but</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, they can&rsquo;t really, I can&rsquo;t really show them one image.</p>
<p>I can show you a single image of somebody, a pickpocket who steals a wallet from a purse.</p>
<p>You immediately know that&rsquo;s a pickpocket.</p>
<p>Now computer system would just say, well, it&rsquo;s a man, it&rsquo;s a woman, it&rsquo;s a purse, right?</p>
<p>Unless you train this machine on showing it a hundred thousand pickpockets, right?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have this easy understanding that you have, right?</p>
<p>So some people make the argument in order to go to the next step or you really want</p>
<p>to build machines that understand in a way you and I, we have to go to psychology.</p>
<p>We need to understand how we do it and how our brains enable us to do it.</p>
<p>And so therefore being on the cusp, it&rsquo;s also so exciting to try to understand better our</p>
<p>nature and then to build, to take some of those inside and build them.</p>
<p>So I think the most exciting thing is somewhere in the interface between cognitive science,</p>
<p>neuroscience, AI, computer science and philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say if there is from the machine learning, from our, from the computer science, computer</p>
<p>vision perspective, many of the researchers kind of ignore the way the human brain works</p>
<p>or even psychology or literature or studying the brain, I would hope Josh Tenenbaum talks</p>
<p>about bringing that in more and more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, yeah, so you&rsquo;ve worked on some amazing stuff throughout your life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the thing that you&rsquo;re really excited about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the mystery that you would love to uncover in the near term beyond, beyond all</p>
<p>the mysteries that you&rsquo;re already surrounded by?</p>
<p>Well, so there&rsquo;s a structure called the claustrum.</p>
<p>This is a structure, it&rsquo;s underneath our cortex, it&rsquo;s yay big.</p>
<p>You have one on the left, on the right, underneath this, underneath the insula, it&rsquo;s very thin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one millimeter, it&rsquo;s embedded in, in wiring, in white matter, so it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to image.</p>
<p>And it has, it has connection to every cortical region.</p>
<p>And Francis Crick, the last paper he ever wrote, he dictated corrections the day he</p>
<p>died in hospital on this paper.</p>
<p>You know, we hypothesize, well, because it has this unique anatomy, it gets input from</p>
<p>every cortical area and projects back to every, every cortical area.</p>
<p>That the function of this structure is similar, it&rsquo;s just a metaphor to the role of a conductor</p>
<p>in a symphony orchestra.</p>
<p>You have all the different cortical players.</p>
<p>You have some that do motion, some that do theory of mind, some that infer social interaction</p>
<p>and color and hearing and all the different modules in cortex.</p>
<p>But of course, what consciousness is, consciousness puts it all together into one package, right?</p>
<p>The binding problem, all of that.</p>
<p>And this is really the function because it has relatively few neurons compared to cortex,</p>
<p>but it talks, it receives input from all of them and it projects back to all of them.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re testing that right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got this beautiful neuronal reconstruction in the mouse called crown of thorns, crown</p>
<p>of thorns neurons that are in the claustrum that have the most widespread connection of</p>
<p>any neuron I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very, you have individual neurons that sit in the claustrum tiny, but then they</p>
<p>have this single neuron, they have this huge axonal tree that cover both ipsy and contralateral</p>
<p>cortex and trying to turn using, you know, fancy tools like optogenetics, trying to turn</p>
<p>those neurons on or off and study it, what happens in the, in the mouse.</p>
<p>So this thing is perhaps where the parts become the whole.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s one of the structures, it&rsquo;s a very good way of putting it, where the individual</p>
<p>parts turn into the whole of the whole of the conscious experience.</p>
<p>Well, with that, thank you very much for being here today.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>All right, thank you very much.</p>
