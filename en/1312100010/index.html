<p>Daddy, do I call her daddy?</p>
<p>Call her daddy.</p>
<p>The daddies are back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hump day, baby.</p>
<p>What is up guys?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Alex and Sophia back at it again.</p>
<p>0:24</p>
<p>Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>I was gonna say with another episode of call her daddy, but the bitch cut me off.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How are you doing today?</p>
<p>Sofia?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling great.</p>
<p>But I am a little bit fucking annoyed.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because people keep writing into US Alex saying that they find our podcast defensive and offensive.</p>
<p>0:43</p>
<p>No shit.</p>
<p>No shit.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t even know what to tell these people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like go watch Sesame Street, but can jack off to Big Bird, or whatever you need to do big for Des House of Pies on him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some goddamn it.</p>
<p>0:59</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s thicker than his, he hicker.</p>
<p>He totally is about that.</p>
<p>Thick thick, guys.</p>
<p>Just I&rsquo;m over.</p>
<p>You telling me that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s offensive.</p>
<p>We got it.</p>
<p>Go listen to something else.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why people are so offended.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, guys, you all you have to do is read the Titles and then don&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p>1:17</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s like sex me so I know it&rsquo;s real put it in the ass.</p>
<p>So I know we&rsquo;re working with stuff like why?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We have that one yet, but maybe episode 11, we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So yeah, I agree, guys.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with our podcast back the fuck up.</p>
<p>And if you are part of the daddy king, hello, Daddy, we&rsquo;re back guys.</p>
<p>1:36</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s episode 10.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>That is pretty cool.</p>
<p>We would ever get here.</p>
<p>You knew I loved every one and done one and that&rsquo;s what a lot of people do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like you guys aren&rsquo;t going to be able to sustain this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way you guys are going to be able to keep doing this to that.</p>
<p>I say we are here and we&rsquo;re going to be here for a while.</p>
<p>1:54</p>
<p>At first, I thought you were going to say one and done is what everyone tells you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t they want me one on there silently, higher up to say that.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, okay to that.</p>
<p>I always say, SMA.</p>
<p>Do you know, SMA is suck my ass.</p>
<p>2:09</p>
<p>You guys should start using that.</p>
<p>I think it kind of like gets people aroused but also takes them back.</p>
<p>So anyways, I want to get into Something that you and I were talking about on the subway this morning and that is our apartment, our fire department.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about last week.</p>
<p>2:26</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So one of us brought a man home, I&rsquo;m not going to name names, right?</p>
<p>Someone in this room.</p>
<p>Honestly, actually, I had the way this intro is going.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to cut you off and say it was me.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I was on the brought the fucking guy back.</p>
<p>No need to sugarcoat it.</p>
<p>2:42</p>
<p>Alex Cooper.</p>
<p>That was not Sofia.</p>
<p>Franklin, Aloysius.</p>
<p>Throughout a guy back.</p>
<p>So if you would never do such a thing Nevers, our apartment, well, okay, our apartment in our drum kit like that.</p>
<p>I have to say, I was in my drunkest date.</p>
<p>We have an unsaid thing about our apartment that we never bring people back.</p>
<p>2:59</p>
<p>Yes, people from the outside world are not allowed to enter our apartment.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I must have been some type of fucked up.</p>
<p>The lighting guy come back.</p>
<p>We do not let Outsiders into our apartment, why?</p>
<p>Because our apartment is actually defying.</p>
<p>3:15</p>
<p>So the fact that you brought a man home.</p>
<p>Alex is shocking to me, like you must have been laughing a lockout.</p>
<p>I was oh my.</p>
<p>So all right our apartment guys, if you don&rsquo;t live in New York City, I know a lot of people are like, oh my God, New York, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And it is awesome to live in New York City.</p>
<p>3:32</p>
<p>However, the way we are living may not specifically be that lux live in you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>I think like we need to paint a picture.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, when I say that our apartment is fully furnished from things that I found in the trash.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not know you&rsquo;re not lying.</p>
<p>3:48</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not lying know every single thing.</p>
<p>But we can I confirm because people who don&rsquo;t live in New York, like it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re dumpster-diving up in this bitch.</p>
<p>Like there are just things that are on the side of the road, right fully like completely new outfit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave everything on the side of the road because it&rsquo;s to no one has a car here.</p>
<p>4:05</p>
<p>Yeah the moving truck.</p>
<p>Yeah better.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about talk about the rug.</p>
<p>What about let&rsquo;s get into the rug.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that kind of like gives an encompassing idea of what are their drug?</p>
<p>We have this big beautiful.</p>
<p>Luxurious rug that we took from the trash.</p>
<p>I am just realizing we sound actually disgusting but the rug was cute.</p>
<p>4:23</p>
<p>Okay, I probably while it&rsquo;s like a little white shag rug I finally was able to convince Alex and Lauren or other roommate to shake the rug out because it needed a good shaking because I knew that there were some things in there.</p>
<p>4:38</p>
<p>It got to the point Alex, where if I lost like a piece of jewelry, I would ask Alex.</p>
<p>And what would you tell my big?</p>
<p>Did you check the rug?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fucking now.</p>
<p>Did he?</p>
<p>So we finally shook this rug out?</p>
<p>Yeah, we did when I tell you, $72 worth of change.</p>
<p>4:54</p>
<p>Came flying out like eight Cheetos.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the bread of hair.</p>
<p>Oh, you can make hair extensions with the amount of hair that came out of that round.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So moral of the story is that just gives you an idea of its gross.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Our bathroom.</p>
<p>5:11</p>
<p>Now, this is how it ties into this story from last week of the guy coming over our Bathroom the ceiling happened to be leaking shit and pee.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p>And so our landlord doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh there&rsquo;s rain.</p>
<p>5:26</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come in a couple days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get it.</p>
<p>And we had to put a pot to catch the Pooh and the Pea.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>Okay, so I wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>I feel someone leave my bed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know who is in my bad.</p>
<p>He goes to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I know concerning he goes to the bathroom.</p>
<p>5:42</p>
<p>He comes back from the bathroom at this point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Done that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even a human in our apartment.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really register what he&rsquo;s saying and he just looks at me and he says your bathroom is so scary.</p>
<p>But I also think that the smell of your overall apartment may be scarier.</p>
<p>6:03</p>
<p>I just about died.</p>
<p>That is the most horrible embarrassing thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>What do you say when something like that happens?</p>
<p>I legit looked at him and I kind of like smirked gave him, the peace sign and Him in his shoes and he walked out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll, I don&rsquo;t fucking believe that you let him stay over.</p>
<p>6:20</p>
<p>Oh, I know, because guess what happened?</p>
<p>Guys, Sophia happen to be coming in early 7 a.m.</p>
<p>Morning, wherever you that nice Sophia leaving the gym, stupid.</p>
<p>She was very responsible, and not bringing a man back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>And so, he ran into Sophia.</p>
<p>6:35</p>
<p>I wanted you to I ran into him and I you guys have to understand it was like, seeing a ghost because people do not come over to our apartment.</p>
<p>I was like, holy shit, Alex.</p>
<p>So in some type of way, last night.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tipped my hat to this guy&rsquo;s, he walked out this poor unfortunate soul because I knew what he had witnessed in that apartment and Alex.</p>
<p>6:56</p>
<p>I went into your room.</p>
<p>And what did I tell you?</p>
<p>She looked down at me guys, and she goes Alex, I said, I hope you know or no I said, I hope that you don&rsquo;t actually like this guy because he will never be talking to you again.</p>
<p>7:13</p>
<p>You will never be hearing.</p>
<p>From him and to this day, guys.</p>
<p>I have never heard from him again.</p>
<p>So fuck me, right?</p>
<p>Like cool, dude.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually really fucking disgusting.</p>
<p>That our apartment makes grown men.</p>
<p>Literally Haley. 35, talk to us again.</p>
<p>7:30</p>
<p>But I do have to say that there is one positive about our apartment.</p>
<p>I totally forgot about this dude&rsquo;s whom.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>If you do live in our apartment, you do get Hi for free for free 3F ree.</p>
<p>7:50</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It may not be with your consent.</p>
<p>You may not have any part of wanting to get high.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re high all the time.</p>
<p>Baby specifically at night.</p>
<p>I will be dead asleep and wake up in the middle of the night and sit up and I will be Stone.</p>
<p>8:06</p>
<p>Blazed out of your mind will be fucking Stone and this is because we have neighbors underneath us and they go out onto their deck every night.</p>
<p>And they blazed up rooms are full on hot.</p>
<p>Pop boxed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in high school.</p>
<p>8:23</p>
<p>I feel like you would like make out with a guy for a gram now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we get it for free.</p>
<p>You just gotta lay in bed and they bring it right to your door.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even I would say nine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really a huge smoker weed smoker and I guess I forgot to get hot.</p>
<p>You get the munchies.</p>
<p>8:39</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Are we gaining weight?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<p>So this past weekend, if you guys follow Me and Sophie on Instagram, which you should.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you wouldn&rsquo;t be on Instagram.</p>
<p>I posted some stories.</p>
<p>I was in Florida.</p>
<p>Soaking up the sun while Sophia&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>8:57</p>
<p>New York remaining a vampire.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so pale.</p>
<p>I know think it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So, I went to Florida and I was staying at a really nice house and we had a lot of people writing into my Instagram being like, you know, Alex tag your sponsor or like, who&rsquo;s your sponsor.</p>
<p>9:12</p>
<p>Like?</p>
<p>Oh sugar, daddy Central, which we are going.</p>
<p>To talk about in this episode, but I just want to confirm that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a sugar daddy, and that was not a sugar daddy situation.</p>
<p>The guy that I&rsquo;m talking to, you just happens to have a nice house and tell you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>9:27</p>
<p>Did he pay for your flight?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>City paper.</p>
<p>Absolutely everything that you did while you were there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, okay.</p>
<p>No, but seriously, like, listen, I just want to talk about this because I think this is something that People get a little confused with 2018 culture you and I always talk about it, girls want to assert their power and be like, no I can pay for stuff or I can pick up the bill which is totally fine.</p>
<p>9:58</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But specifically when it came to this topic, I think that I&rsquo;ve dated guys with money.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve dated guys that don&rsquo;t have money also like it goes hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I only date guys with money right?</p>
<p>Maybe I do.</p>
<p>Oh my God, you thought I was kidding, but I do think Think there is a standard that should be known of dating and whoever makes more money Etc.</p>
<p>10:22</p>
<p>Naturally is going to pay for that.</p>
<p>I know I honestly was just totally joking around.</p>
<p>I think that if you are kind of talking to someone and their income is double or triple than yours.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why they can&rsquo;t be buying your flights etcetera.</p>
<p>That is not a sugar daddy.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>10:37</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dated guys that could a four-way afford way more than me and he would do nice things and he would buy me my flights or and So, especially if he wanted to do things that were more expensive and I personally couldn&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>He would pay for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, with that being said, I think if you&rsquo;re dating someone that makes equal amount of money as you then obviously, you&rsquo;ll pick up a bill.</p>
<p>10:59</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll pick a bill unless I&rsquo;m last unless it&rsquo;s on a first date.</p>
<p>People have asked us this question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, call me old-school.</p>
<p>I think a guy needs to be picking up the check on the first day every 100 percent.</p>
<p>If I come back from the fucking bathroom, and he&rsquo;s trying to go like Dutch or Whatever.</p>
<p>11:15</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re splitting the bill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll just get the bill and then on the fuck out, and you&rsquo;ll never see me again.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think a lot of times I&rsquo;ve asked guys like what do you think about that?</p>
<p>And almost every guys like, oh, I want to pick up the bill because I think there&rsquo;s a thing about going on a date guys.</p>
<p>11:34</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the way to be the man like you want to be the man you want to take charge.</p>
<p>You want to take the bill, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think there are some guys that have written in and they&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s so If she doesn&rsquo;t even offer.</p>
<p>Well, that if you&rsquo;re gonna get her away, that amazed.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you can pick up the goddamn bill and I shall spread her legs later.</p>
<p>11:54</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call a bitch boy, and good luck in your life, bitch, boy, cuz we don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not fucking you.</p>
<p>Okay, Maggie ways, um, on the topic of sugar daddies.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, so I don&rsquo;t have one, you don&rsquo;t have one and I think, I don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>I was telling Alex, but his before we started recording, I am ready for it.</p>
<p>12:15</p>
<p>Sugar daddy.</p>
<p>I like, I want to retire.</p>
<p>I you&rsquo;ve been around the block, you&rsquo;ve seen what the world has to offer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve litter, I want to just sleep in every single day.</p>
<p>I want to be sedentary until I have like my pilates class and my brunch.</p>
<p>12:33</p>
<p>And you know, what?</p>
<p>If I have to just ride an old little pruning, dick a couple times a week, but I get to live that life to care.</p>
<p>I know like I feel like I feel like I would.</p>
<p>I do think I could have one.</p>
<p>12:50</p>
<p>Absolutely, you&rsquo;re a ho, no, but I feel like I definitely want like a couple more years in the workforce.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d like, I got it.</p>
<p>You know, my blogging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so energetic.</p>
<p>I feel like, I need like a couple more years.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Like two more years to more year and then I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over.</p>
<p>13:05</p>
<p>Yeah, your writing said he&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>
<p>So have any sugar daddies listen to our podcast.</p>
<p>I really this is a thing though, about having a sugar daddy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get into how to go.</p>
<p>Do what?</p>
<p>Yes, I have some friends that are in a situation.</p>
<p>Okay, but the thing about having them is they own your life.</p>
<p>13:24</p>
<p>They literally can pull the plug at any moment and you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>And so, you have to think about that, you know, when you&rsquo;re getting that situation, for example, I was talking to my friend earlier today, who has a sugar daddy love, and this guy is sugar daddy like millionaire, not a billionaire, but millionaire than M.</p>
<p>13:44</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s pretty rich still.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s all right, like we could be in the bees but we&rsquo;ll take the M&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Anyways, so he bought her a car.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, he bought her a Range Rover and any time they get the fight.</p>
<p>14:02</p>
<p>He literally will have his assistant go and pick up the car with his spare key and drive it off of her driveway.</p>
<p>And take it home.</p>
<p>She will literally go outside and her car will be completely.</p>
<p>Lee gone when they&rsquo;re in a fight and she&rsquo;s like, shit, I gotta go suck a dick.</p>
<p>14:19</p>
<p>Now, they get my card.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I gotta go get a bus pass for today.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that&rsquo;s the type of shit I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d like that.</p>
<p>I know they own your life.</p>
<p>And so you have to be prepared for it.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>I, oh, yeah, I was gonna say let&rsquo;s talk about how to get a sugar daddy.</p>
<p>14:34</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s typically I feel like, you know, more about this topic because because you have so many my window I&rsquo;m because you even just being from Utah.</p>
<p>You have a lot of friends that moved to Vegas.</p>
<p>Is an Ela and I feel like that culture is pretty big over there totally.</p>
<p>So if you explain to us a little bit like how does one go about getting a sugar daddy?</p>
<p>14:53</p>
<p>Because so many people have written in to the podcast and like I want to get one.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So break it down.</p>
<p>Girl.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert but I&rsquo;ve been around experts, I&rsquo;ve been exposed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I know a few years ago that website seeking Arrangements was huge.</p>
<p>15:09</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can you explain seeking Arrangements?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve literally heard of this the for the first time this year from you.</p>
<p>So, So it&rsquo;s a dating site for wealthy men.</p>
<p>A lot of times.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re older.</p>
<p>It literally has their net worth posted next to their picture next to their profile.</p>
<p>15:25</p>
<p>So, you know how much money you&rsquo;re fucking with?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m signing up right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean these guys have to pay like a certain amount of money to be to have like their profile on the website.</p>
<p>I actually I actually know a girl who found her husband on there.</p>
<p>15:41</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this shit actually happens, I will That&rsquo;s few and far between that we fuck Christian Mingle seeking Arrangement baby.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Why I hope that&rsquo;s not the way that I would suggest to do it.</p>
<p>Okay, honestly, okay.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s like one in a million chance that you find an actual guy on CGI.</p>
<p>16:00</p>
<p>And so what, what is your your way?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even give a shit.</p>
<p>Like, why am I here recording of?</p>
<p>I have a sugar, daddy?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So shut up, Rose house, apartment.</p>
<p>If you figured out, why am I pulling Cheetos out of my rug?</p>
<p>16:18</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>Okay, how do you what else?</p>
<p>Do you think I&rsquo;m having one?</p>
<p>I think one of the best ways and like a more natural way than getting online is to go to a super classy high-end restaurant.</p>
<p>Be dressed to the nines sit at the bar by yourself order yourself.</p>
<p>16:35</p>
<p>A drink.</p>
<p>Like a snack and just kind of chill there and see if you know someone approaches.</p>
<p>You, I think that&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>No, I really do.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking hot, you&rsquo;re looking approachable.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go with your friends or else you&rsquo;re not going to look approachable.</p>
<p>16:52</p>
<p>Yeah, and you just hang out there and I guarantee you that some old lonely horny man will come over to you and offer to buy you a fucking man high in her dirty martini, right?</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you feel like at that point?</p>
<p>Point girls can kind of assess the situation.</p>
<p>17:08</p>
<p>You, look at his watch, you.</p>
<p>Look at his credit card.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a black Carter or whatever.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>People are always like, how can you tell this guy has money and it&rsquo;s like, come on his drink order alone can like tell ya, his Sue?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean when you&rsquo;re meeting someone within the first five minutes of talking to someone they fuckin tell you what their job is, you know, that&rsquo;s actually true and then you know, and you get the gist of it.</p>
<p>17:30</p>
<p>Yeah, so I know and then put some GHB in his drink and take him home and get back.</p>
<p>And there you go.</p>
<p>You got a literal literal.</p>
<p>Show your daddy.</p>
<p>Okay, um, but I have to say as much as we want the sugar daddy life.</p>
<p>17:46</p>
<p>Sophia.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I know exactly why?</p>
<p>Okay, because we&rsquo;re fucking crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the issue is that these sugar daddies, they want.</p>
<p>Like a well-put-together was?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m richer.</p>
<p>18:01</p>
<p>Yeah, Mom, not drama.</p>
<p>Not a burden.</p>
<p>They have to be submissive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yeah, they want you to be submissive.</p>
<p>They also want you dressed to the nines and looking your best at every moment.</p>
<p>Every single have you forgotten my shirt.</p>
<p>I have a Cheeto staying.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re in speakers right now about alone.</p>
<p>18:19</p>
<p>Like we can&rsquo;t be sugar babies.</p>
<p>But exactly, I think that&rsquo;s a perfect transition to us being crazy.</p>
<p>Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p>Let us talk this week about something we are so passionate about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite thing.</p>
<p>18:34</p>
<p>How to out crazy.</p>
<p>The crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite Topic in the world.</p>
<p>Because Sophia, what do we say all the time?</p>
<p>You are never in the wrong.</p>
<p>Nope, you turn everything background on him?</p>
<p>No matter what it is.</p>
<p>No matter what it is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to set the scene to kind of like explain to you guys.</p>
<p>18:52</p>
<p>What is out-crazy?</p>
<p>The crazy mean?</p>
<p>I had dated this guy.</p>
<p>I knew he was being shady.</p>
<p>I knew he was probably fucking around which was fine because I was doing the same thing, but you can&rsquo;t pull a fast one on me.</p>
<p>So like the psychopath that I am.</p>
<p>19:10</p>
<p>I made up a big fat lie.</p>
<p>I faked a phone call.</p>
<p>And I watched him, see me.</p>
<p>And I did the whole like, literally, I&rsquo;m faking someone&rsquo;s on the other leg putting.</p>
<p>Yeah, no one&rsquo;s on the line, and I&rsquo;m like, no.</p>
<p>And I look so.</p>
<p>Sad, he&rsquo;s watching my face.</p>
<p>19:26</p>
<p>He looks like he&rsquo;s panicking and I get off the phone and I said, can you come sit with me?</p>
<p>I sit him down and I say to him.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe what I just heard.</p>
<p>I need you to be so honest with me right now because if you aren&rsquo;t honest with me right now, I don&rsquo;t know if we can move forward and he looks like he actually just died inside like he&rsquo;s actually just shit his pants and at this point guys, I know, I don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>19:55</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speculating and this bitch, please tell me you did the classic move or you&rsquo;re like Beebe.</p>
<p>If you confess everything right now, I promise.</p>
<p>I forgive you.</p>
<p>I promise that I need you to just be honest with me right now.</p>
<p>20:11</p>
<p>If you can be honest, we can move forward.</p>
<p>And then like, obviously, we&rsquo;re not gonna fucking oh, yeah, I&rsquo;m damn.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>I pulled a whole thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like this moment means so much to me.</p>
<p>If you can just tell me the truth and we&rsquo;re going to be okay, we can probably get through this but I need you to be honest.</p>
<p>And this guy goes into detail of how he cheated and what he was doing and how he saw how she sucked his dick.</p>
<p>20:34</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my god, bitch.</p>
<p>I knew.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>The Last Call on my phone is from CVS to come pick up my birth control.</p>
<p>Nobody called me.</p>
<p>You have no clue.</p>
<p>You just hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Nothing clinician up, maybe something and then you faked a phone call saying, you knew everything.</p>
<p>He admitted everything.</p>
<p>20:50</p>
<p>Everybody got.</p>
<p>Like I honestly had no idea and I was just going to eventually, though.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably done something since we started ranking.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s going to admit something.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t know it was that reason and that intense ha ha.</p>
<p>And there was like a dick in the vagina situation.</p>
<p>21:05</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A full Congressional here.</p>
<p>We are.</p>
<p>So I mean, I know you probably think I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what?</p>
<p>My favorite is home and it&rsquo;s the most fucked up, but I love it is faking that you have like an STD or like some type of illness classic.</p>
<p>21:23</p>
<p>I have done this before where I will be dating a guy and I will tell him.</p>
<p>Oh my God, like something just feels really off down there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having like a burning itching sensation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, too.</p>
<p>Get a fever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get chills.</p>
<p>I think I need to go to hospital.</p>
<p>21:39</p>
<p>Is there anything you need to tell me before I go to the hospital?</p>
<p>Like, I have a week to live potentially and I just want the goddamn truth, so I can die in peace.</p>
<p>I just may have behaved, literally, have two weeks to live.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>But like you literally make him think that you start thinking because then if he&rsquo;s been fucking around, he&rsquo;s not balk.</p>
<p>21:58</p>
<p>Like, do I have an SE did I give it to exactly babe?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m on my deathbed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want to say though.</p>
<p>That genius.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>How could you do this to me?</p>
<p>Why would you do this to me?</p>
<p>Wow, and then they don&rsquo;t all do because if you I mean girl a girl that works just fucking punch.</p>
<p>23:27</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually I&rsquo;ve had friends not situation where they&rsquo;re like, I was being shady.</p>

<p>No sweetie.</p>
<p>You have never given anyone anything.</p>
<p>Thing in your life he gave it to you move on.</p>
<p>So yes, basically ladies you are never denied ever in the wrong till you die.</p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You can you turn every single thing on to them.</p>
<p>I honestly, I don&rsquo;t even care if you cheated.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t care either.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t you turn it around on them.</p>
<p>You ask them, why they drove you to do some.</p>
<p>I did you push me to do such an awful young.</p>
<p>24:01</p>
<p>I had no other choice.</p>
<p>Yeah, you light up my do.</p>
<p>They literally ask them?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Would you make me do this?</p>
<p>I have to live with the Gil.</p>
<p>You made me cheat on you and now I have to feel guilty every single day.</p>
<p>Do you think I wanted to do that?</p>
<p>You think I wanted to cheat day.</p>
<p>24:16</p>
<p>I wanted to suck his dick when I have a boyfriend.</p>
<p>No, but because of how you are in this relationship, you for I hate a choice between a rock and a hard place because of what you&rsquo;ve done to my, then you say, I am ready for your apology, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>24:33</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t guarantee that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be able to forgive you for this burden that you&rsquo;ve put on me.</p>
<p>He catches you cheating.</p>
<p>He better fucking apologize within the hour and let you know how, sorry he is for, forcing you to do that.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kidding.</p>
<p>24:49</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re definitely getting on the cheating.</p>
<p>So, we were job easily, joking.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not saying gee, but we are saying be crazy as fuck.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because guys, love the crazy 100%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said it a million times something happened recently that I want to touch on tight.</p>
<p>25:05</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Olivia Culpo the most beautiful girl in the world.</p>
<p>She is drop-dead gorgeous and Instagram influencer for all of you that don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>She was dating Damien Danny Amendola.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an NFL player, right?</p>
<p>Alex.</p>
<p>Why did Danny Amendola get caught cheating on her because Olivia Coble is a predictable stable woman and she&rsquo;s boring as fuck that.</p>
<p>25:31</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry, but that is exactly what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He he recently just got caught.</p>
<p>Cheating.</p>
<p>He was on the beach with some girl.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re fucking and it was all over social media and Olivia went apeshit on social media and sold the Rolex.</p>
<p>She was gonna give him.</p>
<p>And all this shit ain&rsquo;t going crazy.</p>
<p>25:47</p>
<p>I just can tell I watch her stories all the time.</p>
<p>I see her little post.</p>
<p>She is maybe the most perfect girl, there is so wholesome family-oriented.</p>
<p>She seems like a nice sweet.</p>
<p>And again, the word stable stable girl, and that&rsquo;s why Danny doesn&rsquo;t want to fuck her brains out at night.</p>
<p>26:06</p>
<p>There is no crazy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s worried.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s predictable.</p>
<p>Listen, Olivia.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>But I just want to say that there is something you can tell via social media with couples.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s fucked up, but it&rsquo;s 2018.</p>
<p>So this is how it goes.</p>
<p>Danny Amendola and her were dating about I think like last year and then they broke up.</p>
<p>26:27</p>
<p>They got back together pretty quickly.</p>
<p>She was posting every single day, stories of them.</p>
<p>She had him all over her actual Instagram page.</p>
<p>Posting pictures.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have one goddamn picture of her.</p>
<p>I know he was probably like, why do we?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re hooking up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re fucking again.</p>
<p>26:43</p>
<p>But like, are we date?</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s posting everywhere.</p>
<p>Made herself way to available, right?</p>
<p>And like, just predictable to him.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t feel like there was any exactly you need to make your man, feel a little insecure.</p>
<p>Absolutely, always all this way, because this is the deal.</p>
<p>27:00</p>
<p>She has the perfect job.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>We always talk about traveling and like, scaring your man.</p>
<p>Olivia Culpo has the perfect job.</p>
<p>She Levels all the time and I bet not once.</p>
<p>Did she not answer her man&rsquo;s face time.</p>
<p>Did she not call him?</p>
<p>Did she do a little wave hervey?</p>
<p>27:16</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s so what we&rsquo;re saying is like Olivia&rsquo;s too predictable, right?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s not she&rsquo;s giving him no insecurities at all.</p>
<p>And I feel like guys need to kind of feel like they&rsquo;re still in the chase.</p>
<p>27:32</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t completely hobby.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t feel like they 100%.</p>
<p>Have you And not to mention.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be a bitch, but you mean to be a bitch.</p>
<p>I can just see.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gonna be a dead fish in the bedroom, crazy equates to good, embed, right?</p>
<p>Not crazy equates to a dead fish and back.</p>
<p>27:50</p>
<p>But okay, there are some girls obviously, they&rsquo;re like sweethearts in.</p>
<p>Then they get freaking the bedroom.</p>
<p>But Olivia I can just see it.</p>
<p>Like, she&rsquo;s not and meanwhile, I know the girl on the beach that he was caught cheating with is probably giving him the sloppiest nastiest blowjob that night and fucking his brains out and Olivia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>28:05</p>
<p>Not, yeah.</p>
<p>But I also think we talked about how this is a perfect example of her not playing at all hard to get with her.</p>
<p>Yeah, you need to keep your man on his toe and to Vegas.</p>
<p>They were going through a breakup.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>I remember she went to Vegas after they&rsquo;d gone through break up.</p>
<p>28:20</p>
<p>I was like looking at her story and she&rsquo;s posting herself in her hotel room, jumping up and down on the bed.</p>
<p>Pillow fight with like two other girls with little a pajama set, and a little glass of champagne.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, bitch, if you are going to A breakup and you go to Vegas, you are going to put latex on, you&rsquo;re gonna pop a molly, you&rsquo;re gonna get on the table in the middle of the club.</p>
<p>28:45</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have seven dudes in the background.</p>
<p>You can have your fucking labia out and you&rsquo;re going to record the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And put it on your story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I know.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s way too stable.</p>
<p>But woman, you gotta fuck with his head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Your fucking hotel room in your jam lie, so, I&rsquo;m sorry Olivia.</p>
<p>29:01</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re a great girl.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just too wholesome and your to stable and you need it like go.</p>
<p>Check into a psych ward and get a little freaky if you want to keep a man.</p>
<p>No, everything media Outlets like, oh my God, how could you cheat on her?</p>
<p>And meanwhile, you and I are the only podcast like I know why the fuck she got cheated on I know goddamn.</p>
<p>29:18</p>
<p>Well, wow.</p>
<p>Okay, so I am going to do a little something that I&rsquo;m pretty passionate about over here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually kind of fucking weird that I&rsquo;m saying that, but I want to talk about a topic that I think all men need to pull out your notebooks.</p>
<p>Get your notes ready and just sit back and relax as I talk to you.</p>
<p>29:37</p>
<p>About how to last longer in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>So, one of the universal problems guys have?</p>
<p>I mean, even the goddamn stallions out there, the guys who really have the stamina?</p>
<p>Okay, even they cave early every once in a while agreed.</p>
<p>29:55</p>
<p>So and we get it as girls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking hard sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys are wave.</p>
<p>I was fucking me.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to not blow my load in 30 seconds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fucking with a girl that has the God damn Voodoo clam, especially it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s no shots.</p>
<p>30:11</p>
<p>So, I recently had a guy friend who he was super depressed.</p>
<p>He was blowing his load within the first five minutes and girls were verbally expressing.</p>
<p>That was not.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And they were not satisfied.</p>
<p>Which good for these ladies.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I should absolutely.</p>
<p>I love those land.</p>
<p>30:27</p>
<p>So, he literally started training himself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;ve ever seen the goddamn Batman movie where he fights babe and Bruce Wayne is training to escape the prison.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s like how that&rsquo;s how dedicated this guy was like, fuck longer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>30:44</p>
<p>So basically I&rsquo;m going to share with you guys some things that he shared with me in order to stop suffering from nutting too early in the bedroom.</p>
<p>There are four steps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna walk through them damn slowly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>31:00</p>
<p>So number one is men.</p>
<p>Do not start in doggy style guys.</p>
<p>We all know this is the world&rsquo;s greatest position.</p>
<p>It hits all the right spots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s comfortable.</p>
<p>View for the guys wet dream, worthy.</p>
<p>31:16</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for everyone, but why set yourself up to fail like that?</p>
<p>Like be fuckin smart.</p>
<p>Be interesting to me.</p>
<p>Is that like a guy&rsquo;s favorite position for a lot of guys.</p>
<p>I think hands down that would be one of the best.</p>
<p>Also, I think it&rsquo;s just like that, the ass shot, the positioning, they wear their hands can be either.</p>
<p>31:34</p>
<p>Dick can be.</p>
<p>It works well for guys.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m just saying do not start with that or even go for that for your second position.</p>
<p>Hold off, if that&rsquo;s where you want a nut, hold off till the end.</p>
<p>So, Get in that doggy stationary.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m not gonna tell you what you want to do.</p>
<p>Whatever you got to do side missionary her, on top, whatever you got to do legs over, you.</p>
<p>31:55</p>
<p>You?</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I understand legit.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t go right to doggie number two.</p>
<p>Okay guys, give yourself a goddamn break.</p>
<p>You are not a dildo.</p>
<p>You have real emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>32:11</p>
<p>A lot of guys.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have faith.</p>
<p>Sex all the time fast-paced.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, I mean it&rsquo;s like for an extended period of time, you can&rsquo;t be doing that.</p>
<p>So after you&rsquo;ve been stroking her for let&rsquo;s say like 30 seconds pull out rub her clit right finger her kiss her give yourself a break and let yourself cool off.</p>
<p>32:29</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s honestly great for both men and women because girls need like a little break up in a little foreplay and then it helps the guy wouldn&rsquo;t I want?</p>
<p>It will help the girl eventually lead herself up to being able to come because we can&rsquo;t come as fast and you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a break and you&rsquo;re not going to not all over in 30 seconds.</p>
<p>32:46</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had guys, right in.</p>
<p>I remember a guy wrote in that said, is it okay if I pull out?</p>
<p>Because I know I&rsquo;m going to come and I go down and I eat my wife out, guys abso-fuckin&rsquo;-lutely, think about yourself, and if you reverse the roles, if a girl asks, is it okay if we&rsquo;re fucking and I go down on your dick and I just suck a little mid-set, absolutely.</p>
<p>33:07</p>
<p>Get my fucking dick wetter.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I totally.</p>
<p>So guys, give yourself a goddamn break.</p>
<p>It is, okay.</p>
<p>A to switch it up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be inside her.</p>
<p>The whole fucking time green.</p>
<p>And the minute that you have any inclination in any bone in your body that you&rsquo;re about to go, you fucking pull out and you can fake it till you make it like I just said, finger heard go for the clip.</p>
<p>33:26</p>
<p>Whatever number three to full.</p>
<p>Now this situation.</p>
<p>I think mostly applies to new sexual partners because sadly the majority of the world doesn&rsquo;t really practice safe, sex and condoms have kind of I mean, I think we can both agree.</p>
<p>33:42</p>
<p>Have become an afterthought.</p>
<p>For a lot of us, not us not but a lot of people other people other people and so if you have something, if you have someone new that you&rsquo;re fucking and that you want to laughed with we&rsquo;re fucking condom, even if it&rsquo;s literally just for the start.</p>
<p>33:59</p>
<p>It feels nowhere near as good as Ross eggs, but it&rsquo;s guaranteed to help you last longer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just really, I&rsquo;m just a messenger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t shoot the mess.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t shoot the messenger but put out a condom for the beginning.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you can always take it off.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Boom, I don&rsquo;t you sure.</p>
<p>34:15</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not supposed to be singing, keep it on.</p>
<p>I made it on.</p>
<p>Okay, so lastly is number four and I think I personally think this is a versatile, but kind of controversial method.</p>
<p>34:30</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just get a hunch.</p>
<p>Your dick super hard.</p>
<p>First.</p>
<p>Think about your grandma.</p>
<p>Did you say that an episode is like, think about your mom eating out your grandma.</p>
<p>And if you can After that, you have issues.</p>
<p>That was another way to do it.</p>
<p>34:47</p>
<p>All right, so, but for specifically, for number four, I think this is could possibly be a hundred percent the most beneficial multiple aspects.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say she&rsquo;s on her way and you have about 30 minutes till she&rsquo;s arrived.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s super hot realistically.</p>
<p>Also, you&rsquo;re probably just really, really horny.</p>
<p>35:03</p>
<p>Regardless, if she&rsquo;s hot or not.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a five.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s attend doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s natural.</p>
<p>Okay, men are naturally animalistic sex addicts embrace it, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, but hear me out.</p>
<p>All right, 30 minutes before she gets there jerk-off Busta.</p>
<p>35:20</p>
<p>No cleanup handle any leakage or residue straighten up.</p>
<p>Get your shit to back together, and then I guarantee you.</p>
<p>You will be able to get your little mini me right back up by the time and you&rsquo;ll be able to perform exceptionally.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so pleased, because then you can go that&rsquo;s basically round two for you and it&rsquo;s round one for her.</p>
<p>35:40</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know, every guy can last longer in round 2, so you guys have to be strategic about this shit.</p>
<p>Like from a female&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>All of these options to me are beautiful.</p>
<p>Because I mean, they got my male friend told me these specific test steps.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve taken have allowed all of him and his friends to basically go multiple.</p>
<p>35:59</p>
<p>With girls during sex and please show me a girl that doesn&rsquo;t want multiple rounds.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t exist God.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So if you are, if you&rsquo;re looking for a way to last longer, I encourage you guys to take one of these four steps fucking get yourself ready?</p>
<p>36:14</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t bust a goddamn nut in the first.</p>
<p>Ten minute.</p>
<p>The daddy gang fully supports guys that can go 15 to 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah, training yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, you need to start living your goddamn life.</p>
<p>I think my favorite of all of those techniques is to slow down.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>36:29</p>
<p>Pull out, pull out.</p>
<p>Yeah, give her vagina some attention, absolutely.</p>
<p>Be her butthole.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because you and I have talked about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, guys don&rsquo;t understand sometimes how much harder it is for girls to come like it.</p>
<p>We, I remember we talked about it once as an analogy.</p>
<p>36:45</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sitting next to a guy and you guys are drinking a beer, most of the times, the guy can drink the beer 10 times faster than the girl before she gets done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same thing with sex.</p>
<p>We need way more time to finish then you do so just fucking chill out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I hope that was educational.</p>
<p>37:01</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s um talk about something that queef.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about Queen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a funny word.</p>
<p>No, I think it pisses me off because so many people have written in to us and been like, oh my God, I like queefed during sex with this guy and like it was so awkward.</p>
<p>37:22</p>
<p>And the reason I think it&rsquo;s fucking awkward is because guys don&rsquo;t it what?</p>
<p>Because it sounds like a fart.</p>
<p>Art, like legit, but guys, don&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
<p>Okay, my ex-boyfriend that I referred to frequently, who was a nasty ass person.</p>
<p>37:39</p>
<p>I remember, he told me that he thinks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hot every girl, queefs because it means that he&rsquo;s fucking her hard and fucking her like a shit ton.</p>
<p>If I if you keep it means, you&rsquo;re so goddamn wet.</p>
<p>For all the guys out there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know what the fuck a queef is.</p>
<p>And you think you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, it&rsquo;s like a fart.</p>
<p>37:55</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Well, I think it just means you&rsquo;ve been fucking her for a On the right.</p>
<p>Are Potter&rsquo;s air pockets and it&rsquo;s really fucking wet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s usually when you&rsquo;re changing positions, so girls.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I just want to say guys, be fucking mature about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but because it sounds weird if anything you should be like, fuck.</p>
<p>38:14</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Secondly with regard to this.</p>
<p>I have a trick for girls a girl in college actually told me this.</p>
<p>If you are fucking with a guy for like the first time I get it, sometimes it&rsquo;s weird because you&rsquo;re not as close with them like as if It was your boyfriend like it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>38:30</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s like a one-night stand or whatever you can put your foot, like, when you&rsquo;re going to change positions, put your finger up, your vagine and like, move it from side to side, and back and forth, and you basically move out the air and then you pull it out slowly.</p>
<p>Okay, then you won&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>38:46</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I had a friend.</p>
<p>Say something to give her a shout out.</p>
<p>She would queef on demand.</p>
<p>Oh, she would like always show me and she would do it.</p>
<p>I thought it was the coolest thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fucking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his daddy or go into the bedroom and queef on demand like the daddy.</p>
<p>39:02</p>
<p>You are my God.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I think Sophie, and I talked about this earlier.</p>
<p>I want to say from now on out all the daddy gang members when they queef.</p>
<p>We are going to say, oh my God, that&rsquo;s how I know.</p>
<p>39:20</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking me.</p>
<p>Good babe.</p>
<p>And then you grab them and you put them into the next position.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you know, you&rsquo;re fucking me, right?</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Like, literally when it happens, you look at him.</p>
<p>Think up and down.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you say oh my fucking god, you&rsquo;re fucking me right?</p>
<p>Call her daddy, 100% improves a Qui.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Wait, Queen.</p>
<p>39:37</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Okay, um, that will have experience.</p>
<p>I feel like people are like, what the fuck is wrong with these girls?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about questions.</p>
<p>My favorite part.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have a couple stories.</p>
<p>We have a couple questions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get right into it.</p>
<p>39:53</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So question 1, I kept seeing this guy at every party.</p>
<p>I was at and he was incredibly good looking.</p>
<p>I knew that he was a fuccboi.</p>
<p>So honestly, I was just looking for a hookup.</p>
<p>Anyways, we&rsquo;re out this party and we ended up going back to his place together.</p>
<p>We were both pretty fucked up, but we went to his apartment and started having sex after a little while.</p>
<p>40:11</p>
<p>He tells me that he&rsquo;s about to come and he pulled out and then I kid you not.</p>
<p>He pees all over me at first.</p>
<p>I was confused thinking it was just watery calm, but then after 30 seconds under his seemingly endless stream, the smell hits me.</p>
<p>40:27</p>
<p>I jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>Bed grabbed his sheeps and white myself off and made the most awful Walk of Shame, drenched and smelling like, piss.</p>
<p>The next weekend.</p>
<p>I went to a party and he was there.</p>
<p>Of course, I had been drinking, and when I saw him, I started chanting.</p>
<p>I am a girl, not a urinal every single time.</p>
<p>40:45</p>
<p>He walked into the room.</p>
<p>Safe, to say I&rsquo;ve never spoken to a nigga to him again.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, back up.</p>
<p>So this guy was hooking up with her and then peed all over over.</p>
<p>Can you imagine?</p>
<p>I would die die.</p>
<p>41:00</p>
<p>Feel like I&rsquo;ve heard of that though, before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, guys, like feel like they&rsquo;re about to come but then they like confuse it like what having to pee I was gonna say?</p>
<p>I think specifically when you&rsquo;re fucked up.</p>
<p>Yeah girls can be the same like you.</p>
<p>You have to pee.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you also are going to come.</p>
<p>41:15</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like holy fuck.</p>
<p>But yeah should have fucking checked himself.</p>
<p>Yeah before he starts thinking, he&rsquo;s splurging on letting out a goddamn pitch case in point.</p>
<p>He was probably fucked up but like absolutely, I&rsquo;ve heard of that though.</p>
<p>Or was this guy just Into golden showers, honestly, he might you not, he didn&rsquo;t give two fucks in this girl is into it.</p>
<p>41:34</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ll be into it and I will be peeing.</p>
<p>I can I say this girl?</p>
<p>However is a fucking daddy, the fact that the next weekend, this girl pulls up to this party and she sees him and she has the balls to scream at him and say, I&rsquo;m not a fucking yearning.</p>
<p>I love her.</p>
<p>41:49</p>
<p>I love her.</p>
<p>I love is Daddy, but you have some balls on you.</p>
<p>So I respect that.</p>
<p>But so Jerry some of the best cheers to the both of you.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Question 2.</p>
<p>So, oh, I made the mistake of revealing to a psycho girl, right before I thought we were about to fuck.</p>
<p>42:05</p>
<p>Who is my condo neighbor that I thought we were going to have sex.</p>
<p>She then led me on the rest of the night.</p>
<p>And now she will randomly come over, tease me, and then she leaves.</p>
<p>I want to have sex with her, and it&rsquo;s driving me crazy.</p>
<p>What should I do shoes?</p>
<p>You done fucked up.</p>
<p>You never listen to our last episode episode 9.</p>
<p>42:24</p>
<p>We told you guys specifically says, you never let a girl know that you wanted.</p>
<p>Commander, how many times we have to tell you guys, the moment that you give her, any inclination that?</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;re fucking her?</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t want you fucking exactly.</p>
<p>It has to be like this unspoken unknown thing.</p>
<p>42:42</p>
<p>So, I think my advice for this one is you need to start being so friends, only with her when she comes over, and she tries to get up on you like, push her back.</p>
<p>Like, no, no, let&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s just, yeah, let&rsquo;s watch a movie.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s gonna be like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Because girls that are just trying to tease you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, no, no, Let&rsquo;s just be friends, like, chill.</p>
<p>42:59</p>
<p>Chill and maybe like start talking about a girl in front of her.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m trying to like hook up his one girl.</p>
<p>Like, what do you think?</p>
<p>I should do?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll fucking lose her mind and then didn&rsquo;t want to suck your dick and fuck you.</p>
<p>Okay, there you go.</p>
<p>Really love that.</p>
<p>Okay, next one.</p>
<p>So my boyfriend has been wanting me to swallow his come for a while now because he thinks it would be so sexy for me to swallow and keep on glugging.</p>
<p>43:20</p>
<p>He says, thank you for the podcast, by the way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>I let him come in my mouth, but I immediately spit it out.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to swallow it and makes me.</p>
<p>Cringe, what are your views on spit or swallow any tips?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I listen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not shitting on any girls that spit.</p>
<p>43:37</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t I think that I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why girls spit.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all I dude.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit about the guy think I&rsquo;m being rude.</p>
<p>But what I do think is if you are spitting it out because the come grosses you out.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re almost tasting it more.</p>
<p>43:54</p>
<p>Yeah, listen putting it in your mouth to spit it out if you don&rsquo;t want to taste it, but In take it like a shot.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was going to say.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to first of all recognize that when a guy&rsquo;s about to come and you&rsquo;re sucking his dick, you can kind of feel his body change a little bit tense up and his dick literally starts to pull us in a different way.</p>
<p>44:13</p>
<p>So be mindful of that and when, you know, he&rsquo;s about to come even if you ask him to like give you a little warning that he&rsquo;s about to come.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you have to deep throat because I know sometimes people girls can&rsquo;t just literally start planning the way that you&rsquo;re going up and down and sucking.</p>
<p>His dick perfectly so that when you go down, the dick is literally in the back of your throat.</p>
<p>44:34</p>
<p>And when he fucking splooge has a game is like a shot down by yourself against like it was never anywhere else literally.</p>
<p>And so, that way you don&rsquo;t have to taste it at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, legit.</p>
<p>Like we said, if you&rsquo;re taking a shot, you throw that shit to the back and it doesn&rsquo;t even touch your tongue.</p>
<p>44:49</p>
<p>Swallow.</p>
<p>It Like a Pill Down the Hatch.</p>
<p>Okay, next.</p>
<p>How do you feel about cheesy pick up lines for?</p>
<p>Bleh approach this girl to Bar saying, hey, you owe me a drink.</p>
<p>She asked me, why?</p>
<p>And I said, because I dropped mine when I saw you smooth as fuck, right?</p>
<p>45:07</p>
<p>I know, then I attempted to lay the pipe on her, but it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>Oh, mmm.</p>
<p>I if, if a guy came up to me at a bar and said, hey, you owe me a drink and I was like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you like?</p>
<p>Because I, that&rsquo;s the worst line of actually ever heard any time a guy tries to pull the like, I&rsquo;m a going to be a.</p>
<p>45:25</p>
<p>Yeah, Groove.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still like flirting but there&rsquo;s still Being a dick.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dead to me, guys.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fat.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna try to go funny.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go douchebag funny.</p>
<p>Just so funny because girls usually especially at a bar people are drinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, shut the fuck up, get out of my face.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>No one wants that really bugs me when guys try to try to play that.</p>
<p>45:43</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>Lastly, thought this would be a good one to end on my boyfriend and I were on an 11 hour road trip last weekend and I told him what I had heard about your podcast.</p>
<p>We decided to give it a shot together fast.</p>
<p>Forward to a few hours of listening, and we literally pulled to the side of the road and fucked you guys rock.</p>
<p>46:05</p>
<p>Wow, the we got people really hot and bothered.</p>
<p>This is really unbelievable.</p>
<p>People are fucking door podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I am so happy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just turning people on with their significant other and you guys are getting after.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty unbelievable.</p>
<p>I love that to.</p>
<p>46:21</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling some type of way right now to I gotta go, Gotta Go.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s perfect because it&rsquo;s the end of the episode.</p>
<p>We can go home.</p>
<p>Home and take care of it.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
