    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Rhonda Patrick.</p>
<p>Dr. Patrick is known to some of you as a podcaster</p>
<p>and one of the premier educators in the landscape</p>
<p>of mitochondria, metabolism, stress,</p>
<p>and other aspects of brain and body health.</p>
<p>Her podcast, Found My Fitness,</p>
<p>is one of the premier podcasts in the world</p>
<p>for disseminating knowledge</p>
<p>about how the brain and body work</p>
<p>and how we can use behavioral tools, micronutrients,</p>
<p>supplements, and other protocols</p>
<p>in order to maximize our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>Dr. Patrick did her formal training in cell biology,</p>
<p>exploring the links between mitochondrial metabolism,</p>
<p>apoptosis, which is naturally occurring cell death,</p>
<p>which is a healthy form of cell death</p>
<p>that occurs in our brain and body</p>
<p>throughout the lifespan, and cancer biology.</p>
<p>She then went on to do postdoctoral training</p>
<p>with Dr. Bruce Ames,</p>
<p>investigating the effects of micronutrients,</p>
<p>meaning vitamins and minerals,</p>
<p>and how they affect metabolism, inflammation,</p>
<p>DNA damage, and the aging process.</p>
<p>She has published landmark review articles</p>
<p>and primary research, meaning original research articles</p>
<p>in some of the premier journals in the world,</p>
<p>including Science, Nature Cell Biology,</p>
<p>Trends in Cell Biology, and FASEB.</p>
<p>Indeed, Dr. Patrick is an expert</p>
<p>in an extraordinarily broad range of topics</p>
<p>that impact our health.</p>
<p>For today&rsquo;s episode, we focus primarily</p>
<p>on the major categories of micronutrients</p>
<p>that are essential for brain and body health.</p>
<p>I have to confess that before the discussion</p>
<p>with Dr. Patrick, I was aware of only one of the categories</p>
<p>of micronutrients that we discuss,</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;ll notice that I am wrapped with attention</p>
<p>throughout the discussion,</p>
<p>and I think that you&rsquo;ll want to have a pen and paper handy</p>
<p>because she offers not only a very clear understanding</p>
<p>of the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>by which other micronutrients operate,</p>
<p>but some very clear and actionable tools and items</p>
<p>that we can all embark on</p>
<p>if we are to optimize our brain and body health.</p>
<p>We also discuss behavioral protocols.</p>
<p>Dr. Patrick is well-known for her understanding</p>
<p>of the scientific literature on sauna</p>
<p>and the use of heat and cold</p>
<p>for optimizing things like metabolism,</p>
<p>longevity, cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m delighted to say that we discuss that as well,</p>
<p>and how behavioral protocols can interface</p>
<p>with supplement-based and nutritional protocols.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident that you&rsquo;ll learn a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of information from Dr. Patrick,</p>
<p>much of which is immediately actionable,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not already following</p>
<p>and listening to her excellent podcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll absolutely want to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s foundmyfitness.com is the website</p>
<p>where you can get access to that podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also on Apple and Spotify</p>
<p>and YouTube as Found My Fitness.</p>
<p>Dr. Patrick also has a terrific newsletter</p>
<p>that I recommend signing up for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s foundmyfitness.com slash newsletter</p>
<p>is where you&rsquo;ll find it,</p>
<p>and it includes research on fasting, micronutrients,</p>
<p>sleep, depression, fitness, longevity, and far more,</p>
<p>along of course with actionable protocols.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>Our motivation for partnering with Momentus</p>
<p>is to provide people one location where they can go</p>
<p>to access the highest quality supplements</p>
<p>in the specific dosages that are best supported</p>
<p>by the scientific research and that are discussed</p>
<p>during various episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will see those formulations.</p>
<p>I should mention that we are going to add more formulations</p>
<p>in the months to come,</p>
<p>and you will see specific suggestions</p>
<p>about how best to take those supplements,</p>
<p>meaning what dosages and times of day,</p>
<p>and in fact, how to combine those supplements</p>
<p>with specific behavioral protocols</p>
<p>that have been discussed on the podcast</p>
<p>and are science supported in order to derive</p>
<p>the maximum benefit from those supplements.</p>
<p>And many of you will probably also be pleased to learn</p>
<p>that Momentus ships not just within the United States,</p>
<p>but also internationally.</p>
<p>So once again, if you go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find what we firmly believe</p>
<p>to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages</p>
<p>and the best protocols for taking those supplements</p>
<p>along with the ideal behavioral protocols</p>
<p>to combine with those supplement formulations.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.</p>
<p>Rhonda, welcome.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming,</p>
<p>even longer than you know,</p>
<p>because even before we discussed you</p>
<p>coming on this podcast as a guest,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching your content for a very long time.</p>
<p>So I want to start off by saying thank you.</p>
<p>You were the spearhead to break through</p>
<p>from academic science to public education.</p>
<p>So I consider you first in,</p>
<p>and the rest of us are just in your wake.</p>
<p>So thank you for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been-</p>
<p>Oh, that is so kind.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>I am so excited to be here,</p>
<p>having a conversation with you, so.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>If anyone does their research,</p>
<p>they will realize that the statement I just made</p>
<p>is absolutely true,</p>
<p>and there isn&rsquo;t even a close second.</p>
<p>You know, any other public-facing educators</p>
<p>that have formal science training</p>
<p>and do regular posting of content</p>
<p>came in several years after you initiated it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all grateful.</p>
<p>I have so many questions,</p>
<p>but I want to start off with a kind of a new,</p>
<p>but old theme that you&rsquo;re very familiar with.</p>
<p>So temperature is a powerful stimulus,</p>
<p>as we know for biology.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve covered a lot of material</p>
<p>related to the utility of cold,</p>
<p>but also the utility of heat.</p>
<p>As I learn more and more from your content</p>
<p>and from the various papers,</p>
<p>it seems that there&rsquo;s a bit of a conundrum</p>
<p>in that cold can stimulate a number of things</p>
<p>like increases in metabolism,</p>
<p>brown fat, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Hopefully you&rsquo;ll tell us more about those.</p>
<p>But heat seems to be able to do a lot of the same things.</p>
<p>And I wonder whether or not the discomfort of cold,</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>and the discomfort of heat</p>
<p>might be anchoring to the same pathway.</p>
<p>So would you mind sharing with us a little bit</p>
<p>about what happens when we get into a cold environment</p>
<p>on purpose,</p>
<p>and what happens when we get into a hot environment</p>
<p>on purpose?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hoping that this might eventually lead us</p>
<p>to some point of convergent understanding.</p>
<p>So if you would.</p>
<p>I would love to, let&rsquo;s take a step back.</p>
<p>And I think you brought up a really important point here.</p>
<p>And I think that point has to do with</p>
<p>the intermittent challenging of yourself</p>
<p>and whether that is through temperature changes</p>
<p>like cold or heat,</p>
<p>or through other types of stressors like physical activity,</p>
<p>or perhaps even dietary compounds that are bound in plants.</p>
<p>These are things like polyphenols or flavanols.</p>
<p>Humans were,</p>
<p>we evolved to intermittently challenge ourselves.</p>
<p>And before we had Instacart</p>
<p>where you could basically</p>
<p>just get your food delivered to you,</p>
<p>before the industrial revolution occurred,</p>
<p>we were out hunting.</p>
<p>And I say we, not us, but humans,</p>
<p>we were out gathering,</p>
<p>we were moving,</p>
<p>and we had to be physically fit.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t catch your prey</p>
<p>if you were a sedentary slob, right?</p>
<p>You were moving and you had to pick your berries,</p>
<p>you had to move.</p>
<p>And so physical activity was a part of everyday life.</p>
<p>And caloric restriction or intermittent fasting</p>
<p>was also a part of it.</p>
<p>This is another type of challenge.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t always have a prey that we caught</p>
<p>or maybe temperatures were such that</p>
<p>there was nothing for us to gather, right?</p>
<p>So food scarcity was something common</p>
<p>as well as eating plants.</p>
<p>So getting these compounds that I mentioned.</p>
<p>So these are all types of stress,</p>
<p>intermittent challenges</p>
<p>that activate genetic pathways in our bodies.</p>
<p>These are often referred to in science</p>
<p>as stress response pathways</p>
<p>because they respond to a little bit of stress.</p>
<p>Physical activity is strenuous.</p>
<p>Fasting is a little bit stressful.</p>
<p>Heat, cold, these things are all types</p>
<p>of little intermittent challenges.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of crosstalk between these stressors</p>
<p>and the genetic pathways that they activate.</p>
<p>And these genetic pathways that are activated</p>
<p>help you deal with stress.</p>
<p>And they do it in a way that is not only beneficial</p>
<p>to help you deal with that little stressor,</p>
<p>exercise or heat,</p>
<p>it stays active and it helps you deal with the stress</p>
<p>of normal metabolism, normal immune function happening,</p>
<p>just life, aging, right?</p>
<p>So this concept is referred to as hormesis, right?</p>
<p>This is a little bit of stressful challenge</p>
<p>that activates these stress response pathways</p>
<p>in a beneficial way that is a net positive</p>
<p>that actually has a very profound antioxidant,</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory response or whatever the response is.</p>
<p>It could be the production of more stem cells.</p>
<p>These are cells that help regenerate different cells</p>
<p>within tissues or something like autophagy,</p>
<p>which is a process that can clear away</p>
<p>all the gunk inside of our cells,</p>
<p>pieces of DNA, protein aggregates.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll find that these stress response pathways</p>
<p>are activated by a variety of stressors.</p>
<p>So for example, one pathway is called heat shock proteins.</p>
<p>And as their name would apply,</p>
<p>one would go, oh, they&rsquo;re activated by heat.</p>
<p>Well, correct, they are activated very robustly by heat.</p>
<p>And we can talk about that.</p>
<p>You know, you can eat a plant like broccoli sprouts,</p>
<p>which is high in something called sulforaphane.</p>
<p>This is a compound that is sort of like a hormetic compound</p>
<p>or as David Sinclair likes to say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a xenohormetic compound.</p>
<p>I love that, I love that term.</p>
<p>And it activates heat shock proteins among other things.</p>
<p>It also activates a very powerful detoxification pathway</p>
<p>called NRF2, which helps you detoxify things</p>
<p>like carcinogens that you&rsquo;re exposed to.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>Heat activates that.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m getting at is there is overlap.</p>
<p>Like cold also activates heat shock proteins.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, really, cold?</p>
<p>Yes, it activates.</p>
<p>These are stress response pathways</p>
<p>and they are activated by various types of stressors.</p>
<p>Now, you know, you&rsquo;re gonna more robustly activate</p>
<p>heat shock proteins from heat versus cold,</p>
<p>but there is some overlap.</p>
<p>So I think that sort of forms a foundation there.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s very helpful.</p>
<p>And you know, it brings to mind</p>
<p>in the context of the nervous system,</p>
<p>I always tell people, you know,</p>
<p>you only have a small kit of neurochemicals to work with.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t dopamine for Netflix</p>
<p>and then dopamine for relationship</p>
<p>and dopamine for work, et cetera.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a generic pathway by which motivation,</p>
<p>craving and pursuit emerge, et cetera.</p>
<p>Just like adrenaline is a generic theme</p>
<p>of many different behaviors.</p>
<p>And it seems that it is the job of biological systems</p>
<p>to be able to take a diverse range of inputs,</p>
<p>even unknown inputs,</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t know what technology</p>
<p>will look like in three years,</p>
<p>but you can bet that some of those novel technologies</p>
<p>will tap into the very systems that I&rsquo;m talking about now.</p>
<p>And there certainly will be other stressors to come about</p>
<p>that will tap into these pathways.</p>
<p>I have two questions related to what you just said</p>
<p>before we talk a little bit more about cold and heat.</p>
<p>You mentioned plants as a route</p>
<p>to creating intermittent challenge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of debate, mostly online,</p>
<p>about whether or not plants are our friends</p>
<p>or plants are trying to kill us.</p>
<p>The extreme version from the carnivore types,</p>
<p>pure carnivore diet types,</p>
<p>is that plants are trying to kill us.</p>
<p>From the plant-based diet folks,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s more about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s healthy for the planet animals than maybe for us.</p>
<p>But if we set aside that argument</p>
<p>and we just raise the hypothesis</p>
<p>that plants have compounds that are bad for us,</p>
<p>but maybe by consuming them in small amounts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re creating this hormesis type scenario.</p>
<p>So then I think we conceivably solve the problem.</p>
<p>We could say, yes, plants are bad for us,</p>
<p>but in small amounts they provide this hormetic response</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re good for us, right?</p>
<p>So in the same way that too much heat is bad for us,</p>
<p>too much cold is bad for us, can kill us, can kill neurons,</p>
<p>but appropriately dosed in an intermittent challenge</p>
<p>type of scenarios can be good for us.</p>
<p>Is that how I should think about plants and these compounds?</p>
<p>Do you think of them as good for us or as bad for us?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a very sharp blade and we want to use them potently.</p>
<p>I actually, I think that it&rsquo;s almost impossible.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d have to eat nothing</p>
<p>but the same plant all day, every day in large.</p>
<p>I mean, the bioavailability of these compounds in the plants</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re attached to a food matrix.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not like taking it</p>
<p>in a supplement form as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such that like, it&rsquo;s very difficult to make it toxic.</p>
<p>Now there are some cases, for example, if you eat cabbage</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s some group in Africa</p>
<p>or somewhere that like, that&rsquo;s all they eat is cabbage.</p>
<p>And there is a goitrogen in cabbage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sulforaphane, it&rsquo;s another compound,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s all they eat every day.</p>
<p>Nothing but that.</p>
<p>And they get, yeah.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like iodine deficient on top of that.</p>
<p>So, you know, I do think there&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>you can of course make, I mean, there are types of plants</p>
<p>that are toxic in small quantities, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that-</p>
<p>Hemlock.</p>
<p>Hemlock, exactly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll kill you.</p>
<p>Folks, don&rsquo;t play this game with hemlock.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not gonna get poisoned from eating,</p>
<p>you know, your serving of broccoli at dinner, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, it depends on the plant.</p>
<p>These generalizations are kind of, they&rsquo;re just not useful.</p>
<p>And I think that a lot of people online in the blogosphere,</p>
<p>they gravitate towards them because it&rsquo;s just easier</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a lot more sensational.</p>
<p>Plants, meat, and starches,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those rare omnivores out there now.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s rare to be an omnivore.</p>
<p>But I think once you step out of the social medias,</p>
<p>as you said, the blogosphere, most people,</p>
<p>I would say 99% of people on the planet</p>
<p>are probably omnivores.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And someone will probably correct me,</p>
<p>but I doubt the number falls below 98.</p>
<p>I think if you look at data,</p>
<p>you know, and when we have carnivore data,</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t wait to see it,</p>
<p>but like right now it&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>okay, well, this is a lot of anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s a good,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of good starts with anecdotes,</p>
<p>but like people change a thousand things at once.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t realize that, but they do.</p>
<p>And so anecdotal data is only so good, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a starting point.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t really know long-term</p>
<p>what carnivore diets are going to do.</p>
<p>You know, they may be beneficial short-term.</p>
<p>They may, you know, be beneficial</p>
<p>for reasons of elimination of other things,</p>
<p>like who knows, right?</p>
<p>Lots of possibilities.</p>
<p>But I do think with respect to plants,</p>
<p>you know, that there&rsquo;s so much evidence,</p>
<p>like for example, sulforaphane is one that I really like</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just evidence that sulforaphane</p>
<p>is a very powerful activator of the NRF2 pathway.</p>
<p>And this is a pathway that regulates a lot of genes</p>
<p>that are related to like glutathione production,</p>
<p>genes that are involved in detoxifying compounds</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re exposed to from our food,</p>
<p>like heterocyclic amines.</p>
<p>In fact, there have been GWAS studies.</p>
<p>So these are genetically,</p>
<p>these are studies that are genome-wide associated studies</p>
<p>for people listening that aren&rsquo;t familiar.</p>
<p>People have a variety of versions of genes.</p>
<p>And we have a gene that&rsquo;s able to make heterocyclic amines</p>
<p>to basically detoxify it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as harmful.</p>
<p>And people that don&rsquo;t have a certain version of that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing it well are very prone to like colon cancer</p>
<p>and increased cancer risk.</p>
<p>But if they eat a lot of broccoli</p>
<p>and cruciferous vegetables, it negates that risk</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re getting sulforaphane,</p>
<p>which activates a lot of the glutathione transferase</p>
<p>and synthase genes.</p>
<p>So glutathione is a major antioxidant in our brain,</p>
<p>in our vascular system, in our body, basically.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s evidence that eating things</p>
<p>like compounds that are like sulforaphane or broccoli</p>
<p>or broccoli sprouts, which have like 100,</p>
<p>up to 100 times more sulforaphane than broccoli,</p>
<p>are activating glutathione in the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s human evidence of that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>That is amazing.</p>
<p>In plasma, yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure when,</p>
<p>so broccoli sprouts are different than broccoli.</p>
<p>And you just told us that they have much,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much richer in these compounds.</p>
<p>So note to self, I should have broccoli sprouts,</p>
<p>not just broccoli.</p>
<p>Can we cook the broccoli and still get these nutrients</p>
<p>or do we have to eat raw?</p>
<p>I confess eating raw broccoli is really aversive to me.</p>
<p>So the sulforaphane is formed from a compound</p>
<p>called glucoraphanin, which is in the broccoli.</p>
<p>And the enzyme that converts it into sulforaphane</p>
<p>is myrosinase and it&rsquo;s heat sensitive.</p>
<p>So you do somewhat lower the sulforaphane levels</p>
<p>when you cook the broccoli.</p>
<p>However, there was a study a few years back</p>
<p>that showed adding one gram of mustard seed powder,</p>
<p>ground mustard seed powder,</p>
<p>which also contains the myrosinase enzyme</p>
<p>to your cooked broccoli increases the sulforaphane</p>
<p>by fourfold.</p>
<p>So this is great because I confess I like broccoli</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s cooked to the appropriate density,</p>
<p>not too mushy, but definitely not raw.</p>
<p>The idea of eating raw broccoli to me just sounds horrible,</p>
<p>but I like the way mustard seed sounds.</p>
<p>So just a little bit of mustard seed powder</p>
<p>added to the cooked broccoli</p>
<p>can recover some of these compounds.</p>
<p>Yes, so what I do is I will, you know,</p>
<p>lightly steam my broccoli</p>
<p>and then I add a little bit of my Kerrygold butter</p>
<p>and then I add some mustard seed powder on the top of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got a little kick,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just a little spice, you know?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t taste that, it&rsquo;s expired.</p>
<p>Like it should have a little kick.</p>
<p>And because I know people will want to know</p>
<p>how often and how much, you know,</p>
<p>are you eating this every day or most days of the week?</p>
<p>Well, I had shifted to supplementation with sulforaphane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve admitted, I&rsquo;m admitting right now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been terrible about it the past,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, six months or so.</p>
<p>The supplementation or the broccoli?</p>
<p>Yes, the supplementation.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s another way to get,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another compound and it&rsquo;s actually called Moringa.</p>
<p>And Dr. Jed Fahey, who&rsquo;s really the expert on sulforaphane,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good friend of mine.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on the podcast a couple of times.</p>
<p>He basically thinks and, you know,</p>
<p>has done a lot of research on Moringa as well,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like a cousin and it activates the Nrf2 pathway</p>
<p>similarly to sulforaphane.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been buying this Cooly Cooly Moringa powder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any affiliation with them.</p>
<p>Cooly Cooly is a brand.</p>
<p>Cooly Cooly is the brand.</p>
<p>That you have no affiliation to.</p>
<p>I have no affiliation,</p>
<p>but Jed Fahey like has researched it,</p>
<p>like that specific brand.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like legit, you know, it&rsquo;s like science-backed</p>
<p>in terms of actually containing Moringa</p>
<p>and activating Nrf2 and I add it to my smoothies.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>What are some dose ranges?</p>
<p>So of course we give the usual recommendations</p>
<p>that people should talk to their physician, et cetera,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>But if people are going to, what do you take?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the, let&rsquo;s take the David Sinclarian approach.</p>
<p>What do you, where he&rsquo;ll talk about what he does</p>
<p>as a way to deal with this.</p>
<p>And of course, everybody&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>and should in all seriousness,</p>
<p>should anytime you add or delete something</p>
<p>from your consumption,</p>
<p>should consult some trusted healthcare professional,</p>
<p>trusted by you.</p>
<p>What, do you recall the dosages?</p>
<p>I do a big heaping tablespoon.</p>
<p>So Moringa, Kuli Kuli Moringa, it sounds like a song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with a K, I know.</p>
<p>But, you know, for people also listening,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, why would I do that?</p>
<p>You know, I mentioned the glutathione in the brain.</p>
<p>I mentioned it in plasma.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been shown to lower DNA damage in people</p>
<p>and white blood cells.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also been shown,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been several different studies in China.</p>
<p>You know, in China, there&rsquo;s a lot of air pollution.</p>
<p>And I mentioned that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very powerful activator, Nrf2.</p>
<p>And I know you&rsquo;re familiar with Nrf2,</p>
<p>but Nrf2 is like, it&rsquo;s your transcription factor.</p>
<p>That is, it is binding to a little specific sequence</p>
<p>in a variety of different genes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like turning them on,</p>
<p>or in some cases, turning them off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s regulating what&rsquo;s being activated</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s not being activated or being turned off.</p>
<p>And some of the genes are basically</p>
<p>these detoxifying pathways.</p>
<p>We talked a little bit about the glutathione,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also ones that are involved</p>
<p>in airborne carcinogens like benzene.</p>
<p>So benzene&rsquo;s found in air pollution.</p>
<p>I mean, cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re smoking cigarettes still,</p>
<p>like, please try to quit.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re mutating your DNA.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>Just say nothing of the lung cancer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re mutating your DNA.</p>
<p>And heart disease risk, heart disease risk.</p>
<p>But anyways, people,</p>
<p>and this has been repeated in more than one study,</p>
<p>that literally after 24 hours of taking,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember off the top of my head</p>
<p>what the dose of sulforaphane from broccoli extract,</p>
<p>broccoli seed extract was,</p>
<p>or broccoli sprouts extract, not the seed,</p>
<p>it was the sprouts.</p>
<p>Anyways, they started excreting like 60% benzene</p>
<p>and acrolein.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s something that we get in cooked food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming out in their urine.</p>
<p>Coming out in their urine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not a smoker.</p>
<p>And I have to be honest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s rare that I hear of a supplement for the first time,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been deep diving on supplements</p>
<p>since I was in my teens.</p>
<p>This is fascinating.</p>
<p>And it brings me back to this question that we had before.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that you answered it very clearly.</p>
<p>Plants have compounds that are good for us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just stressing us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re activating pathways that are reparative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m taking away</p>
<p>from everything you&rsquo;re telling me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that our bodies,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re supposed to be getting that stress</p>
<p>to have those pathways activated.</p>
<p>Like it is like, you know, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this is conserved among different animals.</p>
<p>Like this is something that is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to happen.</p>
<p>And in our modern day world,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to eat plants.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to move anywhere or exercise.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to go through periods of not eating food</p>
<p>because we can have it at our fingertips at any second.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, we&rsquo;ve got this conundrum</p>
<p>of we&rsquo;re never activating these stress response pathways</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re supposed to activate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to.</p>
<p>I find that fascinating.</p>
<p>And again, drawing a parallel to the nervous system.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m hearing you say is that historically,</p>
<p>we would have to go through some stress,</p>
<p>some confront cold or confront heat</p>
<p>or confront effort or hunger,</p>
<p>have to exercise essentially</p>
<p>in order to obtain these compounds.</p>
<p>And then those compounds are reparative.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel that resembles the dopamine pathway.</p>
<p>I always say, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with dopamine.</p>
<p>People think about dopamine hits as bad or dopamine is bad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with dopamine.</p>
<p>The problem is dopamine,</p>
<p>especially high levels of dopamine</p>
<p>released without the need for effort</p>
<p>to access that dopamine is problematic.</p>
<p>So a line of cocaine gives you a ton of dopamine</p>
<p>with no effort except to ingest the drug.</p>
<p>Whereas working for four years or more to get your degree</p>
<p>will release a lot of dopamine</p>
<p>and a lot of cortisol along the way, as we know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s considered a healthy accomplishment in most cases.</p>
<p>A tremendous amount of&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re approaching the spring</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be a lot of graduations.</p>
<p>Weddings are coming up now</p>
<p>that the pandemic is kind of hopefully slowing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be a lot of dopamine.</p>
<p>High levels of dopamine are great,</p>
<p>but only after the effort of having done something</p>
<p>in order to access it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m taking away from what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is that we need to go through this intermittent,</p>
<p>the different types of intermittent challenge.</p>
<p>And we are rewarded with particular compounds</p>
<p>that are reparative, both for the challenge,</p>
<p>but then it make us stronger.</p>
<p>It is, hormesis really is, it seems a case</p>
<p>of what doesn&rsquo;t kill us makes us stronger.</p>
<p>So you mentioned-</p>
<p>Can I add to that one thing you just said?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Because this has been shown with, for example,</p>
<p>sulforaphane in animal studies,</p>
<p>you precondition, give the animal sulforaphane,</p>
<p>and then you expose them to hypoxia</p>
<p>or some kind of ischemic stroke condition,</p>
<p>whatever they do to induce that.</p>
<p>And the sulforaphane, it basically protects them.</p>
<p>Like their precondition</p>
<p>and their stress response pathways are primed.</p>
<p>And so when they&rsquo;re then exposed to the ischemic stroke,</p>
<p>their outcomes are so much better,</p>
<p>so much better than the animals</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t get the sulforaphane 48 hours before</p>
<p>or whatever it was.</p>
<p>And this has been shown in multiple animal studies</p>
<p>with sulforaphane specifically in the brain.</p>
<p>I know Mark Mattson, Dr. Mark Mattson,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s often thought of as the intermittent fasting king,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a neuroscientist and he did publish some work</p>
<p>and talks about sulforaphane as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad you brought that example up</p>
<p>because many of the questions I get on social media</p>
<p>and elsewhere are about traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>and TBI is just one example.</p>
<p>And people always think, oh, sports, it&rsquo;s football.</p>
<p>Whenever you say TBI, people always think football.</p>
<p>And I just want to just take a moment to editorialize.</p>
<p>90% or more of traumatic brain injury</p>
<p>is construction work, at-home accidents.</p>
<p>Football players or hockey players or martial artists</p>
<p>are a tiny fraction of the people who have TBI</p>
<p>and concussion of various kinds.</p>
<p>It just so happens that within those communities,</p>
<p>many of them, 75% or more, experience those.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s salient within those communities,</p>
<p>but concussion is prominent.</p>
<p>People are always asking, what can I do</p>
<p>in order to offset brain injury?</p>
<p>I had a concussion two years ago, what can I do?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a tough question</p>
<p>because you really don&rsquo;t have anything for them.</p>
<p>I mean, you tell them sleep well, eat well, exercise,</p>
<p>but it sounds like some of these reparative pathways</p>
<p>either should be explored in the context of brain injury</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m guessing are being explored</p>
<p>in the context of brain injury.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a couple of things there.</p>
<p>One is that, I mean, traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s terrible, but it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so interesting because it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>like literal real-time brain aging.</p>
<p>Like, you know, like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to like accelerate it and understand.</p>
<p>So I often think of, when I think of traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>I think of so much overlap between Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>and dementia and these neurodegenerative diseases</p>
<p>because there are a lot of similarities there, you know?</p>
<p>And so sulforaphane, I personally think,</p>
<p>and I do think there&rsquo;s been some animal research with TBI,</p>
<p>I mean, and sulforaphane,</p>
<p>mostly preconditioning rather than treatment.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s like, well, I mean,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna, if you want a healthy lifestyle thing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a construction worker</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re fill in the blank, that&rsquo;s, you know, gonna,</p>
<p>I mean, anyone that drives a car,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re at risk to some degree, right?</p>
<p>Or bicycle.</p>
<p>Bicycle, yeah.</p>
<p>Around Stanford, we have, you know,</p>
<p>I would say people demonize motorcycles,</p>
<p>people demonize a lot of things,</p>
<p>but moving fast through space on a small object</p>
<p>next to a 3,000-pound vehicle, I mean, we&rsquo;ve lost,</p>
<p>we have a number of friends that have died.</p>
<p>We have a number of people with traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against cycling or cyclists,</p>
<p>but it is, it&rsquo;s a risky sport by any stretch.</p>
<p>So in taking things like Moringa</p>
<p>or in eating my broccoli sprouts,</p>
<p>maybe cooking them a little less</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;m currently cooking them,</p>
<p>putting on the mustard seed, is there evidence that,</p>
<p>well, first of all, NRF2 is expressed in neurons, right?</p>
<p>So those cells should be protected.</p>
<p>Are there other cells of the body</p>
<p>that could possibly gain protection from these pathways?</p>
<p>Well, lungs, for one, but, you know,</p>
<p>just even in plasma cells, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s pretty,</p>
<p>NRF2 is pretty ubiquitously expressed.</p>
<p>Liver, so there&rsquo;s, I mean, there&rsquo;s so many animal studies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve looked at all those things.</p>
<p>I try to kind of gravitate towards human ones</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a little, a lot more relevant,</p>
<p>but I think, you know, overall, like I mentioned,</p>
<p>you know, DNA damage lower, I think it was like 24,</p>
<p>24 or 34% lower in human blood cells</p>
<p>after broccoli sprout powder supplementation.</p>
<p>And I made a video on this like years ago, 2016, maybe,</p>
<p>and I think I have like the references on there</p>
<p>to exact amounts, I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>We can link to the video.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of an old video, it&rsquo;s 2016.</p>
<p>But I also had Jed on the podcast</p>
<p>and he did talk about this.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s also been shown</p>
<p>in randomized controlled trials</p>
<p>to help treat autism and autistic symptoms.</p>
<p>And yet again, it&rsquo;s doing interesting things in the brain.</p>
<p>And I think it does have something to do</p>
<p>with the oxidative stress and the glutathione,</p>
<p>which would be relevant for TBI treatment.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been shown empirically</p>
<p>that that helps with treatment,</p>
<p>but I do think someone could do that study.</p>
<p>I think that it should be done, honestly,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>I mean, if there&rsquo;s any impact,</p>
<p>and there is at least one preliminary study</p>
<p>that glutathione is increased in the brain</p>
<p>after humans are, you know, basically taking sulforaphane.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Which is really, for people listening,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so important because a number of compounds</p>
<p>that people take in supplement form</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cross the blood brain barrier,</p>
<p>or they get metabolized in ways</p>
<p>that what&rsquo;s listed on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant</p>
<p>for what your cells actually experience.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very reassuring.</p>
<p>We will get back to heat and cold</p>
<p>in this theme that I tried to surface,</p>
<p>but I just find this too interesting</p>
<p>to diverge at this point from these themes.</p>
<p>So what other compounds or micronutrients</p>
<p>do you place in the top tier of useful, interesting,</p>
<p>there are animal studies,</p>
<p>maybe there are hopefully also some human studies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about a few.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve talked a lot about omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>So if you had to do your kind of top three,</p>
<p>your superstars of nutrients for the brain and body,</p>
<p>sounds like we&rsquo;ve got one set.</p>
<p>What would you put in alongside them?</p>
<p>Omega-3, the marine omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>So these are found in marine types of animals,</p>
<p>fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s three fatty acids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one from a plant and that&rsquo;s often referred to</p>
<p>as ALA, people call it short alpha-linolenic acid.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA</p>
<p>and docahexanoic acid, which is DHA.</p>
<p>Yeah, EPA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amazed you can pronounce two of the most difficult words</p>
<p>to pronounce right next to, and spell,</p>
<p>right next to ophthalmology, which if you can spell it,</p>
<p>I know people who have appointments</p>
<p>in ophthalmology departments</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t know how to spell ophthalmology.</p>
<p>A little secret, there&rsquo;s an extra P in there.</p>
<p>So the ALA, I&rsquo;m not going to attempt to pronounce it</p>
<p>because your pronunciation was perfect</p>
<p>of both of these two compounds.</p>
<p>And you said are in marine sources.</p>
<p>So fish, so sardines, cod, this sort of thing.</p>
<p>But what about krill?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen krill oil and there was a few years back,</p>
<p>people were saying krill is a better source</p>
<p>for omega-3s than is fish oil.</p>
<p>I took some krill oil capsules, made me itch all over.</p>
<p>So I stopped.</p>
<p>Do you have a shellfish allergy?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of shellfish, but I like,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ll have oysters every now and again</p>
<p>or shrimp or something and feel fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can talk about sources.</p>
<p>So krill is a source mostly of a type of DHA</p>
<p>and EPA that&rsquo;s in phospholipid form.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty acid.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s different than most of the,</p>
<p>well, if we&rsquo;re talking about fish oil supplements,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re talking about comparing fish to krill,</p>
<p>eating krill, like we&rsquo;re talking about the food.</p>
<p>Oh, I would never eat krill.</p>
<p>Okay, are we talking about the supplements?</p>
<p>Yes, I apologize.</p>
<p>So fish oil supplements.</p>
<p>Yeah, krill supplement versus fish oil supplement.</p>
<p>And if it fits in the conversation,</p>
<p>talking about great sources of omega-3s</p>
<p>in their whole form,</p>
<p>I have a bad feeling you&rsquo;re going to tell me sardines.</p>
<p>Sardines are, yeah, they&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>Except for the taste.</p>
<p>And for the potential contaminants, mercury,</p>
<p>I think was one.</p>
<p>No, yeah, it was mercury.</p>
<p>And Joe was telling me about,</p>
<p>like he used to eat sardines every day.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan was telling me that he used to eat sardines</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>And then he had like really high mercury levels.</p>
<p>And I was really shocked because sardines are like,</p>
<p>you know, low in the fish, you know, group.</p>
<p>So the higher up you get like swordfish and sharks,</p>
<p>like really high mercury</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re eating all the other fish, right?</p>
<p>But I think some brands,</p>
<p>and if you look at like Consumer Lab,</p>
<p>Consumer Lab, it&rsquo;s like a third party site</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m affiliated with,</p>
<p>but I use them because they do a lot of analysis</p>
<p>of different foods and supplements.</p>
<p>And so you can look at like some of their sardines</p>
<p>and they have a list of like ones that are pretty decent.</p>
<p>But anyways, back to your question</p>
<p>about fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements.</p>
<p>So one of the major differences</p>
<p>is that fish oil supplements,</p>
<p>if you get a high quality one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in a triglyceride form.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got like a glycerol backbone</p>
<p>with three fatty acids and that&rsquo;s attached.</p>
<p>And those are either DHA or the EPA.</p>
<p>And, or if you have a lower quality fish oil supplement,</p>
<p>then you have what&rsquo;s called ethyl ester form.</p>
<p>And typically the reason for that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when fish oil is purified,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s run through this column with alcohol</p>
<p>or something they cleave it off the glycerol backbone.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s just kind of easier to leave it like that</p>
<p>than like re-sterifying it, which costs more money.</p>
<p>So you can get it in ethyl ester form,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t as bioavailable.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you don&rsquo;t take it with food,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in trouble.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to absorb much of it at all.</p>
<p>Would you see this on the packaging?</p>
<p>Is it going to say it&rsquo;s in this ethyl form?</p>
<p>Some official brands will put it on their website,</p>
<p>perhaps on their packaging,</p>
<p>but most of the time you&rsquo;ll have to dig for it</p>
<p>on the website and or call them.</p>
<p>But I think for the most part,</p>
<p>ones that are like higher end</p>
<p>will market it like triglyceride form.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that ethyl ester is bad.</p>
<p>It just means take it with food.</p>
<p>So one of the major prescription omega-3s out there</p>
<p>is both of them actually.</p>
<p>Lavazza, which is a mixture of DHA and EPA,</p>
<p>as well as Vasepa, which is a highly purified EPA.</p>
<p>These are both prescribed by physicians</p>
<p>to patients with hypertriglyceridemia.</p>
<p>So high triglycerides, among other things,</p>
<p>I think maybe dysregulation of lipids as well.</p>
<p>This is amazing for people.</p>
<p>So these are prescription drugs</p>
<p>that are essentially very high potency purified omega-3s,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re given to people for lipid issues.</p>
<p>So this is the treatment of issues with fat metabolism</p>
<p>by giving people fat.</p>
<p>Just to really, I just wanna push home.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not carnivore keto or anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an omnivore, but to just push home</p>
<p>that one thing that&rsquo;s so wonderful</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve done over the years that you continue to do</p>
<p>is to move away from these very broad sweeping statements</p>
<p>about fat is bad.</p>
<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s a case where we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>fat is not only good,</p>
<p>it can be used to combat issues with fat metabolism.</p>
<p>And then fats are not just one thing, they&rsquo;re many things.</p>
<p>So anyway, I just wanna put a little highlighter</p>
<p>and a point of appreciation there</p>
<p>and make sure that people are sensitized to the fact</p>
<p>that if you hear that fat is bad,</p>
<p>you have to ask what kind of fat, right?</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;re talking about these omega-3s.</p>
<p>Okay, so the triglyceride form can be taken</p>
<p>with or without food and there&rsquo;s the prescription forms.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, I can&rsquo;t get, I don&rsquo;t know if I can get ahold</p>
<p>of the prescription form unless-</p>
<p>You have high triglycerides.</p>
<p>Or I have a friend with high triglycerides, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s illegal folks, don&rsquo;t share prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Or you talk to your doctor and you say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already taking this from,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how it works, anyways.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the dosage that you recommend people get?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>One way or another.</p>
<p>All right, okay.</p>
<p>So the dosage that physicians prescribe</p>
<p>for high triglycerides, for example, is four grams a day.</p>
<p>Four grams of EPA?</p>
<p>Of, yes, of the Vesipa.</p>
<p>I think Lavaz is also prescribed at four grams a day.</p>
<p>And you can get either of those from your physician.</p>
<p>My father-in-law just got one of them prescribed</p>
<p>because we were buying our own omega-3</p>
<p>for years and years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, you can actually get this</p>
<p>and health insurance can cover it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really purified form,</p>
<p>but you have to take it with food.</p>
<p>That was the bottom line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve totally gone on tangents,</p>
<p>but like you&rsquo;re asking more interesting questions anyway.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Well, normally I ask about mechanism</p>
<p>and then I talk about protocols, but in the-</p>
<p>Or the why.</p>
<p>Or the why.</p>
<p>I mean, we haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet.</p>
<p>But I think that, and we definitely will get there,</p>
<p>but I think a number of people nowadays</p>
<p>are just really excited about what they can do</p>
<p>for their health.</p>
<p>And so here we&rsquo;re just raising the importance of omega-3s</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll definitely get to the why</p>
<p>and the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>I think four grams is, I mean, and in fact,</p>
<p>like, you know, Bill Harris, Dr. Bill Harris is,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just one of the pioneers</p>
<p>on omega-3 fatty acid research.</p>
<p>He was on our podcast not, you know, last August.</p>
<p>And he was saying the reason FDA chose that</p>
<p>was literally just because how much</p>
<p>they could get people to take.</p>
<p>Like, it wasn&rsquo;t like an upper end, like,</p>
<p>oh, this is not, anything above that is unsafe.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just purely like cost</p>
<p>and like, you know, compliance, you know?</p>
<p>So like what they can get into a pill,</p>
<p>the amount they can get</p>
<p>and how many pills they can get people to take.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smiling because our good friend,</p>
<p>Sachin Panda at the Salk Institute,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done a lot of important work on intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and other incredible work on circadian rhythms, et cetera.</p>
<p>When I was talking to him in preparation</p>
<p>for an episode on intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>I said, why the eight hour feeding window?</p>
<p>And he said, well, the graduate student</p>
<p>who ran those studies had a partner.</p>
<p>I think it was a girlfriend, as I recall.</p>
<p>Hope I didn&rsquo;t get that backward.</p>
<p>And the partner said, listen,</p>
<p>you can be in lab 10 hours a day,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t be in lab 14 hours a day</p>
<p>if you want this relationship to work.</p>
<p>And so it was eight hours of feeding window</p>
<p>plus some measurements and time to walk into the lab,</p>
<p>park the car, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so the eight hour feeding window</p>
<p>that everyone holds so wholly</p>
<p>was actually just born out of this relationship</p>
<p>between these two graduate students.</p>
<p>You know, had they been single,</p>
<p>I was single all through graduate school</p>
<p>or most of it anyway.</p>
<p>And I lived in the lab.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;d been me, we&rsquo;d all be,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting would mean eating 14 hours a day.</p>
<p>That was a joke, not a good one,</p>
<p>but I just want to make clear I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>But the point that you&rsquo;re making is a really good one</p>
<p>that the four gram amount is not a threshold</p>
<p>based on anything except the threshold</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s willingness to actually take the stop.</p>
<p>So, and I think that&rsquo;s important for people to hear</p>
<p>because so often we hear the eight hour feeding window,</p>
<p>you know, four grams of EPA,</p>
<p>you know, 150 minutes of cardio.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really a question of what you can reasonably do</p>
<p>in a study.</p>
<p>So I take four grams a day.</p>
<p>I take two in the morning, two grams in the morning,</p>
<p>and I take two grams in the evening.</p>
<p>I take my EPA in the morning</p>
<p>and I take my DHA in the evening.</p>
<p>You split them.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary,</p>
<p>not necessarily.</p>
<p>I just happen to buy,</p>
<p>I happen to get a certain fish oil supplement</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like separates them.</p>
<p>And so, you know, like Lavazza, Lavazza is a great one</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all like in one and it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>What if someone doesn&rsquo;t have a prescription?</p>
<p>So I take over the counter fish oil.</p>
<p>I know I feel better</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve done the experiment of going on and off.</p>
<p>I take the mainly for, I don&rsquo;t have depression,</p>
<p>but my mood is better.</p>
<p>My joints feel better.</p>
<p>I just feel better.</p>
<p>And I like to think that my platelets are slipperier</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>cruising through any little obstructions</p>
<p>in my veins or arteries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the image I have in my head,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have any data to support that part.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so if you&rsquo;re asking for like,</p>
<p>where do people get these fish oil supplements?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say I look at the bottle</p>
<p>and it says two grams per serving,</p>
<p>but then I look and it&rsquo;s 750 milligrams of EPA, right?</p>
<p>Or a thousand milligrams of EPA.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say half of it is EPA.</p>
<p>Then do I want to hit a threshold of EPA</p>
<p>or a threshold of what&rsquo;s listed on the bottle, right?</p>
<p>On the front of the bottle.</p>
<p>Because my understanding is that</p>
<p>we need to hit a threshold level of EPA</p>
<p>in order to derive these important benefits.</p>
<p>I think two grams is a good threshold.</p>
<p>Now, the International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,</p>
<p>they have a website where they do third-party testing</p>
<p>of a ton of different fish oil supplements</p>
<p>from around the world.</p>
<p>And they measure the concentration</p>
<p>of the omega-3 fatty acids in the actual supplement</p>
<p>because nothing is ever what it says on the bottle.</p>
<p>And then they also measure contaminants,</p>
<p>so mercury, PCBs, dioxins,</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;d find potentially in fish</p>
<p>that are harmful to humans.</p>
<p>And they also measure mercury and then oxidized fatty acids.</p>
<p>So these omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>are polyunsaturated fatty acids,</p>
<p>which are extremely prone to oxidation.</p>
<p>So please keep your fish oil in the refrigerator</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s colder.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re extremely prone.</p>
<p>Mine&rsquo;s in the cupboard, so now I know.</p>
<p>The shelf life&rsquo;s increased, lower oxidation.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Right, so anyways, they measure that.</p>
<p>And I typically like to look for,</p>
<p>they give you a total oxidation number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called TOTOX, T-O-T-O-X, TOTOX</p>
<p>is what we call it for short.</p>
<p>And I like it to be at the least under 10,</p>
<p>ideally under six.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to find all the right mixtures of things,</p>
<p>but people can go to this website</p>
<p>and they can browse through the products.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put together an Excel sheet,</p>
<p>which I have a YouTube little screencast</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m yet to publish.</p>
<p>Press the publish button on.</p>
<p>But it basically, you have to go back and check and update</p>
<p>because these are from different lot numbers</p>
<p>of the products.</p>
<p>They do have up to like 20, 27 or something.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve gone through and found my top picks</p>
<p>of high EPA brands and high DHA brands</p>
<p>if I were to buy some, the ones that I would choose</p>
<p>because of the low total oxidation</p>
<p>and the high concentration of either EPA or DHA.</p>
<p>Now, people can go and do this themselves.</p>
<p>It just takes some work.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m glad that you did the work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to put up a tweet every week</p>
<p>with you tagged until this list is published online.</p>
<p>Sorry, Rhonda, but I&rsquo;m gonna do it.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s very sadistic of me,</p>
<p>but in service to the community and myself.</p>
<p>And I chose five brands from each.</p>
<p>I tried to find one in like Europe and one in Canada.</p>
<p>So there was a great selection of US and other.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do that work and I trust you.</p>
<p>So yeah, I try and get two grams per day of EPA</p>
<p>from supplementation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now put it in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Mood is better.</p>
<p>I made that decision mainly based on the data</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of looking at comparison of people doing that</p>
<p>anywhere from two to four grams of EPA per day</p>
<p>compared to SSRI serotonin,</p>
<p>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</p>
<p>and treatment of depression.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to take an SSRI if I don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>And fortunately I don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>but the data by my read are remarkable.</p>
<p>People that take these things in sufficient doses,</p>
<p>meaning the EPAs are able to get by with much lower dosages</p>
<p>of SSRIs for depression relief,</p>
<p>or in some cases to come off their SSRIs completely</p>
<p>or avoid going on antidepressant medication.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is not something people should cowboy,</p>
<p>mental health issues are serious,</p>
<p>but what other reasons?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love your thoughts on that, on the mental health part.</p>
<p>And so maybe you could tell us,</p>
<p>what are some things that getting two to four grams</p>
<p>of EPA per day is going to help with in our brain</p>
<p>and the rest of our body?</p>
<p>So do you know?</p>
<p>So I actually published a paper back in 2015</p>
<p>about the role of omega-3 and vitamin D</p>
<p>in depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,</p>
<p>and impulsive behavior.</p>
<p>But so like within that paper,</p>
<p>like the doing background research,</p>
<p>and this was a review article, by the way,</p>
<p>I was just connecting dots.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m gonna grab it.</p>
<p>I confess I don&rsquo;t know the paper,</p>
<p>but I love quality reviews</p>
<p>because the references therein are so useful.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a huge role for inflammation,</p>
<p>the cause of inflammation and depression.</p>
<p>And I think we did a short animated video on this as well,</p>
<p>like years ago back when I was publishing that work</p>
<p>where people are injected with lipopolysaccharide.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something that we&rsquo;re generating</p>
<p>from our gut, mostly from our gut permeability,</p>
<p>which happens a lot.</p>
<p>Endotoxin, it&rsquo;s also called,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s endotoxin lipopolysaccharide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the outer membrane of bacterial cells</p>
<p>when bacteria die.</p>
<p>So like when the immune cells in our gut</p>
<p>come into contact with a bacteria</p>
<p>because we drank alcohol five days in a row or whatever,</p>
<p>we release endotoxin or something stressed us out.</p>
<p>We release endotoxin into our body</p>
<p>and that causes inflammation.</p>
<p>And so you can inject people with lipopolysaccharide</p>
<p>and cause depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>However, if you take those same cohort of people,</p>
<p>give them EPA,</p>
<p>and I think it was somewhere around two grams,</p>
<p>and then inject them with lipopolysaccharide.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re establishing causation here, right?</p>
<p>The depressive symptoms versus the placebo.</p>
<p>So the placebo was saline control.</p>
<p>So this was a placebo control</p>
<p>because obviously it&rsquo;s hugely important for depression.</p>
<p>It ameliorated the depressive symptoms</p>
<p>that was caused by lipopolysaccharide.</p>
<p>Amazing, and LPS, lipopolysaccharide, is no joke.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I was working on thermal regulation,</p>
<p>we would inject animals with LPS to induce fever.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve registers the presence of LPS signals</p>
<p>to these particular hypothalamic areas</p>
<p>and cranks up body temperature</p>
<p>because basically it&rsquo;s a signal that the body is infected.</p>
<p>Right, amazing.</p>
<p>So I will continue with my two grams per day.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll ramp it up to four.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing the DHA separately.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s DHA in the same supplement.</p>
<p>Is that okay?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And to kind of, boy, we got a lot of things to hit back on</p>
<p>because one of your original questions</p>
<p>was krill oil versus fish oil.</p>
<p>And DHA specifically is in phospholipid form,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more bioavailable.</p>
<p>So our bodies, if you&rsquo;re comparing exact quantity</p>
<p>or concentration in triglyceride form</p>
<p>versus phospholipid form,</p>
<p>you will get more in your plasma cells,</p>
<p>in your plasma, not plasma cells,</p>
<p>in your plasma with krill oil.</p>
<p>However, krill oil supplements are so low dose.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, good luck getting two grams</p>
<p>of omega-3 from krill oil.</p>
<p>And also krill oil supplements are notoriously like rancid.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what made me itchy all over.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found a good krill oil supplement.</p>
<p>I pretty much stay away from it.</p>
<p>I mean, if you smell it too,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just like, it just smells rancid.</p>
<p>So, but the thing is,</p>
<p>and I also published a paper on this back in 2019 or,</p>
<p>yeah, something like that,</p>
<p>about DHA in phospholipid form getting into the brain</p>
<p>through a different mechanism</p>
<p>than DHA in triglyceride form.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s going through a transporter</p>
<p>called the MFSD2A transporter.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very relevant</p>
<p>for people with an ApoE4 allele.</p>
<p>So I kind of-</p>
<p>With an Alzheimer&rsquo;s susceptibility.</p>
<p>Right, so like 25% of the population has an allele</p>
<p>in a gene called ApoE4.</p>
<p>And basically it&rsquo;s ApoE,</p>
<p>but the four is referred to as the bad kind of version of it.</p>
<p>This is something in our bodies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also in our brain.</p>
<p>And if people have one of these versions,</p>
<p>if they got one from their mom or their dad,</p>
<p>they have a twofold increased risk for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>if they get two, which is much, it&rsquo;s much more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less common.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 2% of the population or something has two alleles,</p>
<p>but they have like a 10 or 11 fold increased risk</p>
<p>of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>So there is a role for phospholipid form DHA in the brain,</p>
<p>but you also make phospholipid DHA inside your body.</p>
<p>And you can do that by taking in more triglyceride form.</p>
<p>So two grams, like the magic more,</p>
<p>two grams or more is the magic number, I think.</p>
<p>So kind of back to like the why for fish oil.</p>
<p>And I personally think it is one of the most powerful</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle,</p>
<p>things that we can get easily, relatively easily,</p>
<p>that is gonna powerfully modulate the way you think,</p>
<p>the way you feel and the way you age.</p>
<p>And a variety of different types of studies</p>
<p>kind of led me to that conclusion.</p>
<p>A variety of observational studies.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been lots of work by Dr. Bill Harris</p>
<p>and his collaborators looking at</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s called the omega-3 index.</p>
<p>So this is actually the omega-3 level in red blood cells.</p>
<p>So red blood cells turnover about every 120 days.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a long-term marker of omega-3 status.</p>
<p>This is very different from 99.9% of any study you see</p>
<p>or any lab that you go to to get your omega-3 levels tested,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting your plasma phospholipid levels tested,</p>
<p>which is kind of like, you can think of it as,</p>
<p>what did I eat a couple of days before?</p>
<p>Oh, I had fish.</p>
<p>My omega-3 levels are great,</p>
<p>but did you eat fish like that every week?</p>
<p>Or was it like, you know, was like you went out to dinner?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a great biomarker for long-term omega-3 status.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the fasting blood glucose levels</p>
<p>versus the HbA1c, which is like a long-term marker, right,</p>
<p>of your blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>So the omega-3 index, he&rsquo;s done a variety of studies,</p>
<p>observational studies, so for people listening,</p>
<p>these are studies that are obviously flawed</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not establishing causality.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re looking at people&rsquo;s lifestyles,</p>
<p>but in the case of Bill Harris&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s measuring something.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s measuring the omega-3 index,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s measuring the omega-3 index in people</p>
<p>and then looking at their mortality risk, for example,</p>
<p>or their cardiovascular disease risk.</p>
<p>And what he has found is that most,</p>
<p>first of all, standard American diet</p>
<p>has omega-3 index of 5%.</p>
<p>Japan, by contrast, has an omega-3 index</p>
<p>of around 10 to 11%, big difference there.</p>
<p>And they also have about a five-year increased</p>
<p>life expectancy compared to people in the U.S.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s mainly due to their fish intake,</p>
<p>seafood intake?</p>
<p>So what he showed was, I think it&rsquo;s a big part of it.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t always say it&rsquo;s the only thing,</p>
<p>but what he showed in his data was that in,</p>
<p>and I think it was a Framingham study</p>
<p>where he looked at the omega-3 index in people</p>
<p>that had a omega-3 index of 4% or lower,</p>
<p>so close to what the standard American is,</p>
<p>but a little bit lower.</p>
<p>They had a five-year decreased life expectancy</p>
<p>compared to people that had an 8% omega-3 index.</p>
<p>And so big difference there, right?</p>
<p>Five years life expectancy.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the really interesting thing, Andrew.</p>
<p>He also looked at smokers and smokers</p>
<p>and their omega-3 levels.</p>
<p>And so he stratified it, right?</p>
<p>And he found smokers that had no omega-3</p>
<p>were like the worst of all.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like, it was just like worse, right?</p>
<p>We all know smoking is bad for us</p>
<p>and will take years off our life expectancy.</p>
<p>But smokers that had the high level,</p>
<p>like smokers that were taking their fish oil</p>
<p>or eating fish or whatever it was they were doing</p>
<p>to get them up to 8%,</p>
<p>they had the same life expectancy as non-smokers</p>
<p>with the low omega-3 index.</p>
<p>Wow. Right?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also amazing to me</p>
<p>that people still smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p>But I see a lot of people vaping</p>
<p>and I know a lot of people consume cannabis, right?</p>
<p>People, has there been any studies of,</p>
<p>specifically of vaping or people smoking marijuana</p>
<p>and all cause mortality?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen those.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen those.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not motivated enough</p>
<p>to come in as research subjects.</p>
<p>That was again, a poor joke.</p>
<p>It is hard to study people marijuana use</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m told by my colleagues that study this stuff,</p>
<p>unless you offer people marijuana,</p>
<p>in which case they&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>But again, they&rsquo;re actually not very good research subjects</p>
<p>in all seriousness,</p>
<p>because they are not very motivated or consistent</p>
<p>and they forget their appointments.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And you mentioned that the data on pollution</p>
<p>related to the plant compounds earlier.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like these things are, again,</p>
<p>are acting in a reparative way.</p>
<p>The omega-3s are, I mean,</p>
<p>they are resolving inflammation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like blunting inflammation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing so many different,</p>
<p>like they affect so many different parts</p>
<p>of the inflammatory pathway,</p>
<p>which is, I think it plays a huge role</p>
<p>in the way we age, the way our brain ages,</p>
<p>the way we feel, our mood, just our joints, all that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I love fish oil.</p>
<p>I feel better when I take it.</p>
<p>I try to eat some fatty fish a couple times a week.</p>
<p>I do wanna just touch on food sources for a moment.</p>
<p>First of all, are there plants that are rich in omega-3s?</p>
<p>And second, I have some friends who are really into meat</p>
<p>and I like meat a lot.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s Argentine, but I don&rsquo;t eat very much of it.</p>
<p>I try and eat high quality meats</p>
<p>in relatively limited amounts,</p>
<p>but I do eat pretty often.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been told by these sources</p>
<p>of questionable authority that if an animal grazes</p>
<p>on really good grasses, for instance,</p>
<p>that the meat can contain a lot of omega-3s,</p>
<p>which in principle makes sense based on this omega-3 index,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re telling me that a lot of this omega-3</p>
<p>is sequestered into the red blood cells.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m eating high quality grass-fed meat</p>
<p>and the grasses had omega-3s,</p>
<p>do my steaks have omega-3s or no?</p>
<p>So there was a study published</p>
<p>that compared conventional meat,</p>
<p>so meat that animals are fed,</p>
<p>corn or soy or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Which is terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But for animals and people, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get some attacks, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t read those comments.</p>
<p>Again, a joke, I read all the comments.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that these animals</p>
<p>would have to either be taking fish oil</p>
<p>or eat plants that are very rich in omega-3s</p>
<p>in order for the meat</p>
<p>to actually contain sufficient omega-3s.</p>
<p>So the meat, comparing the conventional meat</p>
<p>to the grass-fed or pasture-raised cows or cattle,</p>
<p>there were higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid.</p>
<p>And ALA, it can be converted into EPA and DHA,</p>
<p>but the conversion is very inefficient</p>
<p>and very dependent on a variety of factors,</p>
<p>including genetics.</p>
<p>Genetics, a huge regulator.</p>
<p>Like some people can do it much better.</p>
<p>Others, you&rsquo;re getting like 5% of conversion to EPA.</p>
<p>Estrogen is a major regulator of making that more efficient.</p>
<p>And it makes sense because pregnancy,</p>
<p>when your estrogen just goes through the roof,</p>
<p>I mean, these omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>play a very important role in brain development.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>women are supposed to be converting any ALA they can</p>
<p>into the longer chain omega-3 fatty acids, right?</p>
<p>So estrogen does affect that.</p>
<p>But I would say plant sources,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re looking for the ALA,</p>
<p>plant sources would be, you know, walnuts, flax seeds.</p>
<p>Those are probably the highest.</p>
<p>But if a person is a vegan or a vegetarian,</p>
<p>their best bet is to actually get microalgae oil.</p>
<p>And you can supplement with microalgae oil</p>
<p>because microalgae do, it&rsquo;s, they do make the DHA.</p>
<p>And so that would be a better source</p>
<p>for people that are vegetarian and vegan</p>
<p>rather than doing the flaxseed oil</p>
<p>because that conversion inefficiency, you know,</p>
<p>the enzymes that convert ALA into EPA and DHA,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s inefficient.</p>
<p>And then for people that eat fish, sardines, you said-</p>
<p>Salmon.</p>
<p>And you have to eat the skin, as I understand.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to, but it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rich with the oil.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the reason I say like,</p>
<p>like I think the best would be wild Alaskan salmon</p>
<p>versus the farm raised because the farm raised,</p>
<p>again, they&rsquo;re feeding them, they&rsquo;re feeding them corn.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re feeding them like grain and stuff.</p>
<p>And then they give them astaxanthin.</p>
<p>So astaxanthin is a carotenoid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the carotenoid that&rsquo;s in things like krill crustaceans</p>
<p>that make their red pigment.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s also being used now as a supplement</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a prescription form</p>
<p>to try and rescue some age-related vision loss</p>
<p>because of the role of the vitamin A pathway</p>
<p>in photoreceptors.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know, actually the carotenoids themselves,</p>
<p>so like lutein, zeaxanthin,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really good at sequestering singlet oxygen,</p>
<p>which is damaging, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, as we age, because the retinal cells,</p>
<p>cells of the eye are so metabolically active,</p>
<p>they accumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>and mitochondrial repair</p>
<p>and limiting reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>is a major theme of trying to rescue vision.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a whole other podcast and story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some really interesting data now</p>
<p>on the use of red light to try and trigger these pathways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my good friend of many years</p>
<p>and amazing scientist, Glenn Jeffries Lab</p>
<p>at the University College London.</p>
<p>We should talk about that at some point, if not today.</p>
<p>I saw that study like 2020, was it?</p>
<p>Yeah, they have a second study.</p>
<p>Oh, do they?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s looking real.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, they&rsquo;re cautious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re appropriately British and cautious about it.</p>
<p>You know, I always joke</p>
<p>if those studies have been done over here,</p>
<p>everyone would already know about it.</p>
<p>Glenn is a very conservative guy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve done this stuff now in pigs and rodent models</p>
<p>and now also two studies in humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s looking pretty interesting.</p>
<p>So sardines, but also anchovies.</p>
<p>I mean, by the way,</p>
<p>I hate all the food items that I&rsquo;m describing.</p>
<p>I can barely tolerate salmon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like fish at all.</p>
<p>Actually, I like live fish.</p>
<p>I had fish tanks when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t, no, I find fish,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s in sushi form,</p>
<p>I find it absolutely repulsive.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I probably have some mutations.</p>
<p>So raw fish is actually higher in mercury than cooked.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t really like sushi that much anyway.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving me great reasons to not eat fish,</p>
<p>but except I should eat these other fish sources</p>
<p>or supplement more heavily.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the message I&rsquo;m getting.</p>
<p>I eat sardines, like every day,</p>
<p>my like first meal almost is like a can of sardines</p>
<p>and an avocado with like-</p>
<p>Avocado is good.</p>
<p>Yeah, with a little bit of lemon</p>
<p>and then some little hot sauce, like, you know.</p>
<p>Does avocado have omega-3s?</p>
<p>Avocado is very good in monounsaturated fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really high in polyunsaturated fat.</p>
<p>Omega-3 really, I mean, it&rsquo;s either the DHA and EPA</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the marine sources, fish,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the plant ALA source,</p>
<p>which is like the flax seed or the walnuts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>I mean, all these companies now</p>
<p>are making these plant-based products that taste like meat.</p>
<p>My wish is that they would just make a fish</p>
<p>that tastes like a steak, but that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>The fish come out albino, the ones that they farm raise,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t eat any of the-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a genetically modified fish</p>
<p>that tastes like a steak.</p>
<p>Although, you know, I love the taste of steak.</p>
<p>The point here is that if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if one doesn&rsquo;t see themselves regularly consuming</p>
<p>these fish sources of omega-3s,</p>
<p>it seems to me that the only way to really get them</p>
<p>is from supplementation.</p>
<p>And supplementation is a good way to get a high dose.</p>
<p>And to get back to your dose point,</p>
<p>there was a couple of studies that basically,</p>
<p>I think there was some way they showed that people</p>
<p>that are in the 4% omega-3 index range,</p>
<p>in order to get to the 8%, right?</p>
<p>The five-year increased life expectancy,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re comparing the two groups,</p>
<p>was to supplement with at least two grams.</p>
<p>It was about two grams a day.</p>
<p>And that, and I think it was a little bit less</p>
<p>if it was triglyceride form,</p>
<p>but I think two grams is a good, safe number.</p>
<p>So most Americans that are not eating a lot of fish</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not supplementing</p>
<p>are probably around a 4% to 5% omega-3 index.</p>
<p>And to get to the 8%,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s a good empirical way</p>
<p>of thinking about it, right?</p>
<p>Okay, well, I want to get to that 8%.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m almost 16% omega-3 index.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was going to ask about testing.</p>
<p>So where can somebody measure,</p>
<p>where and how can somebody measure their omega-3 index?</p>
<p>Which again, just to remind people is the,</p>
<p>essentially the percentage of omega-3s</p>
<p>that you have in your blood with the caveat</p>
<p>that the omega-3 index will be heavily biased</p>
<p>by what you ate in the previous days.</p>
<p>Not the omega-3 index.</p>
<p>Okay, so the omega-3-</p>
<p>Sorry, I misunderstood.</p>
<p>I thought you said in red blood cells.</p>
<p>If I ate salmon two days ago,</p>
<p>my omega-3 index is going to go up.</p>
<p>No, that was plasma.</p>
<p>I misunderstood.</p>
<p>So most people are measuring,</p>
<p>like if you look at a lot of studies,</p>
<p>and honestly, Andrew,</p>
<p>I think a lot of the reason for conflicting data</p>
<p>is because people are measuring plasma omega-3 levels.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The phospholipids, it&rsquo;s in a phospholipid, right?</p>
<p>So your phospholipids are carrying things.</p>
<p>These are lipoproteins.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re carrying things like omega-3 intraglycerides</p>
<p>and stuff and shuttling them around.</p>
<p>So the omega-3 index is actually in the red blood cells</p>
<p>and red blood cells take 120 days to turn over.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to do a baseline test,</p>
<p>if you want to know before supplementing</p>
<p>what your level is,</p>
<p>you have to wait 120 days before doing the second test</p>
<p>after supplementing to know how much you went up</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how long it takes</p>
<p>for your red blood cell to turn over.</p>
<p>So the omega-3 index,</p>
<p>Bill Harris has a company that he co-founded</p>
<p>is called OmegaQuant,</p>
<p>and they measure the omega-3 index.</p>
<p>They have a variety of different index tests.</p>
<p>You can do like a basic one or a little more advanced.</p>
<p>This is from a blood draw.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little blood spot thing, yeah.</p>
<p>And he uses the money to funnel back</p>
<p>into doing lipid research.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s out there doing all sorts of interesting studies</p>
<p>on omega-3s, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But the omega-3 index is great.</p>
<p>I think that honestly more people and more researchers</p>
<p>should be using it because the conflicting data,</p>
<p>it always comes down to what we&rsquo;re measuring,</p>
<p>the sensitivity of it, are we even measuring anything?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re giving someone 500 milligrams of DHA</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t see any effect.</p>
<p>Well, did you measure what their levels were?</p>
<p>And did you measure the omega-3 index?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of problems</p>
<p>with randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>And I think that it just, we need to like,</p>
<p>as scientists, we need to come together</p>
<p>and like make some progress.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s all talk to each other.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure things out.</p>
<p>This test is out there, it should be used.</p>
<p>It should be used, not just by Bill&rsquo;s group,</p>
<p>but like everyone.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and I&rsquo;m learning so much from you</p>
<p>and I agree we need more collaboration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations</p>
<p>in my lab at Stanford</p>
<p>and collaborating is just so much more fun.</p>
<p>Online, there seems to be a bias more towards</p>
<p>creating silos as opposed to bridges.</p>
<p>But I appreciate that you bring up the need</p>
<p>for more collaboration and knowing which measures are best</p>
<p>and in this case, now, thank you for the clarification.</p>
<p>I understand this omega-3 index is going to be best.</p>
<p>You mentioned you, so you basically,</p>
<p>when now I look at you, I think you are 16% omega-3.</p>
<p>And dolphins are 19%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost-</p>
<p>Is that your goal?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to get there?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>To do the interesting.</p>
<p>Actually, they should probably do something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to achieve the omega-3 ratio</p>
<p>of your favorite species.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered a bit of</p>
<p>how to get these things into one system,</p>
<p>depending on what one eats, et cetera,</p>
<p>and some of the better measurements,</p>
<p>how is omega-3 and some of these other related lipids,</p>
<p>how are they having these positive effects?</p>
<p>In my mind, and this is incredibly elementary,</p>
<p>but my understanding is that at some level,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making platelets more slippery.</p>
<p>Is that true or not?</p>
<p>I hope, I&rsquo;m happy to be wrong.</p>
<p>How is it possibly impacting my mood?</p>
<p>Is it through the synthesis of membrane on neurons</p>
<p>that allows neurons to release more transmitter,</p>
<p>like serotonin and dopamine?</p>
<p>I mean, what are some of the purported,</p>
<p>reported, and known mechanisms?</p>
<p>I think some of the most well-known mechanisms</p>
<p>do have to do with the omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>being very powerful regulators of the inflammatory process</p>
<p>in some way, shape, or form,</p>
<p>whether that has to do with resolvins that are produced.</p>
<p>So these, from the metabolites of like DHA, for example,</p>
<p>resolvins play a role in resolving inflammation.</p>
<p>Like you want your inflammatory response to be activated</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s supposed to be,</p>
<p>but you wanna resolve that inflammation</p>
<p>and the inflammatory response in a timely manner, right?</p>
<p>And resolvins help do that.</p>
<p>And so resolvins are one.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s these specialized pro-mediating molecules,</p>
<p>the SPMs, that also help resolve the inflammation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>the leukotrienes and prostaglandins,</p>
<p>and these things are being affected by EPA,</p>
<p>and they do affect platelets and platelet aggregation,</p>
<p>and they do affect that whole pathway as well.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s just, and there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just so many different ways and inputs.</p>
<p>And so when we talk about inflammation,</p>
<p>honestly, it&rsquo;s a big general term,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about serotonin release</p>
<p>at the level of neurons,</p>
<p>we know that these inflammatory molecules</p>
<p>cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>And I just mentioned ago about injecting people</p>
<p>with lipopolysaccharide and causing depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s known that that omega-3,</p>
<p>actually, specifically, EPA is able to help serotonin,</p>
<p>inflammation inhibits the release of serotonin.</p>
<p>And so EPA is actually able to blunt inflammatory responses,</p>
<p>along with DHA as well.</p>
<p>DHA does that through resolvins and stuff.</p>
<p>And this then helps more serotonin be released</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not having so much inflammation</p>
<p>getting into the brain and affecting serotonin release,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one mechanism.</p>
<p>And then another would be,</p>
<p>well, DHA itself has been shown.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very important fatty acid</p>
<p>that makes up cell membranes,</p>
<p>many cell membranes, including in our neurons.</p>
<p>And as you very well know, Andrew,</p>
<p>the structure and function of receptors, of transporters,</p>
<p>these membrane-bound proteins on the surface of our cells,</p>
<p>including neurons, are affected by the membrane fluidity,</p>
<p>you know, like how rigid and how fluid the cell membrane is.</p>
<p>And DHA plays a role in that.</p>
<p>And so, for example, in animal studies,</p>
<p>if you make an animal deficient in DHA,</p>
<p>their serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re affected because the structure of them</p>
<p>is affected through the fluidity of the membrane.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s another mechanism.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking sort of general</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>No, but it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>I mean, we know, for instance, neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>almost always, involves the recruitment of more receptors</p>
<p>or an improvement in some feature of receptors</p>
<p>to neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>And they literally move laterally in the membrane.</p>
<p>They kind of float around like little rafts.</p>
<p>Sometimes they are, in fact, in lipid rafts.</p>
<p>And so it makes perfect sense that these molecules like DHA,</p>
<p>which are part of the structural fat of the neuron,</p>
<p>because of course the outsides of neurons are basically fat,</p>
<p>not just the myelin that people have heard of,</p>
<p>but the actual membranes, that if getting that right,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t want it as rigid as concrete,</p>
<p>but you wouldn&rsquo;t want it as soft as,</p>
<p>I need to come up with something here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that gooey stuff that kids play with?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that goo.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s disgusting and it&rsquo;s too soft</p>
<p>to be a membrane for a neuron.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we know.</p>
<p>Someone put it in the comments</p>
<p>and tell me what that disgusting gooey stuff is.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your neurons to be that gooey,</p>
<p>and yet you don&rsquo;t want them to be like concrete either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>And in mentioning DHA, I&rsquo;m just gonna,</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m backtracking,</p>
<p>but I want to make sure</p>
<p>that we close all the hatches for people.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about EPA,</p>
<p>but are food sources of DHA</p>
<p>that you find particularly attractive,</p>
<p>either by taste or by potency for DHA,</p>
<p>what are just a few that we could throw out?</p>
<p>Because I am aware that there are supplements</p>
<p>where you can get a nice ratio of EPA to DHA,</p>
<p>or you take them separately as you do.</p>
<p>But if I want to make sure that I&rsquo;m getting enough DHA,</p>
<p>what do I need to be sure I&rsquo;m eating on a regular basis?</p>
<p>Well, the fish is packaging the DHA and EPA in the ratio.</p>
<p>But I also do eat salmon roe, which is very salty.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really high source of the phosphatidylcholine DHA</p>
<p>that we talked about.</p>
<p>So this is fish eggs.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And actually-</p>
<p>That I like for some reason.</p>
<p>Oh, do you?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m discovering something about myself.</p>
<p>This was not meant to be nutritional psychotherapy,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re doing that for me anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m discovering that, yeah,</p>
<p>I like eating embryonic fish.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like eating the actual fish.</p>
<p>Okay, well.</p>
<p>Okay, so fish eggs are okay.</p>
<p>So caviar, basically.</p>
<p>Caviar, yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good source of the phospholipid form.</p>
<p>And I was consuming that a lot</p>
<p>because I wanted to get the phospholipid form.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s actually really good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been some animal studies</p>
<p>in piglets and rodents as well,</p>
<p>showing that consuming phospholipid DHA</p>
<p>during fetal brain development,</p>
<p>gets like 10 times more DHA in the brain.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Makes sense based on fetal development.</p>
<p>So do I need to buy beluga caviar?</p>
<p>Stuff can get pretty expensive at $200 a tin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a matter of preference.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re supplementing</p>
<p>with your two to four grams of fish oil,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re gonna get phospholipid form anyway,</p>
<p>because your body&rsquo;s gonna make it.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve seen some containers</p>
<p>of what I assume to be quality fish eggs</p>
<p>that are not at the caviar level</p>
<p>that you can find in the better grocery stores</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t super expensive.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t dip as low as to go eat,</p>
<p>for instance, like fishing bait.</p>
<p>Like when we were kids, we used to go fishing</p>
<p>and you put the fish egg on the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably not good.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s good enough for the fish, apparently.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Only half joking here, folks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to protect you from yourselves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get any crazy ideas about eating fishing bait.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s great to know.</p>
<p>So we have these plant-based compounds.</p>
<p>We have the omega-3s, so EPA, DHA,</p>
<p>and then you mentioned there&rsquo;s a third category.</p>
<p>What would you place in your third category</p>
<p>of foods or supplement-based nutrients</p>
<p>that our health, brain and or body health,</p>
<p>can really benefit from?</p>
<p>I mean, I think the most obvious would be vitamin D,</p>
<p>which is actually, as you know, a steroid hormone</p>
<p>that we produce when we&rsquo;re in the sun.</p>
<p>Depending on the time of year,</p>
<p>we can make it in our skin</p>
<p>and depending on how much melanin we have in our skin</p>
<p>or whether or not we&rsquo;re wearing sunscreen</p>
<p>or how old we are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sliding scale on how efficient that process is.</p>
<p>And as I understand, there&rsquo;s an inverse relationship</p>
<p>where the darker your skin is, naturally,</p>
<p>the more vitamin D you need to consume.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Well, the darker your skin is, the harder it is.</p>
<p>So there was a study out of the University of Chicago,</p>
<p>this was several years ago,</p>
<p>where they looked at African-Americans</p>
<p>and compared African-Americans to Caucasians</p>
<p>with light skin, fair skin,</p>
<p>and how well they could make vitamin D from sun exposure</p>
<p>and how long they had to be in the sun</p>
<p>to make X amount, right?</p>
<p>And it turns out that African-Americans</p>
<p>with darker pigmentation,</p>
<p>which protects them from the burning rays of the sun,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a natural sunscreen,</p>
<p>had to stay in the sun like six times as long</p>
<p>as someone with none of that natural sunscreen.</p>
<p>So I think the take-home there is,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of people with a darker skin</p>
<p>living in sub-Saharan Africa</p>
<p>or people living in India with darker skin</p>
<p>or in the Philippines, you know,</p>
<p>these equatorial regions where there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you tend to see darker skin</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s protection from the burning rays of the sun.</p>
<p>And adaptation.</p>
<p>They are in the sun more.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re getting more vitamin D,</p>
<p>but people that maybe moved to the United States,</p>
<p>to like Minnesota or in a place where, you know,</p>
<p>UVB radiation isn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>getting to the atmosphere 12 months out of the year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only getting there four months, for example.</p>
<p>Or even living in our modern day society</p>
<p>where people just don&rsquo;t go outside anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re inside, we&rsquo;re at our laptops in school,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at work, we&rsquo;re in our cubicle, whatever.</p>
<p>So supplementation does play a major role,</p>
<p>not only for people with, you know,</p>
<p>darker skin that aren&rsquo;t outside all the time,</p>
<p>but for everyone.</p>
<p>70% of the US population has inadequate vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>70 of the whole-</p>
<p>US.</p>
<p>So this is everyone.</p>
<p>And so I think that insufficient levels</p>
<p>defined as less than 30 nanograms per milliliter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of defined by the Endocrine Society,</p>
<p>looking at a lot of different aggregate studies,</p>
<p>and all-cause mortality, for example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of different meta-analyses</p>
<p>of all-cause mortality studies,</p>
<p>where vitamin D levels really seem to be ideal</p>
<p>between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter.</p>
<p>And so in order to get to that level,</p>
<p>if you are not outside all the time,</p>
<p>live in Southern California where you&rsquo;re always outside</p>
<p>without sunscreen on, I always wear sunscreen</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to protect my skin</p>
<p>from so many wrinkles and stuff, right?</p>
<p>But also skin cancer is, you know,</p>
<p>somewhat of an issue as well.</p>
<p>So basically the point is that vitamin D</p>
<p>is a steroid hormone,</p>
<p>meaning it actually binds to a receptor</p>
<p>and another receptor dimerizes with it,</p>
<p>the retinoid receptor.</p>
<p>And that complex goes into the nucleus of a cell</p>
<p>where your DNA is,</p>
<p>and it recognizes little sequences of DNA</p>
<p>called vitamin D response elements,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called VDREs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re specific sequences of DNA</p>
<p>that this complex vitamin D bound,</p>
<p>the vitamin D receptor goes inside and recognizes</p>
<p>and turns on a whole host of genes,</p>
<p>turns off a whole host of genes.</p>
<p>I mean, this is important stuff.</p>
<p>Like imagine 70% of the population</p>
<p>having insufficient testosterone, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a steroid hormone.</p>
<p>Which we might be headed there, but probably not.</p>
<p>No, I think that it&rsquo;s names are very important.</p>
<p>And I think that one of the issues</p>
<p>is that vitamin D is called vitamin D.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not called DHEA or, you know, variant, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a hormone.</p>
<p>I also, I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re mentioning skin</p>
<p>as the major kind of interface</p>
<p>between the environment and vitamin D synthesis,</p>
<p>because a lot of people think of skin</p>
<p>as just a protective sheath around us</p>
<p>or something to adorn ourselves</p>
<p>with earrings or tattoos or whatever.</p>
<p>But skin obviously serves those roles,</p>
<p>but the skin is an endocrine organ.</p>
<p>It has the capacity to make things that impact hormones</p>
<p>and to make hormones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this beautiful study out this last year</p>
<p>where this took place over in Israel</p>
<p>where they had people get outside for 20 to 30 minutes</p>
<p>a day, three times a week,</p>
<p>exposing a culturally acceptable yet, you know,</p>
<p>substantial amount of their skin during that time</p>
<p>and saw big increases in testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And this is through a keratinocyte-linked pathway</p>
<p>involving P53.</p>
<p>They did a bunch of, this was done in humans,</p>
<p>but they did some knockout studies in parallel.</p>
<p>And what this study told me or reminded me</p>
<p>is that skin is an endocrine organ.</p>
<p>So the idea that sun could trigger the activation</p>
<p>of a production of a hormone is really interesting</p>
<p>and makes total sense.</p>
<p>So when vitamin D gets into cells</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s binding to these VDREs,</p>
<p>what sorts of things are they triggering?</p>
<p>So like for testosterone,</p>
<p>we know it&rsquo;s gonna trigger protein synthesis,</p>
<p>muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera.</p>
<p>With estrogen, it&rsquo;s gonna be keep your neurons going,</p>
<p>your joints feeling good.</p>
<p>I always remind people that, by the way,</p>
<p>because guys are always seem to want</p>
<p>to increase their testosterone and reduce their estrogen,</p>
<p>just remind people, if you reduce your estrogen, guys,</p>
<p>your libido will plummet to near zero.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t crush your estrogen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll also make you stupid.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already stupid, it will make you stupid.</p>
<p>So estrogen&rsquo;s vitally important for males and females.</p>
<p>When vitamin D gets into cells,</p>
<p>what sorts of things is it stimulating?</p>
<p>Okay, so first of all, it&rsquo;s regulating more than 5%</p>
<p>of the protein-encoded human genome.</p>
<p>And this was, I say more than</p>
<p>because when I was looking at this data really in depth</p>
<p>back in starting in 2012 to 2014, it was that,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s now grown.</p>
<p>But one of the important things that you&rsquo;ll find interesting</p>
<p>that I published on back in 2014</p>
<p>was that I&rsquo;d gone through this big published database</p>
<p>where someone had published all these genes</p>
<p>they found VDREs in.</p>
<p>And basically I found that tryptophan hydroxylase 1</p>
<p>and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 was on there.</p>
<p>And so then I started looking at the sequence</p>
<p>and I was doing some in silico work.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the VDREs</p>
<p>and tryptophan hydroxylase 2,</p>
<p>so for people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase</p>
<p>is an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin.</p>
<p>So tryptophan is what we,</p>
<p>an amino acid that we get from our food.</p>
<p>You convert serotonin,</p>
<p>you convert tryptophan into serotonin in the gut,</p>
<p>but you also do it in the brain.</p>
<p>However, serotonin does not cross the blood brain barrier.</p>
<p>So tryptophan has to get into your brain</p>
<p>and then you have to convert it to serotonin in your brain.</p>
<p>Well, the enzyme that does that in your brain</p>
<p>is called tryptophan hydroxylase 2</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s activated by vitamin D.</p>
<p>The one in the gut is actually tryptophan hydroxylase 1.</p>
<p>Some of my published work hypothesize</p>
<p>that it might actually be repressed by vitamin D</p>
<p>because it has a sequence.</p>
<p>The sequence itself, this 12 nucleotide sequence,</p>
<p>it can determine to some degree</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s gonna be activated or turned off.</p>
<p>And so like I was able to kind of look at that</p>
<p>and think, oh, maybe this and that.</p>
<p>And so since then there&rsquo;ve been some groups</p>
<p>that have confirmed more with in vivo</p>
<p>and or in vitro studies,</p>
<p>because mine was all in silico and all that stuff.</p>
<p>But anyways, so serotonin, a really important one.</p>
<p>But most people, I mean,</p>
<p>this is regulating our immune cell, immune system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s regulating our blood pressure,</p>
<p>all that water retention.</p>
<p>I mean, bone, of course, homeostasis, 5%, more than 5%.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t tell you like so much.</p>
<p>I mean, and with 70% of the US population deficient,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think that this could be the linchpin</p>
<p>in a number of really important issues.</p>
<p>So supplementing vitamin D3 is what I normally,</p>
<p>here is the, I do, I take,</p>
<p>I think I ended up taking 5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs</p>
<p>of vitamin D3 per day.</p>
<p>Just done that for a long time</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had my levels tested and they&rsquo;re in range.</p>
<p>But I have a family member, I&rsquo;ll just mention this.</p>
<p>I have a family member who was not feeling well,</p>
<p>just kind of feeling off, a little low,</p>
<p>had some digestive issues.</p>
<p>This went on a long period of time.</p>
<p>Was taking, on my recommendation, 15,000 IUs of D3</p>
<p>and was still deficient in D3.</p>
<p>Now takes, and I&rsquo;m not suggesting anyone do this</p>
<p>as a special case perhaps,</p>
<p>but no chronic illness that we&rsquo;re aware of,</p>
<p>needs to take 30,000 IUs per day</p>
<p>in order to bring their D3 range just into normal.</p>
<p>Which is, to me, is striking because they eat quite well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a healthy weight, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it, and it&rsquo;s made a tremendous difference</p>
<p>in terms of their mood.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is correlative.</p>
<p>Now they feel better, they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Who knows, they&rsquo;re probably also getting outside more.</p>
<p>But I mean, I think people need to get tested.</p>
<p>They need to get their D3 levels tested.</p>
<p>But where and what is a good starting range</p>
<p>for people to think about D3 supplementation?</p>
<p>And again, foods that can increase D3.</p>
<p>So vitamin D3 is a good way to supplement with it.</p>
<p>Their vitamin D2 would be a plant source.</p>
<p>You often find it fortified in like foods like milk,</p>
<p>usually D2.</p>
<p>Does anyone still drink milk besides kids?</p>
<p>Out here it&rsquo;s like, you can&rsquo;t find cow&rsquo;s milk.</p>
<p>I mean, all the lattes that you&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>Soy milk, what&rsquo;s the other one?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fortified in those as well.</p>
<p>Oh, they are, okay.</p>
<p>They are, yeah, they&rsquo;re fortified in-</p>
<p>I have a hard time finding cow&rsquo;s milk.</p>
<p>Almond milk and oat milk and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re in all that stuff.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is naturally to some degree in fatty fish.</p>
<p>Like, you know, like you think about cod liver oil, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it has vitamin D, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna correct a deficiency</p>
<p>with eating fish for your vitamin D.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re either gonna correct it with sun exposure,</p>
<p>being in the right area, having the right amount of sun</p>
<p>and being the right age, because as you get old,</p>
<p>you become very inefficient at doing that,</p>
<p>converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 in your skin.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably what was going on here</p>
<p>because this person is getting up in their-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of single nucleotide polymorphisms.</p>
<p>We talked about ApoE4 previously,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a variety of genes that people have,</p>
<p>very common actually.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve had many people that have had to do,</p>
<p>done that exact same thing.</p>
<p>So measuring your vitamin D levels</p>
<p>before and after supplementation</p>
<p>is the only way you&rsquo;re gonna figure that out, right?</p>
<p>Very important.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t measure it, like you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like, you know, you can&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t measure.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a variety of SNPs</p>
<p>that basically make that conversion inefficient.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;ve been a lot of these,</p>
<p>Mendelian randomization studies.</p>
<p>So these are studies where people,</p>
<p>scientists will look at common SNPs,</p>
<p>people that have these common variations of a gene</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little more than 1% of the population.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a random mutation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually found in a sizable percent of the population.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ve looked at various outcomes.</p>
<p>And a lot of times they&rsquo;ll look at genes</p>
<p>that are also involved in some kind of lifestyle factors.</p>
<p>So vitamin D and SNPs</p>
<p>that basically make the conversion of vitamin,</p>
<p>either vitamin D precursor into D3</p>
<p>or in D3 into 25-hydroxy vitamin D</p>
<p>or into the active steroid hormone,</p>
<p>which is 125-hydroxy vitamin D.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a variety of different SNPs that show people.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not looking at vitamin D levels at all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at just the SNPs.</p>
<p>And you know, if they have it, they have low vitamin D.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s really a way</p>
<p>of doing a beautifully randomized controlled trial</p>
<p>with an observational study</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not biased.</p>
<p>You know, vitamin D levels are also associated with health.</p>
<p>People that have higher vitamin D</p>
<p>are either outside more, they&rsquo;re more physically active,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re aware of their health</p>
<p>and their supplementing, right?</p>
<p>So you always have to worry about that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing an observational study.</p>
<p>But when dealing in a randomization,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beautiful for that reason</p>
<p>where you now just randomly,</p>
<p>people randomly have these genes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s no health status.</p>
<p>Like if you have the SNP, like your friend,</p>
<p>like your family member was healthy and all that,</p>
<p>you know, they were healthy.</p>
<p>And yet they couldn&rsquo;t get their D levels up, right?</p>
<p>So these Mendelian randomization studies</p>
<p>have found that people that can&rsquo;t convert</p>
<p>into the precursor, the 25-hydroxy vitamin D,</p>
<p>which is usually what&rsquo;s measured,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most stable form of vitamin D in the body,</p>
<p>they have a higher all-cause mortality if they can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So people with, you know, that don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>have a lower all-cause mortality.</p>
<p>They have a higher respiratory-related mortality.</p>
<p>They have a higher cancer-related mortality.</p>
<p>So to me, now why did I get on this rant?</p>
<p>Oh, because you&rsquo;re a family member.</p>
<p>So basically they also are more likely</p>
<p>to get multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>This has all been done with Mendelian randomization.</p>
<p>And so it really does hammer home the importance</p>
<p>of measuring your vitamin D levels</p>
<p>and being very proactive about that.</p>
<p>I mean, you can get it done anyway.</p>
<p>Your doctor will do it.</p>
<p>You ask him to do it, you know?</p>
<p>So supplementation-wise,</p>
<p>typically if you don&rsquo;t have one of those SNPs,</p>
<p>for the most part, taking 1,000 IUs of vitamin D</p>
<p>will raise blood levels</p>
<p>by around five nanograms per milliliter.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re deficient,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 20 nanograms per milliliter,</p>
<p>and you wanna get to 40.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna need at least 4,000 IUs</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have any of these SNPs</p>
<p>that change your metabolism of vitamin D, right?</p>
<p>Does it matter when you take it,</p>
<p>relative to sun exposure, time of day,</p>
<p>with or without food?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some not-so-great preliminary evidence</p>
<p>suggesting maybe time of day is important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it really,</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t seem to find anything that really suggests,</p>
<p>because for it to actually be converted into the hormone,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s stored.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>These steroid hormones are slow-acting.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not like a media thing, right?</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ll get some new data that&rsquo;s like otherwise,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t, yeah.</p>
<p>It simplifies the problem anyway.</p>
<p>So for people who are going to be stubborn</p>
<p>and not get their D3 levels tested,</p>
<p>or their D levels tested,</p>
<p>and simply say, oh, I&rsquo;ll just take some D3.</p>
<p>That was me, by the way, until I got tested.</p>
<p>I threw 5,000 IUs into the mix and figured,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s not gonna kill me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll bring my vitamin D levels up.</p>
<p>I realize that&rsquo;s a bit of a coarse way to approach it,</p>
<p>but I feel fine, and I&rsquo;m still breathing in ambulatory.</p>
<p>So is that reasonable?</p>
<p>1,000 to 5,000 IUs for most people will be reasonably safe.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re not making,</p>
<p>just assuming that people are gonna just jump to it</p>
<p>without the blood test.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I think that if we look at the literature,</p>
<p>the scientific literature,</p>
<p>it is extremely hard to get like hypercalcemia,</p>
<p>which would be the major concern</p>
<p>with really high levels of vitamin D3 supplementation.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking like hundreds of thousands of IU a day</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Now, the upper tolerable intake was set</p>
<p>by the Medicine Institute to be 4,000.</p>
<p>It was just like a safe,</p>
<p>it was kind of like one of those things where it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>I personally take 5,000 IUs a day as well.</p>
<p>And my levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mil,</p>
<p>and I do out, I don&rsquo;t put sunscreen on like all the time.</p>
<p>Like I do put it on my face and I wear a hat,</p>
<p>but like some of my skin is being exposed.</p>
<p>So I do make it, you know, from the sun as well.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you brought up the fact that you keep arms exposed</p>
<p>because in these studies that I mentioned before,</p>
<p>looking at sun exposure on skin</p>
<p>and increases in other hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone, estrogen mainly,</p>
<p>it became clear from looking at those data</p>
<p>that the amount of skin that you expose is important,</p>
<p>which makes perfect sense once you hear that.</p>
<p>But I think most people are thinking,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m out in the sun,</p>
<p>but are you wearing shorts and a t-shirt,</p>
<p>or are you wearing a sweatshirt and it&rsquo;s a hoodie,</p>
<p>or, you know, are you all covered up out in the sun?</p>
<p>Well, that might be great</p>
<p>for setting your circadian rhythm</p>
<p>by way of a light to through the eyes,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the primary mechanism for that.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that the more of your body surface</p>
<p>that you can safely and appropriately,</p>
<p>please folks, appropriately exposed to the sun,</p>
<p>the more vitamin D you&rsquo;re going to create, right?</p>
<p>So laying out on your back deck in shorts and a t-shirt</p>
<p>with arms exposed and legs exposed</p>
<p>is a very different stimulus</p>
<p>than walking around in jeans and a sweatshirt, right?</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Especially if you have sunscreen on your face.</p>
<p>I know it almost seems like trivially simple,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure that people are used to thinking</p>
<p>about their skin as a interface to create these hormones.</p>
<p>So surface area matters.</p>
<p>And by the way, you know,</p>
<p>there have been studies looking at people</p>
<p>that are deficient in vitamin D.</p>
<p>In this case, it was African-Americans</p>
<p>that were given a 4,000 IU a day vitamin D supplement</p>
<p>to bring them back to sufficient levels.</p>
<p>And this was a smaller study than I would like,</p>
<p>but it reversed their epigenetic aging by like three years.</p>
<p>Because again, it&rsquo;s a hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s regulating more than 5%</p>
<p>of your protein encoding human genome.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been studies looking at vitamin D receptor</p>
<p>knockout mice.</p>
<p>And I use this a lot in my presentations</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m talking about vitamin D and longevity.</p>
<p>But if you look at these animals,</p>
<p>the vitamin D receptor, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>vitamin D binds to the receptor</p>
<p>and then it complexes with the retinoid receptor</p>
<p>and they go into the nucleus of the complex</p>
<p>and you turn on and turn off genes.</p>
<p>Well, if you get rid of that receptor,</p>
<p>which is what you can do in animal studies,</p>
<p>you can sort of determine like what effects</p>
<p>there will be with no vitamin D, right?</p>
<p>Like how do you study no vitamin D?</p>
<p>And so what was found was that these animals,</p>
<p>in fact, I don&rsquo;t think it was a complete knockout</p>
<p>or, you know, because I think it might be embryonic lethal,</p>
<p>but-</p>
<p>Some hypomorph, which is basically geek speak</p>
<p>for a gene is vastly reduced in its function,</p>
<p>number and function, number, people know what I mean,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t eliminated completely.</p>
<p>Right, well, these animals,</p>
<p>if you look at them after the age of four months,</p>
<p>I mean, the mice look like,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re accelerated aging,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re wrinkled, they have no hair.</p>
<p>I mean, they just, I mean, their lifespan shorter.</p>
<p>I mean, they just, you can look at this animal</p>
<p>and not know anything about mice or work with them</p>
<p>and be like, that animal looks like it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>of course, mice lifespans are only like two,</p>
<p>two and a half years, but like 500 years old.</p>
<p>Right, it looks like it went to graduate school twice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually graduate school is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I like to think I aged backwards in graduate school,</p>
<p>which is not true.</p>
<p>I look at the photos, I definitely aged forward.</p>
<p>You, on the other hand,</p>
<p>look exactly the same way you did 10 years ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that to flatter you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>I mean, the data are the data, it&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m definitely gonna try</p>
<p>and get my omega-3 percentage up there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna, you know, hinge at all on that,</p>
<p>but clearly you&rsquo;re doing a lot of things right.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m taking vitamin D3,</p>
<p>I still need to get out into the sun, correct?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t know that,</p>
<p>or at least I have family members</p>
<p>that have been a little bit resistant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I take my vitamin D</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t need to get outside as much.</p>
<p>I think people are really afraid of getting out into the sun</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re worried about melanomas.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m as, to be honest,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m as scared of sunscreen as I am of melanoma.</p>
<p>Like that some of the things in sunscreen are really spooky,</p>
<p>mainly the compound.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not one of these conspirators.</p>
<p>I drink tap water.</p>
<p>Listen, folks, like people cringe with it.</p>
<p>I drink tap water.</p>
<p>I have the occasional croissant or donut.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you know, I&rsquo;m 90%, 80% of the time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing the right things the right way, I think,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m now gonna improve on them</p>
<p>with this new knowledge.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like what I see in most sunscreens</p>
<p>because if you look at these compounds,</p>
<p>they cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want compounds crossing the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Titanium dioxide.</p>
<p>Dioxide, some of the triclosans</p>
<p>that are also in these cleansers.</p>
<p>I mean, once you know a little bit about neurons, folks,</p>
<p>you realize that the neurons you got</p>
<p>are basically the ones you&rsquo;ve got for your entire life.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a reason why there&rsquo;s a blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>a blood ovary, and a blood testes barriers</p>
<p>because the genetic material resides</p>
<p>in the testes, the ovaries,</p>
<p>and the brain, those neurons don&rsquo;t turn over.</p>
<p>There are a few new neurons,</p>
<p>but not that many unless you&rsquo;re a mouse, frankly.</p>
<p>And so protecting those is very key.</p>
<p>And a lot of the things in sunscreen are downright dangerous.</p>
<p>So I think there are sunscreens that are safe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very hard to figure out</p>
<p>which sunscreens are free of these compounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amazed that they&rsquo;re still on the market, frankly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always geared towards the ones</p>
<p>with the minerals that are like reflecting it.</p>
<p>It is somewhat difficult to penetrate things</p>
<p>all the way through the skin and get into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, but I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe some of these compounds get in there easily.</p>
<p>I have seen the evidence with some of those things.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is some evidence they go transdermal.</p>
<p>And they-</p>
<p>And they get in, okay.</p>
<p>Well, I know that some of them react with the sun</p>
<p>and while they do protect from the UVA and or B,</p>
<p>they like form massive reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>and carcinogen.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like the very thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to protect yourself from</p>
<p>might actually cause, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, like it&rsquo;s completely speculation,</p>
<p>but there is like, I think some more and more evidence</p>
<p>coming out with some of those compounds.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t remember all of them off the top of my head,</p>
<p>but a lot of high-end ones also have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the chemical sunscreen ones, the chemical ones.</p>
<p>We should do, I&rsquo;m proposing that we do a journal club.</p>
<p>A journal club, folks, is where academics get together</p>
<p>and read papers and they get together</p>
<p>and they pick apart the papers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strong correlation</p>
<p>between being an early graduate student</p>
<p>and being the most critical.</p>
<p>Because once you&rsquo;ve actually published some papers,</p>
<p>you realize that, you know, most studies,</p>
<p>people are doing their best</p>
<p>within the context of what they can do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;d be great to do a journal club</p>
<p>at some point about sunscreens.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;d love to really figure out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in these compounds.</p>
<p>I mean, people are using them like crazy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not one of these people who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, I won&rsquo;t use commercial toothpaste or anything like that.</p>
<p>I, like I said, I drink tap water.</p>
<p>I use commercial toothpaste, whatever.</p>
<p>But when it comes to sunscreen, it freaks me out</p>
<p>because some of these compounds do go transdermal</p>
<p>and some of them cross the blood brain barrier.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to keep my neurons free of that stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;re speculating now.</p>
<p>Wear a hat.</p>
<p>Wear a hat.</p>
<p>But get out in the sun and get your D3 levels up.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve talked about these plant-based compounds,</p>
<p>the omega-3s and D3.</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s something else</p>
<p>that you just absolutely must throw into the mix,</p>
<p>I probably will return us to the conversation</p>
<p>that I opened up with, which is about cold and heat,</p>
<p>which admittedly, I pulled us off that path.</p>
<p>So I wanna take full responsibility for that.</p>
<p>But before I do that,</p>
<p>I just wanna offer you the opportunity.</p>
<p>Is there anything that fit to supplement-based</p>
<p>or food-based compounds that you think</p>
<p>are especially useful for brain and or body health?</p>
<p>I do think magnesium is important in there as well.</p>
<p>I think, again, about 40% of the US population</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get enough magnesium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an essential mineral</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re supposed to be getting from our diet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Involved in everything.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also involved in vitamin D metabolism.</p>
<p>And in fact, being deficient in magnesium</p>
<p>may make it more difficult for you</p>
<p>to actually make vitamin D hormone.</p>
<p>So that 125-hydroxyvitamin D.</p>
<p>So one of those other factors,</p>
<p>again, we talked about genetics,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also magnesium status as well.</p>
<p>Considering 40%, that&rsquo;s a big number.</p>
<p>Now, magnesium&rsquo;s also involved in making ATP,</p>
<p>the energetic currency of our cells.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically all of our cells need ATP to do anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also involved in utilizing ATP</p>
<p>as well as DNA repair enzymes.</p>
<p>These are enzymes that are involved</p>
<p>in repairing damage to our DNA.</p>
<p>I personally think that magnesium insufficiency</p>
<p>is a insidious type,</p>
<p>causes an insidious type of damage daily</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t look in the mirror and see.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re deficient in vitamin C,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, my gums are falling apart.</p>
<p>I have scurvy, right?</p>
<p>But like, you can&rsquo;t see DNA damage.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see it, but it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening right now in my body</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s happening in your body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening, normal metabolism is happening every day.</p>
<p>But we repair that damage.</p>
<p>We have repair enzymes in our body</p>
<p>called DNA repair enzymes.</p>
<p>They require magnesium.</p>
<p>Magnesium is a cofactor for them.</p>
<p>What that means is, you know,</p>
<p>a cofactor means enzymes need it to function properly.</p>
<p>And so without that cofactor,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not doing it properly.</p>
<p>And I like, the way I like to think about magnesium,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy because people go, what food should I eat?</p>
<p>Right, naturally, that&rsquo;s the next question.</p>
<p>Well, magnesium is at the center of a chlorophyll molecule.</p>
<p>Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color.</p>
<p>So dark leafy greens are high in magnesium.</p>
<p>Basically, what does the 40% insufficiency</p>
<p>in the US tell us?</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t eating their greens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not eating their greens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re eating their packaged food.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re eating their processed food.</p>
<p>The standard American diet isn&rsquo;t really high</p>
<p>in dark leafy greens.</p>
<p>So dark leafy greens are how I like to get my magnesium.</p>
<p>I think it comes along with all these other important,</p>
<p>I mean, you get calcium in them.</p>
<p>You get vitamin K1.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting a lot of other micronutrients</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting other compounds that we don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>and ones that we know about, like sulforaphane, right?</p>
<p>As with broccoli, do I need to eat</p>
<p>the dark leafy greens raw?</p>
<p>And in this case, I&rsquo;m a little more open to it</p>
<p>because I actually like the taste of, dare I say, kale.</p>
<p>And kale&rsquo;s a dark leafy green, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously, I&rsquo;m not-</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s high in lutein and zeaxanthin as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a trichromat, meaning I&rsquo;m not colorblind,</p>
<p>but I just wanna make sure it falls</p>
<p>under the strict category.</p>
<p>Because every once in a while, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, I eat my vegetables.</p>
<p>I like avocados.</p>
<p>And people remind me avocados are not a vegetable.</p>
<p>I love vegetables also.</p>
<p>But so kale, what are some other examples?</p>
<p>Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard,</p>
<p>rainbow chard, romaine lettuce.</p>
<p>Is the bitterness an important component to this?</p>
<p>For magnesium, no, but for sulforaphane,</p>
<p>sulforaphane for cruciferous vegetables,</p>
<p>that would be the brassica family.</p>
<p>But your question about cooking them.</p>
<p>So magnesium, it is bound to the food matrix</p>
<p>and it can be somewhat less bioavailable.</p>
<p>So cooking it can somewhat release the magnesium,</p>
<p>but it goes into the water too.</p>
<p>So you have to either steam it</p>
<p>or kind of get your water in.</p>
<p>You could drink it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I personally don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Well, if you don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not gonna worry.</p>
<p>But I also like, I do supplement with magnesium.</p>
<p>I do take around a,</p>
<p>so supplementation with magnesium.</p>
<p>I mean, we could go on and on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep this short and sweet</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna get back to the other stuff.</p>
<p>But it can cause GI distress at like high doses.</p>
<p>I personally like to take around 130 or 135 milligrams.</p>
<p>That way it&rsquo;s not like a huge bolus to my gut.</p>
<p>But I think it depends on the form of magnesium too.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you can take like magnesium 3-8, for example,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t affect the gut as much.</p>
<p>Magnesium citrate.</p>
<p>Citrate is what I take.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a pretty potent gut stimulus.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like it&rsquo;s a little bit harder to digest.</p>
<p>Well, I take 135 milligrams should be pretty good.</p>
<p>And citrate actually, oh boy, do we wanna go here?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s up to you and we don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>I personally, I&rsquo;ve been supplementing</p>
<p>with magnesium for a long time.</p>
<p>I use threonate and bisglycinate and malate</p>
<p>for different reasons.</p>
<p>So yes, I would love to go there if you&rsquo;re willing to.</p>
<p>I would say malate would be the best.</p>
<p>And that has to do with the short-chain fatty acids</p>
<p>being good for the gut and a lot of work done</p>
<p>by a former colleague of mine and good friend,</p>
<p>Mark Shigenaga, showing that the short-chain fatty acids,</p>
<p>citrate, malate, lactate,</p>
<p>but specifically malate really and lactate</p>
<p>are the major ones that get into the gut epithelial cells</p>
<p>and are energy source for the mitochondria</p>
<p>and the goblet cells.</p>
<p>So anyways, whole other topic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I take malate because I was told</p>
<p>that it would be helpful.</p>
<p>First of all, it doesn&rsquo;t make me sleepy</p>
<p>like some of the other forms of magnesium,</p>
<p>which act as a mild sedative for me.</p>
<p>They do tap into the GABAergic pathway,</p>
<p>neurotransmitter folks that in general,</p>
<p>broad sweeping generalization here</p>
<p>can have somewhat of a sedative quality,</p>
<p>which is why I take magnesium threonate</p>
<p>and or bisglycinate before sleep,</p>
<p>30 to 60 minutes before sleep.</p>
<p>Definitely enhances my transition time to sleep</p>
<p>and the depth of sleep.</p>
<p>No question in my experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some data that threonate can be neuroprotective,</p>
<p>although those studies are still ongoing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting the sense that maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a little more skeptical of that than I am.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen the studies with the threonate.</p>
<p>I think like looking at the actual data</p>
<p>from the one clinical study,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t statistical significance</p>
<p>until all three of the pieces of data were pulled together.</p>
<p>But that really could just be</p>
<p>because their sample size was too small.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m thinking that paired with it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some work.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Guosong Liu&rsquo;s work on with,</p>
<p>so in the, this is getting kind of</p>
<p>into inside ball of neuroscience,</p>
<p>you know, that the quality of the labs matters folks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not accessible</p>
<p>to people outside of fields.</p>
<p>And, you know, Guosong Liu and some of the other folks</p>
<p>at that time at MIT, I think very highly of their work.</p>
<p>And so the animal studies are indeed just animal studies,</p>
<p>but I was pretty impressed by what they did</p>
<p>in those studies, very pioneering thing</p>
<p>when you think about this being done 10, 12, 15 years ago.</p>
<p>And then yes, we need more human clinical data.</p>
<p>But I, for me, I figured that the,</p>
<p>given the safety profile of MAG threonate,</p>
<p>given that it helps me sleep better</p>
<p>and sleeping better is just better for everything, frankly,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I take it.</p>
<p>And bisglycinate and threonate</p>
<p>seem to be somewhat interchangeable,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know of any reports</p>
<p>that bisglycinate can be neuroprotective.</p>
<p>But malate, I take during the daytime.</p>
<p>For me, and again, this is subjective,</p>
<p>it has a tangible effect in improving</p>
<p>the recovery time from exercise.</p>
<p>So it, I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve been sore from a workout</p>
<p>since I started taking malate.</p>
<p>And I used to get very sore from even kind of</p>
<p>trivial workouts.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on there,</p>
<p>but I keep taking it.</p>
<p>Malate, again, the short-chain fatty acid.</p>
<p>And I mean, you know, when you do heavy,</p>
<p>when you do intense exercise,</p>
<p>you release endotoxin from your gut.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going back to the interesting work</p>
<p>because the malate being the short-chain fatty acid</p>
<p>and, you know, Mark Shuganaga showing,</p>
<p>this is all in animal research, by the way.</p>
<p>But I mean, it was like, you know,</p>
<p>feeding these animals malate,</p>
<p>I mean, it really protected the gut, endotoxin release,</p>
<p>and it affected metabolic syndrome and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But I think malate&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And I always try to eat green apples.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really high in malic acid.</p>
<p>And tart cherries, tart cherries are really high in it</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>They also taste really good.</p>
<p>But I was really interested</p>
<p>in the magnesium threonate stuff.</p>
<p>I take a supplement called Magnesium by Moon Juice.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a little powder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a little bit of monk fruit, but it tastes good.</p>
<p>So I do it a little bit before bedtime as well,</p>
<p>probably several more hours though,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like to drink tons and tons of fluids</p>
<p>before I go to bed.</p>
<p>And it has magnesium threonate</p>
<p>and a variety of other versions of magnesium in it as well.</p>
<p>And I really like it.</p>
<p>But I thought the magnesium threonate stuff</p>
<p>was super interesting.</p>
<p>I, you know, would love to see more clinical data as well.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, once we get it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll probably be like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, it&rsquo;s getting into the brain and it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So, you know, why wait?</p>
<p>Right, and along those lines,</p>
<p>I once put out a post that said, you know,</p>
<p>I feel like there are a number of different categories</p>
<p>of health information consumers online</p>
<p>and understanding which one you&rsquo;re in for which topic</p>
<p>can alleviate a lot of the strain and stress</p>
<p>of finding the information.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people that are perfectly comfortable</p>
<p>with data from a mouse study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if it&rsquo;s done in mice, great, I&rsquo;ll try it.</p>
<p>Other people say, no, it has to be done in humans,</p>
<p>double-blind placebo-controlled studies,</p>
<p>you know, randomized clinical trials, et cetera.</p>
<p>Then other people are just say, you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care about any of that.</p>
<p>Just tell me what you do.</p>
<p>And then other people are saying, you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care what you do.</p>
<p>Just tell me what to do.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this other category,</p>
<p>which are if it&rsquo;s in pill form or powder form,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>And so I think a lot of the battles</p>
<p>of people picking apart people&rsquo;s posts and things</p>
<p>have to do with the fact that people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that people are showing up to the table</p>
<p>in one or some combination of those stances.</p>
<p>We know people that will try anything</p>
<p>and we know people that won&rsquo;t take anything.</p>
<p>So the idea here is to create an array of possibilities</p>
<p>for people, and I think the animal data are very impressive.</p>
<p>We should have you back on to talk.</p>
<p>I take it with the hope of,</p>
<p>because I feel like the animal data is very promising.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like, it probably is, so why not?</p>
<p>Well, and obviously you&rsquo;re doing things right.</p>
<p>So cold and heat converge on some common pathways</p>
<p>related to what you called intermittent challenge,</p>
<p>which I love.</p>
<p>I think if, you know, intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>cold, heat, exercise, I mean,</p>
<p>maybe even intermittent sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>I keep waiting for the intermittent</p>
<p>sleep deprivation movement.</p>
<p>I will say I pull a few all-nighters per year,</p>
<p>just for work demands and procrastination and deadlines.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m the worst combination of academic</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m both a procrastinator and a perfectionist.</p>
<p>So you end up pulling some all-nighters.</p>
<p>The sleep I get the next night is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>I must say it&rsquo;s the sleep of gods,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t recommend anyone use sleep deprivation for that.</p>
<p>But I could imagine that we also evolved</p>
<p>having some sleepless nights.</p>
<p>So this idea of intermittent challenges</p>
<p>is a really attractive one.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that we credit you</p>
<p>with the phrase intermittent challenge.</p>
<p>No, credit Dr. Mark Madsen.</p>
<p>Okay, Dr. Mark Madsen gets credit.</p>
<p>And he has used that phrase.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make sure.</p>
<p>Just like Dr. David Sinclair, I love the xenohormesis.</p>
<p>He was in like one of his publications</p>
<p>just so many years ago.</p>
<p>And I just love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brilliant, a brilliant term.</p>
<p>So Mark Madsen gets credit for that.</p>
<p>Those Harvard guys are pretty smart.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, it&rsquo;s a good school, I guess.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s a good school.</p>
<p>We will credit the appropriate people.</p>
<p>Thank you for that clarification.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the use of deliberate,</p>
<p>what I call deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>only to distinguish it from cold</p>
<p>that you might just be accidentally exposed to.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s sort of obvious when we say cold exposure.</p>
<p>There are some amazing data on cold.</p>
<p>The other day I saw a post from you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve included this in talks before.</p>
<p>I did not know this until I learned it from you.</p>
<p>So credit to you that even 20 seconds of immersion in,</p>
<p>I think it was four degree.</p>
<p>49 degree Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>49 degree Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Okay, I was translating to Celsius,</p>
<p>but 49 degree Fahrenheit water.</p>
<p>So cold water can lead to long lasting increases</p>
<p>in epinephrine adrenaline.</p>
<p>And I have to presume other neuromodulators</p>
<p>and neurochemicals as well.</p>
<p>What are some cold protocols that you find</p>
<p>particularly interesting or attractive</p>
<p>from the standpoint of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>pick your favorite metabolism, neuro slash mood effects,</p>
<p>brown fat stimulation,</p>
<p>which of course weaves back to metabolism.</p>
<p>We could do an entire episode all about cold,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;d love to know is what sort of activity</p>
<p>or stimulus do you think is a reasonable</p>
<p>and particularly potent one to use in terms of cold?</p>
<p>So today I did three minutes at 49 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>I have a cold tub.</p>
<p>So you get in up to your neck.</p>
<p>Well, I try, I keep floating up.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s like really hard.</p>
<p>So the, like, I would say like, maybe most of my shoulder.</p>
<p>I mean, really, I&rsquo;m floating up.</p>
<p>I was telling my husband, I was like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much water in here for me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Or too much salt in there?</p>
<p>Is it like the Dead Sea where you float on top?</p>
<p>Is there salt in there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, he takes care of all the stuff that,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the plunge.</p>
<p>Yeah, and by the way,</p>
<p>the podcast, Nor I am sponsored by Plunge.</p>
<p>That thing is fantastic.</p>
<p>Also, cause it circulates the water.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Which makes sure that you break up the thermal layer</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s even colder.</p>
<p>It is even colder, it sucks.</p>
<p>Anyways, so look, I&rsquo;ll be honest here.</p>
<p>I wish I did more cold than I do.</p>
<p>I do cold when I&rsquo;m gonna go on a podcast.</p>
<p>I definitely do cold when I&rsquo;m gonna do a podcast,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m gonna give a talk or when I&rsquo;m anxious.</p>
<p>I need to make it more of a ritual.</p>
<p>I love doing the sauna.</p>
<p>I hate the cold, I hate it.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s summertime, it&rsquo;s a lot easier</p>
<p>for me to get in the cold in the summertime.</p>
<p>But what I do love about the cold is how I feel after.</p>
<p>And I feel less anxious, I feel good,</p>
<p>I feel more focused, which is why I usually do it</p>
<p>before any type of public speaking</p>
<p>or just when I&rsquo;m just anxious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just get in there.</p>
<p>And so the 20 seconds at 49 degrees,</p>
<p>I think it was 49 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>was really a good number because time and temperature do,</p>
<p>time or duration, I guess it would be a better word,</p>
<p>and temperature do matter.</p>
<p>But you can do 20 seconds at a colder temperature,</p>
<p>which is I prefer, or you can do a minute</p>
<p>or longer at a warmer temperature.</p>
<p>I think there was another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>at one hour, it was like two, three, four.</p>
<p>But who wants to do one hour?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m familiar with that study.</p>
<p>I love, so this is really reveals</p>
<p>just how absolutely nerdy I am</p>
<p>and maybe why some times and relationships</p>
<p>in my life were challenged.</p>
<p>I love reading the method sections of papers.</p>
<p>So people can come at me with a number of things</p>
<p>about papers and I might miss something.</p>
<p>Surely I miss certain things like anybody does,</p>
<p>but the methods I sort of, I relish in reading the methods.</p>
<p>And that paper is really interesting</p>
<p>because they had people sit in lawn chairs, basically,</p>
<p>in swimming pools for an hour.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t really, it was chilly, it wasn&rsquo;t super cold.</p>
<p>I mean, 60 is not, it&rsquo;s not warm,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not ice cold, obviously.</p>
<p>But an hour is ridiculous at some level.</p>
<p>But the increases in dopamine were massive and lasted hours.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really, so the mood enhancing effects</p>
<p>that you report are, they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not imagining that.</p>
<p>Those are almost certainly a consequence</p>
<p>of having slowly elevating,</p>
<p>but significantly elevated dopamine that goes on for hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost a dream-like profile for dopamine</p>
<p>because most everything else, like an Adderall,</p>
<p>a Ritalin, a cup of coffee and a workout drink</p>
<p>or pre-workout drink or something</p>
<p>is gonna give you a big spike in adrenaline and dopamine</p>
<p>and a big crash.</p>
<p>And somehow it creates this really nice contoured profile.</p>
<p>So whatever you&rsquo;re experiencing there</p>
<p>is very nicely supported by the data.</p>
<p>Well, I need to get doing it more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a couple of scary experiences</p>
<p>going from hot to cold where blood pressure changes,</p>
<p>I think, where I basically went straight</p>
<p>from a really hot jacuzzi.</p>
<p>I was in there for like 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I mean, I was doing heat stress.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s toasty.</p>
<p>And then I, for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And then I went straight into, at the time,</p>
<p>it was our pool, it was in like February,</p>
<p>it was like winter time.</p>
<p>And it was 50, it was in the 50s.</p>
<p>It was cold.</p>
<p>And I was in there and I was like listening</p>
<p>to Simon Garfunkel.</p>
<p>I was like trying to stay in a long time,</p>
<p>get on my cold and I was trying to impress Dan</p>
<p>because he like goes in there for like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll stay in there for like 15 minutes.</p>
<p>But I started to feel really like blinky,</p>
<p>like low blood pressure or something.</p>
<p>And I got scared, so I got out.</p>
<p>And then I couldn&rsquo;t stand, like I had vertigo or something.</p>
<p>And I was so scared, I was so scared.</p>
<p>And so, and I&rsquo;ve had a couple of times too</p>
<p>where just going straight from the sauna to it,</p>
<p>to the cold plunge, where I&rsquo;m starting to feel,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, ooh, I feel a little blood pressure change</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>And it makes sense.</p>
<p>The sauna is causing vasodilation and the cold plunge</p>
<p>or cold exposure is causing vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a very, you know, just shock to my system.</p>
<p>And so now I wait, like I wait like a few minutes</p>
<p>before going in, but I do need to kind of like make it more,</p>
<p>the cold more routine because I talk all about the science.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with all the science and, you know,</p>
<p>the norepinephrine or noradrenaline, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s affecting brain and mood.</p>
<p>And you know way more about that than I do.</p>
<p>I know how I feel and I know it&rsquo;s a neurotransmitter</p>
<p>and, you know, it is released,</p>
<p>at least in rats they&rsquo;ve shown, or was it mice?</p>
<p>I think it might&rsquo;ve been rats,</p>
<p>but multiple studies showing in that it&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>from the cold in the brain.</p>
<p>And now in humans as well.</p>
<p>So in that study, that&rsquo;s the, we can put a link to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s published in 2000, European Journal of Physiology,</p>
<p>that big dopamine increase.</p>
<p>They also looked at epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>and saw some really, yeah.</p>
<p>So this has been done in humans.</p>
<p>They did brain.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, not right.</p>
<p>No, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Very hard to measure doping directly from the brain</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re doing microdialysis.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s unfortunately that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>unfortunately their skulls were intact.</p>
<p>Fortunately for them,</p>
<p>unfortunately for the research committee,</p>
<p>their skulls were intact.</p>
<p>So they couldn&rsquo;t measure directly in the brain.</p>
<p>But obviously there&rsquo;s a correlate there.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a very real effect.</p>
<p>I think that, but the advantage of not doing it too often</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re not cold adapted.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s very hard for anyone to get truly cold adapted.</p>
<p>Some people start to look forward to the cold.</p>
<p>And what I think they&rsquo;re looking forward to</p>
<p>is the feeling afterward, that dopamine rush.</p>
<p>But if you get cold adapted,</p>
<p>then it certainly blunts some of the effect.</p>
<p>But I wanna be cold adapted</p>
<p>because that means I have more mitochondria</p>
<p>in my adipose tissue and perhaps even muscle,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s been shown.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s a good opportunity to,</p>
<p>so cold and UCP1, if you could educate us on UCP1,</p>
<p>I find this really interesting.</p>
<p>And I learned about it from you, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so norepinephrine</p>
<p>actually released in the plasma,</p>
<p>it does act as a hormone.</p>
<p>Vasoconstriction is one thing it does,</p>
<p>but it also regulates a variety of molecular functions</p>
<p>that have to do with adaption to cold.</p>
<p>One happening to be,</p>
<p>shivering is a very inefficient way to produce heat,</p>
<p>which is what your body&rsquo;s trying to do</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s exposed to cold.</p>
<p>And your muscles are basically contracting</p>
<p>and producing heat from that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just not very efficient.</p>
<p>So the more eloquent way to do it,</p>
<p>or elegant, I guess, way to do it</p>
<p>is to basically have your mitochondria</p>
<p>produce tons and tons of heat.</p>
<p>So the way it does this is by activating a gene</p>
<p>called UCP1, uncoupling protein one,</p>
<p>norepinephrine is upstream of that, activating it.</p>
<p>So what that does is essentially,</p>
<p>so mitochondria are these little organelles</p>
<p>inside of your cells</p>
<p>that are responsible for producing energy.</p>
<p>Usually that&rsquo;s in the form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what lets everything function inside of your body</p>
<p>from your neurotransmitter production</p>
<p>to your heart beating, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, you can uncouple your mitochondria.</p>
<p>Basically your mitochondria,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like a little battery.</p>
<p>So they have, well, they have a double membrane,</p>
<p>first of all, their structure,</p>
<p>but they have a negative charge on the inside</p>
<p>and they have a positive charge on the inner membrane.</p>
<p>So in between the outer membrane and the inside part.</p>
<p>Like a neuron.</p>
<p>Like a neuron, yeah.</p>
<p>So I guess it&rsquo;s like a neuron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a battery, negative and positive.</p>
<p>Well, basically you can uncouple that charge.</p>
<p>And so that positive charge,</p>
<p>the protons start leaking out of the mitochondria</p>
<p>and your mitochondria freak out.</p>
<p>So this is called uncoupling.</p>
<p>And they start to, it&rsquo;s maximum respiration as we call it.</p>
<p>They try to make as much energy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, I gotta get that proton back,</p>
<p>that gradient, the electrochemical gradient.</p>
<p>And so they just go insane.</p>
<p>And in this case, it&rsquo;s uncoupled energy.</p>
<p>So the energy they&rsquo;re making is actually heat, not ATP.</p>
<p>But heat is, but you&rsquo;re essentially burning substrate.</p>
<p>So who cares?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re burning glucose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re burning lipids.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically burning things and making heat.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what uncoupling does.</p>
<p>And that is a much more efficient way</p>
<p>of producing heat than shivering.</p>
<p>So as you become more adapted,</p>
<p>maybe the longer duration that you&rsquo;ve stayed in the cold</p>
<p>or the more times you&rsquo;ve done it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll no longer shiver anymore.</p>
<p>You will start to then just do this uncoupling type</p>
<p>of thermogenesis as it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>And another type of adaptation that occurs</p>
<p>is you actually produce more mitochondria</p>
<p>in your adipose tissue.</p>
<p>And that actually happens also regulated</p>
<p>by norepinephrine or noradrenaline</p>
<p>through a protein called PGC1-alpha.</p>
<p>And what that protein does is it makes more mitochondria</p>
<p>in your adipose cells.</p>
<p>So per adipose cell, you&rsquo;re getting more mitochondria.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful way to basically make more heat</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, your body&rsquo;s going,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m gonna be exposed to this cold next time.</p>
<p>How can I make sure I don&rsquo;t die?</p>
<p>Oh, I can have more mitochondria</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna make more heat.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re making more mitochondria</p>
<p>in your adipose tissue.</p>
<p>And this is often referred to as like the browning of fat.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is because if you look</p>
<p>under a microscope at a lipid drop,</p>
<p>basically a fat cell, not a lipid drop, an adipocyte,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that it looks darker</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s more mitochondria in there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s referred to as browning fat.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t wanna get into the whole beige, fat, brown.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve had experts on</p>
<p>that talk all about that.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>No, not yet.</p>
<p>I mean, I always think of white fat, beige fat, brown fat</p>
<p>and beige is kind of intermediate.</p>
<p>White can be converted into beige, but-</p>
<p>Right, and beige can take on thermogenic characteristics</p>
<p>essentially.</p>
<p>And so you can activate beige fat</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s thermogenic in the sense</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s burning glucose and or fatty acids.</p>
<p>And producing heat.</p>
<p>So the more you expose yourself to cold,</p>
<p>the more you can brown your fat, so to speak.</p>
<p>And therefore you can tolerate the cold for longer periods,</p>
<p>which people do notice.</p>
<p>And you can then have the thermogenic qualities</p>
<p>of having more brown adipose tissue</p>
<p>or beige activated beige adipose tissue,</p>
<p>which is, you&rsquo;ll get a lot of naysayers out there saying,</p>
<p>oh, brown fat doesn&rsquo;t regulate metabolism at all.</p>
<p>And the reality is there&rsquo;s like thousands of researchers</p>
<p>trying to pill up brown fat and thermogenic.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re trying to make it a pill</p>
<p>because it does affect metabolism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly, if you&rsquo;re obese and trying to lose weight,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna like do that just by doing cold exposure.</p>
<p>You need to do dietary and exercise changes predominantly,</p>
<p>but it does affect metabolism.</p>
<p>And this has been shown in human studies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s another possible mechanism</p>
<p>for affecting metabolism, and that&rsquo;s an adipose tissue,</p>
<p>but you also make more mitochondria and muscle tissue.</p>
<p>And this is regulated not via norepinephrine,</p>
<p>but it is still PGC-1-alpha.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not that anyone else really cares,</p>
<p>but maybe you do, Andrew.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating this up.</p>
<p>So PGC-1-alpha is response to norepinephrine</p>
<p>and adipose tissue to make more mitochondria.</p>
<p>But in muscle tissue, it&rsquo;s unclear what the regulator is.</p>
<p>Cold exposure does it.</p>
<p>So this was shown at least in a couple of studies I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>where people that were exercising,</p>
<p>I believe it may have been men only that were exercising,</p>
<p>did some separate training,</p>
<p>and then did cold water immersion,</p>
<p>something like 50 degrees Fahrenheit, 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And PGC-1-alpha, which is a biomarker</p>
<p>for mitochondrial biogenesis,</p>
<p>which is the generation of new mitochondria.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>You want more mitochondria in your muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with improved muscle mass,</p>
<p>improved endurance.</p>
<p>I mean, mitochondria are essentially</p>
<p>either the making energy in your cell.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t make more mitochondria normally.</p>
<p>Like you have certain inputs,</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training exercise can do it.</p>
<p>And actually make more mitochondria.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, and that&rsquo;s been shown in people.</p>
<p>And I mean-</p>
<p>Weight training or just high-intensity interval training?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen weight training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it in high-intensity interval training,</p>
<p>endurance training,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it hasn&rsquo;t been shown.</p>
<p>I just haven&rsquo;t seen it or that it hasn&rsquo;t been looked at.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for reasons</p>
<p>to finally do more HIIT-type,</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training work.</p>
<p>I do weight training and I do low-intensity cardio.</p>
<p>There was a brilliant study by,</p>
<p>at the time he was a postdoc, Matthew Robinson,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s now gone on to start his own lab</p>
<p>at the University of Oregon Health Science Center.</p>
<p>Great place.</p>
<p>And he did a study where both young and older people were,</p>
<p>they had this whole high-intensity protocol,</p>
<p>which I can&rsquo;t remember what it was,</p>
<p>but their protocol for X amount of time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it was at least a month,</p>
<p>they then measured biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis</p>
<p>in their muscle tissue.</p>
<p>And the amount of mitochondrial biogenesis</p>
<p>in old people specifically,</p>
<p>it happened in both young and old from HIIT,</p>
<p>from the high-intensity interval training,</p>
<p>was, I mean, it was like enormous, at least 50%, I think.</p>
<p>So I mean, it was just like, whoa.</p>
<p>And so like, why would you want that?</p>
<p>Well, mitochondria, your cells are turning over,</p>
<p>you make new cells,</p>
<p>you replace old ones with your mitochondria.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really do that for the most part.</p>
<p>You can, mitochondrial biogenesis does happen,</p>
<p>but you have to stimulate it to happen.</p>
<p>And what happens with your mitochondria</p>
<p>is they essentially are bobbing around inside of your cells</p>
<p>and then they fuse with other mitochondria,</p>
<p>exchange all their content and mitochondrial DNA</p>
<p>and then fizz back apart.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how they kind of stay youngish.</p>
<p>But like, as you age,</p>
<p>you keep doing that with the same pool of mitochondria</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna get a bunch of old mitochondria</p>
<p>mixing old stuff together, right?</p>
<p>So why wouldn&rsquo;t you wanna like bring up</p>
<p>new healthy young mitochondria into that pool, right?</p>
<p>So in my mind, when I hear mitochondrial biogenesis,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like aging.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s the first thing I think of.</p>
<p>So anyways, cold exposure does that.</p>
<p>Other things as well, so.</p>
<p>No, and please, thank you for offering</p>
<p>to somehow filter the level of detail,</p>
<p>but I assure you that listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>are familiar with getting,</p>
<p>drinking from the fire hose of mechanism.</p>
<p>And that was really helpful.</p>
<p>And again, this is just one example</p>
<p>of maybe four or five other things that you&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>at least that are gonna inspire me to change my behaviors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start doing some</p>
<p>high-intensity interval training.</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin was on this podcast recently,</p>
<p>and he told me that the subtle zone two cardio</p>
<p>and the weight training is great,</p>
<p>but that I really should be doing</p>
<p>some max heart rate work per week.</p>
<p>You know, going into max heart rate for 90 seconds</p>
<p>and resting and repeating that, maybe even mild repeats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious as a brief aside</p>
<p>before we talk about heat,</p>
<p>what sort of cardiovascular</p>
<p>or other types of training do you do?</p>
<p>Do you do HIIT?</p>
<p>I imagine you are doing high-intensity interval training.</p>
<p>If you could just give us a sense of the contour</p>
<p>of your week as it relates to exercise,</p>
<p>and because you&rsquo;ve been very gracious</p>
<p>in sharing some of what you do for supplements and food,</p>
<p>what about exercise?</p>
<p>So I, it all depends on my week, of course,</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;ve got going on with my son</p>
<p>and my work schedule.</p>
<p>But I typically, I do a lot of high-intensity interval</p>
<p>Tabatas on a stationary cycle.</p>
<p>I use Peloton because I just like that instructor there,</p>
<p>like telling me what to do</p>
<p>and then me competing with everyone else.</p>
<p>You know, so it works.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re revealing something about your psychology.</p>
<p>This is what we just learned about.</p>
<p>So this podcast is actually just a decoy</p>
<p>for psychological assessment of the guests.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>But so now we know you&rsquo;re competitive, good.</p>
<p>That explains a lot of how you got through graduate school</p>
<p>and do what you do.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting on the Peloton,</p>
<p>and what does it look like</p>
<p>for someone who&rsquo;s not familiar with Peloton?</p>
<p>I know what they are, but I&rsquo;ve never been on one.</p>
<p>You are peddling against the instructor</p>
<p>for how many seconds?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of people that are online</p>
<p>either doing the class with you at the same time</p>
<p>or have all time doing it.</p>
<p>So you can kind of toggle on what you want</p>
<p>and like you can try to compete against</p>
<p>the all time number.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s really competitive.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And the instructor is just there to like whip you,</p>
<p>like, you know, make you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a part of, the brilliance with Peloton is,</p>
<p>like I used to do rush, what&rsquo;s called rush cycle.</p>
<p>And I used to go in, it&rsquo;s basically you go in</p>
<p>and group cycle and have an instructor there</p>
<p>and you do all this high intensity interval training stuff.</p>
<p>And I loved it because there was a competitive aspect to it</p>
<p>that had me working harder than I would work</p>
<p>if it was just me in the room,</p>
<p>like without an instructor or anyone there.</p>
<p>And it was just like, I&rsquo;m at a gym, any gym,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just on a stationary cycle,</p>
<p>listening to a podcast, doing something,</p>
<p>which is fine if that&rsquo;s your group, right?</p>
<p>But there is something about that group setting</p>
<p>that kind of holds you accountable too, right?</p>
<p>And the Peloton made it somehow virtual.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>And I remember being back at rush cycle,</p>
<p>this is before a pandemic,</p>
<p>and people talking about Peloton in my class.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why would I do that?</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s never gonna work.</p>
<p>I need to like be here.</p>
<p>And then the pandemic hit and I was like</p>
<p>all over the Peloton and it works for me really well.</p>
<p>So I tend to do that at least three times a week.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do it more, like, you know, I&rsquo;ll do four.</p>
<p>And I do a 10 minute, just 10, because it&rsquo;s efficient</p>
<p>and I push my ass, I push myself really hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Tabata.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And on means you&rsquo;re pedaling like your life depended on it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re maxing it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of resistance in the pedals?</p>
<p>Well, so you basically, there&rsquo;s a part where you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I always do resistance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like the power, I do the power for,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a part where you&rsquo;re sitting cycling</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to go really fast,</p>
<p>but I always crank the resistance up.</p>
<p>I always go above what they give me.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a part where you&rsquo;re standing</p>
<p>and then you really crank the resistance up,</p>
<p>which I really do.</p>
<p>And like, you feel it in your glutes.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And so they like break it up.</p>
<p>And most of the time you&rsquo;ll have like those two parts.</p>
<p>And I love the efficiency of it.</p>
<p>You just, you get it done.</p>
<p>And people sometimes hear me go 10 minutes</p>
<p>or really you think you work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, look, like you max, you do max,</p>
<p>you Tabata for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s intense.</p>
<p>Yeah, most people can&rsquo;t sprint for the gate</p>
<p>of an airplane they&rsquo;re about to miss carrying a backpack.</p>
<p>So if you think about, if I think about that,</p>
<p>and then I just described myself sprinting</p>
<p>through the airport and going, all right, Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>I got my 90 seconds max heart rate in for you</p>
<p>carrying this thing.</p>
<p>But 20 seconds on 10 seconds off,</p>
<p>repeating that over and over for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So by the time you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;re cooked.</p>
<p>And then I, because I&rsquo;m competitive during the recovery</p>
<p>that they give you at the minute, at the end,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pushing it max, because I want to get a number higher.</p>
<p>Great, so three times a week.</p>
<p>Yeah, three times a week.</p>
<p>And then I always have my sauna on preheating up,</p>
<p>takes about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>And I get it to about 189 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>I hop right in the sauna after my Peloton.</p>
<p>So the elevated heart rate continues?</p>
<p>Is that the rationale?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I literally like down a bunch of water</p>
<p>and then I get in and then I like either read</p>
<p>a science paper, prepare for a presentation or a podcast,</p>
<p>or I hash over things in my mind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because something about getting</p>
<p>in the sauna, I think the stress, the heat stress of it.</p>
<p>So I started doing the sauna in 2009 in graduate school.</p>
<p>Okay, and I-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an early adopter.</p>
<p>I started doing it every day.</p>
<p>I lived across the street.</p>
<p>I lived in a studio apartment with Dan.</p>
<p>We lived in this like small studio apartment,</p>
<p>the smallest apartment you could ever imagine.</p>
<p>And it was across the street from a YMCA,</p>
<p>because I was poor in graduate school.</p>
<p>Very poor, very poor.</p>
<p>I mean, so, you know-</p>
<p>I recall, I recall being, I lived in my lab.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Then again, I lived in my lab as a postdoc.</p>
<p>And as I admit, I lived in my lab with my bulldog</p>
<p>as a faculty member for other reasons.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I get it, when you&rsquo;re a graduate student, you&rsquo;re poor.</p>
<p>Yes, and so I used to go to the sauna</p>
<p>before going into the lab.</p>
<p>And I would, and I would, I started noticing</p>
<p>that I was all of a sudden able to handle stress better.</p>
<p>Like the stress of my six month setback</p>
<p>because of a failed experiment,</p>
<p>which is crushing on top of the pressure</p>
<p>from your, my advisor and my own pressure,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m very competitive with myself</p>
<p>and I put a lot of pressure on myself.</p>
<p>So I was having a hard time.</p>
<p>I mean, I was very stressed out in graduate school</p>
<p>and the sauna started to really noticeably affect my anxiety</p>
<p>and my ability to handle stress.</p>
<p>And I was like, what is going on here?</p>
<p>So I started looking into the literature</p>
<p>and started getting interested in the effects on the brain.</p>
<p>And in fact, at the time I had a friend</p>
<p>who was not actually experimentally,</p>
<p>but theoretically looking into the opioid system.</p>
<p>And basically, so when you get in the sauna,</p>
<p>you release a lot of endorphins.</p>
<p>Endorphins are the feel good opioids</p>
<p>that make you feel good.</p>
<p>But you also release something called dynorphin.</p>
<p>And dynorphin is an endogenous opioid</p>
<p>that binds to a receptor called the kappa opioid receptor,</p>
<p>which dynorphin is responsible for that dysphoric feeling</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the sauna and you&rsquo;re hot</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re running, doing exercise</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s dynorphin, I&rsquo;m speaking absolutely.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s evidence in alcoholics</p>
<p>that some of the symptoms of withdrawal</p>
<p>that they experience are related to dynorphin.</p>
<p>And dynorphin is known to negatively impact</p>
<p>the dopamine receptor system.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s the feel like garbage pathway.</p>
<p>Right, you feel like garbage.</p>
<p>And so you think that that would not be good,</p>
<p>but this is where my friend that comes in,</p>
<p>he was looking at the effects of like treating morphine</p>
<p>or heroin addiction and people that are using those drugs.</p>
<p>They basically, the endorphins or the morphine or heroin,</p>
<p>they bind to a receptor in the brain</p>
<p>called the mu opioid receptor.</p>
<p>And as they take these drugs,</p>
<p>that mu opioid receptor becomes down-regulated.</p>
<p>And so you need more and more of the drug</p>
<p>to feel as good as you did, right?</p>
<p>Well, endorphins also bind to that receptor.</p>
<p>And he was looking into some of the other drugs</p>
<p>that are like salvinorum or something, salvia, it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>It binds to the opioid receptor.</p>
<p>It also makes you kind of feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Anyways, he had put some studies in front of me</p>
<p>that showed basically binding of either dynorphin</p>
<p>or whatever ligand to the kappa opioid receptor</p>
<p>basically sensitizes the mu opioid receptor</p>
<p>to the feel good endorphins and also changes,</p>
<p>I think it also up-regulates it or something.</p>
<p>So basically there&rsquo;s a lasting effect of feeling good.</p>
<p>So the endorphins that you release later</p>
<p>from hugging someone or a joke you&rsquo;re laughing at</p>
<p>or whatever, you feel it for longer, right?</p>
<p>And so anyways, with respect to the sauna,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big sort of hypothesis of mine.</p>
<p>I did kind of publish that part of my hypothesis</p>
<p>in a review article, but I do wish more people</p>
<p>would kind of look into that, that&rsquo;d be amazing.</p>
<p>But what I was getting at, I think,</p>
<p>was I would use the sauna to memorize things.</p>
<p>This is way back in the day and I still do it.</p>
<p>And I wanted to talk to you about this</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something about being in the sauna.</p>
<p>And I think, I don&rsquo;t know if it has to do</p>
<p>with the stress response,</p>
<p>like when you have an emotional trigger,</p>
<p>like you remember things better, right?</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>Absolutely, there is a clear and known explanation</p>
<p>for mechanism for this.</p>
<p>So in the sauna, I mean, you also release norepinephrine</p>
<p>just like you do in the cold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of overlap.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re really, I mean, it is a stressor,</p>
<p>but I like use it to remember things</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m going through something,</p>
<p>I wanna go through a presentation or a talk</p>
<p>or a podcast or whatever.</p>
<p>And I go in that sauna and I mean, you should try it.</p>
<p>Like if you haven&rsquo;t already, I don&rsquo;t know if you have.</p>
<p>I have a sauna and a cold plunge now</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t tried prepare,</p>
<p>I read books in the sauna in the evening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a time I insist on having my phone out of there,</p>
<p>mostly because I, initially,</p>
<p>because I thought I&rsquo;d cook the phone,</p>
<p>but also just to get some separation from the phone</p>
<p>and screens in the evening.</p>
<p>So I read books.</p>
<p>The only challenge sometimes you&rsquo;re dripping sweat</p>
<p>onto the books, but I&rsquo;m willing to forego</p>
<p>a few pages of a book.</p>
<p>The idea that being in this semi-stressful environment</p>
<p>would aid in the learning and retention of information</p>
<p>is really well substantiated by this beautiful work</p>
<p>by a guy named James McGaugh.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if his lab&rsquo;s still active,</p>
<p>but he was at UC Irvine for a while.</p>
<p>And then I think at University of Arizona as well.</p>
<p>They have a great memory group at both places,</p>
<p>very strong in learning and memory, both places.</p>
<p>And he was the one that really defined this</p>
<p>inverted U-shaped function for the relationship</p>
<p>between adrenaline and memory.</p>
<p>Basically, if you&rsquo;re too relaxed and not stressed enough,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna remember any information.</p>
<p>At peak levels of stress, you actually are a memory machine,</p>
<p>at least within the context of whatever it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re describing very well matches with that.</p>
<p>And then, of course, it tapers off</p>
<p>as you really increase adrenaline to the point</p>
<p>where people are starting to lose autonomic function,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re panicking, basically.</p>
<p>But obviously, you&rsquo;re keeping it in range.</p>
<p>The other thing that I would like to ask you about</p>
<p>is in the sauna, of course, there&rsquo;s vasodilation.</p>
<p>And profusion of blood to the brain</p>
<p>is a wonderful way to enhance cognition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even some really nice data showing</p>
<p>that during inhales, as opposed to exhales,</p>
<p>people are better at learning information.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, during the inhale,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking in and absorbing and remembering</p>
<p>more than during exhales.</p>
<p>And these are beautiful studies done in humans, of course.</p>
<p>So I can imagine that vasodilation,</p>
<p>getting more profusion of blood to the brain,</p>
<p>plus a little bit of stress, or maybe a lot of stress</p>
<p>from the epinephrine, and yet it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and then, of course, there&rsquo;s going to be the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to call it placebo,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s going to be the context,</p>
<p>the conditioned place context of it.</p>
<p>Like if we had a good experience</p>
<p>remembering something in the sauna once,</p>
<p>we tend to, the positive association effect</p>
<p>of that location is real.</p>
<p>Just like if people go to a new city and they get robbed,</p>
<p>like if you go to Cincinnati,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Cincinnati,</p>
<p>but you get robbed in Cincinnati,</p>
<p>your purse gets taken or your wallet gets taken.</p>
<p>You kind of hate Cincinnati as a tourist,</p>
<p>but that could happen in any number of different cities.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true.</p>
<p>So if something good happens someplace,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining that it&rsquo;s a combination of those effects,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll start, it would be very hard to do this</p>
<p>in the cold.</p>
<p>I feel like the cold is a very potent,</p>
<p>I think it takes you too far down that curve,</p>
<p>the McGaugh curve.</p>
<p>I have to sing songs or something when I&rsquo;m in there.</p>
<p>Distract yourself.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I sing songs.</p>
<p>But afterward, you&rsquo;re very efficient at learning.</p>
<p>After I am, and with respect to the sauna,</p>
<p>vasodilation does occur.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap between moderate intensity,</p>
<p>aerobic exercise and heat stress.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine, when you&rsquo;re exercising,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re elevating your core body temperature,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sweating.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re actually in the sauna,</p>
<p>blood does get redistributed to the skin</p>
<p>to facilitate sweating, but much like exercise,</p>
<p>blood flow in general is improved to the brain,</p>
<p>to the muscles, everywhere.</p>
<p>So I think generally speaking that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s studies showing that sauna use</p>
<p>is associated with a much lower risk of dementia</p>
<p>and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>Like people that use it four to seven times a week</p>
<p>have greater than 60% reduction in dementia</p>
<p>and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease risk compared to once.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to cut you off.</p>
<p>You said people who use it, I apologize,</p>
<p>maybe you could tell us again,</p>
<p>people who use it four to seven times per week have?</p>
<p>They have a greater than 60% reduction in dementia risk</p>
<p>and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease risk compared to people</p>
<p>that use it only one time a week.</p>
<p>People that use it two to three times a week</p>
<p>have something like a little greater</p>
<p>than 20% reduction in risk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dose dependent effect on dementia risk</p>
<p>and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease risk.</p>
<p>It also has a profound, like there&rsquo;s a big link</p>
<p>between the cardiovascular system and the brain.</p>
<p>Obviously blood flow, a big one, right?</p>
<p>You know, like you need to get blood to your brain.</p>
<p>But cardiovascular mortality,</p>
<p>so mortality from cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>or actually this was men.</p>
<p>If men use the sauna four to seven times a week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a 50% reduction in cardiovascular related mortality</p>
<p>compared to one time a week.</p>
<p>Again, dose dependent manner two to three times a week</p>
<p>is something like 24% lower</p>
<p>death from cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also lower, you know, sudden cardiac death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a heart attack.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like 60 something, greater than 60% lower</p>
<p>if men use it four to seven times a week versus once.</p>
<p>Again, a dose dependent thing.</p>
<p>And the thing that&rsquo;s so profound there also to me</p>
<p>when again, looking at the methods,</p>
<p>when I look at the data,</p>
<p>and this is all work from Dr. Jari Laukkanen.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the University of Eastern Finland</p>
<p>and just one of the world experts on sauna use,</p>
<p>especially with respect to cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>What some of his data has also shown is that</p>
<p>if you look at the duration, the time spent in the sauna,</p>
<p>so a lot of the, so I mentioned the temperature I do</p>
<p>is about, I do like 189 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Typically I go in there, I&rsquo;m pretty heat adapted.</p>
<p>And so the more you do, the more you do the sauna</p>
<p>or any sort of heat stress,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a hot tub or jacuzzi, you become adapted.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically start to sweat</p>
<p>at a lower core body temperature to cool yourself down.</p>
<p>All these sort of physiological changes</p>
<p>start to happen earlier.</p>
<p>And so I stay in for like 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, so I stayed in a long time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>You have to listen to your body.</p>
<p>Most of the studies that I just talked about</p>
<p>were from the duration, the time spent in the sauna.</p>
<p>When I said 50% reduction</p>
<p>in cardiovascular disease related death,</p>
<p>what was shown was that men that were in the sauna</p>
<p>for only 11 minutes,</p>
<p>even if they used it four to seven times a week,</p>
<p>that reduction was only like 8% instead of 50.</p>
<p>It had to be greater than 19 minutes.</p>
<p>So like 20 minutes is the sweet spot</p>
<p>at about 174 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And so, and most of the saunas in Finland, by the way,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re humid.</p>
<p>So they put hot water, not hot,</p>
<p>they put water on hot rocks to create steam.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s usually between 10 to 20% humidity</p>
<p>in the Finnish sauna.</p>
<p>So those studies were, I would say most of the time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find that their humidity is also elevated.</p>
<p>But to me, the dose dependent nature of it</p>
<p>and the duration knowing, like, you know,</p>
<p>to me, that&rsquo;s a very strong data</p>
<p>that this is more causal than some corollary thing,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s always the problem</p>
<p>with observational studies, including these,</p>
<p>which they corrected for a whole host of factors</p>
<p>like cholesterol, you know, exercise, just everything,</p>
<p>everything under the sun.</p>
<p>I mean, they corrected for those.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>you have the dose dependent nature of the duration,</p>
<p>the time spent in the sauna and the frequency.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s like something&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>Plus there&rsquo;s been studies, intervention studies,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, you know, comparing directly head to head,</p>
<p>moderate intensity aerobic exercise on a stationary cycle</p>
<p>to 20 minutes in a sauna.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re physiologically the same things happen.</p>
<p>So heart rate elevates while you&rsquo;re doing the activity.</p>
<p>Blood pressure increases while you&rsquo;re doing the activity.</p>
<p>But then after heart rate decreases,</p>
<p>resting heart rate decreases below baseline,</p>
<p>blood pressure is improved.</p>
<p>So it decreases below baseline.</p>
<p>This is happening the same</p>
<p>in moderate intensity cycling versus sauna.</p>
<p>So again, the sauna, like this heat stress,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about it that really mimics</p>
<p>this moderate intensity aerobic exercise,</p>
<p>which is really great for people that can&rsquo;t go for a run,</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t even get on a bike.</p>
<p>So, you know, disabled people,</p>
<p>granted there are some safety concerns,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty mild, but they do exist.</p>
<p>You know, so people that had a recent heart attack</p>
<p>or have some rare kind of heart disease or problem,</p>
<p>drinking alcohol, never do that.</p>
<p>Elderly people, prone to low blood pressure,</p>
<p>always talk to a physician before doing the sauna.</p>
<p>It is stressful.</p>
<p>Pregnant.</p>
<p>Pregnant women.</p>
<p>I definitely avoided saunas when I was pregnant.</p>
<p>But it is, I think it&rsquo;s very relevant for disabled people</p>
<p>and also people like that are sedentary,</p>
<p>have been sedentary most of their life.</p>
<p>Like my mother, I&rsquo;ve been able to get her in the sauna</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s not, I mean,</p>
<p>I did get her on the Peloton once,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really much easier.</p>
<p>She feels like it&rsquo;s a spa treatment</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like she can listen to her music in there.</p>
<p>And like, I care about her health,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s mostly been a sedentary person.</p>
<p>And so I find it much easier to convince her</p>
<p>to get in the sauna than to get on Peloton.</p>
<p>Ideally, you do both.</p>
<p>The question would be, well, I exercise, I run,</p>
<p>I do my high intensity interval training.</p>
<p>Why do I need to get in the sauna?</p>
<p>And the reality is, and so I published all this</p>
<p>in a review in the experimental gerontology last year,</p>
<p>I guess, late last year.</p>
<p>And basically cardio respiratory fitness,</p>
<p>which is a marker of, it&rsquo;s a marker of health.</p>
<p>Cardio respiratory fitness is improved</p>
<p>in people that do exercise and sauna</p>
<p>compared to exercise alone or sauna alone.</p>
<p>So for those healthy fit people out there</p>
<p>already exercising, there&rsquo;s a synergistic effect</p>
<p>by also adding a sauna into that routine.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many beneficial things happening</p>
<p>with the heat stress.</p>
<p>In addition to like mimicking aerobic exercise,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the heat shock proteins</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And those, it kind of brings me back</p>
<p>to my early days of science when I was at the Salk Institute</p>
<p>for Biological Studies doing research</p>
<p>on little nematode worms that we or someone else</p>
<p>injected amyloid beta 42, the peptide,</p>
<p>the 42 amino acid peptide that is involved</p>
<p>in amyloid plaques found in the brain</p>
<p>correlated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>and other brain disorders.</p>
<p>We injected those into the muscle tissue of worms.</p>
<p>And basically these worms become paralyzed with age</p>
<p>because the aggregated proteins, these proteins aggregate.</p>
<p>Well, heat shock proteins, one of the main things they do</p>
<p>is they basically make sure the proteins</p>
<p>inside of your cells maintain their proper</p>
<p>three-dimensional structure and are folded right.</p>
<p>And so they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re not prone to aggregating</p>
<p>and forming these plaques in your arteries</p>
<p>and also in the brain.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, back to my worm studies I was doing,</p>
<p>I would elevate heat shock proteins in those worms</p>
<p>and it would totally correct the problem</p>
<p>where they would no longer become paralyzed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d move around like they were young.</p>
<p>So many animal studies have been done</p>
<p>looking at Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>a human-like Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in a rodent</p>
<p>and heat shock proteins protecting from it.</p>
<p>So heat shock proteins are robustly activated in humans.</p>
<p>This has been shown to even 50% higher over baseline levels</p>
<p>after just 30 minutes at 163 degrees Fahrenheit in a sauna.</p>
<p>So, and they stay activated at least in rodents</p>
<p>for 48 hours at least.</p>
<p>So having these heat shock proteins around,</p>
<p>making sure they&rsquo;re properly taking care of our proteins</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not aggregating in our brains</p>
<p>and in our plaques could be another potential way</p>
<p>that sauna is protecting from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>and other cardiovascular health as well as longevity.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s people that have SNPs</p>
<p>in heat shock protein factor 70</p>
<p>that if they have one of them,</p>
<p>so they got one from their parents</p>
<p>where they have more active heat shock protein 70,</p>
<p>they live on average one year longer</p>
<p>than people that don&rsquo;t have that SNP.</p>
<p>And if they have two versions,</p>
<p>they got one from their mom and one from their dad,</p>
<p>they live on average two years longer</p>
<p>than people that don&rsquo;t have that SNP.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also been associated with human longevity</p>
<p>as well as in lower organisms.</p>
<p>So you can heat shock a worm or a fly</p>
<p>and they live 15% longer.</p>
<p>This is just worked on by Gordon Lithgow</p>
<p>at the Buck Institute years and years ago.</p>
<p>So anyways, I guess what I was getting at</p>
<p>was the heat shock proteins</p>
<p>are part of that stress response pathway</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also activated by cold as well.</p>
<p>Cold shock does activate heat shock proteins,</p>
<p>not as robust.</p>
<p>Sulfurafane activates them.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>I think we should get all of these things</p>
<p>because they are more robust inputs.</p>
<p>Their input activating mechanisms</p>
<p>are more robust for different ones.</p>
<p>So there is crosstalk.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;d be more accurate to say there&rsquo;s overlap.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also like you wanna get the most robust</p>
<p>from all of them, right?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>So I mean, that&rsquo;s why I wanna do the sauna and exercise</p>
<p>and eat my broccoli sprouts and all that stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>A couple of questions came up for me.</p>
<p>One is, you mentioned these SNPs,</p>
<p>these nucleotide repeats,</p>
<p>basically genes that some people have more of</p>
<p>or less of than others</p>
<p>that can predict longevity in some sense.</p>
<p>Is that the FOXO3 pathway?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one that can.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, FOXO3 is,</p>
<p>in fact, if you go back to the worm studies</p>
<p>I was talking about,</p>
<p>that was like one of the first things</p>
<p>when you see it with your own eyes,</p>
<p>you can take these worms</p>
<p>that you basically decrease their insulin signaling pathway</p>
<p>and their IGF-1.</p>
<p>Worms have what are called homologous genes.</p>
<p>So they have a lot of similarities to humans.</p>
<p>They have an insulin-like receptor.</p>
<p>They have an IGF-1-like receptor</p>
<p>and they make something like FOXO3, which we have.</p>
<p>And basically, if you decrease</p>
<p>that insulin signaling pathway,</p>
<p>their FOXO3 is always active in those worms.</p>
<p>And they live like 100% longer.</p>
<p>And not only do they live longer,</p>
<p>I mean, they are like a very young worm.</p>
<p>I mean, they are like,</p>
<p>you look at this thing and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>this looks like the worm that was just born like hours ago.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>This thing&rsquo;s at the end of its life.</p>
<p>Now, as a side note,</p>
<p>the thing that always got me on this was,</p>
<p>by the way, this was discovered by Cynthia Kenyon.</p>
<p>And this was like back in the 90s.</p>
<p>And honestly, I&rsquo;m not sure that anything has been</p>
<p>as exciting in the worm world since then.</p>
<p>But I thought, I mean, it was a really big finding.</p>
<p>The only caveat there is that the worms go</p>
<p>through this dour, it&rsquo;s called a dour stage</p>
<p>when this happens,</p>
<p>when you decrease their insulin signaling and stuff.</p>
<p>And they like go into this like metabolic stasis.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not eating as much or moving.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, okay, well, they live 100% longer,</p>
<p>but like they go into this weird state.</p>
<p>I know people like this, some in the longevity community.</p>
<p>I know who they are,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll get the last laugh because I&rsquo;ll be dead,</p>
<p>well-fed, but dead, and they&rsquo;ll still be going.</p>
<p>So in terms of the many data on sauna,</p>
<p>and I also just want to acknowledge these Finnish groups</p>
<p>that did this work, it&rsquo;s really pioneering, right?</p>
<p>When you think 20 years ago,</p>
<p>long before social media or any of this,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re out there, up there, I should say,</p>
<p>measuring cortisol and growth hormone and all this stuff</p>
<p>in people getting in and out of sauna,</p>
<p>very, very interesting.</p>
<p>So 20 minutes seems like the threshold</p>
<p>at 170 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>More times per week seems to be better than fewer</p>
<p>when in terms of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk,</p>
<p>according to what I just learned from you.</p>
<p>Four would be a good, I think, minimum effective dose.</p>
<p>Four times a week.</p>
<p>And you combine it with the cold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen a protocol where,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very extreme protocol.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend this to people right off the bat,</p>
<p>where they had human subjects get into the sauna</p>
<p>for 30 minutes, get out for five,</p>
<p>30 minutes, get out for five,</p>
<p>30 minutes for a total of two hours of exposure.</p>
<p>But that was what led to these massive</p>
<p>16-fold increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>I actually have a, and they had to do it very seldom.</p>
<p>So it sounds like these protocols you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>20 minutes done four times per week,</p>
<p>far more reasonable for most people to access.</p>
<p>But I know people are probably desperate to know</p>
<p>what if they don&rsquo;t have a sauna?</p>
<p>A sauna is kind of a unique item.</p>
<p>So I have a couple of questions.</p>
<p>Can people use hot baths?</p>
<p>With the appropriate warning, of course,</p>
<p>that without getting into a description</p>
<p>of the mechanics and the underlying biology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that the testes,</p>
<p>if they get too warm, you&rsquo;ll kill sperm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason why the testes are housed</p>
<p>in a structure called the scrotum that can move around.</p>
<p>So just to be, we are biologists</p>
<p>just talking about realities here.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to conceive children</p>
<p>or keep your sperm healthy,</p>
<p>guys should probably stay out of warm, hot baths.</p>
<p>For at least six months, that&rsquo;s been shown.</p>
<p>Six months.</p>
<p>So sperm motility goes down and sperm production goes down,</p>
<p>but that is completely corrected</p>
<p>if they stay out of the sauna for six months.</p>
<p>So three, six months later, it&rsquo;s back to normal.</p>
<p>Great, that&rsquo;s very useful information,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, to a number of people out there.</p>
<p>So if people don&rsquo;t have access to a sauna,</p>
<p>and we get this about cold too,</p>
<p>you always say, what about cold showers?</p>
<p>And I always say, well, the studies have mainly been done</p>
<p>on immersion because it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to keep things controlled in cold showers.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make for a very good experiment</p>
<p>because you get a bigger person,</p>
<p>less of them is under the shower.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t make for a good experiment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as good as immersion.</p>
<p>But with heat, I could imagine</p>
<p>that a hot bath would work almost as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s been some studies looking at,</p>
<p>for example, activation of heat shock proteins,</p>
<p>but also brain-derived neurotrophic factor increases</p>
<p>with heat stress.</p>
<p>And so the hot bath at around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>which is typically what studies will use for temperature,</p>
<p>which is actually cooler than when I crank my bath hot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hot.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re very heat adapted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very heat adapted, yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s 20 minutes from the shoulders down.</p>
<p>And that is like a very robust activation</p>
<p>in heat shock proteins</p>
<p>and in brain-derived neurotrophic factor.</p>
<p>And then heat shock proteins are also protecting</p>
<p>against muscle atrophy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also having to do with the protein structure</p>
<p>and the muscle tissue as well.</p>
<p>And this has been studies in animal data</p>
<p>as well as some recent human data as well.</p>
<p>It was local hyperthermia or local heat treatment,</p>
<p>but essentially it showed that it protected.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like,</p>
<p>there was a study where they were looking at muscle disuse</p>
<p>and it was something like the local heat treatment</p>
<p>prevented like almost 40% of the muscle atrophy</p>
<p>from disuse.</p>
<p>So like, and it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because I used to use this sauna</p>
<p>when I was injured and stuff.</p>
<p>I would go in the sauna,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t know at the time</p>
<p>because I was a graduate student,</p>
<p>but I knew like just from experiments</p>
<p>that like, you know, like I&rsquo;m not losing as much muscle.</p>
<p>I feel better.</p>
<p>Like I, you know, like at the time</p>
<p>I was reading a lot about the growth hormone</p>
<p>and stuff back then.</p>
<p>But, and I knew about heat shock proteins.</p>
<p>And so I kind of knew,</p>
<p>but that data wasn&rsquo;t around yet.</p>
<p>And so now we have the data</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always like felt like I wasn&rsquo;t losing my muscle</p>
<p>like I should have been when I was doing the sauna.</p>
<p>I was doing it literally seven days a week.</p>
<p>It was like hardcore.</p>
<p>This is also during graduate school.</p>
<p>Yeah, now I&rsquo;m doing the sauna,</p>
<p>like a bare minimum, I do three,</p>
<p>but I try to do four because of the,</p>
<p>it all depends on my schedule.</p>
<p>I also like to do long runs.</p>
<p>I really, it&rsquo;s like long being like three miles,</p>
<p>not like Cam Haines, that&rsquo;s too long.</p>
<p>But I really, for me,</p>
<p>and we were talking about this earlier,</p>
<p>like off camera that the runs for me</p>
<p>are for my brain and I get this mind wandering effect</p>
<p>where I daydream and I think about things.</p>
<p>I work through problems.</p>
<p>I get creative.</p>
<p>I come up with ideas</p>
<p>and this is all happening on the runs.</p>
<p>And so I just, I miss my runs if I don&rsquo;t do them.</p>
<p>And I miss it because of the brain effects I get from it.</p>
<p>And when I exercise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny because I&rsquo;m a female</p>
<p>and you think that I&rsquo;d be exercising,</p>
<p>you know, to stay fit and in shape</p>
<p>and care about my figure.</p>
<p>But when I exercise,</p>
<p>literally what I&rsquo;m thinking about is my brain.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, this is the best longevity drug there is.</p>
<p>This is it right here, Rhonda.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re always wondering,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always wanting to know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wanting to do the best.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing that essential dose.</p>
<p>And so that for me is the motivation,</p>
<p>the doping seeking thing I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I do not do enough strength training</p>
<p>and I have to do it.</p>
<p>I have to, I have to, I have to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so after the endurance and the hit.</p>
<p>And I really need to add that in</p>
<p>because muscle mass is also extremely important</p>
<p>for aging as well, you know?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my fault.</p>
<p>Well, the brain effects are really interesting.</p>
<p>I also run, I try and get one longer run per week</p>
<p>and a few other runs and I do it without a phone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to podcasts.</p>
<p>I occasionally will listen to music,</p>
<p>but I really try not to.</p>
<p>I also find that my mind solves problems.</p>
<p>I feel like it washes out the cobwebs, so to speak.</p>
<p>Some of the most brilliant and prolific neuroscientists</p>
<p>that I know who&rsquo;ve had very long careers,</p>
<p>Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize winner at Columbia,</p>
<p>comes to mind for all his work on memory.</p>
<p>Used to swim a mile a day</p>
<p>and now I think swims half a mile a day,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s in his late nineties and he&rsquo;s still sharp,</p>
<p>which is incredible.</p>
<p>And his lab has done some work showing</p>
<p>that any load bearing exercise repeated,</p>
<p>so endurance work, unlike the peloton or cycling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really load bearing,</p>
<p>although you&rsquo;re cycling really hard with the resistance,</p>
<p>but causes the release of osteocalcin from the bones,</p>
<p>which acts in an endocrine way,</p>
<p>sort of like a hormone,</p>
<p>can actually travel to the hippocampus</p>
<p>and at least in these animal studies,</p>
<p>induce the proliferation of neurons,</p>
<p>growth of synapses, BDNF, a number of downstream things,</p>
<p>which kind of makes sense</p>
<p>if we were to put a just so evolutionary story on this.</p>
<p>A body that&rsquo;s active can signal to the brain</p>
<p>that the body still needs cognition.</p>
<p>An inactive body in some ways</p>
<p>is depriving the brain of any signal</p>
<p>about what the body is doing, right?</p>
<p>This is obviously, I&rsquo;m making this up as conjecture,</p>
<p>but we know in various ocean animals</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll swim around for some period of their life</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>a completely stationary portion of their life.</p>
<p>And basically the brain degenerates.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need much of a nervous system</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not moving.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s really something there</p>
<p>and then also just letting your ideas in mind drift.</p>
<p>I love that you,</p>
<p>and I appreciate that you shared your protocols</p>
<p>because I think right now we&rsquo;re in an interesting time</p>
<p>in public health information history</p>
<p>where people are just kind of getting bombarded</p>
<p>with cold is good, heat is gold.</p>
<p>Cold is good, heat is good.</p>
<p>Excuse me, I misspoke.</p>
<p>There are all these micronutrients</p>
<p>and of course macronutrients are important too.</p>
<p>And today you&rsquo;ve really enriched us</p>
<p>with the description of the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>and the logic behind them.</p>
<p>But also sharing what you do is really informative</p>
<p>because I think people need a jumping off place.</p>
<p>And obviously they need to start someplace</p>
<p>and getting heat adapted, et cetera, it takes time.</p>
<p>But I really appreciate</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re willing to share your protocols</p>
<p>and that you do the things that you teach</p>
<p>and educate people about.</p>
<p>As a final question,</p>
<p>because I have to ask red light sauna or no red light sauna?</p>
<p>Or no red light sauna?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a little bit vocal about my feelings</p>
<p>that none of the red light saunas I&rsquo;ve ever been in</p>
<p>got hot enough and it was frustrating.</p>
<p>So I feel like it&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>However, I do acknowledge that red light</p>
<p>and low level light therapies are now known</p>
<p>to do a number of interesting things.</p>
<p>It was a Nobel prize in 1908 for phototherapy for lupus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like a new thing,</p>
<p>the idea that red light and light could do things positive</p>
<p>for our biology.</p>
<p>But do you have a red light in your sauna?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s useful?</p>
<p>And I mentioned this because this is the number one question</p>
<p>I get about sauna, red light or no red light</p>
<p>or some intermediate answer.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have an infrared sauna,</p>
<p>but I do have like, I have a sauna that has lights,</p>
<p>it makes red light,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the red light that you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about, it&rsquo;s not activating it at a specific wavelength,</p>
<p>which is-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually so that the range that seems to be helpful.</p>
<p>And I have, I confess,</p>
<p>I use a red light panel for other things.</p>
<p>Is 670 nanometer out to about 720 nanometer.</p>
<p>So it looks like red and very dim lights,</p>
<p>dim red and bright red.</p>
<p>And the idea is that red light can travel the photon</p>
<p>and energy as such that it can travel down</p>
<p>through the deep layers of the dermis of the skin.</p>
<p>I, you know, I don&rsquo;t have a red light in my sauna.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s essential or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so based on all the studies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>I think that would be, is, you know,</p>
<p>the potential effect on mitochondria is interesting.</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a lack of really good solid evidence</p>
<p>in, you know, humans,</p>
<p>but that might only be because it&rsquo;s just not studied enough.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s usually the case.</p>
<p>So perhaps, you know, like there&rsquo;s the Juve, right?</p>
<p>The Juve, they have those pant red light panels.</p>
<p>Juve and Cozy are the two ones I know, K-O-Z-E and Juve.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there, as far as I know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably gonna insult both companies at the same time,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d rather insult them both at the same time</p>
<p>than just compliment one or insult one.</p>
<p>Both of them seem excellent</p>
<p>for getting the appropriate wavelengths of red light.</p>
<p>And I do not have a relationship to either of those.</p>
<p>Well, I personally think that the sauna in and of itself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the heat stress.</p>
<p>And typically the question I get is infrared sauna</p>
<p>or regular sauna.</p>
<p>And there are some differences as well.</p>
<p>Infrared saunas, maybe the infrared saunas</p>
<p>are the ones that have the red light</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Infrared saunas only get up to around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned,</p>
<p>the studies were about 174 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>And so you really have to stay in a longer period of time.</p>
<p>However, there have been some studies coming out of Japan.</p>
<p>They use infrared sauna.</p>
<p>They have this whole protocol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called weigh-on therapy.</p>
<p>And they get people in infrared saunas</p>
<p>and then they wrap them in a towel</p>
<p>and like they stay warm for X amount.</p>
<p>The whole protocol ends up being like an hour long.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s 140 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an infrared sauna.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been shown to improve a variety</p>
<p>of like coronary heart disease and conditions,</p>
<p>heart related conditions.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;ve been some improvements.</p>
<p>So obviously there&rsquo;s evidence that infrared saunas</p>
<p>can be beneficial for cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used infrared saunas many times at my in-laws.</p>
<p>They have an infrared sauna.</p>
<p>And I have to crank that thing up for a while</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s maxed.</p>
<p>And then I have to sit in there for an hour at least.</p>
<p>I do sweat a lot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing we didn&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>You do sweat some heavy metals.</p>
<p>And some heavy metals are excreted predominantly</p>
<p>through sweat and others through urine.</p>
<p>So for example, cadmium,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like 125 fold increase in cadmium excretion</p>
<p>from sweat when you get in the sauna.</p>
<p>Also lead is something like 17 fold excretions higher.</p>
<p>Another one is aluminum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about four fold higher.</p>
<p>Infrared, you do sweat a lot too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the main difference</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re heating your body up</p>
<p>through thermal radiation versus the ambient air.</p>
<p>But like a standard sauna is a heater</p>
<p>and the heater is heating up the air</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re heating yourself up.</p>
<p>So it is a little bit of a different mechanism.</p>
<p>I prefer regular saunas.</p>
<p>Most of the data out there is from the heat stress itself.</p>
<p>Like your heart rate&rsquo;s elevating when you&rsquo;re in there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling hot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting that cardiovascular.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the hot sauna.</p>
<p>And that for me takes a really long time</p>
<p>in the infrared sauna.</p>
<p>I get at the very end.</p>
<p>But I do think there are some benefits from infrared</p>
<p>and they are more affordable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re less of a fire hazard.</p>
<p>But again, hot baths are, I think,</p>
<p>a good alternative modality for heat stress</p>
<p>compared to like a regular sauna.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really helpful answer.</p>
<p>Like I said, I use the red light, but not in the sauna.</p>
<p>And thank you for reminding us</p>
<p>of that 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold</p>
<p>that was mainly used in all these studies.</p>
<p>So we covered a lot of territory,</p>
<p>but I just want to thank you again.</p>
<p>It was extremely thorough and extremely informative.</p>
<p>I now have, my notes always look a little bit</p>
<p>like they were drawn out by a macaque monkey</p>
<p>who has no knowledge of the English language,</p>
<p>but I can decipher this to tell you</p>
<p>that there are at least 10 additions</p>
<p>to my current protocols that I&rsquo;m going to add.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll have lots of questions.</p>
<p>So I apologize in advance for that.</p>
