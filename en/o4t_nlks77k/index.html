<p>once you supply what&rsquo;s missing boy that</p>
<p>weakness goes away within minutes wow</p>
<p>hopeful words okay let&rsquo;s shoot over to</p>
<p>our friends on social media in this case</p>
<p>YouTube Jay wants to know what are your</p>
<p>thoughts on using inversion tables</p>
<p>like them for the lower back and</p>
<p>especially if you have disc issues</p>
<p>um but I will say this when you go down</p>
<p>backwards upside down boy you have to do</p>
<p>it gradually because all the blood</p>
<p>rushes to your brain and you&rsquo;ll feel a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of pressure in your</p>
<p>brain you get lightheaded you could even</p>
<p>pass out so what I suggest is you adapt</p>
<p>slowly because you have the adrenal</p>
<p>glands that are supposed to be helping</p>
<p>you balance this blood pressure out with</p>
<p>the positional changes so um</p>
<p>I remember when I did I was like Wow</p>
<p>bring me back up because I I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>pass out so I would start like on your</p>
<p>back and then slightly kind of angled</p>
<p>for a while and then slowly kind of go</p>
<p>upside down but it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>the back</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so yeah that&rsquo;s one way to do a little</p>
<p>Traction in your lower back okay the</p>
<p>other thing that I would recommend</p>
<p>though if you have back problems is get</p>
<p>one of those cushions uh low back</p>
<p>cushions maybe even like a foam roller</p>
<p>and push it underneath the lower back</p>
<p>because that is</p>
<p>going to give you probably the most</p>
<p>benefit to keep that curve in the low</p>
<p>back if you have low back pain all right</p>
<p>especially in the car</p>
<p>yeah absolutely okay Ace from YouTube</p>
<p>thank you Dr Berg for your vast</p>
<p>knowledge and positive impact on our</p>
<p>lives and thank you Ace for that comment</p>
<p>I know many of us feel it</p>
<p>I am markedly now hold on drum roll</p>
<p>please thinner not that that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>objective here but a lot thinner than I</p>
<p>used to be before I met Dr Berg I could</p>
<p>barely squeeze through the frame in his</p>
<p>door when he first met me and look at me</p>
<p>go so anyway thank you for that doctor</p>
<p>yeah you send me a picture of uh you uh</p>
<p>in the gym or something I was like wow</p>
<p>if you really have come along long way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great and I think even your your</p>
<p>feet pain that you had when you ran I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s gone as well everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone plantar fasciitis this less weight</p>
<p>knees back have a ruptured L4 L5 no</p>
<p>numbness it&rsquo;s just wild wow that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>Steve that&rsquo;s awesome yeah and no</p>
<p>dripping IVs or scalpels or any of that</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s even better yeah I like that</p>
<p>all right back to social media again</p>
<p>read from YouTube I just finished a</p>
<p>round of antibiotics now I am bloating</p>
<p>every time I eat or drink anything what</p>
<p>can I do to fix this yes well anytime</p>
<p>you take an antibiotic it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>important to at the same time take a</p>
<p>probiotic to handle this because you</p>
<p>just killed off a lot of your bacteria</p>
<p>but not all of your bacteria and a</p>
<p>certain</p>
<p>portion of those are now probably now</p>
<p>more resistant than antibiotic and they</p>
<p>become they can switch over if you piss</p>
<p>them off to more pathogenic bacteria and</p>
<p>then create more issues with digestion</p>
<p>so you want to replace it you need to</p>
<p>take a probiotic a good one and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>biased of my own probiotics which that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a sarcasm but I do have a liquid and a</p>
<p>regular one that I would recommend but</p>
<p>you take the probiotic I like to take</p>
<p>them before I go to sleep</p>
<p>start with a little bit and then maybe</p>
<p>take two eventually but one should be</p>
<p>enough before bed and you want to slowly</p>
<p>start building up the friendly bacteria</p>
<p>in your gut</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um you end up with a</p>
<p>this imbalance of um</p>
<p>fungus to bacteria because the when you</p>
<p>take an antibiotic you kill bacteria not</p>
<p>fungus or Yeast</p>
<p>and so you allow the yeast to get more</p>
<p>populated like the candida is a type of</p>
<p>yeast and now you have this growth of</p>
<p>candida which can create</p>
<p>a white tongue</p>
<p>and a lot of other issues which um I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done videos on but yeah the probiotics</p>
<p>is what what you need to to reverse this</p>
<p>wonderful at all times gross so get on</p>
<p>those Dr Bergs or otherwise and in one</p>
<p>one last little quick thing about when</p>
<p>you take a when you take an antibiotic</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take the probiotic right at the</p>
<p>same time like even if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>kefir or sauerkraut</p>
<p>stagger it so you&rsquo;re not taking at the</p>
<p>exact same time because it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like if you do take the probiotic with</p>
<p>the antibiotic they neutral each other</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>interesting nobody wins that way</p>
<p>okay so the audience many of them may</p>
<p>know what a green room is</p>
<p>um that is like a a new station a little</p>
<p>room you wait in uh where they put on</p>
<p>some makeup before they call you on the</p>
<p>air and get you ready and we have a</p>
<p>green room and if you want to know the</p>
<p>sort of arbitrary way I choose which</p>
<p>guest comes on first the first one is</p>
<p>Jan and she&rsquo;s wearing green so I thought</p>
<p>why not put her up first gen if you</p>
<p>would unmute yourself you were on with</p>
<p>Dr Berg welcome to the show</p>
<p>thank you hi Dr Berg my question my</p>
<p>question is what recommendation would</p>
<p>you give to lower higher platelet count</p>
<p>now the condition is called essential</p>
<p>thrombosis</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve searched videos uh your videos we</p>
<p>all do you have any recommendation Whole</p>
<p>Foods or supplements so far the only</p>
<p>thing on the internet is hydroxuria baby</p>
<p>aspirin anything natural</p>
<p>yeah I think one of the complications if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not mistaken is more of a tendency</p>
<p>to clot right</p>
<p>when you have these playlists so</p>
<p>um one of the things that uh a really</p>
<p>good remedy is called NATO kinase</p>
<p>NATO kinase that comes from NATO which</p>
<p>is fermented soybeans</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a Japanese I think uh food that</p>
<p>you eat as a condiment it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very it has a NATO kindness</p>
<p>is a very powerful enzyme that can help</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>dissolve plaquing</p>
<p>the arteries but it also kind of keeps</p>
<p>the blood on the thin side so it</p>
<p>counteracts that coagulation especially</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s at risk so it&rsquo;s uh I like</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great one garlic also</p>
<p>thins The Blood also the um</p>
<p>tocatrinos which is a type of vitamin A</p>
<p>thins blood but it&rsquo;ll kindness is a</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like potent potent</p>
<p>stuff so you don&rsquo;t need much</p>
<p>um but I think that&rsquo;s what I would use</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll actually keep</p>
<p>um keep things from clotting with higher</p>
<p>higher amounts of platelets and</p>
<p>fibrinogen is called which is kind of a</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>okay thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>well thank you for that succinct</p>
<p>question and good luck with that get</p>
<p>back or this Jan if you would and let us</p>
<p>know uh you know your continued progress</p>
<p>okay and let&rsquo;s see um we&rsquo;re gonna do two</p>
<p>new things here our first one is answer</p>
<p>the first question of the day which</p>
<p>simply asked if someone feels weaker on</p>
<p>keto what the heck&rsquo;s going on what are</p>
<p>they missing</p>
<p>uh 55 percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s electrolytes 20 say it&rsquo;s magnesium</p>
<p>twenty percent say it&rsquo;s potassium and</p>
<p>the remaining five hold out for sodium</p>
<p>okay the answer is sodium as in sea salt</p>
<p>simple simple solution when you do keto</p>
<p>the demand for sodium does go up because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing a lot of fluids because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing this extra glycogen which</p>
<p>is the sugar that tends to hold the</p>
<p>fluid and if you don&rsquo;t add the salt back</p>
<p>in you&rsquo;re going to notice like wow I</p>
<p>thought this keto is supposed to make me</p>
<p>feel good but you&rsquo;re feeling weaker</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on a high carb diet you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be consuming excess salt because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to retain it as fluid</p>
<p>retention as you see a lot of diabetics</p>
<p>have this their legs are just swollen</p>
<p>pitting edema their feet are puffy the</p>
<p>solution is to go on keto</p>
<p>and uh if you are a diabetic with the</p>
<p>swelling you can take the opposite</p>
<p>mineral called potassium to push the</p>
<p>fluid out too that can help</p>
<p>all right very good hey Doc who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching us this morning or listening to</p>
<p>us</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s some indication a good</p>
<p>morning to all of our viewers joining us</p>
<p>from the UK Canada Mexico Trinidad and</p>
<p>Tobago Poland India Japan Australia</p>
<p>Norway Columbia Germany Germany excuse</p>
<p>me New Zealand Finland Ukraine Taiwan</p>
<p>Ethiopia South Africa Belgium Malaysia</p>
<p>Jordan Pakistan United Arab Emirates</p>
<p>Egypt the Netherlands Algeria Eritrea</p>
<p>Micronesia haven&rsquo;t ever heard from them</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Sweden Nigeria Hong Kong</p>
<p>Ghana Thailand Estonia Peru Portugal</p>
<p>France Spain Bulgaria Jamaica the Czech</p>
<p>Republic Scotland from where my ancestry</p>
<p>is if anyone cares Iran Austria</p>
<p>Kurdistan Romania Somalia the Virgin</p>
<p>Islands Dubai Brunei turkey cashmere</p>
<p>Singapore Chile Malta Kenya Bahrain</p>
<p>Armenia Israel Ireland Tanzania Bermuda</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi Qatar Cameroon and drumroll</p>
<p>all across these United States of</p>
<p>America what an audience there is indeed</p>
<p>and as we say usually there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>stragglers that say hey what about us so</p>
<p>those three or four people or countries</p>
<p>will probably be forthcoming in a few</p>
<p>minutes so thanks so much for that and</p>
<p>audience you five percent you Rascals</p>
<p>you you got it right</p>
<p>so uh the other 95 percent you have a</p>
<p>chance to make up for lost time on the</p>
<p>uh next question and speaking of</p>
<p>questions why don&rsquo;t we just launch that</p>
<p>now and here it is Doc</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>which type of exercise will help you</p>
<p>lose your belly fat</p>
<p>okay what&rsquo;s or basically which type will</p>
<p>most uh will mostly help you lose the</p>
<p>belly fat out of all the exercises which</p>
<p>is the one</p>
<p>that you want to focus on more than</p>
<p>others</p>
<p>all right very good here&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>common problem around the world uh Joan</p>
<p>from Facebook I&rsquo;ve been using castor oil</p>
<p>drops to remove earwax but it only</p>
<p>softens it how can I best</p>
<p>get it out of her ear remove the wax</p>
<p>um you know we&rsquo;re dealing with an</p>
<p>an imbalance somewhere with the glands</p>
<p>that produce this wax and</p>
<p>um honestly I would instead of doing a</p>
<p>remedy I would go to the basic eating</p>
<p>plan the healthy version of the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet right on my website you</p>
<p>can download it start that and I think</p>
<p>that will be the best option</p>
<p>um for something like that I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>guest against using you know Q-tips but</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t obviously jam it into the</p>
<p>inside of your ear just gently use it um</p>
<p>but of course realize that you have also</p>
<p>friendly bacteria in there too so this</p>
<p>excess scrubbing and cleansing and</p>
<p>sterilizing is not a good thing because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to end up red raw and</p>
<p>irritated</p>
<p>so you have to be careful about</p>
<p>what you put in the ear</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all right well please be careful about</p>
<p>that let&rsquo;s see Sharon from Facebook what</p>
<p>could be causing my eyelids to be puffy</p>
<p>when I wake up in the morning I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wondering if there&rsquo;s a little kitty</p>
<p>around there somewhere</p>
<p>yeah it can be an allergy for sure but</p>
<p>most the time that I notice you can</p>
<p>really see insulin resistance which is</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s eating too many carbs or</p>
<p>sugars with the eyelids I mean I could</p>
<p>just see it from across the room it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like this this swollen</p>
<p>eyelid either on the top or below puffy</p>
<p>that is uh the kidney is kind of</p>
<p>congested and also it&rsquo;s just a fluid</p>
<p>retention backing up but that&rsquo;s carbs so</p>
<p>you get rid of the carbs and uh that</p>
<p>clears right up really nicely in fact</p>
<p>another thing that will happen when you</p>
<p>do higher carbs is if you look at the</p>
<p>under edge of your eyelid and lift it up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like on the reddish side and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s irritated</p>
<p>boy that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s blood sugar issues as</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s too many carbs I used to</p>
<p>have that it feels like it felt like</p>
<p>sand underneath my eyelids and that ear</p>
<p>dries out the eye</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>just another tip for those people who</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>problems with the eyelids</p>
<p>interesting okay now I&rsquo;m rooting for</p>
<p>Veronica because she&rsquo;s working hard</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s from YouTube I&rsquo;m an Ardent</p>
<p>listener of yours but I can&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>get my blood pressure and blood sugars</p>
<p>down I take long walks regularly and</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;m on keto sometimes on keto</p>
<p>diet I really don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>at this point sometimes she says</p>
<p>you got two things with that um</p>
<p>when the arteries become stiffened and</p>
<p>not flexible the blood pressure goes up</p>
<p>and so chances are you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance because your carb to do keto</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not something that you can</p>
<p>sort of do it takes consistency to</p>
<p>really make the change</p>
<p>um over a good amount of time because</p>
<p>you want to get your body</p>
<p>um in a state of ketosis</p>
<p>for a period of one to three months to</p>
<p>really see the change</p>
<p>um people who sort of do keto or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it consistently through the week</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t see the benefit and that</p>
<p>is because of this one little piece of</p>
<p>information all it takes is a little bit</p>
<p>of carbs to kind of knock you out of</p>
<p>ketosis for a long period of time like</p>
<p>sometimes at 48 hours</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re new at this and</p>
<p>your body hasn&rsquo;t converted to keto so</p>
<p>it just takes a period of you know</p>
<p>48 hours two or even three days to get</p>
<p>into keto so and here you are a piece of</p>
<p>bread or a glass of wine</p>
<p>and then you wonder why you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>knocked out of ketosis not for a minute</p>
<p>but for you know some days it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>it I know it&rsquo;s terrible but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to know because</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s say every third day you do</p>
<p>carbs or a little carb</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to see change</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of uh you have to be more</p>
<p>consistent</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>no dear</p>
<p>well anyway you opened up the um</p>
<p>opportunity for me and again I was</p>
<p>bloated and</p>
<p>um unhealthy and so on</p>
<p>is always on me about that absolutely</p>
<p>and but anyway so I&rsquo;m so excited and</p>
<p>proud to have met him I mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>changed my life I&rsquo;m 69 now and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>better shaped than when I was 35 uh and</p>
<p>that is I still got a way to go I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>and just you know I&rsquo;m intermittent</p>
<p>fasting&rsquo;s changed my life I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>perfect keto guy though I&rsquo;ll admit that</p>
<p>but if you take some chunks of this as</p>
<p>much as you can it all adds up to a</p>
<p>better quality of life and I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>grateful for that Dr Berg and also</p>
<p>grateful to gloat and have my 15 seconds</p>
<p>of Fame which is now over</p>
<p>uh and it&rsquo;s time to get back to the show</p>
<p>at hand so Miriam from YouTube help I</p>
<p>can how can I lose my belly fat uh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thin except for my belly looks like an</p>
<p>olive with a toothpick through it I</p>
<p>guess what should I be doing</p>
<p>one of the questions that we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>bringing up I think is it was it the</p>
<p>last question right I think well let me</p>
<p>answer that question with after we see</p>
<p>the response of this last question right</p>
<p>because I was talking about exercise</p>
<p>yeah lose your belly fat you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>all right will you hang on there Miriam</p>
<p>because you can both answer the question</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um you know uh also find out your answer</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know the answers which you</p>
<p>obviously don&rsquo;t or you wouldn&rsquo;t ask the</p>
<p>question boy that was dumb of me Sashi</p>
<p>from Facebook should someone who takes</p>
<p>immunosuppressants twice a day be doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>uh yes because that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>strengthen your immune system it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>essential the other thing you want to</p>
<p>take is colostrum because colostrum</p>
<p>helps</p>
<p>people that have immuno compensation or</p>
<p>immuno suppression</p>
<p>immune system has been suppressed</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re on medications whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s organ</p>
<p>um rejection medication or whatever but</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really uh</p>
<p>bad situation where</p>
<p>you know little things can affect you so</p>
<p>I would be taking vitamin D I would be</p>
<p>doing low carb I would be doing fasting</p>
<p>not just intermittent I would do</p>
<p>prolonged fasting too and I think that</p>
<p>will help you with that colostrum you</p>
<p>can get that trying to find a colostrum</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh either goat or sheep colostrum</p>
<p>versus cow I just I just found people</p>
<p>have less reactions with that and they</p>
<p>do better but start off with a very</p>
<p>small bit and you know just add more of</p>
<p>the time because</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want that to create an immune</p>
<p>reaction especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>potentially allergic to casein which is</p>
<p>the milk protein interesting okay</p>
<p>Alberto from YouTube does eating animal</p>
<p>protein increase our risk for cancer he</p>
<p>wants to know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>no no it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely not been proven at all</p>
<p>in fact uh it a lot depends on also the</p>
<p>source</p>
<p>of of meat that you eat</p>
<p>um is it grass-fed</p>
<p>I mean like what in meat causes cancer</p>
<p>um I I mean I can imagine if you eat a</p>
<p>highly processed meat and you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>a lot of um you&rsquo;re eating you know</p>
<p>protein that is from an animal that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sick that&rsquo;s going to lower your immune</p>
<p>system but meat by itself</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve heard some rumors or I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen something that so yeah meat has</p>
<p>been now found to be um</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>carcinogenic uh substance</p>
<p>well I love to read the research on that</p>
<p>like what type of meat did they use was</p>
<p>it just meat how did they isolate that</p>
<p>being a factor is this an observational</p>
<p>study which it probably is you can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t determine that oh it&rsquo;s highly</p>
<p>associative well you still can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>determine what what if it&rsquo;s uh did you</p>
<p>rule out smokers did you rule out</p>
<p>drinking did you rule out all these</p>
<p>other things so</p>
<p>now I I didn&rsquo;t drink that Kool-Aid so I</p>
<p>think that would be a no all right very</p>
<p>good well um I tell you what next up we</p>
<p>have Muhammad uh and he&rsquo;s calling in or</p>
<p>coming in from Canada and Muhammad you</p>
<p>have is prepared with this one question</p>
<p>which you will belt out in 30 seconds</p>
<p>and then be enriched by your counsel</p>
<p>afterwards go ahead Muhammad you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>here with Dr bird</p>
<p>hello Dr break uh hello it&rsquo;s great to</p>
<p>finally meet you uh I&rsquo;ve been on like a</p>
<p>big fan and your Ambassador since the</p>
<p>start of 2019. uh I&rsquo;ll just quickly uh</p>
<p>tell my like progress I did keto for</p>
<p>four months when I started in March 2019</p>
<p>and lost 30 kgs</p>
<p>it was great and then I went to for</p>
<p>vacations to Dubai and I said okay now I</p>
<p>know what to do and maybe I&rsquo;ll just to</p>
<p>be on vacation eat Shawarma and pizzas</p>
<p>and everything and I&rsquo;ll go back and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start all over again</p>
<p>because now I know it&rsquo;s easy easy peasy</p>
<p>if you stick to keto and you can lose</p>
<p>weight it&rsquo;s been since then like June</p>
<p>2019 and until date</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on keto since then but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple of weeks on keto and then a few</p>
<p>days on Cheeto</p>
<p>and I have and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s been this and</p>
<p>the people who I used to preach and they</p>
<p>used to follow me that yeah keto is good</p>
<p>now they don&rsquo;t trust me they say what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing with yourself is very</p>
<p>dangerous like and I know it&rsquo;s dangerous</p>
<p>and you would say that stick on keto and</p>
<p>be consistent I know that but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what the after 10 days or 15 days</p>
<p>of following keto there&rsquo;s like a weak</p>
<p>moment</p>
<p>um that I feel down and I I now I know I</p>
<p>realize that maybe I missed sometimes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not regular with bone broth</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;m not regular with</p>
<p>electrolytes</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that weak moment which makes me</p>
<p>do okay there&rsquo;s KFC for the kids or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Shawarma and I love Shawarma so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like okay let&rsquo;s have this and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out of keto for another four days</p>
<p>five days so couple of weeks of Keto</p>
<p>then few days Cheeto then keto Cheeto</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been like four years so now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got an ultimatum from my my best</p>
<p>friend that you have until 31st December</p>
<p>2023</p>
<p>you do your thing and after that if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not working then it&rsquo;s not for you so you</p>
<p>stop doing like keto so and then go back</p>
<p>to Cheeto 100 of the time yeah that</p>
<p>makes sense</p>
<p>yeah I mean I think we all have our uh</p>
<p>weaknesses that uh that kind of come up</p>
<p>and um throw us off</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a couple couple ideas I have for you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would</p>
<p>kind of log this on a on a maybe a like</p>
<p>a piece of paper so you can kind of see</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a pattern of it</p>
<p>um sometimes um if there&rsquo;s a pattern and</p>
<p>you can predict this and let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wow I&rsquo;m I really could go for</p>
<p>some Kentucky Fried Chicken right now</p>
<p>um then you can uh load yourself up with</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>more vitamin B1 I think that would help</p>
<p>a lot or trace minerals</p>
<p>and um and and then maybe uh let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>you do have a um</p>
<p>a cheat day and uh</p>
<p>at that point I think you should make</p>
<p>kind of like a personal</p>
<p>policy with yourself</p>
<p>so you basically now if I go off the</p>
<p>program now I have to fast for 48 hours</p>
<p>and then now you fast for 48 hours and</p>
<p>you exercise at the same time to burn</p>
<p>off that Sugar that&rsquo;s one idea the other</p>
<p>idea I had is to in your house create</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some very similar recipes like keto</p>
<p>desserts or alternative type meals that</p>
<p>resemble those cheat things like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a great recipe for Kentucky Fried</p>
<p>Chicken that is tastes almost identical</p>
<p>and have that in the house as your</p>
<p>substitute so you can get the pleasure</p>
<p>you can get the pleasure of that but</p>
<p>without the actual bad stuff</p>
<p>the other thing too I noticed some</p>
<p>is that a lot of people um</p>
<p>when they when they</p>
<p>um they have a lot of extra time on</p>
<p>their hands so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like really bad like if you at</p>
<p>night especially have really not much to</p>
<p>do and you have a lot of extra time</p>
<p>people were like boy you know you keep</p>
<p>thinking about it and they just they go</p>
<p>off the program so if you just keep</p>
<p>yourself really busy</p>
<p>that will help as well so you don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think about it as much</p>
<p>um honestly it took me</p>
<p>a long time I was like you at one time</p>
<p>it took me many years before I got</p>
<p>really serious</p>
<p>um I would do really well and then I</p>
<p>would go to the grocery store</p>
<p>buy a bunch of celery and vegetables and</p>
<p>of course a big bag of Doritos I had to</p>
<p>have that and that that went on for a</p>
<p>long time until</p>
<p>I physically felt so bad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it I&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>but I will say though too</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t beat yourself up too bad</p>
<p>because I do know that um</p>
<p>you build yourself up by</p>
<p>saying no to it but if you give into it</p>
<p>it becomes and then that leads to more</p>
<p>weakness and then you might think well I</p>
<p>just have weak will that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>so I would just start fresh each time</p>
<p>you do this</p>
<p>keep going</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say one more little thing and</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll stop because I had a friend</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I never did this but he does this it</p>
<p>seems to work</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>he basically</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll go to Kentucky Fried Chicken right</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll order all this junk food</p>
<p>and he will actually he has a he has</p>
<p>this this is kind of gross okay he has a</p>
<p>cup and he will chew it enjoy it but he</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t swallow it and he spits it out</p>
<p>and he does this with all this type of</p>
<p>junk food and he swears</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>it totally satisfies him</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t have any problem from it</p>
<p>he never swallows it and he&rsquo;s like full</p>
<p>after doing this so you know what</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you have to do that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you have to do but just don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>in public and mention my name at the</p>
<p>same time</p>
<p>right I had a quick another quick</p>
<p>question if I mean</p>
<p>um so what if I do keto religiously for</p>
<p>six to eight months 10 months a year and</p>
<p>I achieve my ideal goal I&rsquo;ve also</p>
<p>started like exercising uh in the</p>
<p>previous time I told you I lost 30 kgs</p>
<p>that was purely with Keto no exercise at</p>
<p>all not even walking like not even like</p>
<p>walking religiously this General walk</p>
<p>five minutes uh to the office that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that was normal uh not doing it as an</p>
<p>exercise so now I&rsquo;m uh also going to the</p>
<p>gym so what if I do it for like six</p>
<p>months or an ear and I achieve my ideal</p>
<p>goal and I&rsquo;m in the best shape of my</p>
<p>life</p>
<p>and you would not like this but if I</p>
<p>decide to quit Kido I get this a lot</p>
<p>that no matter you lose 50 kgs</p>
<p>uh by doing something extreme like keto</p>
<p>I say it&rsquo;s healthy but it&rsquo;s difficult to</p>
<p>stay on it uh</p>
<p>uh because of you like it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>anti-social at times like there&rsquo;s speed</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s stuff when you&rsquo;re going out</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re traveling you cannot get healthy</p>
<p>food when you&rsquo;re traveling or on</p>
<p>vacation so that&rsquo;s an excuse but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it is so if I leave they say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to put put on all those</p>
<p>weight back no matter what you do</p>
<p>so is this true like you are going to</p>
<p>get back even if you&rsquo;re having a</p>
<p>balanced diet and uh doing</p>
<p>um exercise right it&rsquo;s kind of like um</p>
<p>gosh you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been off alcohol for 10 years I</p>
<p>should be able to go back on it and be</p>
<p>fine I don&rsquo;t know why this alcohol keeps</p>
<p>kicking my butt</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s just not we consider this a</p>
<p>normal carbs like carbs are normal but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really not unfortunately so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would recommend</p>
<p>get get your ideal goal now you&rsquo;ve built</p>
<p>up a level of Health that you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have before you have this you kind of</p>
<p>build up this um this reserve of Health</p>
<p>that you can now afford to go off the</p>
<p>program occasionally as long as you get</p>
<p>back on</p>
<p>because of course if you&rsquo;re going back</p>
<p>to the same lifestyle you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna revert because these foods</p>
<p>do not promote health</p>
<p>and Quito</p>
<p>is low carb</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;re burning</p>
<p>fat and you&rsquo;re avoiding sugar right</p>
<p>keto is basically just preventing</p>
<p>diseases it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>contribute to your health well I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t create health because what</p>
<p>are you replacing it with it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>avoiding certain things it&rsquo;s like it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really Define like what actually</p>
<p>are you eating so it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>combination of</p>
<p>focusing on creating your health by</p>
<p>eating Nutri dense foods</p>
<p>but by lowering the carbs you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>avoiding disease insulin resistance the</p>
<p>fatty liver being overweight</p>
<p>etc etc diabetes</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>same thing with alcohol if you go back</p>
<p>to alcohol you will have a bad liver I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry but um</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>you can go off but you have to be able</p>
<p>to afford that extra</p>
<p>have that extra Health Reserve to be</p>
<p>able to afford to go off occasionally</p>
<p>all right all right well anyway Muhammad</p>
<p>thanks so much for that get back with us</p>
<p>and um I will say that I&rsquo;ve had the</p>
<p>pleasure of being over the Berg&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and there is no reason to suffer while</p>
<p>being on keto Karen whips up the most</p>
<p>fantastic tasty some desserts just</p>
<p>everything I mean I didn&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>anything on the table that that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>delicious so if you spend some time with</p>
<p>it good grief there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s just no</p>
<p>reason to suffer at all I mean it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>to swing through McDonald&rsquo;s but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to go through that and still</p>
<p>be satisfied at least that&rsquo;s been my</p>
<p>observation</p>
<p>yeah and you know I I mean yesterday I</p>
<p>was driving down the street and I saw</p>
<p>Popeye&rsquo;s Chicken would I like to pull up</p>
<p>and have some of that I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>I know what I&rsquo;d feel like after I&rsquo;d feel</p>
<p>disgusting so I&rsquo;m like I don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>do that at one point I would have done</p>
<p>it but now I really know the difference</p>
<p>I see the difference because I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>off and on off and on so I just feel</p>
<p>better I I prefer to feel better</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s just me but</p>
<p>yeah well it always pays off okay Miriam</p>
<p>are you ready drum roll Miriam had asked</p>
<p>how do I lose excess belly fat and it</p>
<p>happened to pertain to question number</p>
<p>two which asks which type of exercise</p>
<p>will most help you lose belly fat uh the</p>
<p>audience came back seventy percent of</p>
<p>them is some form of high intensity</p>
<p>exercise 10 say long walks five percent</p>
<p>say Pilates in particular five percent</p>
<p>say sit-ups and five percent say lifting</p>
<p>weights resistance training</p>
<p>good good answers</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s some new research that I</p>
<p>stumbled on that&rsquo;s actually quite</p>
<p>interesting and that one paper was</p>
<p>reviewing 52 different studies on this</p>
<p>one topic and this surprised me but it</p>
<p>makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>and they measured like higher intensity</p>
<p>versus lower intensity walking and</p>
<p>walking hands down one ah to produce</p>
<p>more benefit in your midsection I&rsquo;m and</p>
<p>I think I think there&rsquo;s a couple reasons</p>
<p>why this is first of all</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about walking in like</p>
<p>five minutes a day I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>just through the day if you calculate</p>
<p>your steps and you can get up to eight</p>
<p>thousand to ten thousand or more steps a</p>
<p>day which is you know a few hours at</p>
<p>least a few hours of study walking</p>
<p>and then maybe also periodically</p>
<p>add in maybe some stairs or Hills which</p>
<p>actually don&rsquo;t even factor I mean they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even factor that I think um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually a little bit better now of</p>
<p>course I do both the the high intensity</p>
<p>is good for muscle strength testosterone</p>
<p>hormone growth hormone anti-aging</p>
<p>and a little bit of weight loss but</p>
<p>primarily the walking is going to be the</p>
<p>best thing for the uh the belly fat to</p>
<p>lose that you&rsquo;re going to burn off sugar</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>flesh out cortisol and adrenaline that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stressed you&rsquo;re gonna it&rsquo;s a low stress</p>
<p>activity and it&rsquo;s a lot easier for</p>
<p>people to con uh face or do through the</p>
<p>day as to walking I mean anyone can just</p>
<p>walk unless they don&rsquo;t have a leg but um</p>
<p>or also you know just</p>
<p>all sorts of things start walking your</p>
<p>dog get a friend walk instead of driving</p>
<p>walk</p>
<p>so I live on a farm and we get massive</p>
<p>amount of walking and recently I did a</p>
<p>um stem cell</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain</p>
<p>how it I&rsquo;ll tell you the results in</p>
<p>about a month but I just had it done</p>
<p>last Friday where they did actually my</p>
<p>own fat cells I had to take fat off my</p>
<p>stomach liposuction and then spin it</p>
<p>take the stem cells out and re-inject it</p>
<p>and made the whole thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so um I had I didn&rsquo;t have enough fat so</p>
<p>I had to gain weight in my belly I had</p>
<p>to gain five pounds that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>easy for me anyway I&rsquo;m sure other people</p>
<p>say no it&rsquo;s easy for me but I had to um</p>
<p>I had to stop walking</p>
<p>because I realized that that was not I</p>
<p>would just burn off a lot of calories</p>
<p>um from walking so much so I could start</p>
<p>to stop walking and then then that</p>
<p>really actually increased it and I of</p>
<p>course I&rsquo;d eat more and I ate some</p>
<p>apples and potatoes and things like that</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um boy if I kept up that walking</p>
<p>that was a significant problem</p>
<p>so if we just reverse engineer that</p>
<p>walking I think is something that</p>
<p>everyone can include in there but uh you</p>
<p>know if you can go on a walk one hour a</p>
<p>day or even another hour that would be</p>
<p>even the the best thing you can do</p>
<p>boy that&rsquo;s right fantastic with the</p>
<p>reduction of the snacks the fruit</p>
<p>and uh two meals a day uh keep your</p>
<p>carbs low and you will lose the belly</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>go to our next question here it is Doc</p>
<p>okay what is the best food for the brain</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not talking about a generalized</p>
<p>food like a very specific food out of</p>
<p>all the foods out there what would be</p>
<p>the best food for your brain</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>to improve you know cognitive</p>
<p>Improvement mood of improvement</p>
<p>preventing stroke</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s like things like that wow</p>
<p>well waiting with baited breath okay</p>
<p>listen to this doc lubos from YouTube I</p>
<p>need help I get a pulsating sensation in</p>
<p>my gut throat and back of my head every</p>
<p>time I eat food I&rsquo;m in constant pain and</p>
<p>have been diagnosed with candidas please</p>
<p>help she writes</p>
<p>if you get this um this pulse and you</p>
<p>hear your pulse in your body</p>
<p>um that usually is a potassium</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>when that can come from consuming too</p>
<p>many carbs too so you need to get on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet now you mentioned Candida</p>
<p>so you need to take a probiotic</p>
<p>immediately and um</p>
<p>start doing intermittent fasting I think</p>
<p>that would help you</p>
<p>um but don&rsquo;t neglect the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting because what you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is related to the digestive system so we</p>
<p>want to clear that those pipes out and</p>
<p>now eat so frequently if you feel the so</p>
<p>many people are like just they eat</p>
<p>constantly they Grace and they just the</p>
<p>whole the pipe is filled and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a chance to kind of clear out this</p>
<p>digestive tube which is well over 20</p>
<p>feet</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>all right hope that helps</p>
<p>okay look at a diva from Facebook thanks</p>
<p>for the walking information I&rsquo;m at 3 200</p>
<p>steps a day already this morning go diva</p>
<p>keep it up it you know you can make it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very competitive so I&rsquo;d like to make</p>
<p>it a game and you just keep increasing</p>
<p>it and</p>
<p>okay today I&rsquo;m going to do this it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great game it&rsquo;s uh and it helps</p>
<p>reduce stress and when you&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>too especially outside</p>
<p>um not like indoors in a treadmill if</p>
<p>you can</p>
<p>to add the X Factor</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be just looking down</p>
<p>all the time you want to be looking out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very beneficial for the</p>
<p>parasympathetic nervous system so look</p>
<p>at trees Birds people things like that</p>
<p>that little thing is going to make a</p>
<p>huge difference to What&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>vagus nerve and the parasympathetic</p>
<p>nervous system but of course watch where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re walking too so you don&rsquo;t trip</p>
<p>over anything good advice okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um well here&rsquo;s interesting uh simran I</p>
<p>think uh why don&rsquo;t you wait a month from</p>
<p>YouTube what are your thoughts about</p>
<p>stem cell therapy to address certain</p>
<p>diseases or conditions should we let him</p>
<p>stand by</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;ll just tell you generally it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s quite magical these stem cells</p>
<p>are magical stuff I mean just the</p>
<p>researchers and I mean they&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>like literally 35 new research papers</p>
<p>out a day on this topic uh unfortunately</p>
<p>it probably will not</p>
<p>become very popular in the medical</p>
<p>community right now because there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it would literally take take away a</p>
<p>lot of the drug industry and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to do that but I think from a</p>
<p>Grassroots campaign if more and more</p>
<p>people do it unfortunately it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>expensive</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s different types of stem cell</p>
<p>I I like I think the the best type of</p>
<p>stem cell is the one where they take</p>
<p>take it out of your own fat</p>
<p>um but these some stem cells are um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re undifferentiated which means</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of like blank slates</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>they go out and they find areas of</p>
<p>inflammation and they start to infuse in</p>
<p>that area and start to</p>
<p>tell cells around it to do their job and</p>
<p>heal and they replace certain cells it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s just beyond a mystery it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>magical and</p>
<p>I keep seeing these amazing results of</p>
<p>stem cell but I will do a video on this</p>
<p>uh but I want to give it a good month to</p>
<p>kick in and do the job because I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>still recovering from this because it</p>
<p>was a liposuction which was uh</p>
<p>interesting it feels like I just did a</p>
<p>thousand sit-ups oh wow okay folks uh so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like everyone to help me so we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got Lonnie and Manola left we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to bring you up quite yet but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re running out of time so I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to ask you all to kind of belt it out</p>
<p>quickly and first let&rsquo;s get our next</p>
<p>question uh or answered and that was</p>
<p>quiz question number three then I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna throw up another one</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>and eighty percent say fatty fish or Cod</p>
<p>Liver ten percent say eggs five percent</p>
<p>say walnuts and five percent say</p>
<p>Mushrooms who&rsquo;s right doc</p>
<p>well the majority is right it&rsquo;s fatty</p>
<p>fish especially salmon but there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>halibut and there&rsquo;s um also um a</p>
<p>sardines but um the salmon is really at</p>
<p>the top of the list too because it also</p>
<p>has um</p>
<p>this pigment this pink pigment which is</p>
<p>called</p>
<p>uh astaxanthins and this pigment is</p>
<p>um neural protective it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>important in the in the brain and when</p>
<p>you get grass I&rsquo;m sorry farm-raised fish</p>
<p>not grass-fed fish farm-raised fish they</p>
<p>have to put</p>
<p>dye in there to make it Pink to make it</p>
<p>look like it&rsquo;s pink salmon or also to be</p>
<p>gray so you want to get the wild caught</p>
<p>and have that at least once or twice a</p>
<p>week but it&rsquo;s good for the brain it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>keto it does a lot uh so that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would recommend</p>
<p>okay very good all right here is our</p>
<p>next to last question Doc and there you</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>all right true or false</p>
<p>hydroponic vegetables</p>
<p>and soil grown vegetables</p>
<p>have roughly the same nutrition</p>
<p>all right and by the way my producer</p>
<p>said that some music was playing behind</p>
<p>the last one forgive me I must have</p>
<p>clicked the wrong button audience never</p>
<p>let it happen again so answer that</p>
<p>question now as promised let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Manola from Albania and let&rsquo;s see get</p>
<p>yourself unmuted deer and you&rsquo;re on with</p>
<p>your one quick question if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mind go</p>
<p>hello Dr Burke and thank you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been in keto since a year and</p>
<p>trying to have done omed for a year and</p>
<p>I follow you regularly and your advices</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve lost 75 pounds in this year</p>
<p>and all my health problems have been</p>
<p>improved dramatically but I still</p>
<p>measure the blood sugar levels between</p>
<p>90 and 100 every time of the day I</p>
<p>measured it it is never below 90. even</p>
<p>fasting blood sugar or before eating</p>
<p>that one meal or two hours after the</p>
<p>meal it&rsquo;s between 90 and 100 and</p>
<p>if this is the case of severe insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>and neogle gluconeogenesis is happening</p>
<p>how to make sure I protect my adrenals</p>
<p>while trying to improve insulin</p>
<p>resistance and not doing any harm</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to give up on it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the healing power of fasting</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to give up it</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s a really good question just</p>
<p>so just to clarify a couple things with</p>
<p>um anyone listening</p>
<p>um omat it means one meal a day</p>
<p>and also she lost 70 pounds and um the</p>
<p>problem now is her blood sugars are just</p>
<p>slightly a little bit higher than she</p>
<p>would like them 90 to 100 because they</p>
<p>should be below 80.</p>
<p>um and she also mentioned something</p>
<p>called gluconeogenesis that means the</p>
<p>liver is making sugar too much sugar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happens when you have uh</p>
<p>insulin resistances</p>
<p>the liver will make just a little bit</p>
<p>more sugar</p>
<p>what you have to realize</p>
<p>when we go</p>
<p>80 milligrams per deciliter basically</p>
<p>means one little teaspoon of sugar in</p>
<p>all of your blood like a gallon and</p>
<p>half of blood so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>much and you don&rsquo;t have to even eat</p>
<p>sugar your body will make the sugar from</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>to keep that Sugar we get up to 90 and</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only talking about maybe</p>
<p>not even a teaspoon and a half</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing a teaspoon and maybe an</p>
<p>eighth maybe a fourth so we&rsquo;re adding</p>
<p>maybe just the smallest bit additional</p>
<p>sugar which is not very much so</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re telling me is not very very</p>
<p>serious at all okay you don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to mess with your adrenals it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to be an issue it&rsquo;s so minor I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even worry about it but that</p>
<p>being said</p>
<p>um of course</p>
<p>walking around the block should burn</p>
<p>that off if you wanted to do that and</p>
<p>you yes your liver is just making a</p>
<p>little bit more so I would probably just</p>
<p>focus a little bit more on the liver</p>
<p>over time that will come down you must</p>
<p>have had really bad insulin resistance</p>
<p>for many years</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s just what you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with is you just have to give it more</p>
<p>time but there&rsquo;s things that you can do</p>
<p>as well you can take um like milk</p>
<p>thistle</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um steam nettle root</p>
<p>um you can</p>
<p>um berberine just certain herbs for the</p>
<p>liver to kind of speed things up a</p>
<p>little bit but don&rsquo;t be concerned</p>
<p>out of all the problems you have this is</p>
<p>such a tiny problem and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>almost insignificant just to let you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>yes uh</p>
<p>I mean I want to protect adrenals from</p>
<p>producing too much cortisone oh no uh</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that it</p>
<p>might not even be your adrenals making</p>
<p>that Sugar it could be another mechanism</p>
<p>it could be um</p>
<p>another mechanism</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s not over taxing the adrenals too</p>
<p>much at all it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that you know and</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re saying is the</p>
<p>cortisol is counteracting the blood</p>
<p>sugar but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a mind it&rsquo;s such a minor thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to worry don&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about your adrenals right now okay</p>
<p>thank you so much Manola I appreciate</p>
<p>your question get back with us I hope</p>
<p>that that uh wraps it up for you let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get back to our next to last question</p>
<p>which asked true false hydroponic</p>
<p>vegetables and soil grown vegetables</p>
<p>have roughly the same nutrition and not</p>
<p>many people oh wow yes question number</p>
<p>four 95 of our respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>false so I thought they said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>positive five percent say it&rsquo;s true I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>voting with a 95 percent</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not the same but but</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting if you look on some</p>
<p>of the sites especially the hydroponic</p>
<p>sites they&rsquo;ll say no it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>roughly in fact hydroponic might have a</p>
<p>little bit more nutrition so so I have a</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>are you telling me that you can grow a</p>
<p>plant in water and 15 minerals that have</p>
<p>the same nutrition that&rsquo;s in soil which</p>
<p>has not just 15 minerals it has probably</p>
<p>94 minerals it has</p>
<p>billions of microbes it has all sorts of</p>
<p>structure for those microbes to live</p>
<p>home of those microbes to live and the</p>
<p>major nutrients</p>
<p>for a plant is from eating microbes the</p>
<p>problem is the hydroponic you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the structure to hold the number of</p>
<p>microbes that are needed it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>and to me it&rsquo;s very obvious it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>same and you can&rsquo;t get the same</p>
<p>nutrition yet</p>
<p>is a very insufficient evidence to prove</p>
<p>that but just common sense will tell me</p>
<p>so I plan on doing research on the topic</p>
<p>I I bought all sorts of Hydroponic and</p>
<p>aeroponic units</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like it I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m trying to find</p>
<p>out how I can sell those units if you</p>
<p>anyone wants to buy it call me because</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t produce the the same</p>
<p>food as soil based so you</p>
<p>the reason I bring this up is because if</p>
<p>you have the option to get soil based</p>
<p>salad and vegetables from someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Garden or a farmer&rsquo;s market or growing</p>
<p>at your own you realize what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting you are getting not just a</p>
<p>superior product but you&rsquo;re getting all</p>
<p>the phytonutrients from help from the</p>
<p>microbes you&rsquo;re getting a better immune</p>
<p>system in that plant you&rsquo;re getting even</p>
<p>a probiotic because they&rsquo;re containing</p>
<p>one cup of vegetables contains close to</p>
<p>a hundred million microbes that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>wow and so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re seeding the the</p>
<p>gut unfortunately in the grocery store</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grown in water so it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>unfortunately and um we want to</p>
<p>go just Beyond Organic because they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say oh yeah it&rsquo;s organic well that you</p>
<p>can do Hydroponic and still be organic</p>
<p>because without pesticides you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really like is it soil ground that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably the most important thing for me</p>
<p>and especially healthy soils if you want</p>
<p>to get healthy</p>
<p>that food has to come from the soil from</p>
<p>the microbes and then the animals have</p>
<p>to eat something from the soil not just</p>
<p>eat Just Grains well that certainly</p>
<p>makes sense let&rsquo;s see here&rsquo;s our final</p>
<p>question for the day doc</p>
<p>okay why do people suffer such horrific</p>
<p>side effects from psychotropic drugs</p>
<p>what are those</p>
<p>that would be like drugs for uh</p>
<p>schizophrenia bipolar ADHD depression</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some of these drugs that um that</p>
<p>increase like dopamine</p>
<p>and serotonin</p>
<p>interesting All Right audience climb on</p>
<p>it and last but not least we are going</p>
<p>to go to uh Lonnie who is from Oregon</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s unmuting herself dutifully and</p>
<p>Lonnie you&rsquo;re on with your one question</p>
<p>for Dr Burr go</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke I am so honored to be able</p>
<p>to speak with you today I follow you</p>
<p>religiously and I just love every word</p>
<p>out of your mouth I really do</p>
<p>um my issue is</p>
<p>um related to blood pressure and insulin</p>
<p>resistance I&rsquo;ve been chasing my insulin</p>
<p>resistance now for</p>
<p>probably about eight nine months and oh</p>
<p>my gosh it&rsquo;s been a real taxing process</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been approaching it from every</p>
<p>organ I can think of and from what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard from you my issues are</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t figure it out I can&rsquo;t figure out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up with my blood pressure</p>
<p>no matter what I do I&rsquo;ve been keto I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done prolonged fasting I do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting have been doing it for</p>
<p>probably three or four months now after</p>
<p>a seven day prolonged fast which was</p>
<p>fabulous at your suggestion found</p>
<p>everything that you suggested for and</p>
<p>during that prolonged fast but this</p>
<p>blood pressure thing is just kicking my</p>
<p>butt I don&rsquo;t know what the heck to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sometimes it&rsquo;s 170 over 110.</p>
<p>and do you um have you ever had a CAC</p>
<p>test a calcium coronary artery calcium</p>
<p>calcification test I just got back from</p>
<p>a cardio appointment yesterday with my</p>
<p>doctor she says everything is perfect</p>
<p>everything okay good so even my</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>um I thought for a minute it was iodine</p>
<p>related so I upped my iodine intake</p>
<p>because of the the self-test that you</p>
<p>can do with the iodine disappears that</p>
<p>that disappeared pretty quick so I</p>
<p>figured okay I definitely am short on</p>
<p>iodine</p>
<p>um I do these I&rsquo;m so excited to hear you</p>
<p>talk about stem cells because I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing the Stem Cell Activation patch</p>
<p>which I can talk to you about later I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do a promo on it but I</p>
<p>love these things</p>
<p>um but I don&rsquo;t know what else to think</p>
<p>the only thing I can think of to do is</p>
<p>to just cut out everything and start</p>
<p>over again just do two weeks nothing and</p>
<p>then come back at it and introduce one</p>
<p>one thing at a time but I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what to do about the bug the</p>
<p>blood pressure did the blood pressure</p>
<p>start after uh some</p>
<p>event of some sort or is this gradual</p>
<p>over time you know I think it&rsquo;s been an</p>
<p>issue for several years I had a horrific</p>
<p>horse wreck</p>
<p>um about 10 years ago I had an aneurysm</p>
<p>rupture in my right frontal lobe and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had 22 surgeries since I had been</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been assaulted with all kinds of</p>
<p>anesthesias and surgical procedures and</p>
<p>numerous repairs of this that and</p>
<p>another thing but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s been a really rough ride this</p>
<p>last 10 years but I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m just grateful</p>
<p>to be alive actually</p>
<p>great okay so this is what I&rsquo;d recommend</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that you took high doses of</p>
<p>vitamin D3 and I&rsquo;m assuming that you</p>
<p>took high levels of potassium as</p>
<p>electrolytes for a period of time high</p>
<p>high level as electrolytes as potassium</p>
<p>yeah because potassium is one of the</p>
<p>one of the best things just soften the</p>
<p>arteries and help lower blood pressure</p>
<p>and I would I would shoot</p>
<p>we took a potassium electrolyte powder I</p>
<p>would take</p>
<p>a definitely four or five Scoops to that</p>
<p>a day</p>
<p>that will give you 6 000 milligrams and</p>
<p>anything extra your body will get rid of</p>
<p>but that will um definitely help</p>
<p>because so many problems with blood</p>
<p>pressures related to potassium now the</p>
<p>other thing is</p>
<p>when you get a surgery</p>
<p>your adrenal glands are always awake and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a major stress in adrenal cortisol</p>
<p>and many times when you get surgery they</p>
<p>have to give you an IV with extra</p>
<p>potassium because the potassium drops</p>
<p>with surgery</p>
<p>so the combination of all those</p>
<p>surgeries probably really depleted you</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really test potassium from</p>
<p>blood because most of it is inside the</p>
<p>cell</p>
<p>uh 99 of it and you you have to do an</p>
<p>intracellular test but just by taking</p>
<p>potassium if the blood pressure comes</p>
<p>down then we know I would also look at</p>
<p>um some of my videos that I&rsquo;ve done on</p>
<p>how to deal with old injuries</p>
<p>um because there&rsquo;s a really great</p>
<p>acupressure technique that I would</p>
<p>recommend to apply because all injuries</p>
<p>are accumulative and that many surgeries</p>
<p>could have really kind of It kind of</p>
<p>keeps your body in a state of a flight</p>
<p>or fight</p>
<p>so your problem might not be insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>as much as</p>
<p>an adrenal slash low potassium</p>
<p>sympathetic dominant there&rsquo;s a if you</p>
<p>could find someone that has a heart rate</p>
<p>variability test to measure your</p>
<p>autonomic nervous system just to look at</p>
<p>your sympathetic versus your</p>
<p>parasympathetic</p>
<p>that would be a great</p>
<p>great way uh</p>
<p>to assess that I wish I still had mine</p>
<p>in practice because that was a great</p>
<p>little unit you can just measure and go</p>
<p>oh no wonder you got your foot on the</p>
<p>gas pedal but there&rsquo;s no brake pads so</p>
<p>that is totally me that is totally me</p>
<p>yeah so B1 potassium those are the two I</p>
<p>would focus on and then</p>
<p>um also watch my I think if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken it&rsquo;s called the stress webinar</p>
<p>where I walk people through the</p>
<p>acupressure</p>
<p>on the stress points of the body</p>
<p>especially the adrenal points that that</p>
<p>tends to help as well</p>
<p>by the way Lonnie we&rsquo;re just about a</p>
<p>time but man you have really been</p>
<p>roughed up and we&rsquo;d sure love to hear</p>
<p>back from you and and you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working out awful hard at it so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry we don&rsquo;t have more time uh today</p>
<p>to deal with we really like to hear back</p>
<p>from you</p>
<p>um and see what happens this year</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re working so hard at your</p>
<p>health and we&rsquo;re all glad that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alive my God an aneurysm is an awful</p>
<p>thing so a good best of luck with that</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re going to For Your</p>
<p>Entertainment Lonnie answer the final</p>
<p>question of the day which asks why do</p>
<p>people suffer uh such horrific side</p>
<p>effects from cyber Tropic drugs and let</p>
<p>me bring up Dr Berg again</p>
<p>um and 60 of our respondents say those</p>
<p>drugs can damage the liver or kidneys 30</p>
<p>say they can damage the mitochondria and</p>
<p>10 say they can interrupt healthy</p>
<p>cellular functions fancy answers</p>
<p>everyone is correct but um what I wanted</p>
<p>to mention about this is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this whole idea that um oh</p>
<p>you have this condition and um you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related to low dopamine for example</p>
<p>right so now what we have to do is we</p>
<p>have to treat it with something to</p>
<p>increase your dopamine</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s definitely one it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>positively one thing we know for sure</p>
<p>about dopamine</p>
<p>no one understands dopamine</p>
<p>or even serotonin as far as to the</p>
<p>degree of</p>
<p>um of how it really works in the body</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many conflicting theories and</p>
<p>uh the net I mean week by week it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they change oh we found that that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work it really does this so they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know and then when you go into</p>
<p>giving someone a drug to increase</p>
<p>one neurotransmitter and not really</p>
<p>taking consider they all work together</p>
<p>oh my goodness you start creating</p>
<p>problems with all of your elect all your</p>
<p>neurotransmitters and</p>
<p>the side effects from these drugs are</p>
<p>horrific I mean for example</p>
<p>um even some of the even the drugs for</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s when they try to elevate</p>
<p>uh dopamine 14 of the time the person</p>
<p>becomes a gambler they start developing</p>
<p>addictions wow um even um sometimes when</p>
<p>people take um drugs for</p>
<p>um schizophrenia they end up having</p>
<p>parkinsonian symptoms so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>um messed up and so there&rsquo;s over a</p>
<p>hundred thousand different research</p>
<p>papers on on this top trying to find</p>
<p>this magical cure for these illnesses by</p>
<p>manipulating neurotransmitters without</p>
<p>side effects well guess what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never going to happen because</p>
<p>um anytime you try to manipulate this</p>
<p>one thing without looking at the whole</p>
<p>body without dealing with the diet</p>
<p>without looking at nutrition</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to make the person</p>
<p>worse unfortunately and um I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>release a video on this on this topic</p>
<p>because if someone&rsquo;s considering it they</p>
<p>should really get all the information up</p>
<p>front especially the side effects to see</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the best option</p>
<p>on that note really thank you so much</p>
<p>for your attention this long stay tuned</p>
<p>for some great videos coming up in the</p>
<p>next week have a great weekend see</p>
<p>everyone</p>
<p>foreign</p>
