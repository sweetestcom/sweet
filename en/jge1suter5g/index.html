<p>Ôªøhey what is going on you guys I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>part it&rsquo;s and today I&rsquo;m gonna be the</p>
<p>judge for round two on mr. B six</p>
<p>thousands tournament battle of the</p>
<p>beasts</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched everyone&rsquo;s entry videos</p>
<p>they were very interesting considering</p>
<p>mr. beats kind of gave you guys this</p>
<p>weird topic to go off on and that was</p>
<p>cake I know we&rsquo;re trying to talk about</p>
<p>cake how to make cake different kinds of</p>
<p>cake or having experiences with cake on</p>
<p>its own is weird and at the same time</p>
<p>keep in mind that talking about</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s out of the ordinary</p>
<p>brings it&rsquo;s interesting conversation to</p>
<p>the table and kind of makes you come out</p>
<p>of this comfort zone of talking about</p>
<p>killstreaks or score streaks perks guns</p>
<p>variants and so on so this is gonna be</p>
<p>pretty interesting because a lot of you</p>
<p>guys talked about different things and</p>
<p>it was kind of interesting to listen to</p>
<p>what you guys have to say but either way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be judging this around giving you</p>
<p>guys your feedback on your videos and</p>
<p>announcing who is gonna be making it on</p>
<p>to the next round</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s begin north am DJ versus tricks</p>

<p>a lot of energy in your commentary and I</p>
<p>like that that means that you are very</p>
<p>confident in your commentating skills</p>
<p>you know what you&rsquo;re talking about you</p>
<p>come in and it was kind of like you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always been common dating your whole</p>
<p>life you really knew what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>you were very genuine and that is great</p>
<p>however the video quality of your video</p>
<p>was actually pretty bad I even bumped it</p>
<p>up to 720p for you and it was still</p>
<p>pretty bad it was like you&rsquo;re recording</p>
<p>with an elgato HDL what that was about</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m not trying to offend you but</p>
<p>really this is 2015 you might want to</p>
<p>try to get your quality to at least 720p</p>
<p>if not 1080p where it should be at but</p>
<p>either way that was a good commentary</p>
<p>but your quality of the video gameplay</p>
<p>was actually pretty bad as well as you</p>
<p>had this weird of border around your</p>
<p>video now I&rsquo;m not sure what that was</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>however you might want to fix that it</p>
<p>was very distracting to look at not sure</p>
<p>what that was about as well as your</p>
<p>music was a little bit loud as well you</p>
<p>might want to tone it down a little bit</p>
<p>make it at least half of what your</p>
<p>commentary volume is or at least a</p>
<p>little bit lower than that now the only</p>
<p>big problem with this video guys is that</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t talk about the topic that mr.</p>
<p>B 6000 actually gave you you talked</p>
<p>about cod changes that was going on from</p>
<p>Cod 3 all the way up but we asked you to</p>
<p>talk about cake this might actually</p>
<p>bring you down in this competition just</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t talk about what we</p>
<p>gave you to talk about maybe you</p>
<p>beforehand were not sure what was going</p>
<p>on there what was going through your</p>
<p>mind when you did this commentary but we</p>
<p>did ask you to talk about cake I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>have to talk to mr. B 6,000 a little bit</p>
<p>later and ask him what the final verdict</p>
<p>of this is but please keep in mind that</p>
<p>next time if you do make it to the next</p>
<p>round please talk about the commentary</p>
<p>topic that we give you or else we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have to give you this win maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna lose we&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>see what happens buddy and next up we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got tricks gamer and your gameplay</p>
<p>commentary was pretty good your gameplay</p>
<p>quality was great 30 frames a second at</p>
<p>720p very nice crisp and clean and I</p>
<p>liked it very good and your commentary</p>
<p>was pretty good as well you&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>genuine you were very enthusiastic as</p>
<p>well you had a lot of energy and it was</p>
<p>very very nice to listen to it was great</p>
<p>however the mic quality was a little bit</p>
<p>low or maybe you were coming from like a</p>
<p>speaker or a walkie-talkie I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly know where you were recording</p>
<p>your commentary from men but it was a</p>
<p>little bit weird to listen to it</p>
<p>literally did sound like you were coming</p>
<p>from a speaker like a PA system or a</p>
<p>walkie-talkie it was like it was kind of</p>
<p>like that so not sure what that was</p>
<p>about next time you might want to try to</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re getting your mic</p>
<p>quality as crisp and clean as possible</p>
<p>as loud as you can as well because that</p>
<p>was pretty low you might want to fix</p>
<p>that at some point if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>continue with the mic quality that you</p>
<p>have and you&rsquo;re gonna be putting music</p>
<p>in like you did your music might just</p>
<p>override your commentary and a lot of</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t gonna be able to hear you</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind as well now</p>
<p>your commentary had a little bit of dead</p>
<p>air here and there a little bit of dead</p>
<p>space you might want to keep that away</p>
<p>and fix that a little bit as well</p>
<p>because dead air dead space is not a</p>
<p>good thing to have in your commentaries</p>
<p>at all no one wants to listen to someone</p>
<p>talk about one thing be dead for about</p>
<p>three seconds and then continue their</p>
<p>commentary now I understand that you</p>
<p>tried to do a little bit of a comedic</p>
<p>effect here and there</p>
<p>however there&rsquo;s different ways to</p>
<p>approach it and there&rsquo;s things that you</p>
<p>can plan ahead of time before you go</p>
<p>ahead and do them that way they&rsquo;re a lot</p>
<p>more smooth a lot more crisp and then</p>
<p>you can edit them in and make your</p>
<p>commentaries a lot better so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that you might want to keep in</p>
<p>mind as well next time when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>your commentaries and one more thing</p>
<p>that kind of killed it for me kill</p>
<p>divides for me you&rsquo;re doing so good you</p>
<p>were doing great is that you cussed and</p>
<p>people who know me I&rsquo;m not a big guy on</p>
<p>cussing</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about cakes here the</p>
<p>commentary was about cake you got that</p>
<p>right you did talk about cake however</p>
<p>there was kind of this unnecessary</p>
<p>reason for you to be cussing even when</p>
<p>you started talking about this random</p>
<p>thing that happened when you died I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what that was about I</p>
<p>understood the comedic effect however</p>
<p>you kind of cussed and it kind of killed</p>
<p>the vibe I know you&rsquo;re a young kid and</p>
<p>you got a lot of potential man but you</p>
<p>got to keep it real you can&rsquo;t just go</p>
<p>and do that that kind of killed it for</p>
<p>me I know a lot of other people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that sensitive that kind of thing and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that sensitive that either but</p>
<p>that just kind of ruined the vibe for me</p>
<p>man so either way it was a good</p>
<p>commentary it was a good gameplay but</p>
<p>that one thing killed it for me if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you do though keep doing you</p>
<p>keep doing what you got to do but for me</p>
<p>that was just a little bit much</p>
<p>considering we&rsquo;re talking about cake</p>
<p>there was really no reason for you to go</p>
<p>that far in if you&rsquo;re an older dude and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that and the story kind of</p>
<p>needed to have that then sure why not</p>
<p>but either way good commentary good</p>
<p>gameplay keep it up now after talking to</p>
<p>the big bossman to figure out who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna win between north and DJ and</p>
<p>tricks gamer we have come to the</p>
<p>conclusion and the verdict that the</p>
<p>winner and the person who&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>going to the next round is Northam DJ</p>
<p>the only reason is that we really did</p>
<p>like your commentary it was great your</p>
<p>commentary skills we&rsquo;re very much there</p>
<p>and we want you to go into the next</p>
<p>round because we feel like you have a</p>
<p>lot more potential to go on and continue</p>
<p>however the only thing is that we really</p>
<p>felt like you could have talked about</p>
<p>cake and it would have been just as fine</p>
<p>as your commentary was here but if you</p>
<p>talked about cake it probably would have</p>
<p>been just as great however you didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna give you another chance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go on to the next round and</p>
<p>hopefully this time you talk about the</p>
<p>actual topic we&rsquo;re gonna give you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no hard feelings to tricks gamer</p>
<p>his commentary was great he&rsquo;s still a</p>
<p>young kid he&rsquo;s got a long ways to go</p>
<p>keep doing what you got to do and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry maybe there will be another</p>
<p>commentary tournament down the line do</p>
<p>what you gotta do man it was really</p>
<p>great but tone down on some of the</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s just unnecessary sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good things sometimes it&rsquo;s bad it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just got to find the right path man so</p>
<p>either way so the one that&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>going on here is north am DJ spicy tuna</p>
<p>versus mangled pickle now no matter who</p>
<p>wins or loses in this round guys I want</p>
<p>you guys all to go over to their</p>
<p>channels and check out their entry video</p>
<p>for this particular round because it was</p>
<p>yes no honestly though it was the</p>
<p>funniest thing that I&rsquo;ve seen all day</p>
<p>both you guys did something ironically</p>
<p>the same you both talked about some kind</p>
<p>of information about cake or chocolate</p>
<p>you both did a funny kind of aspect to</p>
<p>your videos and I really did like that</p>
<p>you guys pulled it off really well</p>
<p>unfortunately only one of you guys can</p>
<p>really win in this particular thing and</p>
<p>that is going to be mangled pickle the</p>
<p>sole reason is that you had the moment</p>
<p>in your hand you had the moments there</p>
<p>you had the commentary you had the sound</p>
<p>effect you had the picture you had</p>
<p>everything in the grasp of your hand you</p>
<p>knew exactly what you were doing exactly</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going for and I really did</p>
<p>like that spicy tuna you were doing</p>
<p>great as well you were falling off a</p>
<p>little bit here and there I know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit difficult to talk about cake</p>
<p>but you did have a good commentary you</p>
<p>did have funny moments in there and I</p>
<p>did like it</p>
<p>unfortunately enough you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>win this round mangle pickle is gonna be</p>
<p>going on to the next round</p>
<p>congratulations to both of you guys</p>
<p>though you guys made me laugh I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>have to subscribe to your channels that</p>
<p>was just great stuff and hope to see</p>
<p>better stuff in the future</p>
<p>hey it&rsquo;s x-ray versus a flying modem now</p>
<p>compared to the both of you guys this</p>
<p>was a very very hard one for me to judge</p>
<p>you guys just had almost everything in</p>
<p>the package it was just honestly</p>
<p>unbelievable the kind of commentary that</p>
<p>came out of this video and between the</p>
<p>both of you guys I really did again have</p>
<p>a trouble trying to figure out which one</p>
<p>of you guys should go to the next round</p>
<p>because honestly if you guys were in</p>
<p>different brackets and facing different</p>
<p>people I&rsquo;m sure both of you would be</p>
<p>able to go to the next round but</p>
<p>unfortunately this isn&rsquo;t the case this</p>
<p>is where you two are gonna be going</p>
<p>head-to-head and who&rsquo;s gonna be going on</p>
<p>to the next round</p>
<p>you guys both had great commentary your</p>
<p>skills were just on another kind of tier</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what was going on listening</p>
<p>to this kind of commentary coming out of</p>
<p>both of you guys was very surprising to</p>
<p>me it was just a great commentary to</p>
<p>listen to you I had a great time</p>
<p>listening to both of your stories and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s funny is that you both actually</p>
<p>gave two differents perspectives in your</p>
<p>lives about cake and that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>pretty amazing that you guys didn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>talk about different kinds of cake the</p>
<p>origins or anything like that</p>
<p>you guys actually gave your own personal</p>
<p>life stories into this thing about cake</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s actually nice a lot of people</p>
<p>are going to be able to get the feels</p>
<p>from it be able to relate to you about</p>
<p>cake things like that good stuff good</p>
<p>work but unfortunately only one of you</p>
<p>guys are going to be able to make it to</p>
<p>the next round and that first</p>
<p>is gonna be a flying modem again both</p>
<p>your commentaries were great though I</p>
<p>feel like one just outweighed the other</p>
<p>one and that&rsquo;s gonna be flying modem</p>
<p>only because x-ray I feel like you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>commentary Lac just a little bit</p>
<p>inconsistency I feel like flying modems</p>
<p>flowed a lot better had better</p>
<p>consistency he really knew his story he</p>
<p>was really going with it all the way</p>
<p>through there was no little hiccups or</p>
<p>stutters or anything like that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a little minor thing that you can</p>
<p>improve on as you continue commentating</p>
<p>x-ray not a big deal continue what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing though congratulations to</p>
<p>flying modem and you&rsquo;re gonna be going</p>
<p>on to the next round again and finally</p>
<p>vile self versus casually insane</p>
<p>starting off here with casually insane</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t very much that I had to</p>
<p>critique you on because your overall</p>
<p>video quality was great there was</p>
<p>nothing too much wrong with your</p>
<p>commentary nothing too much wrong with</p>
<p>your gameplay there&rsquo;s only things that</p>
<p>you could tweak that could make it a</p>
<p>little bit better with your gameplay you</p>
<p>could actually add a little bit of</p>
<p>saturation in there to add a little bit</p>
<p>more color because there&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be watching your videos and be a</p>
<p>viewer and wanting to watch your</p>
<p>gameplay as well as listening to you</p>
<p>commentate there has to be at least some</p>
<p>color in the gameplay now I even make</p>
<p>this mistake myself when I am doing my</p>
<p>commentary and gameplays and things like</p>
<p>that then I forget to add a little bit</p>
<p>of color to it and it looks so grayscale</p>
<p>and black that not a lot of people want</p>
<p>to see that and they might click off and</p>
<p>do other things while listening but if</p>
<p>you really want your viewers to stay and</p>
<p>watch the gameplay while you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>your commentary add a little bit of</p>
<p>color in there a little bit of</p>
<p>saturation in there bump up the colors</p>
<p>and it will do a lot better for you in</p>
<p>the near future and your future videos</p>
<p>now for your commentary this is just</p>
<p>something that you get over time</p>
<p>something that you learn over time and</p>
<p>get used to and it&rsquo;s just trying to get</p>
<p>out of the little stuttery moments of</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking and you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>and then this happened to end that and</p>
<p>it was kind of funny I know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really do it like the way that I am</p>
<p>giving an example of but it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>little minor things that people learn</p>
<p>how to do over time and that&rsquo;s just one</p>
<p>of the things but either way your</p>
<p>commentary your gameplay everything was</p>
<p>great and there was nothing too much</p>
<p>wrong with it just minor things you can</p>
<p>improve on and now on to vile self there</p>
<p>was not much that I could critique on</p>
<p>vile self either because honestly I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t expect the quality of the people</p>
<p>that are gonna be entering this</p>
<p>competition to be so high this is a</p>
<p>pretty high - commentator right here</p>
<p>guys he it did a very very good job you</p>
<p>had a very good gameplay going on there</p>
<p>there was a lot of color in there I was</p>
<p>very good on the eyes you had a</p>
<p>commentary that was smooth there were a</p>
<p>little minor moments of where you would</p>
<p>have these little pause breaks here and</p>
<p>there I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s maybe the</p>
<p>way that you do your style because when</p>
<p>I was listening to the whole 7 minutes</p>
<p>which for me is a little bit long but I</p>
<p>enjoyed the commentary so I stayed a</p>
<p>little bit longer to hear the whole</p>
<p>story</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s your style</p>
<p>where you say your lines you pause a</p>
<p>little bit continue on with your story</p>
<p>and things like that I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your style but if it is then you</p>
<p>can keep it that way</p>
<p>for me personally I&rsquo;m not a big fan of</p>
<p>the whole space in-between every single</p>
<p>thing but if that&rsquo;s your thing continue</p>
<p>doing what you&rsquo;re doing cuz it does</p>
<p>sound good for me I just can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>stand having the breaks in between I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>more of a cut calm style kind of guy but</p>
<p>either way it was a good commentary</p>
<p>nonetheless you didn&rsquo;t stutter or</p>
<p>anything like that</p>
<p>so for this round I&rsquo;m gonna have to give</p>
<p>the win to vile self</p>
<p>now unfortunately JD and Phantom never</p>
<p>uploaded a first round video they had</p>
<p>two weeks to do this and either one of</p>
<p>them could have put a video up and could</p>
<p>have went to the next round however</p>
<p>neither of them did it</p>
<p>so swarn is going to be getting a</p>
<p>freebie to round 3 because no one is</p>
<p>there to compete with them so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be going on to round 3 sworn</p>
<p>congratulations you didn&rsquo;t really have</p>
<p>to do too much but if you guys do want</p>
<p>to go and check out his video there will</p>
<p>be a link down in the description below</p>
<p>so congratulations to all the winners of</p>
<p>this round and all of you guys are</p>
<p>obviously gonna be going to round 3 but</p>
<p>now the question is what is the topic</p>
<p>for round 3 so I&rsquo;ve been thinking about</p>
<p>this I don&rsquo;t want it to be too difficult</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it to be random like cake</p>
<p>now cake was a good topic nonetheless</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want it to be too difficult</p>
<p>I want this round to be something more</p>
<p>genuine something that&rsquo;s coming straight</p>
<p>out of the heart the brain the soul</p>
<p>everything like that I want it to be</p>
<p>something as if I walked up to you where</p>
<p>anybody walked up to you asked you this</p>
<p>question and you knew right away that is</p>
<p>the answer something that would just</p>
<p>come to you immediately something you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even have to think about it just</p>
<p>happens in a heartbeat you just know</p>
<p>what to say when this question comes up</p>
<p>and that question is going to be what</p>
<p>makes you different than everybody else</p>
<p>in this gaming community everybody else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a commentator that does gameplay</p>
<p>videos like you what makes you so</p>
<p>special</p>
<p>that makes you completely different from</p>
<p>everyone else that they should come over</p>
<p>to your channel and subscribe to you</p>
<p>good luck to everyone</p>
<p>around 3:00 hopefully you guys pull off</p>
<p>this question here and hopefully I hear</p>
<p>some really good answers because this</p>
<p>should be genuine this should be</p>
<p>something that you are fighting for in</p>
<p>this tournament doesn&rsquo;t matter about the</p>
<p>$50.00 doesn&rsquo;t matter about winning in</p>
<p>first place this is something that you</p>
<p>are speaking to your whole You Tube</p>
