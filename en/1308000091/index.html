    <p>Next up is Mara Hershenson who&rsquo;s going to talk about entrepreneurship. Come on out Mara.</p>
<p>Mara is going to talk about creating successful founders. Please welcome Mara.</p>
<p>Well, I have a pretty positive and optimistic talk.</p>
<p>I know the mood may be a little bearish in general. My name is Mara. I&rsquo;m one of the founders of Pear VC.</p>
<p>And I am very fortunate. I actually work with many startups. I&rsquo;ve worked for the last decade</p>
<p>with 100 plus startups. They&rsquo;re worth over 100 billion dollars and they all have one thing in</p>
<p>common. When I invest, there&rsquo;s actually nothing. I&rsquo;m the first check. There is no product. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no customers. There&rsquo;s just the founders. So it is no surprise that I often wonder, are these founders</p>
<p>born? Are my cards dealt as soon as I invest in one of these founders? Or is there anything</p>
<p>I can do to change them? That&rsquo;s a big question. And I think many of you would say founders are born.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Palmer Luckey. He&rsquo;s talking tomorrow. He was a prodigy. He created the first</p>
<p>prototype of the Oculus Rift at 17 and he sold the company to Facebook at 22. Clearly, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something special about him. Or Melanie Perkins. She started her first business at 14, then at 19</p>
<p>went on to build the largest yearbook business in Australia. And now she runs one of the most</p>
<p>successful startups. And then Elon Musk. I don&rsquo;t think I need to say anything. He&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>someone special. Something in his DNA, right? So you wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Many people ask me what</p>
<p>makes a good founder. And there&rsquo;s a bunch of characteristics. You can Google it. People come</p>
<p>up with a bunch of things like risk-taking, resilience, ambition, etc. And in fact, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some research by academia that shows that people have some innate properties. So researchers at</p>
<p>Northeastern surveyed hundreds of entrepreneurs and they counted that 42% of them had started a</p>
<p>business as a kid. So actually, that&rsquo;s a good hint for anybody making angel investments. Maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a question you can ask. Now, there&rsquo;s also data that shows that founders can be made. And while</p>
<p>there are 37% of founders, the repeat founders in companies today, 59% repeat founders are in</p>
<p>the top unicorns. So that means at least you learned something from your first experience.</p>
<p>So it would be reasonable to believe that there is some relationship about what&rsquo;s your chances of</p>
<p>being successful to how you&rsquo;re born. However, I do believe there&rsquo;s some form, something you can do,</p>
<p>right? There&rsquo;s some energy or some modification that would put you up in that chart. And I think</p>
<p>the wider arrow shows that the early parts of that chart, you need a lot of effort. And in fact,</p>
<p>this is what I&rsquo;ve learned from being an investor. Roughly, and these are all rough numbers,</p>
<p>out of the 10 companies we back, two will fail no matter what we do. That&rsquo;s just almost their</p>
<p>destiny. And Jason wrote a blog post in 2015, so that&rsquo;s a long time ago, that&rsquo;s titled,</p>
<p>You Don&rsquo;t Have What It Takes. I recommend you reading it. And basically, the summary is,</p>
<p>some people just don&rsquo;t have what it takes. It would take so much effort to change them</p>
<p>that you might as well give up, right? Okay, so now out of 10 companies we back,</p>
<p>two will succeed no matter what. Us people in venture like to take credit.</p>
<p>But truly, the founders, there&rsquo;s a percentage of founders that work independently of us. We back</p>
<p>DoorDash early on, there&rsquo;s a picture of their founders. And I can tell you that Tony Hsu,</p>
<p>the CEO, would have made it with or without any of his investors. And then there are six companies</p>
<p>that I think we can influence, okay? There&rsquo;s something we can do. And the question is,</p>
<p>perhaps, what can you do with that 60%? How can you make them more successful? Or maybe better,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re at the top 10%, can you accelerate their success? That&rsquo;s a big question. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m really passionate about. Can you create more successful entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>And why is it important? Why should you care? I think this is the right audience. You don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to say. There are many numbers to show that having more entrepreneurs is good for the economy.</p>
<p>You can read them. But just more entrepreneurs means a better world. So the question is,</p>
<p>how can you build these entrepreneurs? Is there a magic machine where you can actually</p>
<p>take a regular founder or a regular person and out comes a successful founder?</p>
<p>Okay. So at the risk of being elitist, I am going to say that one of the closest machines</p>
<p>of entrepreneurship is Stanford University. And the numbers actually show it. 10% of unicorns</p>
<p>have founders that attend at Stanford. And what&rsquo;s even more, in the All In Summit,</p>
<p>I actually went through all the LinkedIn&rsquo;s, 40% of the speakers attend at Stanford. And I think</p>
<p>all of us have started something, whether it&rsquo;s 538, like Nate, or a venture firm, or a company,</p>
<p>or multiple companies. So there&rsquo;s some special gene. And the question is, what does Stanford</p>
<p>have that other people don&rsquo;t have? It&rsquo;s a higher ed institution. So for sure, you&rsquo;re going to go</p>
<p>and take some classes, gain some skill sets. They put you around people that are like you,</p>
<p>and they have a brand. So you have access to capital, network, et cetera. Having been there,</p>
<p>though, I will tell you that the skill set doesn&rsquo;t quite matter as much. You can go online</p>
<p>and learn some of that. But your peers around you, and the next degree around you, actually</p>
<p>really, really matter. And in a way, what these people are doing is transforming your character.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that firsthand. Just imagine yourself, you may be a founder or an investor,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. You are dropped in a world where you basically are surrounded by people</p>
<p>that are constantly thinking about starting new companies. These are smart people. The ambition</p>
<p>is very, very high. There&rsquo;s innovation almost breathing everywhere. And nerding out is very okay,</p>
<p>right? So by doing this throughout years, you actually become one of them.</p>
<p>And your peers are really fundamentally changing your character. You become somebody</p>
<p>that starts to believe in themselves. You can do it. You learn basically to expand your own</p>
<p>ambition, right? You may think 100 million exit is good, but if you go to Stanford, you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good enough, right? So you&rsquo;re setting your own bar. It&rsquo;s a really interesting process.</p>
<p>And the question is, are there other machines like this? Or is Stanford just the only way to do it?</p>
<p>But the good news is there are other places that do this, or there are other forms of doing this,</p>
<p>I would say. And one of them, perhaps, is the PayPal mafia. I see a lot of them running around</p>
<p>here in the next couple of days. You all know that they started many successful companies, Tesla,</p>
<p>LinkedIn, Palantir, Affirm, YouTube, Yelp, Yammer, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something magic about having been there at that point in time. I haven&rsquo;t researched them,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have that much direct contact. But according to Sarah Lacy, who&rsquo;s a journalist,</p>
<p>and she spent a lot of time researching them, she concluded there was the confidence that they</p>
<p>gained when they were there. Now, I&rsquo;m not sure, but maybe in the Q&amp;A, they will reveal the secret.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other mafias. This one I&rsquo;m more familiar with. This is Rappi. Rappi is a company that was</p>
<p>founded in 2015, so not that long ago, in Colombia. And it really transformed the LATAM startup</p>
<p>environment. There&rsquo;s been 100-plus companies created by Rappi employees. It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Almost 50 in Colombia. It literally changed the country, which is a big deal. I have the privilege</p>
<p>of working with a few of these founders, and there&rsquo;s something common in them. They all have</p>
<p>this sense of ambition, that super-fast growth. It&rsquo;s really interesting how they&rsquo;re almost cut</p>
<p>from the same cloth. So there are other places. And I think we had the mayor here earlier.</p>
<p>I guess he would claim that Miami&rsquo;s on its way to doing some of that. So there are places.</p>
<p>So I want to tell you about a couple of experiments that are personal to me,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been running, and hopefully will inspire you to do something on your own. Okay.</p>
<p>The first one is, I teach a class at Stanford. It&rsquo;s a startup simulation class.</p>
<p>You have to, for one sec, forget it&rsquo;s at Stanford. I&rsquo;m actually taking it to other colleges as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your usual class, okay? So it&rsquo;s actually not your usual class in the sense that</p>
<p>I never lecture. There is no lectures for me. There&rsquo;s almost no communication from me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been teaching this class for six years. We will take eight teams. These teams have four</p>
<p>to five people. And you cannot have a startup when you come to this class. In fact, you must be</p>
<p>way earlier. You only have an idea, or you may have a couple of ideas. But if you have something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been working on for a while, you&rsquo;re automatically disqualified, okay? So everybody</p>
<p>that comes in knows very, very little. And then what the class is designed to do is to just maximize</p>
<p>your peers&rsquo; interaction. Because I believe that that&rsquo;s the way that you can create founders.</p>
<p>So how do we do that? First, we&rsquo;re very lucky that I can actually craft the class. So even within</p>
<p>Stanford, you have to get admitted to this class. There&rsquo;s only 20 percent acceptance. So I&rsquo;m able to</p>
<p>figure out who do we want to get in. And then the trick is to force each of the teams to present</p>
<p>to each other every week. And I know it sounds really simple, but just by doing that, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually motivating and teaching by example. And the results are pretty incredible. We actually have</p>
<p>one to three companies per year that get started. I think we have two unicorns. There&rsquo;s 600 million</p>
<p>capital raised. And I think what&rsquo;s really, really interesting is that every year I&rsquo;ll get some</p>
<p>pretty nerdy PhD student that goes off to be a successful founder. So it&rsquo;s very impressive.</p>
<p>And this one, which is really interesting, when I first started, 20 percent of the kids were females.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I bet we can shape the class. So throughout the years, we&rsquo;ve been increasing</p>
<p>female enrollment. And I can tell you that the results have not changed. We actually now have</p>
<p>more female-founded companies. And this is actually something I care about. Thank you.</p>
<p>OK, so this takes me to my second experiment, which is actually even more successful and has</p>
<p>nothing to do with Stanford. OK, so there&rsquo;s no Stanford involved. OK, so about a year ago,</p>
<p>a year and a half ago, I decided, let&rsquo;s get a group of women together artificially. And again,</p>
<p>the same idea. These women cannot be founders. OK, these are women that are just high potential.</p>
<p>OK, and we actually have 30 to 40 women per cohort. We&rsquo;ve done it twice. And the goal is like,</p>
<p>hey, can we teach them about being a founder, increase their confidence and ambition,</p>
<p>their risk-taking, et cetera, et cetera. So how do we do it? Same thing. The first thing is we</p>
<p>inspire them with great leaders. So we would bring women that are successful in their own right</p>
<p>to tell them that it is possible to be like them, right? I think in many occasions, we just lack</p>
<p>that role model. And the next is we force them to connect with each other. So sometimes it&rsquo;s talks,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s fun events or dinners. We even had a manicure, pedicure session.</p>
<p>The point is that can you get them to talk to each other? And the results are literally insane.</p>
<p>So we had 78 women through the process. I think they&rsquo;ve incorporated 45-plus companies. 35 of</p>
<p>them have raised more than a million dollars. And they&rsquo;re backed by people like Sequoia,</p>
<p>Andreessen, Paradigm, Dragonfly, and of course, Pear. So I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible numbers. These</p>
<p>are not regular numbers that you would see in a random group of people. And I think, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important because I think we have something to say about what the next generation looks,</p>
<p>right? I mean, for all of us in the audience, 2% of all companies have an all-female founder team.</p>
<p>That is very crazy, if you can do the numbers. So I think perhaps Richard Branson said it better.</p>
<p>Everyone is born an entrepreneur, and everyone has the potential to learn to be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that not everyone gets the opportunity, right? So I think my quest is about making those</p>
<p>opportunities. And I will say that you as an individual have your first responsibility about</p>
<p>doing that, right? You have to create opportunities for yourself. And I would say the most important</p>
<p>is to surround yourself by the best people. So you have to play up and challenge yourself.</p>
<p>And sometimes, people don&rsquo;t go to places that have the best people because they have the worst</p>
<p>job at the company, and that&rsquo;s the wrong attitude. You should go to wherever the best people are so</p>
<p>you can learn, you know, transform yourself. I have two very practical pieces of advice that I</p>
<p>give my founders. First, this is very simple, but you can actually read. You can read a lot.</p>
<p>One of my founders, Asa Drew, who&rsquo;s the founder of Dropbox, how he became a great CEO, and he said,</p>
<p>I read a lot. But then I have actually gone and looked at our top 10% of our portfolio,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s one thing those CEOs have in common. They are reading machines. So I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>reading will make you a great CEO, but I know it won&rsquo;t hurt you. So, and the second one is</p>
<p>get a coach. I say even Steve Jobs had a coach. If you don&rsquo;t have money to get a coach, get a peer</p>
<p>group, because again, it&rsquo;s about character building. And I think what investors can do,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re an investor in the room, I know it&rsquo;s a very ego high business, but it is not about us.</p>
<p>You know, we are not the ones who make the companies. I think our role is to have,</p>
<p>create opportunities for our founders to grow, and that actually will help the portfolio.</p>
<p>And I think for society, perhaps we should have an early intervention program, much like a gifted</p>
<p>program in schools. If you detect that there are kids that have that gene in them, why not</p>
<p>pull them aside and create an early intervention program? And I&rsquo;ll give you an analogy, which you</p>
<p>will understand. I&rsquo;m from Barcelona, Spain. My fellow countrywoman is Montserrat Caball√©. She</p>
<p>was a great opera singer. And of course, today, probably I&rsquo;m too old to become a great opera</p>
<p>singer, but perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t, I would have had some chance, right? Maybe to just sing opera in</p>
<p>the bathroom at some point, if I had been taught early on. So that&rsquo;s the thought. And, you know,</p>
<p>just imagine a world where you can actually increase the total founder potential by just 10%,</p>
<p>or even shape who becomes to be a founder. So with that, I guess I&rsquo;ll go to the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Wow. Awesome. Thank you.</p>
<p>In the middle. You&rsquo;re in the middle. That&rsquo;s amazing. What a great talk. That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>This is very intimidating. I know, but somehow the four of us are going to get through it.</p>
<p>It was an incredible talk. Somehow. God, you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>I have to say, you know, we&rsquo;re watching the talk backstage and the nodding that we were each having</p>
<p>and, you know, collectively we&rsquo;ve invested in, you know, I would say closer to a thousand companies</p>
<p>now and we&rsquo;re nodding and thank you for putting my blog post up there from years ago. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have what it takes. And I just realized, you know, wow. One of the fundamental problems we have,</p>
<p>and I think having David here from the PayPal mafia speaks volumes. One of the fundamental</p>
<p>problems in entrepreneurship is that you pointed out is people have to see it in order to be it.</p>
<p>And, you know, when you look at what happened at PayPal, and I&rsquo;m really interested in hearing</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s perspective on this, they got to see each other at Stanford and 40% of the speakers have</p>
<p>been to Stanford here at this event. I didn&rsquo;t even know that. Thank you for doing that statistic.</p>
<p>But it seems like the fundamental problem we have in society, you can expand this. And then we were</p>
<p>talking about how the mayor being on. Are you getting to a question? Yeah. But this is the</p>
<p>fundamental problem. We need people to understand that entrepreneurship and opportunity in this</p>
<p>country is available to 100% of the people here. They have that opportunity, but because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see someone like themselves, a woman, a person of color, a person of a woman who is a person of</p>
<p>color, etc, etc, etc. They need to see it to be it. That&rsquo;s the problem, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Well, you summarized it really well. And I asked you to do the talk next time.</p>
<p>Well, I listened. Yes.</p>
<p>When you when you started this program, what was your goal? What did you think was going to happen?</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to be I didn&rsquo;t think that conclusion was going to be as</p>
<p>as big, right? I mean, if you get 20% of women to start a business,</p>
<p>that would have been amazing. But we&rsquo;re getting almost, I would say, 60% of them or 70% of them</p>
<p>are going off and starting a business. It&rsquo;s crazy. I mean, when you take both of those two</p>
<p>programs together, the the results are pretty crazy. They&rsquo;re pretty crazy. Yes.</p>
<p>So, okay, take it out of the Stanford context for a second.</p>
<p>How do people I&rsquo;ll pick a city, you know, you&rsquo;re in Cincinnati. What does it mean to have a peer</p>
<p>group and a network that can create or catalyze like a PayPal like mafia there or even if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in Miami or in LA or wherever you are? That seems like a really hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really hard problem. So luckily, I&rsquo;m young enough that I&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>iterate. But Zoom may make that a little bit easier, too, right?</p>
<p>I think you need that, you know, it&rsquo;s not just enough to get a bunch of people together,</p>
<p>right? You have to see it the right way. So that&rsquo;s why I said, you know, even for the female program,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get hundreds of applications and we have to go and interview everybody and see who can</p>
<p>have high potential, right? So again, there&rsquo;s a little bit on the choosing of who goes into that</p>
<p>program and then you can shape them. So again, it&rsquo;s that curve. If you are too far to the left,</p>
<p>if you are too far to the left, then your job is really, really high.</p>
<p>I used to probably once a week, read Business Insider or Insider. And then I stopped about</p>
<p>seven months ago, or no, maybe like in the last few months. And I&rsquo;ll tell you why I stopped. It</p>
<p>was for two reasons. There was this article that they kept running, basically bashing the founder</p>
<p>of Glossier. And to me, it just didn&rsquo;t make any sense. Because it&rsquo;s like, there are lots of people</p>
<p>who, you know, go through trials and tribulations at startups. And when you read about her journey,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem particularly different than anybody else. You try products, some of them work, some</p>
<p>of them fail, you learn and you move on. But they would run it. And they were just hammering,</p>
<p>hammering, hammering. They did it with the away founder too. Away luggage thing,</p>
<p>which was the craziest story. Unbelievable. I read that story. I was like, what did she do wrong? I</p>
<p>never really understood. Everybody work harder. Yeah, she was like, work harder. Let&rsquo;s make this</p>
<p>company. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think. Can I give you more equity? Yeah, well, I think honestly,</p>
<p>that happens even to me. I mean, I&rsquo;m board meetings. I look, you know, I&rsquo;m not an asshole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bitch, right? That&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the summary of the situation. Welcome to the club. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>assholes. I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m a bitch. Yeah. That&rsquo;s why I stopped reading it. Because I was like,</p>
<p>this is really ridiculous. Because what is it telling people? And then separately,</p>
<p>they kept running this ad promoting this company called cerebral, which last week got a DOJ</p>
<p>subpoena for selling Adderall illegally to people. And so it&rsquo;s like, this is the imbalance that you</p>
<p>see when things are presented, that don&rsquo;t really make a lot of sense. There is a term for in the</p>
<p>industry. I didn&rsquo;t come up with the term chicks for clicks. And so they will look for a female</p>
<p>founder and no chicks for clicks, chicks for clicks, as in a worm for a word for females,</p>
<p>chicks for clicks. They&rsquo;re all trying to get clicks. If you go after a female founder,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get 10 times as many clicks. Oh, really? Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>The Theranos story, I think, like, was such a great example of that. It was like a failed</p>
<p>biotech company. I&rsquo;m not saying that there wasn&rsquo;t fraud and stuff that happened there.</p>
<p>But man, I mean, the way that that that escalated the storyline. Yeah, it was well,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a founder plus a female founder, you know, a founder misbehaving, quote, unquote,</p>
<p>plus a female founder just equals a little more. Even the wife of the founder of WeWork</p>
<p>is more famous in some circles. She seemed more talented. I&rsquo;m curious what your questions are</p>
<p>for David about the magical moment of the PayPal mafia. Yeah, what was the what was the secret sauce</p>
<p>like being the 17th most important guy at PayPal? He&rsquo;s now the ninth. He was clearly the fifth or</p>
<p>you tried that joke already. It didn&rsquo;t work. Don&rsquo;t try. Don&rsquo;t try and resuscitate it now.</p>
<p>You had your chance. That was brutal. I know. No, no. I apologize to the entire fan base for</p>
<p>intros. Come on. Look, I&rsquo;ll tell you something. Every guy on the stage. No one will ever tell</p>
<p>them what I said because everyone works for him or wants money from him. So we can only do it to</p>
<p>each other. We can only do it to each other. All right. So the answer is that at PayPal,</p>
<p>we recruited our friends to work at the company because literally nobody else like was willing</p>
<p>to come work at this crazy startup. Peter recruited his friends who he had gone to</p>
<p>college with at Stanford. Max recruited his friends from U of I. That&rsquo;s how the initial</p>
<p>team was recruited is through friendship networks. But it wasn&rsquo;t like this was some exclusive club.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that nobody else wanted to be a member. And well, sorry, can I just say at Facebook early</p>
<p>days, it was exactly like that as well. It&rsquo;s like we had like really qualified people from great</p>
<p>schools, but it would not be the people that you would have thought. It&rsquo;s like the folks that like</p>
<p>spun out of Microsoft, you know, couldn&rsquo;t succeed. And all of a sudden we were like, oh, or like</p>
<p>Boz used to teach Zuck CS. And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, why don&rsquo;t you just come in as like the T.A. of</p>
<p>the class? It was not. It was very ragtag. Did the trust make everyone because they all knew</p>
<p>each other from before? Did the trust give everyone like a stronger sense of like being</p>
<p>vulnerable and developing themselves better? Because I do see like a lot of horrible. Well,</p>
<p>I mean, I see a lot of these companies and everyone&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all like it&rsquo;s like you see</p>
<p>early stage companies and it&rsquo;s very political. Who&rsquo;s going to last is not because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really trust each other. You never work together. Well, I know each other. Yeah. What I&rsquo;d say is</p>
<p>that you would think that the friendships would would make it like this sort of calm,</p>
<p>friendly environment. PayPal was actually a very frictional, contentious environment. And</p>
<p>but I do think there is a trust element to it, which is we were constantly debating what the</p>
<p>truth was and what we needed to do and what the big risks to the business were. And so we were</p>
<p>yelling. In fact, Peter, when he hired me, he told some of the other people on the team, look,</p>
<p>I want to hire David because I need someone here who I can yell at. Meaning like he didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about hurting my feelings. He could just say what he really thought and we could have an</p>
<p>open conversation about what we need to do as a company, even if it meant yelling. So was it a</p>
<p>culture of brutal honesty? Yes, absolutely. That&rsquo;s what Vinod talks about a lot, right? Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I can ask you guys a question more? David, you use Rappi. So the last time I was here in</p>
<p>Miami was to meet the Rappi founders. And I spent a couple of days with them and I came away stunned,</p>
<p>kind of like what you said. I didn&rsquo;t realize it was that extensive,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a really special culture there. Yes. PayPal obviously had that as well. But do you</p>
<p>guys and don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way, but do you have to have somewhat more of a bounded</p>
<p>outcome for then these networks to really explode? Meaning if you look at a Google or a Facebook</p>
<p>or even a Microsoft, when companies become almost too successful, it almost just locks these folks</p>
<p>in. And the incentive to go off with that toolkit, the peer network goes to zero because you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>too incentivized. That&rsquo;s an evolutionary trait, right? Or people make so much money that they</p>
<p>just retire. I think you&rsquo;re totally right. The companies that they come from have to be a little</p>
<p>hard. I don&rsquo;t think PayPal was easy, right? No, super hard. Yeah. And when it&rsquo;s hard, you learn</p>
<p>to be, you know, to overcome hard things. And the whole company learns if there&rsquo;s brutal honesty,</p>
<p>right? If it&rsquo;s hidden at the top and you think it&rsquo;s all right, nobody learns. But if you do,</p>
<p>you do. And actually, I think the rate of success of people that came out of founder of Google,</p>
<p>relatively speaking, is not that high. Not that high. It&rsquo;s not that high because everything works.</p>
<p>And everything is easy. No offense, Freeberg. Everything is easy.</p>
<p>But no, Freeberg, you run. Sorry. But you&rsquo;re saying the Google people more, to be clear,</p>
<p>got very soft. Because it was too easy. They never learned. They never learned anything.</p>
<p>I can overcome quinoa. This is actually interesting. There are more</p>
<p>unicorns founded by ex-PayPal people than ex-Google people, even though at sort of the PayPal mafia,</p>
<p>if you define it as the pre-IPO group of people who worked at PayPal, there were only a couple</p>
<p>of hundred in the Bay Area, whereas Google had like 10,000. So my theory on this, having observed</p>
<p>it, the early days of Google, the organization grew. The success of the company was exponential,</p>
<p>out of the fucking gate. I mean, like more than most companies we talk about nowadays.</p>
<p>And as a result, all of the success was baked in. The monopoly machine started rolling right away.</p>
<p>So then the hires started being safer hires, people that could be more analytical, people</p>
<p>that could be more execution-oriented, not risk-takers. And so a lot of people were hired.</p>
<p>And forgive, I went to Cal, but forgive me for saying, but all the Stanford people who basically</p>
<p>had always done really well on their SATs, got great grades, they&rsquo;d always been successful. They&rsquo;d</p>
<p>always kind of been given that thumbs up, you&rsquo;re awesome, you&rsquo;re smart, come here and do this job.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t the risk-takers. They weren&rsquo;t the people who were willing to take risk to fail.</p>
<p>And so the orientation was build a culture of people that just didn&rsquo;t take a lot of risk,</p>
<p>executed. And then those people, they had this false sense of entrepreneurial success by working</p>
<p>at Google, because they were already on a rocket ship. Then a bunch of them left and tried to start</p>
<p>companies. And they&rsquo;re like, oh, yeah, you just build an app and 100 million people use it. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, dude, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure. Oh, and by the way,</p>
<p>if you make it to 87 failures, then you&rsquo;ll have your moment of success. And none of them make it</p>
<p>past 0.30, right? And so I think my observation was so many Google people I knew that left and</p>
<p>started companies, they either weren&rsquo;t risk-takers, or they didn&rsquo;t have the grit and persistence</p>
<p>needed to go through the failure to get there. And it was because that culture was defined by</p>
<p>early success. And then everyone that joined was just execution operations oriented.</p>
<p>100%. Yeah.</p>
<p>You mentioned something. Maybe you can just speak a little bit more about it. But we used to do</p>
<p>these things, which you talked about, where every week you would force people basically to present.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re almost doing, and I think what we learned was, you&rsquo;re desensitizing people to</p>
<p>failure itself. And it just becomes a nothing burger, because you&rsquo;re just seeing this litany</p>
<p>of just randomly bad ideas almost. But that&rsquo;s what becomes so powerful, because then these</p>
<p>random little things just become enormous. They shape you.</p>
<p>They shape you. And you get very, very lucky. I remember when at Facebook, I created this thing</p>
<p>called Growth Circle. We used to run thousands of experiments a week, and we used to have folks</p>
<p>present every week. And it was just three hours of monotonous failure, right? It was just after</p>
<p>another, after another. But I think what it really did was allow people to feel okay trying</p>
<p>the crazy idea. Yeah.</p>
<p>Because they would see the 15 people in front of them would do it.</p>
<p>Totally. So was that the key?</p>
<p>That is the key. That is actually the key. And actually, it makes a huge difference, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you hear every&hellip; And they also inspire you. Whoever is actually doing great, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be the last person the next week when I have to present. I want to be better than</p>
<p>the person that presented last week and did great. So it motivates you.</p>
<p>But how do you get people that are those high SAT, overachiever types to be okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to put them in a position. So I&rsquo;ll tell you one, for example, in the class,</p>
<p>one exercise you can tell people towards the end. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re all having some startup,</p>
<p>or have some users, or whatever. They don&rsquo;t have a startup. They have a project. I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>okay, your homework for next week is to 10x your sales. You have one week to do it.</p>
<p>People get really, really creative when you actually tell them that. And</p>
<p>maybe they don&rsquo;t get to 10, but they&rsquo;ll get to two or three in a week.</p>
<p>And I think that inspiration is enough for people to make the best of themselves. I think</p>
<p>great leaders do that, right? They ask for more than you think you&rsquo;re capable, people are capable.</p>
<p>What about learning failure? We were talking about this</p>
<p>on the yesterday. We were having a conversation about how do we make sure that our kids grow up</p>
<p>and learn failure like we all learned? And failure, ultimately, I think, and persistent failure,</p>
<p>I think really taught me a lot about putting up with failure, knowing that as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the right thing, you&rsquo;ll get there probabilistically. How do you teach that?</p>
<p>Because folks, especially in an environment where they&rsquo;ve always been successful,</p>
<p>and how do you keep them from saying, you know what, I don&rsquo;t want to fail, I want to succeed</p>
<p>because my orientation is to succeed. So when they start to fail, they run and they go do something</p>
<p>easy, which they can&rsquo;t do. Totally. And actually at Stanford specifically, right? Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>If you made it to Stanford as an undergrad. Not to keep asking Stanford, but yeah.</p>
<p>No, yeah. I&rsquo;m just, I went to California. But you are very, I mean, you&rsquo;ve been an incredible</p>
<p>student. I mean, you probably cured cancer or something if you had to, if you got into Stanford</p>
<p>today, right? So they&rsquo;ve never really failed at life. This is an 18 year old that has never</p>
<p>suffered failure, at least as we understand it. You have to put them, you have to learn each of</p>
<p>the students, what is their weak point and make them actually do that, right? So one of the things</p>
<p>I will do- To reduce failure.</p>
<p>Yeah. You provoke failure as quickly as you can. So if you&rsquo;re a typical computer science student,</p>
<p>you probably can create an app. Well, these days within an hour, you&rsquo;ll have something great,</p>
<p>right? Try to get a thousand users without spending a single dollar.</p>
<p>Let them fail.</p>
<p>Can you do it? It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Yeah. And then do it again.</p>
<p>And some of them, the mental health problem is very high, right? I think a lot of these people,</p>
<p>the first time they fail, they can&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>Let me ask you one more because my, I&rsquo;m sorry, Jacob, but my big three predictors of entrepreneurial</p>
<p>success are grit, persisting through failure, bias to action, like you don&rsquo;t have an orientation</p>
<p>to being analytical, you have an orientation to taking action, and a narrative. Because I think</p>
<p>that the greatest entrepreneurs that we all know, Elon&rsquo;s obviously the penultimate example.</p>
<p>Someone told me I used that word wrong, so I won&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Penultimate means second.</p>
<p>Ultimate is what you&rsquo;re going for.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re wrong on that, but I&rsquo;ll accept it.</p>
<p>It may be the quinoa getting to your brain. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You may want some protein.</p>
<p>He had the ultimate definition, you had the penultimate definition.</p>
<p>More like mink steaks. So how does narrative get learned? Because we&rsquo;ve seen that the best</p>
<p>entrepreneurs are incredible storytellers. They tell the story and they tell the vision before</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s built as a way of attracting the best talent, and then as a way of attracting the capital,</p>
<p>and then as a way of attracting customers. And that ability is key to success. And how do you</p>
<p>actually, is there a way to develop narrative?</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s actually really important. And I&rsquo;m going to even elevate it one more.</p>
<p>Sales. You have to be a great salesperson. Your narrative, you&rsquo;re selling the story of</p>
<p>your company, but you may be selling to an employee, to an investor, whatever. You need</p>
<p>to be a great salesperson. Unfortunately, teaching sales at a higher educational institution is</p>
<p>considered dirty work, so we don&rsquo;t even teach it, right? But it&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>So I run a little accelerator and we, just like Jason, and we spend the last few weeks just</p>
<p>teaching people how to talk. How do you explain what you do? And I tell people there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>like practice. You have to practice, practice, get coached, et cetera. Some people are born with</p>
<p>that. Some people you actually have to learn. You think it is learned though?</p>
<p>It is. Well, you can definitely get better, right? If not, the world would be a better,</p>
<p>a sad place. Mara, as we wrap here,</p>
<p>we have 10 daughters between the four of us. I love that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Three, two, two, three.</p>
<p>Whatever. You can remind David of the names of his daughters. They&rsquo;re on your watch. I&rsquo;ll look</p>
<p>them up. Mara, what can you- He&rsquo;s got a little card in here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank- My wife&rsquo;s name is-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a picture, little picture. Mara, what have you learned about</p>
<p>women in terms of entrepreneurship? What do we need to know about encouraging them</p>
<p>to become entrepreneurs and to create companies? I think the most important is</p>
<p>for women to believe in themselves. I think a lot of us don&rsquo;t. I think you Google imposter syndrome,</p>
<p>and we all have it. Even myself coming here today, I was probably the person that practiced the most</p>
<p>because I have that imposter syndrome. That is the most important. You have to overcome that</p>
<p>because for most men, it comes naturally. Us, we have to work a little harder to do that,</p>
<p>but with confidence, we make amazing founders, I would say. I am fortunate to work with many of</p>
<p>them. This year, our accelerator, this session we present on Wednesday, we&rsquo;ll have two-thirds</p>
<p>of the founders are women. That&rsquo;s very impressive. They&rsquo;re amazing. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>cutting corners. We&rsquo;re the best people. We as a society have to do a better job of-</p>
<p>Stop clicking on those clicks, chicks for clicks. Exactly.</p>
<p>Stop clicking. I think maybe them seeing more role models like you. I think very specifically,</p>
<p>we as all girl dads appreciate the work you&rsquo;re doing. Thank you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give it up for Mark.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
