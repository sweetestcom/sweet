    <p>The following is a conversation with Peter Wang,</p>
<p>one of the most impactful leaders and developers</p>
<p>in the Python community.</p>
<p>Former physicist, current philosopher,</p>
<p>and someone who many people told me about</p>
<p>and praised as a truly special mind</p>
<p>that I absolutely should talk to.</p>
<p>Recommendations ranging from Travis Hallifont</p>
<p>to Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>So, here we are.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Peter Wang.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the most impactful humans</p>
<p>in the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re an engineer, leader of engineers,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also a philosopher.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s talk both in this conversation</p>
<p>about programming and philosophy.</p>
<p>First, programming.</p>
<p>What to you is the best</p>
<p>or maybe the most beautiful feature of Python?</p>
<p>Or maybe the thing that made you fall in love</p>
<p>or stay in love with Python?</p>
<p>Well, those are three different things.</p>
<p>What I think is the most beautiful,</p>
<p>what made me fall in love, what made me stay in love.</p>
<p>When I first started using it</p>
<p>was when I was a C++ computer graphics performance nerd.</p>
<p>In the 90s?</p>
<p>Yeah, in the late 90s.</p>
<p>And that was my first job out of college.</p>
<p>And we kept trying to do more and more abstract</p>
<p>and higher order programming in C++,</p>
<p>which at the time was quite difficult.</p>
<p>With templates, the compiler support wasn&rsquo;t great, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, when I started playing around with Python,</p>
<p>that was my first time encountering</p>
<p>really first class support for types, for functions,</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>And it felt so incredibly expressive.</p>
<p>So, that was what kind of made me fall in love</p>
<p>with it a little bit.</p>
<p>And also, once you spend a lot of time</p>
<p>in a C++ dev environment,</p>
<p>the ability to just whip something together</p>
<p>that basically runs and works the first time is amazing.</p>
<p>So, really productive scripting language.</p>
<p>I mean, I knew Perl, I knew Bash, I was decent at both.</p>
<p>But Python just made everything,</p>
<p>it made the whole world accessible.</p>
<p>I could script this and that and the other,</p>
<p>network things, little hard drive utilities.</p>
<p>I could write all of these things</p>
<p>in the space of an afternoon.</p>
<p>And that was really, really cool.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what made me fall in love.</p>
<p>Is there something specific you could put your finger on</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not programming in Perl today?</p>
<p>Like, why Python for scripting?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s not a specific thing</p>
<p>as much as the design motif of both the creator</p>
<p>of the language and the core group of people</p>
<p>that built the standard library around him.</p>
<p>There was definitely, there was a taste to it.</p>
<p>I mean, Steve Jobs used that term</p>
<p>in somewhat of an arrogant way,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a real thing,</p>
<p>that it was designed to fit.</p>
<p>A friend of mine actually expressed this really well.</p>
<p>He said, Python just fits in my head.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing better to say than that.</p>
<p>Now, people might argue modern Python,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more complexity,</p>
<p>but certainly as version 1.5.2,</p>
<p>I think was my first version,</p>
<p>that fit in my head very easily.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what made me fall in love with it.</p>
<p>Okay, so the most beautiful feature of Python</p>
<p>that made you stay in love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like over the years, what has like,</p>
<p>you do a double take and you return too often</p>
<p>as a thing that just brings you a smile.</p>
<p>I really still like the ability to play with meta classes</p>
<p>and express higher order of things.</p>
<p>When I have to create some new object model</p>
<p>to model something, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for me,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m pretty expert as a Python programmer.</p>
<p>I can easily put all sorts of lovely things together</p>
<p>and use properties and decorators and other kinds of things</p>
<p>and create something that feels very nice.</p>
<p>So, that to me, I would say that&rsquo;s tied</p>
<p>with the NumPy and vectorization capabilities.</p>
<p>I love thinking in terms of the matrices and the vectors</p>
<p>and these kind of data structures.</p>
<p>So, I would say those two are kind of tied for me.</p>
<p>So, the elegance of the NumPy data structure,</p>
<p>like slicing through the different multi dimensional.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s just enough things there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a very, it&rsquo;s a very simple, comfortable tool.</p>
<p>Just, it&rsquo;s easy to reason about what it does</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t stray too far afield.</p>
<p>Can you put your finger on how to design a language</p>
<p>such that it fits in your head?</p>
<p>Certain things like the colon</p>
<p>or the certain notation aspects of Python</p>
<p>that just kind of work.</p>
<p>Is it something you have to kind of write out on paper,</p>
<p>look and say, it&rsquo;s just right?</p>
<p>Is it a taste thing or is there a systematic process?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more of a taste thing.</p>
<p>But one thing that should be said</p>
<p>is that you have to pick your audience, right?</p>
<p>So, the better defined the user audience is</p>
<p>or the users are, the easier it is to build something</p>
<p>that fits in their minds because their needs</p>
<p>will be more compact and coherent.</p>
<p>It is possible to find a projection, right?</p>
<p>A compact projection for their needs.</p>
<p>The more diverse the user base, the harder that is.</p>
<p>And so, as Python has grown in popularity,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also naturally created more complexity</p>
<p>as people try to design any given thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be multiple valid opinions</p>
<p>about a particular design approach.</p>
<p>And so, I do think that&rsquo;s the downside of popularity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost an intrinsic aspect</p>
<p>of the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>Well, at the very beginning,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t you an audience of one, isn&rsquo;t ultimately,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t all the greatest projects in history</p>
<p>were just solving a problem that you yourself had?</p>
<p>Well, so Clay Shirky in his book on crowdsourcing</p>
<p>or his kind of thoughts on crowdsourcing,</p>
<p>he identifies the first step of crowdsourcing</p>
<p>is me first collaboration.</p>
<p>You first have to make something</p>
<p>that works well for yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very telling that when you look at all of the impactful</p>
<p>big project, well, they&rsquo;re fundamental projects now</p>
<p>in the SciPy and Pydata ecosystem.</p>
<p>They all started with the people in the domain</p>
<p>trying to scratch their own itch.</p>
<p>And the whole idea of scratching your own itch</p>
<p>is something that the open source</p>
<p>or the free software world has known for a long time.</p>
<p>But in the scientific computing areas,</p>
<p>these are assistant professors</p>
<p>or electrical engineering grad students.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have really a lot of programming skill</p>
<p>necessarily, but Python was just good enough</p>
<p>for them to put something together</p>
<p>that fit in their domain, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a necessity is the mother of invention aspect.</p>
<p>And also it was a really harsh filter</p>
<p>for utility and compactness and expressiveness.</p>
<p>Like it was too hard to use,</p>
<p>then they wouldn&rsquo;t have built it</p>
<p>because that was just too much trouble, right?</p>
<p>It was a side project for them.</p>
<p>And also necessity creates a kind of deadline.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of these projects</p>
<p>are quickly thrown together in the first step.</p>
<p>And that, even though it&rsquo;s flawed,</p>
<p>that just seems to work well for software projects.</p>
<p>Well, it does work well for software projects in general.</p>
<p>And in this particular space,</p>
<p>one of my colleagues, Stan Siebert identified this,</p>
<p>that all the projects in the SciPy ecosystem,</p>
<p>if we just rattle them off,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s NumPy, there&rsquo;s SciPy</p>
<p>built by different collaborations of people.</p>
<p>Although Travis is the heart of both of them.</p>
<p>But NumPy coming from numeric and numery,</p>
<p>these are different people.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got Pandas,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got Jupyter or IPython,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Matplotlib,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just so many others, I&rsquo;m not gonna do justice</p>
<p>if I try to name them all.</p>
<p>But all of them are actually different people.</p>
<p>And as they rolled out their projects,</p>
<p>the fact that they had limited resources</p>
<p>meant that they were humble about scope.</p>
<p>A great famous hacker, Jamie Zawisky,</p>
<p>once said that every geek&rsquo;s dream</p>
<p>is to build the ultimate middleware, right?</p>
<p>And the thing is with these scientists turned programmers,</p>
<p>they had no such dream.</p>
<p>They were just trying to write something</p>
<p>that was a little bit better for what they needed,</p>
<p>the MATLAB,</p>
<p>and they were gonna leverage what everyone else had built.</p>
<p>So naturally, almost in kind of this annealing process</p>
<p>or whatever, we built a very modular cover</p>
<p>of the basic needs of a scientific computing library.</p>
<p>If you look at the whole human story,</p>
<p>how much of a leap is it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve developed all kinds of languages,</p>
<p>all kinds of methodologies for communication.</p>
<p>It just kind of like grew this collective intelligence,</p>
<p>civilization grew, it expanded, wrote a bunch of books,</p>
<p>and now we tweet how big of a leap is programming</p>
<p>if programming is yet another language?</p>
<p>Is it just a nice little trick</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s temporary in our human history,</p>
<p>or is it like a big leap in the,</p>
<p>almost us becoming another organism</p>
<p>at a higher level of abstraction, something else?</p>
<p>I think the act of programming</p>
<p>or using grammatical constructions</p>
<p>of some underlying primitives,</p>
<p>that is something that humans do learn,</p>
<p>but every human learns this.</p>
<p>Anyone who can speak learns how to do this.</p>
<p>What makes programming different</p>
<p>has been that up to this point,</p>
<p>when we try to give instructions to computing systems,</p>
<p>all of our computers, well, actually this is not quite true,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll first say it,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll tell you why it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>But for the most part,</p>
<p>we can think of computers as being these iterated systems.</p>
<p>So when we program,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re giving very precise instructions to iterated systems</p>
<p>that then run at incomprehensible speed</p>
<p>and run those instructions.</p>
<p>In my experience,</p>
<p>some people are just better equipped</p>
<p>to model systematic iterated systems,</p>
<p>well, whatever, iterated systems in their head.</p>
<p>Some people are really good at that,</p>
<p>and other people are not.</p>
<p>And so when you have like, for instance,</p>
<p>sometimes people have tried to build systems</p>
<p>that make programming easier by making it visual,</p>
<p>drag and drop.</p>
<p>And the issue is you can have a drag and drop thing,</p>
<p>but once you start having to iterate the system</p>
<p>with conditional logic,</p>
<p>handling case statements and branch statements</p>
<p>and all these other things,</p>
<p>the visual drag and drop part doesn&rsquo;t save you anything.</p>
<p>You still have to reason about this giant iterated system</p>
<p>with all these different conditions around it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hard part, right?</p>
<p>So handling iterated logic, that&rsquo;s the hard part.</p>
<p>The languages we use then emerge</p>
<p>to give us the ability and capability over these things.</p>
<p>Now, the one exception to this rule, of course,</p>
<p>is the most popular programming system in the world,</p>
<p>which is Excel, which is a data flow</p>
<p>and a data driven, immediate mode,</p>
<p>data transformation oriented programming system.</p>
<p>And this actually not an accident</p>
<p>that that system is the most popular programming system</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so accessible</p>
<p>to a much broader group of people.</p>
<p>I do think as we build future computing systems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually already seeing this a little bit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more about composition of modular blocks.</p>
<p>They themselves actually maintain all their internal state</p>
<p>and the interfaces between them</p>
<p>are well defined data schemas.</p>
<p>And so to stitch these things together using like IFTTT</p>
<p>or Zapier or any of these kind of,</p>
<p>I would say compositional scripting kinds of things,</p>
<p>I mean, HyperCard was also a little bit in this vein.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much more accessible to most people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that implicit state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so hard for people to track.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so that&rsquo;s modular stuff,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also an aspect</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re building like higher and higher levels</p>
<p>of abstraction, but you do that a little bit with language.</p>
<p>So with language, you develop sort of ideas,</p>
<p>philosophies from Plato and so on.</p>
<p>And then you kind of leverage those philosophies</p>
<p>as you try to have deeper and deeper conversations.</p>
<p>But with programming,</p>
<p>it seems like you can build much more complicated systems.</p>
<p>Like without knowing how everything works,</p>
<p>you can build on top of the work of others.</p>
<p>And it seems like you&rsquo;re developing</p>
<p>more and more sophisticated expressions,</p>
<p>ability to express ideas in a computational space.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth pondering the difference here</p>
<p>between complexity and complication.</p>
<p>Okay, right. Back to Excel.</p>
<p>Well, not quite back to Excel,</p>
<p>but the idea is when we have a human conversation,</p>
<p>all languages for humans emerged</p>
<p>to support human relational communications,</p>
<p>which is that the person we&rsquo;re communicating with</p>
<p>is a person and they would communicate back to us.</p>
<p>And so we sort of hit a resonance point, right?</p>
<p>When we actually agree on some concepts.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a messiness to it and there&rsquo;s a fluidity to it.</p>
<p>With computing systems,</p>
<p>when we express something to the computer and it&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>we just try again.</p>
<p>So we can basically live many virtual worlds</p>
<p>of having failed at expressing ourselves to the computer</p>
<p>until the one time we expressed ourselves right.</p>
<p>Then we kind of put in production</p>
<p>and then discover that it&rsquo;s still wrong</p>
<p>a few days down the road.</p>
<p>So I think the sophistication of things</p>
<p>that we build with computing,</p>
<p>one has to really pay attention to the difference</p>
<p>between when an end user is expressing something</p>
<p>onto a system that exists</p>
<p>versus when they&rsquo;re extending the system</p>
<p>to increase the system&rsquo;s capability</p>
<p>for someone else to then interface with.</p>
<p>We happen to use the same language for both of those things</p>
<p>in most cases, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that.</p>
<p>And Excel is actually a great example of this,</p>
<p>of kind of a counterpoint to that.</p>
<p>Okay, so what about the idea of, you said messiness.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you put the software 2.0 idea,</p>
<p>this idea of machine learning</p>
<p>into the further and further steps</p>
<p>into the world of messiness.</p>
<p>The same kind of beautiful messiness of human communication.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what machine learning is?</p>
<p>Is building on levels of abstraction</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have messiness in them,</p>
<p>that at the operating system level,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s Python, the programming languages</p>
<p>that have more and more power.</p>
<p>But then finally, there&rsquo;s neural networks</p>
<p>that ultimately work with data.</p>
<p>And so the programming is almost in the space of data</p>
<p>and the data is allowed to be messy.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a kind of program?</p>
<p>So the idea of software 2.0 is a lot of the programming</p>
<p>happens in the space of data, so back to Excel,</p>
<p>all roads lead back to Excel, in the space of data</p>
<p>and also the hyperparameters of the neural networks.</p>
<p>And all of those allow the same kind of messiness</p>
<p>that human communication allows.</p>
<p>It does, but my background is in physics.</p>
<p>I took like two CS courses in college.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have, now I did cram a bunch of CS in prep</p>
<p>when I applied for grad school,</p>
<p>but still I don&rsquo;t have a formal background</p>
<p>in computer science.</p>
<p>But what I have observed in studying programming languages</p>
<p>and programming systems and things like that</p>
<p>is that there seems to be this triangle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these beautiful little iron triangles</p>
<p>that you find in life sometimes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the connection between the code correctness</p>
<p>and kind of expressiveness of code,</p>
<p>the semantics of the data,</p>
<p>and then the kind of correctness or parameters</p>
<p>of the underlying hardware compute system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the algorithms that you wanna apply,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what the bits that are stored on whatever media</p>
<p>actually represent, so the semantics of the data</p>
<p>within the representation,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s what the computer can actually do.</p>
<p>And every programming system, every information system</p>
<p>ultimately finds some spot in the middle</p>
<p>of this little triangle.</p>
<p>Sometimes some systems collapse them into just one edge.</p>
<p>Are we including humans as a system in this?</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m just thinking about computing systems here.</p>
<p>And the reason I bring this up is because</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s no free lunch around this stuff.</p>
<p>So if we build machine learning systems</p>
<p>to sort of write the correct code</p>
<p>that is at a certain level of performance,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll sort of select with hyperparameters</p>
<p>we can tune kind of how we want the performance boundary</p>
<p>in SLA to look like for transforming some set of inputs</p>
<p>into certain kinds of outputs.</p>
<p>That training process itself is intrinsically sensitive</p>
<p>to the kinds of inputs we put into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite sensitive to the boundary conditions</p>
<p>we put around the performance.</p>
<p>So I think even as we move to using automated systems</p>
<p>to build this transformation,</p>
<p>as opposed to humans explicitly</p>
<p>from a top down perspective, figuring out,</p>
<p>well, this schema and this database and these columns</p>
<p>get selected for this algorithm,</p>
<p>and here we put a Fibonacci heap for some other thing.</p>
<p>Human design or computer design,</p>
<p>ultimately what we hit,</p>
<p>the boundaries that we hit with these information systems</p>
<p>is when the representation of the data hits the real world</p>
<p>is where there&rsquo;s a lot of slop and a lot of interpretation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where actually I think</p>
<p>a lot of the work will go in the future</p>
<p>is actually understanding kind of how to better</p>
<p>in the view of these live data systems,</p>
<p>how to better encode the semantics of the world</p>
<p>for those things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be less of the details</p>
<p>of how we write a particular SQL query.</p>
<p>Okay, but given the semantics of the real world</p>
<p>and the messiness of that,</p>
<p>what does the word correctness mean</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about code?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of dimensions to correctness.</p>
<p>Historically, and this is one of the reasons I say</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re coming to the end of the era of software,</p>
<p>because for the last 40 years or so,</p>
<p>software correctness was really defined</p>
<p>about functional correctness.</p>
<p>I write a function, it&rsquo;s got some inputs,</p>
<p>does it produce the right outputs?</p>
<p>If so, then I can turn it on,</p>
<p>hook it up to the live database and it goes.</p>
<p>And more and more now we have,</p>
<p>I mean, in fact, I think the bright line in the sand</p>
<p>between machine learning systems</p>
<p>or modern data driven systems</p>
<p>versus classical software systems</p>
<p>is that the values of the input</p>
<p>actually have to be considered with the function together</p>
<p>to say this whole thing is correct or not.</p>
<p>And usually there&rsquo;s a performance SLA as well.</p>
<p>Like did it actually finish making this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s SLA?</p>
<p>Sorry, service level agreement.</p>
<p>So it has to return within some time.</p>
<p>You have a 10 millisecond time budget</p>
<p>to return a prediction of this level of accuracy, right?</p>
<p>So these are things that were not traditionally</p>
<p>in most business computing systems for the last 20 years</p>
<p>at all, people didn&rsquo;t think about it.</p>
<p>But now we have value dependence on functional correctness.</p>
<p>So that question of correctness</p>
<p>is becoming a bigger and bigger question.</p>
<p>What does that map to the end of software?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve thought about software as just this thing</p>
<p>that you can do in isolation with some test trial inputs</p>
<p>and in a very sort of sandboxed environment.</p>
<p>And we can quantify how does it scale?</p>
<p>How does it perform?</p>
<p>How many nodes do we need to allocate</p>
<p>if we wanna scale this many inputs?</p>
<p>When we start turning this stuff into prediction systems,</p>
<p>real cybernetic systems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find scenarios where you get inputs</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna wanna spend</p>
<p>a little more time thinking about.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna find inputs that are not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear what you should do, right?</p>
<p>So then the software has a varying amount of runtime</p>
<p>and correctness with regard to input.</p>
<p>And that is a different kind of system altogether.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a full on cybernetic system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a next generation information system</p>
<p>that is not like traditional software systems.</p>
<p>Can you maybe describe what is a cybernetic system?</p>
<p>Do you include humans in that picture?</p>
<p>So is a human in the loop kind of complex mess</p>
<p>of the whole kind of interactivity of software</p>
<p>with the real world or is it something more concrete?</p>
<p>Well, when I say cybernetic,</p>
<p>I really do mean that the software itself</p>
<p>is closing the observe, orient, decide, act loop by itself.</p>
<p>So humans being out of the loop is the fact</p>
<p>what for me makes it a cybernetic system.</p>
<p>And humans are out of that loop.</p>
<p>When humans are out of the loop,</p>
<p>when the machine is actually sort of deciding on its own</p>
<p>what it should do next to get more information,</p>
<p>that makes it a cybernetic system.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just at the dawn of this, right?</p>
<p>I think everyone talking about MLAI, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But really the thing we should be talking about</p>
<p>is when we really enter the cybernetic era</p>
<p>and all of the questions of ethics and governance</p>
<p>and all correctness and all these things,</p>
<p>they really are the most important questions.</p>
<p>Okay, can we just linger on this?</p>
<p>What does it mean for the human to be out of the loop</p>
<p>in a cybernetic system, because isn&rsquo;t the cybernetic system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ultimately accomplishing some kind of purpose</p>
<p>that at the bottom, the turtles all the way down,</p>
<p>at the bottom turtle is a human.</p>
<p>Well, the human may have set some criteria,</p>
<p>but the human wasn&rsquo;t precise.</p>
<p>So for instance, I just read the other day</p>
<p>that earlier this year,</p>
<p>or maybe it was last year at some point,</p>
<p>the Libyan army, I think,</p>
<p>sent out some automated killer drones with explosives.</p>
<p>And there was no human in the loop at that point.</p>
<p>They basically put them in a geofenced area,</p>
<p>said find any moving target, like a truck or vehicle</p>
<p>that looks like this, and boom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a human in the loop, right?</p>
<p>So increasingly, the less human there is in the loop,</p>
<p>the more concerned you are about these kinds of systems,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s unintended consequences,</p>
<p>like less the original designer and engineer of the system</p>
<p>is able to predict, even one with good intent</p>
<p>is able to predict the consequences of such a system.</p>
<p>Is that it? That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There are some software systems, right,</p>
<p>that run without humans in the loop</p>
<p>that are quite complex.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the electronic markets.</p>
<p>And we get flash crashes all the time.</p>
<p>We get in the heyday of high frequency trading,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of market microstructure,</p>
<p>people doing all sorts of weird stuff</p>
<p>that the market designers had never really thought about,</p>
<p>contemplated or intended.</p>
<p>So when we run these full on systems</p>
<p>with these automated trading bots,</p>
<p>now they become automated killer drones</p>
<p>and then all sorts of other stuff.</p>
<p>We are, that&rsquo;s what I mean by we&rsquo;re at the dawn</p>
<p>of the cybernetic era and the end of the era</p>
<p>of just pure software.</p>
<p>Are you more concerned,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re thinking about cybernetic systems</p>
<p>or even like self replicating systems,</p>
<p>so systems that aren&rsquo;t just doing a particular task,</p>
<p>but are able to sort of multiply and scale</p>
<p>in some dimension in the digital</p>
<p>or even the physical world.</p>
<p>Are you more concerned about like the lobster being boiled?</p>
<p>So a gradual with us not noticing,</p>
<p>collapse of civilization or a big explosion,</p>
<p>like oops, kind of a big thing where everyone notices,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>I think that it will be a different experience</p>
<p>for different people.</p>
<p>I do share a common point of view</p>
<p>with some of the climate,</p>
<p>people who are concerned about climate change</p>
<p>and just the big existential risks that we have.</p>
<p>But unlike a lot of people who share my level of concern,</p>
<p>I think the collapse will not be quite so dramatic</p>
<p>as some of them think.</p>
<p>And what I mean is that,</p>
<p>I think that for certain tiers of let&rsquo;s say economic class</p>
<p>or certain locations in the world,</p>
<p>people will experience dramatic collapse scenarios.</p>
<p>But for a lot of people, especially in the developed world,</p>
<p>the realities of collapse will be managed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be narrative management around it</p>
<p>so that they essentially insulate,</p>
<p>the middle class will be used to insulate the upper class</p>
<p>from the pitchforks and the flaming torches and everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because,</p>
<p>so my specific question wasn&rsquo;t as general.</p>
<p>My question was more about cybernetic systems or software.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>but it would nevertheless perhaps be about class.</p>
<p>So the effect of algorithms</p>
<p>might affect certain classes more than others.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I was more thinking about</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s social media algorithms or actual robots,</p>
<p>is there going to be a gradual effect on us</p>
<p>where we wake up one day</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t recognize the humans we are,</p>
<p>or is it something truly dramatic</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like a meltdown of a nuclear reactor</p>
<p>kind of thing, Chernobyl, like catastrophic events</p>
<p>that are almost bugs in a program that scaled itself</p>
<p>too quickly?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not as concerned about the visible stuff.</p>
<p>And the reason is because the big visible explosions,</p>
<p>I mean, this is something I said about social media</p>
<p>is that at least with nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>when a nuke goes off, you can see it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, well, that&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>wow, that&rsquo;s kind of bad, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Oppenheimer was reciting the Bhagavad Gita, right?</p>
<p>When he saw one of those things go off.</p>
<p>So we can see nukes are really bad.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not reciting anything about Twitter.</p>
<p>Well, but right, but then when you have social media,</p>
<p>when you have all these different things that conspire</p>
<p>to create a layer of virtual experience for people</p>
<p>that alienates them from reality and from each other,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very pernicious, that&rsquo;s impossible to see, right?</p>
<p>And it kind of slowly gets in there, so.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written about this idea of virtuality</p>
<p>on this topic, which you define as the subjective phenomenon</p>
<p>of knowingly engaging with virtual sensation and perception</p>
<p>and suspending or forgetting the context</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s simulacrum.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what is real?</p>
<p>Is there a hard line between reality and virtuality?</p>
<p>Like perception drifts from some kind of physical reality.</p>
<p>We have to kind of have a sense of what is the line</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too, we&rsquo;ve gone too far.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s not about any hard line about physical reality</p>
<p>as much as a simple question of,</p>
<p>does the particular technology help people connect</p>
<p>in a more integral way with other people,</p>
<p>with their environment,</p>
<p>with all of the full spectrum of things around them?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s less about, oh, this is a virtual thing</p>
<p>and this is a hard real thing,</p>
<p>more about when we create virtual representations</p>
<p>of the real things, always some things</p>
<p>are lost in translation.</p>
<p>Usually many, many dimensions are lost in translation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now coming to almost two years of COVID,</p>
<p>people on Zoom all the time.</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s different when you meet somebody in person</p>
<p>than when you see them on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen you on YouTube lots, right?</p>
<p>But then seeing a person is very different.</p>
<p>And so I think when we engage in virtual experiences</p>
<p>all the time, and we only do that,</p>
<p>there is absolutely a level of embodiment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a level of embodied experience</p>
<p>and participatory interaction that is lost.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to put your finger on exactly what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say, oh, we&rsquo;re gonna spend $100 million</p>
<p>building a new system that captures this 5% better,</p>
<p>higher fidelity human expression.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s gonna pay for that, right?</p>
<p>So when we rush madly into a world of simulacrum</p>
<p>and virtuality, the things that are lost are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>Once everyone moves there, it can be hard to look back</p>
<p>and see what we&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>So is it irrecoverably lost?</p>
<p>Or rather, when you put it all on the table,</p>
<p>is it possible for more to be gained than is lost?</p>
<p>If you look at video games,</p>
<p>they create virtual experiences that are surreal</p>
<p>and can bring joy to a lot of people,</p>
<p>can connect a lot of people,</p>
<p>and can get people to talk a lot of trash.</p>
<p>So they can bring out the best and the worst in people.</p>
<p>So is it possible to have a future world</p>
<p>where the pros outweigh the cons?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s possible to have that in the current world.</p>
<p>But when literally trillions of dollars of capital</p>
<p>are tied to using those things</p>
<p>to groom the worst of our inclinations</p>
<p>and to attack our weaknesses in the limbic system</p>
<p>to create these things into id machines</p>
<p>versus connection machines,</p>
<p>then those good things don&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p>
<p>Can you make a lot of money by building connection machines?</p>
<p>Is it possible, do you think,</p>
<p>to bring out the best in human nature</p>
<p>to create fulfilling connections and relationships</p>
<p>in the digital world and make a shit ton of money?</p>
<p>If I figure it out, I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s your intuition</p>
<p>without concretely knowing what&rsquo;s the solution?</p>
<p>My intuition is that a lot of our digital technologies</p>
<p>give us the ability to have synthetic connections</p>
<p>or to experience virtuality.</p>
<p>They have co evolved with sort of the human expectations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like sugary drinks.</p>
<p>As people have more sugary drinks,</p>
<p>they need more sugary drinks to get that same hit, right?</p>
<p>So with these virtual things and with TV and fast cuts</p>
<p>and TikToks and all these different kinds of things,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re co creating essentially humanity</p>
<p>that sort of asks and needs those things.</p>
<p>And now it becomes very difficult</p>
<p>to get people to slow down.</p>
<p>It gets difficult for people to hold their attention</p>
<p>on slow things and actually feel that embodied experience.</p>
<p>So mindfulness now more than ever is so important in schools</p>
<p>and as a therapy technique for people</p>
<p>because our environment has been accelerated.</p>
<p>And McLuhan actually talks about this</p>
<p>in the electric environment of the television.</p>
<p>And that was before TikTok and before front facing cameras.</p>
<p>So I think for me, the concern is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like we can ever switch to doing something better,</p>
<p>but more of the humans and technology,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not independent of each other.</p>
<p>The technology that we use kind of molds what we need</p>
<p>for the next generation of technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, but humans are intelligent and they&rsquo;re introspective</p>
<p>and they can reflect on the experiences of their life.</p>
<p>So for example, there&rsquo;s been many years in my life</p>
<p>where I ate an excessive amount of sugar.</p>
<p>And then a certain moment I woke up and said,</p>
<p>why do I keep doing this?</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>Like longterm.</p>
<p>And I think, so going through the TikTok process</p>
<p>of realizing, okay, when I shorten my attention span,</p>
<p>actually that does not make me feel good longer term.</p>
<p>And realizing that and then going to platforms,</p>
<p>going to places that are away from the sugar.</p>
<p>So in so doing, you can create platforms</p>
<p>that can make a lot of money to help people wake up</p>
<p>to what actually makes them feel good longterm.</p>
<p>Develop, grow as human beings.</p>
<p>And it just feels like humans are more intelligent</p>
<p>than mice looking for cheese.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to sort of think, I mean,</p>
<p>we can contemplate our own mortality.</p>
<p>We can contemplate things like longterm love</p>
<p>and we can have a longterm fear</p>
<p>of certain things like mortality.</p>
<p>We can contemplate whether the experiences,</p>
<p>the sort of the drugs of daily life</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been partaking in is making us happier,</p>
<p>better people.</p>
<p>And then once we contemplate that,</p>
<p>we can make financial decisions in using services</p>
<p>and paying for services that are making us better people.</p>
<p>So it just seems that we&rsquo;re in the very first stages</p>
<p>of social networks that just were able to make a lot of money</p>
<p>really quickly, but in bringing out sometimes</p>
<p>the bad parts of human nature, they didn&rsquo;t destroy humans.</p>
<p>They just fed everybody a lot of sugar.</p>
<p>And now everyone&rsquo;s gonna wake up and say,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re gonna start having like sugar free social media.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there.</p>
<p>I think some people certainly have the capacity for that.</p>
<p>And I certainly think, I mean, it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>even the way you said it, you woke up one day</p>
<p>and you thought, well, this doesn&rsquo;t feel very good.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s still your limbic system saying</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t feel very good, right?</p>
<p>You have a cat brain&rsquo;s worth of neurons around your gut,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And so maybe that saturated and that was telling you,</p>
<p>hey, this isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>Humans are more than just mice looking for cheese</p>
<p>or monkeys looking for sex and power, right?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s slow down.</p>
<p>Now a lot of people would argue with you on that one,</p>
<p>but yes.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re more than just that, but we&rsquo;re at least that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re very, very seldom not that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t actually disagree with you</p>
<p>that we could be better and that better platforms exist.</p>
<p>And people are voluntarily noping out of things</p>
<p>like Facebook and noping out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an awesome verb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great term.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>I use it all the time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome, Mike.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to nope out of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to nope out of that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a hard pass and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s again, to your point,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first generation of front facing cameras</p>
<p>of social pressures.</p>
<p>And you as a self starter, self aware adult</p>
<p>have the capacity to say, yeah, I&rsquo;m not gonna do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go and spend time on long form reads.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna spend time managing my attention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do some yoga.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a 15 year old in high school</p>
<p>and your entire social environment</p>
<p>is everyone doing these things,</p>
<p>guess what you&rsquo;re gonna do?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna kind of have to do that</p>
<p>because your limbic system says,</p>
<p>hey, I need to get the guy or the girl or the whatever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>And so one of the things that we have to reason about here</p>
<p>is the social media systems or social media,</p>
<p>I think is our first encounter with a technological system</p>
<p>that runs a bit of a loop around our own cognition</p>
<p>and attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the last, it&rsquo;s far from the last.</p>
<p>And it gets to the heart of some of the philosophical</p>
<p>Achilles heel of the Western philosophical system,</p>
<p>which is each person gets to make their own determination.</p>
<p>Each person is an individual that&rsquo;s sacrosanct</p>
<p>in their agency and their sovereignty and all these things.</p>
<p>The problem with these systems is they come down</p>
<p>and they are able to make their own decisions.</p>
<p>They come down and they are able to manage everyone on mass.</p>
<p>And so every person is making their own decision,</p>
<p>but together the bigger system is causing them to act</p>
<p>with a group dynamic that&rsquo;s very profitable for people.</p>
<p>So this is the issue that we have is that our philosophies</p>
<p>are actually not geared to understand</p>
<p>what is it for a person to have a high trust connection</p>
<p>as part of a collective and for that collective</p>
<p>to have its right to coherency and agency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something like when a social media app</p>
<p>causes a family to break apart,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done harm to more than just individuals, right?</p>
<p>So that concept is not something we really talk about</p>
<p>or think about very much, but that&rsquo;s actually the problem</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re vaporizing molecules into atomic units</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re hitting all the atoms with certain things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, yeah, well, that person chose to look at my app.</p>
<p>So our understanding of human nature</p>
<p>at the individual level, it emphasizes the individual</p>
<p>too much because ultimately society operates</p>
<p>at the collective level.</p>
<p>And these apps do as well.</p>
<p>And the apps do as well.</p>
<p>So for us to understand the progression and the development</p>
<p>of this organism we call human civilization,</p>
<p>we have to think at the collective level too.</p>
<p>I would say multi tiered.</p>
<p>Multi tiered.</p>
<p>So individual as well.</p>
<p>Individuals, family units, social collectives</p>
<p>and all the way up.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;ve said that individual humans</p>
<p>are multi layered susceptible to signals and waves</p>
<p>and multiple strata, the physical, the biological,</p>
<p>social, cultural, intellectual.</p>
<p>So sort of going along these lines,</p>
<p>can you describe the layers of the cake</p>
<p>that is a human being and maybe the human collective,</p>
<p>human society?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just stealing wholesale here from Robert Persig,</p>
<p>who is the author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle</p>
<p>Maintenance and his follow on book has a sequel to it</p>
<p>called Lila.</p>
<p>He goes into this in a little more detail.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a crude approach to thinking about people.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s still an advancement</p>
<p>over traditional subject object metaphysics,</p>
<p>where we look at people as a dualist would say,</p>
<p>well, is your mind, your consciousness,</p>
<p>is that just merely the matter that&rsquo;s in your brain</p>
<p>or is there something kind of more beyond that?</p>
<p>And they would say, yes, there&rsquo;s a soul,</p>
<p>sort of ineffable soul beyond just merely the physical body.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not one of those people.</p>
<p>I think that we don&rsquo;t have to draw a line between are things</p>
<p>only this or only that.</p>
<p>Collectives of things can emerge structures and patterns</p>
<p>that are just as real as the underlying pieces.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re transcendent, but they&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>of the underlying pieces.</p>
<p>So your body is this way.</p>
<p>I mean, we just know physically you consist of atoms</p>
<p>and whatnot.</p>
<p>And then the atoms are arranged into molecules</p>
<p>which then arrange into certain kinds of structures</p>
<p>that seem to have a homeostasis to them.</p>
<p>We call them cells.</p>
<p>And those cells form sort of biological structures.</p>
<p>Those biological structures give your body</p>
<p>its physical ability and the biological ability</p>
<p>to consume energy and to maintain homeostasis.</p>
<p>But humans are social animals.</p>
<p>I mean, human by themselves is not very long for the world.</p>
<p>So part of our biology is why are two connect to other people?</p>
<p>From the mirror neurons to our language centers</p>
<p>and all these other things.</p>
<p>So we are intrinsically, there&rsquo;s a layer,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a part of us that wants to be part of a thing.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re around other people, not saying a word,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just up and down jumping and dancing, laughing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to feel better.</p>
<p>And there was no exchange of physical anything.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t give us like five atoms of happiness.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an induction in our own sense of self</p>
<p>that is at that social level.</p>
<p>And then beyond that, Persick puts the intellectual level</p>
<p>kind of one level higher than social.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re actually more intertwined than that.</p>
<p>But the intellectual level is the level of pure ideas.</p>
<p>That you are a vessel for memes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a vessel for philosophies.</p>
<p>You will conduct yourself in a particular way.</p>
<p>I mean, I think part of this is if we think about it</p>
<p>from a physics perspective, you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the joke that physicists like to approximate things.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll say, well, approximate a spherical cow, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a spherical cow, you&rsquo;re not a spherical human.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a messy human.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t even say what the dynamics of your emotion</p>
<p>will be unless we analyze all four of these layers, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Muslim at a certain time of day, guess what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be on the ground kneeling and praying, right?</p>
<p>And that has nothing to do with your biological need</p>
<p>to get on the ground or physics of gravity.</p>
<p>It is an intellectual drive that you have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cultural phenomenon</p>
<p>and an intellectual belief that you carry.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what the four layered stack is all about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that a person is not only one of these things,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all of these things at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a superposition of dynamics that run through us</p>
<p>that make us who we are.</p>
<p>So no layer is special.</p>
<p>Not so much no layer is special,</p>
<p>each layer is just different.</p>
<p>But we are.</p>
<p>Each layer gets the participation trophy.</p>
<p>Yeah, each layer is a part of what you are.</p>
<p>You are a layer cake, right, of all these things.</p>
<p>And if we try to deny, right,</p>
<p>so many philosophies do try to deny</p>
<p>the reality of some of these things, right?</p>
<p>Some people will say, well, we&rsquo;re only atoms.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re not only atoms</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of other things that are only atoms.</p>
<p>I can reduce a human being to a bunch of soup</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not the same thing,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s the same atoms.</p>
<p>So I think the order and the patterns</p>
<p>that emerge within humans to understand,</p>
<p>to really think about what a next generation philosophy</p>
<p>would look like, that would allow us to reason</p>
<p>about extending humans into the digital realm</p>
<p>or to interact with autonomous intelligences</p>
<p>that are not biological in nature.</p>
<p>We really need to appreciate these,</p>
<p>that human, what human beings actually are</p>
<p>is the superposition of these different layers.</p>
<p>You mentioned consciousness.</p>
<p>Are each of these layers of cake conscious?</p>
<p>Is consciousness a particular quality of one of the layers?</p>
<p>Is there like a spike if you have a consciousness detector</p>
<p>at these layers or is something that just permeates</p>
<p>all of these layers and just takes different form?</p>
<p>I believe what humans experience as consciousness</p>
<p>is something that sits on a gradient scale</p>
<p>of a general principle in the universe</p>
<p>that seems to look for order and reach for order</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s an excess of energy.</p>
<p>You know, it would be odd to say a proton is alive, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be odd to say like this particular atom</p>
<p>or molecule of hydrogen gas is alive,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certainly something we can make assemblages</p>
<p>of these things that have autopoetic aspects to them</p>
<p>that will create structures that will, you know,</p>
<p>crystalline solids will form very interesting</p>
<p>and beautiful structures.</p>
<p>This gets kind of into weird mathematical territories.</p>
<p>You start thinking about Penrose and Game of Life stuff</p>
<p>about the generativity of math itself,</p>
<p>like the hyperreal numbers, things like that.</p>
<p>But without going down that rabbit hole,</p>
<p>I would say that there seems to be a tendency</p>
<p>in the world that when there is excess energy,</p>
<p>things will structure and pattern themselves.</p>
<p>And they will then actually furthermore try to create</p>
<p>an environment that furthers their continued stability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the concept of externalized extended phenotype</p>
<p>or niche construction.</p>
<p>So this is ultimately what leads to certain kinds</p>
<p>of amino acids forming certain kinds of structures</p>
<p>and so on and so forth until you get the ladder of life.</p>
<p>So what we experience as consciousness,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t think cells are conscious at that level,</p>
<p>but is there something beyond mere equilibrium state biology</p>
<p>and chemistry and biochemistry</p>
<p>that drives what makes things work?</p>
<p>I think there is.</p>
<p>So Adrian Bajan has his ConstructoLaw.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other things you can look at.</p>
<p>When you look at the life sciences</p>
<p>and you look at any kind of statistical physics</p>
<p>and statistical mechanics,</p>
<p>when you look at things far out of equilibrium,</p>
<p>when you have excess energy, what happens then?</p>
<p>Life doesn&rsquo;t just make a hotter soup.</p>
<p>It starts making structure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>The poetry of reaches for order</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s an excess of energy.</p>
<p>Because you brought up game of life.</p>
<p>You did it, not me.</p>
<p>I love cellular automata,</p>
<p>so I have to sort of linger on that for a little bit.</p>
<p>So cellular automata, I guess, or game of life</p>
<p>is a very simple example of reaching for order</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s an excess of energy.</p>
<p>Or reaching for order and somehow creating complexity.</p>
<p>Within this explosion of just turmoil,</p>
<p>somehow trying to construct structures.</p>
<p>And in so doing, create very elaborate</p>
<p>organism looking type things.</p>
<p>What intuition do you draw from this simple mechanism?</p>
<p>Well, I like to turn that around its head.</p>
<p>And look at it as what if every single one of the patterns</p>
<p>created life, or created, not life,</p>
<p>but created interesting patterns?</p>
<p>Because some of them don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And sometimes you make cool gliders.</p>
<p>And other times, you start with certain things</p>
<p>and you make gliders and other things</p>
<p>that then construct like AND gates and NOT gates, right?</p>
<p>And you build computers on them.</p>
<p>All of these rules that create these patterns</p>
<p>that we can see, those are just the patterns we can see.</p>
<p>What if our subjectivity is actually limiting</p>
<p>our ability to perceive the order in all of it?</p>
<p>What if some of the things that we think are random</p>
<p>are actually not that random?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re simply not integrating at a final level</p>
<p>across a broad enough time horizon.</p>
<p>And this is again, I said, we go down the rabbit holes</p>
<p>and the Penrose stuff or like Wolfram&rsquo;s explorations</p>
<p>on these things.</p>
<p>There is something deep and beautiful</p>
<p>in the mathematics of all this.</p>
<p>That is hopefully one day I&rsquo;ll have enough money</p>
<p>to work and retire and just ponder those questions.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a ceiling to,</p>
<p>when you have enough money and you retire and you ponder,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ceiling to how much you can truly ponder</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s cognitive limitations</p>
<p>in what you&rsquo;re able to perceive as a pattern.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe mathematics extends your perception capabilities,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still finite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like.</p>
<p>Yeah, the mathematics we use is the mathematics</p>
<p>that can fit in our head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did God really create the integers?</p>
<p>Or did God create all of it?</p>
<p>And we just happen at this point in time</p>
<p>to be able to perceive integers.</p>
<p>Well, he just did the positive in it.</p>
<p>She, I just said, did she create all of it?</p>
<p>And then we.</p>
<p>She just created the natural numbers</p>
<p>and then we screwed it all up with zero and then I guess.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But we did, we created mathematical operations</p>
<p>so that we can have iterated steps</p>
<p>to approach bigger problems, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the entire point of the Arabic Neural System</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a rubric for mapping a certain set of operations,</p>
<p>folding them into a simple little expression,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just the operations that we can fit in our heads.</p>
<p>There are many other operations besides, right?</p>
<p>The thing that worries me the most about aliens and humans</p>
<p>is that the aliens are all around us and we&rsquo;re too dumb.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To see them.</p>
<p>Oh, certainly, yeah.</p>
<p>Or life, let&rsquo;s say just life,</p>
<p>life of all kinds of forms or organisms.</p>
<p>You know what, just even the intelligence of organisms</p>
<p>is imperceptible to us</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re too dumb and self centered.</p>
<p>That worries me.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re looking for a particular kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When I was at Cornell,</p>
<p>I had a lovely professor of Asian religions,</p>
<p>Jane Marie Law,</p>
<p>and she would tell this story about a musical,</p>
<p>a musician, a Western musician who went to Japan</p>
<p>and he taught classical music</p>
<p>and could play all sorts of instruments.</p>
<p>He went to Japan and he would ask people,</p>
<p>he would basically be looking for things in the style of</p>
<p>a Western chromatic scale and these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then finding none of it,</p>
<p>he would say, well, there&rsquo;s really no music in Japan,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re using a different scale.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re playing different kinds of instruments, right?</p>
<p>The same thing she was using as a sort of a metaphor</p>
<p>for religion as well.</p>
<p>In the West, we center a lot of religion,</p>
<p>certainly the religions of Abraham,</p>
<p>we center them around belief.</p>
<p>And in the East, it&rsquo;s more about practice, right?</p>
<p>Spirituality and practice rather than belief.</p>
<p>So anyway, the point is here to your point,</p>
<p>life, we, I think so many people are so fixated</p>
<p>on certain aspects of self replication</p>
<p>or homeostasis or whatever.</p>
<p>But if we kind of broaden and generalize this thing</p>
<p>of things reaching for order,</p>
<p>under which conditions can they then create an environment</p>
<p>that sustains that order, that allows them,</p>
<p>the invention of death is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>There are some organisms on earth</p>
<p>that are thousands of years old.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re incredibly complex,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually simpler than the cells that comprise us,</p>
<p>but they never die.</p>
<p>So at some point, death was invented,</p>
<p>somewhere along the eukaryotic scale,</p>
<p>I mean, even the protists, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>And why is that along with the sexual reproduction, right?</p>
<p>There is something about the renewal process,</p>
<p>something about the ability to respond</p>
<p>to a changing environment,</p>
<p>where it just becomes,</p>
<p>just killing off the old generation</p>
<p>and letting new generations try,</p>
<p>seems to be the best way to fit into the niche.</p>
<p>Human historians seems to write about wheels and fires,</p>
<p>the greatest inventions,</p>
<p>but it seems like death and sex are pretty good.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re kind of essential inventions</p>
<p>at the very beginning.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we didn&rsquo;t invent them, right?</p>
<p>Well, Broad, you didn&rsquo;t invent them.</p>
<p>I see us as one,</p>
<p>you particular Homo sapiens did not invent them,</p>
<p>but we together, it&rsquo;s a team project,</p>
<p>just like you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I think the greatest Homo sapiens invention</p>
<p>is collaboration.</p>
<p>So when you say collaboration,</p>
<p>Peter, where do ideas come from</p>
<p>and how do they take hold in society?</p>
<p>Is that the nature of collaboration?</p>
<p>Is that the basic atom of collaboration is ideas?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not not ideas, but it&rsquo;s not only ideas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book I just started reading</p>
<p>called Death From A Distance.</p>
<p>Have you heard of this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really fascinating thesis,</p>
<p>which is that humans are the only conspecific,</p>
<p>the only species that can kill other members</p>
<p>of the species from range.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s a few exceptions,</p>
<p>but if you look in the animal world,</p>
<p>you see like pronghorns butting heads, right?</p>
<p>You see the alpha lion and the beta lion</p>
<p>and they take each other down.</p>
<p>Humans, we developed the ability</p>
<p>to chuck rocks at each other,</p>
<p>well, at prey, but also at each other.</p>
<p>And that means the beta male can chunk a rock</p>
<p>at the alpha male and take them down.</p>
<p>And he can throw a lot of rocks actually,</p>
<p>miss a bunch of times, but just hit once and be good.</p>
<p>So this ability to actually kill members</p>
<p>of our own species from range</p>
<p>without a threat of harm to ourselves</p>
<p>created essentially mutually assured destruction</p>
<p>where we had to evolve cooperation.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t, then if we just continue to try to do,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m the biggest monkey in the tribe</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna own this tribe and you have to go,</p>
<p>if we do it that way, then those tribes basically failed.</p>
<p>And the tribes that persisted</p>
<p>and that have now given rise to the modern Homo sapiens</p>
<p>are the ones where respecting the fact</p>
<p>that we can kill each other from a range</p>
<p>without harm, like there&rsquo;s an asymmetric ability</p>
<p>to snipe the leader from range.</p>
<p>That meant that we sort of had to learn</p>
<p>how to cooperate with each other, right?</p>
<p>Come back here, don&rsquo;t throw that rock at me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk our differences out.</p>
<p>So violence is also part of collaboration.</p>
<p>The threat of violence, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Well, the recognition, maybe the better way to put it</p>
<p>is the recognition that we have more to gain</p>
<p>by working together than the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</p>
<p>of both of us defecting.</p>
<p>So mutually assured destruction in all its forms</p>
<p>is part of this idea of collaboration.</p>
<p>Well, and Eric Weinstein talks about our nuclear peace,</p>
<p>right, I mean, it kind of sucks</p>
<p>with thousands of warheads aimed at each other,</p>
<p>we mean Russia and the US, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>on the other hand, we only fought proxy wars, right?</p>
<p>We did not have another World War III</p>
<p>of like hundreds of millions of people dying</p>
<p>to like machine gun fire and giant guided missiles.</p>
<p>So the original nuclear weapon is a rock</p>
<p>that we learned how to throw, essentially?</p>
<p>The original, yeah, well, the original scope of the world</p>
<p>for any human being was their little tribe.</p>
<p>I would say it still is for the most part.</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein speaks very highly of you,</p>
<p>which is very surprising to me at first</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s this depth to you</p>
<p>because I knew you as an amazing leader of engineers</p>
<p>and an engineer yourself and so on, so it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Maybe just as a comment, a side tangent that we can take,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your nature of your friendship with Eric Weinstein?</p>
<p>How did the two, how did such two interesting paths cross?</p>
<p>Is it your origins in physics?</p>
<p>Is it your interest in philosophy</p>
<p>and the ideas of how the world works?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very random, Eric found me.</p>
<p>He actually found Travis and I.</p>
<p>Travis Oliphant.</p>
<p>Oliphant, yeah, we were both working</p>
<p>at a company called Enthought back in the mid 2000s</p>
<p>and we were doing a lot of consulting</p>
<p>around scientific Python and we&rsquo;d made some tools</p>
<p>and Eric was trying to use some of these Python tools</p>
<p>to visualize, he had a fiber bundle approach</p>
<p>to modeling certain aspects of economics.</p>
<p>He was doing this and that&rsquo;s how he kind of got in touch</p>
<p>with us and so.</p>
<p>This was in the early.</p>
<p>This was mid 2000s, oh seven timeframe, oh six, oh seven.</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein trying to use Python.</p>
<p>Right, to visualize fiber bundles.</p>
<p>Using some of the tools that we had built</p>
<p>in the open source.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s somehow entertaining to me, the thought of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very funny but then we met with him a couple times,</p>
<p>a really interesting guy and then in the wake</p>
<p>of the oh seven, oh eight kind of financial collapse,</p>
<p>he helped organize with Lee Smolin a symposium</p>
<p>at the Perimeter Institute about okay, well clearly,</p>
<p>big finance can&rsquo;t be trusted, government&rsquo;s in its pockets</p>
<p>with regulatory capture, what the F do we do?</p>
<p>And all sorts of people, Nassim Tlaib was there</p>
<p>and Andy Lowe from MIT was there and Bill Janeway,</p>
<p>I mean just a lot of top billing people were there</p>
<p>and he invited me and Travis and another one</p>
<p>of our coworkers, Robert Kern, who is anyone</p>
<p>in the SciPy, NumPy community knows Robert.</p>
<p>Really great guy.</p>
<p>So the three of us also got invited to go to this thing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where I met Brett Weinstein</p>
<p>for the first time as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I knew him before he got all famous</p>
<p>for unfortunate reasons, I guess.</p>
<p>But anyway, so we met then and kind of had a friendship</p>
<p>throughout since then.</p>
<p>You have a depth of thinking that kind of runs</p>
<p>with Eric in terms of just thinking about the world deeply</p>
<p>and thinking philosophically and then there&rsquo;s Eric&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interest in programming.</p>
<p>I actually have never, you know, he&rsquo;ll bring up programming</p>
<p>to me quite a bit as a metaphor for stuff.</p>
<p>But I never kind of pushed the point of like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the nature of your interest in programming?</p>
<p>I think he saw it probably as a tool.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>That you visualize, to explore mathematics</p>
<p>and explore physics and I was wondering like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his depth of interest and also his vision</p>
<p>for what programming would look like in the future.</p>
<p>Have you had interaction with him, like discussion</p>
<p>in the space of Python, programming?</p>
<p>Well, in the sense of sometimes he asks me,</p>
<p>why is this stuff still so hard?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, everybody&rsquo;s a critic.</p>
<p>But actually, no, Eric.</p>
<p>Programming, you mean, like in general?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, well, not programming in general,</p>
<p>but certain things in the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>But he actually, I think what I find in listening</p>
<p>to some of his stuff is that he does use</p>
<p>programming metaphors a lot, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll talk about APIs or object oriented</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a useful set of frames</p>
<p>for him to draw upon for discourse.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t pair programmed with him in a very long time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve previously pair coded with Eric.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I look at his code trying to help</p>
<p>like put together some of the visualizations</p>
<p>around these things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been a very, not really pair programmed,</p>
<p>but like even looked at his code, right?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>How legendary would be is that like Git repo</p>
<p>with Peter Wang and Eric Weinstein?</p>
<p>Well, honestly, Robert Kern did all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>So I have to give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>Robert is the silent but incredibly deep, quiet,</p>
<p>not silent, but quiet, but incredibly deep individual</p>
<p>at the heart of a lot of those things</p>
<p>that Eric was trying to do.</p>
<p>But we did have, you know, as Travis and I</p>
<p>were starting our company in 2012 timeframe,</p>
<p>we went to New York.</p>
<p>Eric was still in New York at the time.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t moved to, this is before he joined Teal Capital.</p>
<p>We just had like a steak dinner somewhere.</p>
<p>Maybe it was Keynes, I don&rsquo;t know, somewhere in New York.</p>
<p>So it was me, Travis, Eric, and then Wes McKinney,</p>
<p>the creative pandas, and then Wes&rsquo;s then business partner,</p>
<p>Adam, the five of us sat around having this,</p>
<p>just a hilarious time, amazing dinner.</p>
<p>I forget what all we talked about,</p>
<p>but it was one of those conversations,</p>
<p>which I wish as soon as COVID is over,</p>
<p>maybe Eric and I can sit down.</p>
<p>Recreate.</p>
<p>Recreate it somewhere in LA, or maybe he comes here,</p>
<p>because a lot of cool people are here in Austin, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re all here.</p>
<p>He should come here.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he uses the metaphor source code sometimes</p>
<p>to talk about physics.</p>
<p>We figure out our own source code.</p>
<p>So you with a physics background</p>
<p>and somebody who&rsquo;s quite a bit of an expert in source code,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll ever figure out our own source code</p>
<p>in the way that Eric means?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll figure out the nature of reality?</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;re constantly working on that problem.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;ll make more and more progress.</p>
<p>For me, there&rsquo;s some things I don&rsquo;t really doubt too much.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t really doubt that one day</p>
<p>we will create a synthetic, maybe not fully in silicon,</p>
<p>but a synthetic approach to</p>
<p>cognition that rivals the biological</p>
<p>20 watt computers in our heads.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s cognition here?</p>
<p>Cognition.</p>
<p>Which aspect?</p>
<p>Perception, attention, memory, recall,</p>
<p>asking better questions.</p>
<p>That for me is a measure of intelligence.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Roomba vacuum cleaner already do that?</p>
<p>Or do you mean, oh, it doesn&rsquo;t ask questions.</p>
<p>I mean, no, it&rsquo;s, I mean, I have a Roomba,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not even as smart as my cat, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it asks questions about what is this wall?</p>
<p>It now, new feature asks, is this poop or not, apparently.</p>
<p>Yes, a lot of our current cybernetic system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cybernetic system.</p>
<p>It will go and it will happily vacuum up some poop, right?</p>
<p>The older generations would.</p>
<p>The new one, just released, does not vacuum up the poop.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is a commercial for.</p>
<p>I wonder if it still gets stuck</p>
<p>under my first rung of my stair.</p>
<p>In any case, these cybernetic systems we have,</p>
<p>they are mold, they&rsquo;re designed to be sent off</p>
<p>into a relatively static environment.</p>
<p>And whatever dynamic things happen in the environment,</p>
<p>they have a very limited capacity to respond to.</p>
<p>A human baby, a human toddler of 18 months of age</p>
<p>has more capacity to manage its own attention</p>
<p>and its own capacity to make better sense of the world</p>
<p>than the most advanced robots today.</p>
<p>So again, my cat, I think can do a better job of my two</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both pretty clever.</p>
<p>So I do think though, back to my kind of original point,</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s not, for me, it&rsquo;s not question at all</p>
<p>that we will be able to create synthetic systems</p>
<p>that are able to do this better than the human,</p>
<p>at an equal level or better than the human mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also for me, not a question that we will be able</p>
<p>to put them alongside humans</p>
<p>so that they capture the full broad spectrum</p>
<p>of what we are seeing as well.</p>
<p>And also looking at our responses,</p>
<p>listening to our responses,</p>
<p>even maybe measuring certain vital signs about us.</p>
<p>So in this kind of sidecar mode,</p>
<p>a greater intelligence could use us</p>
<p>and our whatever 80 years of life to train itself up</p>
<p>and then be a very good simulacrum of us moving forward.</p>
<p>So who is in the sidecar</p>
<p>in that picture of the future exactly?</p>
<p>The baby version of our immortal selves.</p>
<p>Okay, so once the baby grows up,</p>
<p>is there any use for humans?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think that out of epistemic humility,</p>
<p>we need to keep humans around for a long time.</p>
<p>And I would hope that anyone making those systems</p>
<p>would believe that to be true.</p>
<p>Out of epistemic humility,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the nature of the humility that?</p>
<p>That we don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>First we have to build systems</p>
<p>that help us do the things that we do know about</p>
<p>that can then probe the unknowns that we know about.</p>
<p>But the unknown unknowns, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We could always know.</p>
<p>Nature is the one thing</p>
<p>that is infinitely able to surprise us.</p>
<p>So we should keep biological humans around</p>
<p>for a very, very, very long time.</p>
<p>Even after our immortal selves have transcended</p>
<p>and have gone off to explore other worlds,</p>
<p>gone to go communicate with the lifeforms living in the sun</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>for me, these seem like things that are going to happen.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t really question that,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna happen.</p>
<p>Assuming we don&rsquo;t completely destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>Is it possible to create an AI system</p>
<p>that you fall in love with and it falls in love with you</p>
<p>and you have a romantic relationship with it?</p>
<p>Or a deep friendship, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>I would hope that that is the design criteria</p>
<p>for any of these systems.</p>
<p>If we cannot have a meaningful relationship with it,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s still just a chunk of silicon.</p>
<p>So then what is meaningful?</p>
<p>Because back to sugar.</p>
<p>Well, sugar doesn&rsquo;t love you back, right?</p>
<p>So the computer has to love you back.</p>
<p>And what does love mean?</p>
<p>Well, in this context, for me, love,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a page from Alain de Botton.</p>
<p>Love means that it wants to help us</p>
<p>become the best version of ourselves.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful definition of love.</p>
<p>So what role does love play in the human condition</p>
<p>at the individual level and at the group level?</p>
<p>Because you were kind of saying that humans,</p>
<p>we should really consider humans</p>
<p>both at the individual and the group and the societal level.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in this whole thing?</p>
<p>We talked about sex, we talked about death,</p>
<p>thanks to the bacteria that invented it.</p>
<p>At which point did we invent love, by the way?</p>
<p>I mean, is that also?</p>
<p>No, I think love is the start of it all.</p>
<p>And the feelings of, and this gets sort of beyond</p>
<p>just romantic, sensual, whatever kind of things,</p>
<p>but actually genuine love as we have for another person.</p>
<p>Love as it would be used in a religious text, right?</p>
<p>I think that capacity to feel love</p>
<p>more than consciousness, that is the universal thing.</p>
<p>Our feeling of love is actually a sense</p>
<p>of that generativity.</p>
<p>When we can look at another person</p>
<p>and see that they can be something more than they are,</p>
<p>and more than just a pigeonhole we might stick them in.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s, in any religious text,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find voiced some concept of this,</p>
<p>that you should see the grace of God in the other person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re made in the spirit of the love</p>
<p>that God feels for his creation or her creation.</p>
<p>And so I think this thing is actually the root of it.</p>
<p>So I would say, I don&rsquo;t think molecules of water</p>
<p>feel consciousness, have consciousness,</p>
<p>but there is some proto micro quantum thing of love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the generativity when there&rsquo;s more energy</p>
<p>than what they need to maintain equilibrium.</p>
<p>And that when you sum it all up is something that leads to,</p>
<p>I mean, I had my mind blown one day as an undergrad</p>
<p>at the physics computer lab.</p>
<p>I logged in and when you log into bash for a long time,</p>
<p>there was a little fortune that would come out.</p>
<p>And it said, man was created by water</p>
<p>to carry itself uphill.</p>
<p>And I was logging into work on some problem set</p>
<p>and I logged in and I saw that and I just said,</p>
<p>son of a bitch, I just, I logged out</p>
<p>and I went to the coffee shop and I got a coffee</p>
<p>and I sat there on the quad and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not wrong and yet WTF, right?</p>
<p>So when you look at it that way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, yeah, okay, non equilibrium physics is a thing.</p>
<p>And so when we think about love,</p>
<p>when we think about these kinds of things, I would say</p>
<p>that in the modern day human condition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of talk about freedom and individual liberty</p>
<p>and rights and all these things,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s very Hegelian, it&rsquo;s very kind of following</p>
<p>from the Western philosophy of the individual as sacrosanct,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really couched I think the right way</p>
<p>because it should be how do we maximize people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to love each other, to love themselves first,</p>
<p>to love each other, their responsibilities</p>
<p>to the previous generation, to the future generations.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of things</p>
<p>that should be our design criteria, right?</p>
<p>Those should be what we start with to then come up</p>
<p>with the philosophies of self and of rights</p>
<p>and responsibilities, but that love being at the center</p>
<p>of it, I think when we design systems for cognition,</p>
<p>it should absolutely be built that way.</p>
<p>I think if we simply focus on efficiency and productivity,</p>
<p>these kind of very industrial era,</p>
<p>all the things that Marx had issues with, right?</p>
<p>Those, that&rsquo;s a way to go and really I think go off</p>
<p>the deep end in the wrong way.</p>
<p>So one of the interesting consequences of thinking of life</p>
<p>in this hierarchical way of an individual human</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s groups and there&rsquo;s societies</p>
<p>is I believe that you believe that corporations are people.</p>
<p>So this is a kind of a politically dense idea,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>If we just throw politics aside,</p>
<p>if we throw all of that aside,</p>
<p>in which sense do you believe that corporations are people?</p>
<p>And how does love connect to that?</p>
<p>Right, so the belief is that groups of people</p>
<p>have some kind of higher level, I would say mesoscopic</p>
<p>claim to agency.</p>
<p>So where do I, let&rsquo;s start with this.</p>
<p>Most people would say, okay, individuals have claims</p>
<p>to agency and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Nations, we certainly act as if nations,</p>
<p>so at a very large, large scale,</p>
<p>nations have rights to sovereignty and agency.</p>
<p>Like everyone plays the game of modernity</p>
<p>as if that&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>We believe France is a thing,</p>
<p>we believe the United States is a thing.</p>
<p>But to say that groups of people at a smaller level</p>
<p>than that, like a family unit is the thing.</p>
<p>Well, in our laws, we actually do encode this concept.</p>
<p>I believe that in a relationship and a marriage, right,</p>
<p>one partner can sue for loss of consortium, right?</p>
<p>If someone breaks up the marriage or whatever.</p>
<p>So these are concepts that even in law,</p>
<p>we do respect that there is something about the union</p>
<p>and about the family.</p>
<p>So for me, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so weird to think</p>
<p>that groups of people have a right to,</p>
<p>a claim to rights and sovereignty of some degree.</p>
<p>I mean, we look at our clubs, we look at churches.</p>
<p>These are, we talk about these collectives of people</p>
<p>as if they have a real agency to them, and they do.</p>
<p>But I think if we take that one step further and say,</p>
<p>okay, they can accrue resources.</p>
<p>Well, yes, check, you know, and by law they can.</p>
<p>They can own land, they can engage in contracts,</p>
<p>they can do all these different kinds of things.</p>
<p>So we in legal terms support this idea</p>
<p>that groups of people have rights.</p>
<p>Where we go wrong on this stuff</p>
<p>is that the most popular version of this</p>
<p>is the for profit absentee owner corporation</p>
<p>that then is able to amass larger resources</p>
<p>than anyone else in the landscape, anything else,</p>
<p>any other entity of equivalent size.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to essentially bully around individuals,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s laborers, whether it&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>whose resources they want to capture.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also able to bully around</p>
<p>our system of representation,</p>
<p>which is still tied to individuals, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good that they, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re people, but they&rsquo;re assholes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that corporations as people</p>
<p>acting like assholes is a good thing.</p>
<p>But the idea that collectives and collections of people</p>
<p>that we should treat them philosophically</p>
<p>as having some agency and some mass,</p>
<p>at a mesoscopic level, I think that&rsquo;s an important thing</p>
<p>because one thing I do think we underappreciate sometimes</p>
<p>is the fact that relationships have relationships.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just individuals</p>
<p>having relationships with each other.</p>
<p>But if you have eight people seated around a table, right?</p>
<p>Each person has a relationship with each of the others</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>But then if it&rsquo;s four couples,</p>
<p>each couple also has a relationship</p>
<p>with each of the other couples, right?</p>
<p>The dyads do.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s couples, but one is the, you know,</p>
<p>father and mother older, and then, you know,</p>
<p>one of their children and their spouse,</p>
<p>that family unit of four has a relationship</p>
<p>with the other family unit of four.</p>
<p>So the idea that relationships have relationships</p>
<p>is something that we intuitively know</p>
<p>in navigating the social landscape,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not something I hear expressed like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not something that is,</p>
<p>I think, taken into account very well</p>
<p>when we design these kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I think the reason why I care a lot about this</p>
<p>is because I think the future of humanity</p>
<p>requires us to form better sense make,</p>
<p>collective sense making units at something, you know,</p>
<p>around Dunbar number, you know, half to five X Dunbar.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very different than right now</p>
<p>where we defer sense making</p>
<p>to massive aging zombie institutions.</p>
<p>Or we just do it ourselves.</p>
<p>Go it alone.</p>
<p>Go to the dark force of the internet by ourselves.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about agency,</p>
<p>I think maybe calling it a convenient fiction</p>
<p>at all these different levels.</p>
<p>So even at the human individual level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a fiction.</p>
<p>We all believe, because we are, like you said,</p>
<p>made of cells and cells are made of atoms.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a useful fiction.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s nations that seems to be a useful fiction,</p>
<p>but it seems like some fictions are better than others.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that argue</p>
<p>the fiction of nation is a bad idea.</p>
<p>One of them lives two doors down from me,</p>
<p>Michael Malice, he&rsquo;s an anarchist.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who are into meditation that believe the idea,</p>
<p>this useful fiction of agency of an individual</p>
<p>is a troublesome as well.</p>
<p>We need to let go of that in order to truly,</p>
<p>like to transcend, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what words you want to use,</p>
<p>but suffering or to elevate the experience of life.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of arguing that,</p>
<p>okay, so we have some of these useful fictions of agency.</p>
<p>We should add a stronger fiction that we tell ourselves</p>
<p>about the agency of groups in the hundreds</p>
<p>of the half a Dunbar&rsquo;s number, 5X Dunbar&rsquo;s number.</p>
<p>Yeah, something on that order.</p>
<p>And we call them fictions,</p>
<p>but really they&rsquo;re rules of the game, right?</p>
<p>Rules that we feel are fair or rules that we consent to.</p>
<p>Yeah, I always question the rules</p>
<p>when I lose like a monopoly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I usually question the rules.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m winning, I don&rsquo;t question the rules.</p>
<p>We should play a game Monopoly someday.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a trippy version of it that we could do.</p>
<p>What kind?</p>
<p>Contract Monopoly is introduced by a friend of mine to me</p>
<p>where you can write contracts on future earnings</p>
<p>or landing on various things.</p>
<p>And you can hand out like, you know,</p>
<p>you can land the first three times you land</p>
<p>in a park place, it&rsquo;s free or whatever.</p>
<p>And then you can start trading those contracts for money.</p>
<p>And then you create a human civilization</p>
<p>and somehow Bitcoin comes into it.</p>
<p>Okay, but some of these.</p>
<p>Actually, I bet if me and you and Eric sat down</p>
<p>to play a game Monopoly and we were to make NFTs</p>
<p>out of the contracts we wrote, we could make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I would never do it,</p>
<p>but I bet we could actually sell the NFTs around.</p>
<p>I have other ideas to make money that I could tell you</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all terrible ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, including cat videos on the internet.</p>
<p>Okay, but some of these rules of the game,</p>
<p>some of these fictions are,</p>
<p>it seems like they&rsquo;re better than others.</p>
<p>They have worked this far to cohere human,</p>
<p>to organize human collective action.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying something about,</p>
<p>especially this technological age</p>
<p>requires modified fictions, stories of agency.</p>
<p>Why the Dunbar number?</p>
<p>And also, you know, how do you select the group of people?</p>
<p>You know, Dunbar numbers, I think I have the sense</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s overused as a kind of law</p>
<p>that somehow we can have deep human connection at this scale.</p>
<p>Like some of it feels like an interface problem too.</p>
<p>It feels like if I have the right tools,</p>
<p>I can deeply connect with a larger number of people.</p>
<p>It just feels like there&rsquo;s a huge value</p>
<p>to interacting just in person, getting to share</p>
<p>traumatic experiences together,</p>
<p>beautiful experiences together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other experiences like that in the digital space</p>
<p>that you can share.</p>
<p>It just feels like Dunbar&rsquo;s number</p>
<p>could be expanded significantly,</p>
<p>perhaps not to the level of millions and billions,</p>
<p>but it feels like it could be expanded.</p>
<p>So how do we find the right interface, you think,</p>
<p>for having a little bit of a collective here</p>
<p>that has agency?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that there&rsquo;s many different ways</p>
<p>that we can build trust with each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My friend Joe Edelman talks about a few different ways</p>
<p>that, you know, mutual appreciation, trustful conflict,</p>
<p>just experiencing something like, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a variety of different things that we can do,</p>
<p>but all those things take time and you have to be present.</p>
<p>The less present you are, I mean, there&rsquo;s just, again,</p>
<p>a no free lunch principle here.</p>
<p>The less present you are, the more of them you can do,</p>
<p>but then the less connection you build.</p>
<p>So I think there is sort of a human capacity issue</p>
<p>around some of these things.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, if we can use certain technologies,</p>
<p>so for instance, if I write a little monograph</p>
<p>on my view of the world,</p>
<p>you read it asynchronously at some point,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, wow, Peter, this is great.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s mine.</p>
<p>I read it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow, Lex, this is awesome.</p>
<p>We can be friends without having to spend 10 years,</p>
<p>you know, figuring all this stuff out together.</p>
<p>We just read each other&rsquo;s thing and be like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, this guy&rsquo;s exactly in my wheelhouse</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>And we can then, you know, connect just a few times a year</p>
<p>and maintain a high trust relationship.</p>
<p>It can be expanded a little bit,</p>
<p>but it also requires,</p>
<p>these things are not all technological in nature.</p>
<p>It requires the individual themselves</p>
<p>to have a certain level of capacity,</p>
<p>to have a certain lack of neuroticism, right?</p>
<p>If you want to use like the ocean big five sort of model,</p>
<p>people have to be pretty centered.</p>
<p>The less centered you are,</p>
<p>the fewer authentic connections you can really build</p>
<p>for a particular unit of time.</p>
<p>It just takes more time.</p>
<p>Other people have to put up with your crap.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s just a lot of the stuff</p>
<p>that you have to deal with</p>
<p>if you are not so well balanced, right?</p>
<p>So yes, we can help people get better</p>
<p>to where they can develop more relationships faster,</p>
<p>and then you can maybe expand Dunbar number by quite a bit,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to do it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be hard to get it beyond 10X,</p>
<p>kind of the rough swag of what it is, you know?</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t you think that AI systems could be an addition</p>
<p>to the Dunbar&rsquo;s number?</p>
<p>So like why?</p>
<p>Do you count as one system or multiple AI systems?</p>
<p>Multiple AI systems.</p>
<p>So I do believe that AI systems,</p>
<p>for them to integrate into human society as it is now,</p>
<p>have to have a sense of agency.</p>
<p>So there has to be a individual</p>
<p>because otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t relate to them.</p>
<p>We could engage certain kinds of individuals</p>
<p>to make sense of them for us and be almost like,</p>
<p>did you ever watch Star Trek?</p>
<p>Like Voyager, like there&rsquo;s the Volta,</p>
<p>who are like the interfaces,</p>
<p>the ambassadors for the Dominion.</p>
<p>We may have ambassadors that speak</p>
<p>on behalf of these systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like the Mentats of Dune, maybe,</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>I mean, we already have this to some extent.</p>
<p>If you look at the biggest sort of,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say AI system,</p>
<p>but the biggest cybernetic system in the world</p>
<p>is the financial markets.</p>
<p>It runs outside of any individual&rsquo;s control,</p>
<p>and you have an entire stack of people on Wall Street,</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts to CNBC reporters, whatever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all helping to communicate what does this mean?</p>
<p>You know, like Jim Cramer,</p>
<p>like coming around and yelling and stuff.</p>
<p>Like all of these people are part of that lowering</p>
<p>of the complexity there to meet sense,</p>
<p>you know, to help do sense making for people</p>
<p>at whatever capacity they&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see this changing with AI systems.</p>
<p>I think you would have ringside commentators</p>
<p>talking about all this stuff</p>
<p>that this AI system is trying to do over here, over here,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually a super intelligence.</p>
<p>So if you want to talk about humans interfacing,</p>
<p>making first contact with the super intelligence,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already there.</p>
<p>We do it pretty poorly.</p>
<p>And if you look at the gradient of power and money,</p>
<p>what happens is the people closest to it</p>
<p>will absolutely exploit their distance</p>
<p>for personal financial gain.</p>
<p>So we should look at that and be like,</p>
<p>oh, well, that&rsquo;s probably what the future</p>
<p>will look like as well.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already doing this kind of thing.</p>
<p>So in the future, we can have AI systems,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still gonna have to trust people</p>
<p>to bridge the sense making gap to them.</p>
<p>See, I just feel like there could be</p>
<p>like millions of AI systems that have,</p>
<p>have agencies, you have,</p>
<p>when you say one super intelligence,</p>
<p>super intelligence in that context means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to solve particular problems extremely well.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some aspect of human like intelligence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s necessary to be integrated into human society.</p>
<p>So not financial markets,</p>
<p>not sort of weather prediction systems,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know, logistics optimization.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more referring to things that you interact with</p>
<p>on the intellectual level.</p>
<p>And that I think requires,</p>
<p>there has to be a backstory.</p>
<p>There has to be a personality.</p>
<p>I believe it has to fear its own mortality in a genuine way.</p>
<p>Like there has to be all,</p>
<p>many of the elements that we humans experience</p>
<p>that are fundamental to the human condition,</p>
<p>because otherwise we would not have</p>
<p>a deep connection with it.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think having a deep connection with it</p>
<p>is necessarily going to stop us from building a thing</p>
<p>that has quite an alien intelligence aspect here.</p>
<p>So the other kind of alien intelligence on this planet</p>
<p>is the octopuses or octopodes</p>
<p>or whatever you wanna call them.</p>
<p>Octopi. Octopi, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little controversy</p>
<p>as to what the plural is, I guess.</p>
<p>But an octopus. I look forward to your letters.</p>
<p>Yeah, an octopus,</p>
<p>it really acts as a collective intelligence</p>
<p>of eight intelligent arms, right?</p>
<p>Its arms have a tremendous amount of neural density to them.</p>
<p>And I see if we can build,</p>
<p>I mean, just let&rsquo;s go with what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>If we build a singular intelligence</p>
<p>that interfaces with humans that has a sense of agency</p>
<p>so it can run the cybernetic loop</p>
<p>and develop its own theory of mind</p>
<p>as well as its theory of action,</p>
<p>all these things, I agree with you</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the necessary components</p>
<p>to build a real intelligence, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be something at stake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta make a decision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta then run the OODA loop.</p>
<p>Okay, so we build one of those.</p>
<p>Well, if we can build one of those,</p>
<p>we can probably build 5 million of them.</p>
<p>So we build 5 million of them.</p>
<p>And if their cognitive systems are already digitized</p>
<p>and already kind of there,</p>
<p>we stick an antenna on each of them,</p>
<p>bring it all back to a hive mind</p>
<p>that maybe doesn&rsquo;t make all the individual decisions</p>
<p>for them, but treats each one</p>
<p>as almost like a neuronal input</p>
<p>of a much higher bandwidth and fidelity,</p>
<p>going back to a central system</p>
<p>that is then able to perceive much broader dynamics</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>In the same way that a phased array radar, right?</p>
<p>You think about how phased array radar works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sensitivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just radars, and then it&rsquo;s hypersensitivity</p>
<p>and really great timing between all of them.</p>
<p>And with a flat array,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as good as a curved radar dish, right?</p>
<p>So with these things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a phased array of cybernetic systems</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll give the centralized intelligence</p>
<p>much, much better, a much higher fidelity understanding</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s actually happening in the environment.</p>
<p>But the more power,</p>
<p>the more understanding the central super intelligence has,</p>
<p>the dumber the individual like fingers</p>
<p>of this intelligence are, I think.</p>
<p>I think you&hellip;</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>In my sense&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see what has to be.</p>
<p>This argument, there has to be,</p>
<p>the experience of the individual agent</p>
<p>has to have the full richness of the human like experience.</p>
<p>You have to be able to be driving the car in the rain,</p>
<p>listening to Bruce Springsteen,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden break out in tears</p>
<p>because remembering something that happened to you</p>
<p>in high school.</p>
<p>We can implant those memories</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s really needed.</p>
<p>But no, I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p>No, but the central agency,</p>
<p>like I guess I&rsquo;m saying for, in my view,</p>
<p>for intelligence to be born,</p>
<p>you have to have a decentralization.</p>
<p>Like each one has to struggle and reach.</p>
<p>So each one in excess of energy has to reach for order</p>
<p>as opposed to a central place doing so.</p>
<p>Have you ever read like some sci fi</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like hive minds?</p>
<p>Like the Wernher Vinge, I think has one of these.</p>
<p>And then some of the stuff from the Commonwealth Saga,</p>
<p>the idea that you&rsquo;re an individual,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re connected with like a few other individuals</p>
<p>telepathically as well.</p>
<p>And together you form a swarm.</p>
<p>So if you are, I ask you,</p>
<p>what do you think is the experience of if you are like,</p>
<p>well, a Borg, right?</p>
<p>If you are one, if you&rsquo;re part of this hive mind,</p>
<p>outside of all the aesthetics, forget the aesthetics,</p>
<p>internally, what is your experience like?</p>
<p>Because I have a theory as to what that looks like.</p>
<p>The one question I have for you about that experience is</p>
<p>how much is there a feeling of freedom, of free will?</p>
<p>Because I obviously as a human, very unbiased,</p>
<p>but also somebody who values freedom and biased,</p>
<p>it feels like the experience of freedom is essential for</p>
<p>trying stuff out, to being creative</p>
<p>and doing something truly novel, which is at the core of.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I don&rsquo;t think you have to lose any freedom</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in that mode.</p>
<p>Because I think what happens is we think,</p>
<p>we still think, I mean, you&rsquo;re still thinking about this</p>
<p>in a sense of a top down command and control hierarchy,</p>
<p>which is not what it has to be at all.</p>
<p>I think the experience, so I&rsquo;ll just show by cards here.</p>
<p>I think the experience of being a robot in that robot swarm,</p>
<p>a robot who has agency over their own local environment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing sense making</p>
<p>and reporting it back to the hive mind,</p>
<p>I think that robot&rsquo;s experience would be one,</p>
<p>when the hive mind is working well,</p>
<p>it would be an experience of like talking to God, right?</p>
<p>That you essentially are reporting to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sort of saying, here&rsquo;s what I see.</p>
<p>I think this is what&rsquo;s gonna happen over here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go do this thing.</p>
<p>Because I think if I&rsquo;m gonna do this,</p>
<p>this will make this change happen in the environment.</p>
<p>And then God, she may tell you, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And in fact, your brothers and sisters will join you</p>
<p>to help make this go better, right?</p>
<p>And then she can let your brothers and sisters know,</p>
<p>hey, Peter&rsquo;s gonna go do this thing.</p>
<p>Would you like to help him?</p>
<p>Because we think that this will make this thing go better.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, yes, we&rsquo;ll help him.</p>
<p>So the whole thing could be actually very emergent.</p>
<p>The sense of, what does it feel like to be a cell</p>
<p>and a network that is alive, that is generative.</p>
<p>And I think actually the feeling is serendipity.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s random order, not random disorder or chaos,</p>
<p>but random order, just when you need it to hear Bruce Springsteen,</p>
<p>you turn on the radio and bam, it&rsquo;s Bruce Springsteen, right?</p>
<p>That feeling of serendipity, I feel like,</p>
<p>this is a bit of a flight of fancy,</p>
<p>but every cell in your body must have,</p>
<p>what does it feel like to be a cell in your body?</p>
<p>When it needs sugar, there&rsquo;s sugar.</p>
<p>When it needs oxygen, there&rsquo;s just oxygen.</p>
<p>Now, when it needs to go and do its work</p>
<p>and pull like as one of your muscle fibers, right?</p>
<p>It does its work and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It contributes to the cause, right?</p>
<p>So this is all, again, a flight of fancy,</p>
<p>but I think as we extrapolate up,</p>
<p>what does it feel like to be an independent individual</p>
<p>with some bounded sense of freedom?</p>
<p>All sense of freedom is actually bounded,</p>
<p>but it was a bounded sense of freedom</p>
<p>that still lives within a network that has order to it.</p>
<p>And I feel like it has to be a feeling of serendipity.</p>
<p>So the cell, there&rsquo;s a feeling of serendipity, even though.</p>
<p>It has no way of explaining why it&rsquo;s getting oxygen</p>
<p>and sugar when it gets it.</p>
<p>So you have to, each individual component has to be too dumb</p>
<p>to understand the big picture.</p>
<p>No, the big picture is bigger than what it can understand.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that an essential characteristic</p>
<p>of the individual is to be too dumb</p>
<p>to understand the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Like not dumb necessarily,</p>
<p>but limited in its capacity to understand.</p>
<p>Because the moment you understand,</p>
<p>I feel like that leads to, if you tell me now</p>
<p>that there are some bigger intelligence</p>
<p>controlling everything I do,</p>
<p>intelligence broadly defined, meaning like,</p>
<p>you know, even the Sam Harris thing, there&rsquo;s no free will.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m smart enough to truly understand that that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna, I don&rsquo;t know if I.</p>
<p>We have philosophical breakdown, right?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re in the West and we&rsquo;re pumped full of this stuff</p>
<p>of like, you are a golden, fully free individual</p>
<p>with all your freedoms and all your liberties</p>
<p>and go grab a gun and shoot whatever you want to.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s actually, you don&rsquo;t actually have a lot of these,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not unconstrained,</p>
<p>but the areas where you can manifest agency,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re free to do those things.</p>
<p>You can say whatever you want on this podcast.</p>
<p>You can create a podcast, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, I mean, you have a lot of this kind of freedom,</p>
<p>but even as you&rsquo;re doing this, you are actually,</p>
<p>I guess where the denouement of this is that</p>
<p>we are already intelligent agents in such a system, right?</p>
<p>In that one of these like robots</p>
<p>of one of 5 million little swarm robots</p>
<p>or one of the Borg,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just posting on internal bulletin board.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe the Borg cube</p>
<p>is just a giant Facebook machine floating in space</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s just posting on there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just posting really fast and like, oh yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the metaverse now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called the metaverse, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the enterprise.</p>
<p>Maybe we should all go shoot it.</p>
<p>Yeah, everyone upvotes and they&rsquo;re gonna go shoot it, right?</p>
<p>But we already are part of a human online</p>
<p>collaborative environment</p>
<p>and collaborative sensemaking system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very good yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got the overhangs of zombie sensemaking institutions</p>
<p>all over it, but as that washes away</p>
<p>and as we get better at this,</p>
<p>we are going to see humanity improving</p>
<p>at speeds that are unthinkable in the past.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not because anyone&rsquo;s freedoms were limited.</p>
<p>In fact, the open source,</p>
<p>and we started this with open source software, right?</p>
<p>The collaboration, what the internet surfaced</p>
<p>was the ability for people all over the world</p>
<p>to collaborate and produce some of the most</p>
<p>foundational software that&rsquo;s in use today, right?</p>
<p>That entire ecosystem was created</p>
<p>by collaborators all over the place.</p>
<p>So these online kind of swarm kind of things</p>
<p>are not novel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;m just suggesting that future AI systems,</p>
<p>if you can build one smart system,</p>
<p>you have no reason not to build multiple.</p>
<p>If you build multiple,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason not to integrate them all</p>
<p>into a collective sensemaking substrate.</p>
<p>And that thing will certainly have immersion intelligence</p>
<p>that none of the individuals</p>
<p>and probably not any of the human designers</p>
<p>will be able to really put a bow around and explain.</p>
<p>But in some sense, would that AI system</p>
<p>still be able to go like rural Texas,</p>
<p>buy a ranch, go off the grid, go full survivalist?</p>
<p>Like, can you disconnect from the hive mind?</p>
<p>You may not want to.</p>
<p>So to be ineffective, to be intelligent.</p>
<p>You have access to way more intelligence capability</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re plugged into five million other</p>
<p>really, really smart cyborgs.</p>
<p>Why would you leave?</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s a word control that comes to mind.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t feel like control,</p>
<p>like overbearing control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just knowledge.</p>
<p>I think systems, well, this is to your point.</p>
<p>I mean, look at how much,</p>
<p>how uncomfortable you are with this concept, right?</p>
<p>I think systems that feel like overbearing control</p>
<p>will not evolutionarily win out.</p>
<p>I think systems that give their individual elements</p>
<p>the feeling of serendipity and the feeling of agency</p>
<p>that that will, those systems will win.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not to say that there will not be</p>
<p>emergent higher level order on top of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing, that&rsquo;s the philosophical breakdown</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re staring right at,</p>
<p>which is in the Western mind,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a very sharp delineation</p>
<p>between explicit control,</p>
<p>Cartesian, like what is the vector?</p>
<p>Where is the position?</p>
<p>Where is it going?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely deterministic.</p>
<p>And kind of this idea that things emerge.</p>
<p>Everything we see is the emergent patterns</p>
<p>of other things.</p>
<p>And there is agency when there&rsquo;s extra energy.</p>
<p>So you have spoken about a kind of meaning crisis</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>But it feels like since we invented sex and death,</p>
<p>we broadly speaking,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been searching for a kind of meaning.</p>
<p>So it feels like a human civilization</p>
<p>has been going through a meaning crisis</p>
<p>of different flavors throughout its history.</p>
<p>Why is, how is this particular meaning crisis different?</p>
<p>Or is it really a crisis and it wasn&rsquo;t previously?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>A lot of human history,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t so much a meaning crisis.</p>
<p>There was just a like food</p>
<p>and not getting eaten by bears crisis, right?</p>
<p>Once you get to a point where you can make food,</p>
<p>there was the like not getting killed</p>
<p>by other humans crisis.</p>
<p>So sitting around wondering what is it all about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a relatively recent luxury.</p>
<p>And to some extent, the meaning crisis coming out of that</p>
<p>is precisely because, well, it&rsquo;s not precisely because,</p>
<p>I believe that meaning is the consequence of</p>
<p>when we make consequential decisions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tied to agency, right?</p>
<p>When we make consequential decisions,</p>
<p>that generates meaning.</p>
<p>So if we make a lot of decisions,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t see the consequences of them,</p>
<p>then it feels like what was the point, right?</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s all these big things</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t see the consequences of,</p>
<p>right, but if there&rsquo;s all these big things happening,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just along for the ride,</p>
<p>then it also does not feel very meaningful.</p>
<p>Meaning, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>this is my working definition of CERCA 2021,</p>
<p>is generally the result of a person</p>
<p>making a consequential decision,</p>
<p>acting on it and then seeing the consequences of it.</p>
<p>So historically, just when humans are in survival mode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making consequential decisions all the time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a lack of meaning</p>
<p>because like you either got eaten or you didn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>You got some food and that&rsquo;s great, you feel good.</p>
<p>Like these are all consequential decisions.</p>
<p>Only in the post fossil fuel and industrial revolution</p>
<p>could we create a massive leisure class.</p>
<p>I could sit around not being threatened by bears,</p>
<p>not starving to death,</p>
<p>making decisions somewhat,</p>
<p>but a lot of times not seeing the consequences</p>
<p>of any decisions they make.</p>
<p>The general sort of sense of anomie,</p>
<p>I think that is the French term for it,</p>
<p>in the wake of the consumer society,</p>
<p>in the wake of mass media telling everyone,</p>
<p>hey, choosing between Hermes and Chanel</p>
<p>is a meaningful decision.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what either of those mean.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re high end luxury purses and crap like that.</p>
<p>But the point is that we give people the idea</p>
<p>that consumption is meaning,</p>
<p>that making a choice of this team versus that team,</p>
<p>spectating has meaning.</p>
<p>So we produce all of these different things</p>
<p>that are as if meaning, right?</p>
<p>But really making a decision that has no consequences for us.</p>
<p>And so that creates the meaning crisis.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re saying choosing between Chanel</p>
<p>and the other one has no consequence.</p>
<p>I mean, why is one more meaningful than the other?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s more meaningful than the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you make a decision between these two brands</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re told this brand will make me look better</p>
<p>in front of other people.</p>
<p>If I buy this brand of car,</p>
<p>if I wear that brand of apparel, right?</p>
<p>Like a lot of decisions we make are around consumption,</p>
<p>but consumption by itself doesn&rsquo;t actually yield meaning.</p>
<p>Gaining social status does provide meaning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why in this era of abundant production,</p>
<p>so many things turn into status games.</p>
<p>The NFT kind of explosion is a similar kind of thing.</p>
<p>Everywhere there are status games</p>
<p>because we just have so much excess production.</p>
<p>But aren&rsquo;t those status games a source of meaning?</p>
<p>Like why do the games we play have to be grounded</p>
<p>in physical reality like they are</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to run away from lions?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we, in this virtuality world, on social media,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t we play the games on social media,</p>
<p>even the dark ones?</p>
<p>Right, we can, we can.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s creating a meaning crisis.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a meaning crisis</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s two aspects of it.</p>
<p>Number one, playing those kinds of status games</p>
<p>oftentimes requires destroying the planet</p>
<p>because it ties to consumption,</p>
<p>consuming the latest and greatest version of a thing,</p>
<p>buying the latest limited edition sneaker</p>
<p>and throwing out all the old ones.</p>
<p>Maybe it keeps in the old ones,</p>
<p>but the amount of sneakers we have to cut up</p>
<p>and destroy every year</p>
<p>to create artificial scarcity for the next generation, right?</p>
<p>This is kind of stuff that&rsquo;s not great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not great at all.</p>
<p>So conspicuous consumption fueling status games</p>
<p>is really bad for the planet, not sustainable.</p>
<p>The second thing is you can play these kinds of status games,</p>
<p>but then what it does is it renders you captured</p>
<p>to the virtual environment.</p>
<p>The status games that really wealthy people are playing</p>
<p>are all around the hard resources</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re gonna build the factories,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have the fuel in the rare earths</p>
<p>to make the next generation of robots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re then going to run game,</p>
<p>run circles around you and your children.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another reason not to play</p>
<p>those virtual status games.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying ultimately the big picture game is won</p>
<p>by people who have access or control</p>
<p>over actual hard resources.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t see a society</p>
<p>where most of the games are played in the virtual space.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be captured in the physical space.</p>
<p>It all builds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the stack of human being, right?</p>
<p>If you only play the game at the cultural</p>
<p>and then intellectual level,</p>
<p>then the people with the hard resources</p>
<p>and access to layer zero physical are going to own you.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t money not connected to,</p>
<p>or less and less connected to hard resources</p>
<p>and money still seems to work?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a virtual technology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different kinds of money.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that some of the stuff is able</p>
<p>to go a little unhinged is because the big sovereignties</p>
<p>where one spends money and uses money</p>
<p>and plays money games and inflates money,</p>
<p>their ability to adjudicate the physical resources</p>
<p>and hard resources and the resources</p>
<p>and hard resources on land and things like that,</p>
<p>those have not been challenged in a very long time.</p>
<p>So, you know, we went off the gold standard.</p>
<p>Most money is not connected to physical resources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>And that idea is very closely connected to status.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also tied to like, it&rsquo;s actually tied to law.</p>
<p>It is tied to some physical hard things</p>
<p>so you have to pay your taxes.</p>
<p>Yes, so it&rsquo;s always at the end going to be connected</p>
<p>to the blockchain of physical reality.</p>
<p>So in the case of law and taxes, it&rsquo;s connected to government</p>
<p>and government is what violence is the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing with stacks of devil&rsquo;s advocates here</p>
<p>and popping one devil off the stack at a time.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t ultimately, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be connected to physical reality,</p>
<p>but just because people control the physical reality,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean the status.</p>
<p>I guess LeBron James in theory could make more money</p>
<p>than the owners of the teams in theory.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s a virtual idea.</p>
<p>So somebody else constructed a game</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re playing in the virtual space of the game.</p>
<p>So it just feels like there could be games where status,</p>
<p>we build realities that give us meaning in the virtual space.</p>
<p>I can imagine such things being possible.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, okay, so I see what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I think I see what you&rsquo;re saying there</p>
<p>with the idea there, I mean, we&rsquo;ll take the LeBron James side</p>
<p>and put in like some YouTube influencer.</p>
<p>Yes, sure.</p>
<p>So the YouTube influencer, it is status games,</p>
<p>but at a certain level, it precipitates into real dollars</p>
<p>and into like, well, you look at Mr. Beast, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like sending off half a million dollars</p>
<p>worth of fireworks or something, right?</p>
<p>Not a YouTube video.</p>
<p>And also like saving, like saving trees and so on.</p>
<p>Sure, right, trying to find a million trees</p>
<p>with Mark Rober or whatever it was.</p>
<p>Yeah, like it&rsquo;s not that those kinds of games</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t lead to real consequences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that for the vast majority of people in consumer culture,</p>
<p>they are incented by the, I would say mostly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about middle class consumers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re incented by advertisements,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re scented by their memetic environment</p>
<p>to treat the purchasing of certain things,</p>
<p>the need to buy the latest model, whatever,</p>
<p>the need to appear, however,</p>
<p>the need to pursue status games as a driver of meaning.</p>
<p>And my point would be that it&rsquo;s a very hollow</p>
<p>driver of meaning.</p>
<p>And that is what creates a meaning crisis.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like eating a lot of empty calories, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it tasted good going down, a lot of sugar,</p>
<p>but man, it did not, it was not enough protein</p>
<p>to help build your muscles.</p>
<p>And you kind of feel that in your gut.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, I mean, so all this stuff aside</p>
<p>and setting aside our discussion on currency,</p>
<p>which I hope we get back to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I mean about the meaning crisis,</p>
<p>part of it being created by the fact that we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not encouraged to have more and more</p>
<p>direct relationships.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually alienated from relating to,</p>
<p>even our family members sometimes, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re encouraged to relate to brands.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re encouraged to relate to these kinds of things</p>
<p>that then tell us to do things</p>
<p>that are really of low consequence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the meaning crisis comes from.</p>
<p>So the role of technology in this,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s somebody you mentioned who&rsquo;s Jacques,</p>
<p>his view of technology, he warns about the towering piles</p>
<p>of technique, which I guess is a broad idea of technology.</p>
<p>So I think, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong for him,</p>
<p>technology is bad at moving away from human nature</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s ultimately is destructive.</p>
<p>My question, broadly speaking, this meaning crisis,</p>
<p>can technology, what are the pros and cons of technology?</p>
<p>Can it be a good?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it can be.</p>
<p>I certainly think it can be a good thing.</p>
<p>Can it be a good? Yeah, I think it can be.</p>
<p>I certainly draw on some of Alol&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>and I think some of them are pretty good.</p>
<p>But the way he defines technique is,</p>
<p>well, also Simondon as well.</p>
<p>I mean, he speaks to the general mentality of efficiency,</p>
<p>homogenized processes, homogenized production,</p>
<p>homogenized labor to produce homogenized artifacts</p>
<p>that then are not actually,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t sit well in the environment.</p>
<p>Essentially, you can think of it as the antonym of craft.</p>
<p>Whereas a craftsman will come to a problem,</p>
<p>maybe a piece of wood and they make into a chair.</p>
<p>It may be a site to build a house or build a stable</p>
<p>or build whatever.</p>
<p>And they will consider how to bring various things in</p>
<p>to build something well contextualized</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in right relationship with that environment.</p>
<p>But the way we have driven technology</p>
<p>over the last 100 and 150 years is not that at all.</p>
<p>It is how can we make sure the input materials</p>
<p>are homogenized, cut to the same size,</p>
<p>diluted and doped to exactly the right alloy concentrations.</p>
<p>How do we create machines that then consume exactly</p>
<p>the right kind of energy to be able to run</p>
<p>at this high speed to stamp out the same parts,</p>
<p>which then go out the door,</p>
<p>everyone gets the same tickle of Mielmo.</p>
<p>And the reason why everyone wants it</p>
<p>is because we have broadcasts that tells everyone</p>
<p>this is the cool thing.</p>
<p>So we homogenize demand, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like Baudrillard and other critiques</p>
<p>of modernity coming from that direction,</p>
<p>the situation lists as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that their point is that at this point in time,</p>
<p>consumption is the thing that drives</p>
<p>a lot of the economic stuff, not the need,</p>
<p>but the need to consume and build status games on top.</p>
<p>So we have homogenized, when we discovered,</p>
<p>I think this is really like Bernays and stuff, right?</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, we discovered we can create,</p>
<p>we can create demand, we can create desire</p>
<p>in a way that was not possible before</p>
<p>because of broadcast media.</p>
<p>And not only do we create desire,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t create a desire for each person</p>
<p>to connect to some bespoke thing,</p>
<p>to build a relationship with their neighbor or their spouse.</p>
<p>We are telling them, you need to consume this brand,</p>
<p>you need to drive this vehicle,</p>
<p>you gotta listen to this music,</p>
<p>have you heard this, have you seen this movie, right?</p>
<p>So creating homogenized demand makes it really cheap</p>
<p>to create homogenized product.</p>
<p>And now you have economics of scale.</p>
<p>So we make the same tickle me Elmo,</p>
<p>give it to all the kids and all the kids are like,</p>
<p>hey, I got a tickle me Elmo, right?</p>
<p>So this is ultimately where this ties in then</p>
<p>to runaway hypercapitalism is that we then,</p>
<p>capitalism is always looking for growth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always looking for growth</p>
<p>and growth only happens at the margins.</p>
<p>So you have to squeeze more and more demand out.</p>
<p>You gotta make it cheaper and cheaper</p>
<p>to make the same thing,</p>
<p>but tell everyone they&rsquo;re still getting meaning from it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still like, this is still your tickle me Elmo, right?</p>
<p>And we see little bits of this dripping critiques</p>
<p>of this dripping in popular culture.</p>
<p>You see it sometimes it&rsquo;s when Buzz Lightyear</p>
<p>walks into the thing, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh my God, at the toy store, I&rsquo;m just a toy.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s millions of other,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s hundreds of other Buzz Lightyear&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like me, right?</p>
<p>That is, I think, a fun Pixar critique</p>
<p>on this homogenization dynamic.</p>
<p>I agree with you on most of the things you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m playing devil&rsquo;s advocate here,</p>
<p>but this homogenized machine of capitalism</p>
<p>is also the thing that is able to fund,</p>
<p>if channeled correctly, innovation, invention,</p>
<p>and development of totally new things</p>
<p>that in the best possible world,</p>
<p>create all kinds of new experiences that can enrich lives,</p>
<p>the quality of lives for all kinds of people.</p>
<p>So isn&rsquo;t this the machine</p>
<p>that actually enables the experiences</p>
<p>and more and more experiences that will then give meaning?</p>
<p>It has done that to some extent.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not all good or bad in my perspective.</p>
<p>We can always look backwards</p>
<p>and offer a critique of the path we&rsquo;ve taken</p>
<p>to get to this point in time.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a different, that&rsquo;s somewhat different</p>
<p>and informs the discussion,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s somewhat different than the question</p>
<p>of where do we go in the future, right?</p>
<p>Is this still the same rocket we need to ride</p>
<p>to get to the next point?</p>
<p>Will it even get us to the next point?</p>
<p>Well, how does this, so you&rsquo;re predicting the future,</p>
<p>how does it go wrong in your view?</p>
<p>We have the mechanisms,</p>
<p>we have now explored enough technologies</p>
<p>to where we can actually, I think, sustainably produce</p>
<p>what most people in the world need to live.</p>
<p>We have also created the infrastructures</p>
<p>to allow continued research and development</p>
<p>of additional science and medicine</p>
<p>and various other kinds of things.</p>
<p>The organizing principles that we use</p>
<p>to govern all these things today have been,</p>
<p>a lot of them have been just inherited</p>
<p>from honestly medieval times.</p>
<p>Some of them have refactored a little bit</p>
<p>in the industrial era,</p>
<p>but a lot of these modes of organizing people</p>
<p>are deeply problematic.</p>
<p>And furthermore, they&rsquo;re rooted in,</p>
<p>I think, a very industrial mode perspective on human labor.</p>
<p>And this is one of those things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go back to the open source thing.</p>
<p>There was a point in time when,</p>
<p>well, let me ask you this.</p>
<p>If you look at the core SciPy sort of collection of libraries,</p>
<p>so SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s iPython Notebook, let&rsquo;s throw pandas in there,</p>
<p>scikit learn, a few of these things.</p>
<p>How much value do you think, economic value,</p>
<p>would you say they drive in the world today?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the fascinating things</p>
<p>about talking to you and Travis is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a measure, it&rsquo;s like a&hellip;</p>
<p>At least a billion dollars a day, maybe?</p>
<p>A billion dollars, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s similar question of like,</p>
<p>how much value does Wikipedia create?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all of it, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you look at it,</p>
<p>all of it, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you look at our systems,</p>
<p>when you do a Google search, right?</p>
<p>Now, some of that stuff runs through TensorFlow,</p>
<p>but when you look at Siri,</p>
<p>when you do credit card transaction fraud,</p>
<p>like just everything, right?</p>
<p>Every intelligence agency under the sun,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using some aspect of these kinds of tools.</p>
<p>So I would say that these create billions of dollars</p>
<p>of value.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean like direct use of tools</p>
<p>that leverage this data?</p>
<p>Yes, direct, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, even that&rsquo;s billions a day, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, easily, I think.</p>
<p>Like the things they could not do</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t have these tools, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s billions of dollars a day, great.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s about right.</p>
<p>Now, if we take, how many people did it take</p>
<p>to make that, right?</p>
<p>And there was a point in time, not anymore,</p>
<p>but there was a point in time when they could fit</p>
<p>in a van.</p>
<p>I could have fit them in my Mercedes winter, right?</p>
<p>And so if you look at that, like, holy crap,</p>
<p>literally a van of maybe a dozen people</p>
<p>could create value to the tune of billions of dollars a day.</p>
<p>What lesson do you draw from that?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>What can we do to do more of that?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s open source.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;ve talked about this in other environments is</p>
<p>when we use generative participatory crowdsourced</p>
<p>approaches, we unlock human potential</p>
<p>at a level that is better than what capitalism can do.</p>
<p>I would challenge anyone to go and try to hire</p>
<p>the right 12 people in the world</p>
<p>to build that entire stack</p>
<p>the way those 12 people did that, right?</p>
<p>They would be very, very hard pressed to do that.</p>
<p>If a hedge fund could just hire a dozen people</p>
<p>and create like something that is worth</p>
<p>billions of dollars a day,</p>
<p>every single one of them would be racing to do it, right?</p>
<p>But finding the right people,</p>
<p>fostering the right collaborations,</p>
<p>getting it adopted by the right other people</p>
<p>to then refine it,</p>
<p>that is a thing that was organic in nature.</p>
<p>That took crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>That took a lot of the open source ethos</p>
<p>and it took the right kinds of people, right?</p>
<p>Now those people who started that said,</p>
<p>I need to have a part of a multi billion dollar a day</p>
<p>sort of enterprise.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m doing this cool thing</p>
<p>to solve my problem for my friends, right?</p>
<p>So the point of telling the story</p>
<p>is to say that our way of thinking about value,</p>
<p>our way of thinking about allocation of resources,</p>
<p>our ways of thinking about property rights</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things,</p>
<p>they come from finite game, scarcity mentality,</p>
<p>medieval institutions.</p>
<p>As we are now entering,</p>
<p>to some extent we&rsquo;re sort of in a post scarcity era,</p>
<p>although some people are hoarding a whole lot of stuff.</p>
<p>We are at a point where if not now soon,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be in a post scarcity era.</p>
<p>The question of how we allocate resources</p>
<p>has to be revisited at a fundamental level</p>
<p>because the kind of software these people built,</p>
<p>the modalities that those human ecologies</p>
<p>that built that software,</p>
<p>it treats offers unproperty.</p>
<p>Actually sharing creates value.</p>
<p>Restricting and forking reduces value.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s different than any other physical resource</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve ever dealt with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different than how most corporations</p>
<p>treat software IP, right?</p>
<p>So if treating software in this way</p>
<p>created this much value so efficiently, so cheaply,</p>
<p>because feeding a dozen people for 10 years</p>
<p>is really cheap, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason I care about this right now</p>
<p>is because looking forward</p>
<p>when we can automate a lot of labor,</p>
<p>where we can in fact,</p>
<p>the programming for your robot in your part,</p>
<p>neck of the woods and your part of the Amazon</p>
<p>to build something sustainable for you</p>
<p>and your tribe to deliver the right medicines,</p>
<p>to take care of the kids,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just software, that&rsquo;s just code</p>
<p>that could be totally open sourced, right?</p>
<p>So we can actually get to a mode</p>
<p>where all of this additional generative things</p>
<p>that humans are doing,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to be wrapped up in a container</p>
<p>and then we charge for all the exponential dynamics</p>
<p>out of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Facebook did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what modern social media did, right?</p>
<p>Because the old internet was connecting people just fine.</p>
<p>So Facebook came along and said,</p>
<p>well, anyone can post a picture,</p>
<p>anyone can post some text</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna amplify the crap out of it to everyone else.</p>
<p>And it exploded this generative network</p>
<p>of human interaction.</p>
<p>And then I said, how do I make money off that?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna be a gatekeeper</p>
<p>on everybody&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m gonna make money.</p>
<p>So how do we create more than one van?</p>
<p>How do we have millions of vans full of people</p>
<p>that create NumPy, SciPy, that create Python?</p>
<p>So the story of those people is often they have</p>
<p>some kind of job outside of this.</p>
<p>This is what they&rsquo;re doing for fun.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you need to have a job?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you have to be connected,</p>
<p>plugged in to the capitalist system?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this consumerism,</p>
<p>the engine that results in the individuals</p>
<p>that kind of take a break from it every once in a while</p>
<p>to create something magical?</p>
<p>Like at the edges is where the innovation happens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a surplus, right, this is the question.</p>
<p>Like if everyone were to go and run their own farm,</p>
<p>no one would have time to go and write NumPy, SciPy, right?</p>
<p>Maybe, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>when I say we&rsquo;re maybe at a post scarcity point</p>
<p>for a lot of people.</p>
<p>The question that we&rsquo;re never encouraged to ask</p>
<p>in a Super Bowl ad is how much do you need?</p>
<p>How much is enough?</p>
<p>Do you need to have a new car every two years, every five?</p>
<p>If you have a reliable car,</p>
<p>can you drive one for 10 years, is that all right?</p>
<p>I had a car for 10 years and it was fine.</p>
<p>Your iPhone, do you have to upgrade every two years?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s sort of, you&rsquo;re using the same apps</p>
<p>you did four years ago, right?</p>
<p>This should be a Super Bowl ad.</p>
<p>This should be a Super Bowl ad, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody. Do you really need a new iPhone?</p>
<p>Maybe one of our listeners will fund something like this</p>
<p>of like, no, but just actually bringing it back,</p>
<p>bringing it back to actually the question</p>
<p>of what do you need?</p>
<p>How do we create the infrastructure</p>
<p>for collectives of people to live on the basis</p>
<p>of providing what we need, meeting people&rsquo;s needs</p>
<p>with a little bit of access to handle emergencies,</p>
<p>things like that, pulling our resources together</p>
<p>to handle the really, really big emergencies,</p>
<p>somebody with a really rare form of cancer</p>
<p>or some massive fire sweeps through half the village</p>
<p>or whatever, but can we actually unscale things</p>
<p>and solve for people&rsquo;s needs</p>
<p>and then give them the capacity to explore</p>
<p>how to be the best version of themselves?</p>
<p>And for Travis, that was throwing away his shot of tenure</p>
<p>in order to write NumPy.</p>
<p>For others, there is a saying in the SciFi community</p>
<p>that SciFi advances one failed postdoc at a time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, we can do these things.</p>
<p>We can actually do this kind of collaboration</p>
<p>because code, software, information, organization,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cheap.</p>
<p>Those bits are very cheap to fling across the oceans.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Travis.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking and we&rsquo;ll continue to talk</p>
<p>about open source.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment.</p>
<p>How did you meet Travis?</p>
<p>Who is Travis Aliphant?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your relationship been like through the years?</p>
<p>Where did you work together?</p>
<p>How did you meet?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the present and the future look like?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the first time I met Travis</p>
<p>was at a SciFi conference in Pasadena.</p>
<p>Do you remember the year?</p>
<p>2005.</p>
<p>I was working at, again, at nthought,</p>
<p>working on scientific computing consulting.</p>
<p>And a couple of years later,</p>
<p>he joined us at nthought, I think 2007.</p>
<p>And he came in as the president.</p>
<p>One of the founders of nthought was the CEO, Eric Jones.</p>
<p>And we were all very excited that Travis was joining us</p>
<p>and that was great fun.</p>
<p>And so I worked with Travis</p>
<p>on a number of consulting projects</p>
<p>and we worked on some open source stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just a really, it was a good time there.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>It was primarily Python related?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it was all Python, NumPy, SciFi consulting</p>
<p>kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Towards the end of that time,</p>
<p>we started getting called into more and more finance shops.</p>
<p>They were adopting Python pretty heavily.</p>
<p>I did some work on like a high frequency trading shop,</p>
<p>working on some stuff.</p>
<p>And then we worked together on some,</p>
<p>at a couple of investment banks in Manhattan.</p>
<p>And so we started seeing that there was a potential</p>
<p>to take Python in the direction of business computing,</p>
<p>more than just being this niche like MATLAB replacement</p>
<p>for big vector computing.</p>
<p>What we were seeing was, oh yeah,</p>
<p>you could actually use Python as a Swiss army knife</p>
<p>to do a lot of shadow data transformation kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when we realized the potential is much greater.</p>
<p>And so we started Anaconda,</p>
<p>I mean, it was called Continuum Analytics at the time,</p>
<p>but we started in January of 2012</p>
<p>with a vision of shoring up the parts of Python</p>
<p>that needed to get expanded to handle data at scale,</p>
<p>to do web visualization, application development, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that was that, yeah.</p>
<p>So he was CEO and I was president for the first five years.</p>
<p>And then we raised some money and then the board,</p>
<p>it was sort of put in a new CEO.</p>
<p>They hired a kind of professional CEO.</p>
<p>And then Travis, you laugh at that.</p>
<p>I took over the CTO role.</p>
<p>Travis then left after a year to do his own thing,</p>
<p>to do Quonsight, which was more oriented</p>
<p>around some of the bootstrap years that we did at Continuum</p>
<p>where it was open source and consulting.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t sort of like gung ho product development.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t focused on,</p>
<p>we accidentally stumbled</p>
<p>into the package management problem at Anaconda,</p>
<p>but we had a lot of other visions of other technology</p>
<p>that we built in the open source.</p>
<p>And Travis was really trying to push,</p>
<p>again, the frontiers of numerical computing,</p>
<p>vector computing,</p>
<p>handling things like auto differentiation and stuff</p>
<p>intrinsically in the open ecosystem.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s kind of the direction</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s working on in some of his work.</p>
<p>We remain great friends and colleagues and collaborators,</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s no longer day to day working at Anaconda,</p>
<p>but he gives me a lot of feedback</p>
<p>about this and that and the other.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a big lesson you&rsquo;ve learned from Travis</p>
<p>about life or about programming or about leadership?</p>
<p>Wow, there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Travis is a really, really good guy.</p>
<p>He really, his heart is really in it.</p>
<p>He cares a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten that sense having to interact with him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Such a good human being.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really good dude.</p>
<p>And he and I, it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>We come from very different backgrounds.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re quite different as people,</p>
<p>but I think we can like not talk for a long time</p>
<p>and then be on a conversation</p>
<p>and be eye to eye on like 90% of things.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s someone who I believe</p>
<p>no matter how much fog settles in over the ocean,</p>
<p>his ship, my ship are pointed</p>
<p>sort of in the same direction of the same star.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to phrase it.</p>
<p>No matter how much fog there is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re pointed at the same star.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I hope he feels the same way.</p>
<p>I mean, I hope he knows that over the years now.</p>
<p>We both care a lot about the community.</p>
<p>For someone who cares so deeply,</p>
<p>I would say this about Travis that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>For someone who cares so deeply about the nerd details</p>
<p>of like type system design and vector computing</p>
<p>and efficiency of expressing this and that and the other,</p>
<p>memory layouts and all that stuff,</p>
<p>he cares even more about the people</p>
<p>in the ecosystem, the community.</p>
<p>And I have a similar kind of alignment.</p>
<p>I care a lot about the tech, I really do.</p>
<p>But for me, the beauty of what this human ecology</p>
<p>has produced is I think a touchstone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an early version, we can look at it and say,</p>
<p>how do we replicate this for humanity at scale?</p>
<p>What this open source collaboration was able to produce?</p>
<p>How can we be generative in human collaboration</p>
<p>moving forward and create that</p>
<p>as a civilizational kind of dynamic?</p>
<p>Like, can we seize this moment to do that?</p>
<p>Because like a lot of the other open source movements,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all nerds nerding out on code for nerds.</p>
<p>And this because it&rsquo;s scientists,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s people working on data,</p>
<p>that all of it faces real human problems.</p>
<p>I think we have an opportunity</p>
<p>to actually make a bigger impact.</p>
<p>Is there a way for this kind of open source vision</p>
<p>to make money?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>To fund the people involved?</p>
<p>Is that an essential part of it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we&rsquo;re trying to do that</p>
<p>in our own way at Anaconda,</p>
<p>because we know that business users,</p>
<p>as they use more of the stuff, they have needs,</p>
<p>like business specific needs around security, provenance.</p>
<p>They really can&rsquo;t tell their VPs and their investors,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re having, our data scientists</p>
<p>are installing random packages from who knows where</p>
<p>and running on customer data.</p>
<p>So they have to have someone to talk to you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Anaconda does.</p>
<p>So we are a governed source of packages for them,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s great, that makes some money.</p>
<p>We take some of that and we just take that as a dividend.</p>
<p>We take a percentage of our revenues</p>
<p>and write that as a dividend for the open source community.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I really see the development</p>
<p>of a marketplace for people to create notebooks,</p>
<p>models, data sets, curation of these different kinds</p>
<p>of things, and to really have</p>
<p>a long tail marketplace dynamic with that.</p>
<p>Can you speak about this problem</p>
<p>that you stumbled into of package management,</p>
<p>Python package management?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>A lot of people speak very highly of Conda,</p>
<p>which is part of Anaconda, which is a package manager.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of packages.</p>
<p>So first, what are package managers?</p>
<p>And second, what was there before?</p>
<p>What is pip?</p>
<p>And why is Conda more awesome?</p>
<p>The package problem is this, which is that</p>
<p>in order to do numerical computing efficiently with Python,</p>
<p>there are a lot of low level libraries</p>
<p>that need to be compiled, compiled with a C compiler</p>
<p>or C++ compiler or Fortran compiler.</p>
<p>They need to not just be compiled,</p>
<p>but they need to be compiled with all of the right settings.</p>
<p>And oftentimes those settings are tuned</p>
<p>for specific chip architectures.</p>
<p>And when you add GPUs to the mix,</p>
<p>when you look at different operating systems,</p>
<p>you may be on the same chip,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re running Mac versus Linux versus Windows</p>
<p>on the same x86 chip, you compile and link differently.</p>
<p>All of this complexity is beyond the capability</p>
<p>of most data scientists to reason about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also beyond what most of the package developers</p>
<p>want to deal with too.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re a package developer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, I code on Linux.</p>
<p>This works for me, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>It is not my problem to figure out how to build this</p>
<p>on an ancient version of Windows, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just simply not my problem.</p>
<p>So what we end up with is we have a creator economy</p>
<p>or create a very creative crowdsourced environment</p>
<p>where people want to use this stuff, but they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so we ended up creating a new set of technologies</p>
<p>like a build recipe system, a build system</p>
<p>and an installer system that is able to,</p>
<p>well, to put it simply,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to build these packages correctly</p>
<p>on each of these different kinds of platforms</p>
<p>and operating systems,</p>
<p>and make it so when people want to install something,</p>
<p>they can, it&rsquo;s just one command.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to set up a big compiler system</p>
<p>and do all these things.</p>
<p>So when it works well, it works great.</p>
<p>Now, the difficulty is we have literally thousands</p>
<p>of people writing code in the ecosystem,</p>
<p>building all sorts of stuff and each person writing code,</p>
<p>they may take a dependence on something else.</p>
<p>And so you have all this web,</p>
<p>incredibly complex web of dependencies.</p>
<p>So installing the correct package</p>
<p>for any given set of packages you want,</p>
<p>getting that right subgraph is an incredibly hard problem.</p>
<p>And again, most data scientists</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to think about this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, I want to install NumPy and pandas.</p>
<p>I want this version of some like geospatial library.</p>
<p>I want this other thing.</p>
<p>Like, why is this hard?</p>
<p>These exist, right?</p>
<p>And it is hard because it&rsquo;s, well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re installing this on a version of Windows, right?</p>
<p>And half of these libraries are not built for Windows</p>
<p>or the latest version isn&rsquo;t available,</p>
<p>but the old version was.</p>
<p>And if you go to the old version of this library,</p>
<p>that means you need to go to a different version</p>
<p>of that library.</p>
<p>And so the Python ecosystem,</p>
<p>by virtue of being crowdsourced,</p>
<p>we were able to fill a hundred thousand different niches.</p>
<p>But then we also suffer this problem</p>
<p>that because it&rsquo;s crowdsourced and no one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a tragedy of the commons, right?</p>
<p>No one really needs, wants to support</p>
<p>their thousands of other dependencies.</p>
<p>So we end up sort of having to do a lot of this.</p>
<p>And of course the conda forge community</p>
<p>also steps up as an open source community that,</p>
<p>you know, maintain some of these recipes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what conda does.</p>
<p>Now, pip is a tool that came along after conda,</p>
<p>to some extent, it came along as an easier way</p>
<p>for the Python developers writing Python code</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have as much compiled, you know, stuff.</p>
<p>They could then install different packages.</p>
<p>And what ended up happening in the Python ecosystem</p>
<p>was that a lot of the core Python and web Python developers,</p>
<p>they never ran into any of this compilation stuff at all.</p>
<p>So even we have, you know, on video,</p>
<p>we have Guido van Rossum saying,</p>
<p>you know what, the scientific community&rsquo;s packaging problems</p>
<p>are just too exotic and different.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about Fortran compilers, right?</p>
<p>Like you guys just need to build your own solution</p>
<p>perhaps, right?</p>
<p>So the Python core Python community went</p>
<p>and built its own sort of packaging technologies,</p>
<p>not really contemplating the complexity</p>
<p>of this stuff over here.</p>
<p>And so now we have the challenge where</p>
<p>you can pip install some things, some libraries,</p>
<p>if you just want to get started with them,</p>
<p>you can pip install TensorFlow and that works great.</p>
<p>The instant you want to also install some other packages</p>
<p>that use different versions of NumPy</p>
<p>or some like graphics library or some OpenCV thing</p>
<p>or some other thing, you now run into dependency hell</p>
<p>because you cannot, you know,</p>
<p>OpenCV can have a different version of libjpeg over here</p>
<p>than PyTorch over here.</p>
<p>Like they actually, they all have to use the,</p>
<p>if you want to use GPU acceleration,</p>
<p>they have to all use the same underlying drivers</p>
<p>and same GPU CUDA things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it gets to be very gnarly</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a level of technology</p>
<p>that both the makers and the users</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really want to think too much about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you step in and try to solve this.</p>
<p>We try to solve it.</p>
<p>Subgraph problems.</p>
<p>How much is that?</p>
<p>I mean, you said that you don&rsquo;t want to think,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to think about it,</p>
<p>but how much is it a little bit on the developer</p>
<p>and providing them tools to be a little bit more clear</p>
<p>of that subgraph of dependency that&rsquo;s necessary?</p>
<p>It is getting to a point where we do have to think about,</p>
<p>look, can we pull some of the most popular packages together</p>
<p>and get them to work on a coordinated release timeline,</p>
<p>get them to build against the same test matrix,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, right?</p>
<p>And there is a little bit of dynamic around this,</p>
<p>but again, it is a volunteer community.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, people working on these different projects</p>
<p>have their own timelines</p>
<p>and their own things they&rsquo;re trying to meet.</p>
<p>So we end up trying to pull these things together.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s this incredibly,</p>
<p>and I would recommend just as a business tip,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever go into business</p>
<p>where when your hard work works, you&rsquo;re invisible.</p>
<p>And when it breaks because of someone else&rsquo;s problem,</p>
<p>you get flagged for it.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s in our situation, right?</p>
<p>When something doesn&rsquo;t condensate all properly,</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s some upstream issue,</p>
<p>but it looks like condensate is broken.</p>
<p>It looks like, you know, Anaconda screwed something up.</p>
<p>When things do work though, it&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worked.</p>
<p>Assuming naturally, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to make that work, right?</p>
<p>So we end up in this kind of problematic scenario,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s okay because I think we&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>you know, our heart&rsquo;s in the right place.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to move this forward</p>
<p>as a community sort of affair.</p>
<p>I think most of the people in the community</p>
<p>also appreciate the work we&rsquo;ve done over the years</p>
<p>to try to move these things forward</p>
<p>in a collaborative fashion, so.</p>
<p>One of the subgraphs of dependencies</p>
<p>that became super complicated</p>
<p>is the move from Python 2 to Python 3.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all these ways to mess</p>
<p>with these kinds of ecosystems of packages and so on.</p>
<p>So I just want to ask you about that particular one.</p>
<p>What do you think about the move from Python 2 to 3?</p>
<p>Why did it take so long?</p>
<p>What were, from your perspective,</p>
<p>just seeing the packages all struggle</p>
<p>and the community all struggle through this process,</p>
<p>what lessons do you take away from it?</p>
<p>Why did it take so long?</p>
<p>Looking back, some people perhaps underestimated</p>
<p>how much adoption Python 2 had.</p>
<p>I think some people also underestimated how much,</p>
<p>or they overestimated how much value</p>
<p>some of the new features in Python 3 really provided.</p>
<p>Like the things they really loved about Python 3</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t matter to some of these people in Python 2.</p>
<p>Because this change was happening as Python, SciPy,</p>
<p>was starting to take off really like past,</p>
<p>like a hockey stick of adoption</p>
<p>in the early data science era, in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>A lot of people were learning and onboarding</p>
<p>in whatever just worked.</p>
<p>And the teachers were like,</p>
<p>well, yeah, these libraries I need</p>
<p>are not supported in Python 3 yet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to teach you Python 2.</p>
<p>Took a lot of advocacy to get people</p>
<p>to move over to Python 3.</p>
<p>So I think it wasn&rsquo;t any particular single thing,</p>
<p>but it was one of those death by a dozen cuts,</p>
<p>which just really made it hard to move off of Python 2.</p>
<p>And also Python 3 itself,</p>
<p>as they were kind of breaking things</p>
<p>and changing things around</p>
<p>and reorganizing the standard library,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that was happening there</p>
<p>that kept giving people an excuse to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put off till the next version.</p>
<p>2 is working fine enough for me right now.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s essentially what happened there.</p>
<p>And I will say this though,</p>
<p>the strength of the Python data science movement,</p>
<p>I think is what kept Python alive in that transition.</p>
<p>Because a lot of languages have died</p>
<p>and left their user bases behind.</p>
<p>If there wasn&rsquo;t the use of Python for data,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good chunk of Python users</p>
<p>that during that transition,</p>
<p>would have just left for Go and Rust and stayed.</p>
<p>In fact, some people did.</p>
<p>They moved to Go and Rust and they just never looked back.</p>
<p>The fact that we were able to grow by millions of users,</p>
<p>the Python data community,</p>
<p>that is what kept the momentum for Python going.</p>
<p>And now the usage of Python for data is over 50%</p>
<p>of the overall Python user base.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m happy to debate that on stage somewhere,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they really wanna take issue</p>
<p>with that statement, but from where I sit,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The statement there, the idea is that the switch</p>
<p>from Python 2 to Python 3 would have probably</p>
<p>destroyed Python if it didn&rsquo;t also coincide with Python</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>just overtaking the data science community,</p>
<p>anything that processes data.</p>
<p>So like the timing was perfect that this maybe</p>
<p>imperfect decision was coupled with a great timing</p>
<p>on the value of data in our world.</p>
<p>I would say the troubled execution of a good decision.</p>
<p>It was a decision that was necessary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible if we had more resources,</p>
<p>we could have done in a way that was a little bit smoother,</p>
<p>but ultimately, the arguments for Python 3,</p>
<p>I bought them at the time and I buy them now, right?</p>
<p>Having great text handling is like a nonnegotiable</p>
<p>table stakes thing you need to have in a language.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great, but the execution,</p>
<p>Python is the, it&rsquo;s volunteer driven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like now the most popular language on the planet,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all literally volunteers.</p>
<p>So the lack of resources meant that they had to really,</p>
<p>they had to do things in a very hamstrung way.</p>
<p>And I think to carry the Python momentum in the language</p>
<p>through that time, the data movement</p>
<p>was a critical part of that.</p>
<p>So some of it is carrot and stick, I actually have to</p>
<p>shamefully admit that it took me a very long time</p>
<p>to switch from Python 2 and Python 3</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a machine learning person.</p>
<p>It was just for the longest time,</p>
<p>you could just do fine with Python 2.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I think the moment where I switched everybody</p>
<p>I worked with and switched myself for small projects</p>
<p>and big is when finally, when NumPy announced</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to end support like in 2020</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like when I realized, oh, this isn&rsquo;t going,</p>
<p>this is going to end.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the stick, that&rsquo;s not a carrot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, so for the longest time it was carrots.</p>
<p>It was like all of these packages were saying,</p>
<p>okay, we have Python 3 support now, come join us.</p>
<p>We have Python 2 and Python 3, but when NumPy,</p>
<p>one of the packages I sort of love and depend on</p>
<p>said like, nope, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I decided to switch.</p>
<p>I wonder if you think it was possible much earlier</p>
<p>for somebody like NumPy or some major package</p>
<p>to step into the cold and say like we&rsquo;re ending this.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a chicken and egg problem too, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to cut off a lot of users</p>
<p>unless you see the user momentum going too.</p>
<p>So the decisions for the scientific community</p>
<p>for each of the different projects,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s not a monolith.</p>
<p>Some projects are like, we&rsquo;ll only be releasing</p>
<p>new features on Python 3.</p>
<p>And that was more of a sticky carrot, right?</p>
<p>A firm carrot, if you will, a firm carrot.</p>
<p>A stick shaped carrot.</p>
<p>But then for others, yeah, NumPy in particular,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s at the base of the dependency stack</p>
<p>for so many things, that was the final stick.</p>
<p>That was a stick shaped stick.</p>
<p>People were saying, look, if I have to keep maintaining</p>
<p>my releases for Python 2, that&rsquo;s that much less energy</p>
<p>that I can put into making things better</p>
<p>for the Python 3 folks or in my new version,</p>
<p>which is of course going to be Python 3.</p>
<p>So people were also getting kind of pulled by this tension.</p>
<p>So the overall community sort of had a lot of input</p>
<p>into when the NumPy core folks decided</p>
<p>that they would end of life on Python 2.</p>
<p>So as these numbers are a little bit loose,</p>
<p>but there are about 10 million Python programmers</p>
<p>in the world, you could argue that number,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say 10 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually where I was looking,</p>
<p>said 27 million total programmers, developers in the world.</p>
<p>You mentioned in a talk that changes need to be made</p>
<p>for there to be 100 million Python programmers.</p>
<p>So first of all, do you see a future</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s 100 million Python programmers?</p>
<p>And second, what kind of changes need to be made?</p>
<p>So Anaconda and Miniconda get downloaded</p>
<p>about a million times a week.</p>
<p>So I think the idea that there&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>10 million Python programmers in the world</p>
<p>is a little bit undercounting.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who escape traditional counting</p>
<p>that are using Python and data in their jobs.</p>
<p>I do believe that the future world for it to,</p>
<p>well, the world I would like to see</p>
<p>is one where people are data literate.</p>
<p>So they are able to use tools</p>
<p>that let them express their questions and ideas fluidly.</p>
<p>And the data variety and data complexity will not go down.</p>
<p>It will only keep increasing.</p>
<p>So I think some level of code or code like things</p>
<p>will continue to be relevant.</p>
<p>And so my hope is that we can build systems</p>
<p>that allow people to more seamlessly integrate</p>
<p>Python kinds of expressivity with data systems</p>
<p>and operationalization methods that are much more seamless.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is, you know,</p>
<p>right now you can&rsquo;t punch Python code into an Excel cell.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some tools you can do to kind of do this.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t build a thing for doing this back in the day,</p>
<p>but I feel like the total addressable market</p>
<p>for Python users, if we do the things right,</p>
<p>is on the order of the Excel users,</p>
<p>which is, you know, a few hundred million.</p>
<p>So I think Python has to get better at being embedded,</p>
<p>you know, being a smaller thing that pulls in</p>
<p>just the right parts of the ecosystem</p>
<p>to run numerics and do data exploration,</p>
<p>meeting people where they&rsquo;re already at</p>
<p>with their data and their data tools.</p>
<p>And then I think also it has to be easier</p>
<p>to take some of those things they&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>and flow those back into deployed systems</p>
<p>or little apps or visualizations.</p>
<p>I think if we don&rsquo;t do those things,</p>
<p>then we will always be kept in a silo</p>
<p>as sort of an expert user&rsquo;s tool</p>
<p>and not a tool for the masses.</p>
<p>You know, I work with a bunch of folks</p>
<p>in the Adobe Creative Suite,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m kind of forcing them or inspired them</p>
<p>to learn Python, to do a bunch of stuff that helps them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, because they probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t call themselves Python programmers,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all using Python.</p>
<p>I would love it if the tools like Photoshop and Premiere</p>
<p>and all those kinds of tools that are targeted</p>
<p>towards creative people, I guess that&rsquo;s where Excel,</p>
<p>Excel is targeted towards a certain kind of audience</p>
<p>that works with data, financial people,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, if there would be easy ways</p>
<p>to leverage to use Python for quick scripting tasks.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s an exciting application</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence in this space</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m hopeful about, looking at open AI codecs</p>
<p>with generating programs.</p>
<p>So almost helping people bridge the gap</p>
<p>from kind of visual interface to generating programs,</p>
<p>to something formal, and then they can modify it and so on,</p>
<p>but kind of without having to read the manual,</p>
<p>without having to do a Google search and stack overflow,</p>
<p>which is essentially what a neural network does</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s doing code generation,</p>
<p>is actually generating code and allowing a human</p>
<p>to communicate with multiple programs,</p>
<p>and then maybe even programs to communicate</p>
<p>with each other via Python.</p>
<p>So that to me is a really exciting possibility,</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a friction to kind of,</p>
<p>like how do I learn how to use Python in my life?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s oftentimes you kind of start a class,</p>
<p>you start learning about types, I don&rsquo;t know, functions.</p>
<p>Like this is, you know, Python is the first language</p>
<p>with which you start to learn to program.</p>
<p>But I feel like that&rsquo;s going to take a long time</p>
<p>for you to understand why it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>You almost want to start with a script.</p>
<p>Well, you do, in fact.</p>
<p>I think starting with the theory behind programming languages</p>
<p>and types and all that, I mean,</p>
<p>types are there to make the compiler writer&rsquo;s jobs easier.</p>
<p>Types are not, I mean, heck, do you have an ontology</p>
<p>of types or just the objects on this table?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So types are there because compiler writers are human</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re limited in what they can do.</p>
<p>But I think that the beauty of scripting,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a Python book that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Automate the Boring Stuff,&rsquo;</p>
<p>which is exactly the right mentality.</p>
<p>I grew up with computers in a time when I could,</p>
<p>when Steve Jobs was still pitching these things</p>
<p>as bicycles for the mind.</p>
<p>They were supposed to not be just media consumption devices,</p>
<p>but they were actually, you could write some code.</p>
<p>You could write basic, you could write some stuff</p>
<p>to do some things.</p>
<p>And that feeling of a computer as a thing</p>
<p>that we can use to extend ourselves</p>
<p>has all but evaporated for a lot of people.</p>
<p>So you see a little bit in parts</p>
<p>in the current, the generation of youth</p>
<p>around Minecraft or Roblox, right?</p>
<p>And I think Python, circuit Python,</p>
<p>these things could be a renaissance of that,</p>
<p>of people actually shaping and using their computers</p>
<p>as computers, as an extension of their minds</p>
<p>and their curiosity, their creativity.</p>
<p>So you talk about scripting the Adobe Suite with Python</p>
<p>in the 3D graphics world.</p>
<p>Python is a scripting language</p>
<p>that some of these 3D graphics suites use.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>We should better support those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But ultimately the idea that I should be able</p>
<p>to have power over my computing environment.</p>
<p>If I want these things to happen repeatedly all the time,</p>
<p>I should be able to say that somehow to the computer, right?</p>
<p>Now, whether the operating systems get there faster</p>
<p>by having some Siri backed with open AI with whatever.</p>
<p>So you can just say, Siri, make this do this</p>
<p>and this and every other Friday, right?</p>
<p>We probably will get there somewhere.</p>
<p>And Apple&rsquo;s always had these ideas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Apple script in the menu that no one ever uses,</p>
<p>but you can do these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But when you start doing that kind of scripting,</p>
<p>the challenge isn&rsquo;t learning the type system</p>
<p>or even the syntax of the language.</p>
<p>The challenge is all of the dictionaries</p>
<p>and all the objects of all their properties</p>
<p>and attributes and parameters.</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s got time to learn all that stuff, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when then programming by prototype</p>
<p>or by example becomes the right way</p>
<p>to get the user to express their desire.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of these different ways</p>
<p>that we can approach programming.</p>
<p>But I do think when, as you were talking</p>
<p>about the Adobe scripting thing,</p>
<p>I was thinking about, you know,</p>
<p>when we do use something like NumPy,</p>
<p>when we use things in the Python data</p>
<p>and scientific, let&rsquo;s say, expression system,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason we use that,</p>
<p>which is that it gives us mathematical precision.</p>
<p>It gives us actually quite a lot of precision</p>
<p>over precisely what we mean about this data set,</p>
<p>that data set, and it&rsquo;s the fact</p>
<p>that we can have that precision</p>
<p>that lets Python be powerful over as a duct tape for data.</p>
<p>You know, you give me a TSV or a CSV,</p>
<p>and if you give me some massively expensive vendor tool</p>
<p>for data transformation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m gonna be able to solve your problem.</p>
<p>But if you give me a Python prompt,</p>
<p>you can throw whatever data you want at me.</p>
<p>I will be able to mash it into shape.</p>
<p>So that ability to take it as sort of this like,</p>
<p>you know, machete out into the data jungle</p>
<p>is really powerful.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why at some level,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna get away from some of these expressions</p>
<p>and APIs and libraries in Python for data transformation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been at the center of the Python community</p>
<p>for many years.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the community</p>
<p>to help it grow, to help it improve,</p>
<p>to help it flourish and prosper, what would it be?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be one thing,</p>
<p>but what kind of comes to mind?</p>
<p>What are the challenges?</p>
<p>Humility is one of the values that we have</p>
<p>at Anaconda at the company,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also one of the values in the community.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s been breached a little bit in the last few years,</p>
<p>but in general, people are quite decent</p>
<p>and reasonable and nice.</p>
<p>And that humility prevents them from seeing</p>
<p>the greatness that they could have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many people in the core Python community</p>
<p>really understand that they stand perched at the edge</p>
<p>of an opportunity to transform how people use computers.</p>
<p>And actually, PyCon, I think it&rsquo;s the last physical PyCon</p>
<p>I went to, Russell Keith McGee gave a great keynote</p>
<p>about very much along the lines of the challenges I have,</p>
<p>which is Python, for a language that doesn&rsquo;t actually,</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t put an interface up,</p>
<p>put an interface up on the most popular computing devices,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done really well as a language, hasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t write a web front end with Python, really.</p>
<p>I mean, everyone uses JavaScript.</p>
<p>You certainly can&rsquo;t write native apps.</p>
<p>So for a language that you can&rsquo;t actually write apps</p>
<p>in any of those front end runtime environments,</p>
<p>Python&rsquo;s done exceedingly well.</p>
<p>And so that wasn&rsquo;t to pat ourselves on the back.</p>
<p>That was to challenge ourselves as a community to say,</p>
<p>we, through our current volunteer dynamic,</p>
<p>have gotten to this point.</p>
<p>What comes next and how do we seize,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve caught the tiger by the tail.</p>
<p>How do we make sure we keep up with it as it goes forward?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the questions I have</p>
<p>about sort of open source communities,</p>
<p>is at its best, there&rsquo;s a kind of humility.</p>
<p>Is that humility prevent you to have a vision</p>
<p>for creating something like very new and powerful?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve brought us back to consciousness again.</p>
<p>The collaboration is a swarm emergent dynamic.</p>
<p>Humility lets these people work together</p>
<p>without anyone trouncing anyone else.</p>
<p>How do they, you know, in consciousness,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the question of the binding problem.</p>
<p>How does a singular, our attention,</p>
<p>how does that emerge from billions of neurons?</p>
<p>So how can you have a swarm of people emerge a consensus</p>
<p>that has a singular vision to say, we will do this.</p>
<p>And most importantly, we&rsquo;re not gonna do these things.</p>
<p>Emerging a coherent, pointed, focused leadership dynamic</p>
<p>from a collaboration, being able to do that kind of,</p>
<p>and then dissolve it so people can still do</p>
<p>the swarm thing, that&rsquo;s a problem, that&rsquo;s a question.</p>
<p>So do you have to have a charismatic leader?</p>
<p>For some reason, Linus Torvald comes to mind,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s people who criticize.</p>
<p>He rules with an iron fist, man.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still charisma to it.</p>
<p>There is charisma, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a charisma to that iron fist.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, every leader&rsquo;s different, I would say,</p>
<p>in their success.</p>
<p>So he doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t even know if you can say</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have humility, there&rsquo;s such a meritocracy</p>
<p>of ideas that like, this is a good idea</p>
<p>and this is a bad idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a step function to it.</p>
<p>Once you clear a threshold, he&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p>Once you clear the bozo threshold,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s open to your ideas, I think, right?</p>
<p>But see, the interesting thing is obviously</p>
<p>that will not stand in an open source community</p>
<p>if that threshold that is defined</p>
<p>by that one particular person is not actually that good.</p>
<p>So you actually have to be really excellent at what you do.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s very good at what he does.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some aspect of leadership</p>
<p>where you can get thrown out, people can just leave.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works with open source, the fork.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you want to sometimes be a leader</p>
<p>like with a strong opinion, because people,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some kind of balance here</p>
<p>for this like hive mind to get like behind.</p>
<p>Leadership is a big topic.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not one of these guys</p>
<p>that went to MBA school and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be an entrepreneur and I&rsquo;m gonna be a leader.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna read all these Harvard Business Review</p>
<p>articles on leadership and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>Like I was a physicist turned into a software nerd</p>
<p>who then really like nerded out on Python.</p>
<p>And now I am entrepreneurial, right?</p>
<p>I saw a business opportunity around the use</p>
<p>of Python for data.</p>
<p>But for me, what has been interesting over this journey</p>
<p>with the last 10 years is how much I started really</p>
<p>enjoying the understanding, thinking deeper</p>
<p>about organizational dynamics and leadership.</p>
<p>And leadership does come down to a few core things.</p>
<p>Number one, a leader has to create belief</p>
<p>or at least has to dispel disbelief.</p>
<p>Leadership also, you have to have vision,</p>
<p>loyalty and experience.</p>
<p>So can you say belief in a singular vision?</p>
<p>Like what does belief mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, belief means a few things.</p>
<p>Belief means here&rsquo;s what we need to do</p>
<p>and this is a valid thing to do and we can do it.</p>
<p>That you have to be able to drive that belief.</p>
<p>And every step of leadership along the way</p>
<p>has to help you amplify that belief to more people.</p>
<p>I mean, I think at a fundamental level, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>You have to have a vision.</p>
<p>You have to be able to show people that,</p>
<p>or you have to convince people to believe in the vision</p>
<p>and to get behind you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the loyalty part comes in</p>
<p>and the experience part comes in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all different flavors of leadership.</p>
<p>So if we talk about Linus, we could talk about Elon Musk</p>
<p>and Steve Jobs, there&rsquo;s Sunder Prachai.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that kind of put themselves at the center</p>
<p>and are strongly opinionated.</p>
<p>And some people are more like consensus builders.</p>
<p>What works well for open source?</p>
<p>What works well in the space of programmers?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been a programmer, you&rsquo;ve led many programmers</p>
<p>that are now sort of at the center of this ecosystem.</p>
<p>What works well in the programming world would you say?</p>
<p>It really depends on the people.</p>
<p>What style of leadership is best?</p>
<p>And it depends on the programming community.</p>
<p>I think for the Python community,</p>
<p>servant leadership is one of the values.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the leader has to also be</p>
<p>the high priest of values, right?</p>
<p>So any collection of people has values of their living.</p>
<p>And if you want to maintain certain values</p>
<p>and those values help you as an organization</p>
<p>become more powerful,</p>
<p>then the leader has to live those values unequivocally</p>
<p>and has to hold the values.</p>
<p>So in our case, in this collaborative community</p>
<p>around Python, I think that the humility</p>
<p>is one of those values.</p>
<p>Servant leadership, you actually have to kind of do the stuff.</p>
<p>You have to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like the Python community really demands</p>
<p>that much from a vision standpoint.</p>
<p>And they should.</p>
<p>And I think they should.</p>
<p>This is the interesting thing is like so many people</p>
<p>use Python, from where comes the vision?</p>
<p>You know, like you have a Elon Musk type character</p>
<p>who makes bold statements about the vision</p>
<p>for particular companies he&rsquo;s involved with.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I think a lot of people that work</p>
<p>at those companies kind of can only last</p>
<p>if they believe that vision.</p>
<p>And some of it is super bold.</p>
<p>So my question is, and by the way,</p>
<p>those companies often use Python.</p>
<p>How do you establish a vision?</p>
<p>Like get to 100 million users, right?</p>
<p>Get to where, you know, the Python is at the center</p>
<p>of the machine learning and was it data science,</p>
<p>machine learning, deep learning,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence revolution, right?</p>
<p>Like in many ways, perhaps the Python community</p>
<p>is not thinking of it that way,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s leading the way on this.</p>
<p>Like the tooling is like essential.</p>
<p>Right, well, you know, for a while,</p>
<p>PyCon people in the scientific Python</p>
<p>and the PyData community, they would submit talks.</p>
<p>Those are early 2010s, mid 2010s.</p>
<p>They would submit talks for PyCon</p>
<p>and the talks would all be rejected</p>
<p>because there was the separate sort of PyData conferences.</p>
<p>And like, well, these probably belong more to PyData.</p>
<p>And instead there&rsquo;d be yet another talk about, you know,</p>
<p>threads and, you know, whatever, some web framework.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that was an interesting dynamic to see</p>
<p>that there was, I mean, at the time it was a little annoying</p>
<p>because we wanted to try to get more users</p>
<p>and get more people talking about these things.</p>
<p>And PyCon is a huge venue, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thousands of Python programmers.</p>
<p>But then also came to appreciate that, you know,</p>
<p>parallel, having an ecosystem that allows parallel</p>
<p>innovation is not bad, right?</p>
<p>There are people doing embedded Python stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people doing web programming,</p>
<p>people doing scripting, there&rsquo;s cyber uses of Python.</p>
<p>I think the, ultimately at some point,</p>
<p>if your slide mold covers so much stuff,</p>
<p>you have to respect that different things are growing</p>
<p>in different areas and different niches.</p>
<p>Now, at some point that has to come together</p>
<p>and the central body has to provide resources.</p>
<p>The principle here is subsidiarity.</p>
<p>Give resources to the various groups</p>
<p>to then allocate as they see fit in their niches.</p>
<p>That would be a really helpful dynamic.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s a volunteer community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they had that many resources to start with.</p>
<p>What was or is your favorite programming setup?</p>
<p>What operating system, what keyboard,</p>
<p>how many screens are you listening to?</p>
<p>What time of day are you drinking coffee, tea?</p>
<p>Tea, sometimes coffee, depending on how well I slept.</p>
<p>I used to have.</p>
<p>How much sleep do you get?</p>
<p>Are you a night owl?</p>
<p>I remember somebody asked you somewhere,</p>
<p>a question about work life balance.</p>
<p>Not just work life balance, but like a family,</p>
<p>you lead a company and your answer was basically like,</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t figured it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve gotten to a little bit better balance.</p>
<p>I have a really great leadership team now supporting me</p>
<p>and so that takes a lot of the day to day stuff</p>
<p>off my plate and my kids are getting a little older.</p>
<p>So that helps.</p>
<p>So, and of course I have a wonderful wife</p>
<p>who takes care of a lot of the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not able to take care of and she&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I try to get to sleep earlier now</p>
<p>because I have to get up every morning at six</p>
<p>to take my kid down to the bus stop.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a hard thing.</p>
<p>For a while I was doing polyphasic sleep,</p>
<p>which is really interesting.</p>
<p>Like I go to bed at nine, wake up at like 2 a.m.,</p>
<p>work till five, sleep three hours, wake up at eight.</p>
<p>Like that was actually, it was interesting.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p>
<p>How did it feel?</p>
<p>It was good.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t keep it up for years, but once I have travel,</p>
<p>then it just, everything goes out the window, right?</p>
<p>Because then you&rsquo;re like time zones and all these things.</p>
<p>Socially was it, except like were you able to live</p>
<p>outside of how you felt?</p>
<p>Were you able to live normal society?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, because like on the nights</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t out hanging out with people or whatever,</p>
<p>going to bed at nine, no one cares.</p>
<p>I wake up at two, I&rsquo;m still responding to their slacks,</p>
<p>emails, whatever, and you know, shitposting on Twitter</p>
<p>or whatever at two in the morning is great, right?</p>
<p>And then you go to bed for a few hours and you wake up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you had an extra day in the middle.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d read somewhere that humans naturally</p>
<p>have biphasic sleep or something, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I read basically everything somewhere.</p>
<p>So every option of everything.</p>
<p>Every option of everything.</p>
<p>I will say that that worked out for me for a while,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>In terms of programming setup,</p>
<p>I had a 27 inch high DPI setup that I really liked,</p>
<p>but then I moved to a curved monitor</p>
<p>just because when I moved to the new house,</p>
<p>I want to have a bit more screen for Zoom plus communications</p>
<p>plus various kinds of things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like one large monitor.</p>
<p>One large curved monitor.</p>
<p>What operating system?</p>
<p>Mac.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that what happens when you become important,</p>
<p>is you stop using Linux and Windows?</p>
<p>No, I actually have a Windows box as well</p>
<p>on the next table over, but I have three desks, right?</p>
<p>So the main one is the standing desk so that I can,</p>
<p>whatever, when I&rsquo;m like, I have a teleprompter set up</p>
<p>and everything else.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve got my iMac and then eGPU and then Windows PC.</p>
<p>The reason I moved to Mac was it&rsquo;s got a Linux prompt</p>
<p>or no, sorry, it&rsquo;s got a, it&rsquo;s got a Unix prompt</p>
<p>so I can do all my stuff, but then I don&rsquo;t have to worry.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;m presenting for clients</p>
<p>or investors or whatever, like it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to worry about any like ACPI related</p>
<p>fsic things in the middle of a presentation,</p>
<p>like none of that.</p>
<p>It just, it will always wake from sleep</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t kernel panic on me.</p>
<p>And this is not a dig against Linux,</p>
<p>except that I just, I feel really bad.</p>
<p>I feel like a traitor to my community saying this, right?</p>
<p>But in 2012, I was just like, okay, start my own company.</p>
<p>What do I get?</p>
<p>And Linux laptops were just not quite there.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve just stuck with Macs.</p>
<p>Can I just defend something that nobody respectable</p>
<p>seems to do, which is, so I do a boot on Linux windows,</p>
<p>but in windows, I have a windows subsystems</p>
<p>for Linux or whatever, WSL.</p>
<p>And I find myself being able to handle everything I need</p>
<p>and almost everything I need in Linux</p>
<p>for basic sort of tasks, scripting tasks within WSL</p>
<p>and it creates a really nice environment.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been, but like whenever I hang out with like,</p>
<p>especially important people,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re all on iPhone and a Mac</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, yeah, like what,</p>
<p>there is a messiness to windows and a messiness to Linux</p>
<p>that makes me feel like you&rsquo;re still in it.</p>
<p>Well, the Linux stuff, windows subsystem for Linux</p>
<p>is very tempting, but there&rsquo;s still the windows</p>
<p>on the outside where I don&rsquo;t know where,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been, okay, I&rsquo;ve used DOS since version 1.11</p>
<p>or 1.21 or something.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been a long time Microsoft user.</p>
<p>And I will say that like, it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>for me to know where anything is,</p>
<p>how to get to the details behind something</p>
<p>when something screws up as an invariably does</p>
<p>and just things like changing group permissions</p>
<p>on some shared folders and stuff,</p>
<p>just everything seems a little bit more awkward,</p>
<p>more clicks than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Not to say that there aren&rsquo;t weird things</p>
<p>like hidden attributes and all this other happy stuff</p>
<p>on Mac, but for the most part,</p>
<p>and well, actually, especially now</p>
<p>with the new hardware coming out on Mac,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be very interesting with the new M1.</p>
<p>There were some dark years in the last few years</p>
<p>when I was like, I think maybe I have to move off of Mac</p>
<p>as a platform, but this, I mean,</p>
<p>like my keyboard was just not working.</p>
<p>Like literally my keyboard just wasn&rsquo;t working, right?</p>
<p>I had this touch bar, didn&rsquo;t have a physical escape button</p>
<p>like I needed to because I used Vim,</p>
<p>and now I think we&rsquo;re back, so.</p>
<p>So you use Vim and you have a, what kind of keyboard?</p>
<p>So I use a RealForce 87U, it&rsquo;s a mechanical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a Topre keyswitch.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a weird shape, there&rsquo;s a normal shape, okay.</p>
<p>Well, no, because I say that because I use a Kinesis,</p>
<p>and you said some dark, you said you had dark moments.</p>
<p>I recently had a dark moment,</p>
<p>I was like, what am I doing with my life?</p>
<p>So I remember sort of flying in a very kind of tight space,</p>
<p>and as I&rsquo;m working, this is what I do on an airplane.</p>
<p>I pull out a laptop, and on top of the laptop,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a Kinesis keyboard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hardcore, man.</p>
<p>I was thinking, is this who I am?</p>
<p>Is this what I&rsquo;m becoming?</p>
<p>Will I be this person?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m on Emacs with this Kinesis keyboard,</p>
<p>sitting like with everybody around.</p>
<p>Emacs on Windows.</p>
<p>On WSL, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, Emacs on Linux on Windows.</p>
<p>Yeah, on Windows.</p>
<p>And like everybody around me is using their iPhone</p>
<p>to look at TikTok.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like in this land, and I thought, you know what?</p>
<p>Maybe I need to become an adult and put the 90s behind me,</p>
<p>and use like a normal keyboard.</p>
<p>And then I did some soul searching,</p>
<p>and I decided like this is who I am.</p>
<p>This is me like coming out of the closet</p>
<p>to saying I&rsquo;m Kinesis keyboard all the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use Emacs.</p>
<p>You know who else is a Kinesis fan?</p>
<p>Wes McKinney, the creator of Pandas.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>He banged out Pandas on a Kinesis keyboard, I believe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s still using one, maybe,</p>
<p>but certainly 10 years ago, like he was.</p>
<p>If anyone&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>maybe we need to have a Kinesis support group.</p>
<p>Please reach out.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there already one?</p>
<p>Is there one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be an RSC channel, man.</p>
<p>Oh no, and you access it through Emacs.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you still program these days?</p>
<p>I do a little bit.</p>
<p>Honestly, the last thing I did was I had written,</p>
<p>I was working with my son to script some Minecraft stuff.</p>
<p>So I was doing a little bit of that.</p>
<p>That was the last, literally the last code I wrote.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what?</p>
<p>Also, I wrote some code to do some cap table evaluation,</p>
<p>waterfall modeling kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person,</p>
<p>you said your son, today, in high school,</p>
<p>maybe even college, about career, about life?</p>
<p>This may be where I get into trouble a little bit.</p>
<p>We are coming to the end.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rapidly entering a time between worlds.</p>
<p>So we have a world now that&rsquo;s starting to really crumble</p>
<p>under the weight of aging institutions</p>
<p>that no longer even pretend to serve the purposes</p>
<p>they were created for.</p>
<p>We are creating technologies that are hurtling billions</p>
<p>of people headlong into philosophical crises</p>
<p>who they don&rsquo;t even know the philosophical operating systems</p>
<p>in their firmware.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re heading into a time when that gets vaporized.</p>
<p>So for people in high school,</p>
<p>and certainly I tell my son this as well,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in middle school, people in college,</p>
<p>you are going to have to find your own way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to have a pioneer spirit,</p>
<p>even if you live in the middle</p>
<p>of the most dense urban environment.</p>
<p>All of human reality around you</p>
<p>is the result of the last few generations of humans</p>
<p>agreeing to play certain kinds of games.</p>
<p>A lot of those games no longer operate</p>
<p>according to the rules they used to.</p>
<p>Collapse is nonlinear, but it will be managed.</p>
<p>And so if you are in a particular social caste</p>
<p>or economic caste,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s not kosher to say that about America,</p>
<p>but America is a very stratified and classist society.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some mobility, but it&rsquo;s really quite classist.</p>
<p>And in America, unless you&rsquo;re in the upper middle class,</p>
<p>you are headed into very choppy waters.</p>
<p>So it is really, really good to think</p>
<p>and understand the fundamentals of what you need</p>
<p>to build a meaningful life for you, your loved ones,</p>
<p>with your family.</p>
<p>And almost all of the technology being created</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s consumer facing is designed to own people,</p>
<p>to take the four stack of people, to delaminate them,</p>
<p>and to own certain portions of that stack.</p>
<p>And so if you want to be an integral human being,</p>
<p>if you want to have your agency</p>
<p>and you want to find your own way in the world,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young would be a great time to spend time</p>
<p>looking at some of the classics</p>
<p>around what it means to live a good life,</p>
<p>what it means to build connection with people.</p>
<p>And so much of the status game, so much of the stuff,</p>
<p>one of the things that I sort of talk about</p>
<p>as we create more and more technology,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a gradient of technology,</p>
<p>and a gradient of technology</p>
<p>always leads to a gradient of power.</p>
<p>And this is Jacques Leleu&rsquo;s point to some extent as well.</p>
<p>That gradient of power is not going to go away.</p>
<p>The technologies are going so fast</p>
<p>that even people like me who helped create</p>
<p>some of the stuff, I&rsquo;m being left behind.</p>
<p>Some of the cutting edge research,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on against today.</p>
<p>You know, I go read some proceedings.</p>
<p>So as the world gets more and more technological,</p>
<p>it will create more and more gradients</p>
<p>where people will seize power, economic fortunes.</p>
<p>And the way they make the people who are left behind</p>
<p>okay with their lot in life is they create lottery systems.</p>
<p>They make you take part in the narrative</p>
<p>of your own being trapped in your own economic sort of zone.</p>
<p>So avoiding those kinds of things is really important.</p>
<p>Knowing when someone is running game on you basically.</p>
<p>So these are the things I would tell young people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dark message, but it&rsquo;s realism.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I see.</p>
<p>So after you gave some realism, you sit back.</p>
<p>You sit back with your son.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking out at the sunset.</p>
<p>What to him can you give as words of hope and to you</p>
<p>from where do you derive hope for the future of our world?</p>
<p>So you said at the individual level,</p>
<p>you have to have a pioneer mindset</p>
<p>to go back to the classics,</p>
<p>to understand what is in human nature you can find meaning.</p>
<p>But at the societal level, what trajectory,</p>
<p>when you look up possible trajectories, what gives you hope?</p>
<p>What gives me hope is that we have little tremors now</p>
<p>shaking people out of the reverie</p>
<p>of the fiction of modernity that they&rsquo;ve been living in,</p>
<p>kind of a late 20th century style modernity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good, I think.</p>
<p>Because, and also to your point earlier,</p>
<p>people are burning out on some of the social media stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of seeing the ugly side,</p>
<p>especially the latest news with Facebook</p>
<p>and the whistleblower, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite clear these things are not</p>
<p>all they&rsquo;re cracked up to be.</p>
<p>Do you believe, I believe better social media can be built</p>
<p>because they are burning out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll incentivize other competitors to be built.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Well, the thing about it is that</p>
<p>when you have extractive return on returns</p>
<p>capital coming in and saying,</p>
<p>look, you own a network,</p>
<p>give me some exponential dynamics out of this network.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna just basically put a toll keeper</p>
<p>at every single node and every single graph edge,</p>
<p>every node, every vertex, every edge.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t have that need for it,</p>
<p>if no one&rsquo;s sitting there saying,</p>
<p>hey, Wikipedia, monetize every character,</p>
<p>every byte, every phrase,</p>
<p>then generative human dynamics will naturally sort of arise,</p>
<p>assuming we respect a few principles</p>
<p>around online communications.</p>
<p>So the greatest and biggest social network in the world</p>
<p>is still like email, SMS, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re fine there.</p>
<p>The issue with the social media, as we call it now,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re actually just new amplification systems, right?</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s benefited certain people like yourself</p>
<p>who have interesting content to be amplified.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s created a creator economy, and that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of great content out there.</p>
<p>But giving everyone a shot at the fame lottery,</p>
<p>saying, hey, you could also have your,</p>
<p>if you wiggle your butt the right way on TikTok,</p>
<p>you can have your 15 seconds of micro fame.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not healthy for society at large.</p>
<p>So I think if we can create tools that help people</p>
<p>be conscientious about their attention,</p>
<p>spend time looking at the past,</p>
<p>and really retrieving memory and calling,</p>
<p>not calling, but processing and thinking about that,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s certainly possible,</p>
<p>and hopefully that&rsquo;s what we get.</p>
<p>So the bigger question that you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>about what gives me hope</p>
<p>is that these early shocks of COVID lockdowns</p>
<p>and remote work and all these different kinds of things,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s getting people to a point</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re sort of no longer in the reverie.</p>
<p>As my friend Jim Rutt says,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more people with ears to hear now.</p>
<p>With the pandemic and education,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like, wait, wait,</p>
<p>what have you guys been doing with my kids?</p>
<p>How are you teaching them?</p>
<p>What is this crap you&rsquo;re giving them as homework?</p>
<p>So I think these are the kinds of things</p>
<p>that are getting, and the supply chain disruptions,</p>
<p>getting more people to think about,</p>
<p>how do we actually just make stuff?</p>
<p>This is all good, but the concern is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still gonna take a while for these things,</p>
<p>for people to learn how to be agentic again,</p>
<p>and to be in right relationship with each other</p>
<p>and with the world.</p>
<p>So the message of hope is still people are resilient,</p>
<p>and we are building some really amazing technology.</p>
<p>And I also, to me, I derive a lot of hope</p>
<p>from individuals in that van.</p>
<p>The power of a single individual to transform the world,</p>
<p>to do positive things for the world is quite incredible.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice to have as many of those individuals as possible,</p>
<p>but even the power of one, it&rsquo;s kind of magical.</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a mode now where we can do that.</p>
<p>I think also, part of what I try to do</p>
<p>is in coming to podcasts like yours,</p>
<p>and then spamming with all this philosophical stuff</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve got going on,</p>
<p>there are a lot of good people out there</p>
<p>trying to put words around the current technological,</p>
<p>social, economic crises that we&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>And in the space of a few short years,</p>
<p>I think there has been a lot of great content</p>
<p>produced around this stuff.</p>
<p>For people who wanna see, wanna find out more,</p>
<p>or think more about this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re popularizing certain kinds of philosophical ideas</p>
<p>that move people beyond just the,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re communist, oh, you&rsquo;re capitalist kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s sort of, we&rsquo;re way past that now.</p>
<p>So that also gives me hope,</p>
<p>that I feel like I myself am getting a handle</p>
<p>on how to think about these things.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like I can,</p>
<p>hopefully affect change for the better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been sneaking up on this question all over the place.</p>
<p>Let me ask the big, ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>The meaning of life.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never really understood that question.</p>
<p>When you say meaning crisis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that there is a search</p>
<p>for a kind of experience</p>
<p>that could be described as fulfillment,</p>
<p>as like the aha moment of just like joy,</p>
<p>and maybe when you see something beautiful,</p>
<p>or maybe you have created something beautiful,</p>
<p>that experience that you get,</p>
<p>it feels like it all makes sense.</p>
<p>So some of that is just chemicals coming together</p>
<p>in your mind and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But it seems like we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>a sophisticated collective intelligence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s providing meaning in all kinds of ways</p>
<p>to its members.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a theme to that meaning.</p>
<p>So for a lot of history,</p>
<p>I think faith played an important role.</p>
<p>Faith in God, sort of religion.</p>
<p>I think technology in the modern era</p>
<p>is kind of serving a little bit</p>
<p>of a source of meaning for people,</p>
<p>like innovation of different kinds.</p>
<p>I think the old school things of love</p>
<p>and the basics of just being good at stuff.</p>
<p>But you were a physicist,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a desire to say, okay, yeah,</p>
<p>but these seem to be like symptoms of something deeper.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like why?</p>
<p>A little meaning, what&rsquo;s capital M meaning?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s capital M meaning?</p>
<p>Why are we reaching for order</p>
<p>when there is excess of energy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can answer the why.</p>
<p>Any why that I come up with, I think, is gonna be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to think about that a little more,</p>
<p>maybe get back to you on that.</p>
<p>But I will say this.</p>
<p>We do look at the world through a traditional,</p>
<p>I think most people look at the world through</p>
<p>what I would say is a subject object</p>
<p>to kind of metaphysical lens,</p>
<p>that we have our own subjectivity,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s all of these object things that are not us.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m me, and these things are not me, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m interacting with them, I&rsquo;m doing things to them.</p>
<p>But a different view of the world</p>
<p>that looks at it as much more connected,</p>
<p>that realizes, oh, I&rsquo;m really quite embedded</p>
<p>in a soup of other things,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m simply almost like a standing wave pattern</p>
<p>of different things, right?</p>
<p>So when you look at the world</p>
<p>in that kind of connected sense,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently taken a shine</p>
<p>to this particular thought experiment,</p>
<p>which is what if it was the case</p>
<p>that everything that we touch with our hands,</p>
<p>that we pay attention to,</p>
<p>that we actually give intimacy to,</p>
<p>what if there&rsquo;s actually all the mumbo jumbo,</p>
<p>like people with the magnetic healing crystals</p>
<p>and all this other kind of stuff and quantum energy stuff,</p>
<p>what if that was a thing?</p>
<p>What if literally when your hand touches an object,</p>
<p>when you really look at something</p>
<p>and you concentrate and you focus on it</p>
<p>and you really give it attention,</p>
<p>you actually give it,</p>
<p>there is some physical residue of something,</p>
<p>a part of you, a bit of your life force that goes into it.</p>
<p>Okay, now this is of course completely mumbo jumbo stuff.</p>
<p>This is not like, I don&rsquo;t actually think this is real,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s do the thought experiment.</p>
<p>What if it was?</p>
<p>What if there actually was some quantum magnetic crystal</p>
<p>and energy field thing that just by touching this can,</p>
<p>this can has changed a little bit somehow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not much unless you put a lot into it</p>
<p>and you touch it all the time, like your phone, right?</p>
<p>These things gained, they gain meaning to you a little bit,</p>
<p>but what if there&rsquo;s something that,</p>
<p>technical objects, the phone is a technical object,</p>
<p>it does not really receive attention or intimacy</p>
<p>and then allow itself to be transformed by it.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s a piece of wood,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the handle of a knife that your mother used</p>
<p>for 20 years to make dinner for you, right?</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s a keyboard that you banged out,</p>
<p>your world transforming software library on?</p>
<p>These are technical objects</p>
<p>and these are physical objects,</p>
<p>but somehow there&rsquo;s something to them.</p>
<p>We feel an attraction to these objects</p>
<p>as if we have imbued them with life energy, right?</p>
<p>So if you walk that thought experiment through,</p>
<p>what happens when we touch another person,</p>
<p>when we hug them, when we hold them?</p>
<p>And the reason this ties into my answer for your question</p>
<p>is that if there is such a thing,</p>
<p>if there is such a thing,</p>
<p>if we were to hypothesize, you know,</p>
<p>hypothesize it&rsquo;s such a thing,</p>
<p>it could be that the purpose of our lives</p>
<p>is to imbue as many things with that love as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful answer</p>
<p>and a beautiful way to end it, Peter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Spanning so much in the space of engineering</p>
<p>and in the space of philosophy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud to be living in the same city as you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really grateful</p>
<p>that you would spend your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Peter Wang.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Peter Wang himself.</p>
<p>We tend to think of people</p>
<p>as either malicious or incompetent,</p>
<p>but in a world filled with corruptible</p>
<p>and unchecked institutions,</p>
<p>there exists a third thing, malicious incompetence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a social cancer</p>
<p>and it only appears once human organizations scale</p>
<p>beyond personal accountability.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
