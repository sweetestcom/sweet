    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today is an Ask Me Anything episode, or AMA.</p>
<p>This is part of our premium subscriber channel.</p>
<p>Our premium subscriber channel was started</p>
<p>in order to provide support</p>
<p>for this standard Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>which comes out every Monday</p>
<p>and is available at zero cost to everybody</p>
<p>on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>We also started the premium channel</p>
<p>as a way to generate support for exciting research</p>
<p>being done at Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>research on human beings</p>
<p>that leads to important discoveries</p>
<p>that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also pleased to inform you that for every dollar</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab premium channel generates</p>
<p>for research studies,</p>
<p>the TINY Foundation has agreed to match that amount,</p>
<p>so now we are able to double the total amount of funding</p>
<p>given to studies of mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and human performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to subscribe</p>
<p>to the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>It is $10 a month to subscribe,</p>
<p>or you can pay $100 all at once</p>
<p>to get an entire 12-month subscription for a year.</p>
<p>We also have a lifetime subscription model</p>
<p>that is a one-time payment,</p>
<p>and again, you can find that option</p>
<p>at hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>For those of you that are already subscribers</p>
<p>to the premium channel,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium</p>
<p>and download the premium subscription feed.</p>
<p>And for those of you</p>
<p>that are not Huberman Lab Podcast premium subscribers,</p>
<p>you can still hear the first 20 minutes of today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>and determine whether or not</p>
<p>becoming a premium subscriber is for you.</p>
<p>And now without further ado,</p>
<p>I will answer your questions,</p>
<p>and as always, I will strive to be as thorough as possible,</p>
<p>as clear as possible, and as concise as possible.</p>
<p>Our first question is about abstaining from thoughts,</p>
<p>and in answering this question,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to skirt right up against a topic</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve covered before on the podcast,</p>
<p>which is obsessive-compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>which is a very serious disorder.</p>
<p>I mean, it can have a range of severity,</p>
<p>but people with true OCD suffer a lot from obsessions,</p>
<p>these are intrusive thoughts, and compulsions,</p>
<p>which are the behaviors</p>
<p>typically associated with those thoughts.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>that we define OCD really clearly</p>
<p>so that we can make sure</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about intrusive thoughts</p>
<p>and the desire to abstain from thoughts versus OCD</p>
<p>and where there might be some overlap there.</p>
<p>The functional definition of OCD</p>
<p>that really pertains to the disorder,</p>
<p>obsessive-compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>OCD, as opposed to, you know, we call people neurotic,</p>
<p>or we say, you have OCD,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m so OCD about this, or OCD about that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s become kind of a common use of the acronym OCD.</p>
<p>But true OCD is a situation</p>
<p>in which the engaging in a particular compulsive behavior</p>
<p>does not serve to reduce the intensity</p>
<p>or the frequency of the obsessions.</p>
<p>In fact, it makes it worse, okay?</p>
<p>So the typical thing that we hear these days is,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re so OCD, or he&rsquo;s so OCD, or she&rsquo;s so OCD,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m so OCD.</p>
<p>Now, if someone is OCD in that sense, okay,</p>
<p>so not the clinical disorder,</p>
<p>but OCD in the sense that, you know, they&rsquo;re really clean,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really fastidious, they need everything perfect.</p>
<p>However, that person can achieve some level of calm</p>
<p>and comfort that&rsquo;s fairly long lasting</p>
<p>if everything&rsquo;s clean and perfect.</p>
<p>Well, then that&rsquo;s not obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>This is really important to understand</p>
<p>as we venture into answering the question</p>
<p>about intrusive thoughts</p>
<p>and the desire to abstain from certain thoughts.</p>
<p>A person with true OCD will keep cleaning and cleaning,</p>
<p>or washing their hands,</p>
<p>or arranging things at perfect right angles,</p>
<p>but the more they do it, the more their anxiety goes up.</p>
<p>A person who has more typical,</p>
<p>gosh, we don&rsquo;t really even have a language</p>
<p>for this nowadays, unfortunately,</p>
<p>but the sort of person that&rsquo;s extremely particular,</p>
<p>they need things a certain way,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very driven to resolve things and do things</p>
<p>to make sure that things are done in a certain way</p>
<p>or handled in a certain way.</p>
<p>Well, if that person can experience relief</p>
<p>from engaging in, let&rsquo;s say, exercise or from cleaning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, you&rsquo;re so OCD about exercise.</p>
<p>Well, but if exercising for an hour</p>
<p>or even two hours in the morning</p>
<p>makes somebody really calm the rest of the day</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t need to exercise,</p>
<p>well, then they&rsquo;re not necessarily true OCD.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily have a disorder related to exercise.</p>
<p>However, if they&rsquo;re exercising for two hours in the morning</p>
<p>and then they find they can&rsquo;t concentrate on other things</p>
<p>and their desire to exercise just increases and increases</p>
<p>and becomes intrusive for them,</p>
<p>disrupting their quality of life throughout the day,</p>
<p>well, then that&rsquo;s falling under the umbrella</p>
<p>of what we would call a true disorder.</p>
<p>Okay, so we want to highlight that</p>
<p>because the question is about</p>
<p>a desire to abstain from thoughts.</p>
<p>And the question is,</p>
<p>in your discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>and I should just mention Dr. Anna Lembke</p>
<p>is the director of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic</p>
<p>at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the author of this incredible book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dopamine Nation,&rsquo; that I think everybody should read.</p>
<p>I do believe everyone should read that book.</p>
<p>So important for the addict and non-addict alike</p>
<p>because it deals with basically</p>
<p>the state of our life nowadays.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living in this dopamine rich world</p>
<p>where we can quickly become dopamine depleted,</p>
<p>which is terrible, leads to depression,</p>
<p>in addition to things like addiction in some folks, et cetera.</p>
<p>Anna was a guest on the podcast.</p>
<p>You can find her episode at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Just put Anna.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s the only guest we&rsquo;ve had thus far</p>
<p>whose name is Anna.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll just pop up there.</p>
<p>The entire website is searchable.</p>
<p>But if you want to listen to that episode</p>
<p>or watch that episode, you can access it hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>The question is, in your discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>you were talking about abstaining</p>
<p>from people&rsquo;s drug of choice for 30 days</p>
<p>to reset the dopamine reward pathway.</p>
<p>And indeed that is the prescriptive</p>
<p>that Dr. Anna Lembke gives for most all addictions</p>
<p>and for people that are suffering from mild</p>
<p>or even severe depression related</p>
<p>to dopamine seeking behaviors,</p>
<p>social media, video games, sex, food, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, of course, in the instance of food</p>
<p>or in some other addictions,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t abstain for 30 days, right?</p>
<p>That would be terrible to abstain for food for 30 days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure people have done it, but it is not healthy to do.</p>
<p>Certain things like alcohol and drugs,</p>
<p>people can abstain for 30 days</p>
<p>in efforts to never go back to them again.</p>
<p>There are cases of severe alcohol or opiate dependence</p>
<p>where people can&rsquo;t go cold turkey or they risk dying.</p>
<p>So there they need to really work with a physician.</p>
<p>But the 30 day reset of the dopamine system</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s very real.</p>
<p>And that pertains to most people.</p>
<p>That is, it&rsquo;s going to be very effective</p>
<p>for most people struggling with either behavioral,</p>
<p>what are sometimes called process addictions</p>
<p>or other types of addictions,</p>
<p>including substance abuse issues.</p>
<p>The question continues,</p>
<p>you said you were going to ask Anna how to abstain</p>
<p>if your drug of choice is a thought or narrative</p>
<p>as opposed to a substance or a behavior.</p>
<p>The question continues,</p>
<p>as far as I can tell your discussion with Anna moved on</p>
<p>before you asked her the question.</p>
<p>Would you be able to discuss strategies</p>
<p>for abstaining from addictive thoughts and narratives?</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about intrusive thoughts</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s start off by asking ourselves,</p>
<p>what is a thought?</p>
<p>Okay, in the realm of neurobiology,</p>
<p>we have sensations,</p>
<p>which are the processes by which our neurons,</p>
<p>nerve cells convert light photons, sound waves,</p>
<p>touch, mechanical pressure, et cetera,</p>
<p>into electrical signals and chemical signals</p>
<p>that head into our nervous system, including our brain.</p>
<p>And then our brain, at least we think makes sense of them</p>
<p>and help us navigate the world that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Okay, so the sensation part</p>
<p>is a pure transformation of mechanical information</p>
<p>or in some cases, chemical information, like smell,</p>
<p>chemicals, literally volatile chemicals</p>
<p>floating around in the world</p>
<p>are brought into your nose</p>
<p>and your neurons in your olfactory bulb</p>
<p>convert those into electrical and chemical signals</p>
<p>that your brain can understand.</p>
<p>Perceptions are your idea</p>
<p>of what those signals out in the world are,</p>
<p>either because you&rsquo;re paying attention to them</p>
<p>or for some other reason,</p>
<p>you decide that a stop sign in front of you is red</p>
<p>and that the sign behind it is white</p>
<p>and that the sky is blue or cloudy.</p>
<p>Those are perceptions, okay?</p>
<p>So we have sensations and perceptions.</p>
<p>Then we have emotions,</p>
<p>which are these things that include the mind and body</p>
<p>that are related to neuromodulators</p>
<p>like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera,</p>
<p>although those chemicals do other things as well.</p>
<p>And then of course we have behaviors, actions,</p>
<p>everything from me moving my pen on a piece of paper</p>
<p>to walking, running, et cetera.</p>
<p>Thoughts are a fifth category of neural functioning</p>
<p>that we really need to define,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t have as strict a definition</p>
<p>as sensations, perceptions, or feeling, or action.</p>
<p>But thoughts are real, right?</p>
<p>We all know this, thoughts are real.</p>
<p>And one way that we can define thoughts</p>
<p>is that thoughts are perceptions</p>
<p>that include data from the past, present, or future, okay?</p>
<p>Or combinations of past and present</p>
<p>or present and future or future and past, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to give</p>
<p>an overly complicated definition here,</p>
<p>but if we are going to answer a question</p>
<p>about how to abstain from thoughts</p>
<p>in a really direct and actionable way,</p>
<p>we really need to address what are thoughts.</p>
<p>So thoughts are perceptions</p>
<p>that are generated internally, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need any external sensation</p>
<p>in order to have a thought.</p>
<p>We can close our eyes.</p>
<p>We could be in sensory isolation for that matter.</p>
<p>We can be floating with no gravity,</p>
<p>and we can have a thought.</p>
<p>Thoughts tend to run pretty much automatically</p>
<p>in the background all the time.</p>
<p>Some people refer to this as chatter</p>
<p>in the back of our minds in a very unstructured way.</p>
<p>And then if we force our thoughts to be structured</p>
<p>because we decide they need to be,</p>
<p>or if something in our environment captures our perception,</p>
<p>then our thoughts tend to be structured.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m just walking around,</p>
<p>if there were a way in which we could broadcast my thoughts</p>
<p>onto a screen, I hope we wouldn&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>but those thoughts would be a mixture</p>
<p>of semi-complete sentences and gibberish.</p>
<p>However, if somebody stops me and says,</p>
<p>hi, good to see you, what are you doing today?</p>
<p>And I start answering, well, then my thoughts</p>
<p>are suddenly being driven by an external stimulus,</p>
<p>their question, and some internal ideas,</p>
<p>memory of who I am and what I&rsquo;m doing that day,</p>
<p>so past and present, and so on.</p>
<p>And so thoughts become structured.</p>
<p>So when we have a question</p>
<p>about how to abstain from thoughts,</p>
<p>we need to be additionally specific</p>
<p>and really pinpoint that what we&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>is to abstain from thoughts we don&rsquo;t want, presumably,</p>
<p>either because they are too repetitive and distracting,</p>
<p>or because what&rsquo;s contained in those thoughts is disturbing.</p>
<p>Okay, this is important because it gives us two answers</p>
<p>to the questions that are highly divergent.</p>
<p>One answer to the question of how to abstain</p>
<p>from intrusive thoughts, you know,</p>
<p>thoughts that we&rsquo;re addicted to,</p>
<p>is if those thoughts are merely on loop all the time,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t stop them,</p>
<p>but the thoughts themselves aren&rsquo;t particularly disturbing,</p>
<p>so think about a song you can&rsquo;t get out of your head,</p>
<p>or you keep recounting some event,</p>
<p>but the event itself isn&rsquo;t very disturbing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just intrusive because it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, the data really point</p>
<p>to trying to anchor your thoughts</p>
<p>to some external stimulus.</p>
<p>So getting into action, getting into activities</p>
<p>that really draw your attention away from that thought.</p>
<p>Now, you may still hear it scrolling in the background,</p>
<p>so you might be sitting in class</p>
<p>still hearing that loop of thoughts in the background.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that over time ought to wane,</p>
<p>it ought to disappear.</p>
<p>If we try and bring more and more attention</p>
<p>to whatever it is that&rsquo;s in our environment,</p>
<p>whatever it is that we happen to be learning</p>
<p>or doing physically, et cetera.</p>
<p>Things like mindful meditation,</p>
<p>doing a 10 or even just five-minute-a-day practice</p>
<p>of sitting with eyes closed or lying down with eyes closed</p>
<p>and really focusing on one&rsquo;s breath,</p>
<p>focusing one&rsquo;s attention on the,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s called the third eye center,</p>
<p>but in science, we&rsquo;d say just the region</p>
<p>right behind the forehead,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re directing your attention there,</p>
<p>has been shown to increase focus for singular topics</p>
<p>and can improve memory</p>
<p>and do a bunch of other things as well.</p>
<p>Those are data from Dr. Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at New York University.</p>
<p>She was a guest on the podcast as well.</p>
<p>My laboratory has run studies on mindful meditation</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re really trying to do</p>
<p>is learn how to focus better on one thing</p>
<p>and by focusing on that one thing,</p>
<p>you focus off these repetitive thoughts.</p>
<p>Now, I have a feeling that this question was asked</p>
<p>and that many people upvoted this question</p>
<p>because the issue isn&rsquo;t just thoughts that are intrusive</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re there and on repeat,</p>
<p>but because the thoughts themselves are actually troubling.</p>
<p>This could be recounting a trauma, someone harmed you,</p>
<p>you observed something that was disturbing,</p>
<p>you felt wronged, you felt someone else was wronged,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t seem to get your mind off of something</p>
<p>and your emotions tend to follow.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this is the root of the question.</p>
<p>In that case, the approach is very different.</p>
<p>What we know from essentially all of the quality scientific</p>
<p>and clinical studies is that those sorts</p>
<p>of intrusive thoughts are very much like a trauma.</p>
<p>Now we have to be clear in defining what trauma is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the definition that Dr. Paul Conti,</p>
<p>another incredible guest that was on our podcast,</p>
<p>a psychiatrist, Stanford Harvard trained psychiatrist,</p>
<p>I think one of the world&rsquo;s foremost leaders</p>
<p>on the issue of trauma and psychiatry</p>
<p>and psychology generally.</p>
<p>He defines trauma as an event or something</p>
<p>that fundamentally changes the way</p>
<p>that your nervous system works</p>
<p>such that you function less adaptively going forward</p>
<p>from that event.</p>
<p>So not every bad occurrence in your life is a trauma.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good news.</p>
<p>The bad news is many people have traumas</p>
<p>and traumas change the way that our nervous system works</p>
<p>so that we don&rsquo;t function as well as we could.</p>
<p>So in that sense, intrusive thoughts that are disturbing</p>
<p>are in many ways traumas and are reinforcing that trauma.</p>
<p>Now we know that almost counterintuitively</p>
<p>in order to deal with trauma,</p>
<p>you have to get very close to that trauma.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to re-expose</p>
<p>and I would hope you would not re-expose yourself</p>
<p>to the very same trauma,</p>
<p>but we know that one of the best ways to deal with traumas</p>
<p>is to get very clear about the narrative</p>
<p>around those traumas.</p>
<p>Now this can be done with a therapist ideally,</p>
<p>but not everyone has access to therapy</p>
<p>or can afford therapy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a range of quality of therapists for that matter.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re always referring to the desire for people</p>
<p>to do great therapy with really great,</p>
<p>meaning excellently trained people.</p>
<p>But it turns out that if you want to extinguish</p>
<p>an intrusive thought, one of the best ways to do that</p>
<p>is to journal about that particular thought extensively.</p>
<p>So rather than the earlier strategy for intrusive thoughts</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just on loop and intrusive</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re on loop and present,</p>
<p>but their content isn&rsquo;t disturbing,</p>
<p>when a thought is disturbing and intrusive,</p>
<p>we know that it&rsquo;s very useful to script out</p>
<p>as much detail about that particular thought</p>
<p>and the things around it as possible.</p>
<p>Obviously you want to do this in a way</p>
<p>that is fairly structured.</p>
<p>So you ideally would use complete sentences.</p>
<p>So the reason for doing that is that thoughts,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier, can often be fragmentary.</p>
<p>So they pop up in our mind almost seemingly spontaneously.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re inhibiting our ability to focus</p>
<p>or be present to work or family or other things or sleep.</p>
<p>Writing things down in a lot of detail</p>
<p>does seem to have this quality</p>
<p>of both reducing the emotional load</p>
<p>of whatever it is that that thought is about,</p>
<p>as well as diminishing the frequency</p>
<p>of those intrusive thoughts over time.</p>
<p>So this is far and away different</p>
<p>than the strategy I mentioned</p>
<p>for the other types of intrusive thoughts.</p>
<p>And really it&rsquo;s far and away different</p>
<p>from the 30-day abstinence approach</p>
<p>that Dr. Anna Lembke was talking about</p>
<p>for substance or behavioral addictions.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this process of abstaining from thoughts</p>
<p>or removing the addictive nature of certain thoughts</p>
<p>can definitely take some time.</p>
<p>So a good example there would be superstitions.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll come clean here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about this before on a few podcasts</p>
<p>that when I was in college,</p>
<p>I developed a sort of knock on wood superstition.</p>
<p>Anytime I&rsquo;d say something that I didn&rsquo;t want to happen</p>
<p>or did want to happen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say knock on wood and I&rsquo;d knock on wood.</p>
<p>And then I started suppressing the behavior</p>
<p>mostly because it was a little embarrassing.</p>
<p>And then I started just telling myself in my head,</p>
<p>knock on wood, knock on wood, knock on wood.</p>
<p>And it was clearly a little bit of an OCD type thing.</p>
<p>But again, OCD in air quotes here.</p>
<p>I think it qualified as OCD in the sense</p>
<p>that the more I did it, the more I wanted to do it.</p>
<p>So I needed to go cold turkey on the thinking,</p>
<p>but how can you go cold turkey on a thought?</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What I was told to do and what worked very well for me</p>
<p>was to just write down the worst possible outcome</p>
<p>that I was concerned about.</p>
<p>So to really get close to the nature</p>
<p>or the underlying basis of that intrusive thought.</p>
<p>And I raised this because a lot of times</p>
<p>the intrusive thought is not,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m thinking about a car accident</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m thinking about a breakup</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m thinking about an exam that I have.</p>
<p>That can be intrusive, but a lot of times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some kind of nebulous, abstract set of words</p>
<p>or ideas or images around something that happened</p>
<p>that we saw or heard or experienced.</p>
<p>And by putting a lot of clear structure</p>
<p>to what the thought is exactly</p>
<p>and to putting some thought and structure onto paper</p>
<p>about what that pattern of not healthy thinking relates to,</p>
<p>people often achieve tremendous relief</p>
<p>in a fairly short amount of time.</p>
<p>Sometimes just in one session of writing it down,</p>
<p>sometimes they need to write it down multiple times.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re essentially trying to do</p>
<p>with a intrusive thought or a trauma of any kind</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re trying to turn a disturbing story,</p>
<p>that is a story that evokes a lot of emotion</p>
<p>and captures, it kind of hijacks your nervous system</p>
<p>into what is essentially a known but repetitive</p>
<p>and kind of old, boring story</p>
<p>where the emotional load has been depleted.</p>
<p>And there, of course, I have to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that getting sufficient rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>we also know is very important</p>
<p>for removing the emotional load of traumatic experiences</p>
<p>and intrusive thoughts.</p>
<p>So you really want to strive</p>
<p>to get the best possible sleep you can</p>
<p>that includes sufficient rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>And we have multiple zero cost resources</p>
<p>for that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>We have the episode on master your sleep.</p>
<p>We have the episode on perfect your sleep.</p>
<p>We have the toolkit for sleep, all of which are timestamped</p>
<p>and all of which can be accessed completely zero cost</p>
<p>to try and get your sleep as good as possible,</p>
<p>including lots of rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>So in order to remove intrusive and addictive thoughts,</p>
<p>ask yourself, is this OCD of the classic sense?</p>
<p>If it is, you should see a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t necessarily prescribe medication,</p>
<p>but there are tools for true OCD</p>
<p>that are very effective in many cases.</p>
<p>And we did the episode on OCD,</p>
<p>which I invite you to listen to as well.</p>
<p>You want to ask yourself, are the thoughts disturbing</p>
<p>or merely intrusive and repetitive?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re merely intrusive and repetitive,</p>
<p>well, then learning to focus your attention</p>
<p>on other things and getting better at focusing</p>
<p>on single things through an exercise</p>
<p>like mindfulness meditation can really help.</p>
<p>And indeed, perhaps the best use of mindfulness meditation</p>
<p>is to improve your level of focus.</p>
<p>It does have other benefits as well,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s going to be the major one</p>
<p>that one will experience even with these very short</p>
<p>five or 10 minute day meditations.</p>
<p>Great data on that from the scientific literature.</p>
<p>And then if those intrusive thoughts are not only intrusive,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also disturbing, in that case,</p>
<p>you really want to put as much structure</p>
<p>and thought, believe it or not,</p>
<p>into what those thoughts are really about.</p>
<p>Write them out on paper in complete sentences</p>
<p>and maybe do that multiple times</p>
<p>until the underlying emotions related to those thoughts</p>
<p>really start to diminish.</p>
<p>And by doing that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially doing your own form of trauma therapy,</p>
<p>for lack of a better way to put it.</p>
<p>And again, the data really point to the fact</p>
<p>that getting close to the specific details</p>
<p>around those intrusive thoughts</p>
<p>is going to be the best way to extinguish them.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining for the beginning</p>
<p>of this Ask Me Anything episode.</p>
<p>To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes</p>
<p>of these Ask Me Anything sessions,</p>
<p>plus to receive transcripts of them</p>
<p>and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard Channel</p>
<p>and premium tools not released anywhere else,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Just to remind you why we launched</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really twofold.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s to raise support</p>
<p>for the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast Channel,</p>
<p>which of course will still be continued</p>
<p>to be released every Monday in full length.</p>
<p>We are not going to change the format</p>
<p>or anything about the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>and to fund research,</p>
<p>in particular research done on human beings.</p>
<p>So not animal models, but on human beings,</p>
<p>which I think we all agree is a species</p>
<p>that we are most interested in.</p>
<p>And we are going to specifically fund research</p>
<p>that is aimed toward developing further protocols</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health and performance.</p>
<p>And those protocols will be distributed</p>
<p>through all channels, not just the Premium Channel,</p>
<p>but through all channels,</p>
<p>Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels.</p>
<p>So the idea here is to give you information</p>
<p>to your burning questions in depth</p>
<p>and allow you the opportunity to support</p>
<p>the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, an especially exciting feature of the Premium Channel</p>
<p>is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered</p>
<p>to do a dollar for dollar match</p>
<p>on all funds raised for research</p>
<p>through the Premium Channel.</p>
<p>So this is a terrific way that they&rsquo;re going to amplify</p>
<p>whatever funds come in through the Premium Channel</p>
<p>to further support research</p>
<p>for science and science-related tools</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health and performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to sign up</p>
<p>for the Huberman Lab Premium Channel,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s a cost of $10 per month,</p>
<p>or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.</p>
<p>That will give you access to all the AMAs.</p>
<p>You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll of course get answers</p>
<p>to all the questions that other people ask as well.</p>
<p>There will also be some premium content</p>
<p>such as transcripts of the AMAs</p>
<p>and various transcripts and protocols</p>
<p>of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;ll be supporting research</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health and performance.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the Premium Channel</p>
<p>by going to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
