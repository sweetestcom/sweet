<p>said nah because I know it&rsquo;s hard to have 911 fuck it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my little brother</p>
<p>acid&rsquo;s a little different you don&rsquo;t want to dose</p>
<p>somebody with acid no</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a decision just not</p>
<p>to do it anymore in my life because I&rsquo;ve gotten to a</p>
<p>point where my</p>
<p>brain I just want to keep my</p>
<p>brain a little bit together</p>
<p>now put it together</p>
<p>stay safe stay safe</p>
<p>about this stuff</p>
<p>this stuff is very mild</p>
<p>that was I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>that was kid</p>
<p>stuff that was</p>
<p>kiddies yeah well if you took 2 hits and you were</p>
<p>still being able to sit there then it had to be she</p>
<p>very mild very mild</p>
<p>it came in spurts and</p>
<p>burst it was very nice</p>
<p>the lights fucked with you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name</p>
<p>voice fucked with you from time to time</p>
<p>buffer buffer</p>
<p>he really vibrated</p>
<p>is vibrated you</p>
<p>and that video before the</p>
<p>UFC starts oh</p>
<p>that was powerful</p>
<p>there was a part</p>
<p>where Ari looked</p>
<p>over and goes this is the most beautiful</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>the best was</p>
<p>you do a good job</p>
<p>on that thing</p>
<p>what was it</p>
<p>the UFC video when it first</p>
<p>starts was like</p>
<p>they sent it to the who</p>
<p>american teenage hero</p>
<p>teenage wait wait</p>
<p>bob o&rsquo;reilly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the song yeah</p>
<p>and yeah they set all the beat like all the</p>
<p>punches to the you know</p>
<p>drum hits yeah</p>
<p>you realize how brilliant</p>
<p>something is sometimes when you&rsquo;re high what is it</p>
<p>about that why</p>
<p>do you why do you have to get high to to realize that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know it seems</p>
<p>silly when you&rsquo;re sitting there and you&rsquo;re straight</p>
<p>at a UFC and it</p>
<p>starts it was</p>
<p>like a zooph</p>
<p>and all that shit</p>
<p>you feel it yeah</p>
<p>we did the acid it was a different fucking</p>
<p>level we felt</p>
<p>everything isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>funny how like</p>
<p>you go to movies</p>
<p>and if you go to the</p>
<p>movies and you&rsquo;re on acid or on pot or in anything</p>
<p>see bad acting yeah</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>watch Domino</p>
<p>that night huh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we sat there and</p>
<p>watch Domino with fucking</p>
<p>Mickey Rourke and</p>
<p>Tara Nightling</p>
<p>and it was interesting yeah</p>
<p>it was interesting it was from a different</p>
<p>angle you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching acting you</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m sorry I</p>
<p>interrupted you so what were you saying you were saying</p>
<p>you guys are</p>
<p>there you&rsquo;re on acid and then the Bob o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>starts playing</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen it</p>
<p>never been to a live</p>
<p>UFC it&rsquo;s really brilliant whoever edited it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like some of the highlights of some of the</p>
<p>greatest fights ever</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all put together to the who</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>greatest videos</p>
<p>humans have ever seen it&rsquo;s a perfect volume</p>
<p>to rip you apart like</p>
<p>you can hear it but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really bother you</p>
<p>Dana and I go with it</p>
<p>Dana and I were</p>
<p>watching that the</p>
<p>other day and I go dude I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;ve seen this a fucking</p>
<p>thousand times and I</p>
<p>still like I</p>
<p>never yeah I</p>
<p>never stopped</p>
<p>watching it</p>
<p>love it if you&rsquo;re there live 10 minutes before the</p>
<p>UFC actually</p>
<p>starts you have to be in your seat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so good</p>
<p>to like whoever did it you can tell that guy loves</p>
<p>fights like he just he nailed it</p>
<p>the perfect</p>
<p>beats to the perfect fucking</p>
<p>punches and kicks and</p>
<p>gets you pumped up</p>
<p>definitely man</p>
<p>dude I&rsquo;m telling you it</p>
<p>never wears out I&rsquo;ve seen it</p>
<p>hundreds of times</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve seen it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it I mean</p>
<p>every UFC start I&rsquo;ve done at</p>
<p>least a hundred</p>
<p>Ufcs and you&rsquo;re there you&rsquo;re not yeah gone</p>
<p>getting food when that&rsquo;s happening yeah because between</p>
<p>spikes between</p>
<p>spike nights and regular Ufcs I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;ve done over a hundred so been over a thousand</p>
<p>fights well here&rsquo;s the best when you&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re tripping</p>
<p>like I said</p>
<p>when you there as a civilian</p>
<p>and listen it just goes from Bob o&rsquo;reilly</p>
<p>and it locks down</p>
<p>and also you get</p>
<p>also you just see a</p>
<p>picture and this is Silver saying</p>
<p>when I go in that</p>
<p>thing tonight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna knock his fucking</p>
<p>mouth off that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>right now yes think</p>
<p>about it on the ass</p>
<p>now his head just came out</p>
<p>and I think it was vito&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and it was just a fucking head</p>
<p>I thought it was fucking</p>
<p>Marlon Brando</p>
<p>is Superman</p>
<p>then when he got</p>
<p>yes when he had the fucking heads around them it was</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going down to New York City cocksucker</p>
<p>and they were judging them and it was just heads</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the brilliance about it</p>
<p>that at one point in the UFC as a civilian</p>
<p>it just gets very dark</p>
<p>it was just a perfect timing</p>
<p>also you see a head pop on go tonight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take them pound them submission you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>yeah you just go nuts and they keep showing</p>
<p>little tidbits you know then they showed a vet or</p>
<p>then they went to John Jones then they went to</p>
<p>Jake Ellensburg it was just</p>
<p>so well done every time I show a new item</p>
<p>production crowd explode yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s and when you watch another</p>
<p>sporting event now it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>below that par I went to a Lake A game</p>
<p>last year against Dick</p>
<p>against Wade wade&rsquo;s team the Heat</p>
<p>Miami yeah it was a fucking great game</p>
<p>but there was a lot of lows in it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of lows at the</p>
<p>UFC when Bruce Buffer says</p>
<p>Do what you got to do</p>
<p>go for 22 fucking minutes I like you have a blast</p>
<p>I like you go get a hot dog</p>
<p>right we are you go get fucking thing</p>
<p>we are now go go now hurry up before the fucking game</p>
<p>starts that&rsquo;s huge that they tell you</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s courtesy</p>
<p>and what that is</p>
<p>folks for the folks that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know sometimes we have a certain amount of prelim cards</p>
<p>but then the the main card</p>
<p>starts at say like</p>
<p>you know 7 p m</p>
<p>and if the main card</p>
<p>starts at 7 p m</p>
<p>we have to have if the prelims are all done</p>
<p>sometimes we got 20 minutes for the</p>
<p>fights are supposed to</p>
<p>start so we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>start fights</p>
<p>early we have to wait</p>
<p>until pay per view</p>
<p>starts yeah</p>
<p>sometimes you get like 5/1 round</p>
<p>knockouts in the early</p>
<p>fights yeah and they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>yeah and then</p>
<p>yeah we run out</p>
<p>quick and it was</p>
<p>weird because this</p>
<p>particular UFC</p>
<p>started off I</p>
<p>think with Gabe Ruecker</p>
<p>and whoever he fought</p>
<p>and Paul Taylor</p>
<p>and Paul he</p>
<p>got beat up fast</p>
<p>and then Kingsley came out</p>
<p>against Romero</p>
<p>and hit him with violent</p>
<p>Gladiator fucking</p>
<p>these to the body</p>
<p>like fucking Bam</p>
<p>to feel the thrust</p>
<p>and again as a</p>
<p>civilian you can feel the fucking kidney strikes</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have the acid I was I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>defining myself like this and also I looked around</p>
<p>and I just myself</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>check yourself before you</p>
<p>wreck yourself plus</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>Kingsbury even when you&rsquo;re not high that dude&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>specimen oh my God specimen</p>
<p>shredded he&rsquo;s got like a fucking</p>
<p>solid 12 pack</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a 12 pack on his back</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those dudes like you look at his back there&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>crazy striations in there he was a</p>
<p>super athlete</p>
<p>yeah those fucking</p>
<p>football players</p>
<p>man they&rsquo;re on another</p>
<p>level to another</p>
<p>level of athleticism</p>
<p>and Kingsbury</p>
<p>smash that dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys every time you see him it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>training for 3 years</p>
<p>you know he makes</p>
<p>these leaps in a couple of</p>
<p>months and I look</p>
<p>like yeah all those</p>
<p>super athletes man the John Jones</p>
<p>stunt dudes</p>
<p>those guys they make these</p>
<p>giant leaps you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s some dudes that just get so good so quick</p>
<p>you know when you</p>
<p>watch like John</p>
<p>Jones the first</p>
<p>fight that he had</p>
<p>you know or even the</p>
<p>fight with Stephan</p>
<p>Bonner yeah he looked</p>
<p>promising you know</p>
<p>but Bonner made it to the distance you know</p>
<p>I mean he beat Bonner up and</p>
<p>everything like that and did some wild stuff</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>people like wow this kid&rsquo;s wild he&rsquo;s unorthodox</p>
<p>but then you see him now and you go fuck man this kid</p>
<p>is on another level</p>
<p>dude another the way he handled Branned</p>
<p>Vera and you</p>
<p>know I mean his last</p>
<p>fight was just proved it Brian</p>
<p>bader&rsquo;s a fucking stud and he just manhandled that kid</p>
<p>he was on top of them</p>
<p>every time there</p>
<p>was an exchange he was on top controlling the position</p>
<p>he was never remotely threatened and</p>
<p>squeezing yeah that kid&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>beast man Ryan</p>
<p>Bader is a fucking gorilla</p>
<p>dude you just</p>
<p>stand next to that guy he&rsquo;s one of the biggest</p>
<p>205ers out there</p>
<p>and the fact that John</p>
<p>Jones was able to handle him like that</p>
<p>there was like 1/2</p>
<p>second where there was like a scrum like he</p>
<p>tried to flip</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t get him all the way over and then</p>
<p>John Jones got out of that and it was done</p>
<p>yeah and John</p>
<p>Jones has 2 brothers</p>
<p>and both of them are fucking football player bad</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s like his</p>

<p>what type of douchey</p>
<p>was way you can do it by</p>
<p>accident game you</p>
<p>go back we just come up like Shaq</p>

<p>smack him occasionally</p>
<p>yeah but not on purpose</p>
<p>he just fucking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so hard down</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking into it okay</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t done in a</p>
<p>while though when his</p>
<p>first couple</p>
<p>years me dude</p>
<p>I met him a couple of times when I</p>
<p>first met him with the</p>
<p>UFC and I met him</p>
<p>he did an episode of Fear Factor with me</p>
<p>and he did the</p>
<p>countdown you know like shit 3 2</p>
<p>one go you know</p>
<p>standing next to me dude it looked like</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>look like I mean look like we were 2 totally different</p>
<p>things you met him in Boston we ran</p>
<p>into him at the</p>
<p>hotel oh yeah that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s giant he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so big man he&rsquo;s so big it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous I feel like I like a little child</p>
<p>you know well this dude Daryl Dawkins</p>
<p>played for the Sixes and he got traded to the Nets</p>
<p>and when he</p>
<p>moved to New Jersey got hooked on fucking powder</p>
<p>did he really the</p>
<p>kid that would sell him the powder</p>
<p>was the sneaker kid</p>
<p>he was the ball kid on the Nets at that time</p>
<p>and this kid ran a</p>
<p>tremendous scam</p>
<p>because the players on contract</p>
<p>they take after</p>
<p>every game they put on new</p>
<p>sneakers and they</p>
<p>throw them away</p>
<p>really this kid</p>
<p>would take every</p>
<p>sneaker and take it into the city and sell it</p>
<p>but one of his</p>
<p>jobs as a ball boy was to get Daryl Dawkins powder</p>
<p>that was it</p>
<p>Brian whatever you did</p>
<p>and we all met and I remember one</p>
<p>night he took us at Daryl Dawkins house</p>
<p>Daryl Dawkins</p>
<p>showed me a fucking Rolls Royce</p>
<p>with a 14 motherfucking carrot</p>
<p>dash boy know what</p>
<p>a gold dashboard</p>
<p>that is so financially responsible you have no</p>
<p>fucking idea in those days</p>
<p>his wife died</p>
<p>later on he came back before a couple years there</p>
<p>I went over to his house like 3 times he</p>
<p>lived in the City</p>
<p>Caucus New Jersey</p>
<p>big pimping</p>
<p>with the motherfucking 14 carat</p>
<p>dashboard shit wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>that is ridiculous though you gotta love it though</p>
<p>what is it about</p>
<p>black people and</p>
<p>shiny things I don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t live in a tent to have a fucking Rolls Royce</p>
<p>with a 14 as</p>
<p>much as a star</p>
<p>as much as rock stars like to</p>
<p>rock it and like to look badass they don&rsquo;t go that deep</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t go diamonds I</p>
<p>heard a theory on that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that black people rappers and</p>
<p>stuff they&rsquo;re just doing what they thought</p>
<p>about was rich when they were little</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s always them holding like a bowl of like</p>
<p>sugar cereal</p>
<p>and cars and hot</p>
<p>booty women</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s like oh no this looks like rich stuff</p>
<p>for she was got a</p>
<p>urinal installed in his</p>
<p>house nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that that&rsquo;s probably a good move</p>
<p>especially one of</p>
<p>those splashless</p>
<p>splash is there</p>
<p>no say in there save</p>
<p>water they have</p>
<p>like a little disc little UFO you piss on</p>
<p>somehow another go somewhere</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>just rinse your</p>
<p>water yeah that&rsquo;s like the the latest eco thing</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>rejected by</p>
<p>plumbers plumbers don&rsquo;t like it because it cuts</p>
<p>back on the maintenance so they try to say unsanitary</p>
<p>but in actuality the</p>
<p>other ones are more unsanitary</p>
<p>how weird is that yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been studies Joe Diaz</p>
<p>studies on piss</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about urine</p>
<p>let me tell you something when I was a kid in the first</p>
<p>house I moved into</p>
<p>North Bergen</p>
<p>a nice big one</p>
<p>we had a fucking bidet</p>
<p>really you really yeah that&rsquo;s banging</p>
<p>shit wow that was about</p>
<p>hand 9 or 10</p>
<p>I used to go over there take a shit in my</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s bathroom turn the</p>
<p>bandana hit you in the fucking face you know I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>yeah but then you put your little</p>
<p>muffler on that bidet</p>

<p>water going that was the</p>
<p>first time I have that that little</p>
<p>cranky a little</p>
<p>muffler but then you</p>
<p>blasted hard</p>
<p>your asshole spotless you can feel it shiny</p>
<p>I was about 10</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what my asshole used to shine</p>
<p>I use my bidet</p>
<p>for carrying magazines</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t use it though you</p>
<p>never wash you have one</p>

<p>about shit too dangerous for the government</p>
<p>so they shut my whole motherfucking block down</p>
<p>you know what man it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a reality of living life as a rebel</p>
<p>what that&rsquo;s what it is the government</p>
<p>every now and then will come down and shut you down</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve done</p>

<p>you know they have like a</p>
<p>brief window like all</p>
<p>those girls that fucked</p>
<p>Tiger Woods</p>
<p>that one girl</p>
<p>the one girl that was on Celebrity Rehab</p>
<p>Rachel who should</p>

<p>tag he fucking</p>
<p>he always fuck the name of it a</p>
<p>weird way are</p>
<p>you Dick Swanson</p>
<p>you could tell you</p>
<p>should tell whatever it was whatever her name was</p>
<p>the woman got on a goddamn</p>
<p>television show for fucking a guy</p>
<p>I mean she literally did she&rsquo;s on Celebrity Rehab</p>
<p>well once you get on one of</p>
<p>those shows all you have to do is</p>
<p>start going to red carpet</p>
<p>things make yourself be</p>
<p>photographed and seen and you become a little celebrity</p>
<p>Monica Lewinsky fucked up</p>
<p>she just wanted a</p>
<p>clothing line</p>
<p>yeah well she&rsquo;s also just a mess too</p>
<p>I mean whatever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>worst situation</p>
<p>ever it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just fucking a guy you suck the president&rsquo;s dick</p>
<p>okay if you fuck</p>
<p>Tiger Woods and you&rsquo;re that</p>
<p>famous if you fucked the president</p>
<p>or sucked his dick or lives to get</p>
<p>a cigar and</p>
<p>your pussy oh</p>
<p>super famous yeah the</p>
<p>part of what she was</p>
<p>famous for is the fact that she was ugly and fat oh</p>
<p>yeah sad that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right it was sad</p>
<p>you know her looking face yeah I mean and</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>weird nobody</p>
<p>could believe that he really did it</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never had a fucking</p>
<p>freak president like that before</p>
<p>I mean Kennedy was a freak</p>
<p>but Kennedy was like a</p>
<p>freak with a tie on</p>
<p>you know he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>whipping his</p>
<p>dick out in meetings he probably was yes he was me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no fucking face</p>
<p>I think he was</p>
<p>smarter now the way he handled himself I</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>smarter than that</p>
<p>Clinton has a long</p>
<p>standing reputation</p>
<p>for pulling his dick out</p>
<p>he got barely in the</p>
<p>road though</p>
<p>just pull it</p>
<p>out the president</p>
<p>got the the Poly</p>
<p>Shore moves</p>
<p>yeah got in the</p>
<p>green room if you&rsquo;re at the back there with Poly</p>
<p>Shore expect his dick out but JFK</p>
<p>never know right</p>
<p>JFK got the hottest</p>
<p>chick possible</p>
<p>in Hollywood he got the fucking Megan Fox</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s warm</p>
<p>but I think at that</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>JFK was like he was a way smoother</p>
<p>you know I mean he was like</p>
<p>way more like socially conscious everyone knew about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>sort of everyone knew but no one talked</p>
<p>about Birthday Miss</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t prove it</p>
<p>back then nobody talked and you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prove shit he was bad to the bone</p>
<p>how he did it when you go to michele&rsquo;s in Hollywood</p>
<p>and when you eat downstairs</p>
<p>if you look up you go to the men&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bathroom up there is a little cave in there that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where he used to take it</p>
<p>really up this little cave</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>where you lock</p>
<p>the doors like a VIP</p>
<p>give everybody fucking 500</p>
<p>you just sign</p>
<p>no way you sign nothing just looking in the eye</p>
<p>cause nobody knows</p>
<p>about this you</p>
<p>understand you</p>
<p>wanna go up there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it back then you</p>
<p>could do that if you were</p>
<p>a star you could go</p>
<p>places and they</p>
<p>would have girls waiting for you I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure Jack Nicholson</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>those guys can never be</p>
<p>married they&rsquo;re like what are you talking</p>
<p>about I can make</p>
<p>one phone call</p>
<p>right now and they give</p>
<p>me the fucking password to the back room and I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know that girl&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>yeah we just fucked and</p>
<p>these girls just come in on buses from Kansas</p>
<p>just waiting</p>
<p>to fuck movie stars</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s probably what they did fuck Kennedy</p>
<p>fucked all of them</p>
<p>nobody could say anything and even if they did nobody</p>
<p>would believe you anyway</p>
<p>I mean look</p>
<p>they got away with</p>
<p>shooting Kennedy</p>
<p>get away with fucking war</p>
<p>you know what I mean</p>
<p>they fucking got away</p>
<p>with killing him man you know they blamed it on one guy</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>one guy gets shot conveniently by a mobster</p>
<p>who we were recently talking to that</p>
<p>said that they were working on some kind of</p>
<p>thing that had</p>
<p>something to do with the Kennedy assassination</p>
<p>and he was like</p>
<p>the one thing that</p>
<p>I now believe in different is that single bullet theory</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>to it remember we were just talking to somebody</p>
<p>about that yeah</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember who it was he was talking</p>
<p>about how the</p>
<p>angles they misrepresented the</p>
<p>angles and the angles of</p>
<p>going in and coming out of the body are possible</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all well and good but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely unscientific</p>
<p>the way they came up with this theory</p>
<p>the way they come up with this theory is</p>
<p>cause they had to account for</p>
<p>3 bullets right</p>
<p>and 3 bullets had to have done all that damage</p>
<p>but then a guy</p>
<p>under the underpass got hit with a ricochet</p>
<p>and they had a hole in the curb</p>
<p>stone where it hit</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>got hit with it and he had to go to the hospital</p>
<p>and he was fine he lived</p>
<p>but because of the fact that he got hit with this</p>
<p>ricochet they knew that there was another bullet</p>
<p>so that bullet</p>
<p>definitely didn&rsquo;t hit</p>
<p>there was 3 shots</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these wounds so how do you account for all</p>
<p>these wounds</p>
<p>well you say there&rsquo;s more than one person</p>
<p>shooting you dumb fuck</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t try to make one bullet do all this</p>
<p>wacky shit when a</p>
<p>bunch of people have said that they</p>
<p>heard bullets</p>
<p>and heard gunshots</p>
<p>from several</p>
<p>different locations including over and over again the</p>
<p>grassy knoll</p>
<p>and then when you find out all</p>
<p>these people that witnessed it</p>
<p>all these people died in like</p>
<p>weird fucking accidents and fucking</p>
<p>car accidents and fires and parking</p>
<p>their car and</p>
<p>train tracks and shit like that</p>
<p>like the amount of people that</p>
<p>died that were witness to the Kennedy assassinations</p>
<p>fucking crazy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like really</p>
<p>weird and then you look at how this Jack Ruby guy</p>
<p>runs in and</p>
<p>shoots Lee Harvey Oswald</p>
<p>while the cops are handing them there</p>
<p>I mean the whole</p>
<p>thing was preposterous</p>
<p>it looks so set up and so fake</p>
<p>and the to blame this one guy</p>
<p>and to say that he did it</p>
<p>this one bullet a single bullet is so</p>
<p>silly because</p>
<p>if you look at that bullet it&rsquo;s barely dented</p>
<p>that bullet</p>
<p>had to go through bone and to people&rsquo;s bodies</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;ve ever shot a bullet into something man you</p>
<p>could hit a</p>
<p>phone book with a bullet it gets fucked up</p>
<p>it compresses it looks</p>
<p>jagged wasn&rsquo;t there pieces</p>
<p>found though yes more</p>
<p>pieces were</p>
<p>found in connolly&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re missing from this bullet</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s preposterous so all this fucking single</p>
<p>bullet theory</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they just go has there anyone to say what</p>
<p>about that though nobody</p>
<p>would there has been yeah</p>
<p>you know people will</p>
<p>just fucking Ra</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>what is it called</p>
<p>confirmation bias is what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>is when you have an idea in your</p>
<p>head and you know I&rsquo;ve been accused of it many times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>thing where you have an idea in your head you</p>
<p>want that idea to be correct and so you only look at</p>
<p>information that confirms that that</p>
<p>that you talked</p>
<p>about that because the philosophers they</p>
<p>would have that idea</p>
<p>and they would say okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re not sure but they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s true let&rsquo;s just look at the facts</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>tricky man it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>tricky when you get into people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beliefs and what you believe and what you don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of people that don&rsquo;t want to believe certain</p>
<p>things and then</p>
<p>the Kennedy assassination is one of them</p>
<p>the idea that</p>
<p>the government actually killed the sitting president</p>
<p>that freaks people out too much are you making</p>
<p>phone calls</p>
<p>mother what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other side though</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the other side of them</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the other side though</p>
<p>what are they saying by the side</p>
<p>they believe that he</p>
<p>you know even though he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>known as a good shot and even though he you know</p>
<p>the whole thing is really no for the</p>
<p>single bullet</p>
<p>alone like what did they say</p>
<p>about the other pieces</p>
<p>found in it not matching up I don&rsquo;t know I haven&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>heard the who&rsquo;s the day at this point they probably</p>
<p>dispute the evidence there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different people man there&rsquo;s 2 camps oh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like is there someone in charge to like</p>
<p>release this</p>
<p>information like no one&rsquo;s hiding this information or</p>
<p>who are they asking for well there are</p>
<p>there are definitely hidden papers</p>
<p>yeah but those</p>
<p>papers are set</p>
<p>to be released to like 2025 or something fucking</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>in charge of that there&rsquo;s no they&rsquo;re not like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get someone to admit it</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s true and at this</p>
<p>point in time it gets it gets to the</p>
<p>point where is anybody that was you know</p>
<p>live then yeah</p>
<p>4 years ago 50 years ago</p>
<p>our inspector</p>
<p>still alive though</p>
<p>he was part of the Warren</p>
<p>Commission report the people that were on the Warren</p>
<p>Commission report see the reason why I got into this</p>
<p>is the very conspiracy that got me into conspiracies</p>
<p>I read a book called Best Evidence by</p>
<p>David Lipton</p>
<p>and I was in Philadelphia and I was working Andy scar</p>
<p>patty&rsquo;s Comedy Cabarets</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>gigs you&rsquo;d go on the road and you do a Friday and</p>
<p>Saturday and Saturday morning you have nothing to do</p>
<p>and I was by myself I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>other comics I didn&rsquo;t hang out with them</p>
<p>so I got a book and</p>
<p>a buddy of mine</p>
<p>gave me this book and I read it and I fucking</p>
<p>freaked out</p>
<p>I freaked out to the</p>
<p>point where I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>funny that night</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a good set</p>
<p>you know I had to come back</p>
<p>strong on Sunday I had to put the book down</p>
<p>and on Sunday I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t read the book I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t read</p>
<p>it all day and I just like went to the gym or something</p>
<p>because I knew I</p>
<p>would get bummed out because I had a bad set Saturday</p>
<p>night because this book</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking creepy book man</p>
<p>this guy David Lipton was an accountant</p>
<p>and he went deep into</p>
<p>the Kennedy assassinations he went deep into the Warren</p>
<p>commission&rsquo;s report</p>
<p>and he read</p>
<p>every volume</p>
<p>and nobody ever</p>
<p>expected anybody to do that</p>
<p>and he was an accountant so he was like very meticulous</p>
<p>about details</p>
<p>and he noticed</p>
<p>all these inconsistencies and all</p>
<p>these irregularities and all</p>
<p>these times</p>
<p>where contradicted itself it&rsquo;s over and over</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s like this is a nonsense report</p>
<p>and he started</p>
<p>looking deep into the Kennedy</p>
<p>assassination because of that and then he</p>
<p>found so many different things</p>
<p>he just it&rsquo;s a long ass fucking</p>
<p>thing to get into</p>
<p>but the bottom line is</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the fuck happened that&rsquo;s the reality I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe Lee Harvey Oswald did act</p>
<p>alone but I know a lot of people want to</p>
<p>think that he did and I don&rsquo;t know why they want to</p>
<p>think that you know what I mean</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know and you don&rsquo;t know either</p>
<p>but you want to believe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely 100</p>
<p>right to the actor</p>
<p>alone there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of employees and employee families at the BP company</p>
<p>yeah the ones that killed Kennedy</p>
<p>they would if they could</p>
<p>people like BP if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that in the midst of this gigantic oil</p>
<p>spill if there was one guy that knew something that</p>
<p>could get them fucked</p>
<p>if there was one guy</p>
<p>that was gonna go public and knew something and he was</p>
<p>gonna cost them billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p>what do you think they would do to that guy</p>
<p>Joey</p>
<p>Joey ate a pop cookie</p>
<p>and he hit the</p>
<p>vaporizer when the</p>
<p>power went out so did Joey</p>
<p>he needed the electricity in the air</p>
<p>you stopped bro</p>
<p>weird it&rsquo;s a fucking guy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so high</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so high you don&rsquo;t even know what talking</p>
<p>about BP isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about do you think that what I mean</p>
<p>you know when you look at a</p>
<p>giant corporation like that don&rsquo;t you assume that they</p>
<p>would do something to try to protect themselves</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re assuming that budget</p>
<p>they assume that shit&rsquo;s gonna happen they just roll</p>
<p>right over it</p>
<p>their job primarily to corporation is to get</p>
<p>what they could</p>
<p>every day even with fines</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m saying do you think oh</p>
<p>do you think that they</p>
<p>would kill somebody that had some information</p>
<p>oh fuck yeah fuck yeah yeah of course</p>
<p>make their life</p>
<p>listen corporate</p>
<p>world is worse than any</p>
<p>world you&rsquo;ve seen before</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the real country</p>
<p>side of life well we talked</p>
<p>about it on this podcast it&rsquo;s a fucking very creepy</p>
<p>story but it does</p>
<p>bring again just because this subject</p>
<p>Monsanto that</p>
<p>food corporation that&rsquo;s always suing farmers</p>
<p>the ones that make the genetically modified food</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed that they bought</p>
<p>black water</p>
<p>the mercenary</p>
<p>group yeah yeah</p>
<p>they bought it through some</p>
<p>3rd party company</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t confirm or deny but they know that they were</p>
<p>looking at it and they were looking and talks to and</p>
<p>Blackwater was purchased and so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that believe that</p>
<p>Blackwater a</p>
<p>mercenary group</p>
<p>was purchased</p>
<p>by the most ruthless corporation in the world</p>
<p>like they have</p>
<p>their own army</p>
<p>wrap your head around that</p>
<p>wrap your head around that because what</p>
<p>black water does in</p>
<p>other countries</p>
<p>I mean when you hear about</p>
<p>the shit that they did the</p>
<p>mercenaries did in Iraq I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s no rules</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>first episode of The Cape</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like they can get away</p>
<p>with shit too and they can&rsquo;t get arrested for things</p>
<p>when they come but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not subject</p>
<p>to our rules</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very weird but not subject to</p>
<p>their rules either</p>
<p>no rules nobody&rsquo;s rules we</p>
<p>bring them back</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t get in</p>
<p>trouble we don&rsquo;t prosecute them for anything</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m sure some of you getting</p>
<p>started getting in</p>
<p>trouble the</p>
<p>whole business is insane you know</p>
<p>when I was a kid and you know you hear about like</p>
<p>the Vietnam War like</p>
<p>you know people talk</p>
<p>about how much</p>
<p>money is involved in the Vietnam War</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really realize what they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>until you see it like with Haliburton</p>
<p>and when you see it like with</p>
<p>mercenaries all this</p>
<p>you see like how much</p>
<p>money you can make</p>
<p>building plans it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible how much</p>
<p>money there is in that you</p>
<p>think black</p>
<p>water does like</p>
<p>brings out like comedians out there</p>
<p>to just irritate the</p>
<p>troops yeah because that</p>
<p>would be way</p>
<p>better guys</p>
<p>I bet they probably just go with horse</p>
<p>yeah no I am I</p>
<p>heard about this</p>
<p>story about Guy Richie</p>
<p>did you hear about Guy Richie</p>
<p>what did he do guy richie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house they fucking squatted his house man</p>
<p>guy ritchie&rsquo;s house is like he got a Ôø°6,000,000</p>
<p>house so I think that&rsquo;s like 12 million dollars</p>
<p>right on there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s pretty crazy</p>
<p>and he has this giant London mansion and</p>
<p>these guys moved into it</p>
<p>and they put signs out hanging from his windows</p>
<p>so it says strike Resist Occupy</p>
<p>and this is a giant mansion</p>
<p>in the middle of London who are they just bums</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just fucking kids</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s the strike resistance</p>
<p>squatters are weird things man squatters</p>
<p>are right you have to yeah they have certain rights</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>do they have rights in America or just</p>
<p>really yeah we&rsquo;ll take that there because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like possessionists not tensile laws</p>
<p>until we figure out in a court</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s supposed to be here we can&rsquo;t kick out</p>
<p>like if I just came to your</p>
<p>front door and said that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>house get him out of here like they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do that they&rsquo;d like well he&rsquo;s here right now</p>
<p>right so if you want to sue him to get him out of here</p>
<p>right go through the process of the courts</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what these people are trying I don&rsquo;t know I</p>
<p>think in England</p>
<p>I think in England it&rsquo;s even more complicated</p>
<p>yeah in England</p>
<p>I mean like if you&rsquo;re not actually living in the house</p>
<p>I think you</p>
<p>might be fucked</p>
<p>they might be able to just</p>
<p>gank your shit just get it there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>what happens</p>
<p>do they just get your shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>weird man a neighbor who did not want to be</p>
<p>named described the situation as</p>
<p>frustrating</p>
<p>Jake you think so</p>
<p>these people have these</p>
<p>multi multi million dollar</p>
<p>houses if it&rsquo;s a neighbor if his</p>
<p>house is worth 12 million</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got to be in that neighborhood</p>
<p>you guys are</p>
<p>paying that much</p>
<p>money for a fucking</p>
<p>house and then some kids just move in and</p>
<p>throw the batteries</p>
<p>out your windows</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>scary you just gangsta</p>
<p>your fucking</p>
<p>house you can&rsquo;t come back</p>
<p>oh they&rsquo;re calling it a</p>
<p>school oh this is creepy</p>
<p>school is doing</p>
<p>it they pretend no they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s a free school</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re opening up his</p>
<p>house as a school</p>
<p>can he go oh my God</p>
<p>I need to read this here this is</p>
<p>fucking fascinating that a big sign</p>
<p>they call themselves the Really Free School</p>
<p>they had been</p>
<p>occupying a nearby address</p>
<p>until Sunday</p>
<p>they invaded Mr richie&rsquo;s property</p>
<p>near london&rsquo;s West End</p>
<p>which he has</p>
<p>never lived in but has recently had</p>
<p>renovated so he&rsquo;s just balling he&rsquo;s just got</p>
<p>houses all over the</p>
<p>place is he</p>

<p>about those are</p>
<p>reality here</p>
<p>before you get involved in true</p>
<p>enough like a Puerto Rican we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about guy Richie</p>
<p>Brown we gotta figure something out here though</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it funny when you do</p>
<p>bring up anytime you bring up any sort of</p>
<p>conspiracy theories it all automatically goes into that</p>
<p>I just tune out</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m just like I don&rsquo;t even care</p>
<p>even me describing it I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>bored with it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s like no one knows</p>
<p>no one cares and you know</p>
<p>what sometimes I get</p>
<p>stoned when I</p>
<p>catch myself</p>
<p>thinking of</p>
<p>things as conspiracies yeah</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s do even that even that</p>
<p>night at the UFC</p>
<p>when when as soon as I</p>
<p>was gonna fight them</p>
<p>I thought to myself fuck I fucked up</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>gonna get beat</p>
<p>and now this is a setup</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take it to Brazil for anderson&rsquo;s V</p>
<p>door too that&rsquo;s what I thought before</p>
<p>you believe</p>
<p>crazy shit like yeah I believe</p>
<p>on the acid you can believe but no no I believe it was</p>
<p>sports because I see it happen</p>
<p>I see the weirdest</p>
<p>fucking thing</p>
<p>happening no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t that level</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen no but a</p>
<p>part of you</p>
<p>thinks about it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>it might have happened a little bit in</p>
<p>Japan there were some works in</p>
<p>Japan really yeah Coleman</p>
<p>might have been involved in a work</p>
<p>if you guys were in works allegedly</p>
<p>these guys like Takada</p>
<p>takada was a pro</p>
<p>wrestler in</p>
<p>Japan he had a few questionable wins</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>looked his wins are like this guy just seems like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s bullshitting like something feels like acting here</p>
<p>you know he a few few</p>
<p>he got away with</p>
<p>a few of them but that&rsquo;s it I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never I don&rsquo;t see any</p>
<p>fights that I</p>
<p>think are fights</p>
<p>where people set</p>
<p>things up no no</p>
<p>no I don&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>it like that the US you don&rsquo;t ever take it</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t saying</p>
<p>it like that I&rsquo;m just saying you&rsquo;re just saying you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>God no no no</p>
<p>speaking of being high I talk to you about some</p>
<p>this acupunctures for 4 years</p>
<p>right and I really like it</p>
<p>today I went in there she cut me</p>
<p>for me you know she cut me cut when they cut me and</p>
<p>she came back in from the cup and she&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>you were coming here for 4 years</p>
<p>because you were smoking a lot of fucking refill lately</p>
<p>each cup was filled to the fucking brim it</p>
<p>sucked it on my what</p>
<p>spell smoke out whoa no no</p>
<p>like I get these cups you know</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s pretty funny like I was sitting for they</p>
<p>leave marks on you yeah can I see a Mark yeah</p>
<p>for like a day just so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s like a silver dollar size thing</p>
<p>one way over here</p>
<p>back more and stuff</p>
<p>it was pretty funny how</p>
<p>I was sitting there for me</p>
<p>thinking of fire this bitch</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>telling me I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke so she was</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s telling not to no no she goes I think you</p>
<p>smoke a little</p>
<p>bit too much because it filled up the cups like</p>
<p>but filled it up with what fill</p>
<p>up with like the</p>
<p>smoke that&rsquo;s in your skin</p>
<p>what smoke came</p>
<p>out of your skin</p>
<p>smoke came out of your skin</p>
<p>for a little</p>
<p>while get the fuck out</p>
<p>of here fuck yeah</p>
<p>fuck yeah that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>first time we&rsquo;ve discussed it</p>
<p>that would be enough</p>
<p>we need to bring in Mythbusters on this</p>
<p>this motherfucker doesn&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination</p>
<p>I was thinking</p>
<p>about this in 1987</p>
<p>in 1987 I got convicted I got came out on bail</p>
<p>and part of the program you could jump into is</p>
<p>to prove that the court was wrong you&rsquo;d go volunteer</p>
<p>peeing a bottle flight</p>
<p>35 hours a week</p>
<p>and after like</p>
<p>3 weeks one day the assistant came up to me</p>
<p>let me tell</p>
<p>you something we don&rsquo;t know what he was smoking</p>
<p>but that motherfucker</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>used to go to New York and get you all the time we</p>
<p>this is a pure fucking Indica</p>
<p>made by Jamaicans for Jamaicans</p>
<p>and this lady pulled me aside she goes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in Boulder</p>
<p>for like 11 years</p>
<p>your shit was off the fucking charts</p>
<p>and you figure I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t stopped since then</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m living in here</p>
<p>living in this town</p>
<p>where at 8 30 in the</p>
<p>morning I can go to a weed shop and the guy says good</p>
<p>morning with a</p>
<p>bagel and a bun</p>
<p>wow and you know</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t even realize different it is how open</p>
<p>it is so I think Dr Amy</p>
<p>would you know I love Dr</p>
<p>Amy I wasn&rsquo;t mad that she just goes Joey</p>
<p>when you know</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been coming here for 4 years</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only been like</p>
<p>twice that it&rsquo;s leaked out of your fucking skin</p>
<p>one time when I went down a</p>
<p>Monday after a long weekend</p>
<p>and today&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>area on the podcast</p>
<p>get her take</p>
<p>off oh my God</p>
<p>and I trust</p>
<p>her because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of times I&rsquo;ve got in there</p>
<p>without me saying</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m feeling she&rsquo;s gone to that spot healed it</p>
<p>I said what&rsquo;s that needle for she was I</p>
<p>could just feel something coming from your</p>
<p>shoulder or knee or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>too much is this doctor one of your cats no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s feet down now</p>
<p>come here come daddy scratch me</p>
<p>well why is</p>
<p>she telling you that you do too much because the</p>
<p>smokes coming out of you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sold on the</p>
<p>vaporizer now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been into lately</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty good in your</p>
<p>throat that&rsquo;s a great one</p>
<p>yeah and I don&rsquo;t feel bad just getting my leg of</p>
<p>it you don&rsquo;t feel bad you don&rsquo;t cough</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel shitty</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pure THC with none of the health detractions</p>
<p>like now when I</p>
<p>smoke it I can feel</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking something in my</p>
<p>lungs I shouldn&rsquo;t be taking in my body I mean it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>it does doesn&rsquo;t hurt you</p>
<p>but it feels unhealthy well this is what I just read up</p>
<p>about it because I was trying to make sure I got the</p>
<p>right settings for my</p>
<p>vaporizer right</p>
<p>and they were like</p>
<p>certain things combusted a certain</p>
<p>so if you just if you said it&rsquo;s like a hundred degrees</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>T issue out of there right</p>
<p>like I said</p>
<p>whatever they said like 260 and 360</p>
<p>right and so that&rsquo;s when THC combusts but at</p>
<p>3 like 80 or 400</p>
<p>all the carcinogens combust</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re getting bad shit into your lungs</p>
<p>yeah that makes</p>
<p>sense that makes</p>
<p>sense so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely free that but you get all the juice</p>
<p>they say there will</p>
<p>still be some that comes out at that lower</p>
<p>level depending on how high you go</p>
<p>but yeah you just get the</p>
<p>stuff you want</p>
<p>out of it yeah that&rsquo;s the off at all I just blow it out</p>
<p>so fucking you know what there&rsquo;s a clarity to the high</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different kind of high</p>
<p>especially if you go I went</p>
<p>3 today usually I go to</p>
<p>today I went 3</p>
<p>3 what 3 heads</p>
<p>of that yeah</p>
<p>you get it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>clear high even though you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super high you&rsquo;re pretty fucking functional</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s nice it&rsquo;s a nice one</p>
<p>yeah I think it&rsquo;s just way better I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like getting too high and that seems like when we</p>
<p>pass just smoking</p>
<p>those joints it&rsquo;s like a little</p>
<p>fuck off too</p>
<p>much fuck all</p>
<p>these you know</p>
<p>20 years you were supposed</p>
<p>to join now you follow his fucking thing relax</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re another fucking momo with the clarity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking Tac</p>
<p>we smoke dope the fuck up the clarity of fucking</p>
<p>fucking fucking Johnny over</p>
<p>shut the fuck up oh yes</p>
<p>dirty fucking this</p>
<p>this is the iPhone the pipes to suck more fucking homo</p>
<p>white gets it to believe this shit</p>
<p>the fuck out of here they got his yelling Jack</p>

<p>okay we get</p>
<p>a Twitter can you make calls from up here fuck you</p>
<p>the fuck out of shit he finally not since yeah</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
<p>you better pull the fucking power department</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about the fucking vaporizer that vaporizing</p>
<p>your life fucking casualty</p>
<p>I got oh no no no no no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I report the lasted</p>
<p>fell out the front of the fucking</p>
<p>yesterday when I went to my ID</p>
<p>fell out like confetti out of my wallet</p>
<p>me and the fucking ATF department looked at it</p>
<p>what it look like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not have a little piece of acid in my wallet</p>
<p>what is just a square</p>
<p>as I take the airport at the airport a little</p>
<p>piece of paper falls out like confetti on</p>
<p>they know what that was they didn&rsquo;t fucking know</p>
<p>those fucking momos if they ever fucking took a last</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t be checking IDS</p>
<p>loosen the fuck up</p>
<p>tremendous tremendous</p>
<p>just fell down I said I don&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>shit it was big as</p>
<p>did it have any graphics on it or is it</p>
<p>a little pink for yeah so</p>
<p>perforations and a think so</p>
<p>will be identical as a drugs</p>
<p>they pick it up</p>
<p>like Mighty Mouse oh my God</p>
<p>right right somebody dropped a piece of paper you know</p>
<p>who gives it nobody&rsquo;s gonna put that on her tongue</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had enough</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get some strong stuff it&rsquo;s hard to get acid</p>
<p>these days I don&rsquo;t think so they&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a dispensary</p>
<p>you should get a Bible Joe you gotta take</p>
<p>a look of acid</p>
<p>although I bet if you went to a dispensary</p>
<p>you go to the same one all the time</p>
<p>yes they know you</p>
<p>yes I bet if you ask them hey we&rsquo;re gonna get some acid</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna ask them that</p>
<p>would be rude I got a guy but I want to ask them</p>
<p>where to get something illegal</p>
<p>I got a guy in Boulder</p>
<p>but I just didn&rsquo;t want to buy</p>
<p>30 fucking hits</p>
<p>of liquid fucking ass I&rsquo;ll make a call like a couple of</p>
<p>those you know</p>
<p>that liquid acid to have around that&rsquo;s explosive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s explosive</p>
<p>because I can hook</p>
<p>10 people up at one of</p>
<p>those UFC will just be</p>
<p>blinking up there</p>
<p>in the Puerto Rican sex and</p>
<p>throwing sidekicks with Jesus</p>
<p>son John Jones got that title fight when you told him</p>
<p>cause I already knew but when you told him</p>
<p>did you know</p>
<p>the day before</p>
<p>that he was gonna get the title if he won</p>
<p>right yeah so I was like I</p>
<p>could see a comment I&rsquo;m telling you but I</p>
<p>could see a client</p>
<p>let it go who told you he was gonna</p>
<p>I did yeah yeah</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tell anybody</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s done now but like</p>
<p>but like so I could see what you&rsquo;re about to tell him</p>
<p>yeah and then he was like</p>
<p>hey we just</p>
<p>heard or shot Evans pulled out you know so we need</p>
<p>could have been</p>
<p>if Ryan Bader won he would have could have been</p>
<p>spectacular but yeah he could have got the title</p>
<p>they needed someone to do it</p>
<p>and Rampage didn&rsquo;t want to do it because he was</p>
<p>scheduled to fight Tiago Silva and he was heavy</p>
<p>it was like 250</p>
<p>you know I didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>take 6 weeks and just lose 45</p>
<p>pounds in 6 weeks you know he did that for the Rashad</p>
<p>fight and it fucked him up yeah</p>
<p>you know Rampage almost should be a heavyweight man</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll throw this footage up on</p>
<p>your YouTube or something like that I&rsquo;ve been filming</p>
<p>using this camera</p>
<p>pretty great camera man</p>
<p>Sony sent this to me it&rsquo;s a Sony bloggy</p>
<p>touch and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty inexpensive it&rsquo;s like the flip cam</p>
<p>but the best part</p>
<p>about it besides the flip cam</p>
<p>is how great the low quality is can you</p>
<p>check that out</p>
<p>like most cameras</p>
<p>would be pretty shitty</p>
<p>right now does it look like that online on YouTube</p>
<p>yeah it looks</p>
<p>great on YouTube</p>
<p>it has the XMR</p>
<p>lens in it which has really good low light</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m recording with it</p>
<p>right now yeah you record it</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good for people that don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about internet</p>
<p>are computers and technology</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s set up so nice</p>
<p>where you could just put it on there</p>
<p>set it up and just go alright</p>
<p>Facebook YouTube</p>
<p>it just uploads it to all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>places right</p>
<p>when you plug it in oh really yeah and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>super easy to use</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>these new models coming out pretty soon</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been playing with it for like the last</p>
<p>3 weeks and it was pretty fucking awesome you</p>
<p>ready to report on it</p>
<p>yeah yeah I&rsquo;m writing a little</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really cool dude when you are</p>
<p>focusing on your face it</p>
<p>it makes a square on your face yeah it has face</p>
<p>detection it has face</p>
<p>detection and that adjusts the contrast and also</p>
<p>adjusts the</p>
<p>sharpness something</p>
<p>like that it&rsquo;s got really good</p>
<p>face detection too</p>
<p>now I wish it did have a light</p>
<p>because some zoom</p>
<p>check out the</p>
<p>digital zoom which</p>
<p>I never recommend fucking with the digital zoom just</p>
<p>watch when you</p>
<p>focus on someone&rsquo;s face oh yeah it</p>
<p>puts a square on you</p>
<p>yeah how trippy is that</p>
<p>yeah I wish it did have a</p>
<p>flash but the low</p>
<p>light is so good in it that most</p>
<p>situation so we&rsquo;ll wrap</p>
<p>your head around how</p>
<p>bizarre that is</p>
<p>that you can</p>
<p>point that thing at someone</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re making a</p>
<p>video there pal yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the worst cameraman ever</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the zoom I&rsquo;m trying to see the</p>
<p>zoom on the</p>
<p>screen the touchscreen</p>
<p>and you could</p>
<p>forward and back it</p>
<p>but yeah it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>good it&rsquo;s pretty inexpensive it comes at different</p>
<p>models they also have like</p>
<p>these really cool attachments</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s for this one or one coming soon</p>
<p>where you could do a</p>
<p>3D room where</p>
<p>it videotapes like a 360</p>
<p>thing and then</p>
<p>it plays it out in this</p>
<p>weird like panoramic 360</p>
<p>screen it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s trippy</p>
<p>I talk about the future</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s on sony&rsquo;s website but I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s just an attachment to</p>
<p>these little bloggy cameras</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fucking future man that&rsquo;s pretty dope</p>
<p>and eventually that</p>
<p>technology is</p>
<p>gonna make it to your</p>
<p>phone yeah your</p>
<p>phone&rsquo;s video well</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>close right now it&rsquo;s pretty easy</p>
<p>they actually have been compared to the iPhone</p>
<p>video I know they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s hard to tell</p>
<p>which way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>focusing but not in</p>
<p>comparison to the iPhone</p>
<p>video the iPhone does have a</p>
<p>flash which is very key</p>
<p>but the low</p>
<p>light was so good on this that the</p>
<p>picture was way better on most instances</p>
<p>comparing it</p>
<p>even though the iPhone is good</p>
<p>it has this</p>
<p>weird wobble to it</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not really the most</p>
<p>stable video if you really look at the quality</p>
<p>this is way more</p>
<p>professional</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the life of the iPhone wow</p>
<p>right now yeah</p>
<p>right now if I</p>
<p>would have the iPhone</p>
<p>right now and the</p>
<p>flash does over contrast</p>
<p>over its face and make everyone look like a zombie</p>
<p>yeah makes you look weird yeah</p>
<p>a little setting for that flash yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no battery</p>
<p>you can take out of it though science</p>
<p>but the battery is really good</p>
<p>it lasts about 2</p>
<p>hours of straight video</p>
<p>around there</p>
<p>hmm and that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>hey Brian how</p>
<p>about the farts that I was blowing</p>
<p>on the fucking balcony and</p>
<p>how good were</p>
<p>those oh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>acid mixed with fucking garlic</p>
<p>yeah good ski</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny is like 10 of</p>
<p>those garlic cloves</p>
<p>speaking of farts a fan in</p>
<p>Vegas came up to me</p>
<p>and was just like</p>
<p>hey Red Band</p>
<p>big fan blah blah and</p>
<p>I brought you a present</p>
<p>and he puts it in my hand it was a pack of</p>
<p>those old glass</p>
<p>fart things that you</p>
<p>throw on the ground</p>
<p>that you crush and</p>
<p>break and it</p>
<p>smells like</p>
<p>stink bombs</p>
<p>what the fuck are you kidding me these</p>
<p>what do you mean what the fuck</p>
<p>exactly the guy I think</p>
<p>would like them</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t think of</p>
<p>anyone more than</p>
<p>like that than</p>
<p>you you take that</p>
<p>to the comedy</p>
<p>store and throw it at Polly</p>
<p>Shore holy shit</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you keep it next to the fart</p>
<p>spray that you also have right now</p>
<p>oh god oh yeah</p>
<p>I would just</p>
<p>throw it at people</p>
<p>like Pauly Shore</p>
<p>especially like in a contained</p>
<p>place where people</p>
<p>start puking</p>
<p>and the place is so</p>
<p>long you should</p>
<p>let Pauly show it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hysterical people</p>
<p>start bar for this shit the best is an elevator</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crap yeah it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>10 people you</p>
<p>gotta smash</p>
<p>Exodus you know I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>you wanna if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna throw one of</p>
<p>those things at somebody you wanna</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>like over trade</p>
<p>senate type</p>
<p>shit you know I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>you gotta go for the maximum</p>
<p>bang I can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>the last time I was around some of the tropical</p>
<p>stink bomb yeah it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>a couple of times in high</p>
<p>school fucking horrible</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s pretty bad it is fucking horrible</p>
<p>I wonder if the scientist</p>
<p>who made that stink bomb</p>
<p>thing if he likes the</p>
<p>smell of it like he&rsquo;s the only one that likes the</p>
<p>smell that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>sometimes is that somebody</p>
<p>went to Michigan</p>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p>went through school and</p>
<p>studied so that he</p>
<p>could invent</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>stink bottle</p>
<p>or it could have been just an accident</p>
<p>or it could be just a</p>
<p>simple Saudi yeah so there&rsquo;s a sulfur</p>
<p>mixed with vinegar no</p>
<p>when I was a fucking kid this guy</p>
<p>had these apartment</p>
<p>buildings and wanted to get people out of there</p>
<p>so you could towards the fucking buildings</p>
<p>so we used to go like a Walmart by that sent a</p>
<p>skunk that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worse than a fucking dead</p>
<p>sent of skunk you can buy from Walmart like yeah for</p>
<p>like hunting dropped</p>
<p>oh you could oh</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t figure it out</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>skunks it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they say that the way we</p>
<p>smell skunk</p>
<p>is exactly the same way</p>
<p>dogs can smell us</p>
<p>it is horrible</p>
<p>no not that it&rsquo;s horrible that we</p>
<p>can see you</p>
<p>see you know a</p>
<p>skunk can get killed like 2</p>
<p>blocks away and you can</p>
<p>smell it like why is that the</p>
<p>mild the worst fart</p>
<p>ever doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>travel that far what the fuck is it</p>
<p>about skunks that really register in your nose</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s parts per million it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how strong the</p>
<p>scent is in parts per million</p>
<p>skunk is a very very high number</p>
<p>well for a dog</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like how they can</p>
<p>smell people</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>skunk for a dog</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it blow</p>
<p>his mind probably freaking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably so how do they feel and</p>
<p>see it I bet a dog sees it well they</p>
<p>just try to</p>
<p>try to describe</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s the analogy</p>
<p>so we can wrap our heads around</p>
<p>how a dog could</p>
<p>smell so much better than us</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really the only time that it makes</p>
<p>sense to us</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>skunk is a weird</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>stronger than any</p>
<p>other smell</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s one little animal</p>
<p>just a small amount of liquid you</p>
<p>smell on the freeway you</p>
<p>smell it for like a full</p>
<p>minute I love it now it</p>
<p>smells like weed yeah</p>
<p>you better call psng bitch</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s get dark in the fucking hill do a live</p>

<p>gonna happen there&rsquo;s still be some solid people</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s always gonna be some solid people there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s look South comedy holes very small</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in LA</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s a very unique place</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maybe 80 people</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about as much as it</p>
<p>gets and he&rsquo;s expanding the back area and it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll have like I don&rsquo;t know what exactly he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do I think I</p>
<p>have 2 rooms in the back</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense to me I</p>
<p>think it should be one big way hey</p>
<p>dream or once</p>
<p>more the slight</p>
<p>difference in the</p>
<p>movement 240 and 280</p>
<p>like do like 80</p>
<p>what is the improv</p>
<p>seat like 2</p>
<p>09:10 to twenty two twenty</p>
<p>so if the improv</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good size club that&rsquo;s like the perfect size club</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the same size as</p>
<p>this place if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have 2 of</p>
<p>those rooms if it&rsquo;s one room</p>
<p>but one of them is one</p>
<p>50 and the other one is</p>
<p>smaller right yeah 70</p>
<p>I think they were even closer than that</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you really make them different yeah well</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk to him</p>
<p>maybe hopefully</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll listen to us and make it one big room</p>
<p>but the front room is kind of cool</p>
<p>where it is</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s really intimate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a pole</p>
<p>they needed yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pole</p>
<p>yeah Doug Benzo</p>
<p>is fixated on it</p>
<p>he was barbecued</p>
<p>and he got off</p>
<p>stage he goes</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s Comedy Pole</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna call</p>

<p>about what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to go on stage</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s hit me with the</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s Comedy Pole</p>
<p>I was really</p>
<p>stoned the other</p>
<p>night that night and I was</p>
<p>thinking what if they put cameras</p>
<p>on one side of the pole that filmed what you would see</p>
<p>and then have it like</p>
<p>on the other side of</p>
<p>the LCD screen like on the pole</p>
<p>you know what I mean</p>
<p>so like but</p>
<p>it detects from what</p>
<p>angle though or something</p>
<p>how cool would that be</p>
<p>that would be cool million dollar</p>
<p>cameras that</p>
<p>sells totally</p>
<p>down feeding</p>
<p>the perfect</p>
<p>place called a whole 80</p>
<p>seat intimate little Hollywood club when</p>

<p>right and she</p>
<p>came here came to the interview with a wine inside a</p>
<p>water bottle</p>
<p>wow and she was like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like I just</p>
<p>drink from when I wake up tonight but I do</p>
<p>I maintain it I</p>
<p>never get too high</p>
<p>and I just fucking have like this complete buzz</p>

<p>water bottle with more wine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>white wine or</p>
<p>white wine and I</p>
<p>always thought like</p>

<p>completely fake</p>
<p>but like after she talked</p>
<p>about like her and her</p>
<p>sister don&rsquo;t talk anymore</p>
<p>cause I guess they got in a</p>

<p>some real shit to it like she won&rsquo;t even talk to her</p>
<p>we brought up the plastic surgery too</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>broke her nose 5 times</p>
