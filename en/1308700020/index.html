    <p>Our card this week is Awachagee Osceola,</p>
<p>the Eight of Diamonds from Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Even though Awachagee called for help</p>
<p>on the morning her killer broke in,</p>
<p>what actually happened inside her apartment</p>
<p>is still a mystery.</p>
<p>And while evidence supports police&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>about who killed her,</p>
<p>one huge hurdle still stands in the way of justice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On</p>
<p>September 25th, 2013,</p>
<p>Toni Brown was hanging out at home in Anadarko, Oklahoma,</p>
<p>when she saw a Facebook status from her friend Awachagee.</p>
<p>It had been posted earlier that morning and read, quote,</p>
<p>Moose is trying to KM.</p>
<p>Toni knew Awachagee was dating a guy named Moose,</p>
<p>but she wasn&rsquo;t sure what KM meant.</p>
<p>Just then, Toni&rsquo;s phone alerted her to a text from Awachagee</p>
<p>that said the exact same thing as her Facebook status.</p>
<p>Moose is trying to KM.</p>
<p>Awachagee wasn&rsquo;t answering any calls or texts,</p>
<p>and Toni was freaked out.</p>
<p>So she rounded up three of their friends to go check on her.</p>
<p>The group made the roughly hour-long drive from Anadarko</p>
<p>to Awachagee&rsquo;s apartment in Norman, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>And when they pulled up, their feelings of unease only grew.</p>
<p>They saw that the door was slightly open</p>
<p>from having been kicked in.</p>
<p>They could tell because there was a shoe print on the door,</p>
<p>and the frame was splintered.</p>
<p>So Toni and the group didn&rsquo;t even go in.</p>
<p>They called police instead.</p>
<p>As soon as Norman police officers got inside,</p>
<p>they saw cabinets and drawers left open</p>
<p>and stuff everywhere.</p>
<p>But when they called out to see if anyone was home,</p>
<p>no one answered.</p>
<p>It was in an upstairs bedroom that police found Awachagee.</p>
<p>She was laying on the floor face down</p>
<p>with her sheets and comforter tossed over her head.</p>
<p>They checked for signs of life,</p>
<p>but she had clearly been dead for a while,</p>
<p>though it wasn&rsquo;t entirely clear how she had died</p>
<p>because there were no visible wounds.</p>
<p>In her room, the bed looked as if someone</p>
<p>stripped it in a hurry.</p>
<p>The mattress was bare except for three pillows,</p>
<p>one of which had blood on it.</p>
<p>And there were clothes and stuff tossed all around the room.</p>
<p>In fact, the rest of the house was a mess as well.</p>
<p>It looked as if the living room, kitchen,</p>
<p>and bedroom had all been ransacked.</p>
<p>They found another bloody pillow</p>
<p>stuffed in a dresser in the bedroom.</p>
<p>But when they went searching for Awachagee&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and stuff like her cash and cards,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t find any of that in the apartment.</p>
<p>So they were obviously wondering</p>
<p>if someone had robbed the place.</p>
<p>Officers secured the scene and went outside</p>
<p>to tell Awachagee&rsquo;s friends what they&rsquo;d found.</p>
<p>But it was what they didn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>that concerned Toni and her friends the most</p>
<p>because police didn&rsquo;t mention anything</p>
<p>about finding anyone else in the home.</p>
<p>And Toni knew that Awachagee lived</p>
<p>with her five-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>Immediately, officers started looking for the young girl.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t sure if they were dealing</p>
<p>with an abduction or what,</p>
<p>but the first place they checked,</p>
<p>the first place any investigator checks</p>
<p>when a child is missing</p>
<p>is with their living parents or guardians.</p>
<p>And Toni and Awachagee&rsquo;s other friends</p>
<p>said that her dad lived back in Anadarko.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when officers tracked him down,</p>
<p>they found the young girl and determined that she was safe.</p>
<p>Still, they weren&rsquo;t sure what involvement</p>
<p>Awachagee&rsquo;s ex could have had in her murder</p>
<p>since they knew the two had recently divorced</p>
<p>and had gone through custody hearings.</p>
<p>So they brought him in for an interview.</p>
<p>The ex-husband cooperated and said</p>
<p>that he had been in Anadarko all week</p>
<p>and he had no idea who might&rsquo;ve killed Awachagee.</p>
<p>He said she actually had full custody of their daughter,</p>
<p>but it just so happened</p>
<p>that week their daughter had been with him.</p>
<p>Police had no reason not to believe the man&rsquo;s alibi,</p>
<p>so they moved on to see what else they could find out</p>
<p>about Awachagee&rsquo;s personal life.</p>
<p>When it was her turn to give a statement,</p>
<p>Toni filled police in about the weird text</p>
<p>and Facebook status about Moose.</p>
<p>Toni said it didn&rsquo;t sound like Awachagee,</p>
<p>who usually texted in full sentences</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t use abbreviations.</p>
<p>Toni also told police since moving to Norman,</p>
<p>Awachagee had been online dating</p>
<p>and not too long ago,</p>
<p>she had started seeing a man who went by Moose.</p>
<p>And that guy lived in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>Studying Awachagee&rsquo;s Facebook status,</p>
<p>Moose is trying to KM.</p>
<p>Police deciphered it as Moose is trying to kill me.</p>
<p>So it was imperative that they find Moose ASAP,</p>
<p>which they did.</p>
<p>He was in Oklahoma City</p>
<p>about a half an hour North of Norman.</p>
<p>Moose was shocked to hear about Awachagee&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>and he was willing to talk to police,</p>
<p>telling detectives the two hadn&rsquo;t known each other very long.</p>
<p>When he was shown the Facebook status</p>
<p>that mentioned him by name,</p>
<p>Moose immediately gave an alibi.</p>
<p>But just as investigators started working</p>
<p>to verify Moose&rsquo;s whereabouts over the last few days,</p>
<p>they became aware of a weird call</p>
<p>that had been made from Awachagee&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>the day she was murdered.</p>
<p>It was 2-9-1-1 and made by Awachagee herself.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on 9-1-1.</p>
<p>What is the location of your emergency?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to make out what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but obviously something was wrong.</p>
<p>And minutes later, Awachagee called back,</p>
<p>but this time her tone was different.</p>
<p>Norman 9-1-1, what is the location of your emergency?</p>
<p>Yes, I accidentally dialed the wrong number</p>
<p>and pressed emergency call by accident.</p>
<p>Everything is okay there?</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>The dispatcher never routed a police officer</p>
<p>to her apartment,</p>
<p>and officials didn&rsquo;t put two and two together</p>
<p>until the next day when they realized</p>
<p>that there was a murder investigation</p>
<p>underway at the same location.</p>
<p>Norman police detective Jim Parks,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s working the case today,</p>
<p>has analyzed those phone calls over and over.</p>
<p>That tells me either she or the male</p>
<p>that you heard in the first call</p>
<p>was afraid that the cops were gonna show up</p>
<p>because 9-1-1 was called.</p>
<p>So she was forced to make a second call</p>
<p>saying, hey, everything&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It was an accidental call, yada yada.</p>
<p>The fact that nobody had been called</p>
<p>to at least do a welfare check</p>
<p>at the apartment surprised police.</p>
<p>It was protocol to alert patrol officers</p>
<p>of an emergency call,</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder</p>
<p>if they had been dispatched,</p>
<p>if they would have interrupted the attack.</p>
<p>Of course, no one can say for sure</p>
<p>that Awachagite would still be alive</p>
<p>if police had been dispatched,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an element of the case</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always frustrated her family.</p>
<p>In fact, detective Parks said</p>
<p>that there ended up being an internal investigation</p>
<p>and the dispatcher was actually let go</p>
<p>because of the whole thing.</p>
<p>The 9-1-1 calls made police lean</p>
<p>further into their theory</p>
<p>that whoever tore up Awachagite&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>likely killed her.</p>
<p>The calls also provided a decent jumping off point</p>
<p>for the investigative timeline</p>
<p>because now they had confirmation</p>
<p>that Awachagite had been alive</p>
<p>and not alone at her apartment</p>
<p>around 6 a.m. the morning of September 24th.</p>
<p>That detail also helped police confirm Moose&rsquo;s alibi,</p>
<p>which checked out.</p>
<p>He was in Oklahoma City when Awachagite called 9-1-1.</p>
<p>Around this time, officers in Norman</p>
<p>made arrangements for another police department</p>
<p>to notify Awachagite&rsquo;s mom, Roberta, of her death</p>
<p>because she lived in Florida.</p>
<p>I was getting ready to leave my house</p>
<p>and I walked out the front door</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when I saw two Seminole police cars</p>
<p>coming into my driveway.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself,</p>
<p>oh no, which one is in jail?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t thinking murder.</p>
<p>And my life, my life stopped right there</p>
<p>when I was informed.</p>
<p>The Seminole Police Department assured Roberta</p>
<p>that detectives in Oklahoma were working hard</p>
<p>to find her daughter&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Roberta was on the next flight out.</p>
<p>My tribe offered to send me out there</p>
<p>to be with her body.</p>
<p>So I landed in Norman.</p>
<p>When I got to her apartment,</p>
<p>her front door was kicked in.</p>
<p>The place was a shambles.</p>
<p>So looking around and seeing what I saw,</p>
<p>after the police had gathered evidence and whatnot,</p>
<p>I felt terror, I felt mourning,</p>
<p>I felt anger.</p>
<p>After talking to Roberta,</p>
<p>police learned that Awachiki was born and raised</p>
<p>on the Seminole tribes, Big Cypress Reservation,</p>
<p>which is in the Florida Everglades,</p>
<p>about two hours Northwest of Miami.</p>
<p>Everybody knows Awachiki.</p>
<p>She had that kind of personality.</p>
<p>She was, Awachiki means star in Seminole language.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what she was.</p>
<p>She was a shining star.</p>
<p>She was a bright star to where everybody knew her,</p>
<p>recognized her.</p>
<p>Not only that,</p>
<p>but Osceola is a prominent name in the Seminole tribe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re descendants of Chief Osceola,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a famous tribal leader.</p>
<p>Police and relatives wondered if Awachiki&rsquo;s killer</p>
<p>knew that she received a monthly stipend from the tribe</p>
<p>because of her prominence.</p>
<p>And if she had been targeted because of that.</p>
<p>Whoever kicked in her door was there to get something.</p>
<p>I had to replace the ignition keys to her Cadillac.</p>
<p>So apparently maybe he tried to take her car,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Her purse, her bank account was emptied out.</p>
<p>So there was aggression.</p>
<p>Whoever did that had one thing in mind</p>
<p>was to get what he wanted and leave her like trash,</p>
<p>like she was nothing.</p>
<p>Pretty soon detectives made some progress</p>
<p>by backtracking Awachiki&rsquo;s bank records.</p>
<p>They discovered that she had used her ATM card</p>
<p>to withdraw $500 on September 23rd</p>
<p>at a gas station near her apartment.</p>
<p>And just to double check that it was her using her card</p>
<p>and not someone else,</p>
<p>detectives got surveillance video from the 7-Eleven,</p>
<p>which clearly showed Awachiki going in</p>
<p>and getting cash and leaving.</p>
<p>Detectives also noted what she was wearing in that video</p>
<p>because it was the same clothes that she was found in.</p>
<p>Bank records showed another almost $500</p>
<p>was taken out of her account on September 24th</p>
<p>from an ATM at a nearby casino.</p>
<p>As police worked the ATM leads,</p>
<p>they were still waiting to hear from the medical examiner.</p>
<p>The autopsy was taking longer than usual.</p>
<p>So at this point, they still didn&rsquo;t know how she died.</p>
<p>Though they did learn that Awachiki had either had sex</p>
<p>or been sexually assaulted recently</p>
<p>because there was semen present.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, examiners couldn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>if she had been sexually assaulted</p>
<p>or if the sex act was consensual.</p>
<p>They just knew that it had happened</p>
<p>within the last few days.</p>
<p>Through more interviews, investigators learned</p>
<p>that Awachiki was a cocaine user</p>
<p>and her friends said that the reason she moved</p>
<p>to a college town like Norman, at least in part,</p>
<p>was to be closer to a dealer that she knew</p>
<p>out of Oklahoma City whose name was Rob Ross,</p>
<p>better known by his customers as just Cocaine Rob.</p>
<p>Police looked up Rob and saw that he was a felon</p>
<p>with a long history of drug-related charges.</p>
<p>So with that intel, they made moves to track him down.</p>
<p>And they also worked to get his phone records</p>
<p>along with Awachiki&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And what they found was very interesting.</p>
<p>Cell records showed that Awachiki and Rob</p>
<p>had been texting and talking on the phone</p>
<p>up until the morning of September 24th.</p>
<p>And as they suspected, the last text sent</p>
<p>from Awachiki&rsquo;s phone was the one</p>
<p>to her friend received about Moose trying to kill her.</p>
<p>But they learned that that text wasn&rsquo;t sent</p>
<p>from her apartment.</p>
<p>It was sent from the Riverwind Casino,</p>
<p>which was a few miles away.</p>
<p>And it was the same location where her ATM card</p>
<p>had been used the day that she was killed.</p>
<p>Detectives headed straight to the casino</p>
<p>to review surveillance footage.</p>
<p>And sure enough, they spotted Rob at the casino</p>
<p>the morning of September 24th.</p>
<p>The videos showed Rob at a slot machine talking to a man,</p>
<p>walking through the casino with a woman.</p>
<p>And at 7.23 AM, he was at the ATM machine.</p>
<p>Rob used a debit card to withdraw just under $500,</p>
<p>which perfectly matched Awachiki&rsquo;s bank statements.</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Now, by the way, we made several efforts</p>
<p>to try and get in touch with Rob for this episode,</p>
<p>even leaving messages on a working cell number</p>
<p>that we obtained, but no luck.</p>
<p>So police were really closing in on Rob,</p>
<p>but they wanted to be sure</p>
<p>that they had all the information possible</p>
<p>before arresting him.</p>
<p>So they identified the two people</p>
<p>that he was seen with at the casino,</p>
<p>and they brought them in for questioning.</p>
<p>The man that Rob was seen chatting with</p>
<p>at the slot machines cooperated and told police</p>
<p>that he just happened to be at the casino that morning</p>
<p>and ran into Rob.</p>
<p>He said that the two had served time in jail together</p>
<p>in the past, and Rob had tried to actually recruit him</p>
<p>to sell drugs.</p>
<p>The man said he didn&rsquo;t know anything about a murder</p>
<p>and that Rob hadn&rsquo;t mentioned anything about it.</p>
<p>So next, police interviewed the woman Rob had been with</p>
<p>in the casino.</p>
<p>The two were actually spotted on surveillance together</p>
<p>in her car in the casino parking lot too.</p>
<p>And what she had to say basically sealed the deal</p>
<p>for police.</p>
<p>The woman admitted to police that Rob was her dealer,</p>
<p>and sometimes she would give him rides</p>
<p>in exchange for drugs.</p>
<p>She said that Rob had asked her for a ride</p>
<p>early on the morning of the 24th,</p>
<p>and she took him to an apartment complex in Norman.</p>
<p>She told detectives that per Rob&rsquo;s request,</p>
<p>she dropped him off across the street</p>
<p>from the apartment that he needed to visit.</p>
<p>The woman said that Rob asked her to wait for him,</p>
<p>so she did.</p>
<p>But at least an hour went by, and finally Rob called her</p>
<p>and said to pick him up at a nearby stop sign,</p>
<p>like a completely different location</p>
<p>than where she dropped him off.</p>
<p>You can actually see a map marking these areas</p>
<p>on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>The woman said that when Rob got to her car,</p>
<p>he was quote, sweaty and nervous.</p>
<p>She also said that he had some items with him,</p>
<p>but she couldn&rsquo;t tell what</p>
<p>because he stuffed them under the passenger seat.</p>
<p>Then he asked her to take him straight to the casino,</p>
<p>so she did.</p>
<p>Detectives reviewed surveillance footage</p>
<p>that showed Rob and the woman getting to the casino</p>
<p>around 7.15 the morning of September 24th.</p>
<p>Then two minutes later, at 7.17 a.m.,</p>
<p>the Facebook status was posted to a WatchGeese page,</p>
<p>MooseIsTrynaKM.</p>
<p>After they parked, Rob was seen on surveillance</p>
<p>throwing something into a trash can</p>
<p>in the casino parking lot.</p>
<p>After going in and visiting the ATM and playing those slots,</p>
<p>Rob and the woman can be seen on video</p>
<p>leaving the casino parking lot in her car at 8.08 a.m.</p>
<p>Now, the woman even agreed to take detectives</p>
<p>to retrace their route the morning of the 24th.</p>
<p>She pointed out the apartment complex</p>
<p>where she dropped off Rob,</p>
<p>which was a WatchGeese building.</p>
<p>But because she parked across the street,</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t see which apartment he went into.</p>
<p>Detectives figured it was a WatchGeese phone</p>
<p>that Rob tossed into the trash in the casino parking lot,</p>
<p>but unfortunately, by the time they went looking for it,</p>
<p>the trash had been emptied and the phone was long gone.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t mean that they couldn&rsquo;t connect him</p>
<p>to the phone.</p>
<p>Along with placing him at the casino</p>
<p>where the text and Facebook status were made from,</p>
<p>detectives found messages that Rob had sent</p>
<p>to other friends on his phone,</p>
<p>where instead of typing out trying to,</p>
<p>he wrote Tryna, T-R-Y-N-A.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same spelling as a WatchGeese Facebook post</p>
<p>and group text.</p>
<p>By this time, there was little doubt</p>
<p>in the minds of detectives that Rob was their guy.</p>
<p>They needed to find him and quickly, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy.</p>
<p>Rob didn&rsquo;t have a house or apartment</p>
<p>or any address of his own.</p>
<p>He was known to stay with friends and family</p>
<p>in Oklahoma City,</p>
<p>but he bopped around to different couches all the time.</p>
<p>They finally were able to track him down several days later,</p>
<p>and on October 5th, investigators sat him down</p>
<p>for an interview.</p>
<p>And to their surprise, he was willing to talk, sort of.</p>
<p>Do you understand how all of this looks to us?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I mean, you get that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And how does it look to us?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not gonna say a shit,</p>
<p>but somehow we got along.</p>
<p>Our reporting team got copies of Rob&rsquo;s interrogation,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s super hard to understand.</p>
<p>But he said something to the effect of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not who you all want.</p>
<p>But the detective wasn&rsquo;t having it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not the person that killed her,</p>
<p>which I think you are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just be straight up with you.</p>
<p>And I told you there&rsquo;s different levels of homicide.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only, okay, with all this evidence and people</p>
<p>and the 911 call,</p>
<p>and you making her call 911 back,</p>
<p>this, to me, looks premeditated.</p>
<p>To that, Rob just kind of groaned in response.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t actually say anything.</p>
<p>Then the detective asked to see Rob&rsquo;s shoes</p>
<p>because he wanted to compare the tread to the shoe print</p>
<p>that was on Awachigie&rsquo;s front door.</p>
<p>Rob was like, okay, fine, but that won&rsquo;t prove anything</p>
<p>because I have like 10 pairs of shoes.</p>
<p>But detectives could see on surveillance</p>
<p>that the shoes that he was wearing</p>
<p>on the morning of the murder were the same,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t have to reveal that to him.</p>
<p>Next, the detective asked Rob</p>
<p>about Awachigie&rsquo;s Facebook status.</p>
<p>And Rob said that he hadn&rsquo;t seen it,</p>
<p>but the detective just lays it all out there.</p>
<p>I know that you typed that on her phone.</p>
<p>I know you hit the Facebook icon on her phone</p>
<p>and you were able to type that</p>
<p>to make it look like Moose was involved.</p>
<p>The investigator was like, listen, everyone is talking.</p>
<p>We have so many witnesses</p>
<p>and all the fingers are pointing in your direction.</p>
<p>So this is your moment to give your side of the story.</p>
<p>And finally Rob said, okay, fine.</p>
<p>I was at Awachigie&rsquo;s apartment that morning,</p>
<p>but we just got drunk on Patron and had sex.</p>
<p>Rob said he did not kick down the door.</p>
<p>He said that Awachigie let him in</p>
<p>and that he knew nothing about her calling 911.</p>
<p>Rob said after they had sex,</p>
<p>Awachigie let him borrow her debit card</p>
<p>and even gave him her pin number</p>
<p>because she owed him money for cocaine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he went to the casino.</p>
<p>Was it premeditated or not?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not premeditated,</p>
<p>I can tell the DA that it&rsquo;s not premeditated.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t plan on going over there to kill her.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big difference in this case.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And she deserves justice.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t want to look at her photo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re trying to forget about her,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you know, she-</p>
<p>She was a good person and I know I didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>If you couldn&rsquo;t understand him,</p>
<p>Rob said, she was a good person and I know I didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Rob told police that after he left the casino,</p>
<p>he went back to Oklahoma City and met his cousin</p>
<p>and they went to their aunt&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>Detectives confirmed this funeral story,</p>
<p>but what Rob said after didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>He said it was after his aunt&rsquo;s funeral on the 24th</p>
<p>that he learned a body had been found in Norman.</p>
<p>At first, he said the information came from the internet</p>
<p>and later he said a friend called and told him,</p>
<p>but police knew that both stories were BS</p>
<p>because her body wasn&rsquo;t discovered</p>
<p>until the night of the 25th.</p>
<p>When asked what happened to a watch he&rsquo;s debit card,</p>
<p>Rob said that he had tossed it out the window</p>
<p>on the way home from his aunt&rsquo;s funeral</p>
<p>because he was worried the cops were after him</p>
<p>over a drug deal.</p>
<p>So you might be wondering if police arrested Rob</p>
<p>right then and there, but they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They released him after he asked for a lawyer,</p>
<p>but before he was released,</p>
<p>Rob allowed police to inspect his shoe tread</p>
<p>and he provided a DNA swap.</p>
<p>Detectives sent off Rob&rsquo;s DNA</p>
<p>to see if it matched the semen found in a watch key.</p>
<p>And they even sent off the shoe markings to an expert</p>
<p>to see if they matched the print on the doorframe.</p>
<p>And at about this time,</p>
<p>finally the autopsy findings came back</p>
<p>and the results baffled detectives.</p>
<p>The autopsy showed a watch key had injuries</p>
<p>to the back of her neck,</p>
<p>which police said were consistent with strangulation,</p>
<p>but the medical examiner listed her death as unknown.</p>
<p>The cause of death being undetermined</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the surprising part.</p>
<p>It was that the examiner also categorized</p>
<p>her manner of death as unknown.</p>
<p>Manner of death is the category</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re supposed to say if the victim was murdered</p>
<p>or if the death was accidental or what.</p>
<p>So here they were ready to charge cocaine Rob with murder</p>
<p>and now they couldn&rsquo;t because they had no homicide ruling.</p>
<p>It basically meant the ME didn&rsquo;t see enough</p>
<p>physical evidence to prove one way or another</p>
<p>how a watch key died.</p>
<p>It was more than clear, at least to investigators</p>
<p>that the last moment of a watch keys life</p>
<p>was met with violence.</p>
<p>Cuts and bruises were noted on different places of her body</p>
<p>as well as traces of blood on her pillow.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t enough blood left at the scene</p>
<p>to be helpful though.</p>
<p>Investigators did collect it</p>
<p>and they tried to have it tested</p>
<p>to see if it was a watch keys or not.</p>
<p>There just wasn&rsquo;t a big enough sample to get any results.</p>
<p>But thanks to toxicology findings,</p>
<p>now they knew that there was no way a watch key overdosed</p>
<p>because there was no alcohol in her system</p>
<p>and there was very little cocaine detected,</p>
<p>like trace amounts that were barely even measurable.</p>
<p>A watch keys mom, Roberta was devastated over the ruling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what else to say about that</p>
<p>except I&rsquo;m not going to accept undetermined.</p>
<p>Something has to happen</p>
<p>or somebody has to say something to change that.</p>
<p>To make the case even stronger,</p>
<p>DNA came back confirming Rob had had sex with a watch key</p>
<p>but he had admitted that much.</p>
<p>So police asked Rob, if the sex had been consensual,</p>
<p>why did a watch key end up bleeding</p>
<p>and dead on her bedroom floor</p>
<p>shortly after he left her apartment?</p>
<p>Now he said he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and that she was alive when he left to go to the casino</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t good enough</p>
<p>for the Norman police department.</p>
<p>So they asked the local district attorney</p>
<p>to charge Rob with a watch keys murder anyway.</p>
<p>But prosecutors wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because of the undetermined ruling.</p>
<p>So there was nothing else detectives could do.</p>
<p>They truly felt as if Rob had gotten away with murder</p>
<p>and years went by and nothing happened.</p>
<p>That is until 2017, when detective Parks reopened the case.</p>
<p>He re-examined all the evidence</p>
<p>and in 2019, he decided it was worth getting a second opinion</p>
<p>on a watch keys manner of death.</p>
<p>One of his FBI contacts helped him recruit the assistance</p>
<p>of the armed forces medical examiner&rsquo;s office in Maryland.</p>
<p>They agreed to take a second look at the case</p>
<p>and its original findings.</p>
<p>And in April, 2019, six years after a watch keys death,</p>
<p>the federal ME was like,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s no doubt she was murdered.</p>
<p>The manner of death was homicide.</p>
<p>The cause of death was a homicide by unknown means.</p>
<p>And they provided a several page report</p>
<p>on why homicide by unknown means</p>
<p>can be a justifiable ruling of homicide.</p>
<p>With the other ME&rsquo;s determination in hand,</p>
<p>this was Parks&rsquo; shot, his Hail Mary.</p>
<p>And so I presented that to the district attorney&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and they were pretty excited at first</p>
<p>and then later decided, no, we have to work</p>
<p>with the state medical examiner&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>in all of our cases.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna stick by their ruling</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not gonna file.</p>
<p>We reached out to the Oklahoma&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>of the chief medical examiner to try</p>
<p>and better understand their findings in this case,</p>
<p>but they declined to be interviewed.</p>
<p>In a letter to detective Parks in response to his asking them</p>
<p>to at least recategorize a watch keys death as a homicide,</p>
<p>the chief ME said, quote,</p>
<p>whereas the circumstances of death are indeed suspicious,</p>
<p>I find it inappropriate to insert any reference</p>
<p>to manner of death into the cause of death statement.</p>
<p>The cause of death in this case is undetermined.</p>
<p>The manner is best classified as undetermined, end quote.</p>
<p>In the early days of the investigation,</p>
<p>police interviewed everyone in a watch keys orbit,</p>
<p>her friends, an ex-husband, her boyfriend, her family,</p>
<p>all of whom had alibis that checked out.</p>
<p>Only one person could be placed at a watch keys apartment</p>
<p>on the morning of September 24th.</p>
<p>Do you have an opinion as to</p>
<p>who may have taken your daughter&rsquo;s life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say that according to my detective,</p>
<p>he indicates that all evidence leads to one person.</p>
<p>I want justice for my baby.</p>
<p>In November of 2020,</p>
<p>the Seminole tribe wrote letters</p>
<p>to the Oklahoma attorney general&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and called for a formal independent review</p>
<p>of the methodology used during a watch keys autopsy.</p>
<p>But as far as detective Parks knows, nothing came of it.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>he wants to see charges brought against Rob,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s for second degree murder.</p>
<p>You know, I can point the finger.</p>
<p>Did Norman Police Department fall down</p>
<p>on this case a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, we should have sent a patrol officer</p>
<p>on that first 911 call.</p>
<p>There should have been somebody there within a few minutes.</p>
<p>But we did what we could to rectify that problem.</p>
<p>Should the medical examiner&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>have better supervision over their pathologist?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>They have done nothing to reconcile their mistake.</p>
<p>Should the district attorney file a case</p>
<p>against Robert Ross for the death of a watch key?</p>
<p>Absolutely, because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Leave it up to a jury to decide</p>
<p>whether he&rsquo;s guilty or not guilty,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>It needs to be done.</p>
<p>To this day, no arrests have been made</p>
<p>in connection to a watch keys death.</p>
<p>Her missing phone and debit card have never been found.</p>
<p>Roberta told us she hopes to one day</p>
<p>see the whites of the eyes belonging to the person</p>
<p>who stole her daughter&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>I would say that there are measures</p>
<p>that have been put in place with the Lord,</p>
<p>and he will seek justice for me and a watch key.</p>
<p>And whoever did this to her,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna answer to the Lord.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna have to answer to God.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re walking away from this case as unsettled as I am,</p>
<p>the family and the tribe encourage you to do what they did.</p>
<p>Send more letters to the Oklahoma Attorney General&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and call for a formal independent review</p>
<p>of the methodology used during a watch keys autopsy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put the contact information</p>
<p>for the Oklahoma Attorney General&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>in the show notes and on the website.</p>
<p>We need to show them that people are paying attention</p>
<p>and that a watch key deserves justice.</p>
<p>And if you have any additional information</p>
<p>about the murder of a watch key Osceola,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re asked to call the Norman Police Department</p>
<p>in Oklahoma at 405-366-5208.</p>
