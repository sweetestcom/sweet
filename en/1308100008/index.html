    <p>How many of the full do you drink per day, that full Stanley cup?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 40 ounces.</p>
<p>I would say probably minimum of six.</p>
<p>Six?</p>
<p>Six times 40, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Let me try it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>See, it&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>Oh my God, you just got it all over your white shirt.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Oh, 200 ounces of that per day?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t bear to put my mouth on that.</p>
<p>No, I thought it was a good look for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve shared multiple germs, but that lipstick contaminated straw pumps.</p>
<p>Jennifer.</p>
<p>What have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with gated communities.</p>
<p>That is a fucking great one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable how stupid it is.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that we have not discussed this in 20 years of friendship.</p>
<p>Gated communities are the absolute worst.</p>
<p>The worst.</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s my deal.</p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;m going into my neighborhood waiting for the gate to open, I think, why</p>
<p>are we doing this?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re paying for our own roads through our homeowner&rsquo;s dues.</p>
<p>And anybody that&rsquo;s going to rob you is just going to wait until the person in front of</p>
<p>you goes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like a Cracker Jack fail safe system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All you have to do is go in after somebody.</p>
<p>If there was a committee meeting and you could vote to do away with the gate?</p>
<p>You would assume I would go to the homeowners association, which would never happen.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Could you imagine if anything worse?</p>
<p>Something would be wrong with me.</p>
<p>Like take me to the emergency room if you walk in and I&rsquo;m going to a homeowners association</p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p>For my job, I have to go to a lot of gated communities where I&rsquo;m designing a home.</p>
<p>Most of the time, these security guards want to play hero.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, they&rsquo;re 150.</p>
<p>My thought thing would be it&rsquo;s a power trip for the security guard.</p>
<p>100% it&rsquo;s the mall cop syndrome.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What have you had it with?</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting close to like making a purchase and they&rsquo;re like, prove to us that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not a robot.</p>
<p>Hate.</p>
<p>Identify the images that have a street sign in it.</p>
<p>I flunk those tests.</p>
<p>I flunk them all the time.</p>
<p>Nonstop.</p>
<p>Identify the crosswalks.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Identify a picture with lights in it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Traffic lights.</p>
<p>Traffic lights.</p>
<p>So then you&rsquo;re like, is the pole a part of the traffic light?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We need to figure out who invented that thing.</p>
<p>And I want that motherfucker on I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast.</p>
<p>We need to know who invented that.</p>
<p>And who are they trying to keep out?</p>
<p>Like robots?</p>
<p>Like if a robot has a credit card that works, why do they give a shit?</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, like who are they protecting themselves from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like this crazy layer of security.</p>
<p>Everybody flunks the test.</p>
<p>Do you guys flunk the test, Jen and Nellie?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve ever flunked the test.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve flunked it multiple times.</p>
<p>My biggest thing is with you is the pole.</p>
<p>Is the pole part of the light?</p>
<p>Part of, right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The traffic light.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like if you can see the back of the stop sign, does that count?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s just ‚Äì there&rsquo;s no oversight.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what.</p>
<p>I just think what are they saving us from?</p>
<p>Same with the gated community.</p>
<p>Like what are you protecting me from in my gated community?</p>
<p>Fucking nothing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What are you protecting me from on a website?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Robots.</p>
<p>Robots.</p>

<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>We call her Pumps.</p>
<p>Jen and Nellie are here.</p>
<p>Richard&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited about this episode.</p>
<p>I have a feeling you&rsquo;re going to be mad at me after the episode.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t take much.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I am so excited because we are going to discuss Pickleball.</p>
<p>I personally have not had it with Pickleball.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re obsessed.</p>
<p>We have some guests that are coming on later that have had it with Pickleball.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve written a manifesto.</p>
<p>But before we bring them on, I want to tell you and the audience.</p>
<p>So last year, I started playing tennis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never played racquet sports, had zero hand-eye coordination, played tennis, took</p>
<p>lessons religiously, and then some friends and I started playing Pickleball.</p>
<p>I was like, well, this is even easier.</p>
<p>More people can play it.</p>
<p>So I play both tennis and Pickleball.</p>
<p>Pickleball, I play every single day, sometimes twice a day.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re serious about it.</p>
<p>Oh, I know.</p>
<p>I am aware of your seriousness with Pickleball.</p>
<p>I mean, I take lessons.</p>
<p>I have a coach.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, all these articles in the news start popping up, Pickleball is taking</p>
<p>over America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sensation.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Well, then I see this rather alarming story in the New York Post.</p>
<p>The New York Post covers the story that there&rsquo;s this playground in the West Village, which</p>
<p>is a neighborhood in Manhattan, and the kids would play on this playground.</p>
<p>Well, apparently, the Pickleballers have come and they&rsquo;re taping off the lines and putting</p>
<p>up nets on the playground.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t get behind that.</p>
<p>These kids are all playing on the playground in West Village.</p>
<p>This is what the article says, the sun was shining, kids were laughing, riding scooters</p>
<p>and kicking soccer balls about.</p>
<p>Pickleball players lined up beside two designated courts on the concrete area of the popular</p>
<p>park.</p>
<p>Then suddenly a commotion interrupted the picture perfect early autumn.</p>
<p>The father of one of the children playing started screaming at the Pickleball players</p>
<p>and threatening to call the police, leave, he yelled repeatedly.</p>
<p>So these parents are furious that these Pickleball players are out there on the playground taking</p>
<p>over some of the playground.</p>
<p>The kids are kind of huddled over on part of the playground because, you know, space</p>
<p>is not a big thing in Manhattan, obviously.</p>
<p>So then apparently the parents are encouraging the kids, just go ahead and kick your soccer</p>
<p>ball.</p>
<p>So the kids are kicking their soccer balls right through the Pickleball courts.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just pandemonium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s chaos in the West Village at the Pickleball courts.</p>
<p>And so I personally am, I&rsquo;m for the Pickleball players.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>What have those kids ever done with their lives?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kids.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Kids are playground people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who they build playgrounds for.</p>
<p>Adults can rent space, they can, no, the kids win on that every time.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m for the Pickleball players.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pro the Pickleball players.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you and I were taking our Rugrats to play outside and we knew that that two</p>
<p>hours of playing outside was going to be the difference in an early bedtime, no tears at</p>
<p>bath time, all those things, like run, get the energy out of them.</p>
<p>And we march up there and there&rsquo;s adults playing on the playground, even though it&rsquo;s Pickleball</p>
<p>and you love it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be furious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly what I&rsquo;d do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d call a babysitter and say, come get my kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at this park, bring me my Pickleball bag.</p>
<p>And I would send the kids to Chuck E. Cheese like a fucking normal person.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just wrong.</p>
<p>And I would hop on the Pickleball court.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s some pavement there.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>What you think is because you&rsquo;re in a cult, you&rsquo;re in a Pickleball cult.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>Lay it out.</p>
<p>There is no story that ends with adults playing on a playground and kids playing on a playground</p>
<p>that the adults should win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a playground.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re empowering kids too much.</p>
<p>To play in a playground?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve crossed over to the cult dark side.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re on the dark side of this Pickleball.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s changed your personality a little bit.</p>
<p>These kids are fine.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>So all the parks in Manhattan are all for kids.</p>
<p>First and foremost, yes.</p>
<p>When did this happen?</p>
<p>The kids get the parks.</p>
<p>They have not done anything with their lives.</p>
<p>These people did this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kids.</p>
<p>How could they do anything with their lives?</p>
<p>They were just born.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done the bare minimum.</p>
<p>Adults are out working, paying for all this shit for the kids.</p>
<p>The kids need to share these open spaces.</p>
<p>In New York City, those basketball courts, especially in West Village, they&rsquo;re adults.</p>
<p>There are no kids there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not a great playground.</p>
<p>Jenna and I were talking about that.</p>
<p>But in a situation where kids are trying to play soccer and adults are trying to play</p>
<p>Pickleball, which is what this article is, there is no scenario in which the kids should</p>
<p>have to stand down for the adults.</p>
<p>I got to say I&rsquo;m with you on this one, Pumps, because New York City, these kids are so confined.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have playgrounds at schools.</p>
<p>They have parking lots to play in with some jungle gyms over there.</p>
<p>Adults could do lots of things.</p>
<p>They could go to the movies.</p>
<p>They could go to the bars.</p>
<p>They could go run on West Side Highway on the path.</p>
<p>So I got to say I think it belongs to the kids.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I just think your perspective is from the Pickleball, like you&rsquo;re a Pickleball purist</p>
<p>cultist.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the best thing in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best thing in the world for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>For you.</p>
<p>To the kids is when you get big enough, then you can have your own and you pay bills and</p>
<p>you pay for your kids&rsquo; stuff, then you can have your own place too.</p>
<p>Now we don&rsquo;t have these problems in Oklahoma City because we don&rsquo;t have a space issue.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We have tons of space.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not cross-contamination.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The Pickleball courts are not contaminated with children.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Children can&rsquo;t play Pickleball?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, some do.</p>
<p>And sometimes when I&rsquo;m at the place where I play Pickleball, some kids will be in the</p>
<p>court next to me.</p>
<p>And they hit balls into our court nonstop.</p>
<p>And the rule is when a ball goes in your court, you immediately stop play and you have to</p>
<p>say ball because somebody could step on it and roll an ankle.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And also these kids like to do a lot of tomfoolery.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of a grudge match championship, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>And Team Jennifer plays in the championship of Pickleball.</p>
<p>Multiple.</p>
<p>Multiple championships.</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>Multiple.</p>
<p>I won two championships today.</p>
<p>This morning.</p>
<p>Before 9.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Before lunch.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>We are in the presence of greatness right here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re obnoxious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re loud.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tomfoolery and it just happens over and over.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m 100% on Team Jennifer for that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re next to a Pickleball person and you&rsquo;re dicking off and you put their ball,</p>
<p>then you should be expelled.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re just stupid.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Go somewhere else.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>However, in a place where there&rsquo;s one opportunity to play, I think the kids have to win.</p>
<p>I know that doesn&rsquo;t make you feel happy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize you were so pro-kids.</p>
<p>I feel-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even like kids.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying, you just can&rsquo;t convince me ever that an adult should have priority</p>
<p>in a play area.</p>
<p>A dad who was also in the park on Friday put it more bluntly, meaning the Pickleball players.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the lantern flies of the sports world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>So then I guess the parents called the police or the park&rsquo;s department and so they come</p>
<p>and they tell the Pickleball players, get your shit and get your net and get out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, no, we&rsquo;re not going to go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going.</p>
<p>Oh no, we won&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>And so she&rsquo;s like, look, if you don&rsquo;t leave, I&rsquo;m going to send somebody back here and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to cuff you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gotten really bad.</p>
<p>Pickleball players, so they&rsquo;ve taken over playgrounds, which I support.</p>
<p>Which for the record, I&rsquo;m against.</p>
<p>I support.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where I disagree with the Pickleball players.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking over tennis courts and this I oppose.</p>
<p>The kids, fuck the kids.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Taking over the tennis courts, I oppose this.</p>
<p>Our guests that are coming on, they&rsquo;re in New York and they&rsquo;re madder than a hornet</p>
<p>about the Pickleballers taking over the tennis courts.</p>
<p>I mean, they are mad.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve written a manifesto.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>They have a club.</p>
<p>They think that Pickleball is like the demise of society.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s predicting the failure of the world.</p>
<p>I think they have had it with Pickleball.</p>
<p>I mean, had it on the same level of the same shit that we rail about, times a billion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how mad these guys are.</p>
<p>Even we haven&rsquo;t written a manifesto about anything.</p>
<p>No, but we&rsquo;re not above it.</p>
<p>Oh, heavens no, we&rsquo;re not above it.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t have the discipline.</p>
<p>And I read their manifesto.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s excellent.</p>
<p>Lots of big words.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re as sharp as a tack.</p>
<p>Sharp as tacks.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They seem very, very, very smart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we could write a manifesto.</p>
<p>I love it so much when somebody&rsquo;s so fucking mad about something, and they&rsquo;ve just got</p>
<p>a bee in their bonnet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re madder than hornets.</p>
<p>I mean, fucking scorched the earth about Pickleball.</p>
<p>Even though I am a lover of Pickleball, cult member.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Pickleball over children.</p>
<p>Chief Kool-Aid maker.</p>
<p>Fuck the kids, bring the Pickleballers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>When Jen and Nealey secured these guests- Oh, you were so excited.</p>
<p>I mean, you could get an A-list celebrity in here, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be as excited as to</p>
<p>interviewing these people.</p>
<p>This is Mike and Charlie from Brooklyn, New York, and their organization is called Club</p>
<p>Leftist Tennis.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hi, how&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>How are you guys?</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>I have to tell you guys, when you committed to be our guests, I am like, inject this anger</p>
<p>you have for Pickleball.</p>
<p>I mean, she was so excited.</p>
<p>Inject that shit into my veins.</p>
<p>The manifesto is fantastic.</p>
<p>I love the manifesto.</p>
<p>It is great.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>But I want, okay, I want our audience to know, tell us what a leftist tennis player is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both tennis players, lifelong tennis players.</p>
<p>We are both on the left politically, and we figured that it&rsquo;s been too long of a time</p>
<p>that tennis has been slandered as a country club sport, and we&rsquo;re reclaiming it as the</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s sport.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So I have to let you know, I am a huge tennis fan, but I also play Pickleball.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in a Pickleball cult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a part of the problem.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a cult.</p>
<p>Playing both sides.</p>
<p>I am a part of the problem, and I will admit it.</p>
<p>But I want to know, first of all, what is your tennis ranking?</p>
<p>Oh, not too high, but our leftist ranking is way up there.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re egalitarian, so we don&rsquo;t actually believe in tennis rankings.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s your favorite tennis player?</p>
<p>My favorite growing up was always Monfils, because I loved that he would just implode</p>
<p>and then bring back like the most incredible athleticism.</p>
<p>So I would go with him.</p>
<p>You know, I grew up as an Agassi fan.</p>
<p>I caught like the tail end of Agassi.</p>
<p>One of the most vivid matches to me was when Federer beat him in the finals.</p>
<p>So let me ask you this, which tennis player do you hate the most?</p>
<p>And why do you think Novak Djokovic is such a dick?</p>
<p>We have ongoing beef with two tennis players right now.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Who are they?</p>
<p>The first is Raelio Pelka.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Are you aware of him?</p>
<p>Seven foot tall, American, know exactly who he is.</p>
<p>Allegedly was dating Venus for a while.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>There were like lots of rumors swirling.</p>
<p>And if you go on their social media, they would be like at each other&rsquo;s events for a</p>
<p>long time.</p>
<p>And then it seems like that&rsquo;s dissipated.</p>
<p>But that was the gossip that we were told.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then who else do you hate?</p>
<p>Well, Raelio Pelka, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever seen him on Twitter.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big anti-vax type guy.</p>
<p>And then our number two that we have started to hate is Stefano Tsitsipas, who came out</p>
<p>today against feminism ruining the world.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He should really stay in his lane, which is like he makes good like himbo travel vlogs</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s like, wow, I love having yogurt in Turkey.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, stay in that lane.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t got to talk about feminism or anything else.</p>
<p>Mind your business.</p>
<p>But I mean, Novak Djokovic has to get up in your crawl with all the anti-vax stuff</p>
<p>and him saying get prey over a glass of water and remove bacteria from it.</p>
<p>I feel like sometimes he&rsquo;s so crazy that we can&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p>
<p>Like the thing where he just like touched bread and then decided off of like touching</p>
<p>a piece of bread that he needed to become gluten free blew my mind to the point where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t even know that I can hate this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, you are on a different level.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to get on to what you&rsquo;ve had it with because that&rsquo;s the name of this podcast</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>So I want to hear what you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s pickleball.</p>
<p>As like a devoted tennis player, what made you pick up pickleball in the first place?</p>
<p>So I had long COVID and it drug on for like seven months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thin.</p>
<p>I work out all the time.</p>
<p>I just had this debilitating, like long COVID.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s her dating profile.</p>
<p>We just did an episode on horoscopes because I&rsquo;ve had it with those.</p>
<p>And it said that as a Leo, I was arrogant and I just proved that.</p>
<p>I just totally proved that.</p>
<p>But anyway, so, but I had this debilitating brain fog and my doctor suggested try playing</p>
<p>chess or tennis or something.</p>
<p>So I started playing.</p>
<p>That shit is hard.</p>
<p>Tennis is so hard.</p>
<p>So at the time I was 47 and I&rsquo;m trying to learn, you have to do 75 things to hit a forehand.</p>
<p>And I was consumed with it, watched all the time and I&rsquo;m a nut.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m taking like seven tennis lessons a day, right?</p>
<p>So then some girlfriends and I were like, let&rsquo;s go play pickleball.</p>
<p>So we go play pickleball.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a million times easier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great place by my house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all designated pickleball courts, no cross contamination with tennis and it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>chicken and pickle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only pickleball.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard about them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you want to take them down.</p>
<p>But I Googled the owner and the owner is a big Democrat.</p>
<p>So that made me feel good about all the money that I spend there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I read an article before y&rsquo;all came on to Pumps that was in the New York Post about</p>
<p>apparently in the West Village, there&rsquo;s this park where these kids are out there trying</p>
<p>to play and the pickleball players have put down their courts.</p>
<p>And you know, I, I, every, I&rsquo;m the skunk at the garden party.</p>
<p>I said, fuck the kids.</p>
<p>I think that they haven&rsquo;t done anything with their lives.</p>
<p>I think the pickleball players, they&rsquo;re adults.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re paying for this shit.</p>
<p>They deserve to go play pickleball.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a popular opinion.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I was accused of being in a cult.</p>
<p>A lot, a lot of terrible things went down before y&rsquo;all came on board, but I still maintain.</p>
<p>Fuck those kids.</p>
<p>Well, the city, the city actually, I think today or yesterday just put up big signs banning</p>
<p>pickleball on those premises.</p>
<p>So unfortunately the city sided with the kids.</p>
<p>The kids won.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no argument you can make where a play area is for adults and not kids.</p>
<p>I mean, you just can&rsquo;t sell that shit.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>There was a, there was a crazy article.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d go this far, but there was a crazy article and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the one you saw where a lady was threatening to call child protective services on parents</p>
<p>whose kids were playing on that playground for not respecting the pickleball space.</p>
<p>So she might be more hardcore than you.</p>
<p>I want to dive into the rage.</p>
<p>Well, to be completely honest.</p>
<p>We first found out about pickleball like through the media and at first our hatred of it was</p>
<p>like more of a joke.</p>
<p>It was like this thing that I&rsquo;ve been talking about and it&rsquo;s really annoying and I&rsquo;m tired</p>
<p>of hearing about it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the more and more we heard about it, the more insidious it became to us.</p>
<p>All of a sudden it&rsquo;s like, wait, why is every single media publication publishing like five</p>
<p>articles about pickleball that are just like how to play the game of pickleball?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even like covering the game, nothing interesting going on in the sport.</p>
<p>Have you guys ever played pickleball?</p>
<p>I mean, I know that that would be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve stayed strong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve told the line.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a couple of friends.</p>
<p>Not fucking around.</p>
<p>We have a couple of friends who have invited us and, you know, I just feel like we would</p>
<p>be letting down the movement, you know, as leaders of this nationwide campaign, we really</p>
<p>got to hold the line.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written a goddamn manifesto and you cannot turn that, you can&rsquo;t get back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to name names on this podcast, but they know who they are and they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>notice.</p>
<p>Pickleball is loud.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot, a lot of smack talk going on, which I love to do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>She smacks talk during pickleball.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not lying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting the sense.</p>
<p>She smacked talks during a lot of parts of life.</p>
<p>Ding, ding, ding.</p>
<p>We have a winner.</p>
<p>But I think you guys want to completely dismantle and eradicate pickleball, abolish it off the</p>
<p>planet is what it sounds like from this manifesto.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to have to, I personally, we&rsquo;ve talked about this</p>
<p>a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty convinced that this is a fad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go the way of racquetball, eventually not going to be hearing about pickleball too</p>
<p>much in five to 10 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say, I do think this is going to have a little bit more longevity just because</p>
<p>of the accessibility aspect of it.</p>
<p>My goal at the end of each day is just to be alone.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to do is go to dinner with a bunch of women and hear a bunch of</p>
<p>yak.</p>
<p>Pickleball&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>You show up, you can talk for about two minutes before, then you play, smack talk, fun, then,</p>
<p>okay, bye, got to run, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spent time with people, but you don&rsquo;t have to hear about the boring, mundane bullshit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in their lives.</p>
<p>Are the courts that you all play on in New York, are they cross-contaminated generally?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We play on public courts always here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some really nice ones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some ones that are cracked and not so nice.</p>
<p>So far, the pickleball rise in New York has been limited either to private clubs or children&rsquo;s</p>
<p>playgrounds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re picking their enemies wisely.</p>
<p>I want to play a game with you guys, a game of would you rather.</p>
<p>Would you rather go on a hunting trip to South Africa with Don Jr.?</p>
<p>You have to ride in a plane with Don Jr. and Eric.</p>
<p>You have to share a hotel room with Don Jr. and Eric, and you have to kill two animals</p>
<p>in Africa.</p>
<p>This is horrible.</p>
<p>No one would ever pick that.</p>
<p>With Don Jr. and Eric for five days, or you have to play pickleball 10 hours a day for</p>
<p>five days in the most high-profile public pickleball court in Manhattan.</p>
<p>What do you pick?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going with Don Jr. because they have the best cocaine.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got the best cocaine.</p>
<p>You know that&rsquo;s going to be a great time.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll just get some earplugs for the rest.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Mike, what about you?</p>
<p>Are you playing pickleball?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re going on the hunting trip.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m telling you that&rsquo;s how much these guys hate pickleball.</p>
<p>We got to stay on message.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come this far.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got another one.</p>
<p>You have to go campaign with Ted Cruz at his fundraisers, at his political speeches.</p>
<p>You have to go fucking crazy with Ted for one week, 24-7 with Ted one week, or play</p>
<p>pickleball for two days.</p>
<p>These options sound so equally balanced.</p>
<p>I may choose pickleball in this and kind of wear a shirt that says, like, I am a political</p>
<p>prisoner.</p>
<p>I may play it that way is how I&rsquo;m getting out of this one.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how fucking bad Ted Cruz is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d go with Don Jr. because you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Well, but Don Jr. has the good drugs.</p>
<p>You probably do a lot of blow.</p>
<p>You can tell by looking at Ted, he&rsquo;s not doing cocaine.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an evil.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have fun.</p>
<p>No fun.</p>
<p>He hates fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to vote on the tennis pickleball issue because that&rsquo;s like the only political</p>
<p>thing I vote on.</p>
<p>What is your intention?</p>
<p>You know, like I read an article in Vanity Fair like a year ago that Obama was playing</p>
<p>pickleball.</p>
<p>Larry David was playing pickleball, both of whom I love passionately and like cool people</p>
<p>are playing pickleball.</p>
<p>Are they on your list?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re on watch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking into who they&rsquo;re getting paid off by.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re following the money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re following the money big time.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like that thing.</p>
<p>Like when you see celebrities endorsing something this far, like there&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it for free.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we know that there&rsquo;s like some money involved.</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s a ton of people who are investing in like Major League Pickleball and such.</p>
<p>Well, I liked watching, I liked watching when Tom Brady and LeBron both bought their</p>
<p>Major League Pickleball teams.</p>
<p>The main sport they played, they started to do horribly.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re thinking there could be a little bit of a pickleball curse going on.</p>
<p>So watch out for celebrities.</p>
<p>LeBron bought one, I think Steph Curry bought one, Tom Brady bought one, a bunch of celebrities</p>
<p>are buying them.</p>
<p>Which is really fitting because it&rsquo;s like the most Shark Tank sport ever.</p>
<p>Do you consider it a sport deep down in your heart or do you just consider it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a game.</p>
<p>I think we consider it kind of alongside maybe a cornhole or like the spike ball where you</p>
<p>hit the trampoline ball.</p>
<p>Have you watched on YouTube, have you watched like a professional pickleball?</p>
<p>Are you a fan of those?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve watched those with people who like pickleball and even them are like.</p>
<p>You watch tennis and then you&rsquo;re watching Wimbledon and then the commercial comes on</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like timeless and it&rsquo;s Roger Federer.</p>
<p>He has this beautiful forehand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Rolex.</p>
<p>So then we start getting into pickleball, God, I really like pickleball, but I mean</p>
<p>God, I mean that pickleball channel, I mean it&rsquo;s really trashy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard on him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the double-edged sword of being the, you know, this is accessible and not so snooty</p>
<p>is that tennis gets to have, you know, not that we as leftists would love it, but you</p>
<p>know, Rolex, you know, Miu Miu did a tennis line, Lexus, that&rsquo;s a lot of class.</p>
<p>Pickleball kind of gives me the vibes of like when you go to like a new brewery and they</p>
<p>have like fat ass IPA.</p>
<p>This is not giving me like a Roger Federer in like a white and gold cashmere sweater</p>
<p>vest going out on the Wimbledon center court, exactly.</p>
<p>And I think like there is like some impressiveness, but like the same level as like watching someone</p>
<p>do hacky sack tricks, like well-timed and such.</p>
<p>What cracks me up about pickleball is very, it evokes a lot of emotion.</p>
<p>Like you guys wound up like cheap clocks over pickleball so much so that you&rsquo;re willing</p>
<p>to go on a cocaine bender with Don.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what I would say about the emotion of pickleball is I think when you have all</p>
<p>these fights over, you know, local tennis courts being taken over, child protective</p>
<p>services getting caught on kids, like all of this, I feel like that&rsquo;s this, this, these,</p>
<p>these pickleballers getting hyped up on this, like this juice of just like, we&rsquo;re the most</p>
<p>popular sport.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the fastest growing sport.</p>
<p>Everyone should play our sport.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, you know, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re going to end in a Jonestown type situation</p>
<p>pretty soon.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what, I will make the goddamn Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>She is in.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll come back and we&rsquo;ll co-host the podcast with you pumps after, after that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about what a nut she was that it actually was a cult.</p>
<p>We knew it all along.</p>
<p>You sniffed it out well before I did, but definitely we all landed at the same place.</p>
<p>Who do you think&rsquo;s behind this, this pickleball movement?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s any necessarily one person behind it, though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very fun to allege that.</p>
<p>And when you have just a subsec account on Twitter, no one can really stop you from saying</p>
<p>whatever you want.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So my question is the only question that I couldn&rsquo;t wrap my head around in the manifesto</p>
<p>was why is tennis less capitalistic than pickleball?</p>
<p>Because we say so.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>The serious answer is, I think like there&rsquo;s a lot of people who play on public courts,</p>
<p>especially in New York city who aren&rsquo;t like country club people and they get like kind</p>
<p>of ignored as being part of like the tennis community.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not just rich white people playing tennis.</p>
<p>Who is your goat?</p>
<p>Who do you think is the goat?</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but it&rsquo;s Novak.</p>
<p>God damn it.</p>
<p>Well, Michael, you&rsquo;re missing the, you&rsquo;re missing the best answer here, which is Serena</p>
<p>is the obvious.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a step in a city class right now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to invite him in the U S open next year.</p>
<p>Open invitation.</p>
<p>If he wants to talk about, you know, communism, if he wants to talk about vaccines, anything</p>
<p>he can come to our small Brooklyn apartments and we&rsquo;ll just have a great time.</p>
<p>I bet he does that.</p>
<p>Sounds exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe he can take all the bacteria out of your drinks for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we will have no gluten around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll knock on my neighbor&rsquo;s door and say, I can&rsquo;t have gluten in the building.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>We are all for a open and civil debate, no matter how wound up we are or you are, you</p>
<p>know, we&rsquo;re going to, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re down to have it out.</p>
<p>Everything should be, um, at club leftist tennis.</p>
<p>So on, on Twitter it&rsquo;s at club left tennis, but I think we have merch on big cartel and</p>
<p>we have articles from ourselves and a lot of actually really incredible, like professional</p>
<p>journalists, um, on our sub stack.</p>
<p>So club leftist tennis dot sub stack.com to, to read more, to, uh, to come, to come be,</p>
<p>uh, tennis pills.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Bye Charlie.</p>
<p>Thank you guys.</p>
<p>So much.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Loved it.</p>
<p>Love them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>How much do you love?</p>
<p>Because I said so was the answer.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I mean, on the capitalist question, why is pickleball worse than tennis?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because we said so.</p>
<p>So Nealey, you live in Brooklyn, you&rsquo;re around people like this all the time.</p>
<p>How fun is that?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so great.</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>
<p>So what I want to do is I want to take all of you ladies to play pickleball.</p>
<p>I really want to play pickleball.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I really want to play pickleball.</p>
<p>I really want to play pickleball.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is a stupid question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is this going to be a stupid question?</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try lightly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p>
<p>Why is it called pickleball?</p>
<p>So the story, it&rsquo;s a dumb name, I&rsquo;m going to give it to you.</p>
<p>I wish it was named something cooler.</p>
<p>But the story is that on the West coast in the state of Washington, there was a family</p>
<p>and they were bored and they had like a whiffleball and some paddles and they kind of made up</p>
<p>this game.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve read one article that said like their dog&rsquo;s name was Pickle.</p>
<p>Really weird name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a pickle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird name, but it&rsquo;s a great, fantastic and contrary to what club leftist tennis says,</p>
<p>it is a sport.</p>
<p>Like cornhole is a sport.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>Like cornhole and that other game.</p>
<p>Hacky sack.</p>
<p>Yeah, the hacky sack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you what, I&rsquo;m going to get you guys out there and we&rsquo;ll check your heart</p>
<p>rates and then y&rsquo;all can tell me if you think it&rsquo;s a sport or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like us on all the things, all the things, the subscribe, subscribe to the things, follow</p>
<p>us on the things, rate, rate, do your deal, write a review.</p>
<p>Only if it&rsquo;s really hateful.</p>
<p>We will see you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
