    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the first episode of the History of English podcast.</p>
<p>My name is Kevin Stroud, your host for this podcast which will explore the history of</p>
<p>the English language.</p>
<p>In this introductory episode, I want to lay the groundwork for the series of episodes</p>
<p>which will follow.</p>
<p>Let me begin by noting that this is ultimately a history podcast.</p>
<p>The topic happens to be English, but this is not a podcast about the technical aspects</p>
<p>of English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my goal or intention to teach anyone proper grammar or pronunciation.</p>
<p>Instead, this is a podcast about the history of the language.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t separate the history of the language from the history of those who spoke</p>
<p>the language.</p>
<p>So this is really the story of the English language from its earliest ancestor, the Indo-European</p>
<p>language spoken in Eastern Europe over 4,000 years ago, to its current status as the closest</p>
<p>thing we have to a modern international language.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the story of the people, places, and events which shaped the language into</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s become today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the story of the words which we use today and how those words came into our</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>In speaking of the language we have today, it&rsquo;s a language that&rsquo;s emerged from an obscure</p>
<p>Germanic dialect spoken in Northern Europe about 2,000 years ago to one of the most commonly</p>
<p>spoken languages in the world.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, English ranks behind Chinese and Spanish in terms of the most commonly</p>
<p>spoken native or first languages.</p>
<p>But when second or other learned languages are taken into account, it rivals Chinese</p>
<p>in terms of speakers and is undoubtedly the most commonly learned language in the world.</p>
<p>Some linguists estimate that nearly one billion people speak English today.</p>
<p>Of the total number of English speakers, it&rsquo;s estimated that there are approximately three</p>
<p>times as many non-native speakers of English as native speakers.</p>
<p>And this reflects the desire of people around the world to learn English as the de facto</p>
<p>international language.</p>
<p>English is routinely used as the common medium of communication among speakers of other languages.</p>
<p>When German businessmen established a Volkswagen plant in China, the Germans and their Chinese</p>
<p>counterparts used English to communicate with each other, even though it&rsquo;s not the native</p>
<p>language of either group.</p>
<p>And a Russian airline pilot landing in Rome will communicate with the Italian air traffic</p>
<p>controller in English, not Russian or Italian, because English is the official language for</p>
<p>international aviation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very easy to see that English has emerged and continues to emerge as the predominant</p>
<p>international lingua franca.</p>
<p>So why should we bother learning about the history of English?</p>
<p>Well, first, simply because it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It really is a fascinating story.</p>
<p>But also because it helps to explain many of the peculiar aspects of English.</p>
<p>Why do so many of us say, I could care less, when what we really mean to say is, I could</p>
<p>not care less?</p>
<p>And why do we have houses, but not mouses?</p>
<p>We have mice.</p>
<p>Why do we have boxes and foxes, but not oxes?</p>
<p>We have oxen.</p>
<p>We have man, woman, and child, but we don&rsquo;t have mans, womans, and childs.</p>
<p>Why do we spell knife with a K, or gnome with a G?</p>
<p>And why is the F sound sometimes spelled with a GH as in cough, and other times with a PH</p>
<p>like phone?</p>
<p>I mean, I could go on and on because the examples seem endless.</p>
<p>But the answers to those questions lie in the history of the language.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve heard some people express that English must have an unusually large number of these</p>
<p>peculiarities compared to other languages.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not necessarily true.</p>
<p>There are lots of languages, and many of them are quite complicated and have lots of unusual</p>
<p>or peculiar rules.</p>
<p>But the one thing that English does have that lots of other languages don&rsquo;t is a massive</p>
<p>vocabulary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally agreed that no other language has the number of words that English has.</p>
<p>And that should tell you something.</p>
<p>Unlike some languages, which reject outside influences, English has shown an incredible</p>
<p>willingness and ability to adapt and evolve, to borrow elements from other languages, including</p>
<p>words, and to adapt them into English.</p>
<p>About 1,000 years ago, in the year 1066 to be precise, an army led by William of Normandy</p>
<p>invaded England from northern France.</p>
<p>And many of you will know this story very well because William of Normandy became known</p>
<p>to history as William the Conqueror, the last foreign leader to invade and conquer</p>
<p>England.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Normans changed almost everything in England, socially, culturally,</p>
<p>economically, legally, and especially linguistically.</p>
<p>The defeated Anglo-Saxon earls were wiped out and removed from power, and they were</p>
<p>replaced by Norman French earls and knights who had fought with and supported William.</p>
<p>For the next three centuries, French became the official language of the English government,</p>
<p>the courts, the aristocracy, and the ruling class.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not until the late 1300s, around the beginning of the so-called Wars</p>
<p>of the Roses, that we have an English monarch who spoke English exclusively again.</p>
<p>What we see happening here is a theme which will extend throughout the podcast.</p>
<p>Language shift is not about numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about power.</p>
<p>A relatively small number of powerful people speaking one language can make a much larger</p>
<p>number of people learn their language.</p>
<p>We see the same phenomenon in Western Europe when a relatively small number of Latin-speaking</p>
<p>Romans imposed their language on the Celtic peoples who they invaded in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Today, almost everyone in continental Europe west of Germany speaks a language which evolved</p>
<p>from Latin, the so-called Romance languages.</p>
<p>We also see it in the spread of English in the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
<p>The total number of people who speak English as their first language is relatively small</p>
<p>compared to the world at large, yet people throughout the world seek to learn and communicate</p>
<p>with each other in English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this tendency for language to spread because of power, sometimes military or political</p>
<p>power, sometimes economic power, sometimes social or cultural power.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s this tendency for language to spread because of certain power associated with the</p>
<p>speakers of the language that caused a major upheaval in the English language when the</p>
<p>Norman French arrived in 1066.</p>
<p>Afterwards, French was imposed by the Normans as the official language of England.</p>
<p>During that period, English came very close to disappearing as a distinct language.</p>
<p>It would not be much of an exaggeration to say that it almost became an anglicized dialect</p>
<p>of French.</p>
<p>It absorbed a massive number of French words.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t become French.</p>
<p>It remained English, albeit a highly modified version of English.</p>
<p>It became a much larger language with an enhanced vocabulary.</p>
<p>The language changed so much as a result of this experience that linguists mark this period</p>
<p>as the transition from Old English or Anglo-Saxon to the period known as Middle English.</p>
<p>And this is but one example of how English survived by assimilating outside influences</p>
<p>rather than rejecting change and subsequently dying out.</p>
<p>The Norman conquest was just one event that changed the English language.</p>
<p>But all languages are constantly evolving and changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the changes are typically more gradual and subtle, not the sudden and</p>
<p>dramatic change marked by the Norman conquest of England.</p>
<p>In fact, linguists employ a general rule to mark the natural evolution that most languages experience.</p>
<p>That general rule is that most languages evolve over the course of a thousand years to the</p>
<p>point that a speaker at the beginning of that period would not be able to communicate with</p>
<p>a speaker at the end of that period because of the natural language change.</p>
<p>And this general rule certainly applies to English.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, there are earlier periods of English known as Old English and an intermediate</p>
<p>period known as Middle English.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a third period which represents the version of English which we speak today</p>
<p>called Modern English.</p>
<p>So those are the three periods to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Now if I conducted a poll and told most people that there were three periods of English,</p>
<p>Old English, Middle English, and Modern English, and I asked them to tell me which period Shakespeare</p>
<p>belonged to, I suspect that the overwhelming majority would answer either Old English or</p>
<p>Middle English.</p>
<p>In fact, I would not be completely surprised if no one gave the correct answer, which is</p>
<p>Modern English.</p>
<p>Shakespeare is considered a Modern English writer because we can read his words today</p>
<p>without the need for a translation.</p>
<p>Now I know some of you will say, hold on a minute, I need a translator to read Shakespeare.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between not understanding Shakespeare&rsquo;s references, or the particular</p>
<p>way in which he uses words for literary effect, and not understanding the language itself.</p>
<p>There are certainly translations of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works into conversational contemporary English,</p>
<p>and those translations can be helpful, but they&rsquo;re not necessary.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to spend the time and effort, you can read Hamlet or Macbeth today in the</p>
<p>same words Shakespeare used and still understand the gist of the story.</p>
<p>Another literary work from the same time period is the King James Bible.</p>
<p>Once again, there are modern translations of the King James Bible to make it easier</p>
<p>to read, but it&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re so inclined, you can read the King James Bible and understand it without a translation.</p>
<p>Now Shakespeare&rsquo;s works and the King James Bible were written in the late 1500s and early 1600s.</p>
<p>So this was near the beginning of the Modern English period, and that&rsquo;s part of the reason</p>
<p>why there are noticeable differences between the English used in those works and contemporary English.</p>
<p>But English has not evolved to an extent that we can no longer understand those 16th and</p>
<p>17th century works.</p>
<p>But if we were to go back in time a little further, from the 1600s to the 1300s, we would</p>
<p>find ourselves in the period known as Middle English, the period following the Norman conquest</p>
<p>of England.</p>
<p>And the big difference between that period and the Modern English period is the way words</p>
<p>were pronounced, especially vowels.</p>
<p>For some reason, around the year 1500, English speakers in the British Isles, primarily in</p>
<p>England and even more specifically in the south of England, in and around London, they</p>
<p>began to change the way they pronounced their vowels.</p>
<p>This is known as the Great Vowel Shift.</p>
<p>This shift or pronunciation change is one of the events which marks the transition from</p>
<p>Middle English to Modern English.</p>
<p>So what did Middle English sound like?</p>
<p>Well, one of the benefits of a podcast is that I can actually illustrate how these older</p>
<p>versions of the language sounded.</p>
<p>But first, a disclaimer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert in the pronunciation of Middle English or Old English.</p>
<p>Again, my focus here is on the history, not so much the precise manner in which Old English</p>
<p>vowels or consonants were enunciated.</p>
<p>However, I hope that my pronunciation will give you at least a general sense of how the</p>
<p>earlier versions of the language sounded.</p>
<p>So in order to illustrate the evolution of English, I want to read a passage from one</p>
<p>of the most important pieces of literature composed during the period of Middle English,</p>
<p>The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that you read The Canterbury Tales in school.</p>
<p>I know I did.</p>
<p>But what you probably read was a Modern English translation of the original text written by</p>
<p>Chaucer in the 1300s.</p>
<p>The book is a collection of tales told by a group of pilgrims on their way to the shrine</p>
<p>of Thomas Beckett at Canterbury Cathedral.</p>
<p>The following passage occurs near the beginning of the book as the author recalls his first</p>
<p>impressions upon meeting the pilgrims, in this instance a knight.</p>
<p>A knight there was, and he was a worthy man, who from the time that he first began, to</p>
<p>ride out, he loved chivalry, truth and honour, freedom and courtesy.</p>
<p>He fought bravely in his lord&rsquo;s wars, and in them he had ridden no other man so far.</p>
<p>As well in Christendom as in heathen places, and ever honoured for his worthiness.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s the same passage as it was actually written by Chaucer, and as it would have been</p>
<p>read in the 1300s during the period of Middle English.</p>
<p>A knight there was, and that a worthy man, that from the time that he first began, to</p>
<p>ride out, he loved chivalry, truth and honour, freedom and courtesy.</p>
<p>He fought bravely in his lord&rsquo;s wars, and in them he had ridden no other man so far.</p>
<p>As well in Christendom as in heathen places, and ever honoured for his worthiness.</p>
<p>That was the sound of Middle English.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing to take from that passage is that it&rsquo;s really not that</p>
<p>far from modern English.</p>
<p>The words and grammar are very similar.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is pronunciation.</p>
<p>Again there was a time when certain words, and especially the vowels, were pronounced</p>
<p>differently than today.</p>
<p>There are three key components to language.</p>
<p>The words that are spoken, the vocabulary, the way in which those words are put together,</p>
<p>the grammar, and the way in which the words are actually spoken, the pronunciation.</p>
<p>The first two of those are very similar to modern English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the third that marks the biggest difference.</p>
<p>Let me give you another example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use a passage which is often used for the purpose of illustrating the evolution</p>
<p>of English, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use this passage not for any particular religious purposes, but simply</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a passage which exists in many different historical languages, including</p>
<p>modern, middle, and old English.</p>
<p>The modern English version comes from the 1549 Book of Common Prayer, so this is shortly</p>
<p>before Shakespeare&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</p>
<p>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.</p>
<p>Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that</p>
<p>trespass against us.</p>
<p>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</p>
<p>Now in Middle English.</p>
<p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</p>
<p>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.</p>
<p>Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that</p>
<p>trespass against us.</p>
<p>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</p>
<p>So as you can hear, Middle English is not the English we speak today, but it&rsquo;s close</p>
<p>enough that we can recognize it as a form of English.</p>
<p>But if we were to go back in time even further, to the period before Middle English, before</p>
<p>the arrival of the Norman French in Britain, we see and hear a language that&rsquo;s barely recognizable</p>
<p>as a form of English at all, but it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the earliest version of English, which is known as Old English, or Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard English described as a Germanic language, but you may not know</p>
<p>exactly what that means.</p>
<p>Does that mean English came from German?</p>
<p>No, not exactly.</p>
<p>It means that English, like modern German, Dutch, Swedish, and Norwegian, all evolved</p>
<p>from an ancient ancestral language spoken in Northern Europe called Germanic, or Proto-Germanic</p>
<p>to be precise.</p>
<p>So English did not come from German, nor did German come from English.</p>
<p>They each came from an even older shared language.</p>
<p>So it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising that the further back in time we go, the more English looks</p>
<p>and sounds like German.</p>
<p>Because the further back in time we go, the more they have in common.</p>
<p>Old English was spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, who were Germanic-speaking tribes from Northern</p>
<p>Germany and modern-day Denmark.</p>
<p>They were only a small part of many Germanic tribes that dominated Central Europe east</p>
<p>of the Rhine.</p>
<p>And when the Roman Empire began to collapse in the fourth and fifth centuries, the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes poured into Western Europe, into the areas previously controlled by the Romans.</p>
<p>This included Southern Britain, in the area we know today as England.</p>
<p>What began as an invitation became a migration and eventually became an outright invasion.</p>
<p>Beginning in the fifth century, these Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxons defeated and displaced much of</p>
<p>the native Celtic-speaking Britons, and they established several independent Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>kingdoms, which eventually coalesced in the face of Viking invasions beginning in the</p>
<p>seventh century to become a unified nation.</p>
<p>These were the same Anglo-Saxons who were defeated by the Norman French in 1066.</p>
<p>So what did this very early version of Anglo-Saxon English sound like?</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, we have many sources from this period to document the language of the</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known is one of the earliest poems composed in English.</p>
<p>You may have read it in English class in school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the epic poem called Beowulf, and it&rsquo;s virtually certain that if you read it, you</p>
<p>read a modern English translation because, as you will see and hear, Old English is so</p>
<p>far removed from Modern English and so much closer to the original Proto-Germanic language</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s completely foreign to modern ears.</p>
<p>Remember the general rule that languages evolve over the course of a thousand years to the</p>
<p>point where they can no longer be mutually understood.</p>
<p>So let me read the first few lines from Beowulf in Modern English.</p>
<p>So the speardanes in days gone by, and the kings who ruled them, had courage and greatness.</p>
<p>We have heard of those princes&rsquo; heroic campaigns.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s the same passage in the original Old English.</p>
<p>As you can hear, there&rsquo;s very little in that which is recognizable to modern English ears.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also listen to the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in Old English and compare it to the Middle English</p>
<p>version I read earlier.</p>
<p>Again, this is far removed from Modern English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to discern much in that passage that&rsquo;s familiar as English.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, even though Modern English differs from Middle English in pronunciation,</p>
<p>it still shares a great deal of vocabulary and grammar.</p>
<p>But when compared to Old English, it shares neither pronunciation nor grammar.</p>
<p>And the vocabulary is so far removed from Modern English that we only see glimpses of</p>
<p>words that will eventually become recognizable to us.</p>
<p>So how did we get from there to here?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;m going to try to answer over the course of this podcast</p>
<p>series.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take you back to the beginning, the very beginning, to the ancient language</p>
<p>from which English ultimately derived, the oldest known ancestor of English, the Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>Of course, this is also the oldest known ancestor of almost all of the languages of Europe,</p>
<p>as well as many of the languages of Central Asia, including Sanskrit and Persian.</p>
<p>Over the next few episodes of the podcast, I&rsquo;m going to cover the period from the original</p>
<p>Indo-European language to the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain.</p>
<p>This is the story of Pre-English, and it&rsquo;s very important to the overall story of English</p>
<p>because English is a mutt language, combining elements of many different languages.</p>
<p>But almost all of those major influences share a common Indo-European ancestry.</p>
<p>The Germanic languages, Greek, Latin, French, the Celtic languages, they all came from this</p>
<p>common source.</p>
<p>So in order to fully understand the history of English, you have to understand this essential</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>I will then look at the period from the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain to their defeat</p>
<p>at the hands of the Norman French.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the period of Old English.</p>
<p>After that, we will cover the period from the Norman conquest in 1066 to the time just</p>
<p>before Shakespeare and the King James Bible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the period of Middle English.</p>
<p>And then the last portion of the podcast will cover the period from Shakespeare through</p>
<p>the creation of the British Empire and the expansion of English to North America, the</p>
<p>Indian subcontinent, Australia, and beyond.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the period of Modern English.</p>
<p>Collectively, that&rsquo;s the story of English.</p>
<p>So in closing this introductory episode, I would like to make note of a quick housekeeping</p>
<p>matter.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to check out the website for this podcast, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Each episode is available at the site, and there&rsquo;s a specific page dedicated to each</p>
<p>episode with a summary of the episode and maps and illustrations mentioned in the episode.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
