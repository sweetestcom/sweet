    <p>The following is a conversation with Konstantin Batygin, planetary astrophysicist at Caltech,</p>
<p>interested in, among other things, the search for the distant, the mysterious, Planet Nine,</p>
<p>in the outer regions of our solar system.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Squarespace, Literati, Onnit, and Ni.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that our little sun is orbited by not just a few planets in</p>
<p>the planetary region, but trillions of objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud that</p>
<p>extends over three light years out.</p>
<p>This to me is amazing, since Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our sun, is only 4.2 light</p>
<p>years away, and all of it is mostly covered in darkness.</p>
<p>When I get a chance to go out swimming in the ocean far from the shore, I&rsquo;m sometimes</p>
<p>overcome by the terrifying and the exciting feeling of not knowing what&rsquo;s there in the</p>
<p>deep darkness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel about the edge of our solar system.</p>
<p>One day, I hope humans will travel there, or at the very least, AI systems that carry</p>
<p>the flame of human consciousness.</p>
<p>This is the Lux Friedman Podcast, and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Konstantin Batygin.</p>
<p>What is Planet Nine?</p>
<p>Planet Nine is an object that we believe lives in the solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>
<p>It orbits the sun with a period of about 10,000 years, and is about five Earth masses.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a hypothesized object.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence for this kind of object.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different explanations.</p>
<p>Can you give like an overview of the planets in our solar system?</p>
<p>How many are there?</p>
<p>What do we know and not know about them at a high level?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That sounds like a good plan.</p>
<p>So look, the solar system basically is comprised of two parts, the inner and the outer solar</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>The inner solar system has the planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.</p>
<p>Now Mercury is about 40% of the orbital separation of where the Earth is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s closer to the sun, Venus is about 70%, then Mars is about 160% further away from</p>
<p>the sun than is the Earth.</p>
<p>These planets that we, one of them we occupy, right, are pretty small, okay?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re two leading order sort of heavily overgrown asteroids, if you will.</p>
<p>And this becomes evident when you move out further in the solar system and encounter</p>
<p>Jupiter, which is 316 Earth masses, right, 10 times the size.</p>
<p>You know, and Saturn is another huge one, 90 Earth masses at about 10 times the separation</p>
<p>from the sun as is the Earth, and then you have Uranus and Neptune at 20 and 30 respectively.</p>
<p>For a long time, that is where the kind of massive part of the solar system ended.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve learned in the last 30 years is that beyond Neptune, there&rsquo;s this expansive</p>
<p>field of icy debris, a second icy asteroid belt in the solar system.</p>
<p>A lot of people have heard of the asteroid belt, which lives between Mars and Jupiter,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty common thing that people like to imagine and draw on lunch boxes and stuff.</p>
<p>But beyond Neptune, there&rsquo;s a much more massive and much more radially expansive field of</p>
<p>debris.</p>
<p>Pluto, by the way, it belongs to that second, you know, icy asteroid belt, which we call</p>
<p>the Kuiper belt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a big object within that population of bodies.</p>
<p>Wow, Pluto the planet.</p>
<p>Pluto the dwarf planet, the former planet, you know.</p>
<p>Why is Pluto not a planet anymore?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s tiny.</p>
<p>We used to&hellip;</p>
<p>So size matters when it comes to planets.</p>
<p>Oh, 100%, 100%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a fascinating story.</p>
<p>When Pluto was discovered in 1930, the reason it was discovered in the first place is because</p>
<p>astronomers at the time were looking for a seven Earth mass planet somewhere beyond Neptune.</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that such an object exists.</p>
<p>When they found something, they interpreted that as a seven Earth mass planet and immediately</p>
<p>revised its mass downward because they couldn&rsquo;t resolve the object with the telescope.</p>
<p>So it looked like just a point mass, you know, star rather than a physical disk.</p>
<p>They said, well, maybe it&rsquo;s not seven, maybe it&rsquo;s one, right?</p>
<p>And then, so over the next, you know, I guess 40 years, Pluto&rsquo;s mass kept getting revised</p>
<p>downwards, downwards, downwards until it was realized that it&rsquo;s like 500 times less massive</p>
<p>than the Earth.</p>
<p>I mean, like Pluto&rsquo;s surface area is almost perfectly equal to the surface area of Russia</p>
<p>actually.</p>
<p>And you know, Russia is big, but it&rsquo;s not a planet.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, actually we can touch more on that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another discussion.</p>
<p>So in some sense, earlier in the century, Pluto represented kind of our ignorance about</p>
<p>the edges of the solar system.</p>
<p>And perhaps planet nine is the thing that represents our ignorance about now the modern</p>
<p>set of ignorances about the edges of our solar system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to put it.</p>
<p>By the way, just imagining this belt of astral debris at the edge of our solar system is</p>
<p>incredible.</p>
<p>Can you talk about it a little bit?</p>
<p>What is the Kuiper belt and what is the Oort cloud?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So look, the simple way to think about it is that if you imagine, you know, Neptune&rsquo;s</p>
<p>orbit like a circle, right?</p>
<p>Kind of maybe a factor of one and a half, 1.3 times bigger on a radius of 1.3 times</p>
<p>bigger, you&rsquo;ve got a whole collection of icy objects.</p>
<p>Most of these objects are sort of the size of Austin, you know, maybe a little bit smaller.</p>
<p>If you then zoom out and explore the orbits of the most long period Kuiper belt object,</p>
<p>these are the things that have the biggest orbits and take the longest time to go around</p>
<p>in, then what you find is that beyond a critical orbit size, beyond a critical orbit period,</p>
<p>which is about 4,000 years, you start to see weird structure, like all the orbits sort</p>
<p>of point into one direction.</p>
<p>And all the orbits are kind of tilted in the same way by about 20 degrees with respect</p>
<p>to Sun.</p>
<p>This is particularly pronounced in orbits that are not heavily affected by Neptune.</p>
<p>So there you start to see this weird dichotomy where they&rsquo;re objects which are stable, which</p>
<p>Neptune does not mess with gravitationally, and unstable objects.</p>
<p>The unstable objects are basically all over the place because they&rsquo;re being kicked around</p>
<p>by Neptune.</p>
<p>The stable orbits show this remarkable pattern of clustering.</p>
<p>We back, I guess, five years ago interpreted this pattern of clustering as a gravitational</p>
<p>one way sign, the existence of a planet in a distant planet, right?</p>
<p>Something that is shepherding and confining these orbits together.</p>
<p>Of course, right, you have to have some skepticism when you&rsquo;re talking about these things.</p>
<p>You have to ask the question of, okay, how statistically significant is this clustering?</p>
<p>And there are many authors that have indeed called that into question.</p>
<p>We have done our own analyses and basically, just like with all statistics where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of multiple ways to do the exercise, you can either ask the question of if I have</p>
<p>a telescope that has surveyed this part of the sky, what are the chances that I would</p>
<p>discover this clustering?</p>
<p>That basically tells you that you have zero confidence, right?</p>
<p>That does not give you a confident answer one way or another.</p>
<p>Another way to do the statistics, which is what we prefer to do, is to say we have a</p>
<p>whole night sky of discoveries in the Kuiper Belt, right?</p>
<p>And if we have some object over there, which has right ascension and declination, which</p>
<p>is a way to say it&rsquo;s there on the sky, and it has some brightness, that means somebody</p>
<p>looked over there and discovered an object, was able to discover an object of that brightness</p>
<p>or brighter.</p>
<p>Through that analysis, you can construct a whole map on the sky of kind of where all</p>
<p>of the surveys that have ever been done have collectively looked.</p>
<p>So if you do the exercise this way, the false alarm probability of the clustering on which</p>
<p>the Planet Nine hypothesis is built is about 0.4%.</p>
<p>Wow, okay, so there&rsquo;s a million questions here.</p>
<p>One, when you say bright objects, why are they bright?</p>
<p>Are we talking about actual objects within the Kuiper Belt or the stuff we see through</p>
<p>the Kuiper Belt?</p>
<p>This is the actual stuff we see in the Kuiper Belt.</p>
<p>The way you go about discovering Kuiper Belt objects is pretty easy.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s easy in theory, right?</p>
<p>Hard in practice.</p>
<p>All you do is you take snapshots of the sky, right?</p>
<p>Use that direction, say, and take a high exposure snapshot.</p>
<p>Then you wait a night and you do it again, and then you wait another night and you do</p>
<p>it again.</p>
<p>Objects that are just random stars in the galaxy don&rsquo;t move on the sky, whereas objects</p>
<p>in the solar system will slowly move.</p>
<p>This is no different than if you&rsquo;re driving down the freeway, it looks like trees are</p>
<p>going by you faster than the clouds, right?</p>
<p>This is parallax.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re reflecting light off of the sun and it&rsquo;s going back and hitting this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of a glimmer from the different objects that you can see based on</p>
<p>the reflection from the sun.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s actual light, it&rsquo;s not darkness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>These are just big icicles basically that are just reflecting sunlight back at you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s then easy to understand why it&rsquo;s so hard to discover them because light has to travel</p>
<p>to something like 40 times the distance between the earth and the sun and then get reflected</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>Was that like an hour travel?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something like that because the earth to the sun is eight minutes, I believe.</p>
<p>Something in that order of magnitude.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So you have to account for all of that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a huge amount of data, pixels that are coming from the pictures and you</p>
<p>have to integrate all of that together to paint a sort of like a high estimate of the</p>
<p>different objects.</p>
<p>Can you track them?</p>
<p>Can you be like, that&rsquo;s Bob?</p>
<p>Like, can you like?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>In fact, one of them is named Joe Biden.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not like, this is not even a joke, right?</p>
<p>Is there a Trump one or no?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for that.</p>
<p>But like the way it works is if you discover one, you right away get a license plate for</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>So like the first four numbers is the first year that this object has appeared on, you</p>
<p>know, in the data set, if you will.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like this code that follows it, which basically tells you where in the</p>
<p>sky it is, right?</p>
<p>So one of the really interesting Kuiper Belt objects, which is very much part of the Planet</p>
<p>Nine story is called VP113, because Joe Biden was vice president at the time, you know,</p>
<p>got nicknamed Biden.</p>
<p>VP113?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He got nicknamed Biden.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the fingerprint for any particular object?</p>
<p>Like how do you know it&rsquo;s the same one?</p>
<p>Or you just kind of like, yeah, from night to night, you take a picture, how do you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same object?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the way you know is it appears in almost exactly the same part of the sky except for</p>
<p>move, but it moves.</p>
<p>But this is why actually you need at least three nights because oftentimes asteroids,</p>
<p>which are much closer to the earth, like will appear to move only slightly, but then on</p>
<p>the third night will move away.</p>
<p>So that third night is really there to detect acceleration.</p>
<p>Now the thing that I didn&rsquo;t really realize until, you know, I started observing together</p>
<p>with my partner in crime in all this, Mike Brown, is just the fact that for the first</p>
<p>year when you make these detections, the only thing you really know with confidence is where</p>
<p>it is on the night sky and how far away it is, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the orbit because over three days the object just moves so little, right?</p>
<p>That whole motion on the sky is entirely coming from motion of the earth, right?</p>
<p>So the earth is kind of the car, the object is the tree and you see it move.</p>
<p>So then to get some confident information about what its orbit looks like, you have</p>
<p>to come back a year later and then measure it again.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So three nights then come back a year later and do another three nights so you get the</p>
<p>velocity of the acceleration from the three nights and then you have the maybe the additional</p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>Because an orbit is basically described by six parameters.</p>
<p>So you at least need six independent points, but in reality you need many more observations</p>
<p>to really pin down the orbit well.</p>
<p>And from that you&rsquo;re able to construct for that one particular object and orbit and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s of course, like how many objects are there?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like four ish thousand now.</p>
<p>But like the, in the future that could be like millions.</p>
<p>Oh sure, oh sure.</p>
<p>So in fact these things are hard to predict, but there&rsquo;s a new observatory called the Vera</p>
<p>Rubin Observatory, which is coming online maybe next year.</p>
<p>I mean with COVID these things are a little bit more uncertain, but they&rsquo;ve actually been</p>
<p>making great progress with construction.</p>
<p>And so that telescope is just going to sort of scan the night sky every day automatically</p>
<p>and just, it&rsquo;s such an efficient survey that it might increase the census of the distant</p>
<p>Kuiper Belt, the things that I&rsquo;m interested in by a factor of a hundred.</p>
<p>I mean that would be, that would be really cool.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s an incredible&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean they might just find planet nine.</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Like almost like literally pictures, like visually.</p>
<p>I mean, sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like the first detection you make, all you know is where it is in the sky and how far</p>
<p>away it is.</p>
<p>If something is, you know, 500 times away from the sun, as far away from the sun as</p>
<p>is the earth, you know that&rsquo;s planet nine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the story concludes and then you can study it.</p>
<p>Now you can study it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m going to use that as like, I don&rsquo;t know, a pickup line or a dating strategy,</p>
<p>like see the person for three days and then don&rsquo;t see them at all and then see them again</p>
<p>in a year to determine the orbit.</p>
<p>And over time you figure out if sort of from a cosmic perspective, this, this whole thing</p>
<p>works.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have no dating advice to give.</p>
<p>I was going to use this as a metaphor to somehow map it onto the human condition.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You mentioned the Kuiper Belt.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Oort cloud?</p>
<p>If you look at the Neptune orbit as a one, then the Kuiper Belt is like 1.3 out there</p>
<p>and then we get farther and farther into the darkness.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Oort cloud?</p>
<p>So okay, you&rsquo;ve got the kind of main Kuiper Belt, which is about say 1.3, 1.5.</p>
<p>Then you have something called the scattered disc, which is kind of an extension of the</p>
<p>Kuiper Belt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bunch of these long, very elliptical orbits that hug the orbit of Neptune, but</p>
<p>come out very far.</p>
<p>So that, the scattered disc with the current senses, like the, some of the longest orbits</p>
<p>we know of have a semi major axis.</p>
<p>So half the orbit length, roughly speaking of about a thousand, thousand times the distance</p>
<p>between the earth and the sun.</p>
<p>Now if you keep moving out, okay, eventually once you&rsquo;re at sort of 10,000 to 100,000 roughly,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the Oort cloud is.</p>
<p>Now the Oort cloud is a distinct population of icy bodies and is distinct from the Kuiper</p>
<p>Belt.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s so expansive that it ends roughly halfway between us and the next star.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s edge is just dictated by to what extent does the solar gravity reach.</p>
<p>Solar gravity reaches that far?</p>
<p>So it has to, wow, imagining this is a little bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a giant, like vast icy rock thingy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a sphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s an almost spherical structure that engulfs, that encircles the sun and all</p>
<p>the long period comets come from the Oort cloud.</p>
<p>They come, the way that they appear, I mean, for already, I don&rsquo;t know, hundreds of years</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been detecting and occasionally like a comet will come in and it seemingly comes</p>
<p>out of nowhere.</p>
<p>The reason these long period comets appear on very, very long timescales, right?</p>
<p>These Oort cloud objects that are sitting 30,000 times as far away from the sun as is</p>
<p>the earth actually interact with the gravity of the galaxy, the tide, effectively the tide</p>
<p>that the galaxy exerts upon them and their orbits slowly change and they elongate to</p>
<p>the point where once they, their closest approach to the sun starts to reach a critical distance</p>
<p>where ice starts to sublimate, then we discover them as comets because then the ice comes</p>
<p>off of them.</p>
<p>They look beautiful in the night sky, et cetera, but they&rsquo;re all coming from really, really</p>
<p>far away.</p>
<p>So is there, are any of them coming our way from collisions?</p>
<p>Like how many collisions are there or is there a bunch of space for them to move around?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely collisionless out there.</p>
<p>The physical radii of objects are so small compared to the distance between them, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it is truly a collisionless environment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that probably in the age of the solar system have literally been zero collisions</p>
<p>in the Oort cloud.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So if you like draw a picture of the solar system, everything&rsquo;s really close together.</p>
<p>So everything I guess here is spaced far apart.</p>
<p>Do rogue planets like fly in every once in a while and join?</p>
<p>Not rogue planets, but rogue objects from out there.</p>
<p>Oh sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Join the party?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen a couple of them in the last three or so years, maybe four years now.</p>
<p>The first one was the one called Uamuamua and it&rsquo;s been all over the news.</p>
<p>The second one was Comet Borisov discovered by a guy named Borisov.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the way you know they&rsquo;re coming from elsewhere is unlike solar system objects which</p>
<p>travel on elliptical paths around the sun, these guys travel on hyperbolic paths.</p>
<p>So they come in, say hello and then they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>And the fact that they exist is totally like not surprising, right?</p>
<p>The Neptune is constantly ejecting Kuiper belt objects into interstellar space.</p>
<p>Our solar system itself is sort of leaking icy debris and ejecting it.</p>
<p>So presumably every planetary systems around other stars do exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about the millions of objects that are part of the Kuiper belt and part</p>
<p>of the Oort cloud.</p>
<p>Do you think some of them have primitive life?</p>
<p>It kind of makes you sad if there&rsquo;s like primitive life there and they&rsquo;re just kind of like lonely</p>
<p>out there in space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like how many of them do you think have life, like bacterial life?</p>
<p>Probably a negligible amount.</p>
<p>Zero with like a plus on top.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Zero plus plus.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you and I took a little trip to the interstellar medium, I think we would</p>
<p>develop cancer and die real fast, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty hostile radiation environment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually have to go to the interstellar medium.</p>
<p>You just have to leave the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field too.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re not doing so well suddenly.</p>
<p>So you know, this idea of, you know, life kind of traveling between places, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>entirely implausible, but you really have to twist, I think, a lot of parameters.</p>
<p>One of the problems we have is we don&rsquo;t actually know how life originates, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a second order question of survival in the interstellar medium and how</p>
<p>resilient it is because we think you require water, but, and that&rsquo;s certainly the case</p>
<p>for the earth, but you know, we really don&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>That said, I will argue that the question of like, are there aliens out there is a very</p>
<p>boring question because the answer is, of course there are.</p>
<p>I mean, like we know that there are planets around almost every star.</p>
<p>Of course there are other life forms.</p>
<p>Life is not some specific thing that happened on the earth and that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a statistical impossibility.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the difficult question is before even the fact that we don&rsquo;t know how life</p>
<p>originates, I don&rsquo;t think we even know what life is like definitionally, like formalizing</p>
<p>a kind of picture of, in terms of the mechanism we would use to search for life out there</p>
<p>or even when we&rsquo;re on a planet to say, is this life?</p>
<p>Is this rock that just moved from where it was yesterday life or maybe not even a rock,</p>
<p>something else?</p>
<p>I got to tell you, I want to know what life is, okay?</p>
<p>And I want you to show me.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a song to basically accompany every single thing we talk about today and</p>
<p>probably half of them are love songs and somehow we&rsquo;ll integrate George Michael into the whole</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So your intuition is there&rsquo;s life everywhere in our universe.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s entirely plausible.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s entirely plausible.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s intelligent life on earth and so yeah, taking that, like say whatever</p>
<p>this thing we got on earth, whether it&rsquo;s dolphins or humans, say that&rsquo;s intelligent.</p>
<p>Definitely dolphins.</p>
<p>I mean, have you seen the dolphins?</p>
<p>Well, they do some cruel stuff to each other.</p>
<p>So if cruelty is a definition of intelligence, they&rsquo;re pretty good and then humans are pretty</p>
<p>good in that regard.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like pigs are very intelligent.</p>
<p>I got actually a chance to hang out with pigs recently and they&rsquo;re, aside from the fact</p>
<p>they were trying to eat me, they love food, they love food, but there&rsquo;s an intelligence</p>
<p>to their eyes that was kind of like haunts me because I also love to eat meat and then</p>
<p>to meet the thing I later ate and that was very intelligent and almost charismatic with</p>
<p>the way he was expressing himself, herself, itself was quite incredible.</p>
<p>So all that to say is if we have intelligent life here on earth, if you take dolphins,</p>
<p>pigs, humans, from the perspective of like planetary science, how unique is earth?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So earth is not a common outcome of the planet formation process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a something on the order of maybe a 1% effect.</p>
<p>And by earth, I mean not just an earth mass planet, okay?</p>
<p>I mean the architecture of the solar system that allows the earth to exist in its kind</p>
<p>of very temperate way.</p>
<p>One thing to understand and this is pretty crucial, right, is that the earth itself formed</p>
<p>well after the gas disk that formed the giant planets had already dissipated.</p>
<p>You see stars start out with, you know, the star and then a disk of gas and dust that</p>
<p>encircles it, okay?</p>
<p>From this disk of gas and dust, big planets can emerge.</p>
<p>And we have over the last two, three decades discovered thousands of extra solar planets</p>
<p>as an orbit or other stars.</p>
<p>What we see is that many of them have these expansive hydrogen helium atmospheres.</p>
<p>The fact that the earth doesn&rsquo;t is deeply connected to the fact that earth took about</p>
<p>100 million years to form.</p>
<p>So we missed that, you know, train, so to speak, to get that hydrogen helium atmosphere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why actually we can see the sky, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the sky is, well, at least in most places, that&rsquo;s why the atmosphere is not completely</p>
<p>opaque.</p>
<p>With that, you know, kind of thinking in mind, I would argue that we&rsquo;re getting the kind</p>
<p>of emergent pictures that the earth is not, you know, everywhere, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sort of the sci fi view of things where we go to some other star and we just</p>
<p>land on random planets and they&rsquo;re all earth like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s totally not true.</p>
<p>But even a low probability event, even if you imagine that earth is a one in a million</p>
<p>or one in 10 million occurrence, there are 10 to the 12 stars in the galaxy, right?</p>
<p>So you just, you always win by, that&rsquo;s right, by supply.</p>
<p>They save you.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve hypothesized that our solar system once possessed a population of short period</p>
<p>planets that were destroyed by the evil Jupiter migrating through the solar nebula.</p>
<p>Can you explain?</p>
<p>Well, if I was to say what was the kind of the key outcome of searches for extra solar</p>
<p>planets, it is that most stars are encircled by short period planets that are, you know,</p>
<p>a few earth masses, right?</p>
<p>So a few times bigger than the earth and have orbital periods that kind of range from days</p>
<p>to weeks.</p>
<p>Now if you go and ask the solar system what&rsquo;s in our region, right, in that region, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely empty, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s astonishingly hollow.</p>
<p>And think, you know, from the sun is not some, you know, special star that decided that it</p>
<p>was going to form the solar system.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, the natural thing to assume is that the same processes of planet</p>
<p>formation that occurred everywhere else also occurred in the solar system.</p>
<p>Following this logic, it&rsquo;s not implausible to imagine that the solar system once possessed</p>
<p>a system of intra Mercurian, like, you know, compact system of planets.</p>
<p>So then we asked ourselves, would such a system survive to this day?</p>
<p>And the answer is no, at least our calculations suggested it&rsquo;s highly unlikely because of</p>
<p>the formation of Jupiter.</p>
<p>And Jupiter&rsquo;s primordial kind of wandering through the solar system would have sent this</p>
<p>collisional field of debris that would have pushed that system of planets onto the sun.</p>
<p>So was Jupiter, this primordial wandering, what did Jupiter look like?</p>
<p>Like, why was it wandering?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have the orbit it has today?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty certain that giant planets like Jupiter, when they form, they migrate.</p>
<p>The reason they migrate is, you know, on a detailed level, perhaps difficult to explain,</p>
<p>but just in a qualitative sense, they form in this fluid disk of gas and dust.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like, okay, if I plop down a raft somewhere in the ocean, will it stay</p>
<p>where you plop it down or will it kind of get carried around?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really a good analogy because it&rsquo;s not like Jupiter is being advected by the</p>
<p>currents of gas and dust, but the way it migrates is it carves out a hole in the disk and then</p>
<p>by interacting with the disk gravitationally, it can change its orbit.</p>
<p>The fact that the solar system has both Jupiter and Saturn here complicates things a lot because</p>
<p>you have to solve the problem of the evolution of the gas disk, the evolution of Jupiter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>orbit in the gas disk, plus evolution of Saturn&rsquo;s and their mutual interaction.</p>
<p>The common outcome of solving that problem, though, is pretty easy to explain.</p>
<p>Jupiter forms, its orbit shrinks, and then once Saturn forms, its orbit catches up basically</p>
<p>to the orbit of Jupiter and then both come out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this inward outward pattern of Jupiter&rsquo;s early motion that happens sort of</p>
<p>within the last million years of the lifetime of the solar system&rsquo;s primordial disk.</p>
<p>So while this is happening, if our calculations are correct, which I think they are, you can</p>
<p>destroy this inner system of, you know, few Earth mass planets.</p>
<p>And then in the aftermath of all this violence, you form the terrestrial planets.</p>
<p>Where would they come from in that case?</p>
<p>So Jupiter clears out the space, and then there&rsquo;s a few terrestrial planets that come</p>
<p>in and those come in from the disk somewhere, like one of the larger objects?</p>
<p>What actually happens in these calculations, you leave behind a rather mass depleted, like</p>
<p>remnant disk, only a couple Earth masses.</p>
<p>So then from that remnant population, annulus of material, over a hundred million years,</p>
<p>by just collisions, you grow the Earth and the Moon and everything else.</p>
<p>You said annulus?</p>
<p>Annulus.</p>
<p>Annulus, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful word.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like a disk that&rsquo;s kind of thin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a, yeah, it&rsquo;s something that is, you know, a disk that&rsquo;s so thin it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>flirting with being a ring.</p>
<p>Like I was going to say, this reminds me of Lord of the Rings, so like this, the word</p>
<p>just feels like it belongs in a token though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And so that, in your senses, you said like 1%, that&rsquo;s a rare, the way Jupiter and Saturn</p>
<p>danced and cleared out the short period debris and then changed the gravitational landscape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty rare thing too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>And moreover, like you don&rsquo;t even have to go to our calculations.</p>
<p>You can just ask the night sky, how many stars have Jupiter and Saturn analogs?</p>
<p>The answer is Jupiter and Saturn analogs are found around only 10% of Sun like stars.</p>
<p>They themselves, like you kind of have to score an A minus or better on the planet formation</p>
<p>test to become a solar system analog, even in that basic sense.</p>
<p>And moreover, you know, lower mass stars, which are very numerous in the galaxy, so</p>
<p>called M dwarfs, think like 0% of them, well, maybe like a negligible fraction of them have</p>
<p>giant planets.</p>
<p>Giant planets are a rare, you know, outcome of planet formation.</p>
<p>One of the really big problems that remain unanswered is why.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t actually understand why they&rsquo;re so rare.</p>
<p>How hard is it to simulate all of the things that we&rsquo;ve been talking about, each of the</p>
<p>things we&rsquo;ve been talking about, and maybe one day, all of the things we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about and beyond.</p>
<p>I mean, like from the initial primordial solar system, you know, a bunch of disks with, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, billions, trillions of objects in them, like simulate that such that you</p>
<p>eventually get a Jupiter and a Saturn, and then eventually you get the Jupiter and the</p>
<p>Saturn that clear out a disk, change the gravitational landscape, then Earth pops up, like that whole</p>
<p>thing, and then be able to do that for every other system in the, every other star in the</p>
<p>galaxy, and then be able to do that for other galaxies as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, look.</p>
<p>Maybe start from the smallest simulation, like what is actually being done today.</p>
<p>I mean, even the smallest simulation is probably super, super difficult.</p>
<p>Even just like one object in the Kuiper belt is probably super difficult to simulate.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s super easy.</p>
<p>I mean, like, it&rsquo;s just not that hard.</p>
<p>But you know, let&rsquo;s ask the most kind of basic problem, okay?</p>
<p>So the problem of having a star and something in orbit of it, that you don&rsquo;t need a simulation</p>
<p>for, like you can just write that down on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gravity, like yeah, I guess it&rsquo;s important to try to, you know, one way to simulate objects</p>
<p>in our solar system is to build the universe from scratch.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll get to building the universe from scratch in a sec.</p>
<p>But let me just kind of go through the hierarchy of what, you know, what we do.</p>
<p>Two objects.</p>
<p>Two objects, analytically solvable, like we can figure it out very easily if you just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you, yeah, you don&rsquo;t need to know calculus.</p>
<p>It helps to know calculus, but you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to know calculus.</p>
<p>Three objects that are gravitationally interacting, the solution is chaotic.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter how many simulations you do, the answer loses meaning after some time.</p>
<p>I feel like that is a metaphor for dating as well, but go on.</p>
<p>Now look, yeah, so the fact that you go from analytically solvable to unpredictable, you</p>
<p>know, when your simulation goes from two bodies to three bodies should immediately tell you</p>
<p>that the exercise of trying to engineer a calculation where you form the entire solar</p>
<p>system from scratch and hope to have some predictive answer is a futile one, right?</p>
<p>We will never succeed at such a simulation.</p>
<p>I feel like, just to clarify, you mean like explicitly having a clear equation that generalizes</p>
<p>the whole process enough to be able to make a prediction, or do you mean actually like</p>
<p>literally simulating the objects is a hopeless pursuit once it goes beyond three?</p>
<p>The simulating them is not a hopeless pursuit, but the outcome becomes a statistical one.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s actually quite interesting is I think we have all the equations figured out, right?</p>
<p>You know, in order to really understand this, the formation of the solar system, it suffices</p>
<p>to know gravity and magnetohydrodynamics, I mean, like a combination of Maxwell&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>and Navier Stokes equations for the fluids.</p>
<p>You need to know quantum mechanics to understand the capacities and so on.</p>
<p>But we have those equations in hand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t have that understanding, it&rsquo;s that putting it all together is A, very,</p>
<p>very difficult, and B, if you were to run the same evolution twice, changing, you know,</p>
<p>the initial conditions by some infinitesimal amount, some, you know, minor change in your</p>
<p>calculation to start with, you would get a different answer.</p>
<p>This is one, this is part of the reason why planetary systems are so diverse.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have like a, you know, very predictive path for you start with a disk of this mass</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s around this star, therefore you&rsquo;re going to form the solar system, right?</p>
<p>You start with this and therefore you will conform this huge outcome, huge set of outcomes,</p>
<p>and some percentage of it will resemble the solar system.</p>
<p>You mentioned quantum mechanics and we&rsquo;re talking about cosmic scale objects.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about that the evolution of astrophysical disks can be modeled with Schrodinger&rsquo;s</p>
<p>equation.</p>
<p>I sure did.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Like, how does quantum mechanics become relevant when you consider the evolution of objects</p>
<p>in the solar system?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let me take a step back and just say, like, I remember being, you know, utterly</p>
<p>confused by quantum mechanics when I first learned it.</p>
<p>And the Schrodinger equation, which is kind of the parent equation of that whole field,</p>
<p>you know, seems to come out of nowhere, right?</p>
<p>The way that I was sort of explaining it, I remember asking, you know, my professor</p>
<p>is like, but where does it come from?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, it&rsquo;s just like, don&rsquo;t worry about it and just like calculate the</p>
<p>hydrogen, you know, energy levels, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like I could do all the problems.</p>
<p>I just did not have any intuition for where this parent, you know, super important equation</p>
<p>came from.</p>
<p>Now, down the line, I was, remember, I was preparing for my own lecture and I was trying</p>
<p>to understand how waves travel in self gravitating disks.</p>
<p>So you know, again, there&rsquo;s a very broad theory that&rsquo;s already developed, but I was looking</p>
<p>for some simpler way to explain it really for the purposes of teaching class.</p>
<p>And so I thought, okay, what if I just imagine a disk as an infinite number of concentric</p>
<p>circles, right?</p>
<p>That interact with each other gravitationally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a problem in some sense that I can solve using methods from like the late 1700s.</p>
<p>I can write down Hamiltonian, well, I can write down the energy function basically of</p>
<p>their interactions.</p>
<p>And what I found is that when you take the continuum limit, when you go from discrete</p>
<p>circles that are talking to each other gravitationally to a continuum disk, suddenly this gravitational</p>
<p>interaction among them, right?</p>
<p>The governing equation becomes the Schrodinger equation.</p>
<p>I had to think about that for a little bit.</p>
<p>Did you just unify quantum mechanics and gravity?</p>
<p>No, this is not the same thing as like, you know, fusing relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>But it did get me thinking a little bit.</p>
<p>So the fact that waves in astrophysical disks behave just like wave functions of particles</p>
<p>is kind of like an interesting analogy because for me it&rsquo;s easier to imagine waves traveling</p>
<p>through, you know, astrophysical disks or really just sheets of paper.</p>
<p>And the reason this is, that analogy exists is because there&rsquo;s actually nothing quantum</p>
<p>about the Schrodinger equation.</p>
<p>The Schrodinger equation is just a wave equation and all of the interpretation that comes from</p>
<p>it is quantum, but the equation itself is not a quantum being.</p>
<p>So you can use it to model waves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not turtles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s waves all the way down.</p>
<p>You can pick which level you pick the wave at.</p>
<p>So it could be at the solar system level that you can use it.</p>
<p>And also it actually provides a pretty neat calculational tool because it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>So we just talked about simulations, but it&rsquo;s difficult to simulate the behavior of astrophysical</p>
<p>disks on timescales that are in between a few orbits and their entire evolution.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s over a timescale of a few orbits, you have, you do a hydrodynamic, you know,</p>
<p>simulation, right?</p>
<p>You do that, basically that&rsquo;s something that you can do on a modern computer on a timescale</p>
<p>of say a week.</p>
<p>When it comes to their evolution over their entire lifetime, you don&rsquo;t hope to resolve</p>
<p>the orbits.</p>
<p>You just kind of hope to understand how the system behaves in between, right?</p>
<p>To get access to that, as it turns out, it&rsquo;s pretty, it&rsquo;s pretty cute.</p>
<p>You can use, you can use the Schrodinger equation to get the answer rapidly, so it&rsquo;s a calculational</p>
<p>tool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So astrophysical disks, how, what are they?</p>
<p>How broad is this definition?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So astrophysical disks span a huge, huge amount of ranges.</p>
<p>They start maybe at the smallest scale.</p>
<p>They start with actually Kuiper belt objects.</p>
<p>Some Kuiper belt objects have rings.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s maybe the smallest example of an astrophysical disk.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this little potato shaped asteroid, you know, which is, you know, sort of the</p>
<p>size of LA or something, and around it are some rings of icy matter.</p>
<p>That object is a small astrophysical disk.</p>
<p>Then you have Saturn, the rings of Saturn.</p>
<p>You have the next set of scale, you have the solar system itself when it was forming, you</p>
<p>have a disk.</p>
<p>Then you have black hole disks.</p>
<p>You have galaxies.</p>
<p>Disks are super common in the universe.</p>
<p>The reason is that stuff rotates, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, and those rings could be the material that composes those rings could be, it could</p>
<p>be gas, it could be solid, it could be anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So, the disk that made from which the planets emerged was predominantly hydrogen, helium,</p>
<p>gas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the rings of Saturn are made up of, you know, icicle, ice, little</p>
<p>like ice cubes this big, about a centimeter across.</p>
<p>Sounds refreshing.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Hydrogen, helium, gas.</p>
<p>So, in the beginning, it was just hydrogen and helium around the sun.</p>
<p>How does that lead to the first formations of solid objects in terms of simulation?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re like, have you ever been to the desert?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to the Death Valley and actually it was terrifying, just a total tangent, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>distracting you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But I was driving through it and I was really surprised because it was, at first, hot.</p>
<p>And then as it was getting into the evening, there&rsquo;s this huge thunderstorm, like it was</p>
<p>raining and it got freezing cold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what the hell?</p>
<p>It was the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I had to like just sit there listening to Bruce Springsteen, I remember, and just thinking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to die and I was okay with it because Bruce Springsteen was on the radio.</p>
<p>But look, when you&rsquo;ve got the boss, you&rsquo;re ready to meet the boss.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, look, I mean.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry.</p>
<p>That does, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, to continue on this tangent, I absolutely love the Southwest for this reason.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, I drove from LA to New Mexico a bunch of times.</p>
<p>The madness of weather?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The chaos.</p>
<p>The madness of weather, the fact that it will be blazing hot one minute and then it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like, we&rsquo;ll decide to have a little thunderstorm, maybe we&rsquo;ll decide to go back momentarily</p>
<p>to like a thousand degrees and then go back to the thunderstorm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, by the way, is chaos theory in action.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s get back to talking about the desert.</p>
<p>So, in the desert, tumbleweeds have a tendency to roll because the wind rolls them.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re careful, you&rsquo;ll occasionally see this family of tumbleweeds where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a big one and then a bunch of little ones that kind of hide in its wake and are</p>
<p>all rolling together and almost looks like a family of ducks crossing the street or something.</p>
<p>Or for example, if you watch Tour de France, you&rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of cyclists and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like cycling within 10 centimeters of each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not BFFs, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not trying to be, trying to ride together.</p>
<p>They are riding together to minimize the collective air resistance, if you will, that they experience.</p>
<p>Turns out solids in the protoplanetary disk do just this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an instability wherein solid particles, things that are a centimeter across will start</p>
<p>to hide behind one another and form these clouds.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because cumulatively, that minimizes the solid component of this aerodynamic interaction</p>
<p>with the gas.</p>
<p>Now, these clouds, because they&rsquo;re kind of a favorable energetic condition for the dust</p>
<p>to live in, they grow, grow, grow, grow, grow until they become so massive that they collapse</p>
<p>under their own weight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the first building blocks of planets form.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the big asteroids got there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that, is that simulatable or is it not useful to simulate?</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s simulatable.</p>
<p>And people do these types of calculations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually, that&rsquo;s one of the many fields of planet formation theory that is really,</p>
<p>really active right now.</p>
<p>People are trying to understand all kinds of aspects of that process because of course</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve explained it, you know, like as if there&rsquo;s one thing that happens.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s a beautifully rich dynamic, but qualitatively, formation of the first</p>
<p>building blocks actually follows the same sequence as formation of stars, right?</p>
<p>Stars are just clouds of gas, hydrogen, helium, gas that sit in space and slowly cool.</p>
<p>And at some point they, you know, contract to a point where their gravity overtakes the</p>
<p>thermal pressure support, if you will.</p>
<p>And they collapse under their own weight and you get a little baby solar system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So do you think one day it will be possible to simulate the full history that took our</p>
<p>solar system to what it is today?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it will be useless.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think your story, many of the ideas that you have about Jupiter clear in</p>
<p>the space, like retelling that story in high resolution is not that important.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s important, but at every stage you have to design your experiments,</p>
<p>your numerical computer experiments so that they test some specific aspect of that evolution.</p>
<p>I am not a proponent of doing huge simulations because even if we forget the information</p>
<p>theory aspect of not being able to simulate in full detail the universe, because if you</p>
<p>do, then you have made an actual universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the simulation, right?</p>
<p>Simulation is in some sense a compression of information.</p>
<p>So therefore you must lose detail.</p>
<p>But that point aside, if we are able to simulate the entire history of the solar system in</p>
<p>excruciating detail, I mean, it&rsquo;ll be cool, but it&rsquo;s not going to be any different from</p>
<p>observing it, right?</p>
<p>Because theoretical understanding, which is what ultimately I&rsquo;m interested in, comes from</p>
<p>taking complex things and reducing them down to something that, you know, some mechanism</p>
<p>that you can actually quantify.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fun part of astrophysics, just kind of simulating things in extreme detail</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ll make cool visualizations, but that doesn&rsquo;t get you to any better understanding</p>
<p>than you had before you did the simulation.</p>
<p>So if you ask very specific questions, then you&rsquo;ll be able to create like very highly</p>
<p>compressed, nice, beautiful theories about how things evolved, and then you can use those</p>
<p>to then generalize to other solar systems, to other stars and other galaxies, and then</p>
<p>say something generalizable about the entire universe.</p>
<p>How difficult would it be to simulate our solar system such that we would not know the</p>
<p>difference?</p>
<p>Meaning, if we are living in a simulation, is there a nice, think of it as a video game,</p>
<p>is there a nice compressible way of doing that, or just kind of like you intuited with</p>
<p>a three body situation is just a giant mess that you cannot create a video game that will</p>
<p>seem realistic without actually building your solar system from scratch?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speculating, but one of the, yeah, I know you have a deep understanding of this, but</p>
<p>for me, I&rsquo;m just going to speculate that for at least in the types of simulations that</p>
<p>we can do today, inevitably, you run into the problem of resolution, right?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what you&rsquo;re doing, it is discrete.</p>
<p>Now, the way you would go about asking, you know, what we&rsquo;re observing, is that a simulation</p>
<p>or is that, you know, some real continuous thing, is you zoom in, right?</p>
<p>You zoom in and try and find the, you know, the grid scale, if you will.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a really interesting question, and because the solar system itself and really,</p>
<p>you know, the double pendulum is chaotic, right?</p>
<p>From sitting on another pendulum, it moves unpredictably once you let them go.</p>
<p>You really don&rsquo;t need to, like, inject any randomness into a simulation for it to give</p>
<p>you stochastic and unpredictable answers.</p>
<p>Weather is a great example of this.</p>
<p>Weather has a lapen of time of, you know, typical weather systems have a lapen of time</p>
<p>of a few days.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a fundamental reason why the force forecast always sucks, you know, two weeks</p>
<p>in advance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t know the equations that govern the atmosphere, we know them well.</p>
<p>Their solutions are meaningless, though, after a few days.</p>
<p>The zooming in thing is very interesting.</p>
<p>I think about this a lot, whether there&rsquo;ll be a time soon where we would want to stay</p>
<p>in video game worlds, whether it&rsquo;s virtual reality or just playing video games.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that time, like, came in, like, the 90s, and it&rsquo;s been that time.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not just came, I mean, it&rsquo;s accelerated.</p>
<p>I just recently saw that WoW and Fortnite were played 140 billion hours, and those are</p>
<p>just video games.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, like, increasing very, very quickly, especially with the people coming up now,</p>
<p>being born now and become, you know, becoming teenagers and so on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a thought experiment where it&rsquo;s just you and a video game character inside</p>
<p>a room, where you remove the simulation, they need to simulate sort of a lot of objects.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just you and that character, how far do you need to simulate in terms of zooming</p>
<p>in for it to be very real to you, as real as reality?</p>
<p>So like, first of all, you kind of mentioned zooming in, which is fascinating, because</p>
<p>we have these tools of science that allow us to zoom in, quote unquote, in all kinds</p>
<p>of ways in the world around us.</p>
<p>But our cognitive abilities, like our perception system as humans, is very limited in terms</p>
<p>of zooming in.</p>
<p>So we might be very easily fooled.</p>
<p>Some of the video games, like, on the PS4, like, look pretty real to me, right?</p>
<p>I think, you know, you would really have to interrogate, I mean, I think even with what</p>
<p>we have today, like, I don&rsquo;t know, Ace Combat 7 is a great example, right?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, the way that the clouds are rendered, it&rsquo;s, I mean, it looks just like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re flying, you know, on a real airplane, the kind of transparency.</p>
<p>I think that the, you know, our perception is limited enough already to not be able to</p>
<p>tell some of the, you know, some of the differences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a game called Skyrim.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an Elder Scrolls role playing game.</p>
<p>And I just, I played it for quite a bit.</p>
<p>And I think I played it very different than others.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;ll be long stretches of time where I would just walk around and look at nature</p>
<p>in the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the graphics is like, wow, I want to stay there.</p>
<p>It was better.</p>
<p>I went hiking recently.</p>
<p>It was like as good as hiking.</p>
<p>So look, I know what you mean.</p>
<p>Not to go on a huge video game, you know, tangent, but like the third, like, Witcher</p>
<p>game was astonishingly beautiful, right?</p>
<p>Especially like playing on a good hardware machine, it&rsquo;s like, this is pretty, this is</p>
<p>pretty legit.</p>
<p>That said, um, you know, I, I don&rsquo;t resonate with the, I want to stay here, you know, like</p>
<p>one of the things that I love to do is to go to my like boxing gym and, and box with</p>
<p>a guy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s nothing quite like that physical, you know, experience.</p>
<p>Like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That might be simply an artifact of the year you were born maybe because if you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>today, it almost seems like stupid to go to a gym, like you&rsquo;re going to a gym to box with</p>
<p>a guy.</p>
<p>Why not box with Mike Tyson when you yourself is like in his prime, when you yourself are</p>
<p>also an incredible boxer in the video game world.</p>
<p>For me, there, there&rsquo;s a multitude of reasons why I don&rsquo;t want to box with Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I enjoy teeth, you know, and I want to have an ear.</p>
<p>No, but your, your skills in this meat space, in this physical realm is very limited and</p>
<p>takes a lot of work and you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re a musician, you&rsquo;re an incredible scientist.</p>
<p>You only have so much time in the, in the day, but in the video game world, you can</p>
<p>expand your capabilities and all kinds of dimensions that you can never have possibly</p>
<p>have time in the physical world.</p>
<p>And so that, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense like to, to be existing, to be working your ass off</p>
<p>in the physical world when you can just be super successful in the video game world.</p>
<p>But I still, you enjoy sucking and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really struggling to get better.</p>
<p>I sure do.</p>
<p>I mean, I think like these days with music, music is a great example, right?</p>
<p>We just started, you know, practicing live with my band again, you know, after not playing</p>
<p>for a year and you know, it&rsquo;s just, it was terrible.</p>
<p>Like it was just kind of a lot of the nuance, you know, a lot of the detail is just that</p>
<p>detail that takes, you know, years of collective practice to develop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just lost, but it was just an incredible amount of fun, way more fun than all the like</p>
<p>studio, you know, sitting around and playing that I did, you know, throughout the entire</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s something, there&rsquo;s something intangible or maybe, maybe tangible about</p>
<p>being, being in person.</p>
<p>I sure hope you&rsquo;re wrong and that, you know, we, that&rsquo;s not something that will get lost</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s like such a large part of the human condition is to hang out.</p>
<p>If we were doing this interview on zoom, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d already be, I&rsquo;d already be bored out of my mind.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m almost playing devil&rsquo;s advocate, but at the same time, you know, I&rsquo;m sure people</p>
<p>talk about the same way at the beginning of the 20th century about horses, where they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they are much more efficient, they&rsquo;re much easier to maintain than cars.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have, you know, all the ways that cars break down and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not enough infrastructure in terms of roads for cars.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Like horses and like nature, you could do the nature, like where, you know, you should</p>
<p>be living more natural life.</p>
<p>Horses are real.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want machines in your life that are going to pollute your mind and the minds</p>
<p>of young people, but then eventually just cars took over.</p>
<p>So in that same way, it just seems, going back to horses, I&rsquo;m just, you know, well,</p>
<p>you can be, you can play, what is it?</p>
<p>Red dead, red dead redemption, redemption, and that you can ride horses in the video</p>
<p>game world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So let me return us back to planet nine.</p>
<p>Always a good place to come back to.</p>
<p>So now that we did a big historical overview of our solar system, what is planet nine?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Planet nine is a hypothetical object that orbits the solar system, right?</p>
<p>On orbital period of about 10,000 years and an orbit, which is slightly tilted with respect</p>
<p>to the plane of the solar system, slightly eccentric and the object itself we think is</p>
<p>five times more massive than the earth.</p>
<p>We have never seen planet nine in a telescope, but we have gravitational evidence for it.</p>
<p>And so this is where all the stuff we&rsquo;ve been talking about, this clustering ideas, maybe</p>
<p>you can speak to the approximate location that we suspect.</p>
<p>And also the question I wanted to ask is what are we supposed to be imagining here?</p>
<p>Because you said there are certain objects in the Kuiper Belt that are kind of have a</p>
<p>direction to them that they&rsquo;re all like flocking in some kind of way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the sense that there&rsquo;s some kind of gravitational object, not changing their</p>
<p>orbit, but kind of confining them, like grouping their orbits together.</p>
<p>See, what would happen if planet nine were not there is these orbits that roughly share</p>
<p>a common orientation, they would just disperse, right?</p>
<p>They would just become as a mutually symmetric point everywhere.</p>
<p>Planet nine&rsquo;s gravity makes it such that these objects stay in a state that&rsquo;s basically anti</p>
<p>aligned with respect to the orbit of planet nine and sort of hang out there and kind of</p>
<p>oscillate on a timescale of about a billion years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the lines of evidence for the existence of planet nine.</p>
<p>There are others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s easiest to maybe visualize just because it&rsquo;s fun to think about orbits</p>
<p>that all point into the same direction, but I should, you know, emphasize that, for example,</p>
<p>the existence of objects, again, Kuiper Belt objects that are heavily out of the plane</p>
<p>of the solar system, things that are tilted by say 90 degrees, that&rsquo;s not, we don&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>that as an outcome of planet formation.</p>
<p>Indeed, planet formation simulations have never produced such objects without some extrinsic</p>
<p>gravitational force.</p>
<p>Planet nine, on the other hand, generates them very readily, so that provides kind of</p>
<p>an alternative, you know, population of small bodies in the solar system that also get produced</p>
<p>by planet nine through an independent kind of gravitational effect.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of, there&rsquo;s basically five different things that planet nine does individually</p>
<p>that are like kind of maybe a one sigma effect where you&rsquo;d say, yeah, okay, if that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>it was, maybe it&rsquo;s not, no reason to jump up and down, but because it&rsquo;s a multitude</p>
<p>of these puzzles that all are explained by one hypothesis, that&rsquo;s really the magnetism,</p>
<p>the attraction of the planet nine model.</p>
<p>So can you just clarify, so most orbit, most planets in the solar system orbit at approximately</p>
<p>the same, so it&rsquo;s flat.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like one degree.</p>
<p>The difference between them is about one degree.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, if we looked at our solar system, it would look, and I could see every</p>
<p>single object, it would look like a sphere.</p>
<p>The inner part where the planets are would look like, you know, flat, right?</p>
<p>The Kuiper belt and the asteroid belt have a larger, it gets fatter and fatter and fatter</p>
<p>and becomes a sphere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And if you look at the very outside, it&rsquo;s polluted by this quasi spheroidal thing.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s of course ever seen the Oort cloud, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only seen comments that come from the Oort cloud so that the Oort cloud, which is</p>
<p>this, right, population of distant debris, its existence is also inferred.</p>
<p>You could say alternatively, there is, you know, there&rsquo;s a big cosmic creature that occasionally,</p>
<p>you know, sitting at 20,000 AU and occasionally throws an icy rock towards the sun like that.</p>
<p>Spaghetti monster, I think it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, so it&rsquo;s a mystery in many ways, but you can kind of infer a bunch of things about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And by the way, both terrifying and exciting that there&rsquo;s this vast darkness all around</p>
<p>us that&rsquo;s full of objects that they&rsquo;re just throwing.</p>
<p>Just there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of astonishing, right, that we have only explored a small fraction</p>
<p>of the solar system, right?</p>
<p>That really kind of baffles me because I remember as a student, you know, studying physics,</p>
<p>you know, you do the problem where you put the earth around the sun, you solve that and</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s one line of math and you say, okay, well, that surely was figured out by Newton.</p>
<p>So like all the interesting stuff is not in the solar system, but that it&rsquo;s just plainly</p>
<p>not true.</p>
<p>There are mysteries in the solar system that are remarkable that we are only now starting</p>
<p>to just kind of scratch the surface of.</p>
<p>And some of those objects probably have some information about the history of our solar</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Like a great example is, you know, small meteorites, right?</p>
<p>Small meteorites are melted, right?</p>
<p>They have, they&rsquo;re differentiated, meaning some of the iron sinks, you say, well, how</p>
<p>can that be?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re so small that they wouldn&rsquo;t have melted just from the heat of their accretion.</p>
<p>Turns out the fact that the solar nebula, the disk that made the planets was polluted</p>
<p>by aluminum 26 is in itself a remarkable thing.</p>
<p>It means the solar system did not form in isolation.</p>
<p>It formed in a giant cloud of thousands of other stars that were also forming, some of</p>
<p>which were undergoing, you know, going through supernova explosions, some of, and releasing</p>
<p>these unstable isotopes that, of which we now see kind of the traces of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that life from other solar systems was injected and that</p>
<p>was what was the origin of life on Earth?</p>
<p>Yeah, the Panspermia idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s seen as a low probability event by people who studied the origin of life, but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because then they would be out of a job.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be out of the job because you just then say, you have to figure</p>
<p>out how life started there.</p>
<p>But then you have to go there.</p>
<p>We can study life on Earth much easier.</p>
<p>We could study it in the lab much easier because we can replicate conditions there from an</p>
<p>early Earth much easier from a chemistry perspective, from a biology perspective.</p>
<p>You can intuit a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>You can look at different parts of Earth and just.</p>
<p>To an extent, I mean, the early Earth was completely unlike the current Earth, right?</p>
<p>There was no oxygen.</p>
<p>So one of my colleagues at Caltech, Joe Kirshnik, is certain, something like 100% certainty</p>
<p>that life started on Mars and came to Earth on Martian meteorites.</p>
<p>This is not a problem that I like to kind of think about too much, like the origin of</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating problem, but you know, it&rsquo;s not physics and I just like, I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same reason you don&rsquo;t love, I thought you&rsquo;re a musician, so music is not physics</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>So why are you so into it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% physics.</p>
<p>No, no, look, in all seriousness though, there are a few things that I really, really enjoy.</p>
<p>I genuinely enjoy physics.</p>
<p>I genuinely enjoy music.</p>
<p>I genuinely, you know, enjoy martial arts and I genuinely enjoy my family.</p>
<p>I should have said that all in a reverse order or something, but I like to focus on these</p>
<p>things and not worry too much about everything else.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Just because there is a, like you said earlier, there&rsquo;s a time constraint.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do it all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many mysteries all around us.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all beautiful in different ways.</p>
<p>To me, that thing I love is artificial intelligence that perhaps I love it because eventually</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to suck up to our future overlords.</p>
<p>The question of, you said there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of little pieces of evidence for this</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s Planet Nine.</p>
<p>If we were to try to collect more evidence or be certain, like a paper that says, like</p>
<p>you drop it, clear, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>What does that require?</p>
<p>Are sending probes out or do you think we can do it from telescopes here on earth?</p>
<p>What are the different ideas for conclusive evidence for Planet Nine?</p>
<p>The moment Planet Nine gets imaged from a telescope on earth, it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just there.</p>
<p>Can you clarify it?</p>
<p>Cause you mentioned that before from an image, would you be able to tell?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So from an image, the moment you see something, something that is reflecting sunlight back</p>
<p>at you and you know that it&rsquo;s hundreds of times as far away from the sun as the earth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking, so basically if you have a really far away thing that&rsquo;s big, five times</p>
<p>the size of earth, that means that is Planet Nine.</p>
<p>Could there be multiple objects like that?</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>In principle, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no law of physics that doesn&rsquo;t allow you to have multiple, there&rsquo;s also no</p>
<p>evidence at present for there being multiple.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible, just like we&rsquo;re finding exoplanets, whether given the size</p>
<p>of the Oort Cloud, there&rsquo;s basically, it&rsquo;s rarer and rarer, but there are sprinkled Planet</p>
<p>Nine, 10, 11, 12, like these, some.</p>
<p>Got 13.</p>
<p>It goes after that.</p>
<p>I can just keep counting.</p>
<p>So just something about the dynamic system, it becomes lower and lower probability event,</p>
<p>but they gather up, they become larger and larger maybe, something like that.</p>
<p>I wonder if discovering Planet Nine will just be almost like a springboard, it&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s beyond that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely plausible.</p>
<p>The Oort Cloud itself probably holds about five earth masses or seven earth masses of</p>
<p>material.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s not nothing.</p>
<p>And it all ultimately comes down to at what point will the observational surveys sample</p>
<p>enough of the solar system to kind of reveal interesting things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great analogy here with Neptune and the story of how Neptune was discovered.</p>
<p>Neptune was not discovered by looking at the sky, right?</p>
<p>It was discovered mathematically, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, the orbit of Uranus, when Uranus was found, this was 1781, both the tracking</p>
<p>of the orbit of Uranus as well as the reconstruction of the orbit of Uranus immediately revealed</p>
<p>that it was not following the orbit that it was supposed to, right?</p>
<p>The predicted orbit deviated away from where it actually was.</p>
<p>So in the mid 1800s, right, a French mathematician by the name of Orban Le Verrier did a beautifully</p>
<p>sophisticated calculation which said if this is due to gravity of a more distant planet,</p>
<p>then that planet is there, okay?</p>
<p>And then they found it.</p>
<p>But the point is the understanding of where to look for Neptune came entirely out of celestial</p>
<p>mechanics.</p>
<p>The case with Planet Nine is a little bit different because what we can do I think relatively</p>
<p>well is predict the orbit and mass of Planet Nine.</p>
<p>We cannot tell you where it is on its orbit.</p>
<p>The reason is we haven&rsquo;t seen the Kuiper Belt objects complete an orbit, their own orbit,</p>
<p>even once because it takes 4,000 years.</p>
<p>But I plan to live on as an AI being, and I&rsquo;ll be tracking those orbits as, you know,</p>
<p>for‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So it takes 4,000 or 5,000 years.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be AI.</p>
<p>It could be longevity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of really exciting genetic engineering research.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll just be a brain waiting for the, your brain waiting for the orbit to complete</p>
<p>for the basic Kuiper Belt objects.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like kind of the worst reason to want to live a long time, right, just like can</p>
<p>the brain like smoke a cigarette?</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>Can you just like light one up while you&rsquo;re waiting or?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re making me actually realize that the one way to explore the galaxy is by just</p>
<p>sitting here on Earth and waiting.</p>
<p>So if we can just get really good at waiting, it&rsquo;s like a mua mua or these interstellar</p>
<p>objects that fly in, you can just wait for them to come to you.</p>
<p>Same with the aliens.</p>
<p>You can wait for them to come to you.</p>
<p>If you get really good at waiting, then that&rsquo;s one way to do the exploration because eventually</p>
<p>the thing will come to you.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the, maybe the intelligent alien civilizations get much better at waiting,</p>
<p>and so they all decide, so game theoretically, to start waiting, and it&rsquo;s just a bunch of</p>
<p>like ancient intelligent civilizations of aliens all throughout the universe, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just sitting there waiting for each other.</p>
<p>Look, you can&rsquo;t just be good at waiting.</p>
<p>You gotta know how to chill, okay?</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t just like sit around and do nothing.</p>
<p>You gotta be, you gotta know how to chill.</p>
<p>I honestly think that as we progress, if the aliens are anything like us, we enjoy loving</p>
<p>things we do, and it&rsquo;s very possible that we just figure out mechanisms here on Earth</p>
<p>to enjoy our life, and we just stay here on Earth forever, that exploration becomes less</p>
<p>and less of an interesting thing to do, and so you basically, yes, wait and chill.</p>
<p>You get really optimally good at chilling, and thereby exploring is not that interesting,</p>
<p>so in terms of 4,000 years, it would be nothing for scientists.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be chilling and just all kinds of scientific explorations will become possible because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just be here on Earth.</p>
<p>So chill.</p>
<p>You have a paper out recently, because you already mentioned some of these ideas, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love it if you could dig into it a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>The injection of inner Oort Cloud objects into the distant Kuiper Belt by Planet Nine.</p>
<p>What is this idea of Planet Nine injecting objects into the Kuiper Belt?</p>
<p>Okay, let me take a brief step back, and when we do calculations of Planet Nine, when we</p>
<p>do the simulations, as far as our simulations are concerned, sort of the Neptune, like kind</p>
<p>of the transneptunian solar system is entirely sourced from the inside, namely the Kuiper</p>
<p>Belt gets scattered by Neptune, and then Planet Nine does things to it and aligns the orbits</p>
<p>and so on, and then we calculate what happens on the lifetime of the solar system, yada,</p>
<p>yada, yada.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, one of the kind of questions we asked ourselves, and this is indeed something</p>
<p>we, Mike and I, Mike Brown, who&rsquo;s a partner in crime on this, and I do regularly, is we</p>
<p>say how can we A, disprove ourselves, and B, how can we improve our simulations?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s missing?</p>
<p>One idea that maybe should have been obvious in retrospect is that all of our simulations</p>
<p>treated the solar system as some isolated creature, right?</p>
<p>But the solar system did not form in isolation, right?</p>
<p>It formed in this cluster of stars, and during that phase of forming together with thousands</p>
<p>of other stars, we believe the solar system formed this almost spherical population of</p>
<p>icy debris that sits maybe at a few thousand times the separation between the Earth and</p>
<p>the Sun, maybe even a little bit closer.</p>
<p>If Planet Nine&rsquo;s not there, that population is completely dormant, and these objects just</p>
<p>slowly orbit the Sun.</p>
<p>Nothing interesting happens to them ever, but when we realize that if Planet Nine is</p>
<p>there, Planet Nine can actually grab some of those objects and gravitationally reinject</p>
<p>them into the distant solar system.</p>
<p>So we thought, okay, let&rsquo;s look into this with numerical experiments.</p>
<p>Do our simulations, does this process work, and if it works, what are its consequences?</p>
<p>So it turns out, indeed, not only does Planet Nine inject these distant inner Oort cloud</p>
<p>objects into the Kuiper Belt, they follow roughly the same pathway as the objects that</p>
<p>are being scattered out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of river, two way river of material.</p>
<p>Some of it is coming out by Neptune scattering, some of it is moving in.</p>
<p>And if you work through the numbers, you kind of, at the end of the day, it has an effect</p>
<p>on the best fit orbit for Planet Nine itself.</p>
<p>So if you realize that the data set that we&rsquo;re observing is not entirely composed of things</p>
<p>that came out of the solar system, but also things that got reinjected back in, then turns</p>
<p>out the best fit Planet Nine is slightly more eccentric.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of getting into the weeds.</p>
<p>The point here is that the existence of Planet Nine itself provides this natural bridge that</p>
<p>connects an otherwise dormant population of icy debris of the solar system with things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re starting to directly observe.</p>
<p>So it can flow back, so it&rsquo;s not just a river flowing one way, it&rsquo;s maybe a smaller stream</p>
<p>going back.</p>
<p>Backwash.</p>
<p>You want a backwash, you want to incorporate that into the simulations, into your understanding</p>
<p>of those distant objects when you&rsquo;re trying to make sense of the various observations</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you, some people think that many of the observations that you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>could be described by a primordial black hole.</p>
<p>First, what is a primordial black hole and what do you think about this idea?</p>
<p>So primordial black hole is a black hole which is made not through the usual pathway of making</p>
<p>a black hole, which is that you have a star, which is more massive than 1.4 or so solar</p>
<p>masses and basically when it runs out of fuel, runs out of its nuclear fusion fuel, it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hold itself up anymore and just the whole thing collapses on itself, right?</p>
<p>You create a, I mean one, I guess, simple way to think about it is you create an object</p>
<p>with zero radius, that has mass but zero radius, that singularity.</p>
<p>Now such black holes exist all over the place.</p>
<p>In the galaxy, there&rsquo;s in fact a really big one at the center of the galaxy that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that one&rsquo;s always looking at you when you&rsquo;re not looking, okay, and it&rsquo;s always talking</p>
<p>about you.</p>
<p>And when you turn off the lights, it wakes up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So such black holes are all over the place.</p>
<p>When they merge, we get to see incredible gravitational waves that they emit, etc, etc.</p>
<p>One kind of plausible scenario, however, is that when the universe was forming, basically</p>
<p>during the Big Bang, you created a whole spectrum of black holes, some with masses of five Earth</p>
<p>masses, some with masses of 10 Earth masses, like the entire, you know, mass spectrum size,</p>
<p>some the massive asteroids.</p>
<p>Now on the smaller end, over the lifetime of the universe, the smaller ones kind of</p>
<p>evaporate and they&rsquo;re not there anymore.</p>
<p>At least this is what we, what the calculations tell us.</p>
<p>But five Earth masses is big enough to not have evaporated.</p>
<p>So one idea is that Planet Nine is not a planet and instead it is a five Earth mass black</p>
<p>hole.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard to find.</p>
<p>Now can we right away from our calculations say that&rsquo;s definitely true or that&rsquo;s not true?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t, in fact, our calculations tell you nothing other than the orbit and the mass.</p>
<p>And that means the black hole, I mean, it could be a five Earth mass, you know, cup.</p>
<p>It could be a five Earth mass hedgehog or a black hole or really anything that&rsquo;s five</p>
<p>Earth masses will do because the gravity of a black hole is no different than the gravity</p>
<p>of a planet, right?</p>
<p>If the sun became a black hole tomorrow, it would be dark, but the Earth would keep orbiting</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And like this notion that, oh, black holes suck everything in, it&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a sci fi notion.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just mass.</p>
<p>What would be the difference between a black hole and a planet in terms of observationally?</p>
<p>Probably the difference would be that you will never find the black hole, right?</p>
<p>The truth is they&rsquo;re kind of, I&rsquo;m actually not, you know, I never looked into this very</p>
<p>carefully, but there are some constraints that you can get just statistically and say,</p>
<p>okay, if the sun has a binary companion, which is a five Earth mass black hole, then that</p>
<p>means such black holes would be extremely common and, you know, you can sort of look</p>
<p>for lensing events and then you say, okay, maybe that&rsquo;s not so likely.</p>
<p>But you know, that said, I want to emphasize that there&rsquo;s a limit to what our calculations</p>
<p>can tell you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the orbit and the mass.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a bunch, like Ed Witten, I think wishes it&rsquo;s a black hole because I</p>
<p>think one exciting things about black holes in our solar system is that we could go there</p>
<p>and we can maybe study the singularity somehow because that allows us to understand some</p>
<p>fundamental things about physics.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a planet, so planet nine, we may not, you know, and we go there, we may not discover</p>
<p>anything profoundly new.</p>
<p>The interesting thing, perhaps you can correct me about planet nine is like the big picture</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>The whole big story of the Kuiper belt and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that planet nine would be somehow fundamentally different from, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Neptune in terms of, in terms of the kind of things we could learn from it.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s kind of a hope that it&rsquo;s a black hole because it&rsquo;s an entirely</p>
<p>new kind of object.</p>
<p>Maybe you can correct me on that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, of course here, my own biases creep in because I&rsquo;m interested, you know, in planets</p>
<p>around other stars.</p>
<p>And I would say, I would disagree that, you know, we wouldn&rsquo;t find things that would be</p>
<p>truly, you know, fundamentally new because as it turns out, the galaxy is really good</p>
<p>at making five or three earth mass objects, right?</p>
<p>The most common type of planet that we see, that we, you know, discover orbiting around</p>
<p>other stars is a few earth masses.</p>
<p>In the solar system, there&rsquo;s no analog for that, right?</p>
<p>We go from one earth mass object, which is this one and to skipping to Neptune and Uranus,</p>
<p>which themselves are actually relatively poorly understood, especially Uranus from the interior</p>
<p>structure point of view.</p>
<p>If planet nine is a planet, going there will give us the closest window into understanding</p>
<p>what other planets look like.</p>
<p>And I will, you know, I&rsquo;ll say this, that, you know, planets kind of in terms of their</p>
<p>complexity on some logarithmic scale fall somewhere between a star and an insect, right?</p>
<p>An insect is way more complicated than a star, right?</p>
<p>Just all kinds of physical processes and really biochemical processes that occur inside of</p>
<p>an insect that just make a star look like, you know, somebody is like playing with a</p>
<p>spring or something, right?</p>
<p>So the, I think, you know, it would be, you know, arguably, you know, more interesting</p>
<p>to go to, you know, to go to planet nine if it&rsquo;s a planet, because black holes are simple.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just kind of, they&rsquo;re basically macroscopic like particles, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so just like a star that you mentioned in terms of complexity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that planet nine is supposed to being like homogeneous is like super like</p>
<p>heterogeneous is a bunch of cool stuff going on that could give us an intuition.</p>
<p>I never thought about that, that it&rsquo;s basically Earth number two in terms of size and gives</p>
<p>us, starts giving us intuition that could be generalizable to Earth like planets elsewhere</p>
<p>in the galaxy.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, Pluto is also in the sense like, you know, Pluto is a tiny, tiny thing, right?</p>
<p>Just like you would imagine that it&rsquo;s just a tiny ball of ice, like who cares, but the</p>
<p>New Horizons images of Pluto reveal so much remarkable structure, right?</p>
<p>They reveal glaciers flowing and these are glaciers not made out of water ice, but you</p>
<p>know, CO ice, it turns out at those temperatures, right, of like 40 or so Kelvin, water ice</p>
<p>looks like metal, right?</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t flow at all, but then ice made up of carbon monoxide starts to flow.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just like all kinds of really cool phenomena that you otherwise just wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really even imagine that occur.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a reason why I like planets.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you, I find as I read the idea that Ed Witten was thinking about this</p>
<p>kind of stuff fascinating.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a mathematical physicist who&rsquo;s very interested in string theory, won the Fields</p>
<p>Medal for his work in mathematics.</p>
<p>So I read that he proposed a fleet of probes accelerated by radiation pressure that could</p>
<p>discover a Planet Nine primordial black holes location.</p>
<p>What do you think about this idea of sending a bunch of probes out there?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, the way the idea is a cool one, right?</p>
<p>You go and you say, you know, launch them basically, isotropically, you track where</p>
<p>they go.</p>
<p>And if I understand the idea correctly, basically measure the deflection and you say, okay,</p>
<p>that must be something there since the probe trajectories are being altered.</p>
<p>Oh, so the measurement, the basic sensory mechanism is the, it&rsquo;s not like you have senses</p>
<p>on the probes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like you&rsquo;re, because you&rsquo;re very precisely able to capture, to measure the</p>
<p>trajectory of the probes, you can then infer the gravitational fields.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the basic idea.</p>
<p>You know, back a few years ago, we had conversations like these with, you know, engineers from</p>
<p>JPL.</p>
<p>They more or less convinced me that this is more, much more difficult than it seems because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t, at that level of precision, right?</p>
<p>Things like solar flares matter, right?</p>
<p>Solar flares, right, are completely chaotic.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t predict which, where a solar flare will happen.</p>
<p>That will drive radiation pressure gradients.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know where every single asteroid is.</p>
<p>So like actually doing that problem, I think it&rsquo;s possible, but it&rsquo;s not a trivial matter,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Well, I wonder, not just about Planet 9, I wonder if that&rsquo;s kind of the future of doing</p>
<p>science in our solar system is to just launch a huge number of probes.</p>
<p>So like a whole order of magnitude, many orders of magnitude, larger numbers of probes, and</p>
<p>then starting for a bunch of different stuff, not just gravity, but everything else.</p>
<p>So in this regard, I actually think there is a huge revolution that&rsquo;s to some extent</p>
<p>already started, right?</p>
<p>The standard kind of like timescale for a NASA mission is that you like propose it and</p>
<p>it launches, I don&rsquo;t know, like 150 years after your proposal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over exaggerating, but you know, it&rsquo;s just like some huge development cycle and</p>
<p>it gets delayed 55 times, like that is not going away, right?</p>
<p>The really cutting edge things, you have to do it this way because you don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building, so to speak.</p>
<p>But the CubeSat kind of world is starting to provide an avenue for like launching something</p>
<p>that costs a few million dollars and has a turnaround timescale of like a couple of years.</p>
<p>You can imagine doing PhD theses where you design the mission, the mission goes to where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going, and you do the science all within a time span of five, six years.</p>
<p>That has not been fully executed on yet, but I absolutely think that&rsquo;s on the horizon and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not talking a decade, I think we&rsquo;re talking like this decade.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the company is accelerating all this with Blue Origin and SpaceX, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a bunch of more CubeSat oriented companies that are pushing this forward.</p>
<p>Well let me ask you on that topic, what do you think about either one?</p>
<p>Elon Musk with SpaceX going to Mars, I think he wants SpaceX to be the first to put a first</p>
<p>human on Mars, and then Jeff Bezos, gotta give him props, wants to be the first to fly</p>
<p>his own rocket out into space.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a guy who like built his rocket out of garbage?</p>
<p>This was like a couple years ago, and somewhere in the desert he launched himself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not tracking this closely, but I think I am familiar with folks who built their own</p>
<p>rocket to try to prove the earth is flat.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the guy I&rsquo;m talking about, he also jumped some limousine.</p>
<p>Truly revolutionary mind, you have to have greater men than either you or I.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been astonishing to watch how really over the last decade the commercial sector</p>
<p>took over this industry that traditionally has really been a government thing to do.</p>
<p>Motivated primarily by the competition between nations, like the Cold War, and now it&rsquo;s motivated</p>
<p>more and more by the natural forces of capitalism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, so here I have many ideas about it.</p>
<p>I think on the one hand, like what SpaceX has been able to do, for example, phenomenal.</p>
<p>If that brings down the price of space exploration, that turnaround time scale for space exploration,</p>
<p>which I think it inevitably will, that&rsquo;s a huge boost to the human condition.</p>
<p>The same time, if we&rsquo;re talking astronomy, it comes at a huge cost, and the Starlink</p>
<p>satellites is a great example of that cost.</p>
<p>In fact, I was just camping in the Mojave with a friend of mine, and they saw this string</p>
<p>of satellites just kind of appear and then disappear into nowhere.</p>
<p>That is beginning to interfere with Earth based observations, so I think there&rsquo;s tremendous</p>
<p>potential there, it&rsquo;s also important to be responsible about how it&rsquo;s executed.</p>
<p>Now with Mars and the whole idea of exploring Mars, I don&rsquo;t have strong opinions on whether</p>
<p>a manned mission is required or not required, but I do think the thing to keep in mind is</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not signed on, if you will, to the idea that Mars is some kind of a safe haven</p>
<p>that we can escape to.</p>
<p>Mars sucks.</p>
<p>Living on Mars, if you want to live on Mars, you can have that experience by going to the</p>
<p>Mojave Desert and camping, and it&rsquo;s just not a great experience.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s interesting, but there&rsquo;s something captivating about that kind of mission of</p>
<p>us striving out into space, and by making Mars in some ways habitable for at least like</p>
<p>months at a time, I think would lead to engineering breakthroughs that would make life in many</p>
<p>ways much better on Earth.</p>
<p>It will come up with ideas we totally don&rsquo;t expect yet, both on the robotics side, on</p>
<p>the food engineering side, on the, maybe we&rsquo;ll switch from, there&rsquo;ll be huge breakthroughs</p>
<p>in insect farming, as exciting as I find that idea to be, in the ways we consume protein.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll revolutionize, we do factory farming, which is full of cruelty and torture of animals,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll revolutionize that completely because of our, we shouldn&rsquo;t need to go to Mars to</p>
<p>revolutionize life here on Earth, but at the same time, I shouldn&rsquo;t need a deadline to</p>
<p>get shit done, but I do need it.</p>
<p>And then in the same way, I think we need Mars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the human spirit that loves that longing for exploration.</p>
<p>I agree with that thesis, the going to the moon, right, and that whole endeavor has captivated</p>
<p>the imagination of so many, and it has led to incredible ideas, really, and probably</p>
<p>in nonlinear ways, not like, okay, we went to the moon, therefore some person here has</p>
<p>thought of this.</p>
<p>In that similar sense, I think space exploration is, there&rsquo;s some real magnetism about it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s on a genetic level.</p>
<p>We have this need to keep exploring when we&rsquo;re done with a certain frontier, we move on to</p>
<p>the next frontier.</p>
<p>All that I&rsquo;m saying is that I&rsquo;m not moving to Mars to live there permanently ever, and</p>
<p>I think that, I&rsquo;m glad you noted the kind of degradation of the Earth.</p>
<p>I think that is a true kind of the leading order challenge of our time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great engineering, that&rsquo;s a bunch of engineering problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most interested in space, because as I&rsquo;ve read extensively, it&rsquo;s apparently very difficult</p>
<p>to have sex in space, and so I just want that problem to be solved, because I think once</p>
<p>we solve the sex in space problem, we&rsquo;ll revolutionize sex here on Earth, thereby increasing the</p>
<p>fun on Earth, and the consequences of that can only be good.</p>
<p>I mean, you can, you&rsquo;ve got a clear plan, right, and it sounds like, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m submitting proposals to NASA as we speak.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I keep getting rejected, I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You need better diagrams.</p>
<p>Better pictures.</p>
<p>I should have thought of that.</p>
<p>You a while ago mentioned that, you know, there&rsquo;s certain aspects in the history of</p>
<p>the solar system and Earth that resulted, it could have resulted in an opaque atmosphere,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t, we couldn&rsquo;t see the stars.</p>
<p>And somebody mentioned to me a little bit ago, and it&rsquo;s almost like a philosophical</p>
<p>question for you.</p>
<p>Do you think humans, like human society would develop as it did, or at all, if we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see the stars?</p>
<p>It would be drastically different.</p>
<p>Just if it ever did develop.</p>
<p>So I think some of the early developments, right, of like, you know, fire, you know.</p>
<p>First of all, that atmosphere would be so hot, because, you know, if you have an opaque</p>
<p>atmosphere, the temperature at the bottom is huge.</p>
<p>So we would be very different beings to start with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have very different.</p>
<p>It could be cloudy in certain kinds of ways that you could still get.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Think about like a greenhouse, right?</p>
<p>A greenhouse is cloudy, effectively, but it&rsquo;s super hot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to avoid having an atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you have an opaque atmosphere, it&rsquo;s hard to, right.</p>
<p>Venus is a great example, right?</p>
<p>Venus is, I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how many degrees, but it&rsquo;s hundreds in Celsius, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a hundred, it&rsquo;s hundreds.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s only a little bit closer to the sun, that temperature is entirely coming</p>
<p>from the fact that the atmosphere is thick.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a sauna of sorts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You go there, you know, you feel refreshed after you come back, you know.</p>
<p>But if you stay there, I mean, so, okay, take that as an assumption.</p>
<p>This is a philosophical question, not a biological one.</p>
<p>So you have a life that develops under these extremely hot conditions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>So much of the early evolution of mankind was driven by exploration, right?</p>
<p>And the kind of interest in stars originated in part as a tool to guide that exploration,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I mean, that in itself, I think would be a huge, you know, a huge differential in the</p>
<p>way that we, you know, our evolution on this planet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, stars, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So even in that aspect, but even in further aspects, astronomy just shows up in basically</p>
<p>every single development in the history of science up until the 20th century, it shows</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>So I wonder without that, if we would have, if we would even get like calculus.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, that&rsquo;s a great, I mean, that&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>Newton in part developed calculus because he was interested in understanding, explaining</p>
<p>Kepler&rsquo;s laws, right?</p>
<p>In general, that whole mechanistic understanding of the night sky, right, replacing a religious</p>
<p>understanding where you interpret, you know, this is, you know, this whatever fire god</p>
<p>riding his, you know, a little chariot across the sky, as opposed to, you know, this is</p>
<p>some mechanistic set of laws that transformed humanity and arguably put us on the course</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re on today, right?</p>
<p>The entirety of the last 400 years and the development of kind of our technological world</p>
<p>that we live in today was sparked by that, right?</p>
<p>Understanding an effectively, you know, a non secular view of the natural world and</p>
<p>kind of saying, okay, this can be understood and if it can be understood, it can be utilized,</p>
<p>we can create our own variants of this.</p>
<p>Absolutely, we would be a very, very different species without astronomy.</p>
<p>This I think extends beyond just astronomy, right?</p>
<p>There are questions like why do we need to spend money on X, right?</p>
<p>Where X can be anything like paleontology, like, right?</p>
<p>The mating patterns of penguins.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think, you know, there&rsquo;s a tremendous under appreciation for the usefulness of useless</p>
<p>knowledge, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come up with this, this is a little book by the guy who started the Institute</p>
<p>for Advanced Studies, but, you know, it&rsquo;s so true, so much of the electronics that are</p>
<p>on this table, right, work on Maxwell&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>Maxwell wasn&rsquo;t sitting around in the 1800s saying, you know, I hope one day, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make, you know, a couple mics so, you know, a couple, you know, a couple guys can</p>
<p>have this conversation, right?</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t at no point was that the motivation, and yet, you know, it gave us the world that</p>
<p>we have today.</p>
<p>The answer is if you are a purely pragmatic person, if you don&rsquo;t care at all about kind</p>
<p>of the human condition, none of this, the answer is, you can tax it, right, like, useless</p>
<p>things have created way more capital than useful things.</p>
<p>And the sad thing, first of all, it&rsquo;s really important to think about, and it&rsquo;s brilliant</p>
<p>in the following context, like Neil deGrasse Tyson has this book about the role of military</p>
<p>based funding in the development of science, and then so much of technological breakthroughs</p>
<p>in the 20th century had to do with humans working on different military things.</p>
<p>And then the outcome of that had nothing to do with military, it had some military application,</p>
<p>but their impact was much, much bigger than military.</p>
<p>The splitting of the atom is a kind of a canonical example of this.</p>
<p>We all know the tragedy that, you know, arises from splitting of the atom, and yet, you know,</p>
<p>so much, I mean, the atom itself does not care for what purpose it is being split.</p>
<p>So I wonder if we took the same amount of funding as we used for war and poured it into</p>
<p>like totally seemingly useless things, like the mating patterns of penguins, we would</p>
<p>get the internet anyway.</p>
<p>I think so, I think so, and, you know, perhaps more of the internet would have penguins,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re both joking, but in some sense, like, I wonder, it&rsquo;s not the penguins, because penguins</p>
<p>is more about sort of biology, but all useless kind of tinkering and all kinds of avenues,</p>
<p>and also because military applications are often burdened by the secrecy required.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s often like so much, the openness is lacking, and if we&rsquo;ve learned anything for</p>
<p>the last few decades is that when there&rsquo;s openness in science, that accelerates the</p>
<p>development of science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That openness of science truly, you know, it benefits everybody, the notion that if,</p>
<p>you know, I share my science with you, then you&rsquo;re going to catch up and like know the</p>
<p>same thing.</p>
<p>That is a short sighted viewpoint, because if you catch up and you open, you know, you</p>
<p>discover something that puts me in a position to do the next step, right?</p>
<p>So I absolutely agree with all of this.</p>
<p>I mean, the kind of question of like military funding versus non military funding is obviously</p>
<p>a complicated one, but at the end of the day, I think we have to get over the notion as</p>
<p>a society that we are going to, you know, pay for this, and then we will get that, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true if you&rsquo;re buying like, I don&rsquo;t know, toilet paper or something, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not true in the intellectual pursuit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it works, and sometimes it&rsquo;ll fail, right?</p>
<p>Like sometimes, like a huge fraction of what I do, right?</p>
<p>I come up with an idea, I think, oh, it&rsquo;s great, and then I work it out, it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>not great, right?</p>
<p>It fails immediately.</p>
<p>Failure is not a sign that the initial pursuit was worthless, so failure is just part of</p>
<p>this kind of this whole exploration thing, and we should fund more and more of this exploration,</p>
<p>the variety of the exploration.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think it was Linus Pauling or somebody from, you know, that generation of scientists, you</p>
<p>know, a good way to have good ideas is to have a lot of ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>If you are conservative in your thinking, if you worry about proposing something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to fail and, oh, what if, you know, like, there&rsquo;s no science police that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to come and arrest you for proposing the wrong thing, and, you know, it&rsquo;s also just like,</p>
<p>why would you do science if you&rsquo;re afraid of, you know, taking that step?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be so much better to propose things that are plausible, that are interesting, and then</p>
<p>for a fraction of them to be wrong than to just kind of, you know, make incremental progress</p>
<p>all your life, right?</p>
<p>Speaking of wild ideas, let me ask you about the thing we mentioned previously, which is</p>
<p>this interstellar object Amuamua.</p>
<p>Could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t immediately discount that by saying absolutely it cannot.</p>
<p>Anything can be space junk.</p>
<p>I mean, from that point of view, can any of the Kuiper Belt objects we see be space junk?</p>
<p>Everything on the night sky can, in principle, be space junk.</p>
<p>And Kuiper Belt would catch interstellar objects potentially and, like, force them into an</p>
<p>orbit if they&rsquo;re, like, small enough?</p>
<p>Not the Kuiper Belt itself, but you can imagine, like, Jupiter family comets being captured,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>So you can actually capture things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even easier to do this very early in the solar system, like, early in the solar</p>
<p>system&rsquo;s life while it&rsquo;s still in a cluster of stars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unavoidable that you capture debris, whether it be natural debris or unnatural</p>
<p>debris, or just debris of some kind from other stars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a daycare center, right?</p>
<p>Like, everybody passes their infections on to other kids.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, Amuamua, there&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion about it, and there&rsquo;s been a lot of interest</p>
<p>in this over, like, is it aliens or is it not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, like, if you just kind of look at the facts, like, what we know about it is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of, like, a weird shape, and it also accelerated, you know?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s the two, those are the two interesting things about it.</p>
<p>There are puzzles about it, and perhaps the most daring resolution to this puzzle is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, you know, aliens or it&rsquo;s not, like, a rock, it&rsquo;s actually a piece of hydrogen</p>
<p>ice.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, this is a friend of mine, you know, Daryl Seligman, Greg Laughlin, came up with this</p>
<p>idea that in giant molecular clouds that are just clouds of hydrogen, helium, gas that</p>
<p>live throughout the galaxy, at their cores, you can condense ice to become these hydrogen,</p>
<p>you know, icebergs, if you will.</p>
<p>And then that explains many of the aspects of, in fact, I think that explains all of</p>
<p>the Oumuamua mystery, how it becomes elongated, because basically the hydrogen ice sublimates</p>
<p>and kind of like a bar of soap that, you know, slowly kind of elongates as you strip away</p>
<p>the surface layers, how it was able to accelerate because of a jet that is produced from, you</p>
<p>know, the hydrogen coming off of it, but you can&rsquo;t see it because it&rsquo;s hydrogen gas, like,</p>
<p>all of this stuff kind of falls together nicely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by that idea, truly, because it&rsquo;s like, if that&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s a new type</p>
<p>of astrophysical object.</p>
<p>And it would be produced by, what&rsquo;s the monster that produced it initially, that kind of object?</p>
<p>So these giant molecular clouds, they&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that they exist is not&hellip;</p>
<p>Are they rogue clouds or are they part of like an Oort cloud?</p>
<p>No, no, they&rsquo;re rogue clouds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just floating about?</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you go, like, a lot of people imagine the galaxy as being a, you know, a</p>
<p>bunch of stars, right, and they&rsquo;re just orbiting, right?</p>
<p>But the truth is, if you fly between stars, you run into clouds.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any large object that creates orbits, so they&rsquo;re just floating about?</p>
<p>Just floating.</p>
<p>But why are they floating together?</p>
<p>Or they just float together for a time and not&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, so these eventually become the nurseries of stars.</p>
<p>So as they cool, they contract and, you know, then collapse into stars or into groups of</p>
<p>stars.</p>
<p>And some of them, the starless molecular clouds, according to the calculations that Daryl</p>
<p>and Greg did, can create these, like, icicles of hydrogen ice.</p>
<p>I wonder why they would be flying so fast, because they seem to be moving pretty fast</p>
<p>at a quick pace.</p>
<p>You mean Oumuamua?</p>
<p>Oumuamua, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s just because of the acceleration due to the sun.</p>
<p>If you stop, it&rsquo;s like, take something really far away, let it go, and the sun is here.</p>
<p>By the time it comes close to the sun, right, it&rsquo;s moving pretty fast.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an attractive explanation, I think, not so much because it&rsquo;s cool, but it makes</p>
<p>a clear prediction, right, of when Vera Rubin Observatory comes online next year or so.</p>
<p>We will discover many, many more of these objects, right?</p>
<p>And they have, so I like theories that are falsifiable.</p>
<p>Not just testable, but falsifiable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have a falsifiable theory where you can say, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Aliens is one that&rsquo;s fundamentally difficult to say, no, that&rsquo;s not aliens.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing to me, if you look at one alien civilization, and then we</p>
<p>look at the things it produces, in terms of if we were to try to detect the alien civilization,</p>
<p>there is like, say there&rsquo;s 10 billion aliens, there would probably be trillions of dumb</p>
<p>drone type things produced by the aliens, and then be many, many, many more orders of</p>
<p>magnitude of junk.</p>
<p>So if you were to look for an alien civilization, in my mind, you would be looking for the junk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the more efficient thing to look for.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying Oumuamua has any characteristics of space junk, but it kind of opened my eyes</p>
<p>to the idea that we shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be looking to the queen of the ant colony.</p>
<p>We should be looking at, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know, traces of alien life that doesn&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>intelligent in any way, may not even look like life.</p>
<p>It could be just garbage.</p>
<p>We should be looking for garbage.</p>
<p>Just generically.</p>
<p>Well, garbage that&rsquo;s producible by unnatural forces.</p>
<p>For me at least, that was kind of interesting, because if you have a successful alien civilization,</p>
<p>that we will be producing many more orders of magnitude of junk, and that would be easier</p>
<p>potentially to detect.</p>
<p>Well, so you have to produce the junk, but you have to also launch it.</p>
<p>So this is the, this is where, I mean, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s imagine.</p>
<p>Garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s imagine we are a successful civilization that, you know, has made it to space.</p>
<p>We clearly have, right?</p>
<p>And yes, we&rsquo;re in the infancy of that pursuit, but, you know, we&rsquo;ve launched, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how many satellites.</p>
<p>If you count GPS satellites, it must be at least thousands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly thousands.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s over 10,000, but it&rsquo;s on that order.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s on that, like a large order of magnitude.</p>
<p>How many of the things that we&rsquo;ve launched will ever leave the solar system?</p>
<p>I think two.</p>
<p>Two so far.</p>
<p>Well, maybe the Voyager, the Voyager 1, Voyager 2, I don&rsquo;t know if the Pioneer.</p>
<p>So maybe three.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s also a Tesla Roadster out there.</p>
<p>That one, it will never leave the solar system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll just, I think that one will eventually collide with Mars.</p>
<p>That can be SpaceX&rsquo;s first Mars destination.</p>
<p>But look, so there&rsquo;s an energetic cost to interstellar travel, which is really hard</p>
<p>to overcome.</p>
<p>And when we think about, you know, generically, what do we look for in an alien civilization,</p>
<p>oftentimes we tend to imagine that the thing you look for is the thing that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So I think that, you know, if I look at the future, right, and for a while, like, okay,</p>
<p>if aliens are out there, they must be broadcasting in radio, right?</p>
<p>That radio, you know, the amount that we broadcast in radio has diminished tremendously in the</p>
<p>last 50 years.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re doing a lot more computation, right?</p>
<p>What are the signs of computation?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a good, that&rsquo;s an interesting question to ask, right?</p>
<p>Where I don&rsquo;t know, I think something on the order of a few percent of the entire electrical</p>
<p>grid last year went to mining Bitcoin, right?</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>Yeah, there could be a lot of in the future, different consequences of the computation,</p>
<p>which I mean, I&rsquo;m biased, but it could be robotics, it could be artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>So we may be looking for intelligent looking objects, like that&rsquo;s what I meant by probes,</p>
<p>like things that move in kind of artificial ways.</p>
<p>But the emergence of AI is not an if, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening right in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>And the energetic costs associated with that are becoming, you know, a tangible problem.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, if you imagine kind of extrapolating that into the future, right?</p>
<p>What are the, you know, what becomes the bottleneck, right?</p>
<p>The bottleneck might be powering, you know, powering the AI, broadly speaking, not one</p>
<p>AI, but powering that entire AI ecosystem, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I think, you know, space junk is an is kind of, it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>idea, but it&rsquo;s heavily influenced by like sci fi of 1950s, where by 2020, we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>like, flying to the moon.</p>
<p>And so we produce a lot of space junk, I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the pathway that alien</p>
<p>civilizations take, I&rsquo;ve also never seen an alien civilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But if your theory of chill turns out to be true, and then we don&rsquo;t, you know, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily explore, we seize the exploration phase of a, like alien civilizations quickly</p>
<p>seize the exploration phase of their, of their efforts, then, then perhaps they&rsquo;ll just be</p>
<p>chilling in a particular space, expanding slowly, but then using up a lot of resources</p>
<p>and then have to have a lot of garbage disposal that sends stuff out.</p>
<p>And the other, you know, the other idea was that it could be a relay that you&rsquo;ll almost</p>
<p>have like these GPS like markers, these sent throughout, which I think is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to this probe idea of sending a large number of probes out to measure gravitational</p>
<p>to measure basically, yeah, the gravitational field, essentially, I mean, a lot of people</p>
<p>at Caltech or at MIT are trying to measure gravitational fields.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas of sending stuff out there that accurately measures those</p>
<p>gravitational fields to have a greater understanding of the early universe.</p>
<p>But then you might realize that communication through gravitation, through gravity is actually</p>
<p>much more effective than, than radio waves, for example, something like that.</p>
<p>And then you send out, I mean, okay, if you&rsquo;re an alien civilization that&rsquo;s able to have</p>
<p>gigantic masses, like basically, we&rsquo;re getting there as a, as a civilization, no, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>not even close.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I mean, like be able to sort of play with black holes, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about a whole nother order of magnitude of masses, then it may be very</p>
<p>effective to send signals via gravitational waves.</p>
<p>I actually my sense is that all of these things are genuinely difficult to predict, you know,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean like, to kind of shy away, I just I really mean, if you think if you</p>
<p>take imagination of what the future will look like from, you know, 500 years ago, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it is so hard to conceive of the impossible, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost like, you know, it&rsquo;s almost limiting to try and imagine things</p>
<p>that are an order of magnitude, you know, or two orders of magnitude ahead in terms</p>
<p>of progress, just because, you know, you mentioned cars before, you know, if you were to ask</p>
<p>people what they wanted in 1870, it&rsquo;s faster buggies, right?</p>
<p>So so I think the whole like, kind of, you know, alien conversation inevitably gets gets</p>
<p>limited by by our entire kind of collective astrophysical lack of imagination.</p>
<p>So to push back a little bit, I find that it&rsquo;s really interesting to talk about these</p>
<p>wild ideas about the future, whether it&rsquo;s aliens, whether it&rsquo;s AI, with brilliant people</p>
<p>like yourself, who are focused on very particular tools of science, we have today, to solve</p>
<p>very particular, like rigorous scientific questions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like putting on this wild dreamy hat, like some percent of the time</p>
<p>and say, like, what are like, what would alien civilizations look like?</p>
<p>What would alien trash look like?</p>
<p>Well, what would our own civilization that sends out trillions of AI systems out there,</p>
<p>like how 9000, but 10,000 out there, what would that look like?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, any one prediction is probably going to be horrendously wrong.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about creating these kind of wild predictions that kind of opens</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s a huge magnetism to it, right?</p>
<p>And some of some of it, you know, I mean, some of the Jules Verne novels did a phenomenal</p>
<p>job predicting the future, right?</p>
<p>That actually was a great example of what you&rsquo;re talking about, like allowing your imagination</p>
<p>to run free.</p>
<p>I mean, I just hope, I just hope there&rsquo;s dragons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, I love dragons are the best.</p>
<p>But see, the cool thing about science fiction and these kinds of conversations, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just predict the future, I think.</p>
<p>Some of these things will create the future.</p>
<p>Taking the idea, the humans are amazing, like fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>Humans are really good at taking an idea that seems impossible at the time.</p>
<p>And for any one individual human, that idea is like, it&rsquo;s like planting a seed that eventually</p>
<p>materializes itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird how science fiction can create science fiction, it drives the science.</p>
<p>I agree with you, and I think in this regard, you know, I&rsquo;m like a sucker for sci fi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all I listen to like now when I run and some of it is completely implausible, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both entertaining and, you know, it&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>You know about the black clouds book, I think this is by Fred Hoyle.</p>
<p>This is like, this has great connections with sort of a lot of the advancements that are</p>
<p>happening in NLP right now, right, with transformer models and so on.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s this black cloud shows up in the solar system and then, you know,</p>
<p>people try to send radio and then it learns to talk back at you, you know.</p>
<p>So anyway, we don&rsquo;t have to talk at all about it, but it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s something worth checking</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>With that, on the alien front, with the black cloud, to me, exactly, on the NLP front, and</p>
<p>also just explainability of AI, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Just the very question, Stephen Wolfram looked at this with the movie Arrival, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what would be the common language that we would discover?</p>
<p>The reason that&rsquo;s really interesting to me is we have aliens here on earth now.</p>
<p>Japanese.</p>
<p>Japanese, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Japanese is the obvious answer.</p>
<p>Japanese, yeah, that would be the common, maybe it would be music, actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more likely.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a language.</p>
<p>It would be art that they would communicate.</p>
<p>But you know, I do believe that we have, I&rsquo;m with Stephen Wolfram on this a little bit,</p>
<p>that to me, computation, like programs we write, that, you know, that they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>intelligent creatures and I feel like we haven&rsquo;t found the common language to talk with them.</p>
<p>Like our little creations that are artificial are not born with whatever that innate thing</p>
<p>that produces language with us and like, coming up with mechanisms for communicating with</p>
<p>them is an effort that feels like it will produce some incredible discoveries.</p>
<p>You can even think of, if you think that math has discovered, mathematics in itself is a</p>
<p>kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s an innate construction of the world we live in.</p>
<p>I think we are, you know, part of the way there because pre 1950, right, computers were</p>
<p>human beings that would carry out arithmetic, right?</p>
<p>And I think it was Ulam who worked in Los Alamos at the time, like towards the end of</p>
<p>the second world war, wrote something about how, you know, in the future, right, computers</p>
<p>will not be just arithmetic tool, but will be truly an interactive, you know, thing with</p>
<p>which you could do experiments, right?</p>
<p>At the time, the notion of doing an experiment, not like in the lab with some beakers, but</p>
<p>an experiment on a computer, designing an experiment, a numerical experiment was a new</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Like, you know, 70% of what I do is I design, you know, I write code, terrible code to be</p>
<p>clear, like, but, you know, I write code that creates an experiment, which is a simulation.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I think we&rsquo;re beginning to interact with the computer in a way that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, not as just a, you know, fancy calculator, not as just a, you know, call</p>
<p>and request type of thing, but, you know, something that can generate insights that</p>
<p>are otherwise completely unattainable, right there, unattainable by doing analytical mathematics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, with AlphaFold 2, we&rsquo;re now starting to crack open biology, so being able to simulate</p>
<p>at first trivial biological systems and hopefully down the line, complex biological systems.</p>
<p>My hope is to be able to simulate psychological, like sociological systems, like humans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, you know, a large part of my work at MIT was on autonomous vehicles, and the fascinating</p>
<p>thing to me was about pedestrians, human pedestrians interacting with autonomous vehicles and simulating</p>
<p>those systems without murdering humans would be very useful, but nevertheless is exceptionally</p>
<p>difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so.</p>
<p>When is my Mustang gonna drive itself?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even joking, it&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>It turns out it&rsquo;s much more difficult than we imagined, and I suppose that&rsquo;s the kind</p>
<p>of, the progress of science is just like, you know, going to Mars, it&rsquo;s probably going</p>
<p>to turn out to be way more difficult than we imagined.</p>
<p>Sending out probes to investigate Planet 9 at the edge of our solar system might turn</p>
<p>out to be way more difficult than we imagined, but we do it anyway, and we figure it out</p>
<p>in the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, Mars is a great, I mean, going, sending humans to Mars is way more complicated</p>
<p>than sending humans to the moon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think, just like naively, both are in space, who cares, like, if you go there, why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you go there, you know, just life support is an extremely expensive thing, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of extra challenges, but I disagree with you, I would be one of the early</p>
<p>people to go.</p>
<p>I used to think not, I used to think I&rsquo;d be one of the first maybe million to go once</p>
<p>you have a little bit of a society, I think I&rsquo;m upgrading myself to the first like 10,000.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, front of the cabin.</p>
<p>Not completely front, but like, it would be interesting to die, I&rsquo;m okay with, death sucks,</p>
<p>but I kind of like the idea of dying on Mars.</p>
<p>Of all the places to die, I gotta say, in this regard, like, I don&rsquo;t wanna die on Mars.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>No, no, I would much rather die on Earth.</p>
<p>I mean, death is fundamentally boring, right, like, death is a very boring experience, but</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never died before, so I don&rsquo;t know from first hand experience.</p>
<p>As far as you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It could be reincarnation, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So you mean, where would you die?</p>
<p>If you had to choose?</p>
<p>Oh, man, okay, so I would definitely, there&rsquo;s a question of who I&rsquo;d wanna die with, I prefer</p>
<p>not to die alone, but like, surrounded by family would be preferable, where I think</p>
<p>Northern New Mexico, and I&rsquo;m not even joking, like, this is not a random place, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like.</p>
<p>Would that be your favorite place on Earth?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, like, favorite place on Earth to reside, you know, indefinitely, but it</p>
<p>is one of the most beautiful places I&rsquo;ve ever been to.</p>
<p>So you know, there&rsquo;s something, I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s something attractive about going,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>Returning to nature in a beautiful place.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about another aspect of your life that is full of beauty, music.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a musician.</p>
<p>The absurd question I have to ask, what is the greatest song of all time, objectively</p>
<p>speaking?</p>
<p>The greatest song of all time.</p>
<p>I suppose that could change moment to moment, day to day, but if you were forced to answer</p>
<p>for this particular moment in your life, that&rsquo;s something that pops to mind, this could be</p>
<p>both philosophically, this could be technically as a musician, like what you enjoy, maybe</p>
<p>lyrics.</p>
<p>Lyrics is very important, so I would probably, it would be, my choice would be lyrics based.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to answer in terms of just technical, you know, technical prowess.</p>
<p>I think technical prowess is impressive, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s impressive what can be done.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t place that into the category of the greatest music ever written.</p>
<p>Some classical music that&rsquo;s written is undeniably beautiful, but I don&rsquo;t want to consider that</p>
<p>category of music either, just because, you know, so if I have to limit the scope of this</p>
<p>philosophical discussion to, you know, the kind of music that I listen to, you know,</p>
<p>probably What&rsquo;s My Age Again by Blink 182, it&rsquo;s just, you know, it&rsquo;s a solid one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got, you know.</p>
<p>Said nobody ever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good song.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re joking.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I am joking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good one, but it&rsquo;s, yeah, I mean.</p>
<p>I was going to come back as a close second.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s My Age Again, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it would probably, you know, songwriting wise, I think The Beatles came pretty close</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>Were they influential to you?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Love The Beatles.</p>
<p>I love The Beatles.</p>
<p>Let it be yesterday.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I think Strawberry Fields Forever is one.</p>
<p>You know what one of my favorite Beatles songs is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, In My Life, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how, whatever, a 24 year old wrote that.</p>
<p>It is one of the most introspective pieces of music ever.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a huge Pink Floyd fan, and so I think, you know, if you were to, you can</p>
<p>sort of look at the entire Dark Side of the Moon album as, you know, getting pretty close</p>
<p>up there to the pinnacle of what, you know, can be created, so, you know, Time is a great</p>
<p>song.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great song.</p>
<p>Just the entirety of just the instruments, the lyrics, the feeling created by a song,</p>
<p>like Pink Floyd can create feelings.</p>
<p>The entire experience, I mean, you have that with The Wall of just transporting you into</p>
<p>another place.</p>
<p>Songs don&rsquo;t, not many songs could do that as well.</p>
<p>Not many artists can do that as well as Pink Floyd did.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bands that you can kind of say, oh yeah, like if you take Blink 182,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You have no idea, like if you are listening to sort of that type of pop punk for the first</p>
<p>time, it&rsquo;s difficult to differentiate between Blink 182 and like Sum 41 and the thousand</p>
<p>of other like lesser known bands that all sounded, they all had that sparkling production</p>
<p>feel, they all kind of sounded the same, right?</p>
<p>With Pink Floyd, it&rsquo;s hard to find another band that you&rsquo;re like, well, is this one Pink</p>
<p>Floyd?</p>
<p>Like you know when you&rsquo;re listening to Pink Floyd what you&rsquo;re listening to.</p>
<p>The uniqueness, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>You know, in the calculation of the greatest song in the greatest band of all time, you</p>
<p>could probably, you could probably actually quantify this like scientifically, is like</p>
<p>how unique, if you play different songs, how well are people able to recognize whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this band or not?</p>
<p>And that, you know, that&rsquo;s probably a huge component to greatness.</p>
<p>Like if the world would miss it if it was gone.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the human story things, like I would say I would put Johnny Cash&rsquo;s cover</p>
<p>of Hurt as one of the greatest songs of all time.</p>
<p>And that has less to do with the song.</p>
<p>But your interaction with it.</p>
<p>Interaction with it, but also the human, the full story of the human.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s not just, if I just heard the song, I&rsquo;d be like, okay.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s the full story of it, also the video component for that particular song.</p>
<p>So like that, you can&rsquo;t discount the full experience of it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, I have no confusion about not, about being, you know, anywhere, you know, in that</p>
<p>league, but I just like sometimes think about, you know, music that is being produced today</p>
<p>feels oftentimes, it feels like kind of clothes, like clothes that you buy at like H&amp;M and</p>
<p>you wear it three times before they rip and you throw away.</p>
<p>So like so much of it is, it&rsquo;s not bad, it&rsquo;s just kind of forgettable, right?</p>
<p>Like the fact that we&rsquo;re talking about Pink Floyd in 2021 is in itself an interesting</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>Why are we talking about Pink Floyd?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something unforgettable about them and unforgettable about the art that</p>
<p>they created.</p>
<p>That could be the markets that like, so Spotify has created this kind of market where the</p>
<p>incentives for creating music that lasts is much lower because there&rsquo;s so much more music.</p>
<p>You just want something that shines bright for a short amount of time, makes a lot of</p>
<p>money and moves on.</p>
<p>And I mean, the same thing you see with the news and all those kinds of things, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just living in a shorter and shorter, shorter like a time scale in terms of our attention</p>
<p>spans.</p>
<p>And that, nevertheless, when we look at the long arc of history of music, perhaps there</p>
<p>will be some songs from today that will last as much as Pink Floyd, we&rsquo;re just unable to</p>
<p>see it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just the collected works of Nickelback.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>Justin Bieber.</p>
<p>It could be a contender.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started listening to Justin Bieber just to understand what people are</p>
<p>talking about.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just keep my comments to myself on that one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too good to explain in words.</p>
<p>The words cannot capture the greatness that is the Biebs.</p>
<p>You as a musician, so you write your own music, you play guitar, you sing.</p>
<p>Maybe can you give an overview of the role music has played in your life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the, you&rsquo;re a world class scientist.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to see somebody in your position who is also a great musician</p>
<p>and still loves playing music.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself a great musician.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know.</p>
<p>One of the best of all time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Like we were saying offline, confidence is like the most essential thing about being</p>
<p>a rock star.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the confidence and kind of like moodiness, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, music plays an absolutely essential role in everything I do because I lose, if</p>
<p>I stop playing for one reason or another, say I&rsquo;m traveling, I notably lose creativity</p>
<p>in every other aspect of my life, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, I don&rsquo;t view, you know, playing music as a separate endeavor from</p>
<p>doing science or doing whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of that same creative thing, which is distinct from, I don&rsquo;t know, pressing</p>
<p>a button or like, you know.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a break from science, it&rsquo;s a part of your science.</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s a part of, I would say, you know, it&rsquo;s a thing that enables the science,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>The science would, you know, suck even more than it does already without the music.</p>
<p>And that means like the creating of the writing of the music or is it just even playing other</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s stuff?</p>
<p>Is it the whole of it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely both.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also just, you know, I love to play guitar, I love to sing, you know.</p>
<p>My wife tolerates my screeching singing, you know, and even kind of likes it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so people should check out your stuff.</p>
<p>You have a great voice, so I love your stuff.</p>
<p>Is there something, you&rsquo;re super busy, is there something you can say about practicing</p>
<p>for musicians, for guitar, you&rsquo;re also in a band, so like that whole, how you can manage</p>
<p>that?</p>
<p>Is there some tricks, is there some hacks to being a lifelong musician while being like</p>
<p>super busy?</p>
<p>So I would say, you know, the way that I optimize my life is I try to do, you know, the thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m passionate about in a moment and put that at the top of the priority list.</p>
<p>There are moments when, you know, you just, you feel inspired to play music and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the middle of something, if you can avoid, if that can be put on hold, just do it, right?</p>
<p>There are times when you get inspired about something scientific, you know, I do my best</p>
<p>to drop everything, go into that, you know, mode of, that isolated mode and execute upon</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a chaotic, you know, I think I have a pretty chaotic lifestyle where I&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>doing kind of multiple things and jumping between what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s not like, you know, those moments of inspiration are</p>
<p>actually kind of rare, right?</p>
<p>Like most of the time, all of us are just doing kind of, doing the stuff that needs</p>
<p>to get done.</p>
<p>If you do the disservice to yourself of saying, oh, I&rsquo;m inspired to, you know, do this calculation,</p>
<p>figure this out, but I&rsquo;ve got to answer email or just like do something silly, you know,</p>
<p>that is nothing more than disservice.</p>
<p>And also, like I have some social media presence, but I mostly stay off of, you know, social</p>
<p>media to, you know, just frankly, cause like, I don&rsquo;t kind of, I don&rsquo;t enjoy the mental</p>
<p>cycles that it, that it takes over.</p>
<p>Yeah, it robs you of that, the, yeah, those precious moments that could be filled with</p>
<p>inspiration in your, in your other pursuits.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something to, maybe you and I are different in this, like I tried to play</p>
<p>at least 10 minutes of guitar every day, like almost on the technical side, like keeping</p>
<p>that base of basic competence going.</p>
<p>And I mean, the same way like writers will get in front of a paper no matter what, that</p>
<p>kind of thing, it just feels like that for my life has been essential to the daily ritual</p>
<p>of it.</p>
<p>Why does days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months, and you haven&rsquo;t played guitar</p>
<p>for months?</p>
<p>No, no, I, I, I understand.</p>
<p>For me, I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s been like, if we have a gig coming up, we&rsquo;ll definitely</p>
<p>You need deadlines.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>No, like we, we will, we will sharpen up definitely, you know, especially coming up to a gig.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, we&rsquo;re not trying to make money with this.</p>
<p>This is like, just for the, for that satisfaction of doing something and doing something well,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But overall, I would say most, I play guitar most days, most days.</p>
<p>And you know, when I put kids to sleep, I play guitar, you know, with them and we like,</p>
<p>just make up random songs about, you know, about our cat or something, you know, like</p>
<p>we just do kind of random stuff.</p>
<p>But you know, music is always involved in that process.</p>
<p>Yeah, keeping it fun.</p>
<p>You have Russian roots?</p>
<p>I sure do.</p>
<p>Were you born in Russia?</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When did you come here?</p>
<p>So, I came to the US in very, the very end of 99.</p>
<p>But so I was like, almost 14 years old.</p>
<p>But along the way, we spent six years in Japan.</p>
<p>So like, we moved from Russia to Japan in 94, and then to the US in 99.</p>
<p>So did like elementary school, middle school in Japan.</p>
<p>So elementary school in Japan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s interesting, dad.</p>
<p>Do you still speak Russian?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t speak Russian, Konstantin was talking</p>
<p>about basically his first, in 1992, interaction with capitalism,</p>
<p>which is Pepsi, and at first he discovered Pepsi, and then he</p>
<p>discovered Coke, and he was confused how such, how such</p>
<p>theft could occur.</p>
<p>Yeah, like an intellectual property theft.</p>
<p>And remember, Pepsi arrived to the Soviet Union first,</p>
<p>and there was some, there&rsquo;s some complicated story which I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quite understand the details of.</p>
<p>For a while, Pepsi like commanded submarines or</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>Yeah, Pepsi had like a fleet of Soviet submarines that it</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>They were sponsoring tanks and this fascinating.</p>
<p>And I remember, there&rsquo;s certain things that trickled in, like</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s, I remember that was a big deal.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Certain aspects of the West.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So, I mean, we went to McDonald&rsquo;s, and we stood on, I mean,</p>
<p>this is, this is absurd, right, from, kind of looking at it</p>
<p>from today&rsquo;s perspective, but we stood in line for like six</p>
<p>hours to get into this McDonald&rsquo;s, and I remember inside</p>
<p>it was just like a billion people, and I&rsquo;m just taking a</p>
<p>bite out of that Big Mac, and we&rsquo;re like, wow.</p>
<p>What was it, an incredible experience for you?</p>
<p>So, like, what is this taste of the West like?</p>
<p>Did you enjoy it?</p>
<p>I enjoyed the fact that, I mean, this is like, this is getting</p>
<p>into the weeds, but I really enjoyed the fact that the top of</p>
<p>the bun had those seeds, you know, like, and I remember how</p>
<p>on the commercials, like, the Big Mac would kind of bounce.</p>
<p>I was like, the seeds, how do they inject the seeds into the</p>
<p>bread?</p>
<p>Like, amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, I think it was&hellip;</p>
<p>Artistry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you enjoyed the artistry of the culinary experience.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It was the, you know, it was the food art that is the Big Mac.</p>
<p>Actually, I still don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>How do they get the sesame seeds on the bun?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to not know the answer.</p>
<p>You just wander the mystery of it all.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember it being exceptionally delicious, but I&rsquo;m with you, I don&rsquo;t know, you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mention how transformative Pepsi was, but to me, basically sugar based stuff, like Pepsi</p>
<p>was, or Coke, I don&rsquo;t remember which one we partook in, but that was an incredible experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, absolutely.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think it&rsquo;s, you know, it was an important and formative period.</p>
<p>I sometimes, I guess, rely on that a little bit, you know, in my daily life, because I</p>
<p>remember, like, the early 90s were real rough, you know, like my parents were kind of on</p>
<p>the bottom of the spectrum in terms of, you know, in terms of financial well being.</p>
<p>So kind of like just when I run into trouble, not like, you know, money trouble, just any</p>
<p>kind of trouble these days, it just kind of is not particularly meaningful when you compare</p>
<p>it to that turbulent time of the early 90s.</p>
<p>And the other thing is, I think there&rsquo;s like an advantage to being, you know, an immigrant,</p>
<p>which is that you go through the mental exercise of changing your environment completely early</p>
<p>in your life, right?</p>
<p>You go, it&rsquo;s by no means, you know, pleasant in the moment, right, but like going into</p>
<p>Japanese elementary school, right, like, I didn&rsquo;t go to some, like, private, you know,</p>
<p>thing, I just went to a regular, like, Japanese public elementary school, and I was the non</p>
<p>Japanese person in my class.</p>
<p>So just like to learn Japanese and just kind of.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a super humbling experience in many ways was when you like made fun of all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Being the outsider.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>But, you know, you kind of do, you kind of do that, and then you kind of, then you just</p>
<p>kind of are okay with stuff, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And so like doing that, again, in middle school in the US, it was arguably easy, because I</p>
<p>was like, yeah, well, I&rsquo;ve already done this before.</p>
<p>So I think it kind of prepares you mentally a little bit for switching up for whatever,</p>
<p>you know, changes that will come up for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t trade that, that experience really for anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge aspect of who I am, and I&rsquo;m sure you can relate to a lot of this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there advice from your life that you can give to young people today, high school, college,</p>
<p>you know, about their career, or maybe about life in general?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like a career coach, but I&rsquo;m definitely not a life coach.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have it all figured out.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a perpetual cycle of, you know, thinking that there is a, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like a template for success, right?</p>
<p>Maybe there is, but in my experience, I haven&rsquo;t seen it, right?</p>
<p>You know, I would say people in high school, right?</p>
<p>So much of their focus is on getting straight A&rsquo;s, filling their CV with this and this and</p>
<p>this so that it looks impressive, right?</p>
<p>That is not, I think, a good way to optimize your life, right?</p>
<p>Do the thing that fills your life with passion.</p>
<p>Do the thing that fills your life with interest.</p>
<p>And you know, do that perpetually, right?</p>
<p>A straight A student, you know, is really impressive, but also, you know, somewhat boring,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So, I think, you know, injection of more of that kind of interest into the lives of young</p>
<p>people would go a long way in just both upping their level of happiness and then just kind</p>
<p>of ensuring that, looking forward, they are not suffering from a, you know, perpetual</p>
<p>condition of, oh, I have to satisfy these, like, you know, check boxes to do well, right?</p>
<p>Because you can lose yourself in that whole process for the rest of your life, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nice if it&rsquo;s possible, like Max Tegmark was exceptionally good at this at MIT, figure</p>
<p>out how you can spend a small part of your, percent of your efforts that, such that your</p>
<p>CV looks really impressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, like, without a doubt, like, that&rsquo;s a baseline that you need to have.</p>
<p>And then, so like, spend most of your time doing like amazing things you&rsquo;re passionate</p>
<p>about, but such that it kind of like Planet Nine produces objects that feed your CV, like,</p>
<p>slowly over time.</p>
<p>Like getting good grades in high school, maybe doing extracurricular activities or in terms</p>
<p>of like, you know, for programmers that&rsquo;s producing code that you can show up on GitHub,</p>
<p>like leaving traces, like, throughout your efforts, such that your CV looks impressive</p>
<p>to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>In fact, I mean, this is somewhat along the lines of what I&rsquo;m talking about, see, like,</p>
<p>getting like good grades is important, but grades are not a tangible, like, product.</p>
<p>You cannot, you know, show your A and have your A live a separate life from you.</p>
<p>Code very much does, right?</p>
<p>Music very much takes on, you know, provided somebody else listens to it, like, takes on</p>
<p>a life of its own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what I mean, right?</p>
<p>Creating stuff that can then get separated from you is exceptionally attractive, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fun and&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also very impressive to others.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re moving to a world where grades mean less and less, like certifications mean</p>
<p>less and less.</p>
<p>If you look at, especially again in the computing fields, getting a degree, finishing your,</p>
<p>especially just finishing your degree, whether it&rsquo;s bachelor&rsquo;s or master&rsquo;s or PhD is less</p>
<p>important than the things you&rsquo;ve actually put out into the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fascinating kind of, that&rsquo;s great that in that sense, the meritocracy is in</p>
<p>its richest, most beautiful form is starting to win out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird because like, you know, my understanding, and I&rsquo;m not like, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the history of science well enough to speak very confidently about this, but, you know,</p>
<p>the advisor of my advisor of my advisor from undergrad, like didn&rsquo;t have a PhD, right?</p>
<p>So I think it was a more common thing back in the day, even in the academic sector to,</p>
<p>you know, not have, you know, Faraday, like Faraday didn&rsquo;t know algebra and drew diagrams</p>
<p>about, you know, magnetic fields and Faraday&rsquo;s law was derived entirely from intuition.</p>
<p>So it is interesting to how the world of academia has evolved into a, you&rsquo;ve got to do this</p>
<p>and then get PhD, then you have to postdoc once and twice and maybe thrice and then like</p>
<p>you move on.</p>
<p>So, you know, it does, I do wonder, you know, if we&rsquo;re, you know, if there&rsquo;s a better approach.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re heading there, but it&rsquo;s a fascinating historical perspective, like that we might</p>
<p>have just tried this whole thing out for a while where we put a lot more emphasis on</p>
<p>grades and certificates and degrees and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think the difference historically is like we can actually, using the internet, show</p>
<p>off ourselves and our creations better and better and more effectively, whether that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>code or producing videos or all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I want to become a certified drone pilot.</p>
<p>Of all the things you want to pick, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Or you could just fly and make YouTube videos against hundreds of thousands of views with</p>
<p>your drone and never getting a certificate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably illegal.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>So you look at planets, they seem to orbit stuff without asking the why question.</p>
<p>And for some reason, life emerged on Earth such that it led to big brains that can ask</p>
<p>the big why question.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s an answer to it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the question is.</p>
<p>Meaning of life?</p>
<p>The meaning of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 42.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But aside from that, I think the question you&rsquo;re asking is why we do all this, right?</p>
<p>Why we do all this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the human condition, right?</p>
<p>Human beings are fundamentally, I feel like, sort of stochastic and fundamentally interested</p>
<p>in kind of expanding our own understanding of the world around us.</p>
<p>And creating stuff to enable that understanding.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like stochastic, fundamentally stochastic.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s just a bunch of randomness that really doesn&rsquo;t seem like it has a good</p>
<p>explanation and yet there&rsquo;s a kind of direction to our being that we just keep wanting to</p>
<p>create and to understand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There are people that claim to be anti science, right?</p>
<p>And yet in their anti science discussion, they&rsquo;re like, well, if you&rsquo;re so scientific,</p>
<p>then why don&rsquo;t you explain to me how, I don&rsquo;t know, this works.</p>
<p>And like it always, there&rsquo;s that fundamental seed of curiosity and interest that is common</p>
<p>to all of us.</p>
<p>That is absolutely what makes us human, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in a privileged position of being able to have that be my job, right?</p>
<p>I think as time evolves forward and the kind of economy changes, I mean, we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>starting to see a shift towards that type of creative enterprise as taking over a bigger</p>
<p>and bigger chunk of the sector.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not yet, I think, the dominant portion of the economy by any account.</p>
<p>But if we compare this to sometime when the dominant thing you would do would be to go</p>
<p>to a factory and do the same exact thing, I think there&rsquo;s a tide there and things are</p>
<p>sort of headed in that direction.</p>
<p>Yeah, life&rsquo;s becoming more and more fun.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Honestly, what happens next?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to just chill.</p>
<p>Just chill.</p>
<p>The terminal point of this is just chill and wait for those Kuiper Belt objects to complete</p>
<p>one orbit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to credit you with this idea.</p>
<p>I do hope that we definitively discover a proof that there is a Planet 9 out there in</p>
<p>the next few years so you can sit back with a cigar or cigarette or vodka or wine and</p>
<p>just say, I told you so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do that later tonight.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, confidence is essential to being a rock star.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you explaining so many fascinating things to me today.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the work that you do out there and I really appreciate you talking</p>
<p>with me today.</p>
<p>Thanks, Constantine.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me on.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Constantine Batygin and thank you to</p>
<p>Squarespace, Litterati, Onnit, And, and I.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Douglas Adams in the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to</p>
<p>the Galaxy.</p>
<p>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm</p>
<p>of the galaxy lies a small, unregarded yellow sun.</p>
<p>Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant</p>
<p>little blue green planet whose ape descendant life forms are so amazingly primitive that</p>
<p>they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
