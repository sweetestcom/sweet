<p>ÔªøI mean like all the symptoms kind of go</p>
<p>away thing well we&rsquo;re getting ones back</p>
<p>and if you can turn it off but thank you</p>
<p>Karen so much for your question and now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to go to a D do we have any</p>
<p>questions with social media yes we do</p>
<p>all right so we have Theresa from on</p>
<p>Facebook and she&rsquo;s asking well she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like stevia and what can she use</p>
<p>just weaken some things you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good question because I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>like stevia in certain things to you</p>
<p>because it has a kind of a weird taste</p>
<p>you can do a wreath rotol but you need a</p>
<p>lot more of that to sweeten things so a</p>
<p>lot of times that creates a digestive</p>
<p>issue so I&rsquo;m gonna recommend a non GM</p>
<p>GMO xylitol use that because it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>tastes just like sugar but there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very low glycemic index it&rsquo;s not zero</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like thirty but if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>consume a lot of it you&rsquo;re totally fine</p>
<p>okay alright do we have another question</p>
<p>yes we do again on Facebook we have Joe</p>
<p>asking about gout yeah so the main thing</p>
<p>Joe if you&rsquo;re doing keto okay in a</p>
<p>minute fasting what happens is you have</p>
<p>two things you have your pee tones are</p>
<p>acidic so you know you might lead to</p>
<p>more doubt symptoms and that you need to</p>
<p>chill out that pH a little bit by taking</p>
<p>lemon juice and also take make sure your</p>
<p>vegetables are high calcium magnesium</p>
<p>would help but also a potassium citrate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the most important thing I</p>
<p>use that in my electrolyte powder and</p>
<p>that works good but the other thing is</p>
<p>when you do ketosis you actually trigger</p>
<p>more nitrogen which then can increase</p>
<p>more uric acid so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>connection but that usually only happens</p>
<p>in the transition phase as you keep</p>
<p>doing this that should go away but to</p>
<p>counter the gout or the uric acid you</p>
<p>want to basically take potassium citrate</p>
<p>okay alright do we got one more question</p>
<p>yes again from Facebook</p>
<p>Yola is asking is keto lifestyle acidic</p>
<p>or alkaline well this is a brink of good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna let you know like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a couple videos I have on pH and you</p>
<p>almost have to kind of not worry about</p>
<p>if something&rsquo;s acidic or alkaline</p>
<p>because in your body you know people</p>
<p>will personal me back up like people</p>
<p>will tell you oh you need to alkalize</p>
<p>your body like really well did you</p>
<p>realize that your stomach is like</p>
<p>severely acid between 1:00 and 3:00 and</p>
<p>your large bowel is acidic and so each</p>
<p>part of your body has a different ph so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not true that we need to alkalize</p>
<p>our body what we just need to do is eat</p>
<p>healthy so all the different ph is go in</p>
<p>a normal state</p>
<p>so keto and intermittent fasting done</p>
<p>correctly like like the way that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you with a lot more vegetables</p>
<p>will be perfect for you so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to make you more acidic or more</p>
<p>alkaline and we&rsquo;ll just feed the body</p>
<p>what it needs to balance out you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right pH alright okay so Kim we are</p>
<p>going to you you have you&rsquo;re from New</p>
<p>York New Orleans you had a supplement</p>
<p>question go ahead hi I have I wanted to</p>
<p>go through quickly into my medical</p>
<p>background and I tell you what</p>
<p>supplements I take I want to see what</p>
<p>your suggestions are and changing them</p>
<p>or keeping keeping them the way they are</p>
<p>okay just one little point a lot of</p>
<p>times people will give me their whole</p>
<p>history so give me a like a thumbnail</p>
<p>sketch of what&rsquo;s going on so we can okay</p>
<p>yeah okay I had hepatitis a at age 14</p>
<p>hyperthyroidism at age 19 radioactive</p>
<p>iodine 21 and then hypothyroid</p>
<p>hypothyroidism 25 and I&rsquo;ve been on a</p>
<p>centroid for 12 years now it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>regulated my recent blood work shows I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>low on vitamin D sodium and chloride and</p>
<p>my body type is definitely ovary Stage</p>
<p>one and I&rsquo;m taking the ovary kit that</p>
<p>you have in your website and because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had some issues with my liver I</p>
<p>want to know if there&rsquo;s anything else</p>
<p>that you can suggest that I can do or</p>
<p>maybe the source of this thyroid problem</p>
<p>it has something to do with my liver I</p>
<p>also have reached in</p>
<p>thin nails that that crack and that</p>
<p>crack longitudinally okay good question</p>
<p>I think here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on the big</p>
<p>thing you need is more bile salts</p>
<p>because your bile salts help you absorb</p>
<p>vitamin D and because you had a history</p>
<p>of hepatitis A there&rsquo;s some obvious</p>
<p>symptom damage with the liver so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably not producing enough bile salts</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re probably gonna benefit from</p>
<p>some taking some purified bile salts and</p>
<p>I recommend like a gallbladder formula</p>
<p>to actually increase that so you can</p>
<p>start absorbing more vitamin D which</p>
<p>will then help you absorb the minerals</p>
<p>necessary especially vitamin</p>
<p>I mean calcium and magnesium to handle</p>
<p>the ridges in the nails because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a little indication that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>systemically for the entire body now I</p>
<p>would also at the same time</p>
<p>Sidda Phi your stomach with either</p>
<p>outside of vinegar powder or they</p>
<p>betaine how to chloride or a combination</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to help you absorb</p>
<p>more minerals too from the stomach level</p>
<p>and of course if you&rsquo;re low in sodium</p>
<p>and chloride I would just take some sea</p>
<p>salt so I think that would be in a quick</p>
<p>answer in addition to getting in the</p>
<p>basics of what we talked about with keto</p>
<p>and definitely them in a fasting because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna heal your liver ultimately</p>
<p>thanks Kim alright we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>Susan from Florida you know you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>little frustrated with your weight loss</p>
<p>right yes I&rsquo;m sick well let me let me</p>
<p>just give you a little bit about me I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>63 years old I&rsquo;ve tried many diets</p>
<p>through my life yo-yo and up and down</p>
<p>through the years I have a five foot</p>
<p>seven frame which is medium to small I</p>
<p>carried my weight in my hips my butt and</p>
<p>in my legs I&rsquo;ve been addicted to sugar</p>
<p>salt bread and pasta my whole life in</p>
<p>2015 I went on a low glycol diet which</p>
<p>was based upon</p>
<p>controlling insulin I was not eating any</p>
<p>sugar flour very low carbs and I found</p>
<p>this diet and I lost 38 pounds now</p>
<p>flash-forward to 2018</p>
<p>right before I started your diet I had</p>
<p>started cheating on sugar and</p>
<p>introducing white flour and everything</p>
<p>back in and I gained my weight went up</p>
<p>to 175 pounds so I&rsquo;m now doing your</p>
<p>program and I have great willpower I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cheat on this I&rsquo;ve been doing it</p>
<p>for eight weeks</p>
<p>I even intimate intimate doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting my window is a</p>
<p>seven hour period but here&rsquo;s the things</p>
<p>that are happening I have weird urine</p>
<p>odor I&rsquo;m not losing anything there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>changes in my clothing or when I measure</p>
<p>myself I have ordered your goal bladder</p>
<p>program I&rsquo;ve done I also take your d3</p>
<p>with k2 I take vitamin C Omega threes I</p>
<p>take iodine because of the sea salts I</p>
<p>use as no iodine in it and I also take</p>
<p>450 milligrams of magnesium got it other</p>
<p>question for you do you find that if you</p>
<p>get from a seated position you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting down like in the couch and you</p>
<p>get up is it hard to get up from a</p>
<p>seated position no okay so you you have</p>
<p>pretty strong legs or is it or do you</p>
<p>have some no actually okay so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>interesting that you ask that I do have</p>
<p>very bad varicose veins in one leg okay</p>
<p>all right so here&rsquo;s a couple tips Susan</p>
<p>when you when you reach the age of</p>
<p>menopause things obviously kind of</p>
<p>become more more difficult because of</p>
<p>the ratio of muscle to fat especially if</p>
<p>in the lower extremity it sounds like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re able to get up from a</p>
<p>seated position so there&rsquo;s probably some</p>
<p>strength there and then now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to lose the weight what I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to recommend is to shift your goal for</p>
<p>about two or three months and don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>look at your scale what happens is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the whole philosophy that I talk</p>
<p>about you have to get healthy first if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been addicted to sugar like I</p>
<p>have as well my whole life and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re coming back and oh my gosh that</p>
<p>just shuts down the entire system I mean</p>
<p>it really makes it difficult especially</p>
<p>with insulin I would look for other</p>
<p>indicators of improvement because this</p>
<p>might be a little bit longer process for</p>
<p>you to see the changes that you want</p>
<p>simply because what you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with this extreme maybe</p>
<p>insulin resistant problem so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably why you&rsquo;re not even showing</p>
<p>signs and you&rsquo;re in your clothes yet</p>
<p>because the muscle actually is healing</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s awesome that you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>in a minute fasting I think you said a</p>
<p>seven-hour window I think what you need</p>
<p>to do now is two things to focus on one</p>
<p>is if your urine is that concentrated</p>
<p>that tells me that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably releasing the ketones and so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting this process but you</p>
<p>need to really beef up the vegetables to</p>
<p>the point of so it&rsquo;s counter or some of</p>
<p>the fat that&rsquo;s coming out of your body</p>
<p>or the or the ketones just to flush that</p>
<p>out so that&rsquo;s one thing number two I</p>
<p>would start inching your eating window</p>
<p>from seven to six to five to four</p>
<p>because those people that have a very</p>
<p>stuck metabolism honestly need to do one</p>
<p>meal per day that&rsquo;s the idea of seen so</p>
<p>just because what we&rsquo;re dealing with is</p>
<p>like cement I mean it just is not</p>
<p>budging so keep pushing the meals</p>
<p>together to the point where it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know four hours and then two hours and</p>
<p>then one hour you&rsquo;re eating for that one</p>
<p>hour a day I promise when you get to</p>
<p>that level you&rsquo;re going to start finally</p>
<p>seeing a lot more changes because the</p>
<p>body just has to heal and what you&rsquo;re up</p>
<p>against is duration of time and how</p>
<p>chronic the problem is all right thanks</p>
<p>Susan okay Adi do we have any questions</p>
<p>in social we have come to the pike yes</p>
<p>we do first of all there are a lot of</p>
<p>greetings from around the world</p>
<p>you know Germany India Canada Atlanta</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all saying hello to you oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>yes so on YouTube Nava is asking what</p>
<p>can you do about bad breath on keto okay</p>
<p>the bad breath is really too much</p>
<p>protein so what we have to do is limit</p>
<p>the amount of protein</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming maybe you&rsquo;re doing six</p>
<p>ounces which each meal do three ounces</p>
<p>that should totally handle it and then</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for a small like let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t handle it then you want to</p>
<p>also add more vegetables and chlorophyll</p>
<p>maybe even like the wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>powder that&rsquo;s kind of a purifier to help</p>
<p>clean out the system but yeah this is a</p>
<p>short-term it&rsquo;s a temporary thing and</p>
<p>that should improve like cut down your</p>
<p>protein okay do we have another question</p>
<p>yes we do we have Donna on Facebook from</p>
<p>Tennessee and she&rsquo;s asking what can you</p>
<p>do when you don&rsquo;t have gall bladder well</p>
<p>what you can do is you they have some</p>
<p>spares at the hospital if you go there</p>
<p>they have plastic ones that you can have</p>
<p>reinserted and then you can hook them up</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll be fine I&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>totally sarcastic now what you have to</p>
<p>do if you don&rsquo;t have a gall bladder use</p>
<p>now you have a tube that trickles the</p>
<p>bile through this little tube to your</p>
<p>small intestine so that you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>compromised a little bit because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna have the full capacity of the</p>
<p>digestion of the fat type of vitamins so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna recommend considering getting</p>
<p>a gall bladder formula that has the bile</p>
<p>salts that you can then take after a</p>
<p>meal</p>
<p>one and that will supply what&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>so you can get the full 100% absorption</p>
<p>of the fat side with vitamin C you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>end up with vitamin A deficiency is</p>
<p>vitamin A D and K deficiencies okay and</p>
<p>then also there&rsquo;s a really cool little</p>
<p>chart that you can get this here is a</p>
<p>little thing I put together in my spare</p>
<p>time which allows you to look at all the</p>
<p>nutrients that our body needs and what</p>
<p>foods are very high in those nutrients</p>
<p>in the correct amounts because at the</p>
<p>end of the day we need to satisfy the</p>
<p>nutrient requirements so if you want to</p>
<p>copy this there&rsquo;s a link down below</p>
<p>click it and you can get an instant</p>
<p>download all right it&rsquo;s a really cool</p>
<p>little reference because as you look at</p>
<p>the foods you may not be eating these</p>
<p>foods in the right quantities and ending</p>
<p>up with deficiency so health is really</p>
<p>about getting all the nutrients from the</p>
<p>food so very cool down though check it</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>okay so Adi yeah</p>
<p>we are gonna ask our first question I</p>
<p>got three questions to ask everyone and</p>
<p>see if they can get this right this time</p>
<p>not that they didn&rsquo;t get it right last</p>
<p>time but okay so here&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>question Noddy what is the food that has</p>
<p>the highest vitamin C not an herb but an</p>
<p>actual food what has the highest vitamin</p>
<p>C of all the foods type in your answer</p>
<p>now and then after this question that I</p>
<p>asked we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll see if they get it</p>
<p>right okay all right good now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to Josephine Josefina from New</p>
<p>York you had a question you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>sleeping that well good morning that</p>
<p>good morning I am since I started to</p>
<p>indicate Italian about a year ago</p>
<p>yeah my sleep is night if I&rsquo;m not doing</p>
<p>well with my sleep I&rsquo;m very happy with</p>
<p>my weight loss and and I have another</p>
<p>question I would be intimate in fasting</p>
<p>mmm I have read a lot that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend doing it every day mm-hmm a</p>
<p>woman and I have been doing it every day</p>
<p>as you suggested and it have been very</p>
<p>successful but I would like to know what</p>
<p>is your thought on what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that we shouldn&rsquo;t do it every day</p>
<p>because of hormonal issues yeah someday</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna find out who they are because</p>
<p>they are kind of a generality sometimes</p>
<p>you you see this piece of information</p>
<p>there is so much data on the internet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so conflicting like you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>be totally confused so so main thing you</p>
<p>have to realize is the source of who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>telling you that you know especially if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some site that&rsquo;s a new site you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get it&rsquo;s just random calm as far</p>
<p>as information you&rsquo;re just gonna get</p>
<p>these things all your hormones will</p>
<p>really will explain to me why you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to do it every day how</p>
<p>would that hurt your hormones because</p>
<p>your your body just you putting your</p>
<p>body in fat-burning so why would that</p>
<p>hurt your hormones it just doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>any sense but here&rsquo;s the thing to</p>
<p>evaluate someone that&rsquo;s not losing</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>off of just one thing it&rsquo;s hard so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna ask you some questions do you have</p>
<p>any leg cramps</p>
<p>get cramps in your calf if you point</p>
<p>your toe no okay good</p>
<p>do you have any digestive issues I used</p>
<p>to have digestive issues but since I</p>
<p>started doing your program I my main</p>
<p>issue with diarrhea but I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that anymore</p>
<p>okay I will say that I have a little</p>
<p>constipation but when I eat the right</p>
<p>amount of vegetables that you suggest</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no constipation awesome okay so</p>
<p>then what about do you have any other</p>
<p>body issues like inflammation fatigue</p>
<p>anything else the what I can think about</p>
<p>is my in the afternoon I tend to get</p>
<p>Moody</p>
<p>okay Oh angry like there&rsquo;s a because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not eating any type of hydric got.all</p>
<p>and then do you do you crave any sweets</p>
<p>I do I do but I&rsquo;m sorry I think I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>disciplined I look crazy wait so thank</p>
<p>you you just gave me the biggest clue</p>
<p>that I wanted okay so if you&rsquo;re craving</p>
<p>sweets and you&rsquo;ve been doing this for a</p>
<p>year there&rsquo;s something not right because</p>
<p>the cravings sort of went away that</p>
<p>means you&rsquo;re not fully into keto or</p>
<p>fat-burning you&rsquo;re not running your body</p>
<p>on fat that&rsquo;s probably why you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>seeing the change probably sleep is not</p>
<p>helping but your cravings shouldn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to wait right now so what I would do you</p>
<p>you may have the book you may not you</p>
<p>may be consistent with it you may not I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know but I would go back find out</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing everything correctly</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re doing the consistent</p>
<p>vegetables in the protein the fat and</p>
<p>then plug in the basics hardcore because</p>
<p>one of the things about this program is</p>
<p>when you do it partially it really just</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t work at all because the the</p>
<p>reason why you&rsquo;re getting moody in the</p>
<p>middle of the day is because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re experiencing the symptoms of</p>
<p>hypoglycemia which means you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>running on the sugars which could be why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not sleeping too so to get you</p>
<p>into the ketones which which is a</p>
<p>completely different fuel source you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to do the highs and lows your mood</p>
<p>will be very very high so that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really big clue so there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing that you should do that</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what that is but I</p>
<p>would find out through the book because</p>
<p>you may have most the answers but not</p>
<p>the whole picture so that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>say as far as the sleep goes there is a</p>
<p>awesom sleep aid that you could take to</p>
<p>help you sleep that I have that I use to</p>
<p>but the last thing I want to tell you is</p>
<p>that when you do keto in them and</p>
<p>fasting the fuel source is double the</p>
<p>energy more than double the energy of</p>
<p>glucose so what happens is like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna give you more energy and the</p>
<p>problem is like you you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>have the as you won&rsquo;t require the same</p>
<p>amount of sleep as you you will when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually running on glucose or as</p>
<p>you were because glucose is requires</p>
<p>just a little bit more sleep so you</p>
<p>might have to add exercise in there you</p>
<p>might to get this energy out because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re generating more energy so but</p>
<p>before you even go there I would</p>
<p>actually get the basics in because I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ve got to do this until the</p>
<p>cravings go away and then we know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to work all right</p>
<p>thanks Josephine okay Dominica you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Texas you had a question about your</p>
<p>daily food yeah go ahead</p>
<p>hi that&rsquo;s a bird thank you for you first</p>
<p>of all it was very blessed to have you</p>
<p>share all this stuff with us but my</p>
<p>question is I&rsquo;ve been doing this for</p>
<p>three weeks almost almost a little bit</p>
<p>maybe a little bit more but I am NOT</p>
<p>losing weight so I&rsquo;m thinking that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing anything wrong and I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>what if I don&rsquo;t know if you can give me</p>
<p>like a basic three meal to meal plan</p>
<p>including the facts in it and my other</p>
<p>question was can you have decaf coffee</p>
<p>more than one cup okay if you have deep</p>
<p>good question and and then what do you</p>
<p>do when you cannot eat any earlier than</p>
<p>seven or eight o clock in the evening</p>
<p>and then have like you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat breakfast until twelve eleven twelve</p>
<p>drugs</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working wrong Dominika there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>two-question maximum so you went to</p>
<p>three so I&rsquo;m gonna have to oh wow just</p>
<p>kidding</p>
<p>so I have a question when when is the</p>
<p>are you hungry in the morning when you</p>
<p>wake up no not at all okay when&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>first meal I have three eggs and I have</p>
<p>about three and a half cups of spinach</p>
<p>with garlic when what time about 11:30</p>
<p>12:00 okay</p>
<p>are you hungry at the time no okay but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still eating yeah okay so one</p>
<p>thing that you want to do is don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>because you want to push that until</p>
<p>11:00 or or to or go as long as you can</p>
<p>and and then eat when you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>hungry because you&rsquo;re eating when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not hungry</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re specifically something I mean</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fast the way you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying that was supposed to do</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re fasting if you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>so all night long you&rsquo;re fasting in the</p>
<p>morning you&rsquo;re fasting and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you eat you stop the fasting so</p>
<p>okay if you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>going into 11 o&rsquo;clock or 12 because as</p>
<p>soon as you meet you spike insulin now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be hungry an hour later so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing number two are you are</p>
<p>you is your stomach shrinking a little</p>
<p>bit as your clothes making in your</p>
<p>stomach a little bit yep well my stomach</p>
<p>is shrinking a little bit yes but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not moving anymore I mean the shrunk a</p>
<p>little bit and that was it okay so after</p>
<p>this meal at 11:30 or 12:00 when&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>next meal I don&rsquo;t need until about 4:00</p>
<p>something like that okay are you hungry</p>
<p>or uh yeah kind of okay and then and</p>
<p>then do you eat do you have any snacks</p>
<p>in the middle of there or at night</p>
<p>no no snacks at all okay good and are</p>
<p>you eating enough are you eating like</p>
<p>the pattern of the vegetables and some</p>
<p>protein and</p>
<p>yes I&rsquo;m eating vegetables meeting like a</p>
<p>little bit of protein like 3/4 ounces of</p>
<p>protein but I&rsquo;m still not understanding</p>
<p>how you incorporate the fat in your diet</p>
<p>okay good</p>
<p>and then last question I have is how old</p>
<p>are you I am 56 okay so when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing and most of the clients that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working with our in their 50s or 60s so</p>
<p>this this fits exactly because it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know here these people that oh I did</p>
<p>keto for a week and I dropped 20 pounds</p>
<p>and like why can&rsquo;t I do that right well</p>
<p>the fact that you did get some shrinkage</p>
<p>in your clothes means it&rsquo;s starting to</p>
<p>work but you just need to tweak it and</p>
<p>you have to realize that your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably gonna have to build more</p>
<p>protein which weighs more as it&rsquo;s losing</p>
<p>fat so you&rsquo;re gonna kind of that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go buy weight loss watch my</p>
<p>video on weight loss weight loss is the</p>
<p>worst indicator for success because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t include the protein additions</p>
<p>which is heavy so because when you do it</p>
<p>in fasting you start gaining more muscle</p>
<p>mass and and that control everything off</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing don&rsquo;t eat until</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hungry go as long as you can okay</p>
<p>and then have your first meal now if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at 2 o&rsquo;clock great and then eat at</p>
<p>4 that would be awesome because then you</p>
<p>have this really short window you can go</p>
<p>at the key is getting a lot of fasting</p>
<p>between there and you&rsquo;ll actually start</p>
<p>seeing some better changes now you asked</p>
<p>a good question when you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>your body is eating your own fat so if</p>
<p>you add too much fat that could slow</p>
<p>things down a little bit especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through menopause so I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily add an additional</p>
<p>fat that&rsquo;s not already in there within</p>
<p>the proteins that you&rsquo;re eating so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you have a hamburger well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fat in there let&rsquo;s say you have some</p>
<p>nuts there&rsquo;s fat in there</p>
<p>avocado there&rsquo;s fat in there so don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>add more you can add some oil on your</p>
<p>salad dressing but and then let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having a hard time fasting well</p>
<p>then add a little more fat gradually so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a variable and I did a</p>
<p>video on this that you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>judge and everyone is so different some</p>
<p>people you have to do a lot of fat other</p>
<p>people they can&rsquo;t tolerate a lot so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not losing weight you want to cut</p>
<p>down the fat all right excellent</p>
<p>question and thank you for calling</p>
<p>all right howdy what do we have coming</p>
<p>in through some of the social media</p>
<p>channels here all right so for your</p>
<p>question we do have people saying kale</p>
<p>bell pepper papaya sauerkraut orange</p>
<p>parsley lemon wow those are some good</p>
<p>guesses hey can we have a drumroll</p>
<p>please okay and the answer is sauerkraut</p>
<p>okay so whoever said that is totally</p>
<p>right sauerkraut has seven audience Evan</p>
<p>hundred and fifty milligrams of vitamin</p>
<p>C per cup I mean all these other foods</p>
<p>have like less than a hundred but we</p>
<p>only need like seventy per day</p>
<p>milligrams but 700 so get out the</p>
<p>sauerkraut start chopping that down</p>
<p>there and then watch what happens to</p>
<p>your vitamin C is good for bleeding gums</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good for collagen it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>energy is good for an immune system okay</p>
<p>I was there really whoever guessed the</p>
<p>right was probably saw my video on that</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>hey guys if you don&rsquo;t have this document</p>
<p>download it it&rsquo;ll allow you to see all</p>
<p>the requirements that you need</p>
<p>nutritionally and what foods you need to</p>
<p>focus on there&rsquo;s a link below you can</p>
<p>check it out that&rsquo;s a good reference and</p>
<p>you can just keep it for future</p>
<p>reference okay so do we have a quick</p>
<p>question yes</p>
<p>another greetings from around the world</p>
<p>we have New Zealand Romania Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s done they&rsquo;re all saying hi to you</p>
<p>again that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>all right so on YouTube we have Erica</p>
<p>asking should you succeed some nuts</p>
<p>before you consume them should you soak</p>
<p>your seeds and nuts yes that&rsquo;s the ideal</p>
<p>scene excuse me because when you have</p>
<p>seeds and nuts that come with enzyme</p>
<p>inhibitors which basically block</p>
<p>digestion so if you can soak them</p>
<p>overnight in water drain it out dry them</p>
<p>out either a dehydrator I know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pain in the butt or the oven under low</p>
<p>temperatures you will get a high quality</p>
<p>product that won&rsquo;t inter will won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>nearly interfere with your digestive</p>
<p>system like raw nuts do so I recommend</p>
<p>that if</p>
<p>you can do that yes so that would answer</p>
<p>that question good do we have another</p>
<p>one yes we do we have Toby from Facebook</p>
<p>asking is Quito healthy for women no</p>
<p>just for men okay do we have any other</p>
<p>questions no yes it&rsquo;s healthy if you</p>
<p>actually have a body it&rsquo;s healthy for</p>
<p>your animals it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like if you</p>
<p>think about what the opposite of Quito</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s running at your body and glucose</p>
<p>right so that&rsquo;s like the most unhealthy</p>
<p>thing on the planet because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>susceptible to all the problems with</p>
<p>with glucose and since you brought that</p>
<p>up Audie I&rsquo;m gonna have to talk about</p>
<p>that for a second because when the</p>
<p>sugars go higher okay what happens is it</p>
<p>destroys the micro tiny little blood</p>
<p>vessels of the eye that go to the retina</p>
<p>so you start you start getting blurred</p>
<p>vision so if you start you notice that</p>
<p>your vision is not that great</p>
<p>could be that also cloudiness on the</p>
<p>lens that&rsquo;s called cataract also</p>
<p>pressure in the eye that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>glaucoma and then you have the little</p>
<p>tiny center of the back part of the eye</p>
<p>called the macula and get macular</p>
<p>degeneration and then also the high</p>
<p>sugar starts interfering with a little</p>
<p>lining in the arteries and you start</p>
<p>getting little holes where it&rsquo;s starting</p>
<p>to bleed then the immune system comes in</p>
<p>and you get a plaquing and then the</p>
<p>artery starts getting clogged and then</p>
<p>you get a clot that dis largest goes to</p>
<p>the brain you get a stroke or a heart</p>
<p>attack depending on where that clot is</p>
<p>going so that&rsquo;s kind of where people are</p>
<p>going if they&rsquo;re living on sugars and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having high sugar other than at</p>
<p>to be totally fine not to mention I</p>
<p>forgot to talk about then the brain you</p>
<p>actually start up the brain of oxygen</p>
<p>you kill off the neurons kill up the</p>
<p>nerves on the toes and the fingers you</p>
<p>do get some gangrene but they can just</p>
<p>you know remove that limb and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be good to go so the alternative</p>
<p>is running your body on ketones which is</p>
<p>much healthier so you can actually</p>
<p>regrow your brain get new brain cells I</p>
<p>mean who wouldn&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>better mood better energy increase</p>
<p>longevity better heart reversing heart</p>
<p>damage and avoiding cancer not too bad</p>
<p>alright so we&rsquo;re gonna go to Derek he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been waiting click you&rsquo;re from Queens</p>
<p>New York you had a question about bone</p>
<p>structure go ahead</p>
<p>hey dr. Burke how are you hi good</p>
<p>I actually I read your book for the</p>
<p>second time and it you know you are</p>
<p>absolutely right it is you really notice</p>
<p>so many more things and it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>terrific book I give it as a gift to</p>
<p>people on their birthday because I mean</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s probably the best gift I</p>
<p>could really give them awesome thank you</p>
<p>and hopefully they definitely you know</p>
<p>read it awesome dr. Burke I&rsquo;m following</p>
<p>you I&rsquo;ve been calling you you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>helping me tremendously you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>helping me for months you know I call</p>
<p>basically every week and now my</p>
<p>situation is all my digestive</p>
<p>gallbladder issues and everything you</p>
<p>know I drink a high pH water as I told</p>
<p>you and and it led to leaky gut and from</p>
<p>there just problem after problem and now</p>
<p>I got some x-rays back that basically</p>
<p>say I guess it&rsquo;s their thing I probably</p>
<p>have psoriatic arthritis and I have let</p>
<p>me just read this small sentence for you</p>
<p>it says appearance of peri articular</p>
<p>osteopenic changes most notably around</p>
<p>the mCP and p IP joints which could</p>
<p>reflect degree of joint inflammation</p>
<p>hyperemia or synovitis other otherwise</p>
<p>preserved joint spaces and no joint</p>
<p>margin erosion at this time okay all</p>
<p>right so let&rsquo;s talk about that and when</p>
<p>you said it because I actually read my</p>
<p>book again a second time because I</p>
<p>actually did these videos on there I was</p>
<p>like I was actually amazed that I had a</p>
<p>lot of great information in there I was</p>
<p>like wow I mean I was just impressed at</p>
<p>how much data is crammed into there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no fluff I&rsquo;m like every sentence</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure that it gave</p>
<p>people the exact thing they need to know</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s what you need to do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>problems with inflammation in the distal</p>
<p>joints and the actual other joints of</p>
<p>the hand and the fingers so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things that you want to do you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably on the right track cuz you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing intermittent fasting which is</p>
<p>going to help recycle proteins and</p>
<p>damaged parts drop inflammation and</p>
<p>clean up a lot of old microbes in the</p>
<p>body but in the meantime a lot of these</p>
<p>like psoriatic arthritis has is a</p>
<p>combination of a couple things one is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a underlying microbial kind of</p>
<p>infection going on the body so I would</p>
<p>take oregano oil tablets grapeseed</p>
<p>grapefruit seed extract tablets and</p>
<p>Thiem oil tablets those three that will</p>
<p>actually slowly kind of clean up any</p>
<p>deep microbes that are growing on the</p>
<p>body whether it&rsquo;s a nano bacteria small</p>
<p>one or a virus or microbe it kind of</p>
<p>just it helps with those things and then</p>
<p>the other thing that you want to do is</p>
<p>take k2 to help kind of remodel the</p>
<p>osteophytes that are or the little bone</p>
<p>spurs things that are going on on the</p>
<p>joints I think that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>with some d3 I think that would help you</p>
<p>but thanks for calling probably I think</p>
<p>probably you might have a problem with</p>
<p>k2 because you didn&rsquo;t have enough bile</p>
<p>in the past because the gall bladder but</p>
<p>I think that should improve with time</p>
<p>and if you can get to one meal a day I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll be doing better and better</p>
<p>over time thanks Darren I&rsquo;ll talk to you</p>
<p>next week okay so we have a Azima is</p>
<p>calling from Canada British Columbia you</p>
<p>had a question about macular</p>
<p>degeneration right I do I do</p>
<p>first of all I just want to tell you</p>
<p>that I am I am thrilled to be talking to</p>
<p>you I&rsquo;m really excited Thanks</p>
<p>yeah yeah no you&rsquo;re great I have a</p>
<p>background in kinesiology and I&rsquo;m had to</p>
<p>do lots of nutrition stuff and so I just</p>
<p>really appreciate the way that you</p>
<p>explain things and it&rsquo;s a thoroughness</p>
<p>and I really love your program so thank</p>
<p>you oh you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>yeah okay so here&rsquo;s my question</p>
<p>I do have macular degeneration I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>it for about 12 years and in the last</p>
<p>couple of months it&rsquo;s been getting worse</p>
<p>which is totally freaking me out</p>
<p>my mom died of cancer and she said you</p>
<p>know macular degeneration is way worse</p>
<p>than cancer so my vision is getting</p>
<p>worse particularly in one eye and so I</p>
<p>started taking fish or salmon liver oil</p>
<p>and cod liver oil and vital lux as a</p>
<p>supplement also that my ophthalmologist</p>
<p>has suggested and I not bad with</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables I try to do</p>
<p>fairly well with the 7 cups of</p>
<p>vegetables a day I don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gallbladder I take your gallbladder</p>
<p>formula and I have transverse myelitis</p>
<p>on top of all this other stuff so there</p>
<p>which is an inflammatory autoimmune</p>
<p>disease so my question is with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting well first of all</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not positive about whether I need to</p>
<p>be taking these supplements with food or</p>
<p>not and is there some food that is okay</p>
<p>to do with intermittent fasting that</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t disturb that that&rsquo;s question</p>
<p>number one should I stop there and let</p>
<p>you answer that one yeah okay good so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna because there&rsquo;s a quite a few</p>
<p>calls I&rsquo;m just gonna focus on this</p>
<p>because I think this is gonna be really</p>
<p>important there&rsquo;s things that are like</p>
<p>really important and there&rsquo;s things that</p>
<p>are trivial I&rsquo;m just going to talk about</p>
<p>the important things to prevent macular</p>
<p>degeneration you want to keep your</p>
<p>Sugar&rsquo;s low okay you want to keep</p>
<p>Sugar&rsquo;s low so obviously it probably</p>
<p>started the whole process by having</p>
<p>instant resistance I figure high insulin</p>
<p>and that attacks this micro vessels of</p>
<p>the back of the eye the retina and the</p>
<p>macula which is the little central part</p>
<p>of the retina which is the extension of</p>
<p>your brain so it&rsquo;s quite like</p>
<p>neurological tissue that&rsquo;s affected so</p>
<p>there is probably a little DEMA in there</p>
<p>some degeneration so you know what per</p>
<p>text what protects the parts of the body</p>
<p>from the high sugar are like vitamin b1</p>
<p>the minerals and phytonutrients so now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at the stage where you want to</p>
<p>kind of reverse some of that and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>correct you you&rsquo;re taking the</p>
<p>cruciferous you&rsquo;re taking hopefully the</p>
<p>kale shake I would do a chaos&rsquo; shake</p>
<p>every single day but here&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>the key nutrient in kale that you need</p>
<p>is the carotenoids that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>phytonutrient and the carotenoids are</p>
<p>fat soluble the fact that you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a gallbladder means that you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>not able to extract those Kratt no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like someone else so you don&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>benefit of the kale so what you need to</p>
<p>do is when you consume the kale shake</p>
<p>put a little bit of coconut oil in there</p>
<p>drink this down take the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula with at the same time that way</p>
<p>we can add the bile salts in there and</p>
<p>the kale and the fat and that will</p>
<p>actually help increase the solubility of</p>
<p>the fat soluble carotenoids that&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>into the eye and I think that will be</p>
<p>the biggest thing that will help you you</p>
<p>want to do in a minute fasting hardcore</p>
<p>you want to do key to hardcore to drop</p>
<p>that insulin and by the way before</p>
<p>someone can actually have high sugar</p>
<p>they first have high insulin but the</p>
<p>doctors never test that so the first</p>
<p>stage of even this whole chain of events</p>
<p>is high insulin and a bunch of symptoms</p>
<p>that normal blood sugar so then what</p>
<p>happens over time the blood sugars start</p>
<p>going up so as soon as the blood sugars</p>
<p>go up it means that you&rsquo;ve already had</p>
<p>pre-diabetes for a long time so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a side note so and that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to do is kind of</p>
<p>reverse all this stuff but macular</p>
<p>degeneration is probably almost a</p>
<p>hundred percent caused by high sugar</p>
<p>thanks for your question okay we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to Adi for a question on social</p>
<p>media all righty</p>
<p>on YouTube Daniel is asking can you do</p>
<p>keto if you&rsquo;re vegetarian yeah you can</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just there just it&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>more difficult because it&rsquo;s hard to find</p>
<p>the high fat low carb thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna be hard but you can still</p>
<p>do it I am gonna be creating some</p>
<p>recipes on the website for you to do</p>
<p>that and then some additional data</p>
<p>working on that it&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>focusing on so many other things so but</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s you can totally do</p>
<p>it how do you suggest that you do it</p>
<p>yeah good any other questions yes again</p>
<p>on YouTube Emma</p>
<p>asking what is MCT oil MCT is a type of</p>
<p>oil it&rsquo;s a medium chain triglyceride</p>
<p>which that probably doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>anything to you but it&rsquo;s a type of fat</p>
<p>that gives you energy and it helps fat</p>
<p>burning and it&rsquo;s very gentle on the</p>
<p>liver and it&rsquo;s extracted from coconuts</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>mainly I think you can also get it from</p>
<p>palm well but so that&rsquo;s the type of fat</p>
<p>that can actually improve ketosis and</p>
<p>yeah it doesn&rsquo;t convert to fat in your</p>
<p>body okay okay so now again if you did</p>
<p>not download this thing download it now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a link down below it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>cool and it gives you like exactly the</p>
<p>foods that are highest in the nutrient</p>
<p>and then the quantity because I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be surprised how much of a</p>
<p>certain food that you need to reach your</p>
<p>your minimal requirements for your</p>
<p>nutrients and this is for a healthy body</p>
<p>not to me not even talking about an</p>
<p>unhealthy body</p>
<p>alright so guess what we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>the next question right here for</p>
<p>everyone</p>
<p>Adie we&rsquo;re gonna ask them this question</p>
<p>what has more vitamin a seven cups of</p>
<p>kale or one egg yolk go ahead and type</p>
<p>your answers down below what has more</p>
<p>vitamin A okay see if people can get</p>
<p>that one alright so now we&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>to Alex from California go ahead you had</p>
<p>a question but I recently got the</p>
<p>thyroid hyper and I&rsquo;m losing a lot of</p>
<p>hair so I want to start to fix those</p>
<p>things and I don&rsquo;t know where to start I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know and I have gold stone I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if I could do the keto diet with</p>
<p>that I got it so you have a hyper</p>
<p>thyroid yeah it would&rsquo;ve been a lot</p>
<p>easier if you had a hypo so this is that</p>
<p>he might</p>
<p>because by my pregnancy because what</p>
<p>cause one of the causes of gall stones</p>
<p>is high estrogen so I think for you you</p>
<p>definitely needed to do the keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting for sure there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>doubt there&rsquo;s not gonna be a problem you</p>
<p>just can&rsquo;t take the gall bladder formula</p>
<p>with the purified bile salts because</p>
<p>that will increase the conversion of</p>
<p>thyroid and you&rsquo;ll have more hyper and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to take trace minerals or</p>
<p>iodine that being said you definitely</p>
<p>want to start consuming the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables to help balance your estrogen</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables help lower the</p>
<p>bad estrogen and and increase the good</p>
<p>so they help regulate the ratios they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like give you more estrogen even</p>
<p>though they&rsquo;re a final estrogen it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re raising your</p>
<p>estrogen levels you&rsquo;re taking what you</p>
<p>already have and balancing them but</p>
<p>going through birth or actually giving</p>
<p>birth you&rsquo;re gonna actually create a</p>
<p>problem with high levels of estrogen and</p>
<p>that probably caused the gall stones so</p>
<p>I would consume the cruciferous dookied</p>
<p>oh and then fasting and then see if you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t normalize a thyroid and then once</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s normalized and then add the</p>
<p>purified bile salts to help dissolve the</p>
<p>stones but in the meantime by doing keto</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>naturally actually help concentrate your</p>
<p>bile and your stones may just disappear</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>thank you for your question all right</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re gonna go to Minnesota it&rsquo;s n</p>
<p>ng ah a if I&rsquo;ve just chopped</p>
<p>I actually made chopped liver on your</p>
<p>name but you&rsquo;re from Stillwater</p>
<p>Minnesota go ahead hey hey doctor what</p>
<p>buddy I know my name is you know</p>
<p>difficult to pronounce my name is</p>
<p>Anjaneya gonna call you on Jim Kazmir on</p>
<p>okay yeah Angela wood okay good so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from I&rsquo;m from your land with</p>
<p>10,000 mosquitos go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question oh oh yeah okay I&rsquo;m talking on</p>
<p>behalf of my wife and you know she</p>
<p>started you know following you and you</p>
<p>know doing the keto diet so before that</p>
<p>you know she was having a lot of birds</p>
<p>getting and then we went to</p>
<p>dr. Thalia still got a gallbladder stone</p>
<p>and they advised us to take the</p>
<p>gallbladder store you know gallbladder</p>
<p>out but you know my wife need to know or</p>
<p>to know we want her to know so is there</p>
<p>any alternate solution before taking the</p>
<p>gallbladder out to control Harbor</p>
<p>good question okay good so this is talk</p>
<p>about the gallbladder it would be nice</p>
<p>to keep your organs I&rsquo;m always for</p>
<p>keeping your organs than taking them out</p>
<p>so this is just food for thought</p>
<p>information to research I&rsquo;m not telling</p>
<p>you to do this I&rsquo;m not your doctor but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some data on the gallbladder gall</p>
<p>stones come from a lack of bile be il e</p>
<p>by doing you in a minute fasting you</p>
<p>will actually increase the concentration</p>
<p>of your mouth so that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>which will actually help dissolve stones</p>
<p>over time what also triggers bile is</p>
<p>saturated fats well guess what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be doing on the key dough</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to increase your saturated</p>
<p>fats but I&rsquo;m sure you heard that at</p>
<p>eating fats are bad right well only if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating carbs with it rooting fat</p>
<p>saturated fats without the carbs it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally healthy it&rsquo;s not a problem it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the carbs that are causing the golf</p>
<p>stones the sugar the refined</p>
<p>carbohydrates in the form of breads</p>
<p>pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles</p>
<p>pancakes muffins sodas juice alcohol and</p>
<p>Mad Dog 2020 which I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>drinking but the point is that that pain</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s going on the right side and</p>
<p>the chest is coming from probably a</p>
<p>congested gallbladder if she does this</p>
<p>and it consumes a lot of vegetables I</p>
<p>think that will be the best thing for</p>
<p>her and she may not need to take that</p>
<p>thing out but I would definitely also</p>
<p>recommend gall bladder formula it has</p>
<p>the purified bile salts take after the</p>
<p>meal so you can actually help take the</p>
<p>pressure off that area of your body okay</p>
<p>all right so Adi what do we have as an</p>
<p>answer for the question what has more</p>
<p>vitamin a seven cups of kale or one egg</p>
<p>yolk what are people saying a lot of</p>
<p>people are saying egg yolk how do you</p>
<p>guys know this you&rsquo;re just so you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>smart okay so yes but you know what Oh</p>
<p>thanks little delayed but yeah egg yolk</p>
<p>the egg egg yolk has active form of</p>
<p>retinol which is active vitamin A all</p>
<p>the vegetable types of vitamin A</p>
<p>especially kale is a pre vitamin A that</p>
<p>you have to convert so there&rsquo;s no active</p>
<p>form of vitamin A and Cal this all pre</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s actually a lot of pre</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like 30,000 international units</p>
<p>of pre vitamin a in one cup of kale</p>
<p>which then has to convert but you only</p>
<p>convert a small percentage now the</p>
<p>benefit of kale comes in a lot of other</p>
<p>ways but the point is that egg yolks are</p>
<p>one of the best sources of vitamin A</p>
<p>okay Wow</p>
<p>I guess that right okay so do we have</p>
<p>any questions coming on social media we</p>
<p>do so Facebook CJ is asking what caused</p>
<p>this key to rush kiddo rash is a</p>
<p>misnomer it should be named in a minute</p>
<p>fasting rash because what happens when</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t eat and you fast it puts in</p>
<p>your body and this interesting survival</p>
<p>mechanism it&rsquo;s called the tofu G where</p>
<p>your body now recycles old damaged junky</p>
<p>proteins but it also helps to dismantle</p>
<p>and clean up all the microbes pathogens</p>
<p>like fungus mold bacteria virus yeast</p>
<p>and Candida and so it cleans up all this</p>
<p>stuff out of the system through the</p>
<p>little garbage disposal your cells</p>
<p>already have many self-cleaning ovens</p>
<p>and they just clean all this garbage out</p>
<p>and then they spit them out for a</p>
<p>recycler into new little parts so your</p>
<p>body can then build new tissue it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called remodeling so you have like a</p>
<p>repair center that and a construction</p>
<p>unit in your cells that start building</p>
<p>new kitchens and new furniture and</p>
<p>things like that but if your system is</p>
<p>sluggish it can create immune reactions</p>
<p>to the point where it can create a rash</p>
<p>in the skin so there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>you can do because it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>histamine reaction which causes that</p>
<p>from the immune thing so what you want</p>
<p>to do is take bentonite clay on an empty</p>
<p>stomach just a little bit and that</p>
<p>should actually help clear it up</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really what kita rashes okay</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna call it in a fasting rash</p>
<p>good so let&rsquo;s say do we have any other</p>
<p>questions yes we do again on Facebook we</p>
<p>have Khalid asking if you have high</p>
<p>cholesterol can you still do the keto</p>
<p>diet well you need to do keto if</p>
<p>especially if you have high cholesterol</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to lower cholesterol</p>
<p>because what causes high cholesterol is</p>
<p>high amounts of insulin and sugar so</p>
<p>what happens what people don&rsquo;t know is</p>
<p>that your body makes cholesterol and so</p>
<p>the more you eat the less it has to make</p>
<p>and how did you know how much the</p>
<p>cholesterol the body actually makes I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t a lot like 3,000 milligrams per</p>
<p>day that&rsquo;s equivalent to 300 strips of</p>
<p>bacon or 14 eggs or a pound of butter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how much cholesterol body makes</p>
<p>so why is it so bad if our body makes it</p>
<p>so we need it so to lower cholesterol</p>
<p>all you need to do is lower the</p>
<p>carbohydrates and guess what the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet is it&rsquo;s a low</p>
<p>carbohydrate diet it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;ll drop it</p>
<p>good question good do you have another</p>
<p>question yes we have ty on YouTube</p>
<p>asking about Omega 7 and kind of help</p>
<p>with insulin there there are a lot of</p>
<p>different omega fatty acids and Omega 7s</p>
<p>are really really good for immune</p>
<p>reaction immune system building so they</p>
<p>actually are kind of protect you against</p>
<p>certain inflammatory conditions immune</p>
<p>disorders</p>
<p>definitely autoimmune disorders like</p>
<p>lupus and things like that and you get</p>
<p>this as a supplement but but naturally</p>
<p>these Omega 7s are in the same family as</p>
<p>omega-3s as well if you consume those</p>
<p>foods so you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to</p>
<p>always just take it as a supplement good</p>
<p>question next question</p>
<p>righty we have on Facebook we have Laura</p>
<p>from Canada and she&rsquo;s asking if you do</p>
<p>the bulletproof coffee and stevia can</p>
<p>that break your fast you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting I</p>
<p>just did a study on coffee and I was</p>
<p>surprised to find that when you drink</p>
<p>coffee or ketones go up as long as you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put the sugar in it and but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do a more official study to see if</p>
<p>you actually add the bulletproof but</p>
<p>some of the people that were doing</p>
<p>bulletproof their ketones went up</p>
<p>because they had MCT oil in it so but I</p>
<p>also found that my sugars went up a</p>
<p>little bit too even though my ketones</p>
<p>went up so I&rsquo;m gonna tell you they they</p>
<p>probably will not break your fast that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my answer right now and I might change</p>
<p>it down the road but right now that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>answer so alright so let&rsquo;s go to Colleen</p>
<p>from Alberta Canada go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question yes good morning good morning</p>
<p>yeah I yeah I&rsquo;ve got a heck of a lot of</p>
<p>snow blow across the road oh I could</p>
<p>imagine Oh</p>
<p>so my issues are many and varies but so</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t cover them all but I did your</p>
<p>quiz and I need so much stuff I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>order before I did your quiz the</p>
<p>wheatgrass and I can&rsquo;t remember what</p>
<p>else is coming but it should be coming</p>
<p>within a couple days so I am on</p>
<p>synthroid the last time my level was</p>
<p>checked it was normal I am on valproic</p>
<p>acid for bipolar mood disorder I&rsquo;m more</p>
<p>on the depressed side and valium for</p>
<p>sleeping so will the drugs affect</p>
<p>ketosis I have been attempting to follow</p>
<p>the keto and the I T okay good well</p>
<p>first I want to say that I did take a</p>
<p>trip in college through Alberta and we a</p>
<p>friend of mine we took we found this guy</p>
<p>who sold these beer signs and beverage</p>
<p>mirrors and we bought a bunch of them we</p>
<p>were gonna go to Canada sell them out of</p>
<p>the back of his truck it was a crazy</p>
<p>idea and so we ended up not really</p>
<p>selling any of them so that was a</p>
<p>disaster but I got a chance to see</p>
<p>Canada and it&rsquo;s gorgeous Lake Louise and</p>
<p>Banff it&rsquo;s just gorgeous I just have</p>
<p>some great memories of that but I was in</p>
<p>charge of bringing in the tent and the</p>
<p>first night we went up there I got the</p>
<p>tent out and I realized I bought a pump</p>
<p>a pup tent of her kids</p>
<p>not an adult tent so we both try to</p>
<p>sleep in this tent and only cover half</p>
<p>of our body and so we start laughing for</p>
<p>probably three hours it was just</p>
<p>hysterical but anyway getting back to</p>
<p>your question bipolar is and depression</p>
<p>is is totally a blood sugar issue it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>insulin resistance because the way that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running your your brain on</p>
<p>glucose it can definitely drop your mood</p>
<p>because it creates a eventually a</p>
<p>hypoglycemic reaction in the cells so</p>
<p>the combination of fixing that will</p>
<p>bring up your mood so much I mean so</p>
<p>much it&rsquo;s going to blow your way in</p>
<p>addition to fixing insulin resistance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to pull more amino acids</p>
<p>into the cell you&rsquo;ll make more</p>
<p>neurotransmitters which will then</p>
<p>increase your serotonin and your</p>
<p>dopamine which is also then gonna</p>
<p>increase your mood so I think that is</p>
<p>your ultimate solution now the question</p>
<p>is will the medication interfere with</p>
<p>keto well here&rsquo;s the thing it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna basically cut to the core of</p>
<p>it so the need for that will be a lot</p>
<p>less so maybe just work with your doctor</p>
<p>on that but make sure you take a lot of</p>
<p>B vitamins and you&rsquo;re probably already</p>
<p>getting them in the mail and the</p>
<p>electrolytes I think you&rsquo;re in for a</p>
<p>really nice treat so I hope you call</p>
<p>back in about three weeks from now and</p>
<p>tell us your results because it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>definitely bring up your mood your</p>
<p>health your energy I&rsquo;m excited to hear</p>
<p>the results okay so now we&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>to Susan from Utah you had a question</p>
<p>about keto diet and a couple other</p>
<p>questions you had I&rsquo;ll just let you ask</p>
<p>them yes thank you so much I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>60 years old and I wrote a list down</p>
<p>here so we can go through it quickly and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a good renal body type I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>five months on your keto I love watching</p>
<p>your videos and stuff because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>helped me so much stay on it I have not</p>
<p>cheated it all Wow</p>
<p>I do two meals a day with intermittent</p>
<p>fasting 16 to 20 hours a day I&rsquo;ve only</p>
<p>lost 13 pounds so that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>frustrating for me I have five re issues</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on 200 mcg of fire of synthroid and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still always cold tired low-energy</p>
<p>you asked Susan from Florida if she</p>
<p>could get up and sit down and I was</p>
<p>really hoping she couldn&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to do that for four</p>
<p>years it&rsquo;s painful to walk upstairs and</p>
<p>when I sit down I have to use my hands</p>
<p>you know my arms to push myself up or</p>
<p>get help for the last six months now I</p>
<p>started Kido five months ago so a month</p>
<p>before I started Kido i started getting</p>
<p>leg cramps and charley horses waking me</p>
<p>up at night i went six weeks with three</p>
<p>hours of sleep at night because of the</p>
<p>intent attorney horses they were waking</p>
<p>me up several times several i&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>several at a time and as i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>stretch that one and that it would</p>
<p>happen in the muscle that was trying to</p>
<p>stretch and you know i can&rsquo;t contract or</p>
<p>spent expand my muscles at night because</p>
<p>the charley horse has happened and so</p>
<p>like from my waist down I&rsquo;m just my legs</p>
<p>feel like lad</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dead when I get out of bed and I</p>
<p>I have to after I walk around a bit then</p>
<p>they start to feel better are you taking</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking my electrolytes I well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking I&rsquo;m not taking electrolytes I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking the potassium I mean I used the</p>
<p>gall bladder formula I take the D D and</p>
<p>K to your sleep aid your wheatgrass</p>
<p>juice your potassium I take magnesium</p>
<p>calcium magnesium and calcium lactate I</p>
<p>take fish oil I could take catechol X B</p>
<p>I take selenium I stop it I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>tired of it you know we have diabetes</p>
<p>ramp in my family and so I I&rsquo;ve actually</p>
<p>stayed away from breads for the last 20</p>
<p>years so with doing this guy I think I</p>
<p>was probably close to pre-diabetic but</p>
<p>was doing this diet I had blood labs</p>
<p>taken about a month NASSCO my blood</p>
<p>Sugar&rsquo;s are perfect I mean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re great my potassium is perfect</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just not sleeping because I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>so much pain with my legs all the time</p>
<p>okay so like that I can&rsquo;t okay okay good</p>
<p>so let me just tell you a stinging</p>
<p>nettle root is a really good herb I</p>
<p>would start on that that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>overload you with more nutrients but the</p>
<p>thing that just stands out even more</p>
<p>than that is the electrolyte powder than</p>
<p>I have because you&rsquo;re describing a</p>
<p>severe electrolyte deficiency</p>
<p>because you potassium is the thing that</p>
<p>is probably needed so much to flood the</p>
<p>cells to help them relax so you could</p>
<p>sleep and I know they need a test and</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s normal but you have to realize</p>
<p>only 2% of all the potassium is in the</p>
<p>blood so unless they check it on the</p>
<p>inside of the cell it&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>show up so what you want to do is you</p>
<p>want to take the electrolytes and</p>
<p>probably double the dosage and take that</p>
<p>over a period of time that will help you</p>
<p>but the original reason why you have the</p>
<p>inflammation is because the insulin so</p>
<p>we need that start going to intimate</p>
<p>fasting maybe once a day because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to drop inflammation even better</p>
<p>so we have inflammation will be dropped</p>
<p>your muscles start working with the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder and then call us back</p>
<p>I think you should do really well if you</p>
<p>just give it a little more time and add</p>
<p>those two things in there alright guys</p>
<p>thank you for your attention and I will</p>
<p>see you next week have a great weekend</p>
<p>you</p>
