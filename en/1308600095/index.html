    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing cannabis,</p>
<p>also referred to as marijuana.</p>
<p>Cannabis includes many different compounds</p>
<p>that have profound impact on the brain and body.</p>
<p>So while many of you have probably heard of THC,</p>
<p>there are also compounds in cannabis</p>
<p>such as CBD, and of course,</p>
<p>there are different types or strains of cannabis,</p>
<p>including sativa strains and indica strains</p>
<p>and hybrid strains.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>nowadays there is also an entire literature,</p>
<p>meaning a scientific and medicinal literature</p>
<p>about type 1, type 2, and type 3 strains.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what all of that is and how they work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the medicinal applications</p>
<p>of different strains of cannabis</p>
<p>and combinations of cannabis strains,</p>
<p>as well as some of the potential health hazards</p>
<p>of cannabis use.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that any discussion about cannabis</p>
<p>has to be framed within the context</p>
<p>that the legality of cannabis varies tremendously</p>
<p>depending on where you are in the world.</p>
<p>So depending on which country you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and even which state you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>or which area within a country,</p>
<p>possessing and using and certainly selling cannabis</p>
<p>can be either highly illegal or entirely legal</p>
<p>or decriminalized or largely overlooked.</p>
<p>You, of course, are obligated to know</p>
<p>what those local laws are for you,</p>
<p>where you live and where you travel.</p>
<p>With that said, today&rsquo;s discussion really will include</p>
<p>a full picture as to where cannabis</p>
<p>and the various and even very specific compounds</p>
<p>within cannabis can be extremely useful</p>
<p>in the treatment of some ailments</p>
<p>and where certain compounds in cannabis</p>
<p>can be extremely dangerous for certain individuals to use,</p>
<p>in particular, individuals that have preexisting</p>
<p>genetic propensity for psychosis.</p>
<p>That theme is going to come up again and again,</p>
<p>but we are also going to talk about the role of cannabis</p>
<p>in anxiety, in depression,</p>
<p>both positive and negative effects.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about sex differences</p>
<p>in terms of women versus men</p>
<p>and how they react differently to cannabis.</p>
<p>And I would be entirely remiss</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t include a conversation about cannabis,</p>
<p>meaning THC, CBD, hybrid strains, et cetera,</p>
<p>in creativity and different modes of thinking</p>
<p>because as many of you probably know</p>
<p>or at least have heard about,</p>
<p>cannabis can impact the way that we think,</p>
<p>the types of memory systems we can access,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s called convergent and divergent thinking,</p>
<p>which is one way of conceptualizing</p>
<p>what is commonly referred to as creativity.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s discussion is going to include</p>
<p>a lot of information,</p>
<p>but I promise to make it clear and accessible to all of you,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you have a background</p>
<p>in biology or not.</p>
<p>And today&rsquo;s discussion will also be quite nuanced.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find me routinely reading directly</p>
<p>from specific research papers,</p>
<p>something that of course we always do on this podcast.</p>
<p>But today I&rsquo;m really going to dig into</p>
<p>some of the finer points of the methodology in papers</p>
<p>and some of the statistics that were used</p>
<p>and the specific populations of people that were studied.</p>
<p>Because as it turns out,</p>
<p>there are instances that we will discuss</p>
<p>in which the use of cannabis</p>
<p>can be immensely beneficial to one group</p>
<p>and yet can be entirely detrimental to another group,</p>
<p>even at equivalent dosages</p>
<p>and depending on a number of different factors.</p>
<p>So we will discuss what those factors are.</p>
<p>Just to give you a brief overview</p>
<p>of the kind of structure I&rsquo;m going to put on today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we will review, of course, cannabis and its various forms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the biology,</p>
<p>but we are going to really drill into how dosage,</p>
<p>that is the concentration of THC relative to CBD,</p>
<p>impacts whether or not cannabis</p>
<p>is going to have one effect or another.</p>
<p>We will also talk about the frequency of use,</p>
<p>daily use, multiple times per day use,</p>
<p>weekly use or monthly or occasional use,</p>
<p>we will also talk about different professions</p>
<p>and how some people may have a little bit more leeway</p>
<p>in terms of whether or not they decide to use cannabis</p>
<p>or any of its various component chemical constituents,</p>
<p>that is CBD or THC, et cetera.</p>
<p>And for other professions,</p>
<p>it might be entirely inappropriate</p>
<p>because of the particular kinds of cognitive tasks</p>
<p>those professions demand.</p>
<p>We will also talk about genetic predisposition,</p>
<p>again, sex differences, hormone effects.</p>
<p>And I will also touch on</p>
<p>what I think is the most important variable</p>
<p>in determining whether or not cannabis</p>
<p>is right or wrong for you.</p>
<p>And that is your age at which you are considering</p>
<p>starting or continuing use or ceasing use.</p>
<p>What I can assure you</p>
<p>is that by the end of today&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>you will have a quite thorough understanding of cannabis,</p>
<p>how it works, what it does,</p>
<p>what its potential benefits can be,</p>
<p>what its potential hazards are,</p>
<p>and whether or not it&rsquo;s right for you</p>
<p>and the people that you know.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>are critical to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about cannabis.</p>
<p>And when we refer to cannabis,</p>
<p>we are indeed referring to marijuana or the marijuana plant.</p>
<p>Now, cannabis plants come in different strains</p>
<p>or different varieties.</p>
<p>And those different strains</p>
<p>are indeed different genetic strains.</p>
<p>So just as animals and humans</p>
<p>have different genetic backgrounds</p>
<p>and they can be crossed to one another</p>
<p>to yield further genetic variation in the offspring,</p>
<p>plants can be hybridized to one another</p>
<p>in various ways through grafting</p>
<p>or through the use of different types of seed combinations,</p>
<p>et cetera, in order to generate different strains.</p>
<p>There are also naturally occurring differences</p>
<p>in the strains of plants,</p>
<p>and the cannabis plant is no exception.</p>
<p>So for instance, in the context of a discussion</p>
<p>about cannabis and its medicinal uses</p>
<p>and recreational uses,</p>
<p>we need to distinguish between the sativa variety,</p>
<p>the indica variety,</p>
<p>a variety called ruderalis that&rsquo;s not often discussed,</p>
<p>and hybrids of sativa, indica, and ruderalis.</p>
<p>Before diving into the different strains of cannabis</p>
<p>and how they impact the brain and body</p>
<p>both similarly and differently,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that the cannabis plant</p>
<p>contains a number of different psychoactive compounds.</p>
<p>Now, the most powerful of those compounds is THC.</p>
<p>The technical name for it</p>
<p>is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.</p>
<p>But THC, as I&rsquo;ll refer to it,</p>
<p>is just one of the psychoactive</p>
<p>and biologically active compounds within cannabis plants.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also CBD,</p>
<p>which is technically referred to as cannabidiol,</p>
<p>and cannabidiol, CBD, is known to be used</p>
<p>for things like pain management, anxiety management,</p>
<p>and other medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>We will talk about the efficacy of CBD for those purposes,</p>
<p>as well as some of, believe it or not,</p>
<p>some of the dangers of CBD,</p>
<p>depending on where it&rsquo;s sourced and the dosage, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got THC, CBD, and also CBN, or cannabinol.</p>
<p>CBN is less often discussed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to hear a lot less</p>
<p>about CBN-containing products out there,</p>
<p>CBN-containing medicines,</p>
<p>but it is relevant to today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>so it will come up a bit.</p>
<p>Now, I will be sure to provide more specificity</p>
<p>to what I&rsquo;m about to say,</p>
<p>but very broadly speaking,</p>
<p>THC is largely responsible</p>
<p>for the psychoactive effects of cannabis.</p>
<p>That is the changes in mood,</p>
<p>the changes in bodily state and sensation, et cetera.</p>
<p>Whereas CBD, and to some extent CBN,</p>
<p>have profound effects on the brain and body,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t tend to give people the sensation</p>
<p>of altered perception, altered mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>Some people might say they are not the component of cannabis</p>
<p>that quote-unquote gets you high.</p>
<p>Although today we will really drill</p>
<p>into what the high itself represents</p>
<p>in terms of chemical systems in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And what we will soon learn</p>
<p>is that what we think of as being high</p>
<p>actually includes a number of different changes</p>
<p>in the brain and body,</p>
<p>some of which can be best explained by CBD, not by THC,</p>
<p>which runs counter to what most people out there</p>
<p>know and believe.</p>
<p>So broadly speaking, we have THC, CBD, and CBN,</p>
<p>but I want to point out that the cannabis plant</p>
<p>has over 70, seven zero,</p>
<p>70 different psychoactive compounds,</p>
<p>many of which still have not been studied</p>
<p>in isolation and in detail.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a big future of research for cannabis</p>
<p>and for THC and THC-related psychoactive compounds,</p>
<p>as well as for CBD and CBN.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re mainly going to focus on THC and CBD,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>I should also point out that the cannabis plant</p>
<p>has over 400 biologically active compounds.</p>
<p>So these are biologically active compounds</p>
<p>that may or may not have psychoactive properties,</p>
<p>that may or may not be useful for pain relief, et cetera.</p>
<p>Again, there is a vast landscape for exploration</p>
<p>of the cannabis plant and of hemp</p>
<p>for what they include that could be beneficial to us</p>
<p>or detrimental to us.</p>
<p>So again, a lot more work to do.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to really try and stay on target</p>
<p>with what we already know</p>
<p>and where there are certain exciting mysteries</p>
<p>or intriguing mysteries about what we ought to explore more.</p>
<p>I will certainly highlight those.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the different strains</p>
<p>of the cannabis plant, sativa, indica, and ruderalis,</p>
<p>and explore how each of those</p>
<p>differentially impacts the brain and body.</p>
<p>Because therein, I think we can start to learn</p>
<p>a lot about this incredible plant</p>
<p>that is the cannabis plant.</p>
<p>And whether or not you are a user of cannabis</p>
<p>or whether or not you are entirely opposed to cannabis use,</p>
<p>understanding how cannabis works in the brain and body</p>
<p>itself is absolutely fascinating</p>
<p>and can teach you a lot about how your brain and body work</p>
<p>at a basic level,</p>
<p>and can tell you a lot about how your brain and body</p>
<p>will react to different life events</p>
<p>and how your mood is established and stabilized</p>
<p>and how your appetite is established and stabilized,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So we have the three major strains of cannabis,</p>
<p>sativa, indica, and ruderalis.</p>
<p>And for sake of today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>we can pretty much cross off ruderalis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not often consumed,</p>
<p>and components of ruderalis are not often consumed</p>
<p>for medicinal or recreational purposes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on sativa and indica.</p>
<p>People will consume the sativa variety of cannabis</p>
<p>either by edible or by smoking cannabis,</p>
<p>or they will consume the indica variety of cannabis,</p>
<p>again, by edible or by smoking cannabis,</p>
<p>or sometimes they will take it in a transdermal form</p>
<p>or a sublingual form.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of different ways</p>
<p>to get the cannabis into the body,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a clear distinction between sativa and indica</p>
<p>that actually shows up first in the structure of the plant.</p>
<p>At their extremes, meaning in a pure strain of sativa,</p>
<p>it tends to be a taller plant,</p>
<p>a longer stalk, believe it or not.</p>
<p>And actually the length of the leaves</p>
<p>is quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>Whereas the indica plant tends to be more short and stout.</p>
<p>And for those aficionados out there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you know a lot of the other specific features</p>
<p>of sativa versus indica.</p>
<p>But already what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is the same plant, cannabis,</p>
<p>with two very different morphologies or shapes.</p>
<p>You might say, well, why is this interesting</p>
<p>or important to how it affects me</p>
<p>or affects other people</p>
<p>for medicinal or recreational purposes?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that even though they are the same plant,</p>
<p>these two different genetic varieties,</p>
<p>because of the way that they grow</p>
<p>and the way they capture sunlight,</p>
<p>and the way, believe it or not,</p>
<p>that the different plants within that strain</p>
<p>interact with one another,</p>
<p>because believe it or not,</p>
<p>plants are interacting with one another,</p>
<p>they actually bring different elements</p>
<p>of the psychoactive compound to different components</p>
<p>within the leaves and the so-called buds.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that when consumed,</p>
<p>and when I say consumed, I want to be very clear,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily just mean oral consumption</p>
<p>or eating cannabis sativa by edible.</p>
<p>I also mean smoking it,</p>
<p>and that could be, you know, people will,</p>
<p>just like with tobacco,</p>
<p>the way that they bring the psychoactive components</p>
<p>into their bloodstream and into their brain and body</p>
<p>is to essentially heat the dried leaves</p>
<p>of the cannabis plant.</p>
<p>Then the heat liberates</p>
<p>some of the psychoactive components</p>
<p>that when inhaled into the lungs,</p>
<p>because the lungs include a lot of vasculature,</p>
<p>a lot of basically blood vessels and capillaries,</p>
<p>that the psychoactive components</p>
<p>are actually directly absorbed</p>
<p>from the lungs into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and they can cross into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and permeate throughout the body</p>
<p>and cross the so-called blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>burning the plant liberates the smoke</p>
<p>that contains the psychoactive compounds,</p>
<p>and those are inhaled into the lungs</p>
<p>and then get into the brain and body</p>
<p>and act on the brain and body.</p>
<p>And the major effect of sativa varieties</p>
<p>are to create a high, if you will,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m putting this in air quotes</p>
<p>for those of you that are listening,</p>
<p>but to also act as a stimulant.</p>
<p>The sativa varieties tend to make people</p>
<p>feel kind of invigorated, somewhat alert.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tend to be as much of a sedative</p>
<p>as some of the other varieties.</p>
<p>Some people report heightened sense of focus</p>
<p>or heightened sense of creativity.</p>
<p>We will talk a little bit later on</p>
<p>as to whether or not they actually</p>
<p>are achieving heightened levels of focus and creativity</p>
<p>or whether or not they just perceive themselves</p>
<p>to have heightened levels of focus and creativity.</p>
<p>The sativa varieties tend to make people</p>
<p>feel a little bit less susceptible</p>
<p>to pain and noxious stimuli,</p>
<p>which are basically stimuli that you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>So the sativa varieties are often prescribed</p>
<p>or are used in the recreational context</p>
<p>for pain management and relief.</p>
<p>Basically, the sativa variety is known to include</p>
<p>a sort of head-biased effect.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re talking about subjective effects.</p>
<p>And of course, these will vary</p>
<p>from one individual to the next.</p>
<p>Some people will smoke cannabis sativa</p>
<p>or ingest cannabis sativa orally,</p>
<p>and will feel an entirely different array of effects.</p>
<p>But most people, the majority of people</p>
<p>experience a sort of head-centered, high alertness,</p>
<p>focus, and a sense that they&rsquo;re more creative.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the indica varieties of cannabis.</p>
<p>And when people smoke or eat or ingest indica varieties,</p>
<p>the psychoactive components of indica,</p>
<p>and again, this is pure indica,</p>
<p>so not hybridized with sativa at all,</p>
<p>but just pure indica,</p>
<p>tend to lead to more full-bodied effects.</p>
<p>People report feeling more complete full-body relaxation,</p>
<p>more of a sedative effect.</p>
<p>Indica cannabis is often prescribed</p>
<p>and or used recreationally in order to achieve</p>
<p>a state of sleep or to help relieve anxiety.</p>
<p>So less of a stimulant effect.</p>
<p>And we will talk about why,</p>
<p>literally the underlying neural circuits</p>
<p>that lead to the sativa variety,</p>
<p>causing more of a elevated mood and a head high, if you will,</p>
<p>and the indica varieties being more full-body relaxation.</p>
<p>One of the ways to remember the distinction</p>
<p>between the effects of cannabis sativa and cannabis indica</p>
<p>was relayed to me by a friend who actually was a chronic,</p>
<p>meaning every day, all day,</p>
<p>consumer of marijuana.</p>
<p>He basically smoked marijuana for 20 years</p>
<p>before quitting about four or five years ago.</p>
<p>And he said that indica is often referred to as in the couch,</p>
<p>meaning laid back in the couch.</p>
<p>And that can help you remember</p>
<p>that the indica varieties of cannabis</p>
<p>do tend to be more sedative in their effects.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s sativa and there&rsquo;s indica,</p>
<p>and then now there are hybrid strains.</p>
<p>So marijuana growers and people who specialize</p>
<p>in creating novel varieties of the cannabis plant,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m using the words cannabis and marijuana</p>
<p>more or less interchangeably here.</p>
<p>They are very good at creating new strains of plant</p>
<p>that might be 25% sativa and 75% indica or vice versa,</p>
<p>or 50-50 or 90-10.</p>
<p>Essentially what&rsquo;s happening nowadays</p>
<p>is that through plant biology, plant genetics, I should say,</p>
<p>growers are getting quite efficient</p>
<p>at creating a variety of different strains</p>
<p>of the marijuana plant that give rise to very nuanced</p>
<p>and distinct effects on brain and body.</p>
<p>In fact, so much so that there&rsquo;s now a new nomenclature,</p>
<p>a new language emerging around cannabis</p>
<p>and the development of novel strains of cannabis</p>
<p>for medicinal and or recreational purposes.</p>
<p>And while this might sound a little bit medical</p>
<p>or a little bit clinical to some people,</p>
<p>believe it or not, this is the nomenclature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now typically used.</p>
<p>People still refer to the sativa, indica,</p>
<p>and hybrid strains, but there&rsquo;s now also a description</p>
<p>of so-called type one, type two, and type three strains</p>
<p>for any given sativa, indica, or hybrid strain, okay?</p>
<p>So just to put this clearly in your mind,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got sativa varieties, that is pure sativa varieties.</p>
<p>You have indica varieties, again, pure indica,</p>
<p>and then you have hybrid varieties.</p>
<p>And beneath each of those, you have type one, type two,</p>
<p>and type three strains of indica, sativa,</p>
<p>or hybrid varieties.</p>
<p>What are type one, type two, and type three?</p>
<p>Well, type one, type two, and type three strains</p>
<p>are strains that have varying amounts</p>
<p>or ratios of THC to CBD.</p>
<p>So for instance, type one strains,</p>
<p>so for instance, you could have a pure sativa type one,</p>
<p>or a type one pure sativa, or a type one indica.</p>
<p>Those are going to have the greatest amount of THC</p>
<p>relative to CBD.</p>
<p>And I really want to emphasize this,</p>
<p>understanding the ratio of THC to CBD</p>
<p>can help explain a lot or even predict a lot</p>
<p>about how a given strain of cannabis will impact somebody.</p>
<p>For instance, because THC is largely responsible</p>
<p>for the typical psychoactive components of cannabis.</p>
<p>So what I mean here is if somebody&rsquo;s ingesting sativa</p>
<p>and it routinely makes them feel more energized,</p>
<p>elevates their mood,</p>
<p>gives them a heightened sense of creativity,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what they experience,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re taking a type one version of that,</p>
<p>that means that it&rsquo;s quite rich in THC and very little CBD.</p>
<p>However, if they were to take a type one version of sativa</p>
<p>and it feels far too strong, like too much energy,</p>
<p>or they felt like there were too much in their head,</p>
<p>nowadays, there are strains of sativa</p>
<p>that have been genetically engineered.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean by an engineer tinkering away</p>
<p>with gene engineering in a kind of CRISPR creating mutants,</p>
<p>but literally by hybridizing,</p>
<p>crossing different plants to one another, okay?</p>
<p>Creating in a natural context,</p>
<p>the same way plants in the outside world</p>
<p>would sometimes hybridize to one another.</p>
<p>Creating a variety that&rsquo;s perhaps type two,</p>
<p>which is going to have less THC and more CBD,</p>
<p>or a type three, which is going to be very high CBD</p>
<p>and very little THC.</p>
<p>And the same is also true for the indica varieties.</p>
<p>So I want to make sure that everyone understands this</p>
<p>because it becomes very important</p>
<p>for understanding the biology of cannabis</p>
<p>and predicting positive versus negative effects of cannabis.</p>
<p>Sativa has this kind of stimulant-like effect</p>
<p>and tends to be more of a head high, if you will.</p>
<p>Indica tends to be more full body</p>
<p>than lead to more in the couch,</p>
<p>as I referred to it before, pun intended.</p>
<p>Deep relaxation, reduced insomnia, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now within each of those sativa and indica,</p>
<p>you have type one, type two, and type three.</p>
<p>And that has everything to do with how much THC,</p>
<p>which is the dominant psychoactive compound,</p>
<p>versus CBD, which has other effects mainly on the body,</p>
<p>but not so much on the brain</p>
<p>and modes of thinking and mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>How much THC versus CBD is present.</p>
<p>And again, type one is THC dominant,</p>
<p>type two, kind of equal ratios, if you will,</p>
<p>of THC and CBD and type three tend to be high CBD.</p>
<p>Okay, so already we&rsquo;ve got some categorization here</p>
<p>that hopefully isn&rsquo;t overwhelming to you,</p>
<p>but this turns out to be extremely important</p>
<p>if you want to understand how cannabis works</p>
<p>and predict the effects of cannabis.</p>
<p>Okay, so somewhat surprisingly,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to set aside cannabis.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to take what we know about sativa, indica,</p>
<p>type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going to set that aside for a moment.</p>
<p>Why would we do that?</p>
<p>Well, we have to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>why would any of these plants,</p>
<p>why would any of these compounds, THC, CBD,</p>
<p>sativa, indica, et cetera,</p>
<p>why would any of that have any effect on us at all?</p>
<p>And this discussion that we&rsquo;re about to have</p>
<p>very much resembles the discussion that we had</p>
<p>on a previous episode about nicotine.</p>
<p>Because as many of you know,</p>
<p>nicotine is a commonly used substance.</p>
<p>In fact, if we were to look at</p>
<p>the three most commonly used drugs,</p>
<p>alcohol will be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Many billions of people regularly use alcohol</p>
<p>or occasionally use alcohol.</p>
<p>Many billions of people also use nicotine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the second most consumed drug.</p>
<p>So more than 1 billion</p>
<p>and probably closer to 2 billion people consume nicotine.</p>
<p>And then the third most consumed drug</p>
<p>is cannabis in one form or another.</p>
<p>And many of you are probably shouting,</p>
<p>what about caffeine?</p>
<p>What about caffeine?</p>
<p>Well, in the context of drugs</p>
<p>and in particular addictive drugs,</p>
<p>caffeine doesn&rsquo;t quite rise to the list.</p>
<p>But if we were to look at caffeine</p>
<p>and include in that list,</p>
<p>caffeine would be above all of those.</p>
<p>Okay, but the most commonly used drugs are alcohol.</p>
<p>Second after that is nicotine and then cannabis.</p>
<p>Nicotine, as some of you may know,</p>
<p>if you listened to the episode on nicotine,</p>
<p>but even if you didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>nicotine comes from the tobacco plant.</p>
<p>And there are a few other plants that include nicotine.</p>
<p>And typically it&rsquo;s brought into the brain and body</p>
<p>by smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuffing tobacco,</p>
<p>or vaping nicotine.</p>
<p>Nicotine exists in the outside world in these plants,</p>
<p>the tobacco plants.</p>
<p>But the reason it has an effect on the body</p>
<p>is that there are so-called nicotinic receptors in the body.</p>
<p>Now those nicotinic receptors were named</p>
<p>after nicotine, the compound,</p>
<p>but they existed in the brain and body,</p>
<p>not because of the existence of a tobacco plant,</p>
<p>but because there are other chemicals in the body</p>
<p>that naturally occur, namely acetylcholine,</p>
<p>that bind the nicotine receptor.</p>
<p>Those chemicals such as acetylcholine</p>
<p>that bind the nicotinic receptor in your brain and body</p>
<p>create an enhanced sense of focus, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But nicotine from tobacco binds that same receptor,</p>
<p>but with much greater affinity</p>
<p>and therefore also creates a state of focus,</p>
<p>but a much greater one than we can achieve without nicotine.</p>
<p>Okay, so you can see the nicotine episode</p>
<p>if you want to learn more about that.</p>
<p>In a very similar way, all of our brains and bodies</p>
<p>from the time that we are conceived, believe it or not,</p>
<p>very shortly after conception, if we want to be accurate,</p>
<p>very early conception, when you were in the womb</p>
<p>and still now, if you&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>you have what are called cannabinoid receptors</p>
<p>because you also have endogenous cannabinoids.</p>
<p>What do we mean by that?</p>
<p>You have receptors which are like little parking spots</p>
<p>that are present on cells in your brain and body.</p>
<p>And what we call a ligand,</p>
<p>which is basically just a chemical that&rsquo;s released,</p>
<p>parks in that receptor</p>
<p>and causes a number of different biological effects.</p>
<p>Cannabis contains compounds</p>
<p>that also bind to those receptors.</p>
<p>But here I want to make a really clear distinction.</p>
<p>We have what are called endogenous ligands.</p>
<p>Those that just mean chemicals from within us</p>
<p>that we make naturally,</p>
<p>even if we never go near the cannabis plant</p>
<p>or any other source of cannabis,</p>
<p>we have chemicals that are created in us</p>
<p>that park in those receptors</p>
<p>and cause biological effects on mood, on perception,</p>
<p>on the immune system, on hunger, et cetera.</p>
<p>Again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,</p>
<p>we have these endogenous cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Endogenous cannabinoids are floating around in us</p>
<p>or I should say they are released in us in particular ways,</p>
<p>bind to these receptors and cause changes in mood,</p>
<p>appetite, et cetera.</p>
<p>They have many different effects on the brain and body.</p>
<p>We will talk about those.</p>
<p>But just like with nicotine,</p>
<p>there are substances in the outside world.</p>
<p>In this case, cannabis contains these substances.</p>
<p>So things like THC and like CBD</p>
<p>that when ingested by smoking or vaping</p>
<p>or by ingesting edibles</p>
<p>also will park in those same receptors,</p>
<p>the cannabinoid receptors and lead to biological effects.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a little bit misleading</p>
<p>because we call them cannabinoid receptors</p>
<p>as if they were there to bind cannabis.</p>
<p>Or just like we call the nicotine receptors</p>
<p>nicotinic receptors,</p>
<p>it makes it seem as if they were there</p>
<p>in order to bind nicotine from tobacco.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the way our brains and bodies evolved.</p>
<p>Our brains and bodies evolved for these receptors</p>
<p>to make use of chemicals that exist within us</p>
<p>called, again, endogenous chemicals.</p>
<p>And those endogenous chemicals lead to certain effects,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>The key thing here,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t understood anything I&rsquo;ve said up until now,</p>
<p>please understand this.</p>
<p>The key thing is that THC and CBD</p>
<p>and the other components of cannabis</p>
<p>bind to those receptors,</p>
<p>those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,</p>
<p>the ones that we naturally make,</p>
<p>with much greater affinity</p>
<p>and exert a vastly greater potency</p>
<p>and effect on mood and perception, et cetera,</p>
<p>than do our endogenous cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Another analogy that one could take</p>
<p>in order to understand this</p>
<p>would be hormones like testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>Many people, I would say all people,</p>
<p>make testosterone and estrogen to varying degrees.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to depend on whether or not you&rsquo;re male, female,</p>
<p>your age, whether or not you&rsquo;ve gone through puberty,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just take testosterone, for example.</p>
<p>There is testosterone circulating in your body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true if you&rsquo;re male or female.</p>
<p>And there are receptors called androgen receptors.</p>
<p>We could even call them testosterone receptors.</p>
<p>And the testosterone binds to those receptors</p>
<p>and has effects on cells.</p>
<p>It causes hair growth, changes the voice.</p>
<p>It can affect libido.</p>
<p>It affects all sorts of things in the brain and body,</p>
<p>depending on which organ and tissue you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But of course, there are people</p>
<p>that take synthetic testosterone</p>
<p>or derivatives of testosterone.</p>
<p>And some of those derivatives, for instance,</p>
<p>in the bodybuilding community, in the sports community,</p>
<p>they will take things like Dianabol.</p>
<p>These are modified versions of testosterone</p>
<p>that can bind to the testosterone receptor</p>
<p>with much greater affinity,</p>
<p>or I should say the androgen receptor,</p>
<p>with much greater affinity</p>
<p>and have supraphysiological effects,</p>
<p>effects that would essentially never be seen</p>
<p>from testosterone that was endogenously, excuse me,</p>
<p>endogenously released within the body.</p>
<p>We could say the same thing for estrogen.</p>
<p>There are estrogen receptors, they bind estrogen, okay?</p>
<p>But if someone were to take synthetic estrogen</p>
<p>or to ingest a plant compound</p>
<p>that contains various estrogenic compounds,</p>
<p>and those plants certainly exist out there,</p>
<p>they can have supraphysiological effects on those receptors.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>Well, many people believe that because cannabis,</p>
<p>marijuana is a plant, and plants grow out of the ground</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re naturally occurring,</p>
<p>and because we have receptors in our body</p>
<p>that are there without the need to engineer them</p>
<p>from some external source, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in our genome, it programmed for it,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re born with these things</p>
<p>and we keep these things our entire life.</p>
<p>Many people mistakenly think,</p>
<p>ah, you know, these plant compounds are safer for us</p>
<p>or better for us or are somehow appropriate</p>
<p>for us to ingest, but that&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not saying that cannabis</p>
<p>is always a bad idea for people.</p>
<p>There are certain populations and certain people</p>
<p>for which it can be relatively safe recreationally,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the truth, and there are other populations</p>
<p>for which it can be downright dangerous</p>
<p>recreationally or medicinally.</p>
<p>And of course, there are medicinal purposes</p>
<p>that are being explored and we&rsquo;ll talk more about that.</p>
<p>But this is vital to understand</p>
<p>because I think that when we hear,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s from a plant, it&rsquo;s natural,</p>
<p>and then you also have a receptor</p>
<p>for these endogenous cannabinoid receptors,</p>
<p>and therefore the marriage of those two, right?</p>
<p>The coming together of the chemical THC or CBD</p>
<p>or both with these receptors is somehow supposed to happen</p>
<p>as if this was a purpose of having these receptors,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s simply not the case in the same way</p>
<p>that the nicotinic receptors are not there</p>
<p>because nicotine is good for us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there because there are compounds</p>
<p>that exist within us that are good</p>
<p>to bind to those receptors from time to time.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the key thing about,</p>
<p>I guess today I&rsquo;m saying there are a lot of key things,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s another key thing about understanding cannabis</p>
<p>and the way that it works,</p>
<p>which is that THC and CBD,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re brought into the brain and body</p>
<p>by smoking or edible, et cetera,</p>
<p>they bind to those receptors,</p>
<p>those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,</p>
<p>and they tap into the same systems</p>
<p>that your endogenous cannabinoids would tap into,</p>
<p>the ones that affect mood and energy</p>
<p>and creativity and relaxation, et cetera,</p>
<p>but they do so with thousand-fold greater potency.</p>
<p>And as a consequence of that,</p>
<p>your endogenous cannabinoids are out-competed.</p>
<p>They really get no opportunity</p>
<p>to interact with those receptors.</p>
<p>And understanding that can lead</p>
<p>to a very clear understanding of why, for instance,</p>
<p>when people use cannabis to relieve anxiety</p>
<p>or they use cannabis to enter a certain brain state</p>
<p>for creativity or to enter sleep,</p>
<p>why a dependence on cannabis starts to emerge.</p>
<p>Because if they don&rsquo;t ingest cannabis,</p>
<p>and again, ingest could mean smoke,</p>
<p>to bring THC in or CBD in or ingest orally</p>
<p>or even transdermal or tincture</p>
<p>or one of the other varieties.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>then what happens is not only are the receptors</p>
<p>not stimulated to the same degree</p>
<p>or with the same potency that they normally are,</p>
<p>but the endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>can no longer have their effect.</p>
<p>So people experience heightened levels of anxiety,</p>
<p>disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, and so on.</p>
<p>Now, again, I want to be very clear</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not trying to paint a picture of cannabis</p>
<p>as all bad or even partially bad.</p>
<p>What I want to do today is give you</p>
<p>as much information I can as to how cannabis works,</p>
<p>how its different component parts work,</p>
<p>how the different types of cannabis work,</p>
<p>and point to some of the valid medicinal uses</p>
<p>and some of the recreational uses,</p>
<p>and then lay out the landscape for you</p>
<p>as to who is really most at risk</p>
<p>in terms of psychoactive components,</p>
<p>immune components, and so on and so forth</p>
<p>so that you can make the most informed choice for you.</p>
<p>I am not here to tell you what to do or what not to do.</p>
<p>As I like to say, do as you wish, right?</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t do as you wish</p>
<p>if it harms other people or yourself,</p>
<p>but do as you wish, but know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really my goal here.</p>
<p>So as we begin to dive further into the biology,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll start to get a clearer picture</p>
<p>of why cannabis is so effective in some contexts,</p>
<p>but also why it can create such massive suffering</p>
<p>in other contexts because of the way</p>
<p>that it out-competes</p>
<p>your own natural endogenous cannabinoid systems.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about those endogenous cannabinoid systems,</p>
<p>what they are and how they work,</p>
<p>because that will give us a lens</p>
<p>into what the higher potency or maximum impact</p>
<p>of the various cannabis plant varieties and strains</p>
<p>and THC and CBD and so forth, how and why those work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once</p>
<p>or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics</p>
<p>that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number</p>
<p>of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>

<p>So what are the endogenous cannabinoids,</p>
<p>these chemical substances that everybody makes?</p>
<p>You make them, I make them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been making them basically</p>
<p>from the time that you were conceived,</p>
<p>and you are going to make them until the time that you die.</p>
<p>Whether or not they have the impact</p>
<p>and the biological functions that I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>will depend a lot on whether or not</p>
<p>you are using your own endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>to park in those receptors that you also have</p>
<p>from birth until death,</p>
<p>or whether or not you are tickling those receptors</p>
<p>or strongly activating those receptors</p>
<p>using some external source like cannabis, THC, et cetera.</p>
<p>The two main endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>that we want to consider are anandamide,</p>
<p>which we refer to as EAE, so anandamide,</p>
<p>and another one, which is arachidonoylglycerol,</p>
<p>arachidonoylglycerol, which we will abbreviate 2AG.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just take EAE and 2AG, lump them together,</p>
<p>and talk about the endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>just to make it simple.</p>
<p>But if you want to do the deep dive on anandamide</p>
<p>versus 2AG, please be my guest.</p>
<p>The endogenous cannabinoids are released from neurons.</p>
<p>What are neurons?</p>
<p>Neurons are nerve cells,</p>
<p>and nerve cells should be conceptualized like this.</p>
<p>You have presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic neurons.</p>
<p>Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,</p>
<p>little bubbles full of neurotransmitter,</p>
<p>which are chemicals,</p>
<p>and when neurons are stimulated electrically,</p>
<p>and that could be from a thought,</p>
<p>it could be from the desire to move,</p>
<p>it could be because of a drug,</p>
<p>it could be because you&rsquo;re hungry,</p>
<p>the relevant neurons will vomit out</p>
<p>or will fuse, as we say, those little packets,</p>
<p>those little bubbles of neurotransmitter</p>
<p>into the gap between the pre- and postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>We call that a synaptic cleft or the synapse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little gap, a little space,</p>
<p>and the neurotransmitter flows across that synapse,</p>
<p>and some of it will park in little parking spots</p>
<p>that we call receptors on the postsynaptic neuron side.</p>
<p>Depending on which neurotransmitter it is</p>
<p>and a bunch of other things,</p>
<p>not worth going into right now,</p>
<p>the parking of that chemical</p>
<p>in those neurotransmitter receptors</p>
<p>will either cause that neuron on the postsynaptic side</p>
<p>to itself release neurotransmitter elsewhere,</p>
<p>or it will quiet it down,</p>
<p>so-called excitation and inhibition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of neurotransmission in a nutshell.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand it, no big deal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to prevent you</p>
<p>from understanding today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>If you understand even a small fraction</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;ve just said,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s going to allow you to understand</p>
<p>not just today&rsquo;s discussion, but a lot of neuroscience</p>
<p>with a lot more nuance and depth of understanding.</p>
<p>The key thing to know about the endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>is that unlike most neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>they are released from the postsynaptic side.</p>
<p>So what happens is neurotransmitter</p>
<p>goes from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic neuron,</p>
<p>but under certain conditions,</p>
<p>the postsynaptic neuron itself releases a chemical,</p>
<p>and that chemical goes backward,</p>
<p>what we call retrogradely to the presynaptic neuron,</p>
<p>binds to receptors there and changes the probability</p>
<p>that the presynaptic neuron will release neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>tend to decrease the probability</p>
<p>that a neuron will release neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>They are sort of a break on the system.</p>
<p>They are a way of shutting down</p>
<p>the communication between neurons, regulating it,</p>
<p>not to make it completely quiet,</p>
<p>but to adjust the levels with a lot of nuance.</p>
<p>Now, the other thing that the endogenous cannabinoids do</p>
<p>is sort of a mind bender,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about cannabis</p>
<p>and a commonly known feature of cannabis</p>
<p>and marijuana consumption</p>
<p>is disruptions in short-term memory.</p>
<p>And there is essentially zero debate</p>
<p>as to whether or not that occurs.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about the mechanisms a little bit later.</p>
<p>And yet, endogenous cannabinoids,</p>
<p>the chemicals that you naturally release</p>
<p>from these postsynaptic neurons</p>
<p>that travel retrogradely back to the presynaptic neuron</p>
<p>actually can lead to strengthening of connections</p>
<p>between the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron</p>
<p>through a process called long-term potentiation or LTP.</p>
<p>They can also cause what&rsquo;s called depression</p>
<p>of communication between a presynaptic neuron</p>
<p>and a postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>Long-term depression has nothing to do with depression</p>
<p>as a psychological state or as a illness.</p>
<p>Long-term potentiation and long-term depression</p>
<p>simply refer to the probability that one neuron</p>
<p>will be able to stimulate and activate another neuron.</p>
<p>And as I just told you,</p>
<p>the endogenous cannabinoids can either turn up the dial</p>
<p>or turn down the dial.</p>
<p>They can either increase the probability</p>
<p>or decrease the probability</p>
<p>that a given connection between neurons</p>
<p>will function more or will function less.</p>
<p>So if you think about the communication between neurons</p>
<p>as a crosstalk, as a conversation,</p>
<p>well, the endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>can dictate whether or not that conversation</p>
<p>is likely to occur or not to occur.</p>
<p>Think of them as either putting someone</p>
<p>at the top of your text chain in your phone,</p>
<p>which would be long-term potentiation,</p>
<p>or essentially blocking their number,</p>
<p>which would essentially be long-term depression.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re getting the impression</p>
<p>that the endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>are working in a number of different ways</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not very straightforward, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s the message that I&rsquo;d like you to take away.</p>
<p>The endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>are sometimes increasing neuronal communication.</p>
<p>This can lead to increases in mood</p>
<p>or increases in the likelihood</p>
<p>that someone will talk a certain way</p>
<p>or behave a certain way or feel a certain way.</p>
<p>They can also lead to decreases in synaptic transmission,</p>
<p>that is communication between neurons,</p>
<p>in ways that will make somebody&rsquo;s mood lower</p>
<p>or will make them less hungry or more hungry.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the really key thing.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of endogenous cannabinoid receptors</p>
<p>referred to as CB1 and CB2.</p>
<p>And we can say with confidence</p>
<p>that CB1 is highly enriched in the nervous system</p>
<p>and especially within the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s found not everywhere,</p>
<p>but almost everywhere in the brain</p>
<p>and elsewhere in the nervous system.</p>
<p>So spinal cord and other aspects of the nervous system.</p>
<p>CB2, the cannabinoid receptor,</p>
<p>CB2 is largely located in the tissues of the body,</p>
<p>including the immune system, the liver,</p>
<p>even the genitals, et cetera.</p>
<p>So what this means is that the endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>are having these sorts of effects</p>
<p>on neurons that I talked about,</p>
<p>but they are also having effects on immune cells,</p>
<p>on reproductive organs, on liver, on digestion,</p>
<p>on hunger, et cetera,</p>
<p>through mechanisms that are divorced</p>
<p>from the function of the nervous system of neurons.</p>
<p>Now, in reality, no system of the brain and body</p>
<p>is divorced from the nervous system</p>
<p>because the nervous system is controlling everything.</p>
<p>It was really the master controller</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s feeding back to the nervous system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a two-way street.</p>
<p>But the simple way to think about a CB1 receptors</p>
<p>are mainly in the nervous system</p>
<p>and CB2 receptors are mainly in the body</p>
<p>and endogenous cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Again, EAE, anatomide, and 2AG, arachidinoyl glycerol</p>
<p>are impacting CB1 and CB2 receptors.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re mainly going to talk about CB1 receptors</p>
<p>because they are the ones that are responsible</p>
<p>for most of the familiar effects of cannabis.</p>
<p>But the key takeaway at this point</p>
<p>is to really understand that the major effects</p>
<p>of your endogenous cannabinoids on these receptors,</p>
<p>in this particular CB1, are very nuanced.</p>
<p>It depends on context, it depends on which neurons.</p>
<p>Sometimes increasing communication between neurons,</p>
<p>sometimes decreasing it.</p>
<p>And then along comes cannabis.</p>
<p>And that cannabis, again, can arrive by smoking,</p>
<p>by vaping, by edible.</p>
<p>And cannabis contains THC and CBD</p>
<p>that potently bind the CB1 receptor.</p>
<p>And now the effects of the CB1 receptor</p>
<p>being occupied by THC or being occupied by CBD</p>
<p>are not very nuanced.</p>
<p>In fact, they are very predictable.</p>
<p>And especially important is to understand</p>
<p>that they are so strong,</p>
<p>and they park in that receptor with such affinity,</p>
<p>with such force and precision and stubbornness</p>
<p>and refusal to leave that receptor,</p>
<p>that they completely outcompete</p>
<p>the endogenous cannabinoid system.</p>
<p>In fact, they leave the endogenous cannabinoid system</p>
<p>essentially dysfunctional,</p>
<p>which in some cases may be a good thing,</p>
<p>but in most cases is going to lead to problems</p>
<p>of various kinds.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about what sorts of problems.</p>
<p>And again, I feel obligated to say,</p>
<p>this is not me saying don&rsquo;t ingest cannabis or THC or CBD.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, if you evaluate the potency,</p>
<p>that is, in technical terms,</p>
<p>it would be the affinity with which these compounds,</p>
<p>THC and CBD and CB1, bind to these endogenous receptors.</p>
<p>That would be like a howitzer gun, like a cannon going off,</p>
<p>as compared to endogenous cannabinoid,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s EAE or 2AG,</p>
<p>which is more like a cap gun level of activation,</p>
<p>at least in this analogy.</p>
<p>So now you have what, at least I would like to think,</p>
<p>is a fairly complete understanding</p>
<p>of the different varieties of cannabis,</p>
<p>at least at a broad sweep,</p>
<p>and the different biological effects that they can have,</p>
<p>at least in terms of the major receptors</p>
<p>and in retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a step back into the real world.</p>
<p>And evaluate or think about what happens</p>
<p>when somebody smokes cannabis or ingests cannabis</p>
<p>by way of edible or tincture or something of that sort.</p>
<p>Cannabis is very fast to enter the bloodstream.</p>
<p>In fact, within 30 seconds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to enter the brain</p>
<p>and permeate throughout the brain and body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very, very fast.</p>
<p>I mean, when you contrast that with something like alcohol</p>
<p>or even nicotine, depending on how the nicotine is delivered,</p>
<p>that is a very fast delivery of the psychoactive</p>
<p>and biologically active compound,</p>
<p>which in this case is THC and CBD</p>
<p>and probably some other things as well.</p>
<p>So within 30 seconds,</p>
<p>it reaches the brain and bodily tissues.</p>
<p>And within 30 to 60 minutes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to reach its peak concentrations</p>
<p>and have its peak biological effects.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t always the same thing,</p>
<p>but in the case of cannabis,</p>
<p>and again here, I&rsquo;m using cannabis</p>
<p>as a kind of umbrella term for THC and CBD,</p>
<p>the effects are going to peak at about 30 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>after bringing those compounds into the body</p>
<p>in some way or another.</p>
<p>And the effects tend to last</p>
<p>anywhere from three to four hours,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s some variation on that</p>
<p>depending on individual metabolism,</p>
<p>whether or not somebody is familiar with the compound,</p>
<p>believe it or not, psychologically familiar,</p>
<p>but also biologically familiar</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s a first-time use</p>
<p>or occasional use and so on.</p>
<p>THC and CBD and other components of cannabis</p>
<p>are highly what we call lipophilic.</p>
<p>That is, they have an affinity toward</p>
<p>and they can actually pass through fatty tissues.</p>
<p>Now, every cell in your body,</p>
<p>but especially neurons have a double layer of fat</p>
<p>on their outside.</p>
<p>And of course, when people hear fat,</p>
<p>they always think, ooh, fat&rsquo;s bad, fat&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Most of the world seems to want to lose fat or bodily fat.</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re talking about the fatty membrane,</p>
<p>the barrier around each tissue.</p>
<p>And in this case, we&rsquo;re talking particularly about neurons.</p>
<p>And THC and CBD and the other components of cannabis</p>
<p>are highly lipophilic.</p>
<p>So they can get into essentially all cells</p>
<p>just simply by flowing into them.</p>
<p>They will also remain in those cells for a long time.</p>
<p>So I know that a number of people,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not they get tested</p>
<p>for work or for sport or otherwise,</p>
<p>for cannabis or CBD and THC,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take this as a strict number,</p>
<p>but typically if one ingests CBD or THC,</p>
<p>smokes cannabis, ingests by orally, et cetera,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to stay in that fatty tissue</p>
<p>and can be detected for at least as long</p>
<p>as 80 days after ingestion.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole industry as to</p>
<p>how to accelerate the clearance.</p>
<p>And I should just tell you that just losing bodily fat</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to eliminate it from your system,</p>
<p>maybe partially in those fat cells,</p>
<p>but certainly intravisceral fat and other fatty tissue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in and around the brain and body</p>
<p>is going to harbor that THC molecule and the CBD molecule</p>
<p>for quite a long while, at least 80 days.</p>
<p>Okay, so if someone smokes cannabis or they ingest cannabis,</p>
<p>very rapidly gets into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and the components that are psychoactive</p>
<p>get into the bloodstream and are immediately able</p>
<p>to access neurons and other cells</p>
<p>and start having these effects of parking</p>
<p>at those endogenous cannabinoid receptors</p>
<p>and impacting the signaling between neurons,</p>
<p>which leads to the subjective effects of cannabis,</p>
<p>including THC and CBD.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what those</p>
<p>different subjective effects are.</p>
<p>Again, this is going to vary depending on whether or not</p>
<p>people are ingesting sativa varieties of cannabis.</p>
<p>Just to remind you, those tend to be elevated,</p>
<p>mood, alertness, talkativeness.</p>
<p>People who take sativa varieties tend to talk a lot more</p>
<p>than they would otherwise.</p>
<p>Again, there are exceptions to this.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are people out there shouting,</p>
<p>although I guess if you&rsquo;re the quiet people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t talk too much, you&rsquo;re probably not shouting,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not doing a sativa joke intended.</p>
<p>But in any event, there are exceptions,</p>
<p>but there are also general rules.</p>
<p>And the sativas tend to meet people</p>
<p>sort of mood elevated, energetic,</p>
<p>again, the sort of head high.</p>
<p>And indica varieties tend to do the opposite,</p>
<p>more of a sedative, relaxant, et cetera.</p>
<p>Why and how would they do that?</p>
<p>Okay, well, without going into an extensive deep dive</p>
<p>into the different neurotransmitter systems</p>
<p>of the brain and body,</p>
<p>what we know for sure is that CB1 receptors</p>
<p>are present on an enormous number of different neurons</p>
<p>in brain structures and neural circuits,</p>
<p>so that the sativa varieties that act as sort of a stimulant</p>
<p>making people feel happy,</p>
<p>because in general, they do tend to elevate mood,</p>
<p>at least at certain dosages.</p>
<p>Talkative tend to make people feel</p>
<p>like they have ideas that are interesting,</p>
<p>that they might want to share,</p>
<p>tend to narrow their context,</p>
<p>so tend to increase focus.</p>
<p>This is something that&rsquo;s not often discussed about cannabis,</p>
<p>but it can, especially the sativa varieties</p>
<p>can increase people&rsquo;s level of focus to particular things,</p>
<p>something they&rsquo;re watching or something they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>or music allows them to narrow their sense of focus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to occur by activation of CB1 receptors</p>
<p>in the so-called prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which is just behind the forehead.</p>
<p>And the prefrontal cortex acts as a strong modulator</p>
<p>of so-called limbic circuitry and other circuitry</p>
<p>that is more stress-oriented.</p>
<p>The way to think about the stress and limbic circuitry,</p>
<p>such as the amygdala, which many people have heard about,</p>
<p>is that they aren&rsquo;t really circuits for fear and stress.</p>
<p>They are circuits that are constantly evaluating</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s own internal state, heart rate, et cetera,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening externally.</p>
<p>And sorry to say, but the default of those systems</p>
<p>is to detect danger, the sort of threat detection systems.</p>
<p>And then the prefrontal cortex largely acts</p>
<p>as a brake on those systems,</p>
<p>sort of like the reins pulling back on a steed of horses</p>
<p>that would otherwise just kind of take off.</p>
<p>And so the sativa varieties tend to increase CB1 activation</p>
<p>in the prefrontal cortex and in other circuitry</p>
<p>that then leads to a kind of overall reduction in stress</p>
<p>because of the way that prefrontal circuitry</p>
<p>can reduce activation of the amygdala.</p>
<p>Now that, of course, does not explain</p>
<p>why some people become very stressed and very paranoid</p>
<p>when they smoke sativa varieties</p>
<p>or other varieties of cannabis</p>
<p>or ingest other varieties of cannabis.</p>
<p>We will talk about the paranoid effect</p>
<p>and why that occurs and who might predict</p>
<p>that would occur to them in a little bit.</p>
<p>But I just want to give you a sense of how this is working</p>
<p>because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>THC and or CBD are going to bind that CB1 receptor,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say in prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>and neurons of prefrontal cortex is going to bind there.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be a retrograde signaling</p>
<p>back to the presynaptic neuron.</p>
<p>And in the case of prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is it&rsquo;s increasing transmission,</p>
<p>increasing the release of neurotransmitter</p>
<p>in the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>However, at the same time,</p>
<p>the very same THC and CBD that was brought into the system</p>
<p>is binding the very same type of receptors, CB1 receptors</p>
<p>in other brain structures, such as the amygdala</p>
<p>and causing retrograde signaling</p>
<p>back to the presynaptic neurons in the amygdala,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quieting the activation of those neurons.</p>
<p>So this is interesting, right?</p>
<p>We have the same compounds, THC and or CBD</p>
<p>brought into the body and brain binding the same receptors,</p>
<p>in this case, the CB1 receptors,</p>
<p>but depending on where those receptors are located</p>
<p>and which brain areas we&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>they are either causing heightened levels of alertness</p>
<p>and activation of systems that are designed</p>
<p>to make you talkative and alertness and mood, et cetera,</p>
<p>focus, or they&rsquo;re causing suppression of those circuitries.</p>
<p>So we have kind of a seesaw effect here</p>
<p>where the same compound is increasing mood and alertness</p>
<p>and focus in the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and is decreasing stress and threat detection</p>
<p>in the amygdala.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why,</p>
<p>especially the sativa varieties of cannabis</p>
<p>allow people to enter these states of focus.</p>
<p>Some might even say flow,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t want to go into</p>
<p>what flow states really are,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for a different discussion.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very poorly defined as it is.</p>
<p>And I certainly don&rsquo;t want to give people the impression</p>
<p>that cannabis increases flow states</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>And certainly most often it&rsquo;s not going to be the case.</p>
<p>But the idea here is that this molecule comes into our brain</p>
<p>and is shifting everything towards a state of focus,</p>
<p>elevated mood, of heightened sense of importance</p>
<p>about whatever it is that we happen to be doing.</p>
<p>And now, of course, whatever we could happen to be doing</p>
<p>could be writing a song, writing poetry,</p>
<p>communicating with somebody,</p>
<p>but it could also be something as trivial</p>
<p>as watching cartoons or watching a movie,</p>
<p>which is not trivial in its own right,</p>
<p>but in terms of thinking about the creative aspects</p>
<p>or the creativity stimulating aspects of cannabis,</p>
<p>not sort of productivity oriented.</p>
<p>So narrowed focus, elevated mood,</p>
<p>more relaxed and yet energetic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the major effects of the sativa varieties,</p>
<p>except, and this is a really big bold face,</p>
<p>triple underlined except, except in some individuals,</p>
<p>depending on dosage,</p>
<p>but also depending on preexisting neural circuitry</p>
<p>and propensity for anxiety,</p>
<p>some people ingest or smoke sativa varieties.</p>
<p>And regardless of whether or not it&rsquo;s a type one,</p>
<p>type two, or type three variety, okay?</p>
<p>Regardless of the ratio between THC and CBD,</p>
<p>people will experience intense anxiety and paranoia.</p>
<p>Now, how do you predict</p>
<p>who will experience intense anxiety and paranoia</p>
<p>and who will experience intense relaxation,</p>
<p>focus, and sense of creativity</p>
<p>from ingesting or smoking a type one, type two,</p>
<p>or type three sativa?</p>
<p>Well, there is no way to predict that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of kind of what I would call street lore</p>
<p>or dorm room lore or kind of pure, not peer reviewed,</p>
<p>but sort of peer discussed,</p>
<p>I mean, among friends and people and acquaintances,</p>
<p>lore out there that what one needs to do</p>
<p>is simply smoke more, right?</p>
<p>Or just ingest more, you hear that.</p>
<p>Oh, well, listen, if it makes you paranoid,</p>
<p>you simply need to use more.</p>
<p>That is absolutely categorically false.</p>
<p>Everything we know about the way that THC and CBD work</p>
<p>is that they tend to potentiate,</p>
<p>that is increase the effects of these different systems</p>
<p>at given synapses and in different areas</p>
<p>of the brain and body.</p>
<p>That is, if someone experiences paranoia or anxiety</p>
<p>from a given strain of the marijuana plant</p>
<p>or from ingesting an edible in a particular way</p>
<p>or a particular kind of edible,</p>
<p>that person is very likely to experience the same effect</p>
<p>every time they ingest that strain or variety.</p>
<p>This is part of what&rsquo;s led to this enormous industry.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a number of different reasons,</p>
<p>but this is part of what&rsquo;s led to this enormous industry</p>
<p>of highly customized cannabis,</p>
<p>where people will spend some time</p>
<p>really seeking out the different strains of cannabis</p>
<p>and hybrids of cannabis that work best for them</p>
<p>and work best for them in particular contexts.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that if you are a person</p>
<p>who is between five foot seven and six feet tall</p>
<p>and you have blue eyes or brown eyes</p>
<p>that the sativa varieties are going to be right for you</p>
<p>or that the sativa varieties</p>
<p>are going to give you panic attacks.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>The only way to determine it would be</p>
<p>to actually experience ingesting those or smoking those,</p>
<p>which is certainly also not what I&rsquo;m suggesting, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling you what to do or what not to do,</p>
<p>but there are no good predictors.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look in the literature,</p>
<p>it is not at all clear that people</p>
<p>who have a heightened level of anxiety</p>
<p>when they do not smoke cannabis</p>
<p>will experience cannabis as less paranoia inducing</p>
<p>or more relaxing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>Now, what we can say for sure</p>
<p>is that general categories of effects,</p>
<p>such as increased focus and reduced anxiety</p>
<p>are largely due to activation of areas</p>
<p>like the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Now, unlike other compounds like nicotine or alcohol</p>
<p>or neurotransmitter systems like dopamine,</p>
<p>when we talk about the cannabinoid system</p>
<p>and I say effects, biological effects, psychoactive effects,</p>
<p>I want you to keep in mind always,</p>
<p>please, please, please keep in mind</p>
<p>that those effects can be varied</p>
<p>and often opposite in direction.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just give an example of that.</p>
<p>I just mentioned that when people smoke or eat sativa,</p>
<p>that it tends to lead to one specific set of,</p>
<p>or generally leads to one specific set of effects,</p>
<p>heightened focus, mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>Whereas when they ingest or smoke indica</p>
<p>and its components, right?</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re still talking about THC and CBD</p>
<p>in varying ratios, but now indica cannabis,</p>
<p>and you say, well, why would it improve</p>
<p>the transition time to sleep?</p>
<p>Or at least give people the impression</p>
<p>that it improved the transition time to sleep.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about what indica actually does</p>
<p>for sleep in a little bit.</p>
<p>But indica also tends to suppress activation</p>
<p>of the amygdala and threat detection centers in the brain.</p>
<p>Again, binding the same CB1 receptors</p>
<p>and those retrograde signaling mechanisms</p>
<p>I talked about before.</p>
<p>But it also tends to shut down the hippocampus,</p>
<p>an area of the brain associated with memory,</p>
<p>which is why indica varieties lead to pronounced,</p>
<p>or I should say profound defects in short-term memory,</p>
<p>and sometimes in long-term memory as well,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s consumed over long periods of time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about short, medium, and long-term consumption,</p>
<p>occasional consumption going forward.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d like you to take away</p>
<p>from this component of the discussion is,</p>
<p>first of all, the mechanism of action</p>
<p>by which cannabis impacts the brain and body,</p>
<p>but in particular, the brain,</p>
<p>is going to be through CB1 receptors.</p>
<p>And those CB1 receptors can lead to either an acceleration</p>
<p>or a break on particular biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>And there are going to be a constellation</p>
<p>of different accelerations and breaking</p>
<p>of different neural systems in the brain and body,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not people ingest sativa or indica</p>
<p>or some hybrid strain.</p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly,</p>
<p>even if you didn&rsquo;t understand anything that I&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>about the biology of these different strains</p>
<p>and the receptors,</p>
<p>please do understand that there is no way to predict</p>
<p>what the effect of a given strain will be</p>
<p>on an individual.</p>
<p>There has been extensive exploration</p>
<p>as to whether or not people who are so-called mellower</p>
<p>or more anxious or any number</p>
<p>of different personality dimensions will respond</p>
<p>in one way or the other.</p>
<p>But in fact, there is no way to tell.</p>
<p>Layer on top of that,</p>
<p>the fact that dosing THC and CBD</p>
<p>can be fairly straightforward in the form of edibles,</p>
<p>right, because there can be,</p>
<p>at least if it&rsquo;s a controlled source,</p>
<p>a defined number of milligrams of THC,</p>
<p>a defined number of milligrams of CBD.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for ingestibles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much harder to gauge that</p>
<p>from the smokable forms of cannabis,</p>
<p>especially if those smokable forms of cannabis</p>
<p>are obtained through sources</p>
<p>where there isn&rsquo;t a lot of clear information</p>
<p>about the total amount of THC in that product.</p>
<p>Now, this is all changing quite a lot nowadays</p>
<p>because of the commercialization of THC and CBD products</p>
<p>and cannabis in a number of different areas,</p>
<p>including in the United States.</p>
<p>But still many people are ingesting cannabis,</p>
<p>THC, CBD through sources</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t really know how much</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bringing into their system.</p>
<p>And so whether or not someone gets</p>
<p>incredible anxiety relief,</p>
<p>enhanced sense of mood and focus</p>
<p>and wellbeing, pain relief, et cetera,</p>
<p>or whether or not they have full-blown panic attacks,</p>
<p>et cetera, is very hard to predict</p>
<p>based on dosage information alone.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we can create broad categories</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to talk about studies</p>
<p>that create broad categories of low dose,</p>
<p>moderate dose and high dose,</p>
<p>frequent use and infrequent use.</p>
<p>But unlike alcohol, unlike nicotine,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t really point to specificity</p>
<p>of X amount of alcohol, grams of alcohol per week,</p>
<p>which is safe, or X amount of alcohol, which is not safe.</p>
<p>And so I know a lot of people out there are wondering,</p>
<p>you know, how often can they smoke cannabis</p>
<p>or how often can they eat cannabis or THC or CBD</p>
<p>and any number of its different forms and products safely?</p>
<p>Well, we have to really define what safely means</p>
<p>and we have to really acknowledge</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a pretty loose set of controls</p>
<p>over what one is bringing into their brain and body</p>
<p>as they ingest THC and CBD.</p>
<p>But even under conditions in which it&rsquo;s very controlled,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to predict what those effects will be.</p>
<p>So before moving into specifics of taking cannabis</p>
<p>or not taking cannabis, who should, who shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>what the medicinal purposes are</p>
<p>and what some of the newer exciting data point to,</p>
<p>I just briefly want to make a list.</p>
<p>And I promise very briefly, I know I&rsquo;m not often concise,</p>
<p>but I do try to be thorough for your sake.</p>
<p>I want to make a very brief list</p>
<p>of the different brain areas that are impacted</p>
<p>by THC and CBD and why THC and CBD</p>
<p>have the various effects they do.</p>
<p>When somebody smokes or ingests cannabis,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter what the THC or CBD ratio is,</p>
<p>if they experience deficits in memory,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s almost always present,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be because of reductions</p>
<p>in electrical activity within this brain region</p>
<p>we call the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Hippocampus means seahorse, it&rsquo;s shaped like a seahorse.</p>
<p>Anatomists like to name things after what things look like,</p>
<p>but hippocampus memory,</p>
<p>memory is reduced in particular short-term memory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>one is using sativa, indica, or some hybrid.</p>
<p>In general, the prefrontal cortex is going to be activated</p>
<p>by the sativa varieties, which is going to increase thinking</p>
<p>and narrowly constrain focus to some activity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s more commonly associated</p>
<p>with the sativa varieties.</p>
<p>The indica varieties, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>tend to lead to a suppression of activity</p>
<p>in prefrontal cortex, believe it or not,</p>
<p>and turn off thinking and planning.</p>
<p>This is why indica varieties are often used for relaxation</p>
<p>and for promoting sleep.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not sativa or indica variety,</p>
<p>and again, regardless of the ratio of THC to CBD,</p>
<p>there is a general suppression of neural circuits</p>
<p>within the so-called basal ganglia and cerebellum.</p>
<p>Basal ganglia and cerebellum are areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in action planning and withholding action.</p>
<p>So that would be the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>so-called go-no-go circuitry.</p>
<p>And the cerebellum, which is involved in balance,</p>
<p>but also motor planning and motor sequencing.</p>
<p>This is why people who smoke marijuana,</p>
<p>regardless of the strain,</p>
<p>will tend to be less physically mobile.</p>
<p>Other common effects are reddening of the eyes,</p>
<p>dryness of the mouth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually caused by the same general mechanism,</p>
<p>which is a reduction in the secretion of saliva</p>
<p>and of sort of tears and lubrication of the eyes</p>
<p>from the lacrimal glands of the eyes</p>
<p>because of the presence of largely CB2,</p>
<p>but also CB1 receptors in the mouth and on the eyes.</p>
<p>And there tends to be,</p>
<p>especially with certain strains of cannabis,</p>
<p>increase in appetite, so-called munchies.</p>
<p>And that has everything to do</p>
<p>with very, very high density of CB1 receptors</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>and in particular areas of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>other areas as well, of course,</p>
<p>that have tons of CB1 receptors,</p>
<p>bind THC and CBD,</p>
<p>and activate the neurons that strongly stimulate appetite</p>
<p>through two mechanisms.</p>
<p>One is a cognitive mechanism of creating a preoccupation</p>
<p>with food and anticipation of taste,</p>
<p>as well as the experience of taste.</p>
<p>So the narrowing of focus to what you want to go eat,</p>
<p>right, you really crave, I don&rsquo;t know, pizza,</p>
<p>it seems to be high fat, high carbohydrate foods,</p>
<p>but really crave pizza,</p>
<p>and narrowing of focus</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not thinking about anything else,</p>
<p>but also signaling from the hypothalamus to the gut,</p>
<p>to neurons within the stomach itself</p>
<p>that regulate blood sugar.</p>
<p>So there are strong effects on blood sugar of THC and CBD</p>
<p>that generally lead to increases in appetite.</p>
<p>So two parallel mechanisms,</p>
<p>one within the brain, one within the body,</p>
<p>increasing appetite.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s an array of different effects.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>CB1 receptors are present all over the nervous system</p>
<p>in the brain, the spinal cord.</p>
<p>In fact, the presence of CB1 receptors in the spinal cord</p>
<p>largely explains the fact that THC and CBD,</p>
<p>to some extent, although it&rsquo;s not very well studied,</p>
<p>can provide some pain relief.</p>
<p>I say some because a lot of people perceive</p>
<p>or believe that they experience more pain relief</p>
<p>from cannabis than they actually do.</p>
<p>It actually has a lot to do with a perceptual shift</p>
<p>to basically focusing on other things,</p>
<p>but there does seem to be some antinosusceptive,</p>
<p>meaning anti-pain effects of cannabis, THC in particular,</p>
<p>and that is exerted largely through effects</p>
<p>on CB1 receptors in neurons of the spinal cord.</p>
<p>So a broad array of effects are taking place,</p>
<p>regardless of what strain you take</p>
<p>and whether or not you eat the cannabis</p>
<p>or you smoke the cannabis.</p>
<p>And the broad array of effects can be explained</p>
<p>by the fact that that retrograde signaling</p>
<p>can lead to activation or suppression of activity</p>
<p>in various neurons.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to take a step back</p>
<p>from the biology of cannabis and THC and CBD</p>
<p>and all the signaling and receptors, et cetera,</p>
<p>and really just focus on cannabis use.</p>
<p>And wherever possible, I will point to the specific strains</p>
<p>that have been studied and the ratios of THC to CBD.</p>
<p>But I have to say that unfortunately,</p>
<p>most studies of marijuana, of cannabis,</p>
<p>while they have been very careful to detail</p>
<p>the amount of THC, low dose, medium dose, or high dose,</p>
<p>and actually getting very specific,</p>
<p>right down to the number of milligrams</p>
<p>or even how much circulating THC is present</p>
<p>after somebody smokes a joint or ingests cannabis,</p>
<p>most studies have not distinguished</p>
<p>between sativa and indica strains.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s unfortunate because in the real world,</p>
<p>people are distinguishing between sativa and indica strains</p>
<p>in their patterns of use and what they prefer</p>
<p>and what they don&rsquo;t prefer,</p>
<p>even what they prefer to smoke during the day</p>
<p>or ingest during the day versus night.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there are people</p>
<p>who are using certain strains during the day</p>
<p>and other strains at night.</p>
<p>But the science has yet to catch up to that,</p>
<p>or I should say more accurately,</p>
<p>the general public and the themes that are emerging</p>
<p>and the practices that are emerging around cannabis,</p>
<p>especially in states where it&rsquo;s decriminalized or legalized</p>
<p>are occurring at such a rapid rate</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s absolutely no way</p>
<p>that the science could keep up.</p>
<p>This is a naturally occurring experiment,</p>
<p>not to say that it&rsquo;s natural, like people should do it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an experiment that&rsquo;s happening in real time</p>
<p>in the real world, much faster than controlled studies</p>
<p>within university laboratories</p>
<p>and other laboratories can keep up.</p>
<p>So at this point,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>why do people even use cannabis?</p>
<p>I mean, what are they trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Is it always about not feeling pain?</p>
<p>Is it always about reducing anxiety?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes it is,</p>
<p>but oftentimes people are using cannabis</p>
<p>in order to achieve a particular state.</p>
<p>And we could use a broad brush and say,</p>
<p>well, they just like being high.</p>
<p>But while that may be true in a lot of circumstances,</p>
<p>and I have to believe it actually is true</p>
<p>in a lot of circumstances,</p>
<p>there are a lot of people who use cannabis</p>
<p>in a very directed way,</p>
<p>or they get quote unquote high in order to achieve states</p>
<p>that to them are particularly attractive.</p>
<p>And one such state is a state of creativity.</p>
<p>And this brings us to a broader theme,</p>
<p>which is, does cannabis increase creativity?</p>
<p>And if so, is it the THC, the CBD,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the appropriate ratio</p>
<p>or the best ratio for accessing creativity?</p>
<p>This is an interesting and important discussion, I believe,</p>
<p>because creativity is one of the more sought after</p>
<p>and more elusive states that humans can experience.</p>
<p>And yet, if you look at human evolution,</p>
<p>you look at our progression</p>
<p>in terms of technology development and culture</p>
<p>and music and poetry, et cetera,</p>
<p>we really can look to creativity as the state</p>
<p>that fostered so much of that evolution.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re into technology</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re into art or music,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re just somebody</p>
<p>who wants to expand their understanding</p>
<p>or their experience of life in some way,</p>
<p>creativity is a fundamentally important state</p>
<p>to try and access and to try and access regularly</p>
<p>and to try and tap into</p>
<p>in order to eventually produce something,</p>
<p>in order to create something of meaning that exists,</p>
<p>not just in that creative state,</p>
<p>but to yourself after that creative state has gone away.</p>
<p>So the painting that you paint in the creative state,</p>
<p>hopefully is a painting that still inspires</p>
<p>and has impact after you exit that creative state</p>
<p>and that will inspire others.</p>
<p>And this could be true for any number of different things,</p>
<p>not just painting.</p>
<p>So does cannabis increase creativity?</p>
<p>The short answer is it depends.</p>
<p>First of all, we need to define creativity.</p>
<p>Here we are thinking as scientists,</p>
<p>if not already scientists.</p>
<p>And there are basically two modes of thinking</p>
<p>that are associated with creativity.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t completely explain creativity,</p>
<p>but if you look in the research,</p>
<p>the psychology research and the neuroscience research,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hear about convergent thinking</p>
<p>and divergent thinking.</p>
<p>Convergent thinking is taking loose ideas</p>
<p>and kind of braiding them together,</p>
<p>finding a common thread,</p>
<p>synthesizing and organizing those different ideas</p>
<p>into some common or specific framework</p>
<p>in order to get or create some specific outcome.</p>
<p>So convergent thinking is basically the person in the room</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s listening to all the ideas and taking them all in.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a panel of how should we get a certain product</p>
<p>out to market?</p>
<p>Or what are the different motifs that we should include</p>
<p>in a piece of music?</p>
<p>Or what should we do in terms of re-architecting</p>
<p>a given physical space?</p>
<p>Taking in those different opinions,</p>
<p>those different ideas from different people,</p>
<p>and then synthesizing them and coming up with one</p>
<p>or a small subset of coherent ideas</p>
<p>that incorporate some or all of the ones that they heard.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s convergent thinking.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to involve a panel of people</p>
<p>talking to you.</p>
<p>I use that as an example of what goes on</p>
<p>inside your own head</p>
<p>when you are engaging in convergent thinking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking, well, so-and-so said this,</p>
<p>and I think that,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of braiding them through</p>
<p>and trying to get some common theme,</p>
<p>some common vector to emerge from that.</p>
<p>Divergent thinking, on the other hand,</p>
<p>is best described as brainstorming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exploring ideas and continuing to move</p>
<p>into the variation and the vastness of ideas</p>
<p>in hopes of eventually being able to converge</p>
<p>on some novel idea or framework, okay?</p>
<p>So these are similar and related,</p>
<p>but typically the creativity process</p>
<p>involves first brainstorming and divergent thinking,</p>
<p>and then in order to arrive at something,</p>
<p>to actually create something, right,</p>
<p>the verb create,</p>
<p>not just thinking about what you might create,</p>
<p>which occurs during divergent thinking,</p>
<p>but actually creating something,</p>
<p>a specific painting, a specific song,</p>
<p>a specific body of literature,</p>
<p>a specific scientific project or experiment, and so on.</p>
<p>That usually involves convergent thinking.</p>
<p>Now, these can be explored in the laboratory,</p>
<p>and they can be explored in the laboratories</p>
<p>through sets of different types of questionnaires</p>
<p>or even tasks that you can give human subjects,</p>
<p>and this has been done extensively,</p>
<p>and across the entire body of data,</p>
<p>and by that I mean literally hundreds of studies</p>
<p>that have explored the relationship</p>
<p>between particular neural circuits and neurochemicals,</p>
<p>convergent and divergent thinking,</p>
<p>we can arrive at a principle,</p>
<p>and the principle involves a molecule</p>
<p>that many of you have heard about before,</p>
<p>which is dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s involved in motivation,</p>
<p>and it tends to direct our attention</p>
<p>to things outside of us,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also closely related to convergent thinking</p>
<p>and divergent thinking and to the creative process,</p>
<p>and therefore it should come as no surprise</p>
<p>that diseases of the nervous system,</p>
<p>excuse me, such as bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>of which we&rsquo;ve done an episode all about bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>or schizophrenia,</p>
<p>or mood disorders that impact the levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>either make it way, way too high,</p>
<p>or way, way too low,</p>
<p>strongly impact whether or not people will be creative,</p>
<p>and I think the short takeaway</p>
<p>that makes the most sense in terms of framing this,</p>
<p>and we cover this on the episode on bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>sometimes called bipolar depression,</p>
<p>is that in professions</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of creativity required</p>
<p>in order to succeed,</p>
<p>so again, musicians, composers, artists, et cetera,</p>
<p>you tend to find more manic depression,</p>
<p>and manic depression, at least in the manic states,</p>
<p>the hyperactive states,</p>
<p>are correlated with elevated levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>Likewise, it has been seen over and over throughout history</p>
<p>that individuals that have mild forms of schizophrenia</p>
<p>or even full-blown schizophrenia,</p>
<p>many famous painters, for instance, or musicians,</p>
<p>they are known to have elevated levels of dopamine</p>
<p>and they are quite creative.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean everybody who&rsquo;s creative</p>
<p>has elevated levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s likely that their levels of dopamine</p>
<p>are at least not diminished,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that non-creative people</p>
<p>have low levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t get carried away with the interpretation here,</p>
<p>but the point is this.</p>
<p>Dopamine levels strongly relate to the probability</p>
<p>that you can engage in convergent and divergent thinking,</p>
<p>and they do so in the following way.</p>
<p>When dopamine levels are high,</p>
<p>divergent thinking is more likely.</p>
<p>That is, when people have a lot of dopamine</p>
<p>circulating in their system,</p>
<p>they tend to be very expansive with their ideas,</p>
<p>they tend to brainstorm a lot,</p>
<p>they tend to be comfortable and even want to,</p>
<p>or reflexively, throw out a lot of ideas</p>
<p>that sometimes even seem a little disconnected.</p>
<p>Some people might think of this</p>
<p>as kind of attention deficit, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the idea of throwing out disparate ideas, right?</p>
<p>You know, you hear sometimes,</p>
<p>you throw things against the wall and see what sticks.</p>
<p>Well, these people, that&rsquo;s obviously an analogy,</p>
<p>but people are throwing lots of things against the wall</p>
<p>and seeing what stick,</p>
<p>and then seeing how the things that stick fit together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s divergent thinking,</p>
<p>and elevations in dopamine</p>
<p>tend to increase divergent thinking.</p>
<p>However, they tend to do this</p>
<p>in a kind of an inverted U-shaped way.</p>
<p>For those of you that are watching on YouTube,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just drawing kind of a hump, obviously,</p>
<p>and for those of you listening,</p>
<p>just imagine a U, the shape of a letter U,</p>
<p>and then just flip it upside down</p>
<p>so it looks like a bump.</p>
<p>Turns out that when dopamine levels are very low,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a low probability of divergent thinking.</p>
<p>When dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a high level or probability of divergent thinking.</p>
<p>But when dopamine levels go very, very high,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s, again, a reduction in divergent thinking.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s a kind of a sweet spot</p>
<p>of elevated dopamine for divergent thinking.</p>
<p>And again, divergent thinking is critical</p>
<p>for the creativity process,</p>
<p>because creativity, by definition,</p>
<p>is taking a novel set of ideas</p>
<p>and arranging them in a particular way,</p>
<p>or taking existing ideas and arranging them in a novel way</p>
<p>that then you eventually converge on some new product,</p>
<p>new idea, new song, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, convergent thinking follows a very different pattern.</p>
<p>When dopamine levels are high,</p>
<p>convergent thinking is not very likely.</p>
<p>And when dopamine levels are low,</p>
<p>convergent thinking is very likely.</p>
<p>So here, using arguably a very reductionist view,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at all of this thing of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re calling creativity</p>
<p>through a very neuroscience-y reductionist lens,</p>
<p>we can say this.</p>
<p>The creative process involves going into a state</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re willing to consider a lot of options,</p>
<p>many of which seem distantly</p>
<p>or not even connected to one another.</p>
<p>And dopamine facilitates that divergent thinking state</p>
<p>in which you are perfectly happy,</p>
<p>and in fact, experience a kind of a joy or elation,</p>
<p>a comfort and a pleasure</p>
<p>in organizing all these different ideas</p>
<p>that to anyone else might seem not that related.</p>
<p>But when your dopamine levels are elevated,</p>
<p>these all seem like great ideas</p>
<p>and that maybe there are connections there, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not accepting all of them as true and valid</p>
<p>and interesting and combining them,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this idea that it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>entertaining the possibility, at least for moments.</p>
<p>And then as dopamine levels drop,</p>
<p>there is the process of convergent thinking,</p>
<p>which is taking options down off the wall,</p>
<p>saying, no, no, that doesn&rsquo;t fit with that,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fit with that, but ah, that fits with that,</p>
<p>and that can work, that feels right or sounds right</p>
<p>or looks right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the creativity process.</p>
<p>And so I think this is not just important</p>
<p>for understanding cannabis,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll get back to in a moment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important for understanding creativity</p>
<p>and brain states in general.</p>
<p>Brain states are not, as we would say,</p>
<p>a square wave function.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just drop into a trench of creativity.</p>
<p>Creativity is not an event, it&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m telling you is that it&rsquo;s a process</p>
<p>that involves divergent thinking and consideration</p>
<p>of a lot of different ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correlated with high, but not too high dopamine.</p>
<p>And then one has to transition</p>
<p>into a state of convergent thinking,</p>
<p>which is really homing in on the ideas</p>
<p>that seem to have validity or that could have validity</p>
<p>and getting rid of everything else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s associated with low dopamine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about logical implementation and consideration</p>
<p>as opposed to thinking about and considering everything.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s now return to the question</p>
<p>of whether or not cannabis</p>
<p>and its different components increase creativity.</p>
<p>And when you look at the literature on this,</p>
<p>you find studies that very clearly point to a yes,</p>
<p>it increases creativity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not surprising, therefore,</p>
<p>that cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,</p>
<p>that is dopamine levels in certain brain areas,</p>
<p>in particular brain areas involved in thinking and planning.</p>
<p>Okay, so cannabis increases dopamine in these areas,</p>
<p>elevated dopamine increases divergent thinking,</p>
<p>and divergent thinking is associated with creativity.</p>
<p>And there are studies that support the idea</p>
<p>that cannabis can increase creativity.</p>
<p>However, there are at least as many studies</p>
<p>that say that cannabis does not increase creativity,</p>
<p>that cannabis increases consideration of multiple ideas,</p>
<p>perhaps through elevation of dopamine and related systems,</p>
<p>but that ultimately the ideas that converge from that</p>
<p>are not truly creative ideas.</p>
<p>At least they don&rsquo;t meet the criteria</p>
<p>for creative brainstorming</p>
<p>and extraction of ideas that are truly novel.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t increase creativity.</p>
<p>So which one is it?</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, there&rsquo;s an entirely</p>
<p>distinct set of literature</p>
<p>that has taken all the other literature into consideration.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where we arrive.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a really nice study</p>
<p>that explored creativity in cannabis users.</p>
<p>And we will provide a link to this study.</p>
<p>First author is Emily LaFrance,</p>
<p>and the title of the paper,</p>
<p>so somewhat amusing in its own right,</p>
<p>which is, it starts with a question,</p>
<p>inspired by Mary Jane, of course,</p>
<p>Mary Jane being one of the kind of old school versions</p>
<p>of our ways of talking about cannabis or marijuana.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people refer to it mainly as pot,</p>
<p>has other names too, of course.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper is inspired by Mary Jane,</p>
<p>mechanisms underlying enhanced creativity in cannabis users.</p>
<p>And I really like this study for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they looked at people who did not use cannabis</p>
<p>as well as people who use cannabis.</p>
<p>So they had two different groups,</p>
<p>but they did not evaluate creativity of the cannabis users</p>
<p>while they were under the influence of cannabis.</p>
<p>They looked at the level of creativity</p>
<p>in these cannabis users</p>
<p>when they were not under the influence of cannabis</p>
<p>and asked whether or not their ability to be creative</p>
<p>was enhanced by cannabis.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to compare this to studies</p>
<p>in which people come into the laboratory</p>
<p>and actually use cannabis,</p>
<p>and then they evaluate creativity under that context.</p>
<p>But this study has some unique takeaways</p>
<p>that I think are really interesting.</p>
<p>First of all, they did, yes,</p>
<p>see evidence for enhanced creativity.</p>
<p>And when I say enhanced creativity,</p>
<p>I mean within the context of this divergent thinking thing</p>
<p>that I talked about a moment ago.</p>
<p>And when I say enhanced,</p>
<p>I mean significantly greater than in non-users,</p>
<p>so people that don&rsquo;t use cannabis.</p>
<p>So right now I can imagine</p>
<p>that all the cannabis users are cheering,</p>
<p>yes, cannabis increases creativity,</p>
<p>makes people more creative than they would be otherwise.</p>
<p>Well, this is interesting.</p>
<p>We have to ask ourselves how that was accomplished.</p>
<p>And it turns out that one of the major ways</p>
<p>in which it was accomplished is that cannabis users,</p>
<p>even if they are not under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>are far more open to novel ideas,</p>
<p>and they have a more explorative and sort of reduced anxiety</p>
<p>or I should say lower anxiety mode of thinking</p>
<p>when they explore novel ideas,</p>
<p>which is essential for divergent thinking.</p>
<p>So they observe both enhanced divergent</p>
<p>and convergent creative type thinking in cannabis users.</p>
<p>And the source of that they conclude is,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;ll just quote,</p>
<p>cannabis users higher levels of openness to experience</p>
<p>are responsible for their enhanced self-reported creativity</p>
<p>and convergent thinking test performance.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily that cannabis</p>
<p>is increasing the capacity of the brain areas</p>
<p>that are associated with creativity,</p>
<p>but rather cannabis appears to be increasing an openness</p>
<p>and probably doing that in part through lowering anxiety</p>
<p>in particular people.</p>
<p>And that openness is leading to inclusion of more ideas</p>
<p>during the divergent thinking process, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re willing to consider throwing up more things</p>
<p>on the wall to see if they stick, so to speak.</p>
<p>So in their conclusions,</p>
<p>they have a really nice statement.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll just read from the paper</p>
<p>because they said it better than I ever could.</p>
<p>Quote, while mainstream media has propagated the idea</p>
<p>that cannabis expands the mind and enhances creativity,</p>
<p>our results show the link between cannabis and creativity</p>
<p>is largely a spurious correlation,</p>
<p>meaning that it&rsquo;s not the case</p>
<p>that cannabis increases creativity,</p>
<p>but, and I inserted the but in this quote,</p>
<p>but driven by differences in personality</p>
<p>that are related to cannabis use.</p>
<p>For example, openness to experience</p>
<p>that are related to both cannabis use</p>
<p>and augmented creativity.</p>
<p>This is a real chicken-egg argument.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>What I mean is this paper finds</p>
<p>that people who are more open to experience</p>
<p>are more likely to use cannabis</p>
<p>and people who use cannabis</p>
<p>are going to be more open to new experiences.</p>
<p>And that combination of features, openness to experience</p>
<p>and what that openness to new experiences brings</p>
<p>enhances the convergent and divergent thinking</p>
<p>that is characteristic of the creative process.</p>
<p>So in short, cannabis increases creativity,</p>
<p>but through changes in personality</p>
<p>that tap into the creative process</p>
<p>rather than directly impacting the neural circuits</p>
<p>that for instance, turn on creativity.</p>
<p>And I have to say this study is really important</p>
<p>because by exploring cannabis users</p>
<p>not while under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>they were able to tap into this very important,</p>
<p>what I believe to be fact.</p>
<p>Because if you think about a study</p>
<p>in which you would have one group using cannabis</p>
<p>and another group not using cannabis,</p>
<p>and then you give them some tasks</p>
<p>that taps into creativity, you will see effects.</p>
<p>And very likely you&rsquo;ll see effects</p>
<p>where cannabis might even increase</p>
<p>divergent convergent thinking and creativity</p>
<p>that those results have actually been published</p>
<p>many times before.</p>
<p>But given the varied effects of cannabis and THC</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>through all that complex signaling stuff,</p>
<p>you can imagine that there will also be other studies.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are where divergent</p>
<p>and convergent thinking and creativity</p>
<p>is not assisted by cannabis</p>
<p>and might even be reduced by ingesting cannabis.</p>
<p>However, if one considers that divergent thinking</p>
<p>is absolutely crucial to the creativity process</p>
<p>and the range of things that one will explore</p>
<p>will be enhanced by openness</p>
<p>and by reduced levels of anxiety.</p>
<p>So a willingness to explore different options,</p>
<p>some of which might seem completely crazy,</p>
<p>and cannabis increases the personality types</p>
<p>and reduces the anxiety that create that sense of openness.</p>
<p>Well, then it makes perfect sense</p>
<p>why cannabis would increase creativity</p>
<p>in certain individuals, but not directly.</p>
<p>And this study, the one I just referred to,</p>
<p>which I should say was published</p>
<p>in the journal Consciousness and Cognition,</p>
<p>and again, we&rsquo;ll provide a link to it,</p>
<p>did a wonderful job of teasing out</p>
<p>this impact of cannabis on personality,</p>
<p>which then impacts creativity.</p>
<p>So if somebody asks you, or if you&rsquo;re wondering,</p>
<p>or if you feel like cannabis increases creativity,</p>
<p>in some sense, the answer is yes,</p>
<p>but the answer is yes because of the ways</p>
<p>that it shapes openness to new ideas.</p>
<p>And can, I should say can, because not in everybody,</p>
<p>but can in some individuals reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>What this means is that if you are somebody</p>
<p>who experiences anxiety or increased levels of focus</p>
<p>from cannabis, regardless of the strain,</p>
<p>and here I have to imagine people</p>
<p>are exploring different strains</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re exploring them at all,</p>
<p>exploring different modes of delivery,</p>
<p>smoking or ingestible, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who experiences anxiety,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that you won&rsquo;t have the increased openness</p>
<p>to experience and divergent ideas</p>
<p>that will facilitate creativity.</p>
<p>However, if you are somebody</p>
<p>who achieves heightened levels of relaxation</p>
<p>and reduced levels of anxiety from cannabis,</p>
<p>regardless of which strain we happen to be talking about,</p>
<p>well then, yes, it will position you</p>
<p>to be in a heightened state of creativity,</p>
<p>at least as defined by convergent and divergent thinking.</p>
<p>One of the more characteristic,</p>
<p>or I should say stereotype qualities</p>
<p>of people that smoke a lot of marijuana</p>
<p>or ingest cannabis through other means</p>
<p>is their changed patterns of speech.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a kind of a lore in the clinical realm</p>
<p>that you can predict or get some strong indication</p>
<p>as to whether or not somebody is a cannabis user</p>
<p>or pot smoker based on their voice</p>
<p>and their particular tone of voice</p>
<p>and their lack of inflection.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of speculation here,</p>
<p>but fortunately it&rsquo;s been studied.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to discuss now</p>
<p>whether or not cannabis can impact patterns of speech,</p>
<p>both acutely, meaning while under the influence of cannabis</p>
<p>and over time in chronic cannabis users.</p>
<p>And when I say chronic cannabis use,</p>
<p>I want to be very specific what I mean.</p>
<p>Chronic cannabis use does not necessarily mean</p>
<p>that people are smoking cannabis</p>
<p>or ingesting cannabis every day.</p>
<p>Although certainly if they are,</p>
<p>that qualifies as chronic use.</p>
<p>Chronic use is regular use over time</p>
<p>of anywhere from twice a week or more.</p>
<p>So using cannabis once a month</p>
<p>would not be considered chronic use,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s for many, many years.</p>
<p>Using cannabis or ingesting cannabis in some way or form</p>
<p>twice a week would be considered chronic use.</p>
<p>And then of course,</p>
<p>some of you out there are going to ask me to split hairs</p>
<p>and say, well, what if somebody uses it twice a month?</p>
<p>Well, listen, the clinical literature</p>
<p>and the scientific literature don&rsquo;t get that specific.</p>
<p>And of course, there are an infinite number of ways</p>
<p>to arrange one&rsquo;s cannabis use,</p>
<p>everything from zero, none at all,</p>
<p>to constantly every day, all day and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>But think of chronic use as twice a week or more.</p>
<p>Think of occasional use as less than that</p>
<p>and realize that within the realm of chronic use, excuse me,</p>
<p>that or more can be anywhere from twice a week</p>
<p>to every day to just in the evenings, et cetera.</p>
<p>The effects of chronic use of cannabis,</p>
<p>as I just defined it, on speech have been studied</p>
<p>because of this characteristic drawing out</p>
<p>of certain syllables, a slowing of speech,</p>
<p>and in many cases, a total change or alteration</p>
<p>in the way that people speak and use language,</p>
<p>both when under the influence of cannabis</p>
<p>and when not under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>if they are chronic users.</p>
<p>And here, we really want to distinguish</p>
<p>between THC and CBD and just make it really simple</p>
<p>and say that CBD is not responsible</p>
<p>for most of the psychoactive effects of cannabis,</p>
<p>whereas THC is.</p>
<p>And again, the ratio of CBD to THC</p>
<p>is going to be relevant there,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just think about cannabis and THC</p>
<p>as one in the same for this portion of the discussion,</p>
<p>realizing that, of course,</p>
<p>they are not exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an excellent study entitled</p>
<p>Adults with History of Recreational Cannabis Use</p>
<p>Have Altered Speech Production.</p>
<p>And we will provide a link to that.</p>
<p>First author, Adam Vogel, really liked this paper.</p>
<p>It was published in the journal</p>
<p>Drug and Alcohol Dependence.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to it for you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to peruse it in more detail.</p>
<p>The title itself,</p>
<p>Adults with a History of Recreational Cannabis Use</p>
<p>Have Altered Speech Production,</p>
<p>tells you pretty much everything you need to know,</p>
<p>except there&rsquo;s some important nuance in here</p>
<p>because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>people who smoke sativa varieties of cannabis</p>
<p>oftentimes will become more talkative, much more talkative.</p>
<p>However, whether or not people tend to rely</p>
<p>on sativa cannabis use or indica cannabis use,</p>
<p>there is a very consistent finding</p>
<p>that people who are chronic users,</p>
<p>again, twice a week or more,</p>
<p>recreational use or medicinal use,</p>
<p>undergo pretty profound changes in the way that they speak,</p>
<p>but in a very specific set of ways.</p>
<p>Now, first of all,</p>
<p>the changes in speech shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us at all</p>
<p>because both sativa varieties of cannabis</p>
<p>and indica varieties of cannabis</p>
<p>impact those brain centers involved in movement,</p>
<p>the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>Remember the go-no-go circuitry,</p>
<p>the circuitry that makes you want to do things</p>
<p>and the circuitry that makes you want to withhold action,</p>
<p>and it tends to shift the body and brain</p>
<p>toward more inaction.</p>
<p>And cannabis impacts CB1 receptors in the cerebellum,</p>
<p>which is involved in motor planning, execution, and balance.</p>
<p>So regardless of whether or not people are using cannabis</p>
<p>of the sativa or the indica variety,</p>
<p>there are disruptions in motor circuitry.</p>
<p>And as you may have heard,</p>
<p>if you listened to our episode</p>
<p>with Rockefeller professor, Dr. Eric Jarvis,</p>
<p>who works on speech and movement,</p>
<p>speech is movement, right?</p>
<p>The movements of the mouth, the movements of the hands,</p>
<p>those are intimately related in terms of our speech.</p>
<p>In fact, the centers of the brain</p>
<p>involved in hand movements</p>
<p>are part of the speech areas and vice versa.</p>
<p>Eric actually pointed out</p>
<p>that if you put your hands behind your back,</p>
<p>provided you normally do have use of your hands,</p>
<p>it actually will reduce your fluidity of speech.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to put them back in front of me now.</p>
<p>The point is smoking marijuana</p>
<p>or consuming marijuana by edible changes one&rsquo;s speech</p>
<p>and does it in a very specific way.</p>
<p>And in this study by Adam Vogel and colleagues,</p>
<p>they explored a huge different variety of aspects of speech.</p>
<p>And this can be done using spectral processing,</p>
<p>which is fancy nerd speak</p>
<p>for looking at how much inflection there is</p>
<p>or looking at how long people hold vowels</p>
<p>or consonants, et cetera.</p>
<p>And again, these are people</p>
<p>not under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>but rather people who tend to be</p>
<p>under the influence of cannabis</p>
<p>when not participating in the study.</p>
<p>In other words, chronic recreational cannabis users.</p>
<p>So what are the two major shifts that cannabis causes</p>
<p>on our patterns of speech?</p>
<p>Well, the first one is a change</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s called spectral tilt.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s fancy nerd speak</p>
<p>for vocal effort and intensity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a pot smoker, I confess.</p>
<p>But if I were to say the sentence,</p>
<p>vocal effort and intensity</p>
<p>are important components of speech.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I would say that sentence</p>
<p>if I was striving to enunciate very carefully</p>
<p>and to accent certain words and syllables.</p>
<p>A pot smoker or somebody who uses recreational cannabis</p>
<p>fairly often would have reduced spectral tilt,</p>
<p>AKA vocal effort intensity,</p>
<p>and might say spectral tilt is vocal effort and intensity.</p>
<p>And it differed between groups</p>
<p>and appeared to change in line</p>
<p>with the duration of abstinence from cannabis use.</p>
<p>That I think is not a far cry</p>
<p>from the change in spectral tilt that they observed here.</p>
<p>In addition, there are changes in verbal timing.</p>
<p>That is pronunciation of words</p>
<p>and accenting particular syllables of words</p>
<p>in people that consume cannabis or smoke cannabis.</p>
<p>So rather than emphasize particular words within a sentence,</p>
<p>so again, I&rsquo;ll just use a sentence from the paper</p>
<p>so that you can gain more knowledge from the paper.</p>
<p>Cannabis, and I&rsquo;ll say it the way that I would say it</p>
<p>since I&rsquo;m not a cannabis user.</p>
<p>Cannabis, marijuana,</p>
<p>is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world</p>
<p>with approximately 4% of adults aged 15 to 64 years</p>
<p>reporting recent use.</p>
<p>And the citation is from the United Nations</p>
<p>Office on Drugs and Crime, 2019.</p>
<p>So that would be the way</p>
<p>that I would typically read that sentence.</p>
<p>And having gone into the data in this paper</p>
<p>and of course evaluated references therein,</p>
<p>and listen to some of the spectral analysis</p>
<p>that they include as data,</p>
<p>you can literally go into these papers online</p>
<p>and hear recordings of people who are cannabis users</p>
<p>or non-cannabis users.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll try and give you a clear sense</p>
<p>without picking an extreme example</p>
<p>of how somebody who&rsquo;s a fairly consistent</p>
<p>or even occasional cannabis user</p>
<p>might read that very same sentence.</p>
<p>Cannabis, marijuana,</p>
<p>is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world</p>
<p>with approximately 4% of adults aged 15 to 64 years</p>
<p>reporting recent use.</p>
<p>And the citation comes from the United Nation</p>
<p>Office on Drugs and Crime, 2019.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll notice that wasn&rsquo;t a dramatic difference.</p>
<p>And of course I could have taken the liberty</p>
<p>to pick an extreme example of the sort</p>
<p>that they did occasionally observe</p>
<p>in evaluating subjects for this paper.</p>
<p>I could have said something like cannabis,</p>
<p>marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug.</p>
<p>But frankly, that would have been selecting</p>
<p>an outlier example and I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to skew the data as they say.</p>
<p>Rather, if you heard the first time I read the sentence</p>
<p>and the second time I read the sentence,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s mainly different is the difference</p>
<p>in the amount of enunciation and accenting</p>
<p>of particular words and symbols within a sentence.</p>
<p>So the total content that&rsquo;s delivered is exactly the same.</p>
<p>And while I wasn&rsquo;t measuring my pace,</p>
<p>the overall rate of communication is essentially the same,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s less sort of lilting and falling of the voice</p>
<p>and less accenting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the major consistent effect of cannabis use.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are examples of people</p>
<p>who are using a lot of cannabis</p>
<p>and it impacts brain centers involved</p>
<p>in movement and speech.</p>
<p>So much so that they really do have the really drawn out</p>
<p>kind of, and oftentimes this will be detected in the laugh.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s this sort of stereotypical stoner laugh</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s sometimes called, rather than say,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s a fake laugh, obviously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to make myself laugh</p>
<p>if something&rsquo;s not actually funny.</p>
<p>I have to think of something funny.</p>
<p>When people will say, like, that&rsquo;s a bit more</p>
<p>of the way I might laugh, like,</p>
<p>sort of the inspiratory laugh or the,</p>
<p>which is expiratory laugh.</p>
<p>People who use cannabis chronically will often do that.</p>
<p>Which is sort of the back of the throat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of this, the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s neither inspiratory nor expiratory laugh.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, there&rsquo;s an entire literature</p>
<p>on inspiratory inhaling versus expiratory laughs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a literature on cannabis</p>
<p>altering the pattern of inspiratory and expiratory laughs.</p>
<p>It almost sounds like a sarcastic laugh</p>
<p>when in fact they may not be feeling sarcastic at all.</p>
<p>And I have a very close friend and colleague</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a phenomenal neurosurgeon and neuroscientist</p>
<p>by the name of Dr. Eddie Chang.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF</p>
<p>and his lab and him are expert in the study</p>
<p>of neuroscience controlling language and speech.</p>
<p>And he often tells me that he can predict</p>
<p>with almost certainty whether or not somebody</p>
<p>is a regular cannabis user based not just</p>
<p>on the patterns of speech that they use,</p>
<p>but even just by recording specific neurons in their brain</p>
<p>that underlie the laugh reflex</p>
<p>and certain patterns of speech.</p>
<p>So this idea that cannabis use changes your ability</p>
<p>to speak and enunciate clearly does appear to be true.</p>
<p>And the stereotype that cannabis use tends to create more</p>
<p>of a drawl or kind of a, if you will, a laziness</p>
<p>in the laugh and some of the reflexive enunciations</p>
<p>that people use does also appear to be true.</p>
<p>And I say all that, of course, with the caveat</p>
<p>that many people out there will know individuals</p>
<p>or perhaps you yourselves are individuals</p>
<p>that may use cannabis,</p>
<p>but that have incredible articulation,</p>
<p>probably better than mine and better than other people</p>
<p>out there who speak for a living.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that 100% of people</p>
<p>that use cannabis regularly can&rsquo;t speak well or clearly,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s simply not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to communicate that idea at all,</p>
<p>but it is the case that people who are regular cannabis</p>
<p>users are impacting the neural circuits involved</p>
<p>in movement, movement also controls speech</p>
<p>and therefore cannabis is impacting speech.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to turn our attention</p>
<p>to whether or not cannabis can increase sexual activity,</p>
<p>sexual desire and or sexual function.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to be talking about libido,</p>
<p>about sexual desire and about effects</p>
<p>of cannabis on hormones.</p>
<p>And while this might sound like a discussion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s purely oriented towards recreational use of cannabis,</p>
<p>that is people using cannabis to heighten</p>
<p>or increase their sense of arousal for sexual activity,</p>
<p>it actually ventures into the clinical realm too,</p>
<p>meaning there have been excellent peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll describe to you in a moment,</p>
<p>exploring the use of cannabis or THC more specifically</p>
<p>for something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,</p>
<p>which refers to a persistent or recurrent deficiency</p>
<p>or absence of sexual fantasies and thoughts</p>
<p>and or desire for or receptivity to sexual activity.</p>
<p>This is a disorder that is fairly common</p>
<p>anywhere from six to 9% of people, both males and females.</p>
<p>It used to be considered higher prevalence</p>
<p>in females than in males,</p>
<p>but now those numbers seem to be evening out.</p>
<p>So basically there are anywhere from six to 9%</p>
<p>of people out there who have very diminished sexual desire.</p>
<p>And so a number of those people are interested</p>
<p>in figuring out ways to increase</p>
<p>their amount of sexual desire.</p>
<p>And of course there are people in the general population</p>
<p>who may not have hypoactive sexual desire disorder,</p>
<p>who are interested in using cannabis recreationally</p>
<p>in order to increase their desire for</p>
<p>or their experience of sexual activity.</p>
<p>Now, first we have to acknowledge that sexual desire</p>
<p>and activity is a complex set of processes,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s not just one event, sex, the verb,</p>
<p>it involves arousal, it involves sex, the verb,</p>
<p>and it involves a whole set of mindsets and emotional states</p>
<p>that vary tremendously between individuals.</p>
<p>But once again, we can distill out a few basic principles</p>
<p>and I should emphasize these are by no means</p>
<p>the only chemicals in neural circuits involved</p>
<p>in the sexual arc, as we&rsquo;ll call it,</p>
<p>desire, the act of sex, et cetera,</p>
<p>but they are central to it, they are vital to it.</p>
<p>They would be considered what I would call necessary,</p>
<p>but not sufficient, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be other chemicals involved too,</p>
<p>but the main chemicals in neural circuits</p>
<p>are those involved in dopamine.</p>
<p>So the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway</p>
<p>in particular brain structure called nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about more in a moment,</p>
<p>is vital to all motivated behaviors</p>
<p>and to the seeking out of all particular types</p>
<p>of pleasurable experiences and sex is no exception.</p>
<p>So when we hear that the nucleus accumbens is activated,</p>
<p>that almost always means that dopamine has been released</p>
<p>in that area and other areas of the brain and body,</p>
<p>and we can consider dopamine central</p>
<p>to the desire for, pursuit of, and act of sex.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there are molecules like oxytocin,</p>
<p>which are involved in pair bonding</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to be neural circuits</p>
<p>specific to the oxytocin circuitry.</p>
<p>But in terms of sexual arousal and sexual behavior,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the dopamine pathway in this nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>which are especially vital.</p>
<p>That allows us to address the question,</p>
<p>does cannabis increase, decrease,</p>
<p>or have no effect on sexual desire</p>
<p>and or the ability to have sex?</p>
<p>And therein, we will find some very interesting answers</p>
<p>because once again, it will point to the fact</p>
<p>that the effects of cannabis on different individuals</p>
<p>can be highly divergent.</p>
<p>Meaning in one set of individuals,</p>
<p>cannabis will make them far less anxious.</p>
<p>And in another set of individuals,</p>
<p>the same strain of cannabis at the same dosage</p>
<p>will make them extremely anxious.</p>
<p>The same can be said also of sexual activity.</p>
<p>And this was beautifully illustrated</p>
<p>in the context of sexual desire</p>
<p>in the journal Psychopharmacology</p>
<p>in a paper published in 2017.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Individual Prolactin Reactivity</p>
<p>Modulates Response of Nucleus Accumbens to Erotic Stimuli</p>
<p>During Acute Cannabis Intoxication, an fMRI Pilot Study.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give a little bit of definition</p>
<p>to some of the terms in the title</p>
<p>that will make it easier for you to understand the paper,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;ll just march through the results</p>
<p>because they are very straightforward</p>
<p>and easy to understand and very interesting.</p>
<p>fMRI is just Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</p>
<p>So basically subjects in this experiment</p>
<p>came into the laboratory.</p>
<p>They were either people who had not used cannabis before</p>
<p>or who had used cannabis before.</p>
<p>They were placed into a brain scanner,</p>
<p>one of these fMRI devices.</p>
<p>It looks like a tube that people are backed up into</p>
<p>and then they can view images in there</p>
<p>and their brain can be imaged</p>
<p>without having to remove any skull</p>
<p>or drill into the skull, no neurosurgery.</p>
<p>The participants in this study</p>
<p>were grouped according to whether or not</p>
<p>they had experienced any aphrodisiac effects</p>
<p>during the intoxication with cannabis.</p>
<p>So that would be the first group, group A.</p>
<p>They literally called it group A for aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>And then the second group,</p>
<p>and this is the only thing I don&rsquo;t like about this study</p>
<p>is rather than call it group B,</p>
<p>they called them group non-A,</p>
<p>which is just gets a little confusing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll try and simplify all this.</p>
<p>There are two groups and one group experiences</p>
<p>sexual arousal when under the influence of cannabis.</p>
<p>THC specifically.</p>
<p>The other group does not.</p>
<p>And it turns out this is a very commonly observed</p>
<p>divergence of effects of cannabis.</p>
<p>Some people experience a lot of sexual arousal</p>
<p>from cannabis and THC in particular,</p>
<p>and some people do not.</p>
<p>In fact, they experience suppression of sexual desire.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always been a little bit mysterious</p>
<p>as to why that is.</p>
<p>Well, in this study,</p>
<p>they showed people in both groups, erotic images,</p>
<p>and they measured sexual arousal</p>
<p>through a number of different measures.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t go into all that.</p>
<p>It was largely subjective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been other studies where they&rsquo;ve actually</p>
<p>measured things like erections in males</p>
<p>and vaginal lubrication in females.</p>
<p>These are so-called autonomic responses</p>
<p>that people can&rsquo;t lie about, so to speak,</p>
<p>and that tap into other aspects</p>
<p>of the so-called sexual arousal process.</p>
<p>In this study, they also took blood samples</p>
<p>to look at the concentration of things like cannabinoids.</p>
<p>So this is a really nice study</p>
<p>in that they actually measured how much THC</p>
<p>was in the bloodstream in different individuals</p>
<p>who reacted to these erotic stimuli in different ways.</p>
<p>And they measured hormones,</p>
<p>namely cortisol, which is a stress hormone,</p>
<p>which tends to negatively correlate</p>
<p>with sexual arousal, and prolactin.</p>
<p>And the interesting takeaway from the study was</p>
<p>that for people, and it didn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if it was males or females,</p>
<p>because they looked at both,</p>
<p>for people that experienced elevated prolactin levels</p>
<p>under cannabis intoxication, that&rsquo;s how they refer to it,</p>
<p>people take cannabis, they measure prolactin.</p>
<p>Some people had elevated prolactin, some people did not.</p>
<p>For the people that had elevated levels of prolactin,</p>
<p>they did not observe activation of brain areas</p>
<p>associated with sexual arousal.</p>
<p>In this case, the right nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>so you have two nucleus accumbi, I guess they&rsquo;d be called,</p>
<p>one on each side of the brain,</p>
<p>and the activation of that brain area</p>
<p>is strongly associated with dopamine and with arousal</p>
<p>and sexual arousal in particular in this study.</p>
<p>And if people had elevated prolactin,</p>
<p>they did not experience activation of nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>and they did not report feeling sexually aroused</p>
<p>to those pictures, at least not to the same degree</p>
<p>as the other group.</p>
<p>So some people&rsquo;s prolactin levels go up</p>
<p>when they ingest cannabis,</p>
<p>and those people do not achieve elevated levels</p>
<p>of sexual arousal when under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re looking at erotic stimuli.</p>
<p>That makes sense because prolactin</p>
<p>is mutually inhibitory, as we would say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of in a push-pull with dopamine.</p>
<p>When dopamine levels are high,</p>
<p>prolactin levels tend to be low.</p>
<p>And when prolactin levels are high,</p>
<p>dopamine levels tend to be low.</p>
<p>The other group, so-called group A,</p>
<p>that experienced elevated levels of sexual arousal</p>
<p>when under the influence of cannabis</p>
<p>and viewing erotic stimuli,</p>
<p>that group did not show elevated levels of prolactin</p>
<p>in response to cannabis.</p>
<p>So this, I believe, resolves a longstanding controversy</p>
<p>in the field, which is,</p>
<p>does cannabis increase sexual arousal?</p>
<p>Well, it depends.</p>
<p>If you fall into the category of person</p>
<p>who has elevated levels of prolactin</p>
<p>in response to cannabis, then no,</p>
<p>actually cannabis will suppress</p>
<p>your sexual response and desire.</p>
<p>If, however, you are in the category of person</p>
<p>that does not have elevated levels of prolactin</p>
<p>in response to cannabis,</p>
<p>well, then erotic stimuli can potentially,</p>
<p>and in fact do, increase sexual arousal</p>
<p>in the majority of individuals.</p>
<p>Now, many of you are probably hearing this</p>
<p>and wondering whether or not you fall</p>
<p>into one category of individual or another.</p>
<p>And the key thing here to understand</p>
<p>is that levels of prolactin heading into the study</p>
<p>did not predict, did not predict,</p>
<p>whether or not people would respond to cannabis</p>
<p>with elevated or non-elevated</p>
<p>or even reduced levels of sexual arousal.</p>
<p>It was whether or not people&rsquo;s prolactin levels went up</p>
<p>or did not go up that predicted whether or not</p>
<p>their levels of arousal would go up or not.</p>
<p>So if you are somebody who, yes,</p>
<p>does experience elevated levels of sexual arousal</p>
<p>and function when under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s very likely that cannabis</p>
<p>does not increase your prolactin levels,</p>
<p>at least not to a significant degree while you&rsquo;re taking it.</p>
<p>And if you are somebody who does not experience increases</p>
<p>in sexual arousal or function</p>
<p>or even diminished sexual arousal and function</p>
<p>when under the influence of cannabis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely the cannabis</p>
<p>is increasing your levels of prolactin.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no way to know or predict</p>
<p>based on some other measure.</p>
<p>I think the outcome measure that is increased</p>
<p>or not increased or even reduced sexual arousal</p>
<p>is really the litmus test by which one can figure that out.</p>
<p>While we are on the topic of the effects of cannabis</p>
<p>on sexual function and hormones like prolactin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably worth mentioning</p>
<p>that cannabis has been studied extensively</p>
<p>for its impact on other hormones.</p>
<p>And we can summarize those literature in the following way.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m referring to studies only on adults.</p>
<p>We will talk about the developing brain and body</p>
<p>in a little bit, but it is very clear</p>
<p>that smoking cannabis increases prolactin levels.</p>
<p>Very, very clear.</p>
<p>Now you might say, didn&rsquo;t you just describe a study</p>
<p>about a set of individuals whose prolactin didn&rsquo;t increase?</p>
<p>And as a consequence, their level of sexual desire went up?</p>
<p>Yes, there are a subset of individuals</p>
<p>for which that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But people who smoke cannabis</p>
<p>do experience increases in prolactin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s especially pronounced</p>
<p>in people that smoke cannabis more than twice a week.</p>
<p>So this is important.</p>
<p>Prolactin, as I referred to earlier,</p>
<p>is reciprocal or mutually inhibitory with dopamine.</p>
<p>One way to think about this is in the context</p>
<p>of the normal sexual arousal arc,</p>
<p>whereby dopamine is increased</p>
<p>when people are sexually aroused,</p>
<p>but then after orgasm, both in males and females,</p>
<p>prolactin levels skyrocket.</p>
<p>This is actually what creates the so-called refractory period</p>
<p>for males during which they cannot achieve erection again</p>
<p>for some period of time.</p>
<p>That relates directly</p>
<p>to how long the prolactin increase lasts, okay?</p>
<p>Prolactin is also increased in new parents of all species,</p>
<p>including humans, which at least partially explains</p>
<p>some of the reported or typical reductions</p>
<p>in sexual desire and activity in new parents.</p>
<p>Now there are other reasons for that too, sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>but nature is smart and has arranged a set of hormones</p>
<p>and circuits in the brain and body</p>
<p>such that when tending to a newborn</p>
<p>is the most important thing, it relegates.</p>
<p>It reduces the importance of producing more children</p>
<p>and sexual activity in those moments and days and weeks,</p>
<p>sometimes longer.</p>
<p>So when prolactin levels are up, dopamine levels are down.</p>
<p>Smoking marijuana more than twice a week</p>
<p>significantly increases prolactin.</p>
<p>There are fewer studies exploring</p>
<p>whether or not edible marijuana has the same effect,</p>
<p>although the preliminary evidence suggests that it does not.</p>
<p>I get into this in a lot more detail in a future episode,</p>
<p>all about hormones with Dr. Kyle Gillette,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been on this podcast before,</p>
<p>but he verified that in my read of the literature</p>
<p>is that the edible forms of marijuana, cannabis,</p>
<p>probably again, let&rsquo;s put an asterisk next to this,</p>
<p>but it appears do not have as much</p>
<p>of a prolactin elevating effect</p>
<p>and therefore not as much of a dopamine suppressive effect</p>
<p>and therefore not as much</p>
<p>of a testosterone suppressing effect.</p>
<p>And that gets to the issue of testosterone.</p>
<p>Does cannabis marijuana suppress testosterone?</p>
<p>And this is a very controversial literature and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Some studies say, yes, it suppresses testosterone</p>
<p>in males and females.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that testosterone in females</p>
<p>is vital for libido and cognitive function,</p>
<p>cellular repair, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just important in males, of course.</p>
<p>However, other studies say that cannabis</p>
<p>does not decrease testosterone.</p>
<p>And it seems to depend on whether or not</p>
<p>the cannabis is brought into the system</p>
<p>by way of smoking or edible.</p>
<p>And it seems to depend on whether or not</p>
<p>the cannabis is used chronically by an individual or acutely.</p>
<p>And here, I just want to zoom out and say</p>
<p>that studies on cannabis or drugs of any kind in humans</p>
<p>are really complicated.</p>
<p>If you think about it,</p>
<p>someone has to come into the laboratory</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say you want to study chronic cannabis use.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t keep them in the laboratory all the time.</p>
<p>So you have to rely on their self-report</p>
<p>of how often they use cannabis and in what form.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t really control from one individual</p>
<p>to the next of how much cannabis and THC</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bringing into their system.</p>
<p>One person might smoke cannabis out of a bong</p>
<p>and take big, deep, lungs full bong inhalations or such.</p>
<p>Other people might smoke joints.</p>
<p>Other people might use edibles.</p>
<p>It becomes very complicated to know what people have done</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re reporting it accurately.</p>
<p>And no joke here,</p>
<p>especially if marijuana is impacting</p>
<p>the short-term memory systems.</p>
<p>They might not actually remember.</p>
<p>They might not be tracking it that well.</p>
<p>Contrast that with studies of the acute use of cannabis</p>
<p>and THC where people who are not regular users</p>
<p>come into the laboratory and now suddenly</p>
<p>with institutional guidelines and safety protocols</p>
<p>are under the influence of THC and cannabis.</p>
<p>Well, now you&rsquo;re dealing with a person</p>
<p>who may not have experience with the elevated heart rate</p>
<p>and blood pressure that&rsquo;s characteristic of cannabis</p>
<p>because it is a stimulant,</p>
<p>at least when initially brought into the system,</p>
<p>even if it might eventually lead to relaxation.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got someone who&rsquo;s anxious</p>
<p>or somebody who&rsquo;s not anxious, who&rsquo;s deeply relaxed,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to study these effects.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a moving target of sorts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very complicated to study marijuana and cannabis</p>
<p>and its various derivatives in this way.</p>
<p>Now you can probably appreciate better</p>
<p>as to why there&rsquo;s so little nuanced data</p>
<p>about sativa versus indica</p>
<p>versus different ratios of CBD and THC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult to do these studies</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>That said, the general rules are smoking marijuana</p>
<p>increases prolactin in men and women,</p>
<p>which will reduce dopamine and testosterone.</p>
<p>Smoking marijuana chronically,</p>
<p>meaning more than twice a week,</p>
<p>does appear to reduce testosterone significantly</p>
<p>and elevate so-called aromatase enzymes,</p>
<p>which are the enzymes that convert testosterone</p>
<p>into estrogen.</p>
<p>This might partially explain the effect</p>
<p>that occurs in about 35% of males,</p>
<p>which is gynecomastia,</p>
<p>which is a development of breast tissue in males,</p>
<p>in particular, young males</p>
<p>who have elevated levels of testosterone</p>
<p>or who are taking exogenous testosterone</p>
<p>for testosterone replacement therapy,</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re taking high doses, anabolic steroids,</p>
<p>or in females, the increase in breast size,</p>
<p>which is due to additional estrogen</p>
<p>from testosterone converted to estrogen.</p>
<p>So it does appear that marijuana and cannabis</p>
<p>increase estrogen, reduce testosterone,</p>
<p>increase prolactin, especially in chronic users.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure that some people out there will say,</p>
<p>well, their testosterone levels are exceedingly high</p>
<p>or they are fine,</p>
<p>meaning the constellation of symptoms</p>
<p>associated with low testosterone and elevated estrogen</p>
<p>are not present in them.</p>
<p>That probably means one of two things, or both.</p>
<p>They either had elevated levels of testosterone</p>
<p>to begin with, so their ceiling was higher,</p>
<p>so bringing it down didn&rsquo;t have that much of effect,</p>
<p>or that they have very low levels</p>
<p>of aromatase in their system.</p>
<p>There is some anecdotal evidence</p>
<p>that smoking particular parts of the marijuana plant,</p>
<p>in particular, the seeds,</p>
<p>can increase aromatase</p>
<p>and the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>I think in the old days, the lore was</p>
<p>the seeds make you sterile,</p>
<p>and I think that was related to what I just told you,</p>
<p>this increase in conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a vast literature</p>
<p>on the effects of cannabis on fertility.</p>
<p>It does seem, yes, it does seem to alter sperm motility</p>
<p>and sperm health and function</p>
<p>when taken chronically more than twice per week,</p>
<p>in particular, high doses of high-potency THC.</p>
<p>This is something we will cover in far more detail</p>
<p>on a future episode all about fertility.</p>
<p>And in females, there&rsquo;s an increase in estrogen</p>
<p>as a consequence of smoking marijuana</p>
<p>and increasing prolactin and estrogen in parallel.</p>
<p>Whether or not that&rsquo;s detrimental isn&rsquo;t clear,</p>
<p>although I point out that elevated estrogen and prolactin</p>
<p>can be associated, again, can be associated,</p>
<p>not necessarily, and certainly not causative,</p>
<p>but can be associated with elevated levels</p>
<p>of or frequency of breast cancer detection.</p>
<p>So cannabis and its effects on hormones</p>
<p>are not without consequence.</p>
<p>There are effects of cannabis on cortisol.</p>
<p>In some individuals, it greatly increases cortisol</p>
<p>due to the anxiety and paranoia it can create,</p>
<p>and in other individuals, it reduces cortisol.</p>
<p>Again, we have these divergent effects,</p>
<p>but I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>The effects on prolactin, meaning elevated prolactin,</p>
<p>the effects on testosterone, meaning,</p>
<p>at least most studies point to reduced levels of testosterone</p>
<p>and increased estrogen, that seems to be true</p>
<p>for most all individuals that chronically use cannabis,</p>
<p>whereas the effects on cortisol tend to be divergent.</p>
<p>Cannabis increases cortisol in some individuals</p>
<p>and decreases cortisol in others.</p>
<p>In general, increases in cortisol that are ongoing</p>
<p>are not healthy for us, and so on.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are other effects on hormones,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just briefly summarize those,</p>
<p>that THC in particular, not CBD, but THC in particular,</p>
<p>is known to be strongly inhibitory</p>
<p>for something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone.</p>
<p>This is a hormone that&rsquo;s released from the brain,</p>
<p>from the hypothalamus, that then feeds onto,</p>
<p>or I should say signals to the pituitary gland,</p>
<p>which is also near the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>a lot of stuff happening near the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>it turns out, biologically.</p>
<p>And reduced levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone,</p>
<p>caused by cannabis use,</p>
<p>reduced levels of LH, luteinizing hormone, and FSH,</p>
<p>which reduced levels of testosterone</p>
<p>and sperm production in males,</p>
<p>and egg health and ovulation</p>
<p>and menstrual function in females.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure there are a number of women out there</p>
<p>who will say they have perfectly normal menstrual cycles</p>
<p>despite using cannabis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not going to dispute that.</p>
<p>But if you are somebody who&rsquo;s trying to maximize fertility</p>
<p>or regulate or balance hormones,</p>
<p>marijuana and cannabis reduces GNRH,</p>
<p>that is the gonadotropin released from the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>and thereby reduces luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>which are released from the pituitary</p>
<p>and travel in the bloodstream</p>
<p>to support normal ovarian function and health</p>
<p>and normal testicular function and health</p>
<p>in females and males, respectively.</p>
<p>Up until now, I&rsquo;ve been discussing</p>
<p>the biological and psychological effects of cannabis.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to shift our attention</p>
<p>to some of the negative health effects of cannabis</p>
<p>and shine light on some of the individuals</p>
<p>or groups out there that need to be especially wary of</p>
<p>and probably avoid cannabis use entirely,</p>
<p>including ingestion of cannabis by way of edible.</p>
<p>And I frame things that way</p>
<p>because I think there is an increasingly large number</p>
<p>of people out there that appreciate</p>
<p>that smoking tobacco or smoking cannabis,</p>
<p>vaping tobacco, yes, vaping tobacco or vaping cannabis,</p>
<p>each and all have negative health consequences</p>
<p>on the lungs and on the so-called endothelial cells</p>
<p>of the body, the cells that make up the vasculature,</p>
<p>the capillaries and blood vessels.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already know this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make it very clear and I&rsquo;ll make it very brief.</p>
<p>Whether or not you smoke or vape, tobacco or cannabis,</p>
<p>you are severely impairing the function</p>
<p>of endothelial cells that make up the capillaries</p>
<p>and blood vessels of your brain and body.</p>
<p>And that is known to decrease cognitive capacity over time,</p>
<p>increase probability of strokes,</p>
<p>severely impact lung function,</p>
<p>and also lead to things like peripheral neuropathies.</p>
<p>It leads to sexual dysfunction</p>
<p>because of lack of blood flow to the genitals,</p>
<p>can lead to other aspects of reproductive damage,</p>
<p>including to the ovaries and testes.</p>
<p>Essentially, there is no other way to state it</p>
<p>except that smoking and vaping</p>
<p>have negative health consequences</p>
<p>that are independent of the substances</p>
<p>that people are trying to get into their bloodstream</p>
<p>by smoking or vaping.</p>
<p>So people smoke and vape tobacco</p>
<p>and people smoke and vape cannabis.</p>
<p>And in both cases,</p>
<p>if we just set aside the direct effects of tobacco</p>
<p>and the direct effects of cannabis,</p>
<p>we can confidently say that the process of smoking,</p>
<p>of inhaling smoke into the lungs, and yes, also vaping,</p>
<p>bringing the chemicals that transport nicotine,</p>
<p>or in this case, cannabis into the lungs by way of vaping,</p>
<p>are both severely detrimental to endothelial cells.</p>
<p>I think a few years ago, when vaping wasn&rsquo;t as prominent,</p>
<p>there was this question and this idea</p>
<p>that maybe vaping was going to be far healthier</p>
<p>or at least not as bad as smoking.</p>
<p>But now we can see a huge number</p>
<p>of negative health effects of vaping,</p>
<p>some of which are distinct from the effects of smoking.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;d like more information on smoking versus vaping,</p>
<p>please see the episode that I did on nicotine.</p>
<p>We will also do an entire episode</p>
<p>all about vaping in the future.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s really no way to slice it and dice it</p>
<p>or candy coat it.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that smoking has clear</p>
<p>and severe negative health consequences,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re smoking tobacco</p>
<p>or cannabis, THC, and vaping has negative health</p>
<p>consequences, whether or not you&rsquo;re using the vape</p>
<p>to bring in nicotine or THC</p>
<p>or some combination of THC and CBD.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply the way it is.</p>
<p>With that said, now I&rsquo;d like to focus our attention</p>
<p>on the direct effects that cannabis has,</p>
<p>either by way of THC action or by way of CBD action</p>
<p>in terms of positive or negative health effects</p>
<p>on the brain and body.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to explore that first as a function of age.</p>
<p>And the reason we&rsquo;re going to do that is related to a fact</p>
<p>that I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>which is that the CB1 and the CB2 receptors,</p>
<p>the two receptors for cannabis to which THC and CBD and CBN</p>
<p>and all other psychoactive compounds in cannabis bind to,</p>
<p>to have their actions are present throughout development.</p>
<p>Believe it or not,</p>
<p>they are present very soon after conception</p>
<p>and the CB1 and CB2 receptors actually play a critical role</p>
<p>in the development of the fetus.</p>
<p>Now you might wonder why that is,</p>
<p>because of course the developing fetus</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily expect to see cannabis</p>
<p>or to be exposed to cannabis and THC and CBD.</p>
<p>But as you recall, endogenous cannabinoids are present</p>
<p>in the adult brain and body and endogenous cannabinoids,</p>
<p>it turns out, are also present in the developing fetus.</p>
<p>In fact, endogenous cannabinoids are present</p>
<p>at much greater levels in the developing fetus</p>
<p>than they are after a child is born.</p>
<p>And levels of endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>actually go down across development.</p>
<p>I find this really interesting.</p>
<p>What this means is that endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>and activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors</p>
<p>are an integral part of neural development.</p>
<p>And this is going to become especially relevant</p>
<p>in considering whether or not pregnant mothers</p>
<p>should or should not use cannabis or CBD.</p>
<p>And it also points to some very interesting biology</p>
<p>in terms of how the brain develops</p>
<p>and how the body develops.</p>
<p>Now, the development of the brain and nervous system</p>
<p>and body is a fascinating and vast literature,</p>
<p>certainly far too vast to cover in today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>especially at this late hour, as it were.</p>
<p>But we will have a future episode</p>
<p>all about brain development.</p>
<p>In terms of the effects of cannabis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sufficient to say that cannabinoid receptors</p>
<p>are present and active in the developing fetus.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re present and active in the newborn.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re present and active in adolescence.</p>
<p>And across that time, from conception until adolescence,</p>
<p>endogenous cannabinoids are mainly responsible</p>
<p>for the actions of those cannabinoid receptors.</p>
<p>During that time, the cannabinoid receptors</p>
<p>are having very specific effects</p>
<p>that are distinct from their effects later in life.</p>
<p>And those effects can largely be explained</p>
<p>in terms of neural development.</p>
<p>Again, we don&rsquo;t have time for an entire lecture on this now,</p>
<p>but during development,</p>
<p>your body was a collection of a bunch of cells.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually called a blastula,</p>
<p>which means a ball of cells.</p>
<p>And then those cells actually have to grow out connections</p>
<p>and duplicate themselves.</p>
<p>And this is a very interesting process</p>
<p>by which neurons initially are situated far apart,</p>
<p>and then they grow out connections</p>
<p>and make contacts with one another.</p>
<p>They remove certain connections,</p>
<p>depending on what kind of life events you&rsquo;re exposed to.</p>
<p>If you have a wonderful event early in life</p>
<p>or a traumatic early life,</p>
<p>those connections change, et cetera.</p>
<p>The important point for today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>is that the CB1 receptor in particular</p>
<p>is expressed on every neuron in the developing brain</p>
<p>and has been shown to be important</p>
<p>for every aspect of neural development,</p>
<p>from the proliferation of cells,</p>
<p>meaning getting enough cells to create a brain,</p>
<p>to the outgrowth of the so-called axons,</p>
<p>the little wires that connect up neurons with one another,</p>
<p>to the steering, the direction in which those axons go</p>
<p>in development, which is essential.</p>
<p>And even so far as to explain the connections</p>
<p>that form between neurons, the so-called synapses,</p>
<p>and then how those synapses work.</p>
<p>So the basic statement here is that endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>and CB1 receptor activation are critical</p>
<p>for every aspect of brain wiring and development.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the statement I&rsquo;m about to make</p>
<p>is absolutely terrifying, at least to me,</p>
<p>and frankly, it should be terrifying to you as well.</p>
<p>And the statement is the current statistics</p>
<p>on cannabis use in pregnant mothers</p>
<p>is absolutely shocking.</p>
<p>The most recent survey of pregnant mothers</p>
<p>in the United States show that 15%, one five,</p>
<p>15% of pregnant mothers report using cannabis</p>
<p>in some form or another, either smoking it</p>
<p>or more likely ingestion of an edible,</p>
<p>because they are aware of the negative effects</p>
<p>of smoking on the developing fetus,</p>
<p>ingestion of an edible to increase THC</p>
<p>and or CBD during pregnancy, which to me,</p>
<p>I have to say as a developmental neurobiologist is,</p>
<p>frankly, it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely scary because that CB1 receptor</p>
<p>is not just a minor player in neural development,</p>
<p>it is absolutely central to every critical aspect</p>
<p>of brain wiring and development.</p>
<p>Now, the long-term implications</p>
<p>or even the short-term implications of this 15%</p>
<p>of mothers self-reporting the use of cannabis</p>
<p>at some point during pregnancy are not yet known.</p>
<p>This is, as we would say,</p>
<p>an experiment that&rsquo;s ongoing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t point out these data</p>
<p>and just implore you, please, please, please,</p>
<p>if you are pregnant or considering getting pregnant,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a cannabis user, whether or not you&rsquo;re using edibles,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a CBD user, please do whatever is necessary</p>
<p>to not ingest cannabis or smoke cannabis</p>
<p>or ingest CBD during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Now, there may be certain clinical indications</p>
<p>by which your physician and your OBGYN</p>
<p>and the pediatrician that will eventually be</p>
<p>the pediatrician for your child will prescribe CBD,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s hard to imagine what those are.</p>
<p>I contacted a number of different pediatricians and OBGYNs</p>
<p>and not a single one said they would ever suggest</p>
<p>and in fact would strongly discourage their patients</p>
<p>from using cannabis during pregnancy.</p>
<p>But I think that the advent of edible forms of cannabis</p>
<p>and the combination of THC and CBD in certain products</p>
<p>and the fact that most people view CBD as safer</p>
<p>because it does not include as, or does not have,</p>
<p>I should say, the psychoactive effects that THC does</p>
<p>has led to a situation where you have 15%</p>
<p>of pregnant mothers using cannabis</p>
<p>at some point during pregnancy</p>
<p>and maybe even frequently throughout pregnancy</p>
<p>and the effects on the developing fetus</p>
<p>are completely unknown, but recall that cannabis</p>
<p>and THC and CBD out-compete, meaning they park</p>
<p>in the receptor for endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>and prevent endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>from having their normal level and pattern of action.</p>
<p>So this is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>I cannot encourage you enough, or rather I should say,</p>
<p>I cannot discourage enough the use of cannabis</p>
<p>and any related compounds in cannabis,</p>
<p>edible or smoked, certainly not smoked,</p>
<p>but even edible during pregnancy.</p>
<p>And certainly in breastfeeding, lactating mothers,</p>
<p>the same is also true.</p>
<p>Recall that cannabis and THC and CBD</p>
<p>are incredibly lipophilic.</p>
<p>They are fat-soluble and they get into cells very readily</p>
<p>and they cross the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>they cross the blood-placental barrier.</p>
<p>So when I encountered this statistic,</p>
<p>I had to kind of wipe my eyes a few times.</p>
<p>I could not believe it.</p>
<p>And yet I cross-checked that number</p>
<p>with a few other studies.</p>
<p>A few others have come in a little bit lower at,</p>
<p>you know, somewhere like 13 to 14%,</p>
<p>and a few have come in a little bit higher,</p>
<p>but the average of 15% is both striking and shocking.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how to make the message more clear.</p>
<p>I hope that is clear.</p>
<p>Please do not use any cannabis, THC,</p>
<p>or related things, including CBD, smoked or edible</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re pregnant, lactating, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now we are at the point where we need to consider</p>
<p>some of the negative health effects of cannabis</p>
<p>that have been well-documented in peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>And before I do this,</p>
<p>I want to return to a point that I made earlier,</p>
<p>which is that nothing I am about to say</p>
<p>relates directly to issues of legality.</p>
<p>If we consider alcohol, for instance,</p>
<p>alcohol is legal in most areas of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly legal in the US,</p>
<p>and yet there&rsquo;s an age limit for its use.</p>
<p>Typically, it&rsquo;s not available to people</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re 21 or older.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say that certain people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use it before age 21, but it&rsquo;s not legal.</p>
<p>It is illegal to buy or possess alcohol,</p>
<p>consume alcohol before age 21.</p>
<p>And I think with good reason,</p>
<p>because the brain is still developing.</p>
<p>Likewise, we can have a informed discussion about cannabis</p>
<p>and its various components</p>
<p>that can fully acknowledge the reality,</p>
<p>which is that one of the major harms of cannabis</p>
<p>in the past has been the legal ramifications</p>
<p>of cannabis being illegal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a statement that is no longer controversial.</p>
<p>And this is not a discussion</p>
<p>about legalization or non-legalization.</p>
<p>If you look to the scientific literature,</p>
<p>the epidemiological literature,</p>
<p>there are wonderful data out of Carleton University</p>
<p>and elsewhere in Canada,</p>
<p>showing that many of the negative effects</p>
<p>of marijuana and THC</p>
<p>are due to the criminal justice system itself.</p>
<p>That is the creation of illicit drug businesses,</p>
<p>the creation of organized crime,</p>
<p>the creation of a number of different features</p>
<p>related to the illegality of cannabis.</p>
<p>And again, this isn&rsquo;t the topic of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>but that should be acknowledged.</p>
<p>And at the same time, we need to acknowledge</p>
<p>that when a compound, a drug,</p>
<p>or whatever you want to call it, becomes legal,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tendency to assume</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s safe and safe for everybody.</p>
<p>And with respect to cannabis and THC,</p>
<p>and perhaps even CBD, but certainly for THC</p>
<p>and cannabis that&rsquo;s smoked or vaped</p>
<p>or consumed in edible form,</p>
<p>that is simply not the case.</p>
<p>There are clear data pointing to negative health effects</p>
<p>of cannabis use and THC use,</p>
<p>which again is not to say that there are not</p>
<p>positive effects on mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those are out there and they exist.</p>
<p>And we will mention some of those, of course,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve talked about some of those,</p>
<p>creativity, for instance, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if we do not acknowledge the negative health effects</p>
<p>that are documented in the literature,</p>
<p>then we are overlooking some very important data,</p>
<p>especially as it relates to the development of psychosis</p>
<p>in certain individuals.</p>
<p>So with that said, there are very strong data,</p>
<p>and I will provide links to these resources,</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that for people</p>
<p>who are chronic users of cannabis,</p>
<p>that is using it twice a week or more,</p>
<p>that over time their levels of anxiety actually increase.</p>
<p>And this is true even for individuals</p>
<p>that are using strains of cannabis</p>
<p>that while under the influence of cannabis reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>Over time, meaning over the course of 12 or more months,</p>
<p>there is a well-documented effect of the anxiety relief</p>
<p>that cannabis and THC initially brought</p>
<p>being less and less potent.</p>
<p>That is people need to smoke more of it or ingest more THC</p>
<p>in order to achieve the same level of anxiety relief.</p>
<p>And in some cases, a switch from anxiety relief</p>
<p>to increase in anxiety.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s increase in anxiety,</p>
<p>not just when the drug is not being consumed,</p>
<p>but also while under the influence of the drug.</p>
<p>Why would that be?</p>
<p>We have to go back to our understanding</p>
<p>of the CB1 receptor and the potency with which THC</p>
<p>binds to that CB1 receptor.</p>
<p>When THC is brought into the system over and over again,</p>
<p>meaning twice a week or more,</p>
<p>the binding of THC to that CB1 receptor</p>
<p>eventually causes a sort of habituation or attenuation</p>
<p>of the entire process of binding the receptor</p>
<p>and creating the psychoactive effects.</p>
<p>So initially it creates anxiety relief,</p>
<p>but over time the affinity for the receptor doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Meaning it can still park in that slot</p>
<p>with a lot of affinity, a lot of strength,</p>
<p>but there are fewer receptors available.</p>
<p>And then the signaling that&rsquo;s downstream of those receptors</p>
<p>becomes less and less robust.</p>
<p>Now, this is a topic we didn&rsquo;t get into</p>
<p>in too much detail today</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t want to include</p>
<p>even more biological detail,</p>
<p>but the CB1 receptor is a so-called</p>
<p>G-protein coupled receptor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mouthful, but a G-protein coupled receptor</p>
<p>basically is like a bucket brigade.</p>
<p>So while some receptors in the brain and body</p>
<p>are such that when something, a chemical binds to them,</p>
<p>that receptor has a direct action,</p>
<p>like it opens and allows stuff to rush into the cell,</p>
<p>increases the excitability of the cell,</p>
<p>so-called fast effects.</p>
<p>These G-protein coupled receptors,</p>
<p>and CB1 is a G-protein coupled receptor.</p>
<p>They are more like a bucket brigade</p>
<p>where they kick off a process through one molecule</p>
<p>that then is handed off to another molecule</p>
<p>that this then is handed off to another molecule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long chain or cascade of events.</p>
<p>Those long chains or cascades of events</p>
<p>have a lot of opportunity for regulation, for adjustment.</p>
<p>You know, receptor systems in the brain and body,</p>
<p>especially receptor systems like the cannabinoid system</p>
<p>that are used to being kind of tickled, not punched,</p>
<p>you know, tickled by endogenous cannabinoids</p>
<p>every once in a while, some binds, has an effect,</p>
<p>but certainly not bound with incredible potency</p>
<p>and over and over again as they are</p>
<p>when THC is coming into the system.</p>
<p>Well, those systems eventually over time,</p>
<p>they adjust themselves so that the body and those cells</p>
<p>can achieve so-called homeostasis.</p>
<p>So when people are using THC more than twice a week,</p>
<p>what ends up happening</p>
<p>is those G-protein coupled receptors</p>
<p>in the downstream signaling mechanisms</p>
<p>start to adjust themselves</p>
<p>and it requires more and more drug.</p>
<p>So either higher dosages or more frequent use.</p>
<p>And a lot of the positive effects,</p>
<p>the so-called decrease in anxiety,</p>
<p>increased focus, increased creativity,</p>
<p>some of that starts to wane, it starts to dissipate</p>
<p>and people wonder why they have to use so much cannabis</p>
<p>just to achieve a fraction of the effect</p>
<p>that they used to be able to achieve with even a lower dose.</p>
<p>So anxiety is getting worse over time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s anxiety during the drug use</p>
<p>and outside of the drug use.</p>
<p>Some people work around that or try to work around that</p>
<p>by using varying strains of cannabis</p>
<p>or changing the pattern of delivery from smoking to vaping</p>
<p>or from vaping to edible and from edible to transdermal.</p>
<p>Anyway, they go through a lot of gymnastics</p>
<p>and writhing and seeking,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, anxiety increases over time.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s very clear that depression increases over time</p>
<p>and especially, this is surprising to me,</p>
<p>but especially for individuals that were not depressed</p>
<p>at the outset of their use.</p>
<p>In other words, they didn&rsquo;t start using cannabis</p>
<p>because they were depressed,</p>
<p>but rather the depression starts to emerge</p>
<p>as a consequence of the cannabis and THC use.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s serious.</p>
<p>In fact, we now know</p>
<p>based on really solid epidemiological evidence</p>
<p>that depression is not a strong predictor</p>
<p>of seeking out cannabis.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t drive terribly many people</p>
<p>to seek out cannabis use,</p>
<p>but cannabis use itself makes people four times likelier</p>
<p>to develop a chronic major depression.</p>
<p>So anxiety is increasing, depression is increasing,</p>
<p>and this turns out to be especially relevant,</p>
<p>important to young people.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?</p>
<p>Well, if you look at the data,</p>
<p>and again, I think some of the strongest data</p>
<p>are data to come out of the Canadian system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done some really beautiful controlled studies.</p>
<p>I really hope to invite some of the people</p>
<p>who arranged and ran those studies</p>
<p>as guests onto the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>But if you look at the data out of Canada,</p>
<p>or you look at some of the data</p>
<p>out of Northern Europe and the US,</p>
<p>what you find is that the probability</p>
<p>that somebody will use cannabis</p>
<p>and then go on to use it chronically</p>
<p>correlates very strongly with age.</p>
<p>So for instance, some of the highest degree of cannabis use</p>
<p>is among individuals 16 to 24 years old.</p>
<p>In fact, in individuals who are 16 to 24 years old,</p>
<p>and in particular in students</p>
<p>and people who are working, surprising,</p>
<p>more than in unemployed populations,</p>
<p>being young, 16 to 24, at least to me that&rsquo;s young,</p>
<p>and being a student or working,</p>
<p>doubles the likelihood that somebody</p>
<p>is going to use cannabis on a regular basis,</p>
<p>twice or more per week.</p>
<p>The typical age of initiating cannabis use nowadays</p>
<p>is about 19 years old, so 18.7.</p>
<p>And about 20% of people in that age bracket</p>
<p>of 16 to 24 years old are using cannabis daily,</p>
<p>either by vaping, by smoking, or by edible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an enormous number, at least by my read,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an enormous number.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s of really serious concern.</p>
<p>During the ages of 16 to 24,</p>
<p>the cannabinoid receptors are still available.</p>
<p>They are not being as strongly driven</p>
<p>by endogenous cannabinoids,</p>
<p>but by ingestion of THC and or CBD,</p>
<p>there are downstream effects</p>
<p>on the signaling within those cells</p>
<p>that all the data point to creating a much,</p>
<p>much higher likelihood of developing major depression,</p>
<p>severe anxiety, or psychosis at later ages.</p>
<p>So to be very clear,</p>
<p>cannabis use between the ages of 16 to 24</p>
<p>in both males and females is increasing anxiety,</p>
<p>increasing depression in the immediate years,</p>
<p>and within the one year&rsquo;s time or so,</p>
<p>so much so that people are using cannabis ongoing</p>
<p>in an attempt to reduce that anxiety</p>
<p>and reduce that depression.</p>
<p>But in addition to that, the cannabis use,</p>
<p>and because of the signaling mechanisms involved,</p>
<p>are predisposing those individuals</p>
<p>to psychosis later in life.</p>
<p>If you look at individuals</p>
<p>who start using cannabis even younger,</p>
<p>age 14 or even as young as 12,</p>
<p>the probability of psychosis later in life,</p>
<p>in particular schizophrenic or schizophrenic-like episodes,</p>
<p>more than doubles.</p>
<p>So this is of really serious concern.</p>
<p>And this is completely aside</p>
<p>from any so-called positive effects</p>
<p>or beneficial effects of cannabis</p>
<p>that people might derive from occasional use as adults,</p>
<p>meaning people older than 25.</p>
<p>So for the person who&rsquo;s older than 25,</p>
<p>who eats an edible every once in a while,</p>
<p>or who smokes cannabis every once in a while,</p>
<p>and people love to make the argument,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as bad as alcohol,</p>
<p>which frankly is a terrible argument,</p>
<p>because if you saw our episode on alcohol,</p>
<p>alcohol is pretty bad.</p>
<p>But even so, it&rsquo;s just not a good argument.</p>
<p>Saying that something is good</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not as bad as something else</p>
<p>is simply just not a good or valid argument,</p>
<p>at least not biologically speaking.</p>
<p>The use of cannabis in young populations</p>
<p>is very strongly predisposing people to psychotic episodes.</p>
<p>And we know the mechanism by which this occurs.</p>
<p>This occurs by a thinning of the so-called gray matter.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s called gray matter</p>
<p>because with neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>they have a so-called cell body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part that contains the DNA</p>
<p>and manufactures all the neurotransmitters, et cetera.</p>
<p>And those are shipped out to the other parts of the neuron</p>
<p>that include the axon, the wires between axons.</p>
<p>And those axons under the microscope,</p>
<p>because they have a lot of fatty tissue around them,</p>
<p>and this is healthy fatty tissue</p>
<p>that allows electrical transmission to be fast,</p>
<p>that fatty tissue,</p>
<p>those portions of the cells are called white matter.</p>
<p>So you have gray matter and white matter.</p>
<p>Gray matter are the so-called cell bodies</p>
<p>where the DNA and all the stuff is manufactured.</p>
<p>White matter are the axons or the wires</p>
<p>through which all the key components are shipped out</p>
<p>to the synapse, et cetera.</p>
<p>Wonderful data.</p>
<p>And I do say wonderful</p>
<p>because this is part of a large-scale consortium</p>
<p>and we will provide a link to the paper.</p>
<p>This was published in Translational Psychiatry</p>
<p>just this year.</p>
<p>Point to the fact that adolescent cannabis use</p>
<p>accelerates the thinning of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and the gray matter in particular.</p>
<p>So what this means is while during normal development,</p>
<p>the gray matter, the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>and all the cells there are indeed intended,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a normal process for it to thicken</p>
<p>and then thin a little bit as connections are adjusted</p>
<p>and people learn and mature and grow up.</p>
<p>This is part of the normal healthy maturational process,</p>
<p>independent of cannabis use.</p>
<p>When kids, because these really are kids,</p>
<p>use cannabis and it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>the mode of cannabis delivery,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s vaping or smoking or edible,</p>
<p>that gray matter thins at a much, much greater rate.</p>
<p>And the reason I like this paper</p>
<p>published in Translational Psychiatry this year so much</p>
<p>is that they link the amount of cannabis use,</p>
<p>heavy, moderate, light, or no cannabis use</p>
<p>to the rate of prefrontal cortical thinning.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s absolutely clear from these data</p>
<p>that the more often young people,</p>
<p>meaning individuals between the age of 14 and 25,</p>
<p>the more often they consume or smoke or vape cannabis,</p>
<p>the faster and the more extreme that cortical thinning is.</p>
<p>And the cortical thinning is occurring</p>
<p>in exactly the area of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in planning,</p>
<p>in control over one&rsquo;s emotions, in reflexes,</p>
<p>in organizing one&rsquo;s life in a number of different ways,</p>
<p>anywhere from cleaning one&rsquo;s room, literally,</p>
<p>knowing what goes where,</p>
<p>to making plans that extend out through the day,</p>
<p>through the week, through a year,</p>
<p>essentially becoming a functional human being</p>
<p>involves using your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>in a variety of different contexts</p>
<p>and different sort of time domains,</p>
<p>the time domain of an hour, the time domain of a day,</p>
<p>making plans and being able to execute plans</p>
<p>is fundamental to being a healthy human being.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s absolutely clear from these data</p>
<p>that the more cannabis one uses,</p>
<p>the more impaired those neural circuits are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no other way to view these data.</p>
<p>In fact, so much so that even small amounts of cannabis use</p>
<p>are associated with rates of cortical thinning</p>
<p>and degrees of cortical thinning</p>
<p>that are really detrimental and concerning</p>
<p>for normal cognitive processes.</p>
<p>If you were somebody who smoked marijuana</p>
<p>or consumed cannabis in any form or another</p>
<p>during adolescence,</p>
<p>does that mean that your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>can never be rescued, that it can&rsquo;t come back?</p>
<p>Well, the short answer is</p>
<p>it probably can be rescued to some degree.</p>
<p>It will depend on how much cannabis you were using</p>
<p>and how often and what strains of cannabis, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no traveling back in time.</p>
<p>As my graduate advisor used to say,</p>
<p>time machines are broken.</p>
<p>At least for now, we don&rsquo;t have time machines.</p>
<p>So all you can really do is try and emphasize,</p>
<p>first of all, quitting cannabis in any form</p>
<p>and focusing on behaviors that emphasize endothelial cell,</p>
<p>blood flow, health to the brain.</p>
<p>So that would be cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>adequate nutrition, not smoking nicotine.</p>
<p>And there are a number of other things that one can do.</p>
<p>We will do an entire episode all about trying to reverse</p>
<p>the effects of cannabis and other drug use</p>
<p>during adolescence.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to do a deep dive on that right now,</p>
<p>but all the things that standardize</p>
<p>and kind of promote health, adequate sleep,</p>
<p>good social connection, regular cardiovascular</p>
<p>and weight training exercise, healthy nutrition,</p>
<p>what that represents to you,</p>
<p>healthy metabolic function and weight, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those are all going to facilitate some recovery</p>
<p>of brain function in particular prefrontal cortical function</p>
<p>by way of all the positive effects</p>
<p>that those behaviors and choices have.</p>
<p>But with that said, if you are in the age bracket</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been referring to,</p>
<p>this 14 to 25 year old age bracket,</p>
<p>and you are a occasional even or chronic cannabis user,</p>
<p>you should be very, very careful and concerned</p>
<p>about the long-term effects that could potentially have.</p>
<p>That statement is bolstered by another statistic,</p>
<p>which is that unlike a lot of other drugs,</p>
<p>the rate of cannabis use is strongly related</p>
<p>to how dangerous people perceive cannabis to be.</p>
<p>And that might seem obvious on the one hand,</p>
<p>if you think something is very, very dangerous,</p>
<p>you would expect that the probability</p>
<p>that somebody would use it would be very, very low.</p>
<p>And if they think something is safe,</p>
<p>the probability would be high.</p>
<p>But that isn&rsquo;t necessarily the case.</p>
<p>If you think about it, cannabis is a unique instance</p>
<p>in which nowadays we are hearing,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s becoming legal in a number of areas.</p>
<p>And we talked earlier about why that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>a good thing in most circumstances,</p>
<p>but that we aren&rsquo;t just hearing that cannabis is safe,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not just being implied that cannabis is safer,</p>
<p>but many more people are talking</p>
<p>about the positive effects of cannabis</p>
<p>without a lot of discussion</p>
<p>about the negative effects of cannabis.</p>
<p>And I realize that saying this is going to upset</p>
<p>some people out there,</p>
<p>because I know that there are a number of people</p>
<p>who fought very hard for the legalization process,</p>
<p>and I want to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge the many known positive effects</p>
<p>of cannabis in adults with very occasional use,</p>
<p>provided it is delivered safely</p>
<p>and in the safe context and setting and with legality.</p>
<p>That is entirely distinct from the issue</p>
<p>of whether or not cannabis is safe</p>
<p>for the developing brain and body.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not demonizing anybody for using cannabis,</p>
<p>but I want to make the point very simply and very directly.</p>
<p>It is far and away a different circumstance for the brain,</p>
<p>for an individual to be 25 years or older</p>
<p>and using cannabis in whatever form occasionally,</p>
<p>or maybe even frequently,</p>
<p>than it is for a young person aged 14 to 25</p>
<p>to be using cannabis, either by smoking or vaping,</p>
<p>or by edible or any other form on the brain and body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely clear that the brain continues to develop</p>
<p>at least until age 25,</p>
<p>and that a huge number of systems</p>
<p>related to mood regulation, so-called executive function,</p>
<p>the ability to organize one&rsquo;s thoughts,</p>
<p>plan, and execute plans,</p>
<p>essentially to become a functional human being,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one portion of becoming a functional human being,</p>
<p>but certainly an essential one.</p>
<p>All of that relies on the fine-tuning</p>
<p>of this neural circuitry</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about up until now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s abundantly clear</p>
<p>that cannabis and THC in particular</p>
<p>dramatically disrupt those processes.</p>
<p>So if this isn&rsquo;t clear enough just from my statements,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to point to a particular paper.</p>
<p>This is one of the more impactful papers</p>
<p>in this area in recent years.</p>
<p>This is a paper published in Lancet Psychiatry in 2022.</p>
<p>Title is, Association of Cannabis Potency</p>
<p>with Mental Ill Health and Addiction, a Systematic Review.</p>
<p>There are a number of very important points</p>
<p>in this very fine paper.</p>
<p>Lancet Psychiatry is one of the premier</p>
<p>medical journals out there.</p>
<p>And they evaluated a huge number of studies.</p>
<p>They actually looked at more than 4,000 studies.</p>
<p>They selected the ones that were only the most rigorous</p>
<p>in terms of study design and analysis</p>
<p>and rigor of conclusions.</p>
<p>And they looked at how early use of cannabis</p>
<p>impacted later probability of development of psychosis</p>
<p>and other psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>And the takeaways from this study are very clear.</p>
<p>First of all, chronic cannabis use,</p>
<p>so more than twice per week,</p>
<p>has consistently been associated</p>
<p>with mental health disorders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pulling some phrases directly from the paper.</p>
<p>Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis use</p>
<p>more frequent than twice per week,</p>
<p>has been associated with four times the risk of psychosis</p>
<p>later in life, in particular,</p>
<p>schizophrenia and bipolar-like episodes.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve done an episode on bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>so-called bipolar depression.</p>
<p>We have not yet done one on schizophrenia,</p>
<p>but both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia</p>
<p>have a very, very strong genetic component.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 30, three, zero, 30 times greater likelihood</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll have bipolar disorder</p>
<p>if you have a first relative who has bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s also the case that using cannabis,</p>
<p>especially during adolescence and the teen years</p>
<p>and up until age 25,</p>
<p>create a four times greater risk of psychosis</p>
<p>for those that have a predisposition</p>
<p>to bipolar disorder and or schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t hear very much about this in the media.</p>
<p>This paper got some attention</p>
<p>and then it sort of got swept away.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that was an intentional sweeping way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot of events in the world,</p>
<p>as you well know.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a particularly important set of findings</p>
<p>because obviously in looking at so many studies,</p>
<p>it distills out the strongest findings that are out there</p>
<p>and really pulls the consistent messages</p>
<p>that are arriving from all these different studies.</p>
<p>And as they point out, and again, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here,</p>
<p>this is the first systematic review</p>
<p>of the Association of Cannabis Potency.</p>
<p>And all of the data point to a very clear conclusion,</p>
<p>which is the more potent the THC concentration,</p>
<p>the higher probability of developing psychosis</p>
<p>or a major depressive episode</p>
<p>or a major anxiety disorder later in life.</p>
<p>That should be of particular concern</p>
<p>because we know, we are absolutely clear about the fact</p>
<p>that with the advent of all these new strains of cannabis</p>
<p>and with the engineering and availability of cannabis</p>
<p>at much higher potency, meaning THC potency,</p>
<p>the risk of psychosis is going up and up</p>
<p>and is likely to continue going up</p>
<p>unless something is done to reduce the frequency</p>
<p>of cannabis use to zero, ideally,</p>
<p>or to very low frequency, very low potency</p>
<p>in adolescents and teens and people age 25 or younger.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people don&rsquo;t want to hear this message</p>
<p>because first of all, it&rsquo;s alarming.</p>
<p>And second of all, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the statistics tell us that the greatest number of people</p>
<p>that are starting to use cannabis</p>
<p>are in the age bracket of 16 to 24.</p>
<p>Many of them are functional in other areas of life.</p>
<p>They are students, they are employed, et cetera.</p>
<p>But when you couple that with the fact</p>
<p>that the most frequent adopters of cannabis use</p>
<p>are in this age bracket of 16 to 24,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re twice as likely to use as other individuals</p>
<p>or to start using cannabis as our other individuals,</p>
<p>plus the general perception out there</p>
<p>because of the way that cannabis is discussed in the media</p>
<p>and by sports figures and by celebrities</p>
<p>and by politicians, et cetera,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not as bad as alcohol and maybe not that bad</p>
<p>and maybe even has health benefits,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re essentially setting up a system</p>
<p>where young people are far more likely to adopt</p>
<p>and continue cannabis use without realizing</p>
<p>these serious health consequences that await them later.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I of course, again,</p>
<p>want to acknowledge that there have been</p>
<p>well-demonstrated effects of cannabis for reducing pain,</p>
<p>in particular in chemotherapy and in the context</p>
<p>of reducing nausea in people suffering</p>
<p>from cancer or chemotherapy.</p>
<p>There is a well-known effect</p>
<p>that one can generally point to as positive</p>
<p>using cannabis for things like glaucoma,</p>
<p>for lowering intraocular pressure</p>
<p>and offsetting the loss of neurons</p>
<p>that would lead to blindness,</p>
<p>although there are other tools, of course,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t involve cannabis use</p>
<p>that can accomplish that as well.</p>
<p>So-called intraocular pressure lowering drugs or drops.</p>
<p>There is a list of probably a dozen or more psychological</p>
<p>and bodily ailments that can be aided by cannabis use,</p>
<p>in particular edible cannabis use of particular strains.</p>
<p>I, of course, I&rsquo;m going to address each</p>
<p>and every one of those in episodes where I&rsquo;m talking,</p>
<p>for instance, about eye disease or about chronic pain.</p>
<p>I am in no way, shape or form trying to rob</p>
<p>the incredible efforts of the laboratories</p>
<p>and people that have worked very hard to study</p>
<p>and establish the valid uses of cannabis</p>
<p>for treating various ailments</p>
<p>and that continue to study cannabis</p>
<p>in order to try and ameliorate the symptoms</p>
<p>of different ailments.</p>
<p>But today I really wanted to emphasize</p>
<p>the biology of cannabis.</p>
<p>Some of the often discussed effects,</p>
<p>I guess one could call them positive effects,</p>
<p>things like enhanced creativity,</p>
<p>and really point to the nuance</p>
<p>and actually the divergence of people who take cannabis</p>
<p>and some experience heightened levels of creativity</p>
<p>and some do not.</p>
<p>Some people experience heightened levels of sexual arousal</p>
<p>and some people experience the exact opposite</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Rather than focus on all the potential positive</p>
<p>and sort of emerging positive data about cannabis</p>
<p>in different medical contexts.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>I strongly feel that it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to acknowledge the shocking,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s really no other way to describe it,</p>
<p>the shocking effects of cannabis use</p>
<p>on the developing fetus and the fact that so many pregnant</p>
<p>and lactating mothers are using cannabis.</p>
<p>I mean, that number 15% still has me dizzy</p>
<p>with kind of disbelief,</p>
<p>and yet we need to acknowledge this</p>
<p>and address this immediately.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s vital to understand that cannabis use</p>
<p>through any delivery mechanism,</p>
<p>smoking or vaping or edible or otherwise,</p>
<p>is very, very concerning.</p>
<p>In fact, dangerous to the developing brain,</p>
<p>certainly for the fetal brain and for the baby brain,</p>
<p>but also for the adolescent brain</p>
<p>and for the teen and young adult brain,</p>
<p>not just because of the effects that it can have</p>
<p>in the immediate term,</p>
<p>those slow creeping increases in anxiety and depression</p>
<p>brought on by cannabis use,</p>
<p>but also the time release, if you will,</p>
<p>on the development of psychosis</p>
<p>and other types of major psychiatric disorders</p>
<p>later in life.</p>
<p>I acknowledge we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground today,</p>
<p>and yet there&rsquo;s still far more ground</p>
<p>that we could have covered</p>
<p>and that we will indeed cover in future episodes.</p>

<p>Not so much today,</p>
<p>but in many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>we talk about supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>

<p>and hormone optimization.</p>
