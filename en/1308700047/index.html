    <p>Our card this week is Kelly Poppleton, the Nine of Hearts from California.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to sharing Kelly&rsquo;s case with you all because it is so close,</p>
<p>and I mean like investigative inches away from finally being solved.</p>
<p>And after almost 40 years of her case going unsolved,</p>
<p>detectives are now ready to share new information</p>
<p>that has never been released to the public.</p>
<p>Information that, with your help, could get Kelly&rsquo;s family the answer to the question</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been asking for decades.</p>
<p>Who killed Kelly?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was about 5.30 p.m. on Friday, December 2nd, 1983,</p>
<p>and this evening was anything but normal for a man named Hans Kruger.</p>
<p>Unlike every other Friday night before, Hans wasn&rsquo;t just leisurely making his way home.</p>
<p>Something happened on his drive.</p>
<p>And when he tore into the driveway of his small California mountain town home,</p>
<p>he rushed to the phone to make this call.</p>
<p>My name is Hans Kruger.</p>
<p>I live at 1000 Kill Care Road in Snow.</p>
<p>And on my way home tonight, I found a body on the side of Kill Care Road at approximately 500.</p>
<p>500, what, the address?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was about halfway between Snow and my house here at 1000.</p>
<p>Are you certain it was a body?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How certain are you?</p>
<p>Female body with a bag over its head.</p>
<p>Pants were pulled out.</p>
<p>At about 500 Kill Care?</p>
<p>At about 500 Kill Care.</p>
<p>After hearing this call, which was edited down for clarity, by the way,</p>
<p>the operator wanted to dispatch an ambulance as well as law enforcement.</p>
<p>The thing is, Snow, California is a tiny town, like less than a thousand people,</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t have a police department or a hospital.</p>
<p>So in addition to sending units from the county sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and an ambulance from the nearby town of Fremont,</p>
<p>operators dispatched the local Sunol Fire Department.</p>
<p>Two firefighters were the first to arrive on the scene at 540,</p>
<p>just under nine minutes after that call came in.</p>
<p>When firefighters arrived, they saw exactly what Hans described.</p>
<p>On the side of the road was a woman&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Her blue jeans were pulled down around her knees,</p>
<p>and there was a brown garbage bag over her head.</p>
<p>She was only wearing one shoe, and according to firefighters,</p>
<p>she was twisted in a weird way, almost like she&rsquo;d been thrown out of a moving car.</p>
<p>Firefighters couldn&rsquo;t find a pulse and immediately wanted to start CPR,</p>
<p>which meant they needed to get the bag off her head.</p>
<p>It was secured with a black coaxial cable, like the kind that runs cable to your TV.</p>
<p>When they cut it off, they found another bag underneath it</p>
<p>that said, welcome to Korea and duty free on it.</p>
<p>And they also found a gray men&rsquo;s sweater.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not clear whether these two items were also over her head</p>
<p>or if they just happened to be inside the garbage bag.</p>
<p>But regardless, as soon as firefighters were able to get everything off,</p>
<p>they could see that the young woman&rsquo;s head was covered in blood.</p>
<p>They quickly cut off a red polka dot necktie that was tied tightly around her neck</p>
<p>and started CPR.</p>
<p>Evidence be damned.</p>
<p>At this point, they were trying to save her life.</p>
<p>After about five minutes, the ambulance from Fremont arrived.</p>
<p>They loaded her up and got her to the hospital by 10 after six</p>
<p>where doctors continued their lifesaving efforts.</p>
<p>While medical personnel were fighting to save her life,</p>
<p>deputies with the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>were arriving at the scene where she was found.</p>
<p>Since the woman had already been taken to the hospital,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t any chance of preserving the crime scene.</p>
<p>But detectives were able to catalog the evidence that had been cut off of her</p>
<p>and left at the scene.</p>
<p>The two bags, the sweater, the cable, and the necktie.</p>
<p>They also took measurements and photos that were obtained by our reporting team,</p>
<p>which you can see on our website, thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before detectives got the news.</p>
<p>The victim had been pronounced dead only about 10 minutes</p>
<p>after arriving at the hospital.</p>
<p>Patrol units went out to the hospital to see if they could identify the woman.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they couldn&rsquo;t find any form of ID on her,</p>
<p>so her name was still a mystery.</p>
<p>But as soon as the deputies saw the woman&rsquo;s injuries,</p>
<p>one thing was certain.</p>
<p>They were dealing with one of the most brutal homicides the area had ever seen.</p>
<p>The trauma to her head was severe.</p>
<p>She had a large open cut on her chin,</p>
<p>a skull fracture above her right eye,</p>
<p>and several other wounds on the back of her head that were still bleeding.</p>
<p>While they knew she&rsquo;d been pretty severely beaten,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t know the full extent of her injuries until the autopsy,</p>
<p>which was scheduled for the following morning.</p>
<p>That autopsy was performed by Alameda County pathologists,</p>
<p>and they determined that the victim&rsquo;s cause of death was asphyxiation</p>
<p>due to strangulation.</p>
<p>Not manual strangulation, but more like with a ligature,</p>
<p>such as the necktie or the TV cable.</p>
<p>And she had multiple blunt injuries.</p>
<p>They also concluded that she had been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>And while they still didn&rsquo;t know who the woman was,</p>
<p>they estimated that she was somewhere between 18 and 22 years old.</p>
<p>She had short, reddish-brown hair, blue eyes.</p>
<p>She was 5'5&quot;, 123 pounds,</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t have any scars or tattoos.</p>
<p>She was wearing a red and white striped blouse and a blue jacket with blue jeans,</p>
<p>which, like I mentioned earlier, were found around her knees.</p>
<p>Detectives&rsquo; first move was to start looking through the missing persons reports</p>
<p>to try and find one that matched her description.</p>
<p>While they were doing that, they sent out an extremely detailed bulletin</p>
<p>describing her appearance and clothing to other law enforcement agencies in the area.</p>
<p>And they sent out a slightly less detailed bulletin to the media.</p>
<p>That same day, the news started to break</p>
<p>that a body of a young woman had been found on Kilcair Road.</p>
<p>Sometime after 3 a.m., the sheriff&rsquo;s office got the call that they&rsquo;d been waiting for.</p>
<p>A woman named Teresa Rusk told the sheriff&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>that she had seen the news stories about a girl&rsquo;s body being found,</p>
<p>and she was worried that the girl was her teenage daughter, Kelly Poppleton,</p>
<p>who she had literally just filed a missing persons report for 24 hours earlier.</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s stepdad, Tracy, agreed to go down to the coroner&rsquo;s bureau to identify the body</p>
<p>because Teresa didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Probably because she didn&rsquo;t want to see her daughter like that if it did turn out to be her.</p>
<p>When Tracy saw the body, he confirmed their worst fears.</p>
<p>The woman who was found on Kilcair Road was Kelly.</p>
<p>And she wasn&rsquo;t 18 to 22 like the coroner thought.</p>
<p>She was only 14 years old and in the 8th grade.</p>
<p>So now that they knew who their victim was,</p>
<p>they needed to find out how this middle schooler</p>
<p>ended up beaten and strangled on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Teresa and Tracy told investigators that at 8.45 a.m. on December 2nd,</p>
<p>they dropped Kelly off at the middle school that she attended in Fremont,</p>
<p>which was basically a school for students who struggled with truancy.</p>
<p>See, there had been a lot of turmoil in Kelly&rsquo;s life in the past few years,</p>
<p>which led to some issues with school.</p>
<p>Teresa explained that after she and Kelly&rsquo;s dad divorced a few years ago</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d married Kelly&rsquo;s stepdad, Tracy,</p>
<p>Kelly had been moved around a lot, bopping between houses.</p>
<p>Teresa and Tracy finally settled into an apartment complex in Fremont that summer,</p>
<p>but unfortunately they&rsquo;d recently been evicted</p>
<p>and just a few days before Kelly went missing, they all moved into a hotel.</p>
<p>And all of this moving around had definitely taken its toll on Kelly.</p>
<p>So less than a month earlier, she&rsquo;d been transferred to the Opportunity School.</p>
<p>So on the afternoon of December 2nd, Kelly&rsquo;s mom was expecting</p>
<p>that when Kelly got out of school at 1 p.m.,</p>
<p>she was going to take the bus northwest to the ambulance service</p>
<p>where Teresa and Tracy both worked as dispatchers.</p>
<p>When Kelly didn&rsquo;t show up at their office a little after 1,</p>
<p>they were concerned, yes, but not panicked.</p>
<p>They just expected that when they got off work that evening,</p>
<p>they would go back to the hotel and there they&rsquo;d find Kelly.</p>
<p>But when they did get off and they did go back to the hotel, she wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>They still weren&rsquo;t super concerned though</p>
<p>because they assumed that she was just hanging out at their old apartment complex</p>
<p>and maybe just lost track of time.</p>
<p>Because even though they didn&rsquo;t live there anymore,</p>
<p>Kelly had a lot of friends over there</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for her to go hang out there in her free time.</p>
<p>But when Teresa and Tracy talked to her friends,</p>
<p>they say that they hadn&rsquo;t seen her at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when Teresa and Tracy really start to worry.</p>
<p>They searched the area for hours and couldn&rsquo;t find Kelly anywhere.</p>
<p>So that night at 11.30 p.m.,</p>
<p>they contacted the Fremont Police Department and filed a missing persons report.</p>
<p>By the time they saw the news the next day,</p>
<p>it had been more than 24 hours since they&rsquo;d heard from Kelly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when they feared the worst and contacted police.</p>
<p>After getting that call and once Kelly&rsquo;s identity was confirmed,</p>
<p>detectives picked up their investigation</p>
<p>in the last place that her mom and stepdad saw her, at school.</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s teacher told them that she had been at school all day</p>
<p>and even stayed a little late to finish an assignment.</p>
<p>And then some of her classmates told police</p>
<p>that Kelly took a bus to her old apartment complex.</p>
<p>There was also a convenience store called 00 Liquors</p>
<p>and a shopping center in this area.</p>
<p>So it was basically like the ideal pre-internet teen hangout spot.</p>
<p>Some kids who knew her from her old school told police</p>
<p>that she went inside the convenience store to get a book of matches.</p>
<p>Then she called her boyfriend from one of the payphones on the side of the building.</p>
<p>Police thought that the payphones might have been the last known sighting of Kelly.</p>
<p>But then that same day,</p>
<p>two boys from Kelly&rsquo;s previous middle school came forward</p>
<p>and told police that they spotted Kelly at around 2.30,</p>
<p>walking behind them when they were strolling down Darwin Drive,</p>
<p>just north of 00 Liquors.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just Kelly that they saw.</p>
<p>These kids also reported seeing two men</p>
<p>standing next to a cream-colored Plymouth Duster</p>
<p>that was parked on the opposite side of the same street.</p>
<p>When the boys looked back moments later, Kelly was gone.</p>
<p>And the men were sprinting toward an apartment complex</p>
<p>in the opposite direction of Kelly&rsquo;s old one.</p>
<p>So this is promising, yeah, but one problem.</p>
<p>Since the two boys who reported seeing the guys</p>
<p>had only seen the guys from across the street,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t give a super detailed description of them,</p>
<p>certainly not enough that police could go looking for these two men.</p>
<p>So police asked around for other eyewitnesses,</p>
<p>specifically anyone who was near Killcare Road</p>
<p>or downtown Sunol around the time Kelly&rsquo;s body was discovered.</p>
<p>One witness described seeing a light-colored 70s Dodge Colt</p>
<p>or Datsun B210 driving recklessly off Killcare Road,</p>
<p>maybe at around 5.30.</p>
<p>That was right before Kelly&rsquo;s body was discovered.</p>
<p>And another witness said that they saw a black</p>
<p>or maybe dark blue Pontiac Trans Am</p>
<p>parked somewhere on Killcare Road around the same time.</p>
<p>But neither of these witnesses could describe the drivers.</p>
<p>So police started with the only lead</p>
<p>that they could actually get traction on, Kelly&rsquo;s boyfriend.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a specific reason why they suspected him,</p>
<p>but from what they&rsquo;d been told,</p>
<p>he was one of the last people to hear from her,</p>
<p>so they definitely wanted to talk to him.</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s mom actually knew her boyfriend</p>
<p>and approved of the relationship,</p>
<p>so he wasn&rsquo;t hard to track down.</p>
<p>He was an 18-year-old man named Mitchell Reese.</p>
<p>Mitchell Reese agreed to an interview,</p>
<p>and to detectives&rsquo; surprise,</p>
<p>he claimed that he hadn&rsquo;t gotten a call from Kelly that day,</p>
<p>which directly contradicted</p>
<p>what Kelly&rsquo;s old classmate told police.</p>
<p>Mitchell agreed to take a polygraph, and he passed.</p>
<p>But detectives weren&rsquo;t fully satisfied,</p>
<p>so they got the phone records from the payphones</p>
<p>outside of the convenience store</p>
<p>and determined that no calls were made to his number.</p>
<p>He was telling the truth.</p>
<p>So detectives moved on.</p>
<p>For a few days,</p>
<p>detectives thought the leads in this case</p>
<p>might have been drying up.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know where else to turn.</p>
<p>But then, on the evening of December 9th,</p>
<p>a week after Kelly&rsquo;s body had been found,</p>
<p>police got a call from a woman</p>
<p>that led them to a shocking confession.</p>
<p>The call was from a woman named Pam,</p>
<p>who said that her 13-year-old daughter, Trina Bence,</p>
<p>had information about who killed Kelly.</p>
<p>Investigators dropped everything</p>
<p>and headed to their home</p>
<p>in the wee hours of the morning on December 10th.</p>
<p>And what Trina had to say</p>
<p>absolutely floored detectives.</p>
<p>And buckle up,</p>
<p>because this story is quite a bit to unpack.</p>
<p>Trina told police that she, Kelly,</p>
<p>and another 13-year-old girl,</p>
<p>who we&rsquo;re gonna call Beth,</p>
<p>all sold drugs for a man who she knew only as Mario.</p>
<p>She told investigators</p>
<p>that Mario lived in her apartment complex,</p>
<p>which was right by where Kelly used to live.</p>
<p>According to Trina,</p>
<p>Mario and a 17-year-old boy</p>
<p>who also sold drugs with them</p>
<p>and who we&rsquo;re gonna call Chris,</p>
<p>had recently gotten into some legal trouble.</p>
<p>And they thought that Kelly had snitched on them.</p>
<p>Trina told detectives that Mario and Chris</p>
<p>asked her to bring Kelly to a location</p>
<p>where they could get her into their car</p>
<p>so they could, quote-unquote,</p>
<p>pay her back.</p>
<p>According to Trina,</p>
<p>Kelly came over to her school,</p>
<p>which was about a 15-minute drive away</p>
<p>early in the morning on December 2nd,</p>
<p>just before school started.</p>
<p>Now, right off the bat,</p>
<p>Trina&rsquo;s story doesn&rsquo;t really make sense to detectives</p>
<p>because Trina&rsquo;s school started before Kelly&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And remember, Kelly&rsquo;s mom and stepdad</p>
<p>had said that they dropped Kelly off</p>
<p>at her own school at 8.45 that morning.</p>
<p>And her teacher said that she&rsquo;d been in school all day.</p>
<p>But detectives have no reason at this point</p>
<p>to think that Trina would lie,</p>
<p>so they just keep listening to what else she has to say.</p>
<p>And she continued.</p>
<p>She told police that when they were together that morning,</p>
<p>she asked Kelly to meet up at Double O Liquors after school</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where Mario and Chris</p>
<p>had told Trina to take her.</p>
<p>Trina said Kelly came to her school again</p>
<p>at around 2.15,</p>
<p>and they took the bus to Double O.</p>
<p>For some reason,</p>
<p>she said that she and Kelly got on the bus</p>
<p>at different stops,</p>
<p>but when they got to Double O,</p>
<p>Mario, Chris, and Beth,</p>
<p>that other 13-year-old girl,</p>
<p>were all sitting and waiting for them</p>
<p>in Mario&rsquo;s cream-colored 1973 Pontiac Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Trina said that she and Kelly got into Mario&rsquo;s car,</p>
<p>and the group headed towards Sinol.</p>
<p>On their way there,</p>
<p>Trina said that Mario and Chris started beating Kelly.</p>
<p>Now, detectives were a little confused</p>
<p>about the logistics of this,</p>
<p>so they asked who was driving,</p>
<p>and Trina said Mario was.</p>
<p>She claimed that he was beating Kelly while driving.</p>
<p>She said they stopped along the road at some point,</p>
<p>and he continued assaulting Kelly outside the car.</p>
<p>She said one was wearing some kind of weighted gloves,</p>
<p>and they were beating Kelly with clubs.</p>
<p>Trina said that Beth participated in the attack as well</p>
<p>by holding Kelly down</p>
<p>while the two guys assaulted her.</p>
<p>She even mentioned the bag over Kelly&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>and some kind of cord or wire being tied around her neck.</p>
<p>After the attack,</p>
<p>Trina said that they put Kelly back in the car</p>
<p>and continued driving towards Sinol,</p>
<p>where they dumped her</p>
<p>and then left her to take her last breaths alone</p>
<p>in the cold on Killcare Road.</p>
<p>Detectives were understandably flabbergasted</p>
<p>hearing this story.</p>
<p>I mean, Trina was implicating four people,</p>
<p>including herself, in Kelly&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>On top of all of that,</p>
<p>investigators were shocked</p>
<p>that this story of such brutal violence</p>
<p>was coming out of the mouth of a 13-year-old girl,</p>
<p>a middle schooler.</p>
<p>But as shocking as it was,</p>
<p>in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>Trina&rsquo;s story actually made sense.</p>
<p>Like, parts of her story were matching up,</p>
<p>like the locations,</p>
<p>Double O Liquors and Killcare Road,</p>
<p>even Kelly&rsquo;s injuries and the bag over her head,</p>
<p>and possibly most compelling,</p>
<p>Mario&rsquo;s cream-colored 73 Grand Prix,</p>
<p>which could have easily been mixed up</p>
<p>with the Plymouth Duster</p>
<p>that those two boys saw parked on Darwin Drive.</p>
<p>So, with information about this car</p>
<p>and the apartment complex he lived in,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t take detectives long</p>
<p>to identify the person that she was calling Mario.</p>
<p>He was 27-year-old Julian Ramirez.</p>
<p>And listen, law enforcement wasted no time.</p>
<p>They arrested Trina and Julian that evening</p>
<p>and Chris and Beth early the next morning.</p>
<p>That day, all three of them,</p>
<p>Julian, Chris, and Beth,</p>
<p>were interviewed separately.</p>
<p>They all gave statements</p>
<p>denying any involvement in Kelly&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>and each provided alibis.</p>
<p>So, the next few days were go time for detectives.</p>
<p>They got busy trying to vet these suspects&rsquo; alibis.</p>
<p>They searched Julian&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>and found some suspicious stains</p>
<p>that they thought could be blood,</p>
<p>so they sent samples out for blood typing</p>
<p>to see if it was the same type as Kelly&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They also found that the trunk was wet,</p>
<p>like it had recently been cleaned,</p>
<p>which was obviously very suspicious.</p>
<p>All in all, things weren&rsquo;t looking good for this group.</p>
<p>But as investigators followed up on their alibis,</p>
<p>they found that their stories</p>
<p>were actually checking out.</p>
<p>On top of that,</p>
<p>they started to see more and more holes</p>
<p>in Trina&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Detectives interviewed her multiple times</p>
<p>over the following days</p>
<p>and as they did,</p>
<p>small details in her story started to change.</p>
<p>For one, she told them that</p>
<p>instead of riding the bus to meet Mario and Julian,</p>
<p>she and Kelly had actually gotten picked up by him</p>
<p>and they had all gone to Double O Liquors together.</p>
<p>She also changed her story</p>
<p>to implicate her boyfriend at the time,</p>
<p>which definitely had detectives scratching their heads.</p>
<p>So not only was the story changing,</p>
<p>but as detectives were trying to corroborate</p>
<p>what she was saying,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they really saw</p>
<p>that things weren&rsquo;t adding up in a big way.</p>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<p>they were looking at the timeline after school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>because Trina&rsquo;s school day ended at 2.15</p>
<p>and her school was like 15,</p>
<p>maybe 20 minutes away</p>
<p>from where Kelly had last been seen at 2.30.</p>
<p>So for Trina&rsquo;s story to make sense,</p>
<p>she would have had to make the 15 minute trip,</p>
<p>which would have inevitably been longer by bus.</p>
<p>She meets up with Kelly</p>
<p>and they have to be on their way in Julian&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>in just 15 minutes.</p>
<p>So it could still technically be possible</p>
<p>if witnesses had gotten the time maybe slightly wrong</p>
<p>or if the bus had been running ahead of schedule</p>
<p>or something,</p>
<p>but it was definitely a stretch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at this point</p>
<p>that police went and talked to Trina&rsquo;s brother</p>
<p>who often looked after her</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when Trina&rsquo;s story really unraveled.</p>
<p>He said that on December 2nd,</p>
<p>he and Trina had gone home together after school</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d gotten off the bus at 3.05,</p>
<p>35 minutes after Kelly had last been seen.</p>
<p>At this point,</p>
<p>detectives were really struggling</p>
<p>to make Trina&rsquo;s story work.</p>
<p>So they went to go question her again</p>
<p>and ask her,</p>
<p>what was she not telling them?</p>
<p>For this episode,</p>
<p>our reporting team traveled all the way to California</p>
<p>to talk directly to Detective Patrick Smith</p>
<p>with the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s working on Kelly&rsquo;s case today</p>
<p>and he told us what Trina told detectives this time.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get down to the truth.</p>
<p>What is really the truth, Trina?</p>
<p>Because now you&rsquo;re seeing some other guys involved</p>
<p>and she says, you know, none of it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>The investigators were, I think, really kind of stunned.</p>
<p>Like, how would you have known</p>
<p>some of these things that you&rsquo;ve told us, Trina?</p>
<p>And she basically said, I read the news reports.</p>
<p>I read the news articles.</p>
<p>I watched news reports.</p>
<p>I basically just used that</p>
<p>and the questions you asked me</p>
<p>and the things that you said,</p>
<p>I just, I made the whole thing up.</p>
<p>Police were not just shocked.</p>
<p>They were a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>Here, they had four people behind bars</p>
<p>based on this teenager&rsquo;s story,</p>
<p>which now she said was all a tall tale.</p>
<p>Detectives were also able to test the stains</p>
<p>in Julian&rsquo;s car against Kelly&rsquo;s blood</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t match,</p>
<p>which just confirmed what they already knew.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d wasted precious days</p>
<p>on a completely fabricated story.</p>
<p>They released Chris and Beth without charging them,</p>
<p>but they kept Julian in jail</p>
<p>because of a parole violation,</p>
<p>though they dropped the charges</p>
<p>for Kelly&rsquo;s murder against him.</p>
<p>As detectives pressed Trina</p>
<p>on why she made up the story,</p>
<p>she said that her mom had pressured her</p>
<p>to come forward</p>
<p>and because of some unrelated trouble</p>
<p>that Trina had recently been in,</p>
<p>she absolutely refused to believe</p>
<p>that her daughter wasn&rsquo;t involved somehow.</p>
<p>Trina described a really rough home life,</p>
<p>one that law enforcement</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable sending her back to.</p>
<p>So even though the other two teens were released,</p>
<p>Trina was actually held in protective custody</p>
<p>for almost two more months</p>
<p>until a judge ordered that she be placed</p>
<p>into someone else&rsquo;s care on February 17th of 1984.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any follow-up</p>
<p>on what happened to her after that,</p>
<p>but I can only hope that she got the help</p>
<p>and support she needed.</p>
<p>But after her story unraveled,</p>
<p>they were now 11 days out</p>
<p>since Kelly had been murdered,</p>
<p>but they were no closer to finding out</p>
<p>who her killer was.</p>
<p>So detectives turned toward the physical evidence.</p>
<p>Specifically, the items found on Kelly&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Her clothes, a dark-colored garbage bag,</p>
<p>that white bag that said</p>
<p>Duty Free and Welcome to Korea on it,</p>
<p>the TV cable, the men&rsquo;s sweater,</p>
<p>and the red necktie.</p>
<p>And the first thing they honed in on</p>
<p>was something strange</p>
<p>that the crime lab technicians found</p>
<p>in Kelly&rsquo;s jeans.</p>
<p>It was in that, like, watch pocket,</p>
<p>you know, that little pocket inside</p>
<p>the regular pocket that no one really uses.</p>
<p>Well, in there,</p>
<p>they found a folded-up piece of paper</p>
<p>with seven numbers written on it.</p>
<p>Their first thought was that</p>
<p>it could be a phone number,</p>
<p>just maybe missing the area code.</p>
<p>So right away, they tried calling it.</p>
<p>They reached a woman in Livermore,</p>
<p>but when they got to asking her questions,</p>
<p>their hopes began to fizzle.</p>
<p>She said that she didn&rsquo;t know a Kelly Poppleton</p>
<p>and that she lived alone,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like there was anyone else around</p>
<p>using her phone.</p>
<p>But investigators weren&rsquo;t just gonna drop it.</p>
<p>They looked into the woman,</p>
<p>they looked into the woman&rsquo;s boyfriend,</p>
<p>they looked into her boyfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>friends and associates,</p>
<p>but they couldn&rsquo;t find a link anywhere to Kelly.</p>
<p>So that lead turned into just another dead end.</p>
<p>But they did have more info</p>
<p>on the other items found with Kelly.</p>
<p>Like, they learned that that duty-free bag</p>
<p>originated from one of four airports</p>
<p>in South Korea.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have any Korean suspects</p>
<p>on their radar,</p>
<p>so they thought that maybe the person</p>
<p>they were looking for was in the military</p>
<p>and maybe had a connection to South Korea.</p>
<p>Now, they also didn&rsquo;t have any military suspects</p>
<p>on their radar either,</p>
<p>but they kept this in the back of their minds</p>
<p>for any future suspects.</p>
<p>As for the garbage bag,</p>
<p>it was sent to the FBI for fingerprinting.</p>
<p>There were some prints from one of the firefighters</p>
<p>and a detective,</p>
<p>which they were able to eliminate off the bat</p>
<p>since they handled the evidence,</p>
<p>but there were six other distinct prints</p>
<p>that did not belong to them.</p>
<p>Those were entered into California&rsquo;s</p>
<p>automated latent print system.</p>
<p>This database was relatively new at the time,</p>
<p>and it relied on police agencies in California</p>
<p>submitting inked print cards from felony cases,</p>
<p>which not all agencies did.</p>
<p>So they also searched the prints</p>
<p>through a local automated system.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t get any matches</p>
<p>from either of the databases though,</p>
<p>but at least now law enforcement had something</p>
<p>to test against any future suspects.</p>
<p>As for the sweater and the necktie,</p>
<p>the tag on the inside of the sweater</p>
<p>said that it was made in Korea,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t necessarily tell them</p>
<p>where their suspect had bought it.</p>
<p>Though it is weird, right,</p>
<p>that this is their second link to Korea or South Korea.</p>
<p>So since they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where either of these pieces of clothing</p>
<p>could have been purchased from,</p>
<p>they started asking around,</p>
<p>showing people photos of all of the items</p>
<p>to see if anyone recognized them,</p>
<p>but got no luck.</p>
<p>But then in March of 1984,</p>
<p>this is about three months after Kelly&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>the door-knocking efforts that they had been doing</p>
<p>actually paid off</p>
<p>when they got a tip that looked really promising.</p>
<p>They were canvassing Kelly&rsquo;s old apartment complex again</p>
<p>when someone brought up a name</p>
<p>that they hadn&rsquo;t heard before,</p>
<p>a 22-year-old man by the name of Juan Perez.</p>
<p>A witness said that Juan was known to deal weed</p>
<p>and that he was always hanging around with teen girls</p>
<p>even though he was married.</p>
<p>The witness even told police</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d seen Kelly at his apartment before.</p>
<p>And on top of that, Juan drove a black Trans Am,</p>
<p>which if you&rsquo;ll remember from way back</p>
<p>when they first started investigating,</p>
<p>a witness said that they saw that kind of car</p>
<p>parked alongside Kill Care Road</p>
<p>at around the time Kelly was found.</p>
<p>Investigators brought Juan in for questioning</p>
<p>and he told them that yes, he did know Kelly,</p>
<p>they lived in the same apartment complex after all,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t know anything about her murder.</p>
<p>He even submitted to a polygraph,</p>
<p>which came back inconclusive.</p>
<p>Weirdly, Juan actually worked for the company</p>
<p>owned by Hands, the man who found Kelly&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Detectives weren&rsquo;t sure whether that meant anything or not,</p>
<p>but they definitely thought it was an odd coincidence.</p>
<p>With all of the connections and inconclusive polygraph,</p>
<p>detectives really thought that this was their guy.</p>
<p>Without any real evidence,</p>
<p>investigators had to let Juan go.</p>
<p>And at this point,</p>
<p>the case was growing cold.</p>
<p>Weeks were passing without any other leads.</p>
<p>Winter turned to spring</p>
<p>and detectives were still no closer</p>
<p>to getting answers for Kelly&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>So detectives went back to the drawing board again,</p>
<p>looking at the evidence</p>
<p>and trying to connect any dots that they could.</p>
<p>They may have had a couple of theories at that time,</p>
<p>but what they really had was more questions than answers.</p>
<p>They suspected that it could be more than one person</p>
<p>who killed Kelly,</p>
<p>because A, it looked like Kelly had been thrown</p>
<p>out of a moving car,</p>
<p>so one person would have needed to drive</p>
<p>while the other person disposed of her body.</p>
<p>And B, there wasn&rsquo;t any evidence</p>
<p>that Kelly had been tied up</p>
<p>and they suspected that more than one person</p>
<p>would have been needed to restrain her.</p>
<p>They also theorized that whoever they were looking for</p>
<p>could have been local.</p>
<p>I mean, for one thing,</p>
<p>Kill Care Road was extremely remote</p>
<p>and there would have been no reason</p>
<p>for anyone who didn&rsquo;t live there to know it.</p>
<p>And since this was pre-GPS,</p>
<p>it would have been really hard to find as well.</p>
<p>But again, who these local killers could be</p>
<p>was still a total mystery to them.</p>
<p>So in May, detectives reached out</p>
<p>to the Behavior Analysis Unit at the FBI.</p>
<p>You know, the ones that shows like criminal minds</p>
<p>and Mindhunter are based off of.</p>
<p>And they asked them to come up</p>
<p>with a psychological profile for their killer.</p>
<p>The BAU told them kind of what detectives had suspected.</p>
<p>They were likely looking for more than one offender.</p>
<p>The offenders would be in their late teens or early twenties,</p>
<p>unmarried and regular users of drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>So, I mean, this was helpful in giving them</p>
<p>a pretty good idea</p>
<p>of who they were hypothetically looking for.</p>
<p>But police didn&rsquo;t have anyone to test this profile</p>
<p>for a criminal mindhunter.</p>
<p>The BAU also didn&rsquo;t have any evidence</p>
<p>But police didn&rsquo;t have anyone to test this profile against.</p>
<p>And from what it sounds like,</p>
<p>the FBI profile was actually pretty general.</p>
<p>But over the next year,</p>
<p>detectives still kept up the work.</p>
<p>They re-interviewed people.</p>
<p>They followed any new tips that came in.</p>
<p>But not a single one was panning out.</p>
<p>And by this point,</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s case wasn&rsquo;t the only unsolved murder in the area.</p>
<p>The East Bay area actually had three other cases</p>
<p>of girls who had been murdered</p>
<p>under similar circumstances to Kelly.</p>
<p>The Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>had actually formed a task force back in May of 1984</p>
<p>to investigate a connection between Kelly&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>and two others.</p>
<p>And then, when a fourth girl was killed</p>
<p>in November of that year,</p>
<p>they added her case to the list</p>
<p>because they thought that they could be dealing</p>
<p>with a serial killer.</p>
<p>The three other girls who were killed</p>
<p>were 14-year-old Tina Fails,</p>
<p>who was in middle school,</p>
<p>and two high schoolers,</p>
<p>who were both 18.</p>
<p>Tina had been stabbed to death</p>
<p>and the other two girls had been sexually assaulted</p>
<p>and strangled like Kelly.</p>
<p>All four bodies had been left in secluded areas</p>
<p>within a 15-mile radius of where Kelly had been found.</p>
<p>And they had clear similarities in victimology.</p>
<p>But besides the circumstances,</p>
<p>investigators didn&rsquo;t have any physical evidence</p>
<p>to connect any of these cases together.</p>
<p>But at this point,</p>
<p>no lead was too far-fetched for detectives.</p>
<p>They even looked into the infamous serial killer pair</p>
<p>Charles Ng and Leonard Lake,</p>
<p>comparing Lake&rsquo;s fingerprints</p>
<p>to the ones found on the garbage bag,</p>
<p>but nothing matched with that either.</p>
<p>As the years passed,</p>
<p>frustration mounted for investigators</p>
<p>and specifically for Kelly&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>We actually had the chance</p>
<p>to talk to Kelly&rsquo;s sister, Amanda,</p>
<p>for this episode.</p>
<p>And she talked about what her family was thinking</p>
<p>as these leads in Kelly&rsquo;s case dried up.</p>
<p>At the beginning,</p>
<p>my mom was very confident</p>
<p>that there was a suspect they had.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t tell me who.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was the Ramirez guy</p>
<p>she was referring to or not.</p>
<p>But she said that there was&hellip;</p>
<p>Something happened.</p>
<p>And some&hellip;</p>
<p>Something happened,</p>
<p>and the investigation went off the rails</p>
<p>with the whole Trina thing.</p>
<p>And she said because of that,</p>
<p>it just totally messed everything up,</p>
<p>and she lost all faith in the investigation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve screwed up too much, basically,</p>
<p>is what the family thinks.</p>
<p>But the one thing that wasn&rsquo;t messed up</p>
<p>and actually became more valuable</p>
<p>with the passage of time</p>
<p>was the physical evidence</p>
<p>that contained DNA.</p>
<p>The Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>still had everything</p>
<p>that Kelly had been found with</p>
<p>in their evidence room.</p>
<p>Both bags, the TV cable,</p>
<p>the necktie, and the sweater.</p>
<p>So in 2004,</p>
<p>after sitting in an evidence room</p>
<p>for more than two decades,</p>
<p>all of the evidence was sent</p>
<p>to the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Crime Lab</p>
<p>where they were able to develop</p>
<p>a full male DNA profile.</p>
<p>Right away,</p>
<p>they uploaded the profile to CODIS,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t get any hits.</p>
<p>Now, this was a blow to the investigation,</p>
<p>but not a surprise.</p>
<p>By that point,</p>
<p>investigators knew</p>
<p>that their suspect</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t just gonna fall into their laps.</p>
<p>So from 2005 to 2014,</p>
<p>two Alameda County cold case detectives</p>
<p>traveled around the country</p>
<p>trying to find a match to the DNA,</p>
<p>even traveling as far as Canada.</p>
<p>They conducted</p>
<p>what Detective Smith called</p>
<p>a DNA dragnet,</p>
<p>testing any past persons of interest</p>
<p>to rule them out once and for all</p>
<p>and anyone else</p>
<p>who had come up in theories</p>
<p>or speculation throughout the decades.</p>
<p>Even after years of looking,</p>
<p>they still couldn&rsquo;t find a match.</p>
<p>But now that they had a DNA profile,</p>
<p>they knew for a fact</p>
<p>that this case was solvable,</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t gonna give up now,</p>
<p>not when they were so, so close.</p>
<p>By 2011,</p>
<p>all three cases</p>
<p>that could have been connected to Kelly&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>Lisa&rsquo;s, Tina&rsquo;s, and Julie&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>all had been solved using DNA evidence.</p>
<p>But none of the defendants in those cases</p>
<p>matched the DNA for Kelly&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p>none of those cases</p>
<p>even turned out to be connected.</p>
<p>So in 2016,</p>
<p>detectives decided to take a chance</p>
<p>on a new way</p>
<p>of identifying suspects</p>
<p>through a company</p>
<p>called Parabon NanoLabs.</p>
<p>When you conduct DNA work,</p>
<p>say, in our crime lab,</p>
<p>was to do some swab cutting,</p>
<p>whatever it is,</p>
<p>and they end up doing the DNA processing</p>
<p>and they end up getting something,</p>
<p>they have the extracts</p>
<p>that produce this result.</p>
<p>A lot of times,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have leftover,</p>
<p>the extracts of that exam.</p>
<p>And basically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a liquid form</p>
<p>of whatever&rsquo;s left over from that exam.</p>
<p>So when we had our evidence</p>
<p>that produced our unknown profile,</p>
<p>we had those extracts sent to Parabon.</p>
<p>Parabon then did something</p>
<p>called phenotyping,</p>
<p>where they came up with a profile</p>
<p>of what the suspect</p>
<p>might have looked like</p>
<p>based on their DNA</p>
<p>and then created</p>
<p>a computer-generated composite sketch.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when investigators</p>
<p>got back something</p>
<p>that they had never considered.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve never said publicly</p>
<p>until now.</p>
<p>Parabon comes back</p>
<p>with a report saying</p>
<p>that our unknown DNA</p>
<p>is a Korean male.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a huge break in the case</p>
<p>to be able to narrow it down that way</p>
<p>for the first time.</p>
<p>Not knowing the suspect&rsquo;s age</p>
<p>at the time of Kelly&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>the composite shows versions</p>
<p>of the man at 25,</p>
<p>as well as in his mid-50s.</p>
<p>You can see both of those composites</p>
<p>right now on our website.</p>
<p>As far as we know,</p>
<p>police never once</p>
<p>had any Korean suspects</p>
<p>or even witnesses</p>
<p>on their radar.</p>
<p>So for them,</p>
<p>this result was</p>
<p>totally unexpected.</p>
<p>But honestly,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>all that shocking,</p>
<p>given that they knew</p>
<p>the duty-free bag</p>
<p>was from a Korean airport</p>
<p>and the sweater</p>
<p>was made in Korea.</p>
<p>But hindsight is 20-20.</p>
<p>After almost 33 years,</p>
<p>investigators finally had</p>
<p>something solid</p>
<p>that they could work with.</p>
<p>Without having any</p>
<p>computerized records,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been hard for them</p>
<p>to go back in time</p>
<p>to see who was in the area</p>
<p>that matched this profile.</p>
<p>So instead,</p>
<p>they put together</p>
<p>a list of known offenders</p>
<p>of Korean descent</p>
<p>in the Alameda County area</p>
<p>from around the time</p>
<p>of Kelly&rsquo;s murder,</p>
<p>doing their best</p>
<p>to identify individuals</p>
<p>who were living</p>
<p>in the closest proximity</p>
<p>to Kelly.</p>
<p>And while doing this,</p>
<p>they found a promising suspect</p>
<p>who had even lived</p>
<p>in the same apartment complex</p>
<p>as her.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Detective Smith</p>
<p>got this other idea.</p>
<p>Now that he knew</p>
<p>the genetic profile</p>
<p>of Kelly&rsquo;s killer,</p>
<p>he remembered a case</p>
<p>that had happened</p>
<p>around the same area</p>
<p>and the same timeframe</p>
<p>as Kelly&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that had gotten</p>
<p>a ton of press</p>
<p>back in the day.</p>
<p>It was the unsolved case</p>
<p>of Frances Rash.</p>
<p>Frances had been killed</p>
<p>in 1979</p>
<p>in Dublin, California,</p>
<p>which is about 25 minutes</p>
<p>from where Kelly lived.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d come home</p>
<p>to find her children</p>
<p>tied up.</p>
<p>And while she tried</p>
<p>to fight the killer off,</p>
<p>her children escaped</p>
<p>and called the police.</p>
<p>Now her children</p>
<p>had seen the suspect,</p>
<p>so they knew for a fact</p>
<p>that they were looking</p>
<p>for an Asian man</p>
<p>in his late 20s,</p>
<p>the same description</p>
<p>of the person</p>
<p>who had killed Kelly.</p>
<p>So there was a chance</p>
<p>that the same person</p>
<p>who killed Frances Rash</p>
<p>also killed Kelly Poppleton.</p>
<p>But even if that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the case,</p>
<p>Detective Smith knew</p>
<p>that the suspect list</p>
<p>in the Rash case file</p>
<p>would still be full of people</p>
<p>who matched the description</p>
<p>of Kelly&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>He found something</p>
<p>in that case file</p>
<p>that looked really promising.</p>
<p>There was an arrest law</p>
<p>from October 1984</p>
<p>that recorded the arrest</p>
<p>of two Korean men</p>
<p>for kidnapping a woman</p>
<p>in Castro Valley,</p>
<p>just 10 minutes</p>
<p>from where Kelly</p>
<p>was last seen.</p>
<p>One of them</p>
<p>was in his early 20s,</p>
<p>the other in his early 30s.</p>
<p>And one of them lived</p>
<p>just one and a half miles</p>
<p>from where Kelly</p>
<p>was last seen.</p>
<p>From the two kidnappers,</p>
<p>detectives were able</p>
<p>to identify another</p>
<p>potential suspect</p>
<p>who was a close associate</p>
<p>of one of the men.</p>
<p>He, too,</p>
<p>matched the description</p>
<p>and had a criminal record.</p>
<p>So they now had</p>
<p>three suspects</p>
<p>from the Rash case file</p>
<p>and that other suspect</p>
<p>that they had found</p>
<p>who lived in the same</p>
<p>apartment complex as Kelly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s four viable suspects.</p>
<p>But Detective Smith</p>
<p>still needed to test</p>
<p>their DNA</p>
<p>against the sample</p>
<p>that they had found</p>
<p>in Kelly&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Enlisting the help</p>
<p>of the FBI,</p>
<p>they gathered DNA</p>
<p>from all four suspects.</p>
<p>But after all that hard work,</p>
<p>not one of them matched.</p>
<p>And so that</p>
<p>is where you come in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hoping to get</p>
<p>is with releasing</p>
<p>this information,</p>
<p>was there someone</p>
<p>known to her,</p>
<p>someone in that area,</p>
<p>someone that might,</p>
<p>for all I know,</p>
<p>was there a friendly</p>
<p>maintenance guy</p>
<p>at the apartment complex</p>
<p>that was of Korean descent</p>
<p>that we can go talk to,</p>
<p>that we can at least</p>
<p>try to eliminate,</p>
<p>or someone that no one</p>
<p>ever thought of</p>
<p>that had infatuation</p>
<p>with her,</p>
<p>who had said something to her,</p>
<p>who never really was</p>
<p>necessarily looked at</p>
<p>as a suspect.</p>
<p>But now,</p>
<p>with this information,</p>
<p>someone says,</p>
<p>hey, you should check out</p>
<p>so-and-so,</p>
<p>and allow us to do</p>
<p>the investigative work</p>
<p>to try to</p>
<p>rule them in or out.</p>
<p>Detectives also</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t given up hope</p>
<p>when it comes</p>
<p>to genetic genealogy.</p>
<p>Maybe if they could match</p>
<p>the DNA to a family member</p>
<p>or a distant relative,</p>
<p>they could trace it back</p>
<p>to someone who lived</p>
<p>in or around the area</p>
<p>where Kelly was killed</p>
<p>back in 1983.</p>
<p>With their full DNA profile,</p>
<p>detectives know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</p>
<p>before this case gets solved.</p>
<p>When we talked</p>
<p>to Kelly&rsquo;s sister, Amanda,</p>
<p>she shared a little bit</p>
<p>about what Kelly was like</p>
<p>growing up.</p>
<p>She told us that Kelly</p>
<p>was a prankster.</p>
<p>She loved to play</p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>Her favorite movie</p>
<p>was Fast Times at Ridgemont High.</p>
<p>She also loved to go</p>
<p>to Oakland A&rsquo;s games,</p>
<p>so much so that her family</p>
<p>buried her in her A&rsquo;s jacket.</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring themselves</p>
<p>to go to a baseball game</p>
<p>after her death.</p>
<p>She was kind and caring,</p>
<p>more like a second mom</p>
<p>to her little sister</p>
<p>than an older sibling.</p>
<p>And I want to leave you</p>
<p>with a story about</p>
<p>what Kelly was like</p>
<p>in Amanda&rsquo;s own words.</p>
<p>She was really funny,</p>
<p>really spunky.</p>
<p>She liked to play</p>
<p>practical jokes on my mom,</p>
<p>like Poltergeist.</p>
<p>The movie was a big thing</p>
<p>back then.</p>
<p>And so she set me up</p>
<p>in front of the TV</p>
<p>and taught me to say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Put the TV on a snowy channel,</p>
<p>called my mom,</p>
<p>had me break my mom out.</p>
<p>And she got grounded for that.</p>
<p>The anniversary of Kelly&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>is just a few days away.</p>
<p>And her sister Amanda</p>
<p>is still holding out hope</p>
<p>that someone out there</p>
<p>will finally come forward.</p>
<p>I hope that, you know,</p>
<p>somebody saw something,</p>
<p>somebody knows something.</p>
<p>And I just hope that,</p>
<p>you know, whoever that person is</p>
<p>will finally, you know,</p>
<p>do the right thing</p>
<p>and give us some peace</p>
<p>and give Kelly some peace.</p>
<p>So please,</p>
<p>go take a look</p>
<p>at the composites</p>
<p>on our website.</p>
<p>And if you know someone</p>
<p>who could be the person</p>
<p>in that sketch</p>
<p>and could have been</p>
<p>in the Fremont area</p>
<p>around when Kelly was murdered,</p>
<p>or if you know any information</p>
<p>that could be helpful,</p>
<p>please call the</p>
<p>Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>at 510-667-3636.</p>
