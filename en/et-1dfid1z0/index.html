<p>kimmer is out in the desert uh on the</p>
<p>way to las vegas marking for utilities</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s a brave</p>
<p>uh gal and she&rsquo;s on with us and dr</p>
<p>kimmer you&rsquo;re on with dr berg</p>
<p>hi dr bird</p>
<p>hello hi</p>
<p>hi</p>
<p>um my question is i started the diet</p>
<p>march first uh the keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>and maybe three weeks in</p>
<p>i felt kind of faint</p>
<p>as i was getting up from a box a</p>
<p>pool box</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like all my muscles just quit</p>
<p>at the same time and so i thought i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to do the electrolytes because</p>
<p>that sounds like a great idea but that</p>
<p>was when it wasn&rsquo;t hot</p>
<p>now today we&rsquo;re looking at 110 degrees</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>because i have my</p>
<p>my bottle right here how many can i do</p>
<p>how many bottles can i do in a day</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t know how much i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sweating because honestly i don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>it because it&rsquo;s a dry heat and so but i</p>
<p>know i am sweating because you know you</p>
<p>feel the heat you feel the woozy a</p>
<p>little bit so yeah that&rsquo;s what i was</p>
<p>wondering like how many servings</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>yeah good question um</p>
<p>are you in uh barcelo or lancaster</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m farther out i&rsquo;m actually in las</p>
<p>vegas</p>
<p>oh your father</p>
<p>okay because i practiced in the</p>
<p>lancaster for a bit but uh</p>
<p>that was that was uh definitely hot i</p>
<p>understand it&rsquo;s a dry heat so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know what&rsquo;s going on so um the</p>
<p>electrolytes were designed for the</p>
<p>average person who is</p>
<p>very deficient in potassium</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but if they use electrolytes in hot</p>
<p>weather uh or when they&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important to add</p>
<p>more sea salt and if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough sea salt that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel it your muscles</p>
<p>you feel weak okay</p>
<p>so um you could take as is really as</p>
<p>much as you want as much as you need</p>
<p>maybe a couple scoops per day but the</p>
<p>key is adding more sea salt to that so</p>
<p>if you put some sea salt maybe</p>
<p>an eighth of a teaspoon in your water</p>
<p>just mix it all in to dissolve it slug</p>
<p>it down i think you&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>refreshed i think you&rsquo;ll feel stronger</p>
<p>but we lose a lot more sodium</p>
<p>than we do other minerals so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really the secret so the combination i</p>
<p>think will help you greatly</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so impressed by the taste because</p>
<p>when you said there&rsquo;s no sugar in it i</p>
<p>was like oh this is gonna be like</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s amazing like</p>
<p>i drink this instead of soda and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been drinking dr pepper since i was born</p>
<p>basically so yeah this this stuff is</p>
<p>amazing thank you so much for coming i</p>
<p>appreciate that because</p>
<p>oh i appreciate that because it took us</p>
<p>a long time a lot of trial and error to</p>
<p>make it work and to find the flavorings</p>
<p>that were um didn&rsquo;t have the hidden</p>
<p>maltodextrins so unfortunately yeah</p>
<p>those are</p>
<p>more expensive so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um but you know what um i&rsquo;m into quality</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why we put it in there i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>glad you like it</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>great well thank you kimmer uh for</p>
<p>taking time out of your busy day and</p>
<p>that big rumbling diesel and she is like</p>
<p>i said has an amazing attitude for being</p>
<p>out there in the middle of the desert</p>
<p>and i made that trip a few times doc to</p>
<p>vegas and uh you know if you break down</p>
<p>on 15</p>
<p>god help you god help you yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be a dry lizard in in two</p>
<p>seconds anyway thank you uh kimmer again</p>
<p>and have fun out there and let&rsquo;s kick it</p>
<p>off with the first quiz doc and here it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see if i could</p>
<p>okay i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see it steve all right well i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to age you and the first question</p>
<p>says what&rsquo;s in bread that makes it so</p>
<p>addictive</p>
<p>and i would certainly like to know that</p>
<p>so audience what&rsquo;s in bread that makes</p>
<p>it so</p>
<p>addictive and uh that is your first</p>
<p>question of the day and let&rsquo;s not ignore</p>
<p>all the wonderful folks on social media</p>
<p>so chuck from youtube why does my</p>
<p>varicose veins why do my varicose veins</p>
<p>hurt so much i&rsquo;ve been fasting for most</p>
<p>of my 85 years but this pain only has</p>
<p>started in recent years help</p>
<p>well i i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>your uh vascular system it could be the</p>
<p>nerves that go the vascular system that</p>
<p>causes more perception of pain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just my guess i would have to do</p>
<p>a bigger evaluation but i think one</p>
<p>thing that i would recommend that you</p>
<p>need more of anything related to</p>
<p>neuritis or um</p>
<p>related to like nerve pain that would be</p>
<p>b1 so that would be nutritional yeast i</p>
<p>would recommend that you may just find</p>
<p>that solves your problem now</p>
<p>you can get</p>
<p>certain types of pain from the vascular</p>
<p>system either creating pressure</p>
<p>on the nerves um</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>i i don&rsquo;t know your situation i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you&rsquo;re exercising but definitely</p>
<p>the best thing to do for that would be</p>
<p>to get more circulation</p>
<p>get more circulation into those those</p>
<p>structures uh through exercise and that</p>
<p>normally would would handle things</p>
<p>related to</p>
<p>uh pressure building up in your</p>
<p>circulatory system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific and there&rsquo;s certainly no</p>
<p>shortage of people that ain&rsquo;t got a</p>
<p>gallbladder no more and linda is asking</p>
<p>if your gallbladder formula is the only</p>
<p>thing i need is i don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gallbladder or do i need some digestive</p>
<p>enzymes and will they help lower</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>well um bile salts help uh mobilize</p>
<p>cholesterol in fact it&rsquo;s the major route</p>
<p>where you get rid of excess amount of</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>and triglycerides so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>my gallbladder formula has not just bile</p>
<p>it has enzymes it has the betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride has things to thin the</p>
<p>bile it&rsquo;s a really interesting</p>
<p>combination of a lot of things to help</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all the just different major digestive</p>
<p>organ</p>
<p>structures so a lot of people like it</p>
<p>because it has this combination</p>
<p>and you know i&rsquo;ve worked over the years</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>perfecting the ratios of different</p>
<p>things so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good high quality product</p>
<p>that you might want to try i would take</p>
<p>it um just with your meals because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the gallbladder you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>not going to have the quantity of bile</p>
<p>and the stored concentration of bile</p>
<p>that you need to be released and then</p>
<p>help you extract these fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins so um</p>
<p>you know that gallbladder is a really</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>structure that sac</p>
<p>to help you</p>
<p>contract and get the amount of bile and</p>
<p>people just like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>doctors just don&rsquo;t talk about the</p>
<p>importance of bile and the gallbladder</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an extra organ okay it&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>extra organ that was a mistake that we</p>
<p>have it is definitely not that so if</p>
<p>whoever tells you that just does not</p>
<p>understand the function of aisle</p>
<p>and the gallbladder so i always like to</p>
<p>tell people to ask the doctor</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>says something kind of crazy like that</p>
<p>just say well what is the purpose of the</p>
<p>gallbladder and if they say there is no</p>
<p>purpose then</p>
<p>find another doctor</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re here okay folks well it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>for us to acknowledge uh all the</p>
<p>wonderful people that are watching us</p>
<p>out of the world and later in the show</p>

<p>united states and again daniel will be</p>
<p>up with us later representing mexico so</p>
<p>thanks everyone so much for watching and</p>
<p>speaking of listeners we have the answer</p>
<p>to the first question which asks hang on</p>
<p>let me read that again</p>
<p>what what&rsquo;s in bread that makes the darn</p>
<p>stuff so addictive</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>70 of our respondents say gluten 20 say</p>
<p>fruitos</p>
<p>other forms of sugar and 10 say it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>yeast</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s the answer is it&rsquo;s gluten</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s interesting that that many</p>
<p>people knew that because um</p>
<p>like what is it about gluten that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>good well first of all it helps you with</p>
<p>this amazing texture right of the bread</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certain types of</p>
<p>proteins in gluten</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>mimic</p>
<p>opioids</p>
<p>so as you know we do have an opioid</p>
<p>problem like fentanyl it&rsquo;s a synthetic</p>
<p>opioid which is highly addictive</p>
<p>and creates devastating effects so</p>
<p>so now we&rsquo;re actually getting a little</p>
<p>bit of a</p>
<p>like a little bit of fentanyl every time</p>
<p>you eat breasts like it just kind of</p>
<p>gets you this wow i feel so good i feel</p>
<p>this this sense of um euphoria like</p>
<p>um eating bread so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this is why it&rsquo;s addictive</p>
<p>um so if you were to this is why uh</p>
<p>people when they do even gluten-free</p>
<p>bread they don&rsquo;t really like it as much</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t become as addictive</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that is why and so</p>
<p>you know if you like bread and</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>if you attempt or even hint to take away</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s bread</p>
<p>some people get upset so i think just</p>
<p>really important just for people</p>
<p>understand like</p>
<p>why do i like it so much so you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually something in there that</p>
<p>mimics a drug</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m going to be doing a video on that</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and the title of that video is going to</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>you may never eat bread again after</p>
<p>watching this video</p>
<p>my goodness well i wanted to give some</p>
<p>hope to the folks so i&rsquo;m intermittent</p>
<p>fasting and cutting out carbs uh</p>
<p>tremendously and when i used to try to</p>
<p>knock off bread and sugar and so on it</p>
<p>was agonizing i see somebody slather</p>
<p>some butter on it but i really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>an urge for it anymore and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first time in my entire life</p>
<p>i still think about some of the sweets</p>
<p>you know and i have to kind of put that</p>
<p>out of mind but thank goodness bread is</p>
<p>no longer agonizing me and i know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because of</p>
<p>dr berg&rsquo;s various routines</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and you know keto</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m very very thankful that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to do that battle</p>
<p>anymore and nor do many people in our</p>
<p>audience who report such things let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh cassandra from youtube i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taking your electrolyte powders and</p>
<p>sleeping like a baby and feeling awesome</p>
<p>which multivitamins do i need to take</p>
<p>well i i don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>multivitamin however the</p>
<p>keto energy is probably the closest to</p>
<p>that because it has all the natural</p>
<p>vitamin combinations with with certain b</p>
<p>vitamins that are in the natural form um</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>honestly i think that you should attempt</p>
<p>to get</p>
<p>the majority of your vitamins from food</p>
<p>the the um</p>
<p>the number one</p>
<p>vitamins sold out there that i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>they make billions i&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>mention their name</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re a multivitamin i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably the top three</p>
<p>companies they&rsquo;re just like pure</p>
<p>synthetic the quality of those</p>
<p>ingredients are so low</p>
<p>um that</p>
<p>i mean</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re selling all these and people</p>
<p>just think oh yeah i&rsquo;m getting these</p>
<p>great great nutrients uh</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you are</p>
<p>so try to get it from food</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting okay let&rsquo;s see um so</p>
<p>bridget maybe she&rsquo;s a weightlifter from</p>
<p>youtube i&rsquo;m three weeks into keto and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m at my desired weight and i feel</p>
<p>great but i want to drop my body fat</p>
<p>percentage from 36 to 30. boy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>specific what can i do to achieve this</p>
<p>goal</p>
<p>well two things you want to drop your</p>
<p>insulin levels</p>
<p>um as much as you can to get leaner</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you need to go lower carb</p>
<p>and fast longer</p>
<p>those two actions uh will make you very</p>
<p>very lean</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then you can also add more exercise</p>
<p>too</p>
<p>wonderful harry wants to know a good way</p>
<p>to gain weight without consuming carbs</p>
<p>um well i&rsquo;m guessing you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>gain fat you want to gain muscle i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>guessing um so maybe make sure your your</p>
<p>quantity of food is um</p>
<p>is higher if your metabolism is fast</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to eat more food and so you</p>
<p>know maybe keep your your carbs at the</p>
<p>the max like 50</p>
<p>grams per day and consume</p>
<p>carbs that don&rsquo;t turn the sugar very</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>and then increase your your fat that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be really important and then</p>
<p>exercise to stimulate the muscle to make</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>respond by becoming larger</p>
<p>um so we&rsquo;re really just dealing with uh</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have carbs protein and fats</p>
<p>right so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna have to have more of</p>
<p>that but not too much pro don&rsquo;t go crazy</p>
<p>with excessive</p>
<p>massive amounts of protein because some</p>
<p>of that can turn into sugar as well</p>
<p>terrific dutch guy i&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>real name uh says you said you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>favor synthetic supplements but how</p>
<p>about cod liver oil supplements that</p>
<p>contain synthetic vitamin e</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t like that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like that um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some really interesting data on</p>
<p>these synthetic vitamin e i mean the</p>
<p>only time i&rsquo;d recommend synthetic</p>
<p>vitamin e is if you&rsquo;re doing a detox a</p>
<p>short-term</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a month or two detox</p>
<p>but not as a long-term maintenance why</p>
<p>because the synthetic</p>
<p>the chemistry of synthetic vitamins are</p>
<p>very very different</p>
<p>and synthetic phytonutrients as well and</p>
<p>they might act like an antioxidant but</p>
<p>then they become</p>
<p>an oxidant</p>
<p>so they can create more oxidation</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>long-term safety studies on these and</p>
<p>um it might sound like they&rsquo;re harmless</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t trust them</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that i hope that answers that and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to take a vitamin e one of</p>
<p>the best sources</p>
<p>the type i would get would be</p>
<p>tocatrinals that&rsquo;s a really good good</p>
<p>type of vitamin it&rsquo;s a kind of a new</p>
<p>concept for people they&rsquo;re used used to</p>
<p>cough rolls but toe katrina&rsquo;s just um</p>
<p>they work a lot better</p>
<p>terrific well catherine seems to have a</p>
<p>complaint that you&rsquo;ve talked about i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very thin and healthy you&rsquo;re not thin</p>
<p>and i do i f and would like to continue</p>
<p>for a lifetime but i&rsquo;m slowly losing</p>
<p>more weight will my weight stabilize i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>five nine 140 pounds and 45 years old</p>
<p>yeah they should stabilize you you want</p>
<p>to add i just eat more food here here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the problem when you start doing fasting</p>
<p>you start burning your fat and then now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not hungry anymore because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burning your fat so um</p>
<p>so some people with a very fast</p>
<p>metabolism they just need to eat a lot</p>
<p>more food</p>
<p>when they eat not frequent meals but</p>
<p>more food and probably</p>
<p>more fat for sure</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a condition of</p>
<p>epilepsy right for the kids that have</p>
<p>epilepsy a lot of times they&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet but a very large</p>
<p>percentage of them don&rsquo;t stick with it</p>
<p>unfortunately because the type of</p>
<p>keto that they&rsquo;re recommending is just</p>
<p>like crazy unhealthy and they don&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>at the ingredients and it&rsquo;s just the you</p>
<p>know just oh yeah just drink a bunch of</p>
<p>cream with add this in there and even</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>terrible canned keto shakes</p>
<p>you know with the epilepsy you want to</p>
<p>really have your ratio</p>
<p>to fat to protein like really a lot of</p>
<p>fat and not as much protein so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a two or three to one fat to protein</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>there is a way to do that that is so</p>
<p>healthy you just need to like</p>
<p>rearrange the foods to create this super</p>
<p>high fat</p>
<p>you know moderately low protein and very</p>
<p>low carb</p>
<p>to help these kids and um</p>
<p>and that way you&rsquo;ll get compliance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get health</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but if you do it the regular way that is</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>being promoted</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a lot of digest</p>
<p>your kid is going to have a lot of</p>
<p>digestive problems and they&rsquo;ll give up</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>when it could really work for them</p>
<p>so i will be doing some videos on that</p>
<p>because i know</p>
<p>there are kids out there that</p>
<p>can benefit from this i mean immensely</p>
<p>terrific okay let&rsquo;s kick off another</p>
<p>question this one&rsquo;s a true false if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get gi symptoms from gluten</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re safe to eat it is that true</p>
<p>or false audience</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m talking about digestive problems if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get any digestive problems</p>
<p>when you eat gluten</p>
<p>i mean it must be okay to eat right i</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s true correct</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see we&rsquo;ll see if the audience has</p>
<p>an opinion on that i&rsquo;ll stand by just a</p>
<p>moment here doc let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>uh go back to social media for a moment</p>
<p>a moment</p>
<p>oh wow here&rsquo;s another gallbladder when</p>
<p>donna from youtube i have no gallbladder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a common theme and i&rsquo;m a type 2</p>
<p>diabetic who&rsquo;s had a complete</p>
<p>hysterectomy what can i do to lose</p>
<p>weight quickly</p>
<p>well you still have your thyroid so make</p>
<p>sure you say that right hopefully they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t take that out um</p>
<p>you just need to um you need more data</p>
<p>you need more videos to watch and you</p>
<p>need to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>support the missing organs</p>
<p>so you have more of a</p>
<p>complete body function</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the quick answer is</p>
<p>very simply to go on my um</p>
<p>healthy version of ketosis with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting as your basic thing</p>
<p>before you think about anything else</p>
<p>just get on that program go to my</p>
<p>website search it dr</p>
<p>get on it and then watch what happens</p>
<p>and see if you really need to do</p>
<p>anything else because</p>
<p>that is so powerful um the results are</p>
<p>fantastic and you&rsquo;ll see when you do it</p>
<p>and so that way</p>
<p>you know no one has to kind of uh</p>
<p>educate you on it because you know it</p>
<p>works because you tried it that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>the most important thing is to you have</p>
<p>to try it out to see if it works for you</p>
<p>terrific okay let&rsquo;s go back to the green</p>
<p>room and we&rsquo;ve got dana who i kept</p>
<p>calling holly because she&rsquo;s from holly</p>
<p>michigan but she&rsquo;s forgiven me</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to bring her up on the</p>
<p>air and there she is</p>
<p>dana you&rsquo;re on with dr burke</p>
<p>hi dr berg hi</p>
<p>um i have a little bit of a complicated</p>
<p>situation that i don&rsquo;t know how to get</p>
<p>out of</p>
<p>my husband does most of the cooking and</p>
<p>just about all the grocery shopping</p>
<p>and he sabotages me</p>
<p>regularly</p>
<p>i you know i tell him what i want i give</p>
<p>him a list and he always seems to come</p>
<p>home with</p>
<p>so many really really tempting treats</p>
<p>like bread and chocolate and ice cream</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>he eats differently than i need to he</p>
<p>had a uh</p>
<p>bypass the bypass surgery</p>
<p>many many years ago but still feels like</p>
<p>he needs to eat all the time and his</p>
<p>weight is obviously increasing but i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get them on the same page with me</p>
<p>do you have any advice for me to how to</p>
<p>handle that and what i can do to maybe</p>
<p>get my temptation levels down there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>type of therapy it&rsquo;s called um let me</p>
<p>think stranglization therapy</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what i would honestly if after a period</p>
<p>of time you can&rsquo;t convince them i would</p>
<p>personally bite the bullet and you just</p>
<p>buy your own food go up get your own</p>
<p>food keep it separate um because</p>
<p>unfortunately you know sometimes when</p>
<p>you have family in there it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to keep everyone the same</p>
<p>on board on the same viewpoint they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t always have the same</p>
<p>you know viewpoint so now you have to</p>
<p>cope as best as you can i would</p>
<p>personally buy your own food and cook</p>
<p>your own food</p>
<p>and that way you control it you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in charge you&rsquo;re not dependent on anyone</p>
<p>else and so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s the simple answer</p>
<p>after you tried something now i gotta</p>
<p>learn how to cook</p>
<p>you know um here&rsquo;s the thing um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll give you an example of what i ate</p>
<p>yesterday</p>
<p>i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not doing any weird like wild</p>
<p>recipes i i took some lettuce leaves i</p>
<p>took some</p>
<p>ham</p>
<p>slice of cheese little mayonnaise</p>
<p>with a slice of um</p>
<p>tomato and i made my little sandwich i</p>
<p>had like several of those</p>
<p>and that was my meal so</p>
<p>you you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to do any</p>
<p>type of major recipes or</p>
<p>like you should find some recipes that</p>
<p>have like four items to put together</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>do it do with that style which is kind</p>
<p>of boring but it&rsquo;s simple i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing that for forever so</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;ll give you okay</p>
<p>yeah make it simple</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t add too many complexities because</p>
<p>we want you just to stay in the plan so</p>
<p>you can do it long enough to get the</p>
<p>results</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay let hubby have it for goodness</p>
<p>sakes dana get him get him on board with</p>
<p>all this stuff well thanks for being on</p>
<p>with us fine i&rsquo;ll get them in line</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great so by the way one of our</p>
<p>former summits long before covid hit um</p>
<p>i watched uh dr berg in action so he</p>
<p>says all these things but does he do</p>
<p>them yes you know they had all sorts of</p>
<p>well actually it was a clean slate for</p>
<p>food but there was plenty of stuff you</p>
<p>could get in trouble with in that big</p>
<p>hotel and he wolf down the lettuce and</p>
<p>all the things he described even though</p>
<p>he could have maybe taken a cheat</p>
<p>weekend from all the pressure he had</p>
<p>with this big summit but he didn&rsquo;t so</p>
<p>you know if some people are saying gee</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little tough well maybe it is but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you dr berg doesn&rsquo;t so does</p>
<p>karen they look 20 years younger than</p>
<p>their actual age doc you&rsquo;re 85 now right</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;m 85 and going on 23. there you go</p>
<p>no but they they they walk the walk</p>
<p>trust me i can see it well i sneak off</p>
<p>and do something bad in the corner but</p>
<p>anyway i&rsquo;m learning okay let&rsquo;s see what</p>
<p>do we have up next let me see if we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got some answers to the question</p>
<p>uh yes we do uh in the question once</p>
<p>again asked</p>
<p>excuse me true false if you don&rsquo;t get gi</p>
<p>symptoms from gluten then you&rsquo;re safe to</p>
<p>eat it and the audience</p>
<p>uh a hundred percent say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely false who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>i always you know the only reason i</p>
<p>asked that question is just to see if</p>
<p>anyone did say that&rsquo;s true i wanted to</p>
<p>know because um what&rsquo;s interesting when</p>
<p>you consume gluten for example</p>
<p>and you feel bloated whatever like like</p>
<p>wow i have maybe have gluten intolerance</p>
<p>maybe i have celiac you know things like</p>
<p>that um but here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like i just said before you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stimulating</p>
<p>opioids</p>
<p>opioid opioid receptors it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like a little bit like this morph</p>
<p>morphine effect</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>which numbs</p>
<p>some or masks some of these</p>
<p>gi pain syndromes that you would</p>
<p>normally have that you don&rsquo;t feel it but</p>
<p>that but the damage brews in the</p>
<p>evidence so it&rsquo;s called non-celiac or</p>
<p>asymptomatic celiac disease which i</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>a large percent of the population might</p>
<p>have a version of this</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t get the gi symptoms</p>
<p>they get other symptoms</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>autoimmune problems with</p>
<p>like hashimoto&rsquo;s for example they might</p>
<p>get fatigue</p>
<p>insomnia skin reactions psoriasis</p>
<p>all these other symptoms that they would</p>
<p>never connect to this gluten</p>
<p>until they one day decide to do the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and they know they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have bread anymore all of a sudden they</p>
<p>all these problems clear up</p>
<p>it might not even be the lowering of</p>
<p>insulin it could just be the elimination</p>
<p>of gluten so um i am going to release</p>
<p>the video on that i think it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>watching because there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>fascinating things about this gluten</p>
<p>that you maybe never heard before</p>
<p>okay whenever you want a chunk of bread</p>
<p>just grab some of dr berg&rsquo;s nutritional</p>
<p>yeast just gulp a couple of those things</p>
<p>down and</p>
<p>the urge will drift away</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see kimberly uh wants to know if</p>
<p>doing pro when doing prolonged fasting</p>
<p>should i continue taking my tutka and</p>
<p>probiotics</p>
<p>well it depends what you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>solve</p>
<p>um tutka is good for a lot of things</p>
<p>bile sludge nausea</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like a long-term product you</p>
<p>take it until you kind of get enough</p>
<p>bile and then</p>
<p>change your diet and then you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>shown some powerful other benefits</p>
<p>including decreasing allergies</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>restoring liver function</p>
<p>quite a few things um</p>
<p>you should watch my video in tuck cuts</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually just a i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anything about it until like two years</p>
<p>ago but it&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>synthetic bile that is basically</p>
<p>mimicking</p>
<p>a bile from a bear</p>
<p>and so in a lot of ancient cultures they</p>
<p>use this bear bile for a lot of</p>
<p>different things but</p>
<p>you know the problem is killing all</p>
<p>these bears is a big problem so they</p>
<p>made it synthetically which apparently</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to have</p>
<p>any side effects that i could see</p>
<p>but the benefits like far outweigh the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>any potential problems but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it thins the bile</p>
<p>um and</p>
<p>if someone has like bloating or or</p>
<p>pain right around the pancreas or</p>
<p>pancreatitis or any type of backup of</p>
<p>the spile and they start getting right</p>
<p>shoulder pain or</p>
<p>upper back pain</p>
<p>this is like the miracle so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that i wish i knew about a</p>
<p>long time ago but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a recommendation so you</p>
<p>just have to seek it out do your own</p>
<p>research and</p>
<p>and find find it you know if you need it</p>
<p>you know it works great if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need it</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>great advice okay now bulky xena</p>
<p>uh is um</p>
<p>is on youtube and you know again we hear</p>
<p>all these things and questions but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people that are grateful</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re done and formerly bulky xena</p>
<p>i guess says she&rsquo;s lost 30 pounds in</p>
<p>january</p>
<p>thanks to fasting uh all thanks to you</p>
<p>dr berg so that&rsquo;s a lot of that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great to hear some acknowledgments of</p>
<p>how this stuff works so thank you</p>
<p>very much thank you yes a shrinking</p>
<p>bulky xena let&rsquo;s see okay</p>
<p>uh we did that one um christina</p>
<p>can i do the keto diet with afib</p>
<p>i think you should i think you should</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>atrial fibrillation is a form of</p>
<p>arrhythmias which</p>
<p>normally come from a lack of</p>
<p>electrolytes especially potassium and</p>
<p>magnesium which</p>
<p>well how you become deficient in</p>
<p>magnesium potassium well</p>
<p>number one you&rsquo;re not consuming enough</p>
<p>foods that have those trace minerals</p>
<p>like large groups of salad but also the</p>
<p>amount of carbs will deplete potassium</p>
<p>and magnesium to a very large amount so</p>
<p>i think it can help you greatly but just</p>
<p>realize there&rsquo;s one more um connection</p>
<p>between arrhythmias or even atrial fib</p>
<p>in your digestive system if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough bile</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some little problem with</p>
<p>your liver because you have a fatty</p>
<p>liver because you do carbs or you have a</p>
<p>gallbladder issue that can create</p>
<p>palpitations or arrhythmic issues</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>purified bowel salts can help you with</p>
<p>that if that&rsquo;s the cause so you know i</p>
<p>just have a lot of videos on these</p>
<p>relationships</p>
<p>that you can look at and</p>
<p>figure out you know why you have</p>
<p>the problem you have and one last point</p>
<p>i had i didn&rsquo;t have atrial fib but i had</p>
<p>severe heart rhythmic problems</p>
<p>a while ago and</p>
<p>um nothing worked right here my diet&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>and then i find out this interesting</p>
<p>connection between electromagnetic</p>
<p>fields so i got this device i might even</p>
<p>have it around here and i started to</p>
<p>check</p>
<p>my house my computer</p>
<p>massive massive with the uh with the</p>
<p>battery backup and the power cables so i</p>
<p>fixed all that</p>
<p>still didn&rsquo;t prove anything and then i</p>
<p>had this idea to check the rest of my</p>
<p>house and i found that</p>
<p>the wall in the back of our headboard</p>
<p>where my bed is</p>
<p>was off the chart like eight feet it was</p>
<p>extending eight feet these</p>
<p>electromagnetic fields um and so i had</p>
<p>i literally had to have an electrician</p>
<p>come in and tear out the wall and find</p>
<p>all these wires crossed</p>
<p>um and it was producing electromagnetic</p>
<p>i was basically sleeping in this this</p>
<p>bathing in this electromagnetic field</p>
<p>which is not good for your heart and um</p>
<p>and once they corrected that completely</p>
<p>gone</p>
<p>slept like a baby</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you have that problem watch my video</p>
<p>on emf</p>
<p>um because i talk about it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fantastic well uh allison from</p>
<p>edison new jersey popped off and just</p>
<p>popped back on so while we&rsquo;ve got her i</p>
<p>want to take her and uh allison you were</p>
<p>on with your one question with dr byrd</p>
<p>uh oh alison can you hear us all right</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go back it looks like she&rsquo;s muted</p>
<p>okay allison are muted</p>
<p>actually not here she&rsquo;s had a little</p>
<p>issue with her internet so we&rsquo;ll go back</p>
<p>to her in a while how about if we go to</p>
<p>our former guest daniel who&rsquo;s in mexico</p>
<p>city and daniel you sir are on with dr</p>
<p>burke</p>
<p>hey dr berg</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>hey great to hear you again</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;ve been doing the keto and and</p>
<p>fasting for maybe now six months and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been amazing the way it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>helping me to solve all type of issues</p>
<p>that i have uh last year</p>
<p>um the only thing that i&rsquo;m still trying</p>
<p>to solve is my high levels of</p>
<p>cholesterol i&rsquo;ve been watching your</p>
<p>videos on cholesterol i&rsquo;ve been running</p>
<p>away from every single opinion regarding</p>
<p>and things like that</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m still you know struggling with</p>
<p>cholesterol around 400</p>
<p>milligrams of cholesterol and i&rsquo;m 35</p>
<p>years old doing keto and fasting so any</p>
<p>suggestions</p>
<p>did you see my video today that i</p>
<p>released</p>
<p>not yet</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re missing um</p>
<p>the the main control of a bile</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>getting rid of any extra</p>
<p>is the</p>
<p>um is the bile the biohacks controls</p>
<p>cholesterol so cholesterol is controlled</p>
<p>by bile</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s from your gallbladder so uh</p>
<p>taking bile salts would be very</p>
<p>important but</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing you have two types</p>
<p>of bile you have primary bile that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>made by your liver and you have</p>
<p>secondary bile</p>
<p>do you know about secondary bile</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s made by your microbes in</p>
<p>your gut so let&rsquo;s say for example you</p>
<p>had a history of something that killed</p>
<p>off your microbes or maybe antibiotic or</p>
<p>whatever</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>okay you you now you you&rsquo;re wondering</p>
<p>why you don&rsquo;t have enough bile to deal</p>
<p>with this cholesterol</p>
<p>so taking um</p>
<p>a probiotic would be good</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>in addition to the bile salts</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>you know a really good way to get these</p>
<p>microbes</p>
<p>is to</p>
<p>make your own sauerkraut or kimchi or</p>
<p>make your own kefir because</p>
<p>kefir</p>
<p>and the fermented vegetables</p>
<p>especially if you make them it is like</p>
<p>way way way higher in microbes than if</p>
<p>you buy it at the store</p>
<p>unless you find um like from from the</p>
<p>farmers market so recently i&rsquo;m into the</p>
<p>kefir thing and i</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i found that in my state i can get raw</p>
<p>milk so i&rsquo;m making raw milk what a</p>
<p>difference huge and these microbes</p>
<p>you can make it really sour so you have</p>
<p>like super amounts of microbes and</p>
<p>friendly yeast</p>
<p>and you start taking that it repopulates</p>
<p>your gut now</p>
<p>you start building the secondary</p>
<p>bile salts that can then uh now help you</p>
<p>with this cholesterol overlap so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the real two answers the bile salts</p>
<p>tutka and then also the probiotic i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s like the missing link</p>
<p>awesome sounds great i will</p>
<p>try it keep keep you posted and thank</p>
<p>you so much for everything</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>yeah these these these microbes are just</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so interesting to me because they</p>
<p>they break down food uh they break down</p>
<p>certain</p>
<p>proteins and they they give you all</p>
<p>these in new flavors</p>
<p>like from cheese</p>
<p>and yogurt and of course bread and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just being sarcastic</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t really eat bread in</p>
<p>mexico</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>but i tell you it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>they sure give these wonderful flavors</p>
<p>from all these different fermented</p>
<p>products that you can make</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like doing major research in this</p>
<p>area i even</p>
<p>bought</p>
<p>this right here</p>
<p>which is a lactic acid test kit so i can</p>
<p>start checking</p>
<p>how much lactic acid i&rsquo;m making and do</p>
<p>all these interesting experiments so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>having some fun doing that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wonderful what could be more</p>
<p>natural than honey and robert wants to</p>
<p>know uh if it&rsquo;s good or bad for us</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t recommend honey because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very high in</p>
<p>sugar and</p>
<p>well you might say it&rsquo;s natural but yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just too high in sugar so of</p>
<p>course it&rsquo;s better than refined sugar</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t recommend it in any products</p>
<p>now what about bee pollen yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for the immune system</p>
<p>but not honey</p>
<p>and then you also people who say well</p>
<p>what about fruit fruit&rsquo;s natural why</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t i do fruit i mean you could</p>
<p>the only reason i don&rsquo;t recommend fruit</p>
<p>berries are okay but</p>
<p>uh the fruit first</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>is not necessarily uh the natural</p>
<p>version that our bodies were designed to</p>
<p>consume</p>
<p>a long time ago um fruit wasn&rsquo;t as sweet</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have the carbohydrates and it was</p>
<p>seasonal so</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t something all year round so it</p>
<p>just gives us way too much sugar in fact</p>
<p>all i did was consume i think maybe</p>
<p>two apples a day</p>
<p>and my weight went up to 211</p>
<p>pounds</p>
<p>and if you watch my earlier videos</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see my face was literally</p>
<p>round and my eyes were puffy and that</p>
<p>was that the two apples now</p>
<p>they were honeycrisp they had 19 grams</p>
<p>of sugar</p>
<p>per apple</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s all that i did different than</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing now</p>
<p>the darn apple so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>gives you a lot of sugar</p>
<p>bummer okay time for another question</p>
<p>this is a true falser the primary reason</p>
<p>to consume bone broth is to get more</p>
<p>protein well audience is that true</p>
<p>or is that false</p>
<p>and i know they&rsquo;re sharpening their</p>
<p>pencil right now getting on it let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um okay barbara from youtube i&rsquo;m fasting</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>but can that slow down my metabolism and</p>
<p>perhaps make me more prone to sickness</p>
<p>now fasting doesn&rsquo;t slow down your</p>
<p>metabolism it actually speeds it up</p>
<p>um you know sometimes uh people put out</p>
<p>this false uh</p>
<p>information that you have to eat</p>
<p>frequently to stimulate your metabolism</p>
<p>really so in other words i should have</p>
<p>all these snacks and then i&rsquo;m gonna have</p>
<p>a fast metabolism no no no it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>increase insulin and then you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have insulin resistance and insulin</p>
<p>resistance is really behind</p>
<p>a very damaged slow metabolism in fact</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to develop this set point</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very high so you&rsquo;ll never be able</p>
<p>to get below a certain weight unless you</p>
<p>correct insulin resistance</p>
<p>which comes from the frequent eating so</p>
<p>fasting can</p>
<p>actually help correct</p>
<p>your metabolic pathways metabolic</p>
<p>syndrome and insulin resistance so you</p>
<p>can have a faster metabolism again</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific why don&rsquo;t we go to a</p>
<p>reed in bend oregon</p>
<p>uh who has</p>
<p>a question for you read your own with dr</p>
<p>byrd</p>
<p>good morning my question is very similar</p>
<p>to daniels</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been on your healthy</p>
<p>keto plan for about three months now</p>
<p>take a lot of your supplements</p>
<p>really cognizant of my electrolyte</p>
<p>intake</p>
<p>sea salt really kind of following your</p>
<p>program the best that i can and recently</p>
<p>had my lab work done everything was</p>
<p>great except for my lipid profile</p>
<p>my cholesterol was 209 which i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>really concerned with triglycerides 160</p>
<p>and 133 for the ldl my doctor</p>
<p>recommended that i consider lipitor</p>
<p>which i declined</p>
<p>everything that i&rsquo;ve been doing my my</p>
<p>assumption is that i&rsquo;m trending in the</p>
<p>right direction but i&rsquo;m just curious if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>tweak and you&rsquo;ve already mentioned a</p>
<p>couple of things that some i&rsquo;m already</p>
<p>doing um but yeah my question is</p>
<p>regarding the 209 cholesterol</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>honestly</p>
<p>uh i don&rsquo;t know if it was 25 or 35 years</p>
<p>ago</p>
<p>the normal cholesterol was 225 and they</p>
<p>lowered it to 200 and all of a sudden</p>
<p>they put everyone on</p>
<p>a lot of drugs overnight um they do the</p>
<p>same thing if i&rsquo;m not mistaken with the</p>
<p>bmi</p>
<p>index</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>honestly i would um i would definitely</p>
<p>watch the video i released today because</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re concerned you do an advanced</p>
<p>lipid profile test look at the two</p>
<p>different types of</p>
<p>ldl particle sizes and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know i have a video explaining that</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find that the type of</p>
<p>ldl</p>
<p>particle that you have is going to be</p>
<p>the large buoyant which is is not the</p>
<p>type that invades the arteries</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing keto you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>mobilizing a lot of the cholesterol from</p>
<p>your fat cells</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>you know you may this is</p>
<p>going to be a temporary thing</p>
<p>until</p>
<p>you stabilize but with a little bit of</p>
<p>probiotic and bile salts things will</p>
<p>improve faster</p>
<p>but i would definitely recommend getting</p>
<p>that advanced lipid profile test to</p>
<p>and uh learn more about it because um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find that this is a normal</p>
<p>thing happening and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re not in danger of a heart</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>unfortunately my doctor declined</p>
<p>letting me take that test encouraged me</p>
<p>to do a coronary calcium test um</p>
<p>which uh i actually just canceled</p>
<p>because i really not interested in</p>
<p>having the radiation at this point but i</p>
<p>do take your gallbladder formula twice a</p>
<p>day and your probiotic solution every</p>
<p>evening before bed um so i mean i think</p>
<p>if i tested four months ago my numbers</p>
<p>would be quite a bit different than they</p>
<p>are now again i think i&rsquo;m trending in</p>
<p>the right direction but yeah i</p>
<p>appreciate your insight</p>
<p>absolutely</p>
<p>absolutely and um</p>
<p>i always like to you know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working with the physician you got to</p>
<p>find someone that is at least</p>
<p>open enough to work with you and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so many docs out</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s like okay find someone that</p>
<p>is um there&rsquo;s a cardiologist the keto</p>
<p>friendly cardiologist that can also you</p>
<p>can if you ever need to talk to someone</p>
<p>they consult people remotely and then</p>
<p>you can uh get this other viewpoint that</p>
<p>is um</p>
<p>not so fixed on this the same old same</p>
<p>old so but i thought it sounds like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the right track reid so</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re just going to probably</p>
<p>continue and</p>
<p>you know cross that road later if you</p>
<p>need to</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome that&rsquo;s great read and</p>
<p>please do get back with us as things</p>
<p>progress and tell us how you&rsquo;re doing we</p>
<p>always love to hear</p>
<p>we like the back story but we like what</p>
<p>happens afterwards so thanks for joining</p>
<p>us today that&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>and uh you know not only are people in</p>
<p>the green room participating but so are</p>
<p>everyone in the audience because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>quickly answered</p>
<p>the next question true false the primary</p>
<p>reason to consume bone broth is to get</p>
<p>more protein</p>
<p>and the audience</p>
<p>85 say false 15 say it&rsquo;s absolutely true</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>i mean it can be one one reason um but</p>
<p>the two big</p>
<p>things about bone broth is number one</p>
<p>it helps</p>
<p>the gut issues because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>it has certain factors that help the</p>
<p>permeability or the leakiness of that</p>
<p>gut and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one issue the gut</p>
<p>um number two is actually arthritis</p>
<p>and joint problems</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really know why that works</p>
<p>but a lot of people take it for</p>
<p>arthritis</p>
<p>is it the collagen is it this is it that</p>
<p>i will be releasing a video on another</p>
<p>theory</p>
<p>that i think</p>
<p>is why it might help your joints</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also a huge connection</p>
<p>between your gut problems and your</p>
<p>joints as far as especially autoimmune</p>
<p>like rheumatoid and</p>
<p>even some other types of arthritis</p>
<p>problems so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>stay tuned for that video i&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um reveal this interesting fascinating</p>
<p>theory that i think is the real reason</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>um people feel better with their joints</p>
<p>especially with autoimmune</p>
<p>when they take bone broth</p>
<p>very good okay so</p>
<p>this question stressed me out just</p>
<p>reading it can stress cause cancer i</p>
<p>immediately started doing some deep</p>
<p>breathing exercises just in case</p>
<p>audience what do you think does stress</p>
<p>cause</p>
<p>cancer we want to know and by the way</p>
<p>speaking of</p>
<p>videos</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got janie that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>coming on with us and she uh said can i</p>
<p>ask uh dr berg about maybe doing a video</p>
<p>and i said he insists on stuff he really</p>
<p>loves that so in addition to your one</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>uh janie we&rsquo;re going to also have you</p>
<p>ask dr berg about a video that he may</p>
<p>produce for you okay you&rsquo;re uh oh hang</p>
<p>on just a second let&rsquo;s see you janie are</p>
<p>on the air with dr berg</p>
<p>yeah she just has to unmute oh yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re muted dear</p>
<p>there we go</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>thank you so much for all the research</p>
<p>you do for all of us we really</p>
<p>appreciate it because you&rsquo;re now my</p>
<p>go-to with any health concern i type in</p>
<p>dr berg and whatever the issue and</p>
<p>i watch what you have to say</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve been doing healthy keto</p>
<p>intermittent fasting for about a year</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve lost 20 pounds</p>
<p>uh kind of stabilized despite doing the</p>
<p>um omad and couple days and things my</p>
<p>homa ir is 2.0 which seems okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably come down because i think it</p>
<p>was more resistant</p>
<p>but i had a dna test done</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>had a kmo factor</p>
<p>and it says</p>
<p>that numerous studies suggest that brain</p>
<p>kyna is a biologic marker of</p>
<p>neuroinflammation as kyna production is</p>
<p>increased in animals on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>this type of diet may not be optimum for</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>now they probably didn&rsquo;t test it on a</p>
<p>healthy keto so i don&rsquo;t really know what</p>
<p>that means but i&rsquo;m wondering if that</p>
<p>relates to any of the struggles i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>because my blood ketones won&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>go above 0.3</p>
<p>i lose my appetite enough to do the</p>
<p>longer fast but then i&rsquo;m not losing</p>
<p>weight so i get mixed</p>
<p>messages on what my body&rsquo;s doing and i</p>
<p>still get tired after salads and</p>
<p>vegetables etc</p>
<p>so so um so that when you read up about</p>
<p>that genetic</p>
<p>or whatever it is did you do they say</p>
<p>what diet to go on like a high carb high</p>
<p>carb diet</p>
<p>no which obviously isn&rsquo;t going to be</p>
<p>helpful either but so i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t really know what to make of</p>
<p>that so i kind of ignored it but then i</p>
<p>started thinking well maybe there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>connection with why i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>doing as well with it</p>
<p>so so okay so the main would you say the</p>
<p>main symptom it would be fatigue</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>fatigue and weight is stabilized like 20</p>
<p>pounds isn&rsquo;t that much and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have that much more that i need</p>
<p>to lose but i&rsquo;m thinking over the last</p>
<p>six months why can i not seem to break</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>plateau but but yeah i feel better if i</p>
<p>like if i go on a</p>
<p>trip and go off for a bit and then come</p>
<p>back i actually feel more energy all day</p>
<p>on carbs and i&rsquo;m like this isn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not supposed to feel good when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>eating poorly but i when i&rsquo;m doing it i</p>
<p>do the lemon juice and electrolytes in</p>
<p>the morning you know i take a full lemon</p>
<p>off the tree</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing i do about a teaspoon of salt</p>
<p>and i need a lot of electrolytes i need</p>
<p>extra iron</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i need extra uh iodine and</p>
<p>i just can&rsquo;t seem to feel right</p>
<p>though i&rsquo;m you know bragging about how</p>
<p>wonderful this is and people say how</p>
<p>much have you lost oh 20 pounds</p>
<p>got it</p>
<p>well i think um</p>
<p>there a lot of times these things are</p>
<p>connected</p>
<p>um because you really you really want to</p>
<p>figure out why would someone be tired so</p>
<p>then the question i have would be sleep</p>
<p>do you have</p>
<p>quality sleep do you feel refreshed when</p>
<p>you go to sleep</p>
<p>i do well with sleep</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and what about your stress level</p>
<p>how has that been</p>
<p>recently i&rsquo;m mostly retired i still</p>
<p>substitute here and there but i feel</p>
<p>pretty good so and i did get the lemon</p>
<p>balm tea thinking of the cortisol</p>
<p>because i may have a cortisol issue even</p>
<p>if i don&rsquo;t feel stressed and</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so so this is kind of another mystery</p>
<p>when you deal with like this mystery</p>
<p>thing here to evaluate we just need more</p>
<p>and more data to see</p>
<p>what what&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re missing here i&rsquo;ll just give</p>
<p>you an example of things that are kind</p>
<p>of rolling through my mind um</p>
<p>what what is your age</p>
<ol start="64">
<li>yeah so you&rsquo;re past menopause</li>
</ol>
<p>one thing with women that are past</p>
<p>menopause um sometimes</p>
<p>they um</p>
<p>start to develop in iron toxicity</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll just give you an example</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve had some other people on</p>
<p>keto and</p>
<p>they stopped menstruating so now the</p>
<p>thing about iron it tends to accumulate</p>
<p>in the body and it can create fatigue</p>
<p>for sure</p>
<p>and um it could be that</p>
<p>little thing on the side that kind of</p>
<p>just keeps you from having the full</p>
<p>benefits and this is why even people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing oh i&rsquo;m eating i&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>uh grass-fed your red meat and then</p>
<p>and you find out the iron is just way</p>
<p>too high so</p>
<p>in this case um i think a good thing to</p>
<p>do would be to find a functional</p>
<p>a nutritional</p>
<p>doc that checks the functional medicine</p>
<p>that they can do</p>
<p>a deep dive on a bunch of blood tests to</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>look across the board of just anything</p>
<p>that kind of jumps out and gives us a</p>
<p>clue on</p>
<p>what is going on because</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i agree with this</p>
<p>genetic thing</p>
<p>so we have that right right and then</p>
<p>with the weight problem i do know this</p>
<p>with a lot of especially women that are</p>
<p>doing this they hit this plateau and</p>
<p>they just can&rsquo;t seem to get below it and</p>
<p>so then what i do is i tell them to do a</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>just do a three-day fast okay good and</p>
<p>then they</p>
<p>they uh sometimes they need a a</p>
<p>prolonged fasting to kick things in gear</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>then all of a sudden things start</p>
<p>working better and better doing longer</p>
<p>fast</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um because the fasting will clear up</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>that are weird things too that</p>
<p>like your mood will come up energy</p>
<p>should come up you start recycling old</p>
<p>proteins you start to</p>
<p>lose weight that you couldn&rsquo;t have lost</p>
<p>before because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re literally</p>
<p>your body is just running on your fat so</p>
<p>you may need something like that um</p>
<p>so these are just kind of thoughts that</p>
<p>are running through my head right now</p>
<p>okay because yeah my iron is actually</p>
<p>low but that like if it&rsquo;s okay good so</p>
<p>then then we don&rsquo;t worry about that um</p>
<p>but i did have a vitamin d receptor</p>
<p>issue with several genes and an</p>
<p>interleukin-6 receptor and estrogen</p>
<p>receptor one i don&rsquo;t know what all this</p>
<p>means</p>
<p>okay so so this is uh this is another</p>
<p>thing too like vitamin d uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>someone else that had a problem with the</p>
<p>vitamin d receptor there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>mutation there</p>
<p>and um you take the normal vitamin d or</p>
<p>even uh 10 000 i use it didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything for her she had to take 40 to</p>
<p>50 000 iu&rsquo;s vitamin d with some purified</p>
<p>bile salts at the same time to start</p>
<p>feeling better um</p>
<p>that could be another um another thing</p>
<p>that uh to test out until you figure</p>
<p>this out but uh yeah um</p>
<p>yeah interesting</p>
<p>and if i um i have several questions</p>
<p>that could be videos is there a place to</p>
<p>send those ideas</p>
<p>like how how to interpret houma ir</p>
<p>results and things like that</p>
<p>yeah you can send it to dr berg at dr</p>
<p>berg.com and just say attention dr berg</p>
<p>and then um they they will send it to me</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>thank you so much appreciate all of you</p>
<p>no problem and my cousin my co my</p>
<p>niece&rsquo;s husband who&rsquo;s a pizza chef in</p>
<p>italy loves keto and has had great</p>
<p>results and he said to tell you ciao</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s fantastic ciao</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well thanks so much uh</p>
<p>janie uh and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s see if we</p>
<p>can oh well first of all let me get the</p>
<p>answer this question can stress um</p>
<p>stephen before i forget i want to just</p>
<p>mention one thing about this pizza in</p>
<p>italy um so many people um</p>
<p>go literally and they eat the pizza and</p>
<p>like wow</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m uploading i&rsquo;m looking around the</p>
<p>room and everyone&rsquo;s eating a whole pizza</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re they don&rsquo;t seem to be</p>
<p>bloating and and in america you eat</p>
<p>pizza and you blow what&rsquo;s going on well</p>
<p>it relates to</p>
<p>uh the fermentation time</p>
<p>in other cultures uh especially in italy</p>
<p>compared to america they they ferment</p>
<p>this dough for</p>
<p>two days maybe even three days in</p>
<p>america we ferment it for a an hour</p>
<p>and that fermentation breaks down gluten</p>
<p>this is why like sourdough bread you</p>
<p>have a lot less gluten and you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the bloating because</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s the gluten that just tears up</p>
<p>the colon so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the big factor that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people feel you know better</p>
<p>on certain type of</p>
<p>grains in other parts of the country</p>
<p>because they ferment longer</p>
<p>so remember that steve</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll keep that in mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing well speaking of cancer</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>say that it&rsquo;s true and one percent</p>
<p>uh says uh that it&rsquo;s not true he must be</p>
<p>or she must be very relaxed</p>
<p>and so on so uh doc oh hang on i better</p>
<p>bring that question up there it is</p>
<p>audience and thank you for responding so</p>
<p>quick doc what&rsquo;s the answer</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some interesting interesting</p>
<p>interesting data on this cancer puzzle i</p>
<p>just did an interview with someone i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to post this video in um a couple</p>
<p>days</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s a guy who had stage three</p>
<p>cancer it was actually borderline stage</p>
<p>four colorectal cancer</p>
<p>um and he um</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>was the peak of his health he ate great</p>
<p>he did intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and in 2020</p>
<p>he came down with this cancer right</p>
<p>blood in the stool and</p>
<p>it grew to be 10 centimeters</p>
<p>okay so</p>
<p>um anyway</p>
<p>how the heck did he get cancer his diet</p>
<p>was great</p>
<p>well it runs in his family his dad had</p>
<p>cancer and died his i think his brother</p>
<p>had cancer and died</p>
<p>um and so here he has this cancer</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>he did</p>
<p>the fasting that we recommended</p>
<p>and he ate</p>
<p>what we recommended based on some other</p>
<p>videos that we did with another guy who</p>
<p>had stage four</p>
<p>and guess what within four months he has</p>
<p>no more cancer right</p>
<p>but my question was</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>just before you started noticing these</p>
<p>symptoms that you had cancer</p>
<p>and i said did you go through any stress</p>
<p>and he said yes</p>
<p>with covid</p>
<p>all of my um</p>
<p>my businesses just shut down because he</p>
<p>taught karate so he had these different</p>
<p>places around</p>
<p>the united states i think that</p>
<p>that completely shut down so he had</p>
<p>financial stress he had relationship</p>
<p>stress</p>
<p>and that stress activated</p>
<p>through an epigenetic kick in these this</p>
<p>genetic factor and bam</p>
<p>got the cancer</p>
<p>so i think stress can activate</p>
<p>um certain genes that then can cause</p>
<p>cancer for sure</p>
<p>but the good news is that when you watch</p>
<p>this video</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to give people hope that you</p>
<p>can do something about it if you come</p>
<p>down with cancer</p>
<p>and this is the second interview with</p>
<p>someone that had</p>
<p>advanced cancer and they wanted to do</p>
<p>all these things to them and uh he</p>
<p>decided to go in a different route</p>
<p>with great success four months a 10 cm</p>
<p>centimeter</p>
<p>tumor in the colon</p>
<p>disappearing uh i think that should get</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s attention and they should</p>
<p>watch this video</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>my goodness well if you&rsquo;ll excuse me dr</p>
<p>burke i&rsquo;m doing deep slow breaths to try</p>
<p>to reduce stress this has just got me</p>
<p>horrified hey i&rsquo;m going to try to get</p>
<p>allison</p>
<p>if she can hear us</p>
<p>uh in with us and allison if you can</p>
<p>hear us uh you&rsquo;re on with dr berg</p>
<p>i still still i see the mute button</p>
<p>there i mean the the um yeah her mute</p>
<p>button is</p>
<p>is on yeah oh dear allison well she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to be able to hear us</p>
<p>either and allison i&rsquo;m going to invite</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>uh to come on next week maybe you can</p>
<p>send us an email or send us your</p>
<p>questions so</p>
<p>anyway dr berg we are fighting against</p>
<p>the clock i would like you to mention to</p>
<p>our audience how the international</p>
<p>audience how they can get your products</p>
<p>uh with less worry and less money</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m always always trying to find</p>
<p>better ways to do this cut the shipping</p>
<p>expense because that&rsquo;s always a problem</p>
<p>especially with the diesel fuel expense</p>
<p>recently so um if you go to um the links</p>
<p>down below if you&rsquo;re in a different</p>
<p>country</p>
<p>we do now have</p>
<p>places where you can get the products um</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to have them shipped</p>
<p>from america so i&rsquo;m working on that all</p>
<p>the time and uh that might help you but</p>
<p>you know we have other uh channels steve</p>
<p>we have uh not just the english channel</p>
<p>we have</p>
<p>the arabic channel we have the russian</p>
<p>channel we have um</p>
<p>uh a channel in uh french</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s germany uh taiwanese</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and i think there&rsquo;s a total of um eight</p>
<p>different languages</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s uh in fact the arabic</p>
<p>channel has close to 5 million</p>
<p>subscribers already that&rsquo;s incredible so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people all over the</p>
<p>world that are watching this and this is</p>
<p>really exciting because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working and people are trying these</p>
<p>remedies and spreading the word</p>
<p>and um this is just awesome so</p>
<p>when you find remedies that work for</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>unfortunately um what i&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>is trying to</p>
<p>go against the grain and give people</p>
<p>solutions to health problems that you</p>
<p>may not find when you do your searches</p>
<p>and i have the advantage of being</p>
<p>practiced for 30 years</p>
<p>and working with actual people and</p>
<p>testing things out constantly doing</p>
<p>research and trying to make it simple so</p>
<p>you can actually</p>
<p>you know one thing i hate too with</p>
<p>videos with it um</p>
<p>they just it&rsquo;s like it takes 45 minutes</p>
<p>to get to the point</p>
<p>so i try to get to the point as fast as</p>
<p>i can</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t like these long-winded</p>
<p>videos like i&rsquo;m doing right now so</p>
<p>anyway on that note have a wonderful</p>
<p>weekend we will see you next week stay</p>
<p>tuned for some fascinating videos</p>
<p>and have a wonderful weekend</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
