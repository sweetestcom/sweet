    <p>The following is a conversation with Gustav Sorenstrom.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the chief research and development officer at Spotify,</p>
<p>leading their product design, data technology and engineering teams.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, in my research and in life in general,</p>
<p>I love music, listening to it and creating it.</p>
<p>And using technology, especially personalization through machine learning,</p>
<p>to enrich the music discovery and listening experience.</p>
<p>That is what Spotify has been doing for years, continually innovating,</p>
<p>defining how we experience music as a society in the digital age.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Gustav and I talk about, among many other topics,</p>
<p>including our shared appreciation of the movie True Romance,</p>
<p>in my view, one of the great movies of all time.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on iTunes,</p>

<p>spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Gustav Sorenstrom.</p>
<p>Spotify has over 50 million songs in its catalog.</p>
<p>So let me ask the all important question.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re the right person to ask.</p>
<p>What is the definitive greatest song of all time?</p>
<p>It varies for me, personally.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t speak definitively for everyone?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t believe very much in machine learning if I did, right?</p>
<p>Because everyone had the same taste.</p>
<p>So for you, what is&hellip; you have to pick. What is the song?</p>
<p>All right, so it&rsquo;s pretty easy for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this song called You&rsquo;re So Cool, Hans Zimmer, a soundtrack to True Romance.</p>
<p>It was a movie that made a big impression on me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of been following me through my life.</p>
<p>I actually had it play at my wedding.</p>
<p>I sat with the organist and helped him play it on an organ,</p>
<p>which was a pretty interesting experience.</p>
<p>That is probably my, I would say, top three movie of all time.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is an incredible movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it came out during my formative years.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve discovered in music, you shape your music taste during those years.</p>
<p>So it definitely affected me quite a bit.</p>
<p>Did it affect you in any other kind of way?</p>
<p>Well, the movie itself affected me back then.</p>
<p>It was a big part of culture.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really adopt any characters from the movie,</p>
<p>but it was a great story of love, fantastic actors.</p>
<p>And really, I didn&rsquo;t even know who Hans Zimmer was at the time, but fantastic music.</p>
<p>And so that song has followed me.</p>
<p>And the movie actually has followed me throughout my life.</p>
<p>That was Quentin Tarantino, actually, I think, director or producer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not Stairway to Heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody.</p>
<p>Those are great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not my personal favorites, but I&rsquo;ve realized that people have different tastes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big part of what we do.</p>
<p>Well, for me, I would have to stick with Stairway to Heaven.</p>
<p>So 35,000 years ago, I looked this up on Wikipedia,</p>
<p>flute like instruments started being used in caves as part of hunting rituals.</p>
<p>And primitive cultural gatherings, things like that.</p>
<p>This is the birth of music.</p>
<p>Since then, we had a few folks, Beethoven, Elvis, Beatles, Justin Bieber, of course, Drake.</p>
<p>So in your view, let&rsquo;s start like high level philosophical.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of music on this planet of ours?</p>
<p>I think music has many different purposes.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s certainly a big purpose, which is the same as much of entertainment,</p>
<p>which is escapism and to be able to live in some sort of other mental state for a while.</p>
<p>But I also think you have the opposite of escaping,</p>
<p>which is to help you focus on something you are actually doing.</p>
<p>Because I think people use music as a tool to tune the brain</p>
<p>to the activities that they are actually doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like, in one sense, maybe it&rsquo;s the rawest signal.</p>
<p>If you think about the brain as neural networks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s maybe the most efficient hack we can do to actually actively tune it</p>
<p>into some state that you want to be.</p>
<p>You can do it in other ways.</p>
<p>You can tell stories to put people in a certain mood.</p>
<p>But music is probably very effective to get you to a certain mood very fast, I think.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a social component historically to music,</p>
<p>where people listen to music together.</p>
<p>I was just thinking about this, that to me, and you mentioned machine learning,</p>
<p>but to me personally, music is a really private thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking for myself, I listen to music,</p>
<p>like almost nobody knows the kind of things I have in my library,</p>
<p>except people who are really close to me and they really only know a certain percentage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like some weird stuff that I&rsquo;m almost probably embarrassed by, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the guilty pleasures, right?</p>
<p>Everyone has the guilty pleasures, yeah.</p>
<p>Hopefully they&rsquo;re not too bad, but for me, it&rsquo;s personal.</p>
<p>Do you think of music as something that&rsquo;s social or as something that&rsquo;s personal?</p>
<p>Or does it vary?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s the same answer that you use it for both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve thought a lot about this during these 10 years at Spotify, obviously.</p>
<p>In one sense, as you said, music is incredibly</p>
<p>social, you go to concerts and so forth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is your escape and everyone has these things that are very personal to them.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ve found is that when it comes to, most people claim that they have a friend or two</p>
<p>that they are heavily inspired by and that they listen to.</p>
<p>So I actually think music is very social, but in a smaller group setting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an intimate form of, it&rsquo;s an intimate relationship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that you necessarily share broadly.</p>
<p>Now, at concerts, you can argue you do, but then you&rsquo;ve gathered a lot of people</p>
<p>that you have something in common with.</p>
<p>I think this broadcast sharing of music is something we tried on social networks and so forth.</p>
<p>But it turns out that people aren&rsquo;t super interested in sharing their music.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t super interested in what their friends listen to.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interested in understanding if they have something in common perhaps with a friend,</p>
<p>but not just as information.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I was just thinking of it this morning, listening to Spotify.</p>
<p>I really have a pretty intimate relationship with Spotify, with my playlists, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had them for many years now and they&rsquo;ve grown with me together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intimate relationship you have with a library of music that you&rsquo;ve developed.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about different ways we can play with that.</p>
<p>Can you do the impossible task and try to give a history of music listening</p>
<p>from your perspective from before the internet and after the internet</p>
<p>and just kind of everything leading up to streaming with Spotify and so on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>It could be a 100 year podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to do a brief version.</p>
<p>There are some things that I think are very interesting during the history of music,</p>
<p>which is that before recorded music, to be able to enjoy music,</p>
<p>you actually had to be where the music was produced</p>
<p>because you couldn&rsquo;t record it and time shift it, right?</p>
<p>Creation and consumption had to happen at the same time, basically concerts.</p>
<p>And so you either had to get to the nearest village to listen to music.</p>
<p>And while that was cumbersome and it severely limited the distribution of music,</p>
<p>it also had some different qualities,</p>
<p>which was that the creator could always interact with the audience.</p>
<p>It was always live.</p>
<p>And also there was no time cap on the music.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that these early classical works,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much longer than the three minutes.</p>
<p>The three minutes came in as a restriction of the first wax disc that could only contain</p>
<p>a three minute song on one side, right?</p>
<p>So actually the recorded music severely limited or put constraints.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say limit.</p>
<p>I mean, constraints are often good,</p>
<p>but it put very hard constraints on the music format.</p>
<p>So you kind of said, instead of doing this opus on many tens of minutes or something,</p>
<p>now you get three and a half minutes because then you&rsquo;re out of wax on this disc.</p>
<p>But in return, you get an amazing distribution.</p>
<p>Your reach will widen, right?</p>
<p>Just on that point real quick.</p>
<p>Without the mass scale distribution, there&rsquo;s a scarcity component</p>
<p>where you kind of look forward to it.</p>
<p>We had that, it&rsquo;s like the Netflix versus HBO Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>You like wait for the event because you can&rsquo;t really listen to it.</p>
<p>So you like look forward to it and then it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you derive perhaps more pleasure because it&rsquo;s more rare for you to listen to a particular piece.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s value to that scarcity?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that that is definitely a thing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always this component of if you have something in infinite amounts,</p>
<p>will you value it as much?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Humanity is always seeking some, it&rsquo;s relative.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re always seeking something you didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And when you have it, you don&rsquo;t appreciate it as much.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>But I think that that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s why concerts exist.</p>
<p>So you can actually have both.</p>
<p>But I think net, if you couldn&rsquo;t listen to music in your car driving, that&rsquo;d be worse.</p>
<p>That cost will be bigger than the benefit of the anticipation I think that you would have.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it started with live concerts.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s being able to, you know, the phonograph invented, right?</p>
<p>That you start to be able to record music.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So then you got this massive distribution that made it possible to create two things.</p>
<p>I think, first of all, cultural phenomenons, they probably need distribution to be able to happen.</p>
<p>But it also opened access to, you know, for a new kind of artist.</p>
<p>So you started to have these phenomenons like Beatles and Elvis and so forth.</p>
<p>That would really, a function of distribution, I think, obviously of talent and innovation.</p>
<p>But there was also technical component.</p>
<p>And of course, the next big innovation to come along was radio.</p>
<p>Broadcast radio.</p>
<p>And I think radio is interesting because it started not as a music medium.</p>
<p>It started as an information medium for news.</p>
<p>And then radio needed to find something to fill the time with so that they could honestly</p>
<p>play more ads and make more money.</p>
<p>And music was free.</p>
<p>So then you had this massive distribution where you could program to people.</p>
<p>I think those things, that ecosystem, is what created the ability for hits.</p>
<p>But it was also a very broadcast medium.</p>
<p>So you would tend to get these massive, massive hits, but maybe not such a long tail.</p>
<p>In terms of choice of everybody listens to the same stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And as you said, I think there are some social benefits to that.</p>
<p>I think, for example, there&rsquo;s a high statistical chance that if I talk about the latest episode</p>
<p>of Game of Thrones, we have something to talk about, just statistically.</p>
<p>In the age of individual choice, maybe some of that goes away.</p>
<p>So I do see the value of shared cultural components, but I also obviously love personalization.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s catch this up to the internet.</p>
<p>So maybe Napster, well, first of all, there&rsquo;s MP3s, tapes, CDs.</p>
<p>There was a digitalization of music with a CD, really.</p>
<p>It was physical distribution, but the music became digital.</p>
<p>And so they were files, but basically boxed software, to use a software analogy.</p>
<p>And then you could start downloading these files.</p>
<p>And I think there are two interesting things that happened.</p>
<p>Back to music used to be longer before it was constrained by the distribution medium.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that was a coincidence.</p>
<p>And then really the only music genre to have developed mostly after music was a file again</p>
<p>on the internet is EDM.</p>
<p>And EDM is often much longer than the traditional music.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to think about the fact that music is no longer constrained in</p>
<p>minutes per song or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a legacy of an old distribution technology.</p>
<p>And you see some of this new music that breaks the format.</p>
<p>Not so much as I would have expected actually by now, but it still happens.</p>
<p>So first of all, I don&rsquo;t really know what EDM is.</p>
<p>Electronic dance music.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You could say Avicii.</p>
<p>Avicii was one of the biggest in this genre.</p>
<p>So the main constraint is of time.</p>
<p>Something like a three, four, five minute song.</p>
<p>So you could have songs that were eight minutes, 10 minutes and so forth.</p>
<p>Because it started as a digital product that you downloaded.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t have this constraint anymore.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s something really interesting that I don&rsquo;t think has fully happened yet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of jumping ahead a little bit to where we are, but I think there&rsquo;s tons of format</p>
<p>innovation in music that should happen now, that couldn&rsquo;t happen when you needed to really</p>
<p>adhere to the distribution constraints.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t adhere to that, you would get no distribution.</p>
<p>So Bj√∂rk, for example, the Icelandic artist, she made a full iPad app as an album.</p>
<p>That was very expensive.</p>
<p>Even though the app store has great distribution, she gets nowhere near the distribution versus</p>
<p>staying within the three minute format.</p>
<p>So I think now that music is fully digital inside these streaming services, there is</p>
<p>the opportunity to change the format again and allow creators to be much more creative</p>
<p>without limiting their distribution ability.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting that you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising that we don&rsquo;t see that taken advantage more often.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the constraints of the distribution from the 50s and 60s have molded the culture</p>
<p>to where we want the five, three to five minute song than anything else, not just.</p>
<p>So we want the song as consumers and as artists, because I write a lot of music and I never</p>
<p>even thought about writing something longer than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting that those constraints.</p>
<p>Because all your training data has been three and a half minute songs, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Okay, so yes, digitization of data led to then mp3s.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think you had this file then that was distributed physically, but then you had</p>
<p>the components of digital distribution and then the internet happened and there was this</p>
<p>vacuum where you had a format that could be digitally shipped, but there was no business</p>
<p>model.</p>
<p>And then all these pirate networks happened, Napster and in Pirate Island.</p>
<p>Napster and in Sweden Pirate Bay, which was one of the biggest.</p>
<p>And I think from a consumer point of view, which kind of leads up to the inception of</p>
<p>Spotify, from a consumer point of view, consumers for the first time had this access model to</p>
<p>music where they could, without kind of any marginal cost, they could try different tracks.</p>
<p>You could use music in new ways.</p>
<p>There was no marginal cost.</p>
<p>And that was a fantastic consumer experience to have access to all the music ever made,</p>
<p>I think was fantastic.</p>
<p>But it was also horrible for artists because there was no business model around it.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t make any money.</p>
<p>So the user need almost drove the user interface before there was a business model.</p>
<p>And then there were these download stores that allowed you to download files, which</p>
<p>was a solution, but it didn&rsquo;t solve the access problem.</p>
<p>There was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to try one more track.</p>
<p>And I think that that heavily limits how you listen to music.</p>
<p>The example I always give is, you know, in Spotify, a huge amount of people listen to</p>
<p>music while they sleep, while they go to sleep and while they sleep.</p>
<p>If that costed you 99 cents per three minutes, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And you would be much less adventurous if there was a real dollar cost to exploring</p>
<p>music.</p>
<p>So the access model is interesting in that it changes your music behavior.</p>
<p>You can be, you can take much more risk because there&rsquo;s no marginal cost to it.</p>
<p>Maybe let me linger on piracy for a second, because I find, especially coming from Russia,</p>
<p>piracy is something that&rsquo;s very interesting to me.</p>
<p>Not me, of course, ever, but I have friends who have partook in piracy of music, software,</p>
<p>TV shows, sporting events.</p>
<p>And usually to me, what that shows is not that they&rsquo;re, they can actually pay the money</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not trying to save money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re choosing the best experience.</p>
<p>So what to me, piracy shows is a business opportunity in all these domains.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Spotify stepped in is basically piracy was an experience.</p>
<p>You can explore with fine music you like, and actually the interface of piracy is horrible</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s bad metadata, long download times, all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>And what Spotify does is basically first rewards artists and second makes the experience of</p>
<p>exploring music much better.</p>
<p>I mean, the same is true, I think for movies and so on.</p>
<p>That piracy reveals in the software space, for example, I&rsquo;m a huge user and fan of Adobe</p>
<p>products and there was much more incentive to pirate Adobe products before they went</p>
<p>to a monthly subscription plan.</p>
<p>And now all of the said friends that used to pirate Adobe products that I know now actually</p>
<p>pay gladly for the monthly subscription.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a sign of an opportunity for product development.</p>
<p>And that sometimes there&rsquo;s a product market fit before there&rsquo;s a business model fit in</p>
<p>product development.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a sign of it.</p>
<p>In Sweden, I think it was a bit of both.</p>
<p>There was a culture where we even had a political party called the Pirate Party.</p>
<p>And this was during the time when people said that information should be free.</p>
<p>It was somehow wrong to charge for ones and zeros.</p>
<p>So I think people felt that artists should probably make some money somehow else and</p>
<p>concerts or something.</p>
<p>So at least in Sweden, it was part really social acceptance, even at the political level.</p>
<p>But that also forced Spotify to compete with free, which I don&rsquo;t think would actually</p>
<p>could have happened anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>The music industry needed to be doing bad enough to take that risk.</p>
<p>And Sweden was like the perfect testing ground.</p>
<p>It had government funded high bandwidth, low latency broadband, which meant that the product</p>
<p>would work.</p>
<p>And it was also there was no music revenue anyway.</p>
<p>So they were kind of like, I don&rsquo;t think this is going to work, but why not?</p>
<p>So this product is one that I don&rsquo;t think could have happened in America, the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>largest music market, for example.</p>
<p>So how do you compete with free?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s an interesting world of the internet where most people don&rsquo;t like to</p>
<p>pay for things.</p>
<p>So Spotify steps in and tries to, yes, compete with free.</p>
<p>How do you do it?</p>
<p>So I think two things.</p>
<p>One is people are starting to pay for things on the internet.</p>
<p>I think one way to think about it was that advertising was the first business model because</p>
<p>no one would put a credit card on the internet.</p>
<p>Transactional with Amazon was the second.</p>
<p>And maybe subscription is the third.</p>
<p>And if you look offline, subscription is the biggest of those.</p>
<p>So that may still happen.</p>
<p>I think people are starting to pay for things.</p>
<p>But definitely back then, we needed to compete with free.</p>
<p>And the first thing you need to do is obviously to lower the price to free and then you need</p>
<p>to be better somehow.</p>
<p>And the way that Spotify was better was on the user experience, on the actual performance,</p>
<p>the latency of, you know, even if you had high bandwidth broadband, it would still take</p>
<p>you 30 seconds to a minute to download one of these tracks.</p>
<p>So the Spotify experience of starting within the perceptual limit of immediacy, about 250</p>
<p>milliseconds, meant that the whole trick was it felt as if you had downloaded all of Pirate</p>
<p>Bay.</p>
<p>It was on your hard drive.</p>
<p>It was that fast, even though it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it was still free.</p>
<p>But somehow you were actually still being a legal citizen.</p>
<p>And that was the trick that Spotify managed to pull off.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve actually heard you say this or write this.</p>
<p>And I was surprised that I wasn&rsquo;t aware of it because I just took it for granted.</p>
<p>You know, whenever an awesome thing comes along, you&rsquo;re just like, of course, it has</p>
<p>to be this way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>That it felt like the entire world&rsquo;s libraries at my fingertips because of that latency being</p>
<p>reduced.</p>
<p>What was the technical challenge in reducing the latency?</p>
<p>So there was a group of really, really talented engineers, one of them called Ludwig Strigius.</p>
<p>He wrote the, actually from Gothenburg, he wrote the initial, the uTorrent client, which</p>
<p>is kind of an interesting backstory to Spotify, that we have one of the top developers from</p>
<p>uTorrent clients as well.</p>
<p>So he wrote uTorrent, the world&rsquo;s smallest uTorrent client.</p>
<p>And then he was acquired very early by Daniel and Martin, who founded Spotify, and they</p>
<p>actually sold the uTorrent client to BitTorrent, but kept Ludwig.</p>
<p>So Spotify had a lot of experience within peer to peer networking.</p>
<p>So the original innovation was a distribution innovation, where Spotify built an end to</p>
<p>end media distribution system up until only a few years ago, we actually hosted all the</p>
<p>music ourselves.</p>
<p>So we had both the service side and the client, and that meant that we could do things such</p>
<p>as having a peer to peer solution to use local caching on the client side, because back then</p>
<p>the world was mostly desktop.</p>
<p>But we could also do things like hack the TCP protocols, things like Nagel&rsquo;s algorithm</p>
<p>for kind of exponential back off, or ramp up and just go full throttle and optimize</p>
<p>for latency at the cost of bandwidth.</p>
<p>And all of this end to end control meant that we could do an experience that felt like a</p>
<p>step change.</p>
<p>These days, we actually are on GCP, we don&rsquo;t host our own stuff, and everyone is really</p>
<p>fast these days.</p>
<p>So that was the initial competitive advantage.</p>
<p>But then obviously, you have to move on over time.</p>
<p>And that was over 10 years ago, right?</p>
<p>That was in 2008.</p>
<p>The product was launched in Sweden.</p>
<p>It was in a beta, I think, 2007.</p>
<p>And it was on the desktop, right?</p>
<p>It was desktop only.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no phone.</p>
<p>There was no phone.</p>
<p>The iPhone came out in 2008.</p>
<p>But the App Store came out one year later, I think.</p>
<p>So the writing was on the wall, but there was no phone yet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that people would use Spotify to discover the songs they like, and then</p>
<p>they would torrent those songs to so they can copy it to their phone.</p>
<p>Just hilarious.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Not torrent, pirate.</p>
<p>Seriously, piracy does seem to be like a good guide for business models.</p>
<p>Video content.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Spotify doesn&rsquo;t have video content.</p>
<p>Well, we do have music videos, and we do have videos on the service.</p>
<p>But the way we think about ourselves is that we&rsquo;re an audio service, and we think that</p>
<p>if you look at the amount of time that people spend on audio, it&rsquo;s actually very similar</p>
<p>to the amount of time that people spend on music.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very similar to the amount of time that people spend on video.</p>
<p>So the opportunity should be equally big.</p>
<p>But today, it&rsquo;s not at all valued.</p>
<p>Videos value much higher.</p>
<p>So we think it&rsquo;s basically completely undervalued.</p>
<p>So we think of ourselves as an audio service.</p>
<p>But within that audio service, I think video can make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I think when you&rsquo;re discovering an artist, you probably do want to see them and understand</p>
<p>who they are, to understand their identity.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t see that video every time.</p>
<p>90% of the time, the phone is going to be in your pocket.</p>
<p>For podcasters, you use video.</p>
<p>I think that can make a ton of sense.</p>
<p>So we do have video, but we&rsquo;re an audio service where, think of it as we call it internally,</p>
<p>backgroundable video.</p>
<p>Video that is helpful, but isn&rsquo;t the driver of the narrative.</p>
<p>I think also, if we look at YouTube, there&rsquo;s quite a few folks who listen to music on YouTube.</p>
<p>So in some sense, YouTube is a bit of a competitor to Spotify, which is very strange to me that</p>
<p>people use YouTube to listen to music.</p>
<p>They play essentially the music videos, right?</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t watch the videos and put it in their pocket.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s similar to what, strangely, maybe it&rsquo;s similar to what we were for the</p>
<p>piracy networks, where YouTube, for historical reasons, have a lot of music videos.</p>
<p>So people use YouTube for a lot of the discovery part of the process, I think.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s not a really good sort of, quote unquote, MP3 player, because it doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>background.</p>
<p>Then you have to keep the app in the foreground.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a good consumption tool, but it&rsquo;s a decently good discovery.</p>
<p>I mean, I think YouTube is a fantastic product.</p>
<p>And I use it for all kinds of purposes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>If I were to admit something, I do use YouTube a little bit to assist in the discovery process</p>
<p>of songs.</p>
<p>And then if I like it, I&rsquo;ll add it to Spotify.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s OK with us.</p>
<p>OK, so sorry, we&rsquo;re jumping around a little bit.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>You look at Napster, you look at the early days of Spotify.</p>
<p>One fascinating point is how do you grow a user base?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re there in Sweden.</p>
<p>You have an idea.</p>
<p>I saw the initial sketches that look terrible.</p>
<p>How do you grow a user base from a few folks to millions?</p>
<p>I think there are a bunch of tactical answers.</p>
<p>So first of all, I think you need a great product.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you take a bad product and market it to be successful.</p>
<p>So you need a great product.</p>
<p>But sorry to interrupt, but it&rsquo;s a totally new way to listen to music, too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just did people realize immediately that Spotify is a great product?</p>
<p>No, I think they did.</p>
<p>So back to the point of piracy, it was a totally new way to listen to music legally.</p>
<p>But people had been used to the access model in Sweden</p>
<p>and the rest of the world for a long time through piracy.</p>
<p>So one way to think about Spotify, it was just legal and fast piracy.</p>
<p>And so people have been using it for a long time.</p>
<p>So they weren&rsquo;t alien to it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t really understand how it could be illegal</p>
<p>because it seemed too fast and too good to be true,</p>
<p>which I think is a great product proposition if you can be too good to be true.</p>
<p>But what I saw again and again was people showing each other,</p>
<p>clicking the song, showing how fast it started and say, can you believe this?</p>
<p>So I really think it was about speed.</p>
<p>Then we also had an invite program that was really meant for scaling</p>
<p>because we hosted our own service.</p>
<p>We needed to control scaling.</p>
<p>But that built a lot of expectation.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to say hype because hype implies that it wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Excitement around the product. And we&rsquo;ve replicated that when we launched in the US.</p>
<p>We also built up an invite only program first.</p>
<p>There are lots of tactics, but I think you need a great product to solve some problem.</p>
<p>And basically the key innovation, there was technology,</p>
<p>but on a meta level, the innovation was really the access model versus the ownership model.</p>
<p>And that was tricky.</p>
<p>A lot of people said that they wanted to be able to do it.</p>
<p>I mean, they wanted to own their music.</p>
<p>They would never kind of rent it or borrow it.</p>
<p>But I think the fact that we had a free tier,</p>
<p>which meant that you get to keep this music for life as well, helped quite a lot.</p>
<p>So this is an interesting psychological point that maybe you can speak to.</p>
<p>It was a big shift for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like I had to go to therapy for this.</p>
<p>I think I would describe my early listening experience,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of my friends do, as basically hoarding music.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re like slowly, one song by one song,</p>
<p>or maybe albums, gathering a collection of music that you love.</p>
<p>And you own it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like often, especially with CDs or tape, you like physically had it.</p>
<p>And what Spotify, what I had to come to grips with,</p>
<p>it was kind of liberating actually, is to throw away all the music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this therapy session with lots of people.</p>
<p>And I think the mental trick is, so actually we&rsquo;ve seen the user data.</p>
<p>When Spotify started, a lot of people did the exact same thing.</p>
<p>They started hoarding as if the music would disappear.</p>
<p>Almost the equivalent of downloading.</p>
<p>And so we had these playlists that had limits of like a few hundred thousand tracks.</p>
<p>We figured no one will ever.</p>
<p>Well, they do.</p>
<p>Nuts and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tracks.</p>
<p>And to this day, some people want to actually save, quote unquote,</p>
<p>and then play the entire catalog.</p>
<p>But I think the therapy session goes something like instead of throwing away your music,</p>
<p>if you took your files and you stored them in the locker at Google,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be a streaming service.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that in that locker, you have all the world&rsquo;s music now for free.</p>
<p>So instead of giving away your music, you got all the music.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>You could think of it as having a copy of the world&rsquo;s catalog there forever.</p>
<p>So you actually got more music instead of less.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that you just took that hard disk and you sent it to someone who stored it for you.</p>
<p>And once you go through that mental journey, I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s still my files.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just over there.</p>
<p>And I just have 40 million or 50 million or something now.</p>
<p>Then people are like, OK, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>The problem is, I think, because you paid us a subscription,</p>
<p>if we hadn&rsquo;t had the free tier where you would feel like,</p>
<p>even if I don&rsquo;t want to pay anymore, I still get to keep them.</p>
<p>You keep your playlist forever.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t disappear even though you stop paying.</p>
<p>I think that was really important.</p>
<p>If we would have started as, you know, you can put in all this time,</p>
<p>but if you stop paying, you lose all your work.</p>
<p>I think that would have been a big challenge and was the big challenge for a lot of our competitors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another reason why I think the free tier is really important.</p>
<p>That people need to feel the security, that the work they put in,</p>
<p>it will never disappear, even if they decide not to pay.</p>
<p>I like how you put the work you put in.</p>
<p>I actually stopped even thinking of it that way.</p>
<p>I just actually Spotify taught me to just enjoy music as opposed to.</p>
<p>As opposed to what I was doing before, which is like in an unhealthy way, hoarding music.</p>
<p>Which I found that because I was doing that,</p>
<p>I was listening to a small selection of songs way too much to where I was getting sick of them.</p>
<p>Whereas Spotify, the more liberating kind of approach is I was just enjoying.</p>
<p>Of course, I listened to Stairway to Heaven over and over,</p>
<p>but because of the extra variety, I don&rsquo;t get as sick of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting statistic I saw.</p>
<p>So Spotify has, maybe you can correct me, but over 50 million songs, tracks,</p>
<p>and over 3 billion playlists.</p>
<p>So 50 million songs and 3 billion playlists.</p>
<p>60 times more playlist songs.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the way I think about it is that from a statistician or machine learning point of view,</p>
<p>you have all these, if you want to think about reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>you have this state space of all the tracks.</p>
<p>You can take different journeys through this world.</p>
<p>I think of these as people helping themselves and each other,</p>
<p>creating interesting vectors through this space of tracks.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not so surprising that across many tens of millions of atomic units,</p>
<p>there will be billions of paths that make sense.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re probably pretty quite far away from having found all of them.</p>
<p>So kind of our job now is users, when Spotify started,</p>
<p>it was really a search box that was for the time pretty powerful.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d like to refer to it as this programming language called playlisting,</p>
<p>where if you, as you probably were pretty good at music,</p>
<p>you knew your new releases, you knew your back catalog,</p>
<p>you knew your star with the heaven,</p>
<p>you could create a soundtrack for yourself using this playlisting tool,</p>
<p>this like meta programming language for music to soundtrack your life.</p>
<p>And people who were good at music, it&rsquo;s back to how do you scale the product.</p>
<p>For people who are good at music, that wasn&rsquo;t actually enough.</p>
<p>If you had the catalog and a good search tool,</p>
<p>and you can create your own sessions,</p>
<p>you could create really good a soundtrack for your entire life.</p>
<p>Probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself.</p>
<p>But the problem was most people, many people aren&rsquo;t that good at music.</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t spend the time.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re very good at music, it&rsquo;s going to be hard to keep up.</p>
<p>So what we did to try to scale this was to essentially try to build,</p>
<p>you can think of them as agents that this friend that some people had</p>
<p>that helped them navigate this music catalog.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do for you.</p>
<p>But also there is something like 200 million active users.</p>
<p>1 million active users on Spotify.</p>
<p>So there it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So from the machine learning perspective,</p>
<p>you have these 200 million people plus they&rsquo;re creating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to think of a playlist as,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you meant it that way,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like a programming language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s or at least a trace of exploration of those individual agents.</p>
<p>The listeners and you have all this new tracks coming in.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a fascinating space that is ripe for machine learning.</p>
<p>So is there, is it possible, how can playlists be used as data</p>
<p>in terms of machine learning and to help Spotify organize the music?</p>
<p>So we found in our data, not surprising that people who play listed lots</p>
<p>they retain much better.</p>
<p>They had a great experience.</p>
<p>And so our first attempt was to playlist for users.</p>
<p>And so we acquired this company called Tunigo of editors and professional playlisters</p>
<p>and kind of leveraged the maximum of human intelligence</p>
<p>to help build kind of these vectors through the track space for people.</p>
<p>And that broadened the product.</p>
<p>But then the obvious next, and we use statistical means,</p>
<p>where they could see when they created a playlist, how did that playlist perform?</p>
<p>They could see skips of the songs, they could see how the songs perform,</p>
<p>and they manually iterated the playlist to maximize performance for a large group of people.</p>
<p>But there were never enough editors to playlists for you personally.</p>
<p>So the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of group personalization</p>
<p>using editors and tools and statistics to individualization.</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s so interesting about the 3 billion playlists we have is we ended,</p>
<p>the truth is we lucked out.</p>
<p>This was not a priority strategy, as is often the case.</p>
<p>It looks really smart in hindsight, but it was dumb luck.</p>
<p>We looked at these playlists and we had some people in the company,</p>
<p>a person named Eric Beranodson.</p>
<p>He was really good at machine learning already back then in like 2007, 2008.</p>
<p>Back then it was mostly collaborative filtering and so forth.</p>
<p>But we realized that what this is, is people are grouping tracks for themselves</p>
<p>that have some semantic meaning to them.</p>
<p>And then they actually label it with a playlist name as well.</p>
<p>So in a sense, people were grouping tracks along semantic dimensions and labeling them.</p>
<p>And so could you use that information to find that latent embedding?</p>
<p>And so we started playing around with collaborative filtering</p>
<p>and we saw tremendous success with it.</p>
<p>Basically trying to extract some of these dimensions.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, it&rsquo;s not surprising at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be quite surprising if playlists were actually random,</p>
<p>if they had no semantic meaning.</p>
<p>For most people, they group these tracks for some reason.</p>
<p>So we just happened across this incredible data set.</p>
<p>Where people are taking these tens of millions of tracks</p>
<p>and group them along different semantic vectors.</p>
<p>And the semantics being outside the individual users.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s some kind of universal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a universal embedding that holds across people on this earth.</p>
<p>Yes, I do think that the embeddings you find are going to be reflective of the people who play listed.</p>
<p>So if you have a lot of indie lovers who play list,</p>
<p>your embedding is going to perform better there.</p>
<p>But what we found was that yes, there were these latent similarities.</p>
<p>They were very powerful.</p>
<p>And it was interesting because I think that the people who play listed the most initially</p>
<p>were the so called music aficionados who were really into music.</p>
<p>And they often had a certain&hellip;</p>
<p>Their taste was often geared towards a certain type of music.</p>
<p>And so what surprised us, if you look at the problem from the outside,</p>
<p>you might expect that the algorithms would start performing best with mainstreamers first.</p>
<p>Because it somehow feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream taste</p>
<p>than really particular taste.</p>
<p>It was the complete opposite for us.</p>
<p>The recommendations performed fantastically for people who saw themselves as</p>
<p>having very unique taste.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably because all of them play listed.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t perform so well for mainstreamers.</p>
<p>They actually thought they were a bit too particular and unorthodox.</p>
<p>So we had the complete opposite of what we expected.</p>
<p>Success within the hardest problem first,</p>
<p>and then had to try to scale to more mainstream recommendations.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve also acquired Echo Nest that analyzes song data.</p>
<p>So in your view, maybe you can talk about,</p>
<p>so what kind of data is there from a machine learning perspective?</p>
<p>From a machine learning perspective, there&rsquo;s a huge amount.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about playlisting and just user data of what people are listening to,</p>
<p>the playlist they&rsquo;re constructing, and so on.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the actual data within a song.</p>
<p>What makes a song, I don&rsquo;t know, the actual waveforms.</p>
<p>How do you mix the two?</p>
<p>How much value is there in each?</p>
<p>To me, it seems like user data is a romantic notion</p>
<p>that the song itself would contain useful information.</p>
<p>But if I were to guess, user data would be much more powerful,</p>
<p>like playlists would be much more powerful.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we use both.</p>
<p>Our biggest success initially was with playlist data</p>
<p>without understanding anything about the structure of the song.</p>
<p>But when we acquired Echo Nest, they had the inverse problem.</p>
<p>They actually didn&rsquo;t have any play data.</p>
<p>They were just, they were a provider of recommendations,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t actually have any play data.</p>
<p>So they looked at the structure of songs, sonically,</p>
<p>and they looked at Wikipedia for cultural references and so forth, right?</p>
<p>And did a lot of NLU and so forth.</p>
<p>So we got that skill into the company and combined kind of our user data</p>
<p>with their kind of content based.</p>
<p>So you can think of it as we were user based</p>
<p>and they were content based in their recommendations.</p>
<p>And we combined those two.</p>
<p>And for some cases where you have a new song that has no play data,</p>
<p>obviously you have to try to go by either who the artist is</p>
<p>or the sonic information in the song or what it&rsquo;s similar to.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely a value in both and we do a lot in both,</p>
<p>but I would say, yes, the user data captures things</p>
<p>that have to do with culture in the greater society</p>
<p>that you would never see in the content itself.</p>
<p>But that said, we have seen, we have a research lab in Paris</p>
<p>when we can talk more about that on machine learning on the creator side,</p>
<p>what it can do for creators, not just for the consumers,</p>
<p>but where we looked at how does the structure of a song</p>
<p>actually affect the listening behavior?</p>
<p>And it turns out that there is a lot of,</p>
<p>we can predict things like skips based on the song itself.</p>
<p>We could say that maybe you should move that chorus a bit</p>
<p>because your skip is going to go up here.</p>
<p>There is a lot of latent structure in the music,</p>
<p>which is not surprising because it is some sort of mind hack.</p>
<p>So there should be structure. That&rsquo;s probably what we respond to.</p>
<p>You just blew my mind actually from the creator perspective.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really interesting topic</p>
<p>that probably most creators aren&rsquo;t taking advantage of, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve recently got to interact with a few folks,</p>
<p>YouTubers who are like obsessed with this idea of what do I do</p>
<p>to make sure people keep watching the video?</p>
<p>And they like look at the analytics of which point do people turn it off and so on.</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s healthy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because you can do it a little too much.</p>
<p>But it is a really powerful tool for helping the creative process.</p>
<p>You just made me realize you could do the same thing for creation of music.</p>
<p>And so is that something you&rsquo;ve looked into?</p>
<p>And can you speak to how much opportunity there is for that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I listened to the podcast with Ziraj and I thought it was fantastic</p>
<p>and I reacted to the same thing where he said he posted something in the morning,</p>
<p>immediately watched the feedback where the drop off was</p>
<p>and then responded to that in the afternoon,</p>
<p>which is quite different from how people make podcasts, for example.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, the feedback loop is almost non existent.</p>
<p>So if we back out one level, I think actually both for music and podcasts,</p>
<p>which we also do at Spotify,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a tremendous opportunity just for the creation workflow.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really interesting speaking to you who,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a musician, a developer, and a podcaster.</p>
<p>If you think about those three different roles,</p>
<p>if you make the leap as a musician,</p>
<p>if you think about it as a software tool chain, really,</p>
<p>your DAW with the stems, that&rsquo;s the IDE, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you work in source code format with what you&rsquo;re creating.</p>
<p>Then you sit around and you play with that.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re happy, you compile that thing into some sort of AAC or MP3 or something.</p>
<p>You do that because you get distribution.</p>
<p>There are so many runtimes for that MP3 across the world in car stairs and stuff.</p>
<p>So if you kind of compile this execution,</p>
<p>you ship it out in kind of an old fashioned boxed software analogy.</p>
<p>And then you hope for the best, right?</p>
<p>But as a software developer, you would never do that.</p>
<p>First, you go on GitHub and you collaborate with other creators.</p>
<p>And then you think it&rsquo;d be crazy to just ship one version of your software</p>
<p>without doing an A B test, without any feedback loop.</p>
<p>Issue tracking.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you would look at the feedback loop and say,</p>
<p>try to optimize that thing, right?</p>
<p>So I think if you think of it as a very specific software tool chain,</p>
<p>it looks quite arcane, the tools that a music creator has</p>
<p>versus what a software developer has.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how we think about it.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t a music creator have something like GitHub</p>
<p>where you could collaborate much more easily?</p>
<p>So we bought this company called Soundtrap,</p>
<p>which has a kind of Google Docs for music approach, where you can collaborate</p>
<p>with other people on the kind of source code format with Stems.</p>
<p>And I think introducing things like AI tools there to help you</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re creating music, both in helping you put accompaniment to your music,</p>
<p>like drums or something, help you master and mix automatically,</p>
<p>help you understand how this track will perform.</p>
<p>Exactly what you would expect as a software developer.</p>
<p>I think it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And I think the same goes for a podcaster.</p>
<p>I think podcasters will expect to have the same kind of feedback loop</p>
<p>that Siraj has, like, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not healthy, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry, I wanted to criticize the fact because you can overdo it</p>
<p>because a lot of the, and we&rsquo;re in a new era of that.</p>
<p>So you can become addicted to it and therefore, what people say,</p>
<p>you become a slave to the YouTube algorithm or sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always a danger of a new technology as opposed to say,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re creating a song, becoming too obsessed about the intro riff to the song</p>
<p>that keeps people listening versus actually the entirety of the creation process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>But the fact that there&rsquo;s zero, I mean, you&rsquo;re blowing my mind right now,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re completely right that there is no signal whatsoever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no feedback whatsoever on the creation process and music or podcasting,</p>
<p>almost at all.</p>
<p>And are you saying that Spotify is hoping to help create tools to, not tools, but&hellip;</p>
<p>No, tools actually.</p>
<p>Actually, tools.</p>
<p>Tools for creators.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve made some acquisitions the last few years around music creation,</p>
<p>this company called Soundtrap, which is a digital audio workstation,</p>
<p>but that is browser based.</p>
<p>And their focus was really the Google Docs approach.</p>
<p>We can collaborate with people much more easily than you could in previous tools.</p>
<p>So we have some of these tools that we&rsquo;re working with that we want to make accessible</p>
<p>and then we can connect it with our consumption data.</p>
<p>We can create this feedback loop where we could help you understand,</p>
<p>we could help you create and help you understand how you will perform.</p>
<p>We also acquired this other company within podcasting called Anchor,</p>
<p>which is one of the biggest podcasting tools, mobile focused.</p>
<p>So really focused on simple creation or easy access to creation.</p>
<p>But that also gives us this feedback loop.</p>
<p>And even before that, we invested in something called Spotify for Artists</p>
<p>and Spotify for Podcasters, which is an app that you can download,</p>
<p>you can verify that you are that creator.</p>
<p>And then you get things that software developers have had for years.</p>
<p>You can see where, if you look at your podcast, for example, on Spotify</p>
<p>or a song that you released, you can see how it&rsquo;s performing,</p>
<p>which cities it&rsquo;s performing in, who&rsquo;s listening to it,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the demographic breakup.</p>
<p>So similar in the sense that you can understand</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re actually doing on the platform.</p>
<p>So we definitely want to build tools.</p>
<p>I think you also interviewed the head of research for Adobe.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an, back to Photoshop that you like,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an interesting analogy as well.</p>
<p>Photoshop, I think, has been very innovative in helping photographers and artists.</p>
<p>And I think there should be the same kind of tools for music creators,</p>
<p>where you could get AI assistance, for example, as you&rsquo;re creating music,</p>
<p>as you can do with Adobe, where you can,</p>
<p>I want a sky over here and you can get help creating that sky.</p>
<p>The really fascinating thing is what Adobe doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>is a distribution for the content you create.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have the data of if I create, if I, you know,</p>
<p>whatever creation I make in Photoshop or Premiere,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get like immediate feedback like I can on YouTube,</p>
<p>for example, about the way people are responding.</p>
<p>And if Spotify is creating those tools, that&rsquo;s a really exciting actually world.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk a little about podcasts.</p>
<p>So I have trouble talking to one person.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit terrifying and kind of hard to fathom,</p>
<p>but on average, 60 to 100,000 people will listen to this episode.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s intimidating.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s intimidating.</p>
<p>So I hosted on Blueberry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m pronouncing that correctly, actually.</p>
<p>It looks like most people listen to it on Apple Podcasts,</p>
<p>Cast Box and Pocket Casts, and only about a thousand listen on Spotify.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just my podcast, right?</p>
<p>So where do you see a time when Spotify will dominate this?</p>
<p>So Spotify is relatively new into this podcasting site.</p>
<p>Yeah, in podcasting.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the deal with podcasting and Spotify?</p>
<p>How serious is Spotify about podcasting?</p>
<p>Do you see a time where everybody would listen to, you know,</p>
<p>probably a huge amount of people, majority perhaps listen to music on Spotify?</p>
<p>Do you see a time when the same is true for podcasting?</p>
<p>Well, I certainly hope so.</p>
<p>That is our mission.</p>
<p>Our mission as a company is actually to enable a million creators to live off of their art,</p>
<p>and a billion people be inspired by it.</p>
<p>And what I think is interesting about that mission is it actually puts the creators first,</p>
<p>even though it started as a consumer focused company,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just to be able to live off of their art,</p>
<p>not just make some money off of their art as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s quite an ambitious project.</p>
<p>So we think about creators of all kinds,</p>
<p>and we kind of expanded our mission from being music to being audio a while back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not so much because we think we made that decision.</p>
<p>We think that decision was made for us.</p>
<p>We think the world made that decision.</p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, when you put in your headphones,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to make a choice between music and a new episode of your podcast or something else.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in that world whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how radio works.</p>
<p>So we decided that we think it&rsquo;s about audio.</p>
<p>You can see the rise of audiobooks and so forth.</p>
<p>We think audio is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>So we decided to enter it.</p>
<p>And obviously, Apple and Apple Podcasts is absolutely dominating in podcasting,</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t have a single podcast only like two years ago.</p>
<p>What we did though was we looked at this and said,</p>
<p>can we bring something to this?</p>
<p>We want to do this, but back to the original Spotify,</p>
<p>we have to do something that consumers actually value to be able to do this.</p>
<p>And the reason we&rsquo;ve gone from not existing at all to being quite a wide margin,</p>
<p>the second largest podcast consumption, still wide gap to iTunes, but we&rsquo;re growing quite fast.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because when we looked at the consumer problem,</p>
<p>people said surprisingly that they wanted their podcasts and music in the same application.</p>
<p>So what we did was we took a little bit of a different approach where we said,</p>
<p>instead of building a separate podcast app,</p>
<p>we thought, is there a consumer problem to solve here?</p>
<p>Because the others are very successful already.</p>
<p>And we thought there was in making a more seamless experience</p>
<p>where you can have your podcast and your music in the same application,</p>
<p>because we think it&rsquo;s audio to you.</p>
<p>And that has been successful.</p>
<p>And that meant that we actually had 200 million people to offer this to instead of starting from zero.</p>
<p>So I think we have a good chance because we&rsquo;re taking a different approach than the competition.</p>
<p>And back to the other thing I mentioned about</p>
<p>creators, because we&rsquo;re looking at the end to end flow.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of innovation to do around podcast as a format.</p>
<p>When we have creation tools and consumption, I think we could start improving what podcasting is.</p>
<p>I mean, podcast is this opaque, big, like one, two hour file that you&rsquo;re streaming,</p>
<p>which it really doesn&rsquo;t make that much sense in 2019 that it&rsquo;s not interactive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no feedback loops, nothing like that.</p>
<p>So I think if we&rsquo;re going to win, it&rsquo;s going to have to be because we build a better product</p>
<p>for creators and for consumers.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see, but it&rsquo;s certainly our goal.</p>
<p>We have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Well, the creators part is really exciting.</p>
<p>You already, you got me hooked there.</p>
<p>Cause the only stats I have,</p>
<p>Blueberry just recently added the stats of whether it&rsquo;s listened to the end or not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a huge improvement, but that&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>nowhere to where you could possibly go in terms of statistics.</p>
<p>You just download the Spotify podcasters up and verify.</p>
<p>And then, then you&rsquo;ll know where people dropped out in this episode.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The moment I started talking.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I might be depressed by this, but okay.</p>
<p>So one, um, one other question is the original Spotify for music.</p>
<p>And I have a question about podcasting in this line is the idea of podcasting</p>
<p>about podcasting in this line is the idea of albums.</p>
<p>I have, uh, what did you, uh, music aficionados, uh, friends who are really,</p>
<p>uh, big fans of music often, uh, really enjoy albums,</p>
<p>listening to entire albums of, of an artist.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I feel like Spotify has helped</p>
<p>replace the idea of an album with playlists.</p>
<p>So you create your own albums.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of the way, at least I&rsquo;ve experienced music</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed it that way.</p>
<p>One of the things that was missing in podcasting for me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an open question for me, but the way I listened to podcasts is</p>
<p>the way I would listen to albums.</p>
<p>So I take a Joe Rogan experience and that&rsquo;s an album.</p>
<p>And I listened, you know, I like, I, I put that on and I listened one</p>
<p>episode after the next, then there&rsquo;s a sequence and so on.</p>
<p>Is there a room for doing what you did for music or doing what</p>
<p>Spotify did for music, but, uh, creating playlists, sort of, uh,</p>
<p>this kind of playlisting idea of breaking apart from podcasting,</p>
<p>uh, from individual podcasts and creating kind of, uh, this interplay</p>
<p>or, or have you thought about that space?</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So I think in, um, in music, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Basically you bought an album.</p>
<p>So it was like, you bought a small catalog of like 10 tracks, right?</p>
<p>It was, it was, again, it was actually a lot of, a lot of consumption.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s about what you like, but it&rsquo;s based on the business model.</p>
<p>So you paid for this 10 track service and then you listened to that for a while.</p>
<p>And then when, when everything was flat priced, you tended to listen differently.</p>
<p>Now, so, so I think the, I think the album is still tremendously important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have it and you can save albums and so forth.</p>
<p>And you have a huge amount of people who really listen according to albums.</p>
<p>And I like that because it is a creator format, you can tell a longer story</p>
<p>over several tracks.</p>
<p>And so some people listen to just one track.</p>
<p>Some people actually want to hear that whole story.</p>
<p>Now in podcast, I think, I think it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>You can argue that podcasts might be more like shows on Netflix.</p>
<p>Have like a full season of Narcos and you&rsquo;re probably not going to do like</p>
<p>one episode of Narcos and then one of House of Cards, like, like, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a narrative there.</p>
<p>And you, you, you love the cast and you love these characters.</p>
<p>So I think people will, people love shows.</p>
<p>And I think they will, they will listen to those shows.</p>
<p>I do think you follow a bunch of shows at the same time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certainly an opportunity to bring you the latest episode of, you</p>
<p>know, whatever the five, six, 10 things that, that you&rsquo;re into.</p>
<p>But, but I think, I think people are going to listen to specific hosts and love</p>
<p>those hosts for a long time.</p>
<p>Because I think there&rsquo;s something different with podcasts where, um, this</p>
<p>format of the, the, the, the, the, the experience of the, of the audience is</p>
<p>actually sitting here right between us.</p>
<p>Whereas if you look at something on TV, the audio actually would come from, you</p>
<p>would sit over there and the audio would come to you from both of us as if you</p>
<p>were watching, not as you were part of the conversation.</p>
<p>So my experience is having listened to podcasts like yours and Joe Rogan is, I</p>
<p>feel like I know all of these people.</p>
<p>They, they have a lot of experience.</p>
<p>I know all of these people, they have no idea who I am, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>listened to so many hours of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different from me watching a, watching like a TV show or an interview.</p>
<p>So I think you, you kind of, um, fall in love with people and, um, experience</p>
<p>in a, in a different way.</p>
<p>So I think, I think shows and hosts are going to be very, uh, very important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to go away into some sort of thing where, where you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know who you&rsquo;re listening to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>What I do think is I think there&rsquo;s a tremendous discovery opportunity in</p>
<p>podcast because the catalog is growing quite quickly.</p>
<p>And I think podcast is only a few, like five, 600,000 shows right now.</p>
<p>If you look back to YouTube as another analogy of creators, no one really knows</p>
<p>if you would lift the lid on YouTube, but it&rsquo;s probably billions of episodes.</p>
<p>And so I think the podcast catalog would probably grow tremendously because the</p>
<p>creation tools are getting easier.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going to have this discovery opportunity that I think is</p>
<p>really big.</p>
<p>So, so a lot of people tell me that they love their shows, but discovering</p>
<p>podcasts kind of suck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to get into new show.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually quite long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big time investment.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s plenty of opportunity in the discovery part.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>A hundred percent in, in even the dumbest, there&rsquo;s so many low hanging fruit too.</p>
<p>Uh, for example, just knowing what episode to listen to first to try out a podcast.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Uh, because most podcasts don&rsquo;t have an order to them.</p>
<p>Uh, they, they can be listened to out of order and sorry to say some are better</p>
<p>than others episodes.</p>
<p>So some episodes of Joe Rogan are better than others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice to know, uh, which you should listen to, to try it out.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, uh, as far as I know, almost no information, uh, in terms of like, uh,</p>
<p>upvotes on how good an episode is.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So I think part of the problem is, uh, you, it&rsquo;s kind of like music.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one answer.</p>
<p>People use music for different things and there&rsquo;s actually many different types of music.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s workout music and there&rsquo;s classical piano music and focus music and,</p>
<p>and, and, uh, so forth.</p>
<p>I think the same with podcasts.</p>
<p>Some podcasts are sequential.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to be listened to in, in order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s actually telling a narrative.</p>
<p>Some podcasts are one topic, uh, kind of like yours, but different guests.</p>
<p>So you could jump in anywhere.</p>
<p>Some podcasts actually have completely different topics.</p>
<p>And for those podcasts, it might be that I want, you know, we should recommend one episode</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s about AI from someone, but then they talk about something that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>interested in the rest of the episodes.</p>
<p>So I think our, what we&rsquo;re spending a lot of time on now is just first understanding</p>
<p>the domain and creating kind of the knowledge graph of how do these objects relate and how</p>
<p>do people consume.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s going to be, it&rsquo;s going to be different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited because you&rsquo;re the, uh, Spotify is the first people I&rsquo;m aware of that are</p>
<p>trying to do this for podcasting.</p>
<p>Podcasting has been like a wild west up until now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a very, we want to be very careful though, because it&rsquo;s been a very good wild</p>
<p>west, I think it&rsquo;s this fragile ecosystem.</p>
<p>And I, we want to make sure that you don&rsquo;t barge in and say like, Oh, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>internetize this thing.</p>
<p>And you have to think about the creators.</p>
<p>You have to understand how they get distribution today, who listens to how they make money</p>
<p>today, try to, you know, make sure that their business model works, that they understand.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s back to doing something to improving their products, like feedback loops and</p>
<p>distribution.</p>
<p>So jumping back into terms of this fascinating world of a recommender system and listening</p>
<p>to music and using machine learning to analyze things, do you think it&rsquo;s better to what</p>
<p>currently, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but currently Spotify lets people pick what they listen</p>
<p>to the most part.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a discovery process, but you kind of organize playlists.</p>
<p>Is it better to let people pick what they listen to or recommend what they should listen</p>
<p>to something like stations by Spotify that I saw that you&rsquo;re playing around with?</p>
<p>Maybe you can tell me what&rsquo;s the status of that.</p>
<p>This is a Pandora style app that just kind of, as opposed to you select the music you</p>
<p>listen to, it kind of feeds you the music you listen to.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the status of stations by Spotify?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s its future?</p>
<p>The story of Spotify, as we have grown, has been that we made it more accessible to different</p>
<p>audiences and stations is another one of those where the question is, some people want to</p>
<p>be very specific.</p>
<p>They actually want to hear Starway to Heaven right now, that needs to be very easy to do.</p>
<p>And some people, or even the same person, at some point might say, I want to feel upbeat</p>
<p>or I want to feel happy or I want songs to sing in the car.</p>
<p>So they put in the information at a very different level and then we need to translate that into</p>
<p>what that means musically.</p>
<p>So stations is a test to create like a consumption input vector that is much simpler where you</p>
<p>can just tune it a little bit and see if that increases the overall reach.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re trying to kind of serve the entire gamut of super advanced so called music aficionados</p>
<p>all the way to people who they love listening to music but it&rsquo;s not their number one priority</p>
<p>in life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to sit and follow every new release from every new artist.</p>
<p>They need to be able to influence music at a different level.</p>
<p>So you can think of it as different products and I think one of the interesting things</p>
<p>to answer your question on if it&rsquo;s better to let the user choose or to play, I think</p>
<p>the answer is the challenge when machine learning kind of came along, there was a lot of thinking</p>
<p>about what does product development mean in a machine learning context.</p>
<p>People like Andrew Ng, for example, when he went to Baidu, he started doing a lot of practical</p>
<p>machine learning, went from academia and he thought a lot about this and he had this notion</p>
<p>that a product manager, designer and engineer, they used to work around this wireframe to</p>
<p>kind of describe what the product should look like.</p>
<p>It was something to talk about when you&rsquo;re doing a chatbot or a playlist, what are you</p>
<p>going to say?</p>
<p>It should be good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good product description.</p>
<p>So how do you do that?</p>
<p>And he came up with this notion that the test set is the new wireframe.</p>
<p>The job of the product manager is to source a good test set that is representative of</p>
<p>what, like if you say I want to play this, that is songs to sing in the car.</p>
<p>The job of the product manager is to go and source a good test set of what that means.</p>
<p>So then you can work with engineering to have algorithms to try to produce that.</p>
<p>So we try to think a lot about how to structure product development for a machine learning</p>
<p>age.</p>
<p>And what we discovered was that a lot of it is actually in the expectation.</p>
<p>And you can go two ways.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that if you set the expectation with the user that this is a discovery product,</p>
<p>like Discover Weekly, you&rsquo;re actually setting the expectation that most of what we show</p>
<p>you will not be relevant.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in the discovery process, you&rsquo;re going to accept that actually if you find</p>
<p>one gem every Monday that you totally love, you&rsquo;re probably going to be happy.</p>
<p>Even though the statistical meaning, one out of 10 is terrible or one out of 20 is terrible</p>
<p>from a user point of view because the setting was discovery is fine.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt real quick.</p>
<p>I just actually learned about Discover Weekly, which is a Spotify, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>feature of Spotify that shows you cool songs to listen to.</p>
<p>Maybe I can do issue tracking.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find it on my Spotify app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in your library.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the library.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the list of library.</p>
<p>Because I was like, whoa, this is cool.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this existed.</p>
<p>And I tried to find it.</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>I will show it to you and feedback to our product team.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>But yeah, so yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>Just to mention the expectation there is basically that you&rsquo;re going to discover new songs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So then you can be quite adventurous in the recommendations you do.</p>
<p>But we have another product called Daily Mix, which kind of implies that these are only</p>
<p>going to be your favorites.</p>
<p>So if you have one out of 10 that is good and nine out of 10 that doesn&rsquo;t work for you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to think it&rsquo;s a horrible product.</p>
<p>So actually a lot of the product development we learned over the years is about setting</p>
<p>the right expectations.</p>
<p>So for Daily Mix, you know, algorithmically, we would pick among things that feel very</p>
<p>safe in your taste space.</p>
<p>Whereas Discover Weekly, we go kind of wild because the expectation is most of this is</p>
<p>not going to.</p>
<p>So a lot of that, a lot of to answer your question there, a lot of should you let the</p>
<p>user pick or not?</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>We have some products where the whole point is that the user can click play, put the phone</p>
<p>in the pocket, and it should be really good music for like an hour.</p>
<p>We have other products where you probably need to say like, no, no, save, no, no.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very interactive.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>And then the radio product, the stations product is one of these like click play, put in your</p>
<p>pocket for hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking of different test sets for different users and trying to create products</p>
<p>that sort of optimize for those test sets that represent a specific set of users.</p>
<p>Yes, I think one thing that I think is interesting is we invested quite heavily in editorial</p>
<p>in people creating playlists using statistical data.</p>
<p>And that was successful for us.</p>
<p>And then we also invested in machine learning.</p>
<p>And for the longest time within Spotify and within the rest of the industry, there was</p>
<p>always this narrative of humans versus the machine, algo versus editorial.</p>
<p>And editors would say like, well, if I had that data, if I could see your</p>
<p>playlisting history and I made a choice for you, I would have made a better choice.</p>
<p>And they would have because they&rsquo;re much smarter than these algorithms.</p>
<p>The human is incredibly smart compared to our algorithms.</p>
<p>They can take culture into account and so forth.</p>
<p>The problem is that they can&rsquo;t make 200 million decisions per hour for every user that logs</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>So the algo may be not as sophisticated, but much more efficient.</p>
<p>So there was this contradiction.</p>
<p>But then a few years ago, we started focusing on this kind of human in the loop thinking</p>
<p>around machine learning.</p>
<p>And we actually coined an internal term for it called algotorial, a combination of algorithms</p>
<p>and editors, where if we take a concrete example, you think of the editor, this paid</p>
<p>expert that we have that&rsquo;s really good at something like soul, hip hop, EDM, something,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a true expert, no one in the industry.</p>
<p>So they have all the cultural knowledge.</p>
<p>You think of them as the product manager.</p>
<p>And you say that, let&rsquo;s say that you want to create a, you think that there&rsquo;s a product</p>
<p>need in the world for something like songs to sing in the car or songs to sing in the</p>
<p>shower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking that example because it exists.</p>
<p>People love to scream songs in the car when they drive, right?</p>
<p>So you want to create that product and you have this product manager who&rsquo;s a musical</p>
<p>expert.</p>
<p>They create, they come up with a concept, like I think this is a missing thing in humanity,</p>
<p>like a playlist called songs to sing in the car.</p>
<p>They create the framing, the image, the title, and they create a test set of, they create</p>
<p>a group of songs, like a few thousand songs out of the catalog that they manually curate</p>
<p>that are known songs that are great to sing in the car.</p>
<p>And they can take like true romance into account.</p>
<p>They understand things that our algorithms do not at all.</p>
<p>So they have this huge set of tracks.</p>
<p>Then when we deliver that to you, we look at your taste vectors and you get the 20 tracks</p>
<p>that are songs to sing in the car in your taste.</p>
<p>So you have personalization and editorial input in the same process, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, it makes total sense.</p>
<p>And I have several questions around that.</p>
<p>This is like fascinating.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So first, it is a little bit surprising to me that the world expert humans are outperforming</p>
<p>machines at specifying songs to sing in the car.</p>
<p>So maybe you could talk to that a little bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can put it into words, but what is it?</p>
<p>How difficult is this problem?</p>
<p>Do you really, I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to ask is there, how difficult is it to encode</p>
<p>the cultural references, the context of the song, the artists, all those things together?</p>
<p>Can machine learning really not do that?</p>
<p>I mean, I think machine learning is great at replicating patterns if you have the patterns.</p>
<p>But if you try to write with me a spec of what song&rsquo;s greatest song to sing in the car</p>
<p>definition is, is it loud?</p>
<p>Does it have many choruses?</p>
<p>Should it have been in movies?</p>
<p>It quickly gets incredibly complicated, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And a lot of it may not be in the structure of the song or the title.</p>
<p>It could be cultural references because, you know, it was a history.</p>
<p>So the definition problems quickly get, and I think that was the insight of Andrew Ng</p>
<p>when he said the job of the product manager is to understand these things that algorithms</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t and then define what that looks like.</p>
<p>And then you have something to train towards, right?</p>
<p>Then you have kind of the test set.</p>
<p>And then so today the editors create this pool of tracks and then we personalize.</p>
<p>You could easily imagine that once you have this set, you could have some automatic exploration</p>
<p>on the rest of the catalog because then you understand what it is.</p>
<p>And then the other side of it, when machine learning does help is this taste vector.</p>
<p>How hard is it to construct a vector that represents the things an individual human</p>
<p>likes, this human preference?</p>
<p>So you can, you know, music isn&rsquo;t like, it&rsquo;s not like Amazon, like things you usually buy.</p>
<p>Music seems more amorphous.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s this thing that&rsquo;s hard to specify.</p>
<p>Like what is, you know, if you look at my playlist, what is the music that I love?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder.</p>
<p>It seems to be much more difficult to specify concretely.</p>
<p>So how hard is it to build a taste vector?</p>
<p>It is very hard in the sense that you need a lot of data.</p>
<p>And I think what we found was that, so it&rsquo;s not a stationary problem.</p>
<p>It changes over time.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve gone through the journey of, if you&rsquo;ve done a lot of computer vision,</p>
<p>obviously I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of computer vision in my past.</p>
<p>And we started kind of with the handcrafted heuristics for, you know, this is kind of</p>
<p>indie music.</p>
<p>This is this.</p>
<p>And if you consume this, you&rsquo;d probably like this.</p>
<p>So we have, we started there and we have some of that still.</p>
<p>Then what was interesting about the playlist data was that you could find these latent</p>
<p>things that wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily even make sense to you.</p>
<p>That could even capture maybe cultural references because they cooccurred.</p>
<p>Things that wouldn&rsquo;t have appeared kind of mechanistically either in the content or so</p>
<p>forth.</p>
<p>So I think that, I think the core assumption is that there are patterns in almost</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>And if there are patterns, these embedding techniques are getting better and better now.</p>
<p>Now, as everyone else, we&rsquo;re also using kind of deep embeddings where you can encode</p>
<p>binary values and so forth.</p>
<p>And what I think is interesting is this process to try to find things that do not</p>
<p>necessarily, you wouldn&rsquo;t actually have guessed.</p>
<p>So it is very hard in an engineering sense to find the right dimensions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible scalability problem to do for hundreds of millions of users and to</p>
<p>update it every day.</p>
<p>But in theory, in theory embeddings isn&rsquo;t that complicated.</p>
<p>The fact that you try to find some principal components or something like that, dimensionality</p>
<p>reduction and so forth.</p>
<p>So the theory, I guess, is easy.</p>
<p>The practice is very, very hard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a huge engineering challenge.</p>
<p>But fortunately, we have some amazing both research and engineering teams in this space.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess the question is all, I mean, it&rsquo;s similar.</p>
<p>I deal with it with autonomous vehicle spaces.</p>
<p>The question is how hard is driving?</p>
<p>And here is basically the question is of edge cases.</p>
<p>So embedding probably works, not probably, but I would imagine works well in a lot of</p>
<p>cases.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions that arise then.</p>
<p>So do song preferences, does your taste vector depend on context, like mood, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different moods, and so how does that take in it?</p>
<p>Is it possible to take that as a consideration?</p>
<p>Or do you just leave that as a interface problem that allows the user to just control it?</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m looking for workout music, I kind of specify it by choosing certain playlists,</p>
<p>doing certain search.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s a great point.</p>
<p>Back to the product development.</p>
<p>You could try to spend a few years trying to predict which mood you&rsquo;re in automatically</p>
<p>when you open Spotify, or you create a tab which is happy and sad, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to be right 100% of the time with one click.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s probably much better to let the user tell you if they&rsquo;re happy or sad, or</p>
<p>if they want to work out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your user interface becomes 2,000 tabs, you&rsquo;re introducing so</p>
<p>much friction so no one will use the product.</p>
<p>So then you have to get better.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this thing where you have to be able to get better.</p>
<p>So then you have to get better, so it&rsquo;s this thing where I think maybe it was, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember who coined it, but it&rsquo;s called fault tolerant UIs, right?</p>
<p>You build a UI that is tolerant of being wrong, and then you can be much less right in your</p>
<p>algorithms.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had to learn a lot of that.</p>
<p>Building the right UI that fits where the machine learning is, and a great discovery</p>
<p>there, which was by the teams during one of our hack days, was this thing of taking discovery,</p>
<p>packaging it into a playlist, and saying that these are new tracks that we think you might</p>
<p>like based on this.</p>
<p>And setting the right expectation made it a great product.</p>
<p>So I think we have this benefit that, for example, Tesla doesn&rsquo;t have that we can change</p>
<p>the expectation.</p>
<p>We can build a fault tolerant setting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to be fault tolerant when you&rsquo;re driving at 100 miles per hour or something.</p>
<p>And we have the luxury of being able to say that of being wrong if we have the right UI,</p>
<p>which gives us different abilities to take more risk.</p>
<p>So I actually think the self driving problem is much harder.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much less fun because people die.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And in Spotify, it&rsquo;s such a more fun problem because failure is beautiful in a way.</p>
<p>It leads to exploration.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really fun reinforcement learning problem.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is you get these WTF tweets like, how did I get this?</p>
<p>This song, yeah.</p>
<p>Which is a lot better than the self driving.</p>
<p>Exactly, so what&rsquo;s the feedback that a user, what&rsquo;s the signal that a user provides into</p>
<p>the system?</p>
<p>So you mentioned skipping.</p>
<p>What is like the strongest signal?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t mention clicking like.</p>
<p>So we have a few signals that are important.</p>
<p>Obviously playing, playing through.</p>
<p>So one of the benefits of music, actually, even compared to podcasts or movies is the</p>
<p>object itself is really only about three minutes.</p>
<p>So you get a lot of chances to recommend and the feedback loop is every three minutes instead</p>
<p>of every two hours or something.</p>
<p>So you actually get kind of noisy, but quite fast feedback.</p>
<p>And so you can see if people play through, which is the inverse of skip really.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important signal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, much of the consumption happens when your phone is in your pocket.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re running or driving or you&rsquo;re playing on a speaker.</p>
<p>And so you not skipping doesn&rsquo;t mean that you love that song.</p>
<p>It may be that it wasn&rsquo;t bad enough that you would walk up and skip.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a noisy signal.</p>
<p>Then we have the equivalent of the like, which is you saved it to your library.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty strong signal of affection.</p>
<p>And then we have the more explicit signal of playlisting.</p>
<p>Like you took the time to create a playlist, you put it in there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very little small chance that if you took all that trouble, this is not a really</p>
<p>important track to you.</p>
<p>And then we understand also what are the tracks it relates to.</p>
<p>So we have the playlisting, we have the like, and then we have the listening or skip.</p>
<p>And you have to have very different approaches to all of them because of different levels</p>
<p>of noise.</p>
<p>One is very voluminous, but noisy, and the other is rare, but you can probably trust it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting because I think between those signals captures all the information</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d want to capture.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a feeling, a shallow feeling for me that there&rsquo;s sometimes that I&rsquo;ll hear</p>
<p>a song that&rsquo;s like, yes, this is, you know, this was the right song for the moment.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s really no way to express that fact except by listening through it all the</p>
<p>way and maybe playing it again at that time or something.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no need for a button that says this was the best song I could have heard</p>
<p>at this moment.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re playing around with that, with kind of the thumbs up concept saying like,</p>
<p>I really like this.</p>
<p>Just kind of talking to the algorithm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear if that&rsquo;s the best way for humans to interact.</p>
<p>Maybe it is.</p>
<p>Maybe they should think of Spotify as a person, an agent sitting there trying to serve you</p>
<p>and you can say like, bad Spotify, good Spotify.</p>
<p>Right now, the analogy we&rsquo;ve had is more, you shouldn&rsquo;t think of us.</p>
<p>We should be invisible.</p>
<p>And the feedback is if you save it, it&rsquo;s kind of you work for yourself.</p>
<p>You do a playlist because you think it&rsquo;s great and we can learn from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of back to Tesla, how they kind of have this shadow mode.</p>
<p>They sit in what you drive.</p>
<p>We kind of took the same analogy.</p>
<p>We sit in what you playlist and then maybe we can offer you an autopilot where you can</p>
<p>take over for a while or something like that.</p>
<p>And then back off if you say like, that&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s interesting to figure out what your mental model is.</p>
<p>If Spotify is an AI that you talk to, which I think might be a bit too abstract for many</p>
<p>consumers, or if you still think of it as it&rsquo;s my music app, but it&rsquo;s just more helpful.</p>
<p>And it depends on the device it&rsquo;s running on, which brings us to smart speakers.</p>
<p>So I have a lot of the Spotify listening I do is on devices I can talk to, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from Amazon, Google or Apple.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of Spotify on those devices?</p>
<p>How do you think of it differently than on the phone or on the desktop?</p>
<p>There are a few things to say about the first of all, it&rsquo;s incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re growing like crazy, especially here in the US.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s solving a consumer need that I think is, you can think of it as just remote interactivity.</p>
<p>You can control this thing from across the room.</p>
<p>And it may feel like a small thing, but it turns out that friction matters to consumers</p>
<p>being able to say play, pause and so forth from across the room is very powerful.</p>
<p>So basically, you made the living room interactive now.</p>
<p>And what we see in our data is that the number one use case for these speakers is music,</p>
<p>music and podcast.</p>
<p>So fortunately for us, it&rsquo;s been important to these companies to have those use case</p>
<p>covered.</p>
<p>So they want to Spotify on this.</p>
<p>We have very good relationships with them.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing tremendous success with them.</p>
<p>What I think is interesting about them is it&rsquo;s already working.</p>
<p>We kind of had this epiphany many years ago, back when we started using Sonos.</p>
<p>If you went through all the trouble of setting up your Sonos system, you had this magical</p>
<p>experience where you had all the music ever made in your living room.</p>
<p>And we made this assumption that the home, everyone used to have a CD player at home,</p>
<p>but they never managed to get their files working in the home.</p>
<p>Having this network attached storage was too cumbersome for most consumers.</p>
<p>So we made the assumption that the home would skip from the CD all the way to streaming</p>
<p>books, where you would buy the steering and would have all the music built in.</p>
<p>That took longer than we thought.</p>
<p>But with the voice speakers, that was the unlocking that made kind of the connected</p>
<p>speaker happen in the home.</p>
<p>So it really exploded.</p>
<p>And we saw this engagement that we predicted would happen.</p>
<p>What I think is interesting, though, is where it&rsquo;s going from now.</p>
<p>Right now, you think of them as voice speakers.</p>
<p>But I think if you look at Google I.O., for example, they just added a camera to it, where</p>
<p>when the alarm goes off, instead of saying, hey, Google, stop, you can just wave your</p>
<p>hand.</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;re going to think more of it as an agent or as an assistant, truly an</p>
<p>assistant.</p>
<p>And an assistant that can see you is going to be much more effective than a blind assistant.</p>
<p>So I think these things will morph.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t necessarily think of them as, quote unquote, voice speakers anymore.</p>
<p>Just as interactive access to the Internet in the home.</p>
<p>But I still think that the biggest use case for those will be audio.</p>
<p>So for that reason, we&rsquo;re investing heavily in it.</p>
<p>And we built our own NLU stack to be able to the challenge here is, how do you innovate</p>
<p>in that world?</p>
<p>It lowers friction for consumers, but it&rsquo;s also much more constrained.</p>
<p>You have no pixels to play with in an audio only world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the vocabulary that is the interface.</p>
<p>So we started investing and playing around quite a lot with that, trying to understand</p>
<p>what the future will be of you speaking and gesturing and waving at your music.</p>
<p>And actually, you&rsquo;re actually nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle space because from</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;ve seen, the level of frustration people experience upon failure of natural</p>
<p>language understanding is much higher than failure in other contexts.</p>
<p>People get frustrated really fast.</p>
<p>So if you screw that experience up even just a little bit, they give up really quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think you see that in the data.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s tremendously successful, the most common interactions are play, pause and next.</p>
<p>The things where if you compare it to taking up your phone, unlocking it, bringing up the</p>
<p>app and skipping, clicking skip, it was much lower friction.</p>
<p>But then for longer, more complicated things like, can you find me that song about the</p>
<p>people still bring up the phone and search and then play it on their speaker?</p>
<p>So we tried again to build a fault tolerant UI where for the more complicated things,</p>
<p>you can still pick up your phone, have powerful full keyboard search and then try to optimize</p>
<p>for where there is actually lower friction and try to it&rsquo;s kind of like the test autopilot</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>You have to be at the level where you&rsquo;re helpful.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too smart and just in the way, people are going to get frustrated.</p>
<p>And first of all, I&rsquo;m not obsessed with stairway to heaven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a good song.</p>
<p>But let me mention that as a use case because it&rsquo;s an interesting one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve literally told one of I don&rsquo;t want to say the name of the speaker because when people</p>
<p>are listening to it, it&rsquo;ll make their speaker go off.</p>
<p>But I talked to the speaker and I say play stairway to heaven.</p>
<p>And every time it like not every time, but a large percentage of the time plays the wrong</p>
<p>stairway to heaven.</p>
<p>It plays like some cover of the and that part of the experience.</p>
<p>I actually wonder from a business perspective, does Spotify control that entire experience</p>
<p>or no?</p>
<p>It seems like the NLU, the natural language stuff is controlled by the speaker and then</p>
<p>Spotify stays at a layer below that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good and complicated question.</p>
<p>Some of which is dependent on the on the partners.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to comment on the on the specifics.</p>
<p>But the question is the right one.</p>
<p>The challenge is if you can&rsquo;t use any of the personalization, I mean, we know which stairway</p>
<p>to heaven.</p>
<p>And the truth is maybe for for one person, it is exactly the cover that they want.</p>
<p>And they would be very frustrated if a place I think we I think we default to the right</p>
<p>version.</p>
<p>But but you actually want to be able to do the cover for the person that just played</p>
<p>the cover 50 times.</p>
<p>Or Spotify is just going to seem stupid.</p>
<p>So you want to be able to leverage the personalization.</p>
<p>But you have this stack where you have the the ASR and this thing called the end best</p>
<p>list of the best guesses here.</p>
<p>And then the position comes in at the end.</p>
<p>You actually want the person to be here when you&rsquo;re guessing about what they actually</p>
<p>meant.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re working with these partners and it&rsquo;s a complicated it&rsquo;s a complicated thing</p>
<p>where you want to you want to be able.</p>
<p>So first of all, you want to be very careful with your users data.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to share your users data without the permission.</p>
<p>But you want to share some data so that their experience gets better.</p>
<p>So that these partners can understand enough, but not too much and so forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really the trick is that it&rsquo;s like a business driven relationship where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing product development across companies together, which is which is really complicated.</p>
<p>But this is exactly why we built our own NLU so that we actually can make personalized</p>
<p>guesses, because this is the biggest frustration from a user point of view.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand about ASR and best list and and business deals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, how hard can it be?</p>
<p>I was told this thing 50 times this version and still the place the wrong thing.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t it can&rsquo;t be hard.</p>
<p>So we try to take the user approach.</p>
<p>If the user the user is not going to understand the complications of business, we have to</p>
<p>solve it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about sort of a complicated subject that I myself I&rsquo;m quite torn about</p>
<p>the idea sort of of paying artists.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I saw as of August 31st, 2018, over 11 billion dollars were paid to rights holders.</p>
<p>So and further distributed to artists from Spotify.</p>
<p>So a lot of money is being paid to artists.</p>
<p>First of all, the whole time as a consumer for me, when I look at Spotify, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m remembering correctly, but I think you said exactly how I feel, which is this is</p>
<p>too good to be true.</p>
<p>Like when I start using Spotify, I assume you guys will go bankrupt in like a month.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this is too good.</p>
<p>A lot of people did.</p>
<p>I was like, this is amazing.</p>
<p>So one question I have is sort of the bigger question.</p>
<p>How do you make money in this complicated world?</p>
<p>How do you deal with the relationship with record labels who are complicated?</p>
<p>These big you&rsquo;re essentially have the task of herding cats, but like rich and powerful</p>
<p>powerful cats, and also have the task of paying artists enough and paying those labels enough</p>
<p>and still making money in the Internet space where people are not willing to pay hundreds</p>
<p>of dollars a month.</p>
<p>So how do you navigate the space?</p>
<p>How do you navigate?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful description.</p>
<p>Herding rich cats.</p>
<p>That before.</p>
<p>It is very complicated, and I think certainly actually betting against Spotify has been</p>
<p>statistically a very smart thing to do.</p>
<p>Just looking at the at the line of roadkill in music streaming services, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of I think if I understood the complexity when I joined Spotify, unfortunately, fortunately,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know enough about the music industry to understand the complexities, because then</p>
<p>I would have made a more rational guess that it wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So, you know, ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p>But I think there have been a few distinct challenges.</p>
<p>I think, as I said, one of the things that made it work at all was that Sweden and the</p>
<p>Nordics was a lost market.</p>
<p>So there was no risk for labels to try this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it would have worked if if the market was healthy.</p>
<p>So that was the initial condition.</p>
<p>Then we had this tremendous challenge with the model itself.</p>
<p>So now most people were pirating.</p>
<p>But for the people who bought a download or a CD, the artists would get all the revenue</p>
<p>for all the future plays then, right?</p>
<p>So you got it all up front, whereas the streaming model was like almost nothing day one, almost</p>
<p>nothing day two.</p>
<p>And then at some point, this curve of incremental revenue would intersect with your day one</p>
<p>payment.</p>
<p>And that took a long time to play out before before the music labels, they understood</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>But on the artist side, it took a lot of time to understand that actually, if I have a big</p>
<p>hit that is going to be played for many years, this is a much better model because I get</p>
<p>paid based on how much people use the product, not how much they thought they would use it</p>
<p>day one or so forth.</p>
<p>So it was a complicated model to get across.</p>
<p>But time helped with that.</p>
<p>And now the revenues to the music industry actually are bigger again than it&rsquo;s gone through</p>
<p>this incredible dip and now they&rsquo;re back up.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re very proud of having been a part of that.</p>
<p>So there have been distinct problems.</p>
<p>I think when it comes to the labels, we have taken the painful approach.</p>
<p>Some of our competition at the time, they kind of looked at other companies and said,</p>
<p>if we just ignore the rights, we get really big, really fast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be too big for the labels to kind of, too big to fail.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to kill us.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t take that approach.</p>
<p>We went legal from day one and we negotiated and negotiated and negotiated.</p>
<p>It was very slow.</p>
<p>It was very frustrating.</p>
<p>We were angry at seeing other companies taking shortcuts and seeming to get away with it.</p>
<p>It was this game theory thing where over many rounds of playing the game, this would be</p>
<p>the right strategy.</p>
<p>And even though clearly there&rsquo;s a lot of frustrations at times during renegotiations, there is this</p>
<p>there is this weird trust where we have been honest and fair.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never screwed them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never screwed us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 10 years, but there&rsquo;s this trust and like they know that if music doesn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>really big, if lots of people do not want to listen to music and want to pay for it,</p>
<p>Spotify has no business model.</p>
<p>So we actually are incredibly aligned.</p>
<p>Other companies, not to be tense, but other companies have other business models where</p>
<p>even if they made no money from music, they&rsquo;d still be profitable companies.</p>
<p>But Spotify won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I think the industry sees that we are actually aligned business wise.</p>
<p>So there is this trust that allows us to do product development, even if it&rsquo;s scary,</p>
<p>taking risks.</p>
<p>The free model itself was an incredible risk for the music industry to take that they should</p>
<p>get credit for.</p>
<p>Now, some of it was that they had nothing to lose in the game.</p>
<p>Some of it was that they had nothing to lose in Sweden.</p>
<p>But frankly, a lot of the labels also took risk.</p>
<p>And so I think we built up that trust with I think herding of cats sounds a bit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the word?</p>
<p>It sounds like dismissive of the cats.</p>
<p>Dismissive.</p>
<p>No, every cat matters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all beautiful and very important.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve taken a lot of risks and certainly it&rsquo;s been frustrating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really like playing it&rsquo;s game theory.</p>
<p>If you play the game many times, then you can have the statistical outcome that you</p>
<p>bet on.</p>
<p>And it feels very painful when you&rsquo;re in the middle of that thing.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s risk, there&rsquo;s trust, there&rsquo;s relationships.</p>
<p>From just having read the biography of Steve Jobs, similar kind of relationships were discussed</p>
<p>in iTunes.</p>
<p>The idea of selling a song for a dollar was very uncomfortable for labels.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And there was no, it was the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>It was trust, it was game theory as a lot of relationships that had to be built.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really a terrifyingly difficult process that Apple could go through a little</p>
<p>bit because they could afford for that process to fail.</p>
<p>For Spotify, it seems terrifying because you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Initially, I think a lot of it comes down to honestly Daniel and his tenacity in negotiating,</p>
<p>which seems like an impossible task because he was completely unknown and so forth.</p>
<p>But maybe that was also the reason that it worked.</p>
<p>But I think game theory is probably the best way to think about it.</p>
<p>You could go straight for this Nash equilibrium that someone is going to defect or you play</p>
<p>it many times, you try to actually go for the top left, the corporations sell.</p>
<p>Is there any magical reason why Spotify seems to have won this?</p>
<p>So a lot of people have tried to do what Spotify tried to do and Spotify has come out.</p>
<p>Well, so the answer is that there&rsquo;s no magical reason because I don&rsquo;t believe in magic.</p>
<p>But I think there are there are reasons.</p>
<p>And I think some of them are that people have misunderstood a lot of what we actually do.</p>
<p>The actual Spotify model is very complicated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve looked at the premium model and said, it seems like you can charge $9.99 for music</p>
<p>and people are going to pay, but that&rsquo;s not what happened.</p>
<p>Actually, when we launched the original mobile product, everyone said they would never pay.</p>
<p>What happened was they started on the free product and then their engagement grew so</p>
<p>much that eventually they said, maybe it is worth $9.99, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your propensity to pay gross with your engagement.</p>
<p>So we have this super complicated business model.</p>
<p>We operate two different business models, advertising and premium at the same time.</p>
<p>And I think that is hard to replicate.</p>
<p>I struggle to think of other companies that run large scale advertising and subscription</p>
<p>products at the same time.</p>
<p>So I think the business model is actually much more complicated than people think it is.</p>
<p>And so some people went after just the premium part without the free part and ran into a</p>
<p>wall where no one wanted to pay.</p>
<p>Some people went after just music should be free, just ads, which doesn&rsquo;t give you enough</p>
<p>revenue and doesn&rsquo;t work for the music industry.</p>
<p>So I think that combination is kind of opaque from the outside.</p>
<p>So maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t say it here and reveal the secret, but that turns out to be hard</p>
<p>to replicate than you would think.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of brilliant business strategies out there.</p>
<p>Brilliant business strategy here.</p>
<p>Brilliance or luck?</p>
<p>Probably more luck, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>It looks brilliant in retrospect.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah, when the books are written, they&rsquo;ll be brilliant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that your philosophy is to embrace change.</p>
<p>So how will the music streaming and music listening world change over the next 10 years,</p>
<p>20 years?</p>
<p>You look out into the far future.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think that music and for that matter, audio podcasts, audiobooks, I think it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>the few core human needs.</p>
<p>I think it there is no good reason to me why it shouldn&rsquo;t be at the scale of something</p>
<p>like messaging or social networking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a niche thing to listen to music or news or something.</p>
<p>So I think scale is obviously one of the things that I really hope for.</p>
<p>I think I hope that it&rsquo;s going to be billions of users.</p>
<p>I hope eventually everyone in the world gets access to all the world&rsquo;s music ever made.</p>
<p>So obviously, I think it&rsquo;s going to be a much bigger business.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we wouldn&rsquo;t be betting this big.</p>
<p>Now, if you look more at how it is consumed, what I&rsquo;m hoping is back to this analogy of</p>
<p>the software tool chain, where I think I sometimes internally I make this analogy to text messaging.</p>
<p>Text messaging was also based on standards in the area of mobile carriers.</p>
<p>You had the SMS, the 140 character, 120 character SMS.</p>
<p>And it was great because everyone agreed on the standards.</p>
<p>So as a consumer, you got a lot of distributions and interoperability, but it was a very constrained</p>
<p>format.</p>
<p>And when the industry wanted to add pictures to that format to do the MMS, I looked it</p>
<p>up and I think it took from the late 80s to early 2000s.</p>
<p>This is like a 15, 20 year product cycle to bring pictures into that.</p>
<p>Now, once that entire value chain of creation and consumption got wrapped in one software</p>
<p>stack within something like Snapchat or WhatsApp, the first week they added disappearing messages.</p>
<p>Then two weeks later, they added stories.</p>
<p>The pace of innovation when you&rsquo;re on one software stack and you can affect both creation</p>
<p>and consumption, I think it&rsquo;s going to be rapid.</p>
<p>So with these streaming services, we now, for the first time in history, have enough,</p>
<p>I hope, people on one of these services.</p>
<p>Actually, whether it&rsquo;s Spotify or Amazon or Apple or YouTube, and hopefully enough</p>
<p>creators that you can actually start working with the format again.</p>
<p>And that excites me.</p>
<p>I think being able to change these constraints from 100 years, that could really do something</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>I really hope it&rsquo;s not just going to be the iteration on the same thing for the next 10</p>
<p>to 20 years as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, changing the creation of music, the creation of audio, the creation of podcasts</p>
<p>is a really fascinating possibility.</p>
<p>I myself don&rsquo;t understand what it is about podcasts that&rsquo;s so intimate.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts.</p>
<p>I think it touches on a deep human need for connection that people do feel like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>connected to when they listen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what the psychology of that is, but in this world that&rsquo;s becoming</p>
<p>more and more disconnected, it feels like this is fulfilling a certain kind of need.</p>
<p>And empowering the creator as opposed to just the listener is really interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited that you&rsquo;re working on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think one of the things that is inspiring for our teams to work on podcasts is exactly</p>
<p>that, whether you think, like I probably do, that it&rsquo;s something biological about perceiving</p>
<p>to be in the middle of the conversation that makes you listen in a different way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>People seem to perceive it differently.</p>
<p>And there was this narrative for a long time that if you look at video, everything kind</p>
<p>of in the foreground, it got shorter and shorter and shorter because of financial pressures</p>
<p>and monetization and so forth.</p>
<p>And eventually, at the end, there&rsquo;s almost like 20 seconds clip, people just screaming</p>
<p>something and I feel really good about the fact that you could have interpreted that</p>
<p>as people have no attention span anymore.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to listen to things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not interested in deeper stories.</p>
<p>People are getting dumber.</p>
<p>But then podcasts came along and it&rsquo;s almost like, no, no, the need still existed.</p>
<p>But maybe it was the fact that you&rsquo;re not prepared to look at your phone like this for</p>
<p>two hours.</p>
<p>But if you can drive at the same time, it seems like people really want to dig deeper</p>
<p>and they want to hear like the more complicated version.</p>
<p>So to me, that is very inspiring that that podcast is actually long form.</p>
<p>It gives me a lot of hope for humanity that people seem really interested in hearing deeper,</p>
<p>more complicated conversations.</p>
<p>This is I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So the majority for this podcast, listen to the whole thing.</p>
<p>This whole conversation we&rsquo;ve been talking for an hour and 45 minutes.</p>
<p>And somebody will I mean, most people will be listening to these words I&rsquo;m speaking right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that 10 years ago with where the world seemed to go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very positive, I think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>And empowering the creator there is really exciting.</p>
<p>Last question.</p>
<p>You also have a passion for just mobile in general.</p>
<p>How do you see the smartphone world, the digital space of smartphones and just everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on the move, whether it&rsquo;s Internet of Things and so on, changing over the next 10 years</p>
<p>and so on?</p>
<p>I think that one way to think about it is that computing might be moving out of these</p>
<p>multipurpose devices, the computer we had and the phone, into specific purpose devices.</p>
<p>And it will be ambient that at least in my home, you just shout something at someone</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always one of these speakers close enough.</p>
<p>And so you start behaving differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if you have the Internet ambient, ambiently around you and you can ask it things.</p>
<p>So I think computing will kind of get more integrated and we won&rsquo;t necessarily think</p>
<p>of it as connected to a device in the same way that we do today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the path to that.</p>
<p>Maybe we used to have these desktop computers and then we partially replaced that with the</p>
<p>laptops and left the desktop at home when I work.</p>
<p>And then we got these phones and we started leaving the mobile phones.</p>
<p>We had the desktop at home when I work and then we got these phones and we started leaving</p>
<p>the laptop at home for a while.</p>
<p>And maybe for stretches of time you&rsquo;re going to start using the watch and you can leave</p>
<p>your phone at home for a run or something.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re on this progressive path where I think what is happening with voice is that</p>
<p>you have an interaction paradigm that doesn&rsquo;t require as large physical devices.</p>
<p>So I definitely think there&rsquo;s a future where you can have your AirPods and your watch and</p>
<p>you can do a lot of computing.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be this binary thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be like many of us still have a laptop, we just use it less.</p>
<p>And so you shift your consumption over.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know about AR glasses and so forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about it.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in that area, but I still think it&rsquo;s quite far away.</p>
<p>AR, VR, all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, VR is happening and working.</p>
<p>I think the recent Oculus Quest is quite impressive.</p>
<p>I think AR is further away.</p>
<p>At least that type of AR.</p>
<p>But I do think your phone or watch or glasses understanding where you are and maybe what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at and being able to give you audio cues about that.</p>
<p>Or you can say like, what is this?</p>
<p>And it tells you what it is.</p>
<p>That I think might happen.</p>
<p>You use your watch or your glasses as a mouse pointer on reality.</p>
<p>I think it might be a while before&hellip;</p>
<p>I might be wrong.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>I think it might be a while before we walk around with these big lab glasses that project</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really difficult when you have to understand the physical world enough to</p>
<p>project onto it.</p>
<p>I lied about the last question.</p>
<p>Go ahead, because I just thought of audio and my favorite topic, which is the movie</p>
<p>Her, do you think, whether it&rsquo;s part of Spotify or not, we&rsquo;ll have, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen the movie Her.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And there, audio is the primary form of interaction and the connection with another entity that</p>
<p>you can actually have a relationship with, that you fall in love with based on voice</p>
<p>alone, audio alone.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s possible, first of all, based on audio alone to fall in love with</p>
<p>somebody?</p>
<p>Somebody or&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, yeah, let&rsquo;s go with somebody.</p>
<p>Just have a relationship based on audio alone.</p>
<p>And second question to that, can we create an artificial intelligence system that allows</p>
<p>one to fall in love with it and her, him with you?</p>
<p>So this is my personal answer, speaking for me as a person, the answer is quite unequivocally</p>
<p>yes on both.</p>
<p>I think what we just said about podcasts and the feeling of being in the middle of a</p>
<p>conversation, if you could have an assistant where, and we just said that feels like a</p>
<p>very personal setting.</p>
<p>So if you walk around with these headphones and this thing, you&rsquo;re speaking with this</p>
<p>thing all of the time that feels like it&rsquo;s in your brain.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be much easier to fall in love with than something that would be</p>
<p>on your screen.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>And then from the, you can probably answer this better than me, but from the concept</p>
<p>of if it&rsquo;s going to be possible to build a machine that can achieve that, I think whether</p>
<p>you think of it as, if you can fake it, the philosophical zombie that assimilates it enough</p>
<p>or it somehow actually is, I think there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s only a question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a question if you ask me about time, I&rsquo;d have a different answer.</p>
<p>But if you say I&rsquo;ve given some half infinite time, absolutely.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just atoms and arrangement of information.</p>
<p>Well, I personally think that love is a lot simpler than people think.</p>
<p>So we started with true romance and ended in love.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a better place to end.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Gustav, thanks so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It was fun.</p>
