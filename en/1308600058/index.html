    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk all about</p>
<p>how to optimize your workspace for maximum productivity.</p>
<p>Indeed, that means to heighten levels of focus,</p>
<p>to increase levels of creativity,</p>
<p>to improve your ability to task switch.</p>
<p>And this could be for sake of school or for work,</p>
<p>creative endeavors, personal endeavors.</p>
<p>This really extends to everybody.</p>
<p>Most often, when we hear about how to focus</p>
<p>or how to get the most out of our work sessions,</p>
<p>we hear about the biology and the psychology of that.</p>
<p>We hear about dopamine and we hear about serotonin</p>
<p>and we hear about caffeine.</p>
<p>And indeed, those are topics that I&rsquo;ve covered a lot</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Today, we will touch on each of those,</p>
<p>but we are mainly going to focus on</p>
<p>how we arrange our physical environment</p>
<p>and indeed how we arrange ourselves</p>
<p>in that physical environment</p>
<p>in order to bring out the best in our neurobiology.</p>
<p>That is how to put ourselves into a heightened state</p>
<p>of focus by virtue of things as simple</p>
<p>as where we place our screen relative to our eyes</p>
<p>at a given time of day.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there&rsquo;s excellent research on this,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s excellent research, for instance,</p>
<p>on whether or not you should or should not listen to music,</p>
<p>whether or not you should use things like binaural beats,</p>
<p>and if so, what frequency of binaural beats.</p>
<p>We are going to cover all of that.</p>
<p>And by the end, you will have a checklist of things</p>
<p>that you can do to optimize your workspace on any budget.</p>
<p>I will mention various products and apps</p>
<p>that some of you might find useful</p>
<p>for optimizing your workspace,</p>
<p>but I want to emphasize at the outset</p>
<p>that none of those that I mentioned are any products or apps</p>
<p>that we have a financial relationship to.</p>
<p>And more importantly, you don&rsquo;t need them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explain how for zero cost,</p>
<p>you can arrange your workspace in ways</p>
<p>that makes you maximally productive, maximally focused,</p>
<p>and allows you to adapt your workspace</p>
<p>to different environments,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re traveling, working with others,</p>
<p>working alone, et cetera.</p>
<p>Just to give you a little hint of where we are going,</p>
<p>I will mention a zero cost app</p>
<p>that will deliver binaural beats at a particular frequency</p>
<p>that peer-reviewed research has shown</p>
<p>can enhance certain types of learning and memory.</p>
<p>However, peer-reviewed research also shows</p>
<p>that it can diminish performance in other types of tasks.</p>
<p>So stay tuned, we&rsquo;ll go into all the details</p>
<p>so that you can optimize your workspace</p>
<p>for zero cost and get the most out</p>
<p>of your efforts and endeavors.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates</p>
<p>things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the Clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their Energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about workspace optimization.</p>
<p>This is a topic that&rsquo;s intrigued me for a very long time</p>
<p>because my undergraduate advisor,</p>
<p>my graduate advisor, and my postdoc advisor</p>
<p>had many things in common,</p>
<p>including being great scientists,</p>
<p>being kind people and terrific mentors,</p>
<p>but they had another thing in common,</p>
<p>which always perplexed me,</p>
<p>which is that their offices were a complete disaster.</p>
<p>They had mountains of books, mountains of papers,</p>
<p>mountains of all sorts of stuff,</p>
<p>and yet all of them were extremely productive</p>
<p>and could remain extremely focused</p>
<p>in that incredibly cluttered environment.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m somebody who doesn&rsquo;t like clutter.</p>
<p>I find it very hard to focus in cluttered environments.</p>
<p>And indeed, there&rsquo;s tremendous variation among people</p>
<p>as to whether or not they can remain focused</p>
<p>or whether or not they struggle to focus</p>
<p>in physically cluttered environments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no right or wrong to this,</p>
<p>but the question we should ask ourselves</p>
<p>is why were they all able to be so focused?</p>
<p>And it turns out that the reason</p>
<p>they were able to be so focused</p>
<p>is that they all captured one single</p>
<p>and yet fundamental variable of workspace optimization.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about what that variable is.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>what all the variables of optimizing a workspace are,</p>
<p>things like vision, things like light,</p>
<p>things like noise in the room,</p>
<p>whether or not you listen to music or not,</p>
<p>whether or not you use noise-canceling headphones or not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about all of that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to do that in a way</p>
<p>that you can optimize your workspace</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you are at home,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re on the road, et cetera.</p>
<p>Because the last thing I would ever want to do</p>
<p>is to create a situation</p>
<p>where you find the optimal workspace</p>
<p>and then you are a slave to that optimal workspace.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not the way the world works.</p>
<p>What you want to do, or my goal for you rather,</p>
<p>is that you will have a short checklist of things</p>
<p>that you can look to anytime you sit down to do work.</p>
<p>And you can think about the underlying variables</p>
<p>that impact your brain and your body</p>
<p>and allow your brain and body to get into the optimal state</p>
<p>in order to learn, in order to be productive,</p>
<p>and indeed to move through your work bout</p>
<p>in a very relaxed and pleasureful way</p>
<p>while maintaining focus</p>
<p>and while pursuing any of the number of things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>The first variable we want to think about</p>
<p>in terms of workspace optimization is vision and light.</p>
<p>Now, on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>devoted all to habits,</p>
<p>I talked about the importance of dividing your 24-hour day</p>
<p>into three different phases.</p>
<p>And for those of you that haven&rsquo;t heard that episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to briefly summarize what I described.</p>
<p>From the time you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>until about six or seven or eight,</p>
<p>sometimes nine hours later,</p>
<p>your brain is in a unique state.</p>
<p>It is in a state of high levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>a neuromodulator, and high levels of epinephrine,</p>
<p>as well as hormones like cortisol and so forth.</p>
<p>Without going into the biology of those things,</p>
<p>they set your brain into a state of high alertness.</p>
<p>And this is true whether or not</p>
<p>you indulge in caffeine or not.</p>
<p>I know some of you say,</p>
<p>oh, I really don&rsquo;t wake up until the afternoon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more alert and focused in the afternoon.</p>
<p>We will talk about that phase of the 24-hour day in a moment.</p>
<p>But that early part of the day is a time of day</p>
<p>in which for sake of workspace optimization,</p>
<p>being in a brightly lit environment</p>
<p>can lend itself to optimal work throughout the day,</p>
<p>not just during that early phase.</p>
<p>And so while on many episodes of this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also emphasized the importance</p>
<p>of getting morning sunlight in your eyes</p>
<p>within 30 to 60 minutes of waking.</p>
<p>Not as often, but now and again,</p>
<p>I will also mention that it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to light your daytime environment</p>
<p>as brightly as you safely can.</p>
<p>So if you are going to be doing work in this early,</p>
<p>what I call phase one portion of your day,</p>
<p>you want to have as much light</p>
<p>and indeed as much overhead light</p>
<p>shining on you as safely possible.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you don&rsquo;t want it so bright</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s glaring and you have to squint, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you want as much light as is safely possible.</p>
<p>And you can do that a couple of simple ways.</p>
<p>One is if you do own or you&rsquo;re in an environment</p>
<p>where you have overhead lights,</p>
<p>turn on those overhead lights.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s special about overhead lights for setting alertness</p>
<p>is that the neurons in our eyes,</p>
<p>which are called melanopsin ganglion cells,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the fancy name.</p>
<p>Melanopsin ganglion cells are mainly enriched</p>
<p>in the lower half of our retinas.</p>
<p>So when we look in our eyes and view the upper visual field,</p>
<p>those neurons send little wires</p>
<p>to an area of our hypothalamus,</p>
<p>right above the roof of our mouth,</p>
<p>that creates a state of alertness.</p>
<p>Now, early in the day, we want to be as alert as possible.</p>
<p>And this phase one of our circadian cycle</p>
<p>is when we are best at doing analytic detail type work.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to go into other aspects</p>
<p>of workspace optimization that are important for phase one.</p>
<p>But during phase one, again,</p>
<p>within zero to about eight or nine hours after waking,</p>
<p>bright lights in your environment,</p>
<p>in particular overhead lights,</p>
<p>are going to facilitate focus.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to facilitate further release</p>
<p>of things like dopamine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>and healthy amounts of cortisol.</p>
<p>And we want that to happen early in the day</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>For instance, we don&rsquo;t want that cortisol peak</p>
<p>to happen too late in the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually associated with depression and insomnia</p>
<p>and a number of things that we just don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I&rsquo;ve done for my workspace</p>
<p>is to make sure that when I wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>I do go get my sunlight.</p>
<p>If the sun isn&rsquo;t out,</p>
<p>I turn on as many bright artificial lights</p>
<p>as I can manage or tolerate.</p>
<p>And then I go get my sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>But once I set out to do some work</p>
<p>that all the overhead lights in that room are on,</p>
<p>as well as lights in front of me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s again, to stimulate heightened levels of focus</p>
<p>and further release of these neuromodulators</p>
<p>that I mentioned before,</p>
<p>dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Now, the way that one could do that</p>
<p>could be a very low cost way of having,</p>
<p>for instance, a desk lamp and those overhead lights.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody that wants to take this</p>
<p>to the next level, you can purchase a ring light,</p>
<p>which is, I think those are mainly made</p>
<p>for people doing selfie type videos,</p>
<p>for Instagram posts and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Ring lights can be pretty cost-effective</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re very bright</p>
<p>and they have the sort of bright blue light</p>
<p>that is going to optimally stimulate</p>
<p>those melanopsin ganglion cells.</p>
<p>So some people I know will have a blue light</p>
<p>or a bright LED on their desk in front of them.</p>
<p>And indeed, I have one of these.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use a ring light.</p>
<p>I use a light pad.</p>
<p>The particular light pad I use, I bought on Amazon.</p>
<p>I can mention the brand, but again,</p>
<p>I have no financial affiliation to them.</p>
<p>This is the Artograph light pad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed for drawing.</p>
<p>And it says on it, 930 lux.</p>
<p>Lux is just a measure of brightness.</p>
<p>So I place that on the desk in front of me</p>
<p>and I turn it on essentially</p>
<p>throughout this phase one of the day.</p>
<p>Even if I walk away from the desk, I tend to keep it on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t consume that much energy.</p>
<p>And in that way, I&rsquo;m constantly being bombarded</p>
<p>with photons that keep my levels of alertness up</p>
<p>because the early part of the day is when I do</p>
<p>the majority of that focused work.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t need the light pad.</p>
<p>You can use a ring light, or you can simply use</p>
<p>any kind of other lights that you might happen</p>
<p>to have, artificial lights.</p>
<p>For those of you that can place your desk near a window</p>
<p>and even better to open the window,</p>
<p>that would be really fantastic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have access to that.</p>
<p>Why would I say open the window?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that sunlight is going to be</p>
<p>the best stimulus for waking up your brain and body</p>
<p>through this melanopsin to hypothalamus system.</p>
<p>And by looking at sunlight through a window,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 50, five, zero times less effective</p>
<p>than if that window were to be open,</p>
<p>mostly because those windows filter out a lot of the</p>
<p>wavelengths of blue light that are essential</p>
<p>for stimulating the eyes and this wake up signal.</p>
<p>So all of this is rests on the premise that we need</p>
<p>to be alert in order to do our work,</p>
<p>in particular focused work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about before in the habits episode,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m saying again now, that first phase of the day,</p>
<p>that first seven or eight or nine hours of the day</p>
<p>is really the time in which our neurochemistry is primed</p>
<p>for getting the most amount of focused</p>
<p>kind of challenging work done,</p>
<p>where a lot of precision and detail is required.</p>
<p>So you want to brightly light your work environment</p>
<p>during that first phase.</p>
<p>Again, from the time you wake up, try and get sunlight,</p>
<p>but then even if you&rsquo;re going to get exercise</p>
<p>or do other things,</p>
<p>you want to get as much bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>as you safely can.</p>
<p>And then you want to light your work environment.</p>
<p>Now in the afternoon, starting at about nine</p>
<p>and continuing until about 16 hours after waking,</p>
<p>you want to start dimming the lights in that environment.</p>
<p>Now you don&rsquo;t want to make it dark</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to get sleepy at two o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>in the afternoon unless you&rsquo;re going to take a brief nap,</p>
<p>which I do and is perfectly fine</p>
<p>as long as it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with your nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>But the idea is that in this so-called phase two</p>
<p>of the 24 hour cycle from about nine to 16 hours</p>
<p>after waking, you want to bring the level of lights</p>
<p>down a bit.</p>
<p>And when I say down, I literally mean down.</p>
<p>Having lights that are in front of you is fine,</p>
<p>but overhead lights at that time are not going to be optimal</p>
<p>for the sorts of neurochemical states</p>
<p>that your brain wants to be in.</p>
<p>The states that I&rsquo;m referring to are a shift</p>
<p>from the dopamine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s highest early in the day</p>
<p>to increases in things like serotonin</p>
<p>and other neuromodulators that put your brain</p>
<p>into a state that&rsquo;s better for creative endeavors</p>
<p>or for more abstract thinking.</p>
<p>Now, as we&rsquo;ll soon see,</p>
<p>there are other things you can do to improve</p>
<p>creative thinking and abstract thinking.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are things you can do</p>
<p>to improve analytic thinking.</p>
<p>We will talk about those,</p>
<p>things that are distinct from light,</p>
<p>but right now we&rsquo;re just focusing on light.</p>
<p>So what I recommend doing and what I personally do</p>
<p>is I will turn off overhead lights in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not completely dim, it&rsquo;s not completely dark,</p>
<p>but I will start to reduce the amount of overhead light</p>
<p>and just simply keep the light pad on</p>
<p>and whatever other lamps I happen to be using.</p>
<p>Now, one thing we haven&rsquo;t talked about is screen brightness.</p>
<p>This is highly individual.</p>
<p>People have different retinal sensitivities.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is everybody differs</p>
<p>in terms of how bright they can tolerate</p>
<p>their visual environment and their screen.</p>
<p>And whether or not you are sensitive to light or not</p>
<p>will depend on a lot of factors.</p>
<p>Some of it is eye color.</p>
<p>Indeed, people with darker color eyes</p>
<p>generally can tolerate more bright light than others.</p>
<p>I have green eyes.</p>
<p>I am very, very sensitive to light.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m outdoors at a cafe or something</p>
<p>and the table has any kind of reflective properties</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a sunny day,</p>
<p>I can barely see the person across the table for me</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m wearing sunglasses.</p>
<p>Some people, other members of my family, for instance,</p>
<p>have dark brown eyes and can just sit there</p>
<p>and have a conversation without the need</p>
<p>for sunglasses at all.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s tremendous variation there.</p>
<p>One or the other isn&rsquo;t healthy or advantageous necessarily.</p>
<p>Just understand that you never want to be in an environment</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s painful to maintain looking at whatever it is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>If something&rsquo;s painful to look at,</p>
<p>it could be damaging to your eyes.</p>
<p>So you do want to protect your eyes.</p>
<p>Now, in this second phase of the day,</p>
<p>since most of us are working indoors,</p>
<p>but even if you&rsquo;re working outdoors,</p>
<p>you want to try and get the amount of light</p>
<p>reduced overall, but in particular that overhead light.</p>
<p>And you also want to start reducing the amount of blue light</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re being exposed to.</p>
<p>So somewhere around four or 5 p.m., which for me is,</p>
<p>about 12 hours after I&rsquo;ve been awake</p>
<p>or 14 hours after I&rsquo;ve been awake,</p>
<p>I will turn off that light pad and start to transition</p>
<p>the lights in my environment to more yellows and reds.</p>
<p>Now I can&rsquo;t always do this.</p>
<p>I have friends that actually have converted</p>
<p>their entire homes from blue light early in the day</p>
<p>to red light late in the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool and fantastic.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cost to doing that and it is optimal</p>
<p>in terms of optimizing productivity and sleep and so forth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not feasible for a lot of people.</p>
<p>But what I do is I simply switch to using yellow lamps.</p>
<p>I will turn off that LED in the later afternoon,</p>
<p>again, around four or 5 p.m.</p>
<p>And I tend to wake up around 6 a.m. or so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll turn those off.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ll try and do also is I&rsquo;ll try and dim the screen</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m working on so that I can still manage</p>
<p>to see everything that I need to see,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s quite a bit dimmer than it was early in the day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s phase two of the day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we want to think about light.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll just mention,</p>
<p>because I know there are people who are working</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s phase three,</p>
<p>which is about 17 to 24 hours after waking.</p>
<p>And I realized that for shift workers</p>
<p>or for people that are pulling all-nighters</p>
<p>or for students, oftentimes,</p>
<p>you need to be awake and studying in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I myself am somebody who for years would pull anywhere</p>
<p>from five to 10 all-nighters per year.</p>
<p>I still pull an all-nighter now and again</p>
<p>because of deadlines and so forth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
<p>If you can avoid it, great,</p>
<p>but many people just simply have to do this</p>
<p>for sake of shift work or because of impending deadlines</p>
<p>or procrastination or all of the above.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be doing work</p>
<p>in that third phase of your circadian cycle,</p>
<p>you really want to limit the amount of bright light</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting in your eyes</p>
<p>to just the amount that allows you</p>
<p>to do the work that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Because if you get light in your eyes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s any brighter than that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to severely deplete your melatonin levels.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to severely shift your circadian clock</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s effectively like traveling to another time zone.</p>
<p>So if you stay up from 3 a.m. until 6 a.m.</p>
<p>or 2 a.m. until 4 a.m. working on a term paper</p>
<p>or something of that sort</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting bright light in your eyes,</p>
<p>you are effectively flying six hours</p>
<p>to a different time zone,</p>
<p>or at least that&rsquo;s what your body registers it as.</p>
<p>And it can really throw your sleep and your metabolism</p>
<p>and a number of other things out of whack.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s an exception to this,</p>
<p>which is if you really want to be awake,</p>
<p>it can often be beneficial to flipping on all the lights</p>
<p>in the room and keeping them really bright.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things to do is to stay up all night</p>
<p>studying when you&rsquo;re in a dim environment.</p>
<p>So you have to determine the trade-off</p>
<p>between whether or not you want to shift your clock</p>
<p>or whether or not you want to get the work done.</p>
<p>And I would say the ideal situation is to sleep at night</p>
<p>and to do your work during the day and in the afternoon.</p>
<p>But if you do have to be awake in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>do understand that you want to dim those lights overall.</p>
<p>You would not want to use that LED.</p>
<p>You would not want to have overhead lights on</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re really struggling to stay awake,</p>
<p>in which case you want to get</p>
<p>as many bright lights on as possible.</p>
<p>So there are a couple of tricks to all-nighters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really want people pulling all-nighters</p>
<p>unless they have to,</p>
<p>but there are a few things that you can do</p>
<p>without taking stimulants in order to stay up all night</p>
<p>that can be beneficial that maximize on your biology.</p>
<p>One of them that&rsquo;s a little less commonly known</p>
<p>is you can drink 32 ounces of water</p>
<p>and commit to not going to the bathroom</p>
<p>for 90 minutes at least.</p>
<p>Turns out that there&rsquo;s a circuit</p>
<p>that goes from your bladder,</p>
<p>literally neurons that go from your bladder</p>
<p>to your brainstem.</p>
<p>And when you have to urinate, it makes you very alert.</p>
<p>As many of you have probably experienced,</p>
<p>this is actually what wakes us up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night</p>
<p>when we have to use the bathroom</p>
<p>is this circuit for alertness that goes from full bladder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s signaled by the bladder being full to the brainstem.</p>
<p>And this is the circuit that is disrupted</p>
<p>in kids that have bedwetting issues.</p>
<p>And there are a number of cognitive behavioral approaches</p>
<p>to that.</p>
<p>Sometimes bedwetting in very young kids</p>
<p>is because the circuit hasn&rsquo;t developed yet.</p>
<p>Most adults fortunately are not bedwetting,</p>
<p>but you can increase the amount of alertness in your system</p>
<p>and remain awake in the middle of the night</p>
<p>by drinking a little bit more water</p>
<p>than you normally would.</p>
<p>And then refraining from going to the restroom.</p>
<p>That certainly will lend itself to alertness.</p>
<p>You know how difficult it is to fall asleep</p>
<p>when you have to use the restroom, for instance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one tool.</p>
<p>The other thing is again, to flip on as many bright lights</p>
<p>in the environment as possible.</p>
<p>And then of course, people will rely on stimulants</p>
<p>like caffeine or even more aggressive stimulants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something I necessarily recommend.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll each have to determine that for you.</p>
<p>But if you do in fact have to use all-nighters</p>
<p>for any reason, you can maximize this bladder</p>
<p>to brain approach and the bright light approach.</p>
<p>Okay, so that more or less covers</p>
<p>how bright to keep your overall environment</p>
<p>and how bright to keep your screen.</p>
<p>If you really want to get nerdy about this,</p>
<p>there is a free app called Light Meter</p>
<p>where you can start measuring how many lux,</p>
<p>how many photons are in a given environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually measuring reflectance of photons and so on.</p>
<p>If you can look up what a lux meter does, if you like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend doing that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to set a critical threshold by which,</p>
<p>you know, for instance, we say once your environment</p>
<p>is more than 1500 lux, then it&rsquo;s too bright</p>
<p>or not bright enough, et cetera.</p>
<p>Everyone has different retinal sensitivities.</p>
<p>Everyone will find that different levels of brightness</p>
<p>will cause them to be alert.</p>
<p>Different levels of dimness, if you will, in the room</p>
<p>will cause them to feel sleepy.</p>
<p>You really want to just modulate across the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very bright.</p>
<p>As bright as it safely can be early in the day</p>
<p>so that you are alert.</p>
<p>You can do your focus detailed work in that first phase.</p>
<p>And then in the afternoon, as you move into</p>
<p>more creative type works or abstract thinking</p>
<p>or working with other people in kind of a brainstorming mode</p>
<p>that you would shift to dimmer lights, yellow lights,</p>
<p>eliminate the blue lights as much as possible.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s light, but there&rsquo;s another aspect of vision</p>
<p>that has been shown to be critically important</p>
<p>for how alert we are going to be</p>
<p>and how well we can maintain that alertness.</p>
<p>And that has to do with where our visual focus is</p>
<p>in a given environment.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not talking about overall brightness.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to now is simply where you place</p>
<p>your phone or your tablet or computer screen or book,</p>
<p>whatever it is that you happen to be looking at.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very underappreciated and yet incredible aspect</p>
<p>of our neurology that has to do with the relationship</p>
<p>between where we look and our level of alertness.</p>
<p>And it works in a very logical way.</p>
<p>We have clusters of neurons in our brainstem</p>
<p>and those clusters of neurons control our eyelid muscles</p>
<p>and they control our eye movements up and down</p>
<p>and to the sides.</p>
<p>And indeed, if you were to look at an eyeball,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at a lot of eyeballs in my lab</p>
<p>and I teach neuroanatomy.</p>
<p>So we do this from time to time.</p>
<p>We would see that there are six muscles</p>
<p>attached to your eyeball.</p>
<p>Now, four of them are located at the top, the bottom,</p>
<p>and the two sides of your eyeball.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got the 12 o&rsquo;clock, six o&rsquo;clock, three o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>and nine o&rsquo;clock of your eyeball.</p>
<p>And those muscles can move your eye in the socket</p>
<p>from side to side and up and down.</p>
<p>And then we also have some muscles that can actually</p>
<p>pull the eyeballs at angles, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, we have different muscles that can move</p>
<p>the eyes at different angles as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we can look up into the side</p>
<p>or down into the side,</p>
<p>not just from side to side or up or down.</p>
<p>Now, the neurons that control those muscles</p>
<p>have a very interesting feature,</p>
<p>which is that when we are looking down toward the ground</p>
<p>or anywhere below basically the central region of our face,</p>
<p>the neurons that control that eye movement</p>
<p>are intimately related to areas of the brainstem</p>
<p>that release certain types of neuromodulators</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>And they activate areas of the brain that are associated</p>
<p>with calm and indeed even with sleepiness.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an active inhibition or prevention of neurons</p>
<p>that increase alertness.</p>
<p>Now, the opposite is also true.</p>
<p>We have neurons that place our eyes into an upward gaze</p>
<p>above the sort of level of our nose and up above our forehead</p>
<p>literally looking up while keeping the head stationary.</p>
<p>Or if you tilt your head back and you look up,</p>
<p>these neurons are still active.</p>
<p>Those neurons don&rsquo;t just control the position of the eyes</p>
<p>and cause them to move up.</p>
<p>They also trigger the activation of brain circuits</p>
<p>that are associated with alertness.</p>
<p>Now, this is a fundamental feature</p>
<p>of the way that our eyes and brain are wired together</p>
<p>and how they relate to what we call autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>And there are a bunch of details there.</p>
<p>We will actually have a guest in a few weeks</p>
<p>who has learned to exploit these neurons</p>
<p>and the fact that they control these different states</p>
<p>of calm or alertness in order to generate hypnotic states,</p>
<p>to place people into very atypical states</p>
<p>in which they&rsquo;re both very alert and very calm.</p>
<p>Save that for a future episode.</p>
<p>But the important thing to understand</p>
<p>is when you are looking down below the level of your nose,</p>
<p>you are essentially decelerating your alertness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reducing your amount of alertness.</p>
<p>It might be subtle, but it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Whereas when you look straight ahead</p>
<p>or in particular, when you look up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increasing your level of alertness.</p>
<p>Now, this has some obvious implications.</p>
<p>When we get sleepy, our eyelids tend to close</p>
<p>and we tend to nod down.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re wide awake, we tend to be wide-eyed.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t tend to blink as often.</p>
<p>And we tend to be chin up</p>
<p>and kind of on vigilance and alertness.</p>
<p>So this has a evolutionary</p>
<p>or at least an adaptive component to it.</p>
<p>This can be exploited and indeed it&rsquo;s been researched</p>
<p>in terms of how it can be used to optimize work environments.</p>
<p>Contrary to what most people do,</p>
<p>which is to look down at their laptop, tablet, or phone.</p>
<p>If you want to be alert</p>
<p>and you want to maintain the maximum amount of focus</p>
<p>for whatever it is that you&rsquo;re reading or doing,</p>
<p>you want that screen or whatever it is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re looking at to at least be at eye level</p>
<p>and ideally slightly above it.</p>
<p>Now, I haven&rsquo;t seen many workspaces</p>
<p>that take advantage of this</p>
<p>very hardwired neurobiological fact.</p>
<p>So what should you do with this information?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re somebody who sits down to do work</p>
<p>and starts to feel sleepy or simply unfocused,</p>
<p>unable to attend to whatever it is that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you take your laptop or tablet.</p>
<p>I do hope that most people aren&rsquo;t doing serious work</p>
<p>on their phones because it&rsquo;s such a small visual window</p>
<p>and we can talk about why that&rsquo;s an issue later.</p>
<p>And the idea would be to place that screen of your tablet</p>
<p>or your laptop or other computer</p>
<p>and try and get it elevated at least to nose level,</p>
<p>your nose level, or even higher.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that can be complicated to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long just used a stack of books</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll sometimes take a box and turn it upside down</p>
<p>and set it there.</p>
<p>I do use a mixed standing seated desk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about that in a few minutes.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways that you could do this.</p>
<p>You could wall mount a monitor.</p>
<p>I think many people are working with laptops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit harder to do that with a laptop.</p>
<p>Some people though will configure a second screen.</p>
<p>You have to decide what&rsquo;s right for you and your budget.</p>
<p>But again, in addition to having a brightly lit room</p>
<p>to be able to focus and attend</p>
<p>to whatever it is you&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>you want to have that screen position high</p>
<p>in your visual environment.</p>
<p>Now you wouldn&rsquo;t want it on the ceiling necessarily.</p>
<p>Oh, that would be pretty cool.</p>
<p>But you do want it above you.</p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of solutions to this</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t involve a wall mount or stacking books or boxes.</p>
<p>For instance, you could be one of those people</p>
<p>that likes to lie in bed or on the sofa</p>
<p>and get your screen up above you</p>
<p>by putting pillows on your knees.</p>
<p>I used to actually do a lot of my writing and work</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do this anymore and I don&rsquo;t recommend it,</p>
<p>but I used to do a lot of work from bed.</p>
<p>Now I no longer bring electronics for work into the bedroom.</p>
<p>I just really try and keep the bedroom for sleeping</p>
<p>or whatever else.</p>
<p>But in terms of lying down on the couch,</p>
<p>it is somewhat easier to get that screen up above you.</p>
<p>You can kind of slide underneath that screen and get typing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem with that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about this a little bit more in a moment,</p>
<p>but it turns out that your posture,</p>
<p>literally the position of your body relative to gravity</p>
<p>also has important implications for how alert you are.</p>
<p>So ideally you would be standing or seated.</p>
<p>I would say the ideal would be standing.</p>
<p>Second best would be seated.</p>
<p>And your screen will be either directly in front of you</p>
<p>or slightly above you.</p>
<p>Or if you wanted to get really fancy,</p>
<p>you could create a situation where it was above you</p>
<p>and slightly tilted toward you</p>
<p>so that you actually had to maintain</p>
<p>kind of proper neck posture.</p>
<p>This accomplishes a number of things.</p>
<p>In addition to making you more alert,</p>
<p>you also get away from the so-called text neck.</p>
<p>You know, people are starting to look more like C&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nowadays, the shape of the letter C,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re constantly looking down.</p>
<p>I do every once in a while sees somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s texting in public with it at eye level.</p>
<p>It always looks a little odd that they&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>but I always admire their posture at the same time.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t give them a hard time.</p>
<p>So this is another feature that you can arrange</p>
<p>into your physical workspace.</p>
<p>Again, whether or not you&rsquo;re seated</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re standing throughout the day,</p>
<p>try and get that screen elevated.</p>
<p>Now, with reference to posture,</p>
<p>there are beautiful data illustrating</p>
<p>that when we are standing up,</p>
<p>those same neurons in our brainstem,</p>
<p>locus coeruleus neurons, which release,</p>
<p>I should mention things like norepinephrine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>those neurons become active when we are standing.</p>
<p>They become even more active when we are ambulatory,</p>
<p>when we are moving, and we will talk about treadmilling</p>
<p>and cycling at your desk and so forth in a little bit.</p>
<p>But when you sit, they become a little less active.</p>
<p>And when you lie down, and indeed,</p>
<p>anytime that you start to get your feet</p>
<p>up above your waist or your head tilted back,</p>
<p>those neurons fire less, and neurons in your brain</p>
<p>that are involved in calming and indeed putting you to sleep</p>
<p>start increasing their level of firing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really beautiful system.</p>
<p>So beautiful, in fact, that there are studies that show</p>
<p>that as you adjust the angle of the body back,</p>
<p>you actually get a sort of dose-dependent increase</p>
<p>in sleepiness and calmness,</p>
<p>and a dose-dependent decrease in alertness.</p>
<p>And so as we were all told to sit up straight</p>
<p>or even better to stand up straight,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m also telling you to get that visual thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re attending to screen or otherwise up</p>
<p>in front of you or ideally above you,</p>
<p>those things combine to generate maximum alertness.</p>
<p>So you can think about how you might work this</p>
<p>into various aspects of your homework environment</p>
<p>or office work environment.</p>
<p>But as I described this, many of you are probably thinking</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m thinking, which is, gosh,</p>
<p>most of what we do is in complete opposite direction</p>
<p>to all of this neurobiologically grounded advice.</p>
<p>Most of us are looking down at our laptop while seated,</p>
<p>or we are lying down, which is going to make us more sleepy,</p>
<p>or we are positioning our computers in front of us,</p>
<p>but we really aren&rsquo;t in an environment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bright enough and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So as you can tell, we&rsquo;re starting to layer in</p>
<p>the various things that you can do.</p>
<p>First, brightness in the room.</p>
<p>Second, get that screen up and try and put yourself</p>
<p>into a posture for work that lends itself</p>
<p>or promotes alertness.</p>
<p>If indeed you want to be alert for that work.</p>
<p>If your goal is to take a nap,</p>
<p>get your feet elevated about 10 to 15 degrees</p>
<p>above your head, maybe put a pillow underneath it,</p>
<p>lie down and take a nap.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking about today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about workspace optimization.</p>
<p>And I suppose you could also exploit that all-nighter trick</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>I actually did this when I was an undergraduate.</p>
<p>I was a little bit masochistic in this way.</p>
<p>I would drink coffee and water at fairly high volume.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t, you know, forced drinking or anything like that,</p>
<p>but I actually wouldn&rsquo;t allow myself to get up</p>
<p>and use the bathroom except on a timer.</p>
<p>So I think the longest I ever went</p>
<p>was like three and a half hours.</p>
<p>It was kind of excruciating.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessarily a healthy advice,</p>
<p>but again, you can use slight,</p>
<p>I mentioned slight over-consumption of fluids</p>
<p>in order to generate alertness.</p>
<p>That was just me really trying to get as much work done</p>
<p>as I could.</p>
<p>I had a very, very demanding class schedule,</p>
<p>and it was just the only way that I could get work done.</p>
<p>If I was getting up every few minutes to use the restroom,</p>
<p>I found it hard to re-engage in that work</p>
<p>and maintain focus,</p>
<p>which is what I just want to briefly mention now.</p>
<p>I talked about this in the episode on focus,</p>
<p>but one thing that is completely unreasonable</p>
<p>and that you should never ask yourself to do</p>
<p>is to sit down or stand up</p>
<p>and immediately focus on something</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re stressed about what you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re very, very excited by it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re very stressed about some sort of information</p>
<p>or a deadline,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re very, very excited about something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that you can focus instantly,</p>
<p>just within a moment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the deployment of neurochemicals</p>
<p>like dopamine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>that bring about our levels of alertness.</p>
<p>However, most of us, including myself,</p>
<p>will go to begin a work bout</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll find that our mind doesn&rsquo;t quite engage</p>
<p>at the level of depth and focus</p>
<p>that we would like right off the bat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve timed this and other studies have timed this</p>
<p>in a more rigorous way.</p>
<p>Mine is just what we call anic data,</p>
<p>but so I&rsquo;ve timed it for myself,</p>
<p>but there are studies that have looked at this.</p>
<p>And the data point to the fact that</p>
<p>even at our most heightened levels of focus,</p>
<p>most people can only maintain focus</p>
<p>before switching tasks for about three minutes,</p>
<p>which is depressingly short period of time.</p>
<p>However, you can extend that period of time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about that in the episode on focus,</p>
<p>but more importantly,</p>
<p>when you sit down to start a work bout of any kind,</p>
<p>any kind,</p>
<p>expect that it would take about six minutes</p>
<p>for you to engage these neural circuits.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t expect yourself to walk into the gym</p>
<p>and do a PR lift or start running and do your best sprint</p>
<p>or just head out the door without warming up at all.</p>
<p>You know, a little walk jog at first,</p>
<p>or, you know, a few warmup sets.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, we expect that.</p>
<p>We are not surprised that we need that.</p>
<p>And yet we sort of expect that our brain</p>
<p>should be able to lock on and do work</p>
<p>in a very focused way immediately.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a ridiculous assumption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unfair assumption, I should say.</p>
<p>So assume that it will take about six minutes</p>
<p>to engage in your work bout</p>
<p>and that those neurochemical systems</p>
<p>will take some time to rev up and engage.</p>
<p>The other things that I&rsquo;m describing</p>
<p>about lighting and screen positioning and posture,</p>
<p>those will also help maximize your focus</p>
<p>and will limit that ramp up time into a focused state.</p>
<p>And I think what you&rsquo;ll find is that</p>
<p>as you maximize your workspace, the time,</p>
<p>the latency, as we say, to get into that focus</p>
<p>will start to shorten.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll especially start to shorten</p>
<p>if you use tools to limit distraction.</p>
<p>We will talk about distraction, but things like Freedom,</p>
<p>which is an app, a free app that allows you</p>
<p>to lock yourself out of the internet</p>
<p>or turning off your phone, for instance.</p>
<p>But even if you&rsquo;re doing work on your phone</p>
<p>or that involves your phone or the internet,</p>
<p>as many of us, including myself do,</p>
<p>expect there to be a ramp up time for you to focus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another aspect of our vision</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely critical for optimizing our workspace.</p>
<p>And that has to do with this really interesting feature</p>
<p>of our visual pathways in that it has two major channels.</p>
<p>Those two major channels have names,</p>
<p>although you don&rsquo;t have to remember the names.</p>
<p>The first one is the so-called Parvo cellular channel,</p>
<p>which is involved in looking at things</p>
<p>at specific points in space</p>
<p>and at high resolution or detail.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the so-called Magnocellular channel</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in looking at big swaths of visual space</p>
<p>and at lower resolution.</p>
<p>So you can think of the Parvo cellular system</p>
<p>as kind of a high pixel density.</p>
<p>Think about your most modern smartphone,</p>
<p>the recent smartphone with the best, best camera,</p>
<p>and think about the Magnocellular system</p>
<p>as being lower resolution,</p>
<p>kind of an older smartphone, lower pixels, et cetera.</p>
<p>You might ask, why would you want a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s low resolution?</p>
<p>Well, the low resolution system is better</p>
<p>at things like detecting motion</p>
<p>and not so much at detail and vice versa.</p>
<p>Now, again, you don&rsquo;t have to remember the names.</p>
<p>What you do have to remember, however,</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re going to create the maximum amount</p>
<p>of alertness in your system,</p>
<p>the maximum amount of ability to focus</p>
<p>when your system is in that Parvo cellular mode.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re bringing your eyes to a common point,</p>
<p>what we call avergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before on the podcast</p>
<p>and people said virgin eye movement.</p>
<p>No, vergence eye movement, as in convergence.</p>
<p>Bringing your eyes to a single point in space</p>
<p>will create a narrower aperture of a visual window,</p>
<p>meaning your visual world actually shrinks,</p>
<p>at least perceptually.</p>
<p>Whereas when you relax your eyes and dilate your gaze,</p>
<p>you can do this now by whatever environment you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>trying to see without moving your head,</p>
<p>off to the side, above, below you, as broadly as possible.</p>
<p>Maybe you can dilate your gaze so much</p>
<p>that you can see yourself, your body,</p>
<p>in that visual environment.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice that your resolution of vision</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t nearly as high as when you do</p>
<p>that vergence eye movement.</p>
<p>Vergence eye movements are incredibly powerful</p>
<p>for creating heightened states of alertness and focus.</p>
<p>And indeed, they create heightened states of cognition,</p>
<p>of thinking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because your brain follows your vision</p>
<p>in terms of focus.</p>
<p>When we say, I can&rsquo;t focus,</p>
<p>what we often are experiencing is an inability, excuse me,</p>
<p>to not focus visually.</p>
<p>Whereas when we are in a very focused state,</p>
<p>we are in a state often where we can focus visually.</p>
<p>Now we can also do this with our auditory system</p>
<p>or to touch, et cetera,</p>
<p>but right now we&rsquo;re just talking about the visual system.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of workspace optimization,</p>
<p>what this means is we never really want to be looking</p>
<p>at a square or rectangle or target area for our work</p>
<p>that is too far beyond our ears.</p>
<p>How far is too far?</p>
<p>Really, you want to try and keep the blinders on,</p>
<p>or I should say the invisible blinders,</p>
<p>so that whatever you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>falls within the region of visual space in front of you</p>
<p>that is present if you were to cup your hands</p>
<p>and put them right next to your eyes.</p>
<p>Now, this is a rough estimation, but I&rsquo;m doing this now.</p>
<p>For those of you that are watching on YouTube,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to simulate it like a horse with blinders on.</p>
<p>For those of you that are listening,</p>
<p>just imagine me looking silly</p>
<p>with my hands cupped near my eyes.</p>
<p>But if we are to, for instance,</p>
<p>look at a screen that&rsquo;s very, very big</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re too close to it,</p>
<p>or even if we&rsquo;re standing back from it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be hard for us to attend</p>
<p>to everything within that screen space.</p>
<p>So this is actually support for the idea</p>
<p>of using a phone or a tablet or a laptop.</p>
<p>My laptop is about 15 inches in diameter,</p>
<p>I think is the one that I have.</p>
<p>Some are 13, some are 17.</p>
<p>Some of you like to use big monitors.</p>
<p>Make sure that whatever it is that you&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>if you want to remain focused,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t extend too far beyond where your eyes are,</p>
<p>the size of your head that is.</p>
<p>So just think blinders on a horse.</p>
<p>And actually that&rsquo;s the reason they put blinders on a horse</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re not looking off into the periphery.</p>
<p>Horses, unlike humans, don&rsquo;t have the same shaped pupil.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a visual system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s organized in quite the same way.</p>
<p>They mostly see in panorama, in magnocellar vision.</p>
<p>And so those blinders are designed</p>
<p>to keep their visual focus straight ahead.</p>
<p>So they physically restrict it.</p>
<p>Now, some people will actually go to lengths</p>
<p>to further restrict their visual focus.</p>
<p>They will do things like putting on a hoodie</p>
<p>or wearing a hat, for instance,</p>
<p>to restrict their visual window.</p>
<p>And indeed that works quite well.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>when you really restrict your visual window</p>
<p>down to a very, very narrow portion of visual space,</p>
<p>that actually changes the types of information</p>
<p>that you are best at processing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about that in terms of something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the cathedral effect in a few moments.</p>
<p>But for now, here&rsquo;s the principle.</p>
<p>Make sure that whatever you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>is directly in front of you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t extend too far out to the side.</p>
<p>Once you get out to say six or 12</p>
<p>or certainly 18 inches on either side of your eyes,</p>
<p>you are dilating your gaze.</p>
<p>By definition, you&rsquo;re dilating your gaze.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely subconscious.</p>
<p>And it becomes very hard to maintain attention.</p>
<p>Now, the caveat to this is that</p>
<p>if you are going to look at a narrow space,</p>
<p>a narrow window for any period of time,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a book or a laptop</p>
<p>or a tablet or a phone,</p>
<p>those virgin&rsquo;s eye movements not only create alertness,</p>
<p>but they also require energy.</p>
<p>And they also can fatigue the eyes</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a process called accommodation</p>
<p>whereby the shape of your eye literally has to change</p>
<p>so that the lens can move</p>
<p>so that you can focus at that location.</p>
<p>Accommodation is an incredible process,</p>
<p>but it is a demanding one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason that your eyes get tired</p>
<p>when you focus on something for too long.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a principle extracted from the ophthalmology</p>
<p>and neuroscience literature that you can adopt.</p>
<p>For every 45 minutes in which you are focusing on something</p>
<p>like a phone or a tablet or a book page</p>
<p>or your computer,</p>
<p>you want to get into magnocellar panoramic vision</p>
<p>for at least five minutes.</p>
<p>And the way that I suggest to do this</p>
<p>is actually to take a walk, ideally outside.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about ambulation, about movement,</p>
<p>and about how that can maintain alertness</p>
<p>throughout the day.</p>
<p>So for every 45 minutes or so,</p>
<p>try and get five minutes of relaxing your eyes.</p>
<p>This is something that&rsquo;s not often done,</p>
<p>especially in today&rsquo;s homeschooling</p>
<p>and where kids are going to school by Zoom</p>
<p>and adults are working by Zoom.</p>
<p>This is a serious problem.</p>
<p>People are getting eye fatigue.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting headaches.</p>
<p>Indeed, some people are getting migraines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re having all sorts of issues, neck pain.</p>
<p>Much of that, if not all of that in some cases,</p>
<p>can be alleviated by this 45 to five rule.</p>
<p>For every 45 minutes of focused work that you do,</p>
<p>get five minutes where you get outside</p>
<p>or if you have to be indoors,</p>
<p>where you can dilate your gaze.</p>
<p>Now, some of you may be saying,</p>
<p>well, that spits in the face of your 90 minute rule.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to, you&rsquo;ve told us before</p>
<p>that we should focus for 90 minutes.</p>
<p>I would still want you to take breaks</p>
<p>within those 90 minutes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at a narrow piece of visual world,</p>
<p>meaning at a phone or a laptop or so forth.</p>
<p>And again, the best way to do this would be to go outside,</p>
<p>just relax your eyes, look off into the distance.</p>
<p>Looking at a horizon will automatically trigger</p>
<p>this panoramic gaze, which is very relaxing to the eyes</p>
<p>and will allow you to go back into a focused work bout.</p>
<p>The one thing you absolutely do not want to do</p>
<p>is to go outside and check your phone</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re outside checking your phone</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re taking a break and checking your phone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still in that virgin&rsquo;s eye movement, okay?</p>
<p>So this is very, very important</p>
<p>because virgin&rsquo;s eye movements increase focus and attention</p>
<p>and you can exploit that to increase focus and attention</p>
<p>when you want to,</p>
<p>but you absolutely need to relax the system.</p>
<p>Again, for every 45 minutes</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;ve been in that focused mode,</p>
<p>you want to get at least five minutes of panoramic vision.</p>
<p>If you can take a 15 minute walk, even better.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to talk about an aspect</p>
<p>of workspace optimization that can actually bias</p>
<p>whether or not our brain and nervous system</p>
<p>are better suited for detailed analytic work</p>
<p>or more abstract work.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a way that you can arrange</p>
<p>your work environment, or I should say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way that you can place yourself</p>
<p>into certain environments that will allow abstract thinking,</p>
<p>creative thinking, and indeed expansive thinking to emerge.</p>
<p>There are other environments</p>
<p>that you can put yourself in</p>
<p>that will make your brain shift towards more analytic work,</p>
<p>toward more detailed and precise types of work.</p>
<p>Now, I just briefly want to mention something</p>
<p>that was covered again on the habits episode</p>
<p>that I did a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>but again, you don&rsquo;t need to see that episode</p>
<p>in order to digest this information.</p>
<p>It goes back to this issue of three phases</p>
<p>within the circadian 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>Phase one, which as I mentioned,</p>
<p>is about zero to eight hours after waking.</p>
<p>Phase two, nine to 16 hours after waking.</p>
<p>And phase three, 17 to 24 hours after waking.</p>
<p>Phase one, being ideal for analytic,</p>
<p>precise, detailed types of work.</p>
<p>Phase two, better suited for most people</p>
<p>for creative kind of abstract thinking,</p>
<p>expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to that,</p>
<p>but most people follow that pattern</p>
<p>because of the different neuromodulators</p>
<p>and hormones and so forth</p>
<p>that are released into the brain and body</p>
<p>at those different phases.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>is a way in which you can use your physical environment</p>
<p>to further shift your brain and nervous system</p>
<p>into a mode that&rsquo;s either primed for analytic</p>
<p>or abstract and creative thinking.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to describe is called the cathedral effect.</p>
<p>The cathedral effect has been discussed,</p>
<p>well, really for many, many decades,</p>
<p>maybe even hundreds of years,</p>
<p>but formally has been discussed since the early 2000s</p>
<p>in which it seemed that people</p>
<p>who were in high ceiling environments,</p>
<p>hence the phrase cathedral,</p>
<p>would shift their thinking and their ideas</p>
<p>to more abstract and creative lofty type thinking.</p>
<p>So literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking,</p>
<p>higher aspirations that this was observed</p>
<p>in terms of the language that they use,</p>
<p>but also the sorts of ideas that they would generate.</p>
<p>And conversely,</p>
<p>that people that were in lower ceiling environments</p>
<p>would be more oriented toward using language</p>
<p>that was more restricted, literally more detailed,</p>
<p>analytic about things in their immediate space.</p>
<p>Now, this seems kind of wild on the one hand,</p>
<p>but actually if we go back to our understanding</p>
<p>of the neurobiology of the visual system</p>
<p>and the way that our brains and bodies evolved</p>
<p>in different environments,</p>
<p>it actually makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to go into a long lecture</p>
<p>about evolutionary neurobiology,</p>
<p>but we have to remember that our nervous system</p>
<p>has a number of features</p>
<p>that are adapted to different environments.</p>
<p>And indeed we are able to go from big open prairies</p>
<p>or mountaintops or large cathedrals or concert halls</p>
<p>into small environments and everything scales with it.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re outdoors in a big expansive space,</p>
<p>our vision tends to go long.</p>
<p>We tend to be in panoramic, magnocellar vision.</p>
<p>Our hearing tends to extend long.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re having a conversation with somebody,</p>
<p>we tend to also be attending somewhat</p>
<p>to the screech of hawks off in the distance</p>
<p>or to the rush of a river.</p>
<p>Whereas when we were in small spaces,</p>
<p>everything, our vision, our hearing,</p>
<p>and indeed even our physical movements</p>
<p>become more restrained,</p>
<p>even if we can still extend our hands out as far as we want.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in an elevator.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a small space compared to outside on a field.</p>
<p>This has been measured over and over again.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s, the size or the amplitude</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s spontaneous movements</p>
<p>actually scales down in smaller environments,</p>
<p>even if they aren&rsquo;t completely restricted</p>
<p>from extending their limbs all the way.</p>
<p>Whereas when we were outdoors,</p>
<p>we feel a natural impulse to move further away</p>
<p>from our body, our torso with our limbs.</p>
<p>This is just feels like more appropriate behavior.</p>
<p>And when I say appropriate,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean in any kind of social context necessarily.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a reason for this.</p>
<p>The visual system and the so-called vestibular motor system</p>
<p>are intimately linked.</p>
<p>And I can just tell you briefly one way</p>
<p>in which you can test this and observe this</p>
<p>and even use this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little off topic from today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say you have a certain amount of flexibility.</p>
<p>You can extend your arms off like wings</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m doing for those either listening, not watching,</p>
<p>off to your sides with arms straight.</p>
<p>And you have, you reach a maximum positioning of flexibility.</p>
<p>You can do a quick experiment where you sit still,</p>
<p>you would bring your arms in for a moment.</p>
<p>You can put them on your knees if you like,</p>
<p>or in front of you.</p>
<p>And you can move your eyes very far off</p>
<p>into the periphery of your visual field.</p>
<p>So you actually, I&rsquo;m going to do this now.</p>
<p>It looks kind of silly, but moving my eyes</p>
<p>without moving my head off into the periphery,</p>
<p>all the way to the right, then all the way to the left,</p>
<p>all the way up, all the way down,</p>
<p>but especially all the way to the left,</p>
<p>almost looking over my shoulder without turning my head</p>
<p>all the way to my right.</p>
<p>And you will find that you actually can extend</p>
<p>your arms further back subsequent to that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not magic.</p>
<p>It has to do with the ways in which your cerebellum,</p>
<p>which actually means mini brain,</p>
<p>and your eyes, your visual system are connected,</p>
<p>and the way in which your cerebellum controls</p>
<p>some of the spindles and other aspects</p>
<p>of the neuromuscular architecture of your nervous system,</p>
<p>because your nerves control your muscles,</p>
<p>and allow those muscles to move further out.</p>
<p>So for those of you that lack flexibility,</p>
<p>you can actually exploit your visual system for this.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s, again, a bit of a tangent,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a fun one that relates back</p>
<p>to this so-called cathedral effect.</p>
<p>The cathedral effect is a way in which our thinking</p>
<p>becomes more restricted and restrained in tighter,</p>
<p>smaller, more confined visual environments.</p>
<p>Or if the ceiling is higher, we are in expansive space</p>
<p>with a lot of distance above us, or space above us,</p>
<p>and out to the sides, maybe even out on a field,</p>
<p>our thinking goes into these more broad, abstract,</p>
<p>and kind of loftier future thinking in particular.</p>
<p>This has actually been measured.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really nice paper.</p>
<p>I will post a link to this.</p>
<p>The authors are Joan Myers Levy and Rui,</p>
<p>and then in parentheses, Juliet Zhu.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to assume that they go by Juliet.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is the influence of ceiling height,</p>
<p>the effect of priming on the type of processing</p>
<p>that people use.</p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t go into all the details of this paper,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s really cool about this paper</p>
<p>is they looked with very rigorous statistics,</p>
<p>and they have a fair number of subjects,</p>
<p>everything about this paper looks solid to me,</p>
<p>at the difference in cognitive processing,</p>
<p>and abstract thinking, and detailed analytic work</p>
<p>that people are able to perform in environments</p>
<p>that have a 10-foot ceiling versus an eight-foot ceiling,</p>
<p>which is not that much of a difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just two-foot difference there.</p>
<p>And what they found were significant effects</p>
<p>whereby high ceilings activate concepts</p>
<p>related to abstraction,</p>
<p>whereas low ceilings prime confinement-related concepts,</p>
<p>but promote the kind of detailed thinking</p>
<p>that lends itself well to sort of spreadsheet-type work</p>
<p>or accounting-type work,</p>
<p>whereas abstract creative work</p>
<p>was supported by these higher ceilings.</p>
<p>And the way they analyzed this was really interesting.</p>
<p>Again, we don&rsquo;t have time to go into all the details,</p>
<p>but they asked people to sort of generate word sets</p>
<p>related to particular topics like sports.</p>
<p>And, you know, so people would talk about soccer, football,</p>
<p>baseball, golf, et cetera,</p>
<p>and talk about some of the equipment and other things.</p>
<p>And then they had a kind of a challenge,</p>
<p>a cognitive challenge,</p>
<p>whereby people had to link different concepts</p>
<p>along different dimensions</p>
<p>so that you depart from the dimension of sport</p>
<p>and you start thinking about, you know,</p>
<p>sports that involve teams</p>
<p>or sports that involve a ball, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so in the same conditions,</p>
<p>you can, except for the fact that the ceiling height</p>
<p>is different, eight feet or 10 feet,</p>
<p>what one finds is that the kinds of language</p>
<p>and the kinds of associations that people start to create</p>
<p>are vastly different.</p>
<p>And there are actually two experiments in this study.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to go look at it.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t just about sports.</p>
<p>There were some other things that were analyzed as well.</p>
<p>And in the references of this paper,</p>
<p>it also points to other examples now</p>
<p>of the cathedral effect,</p>
<p>which I find very interesting</p>
<p>because as a vision scientist</p>
<p>and someone who spends his life thinking about</p>
<p>and indeed talking about the nervous system,</p>
<p>we know that our cognition follows our vision.</p>
<p>For low vision or blind people,</p>
<p>it will follow mostly their hearing</p>
<p>and to some extent their touch.</p>
<p>But for most people who are sighted,</p>
<p>as most people are sighted,</p>
<p>our cognition follows our visual environment.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for workspace optimization?</p>
<p>Well, most of us have a fixed ceiling level in our home,</p>
<p>but you might have rooms in which the ceiling is higher</p>
<p>and rooms in which the ceiling is lower.</p>
<p>If that were the case,</p>
<p>I recommend if you want to do creative work during phase two,</p>
<p>the nine to 16 hours of your circadian cycle,</p>
<p>nine to 16 hours after waking that is,</p>
<p>that you do that in the high ceiling room</p>
<p>or maybe even outdoors out on a deck or on a patio</p>
<p>because the highest ceiling of course is the sky.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re going to do detailed analytic work in,</p>
<p>I would suggest doing that during phase one of the day,</p>
<p>but even if you&rsquo;re going to do it during phase two</p>
<p>of the day, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>scheduling or other sorts of constraints,</p>
<p>that you do that in the lower ceiling environment.</p>
<p>Now, if you are interested in controlling</p>
<p>the height of your visual world,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have control over the ceiling height</p>
<p>of the environment that you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another way to do that.</p>
<p>And I used to observe this in the cafes</p>
<p>and around Stanford in the Bay Area,</p>
<p>where you would see somebody who,</p>
<p>despite the weather would be in a hoodie,</p>
<p>maybe with a baseball cap or other form of hat</p>
<p>or some sort of blinder above their eyebrows,</p>
<p>which is actually another way of just lowering</p>
<p>the ceiling height very, very low</p>
<p>and restricting your visual field.</p>
<p>Not unlike blinders that we talked about before</p>
<p>that one would put on a horse</p>
<p>or one would put on themselves</p>
<p>by restricting their visual angle of focus</p>
<p>to directly in front of them,</p>
<p>but not too far out beyond the sides of their head.</p>
<p>So these cathedral effects I think can be leveraged</p>
<p>toward doing particular types of work best.</p>
<p>And again, the lower the ceiling</p>
<p>or the lower your visual environment,</p>
<p>the more that one tends to do,</p>
<p>or I should say performs detailed analytic work accurately.</p>
<p>And the more that one&rsquo;s thinking is oriented</p>
<p>towards detailed sort of correct answer type work.</p>
<p>Whereas when the ceiling is higher or there&rsquo;s no ceiling,</p>
<p>the more that the brain and the rest of the processing</p>
<p>that we call cognitive processing</p>
<p>is related to abstract reasoning, brainstorming,</p>
<p>and indeed can pull from broader swaths of memory resources.</p>
<p>Because really what abstract reasoning is,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s taking existing elements and maneuvering them</p>
<p>or arranging them into novel ways.</p>
<p>So you can think about like notes on a piano,</p>
<p>playing a particular song, learning scales.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very analytic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a correct answer that you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to arrive at or generate.</p>
<p>Whereas writing music or writing poetry</p>
<p>or generating new material of any kind</p>
<p>involves taking existing elements, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to use words</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have committed to your memory</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re not aware of</p>
<p>and arranging them in novel ways.</p>
<p>So I think the cathedral effect can be leveraged.</p>
<p>And again, you don&rsquo;t need to move into a different home</p>
<p>or build a slanted roof and work at one side of the room</p>
<p>at one part of the day</p>
<p>and the other side of the room at the other.</p>
<p>Although if that&rsquo;s the way you want to swing it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Most of us don&rsquo;t have that flexibility,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that the height of the ceiling</p>
<p>of the visual environment that we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>has a profound effect on the types of cognitive processes</p>
<p>that we are able to engage.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to shift our attention</p>
<p>to the auditory environment or the noise in the room</p>
<p>or the music in the room</p>
<p>or the music or noise in the headphones,</p>
<p>because it turns out that there is a lot</p>
<p>of quality scientific data out there</p>
<p>that speaks to whether or not listening to particular sounds</p>
<p>can enhance our cognition.</p>
<p>And indeed the answer is yes,</p>
<p>but there are very particular types of things to listen to</p>
<p>under very particular types of conditions</p>
<p>that allow one to do that.</p>
<p>First off, I want to say that people vary tremendously</p>
<p>in the extent to which they can tolerate</p>
<p>background noise for work.</p>
<p>In fact, individuals will vary tremendously</p>
<p>from one day to the next or even within the same day</p>
<p>in the extent to which they can tolerate background noise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this myself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been times in which I&rsquo;ve been working at home</p>
<p>and I felt like for whatever reason,</p>
<p>I just could not engage in focus.</p>
<p>And what worked to generate more focus for me</p>
<p>was to go to a cafe or to a library</p>
<p>or someplace where there&rsquo;s actually more commotion,</p>
<p>more people moving about, maybe even more noise,</p>
<p>maybe even music in the room.</p>
<p>And we have to all be in touch</p>
<p>with when we want more background noise</p>
<p>or when we want less background noise.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule.</p>
<p>If you look across the literature</p>
<p>for studies that involve complete silence or white noise</p>
<p>or binaural beats or music or classical music</p>
<p>or rock and roll,</p>
<p>you can find results to support any type of environment</p>
<p>as being more beneficial.</p>
<p>However, as we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>there are a few types of environments to really avoid</p>
<p>and a few types of sounds that really can</p>
<p>enhance the cognition and your ability to focus</p>
<p>in your workspace environment across the board</p>
<p>that really seem to work for all people.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about background noise to avoid.</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;re talking about background noise to avoid</p>
<p>because it actually can cause</p>
<p>some pretty severe deficits in cognition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a paper, first author, Jordan Love, cool name,</p>
<p>last author, Alexander Francis.</p>
<p>The title of the paper has to do</p>
<p>with psychophysiological responses</p>
<p>to potentially annoying heating, ventilation</p>
<p>and air conditioning noise during mentally demanding work,</p>
<p>which is a mouthful.</p>
<p>But basically what this paper identifies</p>
<p>is a large data set in which workplace</p>
<p>and environmental noise,</p>
<p>mostly the humming of air conditioners that&rsquo;s very loud</p>
<p>or the humming of heaters that&rsquo;s very loud</p>
<p>and ongoing, just incessant, doesn&rsquo;t let up,</p>
<p>can really increase mental fatigue</p>
<p>and can vastly decrease cognitive performance.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in looking</p>
<p>at the cognitive performance data,</p>
<p>the authors are Banbury and Berry, 2005.</p>
<p>That paper is the one that supports the fact</p>
<p>that cognitive performance is worse</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s just the hum of an air conditioner</p>
<p>in the background or the hum of a heater</p>
<p>and otherwise complete silence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also evidence,</p>
<p>which I discussed on the episode about hearing,</p>
<p>which is that in young children,</p>
<p>white noise can cause some impairments</p>
<p>in the development of the auditory system.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want parents to freak out.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re exposed to white noise as a sleep aid,</p>
<p>as a child, which I know many of you were, don&rsquo;t freak out.</p>
<p>But it turns out that white noise,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s loud white noise,</p>
<p>can cause some disruption in the auditory maps,</p>
<p>the representation of different frequencies of sound</p>
<p>in the brain that can lead to some deficits</p>
<p>in auditory and even language processing.</p>
<p>So we really have to be careful about long-term exposure,</p>
<p>extended exposure to white noise</p>
<p>or kind of a air conditioning noise</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really at a high level.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t worry if it&rsquo;s in the background</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s shutting off and turning on again</p>
<p>as the thermostat kicks off and on,</p>
<p>but really trying to avoid work in loud fan-filled</p>
<p>or ventilation generating or heat generating environments,</p>
<p>because it really can cause damage</p>
<p>to the auditory system long-term.</p>
<p>And as we described, it can impair cognitive performance</p>
<p>and overall increased fatigue.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve all experienced that when you&rsquo;re in a room</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some ongoing background noise</p>
<p>and all of a sudden it stops</p>
<p>and you just feel this enormous relief.</p>
<p>And the reason for this is that our auditory system</p>
<p>has a parallel to our visual system.</p>
<p>In our visual system, that light entering the eyes</p>
<p>triggers the activation of those melanopsin cells,</p>
<p>which triggers activation of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>a particular area of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which generates alertness,</p>
<p>generates the release even of cortisol, a stress hormone.</p>
<p>In the auditory system, when there&rsquo;s ongoing sound,</p>
<p>your auditory system hears that</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not paying attention to it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re paying attention to something else,</p>
<p>it still registers those little hair cells</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called in your inner ear</p>
<p>are fluttering the eardrum is beating</p>
<p>and in concert to that sound frequency.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a brainstem mechanism that generates alertness</p>
<p>and a kind of vigilance.</p>
<p>So when you have a sound that&rsquo;s ongoing in the background,</p>
<p>it shuts off.</p>
<p>All of a sudden you experience that piece,</p>
<p>which is the turning off of those brainstem circuits</p>
<p>that are associated with vigilance.</p>
<p>The locus coeruleus, which we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>which release epinephrine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>and generate that heightened state of alertness</p>
<p>in your brain and body.</p>
<p>Those neurons then can turn off</p>
<p>and you experience that as relaxation.</p>
<p>So does that mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t listen to white noise</p>
<p>or pink noise or brown noise while we&rsquo;re working?</p>
<p>Certainly a lot of people do.</p>
<p>In fact, if you want to know what white noise,</p>
<p>pink noise and brown noise are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just different constellations</p>
<p>of auditory frequencies that are played together.</p>
<p>Most of us think of white noise as the shh on a screen,</p>
<p>you know, all the black and white pixels going all around,</p>
<p>like they call it visual snow.</p>
<p>But pink noise has certain sound frequencies</p>
<p>notched out, taken out.</p>
<p>Brown noise has others.</p>
<p>It has different frequencies that are included</p>
<p>at higher amplitude, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can look this stuff up on YouTube if you want.</p>
<p>You just put brown noise.</p>
<p>None of it sounds terrific.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound like music.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally just noise, mixed frequencies</p>
<p>and no particular arrangement.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that playing white noise</p>
<p>in the background or on headphones or pink noise</p>
<p>or brown noise can facilitate cognition,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mainly through an increase in this overall alertness</p>
<p>as a consequence of areas like locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and other brainstem areas that are associated</p>
<p>with autonomic arousal from that noise.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot like the air conditioner effect.</p>
<p>And I think done in a restricted way,</p>
<p>meaning not for hours and hours,</p>
<p>but maybe if your focus is waning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re having a hard time engaging in work,</p>
<p>you might put on some brown noise or white noise</p>
<p>or pink noise and work that way for 45 minutes or so</p>
<p>before you go to your panoramic vision walk</p>
<p>and get some sunlight.</p>
<p>That should be fine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no reason to suspect, however,</p>
<p>that those particular patterns of noise</p>
<p>are going to optimize particular mental functions.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;d like to turn to next</p>
<p>are particular patterns of sounds</p>
<p>that indeed have been shown in peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>to optimize certain types of mental processing,</p>
<p>because you can incorporate these</p>
<p>into your optimized workspace environment</p>
<p>through headphones or through speakers,</p>
<p>whatever mechanism that you want</p>
<p>in order to get more out of your work efforts.</p>
<p>If you were to search for apps or go online</p>
<p>and try and find sounds that can improve thinking</p>
<p>or change your emotions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re generally going to find three types.</p>
<p>One are called isochronic tones.</p>
<p>These are tones usually of a common frequency.</p>
<p>So it might be a beep and then a pause</p>
<p>and then a beep of the same frequency</p>
<p>and then beep, forgive my terrible beeping.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what good beeping would sound like,</p>
<p>but contrast isochronic tones with monaural beats.</p>
<p>Monaural beats would be repetitive,</p>
<p>almost percussive-like beats delivered to just one ear.</p>
<p>Toon, toon, toon, toon, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,</p>
<p>this kind of thing, okay?</p>
<p>You can find apps that can deliver monaural beats.</p>
<p>You can find also apps that deliver so-called binaural beats.</p>
<p>You can also find YouTube scripts or channels</p>
<p>that will deliver binaural beats.</p>
<p>Binaural beats, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>are beats delivered to the two ears.</p>
<p>One pattern of kind of percussive beat to one ear</p>
<p>and a different pattern,</p>
<p>or at least a pattern that&rsquo;s out of phase,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not synchronized, delivered to the other ear.</p>
<p>So on one ear, you hear do, do, do, do, do, do, do,</p>
<p>and in the other ear, you&rsquo;ve got doon, doon, doon.</p>
<p>And what happens is because of the way</p>
<p>that the auditory system converges in the brainstem</p>
<p>and generates what are called intraoral time differences,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what that means in a moment,</p>
<p>intraoral time differences,</p>
<p>the difference between the two patterns of beats</p>
<p>that are heard by each of the two different ears</p>
<p>leads to a third pattern that the brain entrains to</p>
<p>and kind of maps onto</p>
<p>and generates particular types of brain waves, okay?</p>
<p>So without going into a lot of detail,</p>
<p>intraoral time differences are the ways in which</p>
<p>if you were to hear something off to your right,</p>
<p>like I just snapped my finger</p>
<p>just to the right of my right ear,</p>
<p>that a signal arrives in my right ear</p>
<p>before that sound signal,</p>
<p>those sound waves arrive in my left ear.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an intraoral between ears time difference.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a brainstem area in which signals from one ear</p>
<p>and signals from the other ear converge,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s literally a math done by your nervous system</p>
<p>that says this signal arrived before the other signal.</p>
<p>And the difference between those signals</p>
<p>is the intraoral time difference.</p>
<p>So if I were to snap my fingers on both sides,</p>
<p>on my left and on my right side at the exact same time,</p>
<p>and they arrive at the same time,</p>
<p>the intraoral time difference is zero.</p>
<p>Whereas if one goes first on the right and then the left,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m terrible at snapping on the left,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weak snap, but it was there.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a delay in the intraoral time difference</p>
<p>has a particular value.</p>
<p>Okay, you get it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost ridiculously simple.</p>
<p>Binaural beats have been generated in ways</p>
<p>that create a particular pattern</p>
<p>of intraoral time differences that then cascades</p>
<p>up to the rest of the brain and puts the forebrain</p>
<p>and other areas of the brain that are involved</p>
<p>in cognition and action into a particular rhythm.</p>
<p>And some of the rhythms or waves of brain activity</p>
<p>are ones that you may have heard of,</p>
<p>things like alpha waves or theta waves or gamma waves.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t like to get too attached</p>
<p>to particular brain waves as excellent</p>
<p>for particular kinds of thinking.</p>
<p>This is something that was really popular</p>
<p>in the nineties and two thousands,</p>
<p>when ways of measuring brain activity non-invasively</p>
<p>with electrodes on the outside enabled people</p>
<p>to identify the indeed alpha brain waves are associated</p>
<p>with alertness states and some are other brain waves</p>
<p>that are kind of larger amplitude slow waves</p>
<p>like delta waves are associated with kind</p>
<p>of sleepiness or relaxation.</p>
<p>But in general, the way that the brain works</p>
<p>is that different brain waves are generated</p>
<p>in different structures at different times.</p>
<p>And those combine to give us a sense of happiness</p>
<p>or give us a sense of focus</p>
<p>or give us a sense of creativity.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you look across the board</p>
<p>at the studies of binaural beats and you ask</p>
<p>what sorts of binaural beats appear to be useful</p>
<p>for people to enhance their brain function</p>
<p>for particular kinds of tasks,</p>
<p>we arrive at some very interesting answers.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll review what those are now.</p>
<p>The frequency of binaural beats that appears</p>
<p>to bring about improved cognitive functioning</p>
<p>at the level of memory, improved reaction times</p>
<p>and improved verbal recall seems to be 40 Hertz.</p>
<p>Now, is it exactly 40 Hertz?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if one wants to look up a great reference on this,</p>
<p>the reference Colzatto, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al. 2017</p>
<p>describes in here, I&rsquo;m quoting.</p>
<p>So this is a direct quote.</p>
<p>The present findings are in line with those</p>
<p>of a recent study, which also found faster reaction times</p>
<p>in participants that listened to binaural beats of 40 Hertz.</p>
<p>And you can find many examples of this in the literature</p>
<p>where binaural beats of about 40 Hertz</p>
<p>or exactly 40 Hertz in some cases,</p>
<p>somehow brought the brain into a state</p>
<p>that made it optimal for learning, for memory</p>
<p>and for certain types of recall, including verbal recall,</p>
<p>math learning, et cetera.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are interested in binaural beats,</p>
<p>there are a number of free apps out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to recommend any in particular.</p>
<p>You just have to search for one that you happen to like.</p>
<p>One thing that you will find is that many of those apps</p>
<p>superimpose binaural beats onto raindrops or ocean sounds,</p>
<p>or rather they superimpose ocean sounds</p>
<p>and raindrops onto the binaural beats.</p>
<p>That does not appear to be as effective</p>
<p>as pure binaural beats.</p>
<p>There has been an exploration</p>
<p>of lower frequency binaural beats.</p>
<p>So for instance, seven Hertz,</p>
<p>which is theta binaural beats done for 30 minutes</p>
<p>with an overlay of rain sound or rain sounds only,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been analyzed.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>that showed immediate recall memory</p>
<p>was significantly decreased, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a negative effect of binaural beats on memory.</p>
<p>So the idea that binaural beats are just great</p>
<p>for us across the board, I think is wrong.</p>
<p>It does appear that the higher frequency binaural beats</p>
<p>as one moves up toward 40 Hertz</p>
<p>are going to be the most beneficial.</p>
<p>There are instances in which, for instance,</p>
<p>15 Hertz binaural beats increased response accuracy</p>
<p>on a spatial verbal memory task.</p>
<p>This is a complicated working memory task.</p>
<p>Working memory is the kind of memory</p>
<p>of remembering a phone number.</p>
<p>So if I say, for instance, 4932931,</p>
<p>and you have to remember that number,</p>
<p>keeping it online is what we call your working memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely that you would forget</p>
<p>that two or three days later.</p>
<p>You can get improvements in working memory</p>
<p>with 15 Hertz binaural beats.</p>
<p>Whereas the other control conditions,</p>
<p>five Hertz and 10 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>all decreased accuracy of working memory.</p>
<p>However, when I look at the literature</p>
<p>and I examined a number of different studies,</p>
<p>what I always seem to come back to</p>
<p>was that 40 Hertz or so, plus or minus five Hertz</p>
<p>seem to be optimal for generating improvements</p>
<p>in cognition, in math performance,</p>
<p>and even in various types of memory recall</p>
<p>and even in musical performance.</p>
<p>You might wonder, well,</p>
<p>how can people do musical performance</p>
<p>that are listening to binaural beats?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another surprise.</p>
<p>Many of the studies that I looked at</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have people listening to binaural beats</p>
<p>while they were doing the tasks,</p>
<p>the memory task or the music learning, et cetera.</p>
<p>They would do it beforehand for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>There were instances in which people</p>
<p>were listening to binaural beats during the task.</p>
<p>But if you decide to employ binaural beats,</p>
<p>I recommend this 40 Hertz as a great place to start.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend doing it for all of your work bouts.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a good reason to believe</p>
<p>that you could attenuate to it.</p>
<p>But if you are going to try it,</p>
<p>you might try it both ways.</p>
<p>You might try listening to binaural beats</p>
<p>for about 30 minutes while doing something else,</p>
<p>and then maybe eating lunch or something of that sort</p>
<p>or taking a walk and then going into the work bout.</p>
<p>Because remember, the moment that you start listening</p>
<p>to these binaural beats,</p>
<p>the brain doesn&rsquo;t immediately switch</p>
<p>into a particular pattern of oscillation or brainwaves.</p>
<p>It takes some time.</p>
<p>Neural circuits, again, take time to engage.</p>
<p>The only neural circuits that are going to engage instantly</p>
<p>are going to be the ones</p>
<p>that are of a sort of reflexive sort.</p>
<p>Like you step on a sharp object</p>
<p>and you have to retract your limb,</p>
<p>or you suddenly are stressed by a distressing text message,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re suddenly delighted about a delightful text message.</p>
<p>But when it comes to shifting your whole brain state</p>
<p>toward optimizing work, it takes a little bit of time.</p>
<p>So again, 40 Hertz, binaural beats, many, many apps,</p>
<p>many YouTube scripts out there,</p>
<p>probably other resources for binaural beats,</p>
<p>hopefully zero costs.</p>
<p>You can access those without any need</p>
<p>to shell out any money.</p>
<p>If you find one that you particularly like,</p>
<p>maybe put it in the comment section</p>
<p>so other people can find it.</p>
<p>YouTube would be the best place to do that.</p>
<p>Feel free to put a link or just a description.</p>
<p>That would be wonderful.</p>
<p>And again, you don&rsquo;t need to listen to binaural beats</p>
<p>at the exact same time that you&rsquo;re doing the work,</p>
<p>although that could also enhance your productivity.</p>
<p>Some of you out there might be craving</p>
<p>a little bit more mechanism by which binaural beats</p>
<p>can influence things like focus or reduced reaction time.</p>
<p>This has actually been explored.</p>
<p>This 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern</p>
<p>seems to have an effect on what&rsquo;s called striatal dopamine.</p>
<p>We have dopamine as a neuromodulator, of course,</p>
<p>involved in many things in motivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually involved in adaptation to light in the retina,</p>
<p>something that most people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s involved in movement,</p>
<p>which is why people with Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who have a depletion of dopamine neurons</p>
<p>actually have movement deficits and so on.</p>
<p>But striatal dopamine is closely related</p>
<p>to motivation and focus.</p>
<p>And 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>appears to increase striatal dopamine release.</p>
<p>And this has actually been measured indirectly</p>
<p>by what we call spontaneous blink rate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been accused in various Instagram posts</p>
<p>and even on this podcast of being a non-blinker,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it, or a minimal blinker.</p>
<p>And as an important aside,</p>
<p>there is no evidence whatsoever</p>
<p>that people that don&rsquo;t blink very much are sociopaths</p>
<p>or lie.</p>
<p>Also, you will hear that people who blink a lot</p>
<p>are sociopaths and are lying.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no evidence that blink frequency</p>
<p>correlates with anything except alertness.</p>
<p>Now, longer blinks are associated with less alertness.</p>
<p>As we get tired, we tend to blink longer and longer</p>
<p>until we take the long blink that is sleep.</p>
<p>I guess the long blink would be death,</p>
<p>but the long-ish blink would be sleep.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the more firing</p>
<p>of striatal dopamine neurons that&rsquo;s occurring,</p>
<p>the more frequently we blink.</p>
<p>And so it is associated with a resetting</p>
<p>of our visual window.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens when we blink.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole relationship</p>
<p>between blinking and time perception</p>
<p>that we covered in the episode on time perception.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the bottom line for sake of this discussion.</p>
<p>40 Hertz binaural beats appears</p>
<p>to increase spontaneous blink rates</p>
<p>because it increases dopamine transmission</p>
<p>in the brainstem and in the striatum,</p>
<p>in several locations, in fact.</p>
<p>And so the way in which these binaural beats</p>
<p>set a rhythm in the brain recruits dopamine release</p>
<p>that dopamine release leads to heightened levels</p>
<p>of motivation and focus.</p>
<p>Why motivation and focus?</p>
<p>Well, dopamine is actually the substrate</p>
<p>by which epinephrine is made.</p>
<p>Dopamine, the molecule is actually converted</p>
<p>into epinephrine, adrenaline.</p>
<p>And they work together like close cousins,</p>
<p>dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>in order to put us on a path of movement</p>
<p>or if we are doing work of mental movement toward a goal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little bit of mechanistic meat</p>
<p>to explain at least part of the reason</p>
<p>why 40 Hertz binaural beats can enhance our focus,</p>
<p>reduce our reaction times</p>
<p>and improve indeed learning and memory.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to talk about the role of movement</p>
<p>in optimizing our workspace</p>
<p>and whether or not standing, sitting,</p>
<p>lying down, treadmilling, or even believe it or not,</p>
<p>cycling can enhance our work output and performance.</p>
<p>Before we do that, I want to touch on two aspects</p>
<p>of optimizing workspace that will come up at some point</p>
<p>in your work or school life.</p>
<p>Alas, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of science around this,</p>
<p>but I think they are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>And I think I can offer a little bit of advice</p>
<p>in terms of how to navigate these</p>
<p>in a way that would be beneficial to you.</p>
<p>The first one is interruptions.</p>
<p>You know, if you go online and you ask about,</p>
<p>you know, how to avoid interruptions,</p>
<p>people will say, okay, well, if you have kids at home,</p>
<p>or even if you don&rsquo;t, or at work,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a light like a recording,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re recording is on, we&rsquo;re busy now,</p>
<p>or have a sign on the door that says,</p>
<p>bother only in the case of emergency or fine to knock</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t knock at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used a different policy throughout the years.</p>
<p>I am somebody who works pretty hard</p>
<p>to control my time and focus.</p>
<p>But of course, as a laboratory director,</p>
<p>I have people coming by and who want to talk about things.</p>
<p>And of course we have phones and we have computers</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s opportunity to reach us.</p>
<p>Interruptions really are deadly</p>
<p>to our ability to generate focus.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about the distraction</p>
<p>that occurs of say a minute or two minutes or five minutes</p>
<p>when we were interrupted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about the additional time</p>
<p>to get those brain circuits re-engaged to a mode of focus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really kind of a double whammy.</p>
<p>Now, none of us, including myself,</p>
<p>want to be harsh or cruel or shut off from the world.</p>
<p>And oftentimes interruptions bring incredible insights</p>
<p>and people are providing support</p>
<p>and very useful things that are essential to my workday</p>
<p>and presumably to your workday and school day as well.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a simple method that I learned</p>
<p>from my graduate advisor that works very, very well.</p>
<p>Again, no peer review data support it.</p>
<p>This is just my experience.</p>
<p>But this is somebody who had immense powers of focus,</p>
<p>had a very, very demanding life, a long commute,</p>
<p>two children, extensive laboratory, et cetera.</p>
<p>And what she would do was if I came by and asked a question</p>
<p>or if anyone came by and asked a question,</p>
<p>she would acknowledge their presence</p>
<p>but would not shift her body toward them.</p>
<p>So she purposely did not position her computer</p>
<p>facing the door, which I think is a deadly,</p>
<p>or I should say deadly to focus way</p>
<p>of positioning your workspace.</p>
<p>So her computer was facing the wall.</p>
<p>The door was perpendicular to that.</p>
<p>And I would come by and I say, I have a question.</p>
<p>And she would say, yes.</p>
<p>So she would acknowledge my presence,</p>
<p>but she wouldn&rsquo;t actually orient her body toward me,</p>
<p>which told me that this conversation</p>
<p>was not going to last very long.</p>
<p>And no matter how long I stood there or what I asked,</p>
<p>she would never orient toward me,</p>
<p>which generally kept these conversations very, very short.</p>
<p>We had other designated meetings</p>
<p>where we would be face-to-face.</p>
<p>The other approach, which I confess colleagues of mine</p>
<p>have used before, not necessarily at Stanford,</p>
<p>but elsewhere is to simply say no</p>
<p>to everything that somebody requests or comes by.</p>
<p>So if someone would knock on the door,</p>
<p>they would just shout no through the door.</p>
<p>Or if someone would say, can I bother you for a second?</p>
<p>They would say no.</p>
<p>Or if someone would say, I have something I want to tell you,</p>
<p>they would just say no.</p>
<p>And they would just continue doing this</p>
<p>until the person went away.</p>
<p>That was actually very effective.</p>
<p>These were some of the most productive people I know,</p>
<p>not always the kindest people,</p>
<p>but some of them were very kind.</p>
<p>The other approach that I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>and actually this is an approach that was used</p>
<p>by someone who has been a guest</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s immensely productive,</p>
<p>was that he, so I&rsquo;m constraining who this might be</p>
<p>by saying he, he actually,</p>
<p>despite having the option to have a very large office,</p>
<p>would place himself in a workspace</p>
<p>that was literally a coat closet,</p>
<p>cleared out with a desk, small lamp, completely dark.</p>
<p>So this violates everything that I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>or prior to this,</p>
<p>everything about high ceilings, bright light, et cetera,</p>
<p>and would work, still works,</p>
<p>underneath a desk lamp in a completely dark closet,</p>
<p>minimal ventilation.</p>
<p>This is my definition of hell.</p>
<p>And yet is one of the most productive people on the planet.</p>
<p>Also very, very hard to find.</p>
<p>I actually know where his closet is.</p>
<p>And it turns out he has several of them</p>
<p>that he migrates from in order to avoid distractions.</p>
<p>So I mentioned these as kind of extremes.</p>
<p>I think that most of us exist on the other extreme.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I mentioned it,</p>
<p>which is that most of us like some social engagement</p>
<p>and kind of welcome,</p>
<p>or at least set our work environment</p>
<p>in a way that welcomes interruption.</p>
<p>And we have to be very, very careful about this.</p>
<p>Now in the digital realm,</p>
<p>I already mentioned a few of the things that we can do</p>
<p>as practical tools to limit interruptions.</p>
<p>One is to use the program Freedom.</p>
<p>The other would be to simply turn off the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>If you do need to be online and navigating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing research of any kind,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to be possible.</p>
<p>Turning off one&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve at times put my phone on airplane mode.</p>
<p>If that didn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;ve locked it in a safe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve left it in the car outside.</p>
<p>It all depends on one&rsquo;s levels of self-discipline,</p>
<p>which as you probably know from your own experience,</p>
<p>tends to kind of wax and wane.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are better</p>
<p>at avoiding these distractions than others.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself in a place</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very hard to reduce those distractions,</p>
<p>you may need to go to more elaborate lanes.</p>
<p>I will say that a graduate student in my lab,</p>
<p>who was immensely productive and focused,</p>
<p>had the habit of coming in each day.</p>
<p>She would take her phone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she turned it on, off or not.</p>
<p>And she would just place it in a door, excuse me,</p>
<p>in a drawer and would then go start doing experiments.</p>
<p>We do experiments all day, attend courses,</p>
<p>engage in discussions avidly with the rest of us.</p>
<p>And then would take her phone out</p>
<p>at the end of the day and leave.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that behavior was not correlated</p>
<p>with her immense productivity.</p>
<p>I think the ability to untether ourselves from the phone</p>
<p>is going to be the way in which many of us</p>
<p>are either going to succeed or fail in our various pursuits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who engages with the phone</p>
<p>on a regular basis throughout the day for various reasons.</p>
<p>But I do try and have large swaths of the day</p>
<p>in which it&rsquo;s either on airplane mode</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s completely physically separated from me.</p>
<p>And when I mean large swaths,</p>
<p>I might do every other hour with the phone on airplane mode</p>
<p>or even a two or three hour bout</p>
<p>where I just am simply not engaged with the phone at all.</p>
<p>So is it better to sit</p>
<p>or is it better to stand when doing work?</p>
<p>At least as it relates to focus and productivity.</p>
<p>And the answer is both.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been a number of systematic studies</p>
<p>exploring what are called sit-stand desks.</p>
<p>So these are desks that can be set to a height</p>
<p>that makes standing the best practice.</p>
<p>And then they can be lowered to a height</p>
<p>that makes sitting the best practice</p>
<p>or the easiest practice, I should say.</p>
<p>And it turns out that just sitting is terrible for us.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an enormous number of studies out there</p>
<p>that have pointed to the fact that people who sit</p>
<p>for five or six or seven hours a day doing work</p>
<p>have all sorts of issues related to sleep, neck pain,</p>
<p>cognition suffers, a number of cardiovascular effects,</p>
<p>even digestion.</p>
<p>There may even actually be some almost pressure effects</p>
<p>on the pelvic floor and things of that sort,</p>
<p>depending on the chairs that one uses.</p>
<p>But that people who stand</p>
<p>are in a slightly better situation</p>
<p>where many of those health metrics improve,</p>
<p>but that people that do a combination of sitting</p>
<p>and standing at the same desk throughout the day</p>
<p>or move from one desk to another,</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have a combination sit-stand desk,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be best.</p>
<p>The good news is it&rsquo;s very easy to convert a sit desk</p>
<p>into a stand desk.</p>
<p>You can just stack some boxes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this at times or stack books.</p>
<p>There are also some pedestals</p>
<p>and things that you can purchase if that&rsquo;s your preference</p>
<p>in order to set your computer at a particular height.</p>
<p>And of course, there are desks that have motors</p>
<p>and there are ones that have cranks</p>
<p>and there are all sorts of variations,</p>
<p>both in terms of the types</p>
<p>and whether or not they have motors</p>
<p>as well as the cost to these things.</p>
<p>So they can go from very low costs,</p>
<p>like placing boxes or books to create a standing desk</p>
<p>to very high cost in some cases.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>if you look at the scientific literature,</p>
<p>is that people who decreased their sitting time</p>
<p>by about half each day.</p>
<p>So they took, let&rsquo;s say they were working</p>
<p>for seven hours a day,</p>
<p>three and a half hours of that day,</p>
<p>they decide to stand.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even clear that it matters</p>
<p>that they do all those three hours in one bout</p>
<p>or they divide that up into shorter bouts of a half an hour</p>
<p>and then sit for half an hour, et cetera,</p>
<p>alternating back and forth,</p>
<p>showed incredibly significant effects</p>
<p>on reduced neck and shoulder pain,</p>
<p>increase in subjective health,</p>
<p>vitality in work-related environments,</p>
<p>and perhaps most importantly,</p>
<p>for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>improvement in cognitive conditioning</p>
<p>and the ability to embrace new tasks</p>
<p>and cognitive performance.</p>
<p>There are several studies that if one wanted to explore,</p>
<p>they could explore this in more detail.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a link to this as well.</p>
<p>The article that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is called effect of workplace sit-stand desk intervention</p>
<p>on health and productivity.</p>
<p>And I like this paper</p>
<p>because many of the papers out there</p>
<p>focus on the effects of sit-stand desks on health</p>
<p>and trying to get people to burn more calories,</p>
<p>improve their posture,</p>
<p>relieve neck pain, slumped over, et cetera,</p>
<p>but not on productivity.</p>
<p>And this particular paper focuses also</p>
<p>on the metrics of productivity.</p>
<p>It has its own study</p>
<p>and also references a number of important studies.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you and me?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve long used a standing desk</p>
<p>or some variation thereof.</p>
<p>What this means is that we should probably spend</p>
<p>about half of our work time standing</p>
<p>and about half of it sitting,</p>
<p>but not all sitting or not all standing.</p>
<p>If you had to do all one or the other,</p>
<p>standing is going to be better than sitting.</p>
<p>What happens if we just stand?</p>
<p>Well, that can also generate some postural issues</p>
<p>in terms of stabilization and fatigue.</p>
<p>I have a good friend who&rsquo;s in the movement</p>
<p>and physical rehabilitation and physiology space.</p>
<p>His name is Kelly Starrett.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very impressive in all those domains.</p>
<p>And he always says,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t designed to sit all day,</p>
<p>but we also weren&rsquo;t designed to stand all day.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>If we were to look back at our species over tens</p>
<p>or hundreds of thousands of years,</p>
<p>we would find that indeed we did sit down.</p>
<p>We did lie down.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that we were standing all day long.</p>
<p>That said, most everybody, at least in the US,</p>
<p>is not getting sufficient cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>or movement throughout the day.</p>
<p>And standing at one&rsquo;s desk can improve</p>
<p>some of those health metrics</p>
<p>and again, can improve productivity,</p>
<p>probably because of those postural effects</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>that when we lie down,</p>
<p>there tends to be less alertness in our brainstem,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less activation of those brainstem circuits</p>
<p>involved in alertness.</p>
<p>And indeed, the circuits that involve a kind of a</p>
<p>calming effect on the body get activated.</p>
<p>And as we become upright, standing or sitting,</p>
<p>but especially standing,</p>
<p>then those brainstem circuits for alertness kick on,</p>
<p>which are going to make it easier to remain focused.</p>
<p>If you are going to start standing</p>
<p>for half of your work time,</p>
<p>you will notice that it takes a few days to adapt.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a lot of shifting from side to side.</p>
<p>You definitely want to wear comfortable shoes.</p>
<p>Some people will do this on a wooden floor.</p>
<p>Other people feel uncomfortable unless they&rsquo;re on carpet.</p>
<p>You have to figure out what works for you,</p>
<p>but it can take a little bit of time to adapt.</p>
<p>I have to say, after now about 10 years of working</p>
<p>at a sit-stand desk,</p>
<p>I find I can&rsquo;t sit for too long before I want to stand.</p>
<p>And my standing bouts can be anywhere</p>
<p>from 30 minutes to two hours,</p>
<p>although two hours would be a little bit long.</p>
<p>And then I catch myself kind of leaning on the desk</p>
<p>off to the side.</p>
<p>So again, the idea is to stand,</p>
<p>but not be leaning on the desk.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you&rsquo;re typing or you&rsquo;re writing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be some leaning involved,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what the literature support.</p>
<p>There is also a literature on whether or not</p>
<p>physical movement under your desk,</p>
<p>meaning treadmilling, or in fact,</p>
<p>there are now bicycles that allow people to pedal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a unicycle like thing,</p>
<p>although not a unicycle,</p>
<p>under the desk can be beneficial for workplace performance.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at what those data say.</p>
<p>The study that I&rsquo;m referring to has a first author,</p>
<p>Frodsham, F-R-O-D-S-H-A-M, Frodsham et al.</p>
<p>This is a research article published in PLOS One.</p>
<p>And the title of the article is,</p>
<p>does type of active workstation matter?</p>
<p>A randomized comparison of cognitive and typing performance</p>
<p>between rest, cycling, and treadmill active workstations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that people do this science.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Where else would we get peer reviewed data</p>
<p>on these types of questions?</p>
<p>First things first, there were no significant differences</p>
<p>between cycling or treadmill workstations</p>
<p>on any cognitive or typing outcomes.</p>
<p>So it does not seem to matter</p>
<p>whether or not people are treadmilling under the desk.</p>
<p>So these would be stationary treadmills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little conveyor that people are walking on,</p>
<p>sometimes very slowly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing some people walk more quickly.</p>
<p>The New Yorkers probably treadmill quicker.</p>
<p>The Californians probably treadmill a little slower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Californian, so I can make that quote unquote joke.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, there were no significant differences</p>
<p>between that and a cycling station where people are sitting</p>
<p>and pedaling as they type away,</p>
<p>or as they work or as they&rsquo;re on phone calls, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it really doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to embrace these active workstations,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called, just decide</p>
<p>what you would prefer to use.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter in terms of outcomes.</p>
<p>Now, this study involved looking at 137 young adults.</p>
<p>They had multiple sessions where they at first</p>
<p>completed cognitive and typing tests.</p>
<p>These tests have different names</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re welcome to look those up if you like,</p>
<p>as well as flanker tasks.</p>
<p>So these are tasks of attention and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And then they either engaged in treadmill or cycling</p>
<p>and then there was a comparison.</p>
<p>And the statistics were run.</p>
<p>And basically what they found was there was a statistically</p>
<p>significant improvement in attention</p>
<p>and cognitive control scores during any kind of active</p>
<p>session, as opposed to just a mere seated session.</p>
<p>Okay, so they compared seated to cycling to treadmilling.</p>
<p>However, verbal memory scores actually got worse</p>
<p>during active sessions.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll repeat that.</p>
<p>Treadmilling or the cycling workstations</p>
<p>improved attention and cognitive control scores</p>
<p>as compared to people that were just seated and working.</p>
<p>However, verbal memory scores got worse</p>
<p>during the active sessions.</p>
<p>And again, just to repeat,</p>
<p>there was no difference between cycling</p>
<p>and treadmill workstations.</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>I suggest that as the author say that active workstations,</p>
<p>whether walking or cycling are not only useful</p>
<p>to improve caloric output and physical activity,</p>
<p>circulation and so on,</p>
<p>but particularly when completing tasks like cognitive tasks</p>
<p>that require focus that do not require</p>
<p>verbal memory recall.</p>
<p>Now, why verbal memory recall was negatively impacted?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Could be because people were breathing</p>
<p>a little bit harder.</p>
<p>It could be that there&rsquo;s something about walking</p>
<p>and talking that seems incompatible in the nervous system.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m not aware of that.</p>
<p>I know a number of people who can walk and talk</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>But if you are going to explore these treadmills,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to explore the cycling stations,</p>
<p>you probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to do that</p>
<p>for highly verbal work,</p>
<p>maybe more for mathematical work or for analytic work</p>
<p>or even creative work,</p>
<p>but anything that involves very precise</p>
<p>or detailed verbal recall,</p>
<p>sitting or standing seems to be the better option.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re wondering why cycling or treadmilling</p>
<p>would enhance various aspects of cognition,</p>
<p>we can speculate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before about this,</p>
<p>but anytime we are generating forward movement</p>
<p>through our own actions, our own efforts,</p>
<p>typically if we are outside, we&rsquo;re not on a treadmill</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re on a bicycle or we&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>or even on a motorcycle or in a car,</p>
<p>we have what&rsquo;s called optic flow.</p>
<p>And that optic flow is known to quiet certain areas</p>
<p>of the brain that are associated with vigilance</p>
<p>and indeed fear.</p>
<p>This is the basis of things like EMDR,</p>
<p>eye movement desensitization reprocessing.</p>
<p>However, the mere act of engaging what are called</p>
<p>our central pattern generators,</p>
<p>the neurons in our brainstem and in our spinal cord</p>
<p>that engage repetitive movements</p>
<p>also can reduce some of the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with anxiety and vigilance.</p>
<p>So one pure speculation, but nonetheless grounded speculation</p>
<p>would be that treadmilling or cycling at a desk</p>
<p>would reduce anxiety that would allow performance to improve.</p>
<p>The other, what I think is more likely explanation</p>
<p>is that anytime we are in ambulation,</p>
<p>we recruit the release of neuromodulators</p>
<p>like epinephrine, dopamine, and things of that sort</p>
<p>that further increase overall levels of alertness.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the more likely explanation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how just a reduction</p>
<p>in anxiety could lead to these improvements in cognition</p>
<p>in a direct way.</p>
<p>Whereas the subjects in the study I just mentioned</p>
<p>on average experienced an increase in cognitive performance</p>
<p>merely by movement, okay?</p>
<p>And this does not include any optic flow</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s stationary,</p>
<p>the treadmill or the cycle is stationary.</p>
<p>And so we can rule out that optic flow.</p>
<p>And that points to the idea that when we are in movement,</p>
<p>we recruit neuromodulators associated</p>
<p>with the so-called reticular activating system,</p>
<p>the striatal system and so forth</p>
<p>that would place the brain into some pattern.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, we only can speculate some pattern,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s gamma waves or some other wave pattern</p>
<p>that would engage heightened levels of focus and attention.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, treadmilling, cycling at a desk</p>
<p>does improve cognition.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been discussing workspace optimization</p>
<p>with the understanding that you&rsquo;re not always going to work</p>
<p>in the same place every day.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve tried to do is give you a set of high potency</p>
<p>tools that can improve your focus and cognition</p>
<p>and to place that within a framework</p>
<p>for particular kinds of work.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just review some of the basic elements</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;ve covered today.</p>
<p>First of all, in the first part of your day,</p>
<p>that zero to nine hours after waking,</p>
<p>you want bright lights, especially overhead lights,</p>
<p>as bright as you can keep them</p>
<p>without feeling uncomfortable</p>
<p>or certainly not without feeling any pain in your eyes</p>
<p>or elsewhere in your body.</p>
<p>Bright lights make for the maximum state of alertness.</p>
<p>In addition, try and place whatever it is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re focusing on directly in front of you,</p>
<p>but not have it extend too far out</p>
<p>to either side of your eyes.</p>
<p>Try and generate a fairly restricted visual window</p>
<p>as we call it.</p>
<p>And if you can, try and place whatever it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re focusing on at least at nose level or above.</p>
<p>It might take some engineering or some ingenuity</p>
<p>and creativity in order to figure out how to do that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s going to be most beneficial.</p>
<p>Try and avoid reclining.</p>
<p>Try and avoid sitting.</p>
<p>Try and stand for at least half of your workday.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good goal.</p>
<p>And it may take some time to work up to that goal.</p>
<p>In addition, if you&rsquo;re going to use sound</p>
<p>as a stimulus for increasing focus and alertness,</p>
<p>try and avoid exposure to white noise, pink noise,</p>
<p>or brown noise for extended periods of time</p>
<p>for more than an hour or so.</p>
<p>That might actually be damaging to the auditory system.</p>
<p>And at the very least, it&rsquo;s kind of stressful,</p>
<p>even though you might not notice it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a background level of anxiety and stress</p>
<p>that is not going to serve you well.</p>
<p>Rather, if you&rsquo;re going to pursue particular types</p>
<p>of sound frequencies, consider using 40 Hertz binaural beats,</p>
<p>not monaural beats, but 40 Hertz binaural beats</p>
<p>done during a particular work bout</p>
<p>or for 30 minutes prior to that work bout.</p>
<p>I would not rely on binaural beats all the time every day.</p>
<p>I think that could cause them to lose their potency</p>
<p>just because of the way the auditory system attenuates.</p>
<p>And actually you&rsquo;ve experienced that attenuation,</p>
<p>the mere fact that you can go into an environment</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an air conditioner blowing,</p>
<p>blowing, blowing, and then it stops</p>
<p>and you feel that relaxation,</p>
<p>but you weren&rsquo;t thinking about the air conditioner before,</p>
<p>tells you that your auditory system</p>
<p>had kind of attenuated to it,</p>
<p>and yet it was still impacting your system.</p>
<p>You were sensing it, we would say, but not perceiving it.</p>
<p>There are other things that you can do</p>
<p>to improve your workspace optimization,</p>
<p>such as standing for half the day, as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re interested in this,</p>
<p>or you feel like it suits you, to treadmill,</p>
<p>find a stationary treadmill that you can walk on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried this before, maybe after this episode,</p>
<p>given what I&rsquo;ve read in the peer-reviewed research,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty compelling,</p>
<p>that treadmilling seems like an interesting way</p>
<p>to increase alertness and cognitive performance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that I would do the cycling method</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t imagine just cycling</p>
<p>and typing at the same time.</p>
<p>That sort of feels like, you know,</p>
<p>like I actually can do the rub your tummy,</p>
<p>pat the top of your head kind of thing,</p>
<p>but it still feels like a little bit</p>
<p>of a sort of a cognitive motor collision for me,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, but that&rsquo;s just my bias.</p>
<p>I do know how to ride a bicycle,</p>
<p>but anyway, you pick your preference.</p>
<p>Some other things that you could do</p>
<p>in order to improve your workplace performance</p>
<p>would be to consider the cathedral effect.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to do analytic work</p>
<p>for any part of the day, phase one or phase two,</p>
<p>as I described them, but really in any time of day,</p>
<p>that detailed analytic work</p>
<p>for which there is a correct answer,</p>
<p>learning scales of music, learning mathematics,</p>
<p>trying to figure out the solution to a problem</p>
<p>where there is indeed a solution.</p>
<p>It could be an interpersonal problem as well.</p>
<p>Then try and get into an environment</p>
<p>with a relatively low ceiling.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to a low ceiling environment,</p>
<p>you might consider using a brimmed hat or even a hoodie,</p>
<p>or even just facing down,</p>
<p>or even putting your hand above your eyes, as you will,</p>
<p>as at the level of your eyebrows.</p>
<p>In other words, lower the ceiling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basis of the cathedral effects</p>
<p>on analytic performance.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you&rsquo;re interested in doing brainstorming,</p>
<p>creative work, you&rsquo;re writing new things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re creating new things of any kind, artwork,</p>
<p>consider getting into a high ceiling</p>
<p>or no ceiling environment.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re wearing a brimmed hat</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re wearing a hoodie, maybe peel that back.</p>
<p>Again, the data within the peer reviewed literature</p>
<p>are there to support these sorts of practices.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to start layering these protocols</p>
<p>by all means, please do that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you couldn&rsquo;t do one</p>
<p>or just two of these protocols.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why, for instance,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t use binaural beats</p>
<p>and try and get into a low ceiling environment</p>
<p>to do detailed work a couple of times a week,</p>
<p>but you could also employ all of these.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are an enormous number</p>
<p>of other things that you can do</p>
<p>to improve work performance and productivity.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about those in previous episodes,</p>
<p>in particular, in the episode on focus</p>
<p>and the episode on motivation.</p>
<p>There are supplements you can take</p>
<p>that can increase dopamine, for instance.</p>
<p>There are tools that you can use to increase your focus,</p>
<p>for instance, focusing your visual attention</p>
<p>on one location for 30 to 60 seconds</p>
<p>prior to entering a focused work bout.</p>
<p>This has been shown again and again</p>
<p>through work from Emily Balsettis at NYU.</p>
<p>In the episode on focus, I cited a number of studies</p>
<p>where this has actually been tested</p>
<p>and deployed in various schools,</p>
<p>having kids do a focus task</p>
<p>where they look at a particular visual target</p>
<p>for 30 to 60 seconds, then doing some mathematics</p>
<p>and seeing pretty impressive improvement</p>
<p>in focus and attention,</p>
<p>even in people that have attention deficit</p>
<p>hyperactivity disorder and so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t combine</p>
<p>the sort of practical workspace optimization solutions</p>
<p>that we talked about today</p>
<p>with the kind of neural optimization solutions</p>
<p>that we talked about in the episode on focus</p>
<p>and the episode on ADHD and the episode on motivation.</p>
<p>By all means, layer those together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re going to achieve the optimal focus bouts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re going to achieve</p>
<p>the optimal creativity bouts.</p>
<p>I do want to acknowledge again,</p>
<p>the fact that I realize people are showing up</p>
<p>to this challenge of workspace optimization</p>
<p>with different budgets, with different constraints.</p>
<p>Some people have kids at homes.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interruptions.</p>
<p>Some people do not.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I hope that the information</p>
<p>I was able to provide today will allow you to make subtle</p>
<p>or maybe even drastic rearrangements</p>
<p>in your workspace environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other point related to that</p>
<p>that I did not cover</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;d like to cover just briefly,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s nothing to say</p>
<p>that you have to always work</p>
<p>in the same location all the time.</p>
<p>You can move from house to cafe if that works for you.</p>
<p>You can move from office to home.</p>
<p>You can also move from different locations within your home.</p>
<p>I have a brief anecdote about this.</p>
<p>I used to attend a lot of scientific meetings</p>
<p>when a lot of scientific meetings were in person.</p>
<p>And there were always a few individuals</p>
<p>that seemed to stay engaged</p>
<p>throughout these very long meetings.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking seven, eight hour days,</p>
<p>sometimes evening sessions.</p>
<p>And sometimes these meetings would go on</p>
<p>for four or five or even six days.</p>
<p>These were long meetings.</p>
<p>And the quality of talks varied tremendously.</p>
<p>And I always noticed the individuals</p>
<p>that managed to stay engaged and awake</p>
<p>for the entire meeting.</p>
<p>And I noticed that people</p>
<p>that could maintain high levels of alertness</p>
<p>in this one conference room</p>
<p>had a habit of moving to a different seat</p>
<p>after each session, sometimes even between talks.</p>
<p>And I actually discussed this</p>
<p>with one of my colleagues who was doing this.</p>
<p>I said, is this conscious?</p>
<p>Are you always moving from place to place?</p>
<p>And they said, yeah, if I just stay in one place</p>
<p>and I just look from this one particular visual angle,</p>
<p>I find after one or two talks,</p>
<p>regardless of how interesting the talks are,</p>
<p>that I start to kind of drift.</p>
<p>My mind isn&rsquo;t as engaged</p>
<p>and indeed sometimes can fall asleep.</p>
<p>And so I started this practice</p>
<p>of moving from space to space,</p>
<p>or I should say seat to seat within an auditorium.</p>
<p>And it works quite well.</p>
<p>And I think it works quite well</p>
<p>because again of the relationship</p>
<p>between our visual system driving</p>
<p>the majority of our cognition, right?</p>
<p>Our visual system drives our thinking</p>
<p>and that novel visual environments</p>
<p>are going to lend themselves</p>
<p>to heightened levels of alertness.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want things to be so novel and scary</p>
<p>or threatening or anxiety provoking or loud</p>
<p>that they draw your attention away from your work.</p>
<p>But I think this is part of the reason why</p>
<p>turning on music or moving to an office or a cafe</p>
<p>or an outdoor environment from an indoor environment</p>
<p>or vice versa, maybe even within a single day</p>
<p>can bring about more heightened levels of productivity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to acknowledge that what I covered today</p>
<p>is most certainly not exhaustive</p>
<p>for all the types of workspace optimization tools</p>
<p>that one could create.</p>
<p>For that reason, I&rsquo;d love for you to suggest</p>
<p>any of your workspace optimization tools</p>
<p>that you found useful.</p>
<p>Please put those in the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>That would be the best place then other people can see them.</p>
<p>Also read through those.</p>
<p>And perhaps in a future episode,</p>
