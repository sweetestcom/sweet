<p>morning Eastern Standard Time we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna welcome your questions we have a</p>
<p>live show here and we have Karen that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna help out with all the million</p>
<p>questions in social media yeah</p>
<p>if you want to call in the number is 866</p>
<p>five six one four two nine two we have a</p>
<p>ton of callers from all around the world</p>
<p>waiting right now so we&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>right to megan from georgia go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the line hi good morning i was</p>
<p>calling to ask about my fasting blood</p>
<p>sugar I started keto in the first week</p>
<p>of January so it&rsquo;s been about five weeks</p>
<p>and my I&rsquo;ve been diabetic in the past</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had gestational diabetes and so</p>
<p>going into it my fasting blood sugar was</p>
<p>around 120 and I&rsquo;m a 37 year old and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>nursing my daughter too so I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been able to do intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>extended periods but my fastings gone</p>
<p>down the lowest that I&rsquo;ve seen is 96 and</p>
<p>ranging around you know a little above</p>
<p>100 so I&rsquo;m just wondering I read</p>
<p>somewhere that if you&rsquo;re above 100 then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really in ketosis and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if that is true I&rsquo;m showing keto</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m showing ketones on the strips the</p>
<p>urine strips so just wondering if I am</p>
<p>in ketosis and if I&rsquo;m just not here to</p>
<p>adapt it or if it&rsquo;s just gonna take a</p>
<p>long time to see those numbers come down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great question good so let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>answer that first of all probably 25</p>
<p>years ago might have been a little</p>
<p>longer maybe it was in the 70s normal</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s were fasting normal blood</p>
<p>Sugar&rsquo;s were actually a little higher so</p>
<p>there was a group committee who changed</p>
<p>it and made it lower and pretty much</p>
<p>made everyone diabetic so if your blood</p>
<p>sugars are a little bit higher not to</p>
<p>worry about that because I think you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in ketosis if you&rsquo;re officially</p>
<p>in ketones in your urine you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>ketosis and it&rsquo;s working of course when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you know nursing you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to go crazy through them in the fasting</p>
<p>I would just stick with three meals and</p>
<p>then no snacks in between that would be</p>
<p>important that would be like a nice</p>
<p>version but let&rsquo;s just pretend now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing everything right you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fasting and your blood Sugar&rsquo;s are not</p>
<p>coming down and they&rsquo;re just too high</p>
<p>and you want to bring them down there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a couple things that I look at and this</p>
<p>also goes for if you&rsquo;re actually not</p>
<p>losing weight and/or you&rsquo;re not losing</p>
<p>inches in your plateau it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>a little my little troubleshooter number</p>
<p>one reevaluate your carbs make sure that</p>
<p>you know that where they are at because</p>
<p>a lot of times people are oh yeah my</p>
<p>carbs are fine but in reality they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>lot higher than they should be if you</p>
<p>have a slow metabolism you want your</p>
<p>car&rsquo;s below 20 grams and in some cases</p>
<p>if you have a thyroid issue you need to</p>
<p>bring them down even lower if you if</p>
<p>your metabolism is completely shot down</p>
<p>to maybe 10 grams or less so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing okay just make sure your carbs are</p>
<p>in check just basically want to make</p>
<p>sure you&rsquo;re doing everything correct</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re not doing access</p>
<p>amounts of protein make sure you&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>doing no protein you know have some it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a moderate amount of protein</p>
<p>make sure your greens are high I also</p>
<p>look to make sure that you&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>how is your stress level those two</p>
<p>things could keep you out of ketosis for</p>
<p>sure then there&rsquo;s other things you can</p>
<p>do because let&rsquo;s say you have a history</p>
<p>of diabetes and it&rsquo;s chronically a</p>
<p>problem and you have insulin resistance</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to bust through this</p>
<p>thing well you might need nutrition</p>
<p>nutrients electrolyte B vitamins</p>
<p>chromium zinc potassium all really</p>
<p>really important vitamin D very</p>
<p>important to improve the insulin</p>
<p>resistance which will bring down the</p>
<p>insulin and help normalize your blood</p>
<p>sugar the other thing is that you could</p>
<p>add an exercise to that okay add more</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>to that and then let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>all these things and still there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing else changing then I would look</p>
<p>to other body issues like there must be</p>
<p>a weak link here do you have a</p>
<p>underlying digestive issue are you</p>
<p>constipated you have an underlying</p>
<p>inflammatory condition do you have some</p>
<p>type of part of your body that is just</p>
<p>like a weak link that you need to</p>
<p>strengthen then once you fix that I</p>
<p>would then start going more extreme</p>
<p>within a minute fasting so you want to</p>
<p>go maybe you&rsquo;re going to meals go to one</p>
<p>meal going one meal make sure that you</p>
<p>you know maybe you do you know you</p>
<p>adjust your fats you know so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always things that you can do all right</p>
<p>Megan thanks for your call and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to Chris from Florida you had a</p>
<p>question about in Amanda fasting and</p>
<p>gastric bypass go ahead yes thank you so</p>
<p>much for taking my call sure hi Karen I</p>
<p>love you guys I listen every week we</p>
<p>learned watching in videos thanks I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been watching your videos and I have to</p>
<p>started keto yet but I am about to have</p>
<p>been planning I&rsquo;m a planner so I like to</p>
<p>plan ahead I&rsquo;m 58 years old I had a</p>
<p>gastric bypass about 20 years ago and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gained some weight back and so</p>
<p>during deficit bypass also they did take</p>
<p>out my gallbladder</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m about to start keto and like I</p>
<p>said I&rsquo;ve been planning watching your</p>
<p>videos so I&rsquo;ve gotten a purchase out of</p>
<p>your supplement so I have them on hand</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m ready to get started so my</p>
<p>question to you is basically I&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>with three meals can I use the kale</p>
<p>shake that I have as a supplement as a</p>
<p>meal replacement like can I have it for</p>
<p>breakfast instead of eating oh you mean</p>
<p>the kept the powder kale shake instant</p>
<p>cow shake or just an actual kill sure</p>
<p>know the power have the powder tail</p>
<p>shake the chocolate was good so that</p>
<p>that was the main question right yeah I</p>
<p>want to know if I can use that as a meal</p>
<p>replacement and also about intermittent</p>
<p>fasting I have a question about since I</p>
<p>have had a gastric bypass and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat a lot at one meal I&rsquo;m wondering once</p>
<p>I start imprinted fasting can I eat in</p>
<p>between like say if I eat at 12 and then</p>
<p>I eat it six can I eat in between just</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting in like vegetables and</p>
<p>things that I can&rsquo;t eat during the meal</p>
<p>God okay good so let me address those</p>
<p>questions okay</p>
<p>yeah the instance kale shake you could</p>
<p>add that as a meal replacement for sure</p>
<p>the only thing that I would add is I</p>
<p>would add a little bit of fat that way</p>
<p>it makes a you know better better meal</p>
<p>because anytime you have low fat protein</p>
<p>you want to add the fat in there I do</p>
<p>have a chocolate meal replacement with</p>
<p>MCT oil which would be fine but when you</p>
<p>do instant kale shake it does need a</p>
<p>little more fat so you might want to add</p>
<p>that and then maybe your greens you know</p>
<p>then you have then you have the protein</p>
<p>the fat and the Greens okay so that</p>
<p>would be totally fine now as far as the</p>
<p>other questions go but the cool thing</p>
<p>about intermittent fasting and gastric</p>
<p>bypass is that the need for the calories</p>
<p>go down because your body is adapting to</p>
<p>that so you no longer the requirements</p>
<p>for even all nutrients even protein go</p>
<p>down because your body is protecting and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s recycling a lot of other different</p>
<p>things so you can get by with less</p>
<p>calories and do comfortably just make</p>
<p>sure that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of a personal</p>
<p>thing you have to adjust to your body to</p>
<p>see how you what you feel and see if it</p>
<p>works for you everyone is kind of</p>
<p>different but there&rsquo;s some guidelines so</p>
<p>now if you&rsquo;re doing let&rsquo;s say two meals</p>
<p>okay can you snack in between ideally</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to do that you would</p>
<p>rather it be better to add the fat but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you eating at 12 and 5 and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the transition phase you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>phasing into it you&rsquo;ve got an eating</p>
<p>window that you can stick things in</p>
<p>there because now you&rsquo;re going too fast</p>
<p>for those 18 hours whatever it is so</p>
<p>yeah add a kale shake add a salad in the</p>
<p>middle there I think that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>transition to get your green so that way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not eating all of it you know at</p>
<p>one meal especially for you thanks</p>
<p>thanks Chris that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>alright Karen we&rsquo;re going to you if you</p>
<p>have a you have a quick question over</p>
<p>there thank you don&rsquo;t say that cuz we</p>
<p>got a lot of questions over here it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never quick in social media it just</p>
<p>keeps coming okay it&rsquo;s the gift that</p>
<p>keeps coming it&rsquo;s the gift that keeps</p>
<p>giving okay so we have I&rsquo;m at a toss-up</p>
<p>because we have a lot of questions that</p>
<p>we get</p>
<p>every single week and I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to you know to repeat these</p>
<p>things but well first of all I want to</p>
<p>say hello to to Oregon and Chicago</p>
<p>and Alberta and Michigan and California</p>
<p>and a lot of you guys aren&rsquo;t saying</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re from this morning but hello</p>
<p>thank you for being here I&rsquo;m gonna start</p>
<p>with Katie on Facebook who&rsquo;s asking how</p>
<p>do you know you&rsquo;re in ketosis good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>the the best way is to do keto strips</p>
<p>okay you can check there&rsquo;s these little</p>
<p>strips you can get on Amazon and you can</p>
<p>check your urine and it&rsquo;ll tell you how</p>
<p>much ketosis that you&rsquo;re in that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>way is it necessary</p>
<p>no because the other way is just to you</p>
<p>know look at look at your inches loss</p>
<p>off your stomach if you&rsquo;re losing inches</p>
<p>off your stomach you&rsquo;re gonna be in</p>
<p>ketosis that&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>indicators because as you adapt to</p>
<p>ketosis what happens you start burning</p>
<p>up more ketones there&rsquo;ll be less in the</p>
<p>urine so it gives you false this all</p>
<p>false idea that oh my gosh I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>ketones in my urine yes I&rsquo;m losing</p>
<p>weight but I&rsquo;m not in ketosis yes you</p>
<p>are you&rsquo;re just burning up the ketones</p>
<p>in the beginning now you&rsquo;ll see more</p>
<p>ketones because you&rsquo;re just losing more</p>
<p>so yeah so so basically you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that the keto strips aren&rsquo;t reliable</p>
<p>throughout this well they&rsquo;re not a</p>
<p>hundred percent there are good in there</p>
<p>one of the many indicators but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give it the whole picture right</p>
<p>so use judgment look at the whole</p>
<p>picture if you&rsquo;re losing weight you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>inches are coming off you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>great guess what you&rsquo;re in ketosis yeah</p>
<p>and you know we had we had to talk about</p>
<p>this earlier today or was it last night</p>
<p>and I was saying you know people have to</p>
<p>realize I know people get frustrated a</p>
<p>lot when they&rsquo;re not dropping pounds and</p>
<p>they think something&rsquo;s wrong I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>losing the weight I&rsquo;ve been new in</p>
<p>ketosis I&rsquo;m not losing weight what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>problem on plateauing but I can attest</p>
<p>to this that the scale doesn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in ketosis or if you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>process of this thing that dr. Burke</p>
<p>explains a toughie gee where your cells</p>
<p>are rebuilding I&rsquo;m losing size and</p>
<p>building muscle and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>anyway so we were talking about the</p>
<p>analogy like yeah okay you can build a</p>
<p>brand new body in nine months you can</p>
<p>build a house in a couple of months but</p>
<p>what if you have a house that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>there for 50 years and you decide you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to tear it down and rebuild it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually gonna one-by-one remove</p>
<p>the walls rebuild the internal frame you</p>
<p>know and go at it that way it might take</p>
<p>a little bit longer so you have to look</p>
<p>at all these other indicators how does</p>
<p>my skin look how am i sleeping how is my</p>
<p>shirt fitting how are my pants fitting</p>
<p>in and really lay off the the scale idea</p>
<p>or thinking that just because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>losing a pound you know it&rsquo;s not working</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not you know the only</p>
<p>thing that could maybe not be working is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not you know following you</p>
<p>know truly to keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting that&rsquo;s a good point because you</p>
<p>have how many cells of the body</p>
<p>Karen owe you 300 trillion 100 trillion</p>
<p>yes 100 trillion so so it&rsquo;s gonna take</p>
<p>more than a week to get to your ideal</p>
<p>weight you have 100 trillion cells love</p>
<p>that have to be you know improved</p>
<p>rebuilt right and you know also this</p>
<p>other thing I&rsquo;d like people say oh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>healthy I&rsquo;m only 30 pounds overweight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m healthy I&rsquo;m not on a medication</p>
<p>really you have atrophy of the body loss</p>
<p>of tone you live on planet Earth there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some there&rsquo;s some issues there that need</p>
<p>to be so my definition of health is</p>
<p>completely different than the average</p>
<p>person but but again you know so thank</p>
<p>you for that Karen we&rsquo;re gonna go right</p>
<p>to someone that&rsquo;s been holding for 41</p>
<p>minutes now roopinder go ahead you from</p>
<p>California hey thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call sure doctor I have I have a lot of</p>
<p>issue with my digestion from last two</p>
<p>years and finally you know this wondered</p>
<p>I had a lot of a gallbladder stone and</p>
<p>inflamed gallbladder</p>
<p>I decided sorry but my symptoms my</p>
<p>problem is still there and have a lot of</p>
<p>migraine so yeah can I ask you a</p>
<p>question sure do you have a migraine</p>
<p>right now do you have a headache right</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>at this time not not right now Donald I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your something here&rsquo;s something you want</p>
<p>to do you want to get this torture I</p>
<p>mean treatment device it&rsquo;s a massage</p>
<p>tool okay and you want to take this I</p>
<p>have a technique you would press it</p>
<p>underneath the right rib cage about an</p>
<p>inch down an inch off the midline to the</p>
<p>right and you can watch my videos on</p>
<p>headaches in the gallbladder you press</p>
<p>it into the lower abdomen and then if</p>
<p>you had X alleviate that means it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>connected to the gallbladder so many</p>
<p>cases where you have migraines and</p>
<p>headaches are triggered by and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nerve that goes right underneath the</p>
<p>right side it goes all the way up to the</p>
<p>neck up to the head I saw your video and</p>
<p>that time I had a surgery so I I mean I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do that because that incision</p>
<p>tears yeah okay so then all that a</p>
<p>formula with help but there&rsquo;s some other</p>
<p>other points as well as you do intimate</p>
<p>fasting and ketosis the gallbladder</p>
<p>actually you don&rsquo;t have one I think you</p>
<p>said you had it did you say you had it</p>
<p>removed I had a surgery three weeks ago</p>
<p>okay so now what&rsquo;s gonna happen is them</p>
<p>you have a little tube from your duct</p>
<p>from your liver that goes into the small</p>
<p>intestine there&rsquo;s no sac there so I</p>
<p>think what&rsquo;s going to help you is some</p>
<p>bowel support some extra bile that you</p>
<p>can take addition to your food take one</p>
<p>after a meal that way you&rsquo;ll have more</p>
<p>bile to get more of a complete digestion</p>
<p>but the fact that you had surgery there</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be pressing there</p>
<p>anymore I didn&rsquo;t know that so you if you</p>
<p>have surgery don&rsquo;t press where the scar</p>
<p>is don&rsquo;t press on the gallbladder press</p>
<p>on the opposite side and the pain trysts</p>
<p>okay I have videos on that opposite side</p>
<p>the mirror image side underneath the</p>
<p>left ribcage that will give you a lot of</p>
<p>relief but as you in a minute fasting</p>
<p>and kind of maybe go easy on the fats</p>
<p>initially your headaches should improve</p>
<p>now the other main cause of these</p>
<p>migraines and headaches is a low blood</p>
<p>sugar situation hypoglycemia which so</p>
<p>many people have but it&rsquo;s hard to detect</p>
<p>it so watch my videos on that and</p>
<p>continue to do this because eventually</p>
<p>that will actually help</p>
<p>all right now we&rsquo;re gonna go to Karen</p>
<p>okay well I just read something and I</p>
<p>want it I want to address this that</p>
<p>someone is a little disappointed in you</p>
<p>dr. Burton because you rarely answer the</p>
<p>posts in your videos so I just want to</p>
<p>put a little wreath thousand there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three thousand videos and no post a day</p>
<p>or three thousand posts a day on over</p>
<p>two thousand videos it&rsquo;s hard to get to</p>
<p>everyone it is hard to get to everyone</p>
<p>and we definitely do the best we can and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually the video posts are</p>
<p>inspirations for the videos that dr.</p>
<p>Berg creates so don&rsquo;t feel neglected</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel like no one&rsquo;s listening</p>
<p>because moderators are scanning those</p>
<p>posts all the time trying to give people</p>
<p>some help and dr. Burke is making videos</p>
<p>so another point is definitely look in</p>
<p>the Facebook page and YouTube and type</p>
<p>in dr. Berg blank whatever dr. Berg</p>
<p>joint pain dr. Berg migraine whatever</p>
<p>and you will get a ton of videos that</p>
<p>answer your question I am guaranteeing</p>
<p>that the realization that a lot of</p>
<p>people have it is like wow you have a</p>
<p>video and everything yes I do just find</p>
<p>you have to find it though and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working on consolidating that so you can</p>
<p>find it but that&rsquo;s why when you keep</p>
<p>asking and answering the same question</p>
<p>over and over it&rsquo;s like Oh search here</p>
<p>right right but you know it is important</p>
<p>a lot of people are learning and so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna give you a couple of these</p>
<p>questions okay go ahead so I see a big</p>
<p>question here what is the this is from</p>
<p>Noreen on Facebook and she asked what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the difference between keto and paleo</p>
<p>okay good good question</p>
<p>alright so keyed paleo allows more carbs</p>
<p>they allow more carbs they allow some</p>
<p>fruit they allow some dates agave nectar</p>
<p>got a nut chokolate yeah so so Kido is a</p>
<p>lower carbohydrate because the carbs</p>
<p>determine whether you&rsquo;re burning fat or</p>
<p>not and a lot of times when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>paleo you never get fully into ketosis</p>
<p>because of those little carbs sitting</p>
<p>there now that being said I have a</p>
<p>version of keto that is different than</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>and I recommend a lot more vegetables</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s kind of like a healthier</p>
<p>version plus we&rsquo;re adding another</p>
<p>strategy in there which is a different</p>
<p>way of eating which is in a minute</p>
<p>fasting so what I&rsquo;ve done is I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>combined the best of both worlds and</p>
<p>combined all these strategies together</p>
<p>to have a powerful program that people</p>
<p>get results so that&rsquo;s why it might be</p>
<p>confusing you know paleo your back ends</p>
<p>and this and that so yeah next question</p>
<p>okay good so somebody on YouTube is</p>
<p>really wanting to know your thoughts on</p>
<p>distilled water yeah distilled water I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recommend it because it&rsquo;s water</p>
<p>without any minerals at all and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like a refined product it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>nature you never find distilled water so</p>
<p>it starts to pull stuff out now a lot of</p>
<p>people take that to detox which is fine</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing it very temporarily but</p>
<p>the problem with still water it leaches</p>
<p>out not just the bad you know metallic</p>
<p>minerals and stuff but the good minerals</p>
<p>as well so you end up with oh my gosh</p>
<p>mineral deficiency so maybe you take the</p>
<p>distilled water and then you add</p>
<p>electrolytes in after that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>possibility but I&rsquo;m not crazy of</p>
<p>anything other than a short term type of</p>
<p>program where you&rsquo;re doing distilled</p>
<p>water okay okay good alright so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to Boston Jody&rsquo;s been waiting</p>
<p>for 31 minutes and 27 seconds oh my gosh</p>
<p>Jody</p>
<p>hi dr. Burke I first of all thank you so</p>
<p>much for all your videos and your</p>
<p>YouTube account is a gold mine really</p>
<p>your videos have helped me fine-tune my</p>
<p>fasting protocols so much awesome I have</p>
<p>lost 40 pounds</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>just for you well I still have other 50</p>
<p>pounds to go so yeah we still anyway my</p>
<p>question is about the pancreas as it</p>
<p>relates to type 2 diabetes and I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve already addressed this but I</p>
<p>have come across you theories about a</p>
<p>diabetic pancreas first one being that</p>
<p>betta cells are better cells however you</p>
<p>can answered get killed with years of</p>
<p>high blood sugar and they cannot be</p>
<p>revived like the damage is already done</p>
<p>right so forth and the second is that</p>
<p>the pancreas is just clogged with fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just about like fat less than one</p>
<p>gram which is in the pancreas and if</p>
<p>that goes away the diabetes is gone like</p>
<p>which one is it in your opinion okay</p>
<p>good okay so the first question yes the</p>
<p>beta cells are control they have</p>
<p>actually produce insulin so they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>ones that are controlling all the sugars</p>
<p>in the pancreas so that&rsquo;s that now</p>
<p>yes years of eating the wrong foods</p>
<p>years of high sugar make those cells</p>
<p>work like crazy and then they eventually</p>
<p>get tired and they burn out and then</p>
<p>they die and that&rsquo;s it right you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>become a diabetic type 1 and you could</p>
<p>also get a type 1 from autoimmune issues</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;re not going to get into</p>
<p>that subject right now but you know even</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re burnt out and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fully dead you I find that you can at</p>
<p>least improve them greatly if not</p>
<p>completely restore them in some cases</p>
<p>depending on how far it&rsquo;s gone so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of an opening question I would</p>
<p>always try to improve it and see how far</p>
<p>you can go because the goal is if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a diabetic and you&rsquo;re taking insulin the</p>
<p>goal is to how do you take is the least</p>
<p>amount possible because if you&rsquo;re a type</p>
<p>1 diabetic and you&rsquo;re on insulin and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically eating the wrong foods</p>
<p>causing the need for more insulin you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get a lot of problems with your</p>
<p>eyes your kidneys your nerves and your</p>
<p>heart and the arteries so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>goal</p>
<p>so so that&rsquo;s one okay so yeah you can</p>
<p>actually probably restore a lot of the</p>
<p>function of the beta cell second</p>
<p>question fat clogging up things in the</p>
<p>pancreas in and that well here&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>data about fat that I want to just</p>
<p>mention</p>
<p>saturated fats if you if you consume</p>
<p>fats with carbohydrates that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>bad</p>
<p>this whole viewpoint that people are</p>
<p>saying oh yeah it&rsquo;s all about the</p>
<p>saturated fats that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s causing the</p>
<p>diabetes that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s causing the</p>
<p>problem I will guarantee in fact I will</p>
<p>bet you anything that these people that</p>
<p>are consuming all that fat are also at</p>
<p>the same time consuming a ton of sugar</p>
<p>and corn sugar and high fructose corn</p>
<p>syrup I will guarantee that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>just having fat because the truth is</p>
<p>that when you consume these fats with a</p>
<p>low carbohydrate diet you don&rsquo;t create</p>
<p>that same effect you actually can</p>
<p>improve things you actually restore</p>
<p>function so the danger is adding in the</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;s the wild it&rsquo;s the variable</p>
<p>that messes everything up a lot of the</p>
<p>successes that you see on our site</p>
<p>amazing success on all different levels</p>
<p>these people are doing higher fats but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re cutting their carbs down that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best program for a diabetic thanks</p>
<p>Jody</p>
<p>all right Karen okay good well here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one from Julie she wants to know how</p>
<p>long if you&rsquo;re doing the diet correctly</p>
<p>how long does it take to reverse or</p>
<p>repair insulin resistance yeah good</p>
<p>question it&rsquo;s it depends how long how</p>
<p>chronic it is I&rsquo;ve seen some people who</p>
<p>have a mild version and they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>abused their life like I have with a lot</p>
<p>of sugar so it&rsquo;s pretty quick I mean it</p>
<p>changes immediately and everything is</p>
<p>great and they&rsquo;re the success stories</p>
<p>that you see on social media that oh I</p>
<p>did your program I lost 30 pounds and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back to normal and it took two days</p>
<p>and then like what and then you have</p>
<p>other people who are a little more upset</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not getting the results</p>
<p>of course because they had an underlying</p>
<p>insulin resistant problems for years</p>
<p>previously so that&rsquo;s going to take</p>
<p>longer so it could range anywhere from a</p>
<p>couple weeks to months to a couple years</p>
<p>but the best measurement for insulin</p>
<p>resistance I believe is your way</p>
<p>okay measuring your waist that waist</p>
<p>coming down your insulin is healing and</p>
<p>you if you go out in society look at</p>
<p>people you can tell who has insulin</p>
<p>resistant problems just by the shape of</p>
<p>where their their body is and if they</p>
<p>have a big gut okay you might find some</p>
<p>people with a big gut especially at at</p>
<p>the carnival</p>
<p>the carnivals I would say okay III had</p>
<p>to withhold that yes okay you can find</p>
<p>there is there&rsquo;s everywhere actually you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t spread the problem is that that</p>
<p>the food that you can find in the center</p>
<p>of the grocery store and and just about</p>
<p>every commercial ever noticed that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see a commercial for kale</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t make one you don&rsquo;t see a</p>
<p>commercial for radishes and kale and</p>
<p>green peppers you just don&rsquo;t see it you</p>
<p>see all these commercials for prepared</p>
<p>food and the center of the grocery store</p>
<p>and those are very effective ads and</p>
<p>even the the weight loss plans that are</p>
<p>out there and really televised on</p>
<p>commercials all the time these are</p>
<p>packaged foods</p>
<p>these aren&rsquo;t living food items and this</p>
<p>does even if it if it allows some weight</p>
<p>loss initially it you know people gain</p>
<p>the weight right back it creates a big</p>
<p>belly you see it everywhere I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a Rance have you seen the chest</p>
<p>now that you brought that up Karen I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have to get people the first quiz</p>
<p>of the day so I&rsquo;m gonna ask a question</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna roll that Bell again</p>
<p>okay Rena bring it later but I have to I</p>
<p>have to ask the question okay so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a question guys I want you to</p>
<p>respond on social media get to the</p>
<p>bottom here what food has the most</p>
<p>nutrients of any other food on planet</p>
<p>Earth</p>
<p>okay type in what you think all right</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll come back to that answer most</p>
<p>nutrients yeah and you have most</p>
<p>nutrients nutrient-dense all the foods</p>
<p>on the planet what is the number one</p>
<p>food it&rsquo;s very specific because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>repeater</p>
<p>people who&rsquo;ve seen you before do this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna find out you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>okay okay so now we&rsquo;re gonna go to a</p>
<p>rule from New Jersey go ahead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hi dr. Berg thanks for taking my call</p>
<p>sure I&rsquo;m uh I just give you my profile</p>
<p>first I&rsquo;m a 51 year male working in IT</p>
<p>so I have a certain Terry lifestyle with</p>
<p>a very strong family history of heart</p>
<p>attacks I&rsquo;m coming from India so our</p>
<p>normal diet consists of a lot of our</p>
<p>carbohydrates rice and wheat and with</p>
<p>vegetables and meat but the</p>
<p>predominantly we take carbs as a main a</p>
<p>main source now recently I had an</p>
<p>angioplasty with three stents and I have</p>
<p>high cholesterol I have got high blood</p>
<p>sugar and blood pressure and I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>medications for all three my total</p>
<p>cholesterol is less than 200 but my LDL</p>
<p>B is more higher than the a and then my</p>
<p>HDL is 25 and my triglyceride is 190 my</p>
<p>a1c is at 6.1 it has come down from 6.8</p>
<p>and because of the medication and the</p>
<p>diet that time last six months I am not</p>
<p>purely vegetarian diet I quit</p>
<p>non-vegetarian</p>
<p>based on my doctor&rsquo;s recommendation to</p>
<p>go to a plant-based diet and then I have</p>
<p>found my weight has come down by 15</p>
<p>pounds my numbers are looking good but</p>
<p>after seeing your videos though it makes</p>
<p>a lot of sense to me but all these years</p>
<p>I have been raised with a belief that</p>
<p>eating meat and fat is harmful right no</p>
<p>no no butter no fat no no red meat now</p>
<p>it is kind of challenging to myself to</p>
<p>to adapt to this but yeah but more</p>
<p>importantly my question is when you say</p>
<p>high fat do you mean saturated fat or</p>
<p>unsaturated fat is one question and then</p>
<p>when you take a low-carb are you talking</p>
<p>about the simple carbohydrates or the</p>
<p>complex carbohydrate right and fine</p>
<p>leave both I and my wife we take the</p>
<p>same food why I am getting all this</p>
<p>problem and my wife is not getting so</p>
<p>obviously something is different in the</p>
<p>body style and how it functions right</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m trying to understand the</p>
<p>connection between these two talks thank</p>
<p>you right right question okay so number</p>
<p>one you&rsquo;re coming from a history of a</p>
<p>lot of carbs right so you know you have</p>
<p>the whole thing meats bad saturated fat</p>
<p>is bad and you need more plant-based</p>
<p>okay yeah you do need plant base but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about plant base when you go</p>
<p>into plant base a lot of people they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really go on a plant base they go</p>
<p>in a grain based diet they because think</p>
<p>about even vegetable oils they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>vegetable oils their grain seed oils</p>
<p>okay grain seed oil so the point is that</p>
<p>yes you need the plants in large amounts</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking like greens absolutely but</p>
<p>the the problem you&rsquo;re running into is</p>
<p>trying to get enough protein you need</p>
<p>enough protein on a vegetarian diet you</p>
<p>could do it it&rsquo;s more difficult</p>
<p>personally I think if you added some</p>
<p>high quality protein whether it&rsquo;s fish</p>
<p>or grass-fed you know products or eggs I</p>
<p>think that would help you personally</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s helped a lot of people you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to do a lot you can just do maybe</p>
<p>three to six ounces per meal the other</p>
<p>thing is when I talk about saturated</p>
<p>fats well or just fats in general you</p>
<p>can do coconut oil you can do ghee okay</p>
<p>you can do that in India then they use</p>
<p>it a lot but just to a high quality of</p>
<p>butter do the grass-fed butter you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing you don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>bacon grease you know avocados are great</p>
<p>olives are great olive oil you can do</p>
<p>that but one of the challenges that you</p>
<p>at the end of the day is you need to</p>
<p>have all your nutrients and I suggest</p>
<p>probably you if it&rsquo;s not working for you</p>
<p>your current program get the book see</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re missing and add that in</p>
<p>there and test for yourself this is a</p>
<p>perfect example of instead of trying to</p>
<p>believe a certain way of eating your are</p>
<p>doing something that&rsquo;s not working</p>
<p>exactly like you want it well why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you try this program like I say and</p>
<p>compare the results then you will know</p>
<p>based on your own experience if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna work for you or not</p>
<p>I I come confidence going to work but</p>
<p>you never know by listening to people</p>
<p>and listen to me being confused by this</p>
<p>or that so that&rsquo;s pretty much my</p>
<p>viewpoint and I&rsquo;m sticking to it</p>
<p>but the boy point but my documentary</p>
<p>point is that you also need to include</p>
<p>the intimate of fasting big-time because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna actually bring down your</p>
<p>insulin and really help your heart and a</p>
<p>net note okay that&rsquo;s the end of the</p>
<p>question go ahead Karen do you ever I do</p>
<p>well first of all I&rsquo;m just cracking up</p>
<p>over here because as soon as we mention</p>
<p>I mentioned the commercial somebody said</p>
<p>yeah dr. Berg should make or have people</p>
<p>make commercials about kale and then the</p>
<p>best commercial wins a prize so then as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going down going down going down</p>
<p>then people are like what&rsquo;s the prize</p>
<p>how do I win no no we this is this is</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s idea it&rsquo;s a fun idea okay but</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really exist but okay so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a good question will keto help</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s and adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>well Hashimoto&rsquo;s is an autoimmune</p>
<p>condition where you have low thyroid and</p>
<p>believe it or not what&rsquo;s really bad for</p>
<p>the thyroid is doing the high high</p>
<p>carbohydrate diet it&rsquo;s not healthier</p>
<p>thyroid doesn&rsquo;t need more carbohydrates</p>
<p>what it needs is a combination of keto</p>
<p>and intimate fasting but also selenium</p>
<p>and iodine that would be very beneficial</p>
<p>now you mentioned adrenals there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many conditions of that involve</p>
<p>autoimmune with adrenal in fact if you</p>
<p>take and this is just based on</p>
<p>observation if you take any of these</p>
<p>autoimmune diseases they usually get</p>
<p>triggered from a stress event hmm</p>
<p>interesting that&rsquo;s an interesting clue</p>
<p>and then that means that the adrenals</p>
<p>are involved because adrenals help you</p>
<p>adapt to stress so there&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>connection between the adrenals and</p>
<p>autoimmune so the more you can prove the</p>
<p>adrenal the more you&rsquo;re gonna help my</p>
<p>right so in the book I talk about the a</p>
<p>basic keto in a minute fasting plan but</p>
<p>then you would go</p>
<p>not to the thyroid you go to the adrenal</p>
<p>chapter and start to add more of the</p>
<p>adrenal type recommendations on top of</p>
<p>this basic program I think you can be</p>
<p>successful with that ok all right now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to Florida with Stefan go</p>
<p>ahead you two question I&rsquo;m doing two</p>
<p>meals a day and you said in your videos</p>
<p>that protein you know six seven hours</p>
<p>could be 6:58 but seven was the number I</p>
<p>watched the video now what about the fat</p>
<p>Grimes when we do two meals you know the</p>
<p>rule of thumb was 20 to 40 if you do</p>
<p>three that&rsquo;s question number one and</p>
<p>number two it is uh you know you see in</p>
<p>everything nowadays natural flavors like</p>
<p>Perrier with lemon flavor which has</p>
<p>natural flavors the natural flavors</p>
<p>raise insulin sugar good question okay</p>
<p>so the first question answer the</p>
<p>flavoring question no they&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>natural flavorings are not going to</p>
<p>increase insulin okay they&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to I know the ingredients of these and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very very low carb okay second</p>
<p>question with the fat on two meals a day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be sending it I&rsquo;m gonna be I</p>
<p>created i&rsquo;m creating a calculator a keto</p>
<p>calculator to be able to help you with</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>some people are like okay what are the</p>
<p>calories what are the grams okay and the</p>
<p>other people are like just give me a</p>
<p>ballpark figure I want to go on how my</p>
<p>body responds to that so they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>into the calories so but I want to</p>
<p>answer both I mean if you want to know</p>
<p>the grams it&rsquo;s gonna be between 90 and</p>
<p>100 grams of fat per day okay now the</p>
<p>other thing about that is it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things in the beginning you need</p>
<p>more and towards the middle of the</p>
<p>program you need less and then when you</p>
<p>actually start losing too much weight</p>
<p>you might need to add more so it really</p>
<p>goes on your hunger the hunger is the</p>
<p>best indication between the meals of if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it is enough fat so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m gonna recommend</p>
<p>okay thank you so much Stephanie now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna answer I want to know the</p>
<p>responses on the question what is the</p>
<p>most nutrient-dense food what are some</p>
<p>of the answers okay some of the answers</p>
<p>were kale eggs seaweed</p>
<p>we got raspberries a couple of times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got avocado someone said milk</p>
<p>actually they said milk milk milk milk</p>
<p>milk milk really yes but we did get a</p>
<p>lot of liver organ meats and things like</p>
<p>that okay so you can I have a drum roll</p>
<p>please okay so this is the answer</p>
<p>actually organ meats specifically beef</p>
<p>liver ya know like what we talked about</p>
<p>listen I&rsquo;m just talking about what has</p>
<p>the most nutrients so no one could argue</p>
<p>with that just look it up yourself I</p>
<p>mean beef liver has massive amounts of</p>
<p>vitamin A iron bioavailable iron tons of</p>
<p>like other minerals like zinc and</p>
<p>selenium it has vitamin C actually two</p>
<p>vitamin E vitamin k2 coenzyme q10 that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like for the heart like it has amazing</p>
<p>amounts of protein essential fatty acids</p>
<p>EPA DHA like it has everything in it now</p>
<p>personally I can&rsquo;t eat liver I well I</p>
<p>will eat a small amount I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just telling you that it has a</p>
<p>lot of nutrition in a small amount in</p>
<p>your diet like once or twice a week</p>
<p>probably be a good idea there is you can</p>
<p>get a healthy the key is to get want to</p>
<p>get grass-fed grass-finished we found a</p>
<p>great liverwurst yeah right now there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be two questions that kind of</p>
<p>people are going to ask because of that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna answer them before they show</p>
<p>up on social media number one</p>
<p>I thought the liver was the place where</p>
<p>you store all the toxins right so this</p>
<p>is the next question</p>
<p>your mom is watching hi Marge okay hi</p>
<p>sorry uh-huh hi Marge okay say hello to</p>
<p>your mother hello mom how you doing</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s brings this brings</p>
<p>up the next question okay</p>
<p>and this I kind of already screwed it up</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just gonna have to answer it</p>
<p>because I was going this is the next</p>
<p>true or false question I&rsquo;ve had is is</p>
<p>the liver the organ that stores toxins</p>
<p>what do you think Karen well I live with</p>
<p>you so I know that&rsquo;s not true okay good</p>
<p>so some of you&rsquo;re like wait a second I</p>
<p>thought that liver was a place to</p>
<p>restore toxins no no your fat is where</p>
<p>the toxins are stored the liver is the</p>
<p>organ that neutralizes toxins it changes</p>
<p>the poisons into harmless particles also</p>
<p>the liver is the organ that stores</p>
<p>nutrients can okay so I just screwed</p>
<p>that up but anyway you can get off it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be a cool t-shirt what did you say you</p>
<p>said save the liver same dilemma know</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a good line no there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you said before that I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>to watch the video again you okay go</p>
<p>ahead move along alright so gene is from</p>
<p>Ohio go ahead you had a question yes I</p>
<p>was born with no tires I had all</p>
<p>congenital hypothyroidism and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like taking prescription drugs I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let those rocks and for a while now and</p>
<p>I grew up with at least the first 20</p>
<p>years of my life with armored thyroid I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t afford that get some 40 months</p>
<p>insurance Congress don&rsquo;t cover it I have</p>
<p>been doing internet fastening for</p>
<p>several months now which is helping I</p>
<p>did take a thyroid t3 with my letter</p>
<p>toxin because I know that the enzyme</p>
<p>level toxin does not convert with the t3</p>
<p>I did read that with the bipolar which I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wear like say I have but if I boy</p>
<p>you need t3 also what can I use to help</p>
<p>with my thyroid okay good so the the two</p>
<p>minerals that are really important in</p>
<p>the thyroid</p>
<p>our iodine and selenium okay those are</p>
<p>the two that are really important</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other ones as well</p>
<p>so if you were to get a plant-based</p>
<p>trace mineral product that would be</p>
<p>really really really really good and or</p>
<p>like or seek out a high quality sea kelp</p>
<p>I think that will give you all the trace</p>
<p>minerals that you need that being said</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on in a minute fasting which is</p>
<p>very very smart and really good to do</p>
<p>especially for people with bipolar and</p>
<p>any type of mental illness because it</p>
<p>improves your mood okay it&rsquo;s natural and</p>
<p>because when you take psychiatric</p>
<p>medication for mental disorders in</p>
<p>bipolar what happens is the side effect</p>
<p>that creates insulin resistance so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gain weight so the other thing</p>
<p>and not not to mention other things but</p>
<p>the other thing you want to do is look</p>
<p>at the quality of food that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating in an intimate of fasting make</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s really really high quality</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t neglect the cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>despite what they say about the thyroid</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re taking iodine you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be totally fine and one last</p>
<p>thing if you&rsquo;re doing it fast and guess</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna save a lot of money</p>
<p>you can save up to I don&rsquo;t know five six</p>
<p>hundred dollars a month if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>one meal a day so that way you can take</p>
<p>the extra money and buy your armor which</p>
<p>is a better medication or are actually</p>
<p>hormones for the thigh right thanks gene</p>
<p>all right Karen okay good so I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>combine a bunch of questions together</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;m going to remind everybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s listening that and watching that</p>
<p>probably 96% of the questions that come</p>
<p>up during this live show already have</p>
<p>videos on them if you go to youtube type</p>
<p>in dr. Berg and then you&rsquo;re subject</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see answers to it right</p>
<p>there so don&rsquo;t feel like elected if we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get to you but here&rsquo;s my mom have</p>
<p>any questions Marge Marge we&rsquo;ll find out</p>
<p>do you have a question you have to type</p>
<p>me okay</p>
<p>okay good so a couple of combined</p>
<p>questions here who is the keto diet not</p>
<p>for like if you consider pregnant women</p>
<p>nursing women children seniors people</p>
<p>with sicknesses people with missing</p>
<p>organs people with diseases who</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t do the keto diet okay</p>
<p>so if we&rsquo;re just talking about Kido and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about other Kido other</p>
<p>Kido programs where they&rsquo;re doing maybe</p>
<p>lower quality fats or oils you know that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>talking about the version of Kido it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called healthy Kido that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>recommending a shion&rsquo;s as far as people</p>
<p>doing it it&rsquo;s good for every single</p>
<p>person why is because it&rsquo;s a healthy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of what our bodies need</p>
<p>nutrient wise it&rsquo;s actually it&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>carb moderate protein lots of vegetables</p>
<p>healthy fats I mean that&rsquo;s the perfect</p>
<p>eating plan now the next thing that</p>
<p>people are going to want to know is what</p>
<p>about intermittent fasting oh okay and</p>
<p>then how long do you do it for the rest</p>
<p>of your life I mean why would you want</p>
<p>to go back to the normal diet which is</p>
<p>high carb right that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>purpose right so in a minute fasting</p>
<p>okay is there any anyone that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good for well okay so you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually good for everyone there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some adjustments you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to make like let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>nursing mother so you&rsquo;re not gonna do</p>
<p>one meal today maybe do three meals</p>
<p>today no snacking so you do a mild</p>
<p>version of it now the other point that</p>
<p>comes up is people have history of</p>
<p>eating disorders okay anorexic bulimic</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t do it but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>interesting thing shouldn&rsquo;t you what in</p>
<p>a been fasting okay now I I disagree</p>
<p>because I think if you do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting and you&rsquo;re doing it healthy with</p>
<p>all enough calories what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>is your overall mood is going to</p>
<p>straight up and vertical right because</p>
<p>what happens is it helps your mental</p>
<p>state because you&rsquo;re running on a</p>
<p>different fuel when your mood is higher</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re much more aware of things you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>much more in the present you can make</p>
<p>better decisions you&rsquo;re feeling better</p>
<p>now by our thoughts so our followers are</p>
<p>so cool yeah they&rsquo;re so nice I mean you</p>
<p>have a blood sugar problem you become</p>
<p>irritable you do things that you you</p>
<p>know are you regret you say things you</p>
<p>you know so I think really the enhancing</p>
<p>your mood it brings your state of</p>
<p>beingness it&rsquo;s going to be really good</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just my viewpoint</p>
<p>okay good so I have another question</p>
<p>okay go ahead here&rsquo;s a one that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve ever had before</p>
<p>can Quito help or what would help with</p>
<p>night terrors or sleepwalking okay so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having night terror</p>
<p>what that is it&rsquo;s a very severe b1</p>
<p>deficiency you need a lot of nutritional</p>
<p>yeast especially if you&rsquo;re let&rsquo;s say you</p>
<p>go in Quito and you&rsquo;re adapting into fat</p>
<p>burning and you have like vivid dreams</p>
<p>nightmares whatever what&rsquo;s gonna happen</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re like that&rsquo;s you need more B&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so anytime you&rsquo;re converting to this new</p>
<p>metabolism which is ketosis the B</p>
<p>vitamins are much more involved so you</p>
<p>need nutritional yeast for sure okay</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>next question and this is my last night</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m taking advantage okay</p>
<p>can you use the kale shake powder</p>
<p>instead of vegetables no you can&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an enhancement</p>
<p>it has some kale in there but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to give you enough but that being</p>
<p>said the wheatgrass juice powder does</p>
<p>give a lot of concentrated nutrition so</p>
<p>I would I would say maybe if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do that maybe you need a little</p>
<p>less but you&rsquo;re still gonna need</p>
<p>vegetables and the powder you can put in</p>
<p>your kale shake to make your kale shake</p>
<p>more palatable if you really don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>it or you haven&rsquo;t gotten used to it or</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re gonna pee oh that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll taste great yeah I mean I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>people like they don&rsquo;t like vegetables</p>
<p>okay why well cuz it&rsquo;s a lot of chewing</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;ll just get it predigested you</p>
<p>know I mean I&rsquo;m sure you could buy it</p>
<p>somewhere he&rsquo;s often you know he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good guy he&rsquo;s offered to chew my kale</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;ll chew it for you yeah you know</p>
<p>like like spur you&rsquo;re a good husband</p>
<p>okay next thing this is where we go to</p>
<p>the phones yes okay so Mitchell you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Indiana go ahead</p>
<p>thank you dr. Berg longtime video watch</p>
<p>her first on caller oh great um I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing uh car keto for about five</p>
<p>weeks now I do intermittent fasting a</p>
<p>ratio of 18 to 6 take my ACV I drink my</p>
<p>lemon juice and I do cardio about three</p>
<p>to five times a week and I said I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in</p>
<p>the diet for about five weeks now and</p>
<p>just this week I&rsquo;ve been starting to get</p>
<p>not debilitating but persistent lower</p>
<p>back pain sometimes on my right side</p>
<p>today it&rsquo;s on my left side I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>wondering if that&rsquo;s a kidney issue or if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s anything else I can do to sort</p>
<p>help eliminate that question do you get</p>
<p>any pain in your big toe no not at all</p>
<p>okay have you ever had a kidney stone</p>
<p>never okay so here&rsquo;s the thing that I</p>
<p>would I would I would do first because I</p>
<p>have videos on low back you could go to</p>
<p>my YouTube and then start applying the</p>
<p>techniques I showed you can use this</p>
<p>press on the inside</p>
<p>take care of it but there is one little</p>
<p>factor of certain people that are prone</p>
<p>to kidney stones could start having a</p>
<p>problem with that so here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that you would want to do to make sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s not actually believe</p>
<p>it or not it&rsquo;s not like a kidney calcium</p>
<p>oxalate stone it&rsquo;s more of a uric acid</p>
<p>stone so it could mean that your urine</p>
<p>is a little bit too acid because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in some hardcore ketosis so what you</p>
<p>want to do as an experiment is alkalize</p>
<p>the body a little bit and see if that</p>
<p>problem pain goes away there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>ways to do it</p>
<p>of course the first way is make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a massive count amounts of</p>
<p>vegetables okay the other is taking the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder that I have because</p>
<p>it has a lot of potassium citrate a</p>
<p>thousand and do like three of those in a</p>
<p>day and your pain should go down because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very alkalizing you&rsquo;re taking all</p>
<p>the alkalizing minerals if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have it right away you can just go to</p>
<p>the store and get a calcium magnesium</p>
<p>and take take that on an empty stomach</p>
<p>through the day and see if the pain goes</p>
<p>away then we know it&rsquo;s more of an</p>
<p>acidifying effect and this happens in</p>
<p>the transition but not when you&rsquo;re fully</p>
<p>adapted but in the transition of getting</p>
<p>in the keto so but you&rsquo;re all you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already doing the correct thing but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking lemon juice maybe take a</p>
<p>little bit more outside of vinegar which</p>
<p>is acidic so you want to actually add</p>
<p>more lemon to that maybe you like even</p>
<p>two ounces the day and drink a little</p>
<p>bit more water okay and just to kind of</p>
<p>make sure and if that pain goes away</p>
<p>then we know it&rsquo;s kidding</p>
<p>because you want to isolate it alright</p>
<p>thanks Mitchell people are saying hi to</p>
<p>your mom I love that hey could everybody</p>
<p>just type in hi Marge and give Marge</p>
<p>some love she&rsquo;s awesome mom oh hey yeah</p>
<p>you have a question yeah I do and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s near and dear to me the</p>
<p>question came in does food have anything</p>
<p>to do with hyperactive kids and so my</p>
<p>first two cents on that is is really</p>
<p>considering what&rsquo;s hyper what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unusually active versus what&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>normal active kid but past that what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your what&rsquo;s your feedback to that</p>
<p>question does food have anything to do</p>
<p>with a kid who may be overly well</p>
<p>excitable it&rsquo;s good to have these quiet</p>
<p>kids in the corner or they sit there</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re spoken to</p>
<p>yeah right so um we want my gosh we were</p>
<p>both those kids right oh yeah I was I</p>
<p>would like that here&rsquo;s the thing about</p>
<p>that I mean you you would be literally</p>
<p>shocked if you started these kids on a</p>
<p>low-carb healthy type program I mean</p>
<p>their mood their irritability I mean how</p>
<p>many kid I mean these kids are</p>
<p>hyperactive because they are low and B</p>
<p>vitamins low blood sugar they have no</p>
<p>potassium they don&rsquo;t evil&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>turn him into a a wind-up you know</p>
<p>hyperactive attention deficit kid so oh</p>
<p>my gosh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m gonna write a book for these</p>
<p>for the mood issues and irritable kids</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so easy to fix and what you</p>
<p>need to do is go to the YouTube channel</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m have and type in these recipes</p>
<p>because if you have these great keto</p>
<p>bomb cookies around for the kids they</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t know the difference if it&rsquo;s sugar</p>
<p>or not sugar and you start having that</p>
<p>oh my gosh these kids would be so</p>
<p>healthy alright so we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>Kara from Pennsylvania and you had a</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>Pennsylvania yay hi I have a question I</p>
<p>was thinking her over the summer</p>
<p>actually I had a partial hysterectomy</p>
<p>gall bladder chronic pancreatitis h</p>
<p>pylori</p>
<p>I had a rough summer I started taking</p>
<p>your gallbladder format and changing my</p>
<p>my diet obviously so the keto and 16 my</p>
<p>low stomach acid I&rsquo;ve been feeling way</p>
<p>better the last four days I was getting</p>
<p>like hot chills cold chills for like</p>
<p>four days I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it</p>
<p>and then I go to bed a couple of nights</p>
<p>ago</p>
<p>and I like had like flu-like symptoms so</p>
<p>I was wondering if you think this could</p>
<p>be you know the keto flu or speaks me</p>
<p>something out because I was thrown up</p>
<p>you know I just felt like I had to lube</p>
<p>and yeah and you how long you been doing</p>
<p>this for I have been on the keto diet</p>
<p>for almost four months with one meal for</p>
<p>the last two months</p>
<p>okay yeah I think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>going on with that the fact that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder kind of adds a</p>
<p>little complexity thing so I would add</p>
<p>in acupressure to left and right side</p>
<p>underneath your rib cage for sure I</p>
<p>would do the electrolytes and then the B</p>
<p>vitamins so that that way we can</p>
<p>actually make this transition better but</p>
<p>I think it could be a combination of</p>
<p>something not draining properly through</p>
<p>the the liver and gallbladder or it</p>
<p>could be just a missing element as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re transitioning to this so I would</p>
<p>go back to the basics and maybe make</p>
<p>some adjustments to the amount of fat</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re consuming since you know the</p>
<p>gallbladder may be ease off like it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll bring the stress down from the</p>
<p>liver because now you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>gallbladder so your if you add a lot of</p>
<p>fat it&rsquo;ll stimulus try to stimulate it</p>
<p>and it could create a little bit of a</p>
<p>backup so that&rsquo;s what I would do all</p>
<p>right thanks Karen</p>
<p>all right Karen okay good so that you</p>
<p>guys are awesome there&rsquo;s like 1,000</p>
<p>hellos to your mom</p>

<p>pieces of paper and we we are releasing</p>
<p>a little thing you can click down below</p>
<p>we have a pleasure food document so if</p>
<p>you want some help with different ideas</p>
<p>with pleasure foods to make this go</p>
<p>right click down below and you can get</p>
<p>more information as a download and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be really cool so that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>our giveaway for this time and also any</p>
<p>thing that I say in this show it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>meant to diagnose you or give you all</p>
<p>like any type of medical advice it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just for your entertainment okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for your something the research I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to diagnose you over the</p>
<p>phone check with your doctor before</p>
<p>taking any my recommendations all right</p>
<p>thank you so now we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>Deborah from Jacksonville Florida you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the loan thank you dr. Burke and</p>
<p>Karen it was nice to watch all your</p>
<p>videos and learn a lot</p>
<p>I started intermittent fasting the first</p>
<p>of the year because I started</p>
<p>researching my mother has Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and it runs in our family and I have</p>
<p>severe IBS and once I started keto and</p>
<p>got about two weeks into it my IBS is</p>
<p>totally gone Wow I&rsquo;m so thrilled my</p>
<p>question is my fasting window it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotten down to six hours now I mean six</p>
<p>hours of eating and as it gets shorter</p>
<p>if I go to one meal a day how do I</p>
<p>calculate my calories because you lose</p>
<p>your appetite and to be able to eat that</p>
<p>much at one sitting is that wise to go</p>
<p>to one meal a day and if I do how do I</p>
<p>dress my calories I knew you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>ask that difference so I just released a</p>
<p>video on the calorie confusion people</p>
<p>have when doing keto and fasting because</p>
<p>here you have this pie chart right you</p>
<p>have this pie chart with five percent</p>
<p>car twenty percent protein instead of</p>
<p>other percent fat right now what happens</p>
<p>when you go to intermittent fasting when</p>
<p>you go to two meals in one meal do we</p>
<p>still do the same 1,800 calories or 1500</p>
<p>calories or 2,000 calories well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a big meal especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not hungry for example yesterday I did</p>
<p>one meal a day and I&rsquo;m like I can keep</p>
<p>going I&rsquo;m not even hungry it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like I had to force myself to eat so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to eat that much because</p>
<p>the meal that I&rsquo;m in my body is eating</p>
<p>is my own fat so I&rsquo;m gonna create a</p>
<p>calendar to help you figure this out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a long answer it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little confusing and that&rsquo;s why a lot of</p>
<p>people haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really talked about it yet and I if you</p>
<p>watch this video I just want to</p>
<p>apologize in advance for confusing you</p>
<p>because it is a confusing subject but</p>
<p>just realize there&rsquo;s two things I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>creating a calculator to make it really</p>
<p>easy so you punch in your food and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>kind of tell you where you&rsquo;re at and</p>
<p>give you guidelines and if you go to my</p>
<p>site under the recipes you will see a</p>
<p>lot of those recipes especially the</p>
<p>meals are all based on the percentages</p>
<p>of what you need so you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>actually even worry about it just look</p>
<p>at the meals like oh I can do that</p>
<p>but as you eat less frequent the need</p>
<p>for nutrients goes down so you want to</p>
<p>keep if you&rsquo;re doing one meal a day so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you do seven cups of</p>
<p>vegetables okay and your salad and you</p>
<p>do maybe I don&rsquo;t know eight eight maybe</p>
<p>nine ounces of protein and then the rest</p>
<p>fat and realize you might maybe you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need as much fat because your body</p>
<p>is burning your own fat so that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of something you just have to play</p>
<p>around with until you feel comfortable</p>
<p>with eating because if you stuff in</p>
<p>there 75% of those calories with fat and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like oh my gosh I&rsquo;m bloated for</p>
<p>the next two days that&rsquo;s not gonna be</p>
<p>good all right Thank You Debra for that</p>
<p>question alright so now I have another</p>
<p>question that I want to ask Karen a</p>
<p>question I know I know so this is the</p>
<p>true or false question okay okay</p>
<p>true or false guys yeah okay all right</p>
<p>okay Greek yogurt has more protein than</p>
<p>plain low-fat yogurt well that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fair because they all have Google oh</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re not supposed to look at</p>
<p>there okay so no googling if you answer</p>
<p>it just like okay so go ahead and answer</p>
<p>it okay and then I&rsquo;m gonna answer oh I</p>
<p>need to I have someone on hold for 27</p>
<p>minutes so Cynthia is from Los Angeles</p>
<p>so go ahead Cynthia hi guys hi I mean I</p>
<p>know Annie so a quick question um</p>
<p>so everything Washington ever since but</p>
<p>after doing Kido</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting for about four</p>
<p>months I started turning on allergies</p>
<p>like crazy so I&rsquo;ve never been allergic</p>
<p>to anything in my life and now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>allergic to like egg whites and olive</p>
<p>oil and I&rsquo;m having reaction bad</p>
<p>reactions so I was just wondering can</p>
<p>and you know or intermittent fasting</p>
<p>kind of triggers allergy okay so the</p>
<p>question I have</p>
<p>what is the when you say allergy what is</p>
<p>the reaction that&rsquo;s happening on your</p>
<p>body is it loading is it a skin</p>
<p>sensitivity is it a rash like again</p>
<p>already its skin mainly on my face and I</p>
<p>it just gets puffy in red and cookies</p>
<p>okay radiated so Cynthia that that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>an allergy that&rsquo;s called Kido flu</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m Kido rash and what that is is</p>
<p>that Aaron yeah so as you&rsquo;re burning fat</p>
<p>guess where all the toxins are stored</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re coming out to the fat and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna come out sometimes you to</p>
<p>the skin so there&rsquo;s a couple ways you</p>
<p>can minimize that number one make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing opposite of vinegar with</p>
<p>the meal okay number two you want to</p>
<p>make sure that you&rsquo;re doing a large</p>
<p>quantities of vegetable okay I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>like seven to ten per day that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>actually keep the liver cleaned out and</p>
<p>then the last thing is the B vitamins</p>
<p>you need good amounts of nutritional</p>
<p>yeast that should make that go away this</p>
<p>rationing is a temporary thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not an allergy okay</p>
<p>Thank You Cynthia and so guys we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna end off and also if you wanted to</p>
<p>hear this story because people have been</p>
<p>asking how do we met it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>funny little story we&rsquo;re gonna come back</p>
<p>in about 15 or 20 minutes and share that</p>
<p>with you thank you so much for your</p>
<p>attention and your questions and they</p>
<p>were great and thanks Karen</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see you guys next week or in</p>
<p>15 minutes Oh Greek yogurt yeah yeah I</p>
<p>almost forgot</p>
<p>okay so yeah that&rsquo;s the answer that one</p>
<p>is basically like Greek yogurt does have</p>
<p>more protein than plain low-fat yogurt</p>
<p>thank you okay goodbye</p>
