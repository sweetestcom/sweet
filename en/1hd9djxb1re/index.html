we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about blood proteins the proteins in your blood i&amp;rsquo;m going to try to make it extremely simple and basic because there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of questions about what does high protein or low protein mean in my blood and also high protein in my urine what does that mean okay so there&amp;rsquo;s two main types of protein in the blood now there&amp;rsquo;s additional ones but the two main types of protein are number one albumin which represents about 50 to 60 percent of all your protein in your blood which i&amp;rsquo;m going to explain what that is in a second and then antibodies which is the rest of the protein in your blood which but again these two types of protein represent most the protein in your blood now your liver makes albumin and the purpose of albumin is to hold the fluid in your blood so if there&amp;rsquo;s liver damage you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to hold the fluid in the blood so where is it going to go now it&amp;rsquo;s going to go out through the urine but it&amp;rsquo;s also going to go into your tissues around the cells and we call this edema or swelling in your lower extremities or your legs it can also go into a sac around your abdominal area and that&amp;rsquo;s called the cities societies comes from the word that describes a sac that&amp;rsquo;s holding water and this is why when people have liver damage they tend to get this pot belly so number one albumin holds the fluid in your blood number two it nourishes your tissues and number three it acts as a transport it helps to transport hormones like your thyroid hormones electrolytes like calcium potassium and sodium vitamins certain drugs and fatty acids so you can see that protein is really needed for many different functions now let&amp;rsquo;s shift gears over to the other type of protein which are antibodies antibodies are produced by certain immune cells the b cells that help you in your immunity so they&amp;rsquo;re little y shaped proteins that are like receptors and they connect with something called an antigen now what is an antigen an antigen is just simply a piece of a pathogen or some foreign thing in the body that doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be in the body so you can look at it like a piece of a virus or a piece of a bacteria so antibodies connect to antigens and they do four things number one they neutralize it because the danger of a pathogen like a virus is when it invades the cell it goes underneath the radar and your immune system cannot detect it anymore so it&amp;rsquo;s very very important to prevent or neutralize that antigen or virus from entering the cell so your antibodies will neutralize or get stuck to this virus and kind of leave it out to dry prevent it from doing anything number two antibodies also tag these pathogens for phagocytosis so the phagocytes can go in there and eat them okay so they help identify the good guys from the bad guys and number three antibodies are involved in inflammation and helping destroy pathogens through using inflammation and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to that in other videos that i&amp;rsquo;ve done and number four and this is very interesting if the virus has invaded the cell already the antibody will cause the infected cell to commit suicide so as you can see there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of different strategies going on and the vital importance of this protein in your blood so if your protein is high one reason could be an infection okay there&amp;rsquo;s an immune reaction and now you know a little bit more of what&amp;rsquo;s happening in your body and what it&amp;rsquo;s trying to do it can also indicate dehydration it can also indicate there&amp;rsquo;s some type of cancer in the white blood cells like multiple myeloma now having high or low protein in the blood doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the same thing is happening in the urine okay because if there&amp;rsquo;s high levels of protein in the urine that usually means there is kidney damage now there&amp;rsquo;s other reasons as well i just did a video on that now i&amp;rsquo;m going to put a link down below it could mean that you&amp;rsquo;re consuming too much protein you did intense exercise you&amp;rsquo;re taking a certain type of supplement called creatine but kidney damage is at the top of the list if the kidney is damaged then the filter is damaged and you&amp;rsquo;re not filtering the blood anymore so you&amp;rsquo;re going to have high protein in the urine and your urine is going to be foamy now there&amp;rsquo;s something else that&amp;rsquo;s very interesting when a person consumes excess amounts of water you can also cause higher levels of protein in the urine as well that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily pathogenic it&amp;rsquo;s not a kidney problem it&amp;rsquo;s just you&amp;rsquo;re just drinking too much water and then of course if you&amp;rsquo;re a diabetic you&amp;rsquo;re going to have higher protein in the urine as well because of the massive destruction of what diabetes does to the filtering unit in your kidney all right guys so thanks for watching and i hope you now have a great understanding of blood proteins"><title>High ⧸ Low Protein in Your Blood： What Does It Mean？ ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

the proteins in your blood i&rsquo;m going to try  </p><p>to make it extremely simple and basic because 
there&rsquo;s been a lot of questions about what does  </p><p>high protein or low protein mean in my blood and 
also high protein in my urine what does that mean  </p><p>okay so there&rsquo;s two main types of protein in the 
blood now there&rsquo;s additional ones but the two main  </p><p>types of protein are number one albumin 
which represents about 50 to 60 percent  </p><p>of all your protein in your blood which i&rsquo;m 
going to explain what that is in a second  </p><p>and then antibodies which is the rest of 
the protein in your blood which but again  </p><p>these two types of protein represent most 
the protein in your blood now your liver  </p><p>makes albumin and the purpose of albumin 
is to hold the fluid in your blood  </p><p>so if there&rsquo;s liver damage you&rsquo;re not going 
to be able to hold the fluid in the blood  </p><p>so where is it going to go now it&rsquo;s going to go 
out through the urine but it&rsquo;s also going to go  </p><p>into your tissues around the cells and we call 
this edema or swelling in your lower extremities  </p><p>or your legs it can also go into a sac around 
your abdominal area and that&rsquo;s called the cities  </p><p>societies comes from the word that describes a 
sac that&rsquo;s holding water and this is why when  </p><p>people have liver damage they tend to get this 
pot belly so number one albumin holds the fluid  </p><p>in your blood number two it nourishes your tissues 
and number three it acts as a transport it helps  </p><p>to transport hormones like your thyroid hormones 
electrolytes like calcium potassium and sodium  </p><p>vitamins certain drugs and fatty acids so you 
can see that protein is really needed for many  </p><p>different functions now let&rsquo;s shift gears 
over to the other type of protein which are  </p><p>antibodies antibodies are produced by certain 
immune cells the b cells that help you in  </p><p>your immunity so they&rsquo;re little y 
shaped proteins that are like receptors  </p><p>and they connect with something called an 
antigen now what is an antigen an antigen is just  </p><p>simply a piece of a pathogen or some foreign thing 
in the body that doesn&rsquo;t need to be in the body  </p><p>so you can look at it like a piece of a virus or 
a piece of a bacteria so antibodies connect to  </p><p>antigens and they do four things number one they 
neutralize it because the danger of a pathogen  </p><p>like a virus is when it invades the cell it goes 
underneath the radar and your immune system cannot  </p><p>detect it anymore so it&rsquo;s very very important 
to prevent or neutralize that antigen or virus  </p><p>from entering the cell so your antibodies will 
neutralize or get stuck to this virus and kind of  </p><p>leave it out to dry prevent it from doing anything 
number two antibodies also tag these pathogens  </p><p>for phagocytosis so the phagocytes can go in there 
and eat them okay so they help identify the good  </p><p>guys from the bad guys and number three antibodies 
are involved in inflammation and helping destroy  </p><p>pathogens through using inflammation and there&rsquo;s 
a lot more to that in other videos that i&rsquo;ve done  </p><p>and number four and this is very interesting 
if the virus has invaded the cell already  </p><p>the antibody will cause the infected cell 
to commit suicide so as you can see there&rsquo;s  </p><p>a lot of different strategies going on and the 
vital importance of this protein in your blood  </p><p>so if your protein is high one reason could be an 
infection okay there&rsquo;s an immune reaction and now  </p><p>you know a little bit more of what&rsquo;s happening in 
your body and what it&rsquo;s trying to do it can also  </p><p>indicate dehydration it can also indicate there&rsquo;s 
some type of cancer in the white blood cells like  </p><p>multiple myeloma now having high or low protein in 
the blood doesn&rsquo;t mean the same thing is happening  </p><p>in the urine okay because if there&rsquo;s high levels 
of protein in the urine that usually means  </p><p>there is kidney damage now there&rsquo;s other reasons 
as well i just did a video on that now i&rsquo;m going  </p><p>to put a link down below it could mean that 
you&rsquo;re consuming too much protein you did  </p><p>intense exercise you&rsquo;re taking a certain type of 
supplement called creatine but kidney damage is at  </p><p>the top of the list if the kidney is damaged then 
the filter is damaged and you&rsquo;re not filtering the  </p><p>blood anymore so you&rsquo;re going to have high protein 
in the urine and your urine is going to be foamy  </p><p>now there&rsquo;s something else that&rsquo;s very interesting 
when a person consumes excess amounts of water  </p><p>you can also cause higher levels of protein 
in the urine as well that&rsquo;s not necessarily  </p><p>pathogenic it&rsquo;s not a kidney problem it&rsquo;s just 
you&rsquo;re just drinking too much water and then of  </p><p>course if you&rsquo;re a diabetic you&rsquo;re going to have 
higher protein in the urine as well because of  </p><p>the massive destruction of what diabetes does 
to the filtering unit in your kidney all right  </p><p>guys so thanks for watching and i hope you now 
have a great understanding of blood proteins</p><p>before you go if you have a question about a 
product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to  </p><p>know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you 
need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth  </p><p>i have a keto consultant standing 
by to help you this is just for the  </p><p>people in the u.s hopefully in the future 
we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
