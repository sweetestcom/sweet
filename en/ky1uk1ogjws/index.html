intermittent</p><p>fasting so bring your questions anything</p><p>that I say is not meant to diagnose or</p><p>replace your medical care just check</p><p>with your professional</p><p>physician before implementing any of the</p><p>things we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p><p>and I just like to Dive Right In Steve</p><p>over to you as usual okay well we have</p><p>uh first of all let&rsquo;s go off with</p><p>Christy from Baton Rouge she&rsquo;s pulling</p><p>the handles of Industry she&rsquo;s a big deal</p><p>at some grocery store chain counting all</p><p>the money and I hope I didn&rsquo;t bust you</p><p>with that uh Christy it&rsquo;s awful noisy in</p><p>there no okay there you go not at all</p><p>all right one question 30 seconds go</p><p>good morning Dr Berg and I just want to</p><p>start out by saying thank you so very</p><p>much for all of your time and all of</p><p>your effort that you put into us the</p><p>main question that I have is in doing</p><p>the body type uh questionnaire</p><p>um I tested more to the ovarian side but</p><p>I noticed though that my body is</p><p>changing unfortunately into the adrenal</p><p>side but I do know that in the years</p><p>past I&rsquo;ve had insulin resistance to deal</p><p>with and things like that I&rsquo;m not as bad</p><p>with it now because I have changed my</p><p>eatings but my main question is in</p><p>transitioning body types trying to</p><p>retain what I have I have lost a lot of</p><p>my muscle tone already unfortunately is</p><p>there a recommended vitamin regimen and</p><p>I do use a decent bit of your products I</p><p>also use some oil-based</p><p>supplements as well and so my question</p><p>is is there kind of a a regimen or</p><p>things that I need to incorporate in a</p><p>particular way to get the best results</p><p>in that body transitioning type and I&rsquo;m</p><p>trying to do the intermittent fasting as</p><p>well as working into Keto</p><p>got it what is your age I am oh 52 this</p><p>year okay well that&rsquo;s exactly where</p><p>menopause occurs at 52. right so what</p><p>happens</p><p>when you go through this shift uh you</p><p>have um</p><p>this backup</p><p>uh Oregon called the adrenals that are</p><p>backing up the ovaries because the</p><p>ovaries are going in retirement right</p><p>now and they produce the same hormones</p><p>but</p><p>if there is additional stress</p><p>which probably is not in your case</p><p>you&rsquo;re probably completely stress-free</p><p>um then what happens is that the the raw</p><p>material to build up those</p><p>hormones go to the adrenal at the</p><p>neglect of the ovaries so now we have</p><p>this imbalance and uh because there&rsquo;s</p><p>nothing left to build up the ovarian</p><p>hormones and that that&rsquo;s when you need</p><p>the estrogen for bone uh growth and that</p><p>type of thing and plus cortisol the</p><p>adrenals is very destructive it&rsquo;s a</p><p>catabolic hormone</p><p>um so uh what you need to do is the most</p><p>important thing is to</p><p>um</p><p>you know do whatever you can to handle</p><p>the stress whatever that is and actively</p><p>and aggressively</p><p>watch my videos and just you know I</p><p>would give you a lot of advice on that</p><p>but the raw material for not just the</p><p>adrenal hormones</p><p>but the other hormones estrogen</p><p>progesterone testosterone are is</p><p>cholesterol</p><p>so don&rsquo;t be afraid to consume enough</p><p>butter egg yolks animal fats like don&rsquo;t</p><p>go low on that because that&rsquo;s like the</p><p>raw material to make because they&rsquo;re all</p><p>cholesterol-based hormones</p><p>so um the other supplement that might</p><p>benefit you in small amounts is DHEA</p><p>that&rsquo;s another precursor okay so that&rsquo;s</p><p>another thing that might help you but</p><p>you know supplements that are geared</p><p>towards adrenal adaptogens uh</p><p>a desiccated adrenal supporting adrenal</p><p>is going to be what you need to do and I</p><p>have a lot of data on like the adrenal</p><p>body type</p><p>um okay so that&rsquo;s kind of what you need</p><p>to do right now but um</p><p>yeah getting that muscle back involves</p><p>sufficient amount of quality protein</p><p>eggs being at the top of the list</p><p>um have enough of that and also the</p><p>combination of a lot of exercise to</p><p>stimulate the muscles to prevent that</p><p>atrophy</p><p>the walking or the hit</p><p>I would do a combination of both because</p><p>you you also need to kind of work the</p><p>muscle to make it grow or else it just</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t grow regardless of how much</p><p>protein you have</p><p>um</p><p>but do you want to make sure you have</p><p>enough protein and it has to be quality</p><p>and I just actually I didn&rsquo;t release it</p><p>but I just um I have a video coming up</p><p>that you I think you&rsquo;ll like that</p><p>talks about</p><p>um protein and going Beyond just</p><p>consuming dietary protein go on the</p><p>exercise what nutrition you need I think</p><p>you&rsquo;ll like that just to preserve your</p><p>muscles as you go</p><p>you know into the uh</p><p>you know Advanced uh aging process</p><p>So you you&rsquo;re more advanced then you&rsquo;ll</p><p>be okay absolutely well Christy do I</p><p>need that dim estrogen or no</p><p>um I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think you need it</p><p>unless you&rsquo;re estrogen dominant but from</p><p>what you told me it sounds like um</p><p>you just need to provide what the</p><p>adrenals needs so then so you it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>steal the hormones from the other other</p><p>parts of your body so because it&rsquo;s kind</p><p>of like a during stress the body</p><p>allocates resources to stress at the</p><p>neglect of other things</p><p>surrogate well thank you so much Christy</p><p>got to move along but we would love to</p><p>hear back from you after you uh complete</p><p>um the transition and so on and feel</p><p>terrific</p><p>uh for the rest of your life Etc why</p><p>don&rsquo;t we kick things off with a quiz</p><p>question now after that great chat with</p><p>Christy and there it is</p><p>all right so what is the one and only</p><p>wheat product that is acceptable for the</p><p>ketogenic diet I know everyone likes the</p><p>bread pasta cereal crackers and things</p><p>like that but what what</p><p>um what&rsquo;s that one wheat product that</p><p>you can consume in unlimited amounts and</p><p>not ever have to worry about it you&rsquo;ve</p><p>piqued our interest Dr bird all right I</p><p>I could imagine I piqued your interest</p><p>for sure that&rsquo;s right do you mean Krispy</p><p>Kreme Donuts or back on the plate I</p><p>can&rsquo;t wait to hear all right let&rsquo;s see</p><p>so uh anyway let&rsquo;s find out if there&rsquo;s</p><p>anyone interested in the show at all</p><p>apparently there are and let&rsquo;s say hello</p><p>to our viewers joining us today from UK</p><p>Canada Mexico Jordan Oman the Czech</p><p>Republic Ireland Greece the Netherlands</p><p>New Zealand Poland France Pakistan</p><p>Norway the Virgin Islands uh marites uh</p><p>thank you</p><p>spell spelling that Chile Germany Sweden</p><p>Brazil Japan Colombia Nepal Israel</p><p>Austria Trinidad and Tobago Cuba Iceland</p><p>welcome Cuba Scotland India Ethiopia</p><p>Switzerland Ghana Australia South Africa</p><p>Slovenia Nigeria Brunei Brunei excuse me</p><p>Mongolia wow Bangladesh Atria the</p><p>Philippines Uganda Belgium Italy Armenia</p><p>Peru Finland Saudi Arabia North Cyprus</p><p>Argentina the United Arab Emirates Qatar</p><p>Malaysia Puerto Rico what a list the</p><p>Dominican Republic and then of course</p><p>all across these United States of</p><p>America so thank you so much everybody</p><p>for listening and making the show of</p><p>success and making your health a success</p><p>as a result that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re after here</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go over to</p><p>social media and Bruce from YouTube</p><p>wants to know if kombucha is good for us</p><p>you gotta you gotta be careful about</p><p>kombucha because um you know</p><p>a while ago you could find it with like</p><p>two grams of sugar but nowadays it&rsquo;s</p><p>like you read the label like what&rsquo;s 12</p><p>grams of sugar 16 grams of sugar that&rsquo;s</p><p>a lot of sugar because they make it out</p><p>of sugar and they make it out of sugar</p><p>and black tea so um I think the um</p><p>the acids in there</p><p>do help the digestive system</p><p>um but I think there&rsquo;s some better uh</p><p>digestive fermented products I think</p><p>there are like kefir sauerkraut kimchi</p><p>um</p><p>but I will say if let&rsquo;s say for example</p><p>um you have um</p><p>somewhat of a craving for alcohol</p><p>Kombucha tea is a good alternative</p><p>because it gives you the texture it</p><p>gives you the calmness and it&rsquo;s kind of</p><p>like a carbonated beverage that you can</p><p>pretend like you&rsquo;re drinking a beer and</p><p>create similar effects so I think for</p><p>that purpose that would be good</p><p>okay very good let&rsquo;s go to the first</p><p>question from this morning A lot of</p><p>times they get neglected because they</p><p>all spin up past me so I&rsquo;ve gone back</p><p>for your question Tara from YouTube what</p><p>kind of diet would you recommend for</p><p>someone with</p><p>pulsatile tinnitus since I&rsquo;ve started</p><p>keto I can hear my heartbeat in my ear</p><p>it stopped briefly in February but</p><p>dagnabbit is returned in March</p><p>that is a classic potassium deficiency</p><p>when you go on keto you lose a lot of</p><p>water weight you lose glycogen and in</p><p>the glycogen which is stored sugar you</p><p>have potassium so that actually goes</p><p>away and this is why when I when I</p><p>recommend doing the ketogenic diet I uh</p><p>you know make sure you take B vitamins</p><p>make sure you take your electrolytes in</p><p>a definitely a potassium you need a lot</p><p>of it you need like 4 700 milligrams</p><p>very few people know what that means uh</p><p>they think if they have a banana a day</p><p>which is not keto</p><p>that&rsquo;ll give them enough banana only</p><p>gives you 300 milligrams you need 4 700</p><p>how many times Steve does 300 go into 4</p><ol start=700><li>yes</li></ol><p>okay good a lot so you need a lot of</p><p>potassium to be able to</p><p>um kind of just get your rdas</p><p>um and so you know big salads vegetables</p><p>things like that</p><p>um you can get potassium from other from</p><p>meat products too</p><p>um but the point is that um</p><p>I think with a little extra potassium</p><p>you will that pulse pulsing in the ear</p><p>will go away</p><p>okay sharing from YouTube when you are</p><p>in ketosis does the body stay in ketosis</p><p>should your keto strips always indicate</p><p>that you&rsquo;re in ketosis</p><p>well if your keto strips are saying</p><p>you&rsquo;re in ketosis you&rsquo;re in ketosis</p><p>um but what happens it&rsquo;s like um</p><p>it&rsquo;s an either or either you&rsquo;re burning</p><p>carbs or being sugar now there&rsquo;s 10 of</p><p>degrees of this but it&rsquo;s it there&rsquo;s a</p><p>a little carb</p><p>which basically triggers insulin will</p><p>knock you out of key it just like</p><p>switches right back to Sugar metabolism</p><p>so you&rsquo;re not going to be burning fat</p><p>very much at all so um the point is that</p><p>that&rsquo;s why</p><p>um the secret to this whole thing of</p><p>staying in ketosis is is lower in carbs</p><p>um that is the the single thing that you</p><p>have to focus on so the body will do um</p><p>I kind of as a priority it wants to</p><p>regulate sugar and so</p><p>um it wants to keep the sugar normal</p><p>that&rsquo;s kind of like the stable point but</p><p>everything revolves around so</p><p>um</p><p>so you know if you if you carbs a little</p><p>too high you&rsquo;re no longer in ketosis</p><p>um it should show up in your urine</p><p>um</p><p>I think urine tests uh are some are good</p><p>in the beginning but not later because</p><p>once you adapt to ketosis you&rsquo;re going</p><p>to be more efficient you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>burn up these ketones right</p><p>if you&rsquo;re burning up ketones are you</p><p>going to have any extra in your urine</p><p>no because you&rsquo;re burning them up so all</p><p>of a sudden it doesn&rsquo;t show up in the</p><p>air and you think oh my gosh I&rsquo;m not</p><p>into ketosis a better thing to do is to</p><p>check your blood that would be a better</p><p>way to know if you&rsquo;re really in ketosis</p><p>or not</p><p>all right very good well we asked the</p><p>question what is the one and only wheat</p><p>product that is acceptable to the</p><p>ketogenic diet and I&rsquo;ve disappointed</p><p>that not one person said six Krispy</p><p>Kreme Donuts instead ninety percent of a</p><p>respondents say it is wheat grass and</p><p>the other 10 say it&rsquo;s sprouts</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a product that</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t really resemble a bread but it&rsquo;s</p><p>the the when you sprout the wheat</p><p>um it&rsquo;s still wheat right it&rsquo;s the plant</p><p>it&rsquo;s not the grain the grain is how they</p><p>make the flour and then the breads so</p><p>when you sprout</p><p>um wheat grain</p><p>you uh and you capture it before it</p><p>grows too high it doesn&rsquo;t have any</p><p>grains in it so there&rsquo;s no gluten</p><p>there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s very little if any</p><p>oxalates maybe there&rsquo;s a tiny bit but</p><p>there&rsquo;s not much</p><p>um there&rsquo;s going to be lower levels if</p><p>any of phytates or phytic acid</p><p>so so you get rid of all the bad stuff</p><p>and then the gluten there&rsquo;s no gluten in</p><p>it because there&rsquo;s no grains developing</p><p>the grains happen later in that plant&rsquo;s</p><p>life</p><p>so wow that&rsquo;s you get all the benefits</p><p>of this wonderful grass</p><p>but without the bad stuff now that grass</p><p>is um</p><p>70 of its chlorophyll chlorophyll</p><p>actually has the ability to make</p><p>red blood cells because it&rsquo;s identical</p><p>to your own blood except for manganese</p><p>blood is iron</p><p>chlorophyll is manganese so you can</p><p>actually stimulates blood there&rsquo;s also</p><p>other properties</p><p>in this wheatgrass that increase white</p><p>blood cells and thrombocytes which have</p><p>you help you clotting so there&rsquo;s this</p><p>condition called thalassemia which is a</p><p>genetic thing where you&rsquo;re very very</p><p>anemic and unfortunately like</p><p>the only treatment is like bone marrow</p><p>transplant and maybe a blood transplant</p><p>plant but</p><p>they&rsquo;re using wheatgrass to help that</p><p>condition and seems to be helping these</p><p>help these people so if there&rsquo;s anything</p><p>going on with the blood especially in</p><p>the anemia area I think chlorophyll is a</p><p>really good good thing so</p><p>the on the flip side when you have the</p><p>wheat</p><p>it literally destroys the lining of the</p><p>colon okay destroys the lining of your</p><p>colon leaky gut gives you all sorts of</p><p>problems even like Hashimoto&rsquo;s things</p><p>like that but then the wheatgrass juice</p><p>can actually heal the inside of the</p><p>colon because it doesn&rsquo;t have gluten and</p><p>it has things that can actually support</p><p>the lining of the colon so anyway I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s very very interesting but of</p><p>course</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t taste the same does it Steve</p><p>yeah certainly I would go bread out of</p><p>the oven with the butter it just doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>taste the same it certainly does but</p><p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what else isn&rsquo;t the same</p><p>as everyone you go to the colonoscopy</p><p>they&rsquo;ll do the uh what&rsquo;s the name uh</p><p>yeah right do you have a colonoscopy</p><p>they say you have diverticulitis it&rsquo;s</p><p>almost a given that someone has it</p><p>however I just heard from a guy who his</p><p>colon perforated from Diverticulitis and</p><p>he almost died I mean it is a serious</p><p>problem when it goes on uh to a degree</p><p>where it gets really bad so even though</p><p>it&rsquo;s so common coming out of that beware</p><p>that&rsquo;s not a good condition to have in</p><p>its extent so therefore my diet that I</p><p>wish I could do but can&rsquo;t is not</p><p>recommended so let&rsquo;s see how about uh</p><p>right so Athena from YouTube uh wants to</p><p>know what diet supplements do you</p><p>recommend for someone with celiac</p><p>disease speaking of the colon</p><p>well cilia comes from that um that</p><p>gluten thing right so the diet you need</p><p>to be on is a no grain diet and I would</p><p>actually probably get off all fibers and</p><p>grow on the the carnivore for a while</p><p>because</p><p>um you won&rsquo;t be able to tolerate very</p><p>many fibers because there&rsquo;s all this</p><p>inflammation going on in the gut</p><p>so</p><p>um that being said one thing that you</p><p>potentially could do</p><p>is juice cabbage and have the cabbage</p><p>juice</p><p>uh it has a really interesting</p><p>properties</p><p>for in on many different levels to heal</p><p>uh ulcers in the digestive system reduce</p><p>inflammation</p><p>and I did a video on it so cabbage juice</p><p>is what I would recommend</p><p>okay very good and let&rsquo;s continue with</p><p>our shout out to some latecomers in</p><p>Spain Romania Jamaica Azerbaijan</p><p>Azerbaijan Somalia nambia Hong Kong</p><p>Haiti and Madagascar boy they are all</p><p>over the place thank you all so much for</p><p>listening</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s see what can we do next okay</p><p>we&rsquo;re uh why don&rsquo;t we go with another</p><p>question doc</p><p>all right which nutrient deficiency</p><p>leaves you with those little white dots</p><p>and lines</p><p>on your nails</p><p>like the white horizontal</p><p>kind of lines they could be kind of</p><p>thicker too but what nutrient deficiency</p><p>will give you those</p><p>okay very good while we&rsquo;re waiting for</p><p>that answer why don&rsquo;t we go to Carolyn</p><p>from New Jersey</p><p>and oh my goodness she just popped off</p><p>let&rsquo;s try instead Samir</p><p>and he is from Toronto your old haunt</p><p>Samir you&rsquo;re on with Dr bird</p><p>hello hello Dr Berg thank you so much</p><p>for everything you do you&rsquo;ve really been</p><p>a lifesaver</p><p>and you know this this is my second time</p><p>on so</p><p>my question this time is a little bit</p><p>more serious than uh oh I&rsquo;m sorry my go</p><p>ahead say that again</p><p>sorry yes uh basically my question is</p><p>um my father-in-law he had an ischemic</p><p>stroke</p><p>about three weeks ago he&rsquo;s uh 75 years</p><p>old he doesn&rsquo;t have any other like he</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have diabetes but he does suffer</p><p>from hypertension</p><p>um so after the stroke he&rsquo;s been left</p><p>sort of almost paralyzed on his left</p><p>side of the body</p><p>so you know I mean we&rsquo;ve been having</p><p>difficulty keeping his blood pressure</p><p>under control as well uh the good thing</p><p>is I gave him some of your electrolytes</p><p>and apparently that had a very good</p><p>effect in lowering his blood pressure</p><p>for a few days I think going forward my</p><p>question is what&rsquo;s the best thing we can</p><p>give him and or what&rsquo;s the best thing he</p><p>can do to recover from from this episode</p><p>so what I would do</p><p>in that situation is I would of course</p><p>hopefully he&rsquo;s on the ketogenic diet the</p><p>healthy version and doing intermittent</p><p>fasting</p><p>but the other thing I would do is I</p><p>would um</p><p>start start them on tocotrinals that</p><p>will actually help the circulation in</p><p>the vascular system in his brain and all</p><p>through the arteries</p><p>I would also recommend methylene blue</p><p>40</p><p>drops a day in water probably put it</p><p>with electrolytes because it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>taste that great but the methylene blue</p><p>is fascinating it works deep in the um</p><p>the brain cells and other cells in the</p><p>mitochondria they give it oxygen in fact</p><p>it&rsquo;s one of the remedies</p><p>that doctors recommend if you have a</p><p>stroke</p><p>because of this actually helps to repair</p><p>the damaged</p><p>cells and neurons and bypass the damaged</p><p>cells and just give it oxygen and it&rsquo;s</p><p>like a sponge it just kind of cleans up</p><p>a lot of</p><p>things that are creating problems</p><p>without giving you too many big words I</p><p>would also</p><p>um</p><p>you know um</p><p>let&rsquo;s say vitamin E which is the form of</p><p>ethylene blue and garlic garlic also</p><p>anti-thrombosis and then the ketogenic</p><p>diet that&rsquo;s what I would do and um</p><p>and also he&rsquo;s already taking the</p><p>potassium for the blood pressure but</p><p>then vitamin D also for the blood</p><p>pressure I&rsquo;m</p><p>people are deficient in vitamin D that</p><p>that&rsquo;s another thing that can keep the</p><p>pressure high</p><p>but vitamin D is like a natural it&rsquo;s one</p><p>of the best natural anti-inflammatories</p><p>so that&rsquo;s a really good one too</p><p>so Dr Berg I just on the tocotrinos</p><p>front that&rsquo;s one thing I really wanted</p><p>to give him but there&rsquo;s always I read</p><p>warnings that you cannot use tall</p><p>katrinos with other blood thinners so is</p><p>that an issue or</p><p>you just have to work that out with your</p><p>doctor I can&rsquo;t tell you yes or no but it</p><p>does thin the blood but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not um</p><p>it&rsquo;s not a synthetic thing right so it</p><p>um</p><p>it does thin the blood it prevents</p><p>thrombosis thrombosis but it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>it&rsquo;s not going to go to the extreme uh</p><p>and it&rsquo;s also not going to create</p><p>internal bleeding but it has a lot of</p><p>other</p><p>effects for the inside of the vascular</p><p>system to help protect against</p><p>all sorts of damage it&rsquo;s one of the most</p><p>it&rsquo;s one of the best antioxidants for</p><p>the vascular system that&rsquo;s why I like it</p><p>but check with your doc to see if you</p><p>could take it but um</p><p>but I do understand the situation trying</p><p>to work with the doctor that will</p><p>allow you to do natural things sometimes</p><p>they just don&rsquo;t understand it so you</p><p>have to educate them and hopefully</p><p>they&rsquo;re open-minded to try new things</p><p>so thank you so much Dr Berg once again</p><p>you&rsquo;re welcome you&rsquo;re welcome all right</p><p>thanks Amir and we&rsquo;re all uh pulling for</p><p>your I guess it was your father or</p><p>father-in-law but that&rsquo;s a terrible</p><p>thing to have and we hope that all is</p><p>well we&rsquo;d love to hear back from you</p><p>again about his uh hopefully his great</p><p>recovery okay Dr Berg we have an astute</p><p>audience as always and quiz question</p><p>number two asks which nutrition nutrient</p><p>deficiency leaves you with those little</p><p>Annoying white dots on your nails and</p><p>the audience has an answer 65 percent of</p><p>our respondents say zinc 20 say it&rsquo;s</p><p>calcium 10 say it&rsquo;s B1 and the remaining</p><p>five percent say it&rsquo;s vitamin C they&rsquo;re</p><p>all over the place doc let&rsquo;s reel them</p><p>in</p><p>it&rsquo;s zinc zinc</p><p>if you&rsquo;re deficient in zinc you have</p><p>these little white specks and um</p><p>what usually cause the deficiency of</p><p>zinc is those refined carbs and sugar</p><p>right where alcohol or even stress but</p><p>um yeah so you have those white little</p><p>specks and another interesting thing</p><p>about the nails</p><p>um with the zinc deficiencies you&rsquo;ll get</p><p>this little</p><p>in infection or swollen uh red cuticle</p><p>if you ever see that that&rsquo;s the zinc</p><p>deficiency</p><p>um</p><p>you know people tend to think of a zinc</p><p>deficiency you lose your sense of smell</p><p>but you also lose your sense of tasting</p><p>flavors</p><p>everything is Bland you can&rsquo;t really</p><p>differentiate flavors</p><p>and even sometimes the flavors become</p><p>bitter</p><p>um like metallic or like a chemical</p><p>and so it really ruins your ability to</p><p>experience food which is really bad so</p><p>um</p><p>Steve question if you if you um</p><p>if you knew long no longer could taste</p><p>food or differentiating flavors wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>that be a problem I mean especially or</p><p>it might be a good thing to avoid then</p><p>junk food right oh it&rsquo;d be a blessing in</p><p>my case I can tell you that just bring</p><p>on the cardboard flavor</p><p>take it</p><p>everything tastes like cardboard boy</p><p>you&rsquo;d probably start eating healthy why</p><p>not</p><p>yeah all right let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we</p><p>just whisk through these questions</p><p>they&rsquo;re so exciting here&rsquo;s a true falcer</p><p>now by the way 65 percent of the last</p><p>ones were very smart the rest of you I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to give you a chance to redeem</p><p>yourself because this one&rsquo;s 50 50.</p><p>all right true or false it takes carbon</p><p>dioxide</p><p>to allow oxygen to enter your cells</p><p>that seems counterintuitive but</p><p>let&rsquo;s see what the audience says on that</p><p>one okay and let&rsquo;s go back to social</p><p>media I have neglected them for a few</p><p>minutes uh</p><p>Yesenia from YouTube why would blood</p><p>pressure drop oh this is well why would</p><p>blood pressure drop all of a sudden she</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t give me any more detail but sir</p><p>make anything of that</p><p>um well maybe maybe you stopped eating</p><p>salt I don&rsquo;t know um but it can also</p><p>drop if you have weak adrenals too</p><p>um</p><p>um in fact one of the tests to determine</p><p>like adrenal strength is called raglan&rsquo;s</p><p>test which when you stand up quickly or</p><p>you stand up and your blood pressure</p><p>goes down it should go up it goes down</p><p>and you&rsquo;re like wow I feel really dizzy</p><p>um but that&rsquo;s more like a a temporary</p><p>thing</p><p>but typically if it&rsquo;s like just low</p><p>blood pressure it could be that you&rsquo;re</p><p>not drinking enough fluids or you&rsquo;re not</p><p>having enough salt</p><p>so you need more blood so</p><p>um don&rsquo;t be afraid to have more sea salt</p><p>very good hope that helps okay let&rsquo;s see</p><p>uh Farmer John from YouTube Dr Berg why</p><p>does eating grapefruit uh the only thing</p><p>that stops my gerd</p><p>there are um</p><p>some</p><p>phytonutrients in grapefruit that</p><p>um</p><p>are actually really good for your</p><p>digestive system</p><p>um and they&rsquo;re a bit like a kind of an</p><p>antacid type thing and so there&rsquo;s</p><p>definitely something in there um I think</p><p>you might experience the same thing in</p><p>either broccoli Sprouts or cabbage</p><p>um because it&rsquo;s uh there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some</p><p>things in there that actually help the</p><p>digest the system but I recently did a</p><p>video on GERD and that gives you a</p><p>better</p><p>understanding of what&rsquo;s behind GERD and</p><p>um to correct it rather than just try to</p><p>you know take something to mitigate the</p><p>symptoms</p><p>gerd typically is associated with um a</p><p>valve problem which is also associated</p><p>with a the stomach acid not being strong</p><p>enough so having enough</p><p>stomach acid by taking butane</p><p>hydrochloride can potentially even</p><p>correct that so watch my videos on that</p><p>and see if that doesn&rsquo;t give you some</p><p>ideas all right very good we&rsquo;re going to</p><p>go back we&rsquo;ve had shamalia on once she&rsquo;s</p><p>um I think from the UK and shamali</p><p>you&rsquo;re kind of noisy there but go ahead</p><p>with your one question and let&rsquo;s hear it</p><p>in 30 seconds uh Stand By and you&rsquo;re on</p><p>with Dr Berg</p><p>thank you Dr Berg thank you so much for</p><p>having us I&rsquo;m making the world healthy</p><p>which is really good</p><p>um I I have been diagnosed with alpha</p><p>one entry antitrypsin Dutch deficiency</p><p>in my liver</p><p>uh it&rsquo;s about</p><p>um</p><p>the the consultant said that it&rsquo;s been</p><p>having with me since I was born but I</p><p>found out last November last year and</p><p>also I have fatty liver and then I was</p><p>asked to get</p><p>um spirometry test which came out really</p><p>good as well as the liver ultrasound</p><p>which we I got the results two days ago</p><p>and it was looking good but I&rsquo;m not too</p><p>sure about what to do what to eat and</p><p>everything but I did I&rsquo;ve been listening</p><p>to a lot of</p><p>um videos of yours and then I started</p><p>taking</p><p>um some supplements from you and I&rsquo;m</p><p>following the keto and I&rsquo;m doing the um</p><p>fasting as well not every day but four</p><p>to five days a week</p><p>but since last month I</p><p>uh having</p><p>um uh a right shoulder pain every</p><p>morning but I changed everything like</p><p>mattress and the pillows it won&rsquo;t go</p><p>away I just want to find out some about</p><p>the alpha one and two percent deficiency</p><p>thank you yeah I think um</p><p>there&rsquo;s definitely some um some some</p><p>problems in the liver with uh with fats</p><p>and so you probably are going to benefit</p><p>from</p><p>choline choline in the diet on a regular</p><p>basis which is going to help</p><p>help you with the with kind of those</p><p>little ducks drainage their little tubes</p><p>from your liver to your gallbladder and</p><p>so drain that out a bit and then you&rsquo;ll</p><p>probably benefit from some bile salts as</p><p>well</p><p>that will help and um and then see what</p><p>happens because that just might be</p><p>enough to get rid of that shoulder pain</p><p>but the shoulder plane is a an indicator</p><p>that the you still have a problem in</p><p>that area so</p><p>I had that for 12 years</p><p>um but another thing you can take just</p><p>if you really wanted to go that one step</p><p>further is a an additional type of bile</p><p>salt called Tut cut</p><p>and you take that between meals so you</p><p>take the bile salts with meals after the</p><p>meal and then tatka</p><p>um in between the meals like maybe two</p><p>and then two two in the morning two in</p><p>the afternoon and then see if that</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t open up that duct</p><p>and then what will happen is um</p><p>watch my videos on the gallbladder</p><p>flushing it&rsquo;s a manual</p><p>kind of a visceral massage that you can</p><p>massage that area that that will also</p><p>help as well but uh that&rsquo;s that those</p><p>are some tips that I would recommend</p><p>I&rsquo;m taking the gallbladder formula about</p><p>two days good is it good okay that&rsquo;s</p><p>good yeah you&rsquo;re on the right track</p><p>um and uh let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see if these</p><p>additional recommendations uh resolve</p><p>that and um</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s really the liver is all about</p><p>digesting fats so we just need to tweak</p><p>that a little bit it sounds great we&rsquo;ll</p><p>get back with this shamali we hope that</p><p>is some great counsel and that you feel</p><p>better all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s uh</p><p>see if we have some answers here oh we</p><p>certainly do okay so quiz question</p><p>number three uh the audience did not</p><p>ignore and it asked true false it takes</p><p>CO2 to allow oxygen into your cells and</p><p>82 percent of our respondents say it&rsquo;s</p><p>true 18 say no it&rsquo;s false</p><p>it&rsquo;s a true statement and this is why</p><p>when you&rsquo;re hyperventilating you can&rsquo;t</p><p>get oxygen</p><p>and this is why they you want to breathe</p><p>the paper back and all of a sudden you</p><p>can breathe better interesting so um</p><p>so</p><p>um</p><p>even high altitudes</p><p>there&rsquo;s a pressure involved there&rsquo;s more</p><p>pressure up there and initially you have</p><p>to adapt to it</p><p>but once you adapt to it they found that</p><p>people live in high altitudes live a</p><p>little longer than people that don&rsquo;t</p><p>because of um there&rsquo;s a</p><p>there&rsquo;s definitely uh you get more</p><p>oxygen even though there&rsquo;s less air you</p><p>get more oxygen deeper into the cells</p><p>due to the CO2</p><p>so</p><p>what does this mean it means that um</p><p>for stress from panic attacks for asthma</p><p>for exercise if you can start breathing</p><p>through your nose it seems like you&rsquo;re</p><p>restricting your air</p><p>but you&rsquo;re increasing your CO2 to get</p><p>more O2</p><p>so CO2 is not just a waste product it&rsquo;s</p><p>um something that&rsquo;s necessary to keep</p><p>the blood at the right pH uh that is</p><p>City level so the oxygen can go in this</p><p>is why if you had pure oxygen therapy uh</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of side effects from that</p><p>pure oxygen therapy to get more oxygen</p><p>you can&rsquo;t it won&rsquo;t work it goes in the</p><p>blood but it doesn&rsquo;t go in your cells</p><p>now this also relates to um cancer too</p><p>because</p><p>um what really happens deep inside the</p><p>the energy Factory of the cell which is</p><p>there&rsquo;s oxygen involved it becomes</p><p>hypoxic</p><p>and then that apparently triggers the</p><p>switch to go from a normal cell to an</p><p>abnormal cell</p><p>now</p><p>this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily relate to what</p><p>I just said but it&rsquo;s just an interesting</p><p>phenomenon that our our bodies need CO2</p><p>just as much as oxygen so when you slow</p><p>down your breath and you equalize the</p><p>inhalation with the exhalation</p><p>then you can you can breathe better so</p><p>especially if you&rsquo;re trying to go to</p><p>sleep at night or you&rsquo;re going through</p><p>stress the breathing is uh something you</p><p>can control</p><p>all right very good we lost uh Carolyn</p><p>but now she is back thank goodness uh</p><p>from New Jersey let me unmute you and if</p><p>you&rsquo;ll meet yourself Carolyn you&rsquo;re on</p><p>with Dr bird</p><p>well my cortisol level is so high</p><p>because I&rsquo;m freaking out trying to get</p><p>back online 10 minutes you made it</p><p>oh my God it&rsquo;s such a pleasure to meet</p><p>you I love you I love you</p><p>real quick 61 years old have Hashimoto I</p><p>have HPV</p><p>um I used to be diabetic I used to be</p><p>heavier anyway I&rsquo;m a year in 50 Town 52</p><p>pounds lost and</p><p>sometimes I wake up in the morning and</p><p>my my sugar is like 89 and that freaks</p><p>me out that&rsquo;s one thing in 30 seconds I</p><p>got three questions another thing is</p><p>um I love sunflower seeds I&rsquo;m on two</p><p>meals a day and I love to eat sunflower</p><p>seeds which is good for selenium I guess</p><p>right but anyway I went to get my blood</p><p>work done my cholesterol is real high</p><p>and my doctors don&rsquo;t want to hear about</p><p>keto they don&rsquo;t want to hear about a</p><p>large buoyant particles they could care</p><p>less they won&rsquo;t take me off my blood</p><p>pressure medication</p><p>um so I&rsquo;m a little freaked out because</p><p>the doctor said you know you&rsquo;re at high</p><p>risk for a stroke and heart disease and</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing everything I&rsquo;m doing</p><p>um Citrus Bergamot red yeast socinitrols</p><p>I go back in three months I exercise</p><p>more and I&rsquo;m trying not to eat cream</p><p>cheese and big cheeses</p><p>um anyway what do you think am I gonna</p><p>make it</p><p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna make it um the</p><p>first question the first question</p><p>um that you had okay about the blood</p><p>sugar being low yeah so so just realize</p><p>like you&rsquo;re concerned because that&rsquo;s low</p><p>because I was hypoglycemic and I get all</p><p>freaked out when it&rsquo;s under sometimes</p><p>it&rsquo;s 78 yeah so so you&rsquo;re probably not</p><p>eating a lot of sugar correct I don&rsquo;t</p><p>eat and I&rsquo;m clean keto and I said okay</p><p>so then the question is where is that</p><p>Sugar coming from it&rsquo;s not coming from</p><p>the diet right</p><p>tell me about my body it&rsquo;s coming from</p><p>my body yeah your body will make</p><p>whatever ever it needs if you don&rsquo;t eat</p><p>sugar so there&rsquo;s always going to be a</p><p>production it&rsquo;s called gluconeogenesis</p><p>but here&rsquo;s the thing you don&rsquo;t have to</p><p>worry about when you don&rsquo;t eat sugar the</p><p>blood sugar will come down sometimes</p><p>even</p><p>in the 60s</p><p>oh I shouldn&rsquo;t freak out if it&rsquo;s</p><p>understanding freak out because that&rsquo;s</p><p>your new normal okay</p><p>that&rsquo;s your new normal and no worries on</p><p>that and then the second question is</p><p>this Hashimoto&rsquo;s thing what you selenium</p><p>is a good good uh remedy for that</p><p>um but you said your cholesterol I</p><p>honestly I think the best thing to do to</p><p>reduce your stress is to find a keto</p><p>friendly or educated doctor because they</p><p>you need someone on your team that is up</p><p>on the research and they&rsquo;re not so</p><p>narrow-minded uh about this whole</p><p>cholesterol thing that it&rsquo;s brainwashed</p><p>everyone and unfortunately the more</p><p>educated someone is the more sometimes</p><p>educated in the wrong thing and they</p><p>can&rsquo;t even think anymore so</p><p>um you want a doctor with that can have</p><p>a new Viewpoint and to actually look at</p><p>a research and go wow let&rsquo;s try</p><p>something different</p><p>um I just want to tell you I also have</p><p>diabetic retinopathy and I have to get</p><p>injections in my eyes and that&rsquo;s getting</p><p>better but</p><p>after I go to the gynecologist for the</p><p>HPV the regular primary care and my eye</p><p>doctor</p><p>they don&rsquo;t want to hear that my</p><p>lifestyle is making everything better</p><p>they don&rsquo;t want to hear they don&rsquo;t</p><p>listen</p><p>yeah that&rsquo;s why you have to get it</p><p>that&rsquo;s it your job needs to be fined</p><p>some doctors that can really work with</p><p>you on this because</p><p>um you don&rsquo;t want to have those guys</p><p>stressing you out um the other thing is</p><p>um if you have enough</p><p>um</p><p>you know antioxidants like from Sprouts</p><p>in your salad those antioxidants are</p><p>gonna um</p><p>help the collateral damage from that&rsquo;s</p><p>happening in the eyes so with the retina</p><p>um and you know I used to be diabetic</p><p>but I reversed that and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p><p>awesome the</p><p>trace mineral that&rsquo;s</p><p>zinc is really concentrated on the</p><p>retina and so if you&rsquo;re deficient in</p><p>zinc you could even have night blindness</p><p>just just as much as Vitamin A so as</p><p>long as you&rsquo;re getting all the nutrition</p><p>and you&rsquo;re doing all the right things I</p><p>think your biggest stress is just from</p><p>doctors trying to push more drugs on you</p><p>so they won&rsquo;t take me off my meds I&rsquo;m on</p><p>blood pressure medication synthroid and</p><p>gout and I occasionally take</p><p>I&rsquo;m so freaked out by all this</p><p>proud of that but what about what about</p><p>finding a um a cardiologist who does</p><p>that supports keto there&rsquo;s a lot of them</p><p>and I&rsquo;m gonna have to look yeah look it</p><p>up it&rsquo;s just look online I I have some</p><p>friends that are cardiologists there</p><p>they&rsquo;re cut they&rsquo;re heart surgeons and</p><p>they basically</p><p>um will give you some really good advice</p><p>and you can work with them remotely</p><p>possibly or find someone in your area</p><p>but uh the point is that um</p><p>you know when you&rsquo;re getting Consulting</p><p>from someone in an area</p><p>um you want someone that is um competent</p><p>and that has all of the</p><p>I also mention your name to every doctor</p><p>I go to and they look at me like I have</p><p>five heads and I&rsquo;m like whatever you</p><p>know can I just tell you that my</p><p>triglycerides were only 109 and isn&rsquo;t</p><p>that a good marker right that&rsquo;s really</p><p>good that&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s really amazing</p><p>that&rsquo;s really good but they don&rsquo;t care</p><p>because the ratio is 4.0 and then</p><p>but you know I I got scared by those</p><p>High numbers</p><p>well it&rsquo;s kind of like it&rsquo;s kind of like</p><p>um</p><p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p><p>a carnivore you&rsquo;re on the carnivore diet</p><p>and you&rsquo;re going on going to a doctor</p><p>who&rsquo;s a vegan what are they going to</p><p>recommend are they going to ever support</p><p>your diet no so um</p><p>you got to choose your doctors wisely</p><p>well Carolyn thank you so much for</p><p>coming along with us we appreciate it we</p><p>would love to hear back from you</p><p>sunflower seeds are fine sunflower seeds</p><p>are fine you&rsquo;ll get a good amount of</p><p>vitamin B1 too so um I think you&rsquo;re good</p><p>on that that&rsquo;s great all right thank you</p><p>so much Carolyn we would love to hear</p><p>back from you and we appreciate it if</p><p>you you said all of the speakers were</p><p>going to give one question and so I know</p><p>but she&rsquo;s so funny though it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>matter it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s a lot of</p><p>questions people I know but she&rsquo;s yeah</p><p>we&rsquo;re so Charmed with her we&rsquo;re glad to</p><p>have had you on there but anyway get us</p><p>back and next time I want a description</p><p>in 30 seconds because it&rsquo;s all going to</p><p>be great news that&rsquo;s terrific all right</p><p>let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s move on to</p><p>um</p><p>the next question and Dr Burgess is not</p><p>a truth officer so you audience you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to dig in</p><p>all right so when is the worst time to</p><p>drink lemon water or lemon juice</p><p>All Right audience climb on that</p><p>let&rsquo;s see uh Jolene from YouTube my</p><p>doctor told me that too much vitamin D</p><p>can cause a fatty liver is that true</p><p>no that&rsquo;s not true no too much vitamin D</p><p>in in I I would probably</p><p>what just too much too much would be</p><p>like hundreds of thousands of values for</p><p>months and months and months</p><p>that would be maybe that could</p><p>potentially create one problem which is</p><p>hyper calciumia which could relate to</p><p>skin kidney stones but if you but it&rsquo;s</p><p>so so rare So Rare</p><p>um I mean look at the flip side what are</p><p>the dangers of not having that vitamin D</p><p>oh my goodness</p><p>viral infections that are have a high</p><p>risk of</p><p>creating a lot of negative effects uh</p><p>inflammation</p><p>um I mean there&rsquo;s so many bad things</p><p>that are connected with the vitamin D</p><p>deficiency so</p><p>so when you increase it uh you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p><p>concerned about a Toxic effect it&rsquo;s the</p><p>only only one it&rsquo;s not a fatty liver</p><p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s hypercalcemia</p><p>okay uh Jenna from YouTube why would</p><p>someone have high levels of B6 when they</p><p>are not supplementing it</p><p>well it&rsquo;s hidden in uh different</p><p>um</p><p>Foods</p><p>um</p><p>it&rsquo;s also because they put it as a</p><p>synthetic like um the kind that is uh</p><p>that can accumulate in different foods</p><p>like enriched enriched or fortified</p><p>Foods it&rsquo;s also in like the Fortified</p><p>nutritional yeast which I don&rsquo;t</p><p>recommend so so that&rsquo;s kind of where you</p><p>you can get it as well and even though</p><p>you&rsquo;re not taking a supplements and a</p><p>lot of protein powders too they put that</p><p>B6 that the way that um</p><p>um you handle that is to take a natural</p><p>B6</p><p>which is um it&rsquo;s called p5p</p><p>because the synthetic one and that one</p><p>kind of competes with each other so it</p><p>ends up creating a deficiency so you</p><p>could have like way too much synthetic</p><p>B6 and create a deficiency of B6 it&rsquo;s</p><p>weird</p><p>because you need the natural one</p><p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see here</p><p>um</p><p>oh uh Jeff has nail fungus poor guy can</p><p>you recommend any dietary changes to</p><p>address this</p><p>well you can use the topical um iodine</p><p>works good tea tree oil works good</p><p>um but this tells us that your um your</p><p>microbiome needs to be bolstered and</p><p>strengthened using Probiotic foods like</p><p>um</p><p>sauerkraut or kimchi kefir or something</p><p>like that but also garlic as a natural</p><p>antibiotic can help you and oregano oil</p><p>is also good</p><p>um</p><p>but yeah so there&rsquo;s definitely a and</p><p>then of course the yeast fungus</p><p>uh candida love carbs so it could mean</p><p>potentially that your carbs are just too</p><p>high</p><p>all right very good okay so is question</p><p>number four asks when is the worst time</p><p>to drink water or lemon juice and I</p><p>drink it at night so I hope that&rsquo;s not</p><p>bad uh the audience feels 75 say it&rsquo;s</p><p>evenings or before bedtime 20 say first</p><p>thing in the morning a complete opposite</p><p>five percent say before after brushing</p><p>your teeth doc I&rsquo;m dying to know</p><p>well the worst that I&rsquo;m taking is right</p><p>before you eat because</p><p>um lemon water or lime water</p><p>um it turns into an alkaline</p><p>substance so it can dilute some of the</p><p>acidity that you need to digest food so</p><p>you want to have your lemon water maybe</p><p>a half hour or earlier before you eat</p><p>or an hour after you eat just to help</p><p>your digestive system especially if</p><p>you&rsquo;re weak on the stomach acid</p><p>even though lemon juice is an acidic</p><p>like a citric acid</p><p>it all it actually turns alkaline after</p><p>it goes in your body</p><p>so that&rsquo;s just a</p><p>side now of course too you know</p><p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a really strong pH I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s like a two straight lemon juice is</p><p>like two that&rsquo;s like battery acid so</p><p>don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t want a mouth while</p><p>mouthwash with lemon juice wow you know</p><p>I do drink it at night to Stave off my</p><p>Hunger I might as well ask you this</p><p>there are some calories in lemon juice I</p><p>use one and a half lemons is that gonna</p><p>break my fast so to speak or no no but</p><p>if you just um maybe dilute it with</p><p>water and then you suck with the straw</p><p>oh no I do do it with water I make</p><p>lemonade so but yeah one and a half</p><p>lemon Perfect all right very good glad</p><p>to hear it okay let&rsquo;s see now why don&rsquo;t</p><p>we go back to I tell what let&rsquo;s knock</p><p>out our last participant fur are you</p><p>there in Toronto Cal Canada</p><p>here she comes for her can you hear us</p><p>oh there she&rsquo;s popping up but I can&rsquo;t</p><p>hear you for are you muted</p><p>unmute yourself dear</p><p>she&rsquo;s working on it</p><p>okay say something</p><p>no we can&rsquo;t hear you yet for you keep</p><p>working on that and we will we will get</p><p>back to you so stand by just a minute</p><p>nope still don&rsquo;t have it let&rsquo;s go back</p><p>to social media</p><p>um</p><p>okay uh rakid from YouTube what are your</p><p>thoughts about taking creatine like a</p><p>protein does that make sense</p><p>mm-hmm</p><p>I mean people take it to actually</p><p>support their muscular system uh for</p><p>sure if they&rsquo;re lifting weights and</p><p>exercising it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s helpful I&rsquo;m not</p><p>against it</p><p>um try it see if it helps you</p><p>um I&rsquo;m kind of neutral on that</p><p>um</p><p>if you get your amino acids or you you</p><p>get um</p><p>if you look at</p><p>all the things that can stimulate muscle</p><p>growth there&rsquo;s a lot of things that you</p><p>can take uh the question is um what&rsquo;s</p><p>going to create an effect I&rsquo;m like a</p><p>human guinea pig I will buy every</p><p>supplement I will try everything in my</p><p>body and I would say probably 95 of all</p><p>the things I get</p><p>I have like nothing no nothing no</p><p>response and also you know I also have a</p><p>group of people that are also helping me</p><p>with the testing and I&rsquo;ll say Hey try</p><p>this try this try this and</p><p>and kind of do my own little</p><p>um Intel and see if that works or not</p><p>but um</p><p>you know you can&rsquo;t always wait for the</p><p>studies the research to do a study on</p><p>something to determine if it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>work or not because who&rsquo;s going to fund</p><p>a study studies are expensive and so</p><p>unless someone&rsquo;s making money on it</p><p>they&rsquo;re not usually going to do a study</p><p>interesting well who can blame them all</p><p>right final question for the day</p><p>audience here you go</p><p>all right so what is the most common</p><p>nutritional deficiency behind vertigo</p><p>nasty that&rsquo;s a situation where and I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking about the type that you stand up</p><p>and you you&rsquo;re whirling you&rsquo;re spinning</p><p>that&rsquo;s nasty All Right audience leap on</p><p>that our final question for the day</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s see</p><p>okay SEMA Chopra from YouTube which</p><p>supplements do you absolutely recommend</p><p>is essential for good health is there</p><p>like a handful that you should always do</p><p>doc</p><p>well I think the most important is the</p><p>vitamin D because it&rsquo;s hard to get it</p><p>from the diet impossible unless you get</p><p>it from the Sun so vitamin D3 is really</p><p>important that&rsquo;s number one and then B1</p><p>is really important too for so many</p><p>different reasons</p><p>um and of course you know</p><p>um a third one is potassium those are</p><p>three but you can get that in</p><p>electrolyte type thing so</p><p>um those are the three like bare</p><p>essential ones that I think would be</p><p>really good but then you know you can</p><p>keep going too like zinc&rsquo;s important</p><p>with the trace minerals and</p><p>there&rsquo;s a new um</p><p>um remedy that I&rsquo;m really liking</p><p>um and I can&rsquo;t find hardly anything bad</p><p>about it it&rsquo;s that methylene blue and</p><p>what it can do for um kind of mopping up</p><p>some of the</p><p>the destructive things going on the cell</p><p>and uh it&rsquo;s really interesting what it</p><p>can do for</p><p>um your brain cells</p><p>and even cancer or even preventing</p><p>cancer</p><p>I will release the video on the</p><p>Simplicity of what it does but it&rsquo;s it</p><p>was the first drug ever created and but</p><p>of course it&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t patent it now</p><p>so you can get it anywhere but it&rsquo;s uh</p><p>has some fascinating effects from</p><p>something that&rsquo;s synthetic I&rsquo;m just like</p><p>impressed with what it can do and um</p><p>I will I&rsquo;ll let you watch the video to</p><p>get all the details but it&rsquo;s a</p><p>fascinating molecule that um will turn</p><p>your urine green okay give us give us</p><p>that lean again what was it that way</p><p>your spouse can detect Steve if uh if</p><p>you&rsquo;re making it into the toilet oh yes</p><p>absolutely and what was the name of that</p><p>um compounding blue all right well I&rsquo;ll</p><p>look it up okay uh Janice from YouTube</p><p>what&rsquo;s the best way to lower blood</p><p>pressure naturally my sister has tried a</p><p>variety of meds and none of them are</p><p>working help</p><p>the first thing is getting on the keto</p><p>because that softens the arteries versus</p><p>a higher carb which tends to especially</p><p>where fine carbs are gonna Harden</p><p>arteries</p><p>and then vitamin D is behind a lot of</p><p>problems with high blood pressure but</p><p>also a lack of potassium so potassium</p><p>will also soften a stiffened artery and</p><p>help with blood pressure</p><p>um so those are the three things that</p><p>are the low-hanging fruit that tend to</p><p>help the majority of people but there&rsquo;s</p><p>other things too which uh like magnesium</p><p>things like that but</p><p>um</p><p>I I have videos on all these things</p><p>okay here&rsquo;s an interesting moniker too</p><p>lit uh let&rsquo;s see it just jumped away</p><p>from me</p><p>um oh here we go I&rsquo;m having a lot of</p><p>sugar level functions while uh</p><p>fluctuations Excuse me while fasting is</p><p>this normal</p><p>when you when you um first do it it is</p><p>normal because you&rsquo;re adapting right and</p><p>if your carbs aren&rsquo;t low enough it&rsquo;ll</p><p>take you longer to adapt but an adapting</p><p>phase you&rsquo;re going to be kind of like</p><p>craving hungry and things like that but</p><p>after</p><p>three days like you should be the way</p><p>that you know that it&rsquo;s working is you</p><p>have no more appetite like wow I can go</p><p>longer without being hungry</p><p>a lot longer and yet you get rid of the</p><p>Cravings then it makes it really easy to</p><p>do</p><p>um but like even let me ask you Steve uh</p><p>when you started to do this intermittent</p><p>fasting</p><p>uh was it overnight or did it take you a</p><p>while to get to the point where your</p><p>your hunger goes away no it absolutely</p><p>goes away I have not eaten today and I</p><p>won&rsquo;t till about three or four o&rsquo;clock</p><p>first meal and it&rsquo;s a miracle a miracle</p><p>because I was addicted to it I thought</p><p>about food from the moment I woke up</p><p>before because I was started eating it</p><p>so it does take a while but even for</p><p>someone who is incredibly undisciplined</p><p>or passionate about you know getting</p><p>something to Jack them up I can tell you</p><p>that it&rsquo;s worth the wait I have</p><p>absolutely no notion to eat until my</p><p>first meal after that I&rsquo;ll admit once I</p><p>kick that off in the evening I have to</p><p>be a little thoughtful thus the lemonade</p><p>and you know stuff like that but it&rsquo;s so</p><p>worth it how long did it take you to get</p><p>your body to get rid of The Hunger well</p><p>I&rsquo;d say</p><p>maybe but the main thing for me is</p><p>psychological to the point where I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t even think about it it wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>something I have to Stave off was</p><p>probably a few months but before that it</p><p>got easier so yes the initial set of</p><p>absolute sugar craving goes her Cravings</p><p>go away rather quickly but for you to</p><p>completely be numb to it takes a while</p><p>and boy is that a blessing</p><p>so Steve so that so you have um the</p><p>actual bodies craving or hunger but then</p><p>you have</p><p>the memory of it right that&rsquo;s right so</p><p>the question is how long does it take to</p><p>get rid of a bad habit that&rsquo;s the big</p><p>question Steve well I guess you know nah</p><p>I&rsquo;m gonna say it takes so longer but you</p><p>know a few weeks but I&rsquo;m just telling</p><p>you just stick with it because it will</p><p>completely go away and it&rsquo;s the most</p><p>glorious uh blessing to not crave that</p><p>because I just I mean I&rsquo;m down a lot of</p><p>pounds because of that and I have to</p><p>admit audience I&rsquo;m not the best on the</p><p>keto necessarily although I&rsquo;ve cut my</p><p>carbs back but intermittent fasting is a</p><p>blast down comes the weight</p><p>wow</p><p>all right let&rsquo;s see if I got um</p><p>answers yet oh yes I know that&rsquo;s quiz</p><p>question number three come on Terry give</p><p>me some answers on that last question</p><p>all right in the meantime let&rsquo;s go back</p><p>oh by the way fur we&rsquo;re so upset that we</p><p>can&rsquo;t hear you try that once more you</p><p>know we want to get you on the air if</p><p>not I&rsquo;m going to ask them to look for</p><p>fur from Toronto next week I want you to</p><p>reapply and see if we can&rsquo;t get you on</p><p>there if we can&rsquo;t hear you this week</p><p>it&rsquo;s so awful because we&rsquo;re running out</p><p>of time now let&rsquo;s see</p><p>um</p><p>okay here&rsquo;s some more ringing in the</p><p>ears this ringing in the ears caused by</p><p>vitamin deficiency and could it lead to</p><p>memory loss I don&rsquo;t know where she where</p><p>that came from</p><p>um can</p><p>can vitamin deficiency lead the memory</p><p>loss is that what you&rsquo;re saying uh</p><p>yes and also ringing in the ears was the</p><p>first comment</p><p>well</p><p>um</p><p>the hippocampus which is basically um</p><p>the part of the brain that is involved</p><p>with the memory loss</p><p>um</p><p>is something that is um very susceptible</p><p>to a B1 deficiency</p><p>so B1 deficiency</p><p>and it is true that B1 deficiency can</p><p>also affect your hearing too and if I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if it can create ringing the</p><p>ears or not but it definitely affects</p><p>the ears</p><p>um but um the hippocampus needs B1</p><p>it also needs vitamin D and it needs</p><p>zinc</p><p>so those three things are really</p><p>important for your memory But realize</p><p>too that um</p><p>the ketogenic diet might just be the</p><p>answer that you&rsquo;re looking for because</p><p>it it puts in the basic thing that you</p><p>basic</p><p>um fuel that you need to resolve so many</p><p>additional problems so it&rsquo;s really hard</p><p>to answer</p><p>a specific symptom if I don&rsquo;t know your</p><p>history and things like that but I would</p><p>start with the ketogenic diet</p><p>and that way you won&rsquo;t create more</p><p>deficiencies</p><p>like the high carb diet does all right</p><p>very good so question number five is</p><p>what is the most common nutritional</p><p>deficiency behind vertigo and carry our</p><p>producer who never makes clerical error</p><p>is called an answer for number three so</p><p>Terry I forgive you but this is actually</p><p>for five and for vertigo fifty percent</p><p>of our respondents say it&rsquo;s vitamin B1</p><p>20 say it&rsquo;s B6 10 say it&rsquo;s B12 10 say</p><p>it&rsquo;s potassium and 10 say it&rsquo;s zinc</p><p>they&rsquo;re all over the place doc any</p><p>winners</p><p>no we don&rsquo;t have any winners in this one</p><p>it&rsquo;s vitamin D</p><p>when you&rsquo;re deficient in vitamin D</p><p>you&rsquo;ll tend to develop</p><p>calcium formations too because</p><p>um think about this vitamin D is all</p><p>about the absorption of calcium and if</p><p>you get this floating calcium that&rsquo;s in</p><p>your lymph in the inner ear and it&rsquo;s</p><p>kind of uh messing with the little hairs</p><p>that allow you to keep equilibrium</p><p>um which is actually very common</p><p>um the antidote to that is vitamin D</p><p>it&rsquo;ll help break it down of course I&rsquo;m</p><p>also going to recommend K2 with that</p><p>both of them but um</p><p>there&rsquo;s a high level of vitamin D</p><p>deficiency</p><p>um with people with vertigo</p><p>now there&rsquo;s other causes of vertigo to</p><p>but the calcium deposit is actually very</p><p>very common and I&rsquo;ll release a video on</p><p>that so you can there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a</p><p>procedure that you can do to see what</p><p>ears involved and then hopefully even to</p><p>dislodge it out of that inner Canal But</p><p>ultimately to dissolve it prevent it</p><p>from coming back the vitamin D is</p><p>something I would recommend and I have a</p><p>lot of references on this topic so that</p><p>way um</p><p>you can you can read those further too</p><p>to get that data oh my God audience a</p><p>hundred percent wrong how are you going</p><p>to get through the weekend with this</p><p>stain on your reputation we&rsquo;re going to</p><p>give you a chance next Friday to redeem</p><p>yourself you&rsquo;ve been so good but oh</p><p>nobody got vitamin D neither did I so</p><p>I&rsquo;m with the audience okay let&rsquo;s see uh</p><p>risi from YouTube I have Baker sis</p><p>on the main artery behind my knees and</p><p>I&rsquo;m told they can&rsquo;t be removed it&rsquo;s very</p><p>painful even to walk now please share</p><p>any advice uh you could to treat them</p><p>and she thanks you</p><p>in in practice</p><p>um every every single person coming with</p><p>a Baker cyst always had uh higher blood</p><p>glucose levels so um</p><p>and it could also be from like I had one</p><p>person and she said that I&rsquo;m on a low</p><p>carb diet and I come to find out she</p><p>drinks like a bottle of wine a night I</p><p>said</p><p>oh did you think that was low carb</p><p>um so</p><p>yes this I would get on keto and see if</p><p>that problem doesn&rsquo;t disappear but</p><p>apparently those Baker cysts are tend to</p><p>be associated with a higher blood</p><p>glucose level</p><p>okay very good let&rsquo;s wrap up with</p><p>something cool ladies Legacy gin I guess</p><p>that&rsquo;s a type of gin and that&rsquo;s what</p><p>this person is calling themselves Dr</p><p>Berg my husband and
