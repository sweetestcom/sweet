    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Nolan Williams.</p>
<p>Dr. Williams is a medical doctor</p>
<p>and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences</p>
<p>at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>His laboratory and clinic focus on depression</p>
<p>and other mood disorders.</p>
<p>They focus specifically on the use</p>
<p>of transcranial magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>which is a brain stimulation technique</p>
<p>that can either activate or quiet specific brain circuits,</p>
<p>as well as circuits within the body,</p>
<p>in order to treat depression and other mood disorders.</p>
<p>Other laboratories and clinics use TMS.</p>
<p>What sets apart the work of Nolan Williams and colleagues</p>
<p>is that they combine TMS with other treatments.</p>
<p>And some of those treatments are among the more cutting edge</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve probably heard about these days,</p>
<p>including ibogaine, psilocybin, MDMA, cannabis, DMT,</p>
<p>and other drugs that at this point in time</p>
<p>are experimental in terms of clinical trials,</p>
<p>but that at least the preliminary data show</p>
<p>hold great promise for the treatment of depression</p>
<p>and other mood disorders.</p>
<p>In the course of my discussion with Dr. Williams,</p>
<p>we covered things such as the history</p>
<p>of each of these drugs,</p>
<p>how they came to be and their current status</p>
<p>in terms of their clinical use and legality.</p>
<p>We also talk about their safety profiles,</p>
<p>both in children and in adults.</p>
<p>And we talk about what the future of psychedelic research</p>
<p>and clinical use really looks like.</p>
<p>For instance, we discuss how a number of laboratories</p>
<p>and clinics are modifying psychedelics</p>
<p>to remove some of their hallucinogenic properties</p>
<p>while maintaining some of their antidepressant</p>
<p>or antitrauma properties.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also learn about some fascinating research</p>
<p>in Dr. Williams&rsquo; laboratory focused on ketamine,</p>
<p>which is a drug that is increasingly being used</p>
<p>to treat depression.</p>
<p>And contrary to common belief,</p>
<p>the effects of ketamine in terms of relieving depression</p>
<p>may not actually arise from its dissociative effects.</p>
<p>One thing that you&rsquo;ll find extraordinary about Dr. Williams</p>
<p>is that not only does he have vast knowledge</p>
<p>of the various treatments for depression,</p>
<p>but that he and his laboratory</p>
<p>are really combining these treatments</p>
<p>in the most potent way.</p>
<p>That is combining psychedelic treatments</p>
<p>with brain machine interface</p>
<p>or combining brain machine interface</p>
<p>with particular learning protocols,</p>
<p>that is neuroplasticity protocols,</p>
<p>which can directly change the brain in specific ways.</p>
<p>So today you&rsquo;re going to learn a tremendous amount</p>
<p>about the neural circuitry underlying depression</p>
<p>as well as positive moods.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also learn about all the various drugs</p>
<p>that I described,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really going to learn about the current status</p>
<p>and future of the treatment of mood disorders.</p>
<p>Today, you&rsquo;ll also learn about a number of ongoing studies</p>
<p>in Dr. Williams&rsquo; laboratory.</p>
<p>I should mention that they are recruiting subjects</p>
<p>for these studies.</p>
<p>If you go to BSL,</p>
<p>which stands for Brain Stimulation Laboratory,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s bsl.stanford.edu,</p>
<p>you have the opportunity to apply</p>
<p>for one of these clinical trials</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders.</p>
<p>I confess that the conversation with Dr. Williams</p>
<p>was for me one of the more stimulating</p>
<p>and informative conversations I&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>about psychedelics,</p>
<p>which is simply to say that his breadth</p>
<p>and depth of knowledge on that topic is incredible,</p>
<p>and his breadth and depth of knowledge</p>
<p>in terms of the underlying brain science</p>
<p>and how it can all be combined with clinical applications</p>
<p>is also extraordinary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to come away</p>
<p>with a tremendous amount of knowledge</p>
<p>about the clinical and non-clinical uses</p>
<p>of those substances,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to understand a lot more</p>
<p>about how the healthy and diseased brain work.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>are critical to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>and we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes,</p>
<p>and while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe, based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this, and as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the Clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their Energy formula before training,</p>
<p>to get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partnered with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Nolan Williams.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to have this conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming,</p>
<p>and I have a lot of questions about different compounds,</p>
<p>psychedelics in particular.</p>
<p>But before we get into that discussion,</p>
<p>I want to ask you about depression, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>intractable depression, how common depression is or isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I heard you say in a wonderful talk that you gave</p>
<p>that depression is perhaps</p>
<p>the most debilitating condition worldwide.</p>
<p>And yet in contrast to other medical conditions like cancer,</p>
<p>we actually have a fairly limited number of tools</p>
<p>to approach depression.</p>
<p>And yet the number of tools and the potency</p>
<p>of those tools is growing.</p>
<p>So if you could educate us on depression,</p>
<p>I would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So depression is a condition that</p>
<p>it has a lot of manifestations.</p>
<p>So you can have kind of a depression</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s primarily loss of interest.</p>
<p>You can have folks who feel very anxious</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of overactive.</p>
<p>You can have people who don&rsquo;t have any anxiety at all,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very underactive,</p>
<p>and they have low motivation to do anything.</p>
<p>So you have this huge range of symptoms</p>
<p>that are in that umbrella of depression.</p>
<p>And some of our work is to actually work</p>
<p>with folks like Conor Liston and Cornell</p>
<p>and try to actually get biotypes based off of neuroimaging</p>
<p>to see if we can kind of parse out</p>
<p>the different depression kind of presentations</p>
<p>and see that clinically and also see that in the brain.</p>
<p>Depression is the most disabling condition worldwide.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about depression</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s both a risk factor for other illnesses</p>
<p>and it makes other medical</p>
<p>and psychiatric illnesses worse, right?</p>
<p>So recently the American Heart Association</p>
<p>added depression as the fourth major risk factor</p>
<p>for coronary artery disease, right?</p>
<p>So alongside the risk factors that we know,</p>
<p>hypertension, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia,</p>
<p>high cholesterol, and diabetes, high blood sugar.</p>
<p>Those three have been on the list for a long time</p>
<p>and depression ended up being added to the list</p>
<p>as the fourth one.</p>
<p>And really interesting, right?</p>
<p>So in addition to taking medications</p>
<p>to address those other three risk factors,</p>
<p>we really have to be thinking about</p>
<p>how do you treat folks with depression</p>
<p>to reduce their risk of having a heart attack in the future.</p>
<p>And some of that&rsquo;s being worked on now,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have a complete solution</p>
<p>to thinking about that at this time.</p>
<p>And then the other thing that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is once you have a heart attack in the individuals</p>
<p>that end up having a heart attack,</p>
<p>the risk of having depression after the heart attack</p>
<p>is higher than the normal population, right?</p>
<p>And so a lot of what we&rsquo;re doing in the lab actually</p>
<p>is measuring kind of brain-heart connections</p>
<p>and we can actually with transcranial magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>a form of brain stimulation,</p>
<p>we can actually decelerate the heart rate</p>
<p>and capture that heart rate deceleration</p>
<p>over the mood regulatory regions.</p>
<p>And so actually a direct probe of that connection.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And so, as you said a second ago,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very disabling condition, moderate depressions,</p>
<p>about as disabling as having a heart attack,</p>
<p>acutely having a heart attack.</p>
<p>Severe depressions as disabling</p>
<p>as having cancer without treatment</p>
<p>and dying from a cancer without treatment.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of underappreciated</p>
<p>just how disabling depression is in that way.</p>
<p>And I think important as stigma is consistently</p>
<p>kind of being reduced over the years for mental illness,</p>
<p>for mental illnesses,</p>
<p>then the idea that we can start really putting more funding</p>
<p>and putting more focus at the federal level,</p>
<p>private foundation level, whatever it is</p>
<p>at a given university to thinking about</p>
<p>developing treatments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been very interested in a very particular</p>
<p>clinical set of problems around the most severe</p>
<p>and the most high acuity settings</p>
<p>that folks with depression end up being in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in emergency settings</p>
<p>where they go into inpatient units.</p>
<p>And in the rest of medicine,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s talking about heart attacks,</p>
<p>if I start having chest pain right now</p>
<p>and you bring me to a primary care doctor&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have a certain number of tests</p>
<p>and treatments, right?</p>
<p>But very limited because it&rsquo;s an outpatient facility.</p>
<p>If you bring me to the emergency room after that,</p>
<p>there are more tests and more treatments.</p>
<p>If you put me in the ICU or in the cath lab</p>
<p>where they do invasive procedures to the heart,</p>
<p>there are more tests and more treatments.</p>
<p>In psychiatry, as we elevate the acuity of an individual,</p>
<p>you go from being just depressed to being depressed</p>
<p>and now thinking about ending your life,</p>
<p>the number of treatments actually go down on average.</p>
<p>I mean, in some scenarios they go up,</p>
<p>but on average they go down and there are no tests, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been very focused on that particular problem.</p>
<p>Somebody that maybe was doing fairly okay</p>
<p>with a pretty moderate depression</p>
<p>and their depression gets worse</p>
<p>and then they end up in an emergency setting</p>
<p>and the field really hasn&rsquo;t developed a way</p>
<p>of consistently being able to treat that problem</p>
<p>and folks end up getting the same standard</p>
<p>oral antidepressants that they&rsquo;ve been getting</p>
<p>from an outpatient and I came to this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m dual trained as a neurologist and psychiatrist,</p>
<p>went back and forth between neurology and psychiatry,</p>
<p>saw that in neurology we have all of these ways</p>
<p>of treating acute brain-based problems</p>
<p>and really wanted to emulate that in psychiatry</p>
<p>and find ways to develop and engineer</p>
<p>new brain-based solutions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there.</p>
<p>One thing that you said I&rsquo;d like to focus on a bit more</p>
<p>because I think we hear that the brain</p>
<p>and the heart are connected, but you described,</p>
<p>I believe a direct relationship between areas</p>
<p>of the brain associated with emotion and heart rate.</p>
<p>And that makes perfect logical sense to me,</p>
<p>but I think at the same time,</p>
<p>many people out there probably think of the relationship</p>
<p>between the heart and the mind as kind of woo</p>
<p>or kind of a soft biology,</p>
<p>but here you&rsquo;re talking about an actual physical connection</p>
<p>between what area of the brain is it?</p>
<p>The first place where the stimulation goes</p>
<p>is called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the sense of control,</p>
<p>kind of governor of the brain.</p>
<p>And then what we know is that when you use a magnet,</p>
<p>use kind of what we call Faraday&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>this idea of using a magnetic pulse</p>
<p>to induce an electrical current</p>
<p>in electrically conducting substances.</p>
<p>So in this case, brain tissue,</p>
<p>but not skull or scalp or any of that or hair.</p>
<p>You avoid all that, just the brain tissue.</p>
<p>Then you have a direct depolarization of cortical neurons,</p>
<p>you know, the surface of the brain&rsquo;s neurons</p>
<p>in this dorsolateral prefrontal.</p>
<p>And if you do that in the actual scanner, which we can do,</p>
<p>you can see that that distributes down</p>
<p>into the intercingulate and the insula and the amygdala.</p>
<p>And ultimately the tract goes</p>
<p>into something called the nucleus tractus solitarius</p>
<p>and ultimately into the vagus nerve and to the heart.</p>
<p>So the heart very consistently seems to be the end organ</p>
<p>of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>If you measure heart rate in standard ways</p>
<p>that cardiologists measure heart rate</p>
<p>and you stimulate over this left dorsolateral,</p>
<p>you get a deceleration of the heart rate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very time locked to the stimulation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a two second train of stimulation.</p>
<p>At one second you see the deceleration,</p>
<p>it goes down about 10 beats per minute</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;ll drift back up and there&rsquo;s a break</p>
<p>for eight seconds on the stimulation,</p>
<p>it drifts back up and the stimulation goes back in</p>
<p>and then the heart rate goes back down.</p>
<p>So you see the heart rate just do this,</p>
<p>10 beats per minute every train.</p>
<p>And so we know if you do that over visual cortex,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get that, or motor cortex,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get any of those findings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really specific to this kind of control region</p>
<p>of the brain.</p>
<p>So yeah, it seems to, it&rsquo;s our work,</p>
<p>other folks work, Martin Arons in Europe,</p>
<p>the Netherlands work showing the same connections.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s been replicated like four or five times.</p>
<p>So you mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Anytime I hear about lateralization of function,</p>
<p>I get particularly curious because obviously</p>
<p>we have two mirror symmetric sides of the brain.</p>
<p>There are rare exceptions to this,</p>
<p>like the pineal and things of that sort</p>
<p>that are only, there&rsquo;s only one pineal.</p>
<p>What is special about the left dorsolateral</p>
<p>prefrontal cortex?</p>
<p>Does this have anything to do with handedness,</p>
<p>right hand or left hand?</p>
<p>Because we know right hand and left handedness</p>
<p>has a lot to do with lateralization of function</p>
<p>for language, a topic for another time.</p>
<p>But why do you think that left dorsolateral</p>
<p>prefrontal cortex would be connected to the heart</p>
<p>in this way?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think, so left dorsolateral</p>
<p>is thought to be the side that when you excite it,</p>
<p>when you kind of do excitatory stimulation,</p>
<p>potentiating sort of stimulation</p>
<p>that you can reduce depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>And a guy by the name of Mike Fox at Harvard</p>
<p>has demonstrated that if you have strokes in the brain</p>
<p>that cause depression and you put them</p>
<p>on the human connectome, 100,000 patient map,</p>
<p>and you ask the question</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re all functionally connected to,</p>
<p>left dorsolateral.</p>
<p>If you take lesions that cause mania in individuals</p>
<p>and you put those all in the human connectome map</p>
<p>and ask what they&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>the one common area they&rsquo;re all connected to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the right dorsolateral.</p>
<p>And so there seems to be a hemispheric,</p>
<p>balancing of mood between these two brain regions.</p>
<p>And we know this from an experimental standpoint too,</p>
<p>because you can take individuals with depression</p>
<p>and you can excite the left or you can inhibit the right</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both antidepressant.</p>
<p>You can excite the right</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s anti-manic in some studies.</p>
<p>And so this idea that there is this hemispheric balancing</p>
<p>of mood is quite interesting, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>And just so people know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re curious what the connectome is,</p>
<p>connectome is a term that was built out</p>
<p>of this notion of genomes</p>
<p>being large collections of sequencing and mapping of genes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re proteomes of proteins,</p>
<p>of connectomes as so-called connectomics</p>
<p>of connections between neurons.</p>
<p>So the human connectome project is ongoing.</p>
<p>And I find that incredible</p>
<p>that within the connectome project</p>
<p>they can identify these regularities</p>
<p>of right versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>especially since I&rsquo;ve looked at a fair number</p>
<p>of brains from humans,</p>
<p>certainly not as many as you have.</p>
<p>And if you look at the architecture,</p>
<p>the layers, the cell types,</p>
<p>and even the neurochemicals of which cells are expressing,</p>
<p>say dopamine or serotonin,</p>
<p>or receiving input from areas</p>
<p>that make dopamine or serotonin,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t look that different on the right and left side.</p>
<p>And yet here we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>a kind of an accelerator and a brake, if you will,</p>
<p>on depression and mania,</p>
<p>using what, at least by my eye</p>
<p>and I think other people&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>look to be basically the same set of bits,</p>
<p>the same parts list, more or less.</p>
<p>So what gives these properties</p>
<p>to the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex?</p>
<p>Is it the inputs they receive?</p>
<p>Is this something that we learn during development?</p>
<p>Or do you think that we come into the world</p>
<p>with these hemispheric biases?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t been worked out,</p>
<p>which your original question was,</p>
<p>in a left-handed individual,</p>
<p>which as you know, 25% of those folks</p>
<p>end up having a right brain dominance,</p>
<p>or 1% of right-handed people have a right brain dominance</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s flipped, right?</p>
<p>And that, unfortunately,</p>
<p>that study still hasn&rsquo;t been done at the level</p>
<p>because that would be probably pretty helpful</p>
<p>for teasing some of this out.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still being sorted out, right?</p>
<p>We know enough to know this phenomenon exists</p>
<p>because we can use TMS as a probe</p>
<p>and do this sort of, these sorts of manipulations.</p>
<p>But to my knowledge, there hasn&rsquo;t been anybody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotten so interested in it</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been able to get a mechanism of why that is.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of empirically true</p>
<p>in the sense that you can push and pull on those systems,</p>
<p>or in the case of strokes that folks have,</p>
<p>and then you kind of get their brains</p>
<p>and their brain images</p>
<p>and look at where the strokes landed,</p>
<p>those kind of causal bits of information</p>
<p>point to this asymmetry.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, going with what we do know,</p>
<p>that stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>slows the heart rate down transiently,</p>
<p>but it slows it down,</p>
<p>and seems to alleviate at least some symptoms of depression</p>
<p>leads me to the question of why would that be the case?</p>
<p>Is it, does it tell us anything fundamental about depression</p>
<p>that anxiety is inherent to depression?</p>
<p>I think a faster heart rate is, you know,</p>
<p>part and parcel with anxiety.</p>
<p>In my laboratory, we&rsquo;ve studied fear a bit</p>
<p>in animals and in humans,</p>
<p>and we often observe brachycardia,</p>
<p>where somebody or an animal is afraid of something,</p>
<p>and rather than the heart rate speeding up,</p>
<p>it actually slows down,</p>
<p>something that most people don&rsquo;t think about or recognize.</p>
<p>But given that stimulation</p>
<p>of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slows the heart rate down</p>
<p>and can alleviate depressive symptoms,</p>
<p>and that there are other ways to slow the heart down,</p>
<p>I have two questions.</p>
<p>What do you think this tells us</p>
<p>about the basic architecture of depression</p>
<p>and its physiology at the level of the heart?</p>
<p>And does the circuit run in the opposite direction too?</p>
<p>If one were to have or find other ways</p>
<p>to slow the heart rate down, say with a beta blocker,</p>
<p>does that help alleviate depression?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll answer the second question first.</p>
<p>So we know that in the ongoing trials of this,</p>
<p>if you stimulate in the vagus nerve</p>
<p>in an implanted vagus nerve stimulator,</p>
<p>you can actually, you know,</p>
<p>have the afferent parts of the vagus project</p>
<p>ultimately up to the DLPFC through the cingulate</p>
<p>through these anterior insulas,</p>
<p>so obviously the same tract, right?</p>
<p>And you can stimulate there and alleviate depression,</p>
<p>which seems very unusual, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stimulating a cranial nerve down in the neck,</p>
<p>but if you can get up into the brain,</p>
<p>you actually can improve depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>And so, you know, more evidence</p>
<p>that this is kind of a whole tract and system.</p>
<p>And if you stimulate in part of that system,</p>
<p>it appears that you can improve mood.</p>
<p>And what if I were somebody</p>
<p>who did not have a stimulating electrode in my vagus nerve,</p>
<p>and I was dealing with minor depression,</p>
<p>and I decided I wanted to take some other approach</p>
<p>to slow my heart rate down via the vagus,</p>
<p>for instance, exhale-emphasized breathing,</p>
<p>or deliberately slow cadence breathing,</p>
<p>things of that sort.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that behavioral interventions</p>
<p>of those kinds can alleviate depression</p>
<p>or some symptoms of depression?</p>
<p>And is there any evidence that it does indeed feed back</p>
<p>to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>to achieve some of that alleviation?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a number of studies implicating the dorsolateral</p>
<p>in, say, meditation, mindfulness, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re small studies,</p>
<p>but pretty well-designed studies</p>
<p>suggesting that behavioral interventions</p>
<p>in mild depression actually work quite well.</p>
<p>There seems to be a volitional threshold for depression</p>
<p>where at some point you start losing,</p>
<p>you go from being completely in total volition</p>
<p>to having kind of semi-volition.</p>
<p>You have thoughts that you really have a hard time</p>
<p>controlling and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And when you go through that threshold,</p>
<p>at some point it gets harder and harder</p>
<p>for those sorts of things to kind of kick in and work.</p>
<p>And the extreme form of that is catatonia,</p>
<p>where people in a very severe form of depression</p>
<p>get kind of stuck motorically,</p>
<p>and they obviously can&rsquo;t, they have no control,</p>
<p>and so, or very limited control.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a threshold</p>
<p>in which these sorts of interventions will work.</p>
<p>Exercise seems to really be a good treatment</p>
<p>for mild depression, and it may work</p>
<p>through the mechanism you&rsquo;re describing, right?</p>
<p>As we all know, athletes hold a lower resting heart rate</p>
<p>than folks that aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you were an athlete, you had a lower resting heart rate,</p>
<p>you stopped exercising, and a couple years later</p>
<p>your resting heart rate, in many cases, goes up, right?</p>
<p>And so maybe that&rsquo;s part of the process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any studies specifically</p>
<p>looking at dorsolateral prefrontal physiology</p>
<p>pre-post-exercise, but it would be a great study.</p>
<p>I think that would be really helpful to understanding this,</p>
<p>especially if you had a correlation of changes</p>
<p>and kind of lowering of, say, heart rate</p>
<p>with mood improvements.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of work with heart rate variability</p>
<p>and depression, and studies are, kind of point towards it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, not every study is positive for this,</p>
<p>but quite a few studies say, basically,</p>
<p>that lower heart rate variability is associated</p>
<p>with moderate to severe depression,</p>
<p>and that may be part of that mechanism</p>
<p>of that heart-brain risk.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m both intrigued and a little bit perplexed</p>
<p>by this relationship between heart rate and depression.</p>
<p>On the face of it, I would think of depression as depressed.</p>
<p>So lower heart rate might make somebody more depressed.</p>
<p>You even mentioned catatonia, or somebody that just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem motivated or excited to do anything.</p>
<p>I think of mania as elevated heart rate and being excited.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I realize that anxiety,</p>
<p>which brings about ideas as elevated heart rate,</p>
<p>is also built into depression,</p>
<p>which brings me back to what you said earlier,</p>
<p>which is that when we say depression,</p>
<p>are we really talking about four or five different</p>
<p>disorders, for lack of a better word?</p>
<p>And for what percentage of people that have depression,</p>
<p>does some approach to reducing heart rate work?</p>
<p>Whether or not it&rsquo;s stimulation</p>
<p>of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>or by taking a beta blocker, or by stimulating the vagus.</p>
<p>Can we throw out a number, a rough number?</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>
<p>30%, 50%, how long-lasting is that relief?</p>
<p>Yeah, and to be clear, the deceleration of the heart rate</p>
<p>is in the moment when the stimulation is happening,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s necessarily</p>
<p>maintained chronically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of an indicator that you&rsquo;re in the right network,</p>
<p>more than it appears to be itself central to the mechanism.</p>
<p>The heart rate variability piece may be,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some studies that link the two,</p>
<p>but the actual deceleration seems to be</p>
<p>much more of a marker that you&rsquo;re in the right system.</p>
<p>But it very well could be that the heart rate system</p>
<p>and the mood system just sit next to each other,</p>
<p>and the stimulation hits both.</p>
<p>If you look at how much of the variance in the mood</p>
<p>is explained by the heart rate deceleration,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a huge amount, right?</p>
<p>So it only explains a small percentage.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s unlikely that simply reducing the heart rate,</p>
<p>and in fact, for many years, propranolol</p>
<p>and these sorts of drugs actually were implicating</p>
<p>causing depression, and so that&rsquo;s been kind of debunked,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s unlikely that simply decelerating the heart rate</p>
<p>is gonna improve depression.</p>
<p>But what it does tell you is that if you&rsquo;re in that area</p>
<p>that is the mood regulatory area,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some parasympathetic cortical kind of process</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on that gets in and causes this to happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s independent of mood.</p>
<p>You can take a normal, healthy individual,</p>
<p>and you can do this,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna decelerate their heart rate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad you mentioned</p>
<p>the parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>which, of course, most people think of</p>
<p>as the rest and digest or the kind of calming side</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m hearing you say all of this,</p>
<p>and in particular, what you just told me,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s not as if having a lower heart rate</p>
<p>protects you against depression,</p>
<p>or a higher heart rate is associated with depression,</p>
<p>although at the extremes, that might be true,</p>
<p>but rather it&rsquo;s something about the regulatory network,</p>
<p>the ability to control your own nervous system</p>
<p>to some extent.</p>
<p>And when I think about the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>I like to think about it as a seesaw</p>
<p>of alertness and calmness,</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re asleep, it&rsquo;s a lot of calmness,</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re panicking, it&rsquo;s a lot of alertness.</p>
<p>But that, and I don&rsquo;t think this has ever been defined,</p>
<p>and when I teach the medical students</p>
<p>at Stanford Neuroanatomy,</p>
<p>my wish is that someday I&rsquo;ll be able to explain</p>
<p>what the hinge in that process would be, right?</p>
<p>Not the ends of the seesaw.</p>
<p>We know what the sympathetic nervous system is</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s, to wake us up and make us panic</p>
<p>or make us feel nicely alert and calm.</p>
<p>We know what puts someone into sleep or a coma</p>
<p>or makes them feel relaxed.</p>
<p>But what shifts from one side of the seesaw to the other</p>
<p>and the tightness of that hinge</p>
<p>seems to be what you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>that depression is sort of a lack of control</p>
<p>over inner state so that when I&rsquo;m stressed,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get myself out of it.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m feeling completely collapsed with exhaustion,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get out of bed and get motivated</p>
<p>to do the very things that would help me</p>
<p>get out of depression, like a workout or social connection</p>
<p>or eat a quality meal, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>So this is perhaps the first time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever heard about a potential circuit</p>
<p>for the hinge as I&rsquo;m referring to it.</p>
<p>Does that make any sense at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, I just want to make sure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m framing this correctly in my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely, and in some studies,</p>
<p>if you do the same identical stimulation</p>
<p>on the right dorsolateral, you can get an acceleration.</p>
<p>Just kind of further confirming</p>
<p>this idea of lateralization, right?</p>
<p>That even, it appears that even the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>you know, cortical areas seem to be lateralized</p>
<p>in this way, and I, you know, it&rsquo;s less,</p>
<p>the right finding is more variable</p>
<p>depending upon the study.</p>
<p>The left&rsquo;s very consistent in this way, so.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about transcranial magnetic stimulation</p>
<p>for getting into these networks.</p>
<p>And I also just want to take a brief tangent and say,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve heard you say this before,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so vital what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really not about stimulation of areas,</p>
<p>or any specific brain area or vagus nerve</p>
<p>being important per se.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about a network, a connection,</p>
<p>a series of connections.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really important for people to understand,</p>
<p>and is kind of a new emerging theme, really.</p>
<p>The other thing that, to me,</p>
<p>seems extremely important for us to consider</p>
<p>is what are these lateral prefrontal cortices doing?</p>
<p>Are they involved, for instance, in sensation,</p>
<p>sensing the heart rate?</p>
<p>Are they involved in thinking and planning?</p>
<p>And this gets down to a very simple question</p>
<p>that I know a lot of people have,</p>
<p>which is, can we talk ourselves out of depression</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s mild?</p>
<p>Can we talk ourselves into a manic state,</p>
<p>or an excited state, a positively excited state</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t qualify as mania?</p>
<p>You know, other areas of the brain,</p>
<p>I think is responsible for perception,</p>
<p>or for motor control.</p>
<p>But here we are in this mysterious frontal cortex area,</p>
<p>which people say executive function, planning, et cetera.</p>
<p>Are we talking about thoughts?</p>
<p>Are we talking about structured thoughts?</p>
<p>Are we talking about dreamlike thoughts?</p>
<p>What in the world is going on in the prefrontal cortex?</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;ve spent my career in neuroscience,</p>
<p>and I still can&rsquo;t really understand what it&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s doing 50 things.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So one of the studies that we&rsquo;ve been working on,</p>
<p>in addition to the depression work,</p>
<p>is actually trying to change trait hypnotizability.</p>
<p>So David Spiegel and I have been working on this,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s found, and published this 10 years ago,</p>
<p>that a different part of the left dorsolateral</p>
<p>is functionally connected</p>
<p>with the dorsal anterior cingulate,</p>
<p>with a lot of functional connectivity in high hypnotizables,</p>
<p>and not much in low hypnotizables.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a different, kind of a different sub-region</p>
<p>within this bigger brain region</p>
<p>we call left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>than the part that seems to be important</p>
<p>for regulating mood.</p>
<p>And so the left dorsolateral seems to have connections</p>
<p>that are location-specific</p>
<p>within the overall kind of named brain region</p>
<p>that connect to various parts of the cingulate</p>
<p>and seem to regulate it, right?</p>
<p>And so if you knock out</p>
<p>the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>and you have people do the Stroop task, for instance,</p>
<p>which is a task where you have, it&rsquo;s a simple task,</p>
<p>probably know this,</p>
<p>you have people name the color of words.</p>
<p>And so if I look at one of the cards that they&rsquo;ll show you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll have the word red in red, and that&rsquo;s very easy,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called a congruent.</p>
<p>And then the incongruent is red in the color blue,</p>
<p>and you have to name, you have to say the word,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t name the color.</p>
<p>So you have to suppress a response.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;m sorry, you name the color</p>
<p>and you see the word written in a different way.</p>
<p>And so basically, if you stimulate in a way</p>
<p>that inhibits the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>or either one, you can actually knock out</p>
<p>the ability to do that well,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll take longer for people in the incongruent cards</p>
<p>to be able to name it.</p>
<p>And so they have a kind of a time delay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s greater than they had before they got stimulated.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a part of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than the part of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in mood regulation.</p>
<p>The nice thing about TMS is that you can go through</p>
<p>and you can find these areas that are functionally defined</p>
<p>through brain imaging, and you can perturb them</p>
<p>and answer the question you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>How do I understand this part of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>and its function, this part?</p>
<p>And so we were able to stimulate in an inhibitory way</p>
<p>within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved with this sort of cognitive control area,</p>
<p>and we were able to knock that area out</p>
<p>and increase trait hypnotizability.</p>
<p>So people had greater hypnotizability</p>
<p>after they got active stimulation</p>
<p>versus when they got sham.</p>
<p>And so it suggests that that brain circuit</p>
<p>is involved in the process</p>
<p>of what therapeutic hypnosis ends up being,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very different region</p>
<p>within the left dorsolateral than say we do</p>
<p>when we do these very intensive stimulation approaches</p>
<p>to treat severe depression,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re able to get people out of depression</p>
<p>with the part of the dorsolateral</p>
<p>that seems to be lower in the kind of more lateral</p>
<p>and inferior on the DLPFC</p>
<p>and connected with the subgenual anterior cingulate,</p>
<p>so the part of the anterior cingulate</p>
<p>that processes emotion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Based on what you told us about the Stroop Task</p>
<p>and the role of the prefrontal cortex in the Stroop Task,</p>
<p>to me, the Stroop Task is a rule-switching game.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying in one moment,</p>
<p>the rule is you read whatever the word says,</p>
<p>and then you switch, and then you say,</p>
<p>the rule now is you tell me what color</p>
<p>the word is written in,</p>
<p>and you suppress whatever it is the word says.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Okay, a rule, in some sense, like that,</p>
<p>is a transiently adopted belief system.</p>
<p>So I could imagine that in depression,</p>
<p>which has all sorts of backstory to it,</p>
<p>that of course the psychiatrist or psychologist</p>
<p>or friend can pull on that thread.</p>
<p>Like for instance, somebody might believe that they are bad,</p>
<p>or that they don&rsquo;t deserve love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to bring this into the typical language</p>
<p>that people talk about, or that they will never succeed,</p>
<p>or that even if they keep succeeding,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just going to get harder and harder,</p>
<p>and it will never feel good.</p>
<p>These are sort of rules like the Stroop Task.</p>
<p>At some level, there are rules that are more pervasive</p>
<p>over time, unfortunately.</p>
<p>But I could imagine that if the PFC</p>
<p>is also contains some sort of maps or algorithms</p>
<p>related to rules of emotionality or self-representation,</p>
<p>or things that we&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>I think there must be data out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s saying that whatever we heard in middle school,</p>
<p>when someone made fun of us, we can remember that.</p>
<p>Because I can remember things that people said</p>
<p>about a jacket I wore one day</p>
<p>or something in the fourth grade, like crazy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even like the jacket.</p>
<p>Now I think it was kind of cool.</p>
<p>But anyway, the point being that we have an intense memory</p>
<p>for these things that set up a sort of rule or a question,</p>
<p>like maybe I don&rsquo;t really know how to dress, for instance.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why I always wear the same black shirt.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness,</p>
<p>it seems like the dorsal out prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is in this amazing position to access rules,</p>
<p>which are beliefs and beliefs are rules.</p>
<p>And then for moments or longer to switch those rules.</p>
<p>And so for somebody who&rsquo;s depressed</p>
<p>to just simply look themselves in the mirror and say,</p>
<p>you are great, you are fantastic.</p>
<p>It feels like a lie if you feel like garbage to say that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t fit with the rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying that card is not red.</p>
<p>That card is green when your eyes tell you that it&rsquo;s red.</p>
<p>And it seems like there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about prefrontal cortex that in principle</p>
<p>gives flexibility to rules</p>
<p>based on what we know about this group task.</p>
<p>So given its connectivity,</p>
<p>can we assume that the talk therapy that occurs</p>
<p>in the psychiatrist&rsquo;s office or with a friend</p>
<p>or through journaling out something,</p>
<p>because we do know that reporting things about trauma</p>
<p>or difficult circumstances or the rules that we contain</p>
<p>and tend to hide inside of us</p>
<p>about how we feel miserable about ourselves</p>
<p>or anything really,</p>
<p>that in re-scripting that,</p>
<p>that somehow it allows us to do a sort of stoop task</p>
<p>on our beliefs, is that a tremendous leap?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just really trying to frame this in the context</p>
<p>of what I and most people think of as depression.</p>
<p>Because the network components are vitally important,</p>
<p>but I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to figure out is like,</p>
<p>what are the algorithms that govern prefrontal cortex?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So in a kind of standard cognitive behavioral</p>
<p>therapy session, right?</p>
<p>What the therapist is trying to do</p>
<p>is identify those beliefs</p>
<p>and kind of determine how fixed they are,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re flexible, as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>and then help folks to find another explanation for them</p>
<p>and to kind of reintegrate that potential other explanation</p>
<p>into their memory system, right?</p>
<p>Where I think TMS is really interesting, actually,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had a lot of patients who&rsquo;ve told me,</p>
<p>like, my therapist told me that I wasn&rsquo;t trying hard enough</p>
<p>in therapy, and I really am trying hard,</p>
<p>but these are moderate, pretty severe depressed patients.</p>
<p>And as soon as we get them well with the TMS approaches,</p>
<p>you know, kind of rapid five-day approach,</p>
<p>and the next week we come in and see them,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say, you know what I did all weekend</p>
<p>is I looked at my therapy books</p>
<p>and now I can understand it.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I actually see TMS</p>
<p>as a way of having kind of exogenous</p>
<p>sorts of cognitive functions</p>
<p>that in milder forms of depression</p>
<p>we can pull off with psychotherapy.</p>
<p>You know, this idea of being able to kind of turn</p>
<p>that prefrontal cortex on</p>
<p>and have it govern these deeper regions.</p>
<p>In depression, the deeper regions</p>
<p>govern the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>They precede the prefrontal cortex timing-wise.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some data in review now</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re seeing that in depressed individuals</p>
<p>that are responsive to our rapid TMS approach,</p>
<p>we call Stanford Accelerated</p>
<p>Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy,</p>
<p>or S&amp;T, or SAINT,</p>
<p>if you look at the brain before people get this,</p>
<p>they will have a temporal delay</p>
<p>where the cingulate is in front of the DLPFC.</p>
<p>And in people that are normal, healthy controls,</p>
<p>no depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is temporally in front of the anterior cingulate.</p>
<p>With effective treatment,</p>
<p>we can flip the timing of things</p>
<p>so the dorsolateral is in front of the anterior cingulate</p>
<p>just like in a normal person.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>obviously physically moving these structures,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about in time, their activation.</p>
<p>So in one case, it&rsquo;s like the coach</p>
<p>telling the player what to do,</p>
<p>and in the other case, it&rsquo;s like the player</p>
<p>telling the coach what to do,</p>
<p>and you restore order to the game.</p>
<p>You restore order to the game.</p>
<p>And what it looks like is depression, to your point,</p>
<p>is a bunch of kind of spontaneous content</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s semi-volitional,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being kind of generated out of this</p>
<p>conflict detection system, the cingulate,</p>
<p>that seems to sense conflict</p>
<p>and kind of feed that information,</p>
<p>gets overactive in depression.</p>
<p>And then in depression,</p>
<p>it looks like the left dorsolateral</p>
<p>does not sufficiently clamp down on it.</p>
<p>And what therapy appears to do is to kind of restore that.</p>
<p>What we see with TMS over that region</p>
<p>is that we just exogenously do the same sort of thing.</p>
<p>We restore the governance of the left dorsolateral</p>
<p>over the cingulate area,</p>
<p>and that is correlated with treatment improvement.</p>
<p>So the degree in which you can re-time,</p>
<p>re-regulate in time,</p>
<p>the left dorsolateral over the cingulate,</p>
<p>the more of an antidepressant effect you have.</p>
<p>Can we therefore say in crude terms</p>
<p>that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>really is the governor of how we interpret</p>
<p>physiological signals and spontaneous thoughts?</p>
<p>It places a lens</p>
<p>that the rest of the brain sees things through.</p>
<p>And you can do these experiments</p>
<p>where you can put a normal, healthy control person</p>
<p>in the scanner and you can make them feel</p>
<p>like they have a loss of control,</p>
<p>and then you can see that region come offline.</p>
<p>So you can experimentally manipulate the system.</p>
<p>And so kind of buffing it up,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like almost,</p>
<p>TMS is almost like exercise for the brain, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of exercising this region over and over again</p>
<p>with a physiologically relevant signal</p>
<p>and kind of turning that system on.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>I think really interesting for this show is to,</p>
<p>you know, we had a couple of folks,</p>
<p>you know, probably five or six folks</p>
<p>that have actually told me this,</p>
<p>where if they remit early enough in the week,</p>
<p>we have this very dense stimulation approach</p>
<p>where we can stimulate people really rapidly</p>
<p>over a five-day block.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t discriminate when they get better</p>
<p>to when they stop.</p>
<p>So if they get better on day one,</p>
<p>we still give them the other four days</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in the protocol to do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting to a point where we can tell</p>
<p>how long it&rsquo;s going to take,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>And so, you know, every time somebody gets better</p>
<p>at day one or two,</p>
<p>at the beginning when we first started doing this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d say, you know, we&rsquo;re not sure,</p>
<p>you know, we think this is safe to keep going,</p>
<p>but you know, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>And everybody was like, no, I want to keep going.</p>
<p>And so, you know, by Wednesday,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like totally zero down on the depression scales,</p>
<p>you know, even better than most people walking around,</p>
<p>like really no anxiety, no depression or anything.</p>
<p>By Thursday, the first guy that told me this,</p>
<p>he came in and he said, you know,</p>
<p>I was driving back to my hotel</p>
<p>and I decided to go to the beach</p>
<p>and I just sat there and I was totally present</p>
<p>in the present moment for an hour.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I read about this in my mindfulness books,</p>
<p>but I experienced it last night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never experienced anything like this before.</p>
<p>And I was like, hmm, that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>but kind of wasn&rsquo;t sure.</p>
<p>And then I didn&rsquo;t tell any, you know,</p>
<p>obviously any more patients about that.</p>
<p>And then about five over the last couple of years</p>
<p>and they get, they were met early in the week.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, they&rsquo;re like going to the beach</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like totally having what people describe</p>
<p>as a pretty mindful present moment sort of experience,</p>
<p>which is really interesting, you know, what that is.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t have full on scientific data to tell you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s an interesting anecdote, right?</p>
<p>That folks, when you push them through this point</p>
<p>of feeling kind of clinically well,</p>
<p>that some people end up reporting</p>
<p>this additional set of features, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, you mentioned the cingulate</p>
<p>and the anterior cingulate in particular,</p>
<p>because now I feel like for the first time in my career,</p>
<p>I have some sense of what prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>might actually be doing besides providing a bumper</p>
<p>for the rest of the brain.</p>
<p>The cingulate, it seems, is a more primitive structure</p>
<p>in the sense that it&rsquo;s under the,</p>
<p>ideally it&rsquo;s under the regulation of this top-down control</p>
<p>from prefrontal cortex, but what&rsquo;s mapped in the cingulate?</p>
<p>And for the non-neuroscientists out there,</p>
<p>when I say mapped, if we were to put someone in a scanner</p>
<p>and focus in on cingulate or put an electrode in there,</p>
<p>what makes the neurons in there fire?</p>
<p>What sorts of things in the body and in the mind</p>
<p>and out in the world light up,</p>
<p>for lack of a better phrase, the cingulate?</p>
<p>What does the cingulate like?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so that strip task,</p>
<p>those incongruent word color associations,</p>
<p>the dorsal part of that,</p>
<p>for obsessive-compulsive disorder patients,</p>
<p>certain kind of triggers you&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Some of the neuroimaging studies</p>
<p>will point to anterior cingulate.</p>
<p>In the kind of very crude psychosurgery world 50 years ago,</p>
<p>the anterior cingulotomy was a way</p>
<p>of treating obsessive-compulsive disorder, right?</p>
<p>Because that area seems to be overactive</p>
<p>in people who are experiencing</p>
<p>obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>You can kind of walk, the cingulate wraps around</p>
<p>this white matter track, like bundles,</p>
<p>it wraps around that.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a part that&rsquo;s above that,</p>
<p>around that, and below that.</p>
<p>And depending upon how much of the conflict task</p>
<p>has an emotional component,</p>
<p>the more ventral and subgenual that activation is.</p>
<p>So the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate</p>
<p>seems to be kind of more of a pure cognitive,</p>
<p>maybe obsessive-compulsive disorder sort of area,</p>
<p>whereas when you start getting into mood sorts of triggers,</p>
<p>like facial expression conflicts,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re supposed to,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s an emotional strip task</p>
<p>where you show the word happy,</p>
<p>and then you have a face of a person that looks mad,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s another way of having</p>
<p>the same sort of stroop conflict.</p>
<p>That seems to be more perigenual, subgenual areas, right?</p>
<p>So you can kind of, you can trigger the cingulate</p>
<p>based off the level of emotional valence</p>
<p>from none down to a lot.</p>
<p>And that seems to be how it&rsquo;s distributed.</p>
<p>There are heart rate kind of components to it,</p>
<p>autonomic components in there too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something called aconetic mutism.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a board-certified neuropsychiatrist,</p>
<p>behavioral neurologist,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of these,</p>
<p>what we call zebra cases in neurology,</p>
<p>where people have these unusual neurological presentations,</p>
<p>and one of them is aconetic mutism.</p>
<p>So if you have a glioma</p>
<p>sitting in the inner hemispheric fissure</p>
<p>and kind of having pressure on the cingulate,</p>
<p>people can get into an almost catatonic-looking state</p>
<p>where they kind of get stuck and they don&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>And so that tells you something about how the cingulate works</p>
<p>as well, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if it&rsquo;s not functioning,</p>
<p>then people have a hard time kind of connecting with reality.</p>
<p>It seems to need to be constantly online</p>
<p>to be able to interact with the exterior world.</p>
<p>Is it involved in some of the dissociative states</p>
<p>that sometimes people who are very stressed</p>
<p>or depressed experience?</p>
<p>You said catatonia being an extreme one,</p>
<p>but I know someone, for instance,</p>
<p>that when they get really stressed</p>
<p>and it can even be if someone yells at them</p>
<p>or someone&rsquo;s angry, even if someone&rsquo;s angry with them</p>
<p>or they perceive someone&rsquo;s angry with them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a developmental backstory</p>
<p>to why they likely feel this way.</p>
<p>They sort of just kind of can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>this is a high, high-functioning individual normally,</p>
<p>and they just sort of can&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t complete simple things like email</p>
<p>or groceries or things for a short while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a catatonia,</p>
<p>and they refer to it as a dissociative state.</p>
<p>Do you see that in depression?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re speculating here</p>
<p>as to whether or not that involves a cingulate,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re saying holds a lot of salience for me</p>
<p>in thinking about this example.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So you see catatonia as an extreme outcome of depression</p>
<p>and sometimes of schizophrenia and other illnesses.</p>
<p>Dissociation is an extreme outcome,</p>
<p>or even in some cases, a less extreme outcome</p>
<p>of PTSD and trauma.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also a phenomenon that happens naturally</p>
<p>in some people that are highly hypnotizable.</p>
<p>And so if you ask David Spiegel,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d say that some of the work that he&rsquo;s been working on</p>
<p>is around posterior cingulate</p>
<p>and the capacity to dissociate.</p>
<p>But yeah, with our stimulation approach to DLPFC,</p>
<p>dorsal anterior cingulate,</p>
<p>one of the subscales that moved the most</p>
<p>was the dissociative subscale for hypnotizability.</p>
<p>So even in a normal individual,</p>
<p>you see that change in that kind of experience</p>
<p>of dissociation.</p>
<p>I am highly hypnotizable.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s hypnotized me a number of times.</p>
<p>In fact, we have a clip of that</p>
<p>on our Huberman Lab channel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always, well, always, starting in my early teens,</p>
<p>I started exploring hypnosis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely hypnotizable.</p>
<p>And self-hypnosis or assisted hypnosis.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I ever go into dissociative states.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and avoid forcing you</p>
<p>into running a clinical session right now,</p>
<p>but to assess anything like that.</p>
<p>But this brings about something really interesting,</p>
<p>I think, which is I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>that some of the more popular emerging treatments</p>
<p>for depression include things like ketamine,</p>
<p>which is a dissociative anesthetic, is that right?</p>
<p>And my assumption is that as a dissociative anesthetic,</p>
<p>that it leads to dissociative states</p>
<p>where people can sort of third-person themselves</p>
<p>and feel somewhat distanced from their emotions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been hearing that there are emerging treatments,</p>
<p>psilocybin being one of them,</p>
<p>but some other treatments, MDMA, et cetera,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll parse each of these in detail,</p>
<p>that lead to the exact opposite state</p>
<p>during the effect of the drug,</p>
<p>which is a highly engaged emotionality</p>
<p>and heart rate and sense of self,</p>
<p>and can also lead to relief of depression.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not this, again,</p>
<p>reflects that depression is many conditions</p>
<p>as opposed to just one,</p>
<p>or whether or not somehow tickling,</p>
<p>or in some cases pushing really hard</p>
<p>on the opposite ends of the scale really matter,</p>
<p>I am absolutely fascinated,</p>
<p>and again, also perplexed by this.</p>
<p>Why would it be that a drug</p>
<p>that induces dissociative states</p>
<p>and a drug taken separately</p>
<p>that induces hyper-associative states</p>
<p>would lead to relief of the same condition?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for ketamine,</p>
<p>the level of dissociation appears to be correlated</p>
<p>with the therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>It appears to be necessary,</p>
<p>but not sufficient to produce an antidepressant effect,</p>
<p>and so folks that don&rsquo;t have any psychological change</p>
<p>from the ketamine or don&rsquo;t experience any dissociation</p>
<p>typically tend to have less potent</p>
<p>antidepressant effects from ketamine.</p>
<p>We did a study a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>It was really interesting.</p>
<p>So we gave folks naltrexone,</p>
<p>which is an opiate antagonist,</p>
<p>a mu and kappa opiate receptor antagonist,</p>
<p>and we gave the same individuals a pill of that</p>
<p>or a pill of placebo,</p>
<p>and they had no idea which one they were getting.</p>
<p>Was this low-dose naltrexone?</p>
<p>50 milligrams, so it&rsquo;s a pretty high dose.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so we gave a typical ketamine therapeutic dose,</p>
<p>and then we gave 50 milligrams of naltrexone or placebo,</p>
<p>and then in the same individuals,</p>
<p>we gave two infusions,</p>
<p>one with each of those conditions,</p>
<p>and if they had an antidepressant effect,</p>
<p>we waited until they relapsed,</p>
<p>and then we gave them the other condition,</p>
<p>and then we looked to see</p>
<p>what effect of blocking the opioid receptor,</p>
<p>what effect would you see on the antidepressant effect</p>
<p>of blocking the opioid receptor,</p>
<p>with the idea that if ketamine works the way</p>
<p>that a lot of researchers at the time thought</p>
<p>that it completely worked in,</p>
<p>which is the glutamate system,</p>
<p>then you would have no effect of naltrexone,</p>
<p>because naltrexone just interacts with the opiate system.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do anything with any other systems.</p>
<p>Ketamine has a lot of effects over,</p>
<p>you know, it has clear opiate effects in mice</p>
<p>and various ways of looking at that,</p>
<p>and NMDA receptor antagonism and glutamate effects,</p>
<p>and so if it&rsquo;s just that the glutamate part</p>
<p>is the part driving the antidepressant effect,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have any difference</p>
<p>in the antidepressant effect between the two conditions.</p>
<p>If, however, the antidepressant effect is primarily,</p>
<p>the opioid properties of ketamine are necessary</p>
<p>for the antidepressant effect,</p>
<p>then you should have a loss of antidepressant effect</p>
<p>during the ketamine plus naltrexone condition</p>
<p>that you observed in the ketamine plus placebo condition,</p>
<p>and what we saw was that there was a dramatic blockade</p>
<p>of the antidepressant effect when naltrexone was present</p>
<p>in the people that had an antidepressant effect</p>
<p>with ketamine plus placebo alone,</p>
<p>and then some friends of mine did a TMS study with pain</p>
<p>and they stimulated over the left dorsolateral</p>
<p>prefrontal cortex and they gave IV naloxone,</p>
<p>which works basically the same way as naltrexone,</p>
<p>and they were able to block the anti-pain effects of TMS</p>
<p>with an opiate blocker, so this idea that,</p>
<p>another kind of convergent point, right,</p>
<p>this idea that the opioid receptor may have a role</p>
<p>in mood regulation, what&rsquo;s also interesting is</p>
<p>if you look at people that are getting</p>
<p>a total knee operation, a very painful operation, right,</p>
<p>total knee replacement, and you age, sex,</p>
<p>everything matched the individuals</p>
<p>that are going through that,</p>
<p>but you have a group of people that don&rsquo;t have depression</p>
<p>and a group of people that do have depression,</p>
<p>the presence of depression triples</p>
<p>the oral opioid dose by day four.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s required to cover the pain,</p>
<p>but what may be happening is it&rsquo;s not just treating</p>
<p>physical pain, it may be treating emotional pain as well,</p>
<p>right, at least transiently it seems to have</p>
<p>an antidepressant effect, chronically it seems</p>
<p>to have a very pro-depressant effect,</p>
<p>it can make people treatment resistant,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an interesting phenomenon,</p>
<p>but yeah, the opioid system seems to be pretty involved,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s interesting there with the ketamine trial</p>
<p>is that we didn&rsquo;t see any effect on the dissociation,</p>
<p>and so the dissociation was the same each time,</p>
<p>so the psychological effect of what we call the trip</p>
<p>or the kind of dissociative effect</p>
<p>where people are having a psychological phenomenon</p>
<p>from ketamine, that was identical both times,</p>
<p>and so it kind of, it also challenged this idea</p>
<p>that the psychological experience of the psychedelic effect</p>
<p>may be all that&rsquo;s necessary to produce an effect</p>
<p>and that the pharmacology doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>as long as you can achieve that state,</p>
<p>and so we think we pretty clearly debunked that idea</p>
<p>that the underlying pharmacology and the state</p>
<p>seem to be important.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know for sure if you can,</p>
<p>and a lot of people are working on this,</p>
<p>if you can take out essentially the psychological effect</p>
<p>and still have a drug that works to treat the illness</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to target,</p>
<p>and a lot of, there was a mouse study out this week</p>
<p>where they had an LSD analog,</p>
<p>and they were able to see some animal-level data</p>
<p>to suggest that could be true,</p>
<p>but until we figure that out in humans,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of to be determined,</p>
<p>but it is curious, right,</p>
<p>being able to kind of use experimental manipulations</p>
<p>to try to separate some of these phenomenon apart</p>
<p>and really understand what&rsquo;s doing what.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so critical, and it&rsquo;s so critical</p>
<p>to the other conversation that we&rsquo;ll surely get to,</p>
<p>which is the progression of psychedelics</p>
<p>from illicit illegal drugs to clinically validated</p>
<p>and presumably at some point either decriminalized</p>
<p>or legal drugs, which has not yet happened,</p>
<p>at least not in the US,</p>
<p>but just to make sure that people are getting this</p>
<p>and how crucial this is,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is the fact that if somebody takes a multigram dose</p>
<p>of psilocybin or somebody takes MDMA</p>
<p>or they take ketamine and they experience relief</p>
<p>from their trauma, their depression, their addiction,</p>
<p>or any number of the other things</p>
<p>that indeed those compounds have been shown to be useful for</p>
<p>in certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this gravitational pull to the idea that,</p>
<p>oh, it was the hallucinations,</p>
<p>it was the dissociative state,</p>
<p>it was the feeling of connectedness,</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re really saying is that</p>
<p>while that certainly could be true,</p>
<p>it may be the case that a major source</p>
<p>of the positive shift that occurs after the effect</p>
<p>of the drug is some underlying biology</p>
<p>like shifts in the mu opioid receptor,</p>
<p>a la your experiments with naltrexone,</p>
<p>or a change in the underlying neuromodulation</p>
<p>that had anywhere from nothing to something</p>
<p>to do with the real shift.</p>
<p>And I know there&rsquo;s a group up at UC Davis</p>
<p>that published a paper in Nature about a year ago,</p>
<p>also looking at, there&rsquo;s a chemistry lab,</p>
<p>essentially modifying psychedelics</p>
<p>to remove the hallucinogenic properties,</p>
<p>the mood-altering properties,</p>
<p>and actually seeing some pretty impressive effects</p>
<p>in shifts in mood after the drug wears off.</p>
<p>And I know this gets people upset when they hear it,</p>
<p>a lot of people, this gets a lot of people upset, really,</p>
<p>because people think,</p>
<p>oh, no, it&rsquo;s the intense experience that matters.</p>
<p>But in fact, that may not be the case at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s so powerful for people</p>
<p>that sometimes I liken it in my mind to,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like somebody,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the birth of a new child,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such an incredible experience,</p>
<p>and then people feel so much connection,</p>
<p>and then they sort of connect the experience</p>
<p>of the actual birth to the connection,</p>
<p>when in fact, that&rsquo;s true, it turns out,</p>
<p>but there are a bunch of other things happening too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s simply the reflection of the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re holding a child</p>
<p>and the pheromonal effects, et cetera.</p>
<p>So anyway, I think it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>that these different variables be figured out.</p>
<p>Along those lines, I want to make sure</p>
<p>that before we dive a bit deeper</p>
<p>into ketamine and psilocybin,</p>
<p>that we do touch on a really important topic</p>
<p>that has been in the press a lot lately,</p>
<p>which is SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t really have a discussion about depression</p>
<p>without talking about SSRIs.</p>
<p>And then I want to circle back to ketamine and psilocybin.</p>
<p>It seems that there are now data</p>
<p>that essentially state that there&rsquo;s no direct link</p>
<p>between serotonin levels and depression,</p>
<p>although my understanding is that the SSRIs</p>
<p>are powerfully effective for certain forms</p>
<p>of obsessive-compulsive disorder</p>
<p>and may also be effective for treatment of depression,</p>
<p>but it may, again, be, through some effect,</p>
<p>unrelated to serotonin itself.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>And how should we think about SSRIs?</p>
<p>Are they useful?</p>
<p>Are they not useful?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with SSRIs in your patients</p>
<p>and in other people as well?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that experiment that I described a bit ago</p>
<p>around the naltrexone and ketamine</p>
<p>is the first time I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>where we were able to essentially eliminate</p>
<p>an antidepressant&rsquo;s effect by using a second drug</p>
<p>as kind of a blockade.</p>
<p>And it highlights a bigger issue, right?</p>
<p>The issue that we haven&rsquo;t had a good way</p>
<p>of really understanding how these drugs work.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the controversy there</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s been difficult, I think,</p>
<p>for folks to see that something can, on one hand, work,</p>
<p>and on the other hand, we don&rsquo;t know how it works, right?</p>
<p>And so SSRIs clearly work.</p>
<p>Many, many meta-analyses kind of proving that out, right?</p>
<p>That in a subpopulation of individuals,</p>
<p>they achieve great benefit from depression,</p>
<p>for depression, for obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>for generalized anxiety disorder, panic,</p>
<p>all these things, you can see an improvement</p>
<p>in those symptoms with what we call SSRIs,</p>
<p>or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</p>
<p>The issue there is that these selective serotonin</p>
<p>reuptake inhibitors end up blocking</p>
<p>the reuptake of serotonin, leaving the serotonin</p>
<p>in this kind of in-between between two neurons for a while,</p>
<p>and allowing for more serotonin to kind of be there.</p>
<p>The issue is that they don&rsquo;t work immediately, right?</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t work like the same day you start taking them.</p>
<p>And that suggests that probably it&rsquo;s not exactly</p>
<p>the serotonin being in there that&rsquo;s directly driving it,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s much more likely that it may have some,</p>
<p>say, brain plasticity effects, right?</p>
<p>We know that things like brain-derived neurotrophic factor</p>
<p>get upregulated with chronic oral antidepressant use.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of the idea,</p>
<p>is that these things work, but what&rsquo;s powerful,</p>
<p>and I think what the authors of this paper,</p>
<p>it was an extremely controversial paper,</p>
<p>were in part trying to say was that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a deficit of serotonin.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not born with what people call a chemical imbalance.</p>
<p>And psychiatry has known this.</p>
<p>This is not actually new information to anybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a rehashing of a bunch of information</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve known for a while now, but in the lay press,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hit in a way that it didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to grab attention before with previous publications,</p>
<p>but this idea that this chemical imbalance idea is wrong.</p>
<p>I really think that part&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>because I think that for a while, I think psychiatry,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll call psychiatry 1.0, right,</p>
<p>this kind of idea of Freud and psychotherapy</p>
<p>and its origins, it was a lot around your family,</p>
<p>and those experiences, and psychotherapy</p>
<p>kind of going in and correcting,</p>
<p>or helping you to figure out,</p>
<p>or you being able to see, or people hear you</p>
<p>so that you can eventually come to the conclusion</p>
<p>of certain cognitions that aren&rsquo;t helping you, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge importance there,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a history where things</p>
<p>like the schizophrenogenic mother and all of that,</p>
<p>that was a concept at some point, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve transitioned from that</p>
<p>to the, for a long time, the chemical imbalance,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll call psychiatry 2.0,</p>
<p>this idea that there&rsquo;s something chemically missing,</p>
<p>and I think that the trouble there</p>
<p>for a patient who&rsquo;s not a physician,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not someone who&rsquo;s steeped in these sorts of ideas,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s more of kind of a person,</p>
<p>kind of average American out there, right,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s sending a message</p>
<p>of there&rsquo;s something missing with me,</p>
<p>whether it be my experiences I had no control over</p>
<p>when I was a child, or a chemical in my brain.</p>
<p>What I think&rsquo;s really powerful with TMS,</p>
<p>really powerful with TMS, and a level even powerful</p>
<p>with the psychedelic story,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s saying something different.</p>
<p>You know, TMS works, and there&rsquo;s no serotonin</p>
<p>coming in or out of the brain, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing a rapid form of TMS</p>
<p>that works in one to five days,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s very unlikely</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some long-term kind of upregulation</p>
<p>of serotonin that&rsquo;s driving that.</p>
<p>So our work actually kind of pushes back</p>
<p>on this serotonin hypothesis</p>
<p>as being kind of the center of depression,</p>
<p>because it says, look, we&rsquo;re not giving anybody</p>
<p>any serotonin, we&rsquo;re simply turning these brain regions on,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re focused on the circuitry,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s Psychiatry 3.0.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like neuromodulation.</p>
<p>Neuromodulation&rsquo;s a really nice use case for Psychiatry 3.0,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a way to focally and directly perturb</p>
<p>brain regions in whatever modality you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of groups</p>
<p>that are actually doing neuroimaging before and after,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re able to see circuit-level changes</p>
<p>for something like psilocybin or ketamine</p>
<p>long after the drug is gone,</p>
<p>suggesting in those same brain regions converge,</p>
<p>so the subgenual default mode network connection</p>
<p>that we see is changing</p>
<p>with our Stanford neuromodulation therapy technique.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that same set of brain regions</p>
<p>that ketamine and psilocybin seem to act on,</p>
<p>act on these connections between brain networks</p>
<p>that seem to shift,</p>
<p>and so it refocuses the story</p>
<p>on something that&rsquo;s highly correctable,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically electrophysiology,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically kind of recalibrating a circuit</p>
<p>that is recalibratable,</p>
<p>instead of I have something missing</p>
<p>or I have some set of experiences early in life</p>
<p>that are gonna forever trap me</p>
<p>in these psychiatric diagnoses,</p>
<p>and so it kind of challenges that idea,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so powerful</p>
<p>about Psychiatry 3.0,</p>
<p>this idea of focusing on the circuit</p>
<p>because it gets us into thinking about psychiatry</p>
<p>and psychiatric illnesses as something that are recoverable.</p>
<p>People can get better.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen with our TMS techniques,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen it with some of the psychedelic work</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve done where people are actually</p>
<p>in normal levels of mood for sustained periods of time.</p>
<p>Within five days.</p>
<p>Within five or less days,</p>
<p>and in the case of the psychedelics,</p>
<p>within a few days, right?</p>
<p>So we can get people out of these states.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re totally well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no drug in their system at that point.</p>
<p>In the case of psychedelics,</p>
<p>there was never a drug in their system</p>
<p>in the case of TMS,</p>
<p>and it just tells us that it&rsquo;s fixable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like an arrhythmia in the heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like these other illnesses</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like a broken leg.</p>
<p>We can go in and do something</p>
<p>and we can get somebody better,</p>
<p>then I think what&rsquo;s empowering</p>
<p>and what a lot of patients have told me</p>
<p>is they say,</p>
<p>some people will relapse and need more stimulation</p>
<p>or need more psychedelics or whatever it is,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll tell me I&rsquo;ve relapsed</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m depressed again,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll never think about killing myself again</p>
<p>because I know that if I go get stimulated again,</p>
<p>it improves.</p>
<p>It gets better.</p>
<p>I will be able to reach it</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t fear that I&rsquo;m chronically broken.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fear that the chemical imbalance</p>
<p>is still imbalanced.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fear that these things</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t control in my childhood</p>
<p>are gonna be there and drive this problem forever</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so powerful about this.</p>
<p>The sense of control.</p>
<p>The sense of control.</p>
<p>The sense of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not doing the stimulation themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not administering the drug</p>
<p>in these trials themselves.</p>
<p>They probably never will.</p>
<p>These will probably be medical treatments,</p>
<p>but they are choosing to do it</p>
<p>and in that sense,</p>
<p>they are in control.</p>
<p>I have a good friend.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t out him for reasons</p>
<p>that will become clear in a moment</p>
<p>who was quite obese</p>
<p>and lost a lot of weight</p>
<p>and was really proud of himself</p>
<p>and then I guess we could say</p>
<p>he sort of relapsed in a sense.</p>
<p>Not all the way,</p>
<p>but far along,</p>
<p>but his tone around it was very different.</p>
<p>He knew he had accomplished his goal once before.</p>
<p>He was disappointed in himself,</p>
<p>but he knew exactly why he had relapsed.</p>
<p>It was very clear.</p>
<p>He had essentially relapsed</p>
<p>to the previous set of eating behaviors</p>
<p>and lack of exercise behaviors</p>
<p>and has now brought himself back again.</p>
<p>And it just resonates with your story</p>
<p>that once somebody understands they can do it</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been there before.</p>
<p>This idea again of considering new rules.</p>
<p>And that brings me to this question about psychedelics</p>
<p>and the, frankly,</p>
<p>the altered thinking and perception</p>
<p>that occurs in high-dose psilocybin clinical sessions.</p>
<p>It seems that the disordered thinking,</p>
<p>even though it could be random, right?</p>
<p>Hearing colors and seeing sounds</p>
<p>is always the kind of cliche statement</p>
<p>of the Timothy Leary era.</p>
<p>Also, right there, that&rsquo;s a Stroop task of sorts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a synesthesia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combining of perceptions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of Stroop task-ish</p>
<p>in that it&rsquo;s a new set of rules for the same stuff, right?</p>
<p>And many people do report improvements</p>
<p>in trauma-related symptomology and depression,</p>
<p>as I understand it,</p>
<p>from my read of the clinical trials after taking psilocybin,</p>
<p>because during those sessions,</p>
<p>something comes to mind spontaneously.</p>
<p>As you and I were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>they will report, for instance,</p>
<p>a new way of seeing the old problem.</p>
<p>And the old problem could be the voice</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re no good, nothing will ever work out,</p>
<p>or it could be even more subtle than that.</p>
<p>So that raises two questions.</p>
<p>One is about the basic functioning of the human brain,</p>
<p>which is, why do you think the brain</p>
<p>would ever hold on to rules that don&rsquo;t serve us well?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one question.</p>
<p>And then the second question is,</p>
<p>what is it about psilocybin and related molecules</p>
<p>in terms of their neurochemistry,</p>
<p>in terms of the ways they disrupt thinking and feeling,</p>
<p>et cetera, during the session,</p>
<p>that allow this novel rule consideration phenomenon?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the first question,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an evolutionary neurobiology answer, right?</p>
<p>I think that at the individual person level,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make a whole lot of sense</p>
<p>that when we&rsquo;re really stressed out,</p>
<p>some of us want to eat more, right?</p>
<p>At the individual person level,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not particularly that good</p>
<p>for my health in the long term.</p>
<p>But if you think about it in some 500 years ago,</p>
<p>1,000 years ago, if I&rsquo;m highly stressed out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s most likely that I&rsquo;m about to not have food</p>
<p>at some point, and I should eat a bunch of food</p>
<p>that is high-fat, high-sugar, high-carb food</p>
<p>to put on weight for that next phase,</p>
<p>where in this stress, I may be in battle</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have food and I have enough fuel on board,</p>
<p>right, and so we end up being a result</p>
<p>of probably a lot of biology that&rsquo;s not that useful</p>
<p>in the modern era, and I think in the brain</p>
<p>for, let&rsquo;s say, PTSD, right?</p>
<p>A lot of veterans come back</p>
<p>and they experience these PTSD symptoms,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not at all useful back home, right?</p>
<p>They hear some loud noise and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re behind a car or they&rsquo;re behind a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of folks jump and run behind a trash can</p>
<p>or whatever in the middle of San Francisco</p>
<p>when they hear a loud noise,</p>
<p>but if you put them back in the battlefield,</p>
<p>you have that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s highly adaptive, right?</p>
<p>And so I think what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is that we, in the absence</p>
<p>of using substances like psychedelics,</p>
<p>we end up having these very persistent memories</p>
<p>that are attached to negatively valence to motion</p>
<p>predominantly, as you were saying earlier,</p>
<p>the jacket in elementary school,</p>
<p>we had various things like that for me, too, right?</p>
<p>You remember these things,</p>
<p>and we hold onto those things</p>
<p>from, I think, an evolutionary neurobiology standpoint,</p>
<p>but what seems to, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>kind of alleviate that are these substances,</p>
<p>some new, like MDMA,</p>
<p>some that have been around for thousands of years,</p>
<p>like psilocybin, and used in kind of sacramental,</p>
<p>and as a sacrament in traditions,</p>
<p>seem to have a therapeutic effect</p>
<p>that seems to be pretty long-lasting for these phenomenon,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s just curious, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s curious that in the absence of that,</p>
<p>these things will keep going on and on,</p>
<p>but in the presence of that exposure,</p>
<p>then all of a sudden you see a resolution of the problem,</p>
<p>and we have some work now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re treating folks with Navy SEALs,</p>
<p>and the data&rsquo;s still being analyzed,</p>
<p>but the anecdotes that we&rsquo;re getting, right,</p>
<p>are folks are coming back,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s finally gone, right?</p>
<p>These set of PTSD symptoms are finally gone,</p>
<p>and so this idea that, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>going into what&rsquo;s probably a highly plastic state,</p>
<p>like we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor,</p>
<p>in the case of ibogaine,</p>
<p>glial-derived neurotrophic factor,</p>
<p>this highly plastic state,</p>
<p>and the ability to kind of re-experience memories,</p>
<p>and then, as you know, we always re-consolidate a memory</p>
<p>when we bring it back up.</p>
<p>But re-consolidating it in that state,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, may drive a therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>And, you know, the jury&rsquo;s still out.</p>
<p>I would say that I&rsquo;m kind of agnostic</p>
<p>to what tool I&rsquo;m using kind of guy.</p>
<p>My business is to find treatments that help people,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m much more pragmatic about it.</p>
<p>If this sort of thing,</p>
<p>which has a lot of cultural baggage,</p>
<p>but if this sort of thing</p>
<p>ultimately ends up being therapeutic,</p>
<p>if we can design trials that convince me and others</p>
<p>that it is, then we should absolutely use it.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t, then we clearly shouldn&rsquo;t use it, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a big question</p>
<p>the field&rsquo;s gonna have to work out.</p>
<p>We have a hard time blinding these trials</p>
<p>because the placebo condition</p>
<p>is not easy to pull off, obviously.</p>
<p>A placebo for a psilocybin journey is hard to imagine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been thinking about this,</p>
<p>and maybe that ketamine study</p>
<p>that I was talking about earlier,</p>
<p>if we could give people naltrexone and ketamine,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s a good sort of placebo condition, right?</p>
<p>Because we know that we can block</p>
<p>any of the actual antidepressant effects of ketamine,</p>
<p>but they still have an experience, you know?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one way of doing it,</p>
<p>but thinking about ways to do that</p>
<p>and really kind of proving this out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been, yeah, I think that&rsquo;s been kind of central</p>
<p>to the way I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think there&rsquo;s the work that&rsquo;s been done so far,</p>
<p>the first psilocybin trial,</p>
<p>the first MDMA trial</p>
<p>that was published in Nature Medicine recently.</p>
<p>And what do those generally say?</p>
<p>I mean, that they are effective for a number of people</p>
<p>after one session, two sessions?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sort of the general contour?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with psilocybin and MDMA.</p>
<p>Yeah, so MDMA appears to, in one to a few MDMA sessions,</p>
<p>have an anti-PTSD effect that seems to be, you know,</p>
<p>outside of the kind of standard assumed levels</p>
<p>of PTSD improvement that you can observe in individuals</p>
<p>with this level of PTSD, right?</p>
<p>So what we call the effect size,</p>
<p>which is essentially like a measure,</p>
<p>a Cohen&rsquo;s d effect size is a measure</p>
<p>that allows for you to compare different treatments</p>
<p>to each other for different conditions</p>
<p>that are, you know, agnostic to what the actual illness is.</p>
<p>You know, the effect size is there,</p>
<p>you know, approach effect size is the things</p>
<p>that are pretty effective,</p>
<p>like antacids for heartburn, right?</p>
<p>And you see that with MDMA treatment.</p>
<p>So does that mean that for people that have trauma,</p>
<p>who do a, and again, we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in a clinical setting, they take one or two doses of MDMA,</p>
<p>I think the standard MAPS dose is 150 to 775 milligrams,</p>
<p>again, doing this with a physician, et cetera,</p>
<p>control clinical trial, legal.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>They do it once or twice.</p>
<p>And broadly speaking, what percentage of people</p>
<p>who had trauma report feeling significant relief</p>
<p>from their trauma afterward?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about two thirds of people</p>
<p>had a clinically significant change in their PTSD.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>Which is impressive, right?</p>
<p>And how long lasting was that?</p>
<p>I mean, these trials were ended pretty recently, so.</p>
<p>It appears to last for a while.</p>
<p>In the earlier trials where they followed people out,</p>
<p>it seemed to last for kind of in the year&rsquo;s range</p>
<p>for some people.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s pretty compelling.</p>
<p>Psilocybin, you know, in contrast that with ketamine,</p>
<p>which only on average lasts about a week and a half</p>
<p>for a single infusion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a much shorter.</p>
<p>So they have to get repeated infusions of ketamine</p>
<p>every 10 days or so?</p>
<p>Forever?</p>
<p>For some people, or they end up getting like a bunch of doses</p>
<p>for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>And then for some people that seems to last a while.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s where I think the psilocybin story</p>
<p>for depression and the MDMA story for PTSD</p>
<p>seem more interesting to me.</p>
<p>So for psilocybin, what is the rough percentages on,</p>
<p>and this would be relief not from trauma,</p>
<p>but from depression, correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you know, in open label studies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s closer to like half to two thirds of people</p>
<p>end up getting better depending upon their level</p>
<p>of treatment resistance.</p>
<p>In the blinded trials, it was more like a third or so</p>
<p>of people, you know, experienced relief.</p>
<p>And this is, you know, this is a press release of the data,</p>
<p>you know, and so it hasn&rsquo;t, to my knowledge,</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t been published yet.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing the full paper</p>
<p>on that one.</p>
<p>But it, you know, separated from placebo</p>
<p>and looks, you know, looks pretty good as well.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s, you know, the first of two trials</p>
<p>that need to be done to get this thing approved</p>
<p>for treatment resistant depression.</p>
<p>And so that stuff looks good.</p>
<p>In terms of MDMA, for many years,</p>
<p>it was reported in the popular press</p>
<p>and there was a paper published in Science</p>
<p>that MDMA was neurotoxic,</p>
<p>that it would kill serotonin neurons.</p>
<p>This was what was always said.</p>
<p>Then I saw another paper published in Science</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t a retraction of the previous paper,</p>
<p>but rather was a second paper in the same group</p>
<p>that essentially admitted that the first time around</p>
<p>they had injected these monkeys,</p>
<p>because with not MDMA, but with methamphetamine,</p>
<p>which is known to be neurotoxic.</p>
<p>So it was kind of a public admittance of oops,</p>
<p>or big, like really big screw up, so oops,</p>
<p>but never a retraction</p>
<p>and then never really a publicly acknowledged correction</p>
<p>in the popular press.</p>
<p>So it seems that in the appropriate dosage range</p>
<p>and with these one or two sessions,</p>
<p>my assumption, and this again is an assumption,</p>
<p>tell me if I&rsquo;m right or wrong here,</p>
<p>is that MDMA is not neurotoxic for serotonergic neurons</p>
<p>at appropriate doses</p>
<p>and with appropriate sourcing, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it was an interesting study that,</p>
<p>I think the guy&rsquo;s name is Halpern, last name&rsquo;s Halpern.</p>
<p>Not Casey Halpern.</p>
<p>Not Casey, different now.</p>
<p>I think Joshua Halpern,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blanking on his first name, but-</p>
<p>Casey Halpern was a guest on this podcast</p>
<p>and is a former colleague of ours at Stanford</p>
<p>who unfortunately we lost to University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>and maybe someday we&rsquo;ll bring him back.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So this individual received some NIH funding to actually,</p>
<p>NIDA, National Institute for Drug Abuse funding</p>
<p>to explore individuals of the Mormon faith in Utah</p>
<p>of the Mormon faith in Utah who partake in only MDMA.</p>
<p>So the way this works is that MDMA happened</p>
<p>kind of after a lot of the religious documents</p>
<p>were developed and so MDMA isn&rsquo;t on the prohibited drug list.</p>
<p>The banned substance list.</p>
<p>The banned substance list.</p>
<p>I have some good friends who are LDS.</p>
<p>Yeah, great people.</p>
<p>I do as well.</p>
<p>Just to kind of set of facts, you know?</p>
<p>And so these folks only use MDMA,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re not, you know,</p>
<p>the problem with some people using drugs</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re polysubstance users, right?</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s the MDMA</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;ve also taken other psychedelics</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve taken opiates and they&rsquo;ve taken cocaine</p>
<p>and you have this picture</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t really tease out that problem.</p>
<p>But with this, right, it was just individuals</p>
<p>that were part of the Mormon faith</p>
<p>and so they were kind of purists</p>
<p>in the sense they only used MDMA</p>
<p>and he confirmed all of that</p>
<p>and it was a brilliant study, right?</p>
<p>Because then he was able to go in</p>
<p>and look at their cognitive profiles</p>
<p>versus individuals of the same geography,</p>
<p>the same faith, all of that,</p>
<p>that happened to not take MDMA</p>
<p>and found there were no neurocognitive differences.</p>
<p>So does that mean that it was not damaging?</p>
<p>It was not damaging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know because to really do this study well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to track these folks down</p>
<p>before they ever took MDMA</p>
<p>and do a pre-post and compare to people that didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but you know, this is about as good of a study</p>
<p>as you can do given the situation</p>
<p>to be able to check this out.</p>
<p>Additionally, when I was back in Charleston</p>
<p>and working at the Medical University of South Carolina,</p>
<p>one of my mentors there, Dr. Wagner,</p>
<p>was a neuropsychologist at MUSC</p>
<p>and he was also the neuropsychologist</p>
<p>for the early MDMA trials</p>
<p>and so he did all the neurocognitive batteries</p>
<p>for individuals pre-post</p>
<p>and similarly did not see any changes</p>
<p>in neurocognitive profiles in a negative way</p>
<p>and so, you know, there&rsquo;s data</p>
<p>from experimental patients receiving this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s data from people that are chronic users,</p>
<p>who only take MDMA</p>
<p>and that combination of data suggests</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s certainly no apparent risk</p>
<p>in the kind of one to two to three dose range.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably unlikely that at least, you know,</p>
<p>modest dose exposure over a lifetime</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a profound</p>
<p>neurocognitive damaging effect.</p>
<p>Interesting, yeah, I know that sourcing is key</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re here, we&rsquo;re talking about clinical trials</p>
<p>where purity is assured</p>
<p>and, you know, years ago when so-called raves</p>
<p>were really popular, maybe they&rsquo;re still popular,</p>
<p>never been to one, so I wouldn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re happening or not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how in the know I am,</p>
<p>but it was clear that, you know,</p>
<p>testing for purity was important</p>
<p>because sometimes the drugs</p>
<p>are made such that there are contaminants</p>
<p>like methamphetamine,</p>
<p>which we know is highly neurotoxic.</p>
<p>I think that one reason why people</p>
<p>think that MDMA might be neurotoxic</p>
<p>is the reported drop in energy</p>
<p>or sort of feeling fatigued for a few days afterward.</p>
<p>I spoke to a physician colleague of ours</p>
<p>who said that that very likely has something to do</p>
<p>with the surge in prolactin</p>
<p>that arrives subsequent to the big dopamine surge</p>
<p>that occurs in MDMA.</p>
<p>And I mentioned that because I know a number of people</p>
<p>talk about serotonin depletion after taking MDMA.</p>
<p>He has in mind that while that could be true,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that anytime somebody takes something</p>
<p>or does something where there&rsquo;s a huge lift in dopamine,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s very likely a huge compensatory increase</p>
<p>in prolactin that follows,</p>
<p>and prolactin has a kind of sedative effect,</p>
<p>numbing effect on mood and libido, et cetera,</p>
<p>that eventually also wears off.</p>
<p>Does that make sense to you as a physician?</p>
<p>Yeah, it makes sense.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the difference between say MDMA</p>
<p>and psilocybin is that MDMA</p>
<p>is kind of an amphetamine of sorts, right?</p>
<p>So it has effects in dopamine,</p>
<p>and psilocybin&rsquo;s pretty neutral</p>
<p>and maybe a little bit of dopamine effects,</p>
<p>but kind of much more of a serotonergic-focused drug.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I think you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>kind of a different profile after,</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t heard that story,</p>
<p>but that makes sense to me too.</p>
<p>Since you mentioned psilocybin,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about</p>
<p>the neurochemistry of psilocybin.</p>
<p>As a serotonergic agent,</p>
<p>my understanding is it operates on these,</p>
<p>is it the 5-HT serotonin 2C receptor?</p>
<p>2A.</p>
<p>2A, excuse me, 2A and receptors,</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;ve seen a bunch of different reports</p>
<p>in terms of what it&rsquo;s actually doing to the brain</p>
<p>while people are under the effects of the drug.</p>
<p>And this is important for us to segment out</p>
<p>because there are the effects that happen</p>
<p>while people are under the influence,</p>
<p>and then the more long-lasting effects.</p>
<p>But some of the effects I&rsquo;ve heard about are, for instance,</p>
<p>and tell me again if these are right or wrong,</p>
<p>that there is increased activation of lateral connections,</p>
<p>sort of broader areas of the brain being co-active</p>
<p>than would normally occur.</p>
<p>Maybe that explains some of the synesthesias,</p>
<p>seeing sounds and hearing colors as the trivial example,</p>
<p>but rule-breaking within the mind.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;ve also heard that perhaps</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s lack of gating of sensory input.</p>
<p>So normally if I&rsquo;m looking at something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about the sensation in my right toe</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s relevant.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m thinking about the sensation in my right toe,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally not thinking about the truck</p>
<p>around the corner.</p>
<p>So we have these attentional spotlights,</p>
<p>but that somehow it creates a more, it adds spotlights.</p>
<p>Yeah, it de-gates the thalamus.</p>
<p>De-gates the thalamus, right,</p>
<p>through the reticular thalamic structure.</p>
<p>So what is the evidence that any of that is true?</p>
<p>And are there other phenomena?</p>
<p>Is there involvement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that we are aware of?</p>
<p>And where I&rsquo;m really headed here in a few minutes is,</p>
<p>is there a place for combining directed stimulation</p>
<p>of the brain with psychedelics</p>
<p>so that the effects of serotonin could be primarily</p>
<p>within the structures that you know from your work</p>
<p>to be relevant to depression?</p>
<p>But to simplify it first,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on when one takes psilocybin</p>
<p>and why is it interesting in light of depression?</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>So David Nutt and Robin Carhart-Harris&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>around neuroimaging psychedelics</p>
<p>are kind of some of the first folks to do that work.</p>
<p>And to their great surprise,</p>
<p>they thought there was gonna be an increase</p>
<p>in activity on psychedelics.</p>
<p>And what they found is the opposite, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of an overall decrease in the level</p>
<p>of activity in the brain with psychedelics.</p>
<p>But they have also looked at connectivity</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this kind of small world,</p>
<p>large world connectivity that you think about.</p>
<p>And so small world meaning there&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of a much more kind of focused</p>
<p>kind of cortical function or subcortical function</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And what you see is a difference in that level of engagement</p>
<p>and of brain regions.</p>
<p>So the connectivity, kind of global connectivity</p>
<p>to your point kind of increases.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think to kind of have a convergent theory on this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still to be determined.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of work I think that needs to be done.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly suggestive</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s pretty profound changes in brain activity</p>
<p>and brain connectivity after.</p>
<p>And what we found to be really interesting</p>
<p>is the antidepressant effects of psilocybin</p>
<p>have a particular connectivity change</p>
<p>that we also see with our TMS approaches, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this connectivity</p>
<p>between the subgenual anterior cingulate</p>
<p>and the default mode network.</p>
<p>And so when we do this effective</p>
<p>Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation,</p>
<p>we see a down regulation,</p>
<p>the connectivity between the negatively valenced mood state</p>
<p>in the case of depressed individuals</p>
<p>and the self-representation of the brain.</p>
<p>And you see that same connectivity change</p>
<p>occur post psilocybin,</p>
<p>suggesting there&rsquo;s a convergent mechanism.</p>
<p>And it makes sense, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve kind of got an over-connected,</p>
<p>negatively valenced system, conflict system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of attached onto the self-representation</p>
<p>and people feel stuck, right?</p>
<p>And then when you do whatever you do that&rsquo;s effective,</p>
<p>it unpairs those two systems.</p>
<p>I want to ask you about this phenomenon</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about during psilocybin journeys.</p>
<p>I heard about this from Dr. Matthew Johnson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s running a lot of the clinical trials at Johns Hopkins</p>
<p>and has been a guest on this podcast.</p>
<p>He said that there&rsquo;s something seems to be important</p>
<p>about the patient who&rsquo;s depressed</p>
<p>or who&rsquo;s and is under the influence of psilocybin</p>
<p>or the patient who&rsquo;s trying to get over smoking</p>
<p>or an eating disorder,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s taking psilocybin and is in the clinic,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something important to this notion</p>
<p>of letting go,</p>
<p>that people will feel as if their thoughts</p>
<p>and their feelings and maybe even their body</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t under their control</p>
<p>and that the clinician&rsquo;s job under those circumstances</p>
<p>is of course to make sure that they&rsquo;re physically safe,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t jump out a window</p>
<p>or try to actually give an example of a patient</p>
<p>who thought that, I think it was a she,</p>
<p>could move into the painting in the wall.</p>
<p>And obviously that wasn&rsquo;t true in the real world,</p>
<p>although it was true in her mind.</p>
<p>So they prevented her from doing that.</p>
<p>But that letting go,</p>
<p>that somehow untethering from the autonomic arousal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurring is important,</p>
<p>which brings us back to this idea</p>
<p>or me back to this idea of like a seesaw</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re sort of letting go of the hinge</p>
<p>and just sort of your heart rate&rsquo;s going up,</p>
<p>like just go with it and trust.</p>
<p>Your heart rate&rsquo;s going down, just go with it and trust.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about something very powerful</p>
<p>and depressing related to your childhood.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just supposed to go there without fear.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>in terms of what could happen.</p>
<p>So anyway, you get the picture.</p>
<p>Can we think of that as just the willingness</p>
<p>to do a million different variations</p>
<p>on the emotional stroop task?</p>
<p>You will entertain the full array of rules within your head</p>
<p>and consider them.</p>
<p>Or is there something more to it?</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re in the outer margins</p>
<p>of understanding here,</p>
<p>but what are your thoughts on this notion of letting go</p>
<p>as such a key variable for relief from depression</p>
<p>during the psychedelic journey?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about something</p>
<p>called exposure and response prevention therapy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a typical kind of gold standard treatment for OCD.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll help this a little bit conceptually.</p>
<p>And so what that really is, is it&rsquo;s a letting go therapy.</p>
<p>And so exposure response prevention,</p>
<p>the idea is that you have to expose the individual</p>
<p>to something that triggers an obsession</p>
<p>that they then want to do whatever the compulsion is.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll give you my first exposure</p>
<p>and response prevention patient when I was a resident.</p>
<p>He was very concerned about leaving the lights on his car.</p>
<p>And so what we did is we went out</p>
<p>and we turned the lights on in his car</p>
<p>and locked his door so his lights were on.</p>
<p>And he was super worried this is gonna kill his battery.</p>
<p>And we went and we spent an hour talking about things.</p>
<p>And we went back out to his car and his battery was fine</p>
<p>and his lights were on and he cranked the car</p>
<p>and we did it maybe one other time.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden that was gone, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the idea, is that you&rsquo;re essentially exposing</p>
<p>and you want to do it at levels that are,</p>
<p>from an anxiety standpoint, tolerable.</p>
<p>But exposing the person to something</p>
<p>and then letting them see that that exposure</p>
<p>ends up being fine, right?</p>
<p>It ends up not causing the thing</p>
<p>that they end up being worried about.</p>
<p>And so in some sense, being in the psychedelic state,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all taught at a level</p>
<p>to retain some level of control.</p>
<p>People have more or less of that,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all effectively retaining some level of control.</p>
<p>We all wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and put clothes on to go into society.</p>
<p>We all try to say, most people try to say the right things.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t try to do things that are outside</p>
<p>of cultural norms when they&rsquo;re in conversation.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re constantly at some level</p>
<p>controlling the situation that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not, it makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>that in that state, part of the therapeutic effect</p>
<p>that may be linked to the neural circuitry</p>
<p>is this idea of letting go</p>
<p>and essentially letting the system,</p>
<p>the network configuration maybe, whatever it is,</p>
<p>assume a state that you&rsquo;ve essentially</p>
<p>been fighting the whole time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same way that my OCD patient</p>
<p>was fighting this need to click the off button</p>
<p>on the lights of his car 50 times</p>
<p>before he would go and do whatever he needed to do.</p>
<p>And at some level, letting go there,</p>
<p>meaning letting us just turn the lights on</p>
<p>and him not do anything, or letting go,</p>
<p>meaning in the psychedelic state,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just letting go of whatever it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re holding onto, negatively valenced thoughts</p>
<p>about yourself in the setting of having depression</p>
<p>or re-experiencing a trauma, memory,</p>
<p>and allowing that to just happen</p>
<p>and re-seeing it again through a different light.</p>
<p>It feels the same in the sense that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s allowing for whatever&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with these psychedelic states to do whatever they do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>You said it&rsquo;s exposure response therapy</p>
<p>is the traditional name?</p>
<p>Exposure response prevention therapy.</p>
<p>Done outside of the psychedelic journey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done outside the psychedelic journey,</p>
<p>but that idea of letting go is present in both of those.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy, straight up, totally sober,</p>
<p>non-psychedelic, non-anything,</p>
<p>manualized psychotherapy that we know works really well</p>
<p>for OCD and then in that psychedelic state.</p>
<p>And so people have done studies with psilocybin</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s some studies with MDMA</p>
<p>trying to look at treating OCD</p>
<p>with the same sort of idea of letting go, right?</p>
<p>And how do you have an OCD patient kind of let go,</p>
<p>maybe even letting go of not washing their hands anymore,</p>
<p>kind of accepting the idea</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to get germs on their hands</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of part and parcel</p>
<p>of that same sort of thinking.</p>
<p>When I was in college,</p>
<p>I developed a compulsive superstition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid to admit this.</p>
<p>I somehow developed a knock on wood superstition</p>
<p>and I was actually kind of ashamed of it</p>
<p>because it rationally made no sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself a superstitious person,</p>
<p>never was a superstitious kid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d step on the sidewalk cracks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d walk under ladders,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably even try to walk under a ladder,</p>
<p>even though I don&rsquo;t suggest it.</p>
<p>But somehow I picked this thing up</p>
<p>and I used to sneak it at times.</p>
<p>I told my girlfriend at the time that I had it</p>
<p>in hopes that that would prevent me from doing it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>Sometimes it actually comes back where I think,</p>
<p>gosh, I didn&rsquo;t say knock on wood,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t knock on wood,</p>
<p>I hope that doesn&rsquo;t actually happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quote unquote crazy, right?</p>
<p>But crazy in the sense that it makes no sense rationally</p>
<p>why the events would be linked.</p>
<p>And yet I think a lot of people out there</p>
<p>do have internal superstitions.</p>
<p>Maybe by talking about it now, it&rsquo;ll go away.</p>
<p>Clearly I just need to challenge it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a, anyway,</p>
<p>I mentioned it because I consider myself,</p>
<p>you know, generally rational person,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting how these motor patterns</p>
<p>get activated and this notion of letting go,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t actually know what consequence I fear.</p>
<p>And the fear, as I was hearing the example you gave,</p>
<p>you know, the fear of the car battery running down,</p>
<p>I was about to say,</p>
<p>well, what if the battery actually did run out,</p>
<p>then the therapy would be undermined.</p>
<p>And yet that could also be interesting too,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>You jump the car.</p>
<p>But in my case,</p>
<p>I need to think about what the ultimate fear is.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know, I think a lot of people,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s interesting if you look at,</p>
<p>say the OCD scale or the depression scale or whatever,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t define normal as zero.</p>
<p>We define normal as some number range above,</p>
<p>so zero to, in the case of the Montgomery Asperg</p>
<p>depression rating scale,</p>
<p>one of the depression scales we use, 10, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the normal range.</p>
<p>And so people can have some sadness</p>
<p>and still be considered normal.</p>
<p>In the case of the OCD scale,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the same 10, right?</p>
<p>Where we say it&rsquo;s kind of starts to be,</p>
<p>you know, mildly abnormal or something.</p>
<p>And I always, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always tell the medical students,</p>
<p>look, my friends that are surf instructors,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more like a zero on the YBOC.</p>
<p>People that are professionals, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re non-zero, but it&rsquo;s still within the normal range.</p>
<p>And especially, you know,</p>
<p>in the case that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t sound like it got in your way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re obviously highly successful,</p>
<p>tenured professor at Stanford</p>
<p>and do all the great things that you do.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very much kind of within the normal range.</p>
<p>And I think totally assumed that a lot of people</p>
<p>have these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And as long, I think something as a psychiatric diagnosis,</p>
<p>when it severely impairs your ability to function,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when we kind of cross that threshold.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think that a lot of people,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re bringing this up.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very anti-stigmatizing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re bringing it up, right?</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of people hold that stuff in</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want to talk about it</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re worried</p>
<p>that somebody else may think something.</p>
<p>But the reality is, as a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>I talk to a lot of patients,</p>
<p>a lot of people that are, you know, family members,</p>
<p>you know, folks that are just going through</p>
<p>a death in the family, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And what you figure out is like,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s got a little something here and there.</p>
<p>Everybody has the knock in some way, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, and we&rsquo;re just all,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all just kind of more predisposed</p>
<p>not to talk about it.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s important to talk about it</p>
<p>because I think that when we start all talking about it,</p>
<p>then we realize that we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>kind of in this together in a way.</p>
<p>And that we&rsquo;re, and then some folks that, you know,</p>
<p>have to knock 100 times, we call that OCD.</p>
<p>When, you know, and they have all, you know, germ,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re worried about germs and all these other things,</p>
<p>we call that OCD.</p>
<p>And then in that circumstance, you know,</p>
<p>they need treatment, right?</p>
<p>But it is really on, just like blood sugar,</p>
<p>just like blood pressure, it&rsquo;s on a range, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just these discrete diagnoses.</p>
<p>You have them or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>I actually feel some relief just hearing this</p>
<p>because I am slightly, I wouldn&rsquo;t say ashamed,</p>
<p>I was sort of embarrassed by it,</p>
<p>but I offer it as a, you know,</p>
<p>it is what it is, as they say.</p>
<p>And it certainly doesn&rsquo;t seem to hinder my life</p>
<p>as much, knock on wood.</p>
<p>So if we could talk a bit about Ibogaine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about Ibogaine,</p>
<p>although anytime I hear the, you know, A-I-N-E,</p>
<p>you know, lidocaine, Ibogaine, I think of an anesthetic</p>
<p>and going to the dentist,</p>
<p>which is an unpleasant experience for me, generally.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, what is Ibogaine?</p>
<p>Does this have anything to do with the so-called toad?</p>
<p>You know, people talk about smoking frog skin, toad skin.</p>
<p>What is it used for clinically?</p>
<p>Is it legal in the U.S. as a clinical tool?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s using it and for what purposes?</p>
<p>If you could educate me on Ibogaine,</p>
<p>I truly know nothing about it,</p>
<p>except I think I know how to spell it correctly.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>So Ibogaine is one of the alkaloids</p>
<p>that you can extract from a Iboga tree root bark</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s typically growing in the country of Gabon, Africa.</p>
<p>So Gabon is one of the West African countries,</p>
<p>kind of middle of Africa on the West Coast.</p>
<p>And Gabon is, has a group of ferns</p>
<p>or folks, you know, called the Bwiti.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a religious kind of sacramental group</p>
<p>that sacramentally uses Iboga root bark</p>
<p>as part of that, the sacrament.</p>
<p>And they, they&rsquo;ve been using Iboga root bark</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, you know, part of the tradition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole, there&rsquo;s a whole set of,</p>
<p>of kind of ceremony around it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a book called Breaking Open the Head</p>
<p>by Daniel Pinchbeck that goes,</p>
<p>goes through and talks about this, this whole process.</p>
<p>But essentially, the Gabonese have been using this</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a kind of an atypical psychedelic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not a psychedelic</p>
<p>that we normally think about with psilocybin and LSD,</p>
<p>where there are visual perceptual changes, right?</p>
<p>So if you, if you take psilocybin or LSD,</p>
<p>what you, what you experience is you experience</p>
<p>these kind of visual perceptual differences</p>
<p>in the external world, right?</p>
<p>And on enough LSD or psilocybin,</p>
<p>an individual can actually perceive something visually</p>
<p>in the external world that isn&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>as we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Ibogaine doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Ibogaine does something different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like, have you ever seen Minority Report</p>
<p>with, you know, the movie with Tom Cruise?</p>
<p>I think 15 or 20 years ago or something,</p>
<p>so it dates us a little bit.</p>
<p>But it was this, it was this movie</p>
<p>where he would be able to go and see these kind of pre-crimes</p>
<p>and he had this big, you know, this big screen</p>
<p>where he could look at scenes from, from time</p>
<p>and like kind of go through that scene and see it.</p>
<p>And so what, what individuals taking Ibogaine will say</p>
<p>is that open eyes, they don&rsquo;t see anything,</p>
<p>but closed eyes, they&rsquo;ll go back through</p>
<p>and re-experience earlier life memories</p>
<p>and they will be able to experience it</p>
<p>from a place of empathy, not only for themselves,</p>
<p>but from others and kind of a detached empathy</p>
<p>and being able to see this as almost a third party,</p>
<p>even though they were there,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re able to see it, you know, as a third party.</p>
<p>So Claudio Naranjo, a psychiatrist from Argentina,</p>
<p>you know, described this in a lot of books that he wrote</p>
<p>in I think the 80s and 90s around this.</p>
<p>And so, you know, Ibogaine&rsquo;s been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Howard Lotsoff, American guy that brought it over</p>
<p>from Africa, he was a polysubstance user,</p>
<p>used every drug, you know, that he had his hands on,</p>
<p>took Ibogaine, including a lot of other psychedelics,</p>
<p>by the way, took Ibogaine</p>
<p>and then never did another drug again, supposedly,</p>
<p>because he had such a profound Ibogaine experience.</p>
<p>Ibogaine is in no way a recreational substance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a recreational substance</p>
<p>if you want it to be a recreational substance,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re essentially having this,</p>
<p>what they call a life review.</p>
<p>They also call it 10 years of psychotherapy in a night.</p>
<p>So these are the terminology that people talk about.</p>
<p>The issue-</p>
<p>How long does it last?</p>
<p>Is it truly one night?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually, you know, it can go,</p>
<p>depending upon if you get re-dosed or anything,</p>
<p>go sometimes, depending upon how fast you metabolize it,</p>
<p>sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be shorter, but it is a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very long time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely the longest acting</p>
<p>psychedelic substance I know of.</p>
<p>And so people will take this,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll have this re-evaluation of a given memory,</p>
<p>and then, as we were talking earlier,</p>
<p>re-consolidate that memory again,</p>
<p>and then it seems to have an effect</p>
<p>of that re-consolidation process.</p>
<p>And so about four or five years ago,</p>
<p>I was tapped by Robert Malenko,</p>
<p>one of the senior neuroscientists we both know</p>
<p>in the university.</p>
<p>He says, well, there&rsquo;s an unnamed donor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very interested in funding a group,</p>
<p>you know, a scientific kind of open-label study</p>
<p>of these Navy SEALs that have been going down to Mexico</p>
<p>and taking Ibogaine, and also a 5-MeO-DMT,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a second,</p>
<p>to treat PTSD, you know,</p>
<p>they claim to have traumatic brain injury,</p>
<p>depression, you know, that whole constellation of symptoms.</p>
<p>You know, and as it was described to me</p>
<p>by various people that had done this,</p>
<p>by their spouses and whatnot, you know,</p>
<p>John, we&rsquo;ll just say John,</p>
<p>John couldn&rsquo;t screw a light bulb into a light fixture,</p>
<p>right, they were just so debilitated,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t do simple tasks,</p>
<p>what we call activities of daily living.</p>
<p>And they were coming back</p>
<p>and having these really dramatic improvements</p>
<p>in, you know, all aspects of life.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we have over the last couple of years</p>
<p>been able to do this first in human</p>
<p>kind of full neurobiological,</p>
<p>clinical neurocognitive evaluation</p>
<p>of what Ibogaine is doing.</p>
<p>In this case, in special operations,</p>
<p>special forces individuals, former Navy SEALs,</p>
<p>former Army Rangers, that kind of crew of folks,</p>
<p>and look at the pre-post changes that we,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re experienced to be able</p>
<p>to totally quantitate all of that.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been able to capture</p>
<p>all the clinical scales, you know,</p>
<p>depression scales, PTSD scales,</p>
<p>all that standard stuff.</p>
<p>Neurocognitive batteries,</p>
<p>so how does your executive function work specifically,</p>
<p>how does your verbal memory, all of that.</p>
<p>And then neuroimaging and EEG.</p>
<p>So this will be the first human study of Ibogaine for those.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because Ibogaine&rsquo;s kind of the,</p>
<p>both seemingly the most potent and most,</p>
<p>seemingly to me at least, most powerful psychedelic,</p>
<p>but the one that has the most risk too,</p>
<p>because it has a cardiac effect.</p>
<p>It seems to be that you can screen people out</p>
<p>that have risk off of their electrocardiogram</p>
<p>and reduce the risk quite a bit,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we all did.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why people haven&rsquo;t really studied it as much.</p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t as, in addition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no, nobody goes to a rave on Ibogaine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no recreation at all with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, people say that it&rsquo;s relieving,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard work, right?</p>
<p>Because, yeah, you&rsquo;re reexamining things.</p>
<p>And, you know, and so then,</p>
<p>so then we see these folks after,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you, you know,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t fully analyzed the data yet,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you that, you know,</p>
<p>from what my folks are telling me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty dramatic.</p>
<p>You know, people come back and they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing a lot better.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing a lot better,</p>
<p>and nobody, I&rsquo;ll knock on wood,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s had any sort of cardiac issue at all,</p>
<p>you know, in the cohort that we&rsquo;ve studied.</p>
<p>And they look a lot better,</p>
<p>and they feel a lot better too.</p>
<p>And they describe these experiences</p>
<p>of being able to go back through,</p>
<p>and, you know, soldiers experience</p>
<p>something called moral injury, right?</p>
<p>Where they, maybe they accidentally blew something up</p>
<p>and it had a kid in it, or something like that.</p>
<p>You know, if they&rsquo;re in Afghanistan or Iraq,</p>
<p>maybe a child died on accident,</p>
<p>or maybe, you know, a civilian died,</p>
<p>or whatever it was, right?</p>
<p>And then they suffer these moral injuries</p>
<p>as part of the job,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost one of the kind of, you know,</p>
<p>vocational risks.</p>
<p>They come back and say that they&rsquo;ve forgiven themselves,</p>
<p>which is huge, right?</p>
<p>And part of that is being able to see themself</p>
<p>in a different light,</p>
<p>and having empathy, finally, for themself,</p>
<p>and being able to kind of have that experience of forgiving.</p>
<p>And so, very cool.</p>
<p>The study, you know, what was happening</p>
<p>was they were taking Ibogaine,</p>
<p>and then taking something called 5-MeO-DMT,</p>
<p>people call it TOAD.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Sonoran River TOAD, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can find these in Mexico,</p>
<p>find them in Arizona.</p>
<p>And in the back of the TOAD,</p>
<p>produces something called 5-MeO-DMT,</p>
<p>which is a flavor of DMT</p>
<p>that produces a particular psychedelic effect,</p>
<p>also used as a sacrament.</p>
<p>Is it a dimethyltryptamine, is that?</p>
<p>It is a 5-MeO-dimethyltryptamine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a kind of dimethyltryptamine</p>
<p>with a kind of addition to it.</p>
<p>The deal there is that it lasts longer</p>
<p>than traditional DMT.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like 20 minutes instead of five,</p>
<p>three or whatever kind of thing.</p>
<p>And so then, so these guys were taking Ibogaine,</p>
<p>and then they would take the 5-MeO-DMT</p>
<p>after we had to kind of divorce those two things,</p>
<p>be able to do the study</p>
<p>and just understand what Ibogaine was doing.</p>
<p>And they go back down a month later,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll do the 5-MeO-DMT.</p>
<p>So two completely separate sessions.</p>
<p>Two completely separate sessions.</p>
<p>And then one quick question about Ibogaine</p>
<p>before a bit more on 5-MeO-DMT.</p>
<p>Is the Ibogaine journey guided,</p>
<p>or the person just closes their eyes</p>
<p>and they just start falling</p>
<p>into the back catalog of memories?</p>
<p>They have a bunch of preparatory sessions,</p>
<p>and then they have a bunch of sessions after</p>
<p>that they kind of, they&rsquo;re able to kind of rehash things.</p>
<p>During, there&rsquo;s a sitter that sits there</p>
<p>and kind of sits with them and helps them out.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s pretty,</p>
<p>the phenomenon of the drug seems to drive a lot of this.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so a lot of it ends up being</p>
<p>what we call supportive psychotherapy,</p>
<p>or just kind of being there.</p>
<p>And you know, maybe you&rsquo;re holding the person&rsquo;s hand,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re just saying, I&rsquo;m here,</p>
<p>or maybe whatever it is,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re making sure they know you&rsquo;re around.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not really,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not really an interaction per se.</p>
<p>And then the whole kind of goal there</p>
<p>is just to get folks to kind of go back through</p>
<p>and re-examine these memories</p>
<p>and ultimately look like they re-consolidate them.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s this kind of, as you said earlier,</p>
<p>Timothy Leary kind of sociocultural construct</p>
<p>that ends up being overlaid over psychedelics.</p>
<p>And what I think is that if you rid yourself</p>
<p>of all of those preconceived notions</p>
<p>of what it is and isn&rsquo;t and the counterculture movement,</p>
<p>all that stuff that neither of us were ever involved in,</p>
<p>neither of us were ever partaken,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of straight scientists looking at this, right?</p>
<p>If you can kind of rid yourself</p>
<p>of all those sociocultural constructions</p>
<p>and then re-examine this,</p>
<p>these, if we just discovered these today,</p>
<p>we would say that these sorts of drugs</p>
<p>are a huge breakthrough in psychiatry</p>
<p>because they allow for us to do</p>
<p>a lot of the sorts of things we&rsquo;ve been thinking about</p>
<p>with SSRIs, with psychotherapy,</p>
<p>but kind of combined, right?</p>
<p>Psychotherapy plus drugs in a substance</p>
<p>that kind of allows you to re-examine these things.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting, there&rsquo;s a lot to do</p>
<p>to try to figure out if that&rsquo;s true, you know?</p>
<p>And I can say that as it stands right now,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know if that statement is true, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more work that needs to happen</p>
<p>for that statement to be proven to be true.</p>
<p>But the hypothesis is if it is true,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s very likely that this will be seen</p>
<p>as a breakthrough because it allows you</p>
<p>to do these sorts of things that you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>with normal waking consciousness.</p>
<p>But also why we have to really think about this</p>
<p>and you know, these drugs can&rsquo;t be recreational drugs.</p>
<p>They really shouldn&rsquo;t be recreational drugs, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really too powerful to be used</p>
<p>in the context of recreation</p>
<p>because they can put you into these states.</p>
<p>And this generation of psychedelic researchers</p>
<p>are really clear about that.</p>
<p>You know, I think the 60s folks were not clear about that</p>
<p>and they felt like there was this whole kind of cultural</p>
<p>thing that was going on there.</p>
<p>But I think this cohort of individuals really understands</p>
<p>that in order to really make this happen,</p>
<p>we have to understand that if you need a prescription</p>
<p>for an SSRI, which doesn&rsquo;t change your consciousness</p>
<p>a whole lot, and we&rsquo;re very worried about that</p>
<p>and the doctor has to evaluate you for that every week,</p>
<p>that the idea that some of these substances</p>
<p>would go outside of very strict medical supervision</p>
<p>is kind of preposterous, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a dumb moment, I think,</p>
<p>for all of medicine to say, look,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna do this right, we&rsquo;ve gotta do it</p>
<p>in such a way that&rsquo;s so protected, that&rsquo;s so safe,</p>
<p>that we make sure people know</p>
<p>these things are not recreational</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really for the pure purposes</p>
<p>of really powerfully changing cognition for a while</p>
<p>and letting people have these, what seem to be,</p>
<p>you know, relatively therapeutic states.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re doing this study</p>
<p>and along the lines of the sort of early iterations</p>
<p>of psychedelics and the counterculture of the 60s and 70s,</p>
<p>some of which took place, like One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Nest, I think, is actually based on the Menlo Park VA,</p>
<p>which is, you know, in our neighborhood of Stanford.</p>
<p>And things are quite a bit different now.</p>
<p>I know you and I have spent some time</p>
<p>with the operators and former operators</p>
<p>at an event on Last Veterans Day, in fact,</p>
<p>the so-called Veterans Solutions Group</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pioneering a lot of these psychedelic treatments</p>
<p>for former special operators and current special operators.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting to me about that</p>
<p>is in contrast to the counterculture movement</p>
<p>of the 60s and 70s, that room was filled with people</p>
<p>that are very much of a structure, the military, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no longer considered left-wing, right-wing,</p>
<p>anti-military, pro-military.</p>
<p>Here, this is just about one group of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s exploring psychedelics as a treatment</p>
<p>for trauma and PTSD and other things.</p>
<p>And of course, you also have other domains of society</p>
<p>looking at this.</p>
<p>And in fact, it was really interesting</p>
<p>because there were both far left and far right politicians</p>
<p>at that event, up on stage together,</p>
<p>talking about, in kind of lighter terms, heart medicine,</p>
<p>but also talking about neurobiology.</p>
<p>And it was just fascinating from the perspective</p>
<p>of somebody who&rsquo;s trying to learn about this stuff</p>
<p>that psychedelic therapies no longer sit</p>
<p>within the anti-establishment realm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s independent of all that.</p>
<p>Certainly when people in the military</p>
<p>are adopting it as a potential treatment.</p>
<p>Again, still under exploration,</p>
<p>but also under exploration at universities</p>
<p>like Stanford and Johns Hopkins and UCSF</p>
<p>and University College London and on and on.</p>
<p>Along the lines of tree barks and toad skins,</p>
<p>tell me about ayahuasca and as a plant, it&rsquo;s intriguing.</p>
<p>And is it a pro-serotonergic drug like psilocybin?</p>
<p>And is it useful for the same sorts of conditions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about thus far?</p>
<p>And if you could perhaps tell me a little bit also</p>
<p>about the Brazilian prisoner study.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Ayahuasca is another psychedelic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used as a sacrament in Brazil</p>
<p>and in Peru and Ecuador and Colombia.</p>
<p>So a lot of the South American countries.</p>
<p>And what they do is they combine two plants together</p>
<p>where one plant of the two plant combination</p>
<p>would effectively do nothing.</p>
<p>But the two plant combination together</p>
<p>is capable of producing this very profound</p>
<p>psychedelic effect.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really kind of curious</p>
<p>is that there are, as I understand it,</p>
<p>10 to 20,000 plant species in the Amazon.</p>
<p>And somehow, somebody.</p>
<p>Someone tried them all.</p>
<p>Combined these two plants together</p>
<p>in certain proportionality and cooked this</p>
<p>for five, 10 hours to the point where you cook out</p>
<p>the dimethyltryptamine out of one of the plants</p>
<p>and cook out the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor</p>
<p>out of the other plant in such a way</p>
<p>that the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor</p>
<p>prevents the GI breakdown of the dimethyltryptamine</p>
<p>in such a way that it&rsquo;s then allowed</p>
<p>to cross the blood-brain barrier and get into the brain.</p>
<p>And if you didn&rsquo;t add the reversible</p>
<p>monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant-derived</p>
<p>into this combination, then it would never cross the brain.</p>
<p>If you put people on a standard psychiatry-prescribed</p>
<p>monoamine oxidase inhibitor that wasn&rsquo;t reversible,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d throw them into serotonin syndrome, right?</p>
<p>So this kind of sweet spot that somehow</p>
<p>ayahuasca practitioners have found</p>
<p>being able to get DMT into the brain</p>
<p>from an oral source with this combination</p>
<p>of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is curious.</p>
<p>And so that substance has been explored</p>
<p>as an antidepressant agent,</p>
<p>and some studies have looked at that.</p>
<p>It also seems to be very safe.</p>
<p>There was a psychiatrist down at UCLA Harbor</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done a lot of work with this</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s looked at children, even,</p>
<p>that have been exposed to small doses of ayahuasca</p>
<p>as kind of a sacrament within Amazonian tribes</p>
<p>and found no neurocognitive effects,</p>
<p>no neurocognitive effects in adults.</p>
<p>And so it appears to be safe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of part and brought into various religions,</p>
<p>including kind of merged with Catholicism in South America,</p>
<p>which is kind of very interesting.</p>
<p>And so in some sects of Catholicism in Brazil,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s used as a sacrament during religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>And so it became interesting to Brazilian researchers</p>
<p>as to whether or not they could affect recidivism rates</p>
<p>for prisoners in Brazilian prisons, right?</p>
<p>So they gave half of the prisoners</p>
<p>some sort of inert substance</p>
<p>and half of the prisoners an ayahuasca session.</p>
<p>And the recidivism rate or the return to prison rate</p>
<p>in the ayahuasca-exposed individuals</p>
<p>was statistically significantly lower</p>
<p>than the recidivism rate in the control group,</p>
<p>suggesting that whatever&rsquo;s going on there</p>
<p>seems to have an effect on whatever drives</p>
<p>criminal behavior, whatever criminal behavior</p>
<p>that happened to be.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have the details</p>
<p>on the exact nature of the crime.</p>
<p>I am also in no way saying that we should just be giving</p>
<p>psychedelics to folks in prison and all of that.</p>
<p>I think that that is a very edgy thing to do</p>
<p>and probably not something that anybody should try.</p>
<p>But it does kind of bring up this curious question</p>
<p>of what is it about that that would drive people</p>
<p>to change those behaviors?</p>
<p>And why do people make those behavioral decisions?</p>
<p>And a lot of times, if you look at prisons</p>
<p>in the United States, people say this,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the biggest mental health facility</p>
<p>in the United States?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a prison.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there, for sure.</p>
<p>The homeless issue, the prison issue.</p>
<p>It does lead to something that I heard recently,</p>
<p>which is related to all this, which is cannabis.</p>
<p>We hear a lot nowadays about,</p>
<p>people will say, well, it&rsquo;s safer than alcohol.</p>
<p>And we did an episode on alcohol</p>
<p>that at least by my read of the literature,</p>
<p>indeed, alcohol does seem to be quite bad</p>
<p>for our health beyond.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that not drinking</p>
<p>is better for your health than drinking at all.</p>
<p>And here, I&rsquo;m not trying to tell people what to do,</p>
<p>but those are what the data say.</p>
<p>And forget the studies on red wine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to drink so much red wine</p>
<p>to get enough resveratrol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even clear resveratrol does anything useful</p>
<p>in any way, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, cannabis is now available</p>
<p>in a lot of very high potency forms.</p>
<p>People are vaping cannabis.</p>
<p>People are smoking cannabis.</p>
<p>I certainly am not saying that cannabis is bad</p>
<p>for people necessarily, although I think children,</p>
<p>I would hope that their brain development</p>
<p>would be completed first, get to age 25.</p>
<p>I know that sounds late for a lot of people,</p>
<p>but the THC obviously taps into some endogenous systems</p>
<p>of endocannabinoid systems and is powerful.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen this report that was in Lancet Psychiatry</p>
<p>this last year that said that early use of potent cannabis,</p>
<p>meaning age 14 to 20 or so,</p>
<p>can potentially lead to an exacerbation</p>
<p>of psychosis later in life.</p>
<p>And I actually put this out on social media</p>
<p>and it sort of exploded.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect it to.</p>
<p>And people were saying, well, that&rsquo;s not causal.</p>
<p>And obviously it&rsquo;s not causal because people say,</p>
<p>well, maybe people with psychotic tendencies</p>
<p>are seeking out cannabis.</p>
<p>Although that&rsquo;s sort of a weak argument</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s at least a four times,</p>
<p>a 4X increase in these psychotic episodes</p>
<p>for people later in life.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts about cannabis?</p>
<p>Because I do want to acknowledge</p>
<p>that it does have medical benefits for certain things,</p>
<p>a pain, chemotherapy.</p>
<p>So by no means trying to knock on cannabis</p>
<p>and its appropriate medicinal use,</p>
<p>but what should we think about cannabis</p>
<p>in terms of this finding that can exacerbate a psychosis</p>
<p>in certain individuals?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think there&rsquo;s a couple of things, right?</p>
<p>So cannabis is multiple cannabinoids, right?</p>
<p>THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and indicas.</p>
<p>It gets, yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot there to unpack.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>but there are two main kind of chemicals you think about</p>
<p>and kind of how things are essentially bred, right?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of cannabis</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really bred to be very high, very potent THC,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s cannabis where the THC&rsquo;s bred completely out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s stories from Colorado, right?</p>
<p>This strain of cannabis that&rsquo;s THC-free.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no THC at all, and it&rsquo;s all CBD,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called Charlotte&rsquo;s Web.</p>
<p>And a bunch of kids&rsquo; parents,</p>
<p>one kid and then kind of a string of parents</p>
<p>after that moved to Colorado when cannabis was legalized</p>
<p>because CBD is anti-epileptic.</p>
<p>So CBD is also anti-psychotic.</p>
<p>And so there have been a number of studies</p>
<p>that if you give CBD at high doses,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s anti-psychotic in schizophrenic,</p>
<p>established schizophrenic patients.</p>
<p>The issue is that we&rsquo;ve bred CBD out of marijuana</p>
<p>selectively over time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve gotten very good</p>
<p>at figuring out how to do that, right?</p>
<p>Conversely, THC is pro-psychotic and pro-epileptic, right?</p>
<p>And so when you talk about does cannabis cause psychosis</p>
<p>or does cannabis treat psychosis,</p>
<p>it appears to be more related to the proportions of CBD</p>
<p>to THC than it does to the kind of idea of cannabis.</p>
<p>So for me, there&rsquo;s a, and I have no stock on this</p>
<p>or anything like that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a company called GW Pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t looked into them in a while,</p>
<p>but they have a lot of clinical trials</p>
<p>for something called Dravet&rsquo;s syndrome,</p>
<p>which is a seizure disorder where kids seize a whole lot.</p>
<p>Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which is a seizure disorder</p>
<p>where kids are seizing 300 times a day.</p>
<p>Both of these are like kids are seizing so much</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically in a seizure</p>
<p>or in the post-ictal phase constantly.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve failed everything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve failed barbiturates, they&rsquo;ve failed bromides,</p>
<p>which we just don&rsquo;t use anymore,</p>
<p>except in these cases because of the side effects,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give kids CBD.</p>
<p>And I think CBD is a pretty safe drug</p>
<p>compared to bromide, right?</p>
<p>And so this idea that CBD in a kid is actually safe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cannabinoid, but it&rsquo;s CBD and it&rsquo;s safe, right?</p>
<p>And so that to me is totally fine.</p>
<p>Also giving CBD as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been some positive trials</p>
<p>and negative trials in that,</p>
<p>but there seems to be no negative side effects.</p>
<p>It seems to reduce some of the metabolic syndrome issues</p>
<p>in folks with schizophrenia who are having side effects</p>
<p>from the primary antipsychotic.</p>
<p>The converse is there&rsquo;s clearly cases</p>
<p>where people that are taking very high doses of THC</p>
<p>become psychotic, they get put into the psychiatric unit,</p>
<p>nothing happens other than they kind of get the THC</p>
<p>out of their system,</p>
<p>and then they resolve their psychosis, right?</p>
<p>And so that, and a handful of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve had seizures related to high doses of THC,</p>
<p>and syncope, and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>And so this idea that THC, high doses of THC</p>
<p>can be pro-psychotic is also not taking a shot</p>
<p>at people that think that cannabis overall is a good thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it just is what it is.</p>
<p>And the kind of pure, if you,</p>
<p>I think if you zoom back and you say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a true naturalist,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about natural medicines in the world,</p>
<p>you should think, well, probably marijuana</p>
<p>was balanced THC, CBD at some point,</p>
<p>and then we just, we humans messed with it, right?</p>
<p>And that most likely that was probably okay at some level,</p>
<p>and then we pushed it one way or another.</p>
<p>And what I mean by okay is in a 45-year-old,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay kind of thing.</p>
<p>Now, what I think is going on with the kids,</p>
<p>with the teenagers is you&rsquo;ve got prefrontal maturation,</p>
<p>right, and then you&rsquo;re exposing them</p>
<p>to a whole lot of high THC load.</p>
<p>And while it&rsquo;s unclear if it&rsquo;s cause or effect,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly in the picture.</p>
<p>And if I were a parent,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want my 16-year-old smoking marijuana.</p>
<p>If I were a parent and my 30-year-old</p>
<p>otherwise healthy, totally fine, whatever,</p>
<p>banker, lawyer, kid, decided to try marijuana</p>
<p>for the first time, I wouldn&rsquo;t scold them about it, right?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s kind of a different thing, right?</p>
<p>I would never want my up to 25-year-old,</p>
<p>just like you&rsquo;re saying, before prefrontal maturation,</p>
<p>I would never want my kid to be exposed at all.</p>
<p>But it looks like, except in susceptible individuals</p>
<p>or susceptible to drug-induced psychosis,</p>
<p>it looks like it&rsquo;s a relatively safe thing</p>
<p>past prefrontal maturation.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not gonna comment of cause and effect,</p>
<p>but I would say that if you&rsquo;re a parent,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, right?</p>
<p>You never know what&rsquo;s ultimately gonna hurt your kid.</p>
<p>I mean, we were talking about this earlier,</p>
<p>my wife&rsquo;s pregnant now, she kind of avoids everything,</p>
<p>right, and rightfully so, right?</p>
<p>This idea that we just, we wanna be careful</p>
<p>when our children&rsquo;s brains are developing,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s really what you were saying,</p>
<p>and I think actually important.</p>
<p>The bigger question that you asked,</p>
<p>which is relative risks of drugs, is an interesting one.</p>
<p>So David Nutt published in, I think it was in The Lancet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to look it up, but I think in The Lancet,</p>
<p>an article about relative drug risks</p>
<p>for the person and for society, and this was like,</p>
<p>he was on the UK&rsquo;s British drug policy group,</p>
<p>where essentially what he showed was,</p>
<p>if you look at societal risk plus personal risk,</p>
<p>and you combine those two, you know what drug</p>
<p>is the most dangerous drug in the world?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna guess it&rsquo;s alcohol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s alcohol, right behind heroin and cocaine,</p>
<p>and da-da-da-da-da, and somewhere in the middle</p>
<p>is marijuana, and right on the tail end,</p>
<p>on the other, on the exact other end of this, psilocybin.</p>
<p>Is caffeine, usually doesn&rsquo;t make the list.</p>
<p>It may have been on the list.</p>
<p>If it was, it was probably pretty close to psilocybin,</p>
<p>but somewhere in the middle was ketamine,</p>
<p>somewhere in the middle was amphetamine,</p>
<p>somewhere in the, you know, a little closer to psilocybin,</p>
<p>I think it was MDMA, you know, but it&rsquo;s this combined</p>
<p>personal, you know, kind of world risk of these things,</p>
<p>and so alcohol makes it, because there&rsquo;s a huge amount</p>
<p>of personal risk, and there&rsquo;s a huge amount</p>
<p>of societal risk, right?</p>
<p>Drunk drivers kill X amount of people in the world.</p>
<p>Fight, sexual assault, all that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then all the cancer and all that stuff,</p>
<p>and so it beats out cocaine, it beats out heroin,</p>
<p>it beats out all of these things, and yet we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t as a culture, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t as a culture see it as a drug,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the part that really baffles me, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not-</p>
<p>I mean, they serve it, I mean, this is no knock</p>
<p>on Stanford at all, of course I wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>This is, at every institution I&rsquo;ve been to,</p>
<p>they serve alcohol at the graduate student events.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, they serve alcohol, they do a happy hour.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a drinker, I can take it or leave it,</p>
<p>so, and I realize that some people,</p>
<p>they really enjoy alcohol, you know, my former partner,</p>
<p>I mean, she just was in that, you know, 10% or so</p>
<p>of people who have a glass of wine and just feel great,</p>
<p>and the second one feel great.</p>
<p>I just want to take a nap after I have a bit of alcohol,</p>
<p>so it never does much for me.</p>
<p>I always feel poisoned, I feel lucky in that sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s unbelievable that it is so prevalent,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s baked into the medical,</p>
<p>even medical institutions, they&rsquo;ll pop a bottle of champagne</p>
<p>to celebrate the opening of a hospital.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>You know, I think what&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>but this is me, you know, looking at a crystal ball</p>
<p>a little bit, but I think what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>is what happened with doctors and smoking.</p>
<p>So if you look at the 50s and 60s, right,</p>
<p>there are all these pictures of doctors smoking cigarettes,</p>
<p>you know, with patients or, you know,</p>
<p>psychiatrists doing psychotherapy and smoking a cigarette</p>
<p>with the patient sitting on the couch, you know,</p>
<p>surgeons smoking a cigarette in between cases.</p>
<p>There are all these pictures of that, right,</p>
<p>and now all of a sudden, smoking&rsquo;s totally banned.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s totally banned for most of Stanford campus.</p>
<p>My suspicion is, as you&rsquo;re suggesting, right,</p>
<p>you know, this is everywhere and it&rsquo;s all kind of ubiquitous.</p>
<p>At some critical point, some tipping point,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s going to realize that just like with smoking,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to rid hospital systems</p>
<p>and universities of alcohol.</p>
<p>And at some point in 50 years, it&rsquo;s my view that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll look back at these scenarios that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>and be like, you know what, we were foolish about this.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t believe that we gave people alcohol</p>
<p>when they graduated from whatever, you know,</p>
<p>and I think we&rsquo;ll have a different take on it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to take a longer time.</p>
<p>I think people did a really good job</p>
<p>tying smoking to lung cancer,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a very simplistic story,</p>
<p>smoking, lung cancer, you know?</p>
<p>Now, as you know, alcohol increases the risk</p>
<p>of a lot of different cancers,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so clear which one.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like, you know, the kind of oral,</p>
<p>like the throat, tongue cancer, that&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>Breast cancer.</p>
<p>Yeah, breast cancer, you know,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s a harder story to tell,</p>
<p>you know, and I think that&rsquo;s why, and everybody,</p>
<p>you know, and then there&rsquo;s this whole,</p>
<p>my mom says this, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I drink my glass of wine because my doctor told me</p>
<p>it was heart healthy, and we were talking about this,</p>
<p>and I try to, no, no, no, but Dr. So-and-so</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s heart healthy, and so it ends up being this thing</p>
<p>where, like, she&rsquo;s drinking alcohol</p>
<p>because she thinks that it&rsquo;s good for her heart,</p>
<p>and, you know, and it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had those conversations with her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to untie that, and I think that, yeah,</p>
<p>at some point, we&rsquo;re going to hit some threshold moment,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be interesting if we really look at the data,</p>
<p>and we really look at what&rsquo;s safe and not safe</p>
<p>from purely from this analysis.</p>
<p>It kind of points to the right direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting, and also,</p>
<p>just saying nothing of poor judgment</p>
<p>under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>I mean, I would venture that if we were to remove alcohol</p>
<p>from university campuses, watch the students</p>
<p>are going to lobby against me if I say this,</p>
<p>but if you were to remove alcohol from campuses,</p>
<p>I mean, just think about the,</p>
<p>what I suspect would be the improvement</p>
<p>in good decision-making, and that would occur,</p>
<p>or, you know, I&rsquo;ve got stories from graduate school,</p>
<p>and it was very different, you know, 10 years ago.</p>
<p>There was a lot more alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Again, that was never my thing,</p>
<p>but I know people who make really bad decisions.</p>
<p>In any case, there&rsquo;s a whole landscape there emerging.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve got your finger right on the pulse of it.</p>
<p>I want to touch on something slightly different</p>
<p>than what we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>but definitely related to depression,</p>
<p>and this, again, is one of these intriguing</p>
<p>but perplexing things, which is that sleep deprivation</p>
<p>can improve symptoms of depression,</p>
<p>and yet I&rsquo;m personally very familiar with the fact</p>
<p>that if I don&rsquo;t sleep well for one night,</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t sleep at all, in fact,</p>
<p>I do have an ability to function pretty well the next day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do this non-sleep deep rest practice</p>
<p>that I blab a lot about on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>which for me is tremendously restorative,</p>
<p>but I like a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>I think everybody understands now,</p>
<p>thanks to the great work of Matthew Walker and others,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve really gotten out into the world saying,</p>
<p>look, the foundation of mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and high performance, if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>being a functional human being,</p>
<p>is to try and get enough quality deep sleep</p>
<p>at least 80% of the nights of your life, if you can.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something to focus on, just like good nutrition,</p>
<p>just like exercise and social connection, et cetera.</p>
<p>So sleep deprivation, we know, can, in particular,</p>
<p>I think rapid eye movement components of sleep deprivation</p>
<p>can improve the symptoms of depression,</p>
<p>and yet being sleep deprived</p>
<p>can also really dysregulate our control</p>
<p>of the autonomic system.</p>
<p>I notice on night two or night three of poor sleep,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going through a stressful phase and that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>all of a sudden my heart rate is chronically elevated.</p>
<p>My thought patterns become really disrupted.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t then exercise.</p>
<p>My decision-making is thrown off.</p>
<p>My emotionality is more labile.</p>
<p>The hinge, as we were referring to it earlier,</p>
<p>feels less in control, under my control,</p>
<p>and maybe I wonder sometimes if I enter that state</p>
<p>that you referred to earlier</p>
<p>where the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is no longer leading the cingulate,</p>
<p>but the cingulate is now in charge.</p>
<p>The players are in charge of the coach.</p>
<p>Not a good situation.</p>
<p>So I know you&rsquo;ve done some work on sleep deprivation</p>
<p>and light and effects.</p>
<p>Please tell us about that,</p>
<p>and please tell us about this triple therapy.</p>
<p>Is that-</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so friend of mine, Greg Salem,</p>
<p>another one of the professors at Stanford,</p>
<p>was very interested in sleep.</p>
<p>He did a bunch of training in sleep</p>
<p>before he went to medical school</p>
<p>and got very interested in this idea that,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re saying, if you sleep deprive somebody one night</p>
<p>in just kind of an isolated single night,</p>
<p>at the end of that sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>they will have an antidepressant effect,</p>
<p>but as soon as they fall asleep, they lose it.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a depressed individual,</p>
<p>you can get them to be less depressed acutely</p>
<p>as soon as they fall asleep.</p>
<p>They wake up eight hours later,</p>
<p>then they come back into the same level of depression.</p>
<p>And so the idea was that you needed to do</p>
<p>some sort of circadian reset,</p>
<p>and that part of what depression is</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a dysregulated circadian system.</p>
<p>And so mentors of mine say,</p>
<p>if you can just get the sleep better,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s half the battle of dealing with depression</p>
<p>because so many people have insomnia around depression</p>
<p>and have a whole host of types of insomnia,</p>
<p>having a hard time falling asleep,</p>
<p>waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and waking up earlier, all symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>And so what this does is it sleep deprives the individual</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a certain calculation</p>
<p>of shifting their phase</p>
<p>and simultaneously exposing them to bright light.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the triple, the phase shift,</p>
<p>the sleep deprivation and the bright light</p>
<p>to try to get their circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Essentially, the theory is re-entrained.</p>
<p>And so in the trials that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and other trials prior to ours and after,</p>
<p>it looked like there was a pretty profound</p>
<p>antidepressant effect from this triple therapy</p>
<p>that seemed to be durable,</p>
<p>meaning durability is this term we use</p>
<p>to say that not only can you get point relief,</p>
<p>but that the relief ends up lasting.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important to know about this</p>
<p>is you shouldn&rsquo;t do this at home for sure.</p>
<p>You would need to do this with a professional</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s complicated, it&rsquo;s not just one thing.</p>
<p>And in sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>while it seems to be antidepressant, it&rsquo;s pro-anxiety.</p>
<p>So if you take a highly anxious person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not depressed and you sleep deprive them,</p>
<p>they get profoundly anxious.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the other thing</p>
<p>that you have to really realize</p>
<p>is that this is like everything else</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about today,</p>
<p>all things that you have to do under medical supervision,</p>
<p>but curious, right?</p>
<p>And I think the question that always comes up</p>
<p>is why isn&rsquo;t this used more?</p>
<p>And I think the reason is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not really a mechanism for,</p>
<p>ultimately in medicine, as sad as it is,</p>
<p>you have to have a code to do a thing.</p>
<p>There has to be a code associated with a treatment</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to figure out how to make a code for this.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>And so if there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>and somebody&rsquo;s got to kind of take that baton on that,</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s a way to make a code for this,</p>
<p>I think you could actually turn it into something</p>
<p>that was more widely utilized.</p>
<p>And probably dream up ways of how to integrate AI,</p>
<p>passive sensing, all that stuff to really make that work.</p>
<p>But I think that would be the idea,</p>
<p>that would be the trajectory I&rsquo;d see.</p>
<p>Yeah, having a billable to insurance code is fundamental.</p>
<p>And a lot of listeners to this podcast,</p>
<p>I think have a background in engineering science</p>
<p>and we will put a link to that manuscript</p>
<p>that talks about the triple therapy,</p>
<p>because here we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>one night sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>some time to light exposure to the eyes</p>
<p>and then shifting in the circadian clock,</p>
<p>things central to the themes of this podcast</p>
<p>that come up often.</p>
<p>I think for the typical person,</p>
<p>can we say that trying to get a regular light dark cycle</p>
<p>and sleep rhythm would be beneficial</p>
<p>for overall mood regulation?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think for the typical person,</p>
<p>really kind of re-regulating your sleep</p>
<p>and trying to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>in which you fall asleep, stay asleep,</p>
<p>wake up at a set time every morning</p>
<p>is going to be pretty crucial.</p>
<p>In mild depression, I think that one has a lot of control</p>
<p>over that as we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>I think when you hit some threshold in depression</p>
<p>where things become kind of semi-volitional,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to kind of will yourself into that.</p>
<p>There are therapies like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a CBT for insomnia, for instance,</p>
<p>where you can do cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>to help with insomnia.</p>
<p>Sometimes people, and I&rsquo;m no sleep expert,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d kind of pass this to Greg to fully talk about this,</p>
<p>but some of what goes on that people</p>
<p>with kind of milder insomnia experience</p>
<p>is like blue light out of their computer</p>
<p>and things like that that they,</p>
<p>so you can use like blue light blockers</p>
<p>and it tricks your brain, as you know better than me,</p>
<p>it tricks your brain to think that it&rsquo;s still light outside</p>
<p>and so people will, they&rsquo;ll have insomnia</p>
<p>because their brain still thinks that it&rsquo;s light outside</p>
<p>and then people will, the kind of strict CBT for sleep,</p>
<p>therapists will say there are only two things</p>
<p>that you should do in your bed</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re under a certain age and whatnot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really one thing that you should do in your bed,</p>
<p>which is to sleep and be with your partner, right?</p>
<p>And so those are kind of the two things</p>
<p>that you should do in a bedroom</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really the only things</p>
<p>that you should do in a bedroom</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having sleep problems.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t watch TV in a bedroom,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t eat in a bedroom, shouldn&rsquo;t hang out.</p>
<p>Keep the phone out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>Keep the phone out of the bedroom, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should get Greg Salem on the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention for people</p>
<p>that want to regulate their sleep,</p>
<p>we have a sleep toolkit that&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>as a downloadable PDF at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>Just go to the menu</p>
<p>and a lot of the things in that toolkit</p>
<p>are based on work from Stanford Sleep Laboratories,</p>
<p>including Jamie Zeitzer&rsquo;s and others&rsquo; lab,</p>
<p>not aimed at depression specifically.</p>
<p>Listen, Nolan, Dr. Williams,</p>
<p>this has been an amazing voyage</p>
<p>through the circuitry of autonomic control.</p>
<p>This landscape of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is I find incredibly fascinating</p>
<p>and I just want to start off by saying,</p>
<p>please do come back again</p>
<p>and teach us more about that and your TMS work.</p>
<p>Before we wrap, however,</p>
<p>I do want to give you the opportunity</p>
<p>to talk about the SAINT study.</p>
<p>Is it SAINT or saints, plural?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s SAINT.</p>
<p>So SAINT or what we&rsquo;re calling it S-A-I-N-T now,</p>
<p>SAINT has, you know, the intent was not</p>
<p>to kind of connect it to religion,</p>
<p>but we may have accidentally done so.</p>
<p>We abbreviated it to S-A-I-N-T for the subsequent trials,</p>
<p>which was initially</p>
<p>Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy,</p>
<p>or now we&rsquo;re calling Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy,</p>
<p>but the idea there, which is a cool idea,</p>
<p>is that TMS is a device that delivers a treatment</p>
<p>and the treatment is the protocol</p>
<p>and the protocol is the stimulation parameter set</p>
<p>in a specific brain region for a specific condition.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s cool about neuromodulation,</p>
<p>whether it be transcranial magnetic stimulation</p>
<p>or transcranial direct current stimulation</p>
<p>or deep brain stimulation,</p>
<p>like what Casey Halpern talked about on another podcast,</p>
<p>is this idea that in all of those cases,</p>
<p>the device itself is a physical layer conduit</p>
<p>of a stimulation protocol that&rsquo;s therapeutic</p>
<p>for a given condition in a given brain region.</p>
<p>And so in the case of depression,</p>
<p>which we know the most about with TMS,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been doing TMS studies for depression since 1995,</p>
<p>right, and a clearance in 2008, 2009.</p>
<p>And in that timeframe, we were able to go</p>
<p>from really knowing very little at all</p>
<p>about how to do something like this</p>
<p>to getting an FDA clearance.</p>
<p>And the way that it went down was that</p>
<p>there were two groups studying different components at NIH.</p>
<p>The first group was studying mood neuroanatomy</p>
<p>on functional imaging that was kind of the first generation</p>
<p>of functional imaging back then, so PET scans,</p>
<p>which are kind of metabolic scans, and then SPECT scans.</p>
<p>And the idea there was looking at activity</p>
<p>and metabolism in prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And what they found in these kind of more crude scans</p>
<p>is a just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism.</p>
<p>The other group right upstairs at the National Institute</p>
<p>for Neurological Diseases and Stroke, NINDS,</p>
<p>they were looking at using TMS,</p>
<p>which had been around for 10 years,</p>
<p>and repetitively stimulating in motor cortex.</p>
<p>What they found was, gosh, we can get a readout</p>
<p>in thumb muscle movement amplitude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really reproducible across people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s universally reproducible.</p>
<p>And if we do certain stimulation approaches,</p>
<p>they are biologically active to either increase excitability,</p>
<p>i.e. the thumb motion on a set intensity goes up,</p>
<p>the amount of amplitude goes up,</p>
<p>or inhibitory, depotentiating,</p>
<p>it goes down with other biological stimulation approaches.</p>
<p>And then a third outcome, which is important,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s inert, it doesn&rsquo;t do either.</p>
<p>So you can have stimulation approaches that do one,</p>
<p>increase activity, decrease activity, or are inert.</p>
<p>And so what they found was,</p>
<p>oh, we can excite certain brain regions.</p>
<p>And my mentor, Mark George, had this kind of aha moment</p>
<p>where he said, wow, there&rsquo;s underactivity</p>
<p>in prefrontal cortex in depression,</p>
<p>and we can increase activity using this thing</p>
<p>that we know we can increase activity in motor cortex,</p>
<p>we just need to put it</p>
<p>in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>and then they combined the two and started stimulating</p>
<p>once a day in this kind of very abbreviated fashion,</p>
<p>and lo and behold, some of those depression patients</p>
<p>resolved their depression, and back then, and still today,</p>
<p>you can go, and as a psychiatric patient,</p>
<p>stay at the National Institute of Mental Health</p>
<p>and go through clinical trials to try to get treated,</p>
<p>and there were patients who&rsquo;d been there for months,</p>
<p>and they were able to be discharged</p>
<p>because their mood was better.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so it was this very crude approach</p>
<p>where they were using ruler measurements</p>
<p>where DLPFC was, and they were stimulating with devices</p>
<p>that you needed to physically dunk the coil in an ice bath,</p>
<p>and with that, they still were able to,</p>
<p>the kind of genius of this, Mark and others,</p>
<p>they would still be able to create</p>
<p>a purely engineered stimulation approach.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s cool about that is that</p>
<p>they kind of found two things, right?</p>
<p>They found this one stimulation protocol</p>
<p>that does have some antidepressant effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s limited.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t treat everybody.</p>
<p>It does have some antidepressant effect,</p>
<p>and this bigger concept that a neuromodulation device</p>
<p>is kind of like a pharmaceutical company for you, right,</p>
<p>that in a given individual, a TMS device</p>
<p>or whatever neuromodulation device is able to generate,</p>
<p>you can create a stimulation approach</p>
<p>that is specific to a given condition</p>
<p>and specific to an individual,</p>
<p>and so the physical layer is just how you exert that,</p>
<p>similarly to how we make pharmaceutical drugs</p>
<p>in a pharmaceutical company,</p>
<p>but the actual therapy itself is what you do</p>
<p>where you do it, and so what we learned from</p>
<p>another 20, 30 years of this</p>
<p>is that you can modify the stimulation protocol</p>
<p>in such a way where you can create a whole new treatment</p>
<p>and put it through the same TMS device,</p>
<p>or thank God, an evolved version of it</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have to dunk it in ice baths</p>
<p>and they can actually really handle</p>
<p>much more aggressive stimulation approaches,</p>
<p>and so in 2005, a group published in Neuron,</p>
<p>a paper demonstrating that if you stimulate</p>
<p>with the hippocampal rhythms through a TMS coil,</p>
<p>you can excite the brain with memory rhythms,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll last an hour,</p>
<p>so you can change cortical excitability</p>
<p>in this thumb twitch for an hour,</p>
<p>sending three minutes of excitatory,</p>
<p>or 40 seconds in the case of inhibitory stimulation</p>
<p>that mimics the hippocampal rhythms,</p>
<p>so much more efficient than the original TMS approaches,</p>
<p>and so after that, group tried to do it</p>
<p>in this kind of six-week schedule,</p>
<p>and after that, and while they were doing that,</p>
<p>we decided, gosh, this problem I talked about</p>
<p>at the beginning of the show where you have this problem</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have a treatment for people</p>
<p>who are in these high-acuity psychiatric emergency states,</p>
<p>this idea that we&rsquo;re gonna engineer a treatment</p>
<p>where we can reorganize the stimulation approach in time</p>
<p>to be much more efficient by utilizing</p>
<p>something called space learning theory,</p>
<p>and so you probably know about the space learning theory,</p>
<p>so the idea for the viewers is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a simple psychological thing,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve also seen it in hippocampal slice</p>
<p>sort of physiology too,</p>
<p>where if I&rsquo;m cramming for a test,</p>
<p>what I do is I write out 60 note cards,</p>
<p>and I read each one for a minute</p>
<p>until I get to the first note card again,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s about an hour later, right,</p>
<p>and we just intuitively do this.</p>
<p>We all automatically do that,</p>
<p>and we intuit that because we know</p>
<p>that what doesn&rsquo;t work is writing out one note card</p>
<p>and looking at it over and over again.</p>
<p>Nobody ever does that, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been in graduate school, medical school,</p>
<p>and we have these big stacks of note cards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s space learning theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this idea that you need to see it</p>
<p>about every hour to an hour and a half,</p>
<p>and that optimizes learning.</p>
<p>If you take the same stimulation approach</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>this theta-burst stimulation approach,</p>
<p>and you take a hippocampal slice of a mouse</p>
<p>and you stimulate,</p>
<p>you enlarge some dendritic spines and you prime some,</p>
<p>and then if you stimulate right after that,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get any change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called in-mass stimulation,</p>
<p>but if you wait about an hour to an hour and a half,</p>
<p>you get more dendritic spines enlarged and more primed,</p>
<p>which, by the way, also is what ketamine does.</p>
<p>It causes this dendritic spine enlargement,</p>
<p>and so what we found was that the old way of doing TMS,</p>
<p>this idea of just doing it once a day,</p>
<p>every day, five days a week for six weeks,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t utilize the space learning theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like studying for a month or two,</p>
<p>just a little bit once a day.</p>
<p>You remember some of that stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as potent as that week</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re kind of cramming, right?</p>
<p>And what we realized is that if we could</p>
<p>reorganize the stimulation in time</p>
<p>so that we took the whole six-week course,</p>
<p>we actually figured out a way to do it in a day.</p>
<p>And then what we also figured out</p>
<p>is that people were underdosing TMS</p>
<p>because if you just keep going after six weeks</p>
<p>out to month three, four, five,</p>
<p>more and more people got better,</p>
<p>so we figured out it&rsquo;s not just one day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna give five times the normal dose.</p>
<p>We have seven and a half months worth in five days</p>
<p>using space learning theory.</p>
<p>So every hour?</p>
<p>Every hour for 10 hours.</p>
<p>For five days.</p>
<p>For five days, so it&rsquo;s a 50-hour block.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 90 minutes of actual stimulation,</p>
<p>but spread out through the day in the same way of learning,</p>
<p>which is perfect for an inpatient psychiatric unit, right?</p>
<p>Five days is manageable.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can get stimulation.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s ever dropped out by the schedule.</p>
<p>Folks that want to do this want to do it,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ll do their nine minutes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go get breakfast.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do their nine minutes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go see their therapist or whatever it is,</p>
<p>and so what we found with this reorganization</p>
<p>in time of the stimulation, dose,</p>
<p>and then the third component is we do</p>
<p>resting state functional connectivity scans on everybody,</p>
<p>and we have ways now in the last five to 10 years</p>
<p>of picking out that specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit</p>
<p>that I was talking about earlier, that cingulate DLPFC.</p>
<p>We can pick that out in every single one.</p>
<p>If you want to come to the lab,</p>
<p>we can find your DLPFC subgenual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even more robust than non-depressed.</p>
<p>Maybe we can stimulate too just while we&rsquo;re in there.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you want to, we can move around</p>
<p>your hypnotizability, and we can find that spot</p>
<p>in each person, and instead of finding the same spot</p>
<p>on the skull, we find the same spot on the brain,</p>
<p>and we can stimulate, and we do that every hour on the hour,</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;ve found is that folks will,</p>
<p>within one to five days, in more cases than not,</p>
<p>depending upon if you&rsquo;re looking at this open label</p>
<p>or in trials, somewhere between 60 and 90% of the time,</p>
<p>they will go into full-on remission in the sense</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re totally normal from a mood standpoint</p>
<p>at the end of this, and like I said,</p>
<p>with variable durability, so that&rsquo;s the part</p>
<p>we have to figure out now about dosing</p>
<p>and how to keep people well, but for some people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had four years of remission, a year of remission,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really that cramming of the test.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that idea that you&rsquo;re laying</p>
<p>in that information to the exact right spot,</p>
<p>and the signal&rsquo;s a simple signal, but it&rsquo;s a profound one,</p>
<p>which is turn on, stay on, remember to stay on.</p>
<p>You know, that idea that you&rsquo;re sending this memory signal</p>
<p>into the brain, and you&rsquo;re doing it in such a way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re telling the system, you&rsquo;re kind of taking it</p>
<p>out of the hippocampus&rsquo; hand, your own hippocampus&rsquo; hand,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sending the same signal</p>
<p>the hippocampus normally signals out.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re sending that signal</p>
<p>into the prefrontal cortex, and kind of utilizing</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s own communication style</p>
<p>to get it to get out of the state,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s very cool about this is that people,</p>
<p>when they kind of exit out of that,</p>
<p>they end up saying they don&rsquo;t have any side effects from it,</p>
<p>and they feel back to normal.</p>
<p>Like some people, you know, not everybody,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a subsection of people with SSRIs</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll say, I kind of feel numb,</p>
<p>or I have GI side effects, or I can&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the sexual interest that I used to have,</p>
<p>and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>You know, not anything against SSRIs,</p>
<p>as I said earlier, life-saving, you know,</p>
<p>for a subsection of people, these things really work,</p>
<p>but with this, what you see is that people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk about any of that stuff,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s likely because you&rsquo;re tapping</p>
<p>into that core circuitry, and you&rsquo;re reversing it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing it with a magnet,</p>
<p>that because it&rsquo;s a very profound electromagnet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same field strength as an MRI scanner,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to induce a current in the brain</p>
<p>in this focal, targeted way,</p>
<p>without getting into the rest of the brain,</p>
<p>without getting into the rest of the body at all,</p>
<p>and just really kind of acting only</p>
<p>on that circuitry that&rsquo;s involved.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Is the SAINT study still ongoing,</p>
<p>and if people are interested in potentially being</p>
<p>patients or subjects in the study,</p>
<p>can we provide them a portal link?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>So we have, now the treatment,</p>
<p>some of my students went over to a company</p>
<p>called Magnus Medical, and they&rsquo;ve been working on this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got an FDA clearance now,</p>
<p>and now folks can get it through trials</p>
<p>over the next couple of years,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to take some time for that company</p>
<p>to kind of get up and running and get a device</p>
<p>and get the whole thing set up nationally,</p>
<p>but while that&rsquo;s all going on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still about 1,000 patients</p>
<p>that need to be recruited across a bunch</p>
<p>of different trials all over the country.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take people from anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>We also have partners in New York and San Diego</p>
<p>and soon to be South Carolina and other places</p>
<p>where we can actually, my lab can help</p>
<p>to kind of let people know where to go,</p>
<p>based off of where they&rsquo;re at in the US,</p>
<p>and get them access to being able to be in a trial,</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;ve tried to do is make it so that</p>
<p>even if you get the 50-50 chance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get the real deal,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to get the non-real deal,</p>
<p>but what we have figured out is a way</p>
<p>to let everyone have access.</p>
<p>If they got the not real deal version,</p>
<p>the kind of sham version or the fake version</p>
<p>for the first part of the trial,</p>
<p>there are other trials where they can have access</p>
<p>to the real version, so essentially everybody</p>
<p>eventually gets access to having the real version,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s been a big thing for me</p>
<p>is I want everybody that comes through one of our trials</p>
<p>to be able to have access.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important while the company&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing and what the lab&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>and kind of nationally what other partner labs are doing.</p>
<p>Well, I can assure you, you&rsquo;re going to get some interest.</p>
<p>Happy to have it, yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And listen, thank you so much for taking us</p>
<p>on this incredible voyage through the neurocircuitry</p>
<p>underlying certain aspects of depression,</p>
<p>the coverage of the different types of depression,</p>
<p>the various therapeutic compounds, how they work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about a lot of things today,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve shared so much knowledge,</p>
<p>and even as I say that, I very much want to have you back</p>
<p>to talk about many other things as well</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t have time to cover,</p>
<p>but also just really want to thank you</p>
<p>for the work that you do.</p>
<p>I know we are colleagues,</p>
<p>but you run an enormous laboratory,</p>
<p>enormous in my book, 40 people is a big group,</p>
<p>very big group, plus you&rsquo;re in the clinic.</p>
<p>You also have a life of your own outside of work,</p>
<p>and to take the time to sit down with us</p>
<p>and share all this knowledge</p>
<p>that really is in service to mental health</p>
<p>and humans feeling better,</p>
<p>and in fact, avoiding often suicidal depression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just incredible work and an incredible generosity,</p>
<p>and just thank you so much.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you, man.</p>
<p>I mean, similarly, I want to thank you for what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that what you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of friends,</p>
<p>folks that are not in the medical profession,</p>
<p>friends of mine, one of my buddies</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a real estate agent who works with us,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a big fan of your show,</p>
<p>and I told a couple people like that I was coming on,</p>
<p>and they were super stoked.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we watch every show,</p>
<p>and super excited to watch mine,</p>
<p>and they said something very important to me</p>
<p>that you make this complicated neuroscience</p>
<p>and brain-body science accessible</p>
<p>in a way that few have a gift to do,</p>
<p>and I think that that&rsquo;s so important,</p>
<p>and this show is doing so much</p>
<p>to help with science literacy,</p>
<p>and yeah, appreciate you.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gratified and honored by your statement,</p>
<p>and I look forward to more.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Absolutely, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for my discussion with Dr. Nolan Williams.</p>
<p>I hope you found our discussion</p>
<p>about psychedelics and other compounds,</p>
<p>about transcranial magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>and about the treatments for depression in general</p>
<p>to be as stimulating as I did.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more</p>
<p>about the work being done in Dr. Williams&rsquo; laboratory,</p>
<p>you can go to the Brain Stimulation Laboratory website,</p>
<p>which is bsl.stanford.edu,</p>
<p>and there you have the opportunity to apply</p>
<p>to be in one of the clinical trials for depression</p>
<p>or other studies,</p>
<p>as well, if you&rsquo;d like to support the work being done</p>
<p>in Dr. Williams&rsquo; laboratory</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression</p>
<p>and other psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Not so much today, but in many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep and focus</p>
<p>and hormone optimization.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that the Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus on, you can go to livemomentus,</p>
<p>spelled O-U-S, so livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and there you&rsquo;ll see a number of the supplements</p>
<p>that we talk about regularly on the podcast.</p>
<p>I should just mention that that catalog of supplements</p>
<p>is constantly being updated.</p>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast has now launched a premium channel.</p>
<p>That premium channel will feature monthly AMAs</p>
