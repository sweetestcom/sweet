<p>all his videos are all his musics pretty good</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve really</p>
<p>never really got into him but that one really</p>
<p>grabbed me all right our</p>
<p>guests as always my buddy mr hasty</p>
<p>eddie bravo</p>
<p>eddie bravo of tenth planet jujita</p>
<p>juju zoo of um</p>
<p>you can go to</p>
<p>twitter com</p>
<p>eddie bravo and</p>
<p>where else can i get your shit</p>
<p>you still have a myspace page up with all your music</p>
<p>right yeah but i</p>
<p>think that to eventually</p>
<p>eventually man i&rsquo;m like behind on</p>
<p>every fucking</p>
<p>thing man i got to put out the mastering the</p>
<p>twister dvd</p>
<p>dude i&rsquo;m so behind on everything so um</p>
<p>like musicians are still using myspace</p>
<p>some of them right</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s convenient right yeah it&rsquo;s got that</p>
<p>music player that you could see your</p>
<p>your views or your hits that&rsquo;s pretty important to</p>
<p>music that&rsquo;s super important</p>
<p>if you have</p>
<p>thousands of hits on one of your songs people are</p>
<p>gonna go oh shit let me</p>
<p>check that out</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s four hits</p>
<p>people are just</p>
<p>gonna bypass</p>
<p>right and when you embed</p>
<p>a video you can embed</p>
<p>it with the number of hits in it it can&rsquo;t show</p>
<p>that must be something new i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that no</p>
<p>no no i mean if you embed like a youtube clip</p>
<p>all you see is the window you don&rsquo;t see how many</p>
<p>videos or how many people have</p>
<p>watched this</p>
<p>video no but that would be</p>
<p>a good feature</p>
<p>i think but no one goes on myspace anymore</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m always on my website</p>
<p>tenth planet jj com</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on that</p>
<p>motherfucker like</p>
<p>you know like joe on twitter and shit all day</p>
<p>okay so if they want to see your music though</p>
<p>my music they could still go to myspace com slash</p>
<p>the twister</p>
<p>those are all old videos and shit</p>
<p>that you know like they&rsquo;re like three four years now</p>
<p>old so but they&rsquo;re still badass</p>
<p>brian riker</p>
<p>what are you doing over there</p>
<p>buddy just fine</p>
<p>tweaking the audio</p>
<p>fine tweaking fine</p>
<p>has become quite a podcast mogul</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been broadcasting not just this podcast but</p>
<p>the the unfortunate</p>
<p>brodie stevens project yeah that was did you</p>
<p>watch any of that yeah you</p>
<p>watch a little bit of it</p>
<p>well what was</p>
<p>going and call it that</p>
<p>the unfortunate</p>
<p>brodie stevens</p>
<p>project that&rsquo;s a college play</p>
<p>right he looks like he&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>crazy yeah then that way he&rsquo;s allowed to get</p>
<p>crazy i just</p>
<p>think i need a taser though</p>
<p>you know i think if we do that i need a</p>
<p>taser what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a character you</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s a character</p>
<p>i think it works great for</p>
<p>stand up comedy but i</p>
<p>think for a podcast i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yeah it was hard</p>
<p>cause i felt</p>
<p>bad for the last episode he brought his roommate on</p>
<p>again and he</p>
<p>screamed at his roommate the whole time</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where his roommate i saw look</p>
<p>like close to him and his</p>
<p>cheek was twitching</p>
<p>because he was so</p>
<p>upset and then i went outside</p>
<p>cause i was</p>
<p>freaking out i went outside</p>
<p>and he comes running outside and goes</p>
<p>like in the middle of an interview he just</p>
<p>took off and brody was just left there on the couch</p>
<p>going ah ah ah</p>
<p>well you know i don&rsquo;t know what he was doing</p>
<p>but the guy was like i can&rsquo;t take this anymore</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what to do i can&rsquo;t take this anymore and</p>
<p>like he just got raped</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the conversation was</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when i came to the conclusion</p>
<p>that what happened is is that</p>
<p>they act together</p>
<p>him brodie stevens and his roommate act together</p>
<p>like if a couple were to</p>
<p>break up and they had to live together for like</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>that anger that</p>
<p>anger they had yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man it</p>
<p>freaks me out in</p>
<p>real fucking</p>
<p>anger too man you&rsquo;ve been around someone when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breaking up but they</p>
<p>still haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>moved out yet</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>chick starts seeing</p>
<p>another dude then they have complications or the guy</p>
<p>starts seeing another chick</p>
<p>fuck that shit yeah</p>
<p>that would never happen i</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>put myself to that i mean you have to be a</p>
<p>brokester and understand</p>
<p>or some kind of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with the</p>
<p>least or something</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>least problem that both some people just love</p>
<p>drama fuck they can</p>
<p>never figure it out they can</p>
<p>never figure out how to be cool to each other</p>
<p>from the moment of the relationship but just a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an eventual explosion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like how</p>
<p>how fucked up is</p>
<p>it have to get before it all falls the only way i could</p>
<p>understand a situation like that is</p>
<p>girl breaks up with boy</p>
<p>boy is begging for girl back</p>
<p>girl goes you know what we&rsquo;re not getting</p>
<p>back together but i&rsquo;m fucking staying here for two more</p>
<p>months cause i paid the rent</p>
<p>and boys like fuck it stay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna give them more time to</p>
<p>maybe change your mind you know what i mean</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>could kind of see that when i</p>
<p>broke up i lived with a</p>
<p>chick a long time ago the</p>
<p>first chick i ever</p>
<p>lived with very nice girl but we were both kids</p>
<p>you know i was 21 she was 20 we were both retarded</p>
<p>right and when i</p>
<p>lived with her</p>
<p>and we broke up</p>
<p>there was a period of time for like two weeks we were</p>
<p>still together</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>still like staying in my</p>
<p>house but we</p>
<p>were not together anymore we had broken up so</p>
<p>she had started dating</p>
<p>other dudes</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d started dating other</p>
<p>chicks and you know she</p>
<p>would be cool with it</p>
<p>and then like she</p>
<p>would tell me</p>
<p>about dudes and i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t get jealous but i</p>
<p>would tell her about a</p>
<p>chick and she get mad at me</p>
<p>within two weeks</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s already telling you about</p>
<p>20 years old man 20</p>
<p>years old you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>retarded you don&rsquo;t know what the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on were you in love with her</p>
<p>no i mean probably</p>
<p>not no no no</p>
<p>definitely not because i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>freak out when she left</p>
<p>although i did</p>
<p>like try to get her back</p>
<p>and i came off like a huge faggot</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>that before like when you get devastated by a chick</p>
<p>and then you try to figure out a way to</p>
<p>bring her back it&rsquo;s almost like an ego</p>
<p>thing really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the relationship was boring did she</p>
<p>break up with you yeah yeah yeah she</p>
<p>broke okay that hurts now</p>
<p>how long were you guys</p>
<p>living together before not that long man</p>
<p>it did not last very long it was a disaster six months</p>
<p>maybe something like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not even you can get deep in six yeah</p>
<p>maybe not even</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think it was six months</p>
<p>she was a nice kid we were just</p>
<p>young and stupid</p>
<p>and but she</p>
<p>started banging</p>
<p>other dudes and i</p>
<p>started banging</p>
<p>other chicks</p>
<p>and it was real</p>
<p>weird cause we&rsquo;re living together</p>
<p>and every now and then like she</p>
<p>would get horny and i&rsquo;d fuck her anyway</p>
<p>it was very strange it was like retard retard</p>
<p>relationship shit like</p>
<p>the shit you do when you&rsquo;re 21</p>
<p>usually generally</p>
<p>when someone</p>
<p>breaks up the girl</p>
<p>generally for most people the girl can</p>
<p>has so much more</p>
<p>power than the guy</p>
<p>the girl can</p>
<p>bang ten dudes that day they</p>
<p>broke up like the</p>
<p>guy might not be able to get laid for a couple weeks</p>
<p>right he hasn&rsquo;t been in the game for a</p>
<p>while that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>reason why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breaking up because the guy</p>
<p>found someone new already</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>track in boston</p>
<p>man where i</p>
<p>lived it was</p>
<p>way harder to meet people this is not the same</p>
<p>place man people are not nearly as friendly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not nearly as easy to go</p>
<p>out and meet people like in a bar or club or whatever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking grind</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s in jackets</p>
<p>you really don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re getting man you get a look at girls jeans</p>
<p>how how vacuum sealed are</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>things even</p>
<p>at clubs even at clubs you really can&rsquo;t tell so</p>
<p>some girls can</p>
<p>cover their</p>
<p>fucked up shit with the dresses</p>
<p>you get them</p>
<p>naked you&rsquo;re like whoa fuck</p>
<p>plus they can feel</p>
<p>they confuse you i did not expect</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>like you go out to a club</p>
<p>they got glow</p>
<p>sticks they got glue they got fake fake</p>
<p>eyelashes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drunk it&rsquo;s dark</p>
<p>and they got so much fucking makeup on and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>covering their shit up</p>
<p>strategically they know how to</p>
<p>cover them rolls up how</p>
<p>crazy is the idea of don&rsquo;t wear</p>
<p>nightclub how</p>
<p>crazy is the idea of a nightclub</p>
<p>you go to a</p>
<p>place it&rsquo;s a designated meeting area</p>
<p>where everybody</p>
<p>goes that supposedly is single and wants to fuck</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like can you get it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the big question can you meet</p>
<p>can you meet somebody are you compatible do you get it</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna provide you with</p>
<p>music so you get to move around and</p>
<p>grind against each</p>
<p>other we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna give you</p>
<p>drinks so you make shitty decisions</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna set you up in a</p>
<p>place which probably</p>
<p>gonna be people that are selling drugs if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do something more fucked up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all together in one</p>
<p>big spot and we stay open till 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one place i</p>
<p>never pick up</p>
<p>chicks at though i</p>
<p>never pick up</p>
<p>chicks at the</p>
<p>dance club cause if i&rsquo;m dancing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m acting a fool i&rsquo;m not like taking it serious</p>
<p>like breaking it down</p>
<p>you know what i was totally the opposite like for me i</p>
<p>swear for me</p>
<p>when i was like 21 22</p>
<p>the way i would make moves on a</p>

<p>and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird playing the role</p>
<p>of a superhero at a party</p>
<p>i went to this huge</p>
<p>party and i was</p>
<p>dressed up as spider man</p>
<p>and i realized when i had to walk around the</p>
<p>party i was walking around the</p>
<p>party like i was spider man</p>
<p>like i wasn&rsquo;t just stepping i was</p>
<p>like like i didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose i just what</p>
<p>it was something&rsquo;s</p>

<p>weird man so you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>stoned you thought you were spider well i just</p>
<p>caught myself walking differently</p>
<p>this is the same dude by the way that said that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like certain</p>
<p>video games because now when he sees</p>
<p>buildings he wants to jump from one</p>
<p>building to the</p>
<p>other cause he&rsquo;s played this in games</p>
<p>he actually</p>
<p>thinks that he</p>
<p>could go do that</p>
<p>no no no you</p>
<p>know what you&rsquo;re getting lost in the character</p>
<p>which is totally cool man i was talking about</p>
<p>i played so much of this</p>
<p>particular video game in a</p>
<p>short amount of time</p>
<p>like all day long</p>
<p>it got to the</p>
<p>point where i was driving and i was just like kind of</p>
<p>space out and</p>
<p>think hey look that</p>
<p>building i could jump on that i</p>
<p>could see that you know what i mean</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking of retarded</p>
<p>shit yeah you</p>
<p>never usually want to talk</p>
<p>about but you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about that shit</p>
<p>right like man</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m actually thinking</p>
<p>about the fucking</p>
<p>video game jumping around just because you played it</p>
<p>how many hours straight do you play it</p>
<p>at that time i played it for like all day long i</p>
<p>could wake up play it go to bed</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous yeah</p>
<p>for like a month for a</p>
<p>month though</p>
<p>that was the only time i</p>
<p>became a dick people</p>
<p>do that my little nephew that&rsquo;s his problem</p>
<p>right now they got to take away that fucking</p>
<p>and game controller</p>
<p>cause he plays all fucking days fucking up his</p>
<p>grades and all that shit</p>
<p>and my sister&rsquo;s like oh we only let him have that</p>
<p>video game on weekends and they got</p>
<p>they take the controllers and they fucking hide them</p>
<p>he goes looking for any</p>
<p>breaks into the fucking room</p>
<p>so all they really need to do is have like a</p>
<p>video game controller like</p>
<p>dealer at school right</p>
<p>you have your little sign</p>
<p>plug in how easy is that i&rsquo;m real</p>
<p>lucky that i didn&rsquo;t have</p>

<p>i mean we had like</p>
<p>stupid like</p>
<p>the ones on tv that you&rsquo;d play like</p>

<p>but they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know i think mike</p>
<p>tyson&rsquo;s punch out i</p>

<p>atari the old</p>
<p>space invaders yeah</p>

<p>space invaders at your house</p>
<p>it was amazing</p>
<p>fuck yeah but i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about the sheer addiction</p>
<p>value of it it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>close to the</p>
<p>video games</p>

<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that what was the</p>
<p>monsters versus</p>
<p>aliens that was the animated show that we were</p>
<p>watching that was in 3d</p>
<p>yeah was insane</p>
<p>it was so vivid</p>
<p>and there was so much to it it</p>
<p>was like the</p>
<p>depth was like it was like really shocking</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be pretty soon it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like</p>
<p>where you look at your wall and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking into the next room yeah that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching seinfeld like as if seinfeld was in your</p>
<p>house right</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s gotten this far</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>what it looks like is pretty fucking incredible man</p>
<p>way better than the</p>
<p>movies because</p>
<p>movies a big</p>
<p>what would happen</p>
<p>my shit went</p>
<p>bro we lost</p>
<p>one of the channels for the head</p>
<p>there it goes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s back that&rsquo;s what happened all i&rsquo;m saying is that</p>
<p>you can get more creative</p>
<p>with gay porn</p>
<p>you know we lost loads</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>you got a bad</p>
<p>connection on the headsets</p>
<p>all right so anyways</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in there but what i was saying</p>
<p>is it looks way better than the</p>
<p>movies because movie theaters</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like kind of shitty resolution</p>
<p>it looks like grainy</p>
<p>know even if it&rsquo;s a giants better</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a giant</p>
<p>screen it&rsquo;s not nearly as good as like a</p>
<p>giant like 55 inch plasma screen</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>depth that you get when you look at like a real good tv</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the resolutions like way crispr</p>
<p>did you see jackass in 3d</p>
<p>no that was</p>
<p>using old school 3d</p>
<p>technology it was like dildos coming towards your face</p>
<p>so that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>using depth that was</p>
<p>act they actually slowed down</p>
<p>like things so you could see it come at you</p>
<p>and they really that was the best movie</p>
<p>for the 3d content really awesome for 3d</p>
<p>all i kept thinking about is</p>
<p>i mean there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>fucking some head</p>
<p>trauma going on they&rsquo;re really jacking their heads up</p>
<p>for sure at least one of</p>
<p>those dudes one of those dudes is gonna have</p>
<p>lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease you after watching that show on</p>
<p>brain trauma that</p>
<p>was it real sports yeah what it was yes are you more</p>
<p>aware of that shit oh yeah the whole time i was</p>
<p>watching jackass i&rsquo;m like goddamn it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s all fun and games</p>
<p>right now you&rsquo;re making a lot of money but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really fucking themselves up</p>
<p>i mean i saw the saddest interview with michael</p>
<p>not michael um with</p>
<p>muhammad ali</p>
<p>when he was caches</p>
<p>clay he was talking about retiring</p>
<p>when he got to be</p>
<p>certain age</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t want to be one of them</p>
<p>fighters is</p>
<p>old and been hitting the head too many times is</p>
<p>talking duh duh duh duh</p>
<p>whoa whoa yeah whoa indeed</p>
<p>it was like it was so creepy to listen to that like</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re the king of der der der</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the guy</p>
<p>when if you talk</p>
<p>about anybody where</p>
<p>anybody looks towards</p>
<p>anybody someone getting</p>
<p>damaged you</p>
<p>know from fighting in it being a sad case he&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people that are trying to say that he has</p>
<p>parkinson&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not related the fuck it&rsquo;s not related</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a bullshit</p>
<p>politically correct argument</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>parkinson&rsquo;s what does that mean this means his fucking</p>
<p>brain is falling</p>
<p>apart and why do you</p>
<p>think he has it you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that has to do with the fact that he got</p>
<p>battered in the</p>
<p>brain for like</p>
<p>decades you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that has something to do with that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>they had this</p>
<p>thing on 48</p>
<p>hours with jerry cory</p>
<p>jerry cory was like this great</p>
<p>white hope from the 1970s</p>
<p>and they follow this dude around and he was</p>
<p>like 53 years old when he died</p>
<p>and they followed him around when he was 50</p>
<p>and he was gone</p>
<p>gone there was nothing there</p>
<p>he had no idea what was going on</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>write his name his brother had to help him</p>
<p>write his name so he had lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease he had</p>
<p>everything he had pugilistic dementia that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they call it that&rsquo;s what they were calling it</p>
<p>you know as far as is it lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>what lou gehrig&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>is the same</p>
<p>thing that stephen</p>
<p>hawking&rsquo;s has it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your body loses its ability to move itself there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>things i mean</p>
<p>muhammad ali has parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this guy had</p>
<p>pugilistic dementia</p>
<p>which is just dementia</p>
<p>brought on by being</p>
<p>punched the</p>
<p>whole deal is</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary because we see it</p>
<p>all the time man we see guys getting jacked in the head</p>
<p>all the time you know it&rsquo;s a big part of what we do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real shit yeah so much fun to watch though</p>
<p>thank god there&rsquo;s dudes</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna put their</p>
<p>brains on the line for our</p>
<p>entertainment well it&rsquo;s just they</p>
<p>gotta know when to stop</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing i mean you can do it a few times you</p>
<p>can you can even get shut off a couple of times but you</p>
<p>gotta know when to stop and</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s win is different and that&rsquo;s when it gets</p>
<p>tricky you know no one</p>
<p>could tell you</p>
<p>remember alstar ovary</p>
<p>when he was getting</p>
<p>knocked out all the time</p>
<p>alstar ovary</p>
<p>was getting like</p>
<p>jacked over and over again</p>
<p>sergei carathon</p>
<p>off jacked him chuck</p>
<p>deljak them</p>
<p>a lot of guys stopped him</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s been stopped like</p>
<p>seven or eight times</p>
<p>at least six</p>
<p>so i mean he had been beating up a</p>
<p>bunch of times both in</p>
<p>kickboxing and in you know and in an mma</p>
<p>but then all of a</p>
<p>sudden he makes his fucking</p>
<p>tremendous comeback</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>fighters in the world</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>never say that a dude&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>cause he made</p>
<p>a sick comeback and then made a sick comeback in</p>
<p>striking and k one</p>
<p>you know the fact that he was able to have that kind of</p>
<p>success in just straight</p>
<p>striking i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s pretty goddamn impressive</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t tell you got to stop because i</p>
<p>would have told</p>
<p>alstar over him stop you know who the fuck do you</p>
<p>when do you draw the line is it five</p>
<p>chaos is it four</p>
<p>chaos you know</p>
<p>i think peter</p>
<p>ertz has been stopped some</p>
<p>crazy amount of times like 14 times</p>
<p>over the course of his career</p>
<p>just something nutty like that</p>
<p>damn think about that huh yeah</p>
<p>what if they find out</p>
<p>what if they find cuz jiu jitsu is fairly</p>
<p>new what if they find out that</p>
<p>you know if you get choked out like</p>
<p>unconscious like from a rear naked</p>
<p>choke or a darsh or something like</p>
<p>twenty twenty five times</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re susceptible to get</p>
<p>lewd gehrig&rsquo;s disease just from getting</p>
<p>turn you know but just</p>
<p>getting shut off like that yeah who knows well i</p>
<p>would say that they know that you can be deprived of</p>
<p>blood to the</p>
<p>brain for a</p>
<p>certain amount of time before there&rsquo;s damage set in</p>
<p>but how do they know that</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>know that people have gotten damage because they had</p>
<p>blood shut off to</p>
<p>their brain for</p>
<p>x amount of</p>
<p>seconds or is it a</p>
<p>minute i mean</p>
<p>what is the amount of time</p>
<p>where you start getting</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>remember we talked</p>
<p>about this once</p>
<p>were you saying</p>
<p>like if you really hated somebody</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d choke him out but not to kill him just</p>
<p>hold on for 90</p>
<p>seconds and</p>
<p>be retarded</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a character i wanted to develop</p>
<p>man a guy who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a dexter</p>
<p>you know he just kills people but he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t kill him he just</p>
<p>chokes him out</p>
<p>just for fifty</p>
<p>eight seconds</p>
<p>just to turn him into a vegetable</p>
<p>so he doesn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go down for murder no one knows how this person</p>
<p>became a vegetable and he just</p>
<p>you know make it a romantic comedy</p>
<p>and then like one dude</p>
<p>and the conflict is</p>
<p>after he chokes a girl</p>
<p>he becomes a</p>
<p>lover he does it for</p>
<p>money he&rsquo;s just like the</p>
<p>secret assassin he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not killing anybody he&rsquo;s just turning your enemies into</p>
<p>like you pay him</p>
<p>and then one guy he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>choke long enough</p>
<p>and the guy can kind of talk and he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to bust them out so he has to figure out how to fucking</p>
<p>get near him</p>
<p>again to choke him out of guys like</p>
<p>like pointing out is like</p>
<p>i gotta put this</p>
<p>motherfucker in an</p>
<p>armed triangle one more time but um</p>
<p>but um did you</p>
<p>so that missile</p>
<p>thing a lot of</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know this but there was a missile that was</p>
<p>fired last night</p>
<p>off of the coast of</p>
<p>california california like malibu area</p>
<p>yeah i heard it on carson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>radio show this morning and he said that you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where he lives</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t see anything</p>
<p>and he had all</p>
<p>these whose</p>
<p>radio show carson daly</p>
<p>carson daly</p>
<p>has a radio show</p>
<p>on k rock i</p>
<p>think he does yeah</p>
<p>in the morning</p>
<p>k rock is kevin and bean</p>
<p>i think is he on</p>
<p>after it maybe okay</p>
<p>maybe after but</p>
<p>he was saying that he didn&rsquo;t see anything so he had all</p>
<p>these callers call in</p>
<p>and then it was like</p>
<p>two hours later everyone said they saw something</p>
<p>but not with the time that everyone else is saying so</p>
<p>well they have</p>
<p>pictures of it yeah it is</p>
<p>something happened</p>
<p>there was one</p>
<p>before that happened i remember i was driving</p>
<p>i was in hollywood</p>
<p>and the sky was like it was just turning dusk</p>
<p>you know so it was kind of like half dark half light</p>
<p>and they launched a rocket and you</p>
<p>could really see</p>
<p>whatever this</p>
<p>thing was this missile</p>
<p>you could really see like the contrail behind it and</p>
<p>everything it was pretty dramatic</p>
<p>you know and then they had a you</p>
<p>know tell people that they do</p>
<p>these things at night</p>
<p>and that this one</p>
<p>was from out of</p>
<p>edwards air</p>
<p>force base i guess</p>
<p>and they shot it at</p>
<p>night but it was just not dark enough</p>
<p>they miscalculated the time so people get to see it</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like what do you mean they just</p>
<p>shoot shit up in the air</p>
<p>did they do this</p>
<p>all the time yeah my friend that&rsquo;s in the navy says</p>
<p>they shoot missiles all the time</p>
<p>where do they go</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i probably aim em</p>
<p>to the water</p>
<p>shoot dead missiles and yeah</p>
<p>imagine if you were in a fucking rowboat</p>
<p>and nobody knew you</p>
<p>were out there and you got hit in the head by a missile</p>
<p>just a random</p>
<p>i mean people</p>
<p>have been shot they&rsquo;ve been shot by people</p>
<p>shooting up in the air</p>
<p>right the bullet goes up</p>
<p>in the air and then lands on people that&rsquo;s happened a</p>
<p>bunch of times right</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>if you got hit in the head by a fucking missile</p>
<p>no it out fishing</p>
<p>jones is saying</p>
<p>about this missile</p>
<p>thing or if he even knows</p>
<p>about it oh</p>
<p>what would he say how</p>
<p>would he say</p>
<p>basically the new</p>
<p>world order the</p>

<p>i gotta move my phone</p>
<p>the new world</p>
<p>order the elites</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck</p>
<p>would he say he</p>
<p>would say something</p>
<p>stupid it was obama</p>

<p>where the camera&rsquo;s facing him like directly</p>
<p>joey just stands</p>
<p>right in from it and leans down on one knee</p>

<p>video if you can find the</p>
<p>video anywhere</p>

<p>video it&rsquo;s available online you can see the</p>
<p>whole thing but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna edit it and put together the</p>
<p>right parts in a</p>
<p>whole video of the</p>
<p>whole austin trip</p>
<p>yeah austin</p>
<p>was and always is the shit</p>
<p>every time i go there to film it seems like</p>
<p>magic happens</p>

<p>world man really is</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s also one of the best cities</p>
<p>in the country and if this is the best country in the</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>countries or</p>
<p>cities in the</p>
<p>world i just fuck</p>
<p>that whole thing</p>
<p>dude not only is the</p>
<p>food amazing</p>
<p>everywhere you go the food is fucking amazing</p>
<p>everywhere you go the</p>
<p>women are beautiful</p>
<p>and awesome and nice and love to</p>
<p>party and hang</p>
<p>out there man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a friendly</p>
<p>place there&rsquo;s a few spots like that in this country man</p>
<p>where people are friendlier</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the best ones</p>
<p>austin texas is one of the best ones</p>
<p>fucking great</p>
<p>music one of the</p>
<p>smartest ones too</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>just so many</p>
<p>smart cool interesting</p>
<p>people there it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a fun fucking</p>
<p>place to do</p>
<p>worst highways ever</p>
<p>the gps just</p>
<p>when it tries to find the</p>
<p>exit well for some reason they decided instead of make</p>
<p>their highways</p>
<p>wider they decide to</p>
<p>stack them on top of each</p>
<p>other yeah it&rsquo;s like the the</p>
<p>logic behind</p>
<p>it is so strange and if you make make miss an</p>
<p>exit it&rsquo;s so impossible get the</p>
<p>round about it you fucked you fucked because almost</p>
<p>every exit becomes a new highway</p>
<p>yeah another direction</p>
<p>like where&rsquo;s this one</p>
<p>going yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s death it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death if you</p>
<p>miss a spot you&rsquo;re fucked but</p>
<p>other than that it&rsquo;s the shit</p>
<p>just got was here the first</p>
<p>clip that we got this</p>
<p>classic from austin</p>
<p>was the clam</p>
<p>thing with our</p>
<p>clam they painted that</p>
<p>whole green room too yeah</p>
<p>they redid that whole</p>
<p>place that was sad</p>
<p>they these the</p>
<p>green room in the austin</p>
<p>cap city comedy club used to be</p>
<p>covered with graffiti</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s just all</p>
<p>painted yeah</p>
<p>and it was like</p>
<p>famous comics you know</p>
<p>some comics are dead yeah yeah like i</p>
<p>think mitch hedberg was on there and stuff</p>
<p>and they decided to</p>
<p>paint this green</p>
<p>over it yeah i asked him</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>burger king buy you guys out what the fuck is this yeah</p>
<p>it felt like</p>
<p>ikea or something like this</p>
<p>why would they do that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know that was the biggest fail</p>
<p>ever somebody</p>
<p>should take a</p>
<p>picture of that</p>
<p>green room and just call it fail</p>
<p>well someone</p>
<p>should do is find</p>
<p>photos of it all</p>
<p>online make wallpaper of it and then glue it back on</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve taken most of it what you</p>
<p>should do is enlarge</p>
<p>everything up</p>
<p>high resolution like with some fucking gene hackman</p>
<p>movie type technology</p>
<p>where they can take a big</p>
<p>picture and actually make it look good</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll wait</p>
<p>until like it&rsquo;s lcd wallpaper and i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>email them with a</p>
<p>nice talking</p>
<p>bitch yeah how</p>
<p>could they do that man that was</p>
<p>that place in the atlanta</p>
<p>punch line that&rsquo;s another one the atlanta</p>
<p>punch line the</p>
<p>green rooms just</p>
<p>covered with there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of my favorite ones is stop trying to be hicks</p>
<p>somebody had that as</p>
<p>their avatar</p>
<p>photo on the rogan</p>
<p>board for a</p>
<p>while the best one was</p>
<p>in the austin one was always my favorite and that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing i always think is</p>
<p>pee on the toilet seat</p>
<p>maybe it will keep</p>
<p>women out of comedy</p>
<p>no keep the toilet seat up oh</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll keep</p>
<p>women out of comedy</p>
<p>no i was taking my own life and mixing it in</p>
<p>dude i&rsquo;m not a person that lifts</p>
<p>the toilet seat and pees</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m one of those</p>
<p>guys pee through it i pee through it</p>
<p>cause i grew up with my mom and my sister</p>
<p>and i just use i just wash it</p>
<p>every time what you piss all over the toilet seat</p>

<p>they love the walkie talkie feature</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on verizon yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on all of them you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny story</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this dude in</p>
<p>front of roscoe&rsquo;s chicken and waffles and he was on a</p>
<p>speakerphone and he was talking</p>
<p>by himself just</p>
<p>standing there by himself on a</p>
<p>speakerphone talking</p>
<p>and talking out loud and you can hear his conversation</p>
<p>and so i twittered</p>
<p>i said what is it</p>
<p>about black dudes</p>
<p>that like to talk on the</p>
<p>speakerphones when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re by themselves like what is the deal with that</p>
<p>and all these fucking people got mad at me</p>
<p>a lot of black people got mad at me yo that&rsquo;s dickish</p>
<p>that was dickish</p>
<p>what the whoa whoa whoa</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>shit about you</p>
<p>okay i said what is it with all these</p>
<p>black people that like to talk on</p>
<p>speaker phones</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>black and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that i&rsquo;m not dickish i&rsquo;m just observing</p>
<p>what is that that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>that i don&rsquo;t see that many</p>
<p>white people doing but i see a lot of</p>
<p>black people doing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a negative</p>
<p>thing like what</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking douchey</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>white people do too but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not being</p>
<p>racist here i&rsquo;m observing something</p>
<p>are you saying that i&rsquo;m not allowed to observe because</p>
<p>you share the same melanin</p>
<p>content as this person i&rsquo;m observing</p>
<p>and even though you&rsquo;re not even doing the same</p>
<p>thing that they&rsquo;re doing that&rsquo;s fucking ridiculous</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re real close with</p>
<p>racism in this country man we&rsquo;re real</p>
<p>close to being ridiculous</p>
<p>yeah what is</p>
<p>ridiculous the whole</p>
<p>thing is ridiculous</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>with especially like the whole</p>
<p>anger between</p>
<p>you know like feeling like you have to</p>
<p>fight somebody because of</p>
<p>their race you know like there&rsquo;s people like beating up</p>
<p>different races just because of what race</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s that mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>legit racism but i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about is the opposite i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about people looking to</p>
<p>point the finger at racism</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re really just</p>
<p>acknowledging something that&rsquo;s a fact</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just seeing something i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>what the fact that i said that they happen to be black</p>
<p>yeah well they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t happen to be</p>
<p>black so why do</p>
<p>they do this</p>
<p>black why do</p>
<p>these brothers be doing that</p>
<p>no they just do it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why they do</p>
<p>it but you didn&rsquo;t get an answer no no one has an answer</p>
<p>no but most people</p>
<p>were saying they&rsquo;re attention whores you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you know i guess one of the reasons</p>
<p>why people are getting mad at me as i was saying that</p>
<p>black people are attention wars</p>
<p>which is not what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying i see a lot of</p>
<p>black people that like to talk</p>
<p>on their speakerphone when they&rsquo;re by themselves</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>white people doing it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not doing it</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m asking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like something i see</p>
<p>and might not</p>
<p>allow to see</p>
<p>things because people are black</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tricky fucking</p>
<p>road to walk down that&rsquo;s nonsense you know what</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s because that i</p>
<p>wanna get brain cancer and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>you know more concerned</p>
<p>about it than</p>
<p>white people dude</p>
<p>i know somebody</p>
<p>that does that though i know somebody that only talks</p>
<p>using the speaker</p>
<p>phone function</p>
<p>for some reason yeah but not in public outside no</p>
<p>they do it they do it at</p>
<p>olive garden who is it</p>
<p>are they white</p>
<p>esther does</p>
<p>that oh she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>black or at</p>
<p>least she likes</p>
<p>black deck for sure</p>
<p>why does she do that</p>
<p>i have no idea</p>
<p>i have no idea she records</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>phone call between her and her parents too cause it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that her parents are so</p>
<p>ridiculous but she&rsquo;s just really</p>
<p>weird with her phone</p>
<p>and phone calls that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny man sorry</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>do you really</p>
<p>no just trying to help you out</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a tricky</p>
<p>thing man there was a</p>
<p>white girl at the airport</p>
<p>who is talking her ass off</p>
<p>like just really fucking loud</p>
<p>waiting to get on a plane</p>
<p>and it was kind of</p>
<p>annoying it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>annoying as shit man</p>
<p>you can have</p>
<p>a normal conversation just put that fucking</p>
<p>thing up to you i usually</p>
<p>cover yeah i usually</p>
<p>cover like my</p>
<p>mouth with my</p>
<p>hand i don&rsquo;t want people listening there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>difference between someone sitting there</p>
<p>going hey yeah what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on how you doing</p>
<p>and someone</p>
<p>going yo what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on what you doing okay</p>
<p>and then what happens</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>other person on the other</p>
<p>out thinking we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come down there</p>
<p>all right coo coo</p>
<p>like why do i have to listen to your shit man</p>
<p>this is loud</p>
<p>maybe she just does it around me</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m kind of paranoid that i said that</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m like what</p>
<p>think she does it by herself</p>
<p>maybe i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>she only does</p>
<p>she does it around me a lot maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a security thing</p>
<p>where she once</p>
<p>did like hey i&rsquo;m talking to this person a</p>
<p>guy you know what i mean</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m not hiding</p>
<p>it around me yeah</p>
<p>maybe maybe</p>
<p>wow she&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>i hope you don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>start a trend i</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s being respectful yeah i</p>
<p>should start doing it around her i</p>
<p>guess there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>yeah it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be that though it can&rsquo;t be that because it was</p>
<p>no way we got a tricky</p>
<p>thing in this world</p>
<p>about people being too fucking sensitive</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of two fucking sensitive people that can&rsquo;t take a joke</p>
<p>or even take</p>
<p>a conversation how</p>
<p>about this there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>michelle obama</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s wife is</p>
<p>apparently the center of controversy because she</p>
<p>shook a dude&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s in indonesia and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>muslim dude there</p>
<p>and they were saying</p>
<p>hello you know some</p>
<p>dimit and subdignitaries and she</p>
<p>shook his hand it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>all over the news i&rsquo;m so retarded all over the news</p>
<p>oh wow who&rsquo;s mad she was being nice to somebody</p>
<p>oh yeah the</p>
<p>muslims they&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>their fucking mind i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait oh the</p>
<p>muslims are losing their</p>
<p>ass very upset</p>
<p>i think i pulled it up but</p>
<p>anyway the fucking</p>
<p>story is it&rsquo;s very simple here it is</p>
<p>michelle obama</p>
<p>shakes hands with indonesian information minister</p>
<p>well try saying this dude&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>dharka dharta ti fatu</p>
<p>sember ring</p>
<p>as obama arrived in jakarta in indonesia apparently</p>
<p>conservative</p>
<p>muslim minister in indonesia</p>
<p>who is being criticized for shaking hands</p>
<p>michelle obama thus violating his pious claim</p>
<p>that he avoids contact with women not related to him</p>
<p>as you know as you&rsquo;re supposed to do</p>
<p>some sex of islam what the fuck man two thousand</p>
<p>ten dude this is in the news</p>
<p>some woman shook a dude&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>you know what the fuck man wait he just wanted to touch</p>
<p>get something that&rsquo;s touched obama&rsquo;s dick</p>
<p>you think so yeah he wanted a connection</p>
<p>like a kevin bacon connection to obama&rsquo;s dick</p>
<p>that is what you get if you shake her hand</p>
<p>right yeah you get it all step</p>
<p>away you get it all</p>
<p>get the whole package what would</p>
<p>what if she became president one day michelle obama</p>
<p>that would be fucking awesome</p>
<p>get a chicken there and she&rsquo;s black a black beautiful</p>
<p>that is beautiful</p>
<p>if she could be running shit if she was an</p>
<p>exceptional person to run shit i&rsquo;d be down</p>
<p>you know the thing</p>
<p>about chicks running shit is though they have to be</p>
<p>really good at running shit they can&rsquo;t just be hot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem with this fucking sarah palin</p>
<p>thing is all these faggots out there</p>
<p>that think that she&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>enough to be president because they want to fuck her</p>
<p>i was talking</p>
<p>about this on</p>
<p>stage they think that life is like a fucking kevin</p>
<p>bacon movie</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re the last vote that counts</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>then she finds out that you&rsquo;re the one who got her</p>
<p>elected presidents and</p>
<p>she comes to meet you in an unlikely romance blossoms</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>idiots that</p>
<p>are willing to vote for palin because they really do</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s hot</p>
<p>but i mean look</p>
<p>if you can get some</p>
<p>genius brilliant</p>
<p>woman to be running shit i&rsquo;d be just as</p>
<p>down with that but a dumb</p>
<p>bench no no</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>gonna become president no</p>
<p>palin no ever</p>
<p>well you know what i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>never dude because i would have</p>
<p>never believed she</p>
<p>would have the following that she has</p>
<p>but everyone knows</p>
<p>everyone that has had a tv for the last year and a half</p>
<p>two years have seen</p>
<p>every single skit with her and even if you like</p>
<p>her you have that in the back of your mind only you do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not retarded</p>
<p>did see dude</p>
<p>fifty plus percent of this country is almost retarded</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a giant</p>
<p>number of people that are so fucking dumb</p>
<p>that there could be some</p>
<p>other issue look</p>
<p>how about this jan</p>
<p>brewer chick you know</p>
<p>who she is she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>woman who was</p>
<p>she was made governor</p>
<p>of arizona because</p>
<p>the original governor left and went to</p>
<p>what is her name i forget</p>
<p>went to the</p>
<p>obama campaign anyway</p>
<p>the point is this jam brewer</p>
<p>woman is nuts</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s nuts and old</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t fucking talk</p>
<p>and she goes on</p>
<p>these debates and she paused</p>
<p>she went on debate she&rsquo;s debating with this</p>
<p>other guys running for governor</p>
<p>she paused for 10 seconds</p>
<p>said nothing</p>
<p>just stammering and not knowing what to do and</p>
<p>moving her hands and shit</p>
<p>she had out full brain lock</p>
<p>this bitch lied</p>
<p>about there being dead</p>
<p>bodies on the mexican border with</p>
<p>their heads</p>
<p>chopped off</p>
<p>and then everybody went well</p>
<p>where are the</p>
<p>bodies like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the autopsy reports</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the police reports</p>
<p>and it turns out it was all just</p>

<p>where i get on there and i just promote gigs or</p>
<p>a lot of times i</p>
<p>found like cool shit that i</p>
<p>found online like that</p>
<p>italian song</p>
<p>or that american guy or that</p>
<p>italian guy was</p>
<p>speaking he was singing an american accent</p>
<p>like what it</p>
<p>was like gibberish it wasn&rsquo;t real american word</p>
<p>same talk but what he thought can you find that</p>
<p>here this is what yeah you just i</p>
<p>would love to hear</p>
<p>that you just someone making fun of an american accent</p>
<p>but not really</p>
<p>using words really interesting</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>interesting and it&rsquo;s kind of a cool song</p>
<p>and if you see the</p>
<p>video but i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tweet shit like that or science tweets</p>
<p>that was gonna</p>
<p>tweet something today</p>
<p>they fired up the</p>
<p>large hadron</p>
<p>collider and made thousands of little big bangs</p>
<p>they started doing that man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s become a reality</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really doing it now</p>
<p>nice so they have all these</p>
<p>photos at the cern</p>
<p>lab it&rsquo;s fascinating fascinating fucking shit man</p>
<p>yeah but you know so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that i do and then also like</p>
<p>i treat it like it&rsquo;s a little audience</p>
<p>you know i think you</p>
<p>gotta give people things man</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>to promote gigs and use the internet and shit like this</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just promote</p>
<p>you gotta give them some shit too</p>
<p>like the other day i was</p>
<p>watching ancient</p>
<p>aliens i spent like a</p>
<p>whole hour just</p>
<p>tweeting talking shit on ancient aliens</p>
<p>that show yeah the new</p>
<p>season so bad well the</p>
<p>first season was incredible the</p>
<p>first seasons awesome they ran out</p>
<p>of like talk</p>
<p>about yeah they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to you know</p>
<p>it was it was</p>
<p>crazy all the shit they were saying but</p>
<p>if you look at it this way</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t believe in ufos</p>
<p>then that sounds</p>
<p>ridiculous but if you do believe if you like</p>
<p>watch the disclosure project</p>
<p>and you listen to all the</p>
<p>philip corso&rsquo;s testimony</p>
<p>the guy used to</p>
<p>work for the</p>
<p>we used to be in the pentagon and fucking</p>
<p>head of nuclear energy and europe and all that shit</p>
<p>when you hear his confessions and</p>
<p>like like the</p>
<p>death that confession of general ramey and</p>
<p>and just if you</p>
<p>if you if you believe in ufos</p>
<p>then fucking anything is possible then that means</p>
<p>they must have been here</p>
<p>several times at least</p>
<p>and if they were around during the greek time</p>
<p>they must have</p>
<p>tripped out on them that must have been a big news like</p>
<p>these motherfuckers</p>
<p>and they must have like</p>
<p>talked drew</p>
<p>about i mean</p>
<p>you know painted</p>
<p>about it talked about it</p>
<p>wrote some scripture</p>
<p>about it or something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that far</p>
<p>fetched but</p>
<p>they were coming to some like ridiculous</p>
<p>conclusions like</p>
<p>about like the</p>
<p>paintings in india</p>
<p>maybe this was an alien</p>
<p>well the maha bharata</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fascinating text the ancient text of ancient</p>
<p>hinduism is riddled with stories of flying things and</p>
<p>things that flew through the air</p>
<p>but you also have to realize that</p>
<p>these people took a lot of drugs</p>
<p>these people were into</p>
<p>heavy psychedelic drugs</p>
<p>i mean mana</p>
<p>in the ancient hindu</p>
<p>text they believe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some sort of a combination of psilocybin</p>
<p>mushrooms and a</p>
<p>bunch of other different</p>
<p>things there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of debate</p>
<p>about what mana is</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>clear that they were</p>
<p>referencing something that connected them to the</p>
<p>psychedelic world</p>
<p>and if it was something that connected them to the</p>
<p>psychedelic world</p>
<p>you know and i know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see some shit</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the shit you&rsquo;re seeing is not real</p>
<p>you know when you see that like when people</p>
<p>think of hallucinations</p>
<p>like you think of oh you took a drug and you saw a</p>
<p>monkey that wasn&rsquo;t really there and he you know</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>think of something fake</p>
<p>but what you see</p>
<p>a lot of times when you take</p>
<p>psychedelics drugs</p>
<p>is not like the rest of the</p>
<p>world and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden some new fake</p>
<p>thing shows up</p>
<p>it shows you like a</p>
<p>whole new world</p>
<p>it shows you like a whole</p>
<p>hallucination world</p>
<p>which may or may not be real</p>
<p>you know what what what</p>
<p>might be happening when you take like big doses of any</p>
<p>crazy drug is you</p>
<p>might be tuning into the next door neighbor channel</p>
<p>you know there</p>
<p>might be the</p>
<p>whole world</p>
<p>might be a fucking</p>
<p>radio of a million different channels</p>
<p>and we might be on</p>
<p>you know one o six point four</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a one o six</p>
<p>point five and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right next door</p>
<p>and when you take mushrooms you go there</p>
<p>you know so you know</p>
<p>these guys saying that they you know</p>
<p>saw these flying</p>
<p>things and talk</p>
<p>about all these</p>
<p>majestic beings with all this wisdom</p>
<p>that very easily</p>
<p>could have been drugs very easily yeah it</p>
<p>could be there</p>
<p>could it could be both</p>
<p>i mean just</p>
<p>cause you have</p>
<p>a psychedelic</p>
<p>experience doesn&rsquo;t mean that um</p>
<p>i mean that very</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how much i believe very skeptical about</p>
<p>crafts from another planet that come here that are</p>
<p>metal and the traditional idea of like you know</p>
<p>just doing a</p>
<p>super advanced version of what we already do</p>
<p>i look at that and i go i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so this just seems too silly</p>
<p>it seems too</p>
<p>mechanical a lot of</p>
<p>testimony dude</p>
<p>yeah but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s a lot of testimony people being</p>
<p>raped by demons</p>
<p>you can go back in time and find thousands of people</p>
<p>who but it&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s not exercise yeah but there</p>
<p>these people which try</p>
<p>these people on organizing and getting in</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>washington dc and the national</p>
<p>press and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have credible witness like hundreds of them and</p>
<p>the corso and all</p>
<p>these guys that</p>
<p>like in their</p>
<p>deathbed like you</p>
<p>watch the testimonies like do you think</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>lying okay well no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they are telling the</p>
<p>truth it might mean they&rsquo;re wrong it</p>
<p>might mean that there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>crazy government</p>
<p>experiments that they&rsquo;re not aware</p>
<p>for sure i believe in that i believe there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>a lot of this shit</p>
<p>maybe most of the shit</p>
<p>that people see and report</p>
<p>are our own government making shit but</p>
<p>if you listen to philip corso</p>
<p>testimony he&rsquo;s saying yes</p>
<p>a lot of that shit</p>
<p>is our shit did we</p>
<p>universal say that he saw</p>
<p>things himself</p>
<p>personally exactly yes he did what he was</p>
<p>philip corso was part of roswell right</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t at roswell but he was involved in like the</p>
<p>shipping of</p>
<p>stuff he said he saw the bodies</p>
<p>he said that</p>
<p>he was in charge physically saw them or saw</p>
<p>them physically no no he saw that</p>
<p>he said he opened the coffin</p>
<p>saw him and said oh shit</p>
<p>and he knew so much</p>
<p>that he was in charge of taking</p>
<p>crashed ufo</p>
<p>shit and taking it to this is what he said</p>
<p>taking it to like hughes eric</p>
<p>crawford mcdonnell douglas</p>
<p>getting reverse engineer</p>
<p>the fascinating</p>
<p>story about roswell and everybody</p>
<p>thinks that roswell is a</p>
<p>silly stupid</p>
<p>story and no one knows exactly what happened it</p>
<p>could have been some sort of a soviet</p>
<p>craft that crashed</p>
<p>but the fascinating part is that they flew the</p>
<p>wreckage in two separate planes</p>
<p>because they wanted to make sure if one</p>
<p>plane crashed</p>
<p>they had a good chance that the</p>
<p>other plane</p>
<p>would make it</p>
<p>to wright patterson air</p>
<p>force base and</p>
<p>they made sure they separated the</p>
<p>wreckage there&rsquo;s just so much evidence even like</p>
<p>today with like</p>
<p>the china the shanghai airport</p>
<p>airport in china</p>
<p>closed down</p>
<p>twice within a few</p>
<p>months because there was some shit</p>
<p>right over the</p>
<p>airport they didn&rsquo;t know what it was they shut</p>
<p>everything down</p>
<p>i mean just shit like that</p>
<p>all over the</p>
<p>world i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually is evidence i mean people are put away</p>
<p>for life with no</p>
<p>video no pictures of the</p>
<p>crime just testimony</p>
<p>man they&rsquo;re just listening to testimony</p>
<p>and putting people away for</p>
<p>multiple life sentences</p>
<p>when you put</p>
<p>all the evidence together just look up philip corso</p>
<p>with the sea</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hours and</p>
<p>hours of him just talking</p>
<p>about he wrote a book</p>
<p>about it before</p>
<p>he was the old</p>
<p>motherfucker he was on dateline and shit</p>
<p>i think it even more compelling</p>
<p>one is dr jay allen hynek</p>
<p>exactly was working on project blue book</p>
<p>and he was assigned to discredit</p>
<p>ufo stories</p>
<p>what his job was as he explained it was when he</p>
<p>would hear about something</p>
<p>he would come</p>
<p>up with a reason that it wasn&rsquo;t something else</p>
<p>swamp gas and</p>
<p>swamp gas circular</p>
<p>ball lightning</p>
<p>all this different he</p>
<p>was hired for</p>
<p>that by the government like in the 50s and 60s and then</p>
<p>when project blue book shut down</p>
<p>he dedicated his entire life to</p>
<p>investigating ufos and enlightening people on it</p>
<p>totally and he talks</p>
<p>about it i mean there&rsquo;s interviews he&rsquo;s like i was</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s like a new theory now the new theory</p>
<p>is that the government</p>
<p>wants everyone to believe in ufos</p>
<p>to keep their projects</p>
<p>under wrap like their</p>
<p>black projects</p>
<p>under wrap i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>what was this project blue book and all this stuff</p>
<p>where they were saying that it was</p>
<p>swamp gas they were trying to calm everybody down</p>
<p>why were they</p>
<p>lying i mean</p>
<p>they would have just said yeah</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably from</p>
<p>another galaxy but we don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>we assure you we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do whatever it takes to protect you</p>
<p>if they really</p>
<p>wanted people to believe in the ufos they</p>
<p>would be saying that shit not</p>
<p>covering it up</p>
<p>i mean if you look up</p>
<p>look at the philip corso</p>
<p>testimony look at</p>
<p>look up the disclosure project there&rsquo;s already been at</p>
<p>least two of them</p>
<p>i mean these</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much credible</p>
<p>and like like the</p>
<p>top scientist of europe all got together i forget</p>
<p>what the committees called like international group</p>
<p>they came together in france</p>
<p>and they looked at all the ufo</p>
<p>testimony and all the shit</p>
<p>and they said</p>
<p>fifteen percent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>beans from another galaxy or another</p>
<p>solar system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they said</p>
<p>all of them</p>
<p>could have been explained away</p>
<p>but the fifteen percent</p>
<p>they said hmm</p>
<p>this is probably</p>
<p>the conclusion though why</p>
<p>would they not conclude that it was something from this</p>
<p>earth that we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t discovered yet they</p>
<p>especially when you look at the ocean</p>
<p>well this is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they concluded they concluded that</p>
<p>all the other ship 85</p>
<p>of all the ship</p>
<p>they look that</p>
<p>could be man that</p>
<p>could be man made that</p>
<p>could be this this is probably</p>
<p>some reflection off the sun</p>
<p>15 they said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s most likely</p>
<p>because based on the</p>
<p>pictures and the way</p>
<p>they got some shit from like</p>
<p>satellite pictures of</p>
<p>craft coming from the top down</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>explain they&rsquo;re like man what the fuck is moving</p>
<p>you know that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much weird shit of</p>
<p>things moving and then</p>
<p>changing angles and</p>
<p>changing direction and moving another way the big</p>
<p>the big incident that happened at the</p>
<p>us military installation in the uk</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s eighty</p>
<p>motherfuckers that saw this aircraft</p>
<p>three of them came</p>
<p>up to it as it was park they touched it they took notes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on the disclosure possibly</p>
<p>three of them went up to it</p>
<p>and eighty of them were all around going</p>
<p>holy shit but that&rsquo;s possible that it was a drone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible that it was something from america</p>
<p>and they when they</p>
<p>said it took off and</p>
<p>disappeared</p>
<p>it was gone</p>
<p>well i mean i said if you have a</p>
<p>drone i mean</p>
<p>especially if we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about different alternative sources of power</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>none of those</p>
<p>none of those</p>
<p>motherfuckers and it came back</p>
<p>they sent the guy to look into it</p>
<p>and that guy&rsquo;s in the disclosure project too</p>
<p>like two days</p>
<p>later they sent the guy to calm everyone down</p>
<p>and they came back and they saw it</p>
<p>and these guys are all and</p>
<p>when the military the uk</p>
<p>embassy the ministry of defense</p>
<p>there there when</p>
<p>they came up to him and</p>
<p>asked them what are we</p>
<p>going to do</p>
<p>about this what was that</p>
<p>they go this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t concern national security</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not getting involved</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t secure</p>
<p>and we feel that it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the problem with this whole</p>
<p>story okay you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t there i wasn&rsquo;t there we&rsquo;re just talking</p>
<p>about what we</p>
<p>heard people talking about</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know exactly what went down and</p>
<p>until you talk to</p>
<p>these people you don&rsquo;t know how many of</p>
<p>them are full of shit how many of them are exaggerating</p>
<p>how many of them were traumatized that&rsquo;s why i say</p>
<p>based on the</p>
<p>shit that you see if you actually look into it</p>
<p>and then you make the judgment</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making the judgment damn</p>
<p>you know if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen the testimony</p>
<p>then yeah you don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t know what what he said or</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s all on testimony</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re basing on testimony you don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about these people you</p>
<p>never know how much of it you&rsquo;re getting square if 80</p>
<p>and this is what they said too</p>
<p>they said the response to</p>
<p>the british</p>
<p>ministry of defense saying</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>concern national security we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get involved</p>
<p>then 80 people</p>
<p>fucking hallucinated then</p>
<p>and they got eighty</p>
<p>people eighty</p>
<p>people that are full of shit</p>
<p>they got eighty people</p>
<p>that is neither it means neither that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>if it means that eighty people were not</p>
<p>aware of what they were looking at</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all it means</p>
<p>if military</p>
<p>people they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trained to observe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>military it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>anything if the military people that are in the know</p>
<p>the people that are there at the</p>
<p>scene of the</p>
<p>crime or the</p>
<p>scene of the landing</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>aware of the</p>
<p>technology that&rsquo;s available to the highest</p>
<p>levels of government</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>aware of whatever</p>
<p>experimental</p>
<p>shit they&rsquo;re working on it</p>
<p>might as well be from another planet so what are they</p>
<p>going to say</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>of course of course</p>
<p>nobody knows</p>
<p>nobody was there but</p>
<p>to make a judgment</p>
<p>based on the testimony</p>
<p>you can totally not believe it and go you know what</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>these guys or you</p>
<p>could look at it and say i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna look it with the open mind</p>
<p>fuck eighty dudes that are</p>
<p>trained observers</p>
<p>three went up to it and touched it</p>
<p>they said they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s out of this fucking</p>
<p>world definitely</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re in the military</p>
<p>the british ministry</p>
<p>of defense is fucking not even looking into it at all</p>
<p>mean to die the conclusion</p>
<p>are you yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a</p>
<p>bunch of people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>testament about</p>
<p>something they saw and then you</p>
<p>might not have</p>
<p>known what they were seeing and then you add</p>
<p>all all the shit around that&rsquo;s just one incident then</p>
<p>you look at all of it</p>
<p>you connect all the dots</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>you can make</p>
<p>a decision and my decision</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s some shit going on</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how i feel</p>
<p>based on my</p>
<p>decision is not that at all my decision</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a lot of people with a lot of stories</p>
<p>and we know for a fact</p>
<p>that there are a fuckload of</p>
<p>experimental government aircrafts that they use whether</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re manned</p>
<p>or whether they&rsquo;re remote control</p>
<p>and all these people are just telling</p>
<p>their version of a</p>
<p>story something that they saw</p>
<p>i believe that they saw something i</p>
<p>do not believe that they know it was from another world</p>
<p>so them even saying it was from another</p>
<p>world people want</p>
<p>shit to be romantic</p>
<p>they want shit to be little grey men that come here in</p>
<p>spaceships from palladius</p>
<p>wherever the fuck they&rsquo;re coming from the galaxy</p>
<p>they want that they look for that shit fall in love</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all true</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying but so you don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ufos</p>
<p>what is this believe man you either believe</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s not true that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>that is not true</p>
<p>you do not have to believe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real or something&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>you just go i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only rational explanation yeah but</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say you believe because when you believe you</p>
<p>throw everything else out</p>
<p>the door you say</p>
<p>well this is i believe there are ufos i believe that</p>
<p>aliens have landed</p>
<p>here i don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe we know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re absolutely</p>
<p>convinced and i don&rsquo;t believe so you believe</p>
<p>you believe that philip corso</p>
<p>was a crazy man and he was full of shit</p>
<p>what do you do</p>
<p>as in adding words to what i&rsquo;m saying no i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying that&rsquo;s like 12 year old shit based on</p>
<p>based on what you saw from philip</p>
<p>corps i believe he&rsquo;s out there sucking</p>
<p>cock and take it in the ass and he&rsquo;s doing drugs and</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t even know what he was saying how</p>
<p>about that is that better</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just trying</p>
<p>to of course i was just a guy man i mean he&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>that said he saw some bodies</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>that used to work for the military</p>
<p>is he credible that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting he was</p>
<p>the head of nuclear energy</p>
<p>in europe okay</p>
<p>george bush was the president he&rsquo;s an idiot</p>
<p>does it matter</p>
<p>does it matter like how high he got up there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear to me that the entire government</p>
<p>is riddled with fucking</p>
<p>idiots there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>idiots all over the</p>
<p>place was he an</p>
<p>idiot i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>he seemed like an interesting guy</p>
<p>did he see some shit i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what did he see in</p>
<p>those bodies what were they</p>
<p>who the fuck knows</p>
<p>they might have been mutants</p>
<p>they might have been fucking radiation disasters they</p>
<p>might have been</p>
<p>little children that had a disease</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how much he saw it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>close he got to it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>know how much</p>
<p>information he was really</p>
<p>truly do you</p>
<p>think oj is guilty</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if oj is guilty</p>
<p>or assume he is there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence</p>
<p>two dead people</p>
<p>knives blood in his car it&rsquo;s a little different</p>
<p>than some dude who says he saw ufos</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>so why did they let him free</p>
<p>what the fuck are we talking</p>
<p>about oj for man that&rsquo;s well that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about evidence and testimony and all that stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about the</p>
<p>systems fucked up that&rsquo;s why because</p>
<p>black people thought that it was one on their side</p>
<p>that they were gonna release him</p>
<p>and if did not fit you must have quit</p>
<p>and they wanted to get back at the rodney king verdict</p>
<p>and so they released them that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not to do it ufos</p>
<p>you guys are</p>
<p>like a couple</p>
<p>that broke up and have to live</p>
<p>together careful you have to be careful when you</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>about things that you haven&rsquo;t seen yourself</p>
<p>this is just my opinion</p>
<p>i went the same way with you</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even if it was the most evidence ever</p>
<p>unless i knew for a fact i saw it with my own eyes</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s too much bullshit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t follow anything</p>
<p>why stress out</p>
<p>about it there&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>much bullshit there&rsquo;s too many people are full of shit</p>
<p>too many people exaggerate too many people</p>
<p>twist the truth</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a big business in talking</p>
<p>about ufos and that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing to be careful of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a gigantic business in writing books</p>
<p>about this shit</p>
<p>and doing lectures and seminars</p>
<p>and these guys make a fucking good living</p>
<p>traveling the country selling books</p>
<p>and talking about ufos</p>
<p>whenever you involve commerce in a very strange</p>
<p>discussion like the</p>
<p>discussion of the potential</p>
<p>reality of intelligent life from</p>
<p>other planets</p>
<p>whenever you involve</p>
<p>money in that and money</p>
<p>in the stories</p>
<p>i mean then</p>
<p>it becomes like sort of a faction of show business</p>
<p>i mean whitley streeber</p>
<p>is one of the fucking</p>
<p>biggest proponents of the</p>
<p>alien abduction story and</p>
<p>wrote books on it communion and had</p>
<p>movies made about it</p>
<p>and that guy</p>
<p>is a fucking book writer he</p>
<p>writes books</p>
<p>he makes fiction</p>
<p>he makes fiction</p>
<p>and he created this</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>about getting</p>
<p>abducted by ufos and everybody took it as fact and</p>
<p>man who the fuck knows if it&rsquo;s fact</p>
<p>you got a guy who&rsquo;s a professional fiction man</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in his head</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no evidence it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there may be ufos</p>
<p>absolutely there may be</p>
<p>there may be intelligent life from</p>
<p>other planets</p>
<p>absolutely there may be</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t just jump on yes</p>
<p>because you jump on</p>
<p>yes who did i did i just jump on yes you jumped on yes</p>
<p>did i didn&rsquo;t jump on yes you</p>
<p>said you know</p>
<p>how much research i fucking</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m obsessed with ufos i do a lot</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t just jump on it</p>
<p>i listen to</p>
<p>a lot of tell you said you but i didn&rsquo;t just jump</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just jump on it like you&rsquo;re making it seem like but you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t like i</p>
<p>heard one testimony</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m saying you</p>
<p>look if you listen to what i said what i said was that</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re experiencing it yourself</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know exactly what happened</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about people that are talking about</p>
<p>crafts that they</p>
<p>think were from another world</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where it really came from and that gets very very</p>
<p>tricky and if you choose to believe or not to believe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re jumping on one side or another</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ufos i think everyone&rsquo;s full of shit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re jumping on no</p>
<p>and if you say i do believe i believe you&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re jumping on yes</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s a lot of what you</p>
<p>think is evidence</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re seeing it yourself</p>
<p>unless it has been proven which it</p>
<p>clearly hasn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clearly up for debate</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of people that come forward</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s a hundred</p>
<p>or a thousand and they say they have</p>
<p>crazy stories</p>
<p>about things that move too fast</p>
<p>who the fuck knows what that is</p>
<p>who knows okay</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t believe in your foes wow wow</p>
<p>dude are you are you kidding you kidding you&rsquo;re kidding</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m not kidding</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying that i don&rsquo;t believe in ufo</p>
<p>okay what i you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we no one knows not</p>
<p>us no man you don&rsquo;t know no that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying believe when you believe something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know for like</p>
<p>based on the evidence</p>
<p>i believe there&rsquo;s some shit</p>
<p>going on i with other</p>
<p>galaxies and other</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i possible</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s life on</p>
<p>other planets</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly possible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also possible that life is a dream</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also possible</p>
<p>that your life is imagination and you&rsquo;ve made it all up</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m a figment of your imagination and each player</p>
<p>is in your life to provide you with</p>
<p>some information and try to help you and move you along</p>
<p>in a certain</p>
<p>way it&rsquo;s very possible that this life is not even real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m in your imagination and your in mind and we</p>
<p>self create</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different possibilities</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>but whether or not there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ufos because some people that you don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never met saw some</p>
<p>things that you</p>
<p>never saw and said they</p>
<p>wrote it down and had conferences and</p>
<p>discussions about it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know about that</p>
<p>do you guys like sweet potato fries</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tricky thing man</p>
<p>we attach ourselves</p>
<p>to what we believe in</p>
<p>and you obviously</p>
<p>are getting</p>
<p>attached to this idea of ufos being real because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>spent so much time</p>
<p>and invested so much time being fascinated by it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fascinated with i&rsquo;m fascinated with</p>
<p>the testimony</p>
<p>and putting it all together i am too you&rsquo;re making it</p>
<p>sound like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like mystically no i&rsquo;m not man i&rsquo;m not making it</p>
<p>sound like that i am</p>
<p>saying exactly what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>but i am fascinated by people</p>
<p>and i know that people are full of shit</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>assuming that all</p>
<p>these people are pious</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not assuming that all</p>
<p>these people are</p>
<p>completely honest</p>
<p>and without</p>
<p>ulterior motive</p>
<p>and telling exactly that you know as they saw the</p>
<p>truth i&rsquo;m not seeing that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m seeing a</p>
<p>bunch of believers</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>even if you saw something fucking</p>
<p>completely insane</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want you telling me you know what it is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want you describing it that way</p>
<p>i want you saying i don&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>i want you to say i think</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>could have been some sort of a</p>
<p>craft that i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>aware of it</p>
<p>could be that&rsquo;s what ufo means man an</p>
<p>identified flying object</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re not saying</p>
<p>ufo you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>aliens right</p>
<p>yes well i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>aliens i&rsquo;m saying unknown</p>
<p>okay and when someone says they know and they</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>about it being from another planet</p>
<p>bitch do you</p>
<p>have like some fucking serial numbers you can</p>
<p>track back to this planet</p>
<p>like how do you know</p>
<p>where it came from you don&rsquo;t know shit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just taking a</p>
<p>guess they see something in the sky</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t build it must be from space</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s that simple</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that simple man like i kept</p>
<p>it i could be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that simple it is that simple if you want to</p>
<p>claim you know</p>
<p>where it came from man okay</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t know you can&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>no one saying they know</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where it came from you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>video of it</p>
<p>fucking flying off that planet and landing here</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking guesswork</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a romantic idea the idea seems so cool</p>
<p>the idea that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>aliens tricky</p>
<p>because you get sucked into it like it seems so awesome</p>
<p>so does the loch</p>
<p>ness monster</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like we have this</p>
<p>built in shit in our head that&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>like the loch ness</p>
<p>monster man the loch</p>
<p>ness monster is like</p>
<p>a bigfoot not</p>
<p>noel bigfoot is a real animal</p>
<p>you know they have isolated an animal</p>
<p>called gigantopithicus</p>
<p>that they believe</p>
<p>if human beings came down the bering strait</p>
<p>and they came from asia</p>
<p>gigantopithicus</p>
<p>lived in asia as recently as ten thousand years ago</p>
<p>it was a bipedal</p>
<p>primate that was</p>
<p>eight to ten feet tall</p>
<p>so you believe</p>
<p>in bigfoot it&rsquo;s an animal</p>
<p>whether or not believe people see it</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>fuck knows man there was woolly mammoths and</p>
<p>saber tooth</p>
<p>tigers here</p>
<p>10 000 years ago</p>
<p>seven foot tall</p>
<p>giant fucking birds</p>
<p>like a few hundred thousand years ago</p>
<p>there was animals on this planet in this continent</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t exist anymore that were pretty fucking</p>
<p>crazy saber true</p>
<p>tigers are crazier</p>
<p>than bigfoot</p>
<p>bigfoot&rsquo;s just another big monkey</p>
<p>if bigfoot was gigantopithecus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just another</p>
<p>large primate that went extinct</p>
<p>where is bigfoot supposed to be living</p>
<p>pacific northwest</p>
<p>which is if you follow the</p>
<p>traveling down the bering</p>
<p>strait which</p>
<p>is where indians came here</p>
<p>american indians originated</p>
<p>in siberia and asia and</p>
<p>they came down from there</p>
<p>america what people don&rsquo;t realize is 10 000 years ago</p>
<p>half of america was</p>
<p>under a mile high</p>
<p>sheet of ice</p>
<p>this was covered in ice this was like a barren land</p>
<p>but something</p>
<p>dramatic happened to the environment of the earth</p>
<p>and the ice</p>
<p>age when it ended</p>
<p>the america opened up and that&rsquo;s when people</p>
<p>started moving here</p>
<p>when people some of the people had already</p>
<p>moved here there was</p>
<p>they found chinese</p>
<p>bodies here from 10 000 years ago</p>
<p>but when people</p>
<p>started moving here</p>
<p>they came from there they came from the bering</p>
<p>strait that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the number one theory of</p>
<p>a big percentage of the american indians</p>
<p>so they came down from asia</p>
<p>and this monkey</p>
<p>lived in asia</p>
<p>and if this</p>
<p>thing followed them</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>knows is there any compelling evidence for loch</p>
<p>ness monster</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s pictures</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s scans from</p>
<p>radar they think it</p>
<p>could be a big fish that</p>
<p>could have got landlocked that was extinct in</p>
<p>other places but not there</p>
<p>the problem with loch ness is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really murky</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t see and it</p>
<p>could be a bunch of other</p>
<p>things it could be a</p>
<p>bunch of other</p>
<p>things that people are misconstruing</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>bunch of hoaxes</p>
<p>but when enough people have seen</p>
<p>things you got</p>
<p>to wonder what the fuck is it is it an eel</p>
<p>is it we got to</p>
<p>think of all the animals that are real</p>
<p>you know is it a dolphin it&rsquo;s probably mostly</p>
<p>floating wood and just people knowing the story and</p>
<p>going oh there it is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more evidence for bigfoot</p>
<p>or loch ness monster</p>
<p>probably bigfoot</p>
<p>because bigfoot there&rsquo;s the american indians that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big part of the lore of bigfoot there&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>250 american indian names for bigfoot</p>
<p>bigfoot was born</p>
<p>in the imagination of</p>
<p>an american indian that just</p>
<p>might have made attention</p>
<p>it might have been 20</p>
<p>what&rsquo;d you say</p>
<p>bigfoot was born in the head</p>
<p>of an american indian that was just wanting attention</p>
<p>you imagine</p>
<p>one dude came up with that and</p>
<p>spread probably</p>
<p>that happened and</p>
<p>every all the other ones is somebody hearing that same</p>
<p>story and just being paranoid</p>
<p>walking through the woods later</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like other tribes</p>
<p>other tribes with like these fucking</p>
<p>costumes like</p>
<p>bear costumes the most compelling evidence</p>
<p>about bigfoot is actually the</p>
<p>audio tapes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these</p>
<p>audio tapes of</p>
<p>these crazy primate howls</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve recorded in the pacific northwest</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really fucking loud</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really loud and interesting</p>
<p>and these have been done</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>supposedly by</p>
<p>legit scientists</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve recorded</p>
<p>these sounds</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>could be somebody let a monkey</p>
<p>loose they had a</p>
<p>crazy pet monkey</p>
<p>and they let that</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>loose and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>screaming in the woods</p>
<p>if we put you in the woods you</p>
<p>could make up some</p>
<p>sounds that they would</p>
<p>think of his bigfoot in luckness and outsourced baby</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the worst conspiracy</p>
<p>theory like the</p>
<p>worst one flat earth</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>that are on</p>
<p>earth is flat to the</p>
<p>young earth that&rsquo;s another bad one no no no no like</p>
<p>today people don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>young earth</p>
<p>yeah they believe the</p>
<p>young earth yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big percentage of the christian population</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy on twitter i follow him all the time</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s this crazy retarded</p>
<p>christian young earth guy</p>
<p>who is always talking</p>
<p>about the evidence</p>
<p>against evolution</p>
<p>these youtube</p>
<p>videos are just you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch them for more than five minutes because the</p>
<p>insanity radiates off the</p>
<p>screen and it</p>
<p>starts to get you</p>
<p>blonde hair cute lips</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really nice yeah he&rsquo;s hot</p>
<p>they believe that the</p>
<p>earth is less than ten thousand years old</p>
<p>a lot of people more than</p>
<p>fifty percent</p>
<p>during a recent gallup poll in the united states</p>
<p>believe that the</p>
<p>earth is the</p>
<p>age that&rsquo;s depicted in the bible</p>
<p>which is less than ten thousand years old they probably</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know what that is there&rsquo;s gone did the</p>
<p>bible say that yeah it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>bible probably</p>
<p>yeah like what</p>
<p>does jesus think</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s all they have to hear</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>dumbass conspiracy</p>
<p>theories bigfoot&rsquo;s not the dumbest one bigfoot</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>animal that they can lock that to it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s one the jersey</p>
<p>devil some fucking</p>
<p>giant monster that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>half the one</p>
<p>of the chippacabra yeah the</p>
<p>texas one well the two</p>
<p>chupacabra they&rsquo;ve narrowed that down too they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s mange</p>
<p>mange on coyotes</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve had dead coyotes</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve shot and killed that were</p>
<p>covered in mange</p>
<p>dude they don&rsquo;t even look real</p>
<p>they look like</p>
<p>monsters they&rsquo;re zombie coyotes they</p>
<p>look like ghouls they lose all their hair</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a common disease</p>
<p>and they have</p>
<p>photos there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>photos of them online if you look chupacabra</p>
<p>they have a headless</p>
<p>one they chopped its head off and it&rsquo;s a coyote</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a coyote that horrible</p>
<p>mange and it has</p>
<p>almost blue dark</p>
<p>bluish blackish skin</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s no hair</p>
<p>and it looks like a</p>
<p>monster so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most likely the origin of a chupacabra</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>that killed goats and shit and killed chickens</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what coyotes do</p>
<p>you know so they have that narrowed down</p>
<p>you know i was at the zoo this weekend man</p>
<p>and i saw a</p>
<p>leopard they had a</p>
<p>leopard there</p>
<p>and that it was so sad</p>
<p>leopards just pacing around just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get to jack anything</p>
<p>just pacing look at all</p>
<p>these people staring out</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>started to find</p>
<p>leopards in america bro really</p>
<p>leopards have made</p>
<p>their way to phoenix</p>
<p>wow yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>leopard sightings in arizona</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re coming up through</p>
<p>south america</p>
<p>and through</p>
<p>mexico and into america fucking</p>
<p>leopards bro</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty good</p>
<p>leopards are no joke</p>
<p>could you imagine if you were like the</p>
<p>first american to get jacked by a leopard</p>
<p>i would love it</p>
<p>would you they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to check</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be leopard hunting</p>
<p>season and those</p>
<p>motherfuckers will be</p>
<p>wiped out do you</p>
<p>think so man is</p>
<p>they try to go into</p>
<p>texas yeah texas</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even have to open up a hunting</p>
<p>season in texas</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>start shooting them</p>
<p>the kids will</p>
<p>shoot them yeah</p>
<p>who were we talking</p>
<p>about the other day that was jogging</p>
<p>and they shot</p>
<p>something and they had a</p>
<p>and you were more amazed that they had a gun</p>
<p>while they were jogging somebody was telling us a story</p>
<p>yeah who the fuck told us that what was that</p>
<p>shit that sucks i thought you would</p>
<p>never mind didn&rsquo;t they do that in colorado</p>
<p>when you live there</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you jog</p>
<p>with you had to have a gun</p>
<p>right i carried a gun yeah i did yeah</p>
<p>they have like</p>
<p>jogging holsters you know</p>
<p>i carried a gun</p>
<p>every time i went hiking</p>
<p>fuck you you jog</p>
<p>with a fucking</p>
<p>rifle behind you yeah dude</p>
<p>the last thing you</p>
<p>wanna do is be</p>
<p>out there by yourself</p>
<p>with your family in a fucking predator attacks</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have a gun</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s somebody that wants your daughters</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so easy to</p>
<p>shoot things</p>
<p>you know you have a gun you put it in your pocket</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>crazy technology</p>
<p>you have this little</p>
<p>thing in your pocket that can protect you</p>
<p>you know what are the odds of that</p>
<p>you gotta use that shit i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>thinking really hard</p>
<p>about getting</p>
<p>a gun lately let me and like there&rsquo;s two of my</p>
<p>friends that were both saying like they just called me</p>
<p>randomly like hey you want to get a gun</p>
<p>i think it was</p>
<p>duncan or somebody better to have it and not to need it</p>
<p>the need it not to have it</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t control</p>
<p>these people it&rsquo;s almost living out in the</p>
<p>wilderness like you did</p>
<p>we talked about this before it&rsquo;s a lot like</p>
<p>you know no matter</p>
<p>where you go you got to deal with some</p>
<p>death either you live</p>
<p>in the city</p>
<p>you got to deal with muggers and rapists</p>
<p>or like gang bangers or something</p>
<p>or you live</p>
<p>way out away from that shit no gang bangers are</p>
<p>going out into that wilderness</p>
<p>but then you got to deal with mountain lions and</p>
<p>shit like that deal with</p>
<p>things and you</p>
<p>gotta deal with</p>
<p>weird people but at</p>
<p>least you can</p>
<p>shoot them and you&rsquo;re cool</p>
<p>like you could just look at them and go bam and just</p>
<p>blast them you can&rsquo;t do that to a mugger</p>
<p>until he jumps on you</p>
<p>gotta be careful</p>
<p>with bears because bears aren&rsquo;t hard to kill</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to kill a bear with a pistol</p>
<p>you know if you got a bear you&rsquo;re better off</p>
<p>shooting what</p>
<p>about bear mace</p>
<p>that works yeah</p>
<p>you gotta get him with it though they</p>
<p>gotta be close enough</p>
<p>for you to get him with it i didn&rsquo;t even know bear mace</p>
<p>existed until</p>
<p>south park would</p>
<p>barry&rsquo;s gotta</p>
<p>be careful oh was he</p>
<p>he thought he was the bounty hunter that was</p>
<p>in you know the</p>

<p>the mountains</p>
<p>above denver</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one town called evergreen that i really liked</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>south park is that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s based on</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re actually from like denver</p>

<p>whole life to fucking</p>
<p>tracking these</p>
<p>things down and trying to find out what the fuck</p>
<p>these things were</p>
<p>there were mods</p>

<p>it was a video camera artifact</p>
<p>that when something</p>
<p>moved too quickly too</p>
<p>close to the screen</p>
<p>it stretched the</p>
<p>image out so it made the image</p>

<p>let me type what he</p>
<p>got his name</p>
<p>because he had like another thing</p>
<p>that was like another theory</p>
<p>about something else and then someone on the message</p>

<p>and that&rsquo;s who he is from now on</p>
<p>i uh</p>
<p>oh lunar rising oh here he goes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got some shit</p>
<p>about the moon</p>
<p>he changed yeah he</p>
<p>thinks there&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>anomalies on the moon now okay here he goes the true</p>
<p>color of the moon</p>
<p>for over fifty years we have</p>
<p>been told and convinced the moon is nothing more than a</p>
<p>black and white desolate rock</p>
<p>with moon dust and</p>
<p>craters the thousands of</p>
<p>photos released to the public have always presented</p>
<p>a black and white moon</p>
<p>even with the most recent hubble</p>
<p>photographs</p>
<p>of the moon</p>
<p>are black and white</p>
<p>nasa continues to perpetuate the lie</p>
<p>that in quotes</p>
<p>that the moon is</p>
<p>black and white this</p>
<p>motherfucker&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy same dude from</p>
<p>rocks yeah yeah</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like damn he</p>
<p>switched over</p>
<p>snakegoyle over</p>
<p>snakegoyle over there oh he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>bunch of spots that he says oh my god this is hilarious</p>
<p>does he believe that the moon landing was a hoax oh no</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s showing is craters</p>
<p>and he believes that these</p>
<p>craters are</p>
<p>different alien artifacts</p>
<p>and these craters like oh there&rsquo;s such a stretch</p>
<p>like the photos are such a stretch</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like thinks that these</p>
<p>structures are artificial</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fucking</p>
<p>craters man</p>
<p>shit got smashed by rocks from space</p>
<p>you know sometimes little</p>
<p>shapes come out of that</p>
<p>you fucking dummy did</p>
<p>you see the moon on conan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>set last night on</p>
<p>his first episode no how was the</p>
<p>first episode did you</p>
<p>watch it yeah</p>
<p>it felt really cheap</p>
<p>like you know how you watch</p>
<p>the nbc show it felt like the</p>
<p>furniture was high quality it felt like</p>
<p>those were real</p>
<p>plants behind them it felt like a good backdrop</p>
<p>this felt like</p>
<p>they got everything at fucking</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know sears</p>
<p>outlet you know</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>and in like the</p>
<p>background was this horrible blue</p>
<p>painting that just looked really</p>
<p>cheap and generic and then there</p>
<p>was this moon in the middle of it that was kind of cool</p>
<p>and i guess it</p>
<p>moves it moves</p>
<p>but it just looked like the</p>
<p>whole thing look like low</p>
<p>budget and it was it the real moon</p>
<p>or a fake moon</p>
<p>no fake man totally fake moon</p>
<p>but just look really low</p>
<p>budget and i don&rsquo;t know i was okay he had seth</p>
<p>rogen on last</p>
<p>night and listen how gay you are you looking at the set</p>
<p>the set was</p>
<p>i mean like</p>
<p>i was a fan of the show i was a real</p>
<p>it was it a real moon or a fake moon</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t comment on the furniture</p>
<p>i was a real fan of the show in</p>
<p>like a lot of the reviewers of that you know the like</p>
<p>newspapers and stuff that</p>
<p>reviewed it</p>
<p>you know they had made up an interesting</p>
<p>point it&rsquo;s like why are you</p>
<p>focusing like on a tenth of</p>
<p>variation of</p>
<p>the tonight show you know</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not being your own show you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>like the tonight show in a version of the tonight show</p>
<p>you have this new opportunity why don&rsquo;t you fucking</p>
<p>throw that desk out a window</p>
<p>and fucking do something you know</p>
<p>yeah people like that desk</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that funny</p>
<p>that you like having people on</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it better to do it like this</p>
<p>where you just like this is like</p>
<p>if we were here</p>
<p>i mean we have a</p>
<p>table so we have our laptops and shit in</p>
<p>front of us but we do have kind of a desk though</p>
<p>yeah but just to put shit on yeah they don&rsquo;t see the</p>
<p>desk they don&rsquo;t see the desk yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a pencil and a</p>
<p>piece of paper now</p>
<p>huh yeah but</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>our viewers don&rsquo;t see that the desk</p>
<p>well i mean he i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s cool that he has notes and</p>
<p>everything but they</p>
<p>could put that on a teleprompter i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s some security to the desk</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been there forever</p>
<p>just in case you get boners when pamela</p>
<p>anderson from</p>
<p>ten years ago is on yeah</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t look cool</p>
<p>you got nervous when you&rsquo;re seeing pamela pamela</p>
<p>look at her boobs</p>
<p>how about they just</p>
<p>sit there on</p>
<p>stage no desk</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re on a big lazy boy</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they just</p>
<p>and they got a headset on</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to be too lazy though because that conversation</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be interesting why don&rsquo;t conan just have a cool</p>
<p>house and like</p>
<p>invite some cool people</p>
<p>over you know and just hang out that&rsquo;s actually good</p>

<p>check out my</p>
<p>garage just hang out in the garage and talk about your</p>
<p>movie with your</p>

<p>problem is that a lot of people like to be in</p>
<p>the audience and they like to have an audience there it</p>
<p>makes the comedy</p>
<p>play 200 people are sad</p>
<p>invite the 200</p>
<p>people via skype</p>

<p>right that&rsquo;ll work</p>
<p>you know john</p>
<p>heffron&rsquo;s doing like comedy shows through skype</p>
<p>something like skype it&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>form of video comedy</p>
<p>technology but</p>
<p>he sits in a room</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>screens around him and he&rsquo;s like performing for all</p>
<p>these other people that are in the</p>
<p>room with him yeah it&rsquo;s pretty cool shit it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>incredible i hope that catches them</p>
<p>not in front of an audience no he&rsquo;s doing some</p>
<p>corporate gigs</p>
<p>where he does them on a desk</p>
<p>and the desk there&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s cameras that come</p>
<p>at him can you hear</p>
<p>laughter yes they hear</p>
<p>everything they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>connected everyone&rsquo;s conference called up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like you know 50 100 how</p>
<p>crazy i mean he&rsquo;s sitting there by himself</p>
<p>in front of a laptop</p>
<p>and then there could be</p>
<p>fucking the whole</p>
<p>world listening</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>could hear all their</p>
<p>laughter can you imagine that a shower like you have a</p>
<p>stereo system</p>
<p>well he said it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>crazy because you</p>
<p>could see when you set it up you can see all</p>
<p>these people in</p>
<p>front of you like</p>
<p>see them sitting like there&rsquo;s not just one</p>
<p>screen there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>dozen screens in</p>
<p>front of them and they sees all</p>
<p>these people in</p>
<p>front of them yeah</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s almost like an audience yeah whoa</p>
<p>yeah what was</p>
<p>these audiences</p>
<p>at the shower ring convention you know</p>
<p>yeah man i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not real interested in talk shows you know like when i</p>
<p>heard about it i was like you know i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna really</p>
<p>watch it it&rsquo;s like a podcast</p>
<p>you know but it&rsquo;s not cause it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seven minutes and all they&rsquo;re doing is talking</p>
<p>about their moves</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about their i mean how</p>
<p>often does someone have a really interesting story</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not usually most of time they just pimp in</p>
<p>their shit you know they&rsquo;ll have a little</p>
<p>you know so what&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going on we recently had our</p>
<p>second baby see</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because you lay in bed and you&rsquo;re kind of like</p>
<p>watching the news kind of</p>
<p>you know like it&rsquo;s like the news but you know</p>
<p>mixed with humor</p>
<p>right now so it&rsquo;s kind of more just like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch it if it was like 8 p</p>
<p>m you know right</p>
<p>i mean i like them i mean they&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t go out of my way to see him i prefer</p>
<p>i prefer the john stewart show honestly i</p>
<p>think that the</p>
<p>daily show the way he does it</p>
<p>is the best</p>
<p>way he has a lot of shit that he fucks around with</p>
<p>like his his</p>
<p>monologues and his like making fun of</p>
<p>things in the</p>
<p>news even though it&rsquo;s all political for the most part</p>
<p>i think he hits the mark more than anybody he makes me</p>
<p>laugh out loud</p>
<p>more than anybody</p>
<p>did you guys already talk about</p>
<p>the golfer gonakis</p>
<p>weed smoking incident</p>
<p>on the john story no</p>
<p>no we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know what happened yeah yeah he smoked pot</p>
<p>he pulled out a joint</p>
<p>it was actually a bill marshall</p>
<p>oh it was yeah it wasn&rsquo;t john stewart no</p>
<p>it was okay</p>
<p>it was a real time</p>
<p>but you know then the</p>
<p>executive said that it wasn&rsquo;t real pot that it was a</p>
<p>prop okay they had to say it</p>
<p>yeah but why do they have</p>
<p>to say it why do they have to say it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the kids</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>first podcast we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>since proposition 9 did not pass 19 rather did not pass</p>
<p>you know and so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of shit</p>
<p>going on right now in this country</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of shit</p>
<p>going on with pot and disinformation and people</p>
<p>thinking that somehow or another</p>
<p>if you yet you have pot</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more accessible that it is now that the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s gonna fall</p>
<p>apart it&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>i never thought</p>
<p>when i was a little kid that we&rsquo;d be here in now</p>
<p>2010 and this would</p>
<p>still be up for debate</p>
<p>yeah but you</p>
<p>also know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never going to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna pass that easily</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s like an iphone app one single button all</p>
<p>these people instead of having to register</p>
<p>and then go get fucking</p>
<p>take off work or go towards your</p>
<p>lunch and vote</p>
<p>you have to do that</p>
<p>otherwise would be too much</p>
<p>fraud yeah but you know in like ten years they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna figure it out it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be on your fucking pagers</p>
<p>maybe but maybe there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>some incentive</p>
<p>to keep it complicated because the more complicated</p>
<p>the less people</p>
<p>vote and the more</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s political aficionados that are in the mix</p>
<p>instead of just the casual person i knew that was</p>
<p>gonna happen though</p>
<p>did you i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shocked at all it was just like gay</p>
<p>marriage you know</p>
<p>you thought that was</p>
<p>gonna pass but then</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shocking to me man when the polls are right</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m like how the</p>
<p>you know who the fuck answers polls</p>
<p>do you have</p>
<p>you ever answered a poll</p>
<p>polls like online</p>
<p>yeah or if anybody called you up and</p>
<p>you talk to them or yeah yeah all the time i do polls</p>
<p>do you really yeah and like if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>tmz and is like does</p>
<p>you know mel gibson&rsquo;s butt look fat yes or no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to take the</p>
<p>extra click to see no just to see what the</p>
<p>the answers are</p>
<p>really yeah don&rsquo;t you no</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>those aren&rsquo;t real polls</p>
<p>what i mean about</p>
<p>a poll is like</p>
<p>you go somewhere and it&rsquo;s a multiple page</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;d ask</p>
<p>questions that much</p>
<p>even a few questions like</p>
<p>10 questions</p>
<p>sometimes like you know like</p>
<p>once in a while like if a product</p>

<p>bobby fisher yeah he&rsquo;s the one from</p>
<p>the video searching for bobby fisher at the movie</p>
<p>it was all based on him</p>
<p>and he was a child chess prodigy</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s</p>

<p>like a retard</p>
<p>is the word</p>
<p>some retaliation</p>
<p>strategic that that kind of a strategic mindset</p>
<p>apply to jiu jitsu i bet</p>
<p>i mean if you were making free money</p>
<p>just like twenty k a</p>
<p>month which is probably in the area</p>
<p>doing nothing why would you do on my that</p>
<p>money just flowing the fucking</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t want to do it you know what i mean he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to he can just</p>
<p>stick to be in the</p>
<p>the greatest jiu jitsu player of all time well i would</p>
<p>love to see just professional</p>
<p>jiu jitsu because i&rsquo;ve always said that you know</p>
<p>one of the best things</p>
<p>about jiu jitsu</p>
<p>watching jiu jitsu is you don&rsquo;t have any guilt</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching dudes get jacked and even if you jack a guy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no guilt</p>
<p>because like when you</p>
<p>knock somebody out or you hurt somebody or even you</p>
<p>watch someone get</p>
<p>knocked out</p>
<p>at least part of my</p>
<p>brain is like that guy just got fucked</p>
<p>up you know there&rsquo;s like a part of that guy that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be the same</p>
<p>again and like he got hit by a car yeah</p>
<p>yeah i mean someone gets really fucking head kicked</p>
<p>when when gonzaga pro copped pro cop</p>
<p>when he had kicked krokov</p>
<p>and knocked him out</p>
<p>i remember i had an interview krokov</p>
<p>afterwards and his he was just</p>
<p>you know it really was a dumb idea to interview him</p>
<p>i should have probably protested</p>
<p>but we always interview the winner and the</p>
<p>loser and he was up and they said okay interview the</p>
<p>loser so i just automatically went to it</p>
<p>but as i was talking to him i&rsquo;m like this poor guy</p>
<p>should not be getting interviewed</p>
<p>right now this guy just</p>
<p>you know he just got</p>
<p>knocked unconscious he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>exactly sure what happened and i&rsquo;m asking him questions</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>you see something like that man you go wow</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a fucking price</p>
<p>but jujutsu</p>
<p>never feels like there&rsquo;s a price</p>
<p>you know guys</p>
<p>get jacked and even if they get hurt like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be okay</p>
<p>and most of the time 99</p>
<p>of the time but</p>
<p>marcella garcia man if he</p>
<p>could just do professional jujutsu if they could have</p>
<p>like a guy like that</p>
<p>you could have</p>
<p>professional jujutsu and even put it on tv and it</p>
<p>would be exciting</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d be just</p>
<p>catching people all</p>
<p>the time there&rsquo;s so many good guys now i mean marcelo</p>
<p>still the king</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many guys out there</p>
<p>still competing like</p>
<p>ryan hall and and jeff glover and</p>
<p>all those new brazilians</p>
<p>busting out</p>
<p>rafael mendes cobrina</p>
<p>rafael lovato</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many guys that are good at no gi</p>
<p>it should be in the olympics right away</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why</p>
<p>no gee jiu jitsu</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be in the olympics yeah geese</p>
<p>a little too slow</p>
<p>that would bore</p>
<p>people that down yeah</p>
<p>that bores me you have that</p>
<p>funny story</p>
<p>about going to</p>
<p>watch with john jacques</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>i was always the guy in class</p>
<p>that asked the questions about</p>
<p>yanking on collars and yanking on sleeves</p>
<p>and asking like how is that gonna</p>
<p>translate an mma</p>
<p>i mean cause i was embarrassed i</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>jiu jitsu i</p>
<p>would tell guys</p>
<p>check check out this next</p>
<p>fight this guy&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>jiu jitsu guy he&rsquo;s gonna fuck</p>
<p>him up he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna jack him</p>
<p>and the first</p>
<p>fight that i got really</p>
<p>disappointed with was</p>
<p>bustamante against bolander</p>
<p>i love bustamante</p>
<p>to death he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still one of my all time favorite</p>
<p>fighters but i</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that he couldn&rsquo;t finish him off his back</p>
<p>it was just baffled me i kept saying okay he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get him</p>
<p>right now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just setting him up he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get him and then it didn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>and i asked sean jacques i&rsquo;m like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with</p>
<p>how come we never see</p>
<p>sweeps and finishes</p>
<p>off you know rarely off</p>
<p>off from the bottom you never see</p>
<p>sweeps and finishes</p>
<p>at the same rate</p>
<p>as you do at the moondials</p>
<p>at the moondials are</p>
<p>sweeping their finishing off</p>
<p>their back like i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s incredible how</p>
<p>much action there is like off your back but not an mma</p>
<p>was different so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t have the gi</p>
<p>to hold on to</p>
<p>yeah well if you practice setting up all your</p>
<p>submissions and sweeps</p>
<p>yanking and pulling on</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s outfit and that&rsquo;s actually part of the sweep</p>
<p>you take that out and then you also add strikes</p>
<p>man it just it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole different game</p>
<p>so um you know</p>
<p>what was the question</p>
<p>how did we get this far</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about john jacques</p>
<p>watching in</p>
<p>matches with</p>
<p>you and you guys were both saying how boring</p>
<p>oh yes yes so i always</p>
<p>immediately i was questioning the gig</p>
<p>on man this</p>
<p>could be a problem this is making</p>
<p>jiu jitsu look bad like for me it was like</p>
<p>how does jiu</p>
<p>jitsu look in mma</p>
<p>and then when i went to</p>
<p>the moondials</p>
<p>in 2000 as a purple belt with jean jacques</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re watching the</p>
<p>black belts</p>
<p>and i can&rsquo;t even keep my eyes open</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so it just</p>
<p>most of the matches</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t boring there were some</p>
<p>exciting matches and there</p>
<p>still are some</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>exciting matches with the gi</p>
<p>but generally</p>
<p>i was sitting there trying to keep</p>
<p>my eyes open and john jacques looked over and goes man</p>
<p>this is so boring he wanted to leave</p>
<p>and right there that</p>
<p>struck him like damn</p>
<p>one of them</p>
<p>fucking baddest jujutsu players of all time my master</p>
<p>is bored with watching</p>
<p>black belts</p>
<p>play tug of war</p>
<p>and the gee</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i thought whoa man</p>
<p>the gi is a problem and</p>
<p>for me the reason</p>
<p>why i started</p>
<p>teaching without the gi</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t to separate myself from</p>
<p>like the brazilian</p>
<p>jiu jitsu community it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t me going</p>
<p>fuck you you know you guys with the gi</p>
<p>i took off the gi</p>
<p>for jiu jitsu</p>
<p>i did this shit for</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the one thing i</p>
<p>want everyone to understand</p>
<p>especially the brazilians that hate me is</p>
<p>i did this for jujutsu the most important</p>
<p>thing for me is how jujutsu looks in mma</p>
<p>and i feel that the gi is a problem for mma</p>
<p>so i decided when i open up the</p>
<p>school i wanna</p>
<p>try to bring</p>
<p>jiu jitsu back</p>
<p>i&rsquo;mma do whatever i can personally whatever i can do</p>
<p>to bring jiu</p>
<p>jitsu back in mma</p>
<p>well you did it also because you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the most effective way to do it in mma</p>
<p>yes no of course</p>
<p>of course i thought it was the most effective way</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m doing it for</p>
<p>jiu jitsu i feel that if everyone</p>
<p>lost the gi</p>
<p>like 10 years ago and just</p>
<p>focused on no gee</p>
<p>submissions</p>
<p>setting up everything in the clinch</p>
<p>setting everything up with overhooks</p>
<p>underhooks and head control as opposed to setting</p>
<p>everything up with</p>
<p>yanking and pulling collars and sleeves</p>
<p>if we would have</p>
<p>started everybody 10 years ago we just killed the gee</p>
<p>hellio would have said</p>
<p>no more gee</p>
<p>we need to come back we need to dominate</p>
<p>mma again man the</p>
<p>world would be a different</p>
<p>place we would see</p>
<p>we would see</p>
<p>hundred shenya aokis</p>
<p>a hundred javi</p>
<p>vasquez did you see what</p>
<p>ryan hall said recently</p>
<p>you know thing</p>
<p>about how he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t play</p>
<p>guard anymore</p>
<p>that all he&rsquo;s concerned with now is</p>
<p>if he winds up on bottom is</p>
<p>sweeping getting on top to finish</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautiful if you</p>
<p>could do it but what</p>
<p>about the guys you can&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s saying that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying that you can&rsquo;t rely on your</p>
<p>guard anymore</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t rely on</p>
<p>sweeps all the time either</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna be on your back regardless and</p>
<p>if you could sweep them</p>
<p>most of my game is all</p>
<p>about sweeps i&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>about sweeping and getting on top</p>
<p>but you have to</p>
<p>prepare for the</p>
<p>worst case scenario</p>
<p>a guy that puts on your back and you can&rsquo;t sweep them</p>
<p>you better have a wicked</p>
<p>finishing game</p>
<p>off your back as well you got to have both</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t finish everybody</p>
<p>from your back</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sweep everybody</p>
<p>but if a dude</p>
<p>stuffs all your</p>
<p>sweeps and he</p>
<p>stuffs all your finishes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just better than you that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>you know but you</p>
<p>gotta have as much game as possible i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>amazed if somebody hasn&rsquo;t stepped up and</p>
<p>tried to make a professional</p>
<p>jiu jitsu league you know i know rico</p>
<p>chipperelli</p>
<p>did that thing for a little bit</p>
<p>but you know he was</p>
<p>he was having a hard time with it but i think i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s more popular now than it was then well</p>
<p>the problem with the rico</p>
<p>chipperelli</p>
<p>promotion which was professional</p>
<p>submission league psl</p>
<p>great concept he just had like</p>
<p>eight super</p>
<p>fight matches man he</p>
<p>had marcelo in there</p>
<p>against jake</p>
<p>shields he had</p>
<p>marcelo in there</p>
<p>against cameron earl</p>
<p>but he was the only way he thought he</p>
<p>could make it work</p>
<p>and sell it to a network or something even like espn</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>was to have</p>
<p>randy couture as the main event</p>
<p>and randy couture</p>
<p>originally he retired a few years ago</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>planning on doing</p>
<p>mma anymore but he his plan was</p>
<p>just to stay in the mix competitively</p>
<p>and do submission grappling</p>
<p>so rico jumped on and said hey dude you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be the poster boy to this you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna blow this up</p>
<p>but then when he decided to go back to mma</p>
<p>he was left without a poster</p>
<p>child and i mean i</p>
<p>think i think he</p>
<p>could make it</p>
<p>successful with with the guys we have nowadays like</p>
<p>make marcella garcia the poster</p>
<p>child and then</p>
<p>bring in you know</p>
<p>you know karina</p>
<p>bringing rafael mendes</p>
<p>bringing a bra</p>
<p>leo esteema bringing</p>
<p>again jeff glover ryan hall javi</p>
<p>vasquez all</p>
<p>these guys that</p>
<p>you know javi&rsquo;s back in the mix in</p>
<p>mma now but i</p>
<p>think you could do it now i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you need</p>
<p>randy couture</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so what they really need is they need to</p>
<p>get some sort of a network behind it someone willing to</p>
<p>step up and take a chance with it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard man</p>
<p>look at bellator</p>
<p>i mean bellators</p>
<p>on like fox</p>
<p>sports net you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they have a hard time getting a network</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>gonna pay attention to it if you have</p>
<p>jiu jitsu on fox</p>
<p>sports net it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be really</p>
<p>tough you know it&rsquo;s not a lot of people that are like</p>
<p>focused on that if you get it on espn</p>
<p>on the other hand and</p>
<p>made a big deal and</p>
<p>the difference the difference between</p>
<p>submission grappling and mma</p>
<p>the advantage it could be a small advantage</p>
<p>in some people&rsquo;s eyes but</p>
<p>people will get into it because</p>
<p>anybody can actually</p>
<p>practice it and you can go to your local jiu jitsu</p>
<p>school and you actually can get involved so</p>
<p>it has the potential is there</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;ll never be as exciting as dudes</p>
<p>smashing skulls</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff but</p>
<p>submission grappling</p>
<p>with the right guys</p>
<p>can be very very</p>
<p>exciting and</p>
<p>i think it could be successful they got dogs</p>
<p>catching frisbees at 1 30 in the morning</p>
<p>you can throw up some no giju</p>
<p>jitsu up there for sure they got the</p>
<p>i mean pool is huge</p>
<p>i mean pool is on tv</p>
<p>all the time it&rsquo;s not huge</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s on tv though</p>
<p>starving to death yeah but it&rsquo;s on tv</p>
<p>barely it&rsquo;s barely on tv a lot of</p>
<p>those matches that you</p>
<p>watch are old matches the women have some on espn</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no money in it</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s making any money</p>
<p>you have to go</p>
<p>overseas to make the real</p>
<p>money there&rsquo;s a couple tournaments like</p>
<p>the us open you win that you win 40 000</p>
<p>you gotta play for a week and that&rsquo;s only the winner</p>
<p>you know you get down to like the</p>
<p>other people there&rsquo;s not much money okay okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not much</p>
<p>money in it but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still on the air</p>
<p>and i could see</p>
<p>submission grappling like</p>
<p>that on the air and no one&rsquo;s really making that much</p>
<p>money except for the top guys</p>
<p>but then you got like poker that&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>money right</p>
<p>yeah who watches fucking poker you know what the thing</p>
<p>about poker is man</p>
<p>thing about poker</p>
<p>yeah you watch poker</p>
<p>i love i&rsquo;m sorry there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>poker is that you could</p>
<p>watch and you</p>
<p>could know what we all have</p>
<p>like when you</p>
<p>watch it at home</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t affect the outcome of the game so you</p>
<p>could see like if you had two aces you had an</p>
<p>ace and kang</p>
<p>you could see</p>
<p>without you seeing what he had</p>
<p>the people watching</p>
<p>could see what he had</p>
<p>so they know everyone is in on it</p>
<p>so how&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>gonna play out and it</p>
<p>affects what if baseball</p>
<p>was like that</p>
<p>where you knew what the</p>
<p>pitcher was</p>
<p>gonna throw</p>
<p>like right before</p>
<p>they let you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting hmm</p>
<p>cause if they let you know a</p>
<p>second before you throw</p>
<p>how could you ever get to him how</p>
<p>could he get to him that</p>
<p>quick and if he&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>somewhere else he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>keeping his eye he</p>
<p>would fuck him up that&rsquo;s a good idea dude like</p>
<p>right away boom yeah</p>
<p>yeah if you had like the</p>
<p>picture had like a little</p>
<p>thing on his mouth</p>
<p>you know what it</p>
<p>would have to be someone who</p>
<p>could read the signs because the</p>
<p>catcher is giving</p>
<p>those signs</p>
<p>or just do it like a 20</p>
<p>second delay</p>
<p>does the catcher give</p>
<p>those signs or the</p>
<p>pitcher give</p>
<p>those signs</p>
<p>who decides what gets thrown</p>
<p>the catcher the</p>
<p>pitcher can say no yes</p>
<p>the pitcher</p>
<p>has he&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>executive producer and the</p>
<p>catcher is the producer but you can have like</p>
<p>bitchy arguments</p>
<p>you can totally you can</p>
<p>you see him</p>
<p>going no dude</p>
<p>no no no no</p>
<p>basically the</p>
<p>catcher is trying to get them to</p>
<p>agree like okay what are we</p>
<p>going to do it&rsquo;s up to you but you want to</p>
<p>throw this i&rsquo;m suggesting this</p>
<p>you could do that with football too like</p>
<p>right before the snap</p>
<p>boom it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be a run or something that is one of the hardest</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>putting anything together is getting two people to</p>
<p>agree on what</p>
<p>should be done</p>
<p>you know like if you have an</p>
<p>executive producer</p>
<p>and you have the</p>
<p>talent and they&rsquo;re together</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to work things out</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s a hard fucking</p>
<p>thing to come together on you&rsquo;d have to put it on a 10</p>
<p>second delay then that</p>
<p>would ensure</p>
<p>that no one was there for the baseball team yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had that</p>
<p>with music though</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;ve had that with</p>
<p>music where</p>
<p>dudes are trying to fuck with and</p>
<p>change your shit and you didn&rsquo;t like it remember that</p>
<p>executive producer you were working with for a</p>
<p>while which one</p>
<p>the guy down san diego</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah yeah remember</p>
<p>you wanted to</p>
<p>do all this and do all that no that wasn&rsquo;t gonna work</p>
<p>happens all the time</p>
<p>exactly happens all the time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve had it happen with</p>
<p>everything i&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>everything i&rsquo;ve ever done that has to do with</p>
<p>creativity that involves</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>they all wanna die i am open</p>
<p>i am open to hear</p>
<p>him i&rsquo;ve always been that way and</p>
<p>every band that i&rsquo;ve been in</p>
<p>the rule has always been the same</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re five of us</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m twenty two years old</p>
<p>there everyone&rsquo;s like in their</p>
<p>early twenties like</p>
<p>anybody can write</p>
<p>but we all have to like it</p>
<p>like if you want to come up with something</p>
<p>okay we all have to like it because when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage man what&rsquo;s most important</p>
<p>you would rather play someone else&rsquo;s good shit</p>
<p>than your bad shit right oh</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want no one</p>
<p>wants to go on</p>
<p>stage in the</p>
<p>crowds going what the fuck is this</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s liking and the</p>
<p>other guys are going</p>
<p>to talking behind</p>
<p>their back like</p>
<p>dude i don&rsquo;t want to do this song anymore</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the last</p>
<p>thing you want you want to avoid that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know what i mean so what ends up happening</p>
<p>is real quick</p>
<p>you end up everyone gravitating</p>
<p>to the guy who&rsquo;s putting together the best shit</p>
<p>right and there&rsquo;s always that band</p>
<p>where you know that they&rsquo;re just giving this</p>
<p>fucking drummer a bone and letting them sing right now</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s always a few songs like that right dude</p>
<p>the perfect example is</p>
<p>peter chris from kiss</p>
<p>he co wrote a song he</p>
<p>thinks he wrote beth</p>
<p>but really bob</p>
<p>ezrin wrote it</p>
<p>and his famous producer</p>
<p>and so it says</p>
<p>peter chris and bob</p>
<p>ezrin that song</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>biggest kiss song to date beth was huge it was like a</p>
<p>it was the first one that ever i was a</p>
<p>huge kiss fam that was the</p>
<p>first one that made it on the</p>
<p>radio yeah that was massive beth is fucking huge so</p>
<p>peter chris got a big head goes i want to leave kiss</p>
<p>you guys are let me only</p>
<p>write one song</p>
<p>i want to write more songs</p>
<p>he goes i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna make a solo</p>
<p>album and paul stanley</p>
<p>goes do do do do do</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll all make solo</p>
<p>albums and we&rsquo;ll put them together but let&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>break up make a solo</p>
<p>album that&rsquo;s cool we&rsquo;ll all make solo</p>
<p>albums so they all put out</p>
<p>solo albums at the same time</p>
<p>peter chris&rsquo;s</p>
<p>album the guy who wanted to</p>
<p>leave to make the solo</p>
<p>album was not only the</p>
<p>worst of the solo</p>
<p>albums but it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst kiss album ever</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s known for the</p>
<p>worst kiss album</p>
<p>no kiss fan has ever said they liked that album</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s that bad it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>bad it&rsquo;s really bad dude it&rsquo;s really really really bad</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>in the band anymore but there&rsquo;s a fake</p>
<p>peter chris now</p>
<p>the way they did it originally when</p>
<p>peter and ace left</p>
<p>they replaced them</p>
<p>with new characters like eric fox came on to replace</p>
<p>peter chris as the fox</p>
<p>vinnie vincent came on to replace aesefully as the</p>
<p>egyptian god or something but</p>
<p>then they finally</p>
<p>took the makeup off they went like 10 15 years</p>
<p>without makeup</p>
<p>and then when they put the makeup back they got</p>
<p>peter and ace the original guys back</p>
<p>they did a couple reunion tours</p>
<p>and the exact same</p>
<p>thing happened</p>
<p>peter fucked up</p>
<p>ace fucked up so they kicked him out</p>
<p>but this time what happened to the fox</p>
<p>where that guy go he died actually</p>
<p>but when they did the reunion tour you got to</p>
<p>bring back the original guys because that was two</p>
<p>other guys that were</p>
<p>checking out this picture</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ace really</p>
<p>tattooed on this guy&rsquo;s side he was a</p>
<p>he was a bartender</p>
<p>or a server at the</p>
<p>cap city comedy</p>
<p>club that&rsquo;s all kidney</p>
<p>bobby and he rented</p>
<p>ace really and he was</p>
<p>drunk and he was talking all the shit to ace really</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>goes fuck you kid</p>
<p>so he gets ace</p>
<p>really&rsquo;s picture</p>
<p>tattooed on him with</p>
<p>fuck you kid</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it up here that&rsquo;s amazing see</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ll put it on my twitter</p>
<p>later today but he</p>
<p>got this fucking</p>
<p>tattoo of ace</p>
<p>freely tattooed</p>
<p>his whole side</p>
<p>of his body</p>
<p>is permanently a big</p>
<p>picture of a shitty one too</p>
<p>of ace freely</p>
<p>where it says fuck you kid</p>
<p>underneath it that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>so when they decided to do the reunion</p>
<p>they got the original guys</p>
<p>ace and peter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been like</p>
<p>15 years of course they wanted to do they realized</p>
<p>fuck we fucked up god damn it why do we leave kids</p>
<p>and get kicked out at the same times like both</p>
<p>they both got back in</p>
<p>the reunion</p>
<p>tours were massive they did a couple and then</p>
<p>peter started fucking up and a</p>
<p>started fucking up somehow they left</p>
<p>so instead of getting new guys with new characters</p>
<p>they got new guys to play</p>
<p>ace and peter wow</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know and</p>
<p>they can introduce the guys and say as</p>
<p>no they never did that</p>
<p>they never did that</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have to go</p>
<p>down no they</p>
<p>never pretended like that was the real</p>
<p>ace and that was the real peter</p>
<p>maybe they did the</p>
<p>first few shows</p>
<p>maybe they try to do some shenanigans</p>
<p>not saying they did shenanigans</p>
<p>i said they said you know and now starring as</p>
<p>bang and they say the guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never don&rsquo;t they never</p>
<p>said no they said the real guy&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>because what happened is</p>
<p>when they did the reunion to her</p>
<p>eric singer</p>
<p>the non makeup kiss drummer</p>
<p>and bruce kulick the non makeup kiss guitar player</p>
<p>they got left in the behind go we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do a reunion tour and blow this shit up</p>
<p>this non makeup band ain&rsquo;t happening but</p>
<p>but when peter left</p>
<p>they got the non makeup dude eric singer to play peter</p>
<p>whoa so he came in and</p>
<p>he always said he was eric singer but</p>
<p>they know that most a lot of the fans</p>
<p>that are coming they don&rsquo;t even know the difference</p>
<p>oh man i like kiss me when i was a kid i&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>check out kids they&rsquo;re fucking cool man rock and roll</p>
<p>night they have no idea</p>
<p>they realize they</p>
<p>never hide it they</p>
<p>never deny it</p>
<p>but they know that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna come up we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say that&rsquo;s eric singer we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tommy thayer</p>
<p>playing ace but</p>
<p>most of the people aren&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>gonna notice what was the deal with</p>
<p>ace freeley and</p>
<p>peter chris</p>
<p>what why couldn&rsquo;t they get it together it</p>
<p>the exact same</p>
<p>thing drugs</p>
<p>and alcohol</p>
<p>and peter and they&rsquo;re getting old too</p>
<p>peter peter</p>
<p>was not a very good drummer</p>
<p>back when he practiced a lot</p>
<p>oh really and when you</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>jiu jitsu man you don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>keep practicing you lose your chops</p>
<p>a drummer has to be like a fucking machine literally</p>
<p>on time and</p>
<p>peter and paul and gene</p>
<p>have never never stopped touring they</p>
<p>never stopped putting out albums</p>
<p>those guys are machines</p>
<p>sing their ass off</p>
<p>and they could play i mean paul is</p>
<p>unconscious playing and singing and gene he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the most</p>
<p>underrated bass players ever</p>
<p>he can sing</p>
<p>fucking harmonies like the beatles</p>
<p>paul and jean</p>
<p>are machines bro</p>
<p>so what they got they were decided to replace</p>
<p>eric singer the old</p>
<p>the non makeup kiss guy they brought him in they put</p>
<p>peter chris makeup on him</p>
<p>and he can and he can sing</p>
<p>eric singer can sing</p>
<p>and he can play his ass off he&rsquo;s an amazing drummer</p>
<p>and he could sing so they go we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>bring this guy back does he sing beth now</p>
<p>this yes this is this is</p>
<p>they did a reality show you know they did the</p>
<p>success the gene simmons show was so successful</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>ended up doing and they</p>
<p>would show spots of kiss</p>
<p>during the gene simmons reality show</p>
<p>but then they</p>
<p>kind of did a spin off why don&rsquo;t we just follow kiss</p>
<p>so your reality shows all fucking fake</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>so most they had to make</p>
<p>even the ones that are real</p>
<p>the camera that the</p>
<p>facial reactions like they have like one camera there</p>
<p>and how they getting how they panning to all</p>
<p>these facial reactions</p>
<p>where they like storing</p>
<p>these facial reactions</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>from two weeks ago there&rsquo;s a good one a perplexed look</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they do it</p>
<p>yeah yeah that&rsquo;s how fake it is</p>
<p>so with the jeans</p>
<p>with the kiss</p>
<p>reality show there was like a miniseries rally</p>
<p>show or it might be an ongoing show</p>
<p>they have to create some drama</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re following around and eric singer who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dressed like</p>
<p>peter is like jean</p>
<p>can i do beth</p>
<p>for the next show</p>
<p>and then jean&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>you know promised</p>
<p>peter that we</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do bath i don&rsquo;t know and like</p>
<p>eric&rsquo;s like come on dude let me do bath</p>
<p>so then eric singer disappears</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re about to do a show</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s eric singer</p>
<p>we started an hour</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s been able to find them all the</p>
<p>all looking for</p>
<p>edgar singer he&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>ridiculous it was</p>
<p>ridiculous man</p>
<p>having them</p>
<p>argue backstage</p>
<p>about singing beth oh</p>
<p>is there a way</p>
<p>to do a reality show and not have fake shit yeah</p>
<p>called no editing allowed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one camera</p>
<p>but it might not</p>
<p>be interesting</p>

<p>real techniques but we just have fun</p>
<p>mixed in with yeah</p>
<p>shenanigans it&rsquo;s hilarious have you</p>

<p>fight and he</p>
<p>chokes me out and he puts me out and he</p>
<p>leaves people</p>
<p>have people figured out what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on yet</p>
<p>or do people think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most people know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fake but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>small percentage like i just got</p>
<p>someone a forum</p>
<p>member from the day one this girl</p>
<p>emailed me yesterday said</p>
<p>you know i respect</p>
<p>you to death</p>

<p>all is the hinata thing real</p>
<p>because i just</p>
<p>gotta know it</p>
<p>either way if it&rsquo;s real it&rsquo;s real it&rsquo;s cool but</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s fake just let me know</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>wow you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much evidence people are piecing together like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking footage of</p>
<p>rumors on the days of our lives</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re putting it on the form</p>
<p>and i just keep deleting it</p>
<p>any evidence i just delete</p>
<p>it just delete it&rsquo;s a tricky</p>
<p>thing man when people fake it</p>
<p>when people fake anything</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>video i just saw the</p>
<p>other day of</p>
<p>alan delchar</p>

<p>was like no fucking way i just thought he was</p>
<p>crazy this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t hearing what he was saying i was just</p>
<p>going oh cause</p>
<p>i always thought like the</p>
<p>first time i ever met alan belcher</p>
<p>it was after</p>
<p>an awesome victory i</p>
<p>talked to him a little bit and invited him to my school</p>
<p>i thought he was like a</p>
<p>i thought man</p>
<p>this guy can snap he was seemed like a snapper</p>
<p>like he would just like i seen i&rsquo;m like damn</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like a little scared of them i do really know</p>
<p>it just in the</p>
<p>first time we met</p>
<p>he had just beat someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ass his lip was all fucked up and it was quivering</p>
<p>he had to cut live</p>
<p>it was quivering i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>man i&rsquo;m like dude i</p>
<p>would love to show you some</p>
<p>some you know rubber</p>
<p>guard shit you know and come on down to the gym</p>
<p>and i for a</p>
<p>second i thought man this guy</p>
<p>he could snap on me</p>
<p>he ended up being a</p>
<p>super fucking</p>
<p>sweetheart he&rsquo;s totally cool i love alan belcher</p>
<p>but when he</p>
<p>tried to punk me</p>
<p>what was the premise of it i don&rsquo;t remember he got mad</p>
<p>about something i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>but i remember as soon as it</p>
<p>started coming</p>
<p>as soon as it happened he was</p>
<p>screaming i turned to the camera and went no</p>
<p>like he was trying to</p>
<p>fight you no no no it wasn&rsquo;t me</p>
<p>i was on the outside</p>
<p>i was on the outside</p>
<p>you and you were trying to keep him from getting mad</p>
<p>about something he was i</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>gonna start a</p>
<p>fight with a</p>
<p>bouncer or something he was getting nuts with a</p>
<p>bouncer and i was</p>
<p>going oh no fuck we got a</p>
<p>crazy motherfucker on our head</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna fight a</p>
<p>bouncer right now</p>
<p>that is a problem</p>
<p>if you hang out with a certain number of</p>
<p>mma fighters</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>always one or two that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>loose cannon</p>
<p>you never know a couple of</p>
<p>drinks getting them shaking that</p>
<p>junie browning was at my</p>
<p>school last night</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s he doing</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s totally cool man i love junie</p>
<p>browning but</p>
<p>before i actually met him</p>
<p>he was the only guy ever that i saw on the</p>
<p>ultimate fighter</p>
<p>and you know we&rsquo;re always backstage running into</p>
<p>these guys all the time</p>
<p>and the new</p>
<p>season comes on i go i got to remember</p>
<p>these dudes because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be running to him all the time i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>not know their names and feel like a</p>
<p>total douchebag</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>this i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>watching the show</p>
<p>studying their</p>
<p>fighting techniques</p>
<p>seeing what kind of</p>
<p>fighter they are</p>
<p>and what kind of</p>
<p>personality they have when they showed junie</p>
<p>browning on top</p>
<p>i thought to myself man</p>
<p>this guy can snap on anybody</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to get to know this guy</p>
<p>i made the decision in my head</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get close to that guy that</p>
<p>guy was who</p>
<p>in las vegas we&rsquo;re eating at</p>
<p>nine at the</p>
<p>bombs yes and he was a really nice guy</p>
<p>what happened was</p>
<p>and he was a big fan of yours and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i tried to avoid him i didn&rsquo;t want to talk to him</p>
<p>i just thought from the show they made him seem like a</p>
<p>total lunatic right so</p>
<p>in sean tompkins</p>
<p>trained him and he just fucked somebody up on a</p>
<p>spike show in</p>
<p>vegas and we&rsquo;re at nine the</p>
<p>place is packed i see sean tompkins walking towards me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>love sean tompkins so as soon as he came up</p>
<p>i like you know we gave each</p>
<p>other a little hug and i saw that oh damn</p>
<p>junie brown is</p>
<p>right behind him and his buddy</p>
<p>so i hugged</p>
<p>sean thompkins and kind of look the</p>
<p>other way trying to pretend like i didn&rsquo;t notice junie</p>
<p>browning i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going fuck man here he comes he&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>right for me shit he&rsquo;s with sean thompkins</p>
<p>i hear him right next to me he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>right over my shoulder</p>
<p>and he almost passed me by but his buddy</p>
<p>from kentucky said hey there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eddie bravo</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>oh shit he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come up so he</p>
<p>tapped me on the shoulder</p>
<p>and i looked over i was hey</p>
<p>dude what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on dude</p>
<p>great fight</p>
<p>fuck and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking oh shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m actually talking to him holy shit what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>and then he goes bro man</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>studying your books and smoking weed and</p>
<p>and on the mats with your book out i do rubber</p>
<p>guard i got a good twister</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden like whoa</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s this guy&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tenth planet fan</p>
<p>like all of a</p>
<p>sudden i got to give this guy a chance maybe</p>
<p>maybe i pre judged them</p>
<p>and he turned out to be a fucking cool guy man and</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>about moving to la</p>
<p>and to get away from</p>
<p>vegas he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>partying anymore he just wants to</p>
<p>clean up his life and and</p>
<p>make a big comeback</p>
<p>still young kid</p>
<p>right isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he he&rsquo;s funny as hell dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s funny that</p>
<p>motherfuckers funny</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>drunk after</p>
<p>jiu jitsu we hung out in the parking lot and</p>
<p>he made all of us laugh</p>
<p>quite a few times he&rsquo;s got some witty ass shit man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a cool dude</p>
<p>he just you know he had a bad</p>
<p>upbringing his dad used to beat the shit out of him and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna come up you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a little</p>
<p>kinks you know a couple</p>
<p>kinks that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>i mean we&rsquo;ve run into so many guys over the years that</p>
<p>started out like that and then eventually got</p>
<p>their shit together</p>
<p>you know one way or another</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s fun to</p>
<p>watch guys like that evolve</p>
<p>and become something better than what they were</p>
<p>like chris lieben</p>
<p>perfect example</p>
<p>of a guy who</p>
<p>started out</p>
<p>as kind of a brawler and now he&rsquo;s like a fucking like</p>
<p>after you put</p>
<p>aaron simpson away</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>seasoned motherfucker now triangled</p>
<p>akiyama yeah</p>
<p>for real yeah chris</p>
<p>leubin&rsquo;s a bad man he&rsquo;s smart man</p>
<p>and i believe that junie</p>
<p>browning i really believe that he&rsquo;s too smart</p>
<p>to throw his life away he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>smart he&rsquo;s if he was an idiot</p>
<p>he might just</p>
<p>he might just keep fucking well he</p>
<p>would benefit from hanging around you man if he</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>understand troubled</p>
<p>childhoods and and and channeling that shit into</p>
<p>you know something positive and</p>
<p>being around positive people man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing to for</p>
<p>having a positive life being around a bunch of</p>
<p>other people that are on the same wavelength as you</p>

<p>things to keep that ego in check</p>

<p>thank you yeah you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s a massive</p>
<p>misconception</p>
<p>about jujutsu that</p>
<p>jujutsu classes are a</p>
<p>bunch of meatheads they&rsquo;re douchebags are dickheads and</p>
<p>shoot they think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>we train in a cage and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>computer nerds that</p>
<p>that are playing the ultimate</p>
<p>virtual reality game</p>
<p>cause if you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>video games and like</p>
<p>killing someone by</p>
<p>pressing a button</p>
<p>but no one&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>dying but you</p>
<p>enjoy that that feeling</p>
<p>jujitsu is the</p>
<p>ultimate virtual reality</p>
<p>video game it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where we is</p>
<p>gonna end up the we</p>
<p>feeling more like a baseball bat like a golf club</p>
<p>how about you can can actually kill people</p>
<p>you know theoretically or</p>
<p>you know with jujitsu you put someone in the</p>
<p>choke they tap out</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>you killed them because if you didn&rsquo;t let them go you</p>
<p>would actually kill them and</p>
<p>you could learn</p>
<p>you can it&rsquo;s anybody there&rsquo;s so many jujutsu</p>
<p>schools all over the</p>
<p>world you can</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>systematically and</p>
<p>scientifically</p>
<p>break limbs</p>
<p>and put people to</p>
<p>sleep there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>over twenty different ways you can put someone to</p>
<p>sleep just with the neck you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably more i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>guessing at</p>
<p>least twenty</p>
<p>all these different</p>
<p>jokes so many different variations of guillotine darcy</p>
<p>and it becomes just</p>
<p>a really fun game to it&rsquo;s an amazing game yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>killing game</p>
<p>where i mean</p>
<p>i hurt my arm</p>
<p>like a couple of weeks ago</p>
<p>you know but like you know</p>
<p>for the most part</p>
<p>when you get</p>
<p>go to you know you get involved in like serious</p>
<p>rolling with somebody</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s over you know you get caught with something</p>
<p>you just tap and 99</p>
<p>of the time you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>every now and</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll get something something will get tweaked</p>
<p>or your knee will get</p>
<p>twisted i know</p>
<p>you had a knee problem that happened recently oh</p>
<p>i both my knees are fucked up but it&rsquo;s so fun you</p>
<p>never think</p>
<p>about stopping doing it you just think</p>
<p>man i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait for myself to heal up exactly so i can get</p>
<p>back and you&rsquo;re like fuck</p>
<p>like when you when you</p>
<p>tweak something you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like god damn it i probably out a couple weeks shit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just fun it&rsquo;s so much fun i mean</p>
<p>think about this</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>work out everybody has to work out if you&rsquo;re in perfect</p>
<p>shape you have to maintain you have to keep working on</p>
<p>why not work out</p>
<p>and learn how to take people out</p>
<p>put him to sleep at the same time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ultimate video game</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exercise</p>
<p>you learn some serious</p>
<p>self defense that can come up at any time in your</p>
<p>life it&rsquo;s valuable and it gives you so much confidence</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so much fun it kills</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and then you meet a lot of</p>
<p>great people that have</p>
<p>their ego in</p>
<p>check because if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have your ego in check</p>
<p>then those people don&rsquo;t survive jiu jitsu</p>
<p>the tapping is</p>
<p>a douchebag filter</p>
<p>tapping because dudes that</p>
<p>are just just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where their</p>
<p>eagle rules</p>
<p>them they can&rsquo;t jump on the mat and get tapped out</p>
<p>they run from it</p>
<p>or they get on the edge of the mat so like no way am i</p>
<p>gonna let people tap me out</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on but subconsciously</p>
<p>the fear of being</p>
<p>dominated and tapping out by losing</p>
<p>looking like a weakling</p>
<p>that scares people away you</p>
<p>gotta look at it like you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>learning of course you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get tapped out in the beginning</p>
<p>and the more the more you come the more</p>
<p>dedicated you are</p>
<p>as time passes</p>
<p>you start tapping dudes out occasionally but</p>
<p>still you&rsquo;re usually tapping you&rsquo;re a beginner</p>
<p>ultimately one or two years</p>
<p>man you you can minimize</p>
<p>those taps and your</p>
<p>getting your</p>
<p>learning if you did jujutsu for two years</p>
<p>the odds are in a</p>
<p>street fight one on one</p>
<p>the odds are</p>
<p>way on your side</p>
<p>way on your side</p>
<p>you know anybody</p>
<p>could anything</p>
<p>could happen in a</p>
<p>street fight but man a guy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trained jujutsu two years</p>
<p>against a guy has zero</p>
<p>training on the ground</p>
<p>hmm another</p>
<p>great aspect of it is that it calms down your body</p>
<p>and it makes you realize how much of an</p>
<p>influenced stress and</p>
<p>just the fact that we have this ancient</p>
<p>chimpanzee hardware</p>
<p>in our system our</p>
<p>bodies are set up for hunting and gathering and</p>
<p>carrying things and our</p>
<p>bodies are set up to exert a certain amount of energy</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t exert</p>
<p>a certain amount of energy with your body your body</p>
<p>starts to betray you</p>
<p>and you start to get really stressful and you</p>
<p>start to snap at things</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ordinarily snap at or you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>rationally be</p>
<p>upset about</p>
<p>it allows you to put</p>
<p>things into perspective it calms your body down</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important man yeah i mean are you saying</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is better than</p>
<p>quake are you</p>
<p>gonna start that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of people put a bunch of</p>
<p>videos of cool</p>
<p>video games that are out there man</p>
<p>fuck you know like to try to tell me that there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>man there&rsquo;s some insane shit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>one i don&rsquo;t know the name of it but they were</p>
<p>it was like looked like they were in the jungle</p>
<p>and they were like near some like it looks like some</p>
<p>mayan temples and shit</p>
<p>the graphics are insane russian attack</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>it does man i don&rsquo;t know what it is i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>what it was someone put just</p>
<p>you know a demo up</p>
<p>and then someone put crisis</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>but the demo was insane and</p>
<p>then crisis was another one it was pretty interesting</p>
<p>a bunch of dudes running around</p>
<p>shooting people</p>
<p>but then i put a</p>
<p>video i went to</p>
<p>watch a video of</p>
<p>quake online and i go back to what i said</p>
<p>nothing can fuck a</p>
<p>quick it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i understand that</p>
<p>these games are beautiful</p>
<p>i understand</p>
<p>these games have all</p>
<p>these cool things you can do there&rsquo;s the latest</p>
<p>version of quake</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quake iv yeah okay</p>
<p>all i want to do is fuck people up in one on one</p>
<p>death matches</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i like to do but yet</p>
<p>yours i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i understand what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying man no i&rsquo;m just saying that if you like</p>
<p>deathmatches</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve taken the formula of</p>
<p>deathmatch and just</p>
<p>added on to it for the last</p>
<p>15 20 years or whatever</p>
<p>how long quake</p>
<p>3 was quake</p>
<p>4 was 2 000 something</p>
<p>like 2005 or 2006 all</p>
<p>right so for the last five six</p>
<p>maybe i should</p>
<p>i might not</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken the formula they even used the same engine</p>
<p>on call of duty when it</p>
<p>first came out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just improved it improved it improved it</p>
<p>and like a lot of</p>
<p>these games</p>
<p>last week i wasn&rsquo;t talking</p>
<p>about like keyboard and mouse</p>
<p>necessarily</p>
<p>is better than controller argument</p>
<p>my point is is that</p>
<p>the games are better now</p>
<p>the games are better now they&rsquo;re not geared towards</p>
<p>the accuracy of a keyboard and</p>
<p>mouse as much as they are geared for just having a fun</p>
<p>experience inside</p>
<p>a video game yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of auto aim going on</p>
<p>people do those</p>
<p>driving games and</p>
<p>autonomous just</p>
<p>easier to people</p>
<p>still do those driving games yeah yeah</p>
<p>totally to me though</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s fun to me</p>
<p>about video games</p>
<p>i understand all that</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s fun to me is just i got addicted straight up</p>
<p>to one on one matches</p>
<p>and even like team</p>
<p>death matches you know just</p>
<p>the fact that you have this incredibly precise</p>
<p>control over the environment yeah you&rsquo;re more like</p>
<p>the pool statistic</p>
<p>of video games exactly i mean it&rsquo;s all just a very</p>
<p>small majority</p>
<p>yeah most people like to</p>
<p>play football games and the control is perfect for that</p>
<p>with quake games</p>
<p>those one on one</p>
<p>first person</p>
<p>shooters it&rsquo;s just so precise</p>
<p>so addictive man what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about was your cousins addicted</p>
<p>james no my nephew nephew</p>
<p>man when i was a little kid if they&rsquo;d hit me with some</p>
<p>quake i would have lost my life i would have</p>
<p>never got into martial arts i</p>
<p>would have never</p>
<p>got productive with my life i would have</p>
<p>never paid attention in</p>
<p>school joe there&rsquo;s a game on</p>
<p>steam that you can play on your mac</p>
<p>that has nothing to do with it but i want you to</p>
<p>next time you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bored and you just want to</p>
<p>spend because it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>short game so you can&rsquo;t get addicted to it</p>
<p>like literally you</p>
<p>could beat it in like six</p>
<p>hours really</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s called portal</p>
<p>and i think six hours</p>
<p>jesus i ain&rsquo;t got six</p>
<p>hours i got kids no</p>
<p>no i mean but six</p>
<p>hours spread up for like months but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an addiction you will</p>
<p>that game alone</p>
<p>will set your mind racing to</p>
<p>how crazy video games are nowadays</p>
<p>so what is the best one</p>
<p>right now if i wanted to get something for</p>
<p>xbox and something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna blow my fucking mind</p>
<p>gears of war</p>
<p>for you i would probably go with</p>
<p>more of like a borderlands or something like that but</p>
<p>i would actually find a game that you</p>
<p>could play on your mac you know</p>
<p>like a game like call of duty that you can play i think</p>
<p>call of duty 4</p>
<p>is on there and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple scenes</p>
<p>from call of duty</p>
<p>4 that will blow your fucking mind you know just that</p>
<p>red there&rsquo;s a red one red something cowboy one</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get that this shit what is</p>
<p>that one that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>grand theft auto but using a</p>
<p>horse and cowboy was it called</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called red dead dawn or something</p>
<p>like that i gave it a chance but i was like all</p>
<p>right this is</p>
<p>grand theft auto i don&rsquo;t play anymore</p>
<p>that was a hugely</p>
<p>successful game though</p>
<p>super you know it&rsquo;s just people like that formula</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bigger and better than</p>
<p>grand theft auto</p>
<p>but for me i just played it and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m done with that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna play that anymore i&rsquo;m over that they say that</p>
<p>ea martial arts game is a bust</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s buying it</p>
<p>really really</p>
<p>i just haven&rsquo;t played the</p>
<p>ufc do you have</p>
<p>like a box of</p>
<p>you one yeah cool</p>

<p>she&rsquo;s funny man she was hilarious</p>
<p>she did a good</p>
<p>job and you did a good job too man it was interesting</p>
<p>watching you loosen up</p>
<p>from the first set you did on thursday</p>
<p>night to the last set you did on saturday</p>
<p>night which was your best one</p>
<p>right i have</p>
<p>something to</p>
<p>admit to you joe that</p>
<p>second set saturday</p>
<p>i acted like i smoked marijuana before i went on</p>
<p>stage before i went on stage</p>
<p>the second shot you remember before we all we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>smoke out because i was like no and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like i do it do it and i&rsquo;m like no i don&rsquo;t want all</p>
<p>right so that show that you have was the one when you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t high</p>
<p>right hmm you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t high at all no i</p>
<p>must have been a little high well from the</p>
<p>first time but that was like</p>
<p>three hours so it</p>
<p>leveled off</p>
<p>because you were nervous</p>
<p>weed isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>great when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>nervous man and he realized that that you were probably</p>
<p>high and got paranoid</p>
<p>well i was getting high</p>
<p>and then going on</p>
<p>stage like five minutes</p>
<p>later that&rsquo;s not a good mix for me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a good mix for the podcast either</p>
<p>before we&rsquo;ve done that many times we get high</p>
<p>right before we do the podcast like today</p>
<p>the first words out of my</p>
<p>mouth were like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t come out that good</p>
<p>but like right now we&rsquo;re two</p>
<p>hours in it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>smooth but once</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really confident you can&rsquo;t wait to go on</p>
<p>stage then the weed will take it through the roof</p>
<p>yeah but even then you</p>
<p>gotta make sure you don&rsquo;t get too hard i</p>
<p>think red bull and vodka</p>
<p>one or two of them before on</p>
<p>stage is the key</p>
<p>ingredient for</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>one or two red bulls in</p>
<p>vodka red bull</p>
<p>vodka is here</p>
<p>i like a little bit of weed</p>
<p>yeah some calisthenics yeah my best</p>
<p>teaching always comes from</p>
<p>me being high when i</p>
<p>teach because i&rsquo;m so confident with it that</p>
<p>it adds to it</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;ll be pissed off like if i forget</p>
<p>if i forget like i forgot to i don&rsquo;t have weed</p>
<p>right now and i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>teach class</p>
<p>today stoned</p>
<p>this morning</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t teach guide</p>
<p>i felt pretty good i mean i feel it was a good class</p>
<p>but i always feel like when i&rsquo;m high it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t want the</p>
<p>class to end</p>
<p>i wanted to keep</p>
<p>going i want more time when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in that space and then that&rsquo;s all like shit i&rsquo;m running</p>
<p>out of time there&rsquo;s so much i got to say in show</p>
<p>when we like</p>
<p>shown show we got high in the car</p>
<p>right before we went in there</p>
<p>really high</p>
<p>we want like three hit</p>
<p>alex jones show</p>
<p>would be cool huh</p>
<p>though well it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s bewildering</p>
<p>though because when we walked in you know i walked in</p>
<p>joe they&rsquo;re about to d</p>
<p>value the dollar they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take the dollar away</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been proven</p>
<p>here in forbes they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>x raying your home they&rsquo;re driving by</p>
<p>and vans and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>and photos you irradiating your</p>
<p>house with deadly radiation that can give cancer</p>
<p>these poor people</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like you go from</p>
<p>right out of the car everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>laughing we&rsquo;re talking shit</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re breaking down country</p>
<p>music there was like some</p>
<p>ridiculous country music song</p>
<p>you know but lonely girls make the best lovers</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>we were laughing our asses off</p>
<p>and then you go</p>
<p>right in there</p>
<p>death destruction</p>
<p>new it leads</p>
<p>global warming</p>
<p>what was he saying</p>
<p>about the radiation and all i</p>
<p>should do this is a</p>
<p>crazy fucking real</p>
<p>thing they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re driving through neighborhoods and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>blasting these cars</p>
<p>with these super</p>
<p>powerful x rays from these vans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking inside</p>
<p>vehicles they have</p>
<p>photos of this shit it was in forbes magazine</p>
<p>he pulls up the</p>
<p>story and shows it to me and they&rsquo;re doing it to</p>
<p>houses too they just</p>
<p>drive by and</p>
<p>point this fucking</p>
<p>crazy x ray gun</p>
<p>at cars and see</p>
<p>right through them they show all</p>
<p>these photos of</p>
<p>people looking at like</p>
<p>bricks of cocaine the back of a van</p>
<p>like this is nuts man</p>
<p>like they can</p>
<p>shoot x rays</p>
<p>it just makes me really wonder though how</p>
<p>people go on the radiation like what</p>
<p>exactly how</p>
<p>strong it is cause</p>
<p>the other day i was talking to my dentist</p>
<p>and he said like you know</p>
<p>this radiation is</p>
<p>about equal to</p>
<p>standing next to a microwave</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>he said yeah something like that i forget</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what you</p>
<p>should wear a lead vest when you microwaves a popcorn</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for but that he said it&rsquo;s not that big a deal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s not wearing a lead vest you know and</p>
<p>well the crazy</p>
<p>thing is that there&rsquo;s radiation around us all the time</p>
<p>right right like yourself space and</p>
<p>microwaving your</p>
<p>brain every time you</p>
<p>put up yeah no one knows what&rsquo;s happening with those</p>
<p>right yeah so what happens</p>
<p>though when you&rsquo;re in your car though and you got</p>
<p>a hands free is that okay well not when you have your</p>
<p>phone between</p>
<p>your crotch when you&rsquo;re driving cooking your dick</p>
<p>it was a study</p>
<p>release recently that said that laptops cook your balls</p>
<p>yeah cook your</p>
<p>sperm that&rsquo;s i that&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>totally makes your</p>
<p>sperm ineffective</p>
<p>if you have your laptop on your lap</p>
<p>yeah you cooking your balls</p>
<p>but not up there</p>
<p>no no no no it&rsquo;s because i</p>
<p>heat the heat</p>
<p>yeah cooks your balls yeah i</p>
<p>never put my laptop on my lap</p>
<p>yeah i got this</p>
<p>thing for that</p>
<p>very reason so i got this little pad that</p>
<p>sits on the laptop it makes it more comfortable anyway</p>
<p>cause the bottom is like soft so it</p>
<p>sort of molds to your legs</p>
<p>and with that note</p>
<p>do you got that italian</p>
<p>song no it says</p>
<p>find youtube user does not</p>
<p>allow mobile</p>
