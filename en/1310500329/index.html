    <p>turns out that if you train a planarian and then cut their heads off, the tail will regenerate a</p>
<p>brand new brain that still remembers the original information. I think planaria hold the answer to</p>
<p>pretty much every deep question of life. For one thing, they&rsquo;re similar to our ancestors. So they</p>
<p>have true symmetry, they have a true brain, they&rsquo;re not like earthworms, they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much more advanced life form. They have lots of different internal organs, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>these little, they&rsquo;re about, you know, maybe two centimeters in the centimeter to two in size.</p>
<p>And they have a head and a tail. And the first thing is planaria are immortal. So they do not</p>
<p>age. There&rsquo;s no such thing as an old planarian. So that right there tells you that these theories</p>
<p>of thermodynamic limitations on lifespan are wrong. It&rsquo;s not that well over time of everything</p>
<p>degrades. No, planaria can keep it going for probably, you know, how long have they been</p>
<p>around 400 million years, right? So these are the actual, so the planaria in our lab</p>
<p>are actually in physical continuity with planaria that were here 400 million years ago.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Michael Levin, one of the most fascinating and brilliant</p>
<p>biologists I&rsquo;ve ever talked to. He and his lab at Tufts University works on novel ways to understand</p>
<p>and control complex pattern formation in biological systems. Andre Karpathy, a world</p>
<p>class AI researcher, is the person who first introduced me to Michael Levin&rsquo;s work. I bring</p>
<p>this up because these two people make me realize that biology has a lot to teach us about AI,</p>
<p>and AI might have a lot to teach us about biology. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Michael Levin. Embryogenesis is the process of building the human body from a single cell. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s one of the most incredible things that exists on earth from a single embryo. So how does</p>
<p>this process work? Yeah, it is an incredible process. I think it&rsquo;s maybe the most magical</p>
<p>process there is. And I think one of the most fundamentally interesting things about it is that</p>
<p>it shows that each of us takes the journey from so called just physics to mind, right? Because we</p>
<p>all start life as a single quiescent, unfertilized oocyte, and it&rsquo;s basically a bag of chemicals,</p>
<p>and you look at that and you say, okay, this is chemistry and physics. And then nine months and</p>
<p>some years later, you have an organism with high level cognition and preferences and an inner life</p>
<p>and so on. And what embryogenesis tells us is that that transformation from physics to mind is</p>
<p>gradual. It&rsquo;s smooth. There is no special place where, you know, a lightning bolt says, boom,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;ve gone from physics to true cognition. That doesn&rsquo;t happen. And so we can see in this</p>
<p>process that the whole mystery, you know, the biggest mystery of the universe, basically,</p>
<p>how you get mind from matter. From just physics, in quotes. Yeah. So where&rsquo;s the magic into the</p>
<p>thing? How do we get from information encoded in DNA and make physical reality out of that</p>
<p>information? So one of the things that I think is really important if we&rsquo;re going to bring in DNA</p>
<p>into this picture is to think about the fact that what DNA encodes is the hardware of life. DNA</p>
<p>contains the instructions for the kind of micro level hardware that every cell gets to play with.</p>
<p>So all the proteins, all the signaling factors, the ion channels, all the cool little pieces of</p>
<p>hardware that cells have, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the DNA. The rest of it is in so called generic laws.</p>
<p>And these are laws of mathematics. These are laws of computation. These are laws of physics,</p>
<p>of all kinds of interesting things that are not directly in the DNA. And that process, you know,</p>
<p>I think the reason I always put just physics in quotes is because I don&rsquo;t think there is such a</p>
<p>thing as just physics. I think that thinking about these things in binary categories, like this is</p>
<p>physics, this is true cognition, this is as if it&rsquo;s only faking these kinds of things. I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what gets us in trouble. I think that we really have to understand that it&rsquo;s a continuum</p>
<p>and we have to work up the scaling, the laws of scaling. And we can certainly talk about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of really interesting thoughts to be had there.</p>
<p>So the physics is deeply integrated with the information. So the DNA doesn&rsquo;t exist on its own.</p>
<p>The DNA is integrated as, in some sense, in response to the laws of physics at every scale.</p>
<p>The laws of the environment it exists in.</p>
<p>Yeah, the environment and also the laws of the universe. I mean, the thing about the DNA is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s once evolution discovers a certain kind of machine, that if the physical implementation is</p>
<p>appropriate, it&rsquo;s sort of, and this is hard to talk about because we don&rsquo;t have a good vocabulary</p>
<p>for this yet, but it&rsquo;s a very kind of a platonic notion that if the machine is there, it pulls down</p>
<p>interesting things that you do not have to evolve from scratch because the laws of physics give it</p>
<p>to you for free. So just as a really stupid example, if you&rsquo;re trying to evolve a particular</p>
<p>triangle, you can evolve the first angle and you evolve the second angle, but you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>evolve the third. You know what it is already. Now, why do you know? That&rsquo;s a gift for free</p>
<p>from geometry in a particular space. You know what that angle has to be. And if you evolve</p>
<p>an ion channel, which is, ion channels are basically transistors, right? They&rsquo;re voltage</p>
<p>gated current conductances. If you evolve that ion channel, you immediately get to use things</p>
<p>like truth tables. You get logic functions. You don&rsquo;t have to evolve the logic function.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to evolve a truth table. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be in the DNA. You get it for free,</p>
<p>right? And the fact that if you have NAND gates, you can build anything you want, you get that for</p>
<p>free. All you have to evolve is that first step, that first little machine that enables you to</p>
<p>couple to those laws. And there&rsquo;s laws of adhesion and many other things. And this is all that</p>
<p>interplay between the hardware that&rsquo;s set up by the genetics and the software that&rsquo;s made, right?</p>
<p>The physiological software that basically does all the computation and the cognition and everything</p>
<p>else is a real interplay between the information and the DNA and the laws of physics of computation</p>
<p>and so on. So is it fair to say, just like this idea that the laws of mathematics are discovered,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re latent within the fabric of the universe in that same way the laws of biology are kind of</p>
<p>discovered? Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s absolutely, and it&rsquo;s probably not a popular view, but I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right on the money. Yeah. Well, I think that&rsquo;s a really deep idea. Then embryogenesis</p>
<p>is the process of revealing, of embodying, of manifesting these laws. You&rsquo;re not building the</p>
<p>laws. You&rsquo;re just creating the capacity to reveal. Yes. I think, again, not the standard view of</p>
<p>molecular biology by any means, but I think that&rsquo;s right on the money. I&rsquo;ll give you a simple example.</p>
<p>Some of our latest work with these xenobots, right? So what we&rsquo;ve done is to take some skin</p>
<p>cells off of an early frog embryo and basically ask about their plasticity. If we give you a</p>
<p>chance to sort of reboot your multicellularity in a different context, what would you do?</p>
<p>Because what you might assume by&hellip; The thing about embryogenesis is that it&rsquo;s super reliable,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s very robust. And that really obscures some of its most interesting features. We get</p>
<p>used to it. We get used to the fact that acorns make oak trees and frog eggs make frogs. And we</p>
<p>say, well, what else is it going to make? That&rsquo;s what it makes. That&rsquo;s a standard story.</p>
<p>But the reality is&hellip; And so you look at these skin cells and you say, well, what do they know</p>
<p>how to do? Well, they know how to be a passive boring two dimensional outer layer, keeping the</p>
<p>bacteria from getting into the embryo. That&rsquo;s what they know how to do. Well, it turns out that if</p>
<p>you take these skin cells and you remove the rest of the embryo, so you remove all of the rest of</p>
<p>the cells and you say, well, you&rsquo;re by yourself now, what do you want to do? So what they do is</p>
<p>they form this multi little creature that runs around the dish. They have all kinds of incredible</p>
<p>and incredible capacities. They navigate through mazes. They have various behaviors that they do</p>
<p>both independently and together. Basically, they implement von Neumann&rsquo;s dream of self replication,</p>
<p>because if you sprinkle a bunch of loose cells into the dish, what they do is they run around,</p>
<p>they collect those cells into little piles. They sort of mush them together until those little</p>
<p>piles become the next generation of xenobots. So you&rsquo;ve got this machine that builds copies of</p>
<p>itself from loose material in its environment. None of this are things that you would have expected</p>
<p>from the frog genome. In fact, the genome is wild type. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with their genetics.</p>
<p>Nothing has been added, no nanomaterials, no genomic editing, nothing. And so what we have</p>
<p>done there is engineered by subtraction. What you&rsquo;ve done is you&rsquo;ve removed the other cells</p>
<p>that normally basically bully these cells into being skin cells. And you find out that what they</p>
<p>really want to do is to be this, their default behaviors to be a xenobot. But in vivo, in the</p>
<p>embryo, they get told to be skinned by these other cell types. And so now here comes this really</p>
<p>interesting question that you just posed. When you ask where does the form of the tadpole and</p>
<p>the frog come from, the standard answer is, well, it&rsquo;s selection. So over millions of years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been shaped to produce the specific body that&rsquo;s fit for froggy environments.</p>
<p>Where does the shape of the xenobot come from? There&rsquo;s never been any xenobots. There&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>been selection to be a good xenobot. These cells find themselves in the new environment.</p>
<p>In 48 hours, they figure out how to be an entirely different protoorganism with new capacities like</p>
<p>kinematic self replication. That&rsquo;s not how frogs or tadpoles replicate. We&rsquo;ve made it impossible</p>
<p>for them to replicate their normal way. Within a couple of days, these guys find a new way of</p>
<p>doing it that&rsquo;s not done anywhere else in the biosphere. Well, actually, let&rsquo;s step back and</p>
<p>define, what are xenobots? So a xenobot is a self assembling little protoorganism. It&rsquo;s also a</p>
<p>biological robot. Those things are not distinct. It&rsquo;s a member of both classes. How much is it</p>
<p>biology? How much is that robot? At this point, most of it is biology because what we&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re discovering natural behaviors of the cells and also of the cell collectives. Now, one of the</p>
<p>really important parts of this was that we&rsquo;re working together with Josh Bongaert&rsquo;s group at</p>
<p>University of Vermont. They&rsquo;re computer scientists, they do AI, and they&rsquo;ve basically been able to</p>
<p>use a simulated evolution approach to ask, how can we manipulate these cells, give them signals,</p>
<p>not rewire their DNA, so not hardware, but experience signals? So can we remove some cells?</p>
<p>Can we add some cells? Can we poke them in different ways to get them to do other things?</p>
<p>So in the future, there&rsquo;s going to be, we&rsquo;re now, and this is future unpublished work, but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing all sorts of interesting ways to reprogram them to new behaviors. But before you</p>
<p>can start to reprogram these things, you have to understand what their innate capacities are.</p>
<p>Okay, so that means engineering, programming, you&rsquo;re engineering them in the future. And in</p>
<p>some sense, the definition of a robot is something you in part engineer versus evolve. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a fuzzy definition anyway, in some sense, many of the organisms within our body</p>
<p>are kinds of robots. And I think robots is a weird line because it&rsquo;s, we tend to see robots</p>
<p>as the other. I think there will be a time in the future when there&rsquo;s going to be something akin to</p>
<p>the civil rights movements for robots, but we&rsquo;ll talk about that later perhaps. Anyway, so how do</p>
<p>you, can we just linger on it? How do you build a Xenobot? What are we talking about here? From</p>
<p>when does it start and how does it become the glorious Xenobot?</p>
<p>Yeah, so just to take one step back, one of the things that a lot of people get stuck on is they</p>
<p>say, well, you know, engineering requires new DNA circuits or it requires new nanomaterials,</p>
<p>you know, what the thing is, we are now moving from old school engineering, which use passive</p>
<p>materials, right? That things, you know, wood, metal, things like this, that basically the only</p>
<p>thing you could depend on is that they were going to keep their shape. That&rsquo;s it. They don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything else. It&rsquo;s on you as an engineer to make them do everything they&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>And then there were active materials and now computation materials. This is a whole new era.</p>
<p>These are agential materials. This is you&rsquo;re now collaborating with your substrate because your</p>
<p>material has an agenda. These cells have, you know, billions of years of evolution. They have goals.</p>
<p>They have preferences. They&rsquo;re not just going to sit where you put them. That&rsquo;s hilarious that you</p>
<p>have to talk your material into keeping its shape. That&rsquo;s it. That is exactly right. That is exactly</p>
<p>right. Stay there. It&rsquo;s like getting a bunch of cats or something and trying to organize the shape</p>
<p>out of them. It&rsquo;s funny. We&rsquo;re on the same page here because in a paper, this is, this is currently</p>
<p>just been accepted in nature by engineering. One of the figures I have is building a tower</p>
<p>out of Legos versus dogs, right? So think about the difference, right? If you build out of Legos,</p>
<p>you have full control over where it&rsquo;s going to go. But if somebody knocks it over, it&rsquo;s game over.</p>
<p>With the dogs, you cannot just come and stack them. They&rsquo;re not going to stay that way. But</p>
<p>the good news is that if you train them, then somebody knocks it over, they&rsquo;ll get right back</p>
<p>up. So it&rsquo;s all right. So as an engineer, what you really want to know is what can they depend</p>
<p>on this thing to do, right? That&rsquo;s really, you know, a lot of people have definitions of robots</p>
<p>as far as what they&rsquo;re made of or how they got here, you know, design versus evolve, whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of that is useful. I think, I think as an engineer, what you want to know is</p>
<p>how much can I depend on this thing to do when I&rsquo;m not around to micromanage it? What level of,</p>
<p>what level of dependency can I, can I give this thing? How much agency does it have?</p>
<p>Which then tells you what techniques do you use? So do you use micromanagement,</p>
<p>like you put everything where it goes? Do you train it? Do you give it signals? Do you try</p>
<p>to convince it to do things, right? How much, you know, how intelligent is your substrate?</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re moving into this, into this area where you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re working with</p>
<p>agential materials. That&rsquo;s a collaboration. That&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not old, old style.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the word you&rsquo;re using? Agential?</p>
<p>Agential.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>Agency. It comes from the word agency. So, so basically the material has agency, meaning that</p>
<p>it has some, some level of obviously not human level, but some level of preferences, goals,</p>
<p>memories, ability to remember things, to compute into the future, meaning anticipate,</p>
<p>you know, when you&rsquo;re working with cells, they have all of that to some, to various degrees.</p>
<p>Is that empowering or limiting having material as a mind of its own, literally?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s both, right? So it raises difficulties because it means that</p>
<p>it, if you, if you&rsquo;re using the old mindset, which is a linear kind of extrapolation of what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen, you&rsquo;re going to be surprised and shocked all the time because biology does not</p>
<p>do what we linearly expect materials to do. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s massively liberating. And</p>
<p>so in the following way, I&rsquo;ve argued that advances in regenerative medicine require us to take</p>
<p>advantage of this because what it means is that you can get the material to do things that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to micromanage. So just as a simple example, right? If you, if you, you had a rat</p>
<p>and you wanted this rat to do a circus trick, put a ball in the little hoop, you can do it the</p>
<p>micromanagement way, which is try to control every neuron and try to play the thing like a puppet,</p>
<p>right? And maybe someday that&rsquo;ll be possible, maybe, or you can train the rat. And this is</p>
<p>why humanity for thousands of years before we knew any neuroscience, we had no idea what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behind, what&rsquo;s between the ears of any animal. We were able to train these animals because once you</p>
<p>recognize the level of agency of a certain system, you can use appropriate techniques. If you know</p>
<p>the currency of motivation, reward and punishment, you know how smart it is, you know what kinds of</p>
<p>things it likes to do. You are searching a much more, much smoother, much nicer problem space than</p>
<p>if you try to micromanage the thing. And in regenerative medicine, when you&rsquo;re trying to get,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say an arm to grow back or an eye to repair a cell birth defect or something,</p>
<p>do you really want to be controlling tens of thousands of genes at each point to try to</p>
<p>micromanage it? Or do you want to find the high level modular controls that say,</p>
<p>build an arm here. You already know how to build an arm. You did it before, do it again.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s both, it&rsquo;s both difficult and it challenges us to develop new ways of</p>
<p>engineering and it&rsquo;s hugely empowering. Okay. So how do you do, I mean, maybe sticking with</p>
<p>the metaphor of dogs and cats, I presume you have to figure out the, find the dogs and dispose of</p>
<p>the cats. Because, you know, it&rsquo;s like the old herding cats is an issue. So you may be able to</p>
<p>train dogs. I suspect you will not be able to train cats. Or if you do, you&rsquo;re never going to</p>
<p>be able to trust them. So is there a way to figure out which material is amenable to herding? Is it in</p>
<p>the lab work or is it in simulation? Right now it&rsquo;s largely in the lab because we, our simulations</p>
<p>do not capture yet the most interesting and powerful things about biology. So the simulation</p>
<p>does, what we&rsquo;re pretty good at simulating are feed forward emergent types of things,</p>
<p>right? So cellular automata, if you have simple rules and you sort of roll those forward for</p>
<p>every, every agent or every cell in the simulation, then complex things happen, you know, ant colony</p>
<p>or algorithms, things like that. We&rsquo;re good at that. And that&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s fine. The difficulty</p>
<p>with all of that is that it&rsquo;s incredibly hard to reverse. So this is a really hard inverse problem,</p>
<p>right? If you look at a bunch of termites and they make a, you know, a thing with a single chimney</p>
<p>and you say, well, I like it, but I&rsquo;d like two chimneys. How do you change the rules of behavior</p>
<p>free termites? So they make two chimneys, right? Or, or if you say, here are a bunch of cells that are</p>
<p>creating this kind of organism. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s optimal. I&rsquo;d like to repair that birth</p>
<p>defect. How do you control all the, all the individual low level rules, right? All the protein</p>
<p>interactions and everything else, rolling it back from the anatomy that you want to the low level</p>
<p>hardware rules is in general intractable. It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s an inverse problem that&rsquo;s generally not</p>
<p>solvable. So right now it&rsquo;s mostly in the lab because what we need to do is we need to understand</p>
<p>how biology uses top down controls. So the idea is not, not bottom up emergence, but the idea of</p>
<p>things like a goal directed test operate exit kinds of loops where, where it&rsquo;s basically an</p>
<p>error minimization function over a new space and not a space of gene expression, but for example,</p>
<p>a space of anatomy. So just as a simple example, if you have, you have a salamander and it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>an arm, you can, you can amputate that arm anywhere along the length. It will grow exactly</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s needed and then it stops. That&rsquo;s the most amazing thing about regeneration is that it stops</p>
<p>it knows when to stop. When does it stop? It stops when a correct salamander arm has been completed.</p>
<p>So that tells you that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a, a means ends kind of analysis where it has to</p>
<p>know what the correct limb is supposed to look like, right? So it has a way to ascertain the</p>
<p>current shape. It has a way to measure that Delta from, from what shape it&rsquo;s supposed to be. And it</p>
<p>will keep taking actions, meaning remodeling and growing and everything else until that&rsquo;s complete.</p>
<p>So once you know that, and we&rsquo;ve taken advantage of this in the lab to do some, some really wild</p>
<p>things with, with both planaria and frog embryos and so on, once you know that, you can start</p>
<p>playing with that, with that homeostatic cycle. You can ask, for example, well, how does it remember</p>
<p>what the correct shape is? And can we mess with that memory? Can we give it a false memory of</p>
<p>what the shape should be and let the cells build something else? Or can we mess with the measurement</p>
<p>apparatus, right? So it gives you, it gives you those kinds of, so, so, so the idea is to</p>
<p>basically appropriate a lot of the approaches and concepts from cognitive neuroscience and</p>
<p>behavioral science into things that previously were taken to be dumb materials. And, you know,</p>
<p>you get yelled at in class if you, if you, for being anthropomorphic, if you said, well, my cells</p>
<p>want to do this and my cells want to do that. And I think, I think that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a major mistake</p>
<p>that leaves a ton of capabilities on the table. So thinking about biologic systems as things that</p>
<p>have memory, have almost something like cognitive ability, but I mean, how incredible is it,</p>
<p>you know, that the salamander arm is being rebuilt, not with a dictator. It&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>the cellular automata system. All the individual workers are doing their own thing. So where&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>top down signal that does the control coming from? Like, how can you find it? Like, why does it stop</p>
<p>growing? How does it know the shape? How does it have memory of the shape? And how does it tell</p>
<p>everybody to be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, we&rsquo;re done. So the first thing to think about,</p>
<p>I think, is that there are no examples anywhere of a central dictator, because in this kind of</p>
<p>science, because everything is made of parts. And so we, even though we feel as a unified central</p>
<p>sort of intelligence and kind of point of cognition, we are a bag of neurons, right?</p>
<p>All intelligence is collective intelligence. There&rsquo;s this, this is important to kind of</p>
<p>think about, because a lot of people think, okay, there&rsquo;s real intelligence, like me,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s collective intelligence, which is ants and flocks of birds and termites and</p>
<p>things like that. And maybe it&rsquo;s appropriate to think of them as an individual, and maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not, and a lot of people are skeptical about that and so on. But you&rsquo;ve got to realize that</p>
<p>we are not, there&rsquo;s no such thing as this like indivisible diamond of intelligence that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this one central thing that&rsquo;s not made of parts. We are all made of parts. And so if you believe,</p>
<p>which I think is hard to get around, that we in fact have a centralized set of goals and</p>
<p>preferences and we plan and we do things and so on, you are already committed to the fact that</p>
<p>a collection of cells is able to do this, because we are a collection of cells. There&rsquo;s no getting</p>
<p>around that. In our case, what we do is we navigate the three dimensional world and we</p>
<p>have behavior. This is blowing my mind right now, because we are just a collection of cells.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. So when I&rsquo;m moving this arm, I feel like I&rsquo;m the central dictator of that action,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on. All the cells here are collaborating in some interesting way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting signal from the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Well, even the central nervous system is misleadingly named because it isn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>central. Again, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of cells. I mean, all of them, right? There are no,</p>
<p>there are no singular indivisible intelligences anywhere. We are all, every example that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever seen is a collective of something. It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re used to it. We&rsquo;re used to that. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>used to, okay, this thing is kind of a single thing, but it&rsquo;s really not. You zoom in, you know</p>
<p>what you see. You see a bunch of cells running around. Is there some unifying, I mean, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>jumping around, but that something that you look at as the bioelectrical signal versus the</p>
<p>biochemical, the chemistry, the electricity, maybe the life is in that versus the cells.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, there&rsquo;s an orchestra playing and the resulting music is the dictator.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not bad. That&rsquo;s Dennis Noble&rsquo;s kind of view of things. He has two really good books</p>
<p>where he talks about this musical analogy, right? So I think that&rsquo;s, I like it. I like it.</p>
<p>Is it wrong though?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s, no, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong. I think the important</p>
<p>thing about it is that we have to come to grips with the fact that a true proper cognitive</p>
<p>intelligence can still be made of parts. Those things are, and in fact it has to be, and I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a real shame, but I see this all the time. When you have a collective like this, whether it</p>
<p>be a group of robots or a collection of cells or neurons or whatever, as soon as we gain some</p>
<p>insight into how it works, meaning that, oh, I see, in order to take this action, here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>information that got processed via this chemical mechanism or whatever. Immediately people say,</p>
<p>oh, well then that&rsquo;s not real cognition. That&rsquo;s just physics. I think this is fundamentally</p>
<p>flawed because if you zoom into anything, what are you going to see? Of course you&rsquo;re just going to</p>
<p>see physics. What else could be underneath, right? It&rsquo;s not going to be fairy dust. It&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>physics and chemistry, but that doesn&rsquo;t take away from the magic of the fact that there are certain</p>
<p>ways to arrange that physics and chemistry and in particular the bioelectricity, which I like a lot,</p>
<p>to give you an emergent collective with goals and preferences and memories and anticipations</p>
<p>that do not belong to any of the subunits. So I think what we&rsquo;re getting into here,</p>
<p>and we can talk about how this happens during embryogenesis and so on, what we&rsquo;re getting into</p>
<p>is the origin of a self with a capital S. So we ourselves, there are many other kinds of</p>
<p>selves, and we can tell some really interesting stories about where selves come from and how they</p>
<p>become unified. Yeah, is this the first, or at least humans tend to think that this is the</p>
<p>level of which the self with a capital S is first born, and we really don&rsquo;t want to see</p>
<p>human civilization or Earth itself as one living organism. Yeah, that&rsquo;s very uncomfortable to us.</p>
<p>It is, yeah. But is, yeah, where&rsquo;s the self born? We have to grow up past that. So what I like to do</p>
<p>is, I&rsquo;ll tell you two quick stories about that. I like to roll backwards. So as opposed to, so if</p>
<p>you start and you say, okay, here&rsquo;s a paramecium, and you see it, you know, it&rsquo;s a single cell</p>
<p>organism, you see it doing various things, and people will say, okay, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>chemical story to be told about how it&rsquo;s doing it, so that&rsquo;s not a paramecium.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not true cognition, right? And people will argue about that. I like to work it backwards.</p>
<p>I say, let&rsquo;s agree that you and I, as we sit here, are examples of true cognition, if anything,</p>
<p>as if there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s true cognition, we are examples of it. Now let&rsquo;s just roll back</p>
<p>slowly, right? So you roll back to the time when you were a small child and used to doing whatever,</p>
<p>and then just sort of day by day, you roll back, and eventually you become more or less that</p>
<p>paramecium, and then you sort of even below that, right, as an unfertilized OSI. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, no one has, to my knowledge, no one has come up with any convincing discrete step at which</p>
<p>my cognitive powers disappear, right? It just doesn&rsquo;t, the biology doesn&rsquo;t offer any specific</p>
<p>step. It&rsquo;s incredibly smooth and slow and continuous. And so I think this idea that it just</p>
<p>sort of magically shows up at one point, and then, you know, humans have true selves that don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>elsewhere, I think it runs against everything we know about evolution, everything we know about</p>
<p>developmental biology, these are all slow continua. And the other really important story I</p>
<p>want to tell is where embryos come from. So think about this for a second. Amniote embryos, so this</p>
<p>is humans, birds, and so on, mammals and birds and so on. Imagine a flat disk of cells, so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe 50,000 cells. And in that, so when you get an egg from a fertilized, let&rsquo;s say you buy a</p>
<p>fertilized egg from a farm, right? That egg will have about 50,000 cells in a flat disk, it looks</p>
<p>like a little tiny little frisbee. And in that flat disk, what&rsquo;ll happen is there&rsquo;ll be one set</p>
<p>of cells will become special, and it will tell all the other cells, I&rsquo;m going to be the head,</p>
<p>you guys don&rsquo;t be the head. And so it&rsquo;ll amplify symmetry breaking amplification, you get one</p>
<p>embryo, there&rsquo;s some neural tissue and some other stuff forms. Now, you say, okay, I had one egg</p>
<p>and one embryo, and there you go, what else could it be? Well, the reality is, and I used to, I did</p>
<p>all of this as a grad student, if you take a little needle, and you make a scratch in that</p>
<p>blastoderm in that disk, such that the cells can&rsquo;t talk to each other for a while, it heals up, but</p>
<p>for a while, they can&rsquo;t talk to each other. What will happen is that both regions will decide that</p>
<p>they can be the embryo, and there will be two of them. And then when they heal up, they become</p>
<p>conjoint twins, and you can make two, you can make three, you can make lots. So the question of how</p>
<p>many cells are in there cannot be answered until it&rsquo;s actually played all the way through. It isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily that there&rsquo;s just one, there can be many. So what you have is you have this medium,</p>
<p>this, this undifferentiated, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a psychological version of this somewhere</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know the proper terminology. But you have this, you have this list, like the ocean of</p>
<p>potentiality, you have these 1000s of cells, and some number of individuals are going to be formed</p>
<p>out of it, usually one, sometimes zero, sometimes several. And they form out of these cells,</p>
<p>because a region of these cells organizes into a collective that will have goals, goals that</p>
<p>individual cells don&rsquo;t have, for example, make a limb, make an eye, how many eyes? Well, exactly</p>
<p>two. So individual cells don&rsquo;t know what an eye is, they don&rsquo;t know how many eyes you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to have, but the collective does. The collective has goals and memories and anticipations that the</p>
<p>individual cells don&rsquo;t. And that that the establishment of that boundary with its own</p>
<p>ability to maintain to to pursue certain goals. That&rsquo;s the origin of selfhood.</p>
<p>But I, is that goal in there somewhere? Were they always destined? Like, are they discovering</p>
<p>that goal? Like, where the hell did evolution discover this when you went from the prokaryotes</p>
<p>to eukaryotic cells? And then they started making groups. And when you make a certain group,</p>
<p>you make a, you make it sound, and it&rsquo;s such a tricky thing to try to understand, you make it</p>
<p>sound like this cells didn&rsquo;t get together and came up with a goal. But the very act of them</p>
<p>getting together revealed the goal that was always there. There was always that potential</p>
<p>for that goal. So the first thing to say is that there are way more questions here than</p>
<p>certainties. Okay, so everything I&rsquo;m telling you is cutting edge developing, you know, stuff. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as if any of us know the answer to this. But, but here&rsquo;s, here&rsquo;s, here&rsquo;s my opinion on</p>
<p>this. I think what evolution, I don&rsquo;t think that evolution produces solutions to specific problems,</p>
<p>in other words, specific environments, like here&rsquo;s a frog that can live well in a froggy</p>
<p>environment. I think what evolution produces is problem solving machines that that will that will</p>
<p>solve problems in different spaces. So not just three dimensional spaces, but in a way,</p>
<p>three dimensional space. This goes back to what we were talking about before we the brain is a</p>
<p>evolutionarily a late development. It&rsquo;s a system that is able to net to pursue goals in three</p>
<p>dimensional space by giving commands to muscles, where did that system come from that system</p>
<p>evolved from a much more ancient, evolutionarily much more ancient system, where collections of</p>
<p>cells gave instructions to for cell behaviors, meaning cells move to divide to die to change into</p>
<p>cells to navigate more for space, the space of anatomies, the space of all possible anatomies.</p>
<p>And before that, cells were navigating transcriptional space, which is a space of all</p>
<p>possible gene expressions. And before that metabolic space. So what evolution has done,</p>
<p>I think, is is is is produced hardware that is very good at navigating different spaces using a</p>
<p>bag of tricks, right, which which I&rsquo;m sure many of them we can steal for autonomous vehicles and</p>
<p>robotics and various things. And what happens is that they navigate these spaces without a whole</p>
<p>lot of commitment to what the space is. In fact, they don&rsquo;t know what the space is, right? We are</p>
<p>all brains in a vat, so to speak. Every cell does not know, right? Every cell is some other name,</p>
<p>some other cells external environment, right? So where does that with that border between you,</p>
<p>you and the outside world, you don&rsquo;t really know where that is, right? Every every collection of</p>
<p>cell has to figure that out from scratch. And the fact that evolution requires all of these things</p>
<p>to figure out what they are, what effectors they have, what sensors they have, where does it make</p>
<p>sense to draw a boundary between me and the outside world? The fact that you have to build all</p>
<p>that from scratch, this autopoiesis is what defines the border of a self. Now, biology uses like a</p>
<p>multi a multi scale competency architecture, meaning that every level has goals. So so</p>
<p>molecular networks have goals, cells have goals, tissues, organs, colonies. And and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>interplay of all of those that that enable biology to solve problems in new ways, for example, in</p>
<p>xenobots and various other things. This is, you know, it&rsquo;s exactly as you said, in many ways,</p>
<p>the cells are discovering new ways of being. But at the same time, evolution certainly shapes all</p>
<p>this. So so evolution is very good at this agential bioengineering, right? When evolution</p>
<p>is discovering a new way of being an animal, you know, an animal or a plant or something,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s by changing the hardware, you know, protein, changing proteins, protein structure,</p>
<p>and so on. But much of the time, it&rsquo;s not by changing the hardware, it&rsquo;s by changing the</p>
<p>signals that the cells give to each other. It&rsquo;s doing what we as engineers do, which is try to</p>
<p>convince the cells to do various things by using signals, experiences, stimuli. That&rsquo;s what biology</p>
<p>does. It has to, because it&rsquo;s not dealing with a blank slate. Every time as you know, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>evolution, and you&rsquo;re trying to make make a make an organism, you&rsquo;re not dealing with a passive</p>
<p>material that is fresh, and you have to specify it already wants to do certain things. So the easiest</p>
<p>way to do that search to find whatever is going to be adaptive, is to find the signals that are</p>
<p>going to convince cells to do various things, right? Your sense is that evolution operates</p>
<p>both in the software and the hardware. And it&rsquo;s just easier, more efficient to operate in the</p>
<p>software. Yes. And I should also say, I don&rsquo;t think the distinction is sharp. In other words,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a continuum. But I think we can but I think it&rsquo;s a meaningful distinction where you can</p>
<p>make changes to a particular protein, and now the enzymatic function is different, and it metabolizes</p>
<p>differently, and whatever, and that will have implications for fitness. Or you can change the</p>
<p>huge amount of information in the genome that isn&rsquo;t structural at all. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s signaling,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when and how do cells say certain things to each other. And that can have massive changes,</p>
<p>as far as how it&rsquo;s going to solve problems. I mean, this idea of multi hierarchical</p>
<p>competence architecture, which is incredible to think about. So this hierarchy that evolution</p>
<p>builds, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s responsible for this. I also see the incompetence of bureaucracies</p>
<p>of humans when they get together. So how the hell does evolution build this, where at every level,</p>
<p>only the best get to stick around, they somehow figure out how to do their job without knowing</p>
<p>the bigger picture. And then there&rsquo;s like the bosses that do the bigger thing somehow, or that</p>
<p>you can now abstract away the small group of cells as a as an organ or something. And then</p>
<p>that organ does something bigger in the context of the full body or something like this.</p>
<p>How is that built? Is there some intuition you can kind of provide of how that&rsquo;s constructed,</p>
<p>that that hierarchical competence architecture? I love that competence,</p>
<p>just the word competence is pretty cool in this context, because everybody&rsquo;s good at their job.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s really key. And the other nice thing about competency is that so my central</p>
<p>belief in all of this is that engineering is the right perspective on all of this stuff,</p>
<p>because it gets you away from subjective terms. You know, people talk about sentience and this</p>
<p>and that those things very hard to define, or people argue about them philosophically.</p>
<p>I think that engineering terms like competency, like, you know, pursuit of goals, right? All of</p>
<p>these things are, are empirically incredibly useful, because you know, when you see it,</p>
<p>and if it helps you build, right, if I if I can pick the right level, I say, this thing has,</p>
<p>I believe this is x level of like, competency, I think it&rsquo;s like a thermostat, or I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a better thermostat, or I think it&rsquo;s a, you know, various other kinds of, you know,</p>
<p>many, many different kinds of complex systems. If that helps me to control and predict and build</p>
<p>such systems, then that&rsquo;s all there is to say, there&rsquo;s no more philosophy to argue about. So I</p>
<p>like competency in that way, because you can quantify, you could, you have to, in fact, you</p>
<p>have to, you have to make a claim competent at what? And then, or if I say, if I tell you,</p>
<p>it has a goal, the question is, what&rsquo;s the goal? And how do you know? And I say, well, because</p>
<p>every time I deviated from this particular state, that&rsquo;s what it spends energy to get back to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the goal. And we can quantify it, and we can be objective about it. So so so the the,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not used to thinking about this, I give a talk sometimes called Why don&rsquo;t robots get cancer,</p>
<p>right? And the reason robots don&rsquo;t get cancer is because generally speaking, with a few exceptions,</p>
<p>our architectures have been, you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of dumb parts. And you hope that if you put them</p>
<p>together, the the the overlying machine will have some intelligence and do something rather,</p>
<p>right, but the individual parts don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t care, they don&rsquo;t have an agenda. Biology isn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that every level has an agenda. And the final outcome is the result of cooperation and competition,</p>
<p>both within and across levels. So for example, during embryogenesis, your tissues and organs are</p>
<p>competing with each other. And it&rsquo;s actually a really important part of development, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>reason they compete with each other, they&rsquo;re not all just, you know, sort of helping each other,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also competing for information for metabolic for limited metabolic constraints.</p>
<p>But to get back to your your other point, which is, you know, which is which is the seems like</p>
<p>really efficient and good and so on compared to some of our human efforts. We also have to keep</p>
<p>in mind that what happens here is that each level bends the option space for the level beneath so</p>
<p>that your parts basically they don&rsquo;t see the the geometry. So I&rsquo;m using them. And I think I take</p>
<p>I take this the seriously terminology from from like, from like relativity, right, where the space</p>
<p>is literally bent. So the option space is deformed by the higher level so that the lower levels, all</p>
<p>they really have to do is go down their concentration gradient, they don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>in fact, they don&rsquo;t, they can&rsquo;t know what the big picture is. But if you bend the space just right,</p>
<p>if they do what locally seems right, they end up doing your bidding, they end up doing things that</p>
<p>are optimal in the in the higher space. Conversely, because the components are good at getting their</p>
<p>job done, you as the higher level don&rsquo;t need to try to compute all the low level controls,</p>
<p>all you&rsquo;re doing is bending the space, you don&rsquo;t know or care how they&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>Give you a super simple example in the in the tappel, we found that okay, so so tappels need</p>
<p>to become frogs and to become to go from a tappel head to a frog head, you have to rearrange the</p>
<p>face. So the eyes have to move forward, the jaws have to come out the nostrils move like everything</p>
<p>moves. It used to be thought that because all tappels look the same, and all frogs look the</p>
<p>same. If you just remember, if every piece just moves in the right direction, the right amount,</p>
<p>then you get your you get your fraud. Right. So we decided to test we I have this hypothesis that I</p>
<p>thought I thought actually, the system is probably more intelligent than that. So what did we do?</p>
<p>We made what we call Picasso tappels. So these are so everything is scrambled. So the eyes are on the</p>
<p>back of the head, the jaws are off to the side, everything is scrambled. Well, guess what they</p>
<p>make, they make pretty normal frogs, because all the different things move around in novel</p>
<p>paths configurations until they get to the correct froggy sort of frog face configuration,</p>
<p>then they stop. So, so the thing about that is now imagine evolution, right? So, so you make some</p>
<p>sort of mutation, and it does, like every mutation, it does many things. So something good comes of it,</p>
<p>but also it moves your mouth off to the side, right? Now, if if there wasn&rsquo;t this multi scale</p>
<p>competency, you can see where this is going, if there wasn&rsquo;t this multi scale competency,</p>
<p>the organism would be dead, your fitness is zero, because you can&rsquo;t eat. And you would never get to</p>
<p>explore the other beneficial consequences of that mutation, you&rsquo;d have to wait until you find some</p>
<p>other way of doing it without moving the mouth, that&rsquo;s really hard. So, so the fitness landscape</p>
<p>would be incredibly rugged evolution would take forever. The reason it works, one of the reasons</p>
<p>it works so well, is because you do that, no worries, the mouth will find its way where where</p>
<p>it belongs, right? So now you get to explore. So what that means is that all of these mutations</p>
<p>that otherwise would be deleterious are now neutral, because the competency of the parts</p>
<p>make up for all kinds of things. So all the noise of development, all the variability in the</p>
<p>environment, all these things, the competency of the parts makes up for it. So the so so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all that&rsquo;s all fantastic, right? That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s all great. The only other thing to remember when</p>
<p>we compare this to human efforts is this. Every component has its own goals in various spaces,</p>
<p>usually with very little regard for the welfare of the other levels. So so as a simple example,</p>
<p>you know, you as a as a complex system, you will go out and you will do you know, jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>or whatever, you&rsquo;ll have some go you have to go rock climbing, scrape a bunch of cells off your</p>
<p>hands. And then you&rsquo;re happy as a system, right? You come back, and you&rsquo;ve accomplished some goals,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really happy. Those cells are dead. They&rsquo;re gone. Right? Did you think about those</p>
<p>cells? Not really, right? You had some you had some bruising out selfish SOB. That&rsquo;s it. And so</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s the thing to remember is that, you know, and we know this from from history is that</p>
<p>is that just being a collective isn&rsquo;t enough. Because what the goals of that collective will</p>
<p>be relative to the welfare of the individual parts is a massively open and justify the means</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, Stalin was onto something. No, that&rsquo;s the danger. But we can exactly that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>danger of for us humans, we have to construct ethical systems under which we don&rsquo;t take seriously</p>
<p>the full mechanism of biology and apply it to the way the world functions,</p>
<p>which is which is an interesting line we&rsquo;ve drawn. The world that built us is the one we</p>
<p>reject in some sense, when we construct human societies, the idea that this country was founded</p>
<p>on that all men are created equal. That&rsquo;s such a fascinating idea. That&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>against nature and saying, well, there&rsquo;s something bigger here than a hierarchical competency</p>
<p>architecture. But there&rsquo;s so many interesting things you said. So from an algorithmic perspective,</p>
<p>the act of bending the option space. That&rsquo;s really, that&rsquo;s really profound. Because if you</p>
<p>look at the way AI systems are built today, there&rsquo;s a big system, like I said, with robots,</p>
<p>and as a goal, and he gets better and better at optimizing that goal at accomplishing that goal.</p>
<p>But if biology built a hierarchical system where everything is doing computation,</p>
<p>and everything is accomplishing the goal, not only that, it&rsquo;s kind of dumb,</p>
<p>you know, with the limited with a bent option space is just doing the thing that&rsquo;s the easiest</p>
<p>thing for in some sense. And somehow that allows you to have turtles on top of turtles,</p>
<p>literally dumb systems on top of dumb systems that as a whole create something incredibly smart.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, every system is has some degree of intelligence in its own problem domain. So,</p>
<p>so cells will have problems they&rsquo;re trying to solve in physiological space and transcriptional</p>
<p>space. And then I can give you some some cool examples of that. But the collective is trying</p>
<p>to solve problems in anatomical space, right and forming a, you know, a creature and growing your</p>
<p>blood vessels and so on. And then the collective the the the whole body is solving yet other</p>
<p>problems, they may be in social space and linguistic space and three dimensional space.</p>
<p>And who knows, you know, the group might be solving problems in, you know, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>some sort of financial space or something. So one of the major differences with with most,</p>
<p>with most AIs today is is a the kind of flatness of the architecture, but also of the fact that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re constructed from outside their their borders, and they&rsquo;re, you know, so a few. So,</p>
<p>to a large extent, and of course, there are counter examples now, but but to a large extent,</p>
<p>our technology has been such that you create a machine or a robot, it knows what its sensors are,</p>
<p>it knows what its effectors are, it knows the boundary between it and the outside world,</p>
<p>although this is given from the outside. Biology constructs this from scratch. Now the best example</p>
<p>of this that that originally in robotics was actually Josh Bongard&rsquo;s work in 2006, where he</p>
<p>made these, these robots that did not know their shape to start with. So like a baby, they sort of</p>
<p>floundered around, they made some hypotheses, well, I did this, and I moved in this way. Well,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m a whatever, maybe I have wheels, or maybe I have six legs or whatever, right? And</p>
<p>they would make a model and eventually will crawl around. So that&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the autopoiesis, but we can go a step further. And some people are doing this. And</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re sort of working on some of this too, is this idea that let&rsquo;s even go back further,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what sensors you have, you don&rsquo;t know where you end in the outside world</p>
<p>begins. All you have is is certain things like active inference, meaning you&rsquo;re trying to minimize</p>
<p>surprise, right? You have some metabolic constraints, you don&rsquo;t have all the energy you</p>
<p>need, you don&rsquo;t have all the time in the world to think about everything you want to think about. So</p>
<p>that means that you can&rsquo;t afford to be a micro reductionist, you know, all this data coming in,</p>
<p>you have to course grain it and say, I&rsquo;m gonna take all this stuff, and I&rsquo;m gonna call that a</p>
<p>cat. I&rsquo;m gonna take all this, I&rsquo;m gonna call that the edge of the table I don&rsquo;t want to fall off of.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to know anything about the micro states, what I want to know is what is the optimal</p>
<p>way to cut up my world. And by the way, this thing over here, that&rsquo;s me. And the reason that&rsquo;s me is</p>
<p>because I have more control over this than I have over any of this other stuff. And so now you can</p>
<p>begin to write. So that&rsquo;s self construction at that, that figuring out making models of the</p>
<p>outside world, and then turning that inwards, and starting to make a model of yourself, right, which</p>
<p>immediately starts to get into issues of agency and control. Because in order to if you are under</p>
<p>metabolic constraints, meaning you don&rsquo;t have the energy, right, that all the energy in the world,</p>
<p>you have to be efficient, that immediately forces you to start telling stories about coarse grained</p>
<p>agents that do things, right, you don&rsquo;t have the energy to like Laplace&rsquo;s demon, you know,</p>
<p>calculate every, every possible state that&rsquo;s going to happen, you have to you have to course grain,</p>
<p>and you have to say, that is the kind of creature that does things, either things that I avoid,</p>
<p>or things that I will go towards, that&rsquo;s a major food or whatever, whatever it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>And so right at the base of simple, very simple organisms starting to make</p>
<p>models of agents doing things, that is the origin of models of free will, basically, right, because</p>
<p>you see the world around you as having agency. And then you turn that on yourself. And you say,</p>
<p>wait, I have agency too, I can I do things, right. And and then you make decisions about what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do. So all of this one one model is to view all of those kinds of things as</p>
<p>being driven by that early need to determine what you are and to do so and to then take</p>
<p>actions in the most energetically efficient space possible. Right. So free will emerges</p>
<p>when you try to simplify, tell a nice narrative about your environment. I think that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>plausible. Yeah. You think free was an illusion. So you&rsquo;re kind of implying that it&rsquo;s a useful hack.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll say two things. The first thing is, I think I think it&rsquo;s very plausible to say that</p>
<p>any organism that self or any agent that self whether it&rsquo;s biological or not, any agent that</p>
<p>self constructs under energy constraints, is going to believe in free will, we&rsquo;ll get to whether it</p>
<p>has free will momentarily. But but I think but I think what what it definitely drives is a view of</p>
<p>yourself and the outside world as an agential view, I think that&rsquo;s inescapable. So that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>for even primitive organisms? I think so. I think that&rsquo;s now now they don&rsquo;t have now obviously,</p>
<p>you have to scale down, right. So so so so they don&rsquo;t have the kinds of complex metacognition</p>
<p>that we have. So they can do long term planning and thinking about free will and so on and so on.</p>
<p>But but the sense of agency is really useful to accomplish tasks simple or complicated. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right. In all kinds of spaces, not just in obvious three dimensional space. I mean, we&rsquo;re very good</p>
<p>that the thing is, humans are very good at detecting agency of like medium sized objects</p>
<p>moving at medium speeds in the three dimensional world, right? We see a bowling ball and we see a</p>
<p>mouse and we immediately know what the difference is, right? And how we&rsquo;re going to mostly things</p>
<p>you can eat or get eaten by. Yeah, yeah. That&rsquo;s our that&rsquo;s our training set, right? From the time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re little, your training set is visual data on on this this like little chunk of your experience.</p>
<p>But imagine if imagine if from the time that we were born, we had innate senses of your blood</p>
<p>chemistry, if you could feel your blood chemistry, the way you can see, right, you had a high bandwidth</p>
<p>connection, and you could feel your blood chemistry, and you could see, you could sense all</p>
<p>the things that your organs were doing. So your pancreas, your liver, all the things. If we had</p>
<p>that you we would be very good at detecting intelligence and physiological space, we would</p>
<p>know the level of intelligence that our various organs were deploying to deal with things that</p>
<p>were coming to anticipate the stimuli to, you know, but but we&rsquo;re just terrible at that. We</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, in fact, in fact, people don&rsquo;t even, you know, you talk about intelligence that these are</p>
<p>the paper spaces. And a lot of people think that&rsquo;s just crazy, because, because all we&rsquo;re all we know</p>
<p>is motion. We do have access to that information. So it&rsquo;s actually possible that so evolution could</p>
<p>if we wanted to construct an organism that&rsquo;s able to perceive the flow of blood through your body,</p>
<p>the way you see an old friend and say, yo, what&rsquo;s up? How&rsquo;s the wife and the kids? In that same way,</p>
<p>you would see that you would feel like a connection to the liver. Yeah, yeah, I think,</p>
<p>you know, maybe other people&rsquo;s liver and not just your own, because you don&rsquo;t have access to other</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s. Not yet. But you could imagine some really interesting connection, right? But like</p>
<p>sexual selection, like, oh, that girl&rsquo;s got a nice liver. Well, that&rsquo;s like, the way her blood flows,</p>
<p>the dynamics of the blood is very interesting. It&rsquo;s novel. I&rsquo;ve never seen one of those.</p>
<p>But you know, that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re trying to half ass when we, when we judge judgment of</p>
<p>beauty by facial symmetry and so on. That&rsquo;s a half assed assessment of exactly that. Because</p>
<p>if your cells could not cooperate enough to keep your organism symmetrical, you know,</p>
<p>you can make some inferences about what else is wrong, right? Like that&rsquo;s a very, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very basic. Interesting. Yeah. So that in some deep sense, actually, that is what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. We&rsquo;re trying to infer how health, we use the word healthy, but basically, how functional</p>
<p>is this biological system I&rsquo;m looking at so I can hook up with that one and make offspring? Yeah,</p>
<p>yeah. Well, what kind of hardware might their genomics give me that that might be useful in</p>
<p>the future? I wonder why evolution didn&rsquo;t give us a higher resolution signal. Like why the whole</p>
<p>peacock thing with the feathers? It doesn&rsquo;t seem, it&rsquo;s a very low bandwidth signal for</p>
<p>sexual selection. I&rsquo;m gonna, and I&rsquo;m not an expert on this stuff, but on peacocks. Well,</p>
<p>you know, but I&rsquo;ll take a stab at the reason. I think that it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s an arms race. You</p>
<p>see, you don&rsquo;t want everybody to know everything about you. So I think that as much as, as much as,</p>
<p>and in fact, there&rsquo;s another interesting part of this arms race, which is, if you think about this,</p>
<p>the most adaptive, evolvable system is one that has the most level of top down control, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s really easy to say to a bunch of cells, make another finger versus, okay, here&rsquo;s 10,000</p>
<p>gene expression changes that you need to do to make it to change your finger, right? The system</p>
<p>with good top down control that has memory and when we need to get back to that, by the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a question I neglected to answer about where the memory is and so on. A system that uses</p>
<p>all of that is really highly evolvable and that&rsquo;s fantastic. But guess what? It&rsquo;s also highly subject</p>
<p>to hijacking by parasites, by cheaters of various kinds, by conspecifics. Like we found that,</p>
<p>and then that goes back to the story of the pattern memory in these planaria,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bacterium that lives on these planaria. That bacterium has an input into how many heads</p>
<p>the worm is going to have because it&rsquo;s hijacks that control system and it&rsquo;s able to make a</p>
<p>chemical that basically interfaces with the system that calculates how many heads you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to have and they can make them have two heads. And so you can imagine that if you</p>
<p>are two, so you want to be understandable for your own parts to understand each other,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to be too understandable because you&rsquo;ll be too easily controllable.</p>
<p>And so I think that my guess is that that opposing pressure keeps us from being a super high</p>
<p>bandwidth kind of thing where we can just look at somebody and know everything about them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a kind of biological game of Texas hold them. You&rsquo;re showing some cards and you&rsquo;re hiding</p>
<p>other cards and there&rsquo;s part of it and there&rsquo;s bluffing and there&rsquo;s all that. And then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably whole species that would do way too much bluffing. That&rsquo;s probably where peacocks fall.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book that I don&rsquo;t remember if I read or if I read summaries of the book,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about evolution of beauty and birds. Where is that from? Is that a book or does</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins talk about it? But basically there&rsquo;s some species start to like over select</p>
<p>for beauty, not over select. They just some reason select for beauty. There is a case to be made.</p>
<p>Actually now I&rsquo;m starting to remember, I think Darwin himself made a case that you can select</p>
<p>based on beauty alone. There&rsquo;s a point where beauty doesn&rsquo;t represent some underlying biological</p>
<p>truth. You start to select for beauty itself. And I think the deep question is there some evolutionary</p>
<p>value to beauty, but it&rsquo;s an interesting kind of thought that can we deviate completely from</p>
<p>the deep biological truth to actually appreciate some kind of the summarization in itself.</p>
<p>Let me get back to memory because this is a really interesting idea. How do a collection of cells</p>
<p>remember anything? How do biological systems remember anything? How is that akin to the kind</p>
<p>of memory we think of humans as having within our big cognitive engine?</p>
<p>Yeah. One of the ways to start thinking about bioelectricity is to ask ourselves, where did</p>
<p>neurons and all these cool tricks that the brain uses to run these amazing problem solving abilities</p>
<p>on and basically an electrical network, right? Where did that come from? They didn&rsquo;t just evolve,</p>
<p>you know, appear out of nowhere. It must have evolved from something. And what it evolved from</p>
<p>was a much more ancient ability of cells to form networks to solve other kinds of problems. For</p>
<p>example, to navigate more for space to control the body shape. And so all of the components</p>
<p>of neurons, so ion channels, neurotransmitter machinery, electrical synapses, all this stuff</p>
<p>is way older than brains, way older than neurons, in fact, older than multicellularity. And so</p>
<p>it was already that even bacterial biofilms, there&rsquo;s some beautiful work from UCSD on brain</p>
<p>like dynamics and bacterial biofilms. So evolution figured out very early on that electrical networks</p>
<p>are amazing at having memories, at integrating information across distance, at different kinds</p>
<p>of optimization tasks, you know, image recognition and so on, long before there were brains.</p>
<p>Can you actually just step back? We&rsquo;ll return to it. What is bioelectricity? What is biochemistry?</p>
<p>What is, what are electrical networks? I think a lot of the biology community focuses on</p>
<p>the chemicals as the signaling mechanisms that make the whole thing work. You have, I think,</p>
<p>to a large degree, uniquely, maybe you can correct me on that, have focused on the bioelectricity,</p>
<p>which is using electricity for signaling. There&rsquo;s also probably mechanical. Sure, sure. Like knocking</p>
<p>on the door. So what&rsquo;s the difference? And what&rsquo;s an electrical network? Yeah, so I want to make</p>
<p>sure and kind of give credit where credit is due. So as far back as 1903, and probably late 1800s</p>
<p>already, people were thinking about the importance of electrical phenomena in life. So I&rsquo;m for sure</p>
<p>not the first person to stress the importance of electricity. People, there were waves of research</p>
<p>in the in the 30s, in the 40s, and then, again, in the kind of 70s, 80s, and 90s of sort of the</p>
<p>pioneers of bioelectricity, who did some amazing work on all this, I think, I think what what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done that&rsquo;s new, is to step away from this idea that, and I&rsquo;ll describe what what the</p>
<p>bioelectricity is a step away from the idea that, well, here&rsquo;s another piece of physics that you</p>
<p>need to keep track of to understand physiology and development. And to really start looking at this</p>
<p>as saying, no, this is a privileged computational layer that gives you access to the actual</p>
<p>cognition of the tissue of basal cognition. So, so merging that that developmental biophysics with</p>
<p>ideas and cognition of computation, and so on, I think I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve done that&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>But people have been talking about bioelectricity for a really long time. And so I&rsquo;ll, so I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>define that. So what happens is that if you have, if you have a single cell, cell has a membrane,</p>
<p>in that membrane are proteins called ion channels, and those proteins allow charged molecules,</p>
<p>potassium, sodium, chloride, to go in and out under certain circumstances. And when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an imbalance of of those ions, there becomes a voltage gradient across that membrane. And so</p>
<p>all cells, all living cells try to hold a particular kind of voltage difference across</p>
<p>the membrane, and they spend a lot of energy to do so. When you now now, so that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a single cell. When you have multiple cells, the cells sitting next to each other,</p>
<p>they can communicate their voltage state to each other via a number of different ways. But one of</p>
<p>them is this thing called a gap junction, which is basically like a little submarine hatch that</p>
<p>just kind of docks, right? And the ions from one side can flow to the other side, and vice versa.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it incredible that this evolved? Isn&rsquo;t that wild? Because that didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Correct. This had to be, this had to be evolved.</p>
<p>It had to be invented.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Somebody invented electricity in the ocean. When did this get invented?</p>
<p>Yeah. So, I mean, it is incredible. The guy who discovered gap junctions,</p>
<p>Werner Loewenstein, I visited him. He was really old.</p>
<p>A human being?</p>
<p>He discovered them.</p>
<p>Because who really discovered them lived probably four billion years ago.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>So you give credit where credit is due, I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>He rediscovered gap junctions. But when I visited him in Woods Hole, maybe 20 years ago now,</p>
<p>he told me that he was writing, and unfortunately, he passed away, and I think this book never got</p>
<p>written. He was writing a book on gap junctions and consciousness. And I think it would have been</p>
<p>an incredible book, because gap junctions are magic. I&rsquo;ll explain why in a minute.</p>
<p>What happens is that, just imagine, the thing about both these ion channels and these gap</p>
<p>junctions is that many of them are themselves voltage sensitive. So that&rsquo;s a voltage sensitive</p>
<p>current conductance. That&rsquo;s a transistor. And as soon as you&rsquo;ve invented one, immediately,</p>
<p>you now get access to, from this platonic space of mathematical truths, you get access to all of the</p>
<p>cool things that transistors do. So now, when you have a network of cells, not only do they talk to</p>
<p>each other, but they can send messages to each other, and the differences of voltage can propagate.</p>
<p>Now, to neuroscientists, this is old hat, because you see this in the brain, right? This action</p>
<p>potentials, the electricity. They have these awesome movies where you can take a zebra,</p>
<p>like a transparent animal, like a zebrafish, and you can literally look down, and you can see all</p>
<p>the firings as the fish is making decisions about what to eat and things like this. It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Well, your whole body is doing that all the time, just much slower. So there are very few things</p>
<p>that neurons do that all the cells in your body don&rsquo;t do. They all do very similar things, just</p>
<p>on a much slower timescale. And whereas your brain is thinking about how to solve problems in</p>
<p>three dimensional space, the cells in an embryo are thinking about how to solve problems in</p>
<p>anatomical space. They&rsquo;re trying to have memories like, hey, how many fingers are we supposed to</p>
<p>have? Well, how many do we have now? What do we do to get from here to there? That&rsquo;s the kind of</p>
<p>problems they&rsquo;re thinking about. And the reason that gap junctions are magic is, imagine, right,</p>
<p>from the earliest time. Here are two cells. This cell, how can they communicate? Well,</p>
<p>the simple version is this cell could send a chemical signal, it floats over, and it hits</p>
<p>a receptor on this cell, right? Because it comes from outside, this cell can very easily tell that</p>
<p>that came from outside. Whatever information is coming, that&rsquo;s not my information. That information</p>
<p>is coming from the outside. So I can trust it, I can ignore it, I can do various things with it,</p>
<p>I can do various things with it, whatever, but I know it comes from the outside. Now imagine</p>
<p>instead that you have two cells with a gap junction between them. Something happens,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say this cell gets poked, there&rsquo;s a calcium spike, the calcium spike or whatever small</p>
<p>molecule signal propagates through the gap junction to this cell. There&rsquo;s no ownership</p>
<p>metadata on that signal. This cell does not know now that it came from outside because it looks</p>
<p>exactly like its own memories would have looked like of whatever had happened, right? So gap</p>
<p>junctions to some extent wipe ownership information on data, which means that if I can&rsquo;t, if you and</p>
<p>I are sharing memories and we can&rsquo;t quite tell who the memories belong to, that&rsquo;s the beginning of a</p>
<p>mind melt. That&rsquo;s the beginning of a scale up of cognition from here&rsquo;s me and here&rsquo;s you to no,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s just us. So they enforce a collective intelligence gap junctions. That&rsquo;s right. It</p>
<p>helps. It&rsquo;s the beginning. It&rsquo;s not the whole story by any means, but it&rsquo;s the start.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s state stored of the system? Is it in part in the gap junctions themselves? Is it in the</p>
<p>cells? There are many, many layers to this as always in biology. So there are chemical networks.</p>
<p>So for example, gene regulatory networks, right? Which, or basically any kind of chemical pathway</p>
<p>where different chemicals activate and repress each other, they can store memories. So in a</p>
<p>dynamical system sense, they can store memories. They can get into stable states that are hard to</p>
<p>pull them out of. So that becomes, once they get in, that&rsquo;s a memory, a permanent memory or a</p>
<p>semi permanent memory of something that&rsquo;s happened. There are cytoskeletal structures that are</p>
<p>physically, they store memories in physical configuration. There are electrical memories</p>
<p>like flip flops where there is no physical. So if you look, I showed my students this example</p>
<p>as a flip flop. And the reason that it stores a zero one is not because some piece of the hardware</p>
<p>moved. It&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a cycling of the current in one side of the thing. If I come over</p>
<p>and I hold the other side to a high voltage for a brief period of time, it flips over and now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>here. But none of the hardware moved. The information is in a stable dynamical sense. And</p>
<p>if you were to x ray the thing, you couldn&rsquo;t tell me if it was zero or one, because all you would</p>
<p>see is where the hardware is. You wouldn&rsquo;t see the energetic state of the system. So there are</p>
<p>bioelectrical states that are held in that exact way, like volatile ram basically, like in the</p>
<p>electrical state. It&rsquo;s very akin to the different ways that memory is stored in a computer.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s ram, there&rsquo;s hard drive. You can make that mapping, right? So I think the interesting</p>
<p>thing is that based on the biology, we can have a more sophisticated, you know, I think we can</p>
<p>revise some of our computer engineering methods because there are some interesting things that</p>
<p>biology we haven&rsquo;t done yet. But that mapping is not bad. I mean, I think it works in many ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder because I mean, the way we build computers at the root of computer science is the</p>
<p>idea of proof of correctness. We program things to be perfect, reliable. You know, this idea of</p>
<p>resilience and robustness to unknown conditions is not as important. So that&rsquo;s what biology is really</p>
<p>good at. So I don&rsquo;t know what kind of systems. I don&rsquo;t know how we go from a computer to a</p>
<p>biological system in the future. Yeah, I think that, you know, the thing about biology is all</p>
<p>about making really important decisions really quickly on very limited information. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what biology is all about. You have to act, you have to act now. The stakes are very high,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know most of what you need to know to be perfect. And so there&rsquo;s not even an attempt</p>
<p>to be perfect or to get it right in any sense. There are just things like active inference,</p>
<p>minimize surprise, optimize some efficiency and some things like this that guides the whole</p>
<p>business. I mentioned too offline that somebody who&rsquo;s a fan of your work is Andre Kapathy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s, amongst many things, also writes occasionally a great blog. He came up with</p>
<p>this idea, I don&rsquo;t know if he coined the term, but of software 2.0, where the programming is</p>
<p>done in the space of configuring these artificial neural networks. Is there some sense in which that</p>
<p>would be the future of programming for us humans, where we&rsquo;re less doing like Python like programming</p>
<p>and more&hellip; How would that look like? But basically doing the hyperparameters of something</p>
<p>akin to a biological system and watching it go and adjusting it and creating some kind of feedback</p>
<p>loop within the system so it corrects itself. And then we watch it over time accomplish the goals</p>
<p>we want it to accomplish. Is that kind of the dream of the dogs that you described in the Nature</p>
<p>paper? Yeah. I mean, that&rsquo;s what you just painted is a very good description of our efforts at</p>
<p>regenerative medicine as a kind of somatic psychiatry. So the idea is that you&rsquo;re not trying</p>
<p>to micromanage. I mean, think about the limitations of a lot of the medicines today. We try to</p>
<p>interact down at the level of pathways. So we&rsquo;re trying to micromanage it. What&rsquo;s the problem? Well,</p>
<p>one problem is that for almost every medicine other than antibiotics, once you stop it, the</p>
<p>problem comes right back. You haven&rsquo;t fixed anything. You were addressing symptoms. You</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t actually curing anything, again, except for antibiotics. That&rsquo;s one problem. The other</p>
<p>problem is you have massive amount of side effects because you were trying to interact at the lowest</p>
<p>level. It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to try to program this computer by changing the melting point of</p>
<p>copper. Maybe you can do things that way, but my God, it&rsquo;s hard to program at the hardware level.</p>
<p>So what I think we&rsquo;re starting to understand is that, and by the way, this goes back to what you</p>
<p>were saying before about that we could have access to our internal state. So people who practice that</p>
<p>kind of stuff, so yoga and biofeedback and those, those are all the people that uniformly will say</p>
<p>things like, well, the body has an intelligence and this and that. Those two sets overlap perfectly</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s exactly right. Because once you start thinking about it that way, you realize that</p>
<p>the better locus of control is not always at the lowest level. This is why we don&rsquo;t all program</p>
<p>with a soldering iron. We take advantage of the high level intelligences that are there,</p>
<p>intelligences that are there, which means trying to figure out, okay, which of your tissues can</p>
<p>learn? What can they learn? Why is it that certain drugs stop working after you take them for a while</p>
<p>with this habituation, right? And so can we understand habituation, sensitization, associative</p>
<p>learning, these kinds of things in chemical pathways? We&rsquo;re going to have a completely</p>
<p>different way. I think we&rsquo;re going to have a completely different way of using drugs and of</p>
<p>medicine in general when we start focusing on the goal states and on the intelligence of our</p>
<p>subsystems as opposed to treating everything as if the only path was micromanagement from</p>
<p>chemistry upwards. Well, can you speak to this idea of somatic psychiatry? What are somatic cells?</p>
<p>How do they form networks that use bioelectricity to have memory and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Yeah. What are somatic cells like basics here? Somatic cells just means the cells of your body.</p>
<p>Soma just means body, right? So somatic cells are just the&hellip; I&rsquo;m not even specifically making a</p>
<p>distinction between somatic cells and stem cells or anything like that. I mean, basically all the</p>
<p>cells in your body, not just neurons, but all the cells in your body. They form electrical</p>
<p>networks during embryogenesis, during regeneration. What those networks are doing</p>
<p>in part is processing information about what our current shape is and what the goal shape is.</p>
<p>Now, how do I know this? Because I can give you a couple of examples. One example is when we started</p>
<p>studying this, we said, okay, here&rsquo;s a planarian. A planarian is a flatworm. It has one head and one</p>
<p>tail normally. And the amazing&hellip; There&rsquo;s several amazing things about planaria, but basically they</p>
<p>kind of&hellip; I think planaria hold the answer to pretty much every deep question of life.</p>
<p>For one thing, they&rsquo;re similar to our ancestors. So they have true symmetry. They have a true</p>
<p>brain. They&rsquo;re not like earthworms. They&rsquo;re a much more advanced life form. They have lots</p>
<p>of different internal organs, but they&rsquo;re these little&hellip; They&rsquo;re about maybe two centimeters in</p>
<p>the centimeter to two in size. They have a head and a tail. And the first thing is planaria are</p>
<p>immortal. So they do not age. There&rsquo;s no such thing as an old planarian. So that right there</p>
<p>tells you that these theories of thermodynamic limitations on lifespan are wrong. It&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>well over time everything degrades. No, planaria can keep it going for probably how long have</p>
<p>they been around 400 million years. So the planaria in our lab are actually in physical</p>
<p>continuity with planaria that were here 400 million years ago. So there&rsquo;s planaria that</p>
<p>have lived that long essentially. What does it mean physical continuity? Because what they do</p>
<p>is they split in half. The way they reproduce is they split in half. So the planaria, the back end</p>
<p>grabs the petri dish, the front end takes off and they rip themselves in half. But isn&rsquo;t it some</p>
<p>sense where like you are a physical continuation? Yes, except that we go through a bottleneck of one</p>
<p>cell, which is the egg. They do not. I mean, they can. There&rsquo;s certain planaria. Got it. So we go</p>
<p>through a very ruthless compression process and they don&rsquo;t. Yes. Like an auto encoder, you know,</p>
<p>sort of squashed down to one cell and then back out. These guys just tear themselves in half.</p>
<p>And so the other amazing thing about them is they regenerate. So you can cut them into pieces.</p>
<p>The record is, I think, 276 or something like that by Thomas Hunt Morgan. And each piece regrows a</p>
<p>perfect little worm. They know exactly, every piece knows exactly what&rsquo;s missing, what needs</p>
<p>to happen. In fact, if you chop it in half, as it grows the other half, the original tissue shrinks</p>
<p>so that when the new tiny head shows up, they&rsquo;re proportional. So it keeps perfect proportion.</p>
<p>If you starve them, they shrink. If you feed them again, they expand. Their control,</p>
<p>their anatomical control is just insane. Somebody cut them into over 200 pieces.</p>
<p>Yeah. Thomas Hunt Morgan did. Hashtag science. Amazing. And maybe more. I mean,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have antibiotics back then. I bet he lost some due to infection. I bet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually more than that. I bet you could do more than that. Humans can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Well, yes. I mean, again, true, except that&hellip; Maybe you can at the embryonic level.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing, right? So when I talk about this, I say, just remember that</p>
<p>as amazing as it is to grow a whole planarian from a tiny fragment,</p>
<p>half of the human population can grow a full body from one cell. So development is really,</p>
<p>you can look at development as just an example of regeneration.</p>
<p>Yeah. To think, we&rsquo;ll talk about regenerative medicine, but there&rsquo;s some sense of what would</p>
<p>be like that warm in like 500 years where I can just go regrow a hand.</p>
<p>Yep. With given time, it takes time to grow large things.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. I think.</p>
<p>You can probably&hellip; Why not accelerate? Oh, biology takes its time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say anything is impossible, but I don&rsquo;t know of a way to accelerate these</p>
<p>processes. I think it&rsquo;s possible. I think we are going to be regenerative, but I don&rsquo;t know of a</p>
<p>way to make it faster.</p>
<p>I could just think people from a few centuries from now would be like, well, they used to have</p>
<p>to wait a week for the hand to regrow. It&rsquo;s like when the microwave was invented. You can toast</p>
<p>your&hellip; What&rsquo;s that called when you put a cheese on a toast? It&rsquo;s delicious is all I know. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>blanking. Anywho. All right. So planaria, why were we talking about the magical planaria that they</p>
<p>have the mystery of life?</p>
<p>Yeah. So the reason we&rsquo;re talking about planaria is not only are they immortal,</p>
<p>not only do they regenerate every part of the body, they generally don&rsquo;t get cancer,</p>
<p>which we can talk about why that&rsquo;s important. They&rsquo;re smart. They can learn things. You can</p>
<p>train them. And it turns out that if you train a planaria and then cut their heads off, the tail</p>
<p>will regenerate a brand new brain that still remembers the original information.</p>
<p>Do they have a biological network going on or no?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So their somatic cells are forming a network. And that&rsquo;s what you mean by a true brain? What&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>requirement for a true brain?</p>
<p>Like everything else, it&rsquo;s a continuum, but a true brain has certain characteristics as far as the</p>
<p>density, like a localized density of neurons that guides behavior.</p>
<p>In the head.</p>
<p>Exactly. Exactly. If you cut their head off, the tail doesn&rsquo;t do anything. It just sits there</p>
<p>until a new brain regenerates. They have all the same neurotransmitters that you and I have.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re talking about them in this context. So here&rsquo;s your planaria. You cut off the</p>
<p>head. You cut off the tail. You have a middle fragment. That middle fragment has to make one</p>
<p>head and one tail. How does it know how many of each to make? And where do they go? How come it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t switch? How come, right? So we did a very simple thing. And we said, okay, let&rsquo;s make the</p>
<p>hypothesis that there&rsquo;s a somatic electrical network that remembers the correct pattern,</p>
<p>and that what it&rsquo;s doing is recalling that memory and building to that pattern.</p>
<p>So what we did was we used a way to visualize electrical activity in these cells, right? It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>variant of what people used to look for electricity in the brain. And we saw that that fragment has a</p>
<p>very particular electrical pattern. You can literally see it once we developed the technique.</p>
<p>It has a very particular electrical pattern that shows you where the head and the tail goes,</p>
<p>right? You can just see it. And then we said, okay, well now let&rsquo;s test the idea that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a memory that actually controls where the head and the tail goes. Let&rsquo;s change that pattern. So</p>
<p>basically, incept the false memory. And so what you can do is you can do that in many different</p>
<p>ways. One way is with drugs that target ion channels to say, and so you pick these drugs</p>
<p>and you say, okay, I&rsquo;m going to do it so that instead of this one head, one tail electrical</p>
<p>pattern, you have a two headed pattern, right? You&rsquo;re just editing the electrical information</p>
<p>in the network. When you do that, guess what the cells build? They build a two headed worm.</p>
<p>And the coolest thing about it, no genetic changes. So we haven&rsquo;t touched the genome.</p>
<p>The genome is totally wild type. But the amazing thing about it is that when you take these two</p>
<p>headed animals and you cut them into pieces again, some of those pieces will continue to</p>
<p>make two headed animals. So that information, that memory, that electrical circuit, not only does it</p>
<p>hold the information for how many heads, not only does it use that information to tell the cells</p>
<p>what to do to regenerate, but it stores it. Once you&rsquo;ve reset it, it keeps. And we can go back,</p>
<p>we can take a two headed animal and put it back to one headed. So now imagine, so there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>of interesting things here that that have implications for understanding what genomes</p>
<p>and things like that. Imagine I take this two headed animal. Oh, and by the way, when they</p>
<p>reproduce, when they tear themselves in half, you still get two headed animals. So imagine I take</p>
<p>them and I throw them in the Charles River over here. So 100 years later, some scientists come</p>
<p>along and they scoop up some samples and they go, oh, there&rsquo;s a single headed form and a two headed</p>
<p>form. Wow, a speciation event. Cool. Let&rsquo;s sequence the genome and see why, what happened. The genomes</p>
<p>are identical. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the genome. So if you ask the question, how does,</p>
<p>so, so this goes back to your very first question is where do body plans come from, right? How does</p>
<p>the planarian know how many heads it&rsquo;s supposed to have? Now it&rsquo;s interesting because you could</p>
<p>say DNA, but what happened, what, what, as it turns out, the DNA produces a piece of hardware</p>
<p>that by default says one head the way that when you turn on a calculator, by default, it&rsquo;s a zero</p>
<p>every single time, right? When you turn it on, it just says zero, but it&rsquo;s a programmable calculator</p>
<p>as it turns out. So once you&rsquo;ve changed that next time, it won&rsquo;t say zero. It&rsquo;ll say something else</p>
<p>and the same thing here. So you can make, you can make one headed, two headed, you can make no</p>
<p>headed worms. We&rsquo;ve done some other things along these lines, some other really weird constructs.</p>
<p>So, so this, this, this, this question of, right. So again, it&rsquo;s really important. The, the hardware</p>
<p>software distinction is really important because the hardware is essential because without proper</p>
<p>hardware, you&rsquo;re never going to get to the right physiology of having that memory. But once you</p>
<p>have it, it doesn&rsquo;t fully determine what the information is going to be. You can have other</p>
<p>information in there and it&rsquo;s reprogrammable by us, by bacteria, by various parasites, probably</p>
<p>things like that. The other amazing thing about these planarias, think about this, most animals,</p>
<p>when we get a mutation in our bodies, our children don&rsquo;t inherit it, right? So you can go on, you</p>
<p>could run around for 50, 60 years getting mutations. Your children don&rsquo;t have those mutations</p>
<p>because we go through the egg stage. Planaria tear themselves in half and that&rsquo;s how they reproduce.</p>
<p>So for 400 million years, they keep every mutation that they&rsquo;ve had that doesn&rsquo;t kill the cell that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in. So when you look at these planaria, their bodies are what&rsquo;s called mixoploid, meaning that</p>
<p>every cell might have a different number of chromosomes. They look like a tumor. If you look</p>
<p>at the, the, the, the, the genome is an incredible mess because they accumulate all this stuff.</p>
<p>And yet the, their body structure is, they are the best regenerators on the planet. Their anatomy is</p>
<p>rock solid, even though their genome is always all kinds of crap. So this is a kind of a scandal,</p>
<p>right? That, you know, when we learn that, well, you know, what are genomes to what genomes determine</p>
<p>your body? Okay. Why is the animal with the worst genome have the best anatomical control, the most</p>
<p>cancer resistant, the most regenerative, right? Really, we&rsquo;re just beginning to start to understand</p>
<p>this relationship between the, the genomically determined hardware and, and, and by the way,</p>
<p>just as of, as of a couple of months ago, I think I now somewhat understand why this is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s really a major, you know, a major puzzle.</p>
<p>I mean, that really throws a wrench into the whole nature versus nurture because you usually</p>
<p>associate electricity with the, with the nurture and the hardware with the nature.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s just this weird integrated mess that propagates through generations.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s much more fluid. It&rsquo;s much more complex. You can, you can imagine what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening here is just, just imagine the evolution of a, of a, of an animal like this,</p>
<p>that, that multi scale, this goes back to this multi scale competency, right? Imagine that you</p>
<p>have two, two, two, you have, you have an animal that that where its, its tissues have some degree</p>
<p>of multi scale competency. So for example, if the like, like we saw in the tadpole, you know,</p>
<p>if you put an eye on its tail, they can still see out of that eye, right? That the, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all, there&rsquo;s incredible plasticity. So if you have an animal and it comes up for selection</p>
<p>and the fitness is quite good, evolution doesn&rsquo;t know whether the fitness is good because the</p>
<p>genome was awesome or because the genome was kind of junky, but, but the competency made up for it,</p>
<p>right? And things kind of ended up good. So what that means is that the more competency you have,</p>
<p>the harder it is for selection to pick the best genomes, it hides information, right? And so that</p>
<p>means that, so, so what happens, you know, evolution basically starts all those start,</p>
<p>all the hard work is being done to increase the competency because it&rsquo;s harder and harder to see</p>
<p>the genomes. And so I think in planaria, what happened is that there&rsquo;s this runaway phenomenon</p>
<p>where all the effort went into the algorithm such that we know you got a crappy genome. We can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep, we can&rsquo;t clean up the genome. We can&rsquo;t keep track of it. So what&rsquo;s going to happen is what</p>
<p>survives are the algorithms that can create a great worm no matter what the genome is. So</p>
<p>everything went into the algorithm and which, which of course then reduces the pressure on</p>
<p>keeping a, you know, keeping a clean genome. So this idea of, right, and different animals have</p>
<p>this in different, to different levels, but this idea of putting energy into an algorithm that</p>
<p>does not overtrain on priors, right? It can&rsquo;t assume, I mean, I think biology is this way in</p>
<p>general, evolution doesn&rsquo;t take the past too seriously because it makes these basically</p>
<p>problem solving machines as opposed to like exactly what, you know, to, to, to deal with</p>
<p>exactly what happened last time. Yeah. Problem solving versus memory recall. So a little memory,</p>
<p>but a lot of problem solving. I think so. Yeah. In many cases, yeah. Problem solving.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible that those kinds of systems are able to be constructed,</p>
<p>um, especially how much they contrast with the way we build problem solving systems in the AI world.</p>
<p>Um, back to Xenobots. I&rsquo;m not sure if we ever described how Xenobots are built, but</p>
<p>I mean, you have a paper titled biological robots perspectives on an emerging interdisciplinary</p>
<p>field. And the beginning you, uh, you mentioned that the word Xenobots is like controversial.</p>
<p>Do you guys get in trouble for using Xenobots or what? Do people not like the word Xenobots?</p>
<p>Are you trying to be provocative with the word Xenobots versus biological robots?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Is there some drama that we should be aware of? There&rsquo;s a little bit of drama. Uh,</p>
<p>I think, I think the drama is basically related to people, um, having very fixed ideas about what</p>
<p>terms mean. And I think in many cases, these ideas are completely out of date with, with where science</p>
<p>is now. And for sure they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re out of date with what&rsquo;s going to be, I mean, these, these,</p>
<p>these concepts, uh, are not going to survive the next couple of decades. So if you ask a person</p>
<p>and including, um, you know, a lot of people in biology who kind of want to keep a sharp</p>
<p>distinction between biologicals and robots, right? See, what&rsquo;s a robot? Well, a robot,</p>
<p>it comes out of a factory. It&rsquo;s made by humans. It is boring. It is a meaning that you can predict</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s going to do. It&rsquo;s made of metal and certain other inorganic materials. Living</p>
<p>organisms are magical. They, they, they arise, right? And so on. So these, these distinctions,</p>
<p>I think these, these distinctions, I think were, were never good, but, uh, they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>completely useless going forward. And so part of, there&rsquo;s a couple of papers that that&rsquo;s one paper</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s another one that Josh Bongar and I wrote where we really attack the terminology.</p>
<p>And we say these binary categories are based on very, um, nonessential kind of surface, uh,</p>
<p>limitations of, of technology and imagination that were true before, but they&rsquo;ve got to go. And so,</p>
<p>and so we call them Zenobots. So, so Xeno for Xenopus Levus, where this is, it&rsquo;s the frog that,</p>
<p>that these guys are made of, but we think it&rsquo;s an example of, of, of, uh, of a biobot technology,</p>
<p>because ultimately if we, if we under, once we understand how to, uh, communicate and manipulate,</p>
<p>um, the inputs to these cells, we will be able to get them to build whatever we want them to build.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s robotics, right? It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the rational construction of machines that have</p>
<p>useful purposes. I, I absolutely think that this is a robotics platform, whereas some biologists</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s built in a way that, uh, all the different components are doing their own computation.</p>
<p>So in a way that we&rsquo;ve been talking about, so you&rsquo;re trying to do top down control in that</p>
<p>biological system. And in the future, all of this will, will, will merge together because</p>
<p>of course at some point we&rsquo;re going to throw in synthetic biology circuits, right? New, new, um,</p>
<p>you know, new transcriptional circuits to get them to do new things. Of course we&rsquo;ll throw some of</p>
<p>that in, but we specifically stayed away from all of that because in the first few papers,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some more coming down the pike that are, I think going to be pretty, pretty dynamite,</p>
<p>um, that, uh, we want to show what the native cells are made of. Because what happens is,</p>
<p>you know, if you engineer the heck out of them, right, if we were to put in new, you know,</p>
<p>new transcription factors and some new metabolic machinery and whatever, people will say, well,</p>
<p>okay, you engineered this and you made it do whatever. And fine. I wanted to show, uh, and,</p>
<p>and, and the whole team, uh, wanted to show the plasticity and the intelligence in the biology.</p>
<p>What does it do that&rsquo;s surprising before you even start manipulating the hardware in that way?</p>
<p>Yeah. Don&rsquo;t try to, uh, over control the thing. Let it flourish. The, the full beauty of the</p>
<p>biological system. Why Xenopus Levus? How do you pronounce it? The frog.</p>
<p>Xenopus Levus. Yeah. Yeah. It&rsquo;s a very popular.</p>
<p>Why this frog?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been used since, uh, I think the fifties. Uh, it&rsquo;s just very convenient because you can,</p>
<p>you know, we, we keep the adults in this, in this, uh, very fine frog habitat. They lay eggs. They</p>
<p>lay tens of thousands of eggs at a time. Um, the eggs develop right in front of your eyes. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most mad magical thing you can, you can see because normally, you know, if you were to deal</p>
<p>with mice or rabbits or whatever, you don&rsquo;t see the early stages, right? Cause everything&rsquo;s inside</p>
<p>the mother. Everything&rsquo;s in a Petri dish at room temperature. So you just, you, you have an egg,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fertilized and you can just watch it divide and divide and divide. And on all the organs</p>
<p>form, you can just see it. And at that point, um, the community has, has developed lots of</p>
<p>different tools for understanding what&rsquo;s going on and also for, for manipulating, right? So it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people use it for, um, you know, for understanding birth defects and neurobiology</p>
<p>and cancer immunology. So you get the whole, uh, embryogenesis in the Petri dish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool to watch. Is there videos of this? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but yeah, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s amazing videos on, on, online. I mean, mammalian embryos are super cool</p>
<p>too. For example, monozygotic twins are what happens when you cut a mammalian embryo in half.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get two half bodies. You get two perfectly normal bodies because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>regeneration event, right? Development is just the, it&rsquo;s just the kind of regeneration really.</p>
<p>And why this particular frog? It&rsquo;s just, uh, cause they were doing in the fifties and.</p>
<p>It breeds well in, um, you know, in, in, it&rsquo;s easy to raise in, in the laboratory and, uh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very prolific and all the tools basically for decades, people have been developing tools.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other, some people use other frogs, but I have to say this is, this is, this is important.</p>
<p>Xenobots are fundamentally not anything about frogs. So, um, I can&rsquo;t say too much about this</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s not published and peer reviewed yet, but we&rsquo;ve made Xenobots out of other things that</p>
<p>have nothing to do with frogs. It&rsquo;s, this is not a frog phenomenon. This is, we, we started with</p>
<p>frog because it&rsquo;s so convenient, but this, this, this plasticity is not a fraud. You know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not related to the fact that they&rsquo;re frogs. What happens when you kiss it? Does it turn</p>
<p>into a prince? No. Or a princess? Which way? Uh, prince. Yeah. Prince should be a prince.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, that&rsquo;s an experiment that I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve done. And if we have, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to collaborate, I can, I can take on the lead, uh, on that effort. Okay, cool. Uh,</p>
<p>how does the cells coordinate? Let&rsquo;s focus in on just the embryogenesis. So there&rsquo;s one cell,</p>
<p>so it divides, doesn&rsquo;t have to be very careful about what each cell starts doing once they divide.</p>
<p>Yes. And like, when there&rsquo;s three of them, it&rsquo;s like the cofounders or whatever,</p>
<p>like, well, like slow down, you&rsquo;re responsible for this. When do they become specialized and</p>
<p>how do they coordinate that specialization? So, so this is the basic science of developmental</p>
<p>biology. There&rsquo;s a lot known about all of that, but, um, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think is kind</p>
<p>of the most important part, which is, yes, it&rsquo;s very important who does what. However,</p>
<p>because going back to this issue of why I made this claim that, um, biology doesn&rsquo;t take the past</p>
<p>too seriously. And what I mean by that is it doesn&rsquo;t assume that everything is the way it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s expected to be. Right. And here&rsquo;s an example of that. Um, this was, this was done, this was,</p>
<p>this was an old experiment going back to the forties, but, um, basically imagine imagine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new salamander and it&rsquo;s got these little tube tubules that go to the kidneys, right? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little tube. Take a cross section of that tube. You see eight to 10 cells that have</p>
<p>cooperated to make this little tube in cross section, right? So one amazing, one amazing</p>
<p>thing you can do is, um, you can, you can mess with a very early cell division to make the cells</p>
<p>gigantic, bigger. You can, you can make them different sizes. You can force them to be different</p>
<p>sizes. So if you make the cells different sizes, the whole nude is still the same size.</p>
<p>So if you take a cross section through the, through that tubule, instead of eight to 10</p>
<p>cells, you might have four or five or you might have, you know, three until you make the cells so</p>
<p>enormous that one single cell wraps around itself and, and gives you that same large scale structure</p>
<p>with a completely different molecular mechanism. So now instead of cell to cell communication to</p>
<p>make a tubule, instead of that, it&rsquo;s one cell using the cytoskeleton to bend itself around.</p>
<p>So think about what that means in the service of a large scale, talk about top down control,</p>
<p>right? In the service of a large scale anatomical feature, different molecular mechanisms get</p>
<p>called up. So now think about this, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re a nude cell and trying to make an embryo.</p>
<p>If you had a fixed idea of who was supposed to do what, you&rsquo;d be screwed because now your cells</p>
<p>are gigantic. Nothing would work. The, there&rsquo;s an incredible tolerance for changes in the size of</p>
<p>the parts and the amount of DNA in those parts. Um, all sorts of stuff you can, you can, the life</p>
<p>is highly interoperable. You can put electrodes in there and you can put weird nanomaterials. It</p>
<p>still works. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, uh, this is that problem solving action, right? It&rsquo;s able to do what it</p>
<p>needs to do, even when circumstances change. That is, you know, the hallmark of intelligence,</p>
<p>right? William James defined intelligence as the ability to get to the same goal by different</p>
<p>means. That&rsquo;s this, you get to the same goal by completely different means. And so, so,</p>
<p>so why am I bringing this up is just to say that, yeah, it&rsquo;s important for the cells to do the right</p>
<p>stuff, but they have incredible tolerances for things not being what you expect and to still</p>
<p>get their job done. So if you&rsquo;re, you know, um, all of these things are not hardwired.</p>
<p>There are organisms that might be hardwired. For example, the nematode C elegans in that organism,</p>
<p>every cell is numbered, meaning that every C elegans has exactly the same number of cells</p>
<p>as every other C elegans. They&rsquo;re all in the same place. They all divide. There&rsquo;s literally a map</p>
<p>of how it works that in that, in that sort of system, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s much more cookie cutter,</p>
<p>but, but most, most organisms are incredibly plastic in that way. Is there something particularly</p>
<p>magical to you about the whole developmental biology process? Um, is there something you</p>
<p>could say, cause you just said it, they&rsquo;re very good at accomplishing the goal of the job they</p>
<p>need to do the competency thing, but you get fricking organism from one cell. It&rsquo;s like, uh,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very hard, hard to intuit that whole process to even think about reverse engineering</p>
<p>that process. Right. Very hard to the point where I often just imagine, I, I sometimes ask my</p>
<p>students to do this thought experiment. Imagine you were, you were shrunk down to the, to the scale</p>
<p>of a single cell and you were in the middle of an embryo and you were looking around at what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on and the cells running around, some cells are dying at the, you know, every time you look,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a different number of cells for most organisms. And so I think that if you didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what embryonic development was, you would have no clue that what you&rsquo;re seeing is always going to</p>
<p>make the same thing. Nevermind knowing what that, what that is. Nevermind being able to say, even</p>
<p>with full genomic information, being able to say, what the hell are they building? We have no way</p>
<p>to do that. But, but just even to guess that, wow, the, the, the outcome of all this activity is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always going to be, it&rsquo;s always going to build the same thing. The imperative to create the final you</p>
<p>as you are now is there already. So you can, you would, so you start from the same embryo,</p>
<p>you create a very similar organism. Yeah. Except for cases like the Xenobots, when you give them</p>
<p>a different environment, they come up with a different way to be adaptive in that environment.</p>
<p>But overall, I mean, so, so I think, so I think to, you know, kind of summarize it,</p>
<p>I think what evolution is really good at is creating hardware that has a very stable baseline</p>
<p>mode, meaning that left to its own devices, it&rsquo;s very good at doing the same thing. But it has a</p>
<p>bunch of problem solving capacity such that if any, if any assumptions don&rsquo;t hold, if your cells are</p>
<p>a weird size, or you get the wrong number of cells, or there&rsquo;s a, you know, somebody stuck</p>
<p>in electrode halfway through the body, whatever, it will still get most of what it needs to do done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about the magic and the power of biology here. If we look at the human brain,</p>
<p>how special is the brain in this context? You&rsquo;re kind of minimizing the importance of the brain</p>
<p>or lessening its, we think of all the special computation happens in the brain,</p>
<p>everything else is like the help. You&rsquo;re kind of saying that the whole thing is the whole thing</p>
<p>is doing computation. But nevertheless, how special is the human brain in this full context of</p>
<p>biology? Yeah, I mean, look, there&rsquo;s no getting away from the fact that the human brain allows</p>
<p>us to do things that we could not do without it. You can say the same thing about the liver.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, this is this is true. And so and so, you know, I, my goal is not No, you&rsquo;re right. My goal</p>
<p>is just being polite to the brain right now. Well, being a politician, like, listen,</p>
<p>everybody has everybody has a role. Yeah, it&rsquo;s very important role. That&rsquo;s right. We have to</p>
<p>acknowledge the importance of the brain, you know, there are more than enough people who are</p>
<p>cheerleading the brain, right? So so I don&rsquo;t feel like nothing I say is going to reduce people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>excitement about the human brain. And so so I emphasize other things credit. I don&rsquo;t think it</p>
<p>gets too much credit. I think other things don&rsquo;t get enough credit. I think the brain is the human</p>
<p>brain is incredible and special and all that. I think other things need more credit. And and I</p>
<p>also think that this and I&rsquo;m sort of this way about everything. I don&rsquo;t like binary categories,</p>
<p>but almost anything I like a continuum. And the thing about the human brain is that it by by by</p>
<p>accepting that as some kind of an important category or essential, essential thing, we end</p>
<p>up with all kinds of weird pseudo problems and conundrum. So for example, when we talk about it,</p>
<p>you know, if you don&rsquo;t want to talk about ethics and other other things like that, and what you</p>
<p>know, this this idea that surely if we look out into the universe, surely, we don&rsquo;t believe that</p>
<p>this human brain is the only way to be sentient, right? Surely we don&rsquo;t, you know, and to have high</p>
<p>level cognition. I just can&rsquo;t even wrap my mind around this, this idea that that is the only way</p>
<p>to do it. No doubt there are other architectures made bond made of completely different principles</p>
<p>that achieve the same thing. And once we believe that, then that tells us something important. It</p>
<p>tells us that things that are not quite human brains or chimeras of human brains and other</p>
<p>tissue or human brains or other kinds of brains and novel configurations or things that are sort</p>
<p>of brains, but not really, or plants or embryos or whatever, might also have important cognitive</p>
<p>status. So that&rsquo;s the only thing I think we have to be really careful about treating the human</p>
<p>brain as if it was some kind of like sharp binary category. You know, you are or you aren&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe that exists. So when we look out at all the beautiful variety of human brains,</p>
<p>semi biological architectures out there in the universe, how many intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>do you think are out there? Boy, I have no expertise in that whatsoever. You haven&rsquo;t met</p>
<p>any? I have met the ones we&rsquo;ve made. I think that I mean, exactly. In some sense with synthetic</p>
<p>biology, are you not creating aliens? I absolutely think so because look, all of life,</p>
<p>all of all standard model systems are an end of one course of evolution on Earth, right? And trying</p>
<p>to make conclusions about biology from looking at life on Earth is like testing your theory on the</p>
<p>same data that generated it. It&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all kind of like locked in. So we absolutely have to</p>
<p>create novel examples that have no history on Earth that don&rsquo;t, you know, xenobots have no</p>
<p>history of selection to be a good xenobot. The cells have selection for various things, but the</p>
<p>xenobot itself never existed before. And so we can make chimeras, you know, we make frog a lottles</p>
<p>that are sort of half frog, half axolotl. You can make all sorts of high brats, right constructions</p>
<p>of living tissue with robots and whatever. We need to be making these things until we find actual</p>
<p>aliens, because otherwise, we&rsquo;re just looking at an end of one set of examples, all kinds of frozen</p>
<p>accidents of evolution and so on. We need to go beyond that to really understand biology. But</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still even when you do a synthetic biology, you&rsquo;re locked in to the basic components of the</p>
<p>way biology is done on this Earth. Yeah, right. And also, and the and also the basic constraints</p>
<p>of the environment, even artificial environments to construct in the lab are tied up to the</p>
<p>environment. I mean, what do you? Okay, let&rsquo;s say there is I mean, what I think is there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations living or dead out there.</p>
<p>If you pick one out of the box, what do you think it would look like? So in when you think about</p>
<p>synthetic biology, or creating synthetic organisms, how hard is it to create something that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>different? Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s very hard to create something that&rsquo;s very different, right? It&rsquo;s we</p>
<p>are just locked in both both both experimentally and in terms of our imagination, right? It&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard. And you also emphasize several times that the idea of shape. Yeah, the individual cell get</p>
<p>together with other cells and they kind of they&rsquo;re gonna build a shape. So it&rsquo;s shape and function,</p>
<p>but shape is a critical thing. Yeah. So here, I&rsquo;ll take a stab. I mean, I agree with you. I did</p>
<p>to whatever extent that we can say anything, I do think that there&rsquo;s, you know, probably an</p>
<p>infinite number of, of different different architectures with with that are with interesting</p>
<p>cognitive properties out there. What can we say about them? I think that the only things that are</p>
<p>going I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think we can rely on any of the typical stuff, you know, carbon based, none of</p>
<p>that. Like, I think all of that is just, you know, us being having having a lack of imagination. But</p>
<p>I think the things that are going to be universal, if anything is, are things, for example, driven by</p>
<p>resource limitation, the fact that you are fighting a hostile world, and you have to draw a</p>
<p>boundary between yourself and the world somewhere, the fact that that boundary is not given to you</p>
<p>by anybody, you have to you have to assume it, you know, estimated yourself. And the fact that</p>
<p>you have to course grain your experience and the fact that you&rsquo;re going to try to minimize surprise</p>
<p>and the fact that like these, these are the things that I think are fundamental about biology,</p>
<p>none of the, you know, the facts about the genetic code, or even the fact that we have genes or the</p>
<p>biochemistry of it, I don&rsquo;t think any of those things are fundamental. But it&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>lot more about the information and about the creation of the self, the fact that so in my in</p>
<p>my framework, selves are demarcated by the scale of the goals that they can pursue. So from little</p>
<p>tiny local goals to like massive, you know, planetary scale goals for certain humans,</p>
<p>and everything and everything in between. So you can draw this like cognitive light cone about</p>
<p>that determines the the scale of the goals you could possibly pursue. I think those kinds of</p>
<p>frameworks, like that, like active inference, and so on are going to be universally applicable,</p>
<p>but but none of the other things that are that are typically discussed. Quick pause,</p>
<p>do you need a bathroom break? We were just talking about, you know, aliens and all that. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny thing, which is, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen them, there&rsquo;s a kind of debate that goes on about</p>
<p>cognition and plants, and what can you say about different kinds of computation and cognition and</p>
<p>plants. And I always I always look at that something like if you&rsquo;re weirded out by cognition</p>
<p>and plants, you&rsquo;re not ready for exobiology, right? If you know something that&rsquo;s that similar</p>
<p>here on Earth is already like freaking you out, then I think there&rsquo;s going to be all kinds of</p>
<p>cognitive life out there that we&rsquo;re gonna have a really hard time recognizing. I think robots will</p>
<p>help us, yeah, like expand our mind about cognition, either that or the word like xenobots. So,</p>
<p>and they maybe becomes the same thing is, you know, really, when the human engineers,</p>
<p>the thing, at least in part, and then is able to achieve some kind of cognition that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than what you&rsquo;re used to, then you start to understand like, oh, you know, every living</p>
<p>organism is capable of cognition. Oh, I need to kind of broaden my understanding what cognition</p>
<p>is. But do you think plants, like when you when you eat them, are they screaming? I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about screaming. I think you have to see what I think when I eat a salad. Yeah, good. Yeah,</p>
<p>I think you have to scale down the expectations in terms of right, so probably they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>screaming in the way that we would be screaming. However, there&rsquo;s plenty of data on plants being</p>
<p>able to do anticipation and certain kinds of memory and so on. I think, you know, what you</p>
<p>just said about robots, I hope you&rsquo;re right. And I hope that&rsquo;s but there&rsquo;s two, there&rsquo;s two ways</p>
<p>that people can take that right. So one way is exactly what you just said to try to kind of</p>
<p>expand their expand their their their notions for that category. The other way people often go is</p>
<p>they just sort of define the term is if if if it&rsquo;s not a natural product, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just faking,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s not really intelligence if it was made by somebody else, because it&rsquo;s that same,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing. They can see how it&rsquo;s done. And once you see how it&rsquo;s like a magic trick,</p>
<p>when you see how it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s not as fun anymore. And and I think people have a real</p>
<p>tendency for that. And they sort of which which I find really strange in the sense that if somebody</p>
<p>said to me, we have this this this sort of blind, like, like, hill climbing search,</p>
<p>and then and then we have a really smart team of engineers, which one do you think is going to</p>
<p>produce a system that has good intelligence? I think it&rsquo;s really weird to say that it only</p>
<p>comes from the blind search, right? It can&rsquo;t be done by people who, by the way, can also use</p>
<p>evolutionary techniques if they want to, but also rational design. I think it&rsquo;s really weird to say</p>
<p>that real intelligence only comes from natural evolution. So I hope you&rsquo;re right. I hope people</p>
<p>take it the other the other way. But there&rsquo;s a nice shortcut. So I work with Lego robots a lot now</p>
<p>from for my own personal pleasure. Not in that way internet. So four legs. And one of the things</p>
<p>that changes my experience with the robots a lot is when I can&rsquo;t understand why I did a certain</p>
<p>thing. And there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to engineer that. Me, the person that created the software that runs</p>
<p>it. There&rsquo;s a lot of ways for me to build that software in such a way that I don&rsquo;t exactly know</p>
<p>why it did a certain basic decision. Of course, as an engineer, you can go in and start to look at</p>
<p>logs. You can log all kind of data, sensory data, the decisions you made, you know, all the outputs</p>
<p>in your networks and so on. But I also try to really experience that surprise and that really</p>
<p>experience as another person would that totally doesn&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s built. And I think the magic</p>
<p>is there in not knowing how it works. That I think biology does that for you through the layers of</p>
<p>abstraction. Yeah, it because nobody really knows what&rsquo;s going on inside the biological. Like each</p>
<p>one component is clueless about the big picture. I think there&rsquo;s actually really cheap systems that</p>
<p>can that can illustrate that kind of thing, which is even like, you know, fractals, right? Like,</p>
<p>you have a very small, short formula in Z, and you see it and there&rsquo;s no magic, you&rsquo;re just going to</p>
<p>crank through, you know, Z squared plus C, whatever, you&rsquo;re just going to crank through it. But the</p>
<p>result of it is this incredibly rich, beautiful image, right? That that just like, wow, all of</p>
<p>that was in this, like, 10 character long string, like amazing. So the fact that you can you can</p>
<p>know everything there is to know about the details and the process and all the parts and every like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s literally no magic of any kind there. And yet the outcome is something that you would never</p>
<p>have expected. And it&rsquo;s just it just, you know, is incredibly rich and complex and beautiful. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of that. You write that you work on developing conceptual frameworks for understanding</p>
<p>unconventional cognition. So the kind of thing we&rsquo;ve been talking about, I just like the term</p>
<p>unconventional cognition. And you want to figure out how to detect, study and communicate with</p>
<p>the thing. You&rsquo;ve already mentioned a few examples, but what is unconventional cognition? Is it as</p>
<p>simply as everything else outside of what we define usually as cognition, cognitive science,</p>
<p>the stuff going on between our ears? Or is there some deeper way to get at the fundamentals of</p>
<p>what is cognition? Yeah, I think like, and I&rsquo;m certainly not the only person who works in</p>
<p>unconventional, unconventional cognition. So it&rsquo;s the term used? Yeah, that&rsquo;s one that I so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>coined a number of weird terms, but that&rsquo;s not one of mine like that. That&rsquo;s an existing thing. So</p>
<p>so for example, somebody like Andy Adam Askey, who I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve if you&rsquo;ve had him on,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t, you should he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a, you know, very interesting guy. He&rsquo;s a computer</p>
<p>scientist, and he does unconventional cognition and slime molds, all kinds of weird. He&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>weird, weird cat, really interesting. Anyway, so so that&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a bunch of terms that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come up with. But that&rsquo;s not one of mine. So I think like many terms, that one is, is really</p>
<p>defined by the times, meaning that unconventional cognitive things that are unconventional cognition</p>
<p>today are not going to be considered unconventional cognition at some point. It&rsquo;s one of those,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of those things. And so it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s this, it&rsquo;s this really deep</p>
<p>question of how do you recognize, communicate with, classify cognition, when you cannot rely</p>
<p>on the typical milestones, right? So typical, you know, again, if you stick with the with the, the</p>
<p>history of life on Earth, like these, these exact model systems, you would say, Ah, here&rsquo;s a particular</p>
<p>structure of the brain. And this one has fewer of those. And this one has a bigger frontal cortex.</p>
<p>And this one, right, so these are these are landmarks that that we&rsquo;re that we&rsquo;re used to,</p>
<p>and and allows us to make very kind of rapid judgments about things. But if you can&rsquo;t rely on</p>
<p>that, either because you&rsquo;re looking at a synthetic thing, or an engineered thing, or an alien thing,</p>
<p>then what do you do? Right? How do you and so and so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really interested. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>interested in mind in all of its possible implementations, not just the obvious ones</p>
<p>that we know from from looking at brains here on Earth. Whenever I think about something like</p>
<p>unconventional cognition, I think about cellular automata, I&rsquo;m just captivated by the beauty of the</p>
<p>thing. The fact that from simple little objects, you can create some such beautiful complexity</p>
<p>that very quickly, you forget about the individual objects, and you see the things that it creates</p>
<p>as its own organisms. That blows my mind every time. Like, honestly, I could full time just</p>
<p>eat mushrooms and watch cellular automata. Don&rsquo;t even have to do mushrooms.</p>
<p>Just cellular automata. It feels like, I mean, from the engineering perspective, I love</p>
<p>when a very simple system captures something really powerful, because then you can study</p>
<p>that system to understand something fundamental about complexity about life on Earth.</p>
<p>Anyway, how do I communicate with a thing? If cellular automata can do cognition, if a plant</p>
<p>can do cognition, if a xenobot can do cognition, how do I like whisper in its ear and get an</p>
<p>answer back to how do I have a conversation? How do I have a xenobot on a podcast?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting line of investigation that opens up. I mean, we&rsquo;ve thought about this.</p>
<p>So you need a few things. You need to understand the space in which they live. So not just the</p>
<p>physical modality, like can they see light, can they feel vibration? I mean, that&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>of course, because that&rsquo;s how you deliver your message. But not just the ideas for a communication</p>
<p>medium, not just the physical medium, but saliency, right? So what&rsquo;s important to this</p>
<p>system? And systems have all kinds of different levels of sophistication of what you could expect</p>
<p>to get back. And I think what&rsquo;s really important, I call this the spectrum of persuadability,</p>
<p>which is this idea that when you&rsquo;re looking at a system, you can&rsquo;t assume where on the spectrum</p>
<p>it is. You have to do experiments. And so for example, if you look at a gene regulatory network,</p>
<p>which is just a bunch of nodes that turn each other on and off at various rates, you might</p>
<p>look at that and you say, well, there&rsquo;s no magic here. I mean, clearly this thing is as deterministic</p>
<p>as it gets. It&rsquo;s a piece of hardware. The only way we&rsquo;re going to be able to control it is by</p>
<p>rewiring it, which is the way molecular biology works, right? We can add nodes, remove nodes,</p>
<p>whatever. Well, so we&rsquo;ve done simulations and shown that biological, and now we&rsquo;re doing this in the</p>
<p>lab, the biological networks like that have associative memory. So they can actually learn,</p>
<p>they can learn from experience. They have habituation, they have sensitization, they</p>
<p>have associative memory, which you wouldn&rsquo;t have known if you assume that they have to be on the</p>
<p>left side of that spectrum. So when you&rsquo;re going to communicate with something, and we&rsquo;ve even,</p>
<p>Charles Abramson and I have written a paper on behaviorist approaches to synthetic organisms,</p>
<p>meaning that if you&rsquo;re given something, you have no idea what it is or what it can do,</p>
<p>how do you figure out what its psychology is, what its level is, what does it, and so we literally</p>
<p>lay out a set of protocols, starting with the simplest things and then moving up to more complex</p>
<p>things where you can make no assumptions about what this thing can do, right? You have to start</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll find out. So when you&rsquo;re going to, so here&rsquo;s a simple, I mean, here&rsquo;s one way to</p>
<p>communicate with something. If you can train it, that&rsquo;s a way of communicating. So if you can</p>
<p>provide, if you can figure out what the currency of reward of positive and negative reinforcement is,</p>
<p>right, and you can get it to do something it wasn&rsquo;t doing before based on experiences you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>given, you have taught it one thing. You have communicated one thing, that such and such an</p>
<p>action is good, some other action is not good. That&rsquo;s like a basic atom of a primitive atom</p>
<p>of communication. What about in some sense, if it gets you to do something you haven&rsquo;t done before,</p>
<p>is it answering back? Yeah, most certainly. And there&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve seen cartoons, I think maybe Gary</p>
<p>Larson or somebody had had a cartoon of these rats in the maze and the one rat, you know,</p>
<p>assist to the other. You look at this every time, every time I walk over here, he starts scribbling</p>
<p>in that on the, you know, on the clipboard that he has, it&rsquo;s awesome. If we step outside ourselves</p>
<p>and really measure how much, like if I actually measure how much I&rsquo;ve changed because of my</p>
<p>interaction with certain cellular automata. I mean, you really have to take that into</p>
<p>consideration about like, well, these things are changing you too. Yes. I know, you know how it</p>
<p>works and so on, but you&rsquo;re being changed by the thing. Yeah, absolutely. I think I read,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any details, but I think I read something about how wheat and other things</p>
<p>have domesticated humans in terms of, right, but by their properties change the way that</p>
<p>the human behavior and societal structures. In that sense, cats are running the world</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve took over the, so first off, so first they, while not giving a shit about humans,</p>
<p>clearly with every ounce of their being, they&rsquo;ve somehow got just millions and millions of humans</p>
<p>to take them home and feed them. And then not only the physical space did they take over,</p>
<p>they took over the digital space. They dominate the internet in terms of cuteness, in terms of</p>
<p>memeability. And so they&rsquo;re like, they got themselves literally inside the memes, they</p>
<p>become viral and spread on the internet. And they&rsquo;re the ones that are probably controlling</p>
<p>humans. That&rsquo;s my theory. Another, that&rsquo;s a follow up paper after the frog kissing. Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, you mentioned sentience and consciousness. You have a paper titled Generalizing Frameworks</p>
<p>for Sentience Beyond Natural Species. So beyond normal cognition, if we look at sentience and</p>
<p>consciousness, and I wonder if you draw an interesting distinction between those two</p>
<p>elsewhere, outside of humans, and maybe outside of Earth, you think aliens have sentience. And</p>
<p>if they do, how do we think about it? So when you have this framework, what is this paper? What is</p>
<p>the way you propose to think about sentience? Yeah, that particular paper was a very short</p>
<p>commentary on another paper that was written about crabs. It was a really good paper on them,</p>
<p>crabs and various, like a rubric of different types of behaviors that could be applied to</p>
<p>different creatures, and they&rsquo;re trying to apply it to crabs and so on. Consciousness,</p>
<p>we can talk about if you want, but it&rsquo;s a whole separate kettle of fish. I almost never talk about</p>
<p>crabs. In this case, yes. I almost never talk about consciousness, per se. I&rsquo;ve said very,</p>
<p>very little about it, but we can talk about it if you want. Mostly what I talk about is cognition,</p>
<p>because I think that that&rsquo;s much easier to deal with in a kind of rigorous experimental way.</p>
<p>I think that all of these terms have, you know, sentience and so on, have different definitions,</p>
<p>and I fundamentally, I think that people can, as long as they specify what they mean ahead of time,</p>
<p>I think people can define them in various ways. The only thing that I really think</p>
<p>that I really kind of insist on is that the right way to think about all this stuff is</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective. What does it help me to control, predict, and does it help</p>
<p>me do my next experiment? That&rsquo;s not a universal perspective. Some people have philosophical</p>
<p>kind of underpinnings, and those are primary, and if anything runs against that, then it must</p>
<p>automatically be wrong. Some people will say, I don&rsquo;t care what else. If your theory says to me</p>
<p>that thermostats have little tiny goals, I&rsquo;m not, so that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s my philosophical</p>
<p>preconception. Thermostats do not have goals, and that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s one way of doing it,</p>
<p>and some people do it that way. I do not do it that way, and I think that we can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can know much of anything from a philosophical armchair. I think that</p>
<p>all of these theories and ways of doing things stand or fall based on just basically one set</p>
<p>of criteria. Does it help you run a rich research program? That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I agree with you totally, but forget philosophy. What about the poetry of ambiguity? What about</p>
<p>at the limits of the things you can engineer using terms that can be defined in multiple ways</p>
<p>and living within that uncertainty in order to play with words until something lands that you</p>
<p>can engineer? I mean, that&rsquo;s to me where consciousness sits currently. Nobody really</p>
<p>understands the heart problem of consciousness, the subject, what it feels like, because it really</p>
<p>feels like, it feels like something to be this biological system. This conglomerate of a bunch</p>
<p>of cells in this hierarchy of competencies feels like something, and yeah, I feel like one thing,</p>
<p>and is that just a side effect of a complex system, or is there something more that humans have,</p>
<p>or is there something more that any biological system has? Some kind of magic, some kind of,</p>
<p>not just a sense of agency, but a real sense with a capital letter S of agency.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah, boy, yeah, that&rsquo;s a deep question.</p>
<p>Is there room for poetry in engineering or no?</p>
<p>No, there definitely is, and a lot of the poetry comes in when we realize that none of the</p>
<p>categories we deal with are sharp as we think they are, right? And so in the different areas of all</p>
<p>these spectra are where a lot of the poetry sits, I have many new theories about things,</p>
<p>but I, in fact, do not have a good theory about consciousness that I plan to trot out.</p>
<p>And you almost don&rsquo;t see it as useful for your current work to think about consciousness?</p>
<p>I think it will come. I have some thoughts about it, but I don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re going to move</p>
<p>the needle yet on that.</p>
<p>And you want to ground it in engineering always.</p>
<p>So, well, I mean, so if we really tackle consciousness per se, in the terms of the</p>
<p>hard problem, that isn&rsquo;t necessarily going to be groundable in engineering, right? That</p>
<p>aspect of cognition is, but actual consciousness per se, first person perspective, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s groundable in engineering. And I think specifically what&rsquo;s different about it is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple of things. So let&rsquo;s, you know, here we go. I&rsquo;ll say a couple of things about</p>
<p>consciousness. One thing is that what makes it different is that for every other thing,</p>
<p>other aspect of science, when we think about having a correct or a good theory of it,</p>
<p>we have some idea of what format that theory makes predictions in. So whether those be numbers</p>
<p>or whatever, we have some idea. We may not know the answer, we may not have the theory,</p>
<p>but we know that when we get the theory, here&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to output, and then we&rsquo;ll know</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s right or wrong. For actual consciousness, not behavior, not neural correlates, but actual</p>
<p>first person consciousness. If we had a correct theory of consciousness, or even a good one,</p>
<p>what the hell would, what format would it make predictions in, right? Because all the things</p>
<p>that we know about basically boil down to observable behaviors. So the only thing I can</p>
<p>think of when I think about that is, it&rsquo;ll be poetry, or it&rsquo;ll be something to, if I ask you,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;ve got a great theory of consciousness, and here&rsquo;s this creature, maybe it&rsquo;s a natural one,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s an engineered one, whatever. And I want you to tell me what your theory says about this</p>
<p>being, what it&rsquo;s like to be this being. The only thing I can imagine you giving me is some piece</p>
<p>of art, a poem or something, that once I&rsquo;ve taken it in, I share, I now have a similar state as</p>
<p>whatever. That&rsquo;s about as good as I can come up with. Well, it&rsquo;s possible that once you have a</p>
<p>good understanding of consciousness, it would be mapped to some things that are more measurable.</p>
<p>So for example, it&rsquo;s possible that a conscious being is one that&rsquo;s able to suffer. So you start</p>
<p>to look at pain and suffering. You can start to connect it closer to things that you can measure</p>
<p>that, in terms of how they reflect themselves in behavior and problem solving and creation and</p>
<p>attainment of goals, for example, which I think suffering is one of the, you know, life is suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the big aspects of the human condition. And so if consciousness is somehow a,</p>
<p>maybe at least a catalyst for suffering, you could start to get like echoes of it. You start to see</p>
<p>like the actual effects of consciousness and behavior. That it&rsquo;s not just about subjective</p>
<p>experience. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s really deeply integrated in the problem solving decision making of a</p>
<p>system, something like this. But also it&rsquo;s possible that we realize, this is not a philosophical</p>
<p>statement. Philosophers can write their books. I welcome it. You know, I take the Turing test</p>
<p>really seriously. I don&rsquo;t know why people really don&rsquo;t like it. When a robot convinces you that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s intelligent, I think that&rsquo;s a really incredible accomplishment. And there&rsquo;s some deep</p>
<p>sense in which that is intelligence. If it looks like it&rsquo;s intelligent, it is intelligent. And I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s some deep aspect of a system that appears to be conscious. In some deep sense,</p>
<p>it is conscious. At least for me, we have to consider that possibility. And a system that</p>
<p>appears to be conscious is an engineering challenge. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t disagree with any of</p>
<p>that. I mean, especially intelligence, I think, is a publicly observable thing. Science fiction</p>
<p>has dealt with this for a century or much more, maybe. This idea that when you are confronted with</p>
<p>something that just doesn&rsquo;t meet any of your typical assumptions, so you can&rsquo;t look in the</p>
<p>skull and say, oh, well, there&rsquo;s that frontal cortex, so then I guess we&rsquo;re good. So this thing</p>
<p>lands on your front lawn, and the little door opens, and something trundles out, and it&rsquo;s shiny</p>
<p>and aluminum looking, and it hands you this poem that it wrote while it was flying over,</p>
<p>and how happy it is to meet you. What&rsquo;s going to be your criteria for whether you get to take it</p>
<p>apart and see what makes it tick, or whether you have to be nice to it and whatever? All the</p>
<p>criteria that we have now and that people are using, and as you said, a lot of people are</p>
<p>down on the Turing test and things like this, but what else have we got? Because measuring</p>
<p>the cortex size isn&rsquo;t going to cut it in the broader scheme of things. So I think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wide open problem. Our solution to the problem of other minds, it&rsquo;s very simplistic. We give each</p>
<p>other credit for having minds just because we&rsquo;re sort of on an anatomical level, we&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>similar, and so it&rsquo;s good enough. But how far is that going to go? So I think that&rsquo;s really primitive.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a major unsolved problem. It&rsquo;s a really challenging direction of thought</p>
<p>to the human race that you talked about, like embodied minds. If you start to think that other</p>
<p>things other than humans have minds, that&rsquo;s really challenging. Because all men are created equal</p>
<p>starts being like, all right, well, we should probably treat not just cows with respect,</p>
<p>but like plants, and not just plants, but some kind of organized conglomerates of cells</p>
<p>in a petri dish. In fact, some of the work we&rsquo;re doing, like you&rsquo;re doing and the whole community</p>
<p>of science is doing with biology, people might be like, we were really mean to viruses.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, yeah, the thing is, you&rsquo;re right. And I certainly get phone calls about people</p>
<p>complaining about frog skin and so on. But I think we have to separate the sort of deep</p>
<p>philosophical aspects versus what actually happens. So what actually happens on Earth</p>
<p>is that people with exactly the same anatomical structure kill each other on a daily basis.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s clear that simply knowing that something else is equally or maybe more</p>
<p>cognitive or conscious than you are is not a guarantee of kind behavior, that much we know of.</p>
<p>And so then we look at a commercial farming of mammals and various other things. And so I think</p>
<p>on a practical basis, long before we get to worrying about things like frog skin,</p>
<p>we have to ask ourselves, why are we, what can we do about the way that we&rsquo;ve been behaving</p>
<p>towards creatures, which we know for a fact, because of our similarities are basically just</p>
<p>like us. That&rsquo;s kind of a whole other social thing. But fundamentally, of course, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely right in that we are also, think about this, we are on this planet in some way,</p>
<p>incredibly lucky. It&rsquo;s just dumb luck that we really only have one dumb animal.</p>
<p>We only have one dominant species. It didn&rsquo;t have to work out that way. So you could easily</p>
<p>imagine that there could be a planet somewhere with more than one equally or maybe near equally</p>
<p>intelligent species. But they may not look anything like each other. So there may be</p>
<p>multiple ecosystems where there are things of similar to human like intelligence. And then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have all kinds of issues about how do you relate to them when they&rsquo;re physically</p>
<p>like you at all. But yet in terms of behavior and culture and whatever, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve got as much on the ball as you have. Or maybe imagine that there was another</p>
<p>group of beings that was on average 40 IQ points lower. We&rsquo;re pretty lucky in many ways. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have, even though we still act badly in many ways. But the fact is, all humans are more</p>
<p>or less in that same range, but didn&rsquo;t have to work out that way. Well, but I think that&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of the way life works on Earth, maybe human civilization works, is it seems like we want</p>
<p>ourselves to be quite similar. And then within that, you know, where everybody&rsquo;s about the same</p>
<p>relatively IQ, intelligence, problem solving capabilities, even physical characteristics.</p>
<p>But then we&rsquo;ll find some aspect of that that&rsquo;s different. And that seems to be like,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really dark to say, but that seems to be the, not even a bug, but like a feature</p>
<p>of the early development of human civilization. You pick the other, your tribe versus the other</p>
<p>tribe and you war, it&rsquo;s a kind of evolution in the space of memes, a space of ideas, I think,</p>
<p>and you war with each other. So we&rsquo;re very good at finding the other, even when the characteristics</p>
<p>are really the same. And that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what that, I mean, I&rsquo;m sure so many of these things</p>
<p>echo in the biological world in some way. Yeah. There&rsquo;s a fun experiment that I did. My son</p>
<p>actually came up with this and we did a biology unit together. He&rsquo;s a homeschool. And so we did</p>
<p>this a couple of years ago. We did this thing where, imagine you get this slime mold, right?</p>
<p>Fisarum polycephalum, and it grows on a Petri dish of agar and it sort of spreads out and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>single cell protist, but it&rsquo;s like this giant thing. And so you put down a piece of oat and</p>
<p>it wants to go get the oat and it sort of grows towards the oat. So what you do is you take a</p>
<p>razor blade and you just separate the piece of the whole culture that&rsquo;s growing towards the</p>
<p>oat. You just kind of separate it. And so now think about the interesting decision making</p>
<p>calculus for that little piece. I can go get the oat and therefore I won&rsquo;t have to share those</p>
<p>nutrients with this giant mass over there. So the nutrients per unit volume is going to be amazing.</p>
<p>I should go eat the oat. But if I first rejoin, because Fisarum, once you cut it, has the ability</p>
<p>to join back up. If I first rejoin, then that whole calculus becomes impossible because there</p>
<p>is no more me anymore. There&rsquo;s just we and then we will go eat this thing, right? So this</p>
<p>interesting, you can imagine a kind of game theory where the number of agents isn&rsquo;t fixed</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s not just cooperate or defect, but it&rsquo;s actually merge and whatever, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. So that computation, how does it do that decision making?</p>
<p>Yeah. So it&rsquo;s really interesting. And so empirically, what we found is that it tends</p>
<p>to merge first. It tends to merge first and then the whole thing goes. But it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>that that calculus, I mean, I&rsquo;m not an expert in the economic game theory and all that,</p>
<p>but maybe there&rsquo;s some sort of hyperbolic discounting or something. But maybe this idea</p>
<p>that the actions you take not only change your payoff, but they change who or what you are,</p>
<p>and that you could take an action after which you don&rsquo;t exist anymore, or you are radically</p>
<p>changed, or you are merged with somebody else. As far as I know, that&rsquo;s a whole different</p>
<p>thing. As far as I know, we&rsquo;re still missing a formalism for even knowing how to model</p>
<p>any of that.</p>
<p>Do you see evolution, by the way, as a process that applies here on Earth? Where did evolution</p>
<p>come from?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this thing from the very origin of life that took us to today, what the heck is that?</p>
<p>I think evolution is inevitable in the sense that if you combine, and basically, I think</p>
<p>one of the most useful things that was done in early computing, I guess in the 60s, it</p>
<p>started with evolutionary computation and just showing how simple it is that if you have</p>
<p>imperfect heredity and competition together, those two things, or three things, so heredity,</p>
<p>imperfect heredity, and competition, or selection, those three things, and that&rsquo;s it. Now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>off to the races. And so that can be, it&rsquo;s not just on Earth because it can be done in</p>
<p>the computer, it can be done in chemical systems, it can be done in, you know, Lee Smolin says</p>
<p>it works on cosmic scales. So I think that that kind of thing is incredibly pervasive</p>
<p>and general. It&rsquo;s a general feature of life. It&rsquo;s interesting to think about, you know,</p>
<p>the standard thought about this is that it&rsquo;s blind, right? Meaning that the intelligence</p>
<p>of the process is zero, it&rsquo;s stumbling around. And I think that back in the day, when the</p>
<p>options were it&rsquo;s dumb like machines, or it&rsquo;s smart like humans, then of course, the scientists</p>
<p>went in this direction, because nobody wanted creationism. They said, okay, it&rsquo;s got to</p>
<p>be like completely blind. I&rsquo;m not actually sure, right? Because I think that everything</p>
<p>is a continuum. And I think that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be smart with foresight like us, but</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be completely blind either. I think there may be aspects of it. And in</p>
<p>particular, this kind of multi scale competency might give it a little bit of look ahead maybe</p>
<p>or a little bit of problem solving sort of baked in. But that&rsquo;s going to be completely</p>
<p>different in different systems. I do think it&rsquo;s general. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just on Earth.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very fundamental thing.</p>
<p>And it does seem to have a kind of direction that it&rsquo;s taking us that&rsquo;s somehow perhaps</p>
<p>is defined by the environment itself. It feels like we&rsquo;re headed towards something. Like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re playing out a script that was just like a single cell defines the entire organism.</p>
<p>It feels like from the origin of Earth itself, it&rsquo;s playing out a kind of script. You can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really go any other way.</p>
<p>I mean, so this is very controversial, and I don&rsquo;t know the answer. But people have argued</p>
<p>that this is called, you know, sort of rewinding the tape of life, right? And some people have</p>
<p>argued, I think, I think Conway Morris, maybe has argued that it is that there&rsquo;s a deep</p>
<p>attractor, for example, to human to the human kind of structure and that and that if you</p>
<p>were to rewind it again, you&rsquo;d basically get more or less the same thing. And then other</p>
<p>people have argued that, no, it&rsquo;s incredibly sensitive to frozen accidents. And then once</p>
<p>certain stochastic decisions are made downstream, everything is going to be different. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. I don&rsquo;t know. You know, we&rsquo;re very bad at predicting attractors in the space of complex</p>
<p>systems, generally speaking, right? We don&rsquo;t know. So maybe, so maybe evolution on Earth</p>
<p>has these deep attractors that no matter what has happened, it pretty much would likely</p>
<p>to end up there or maybe not. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a really difficult idea to imagine that if you ran Earth a million times, 500,000</p>
<p>times you would get Hitler? Like, yeah, we don&rsquo;t like to think like that. We think like,</p>
<p>because at least maybe in America, you&rsquo;d like to think that individual decisions can change</p>
<p>the world. And if individual decisions could change the world, then surely any perturbation</p>
<p>could result in a totally different trajectory. But maybe there&rsquo;s a, in this competency hierarchy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a self correcting system. There&rsquo;s just ultimately, there&rsquo;s a bunch of chaos that</p>
<p>ultimately is leading towards something like a super intelligent, artificial intelligence</p>
<p>system that answers 42. I mean, there might be a kind of imperative for life that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>headed to. And we&rsquo;re too focused on our day to day life of getting coffee and snacks and</p>
<p>having sex and getting a promotion at work, not to see the big imperative of life on Earth</p>
<p>that is headed towards something.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe, maybe. It&rsquo;s difficult. I think one of the things that&rsquo;s important about Chimerica</p>
<p>bioengineering technologies, all of those things are that we have to start developing</p>
<p>a better science of predicting the cognitive goals of composite systems. So we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>not very good at it, right? We don&rsquo;t know if I create a composite system, and this could</p>
<p>be Internet of Things or swarm robotics or a cellular swarm or whatever. What is the</p>
<p>emergent intelligence of this thing? First of all, what level is it going to be at? And</p>
<p>if it has goal directed capacity, what are the goals going to be? Like, we are just not</p>
<p>very good at predicting that yet. And I think that it&rsquo;s an existential level need for us</p>
<p>to be able to because we&rsquo;re building these things all the time, right? We&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>both physical structures like swarm robotics, and we&rsquo;re building social financial structures</p>
<p>and so on, with very little ability to predict what sort of autonomous goals that system</p>
<p>is going to have, of which we are now cogs. And so learning to predict and control those</p>
<p>things is going to be critical. So in fact, if you&rsquo;re right and there is some kind of</p>
<p>attractor to evolution, it would be nice to know what that is and then to make a rational</p>
<p>decision of whether we&rsquo;re going to go along or we&rsquo;re going to pop out of it or try to</p>
<p>pop out of it because there&rsquo;s no guarantee. I mean, that&rsquo;s the other kind of important</p>
<p>thing. A lot of people, I get a lot of complaints from people who email me and say, you know,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing, it isn&rsquo;t natural. And I&rsquo;ll say, look, natural, that&rsquo;d be nice if somebody</p>
<p>was making sure that natural was matched up to our values, but no one&rsquo;s doing that. Evolution</p>
<p>optimizes for biomass. That&rsquo;s it. Nobody&rsquo;s optimizing. It&rsquo;s not optimizing for your happiness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think necessarily it&rsquo;s optimizing for intelligence or fairness or any of that</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find that person that emailed you, beat them up, take their place, steal</p>
<p>everything they own and say, no, this is natural.</p>
<p>This is natural. Yeah, exactly. Because it comes from an old worldview where you could</p>
<p>assume that whatever is natural, that that&rsquo;s probably for the best. And I think we&rsquo;re long</p>
<p>out of that garden of Eden kind of view. So I think we can do better. I think we, and</p>
<p>we have to, right? Natural just isn&rsquo;t great for a lot of life forms.</p>
<p>What are some cool synthetic organisms that you think about, you dream about? When you</p>
<p>think about embodied mind, what do you imagine? What do you hope to build?</p>
<p>Yeah, on a practical level, what I really hope to do is to gain enough of an understanding</p>
<p>of the embodied intelligence of the organs and tissues such that we can achieve a radically</p>
<p>different regenerative medicine so that we can say, basically, and I think about it as,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of like, okay, can you, what&rsquo;s the goal kind of end game for this</p>
<p>whole thing? To me, the end game is something that you would call an anatomical compiler.</p>
<p>So the idea is you would sit down in front of the computer and you would draw the body</p>
<p>or the organ that you wanted. Not molecular details, but like, yeah, this is what I want.</p>
<p>I want a six legged, you know, frog with a propeller on top, or I want a heart that looks</p>
<p>like this, or I want a leg that looks like this. And what it would do if we knew what</p>
<p>we were doing is put out, convert that anatomical description into a set of stimuli that would</p>
<p>have to be given to cells to convince them to build exactly that thing, right? I probably</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t live to see it, but I think it&rsquo;s achievable. And I think with that, if we can have that,</p>
<p>then that is basically the solution to all of medicine except for infectious disease.</p>
<p>So birth defects, right? Traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease. If we</p>
<p>knew how to tell cells what to build, all of those things go away. So those things go</p>
<p>away. And the positive feedback spiral of economic costs, where all of the advances</p>
<p>are increasingly more heroic and expensive interventions of a sinking ship when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like 90 and so on, right? All of that goes away because basically, instead of trying</p>
<p>to fix you up as you degrade, you progressively regenerate, you apply the regenerative medicine</p>
<p>early before things degrade. So I think that that&rsquo;ll have massive economic impacts over</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to do now, which is not at all sustainable. And that&rsquo;s what I hope.</p>
<p>I hope that we get it. So to me, yes, the xenobots will be doing useful things, cleaning</p>
<p>up the environment, cleaning out your joints and all that kind of stuff. But more important</p>
<p>than that, I think we can use these synthetic systems to try to develop a science of detecting</p>
<p>and manipulating the goals of collective intelligences of cells specifically for regenerative medicine.</p>
<p>And then sort of beyond that, if we think further beyond that, what I hope is that kind</p>
<p>of like what you said, all of this drives a reconsideration of how we formulate ethical</p>
<p>norms because this old school, so in the olden days, what you could do is if you were confronted</p>
<p>with something, you could tap on it, right? And if you heard a metallic clanging sound,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, ah, fine, right? So you could conclude it was made in a factory. I can take it apart.</p>
<p>I can do whatever, right? If you did that and you got sort of a squishy kind of warm</p>
<p>sensation, you&rsquo;d say, ah, I need to be more or less nice to it and whatever. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be feasible. It was never really feasible, but it was good enough because we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have any, we didn&rsquo;t know any better. That needs to go. And I think that by breaking</p>
<p>down those artificial barriers, someday we can try to build a system of ethical norms</p>
<p>that does not rely on these completely contingent facts of our earthly history, but on something</p>
<p>much, much deeper that really takes agency and the capacity to suffer and all that takes</p>
<p>that seriously.</p>
<p>The capacity to suffer and the deep questions I would ask of a system is can I eat it and</p>
<p>can I have sex with it? Which is the two fundamental tests of, again, the human condition. So I</p>
<p>can basically do what Dali does that&rsquo;s in the physical space. So print out like a 3D</p>
<p>print Pepe the Frog with a propeller head, propeller hat is the dream.</p>
<p>Well yes and no. I mean, I want to get away from the 3D printing thing because that will</p>
<p>be available for some things much earlier. I mean, we can already do bladders and ears</p>
<p>and things like that because it&rsquo;s micro level control, right? When you 3D print, you are</p>
<p>in charge of where every cell goes. And for some things that, you know, for, for like</p>
<p>this thing, they had that I think 20 years ago or maybe earlier than that, you could</p>
<p>do that.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would like to emphasize the Dali part where you provide a few words and it</p>
<p>generates a painting. So here you say, I want a frog with these features and then it would</p>
<p>go direct a complex biological system to construct something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah. The main magic would be, I mean, I think from, from looking at Dali and so on, it looks</p>
<p>like the first part is kind of solved now where you go from, from the words to the image,</p>
<p>like that seems more or less solved. The next step is really hard. This is what keeps things</p>
<p>like CRISPR and genomic editing and so on. That&rsquo;s what limits all the impacts for regenerative</p>
<p>medicine because going back to, okay, this is the knee joint that I want, or this is</p>
<p>the eye that I want. Now, what genes do I edit to make that happen, right? Going back</p>
<p>in that direction is really hard. So instead of that, it&rsquo;s going to be, okay, I understand</p>
<p>how to motivate cells to build particular structures. Can I rewrite the memory of what</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re supposed to be building such that then I can, you know, take my hands</p>
<p>off the wheel and let them, let them do their thing.</p>
<p>So some of that is experiment, but some of that may be AI can help too. Just like with</p>
<p>protein folding, this is exactly the problem that protein folding in the most simple medium</p>
<p>tried and has solved with alpha fold, which is how does the sequence of letters result</p>
<p>in this three dimensional shape? And you have to, I guess it didn&rsquo;t solve it because you</p>
<p>have to, if you say, I want this shape, how do I then have a sequence of letters? Yeah.</p>
<p>The reverse engineering step is really tricky.</p>
<p>It is. I think, I think we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re, and we&rsquo;re doing some of this now is, is to use</p>
<p>AI to try and build actionable models of the intelligence of the cellular collectives.</p>
<p>So try to help us and help us gain models that, that, that, and, and we&rsquo;ve had some</p>
<p>success in this. So we, we did something like this for, for, you know, for repairing birth</p>
<p>defects of the brain in frog. We&rsquo;ve done some of this for normalizing melanoma where you</p>
<p>can really start to use AI to make models of how would I impact this thing if I wanted</p>
<p>to given all the complexities, right. And, and, and given all the, the, the, the controls</p>
<p>that it, that it knows how to do.</p>
<p>So when you say regenerative medicine, so we talked about creating biological organisms,</p>
<p>but if you regrow a hand, that information is already there, right? The biological system</p>
<p>has that information. So how does regenerative medicine work today? How do you hope it works?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hope there?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. How do you make it happen?</p>
<p>Well today there&rsquo;s a set of popular approaches. So, so one is 3d printing. So the idea is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make a scaffold of the thing that I want. I&rsquo;m going to seed it with cells</p>
<p>and then, and then there it is, right? So kind of direct, and then that works for certain</p>
<p>things. You can make a bladder that way or an ear, something like that. The other, the</p>
<p>other ideas is some sort of stem cell transplant. These are the ideas. If we, if we put in stem</p>
<p>cells with appropriate factors, we can get them to generate certain kinds of neurons</p>
<p>for certain diseases and so on. All of those things are good for relatively simple structures,</p>
<p>but when you want an eye or a hand or something else, I think in this maybe an unpopular opinion,</p>
<p>I think the only hope we have in any reasonable kind of timeframe is to understand how the</p>
<p>thing was motivated to get made in the first place. So what is it that, that made those</p>
<p>cells in the, in the beginning, create a particular arm with a particular set of sizes and shapes</p>
<p>and number of fingers and all that. And why is it that a salamander can keep losing theirs</p>
<p>and keep regrowing theirs and a planarian can do the same even more? So to me, uh, kind</p>
<p>of ultimate regenerate medicine was when you can tell the cells to build whatever it is</p>
<p>you need them to build. Right. And so the, so that we can all be like planaria basically,</p>
<p>do you have to start at the very beginning or can you, um, do a shortcut? Cause we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to hand, you already got the whole organism. Yeah. So here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve done, right? So,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ve more or less solved that in frogs. So frogs, unlike salamanders do not regenerate</p>
<p>their legs as adults. And so, so, uh, we&rsquo;ve shown that with a very, um, uh, kind of simple</p>
<p>intervention. So what we do is there&rsquo;s two things you need to, uh, you need to have a</p>
<p>signal that tells the cells what to do, and then you need some way of delivering it. And</p>
<p>so this is work together with, um, with David Kaplan and I should do a, um, a disclosure</p>
<p>here. We have a company called morphosuticals and spin off where we&rsquo;re trying to, uh, to</p>
<p>address, uh, uh, regenerate, you know, limb regeneration. So we&rsquo;ve solved it in the frog</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re now in trials and mice. So now we&rsquo;re going to, we&rsquo;re in mammals now. It&rsquo;s, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say anything about how it&rsquo;s going, but the frog thing is solved. So what you do is, um,</p>
<p>after you have a little frog, Lou Skywalker with every growing hand. Yeah, basically,</p>
<p>basically. Yeah. Yeah. So what you do is we did, we did with legs instead of forearms.</p>
<p>And what you do is, um, after amputation, normally they, they don&rsquo;t regenerate. You</p>
<p>put on a wearable bioreactor. So it&rsquo;s this thing that, um, that goes on and, uh, Dave</p>
<p>Kaplan does lab makes these things and inside it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a very controlled environment.</p>
<p>It is a silk gel that carries, uh, some drugs, for example, ion channel drugs. And what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is you&rsquo;re saying to the cells, you should regrow what normally goes here. So, uh, that</p>
<p>whole thing is on for 24 hours and you take it off and you don&rsquo;t touch the leg. Again,</p>
<p>this is really important because what we&rsquo;re not looking for is a set of micromanagement,</p>
<p>uh, you know, printing or controlling the cells we want to trigger. We want to, we want</p>
<p>to interact with it early on and then not touch it again because, because we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to make a frog leg, but the frog knows how to make a frog leg. So 24 hours, 18 months</p>
<p>of leg growth after that, without us touching it again. And after 18 months, you get a pretty</p>
<p>good leg that kind of shows this proof of concept that early on when the cells right</p>
<p>after injury, when they&rsquo;re first making a decision about what they&rsquo;re going to do, you</p>
<p>can, you can impact them. And once they&rsquo;ve decided to make a leg, they don&rsquo;t need you</p>
<p>after that. They can do their own thing. So that&rsquo;s an approach that we&rsquo;re now taking.</p>
<p>What about cancer suppression? That&rsquo;s something you mentioned earlier. How can all of these</p>
<p>ideas help with cancer suppression?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s go back to the beginning and ask what, what, what, what cancer is. So I</p>
<p>think, um, you know, asking why there&rsquo;s cancer is the wrong question. I think the right question</p>
<p>is why is there ever anything but cancer? So, so in the normal state, you have a bunch</p>
<p>of cells that are all cooperating towards a large scale goal. If that process of cooperation</p>
<p>breaks down and you&rsquo;ve got a cell that is isolated from that electrical network that</p>
<p>lets you remember what the big goal is, you revert back to your unicellular lifestyle</p>
<p>as far as, now think about that border between self and world, right? Normally when all these</p>
<p>cells are connected by gap junctions into an electrical network, they are all one self,</p>
<p>right? That meaning that, um, their goals, they have these large tissue level goals and</p>
<p>so on. As soon as a cell is disconnected from that, the self is tiny, right? And so at that</p>
<p>point, and so, so people, a lot of people model cancer cell cells as being more selfish</p>
<p>and all that. They&rsquo;re not more selfish. They&rsquo;re equally selfish. It&rsquo;s just that their self</p>
<p>is smaller. Normally the self is huge. Now they got tiny little selves. Now what are</p>
<p>the goals of tiny little selves? Well, proliferate, right? And migrate to wherever life is good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s metastasis. That&rsquo;s proliferation and metastasis. So, so one thing we found</p>
<p>and people have noticed years ago that when cells convert to cancer, the first thing they</p>
<p>see is they close the gap junctions. And it&rsquo;s a lot like, I think it&rsquo;s a lot like that experiment</p>
<p>with the slime mold where until you close that gap junction, you can&rsquo;t even entertain</p>
<p>the idea of leaving the collective because there is no you at that point, right? Your</p>
<p>mind melded with this, with this whole other network. But as soon as the gap junction is</p>
<p>closed, now the boundary between you and now, now the rest of the body is just outside environment</p>
<p>to you. You&rsquo;re just a, you&rsquo;re just a unicellular organism and the rest of the body&rsquo;s environment.</p>
<p>So, so we, so we studied this process and we worked out a way to artificially control</p>
<p>the bioelectric state of these cells to physically force them to remain in that network. And</p>
<p>so then, then what that, what that means is that nasty mutations like KRAS and things</p>
<p>like that, these really tough oncogenic mutations that cause tumors. If you, if you do them</p>
<p>and then, but then within artificially control of the bioelectrics, you greatly reduce tumor</p>
<p>genesis or, or normalize cells that had already begun to convert. You basically, they go back</p>
<p>to being normal cells. And so this is another, much like with the planaria, this is another</p>
<p>way in which the bioelectric state kind of dominates what the, what the genetic state</p>
<p>is. So if you sequence the, you know, if you sequence the nucleic acid, you&rsquo;ll see the</p>
<p>KRAS mutation, you&rsquo;ll say, ah, well that&rsquo;s going to be a tumor, but there isn&rsquo;t a tumor</p>
<p>because, because bioelectrically you&rsquo;ve kept the cells connected and they&rsquo;re just working</p>
<p>on making nice skin and kidneys and whatever else. So, so we&rsquo;ve started moving that to,</p>
<p>to, to human glioblastoma cells and we&rsquo;re hoping for, you know, a patient in the future</p>
<p>interaction with patients.</p>
<p>So is this one of the possible ways in which we may quote cure cancer?</p>
<p>I think so. Yeah, I think so. I think, I think the actual cure, I mean, there are other technology,</p>
<p>you know, immune therapy, I think is a great technology. Chemotherapy, I don&rsquo;t think is</p>
<p>a good, is a good technology. I think we&rsquo;ve got to get, get off of that.</p>
<p>So chemotherapy just kills cells.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, chemotherapy hopes to kill more of the tumor cells than of your cells. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s a fine balance. The problem is the cells are very similar because they are your</p>
<p>cells. And so if you don&rsquo;t have a very tight way of distinguishing between them, then the</p>
<p>toll that chemo takes on the rest of the body is just unbelievable.</p>
<p>And immunotherapy tries to get the immune system to do some of the work.</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah. I think that&rsquo;s potentially a very good, a very good approach. If, if</p>
<p>the immune system can be taught to recognize enough of, of the cancer cells, that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a pretty good approach. But I, but I think, but I think our approach is in a way more</p>
<p>fundamental because if you can, if you can keep the cells harnessed towards organ level</p>
<p>goals as opposed to individual cell goals, then nobody will be making a tumor or metastasizing</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been living through a pandemic. What do you think about viruses in this full beautiful</p>
<p>biological context we&rsquo;ve been talking about? Are they beautiful to you? Are they terrifying?</p>
<p>Also maybe let&rsquo;s say, are they, since we&rsquo;ve been discriminating this whole conversation,</p>
<p>are they living? Are they embodied minds? Embodied minds that are assholes?</p>
<p>As far as I know, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to find this paper again, but, but somewhere</p>
<p>I saw in the last couple of months, there was some, there was some papers showing an</p>
<p>example of a virus that actually had physiology. So there was some, something was going on,</p>
<p>I think proton flux or something on the virus itself. But, but barring that, generally speaking,</p>
<p>viruses are very passive. They don&rsquo;t do anything by themselves. And so I don&rsquo;t see any particular</p>
<p>reason to attribute much of a mind to them. I think, you know, they represent a way to</p>
<p>hijack other minds for sure, like, like cells and other things.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an interesting interplay though. If they&rsquo;re hijacking other minds, you know,</p>
<p>the way we&rsquo;re, we were talking about living organisms that they can interact with each</p>
<p>other and have it alter each other&rsquo;s trajectory by having interacted. I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a deep, meaningful connection between a virus and a cell. And I think both are transformed</p>
<p>by the experience. And so in that sense, both are living.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. You know, the whole category, I, this question of what&rsquo;s living and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not living, I really, I&rsquo;m not sure. And I know there&rsquo;s people that work on this and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to piss anybody off, but, but I have not found that particularly useful</p>
<p>as, as to try and make that a binary kind of a distinction. I think level of cognition</p>
<p>is very interesting of, but as a, as a continuum, but, but living and nonliving, I, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I really know what to do with that. I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know what you do next after,</p>
<p>after making that distinction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I make the very binary distinction. Can I have sex with it or not? Can I eat it</p>
<p>or not? Those, cause there&rsquo;s, those are actionable, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I think that&rsquo;s a critical point that you brought up because how you relate</p>
<p>to something is really what this is all about, right? As an engineer, how do I control it?</p>
<p>But maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t be controlling it. Maybe I should be, you know, can I have a relationship</p>
<p>with it? Should I be listening to its advice? Like, like all the way from, you know, I need</p>
<p>to take it apart all the way to, I better do what it says cause it seems to be pretty</p>
<p>smart and everything in between, right? That&rsquo;s really what we&rsquo;re asking about.</p>
<p>Yeah. We need to understand our relationship to it. We&rsquo;re searching for that relationship,</p>
<p>even in the most trivial senses. You came up with a lot of interesting terms. We&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>some of them. Agential material. That&rsquo;s a really interesting one. That&rsquo;s a really interesting</p>
<p>one for the future of computation and artificial intelligence and computer science and all</p>
<p>of that. There&rsquo;s also, let me go through some of them. If they spark some interesting thought</p>
<p>for you, there&rsquo;s teleophobia, the unwarranted fear of erring on the side of too much agency</p>
<p>when considering a new system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opposite. I mean, being afraid of maybe anthropomorphizing the thing.</p>
<p>This&rsquo;ll get some people ticked off, I think. But I don&rsquo;t think, I think the whole notion</p>
<p>of anthropomorphizing is a holdover from a pre scientific age where humans were magic</p>
<p>and everything else wasn&rsquo;t magic and you were anthropomorphizing when you dared suggest</p>
<p>that something else has some features of humans. And I think we need to be way beyond that.</p>
<p>And this issue of anthropomorphizing, I think it&rsquo;s a cheap charge. I don&rsquo;t think it holds</p>
<p>any water at all other than when somebody makes a cognitive claim. I think all cognitive</p>
<p>claims are engineering claims, really. So when somebody says this thing knows or this</p>
<p>thing hopes or this thing wants or this thing predicts, all you can say is fabulous. Give</p>
<p>me the engineering protocol that you&rsquo;ve derived using that hypothesis and we will see if this</p>
<p>thing helps us or not. And then, and then we can, you know, then we can make a rational</p>
<p>decision.</p>
<p>I also like anatomical compiler, a future system representing the longterm end game</p>
<p>of the science of morphogenesis that reminds us how far away from true understanding we</p>
<p>are. Someday you will be able to sit in front of an anatomical computer, specify the shape</p>
<p>of the animal or a plant that you want, and it will convert that shape specification to</p>
<p>a set of stimuli that will have to be given to cells to build exactly that shape. No matter</p>
<p>how weird it ends up being, you have total control. Just imagine the possibility for</p>
<p>memes in the physical space. One of the glorious accomplishments of human civilizations is</p>
<p>memes in digital space. Now this could create memes in physical space. I am both excited</p>
<p>and terrified by that possibility. Cognitive light cone, I think we also talked about the</p>
<p>outer boundary in space and time of the largest goal a given system can work towards. Is this</p>
<p>kind of like shaping the set of options?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little different than options. It&rsquo;s really focused on&hellip; I first came up with</p>
<p>this back in 2018, I want to say. There was a conference, a Templeton conference where</p>
<p>they challenged us to come up with frameworks. I think actually it&rsquo;s the diverse intelligence</p>
<p>community.</p>
<p>Summer Institute.</p>
<p>Yeah, they had a Summer Institute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the logos, the bee with some circuits.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s got different life forms. The whole program is called diverse intelligence. They</p>
<p>challenged us to come up with a framework that was suitable for analyzing different</p>
<p>kinds of intelligence together. Because the kinds of things you do to a human are not</p>
<p>good with an octopus, not good with a plant and so on. I started thinking about this.</p>
<p>I asked myself what do all cognitive agents, no matter what their provenance, no matter</p>
<p>what their architecture is, what do cognitive agents have in common? It seems to me that</p>
<p>what they have in common is some degree of competency to pursue a goal. What you can</p>
<p>do then is you can draw. What I ended up drawing was this thing that it&rsquo;s kind of like a backwards</p>
<p>Minkowski cone diagram where all of space is collapsed into one axis and then here and</p>
<p>then time is this axis. Then what you can do is you can draw for any creature, you can</p>
<p>semi quantitatively estimate what are the spatial and temporal goals that it&rsquo;s capable</p>
<p>of pursuing.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a tick and all you really are able to pursue is maximum or a</p>
<p>bacterium and maximizing the level of some chemical in your vicinity, that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got, it&rsquo;s a tiny little icon, then you&rsquo;re a simple system like a tick or a bacterium.</p>
<p>If you are something like a dog, well, you&rsquo;ve got some ability to care about some spatial</p>
<p>region, some temporal. You can remember a little bit backwards, you can predict a little</p>
<p>bit forwards, but you&rsquo;re never ever going to care about what happens in the next town</p>
<p>over four weeks from now. As far as we know, it&rsquo;s just impossible for that kind of architecture.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a human, you might be working towards world peace long after you&rsquo;re dead. You might</p>
<p>have a planetary scale goal that&rsquo;s enormous. Then there may be other greater intelligences</p>
<p>somewhere that can care in the linear range about numbers of creatures, some sort of Buddha</p>
<p>like character that can care about everybody&rsquo;s welfare, really care the way that we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a mapping of what you can sense, how far you can sense. It&rsquo;s not a mapping</p>
<p>of how far you can act. It&rsquo;s a mapping of how big are the goals you are capable of envisioning</p>
<p>and working towards. I think that enables you to put synthetic kinds of constructs,</p>
<p>AIs, aliens, swarms, whatever on the same diagram because we&rsquo;re not talking about what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re made of or how you got here. We&rsquo;re talking about what are the size and complexity</p>
<p>of the goals towards which you can work.</p>
<p>Is there any other terms that pop into mind that are interesting?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember. I have a list of them somewhere on my website.</p>
<p>Human morphology, yeah, definitely check it out. Morphosutical, I like that one. Ionisutical.</p>
<p>Yeah. Those refer to different types of interventions in the regenerative medicine space. Amorphosutical</p>
<p>is something that it&rsquo;s a kind of intervention that really targets the cells decision making</p>
<p>process about what they&rsquo;re going to build. Ionisuticals are like that, but more focused</p>
<p>specifically on the bioelectrics. There&rsquo;s also, of course, biochemical, biomechanical,</p>
<p>who knows what else, maybe optical kinds of signaling systems there as well.</p>
<p>Target morphology is interesting. It&rsquo;s designed to capture this idea that it&rsquo;s not just feedforward</p>
<p>emergence and oftentimes in biology, I mean, of course that happens too, but in many cases</p>
<p>in biology, the system is specifically working towards a target in anatomical morphospace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a navigation task really. These kinds of problem solving can be formalized as navigation</p>
<p>tasks and that they&rsquo;re really going towards a particular region. How do you know? Because</p>
<p>you deviate them and then they go back.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, because you&rsquo;ve really challenged a lot of ideas in biology in the work you</p>
<p>do, probably because some of your rebelliousness comes from the fact that you came from a different</p>
<p>field of computer engineering, but could you give advice to young people today in high</p>
<p>school or college that are trying to pave their life story, whether it&rsquo;s in science</p>
<p>or elsewhere, how they can have a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud</p>
<p>of advice?</p>
<p>Boy, it&rsquo;s dangerous to give advice because things change so fast, but one central thing</p>
<p>I can say, moving up and through academia and whatnot, you will be surrounded by really</p>
<p>smart people. What you need to do is be very careful at distinguishing specific critique</p>
<p>versus kind of meta advice. What I mean by that is if somebody really smart and successful</p>
<p>and obviously competent is giving you specific critiques on what you&rsquo;ve done, that&rsquo;s gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity to hone your craft, to get better at what you&rsquo;re doing, to learn,</p>
<p>to find your mistakes. That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If they are telling you what you ought to be studying, how you ought to approach things,</p>
<p>what is the right way to think about things, you should probably ignore most of that. The</p>
<p>reason I make that distinction is that a lot of really successful people are very well</p>
<p>calibrated on their own ideas and their own field and their own area. They know exactly</p>
<p>what works and what doesn&rsquo;t and what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s bad, but they&rsquo;re not calibrated</p>
<p>on your ideas. The things they will say, oh, this is a dumb idea, don&rsquo;t do this and you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t do that, that stuff is generally worse than useless. It can be very demoralizing</p>
<p>and really limiting. What I say to people is read very broadly, work really hard, know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re talking about, take all specific criticism as an opportunity to improve what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing and then completely ignore everything else. I just tell you from my own experience,</p>
<p>most of what I consider to be interesting and useful things that we&rsquo;ve done, very smart</p>
<p>people have said, this is a terrible idea, don&rsquo;t do that. I think we just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We have no idea beyond our own. At best, we know what we ought to be doing. We very rarely</p>
<p>know what anybody else should be doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and their ideas, their perspective has been also calibrated, not just on their field</p>
<p>and specific situation, but also on a state of that field at a particular time in the</p>
<p>past. There&rsquo;s not many people in this world that are able to achieve revolutionary success</p>
<p>multiple times in their life. Whenever you say somebody very smart, usually what that</p>
<p>means is somebody who&rsquo;s smart, who achieved a success at a certain point in their life</p>
<p>and people often get stuck in that place where they found success. To be constantly challenging</p>
<p>your worldview is a very difficult thing. Also at the same time, probably if a lot of</p>
<p>people tell, that&rsquo;s the weird thing about life, if a lot of people tell you that something</p>
<p>is stupid or is not going to work, that either means it&rsquo;s stupid, it&rsquo;s not going to work,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s actually a great opportunity to do something new and you don&rsquo;t know which one</p>
<p>it is and it&rsquo;s probably equally likely to be either. Well, I don&rsquo;t know, the probabilities.</p>
<p>Depends how lucky you are, depends how brilliant you are, but you don&rsquo;t know and so you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take that advice as actual data.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to and this is kind of hard to describe and fuzzy, but I&rsquo;m a firm believer</p>
<p>that you have to build up your own intuition. So over time, you have to take your own risks</p>
<p>that seem like they make sense to you and then learn from that and build up so that</p>
<p>you can trust your own gut about what&rsquo;s a good idea even when, and then sometimes you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make mistakes and they&rsquo;ll turn out to be a dead end and that&rsquo;s fine, that&rsquo;s science,</p>
<p>but what I tell my students is life is hard and science is hard and you&rsquo;re going to sweat</p>
<p>and bleed and everything and you should be doing that for ideas that really fire you</p>
<p>up inside and really don&rsquo;t let kind of the common denominator of standardized approaches</p>
<p>to things slow you down.</p>
<p>So you mentioned planaria being in some sense immortal. What&rsquo;s the role of death in life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of death in this whole process we have? Is it, when you look at biological</p>
<p>systems, is death an important feature, especially as you climb up the hierarchy of competency?</p>
<p>Boy, that&rsquo;s an interesting question. I think that it&rsquo;s certainly a factor that promotes</p>
<p>change and turnover and an opportunity to do something different the next time for a</p>
<p>larger scale system. So apoptosis, it&rsquo;s really interesting. I mean, death is really interesting</p>
<p>in a number of ways. One is like you could think about like what was the first thing</p>
<p>to die? That&rsquo;s an interesting question. What was the first creature that you could say</p>
<p>actually died? It&rsquo;s a tough thing because we don&rsquo;t have a great definition for it. So</p>
<p>if you bring a cabbage home and you put it in your fridge, at what point are you going</p>
<p>to say it&rsquo;s died, right? So it&rsquo;s kind of hard to know. There&rsquo;s one paper in which I talk</p>
<p>about this idea that, I mean, think about this and imagine that you have a creature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s aquatic, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a frog or something or a tadpole, and the animal dies,</p>
<p>in the pond it dies for whatever reason. Most of the cells are still alive. So you could</p>
<p>imagine that if when it died, there was some sort of breakdown of the connectivity between</p>
<p>the cells, a bunch of cells crawled off, they could have a life as amoebas. Some of them</p>
<p>could join together and become a xenobot and twiddle around, right? So we know from planaria</p>
<p>that there are cells that don&rsquo;t obey the Hayflick limit and just sort of live forever. So you</p>
<p>could imagine an organism that when the organism dies, it doesn&rsquo;t disappear, rather the individual</p>
<p>cells that are still alive, crawl off and have a completely different kind of lifestyle</p>
<p>and maybe come back together as something else, or maybe they don&rsquo;t. So all of this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, is happening somewhere on some planet. So death in any case, I mean, we already kind</p>
<p>of knew this because the molecules, we know that when something dies, the molecules go</p>
<p>through the ecosystem, but even the cells don&rsquo;t necessarily die at that point, they</p>
<p>might have another life in a different way. You can think about something like HeLa, right?</p>
<p>The HeLa cell line, you know, that has this, that&rsquo;s had this incredible life. There are</p>
<p>way more HeLa cells now than there ever been, than there, than there were when, when she</p>
<p>was alive.</p>
<p>It seems like as the organisms become more and more complex, like if you look at the</p>
<p>mammals, their relationship with death becomes more and more complex. So the survival imperative</p>
<p>starts becoming interesting and humans are arguably the first species that have invented</p>
<p>the fear of death. The understanding that you&rsquo;re going to die, let&rsquo;s put it this way,</p>
<p>like long, so not like instinctual, like, I need to run away from the thing that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to eat me, but starting to contemplate the finiteness of life.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, one thing, so, so one thing about the human light, cognitive light cone</p>
<p>is that for the first, as far as we know, for the first time, you might have goals that</p>
<p>are longer than your lifespan, that are not achievable, right? So if you&rsquo;re, if you are,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, and I don&rsquo;t know if this is true, but if you&rsquo;re a goldfish and you have a 10</p>
<p>minute attention span, I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s true, but let&rsquo;s say, let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>organism with a, with a short kind of cognitive light cone that way, all of your goals are</p>
<p>potentially achievable because you&rsquo;re probably going to live the next 10 minutes. So whatever</p>
<p>goals you have, they are totally achievable. If you&rsquo;re a human, you could have all kinds</p>
<p>of goals that are guaranteed not achievable because they just take too long, like guaranteed</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to achieve them. So I wonder if, you know, is that, is that a, you know,</p>
<p>like a perennial, you know, sort of thorn in our, in our psychology that drives some,</p>
<p>some psychosis or whatever? I have, I have no idea. Another interesting thing about that,</p>
<p>actually, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot in the last couple of weeks, this notion</p>
<p>of giving up. So you would think that evolutionarily, the most adaptive way of being is that you</p>
<p>go, you, you, you, you fight as long as you physically can. And then when you can&rsquo;t, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t, and there&rsquo;s in, there&rsquo;s this photograph, there&rsquo;s videos you can find of insects are</p>
<p>crawling around where like, you know, like, like most of it is already gone, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still sort of crawling, you know, like, Terminator style, right? Like, as far as as long as you</p>
<p>physically can, you keep going. Mammals don&rsquo;t do that. So a lot of mammals, including rats,</p>
<p>have this thing where when, when they think it&rsquo;s a hopeless situation, they literally</p>
<p>give up and die when physically, they could have kept going. I mean, humans certainly</p>
<p>do this. And there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s some like, really unpleasant experiments that the this guy forget</p>
<p>his name did with drowning rats, where if he where where rats normally drown after a</p>
<p>couple of minutes, but if you teach them that if you just tread water for a couple of minutes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get rescued, they can tread water for like an hour. And so right, and so they literally</p>
<p>just give up and die. And so evolutionarily, that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good strategy at</p>
<p>all evolutionarily, since why would you like, what&rsquo;s the benefit ever of giving up, you</p>
<p>just do what you can, and you know, one time out of 1000, you&rsquo;ll actually get rescued, right?</p>
<p>But this issue of actually giving up suggests some very interesting metacognitive controls</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve now gotten to the point where survival actually isn&rsquo;t the top drive. And</p>
<p>that for whatever, you know, there are other considerations that have like taken over.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s uniquely a mammalian thing. But then I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Camus, the existentialist question of why live, just the fact that humans commit</p>
<p>suicide is a really fascinating question from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>And what was the first and that&rsquo;s the other thing, like, what is the simplest system,</p>
<p>whether whether evolved or natural or whatever, that is able to do that? Right? Like, you</p>
<p>can think, you know, what other animals are actually able to do that? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Maybe you could see animals over time, for some reason, lowering the value of survive</p>
<p>at all costs, gradually, until other objectives might become more important.</p>
<p>Maybe. I don&rsquo;t know how evolutionarily how that how that gets off the ground. That just</p>
<p>seems like that would have such a strong pressure against it, you know. Just imagine, you know,</p>
<p>a population with a lower, you know, if you were a mutant in a population that had less</p>
<p>of a less of a survival imperative, would you put your genes outperform the others?</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as population selection? Because maybe suicide is a way for organisms</p>
<p>to decide themselves that they&rsquo;re not fit for the environment? Somehow?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a really contrary, you know, population level selection is a kind</p>
<p>of a deep controversial area. But it&rsquo;s tough because on the face of it, if that was your</p>
<p>genome, it wouldn&rsquo;t get propagated because you would die and then your neighbor who didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that would would have all the kids.</p>
<p>It feels like there could be some deep truth there that we&rsquo;re not understanding. What about</p>
<p>you yourself as one biological system? Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m more concerned with especially now getting older and having helped a couple</p>
<p>of people pass. I think about what&rsquo;s a what&rsquo;s a good way to go? Basically, like nowadays,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is, I, you know, sitting in a, you know, a facility that sort of tries</p>
<p>to stretch you out as long as you can, that doesn&rsquo;t seem that doesn&rsquo;t seem good. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a lot of opportunities to sort of, I don&rsquo;t know, sacrifice yourself for something useful,</p>
<p>right? There&rsquo;s not terribly many opportunities for that in modern society. So I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s more of I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not particularly worried about death itself.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen it happen. And and it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not pretty. And I don&rsquo;t know what what</p>
<p>a better what a better alternative is.</p>
<p>So the existential aspect of it does not worry you deeply? The fact that this ride ends?</p>
<p>No, it began. I mean, the ride began, right? So there was I don&rsquo;t know how many billions</p>
<p>of years before that I wasn&rsquo;t around. So that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t the experience of life? It&rsquo;s almost like feels like you&rsquo;re immortal. Because the</p>
<p>way you make plans, the way you think about the future. I mean, if you if you look at</p>
<p>your own personal rich experience, yes, you can understand, okay, eventually, I died as</p>
<p>people I love that have died. So surely, I will die and it hurts and so on. But like,</p>
<p>he sure doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s so easy to get lost in feeling like this is going to go on forever.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a little bit like the people who say they don&rsquo;t believe in free will, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you can say that but but when you go to a restaurant, you still have to pick</p>
<p>a soup and stuff. So right, so so I don&rsquo;t know if I know I&rsquo;ve actually seen that that</p>
<p>happened at lunch with a with a well known philosopher and he didn&rsquo;t believe in free</p>
<p>will and the other waitress came around and he was like, Well, let me see. I was like,</p>
<p>What are you doing here? You&rsquo;re gonna choose a sandwich, right? So it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of those things. I think you can know that, you know, you&rsquo;re not going to live forever.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not practical to live that way unless you know, so you buy</p>
<p>insurance and then you do some stuff like that. But but but mostly, you know, I think</p>
<p>you just you just live as if as if as if you can make plans.</p>
<p>We talked about all kinds of life. We talked about all kinds of embodied minds. What do</p>
<p>you think is the meaning of it all? What&rsquo;s the meaning of all the biological lives we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been talking about here on Earth? Why are we here?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s a that that&rsquo;s a well posed question other than the existential</p>
<p>question you post before.</p>
<p>Is that question hanging out with the question of what is consciousness and there at retreat</p>
<p>somewhere? Not sure because sipping pina coladas and because they&rsquo;re ambiguously defined.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m not sure that any of these things really ride on the correctness of our scientific</p>
<p>understanding. But I mean, just just for an example, right? I&rsquo;ve always found I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>found it weird that people get really worked up to find out realities about their their</p>
<p>bodies, for example. Right. You&rsquo;ve seen them. Ex Machina. Right. And so there&rsquo;s this great</p>
<p>scene where he&rsquo;s cutting his hand to find out, you know, a piece full of cock. Now,</p>
<p>to me, right? If if I open up and I find out and I find a bunch of cogs, my conclusion</p>
<p>is not, oh, crap, I must not have true cognition. That sucks. My conclusion is, wow, cogs can</p>
<p>have true cognition. Great. So right. So. So it seems to me, I guess I guess I&rsquo;m with</p>
<p>Descartes on this one, that whatever whatever the truth ends up being of of of how is what</p>
<p>is consciousness, how it can be conscious? None of that is going to alter my primary</p>
<p>experience, which is this is what it is. And if and if a bunch of molecular networks can</p>
<p>do it, fantastic. If it turns out that there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a non corporeal, you know, so great.</p>
<p>We can we&rsquo;ll study that, whatever. But but the fundamental existential aspect of it is,</p>
<p>you know, if somebody if somebody told me today that, yeah, yeah, you were created yesterday</p>
<p>and all your memories are, you know, sort of fake, you know, kind of like like like Boltzmann</p>
<p>brains, right. And the human, you know, human skepticism, all that. Yeah. OK. Well, so so</p>
<p>but but here I am now. So so it&rsquo;s the experience. It&rsquo;s primal, so like that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that matters. So the the backstory doesn&rsquo;t matter. I think so. I think so. From a first</p>
<p>person perspective, now from a third person, like scientifically, it&rsquo;s all very interesting.</p>
<p>From a third person perspective, I could say, wow, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s amazing that that this</p>
<p>happens and how does it happen and whatever. But from a first person perspective, I could</p>
<p>care less. Like I just it&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve what I learned from any of these scientific</p>
<p>facts is, OK, well, I guess then that&rsquo;s that that then I guess that&rsquo;s what is sufficient</p>
<p>to to give me my, you know, amazing first person perspective. I think if you dig deeper</p>
<p>and deeper and get a get surprising answers to why the hell we&rsquo;re here, it might give</p>
<p>you some guidance on how to live. Maybe, maybe. I don&rsquo;t know. That would be nice. On the one</p>
<p>hand, you might be right, because on the one hand, if I don&rsquo;t know what else could possibly</p>
<p>give you that guidance. Right. So so you would think that it would have to be that or you</p>
<p>would do it would have to be science because there isn&rsquo;t anything else. So so that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>maybe on the other hand, I am really not sure how you go from any, you know, what they call</p>
<p>from an is to an odd right from any factual description of what&rsquo;s going on. This goes</p>
<p>back to the natural. Right. Just because somebody says, oh, man, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s completely not</p>
<p>natural. It&rsquo;s never happened on Earth before. I&rsquo;m not impressed by that whatsoever. I think</p>
<p>I think whatever hazard hasn&rsquo;t happened, we are now in a position to do better if we can.</p>
<p>Right. Well, this also because you said there&rsquo;s science and there&rsquo;s nothing else. There it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really tricky to know how to intellectually deal with a thing that science doesn&rsquo;t currently</p>
<p>understand. Right. So like, the thing is, if you believe that science solves everything,</p>
<p>you can too easily in your mind think our current understanding, like, we&rsquo;ve solved</p>
<p>everything. Right. Right. Right. Like, it jumps really quickly to not science as a mechanism</p>
<p>as a as a process, but more like science of today. Like, you could just look at human</p>
<p>history and throughout human history, just physicists and everybody would claim we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>solved everything. Sure. Sure. Like, like, there&rsquo;s a few small things to figure out.</p>
<p>And we basically solved everything. Were in reality, I think asking, like, what is the</p>
<p>meaning of life is resetting the palette of like, we might be tiny and confused and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have anything figured out. It&rsquo;s almost going to be hilarious a few centuries from now when</p>
<p>they look back how dumb we were. Yeah, I 100% agree. So when I say science and nothing else,</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t mean the science of today because I think overall, I think we are we</p>
<p>know very little. I think most of the things that we&rsquo;re sure of now are going to be, as</p>
<p>you said, are going to look hilarious down the line. So I think we&rsquo;re just at the beginning</p>
<p>of a lot of really important things. When I say nothing but science, I also include</p>
<p>the kind of first person, what I call science that you do. So the interesting thing about</p>
<p>I think about consciousness and studying consciousness and things like that in the first person is</p>
<p>unlike doing science in the third person, where you as the scientist are minimally changed</p>
<p>by it, maybe not at all. So when I do an experiment, I&rsquo;m still me, there&rsquo;s the experiment, whatever</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;ve learned something, so that&rsquo;s a small change. But but overall, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>In order to really study consciousness, you will you are part of the experiment, you will</p>
<p>be altered by that experiment, right? Whatever, whatever it is that you&rsquo;re doing, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some sort of contemplative practice or, or some sort of psychoactive, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>You are now you are now your own experiment, and you are right. And so I consider I fold</p>
<p>that in, I think that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s part of it. I think that exploring our own mind and our</p>
<p>own consciousness is very important. I think much of it is not captured by what currently</p>
<p>is third person science for sure. But ultimately, I include all of that in science, with a capital</p>
<p>S in terms of like a, a rational investigation of both first and third person aspects of</p>
<p>our world.</p>
<p>We are our own experiment, as beautifully put. And when when two systems get to interact</p>
<p>with each other, that&rsquo;s the kind of experiment. So I&rsquo;m deeply honored that you would do this</p>
<p>experiment with me today. Thanks so much. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of your work. Likewise, thank</p>
<p>you for doing everything you&rsquo;re doing. I can&rsquo;t wait to see the kind of incredible things</p>
<p>you build. So thank you for talking. Really appreciate being here. Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to this conversation with Michael Levin. To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from</p>
<p>Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species. From the war of nature, from famine and death,</p>
<p>the most exalted object which we&rsquo;re capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the</p>
<p>higher animals directly follows. There&rsquo;s grandeur in this view of life, with its several</p>
<p>powers having been originally breathed into a few forms, or into one, and that whilst</p>
<p>this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from its most</p>
<p>simpler beginning, endless forms, most beautiful and most wonderful, have been and are being</p>
<p>evolved. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
