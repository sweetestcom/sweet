    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our card today is James Foote, the Seven of Clubs from Florida.</p>
<p>And James&rsquo; story is unlike any that I&rsquo;ve told you since we launched the deck earlier</p>
<p>this year.</p>
<p>With this bonus episode, I want to tell you a story that shows the power of what these</p>
<p>decks can do.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to hear from the guy who invented the decks, about what inspired it,</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re changing cold cases.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to tell you how one of the first ever cold case decks led to a life-changing</p>
<p>discovery for James Foote&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On November 15th, 2004, Donna Foote had just woken up for her 6 a.m. shift at a Fort Myers</p>
<p>Florida hospital, when she realized her husband Jim wasn&rsquo;t in bed beside her.</p>
<p>She knew that Jim had gone out with some friends for karaoke the night before, and he hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been home yet when Donna had gone to bed, but she fully expected him to be next to her</p>
<p>when she woke up.</p>
<p>Donna didn&rsquo;t have time to immediately investigate her husband&rsquo;s whereabouts because she had</p>
<p>to get ready and go to work, and she hoped that by the time she got there, she&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>a message from him explaining his absence.</p>
<p>But there was no voicemail or page from Jim when Donna got to work, so pretty soon she</p>
<p>called home to see what the heck was going on, but there was no answer.</p>
<p>Throughout the morning, Donna kept calling and kept leaving messages on their machine</p>
<p>at home demanding Jim call her.</p>
<p>Now Jim having a late night out with friends wasn&rsquo;t unusual.</p>
<p>Donna was well aware that Jim was going through a phase in his retirement where he was socializing</p>
<p>a lot, and he would routinely hit up bars in Fort Myers if he knew that they were having</p>
<p>karaoke.</p>
<p>Donna told our team that her husband was a friend of the friendless, which just meant</p>
<p>that he liked to strike up conversations with people, and he could befriend pretty much</p>
<p>anybody.</p>
<p>The night before was a Sunday, and Donna&rsquo;s daughter Casey had come over and they had</p>
<p>all had dinner together.</p>
<p>Jim was just heading out for karaoke when Donna was getting ready for bed, and when</p>
<p>he kissed her goodbye, everything was fine.</p>
<p>When Jim went out, he was always home by the time she got up for work, which is why she</p>
<p>was so worried about him now.</p>
<p>All morning her emotions were ping-ponging from worried to angry, back to worried, and</p>
<p>And then finally, mid-morning around 10, Donna&rsquo;s worst fear, the worst case scenario she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been trying to push out of her mind the whole morning, was realized.</p>
<p>I was at work, and two people came in, a police officer and I guess a social worker or a victim</p>
<p>advocate, I really don&rsquo;t know, and they said, your husband&rsquo;s been in an accident.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m in the hospital.</p>
<p>Okay, where?</p>
<p>Which hospital?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Oh, no, he&rsquo;s been murdered.</p>
<p>The next thing Donna knew, she was being escorted out of the hospital and driven home</p>
<p>by the social worker.</p>
<p>Still in a state of shock, Donna considered what she&rsquo;d just heard.</p>
<p>Maybe the whole thing was a big mistake.</p>
<p>Who would want Jim dead?</p>
<p>Her precious Jimmy, who was liked by everyone.</p>
<p>The two lived quiet lives for the most part, and they were due on a tropical cruise with</p>
<p>their best friends in less than five days.</p>
<p>Within a few hours, people were swarming Donna&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Her parents rushed there.</p>
<p>Her daughter left work and came over.</p>
<p>Her best friend even got on the next plane out of D.C. and headed straight to Southwest</p>
<p>Florida.</p>
<p>Casey, Donna&rsquo;s daughter, who was Jim&rsquo;s stepdaughter, was also in shock.</p>
<p>Again, she had just been at their dinner table the night before, just hours ago, and everything</p>
<p>had seemed totally fine.</p>
<p>I mean, I was like wrapping Christmas presents for him like the night before, like, you know</p>
<p>what I mean?</p>
<p>It was like mid-November.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, oh, just sitting there wrapping presents.</p>
<p>I mean, you just don&rsquo;t think that like your last meal with someone&rsquo;s like the last time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see them.</p>
<p>Overcome with emotion, Donna was faced with all those critical decisions right after an</p>
<p>unexpected death.</p>
<p>How do you make funeral plans for your 47-year-old husband?</p>
<p>Wills and last wishes were not part of their dinner table conversations yet, because they</p>
<p>were still busy living their lives.</p>
<p>When detectives got to Donna&rsquo;s house around two that afternoon, there was a vibe shift.</p>
<p>Obviously, Donna had a lot of questions, like who Jim had been with when he was murdered,</p>
<p>who Jim had been with when he was murdered, and where had he been?</p>
<p>Officers told Donna that Jim had been shot sometime around 1.30 a.m. Sunday in the parking</p>
<p>lot of a place called The Office Pub in Fort Myers.</p>
<p>As best they could tell, Jim was shot before he even made it into the bar, so there were</p>
<p>almost no witnesses and no surveillance footage to help.</p>
<p>He was found bleeding from the chest as he lay on the ground next to his car with his</p>
<p>wallet and jewelry still on him.</p>
<p>His body was taken to the medical examiner&rsquo;s office for autopsy, and his death was ruled</p>
<p>a homicide by gunshot wound.</p>
<p>After detectives filled Donna in on everything they knew, they started asking her questions.</p>
<p>They wanted to know about Jim&rsquo;s last movements and about their marriage, and Donna told them</p>
<p>everything had been fine the night before, and it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for Jim to be out</p>
<p>for karaoke while she was in bed.</p>
<p>If Donna had to prove to police that she&rsquo;d been worried sick about her husband, all they</p>
<p>had to do was play the voicemail messages that she&rsquo;d been leaving on their home machine</p>
<p>all morning.</p>
<p>Jim, where the bleep are ya?</p>
<p>You know, call me, page me when you get in, you know, and nothing, nothing, nothing.</p>
<p>Donna told police Jim being a late-night bar fly was just the dynamic of their relationship</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>Jim was six years older than her and had already retired, and he didn&rsquo;t like just sitting</p>
<p>at home and watching TV every night.</p>
<p>He liked to keep busy.</p>
<p>I liked my job.</p>
<p>I liked to go to work.</p>
<p>So I couldn&rsquo;t go out partying all night long.</p>
<p>You know, you did your stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you played golf during the day.</p>
<p>He would go to the pool.</p>
<p>And then at night, you know, he just didn&rsquo;t want to sit and watch television.</p>
<p>Well, when you get up at four in the morning, I have to go to bed early.</p>
<p>So he would definitely attract not the best element.</p>
<p>Some of the wrong friends.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Donna told police that she met Jim back home in New Jersey in 1990, and they fell for each</p>
<p>other fast.</p>
<p>Jim was tall and had this huge bright smile and a bushy mustache that covered his entire</p>
<p>upper lip.</p>
<p>They got married in 91, and years later, Jim, an ironworker, was injured on the job and</p>
<p>had to go on disability.</p>
<p>He told Donna that he was ready to live somewhere warm.</p>
<p>So in 1999, they made the move to Fort Myers.</p>
<p>They bought a condo and loved the lifestyle in Southwest Florida.</p>
<p>They went on three cruises a year with their best friends and kept busy on weekends by</p>
<p>going out, going to the pool and to the beach and just having fun.</p>
<p>Donna told detectives that Jim was fun-loving and often socialized with people she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know.</p>
<p>He would meet people at the golf course or out of the bars, and they&rsquo;d be fast friends.</p>
<p>His outgoing nature was actually one of the many reasons she loved Jim.</p>
<p>Donna told police that Jim was going through a partying phase.</p>
<p>He was the type that just couldn&rsquo;t sit still for very long.</p>
<p>And when he got into something, he became obsessed over it.</p>
<p>She said he went through a working out phase where that was all he focused on, and one</p>
<p>time he got into fishing and went all day every day.</p>
<p>Now, this particular phase he was in was a karaoke bar obsession.</p>
<p>So in that regard, retirement was a challenge for Jim.</p>
<p>He was feeling restless.</p>
<p>Detectives said that they were going to try and find witnesses, and they left Donna to</p>
<p>continue planning for Jim&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>When our team was in Florida interviewing Donna for this episode, she recalled those</p>
<p>first few weeks being very hard.</p>
<p>Not only did she not know who killed her husband or why, but there was so much to do and figure</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>Donna said that she would take on one task at a time between breakdowns.</p>
<p>I would do that and tell myself I can do this, and then I&rsquo;ll come home and I&rsquo;ll meltdown.</p>
<p>And then, like Casey said, we&rsquo;d buy Christmas presents and, you know, I would unwrap them</p>
<p>and then say, okay, today I&rsquo;m going to return these three presents and then I&rsquo;ll meltdown.</p>
<p>Weeks went by with very little news on Jim&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Donna said police had virtually no leads.</p>
<p>They said they had tracked down a man who stayed with Jim until first responders got</p>
<p>there, but that he didn&rsquo;t have a ton of helpful information.</p>
<p>Desperate for answers, Donna wanted to talk to the man.</p>
<p>So they thought they heard gunshots.</p>
<p>And what this person told me is he said, help, I&rsquo;ve been shot.</p>
<p>And then you can see the body.</p>
<p>You could see the people running out.</p>
<p>And one person stayed with him, and I called him.</p>
<p>He was equally as hysterical as I was.</p>
<p>And I said, did he say anything?</p>
<p>You know, you always wonder, did he tell my wife I love her?</p>
<p>You know, stupid things like that, you know.</p>
<p>And he said, no.</p>
<p>Donna and Casey started an investigation of their own to see if they could turn up any</p>
<p>information that would be helpful.</p>
<p>But what they soon realized was just how little evidence law enforcement actually had.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, I really don&rsquo;t know of any evidence that they have, like not one thing</p>
<p>from the scene.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I know that there was a person sleeping in their car when it happened that they let</p>
<p>go from the scene.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even think interviewed.</p>
<p>And that was about it.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, they said that they never recovered anything.</p>
<p>So there was nothing you could compare to a firearm, nothing.</p>
<p>Police had to move on and work on other murder cases in the months following Jim&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And eventually, Donna questioned whether or not she would ever find out what happened</p>
<p>to her husband.</p>
<p>She was going through all the stages of mourning.</p>
<p>And after having him cremated, she put Jim&rsquo;s ashes in a closet at home, unable to even</p>
<p>display them or spread them in his honor.</p>
<p>We kind of just gave up and let it see what happened.</p>
<p>And I will tell you that I was mad at him.</p>
<p>I was mad at Jim.</p>
<p>You know, they can tell you all about the grieving process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still mad at him.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t gotten past the anger.</p>
<p>Finally, three long years after Jim&rsquo;s murder, in the fall of 2007, information came in from</p>
<p>an unlikely source, and it changed everything.</p>
<p>So the prisoners are playing cards because I guess that&rsquo;s what they do all day.</p>
<p>And here he is playing, he goes, oh, I killed that ****.</p>
<p>The Fort Myers Police Department had received a letter from an inmate who was locked up</p>
<p>in Miami.</p>
<p>He said that he knew who killed James Foote.</p>
<p>Police traveled to Miami to interview the informant who said that he knew another inmate</p>
<p>Detectives located the other informant at a different jail who verified the information</p>
<p>and said Dollar Bill was a man named Derrick Lamar Hamilton.</p>
<p>The informant said that in the summer of 2007, they were all in jail together playing cards</p>
<p>and that the cards had faces of murder victims on them.</p>
<p>And when Derrick came across Jim&rsquo;s card, he confessed to the crime.</p>
<p>He said that he was a victim of a murder.</p>
<p>And when Derrick came across Jim&rsquo;s card, he confessed to killing him.</p>
<p>As police continued to work to verify the information, there was one thing that convinced</p>
<p>them the tips were credible.</p>
<p>The inmate said Derrick told them that he had killed Jim with a .32 caliber gun that</p>
<p>had been stolen in a burglary.</p>
<p>Now the caliber of the gun was never released to the public, so Derrick wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>had any way of knowing that information if he wasn&rsquo;t good for the shooting.</p>
<p>According to court records our reporter Emily obtained, the informants went on to say that</p>
<p>Derrick said Jim deserved what he got because he owed him money for drugs.</p>
<p>Police tracked down and arrested Derrick Hamilton on October 17, 2007.</p>
<p>Derrick told the officers that someone must be just trying to pin the murder on him and</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>They took him to the Lee County Jail where he was charged with felony murder.</p>
<p>When this all went down, Donna happened to be up in New Jersey because after all of those</p>
<p>years of having Jim&rsquo;s ashes in the closet, she had finally decided it was time to honor him.</p>
<p>I get it on the plane, I take it up to New Jersey, I meet my friend, she comes from DC,</p>
<p>she meets me there and I sprinkled it in the ocean, stayed in Atlantic City for a few days</p>
<p>and flew home.</p>
<p>When Donna got back home to Florida, right as she was wheeling her suitcase inside, her</p>
<p>phone was ringing.</p>
<p>It was a detective who said, quote, I just wanted to let you know we arrested the person</p>
<p>who killed Jim, end quote.</p>
<p>Donna had never heard of a man named Derrick Hamilton.</p>
<p>And after that, Donna&rsquo;s phone was ringing off the hook as the news spread.</p>
<p>The cold case cards, which started in Florida, had led to other tips about unsolved murders</p>
<p>around the state, but Jim&rsquo;s was the first to result in an arrest and the press ran wild</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>Headlines and articles full of card game puns ran in newspapers and TV stations all</p>
<p>around Florida.</p>
<p>The cards were the brainchild of Tommy Ray, who at the time was a special agent for the</p>
<p>Florida Department of Law Enforcement, better known as FDLE.</p>
<p>Tommy worked in policing for decades and had a habit of asking inmates if they had any</p>
<p>information about any unsolved murders any time he was in a jail or prison for an investigation.</p>
<p>That simple, open-ended question of, hey, what do you know about other murders paid</p>
<p>off all the time.</p>
<p>You know, at that time, I think it was like 37 years I had been in law enforcement.</p>
<p>So I knew how much criminal intelligence are in each one of the prisons, in the jails.</p>
<p>So at that time, I mean, I was thinking, well, if I could just interview every inmate in</p>
<p>this prison, you know, about these cold cases, there&rsquo;s no telling how many we could solve.</p>
<p>So in 2005, Tommy pitched the idea of putting the photos of 52 murder victims or missing</p>
<p>people in the hands of inmates by way of decks of cards.</p>
<p>So at one of the cold case assessment team meetings, I brought up, I said, look, I got</p>
<p>this idea and I mean, it was a packed house.</p>
<p>So I said about putting unsolved murders on these cards and let&rsquo;s put them in the jails</p>
<p>and missing persons as well.</p>
<p>One of the lieutenants with the local sheriff&rsquo;s office said, Tommy, that&rsquo;s about the dumbest</p>
<p>idea I ever heard.</p>
<p>And he said, you&rsquo;re going to have my guys chasing their tails as far as like all these</p>
<p>false confessions and false leads.</p>
<p>And I basically told him, you know, if your guys are worth their salt, they&rsquo;ll know in</p>
<p>about five minutes whether, you know, this is a legitimate call or not.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people wasn&rsquo;t on board, but then some of them were like, yeah, that might</p>
<p>be a good idea.</p>
<p>Tommy got the green light and a grant and handpicked 52 unsolved cases to feature in</p>
<p>the very first deck.</p>
<p>They started small and only passed them out in a local jail.</p>
<p>So we put in the 52 cases.</p>
<p>We put them into the local jail there in Polk County in Bartow, Florida.</p>
<p>And within a couple of months, we get a call.</p>
<p>You know, at first it was like, OK, cards are in, nobody&rsquo;s calling, everybody&rsquo;s losing</p>
<p>interest, you know, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hey, give them time, you know, don&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>Not long after that, two cases were solved because of tips that had come in from inmates</p>
<p>seeing the cards.</p>
<p>And in 2007, the first ever statewide deck was distributed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the deck that Jim Foote was on.</p>
<p>Media coverage of the success spread, and pretty soon Tommy was getting calls from law</p>
<p>enforcement agencies all over, wanting to know how FDLE went about making the cards.</p>
<p>I even got a call from Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>I had a constable, Sue Stallins, call me up and she goes, I just saw on the Internet,</p>
<p>you know, your idea.</p>
<p>And she said, it&rsquo;s such a great idea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to start something here.</p>
<p>How do you go about it?</p>
<p>More than a dozen different U.S.</p>
<p>states today have adopted the idea and printed their own cold case decks.</p>
<p>For years, Tommy tried to keep track of all the new decks that were being printed, but</p>
<p>eventually it was just too many to keep up with.</p>
<p>But from his count, at least 30 cases have been solved directly because of the cards.</p>
<p>Incarcerated people talk to each other, and Tommy credits them for knowing when to come forward.</p>
<p>I mean, before we even got the cards and a couple of them, they were like, look, if this</p>
<p>was drugs or this was a burglary, I would never turn another inmate in.</p>
<p>But this is a murderer.</p>
<p>This could be my mother, father, sister, brother kind of thing.</p>
<p>So this, you know, is something that I may be in here for doing something bad, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not a murderer.</p>
<p>A lot of people in there, they&rsquo;re not criminals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve made mistakes.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are some criminals in there, but for the most part, a lot of them,</p>
<p>they want to do the right thing, you know.</p>
<p>And this gives them an opportunity to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And one of the cases, I don&rsquo;t recall which one, the guy didn&rsquo;t even want to take the</p>
<p>reward that was being offered, you know, from Crimestoppers.</p>
<p>And my understanding, after he was out and I think he was just in there for a DUI or</p>
<p>something, it wasn&rsquo;t a major offense.</p>
<p>And he ended up giving the reward to the family of the victim.</p>
<p>Tommy is happy that so many other states have run with his idea.</p>
<p>He said at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s about getting answers and getting justice for victims.</p>
<p>And sometimes taking an approach that&rsquo;s a little out of the box is worth a shot.</p>
<p>I just know from myself working homicide cases, satisfaction and the joy.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s never really, to me, closure for the family members because they&rsquo;ll think</p>
<p>about it for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>But it gives them somewhat satisfaction.</p>
<p>One less thing to worry about, you know, or be on their mind about this case not being</p>
<p>solved and what actually happened.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s it is satisfying in that regards.</p>
<p>For so many years, these cards have only been tools used within law enforcement.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback that we&rsquo;ve gotten since we launched the show, most people had</p>
<p>never even heard of them until now.</p>
<p>But sharing them with the public opens up so many doors for potential new leads.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so appreciative that the word is getting out and it&rsquo;s been spread.</p>
<p>And like I said, there&rsquo;s a whole new generation of people out there that don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anything about it and can come forward with information, you know, whether it be in</p>
<p>prison or just from the media of the cards being talked about.</p>
<p>Every week you hear me talk about a different case that&rsquo;s on a cold case card, our</p>
<p>reporters have collected so many different decks from South Carolina, Colorado, Utah,</p>
<p>Idaho, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, Kentucky, D.C., North Carolina, Indiana,</p>
<p>Nebraska, California, Oregon, Washington, Missouri, honestly, so many more places in</p>
<p>between. And our team is still collecting decks today that we didn&rsquo;t even know existed</p>
<p>before, all to tell the stories of the victims who are still awaiting justice.</p>
<p>Do you think if he wasn&rsquo;t Jim wasn&rsquo;t on the deck of cards, do you think it would have</p>
<p>been solved? No, no, absolutely not, because I don&rsquo;t even know if he knew his name.</p>
<p>Like if he was if say there was like a story or something about it, the guy could have</p>
<p>been like, you know, I killed him.</p>
<p>Or if they were just like talking about what they did and why they were in jail playing</p>
<p>regular cards, I feel like he would have been like, I killed some guy or whatever.</p>
<p>But I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know if he would have known his name if he didn&rsquo;t know him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just some guy.</p>
<p>Derek Hamilton ended up pleading no contest in Jim Foote&rsquo;s murder, and he was</p>
<p>sentenced in 2009.</p>
<p>Donna said that, of course, it felt good to have him held responsible, but that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean she understands.</p>
<p>I mean, according to what police said, Derek killed Jim over a drug debt.</p>
<p>But Donna says that the only drug Jim liked was marijuana.</p>
<p>And it goes without saying no one&rsquo;s life is worth a weed debt.</p>
<p>I would love someone someday to explain to me what closure is.</p>
<p>How can you have there&rsquo;s no I don&rsquo;t believe there is anything your loved one is gone.</p>
<p>It would be nice to know why.</p>
<p>But is that going to change anything?</p>
<p>Donna agreed to doing an interview with us because she feels like if anyone is</p>
<p>considering printing new cold case decks, this should be their sign to do it.</p>
<p>Without Jim&rsquo;s seven of clubs getting into the right hands, they might still be waiting</p>
<p>for answers today.</p>
<p>Cold case decks aren&rsquo;t even just a law enforcement tool anymore.</p>
<p>Nonprofits and victims advocates all around the U.S.</p>
<p>have printed decks by paying for them out of pocket or even crowdfunding.</p>
<p>We think it&rsquo;d be worthwhile to get a cold case deck in every U.S.</p>
<p>state, which is why the deck is funding a grant through the nonprofit Season of</p>
<p>Justice to help fund printing of new decks.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening to this and want to apply for a grant to create or print a</p>
<p>deck, you can find information on that on the Season of Justice website,</p>
<p>seasonofjustice.org.</p>
