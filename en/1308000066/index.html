    <p>We don&rsquo;t want to talk about Andrew. I think that guy Palmer</p>
<p>lucky is super fascinating. The Oculus. Why do you want to talk</p>
<p>about that company? Because I think he&rsquo;s launching a syndicate</p>
<p>soon. No, why are you an investor? Lucky hates me. He</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t come on this week and startups. He literally what did</p>
<p>you call him Parma lucky. Palmer lucky cosplay Palmer. He&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cosplayer. I like the fact that he does. What is that? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you dress up as comic book or like superhero characters and</p>
<p>go to conventions. You dress up in the clothes of old Italian</p>
<p>women. He dresses up like a superhero. He&rsquo;s a cold open</p>
<p>folks. I do dress like a Matrona sometimes. Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m a I&rsquo;m making you a. You know in in in in Italy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a culture like in the in the olden days like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you used to have these things called which basically</p>
<p>meant like all the decisions of the country were made by these</p>
<p>people in the living rooms after dinner and you know the</p>
<p>the most powerful people in the were uh these women who are</p>
<p>married to these men and they would be the architects of all</p>
<p>these decisions. I don&rsquo;t like him. He never finished the</p>
<p>pasta. He always leave us so much on the plate and people</p>
<p>and people would call them Matronas. Uh so I I&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>be a Matrona. I&rsquo;ve always felt you were like the old Italian</p>
<p>lady in our group.</p>
<p>Rain man David Sacks.</p>
<p>And I said we open sources to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone</p>
<p>crazy with it. Love you guys. Queen of Kinwam. Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast. Yes, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still publishing. Yes, we haven&rsquo;t been canceled but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>early in the show so you never know. Uh with me again, the</p>
<p>dictator himself, the sultan of science, David Friedberg,</p>
<p>whatever beverage you like, he&rsquo;ll make it for you right now</p>
<p>and his replicator and of course, yeah, the rain man</p>
<p>himself. Yeah, definitely gonna win the midterms. Yeah, David</p>
<p>Sacks. Everybody have a great week getting their **** kicked</p>
<p>in the market. I&rsquo;m pretty good. You&rsquo;re okay? Everybody okay?</p>
<p>Nobody. I can&rsquo;t look at my portfolio anymore. I just</p>
<p>stopped checking it. I uh not a fan of the color red. I</p>
<p>actually um I I&rsquo;ve been using this period to kind of</p>
<p>desensitize myself. Um I went back and I started to think</p>
<p>about like all of the sort of errors of commission that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done in like the last decade and I I was able to look at</p>
<p>like four or five specific trading moments where I was</p>
<p>like, wow, what did I do that for? And I came away with two</p>
<p>things. One was if I confuse an investment with a trade, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>done for meaning like there are things that you invest in that</p>
<p>you just want to own forever and then there are things that</p>
<p>are trades that are just speculative and you know, at</p>
<p>the end of the day, you have a sense that it could be up in</p>
<p>the short term. If I confuse those two, I&rsquo;ve made huge</p>
<p>mistakes and then the other one is I would always get really</p>
<p>emotional and panic at the lows and so I was like, you know, in</p>
<p>early December or November when I wrote that letter on Twitter</p>
<p>and we talked about it and I sold a bunch of stuff after</p>
<p>Jeff and and Elon were selling, raise some cash and I was like,</p>
<p>okay, now, I have enough buffer here. The whole point from here</p>
<p>on out is to basically like insulate myself from my own</p>
<p>emotional turmoil as stocks go down and so far so good and my</p>
<p>litmus test if when I go home uh at the end of every day, you</p>
<p>know, I check in with Nat and I&rsquo;m like, am I an **** because</p>
<p>if I, when I can, yes, what does that have to do with</p>
<p>when I get crushed in the market, I tend to, I tend to</p>
<p>take it out on my friends and my loved ones. Honestly, because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, we know, we come to your poker game when your socks</p>
<p>are down and you&rsquo;re just like, oh my god, at once, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m popping the blinds up. I can&rsquo;t take it anymore. Do you</p>
<p>remember last year, Tim off during the uh the market</p>
<p>collapse uh when at the start of COVID and you decided you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t care about having nice jeans anymore and then you fast</p>
<p>forward to December and you&rsquo;re proclaiming the virtue of a</p>
<p>$5000 fresh alpaca sweater or whatever. I think I think</p>
<p>another another indicator of sentiment in the market for you</p>
<p>is your clothing. Oh my god. Uh choice but this is a this is a</p>
<p>really nice cashmere ribbed sweater from Loro Piana. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re back in the games. It&rsquo;s good to see we&rsquo;re back to</p>
<p>normal now. Yeah, let me ask you then. I&rsquo;m gonna put a couple</p>
<p>of uh items out there. Is Bitcoin a trade for you or an</p>
<p>investment for you? Or was it and is it now? Well, I invested</p>
<p>in 2011 at $80. Yeah. Yum yum. I wrote an op-ed in that same</p>
<p>year in Bloomberg which I hope at some point they take off the</p>
<p>paywall. Yeah. And the whole thing was you should have 1% of</p>
<p>your net worth in this thing. Yeah. It&rsquo;s remained an</p>
<p>investment ever since. So, still an investment. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>structured it so that I don&rsquo;t hold any Bitcoin personally</p>
<p>myself cuz I don&rsquo;t want to have the pressure and the risk of</p>
<p>keys and coins and wallets and this and that. But uh I still</p>
<p>really believe in Bitcoin in the long term. Got it. Sax, how</p>
<p>do you how how do you deal with the emotional turmoil of</p>
<p>opening up your stocks, crypto, whatever wallet and seeing red</p>
<p>and then going to work every day or you just curled up in a</p>
<p>ball playing chess with Peter Thiel at this point? Yeah, I</p>
<p>mean, you just gotta try and ignore it. Okay. Try try was a</p>
<p>key word in that sentence. It doesn&rsquo;t really affect me that</p>
<p>much. I mean, so. I run the avoidance acceptance function.</p>
<p>I have removed my emotions. No, look, there are there are</p>
<p>countervailing benefits. So, when exit prices are great,</p>
<p>entry prices are lousy and when when entry prices are great,</p>
<p>exit prices are lousy. So, there&rsquo;s an inverse relationship.</p>
<p>So, in other words, all the the companies that, I mean, the</p>
<p>the public markets have massively corrected and though</p>
<p>and and now finally, you know, we talked about this few few</p>
<p>months ago. Those new price levels have trickled their way</p>
<p>down into venture markets and so finally, you know, venture</p>
<p>deals are starting to price at more reasonable prices. So, in</p>
<p>terms of harvesting gains from old investments, obviously,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as attractive as it was 3 months ago but in terms of</p>
<p>making new investments is much more attractive and for a</p>
<p>relatively young venture firm, which is what we are, you know,</p>
<p>we yes, we do have some investments that are kind of in</p>
<p>the harvesting stage but you know, we&rsquo;re only a four or five</p>
<p>year old firm. We&rsquo;re still, the bulk of our activity is making</p>
<p>new investments. So, you know, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all just</p>
<p>kind of part of the game and I&rsquo;m not really that worried</p>
<p>about it. Said another way, fortunes are made in the down</p>
<p>market. They&rsquo;re collected in the up market is the way I always</p>
<p>phrase it but it&rsquo;s true. Things are going to be on sale right</p>
<p>now. We saw Bill Ackman, I think, who I think is a friend</p>
<p>of the pod. I think he listens. Yeah. Super, super, super smart,</p>
<p>brilliant guy. Yeah and I just, I just want to emphasize</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want founders to get the wrong idea. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re trying to pull one over on founders and get some</p>
<p>sort of sweetheart deal or something like that. My view of</p>
<p>like our role as VCs is just to be a price taker of whatever</p>
<p>price is the market sets. We don&rsquo;t try and negotiate</p>
<p>something better than market really. We just take the market</p>
<p>price and we pick the companies we want to be in. So, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our job is really just to pick, not really to negotiate that</p>
<p>much. You&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not able to haggle. It&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>you can go. Yeah, exactly. The market is super competitive.</p>
<p>Like, oh, bananas are a dollar a pound. I&rsquo;ll take them for 50</p>
<p>cents. They&rsquo;re like, sir, this is a Whole Foods. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>negotiate. Right. So, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re a price taker in,</p>
<p>in good markets or bad markets and it&rsquo;s just that I think that</p>
<p>the prices now are coming down because what I&rsquo;ve heard is that</p>
<p>the crossover investors like Tiger, like KOTU who are</p>
<p>deploying all this money, they&rsquo;ve really slowed down now.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re all kind of licking their wounds and so</p>
<p>like all of this money that was flooding into the venture</p>
<p>space is kind of on pause right now and that&rsquo;s caused the price</p>
<p>levels to drop. The end of last year in Q4, my public</p>
<p>portfolio really started to turn over. Took a huge amount</p>
<p>of losses going into the end of the year and then I took an</p>
<p>accounting obviously of like the entire book and the public</p>
<p>portfolio. Every single thing that I owned ultimately</p>
<p>basically broke even last year. Some were up. I made some early</p>
<p>sales. Some were way down by the end of the year. Net, net, I</p>
<p>kind of broke even. But my private book was up a billion</p>
<p>dollars and I told the team, I&rsquo;m like, no, this is not real. So,</p>
<p>we have to take those marks because you know, you have other</p>
<p>venture firms that are pricing these deals and we get audited</p>
<p>K1s and so we have to take the up billion but I told them, you</p>
<p>should consider this that we had basically a down, you know,</p>
<p>so net, net, our returns were like, you know, we were up like</p>
<p>15% and I said, this is not real. We were at best break</p>
<p>even and probably we lost money. But you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>not take these marks because like, you know, you have an</p>
<p>entire fund complex that lives on these marks. Yeah and by the</p>
<p>way, it doesn&rsquo;t affect my compensation at all but I have</p>
<p>to take it. Freeberg, then Sachs. Go ahead, Freeberg. No,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a really important point because I think</p>
<p>we talked about this one or two episodes ago but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>significant disincentive for venture firms to take</p>
<p>markdowns, to raise capital into a private business at a</p>
<p>price that&rsquo;s lower than the prior round because when they</p>
<p>do that, the marked value of their portfolio goes down and</p>
<p>then it makes it harder for that venture firm to go out and</p>
<p>raise the next fund that they&rsquo;re going to try and raise</p>
<p>from their LPs because it looks like they&rsquo;re not good</p>
<p>investors. And the reality is, and so in every round, as</p>
<p>everyone on this pod knows, there&rsquo;s always an incentive and</p>
<p>a push to see can you get the valuation higher, even if the</p>
<p>business performance didn&rsquo;t meet the objectives of the</p>
<p>prior round, and things have gone sideways a bit doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily mean that it&rsquo;s a bad business, but it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily mean that it should always be getting an up round</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s being kept alive. And there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>artificial pressure in private equity in venture to always</p>
<p>drive the value up or to run away from the company, because</p>
<p>otherwise you&rsquo;re going to have this markdown and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to be putting money in a markdown that looks like a</p>
<p>loser, and so on. And if you look at the public markets,</p>
<p>every successful company has had significant downturns in</p>
<p>their stock for significant periods of time, from Apple to</p>
<p>Facebook, to Amazon, to Netflix, and all of those</p>
<p>businesses were sound businesses. It&rsquo;s just that for</p>
<p>whatever reason, there were perturbations in markets</p>
<p>perturbations in the business, but the long term value</p>
<p>creation was still there. And so I think we need to kind of,</p>
<p>you know, be really thoughtful. You know, and entrepreneurs</p>
<p>should be very thoughtful not to give in to the venture</p>
<p>mandate to always drive value up, but to be really thoughtful</p>
<p>about getting the right valuation for your business and</p>
<p>getting the capital you need with the right partners.</p>
<p>Can I say something about this? It&rsquo;s so important what you said</p>
<p>one of the tactics that I started three years ago was I</p>
<p>run my own shadow portfolio, where I don&rsquo;t take the marks,</p>
<p>and I just keep them at my cost basis. And I&rsquo;m not allowed to</p>
<p>use that for anything. I don&rsquo;t, you know, I can&rsquo;t use that.</p>
<p>Obviously, I would never use that for compensation with my</p>
<p>team or anything else. But I use it in my own head to say,</p>
<p>okay, if I invested $1, let&rsquo;s not think about what somebody</p>
<p>else may think about what that dollar is worth. Let&rsquo;s just keep</p>
<p>it at $1 unless it&rsquo;s impaired, but I don&rsquo;t take the markups.</p>
<p>And I look at my portfolio that way. But it&rsquo;s a very difficult</p>
<p>thing to do. And the reason I do that is because I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the pressure to raise incremental funds. But if I did,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play that game. And I&rsquo;d be very focused on</p>
<p>making sure other VCs marked up my deals, because to your</p>
<p>point, it takes 1012 years to drive liquidity, literally,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the key here. And so what are you supposed to do if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a venture business in year three or four, except raise</p>
<p>money on markups, paper markups are the they&rsquo;re the they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the lifeblood of what this industry going? Yeah,</p>
<p>totally. Well, I mean, the interesting thing for me is I</p>
<p>LP a couple of these small like emerging fund managers, you know,</p>
<p>micro funds, 10 million or so 3 million, and they were sending</p>
<p>like a lot of updates. And so I&rsquo;m in some top tier venture</p>
<p>firms that some of you are in. And they send you an audit every</p>
<p>year. And they send you a distribution cash on cash,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re at. And then I was getting like quarterly</p>
<p>emails, as everything was going up, these new fund managers are</p>
<p>like, we&rsquo;re at 100 IRR, we&rsquo;re at 200% IRR, because this crypto</p>
<p>investment we did got marked up. And I was just thinking about</p>
<p>what Bill Gurley would always say, which I think is a Howard</p>
<p>Marx quote, you can&rsquo;t eat IRR. Like, what are we doing here?</p>
<p>Like, why is there such a focus on this is because you want to</p>
<p>raise your next fund. And then the other game people were</p>
<p>playing was, and I got into this, because people were like,</p>
<p>Oh, you know, you&rsquo;re grossly undervaluing your funds, because</p>
<p>Robin Hood is trading at $30 a share on the private markets</p>
<p>calm is trading at this in the private markets. And the second</p>
<p>people were using secondary market transactions as their</p>
<p>mark. So I&rsquo;m curious, Saks, how do you think about if you</p>
<p>invested in a company, the series B was $100 a share, but</p>
<p>then somebody bought it at 150 a share in the private markets?</p>
<p>Where do you like to mark that in your funds? Or how do you</p>
<p>think about that? And getting ahead of your skis in terms of</p>
<p>valuing your private funds?</p>
<p>Well, to most points, we have accounting rules around this. So</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t like subjectively decide like what mark to set for</p>
<p>each company for, you know, obvious reasons, our LP is one</p>
<p>like, predictable accounting. So the way it generally works is</p>
<p>that you the mark is set by the most recent private, you know,</p>
<p>financing. This is the way it works. And if people want to</p>
<p>discount it from there, they certainly can, you know,</p>
<p>what about a secondary transaction? Is there any</p>
<p>more complicated rules around that, because it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>class of stock. So it&rsquo;s some combination of sometimes we use</p>
<p>a foreign a sometimes it&rsquo;s the latest preferred round, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, it just, there&rsquo;s like complicated rules around it.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;ll just to rehash what was already said. And just</p>
<p>to say one more time to mark pointed out that it typically</p>
<p>takes 12 years to liquidity from the time a startup is initially</p>
<p>funded to the time that you sell it or go public. Show me one</p>
<p>public company that has had 12 years of consistent, consistent</p>
<p>gain in its stock price. It doesn&rsquo;t exist. And so again,</p>
<p>like this, this notion that, you know, every startup is seeing</p>
<p>some perpetual persistent increase in value is an</p>
<p>artifice that doesn&rsquo;t really represent it doesn&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist in tech. And that&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Right? Meaning the things that can go up predictably for 10 to</p>
<p>12 years are not necessarily business. They don&rsquo;t take risk.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not dynamic. No, they don&rsquo;t take risk. Yeah. Saks,</p>
<p>can you define perturbation for the audience? I heard freeberg</p>
<p>say that a couple of times.</p>
<p>perturbation would be perturbation changes what like</p>
<p>volatility, basically, yeah, rapid change anxiety, mental</p>
<p>uneasiness. Okay, a cause of anxiety or uneasiness. Okay, I</p>
<p>got it. I thought you were saying another word. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>use the word perturbation. I thought you said another word.</p>
<p>What word was in your brain? I thought I heard masturbation. I</p>
<p>was like, master. What exactly did he say about the markets?</p>
<p>Speaking of markets, we were on a text on our text thread</p>
<p>talking about if we&rsquo;re about to have the start of World War</p>
<p>Three. And then maybe this is not in the news. Now. How do we</p>
<p>look at the UK, Russia situation in the Ukraine, obviously,</p>
<p>100,000 troops are amassing on a border. And what is the goal</p>
<p>here? Because Biden is saying, Hey, listen, if anything</p>
<p>happens, we&rsquo;re gonna go to war. And there&rsquo;s a lot of saber</p>
<p>rattling here. I don&rsquo;t exactly understand what Putin&rsquo;s goal</p>
<p>or motivation is. And that&rsquo;s, I think, what I&rsquo;m not hearing in</p>
<p>the news is exactly what is his goal? What are your thoughts on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the Ukraine and Russia? sex?</p>
<p>Okay, well, I think first of all, we have to kind of level</p>
<p>set in historical terms about how unusual and unprecedented</p>
<p>it would be for us to send troops to fight, you know,</p>
<p>potentially Russia in a border conflict with Ukraine. With and</p>
<p>by the way, the Biden put 8500 troops on alert for deployment</p>
<p>this week. It&rsquo;s really without historical precedent. During the</p>
<p>Cold War. You know, in 1956, Soviet tanks rolled into</p>
<p>Hungary to crush rebels there. Eisenhower did nothing. 1968</p>
<p>Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia to crush the</p>
<p>Prague Spring. LBJ did nothing. 1981. The Soviets crushed the</p>
<p>solidarity movement in Poland. Ronald Reagan did nothing even</p>
<p>though he had campaigned on getting tough with the Soviets.</p>
<p>And then more recently in 2008. When Russia invaded Georgia,</p>
<p>George W. Bush did not intervene militarily. And then</p>
<p>2014, when Putin occupied Crimea, Obama did nothing. And</p>
<p>so this idea and the reason for that in all those cases is</p>
<p>because America has a vital national interest in avoiding</p>
<p>war with a nuclear armed Russia. And we did not have a vital</p>
<p>national interest in defending the territorial sovereignty of</p>
<p>those nations. That&rsquo;s the bottom line. And so for us to be now</p>
<p>beating the drums of war and talking about sending troops</p>
<p>into a war zone with Russia, is just it&rsquo;s unbelievably</p>
<p>irresponsible.</p>
<p>Friedberg, one might speculate, if they were cynical, some sort</p>
<p>of wag the dog situation here, Biden&rsquo;s not doing well, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lowest popularity ever. midterms are coming up. Is there</p>
<p>any political motivation here? Do you think in what Biden&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actions are, you know, given the context of what Sachs just</p>
<p>outlined?</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s, this is like showing up to the, you</p>
<p>know, the last 20 minutes of a two hour movie, and then saying,</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh, what&rsquo;s this guy doing? He&rsquo;s so crazy. There&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>long narrative that precedes the current news cycle on what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening with Putin and the Ukraine. You know, in large</p>
<p>part, the United States helped to start the fuel, the expansion</p>
<p>of NATO in the 90s. And the intention was to make NATO as a</p>
<p>Western allied kind of organization contain Russia step</p>
<p>up right to their borders, get very close and, and ultimately</p>
<p>make these kind of, you know, areas, free liberal democracies</p>
<p>that are aligned with the West, and put them right on Russia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>border. And that is obviously antagonistic. If anyone tried to</p>
<p>do that to the United States, like Russia did with the Cuban</p>
<p>missile crisis, we would view that as a hostile act, and we</p>
<p>would react accordingly. And for years, the pressure has been</p>
<p>building and has been mounting, as Putin has started to kind of</p>
<p>solidify his political power at home and his allies abroad, in</p>
<p>trying to figure out ways to push back on this wall that has</p>
<p>been built around him and his nation. And, you know, to some</p>
<p>degree, I think we look at this as like, his aggressive</p>
<p>behavior, but to some extent, it is a defensive behavior over a</p>
<p>very longer cycle when when when viewed that way. And again,</p>
<p>like, remember, the US had this Monroe Doctrine, which President</p>
<p>Monroe put in place in, I don&rsquo;t know, 18, something, 1800</p>
<p>something that said, you know, anyone that comes into our</p>
<p>territory, and tries to influence nations around us to</p>
<p>be hostile towards us is it&rsquo;s a hostile act in and of itself.</p>
<p>Anytime someone tries to influence our politics, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hostile. And I think Russia views our behavior and NATO&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behavior this way. And so his primary demand is and has always</p>
<p>been that the Ukraine cannot and will not and should not join</p>
<p>NATO. And the US response has and continues to be and and the</p>
<p>EU and the EU. And we&rsquo;re saying, look, we we believe in the</p>
<p>sovereignty of the Ukraine. And we want the Ukraine to make</p>
<p>their own decision about where they go and what they do. But</p>
<p>the reality is, for us, this is a key part of a very long term</p>
<p>strategy to keep Russia contained. Now, meanwhile,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this beautiful backdrop of what&rsquo;s going on with China.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m China, I would love to see the US and Russia in</p>
<p>conflict, because it will weaken the US. And if I&rsquo;m Russia, I</p>
<p>would love to see the US and China in conflict, because it</p>
<p>will weaken the US, the US is in a very precarious situation</p>
<p>right now. And for us to actually end up in conflict is</p>
<p>going to weaken our position with one of these other two</p>
<p>emerging, you know, challenging, you know,</p>
<p>superpowers. And this is a really precarious time, I think</p>
<p>to sacks his point, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely we&rsquo;re gonna end up</p>
<p>sending military, but the posturing is such that we need</p>
<p>to kind of hold our line until the very last minute, we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>what happens. I did say, you know, at the end of the year, I</p>
<p>do think that we&rsquo;re in this kind of economic status right now</p>
<p>that if there were an opportunity for conflict, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably more likely to want to engage in conflict than not,</p>
<p>because it does create something that we all get</p>
<p>behind to create, you know, kind of political unity, it</p>
<p>creates economic unity, it creates driving forces, that</p>
<p>maybe might help us through what is clearly a very volatile</p>
<p>and difficult time at home. So let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>
<p>I think Obama&rsquo;s already given us the endgame. I just think we</p>
<p>have to go through the machinations to get there. He</p>
<p>said to the Atlantic, I think it was in 2016, or 17. He said,</p>
<p>the fact is that Ukraine, which is a non NATO country is going</p>
<p>to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia, no matter</p>
<p>what we do. And you know, every time there was this brinksmanship,</p>
<p>we effectively blinked and rightfully so because it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily make sense to, to all of a sudden engage the war</p>
<p>machine to go to war in Eastern Europe. The thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about what happened here, though, was that this was</p>
<p>a slow moving train wreck that was really visible years and</p>
<p>years ago. Why is that? Well, if you look at what was really</p>
<p>happening, this is really a European issue. And you got to</p>
<p>think, well, why is America being the leading actor here</p>
<p>when you know, where&rsquo;s Europe and all of this? Well, it turns</p>
<p>out that, you know, the strongest power in Europe,</p>
<p>Germany, is in a really difficult situation, because</p>
<p>they rely on Russian energy. 50% of the nat gas that comes in,</p>
<p>or 50% of the energy, I think that comes into Germany is from</p>
<p>Russia. And they&rsquo;ve, in fact, been building an entire pipeline</p>
<p>system from Russia that bypasses the Ukraine and goes</p>
<p>straight to Germany. And so when all of this saber rattling was</p>
<p>happening, Germany basically had to blink because they need</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s energy. And why did they need Russia&rsquo;s energy? Well,</p>
<p>they needed Russia&rsquo;s energy, because 20 years ago, the</p>
<p>environmentalists in Germany one, and they started</p>
<p>decommissioned all their nuclear reactors. So ridiculous.</p>
<p>So at somewhere along the way, nobody took a science class in</p>
<p>Germany and figured out that nuclear was both safer and</p>
<p>cleaner. Instead, burning fossil fuels is the answer</p>
<p>wiser to not have a dependency. And after Fukushima, they went</p>
<p>turned them all off, they accelerated it,</p>
<p>it made more sense to burn fossil fuels, number one, and</p>
<p>then to get those fossil fuels from Russia. So unfortunately,</p>
<p>we are in the state of affairs where, you know, Germany has</p>
<p>said, I at least it&rsquo;s been reported that they would shut</p>
<p>down this pipeline Nord Stream two, if if Russia did</p>
<p>something. But the reality is, I think Obama basically told us</p>
<p>that, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be very difficult for us to</p>
<p>justify an act like this, especially against somebody who</p>
<p>is fortified and clever and smart. This is not like</p>
<p>invading the Middle East. And so this is a massive, if this</p>
<p>happens, the, the stock markets will just go absolutely to zero.</p>
<p>I mean, if you could have negative stock prices, this may</p>
<p>be a good catalyst to take these Netflix shares, please.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable. It&rsquo;s really, really crazy.</p>
<p>This is seems like a situation where we&rsquo;re assured not to get</p>
<p>into, to mix it up with him. Like, I, I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>Putin. I don&rsquo;t understand Biden saying that he&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>going to react to this. Because we&rsquo;re not we can&rsquo;t afford to get</p>
<p>into a war right now. And if that is true, then, you know, us</p>
<p>dominance, the US ability to hold the line starts to decline.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if I agree with that. Because I think we</p>
<p>could diffuse this crisis very easily. Yeah, which is the exit</p>
<p>ramp? Yeah, tell us.</p>
<p>Well, the the exit ramp here is what is Putin demanding? Putin</p>
<p>is demanding that we affirm that Ukraine will not be part of</p>
<p>NATO. In my view, that in my view, that&rsquo;s giving him the</p>
<p>sleeves off our vest, because we should not want to add Ukraine</p>
<p>or Georgia to NATO. That would do nothing to enhance the</p>
<p>security of the United States, we wouldn&rsquo;t get anything out of</p>
<p>it. But we would be obligated under Article five of exactly to</p>
<p>defend them. So admitting Ukraine or Georgia or Moldova</p>
<p>could ultimately bring us into a war with Russia, too. Exactly.</p>
<p>So to free to freebirds point earlier, we have been poking the</p>
<p>bear for two decades with our expansion of NATO, right up to</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s front porch. And if you go all the way back to 1990,</p>
<p>when George Herbert Walker Bush was president and James Baker</p>
<p>was Secretary of State, there was an assurance made by James</p>
<p>Baker that that, you know, basically, they had gone to</p>
<p>Gorbachev and said, we want to, you know, we for help in</p>
<p>reunifying Germany. And the promise made that famously that</p>
<p>James Baker said is that what Gorbachev said is we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>NATO expansion. And Baker apparently said not one inch</p>
<p>eastward was the line. And, and we think back to how well</p>
<p>Herbert Walker Bush and James Baker managed the end of the</p>
<p>Cold War. How do they do that? They, they did that by making</p>
<p>assurances to Russia that we would not bring NATO up to the</p>
<p>front porch as well, which is what we did in 2000. We&rsquo;ve now</p>
<p>added something like 14 countries in Eastern Europe to,</p>
<p>you know, to NATO, including in 2004, the the Baltic countries,</p>
<p>and that decision by George W. Bush really is the thing that</p>
<p>pretty much severed our relationship with Putin. You</p>
<p>have to remember that Putin is, he is fairly popular in Russia</p>
<p>because he stokes Russian nationalism. And what is the</p>
<p>source of that nationalism? It is because a single tree</p>
<p>organization, NATO now has this huge contiguous border with</p>
<p>Russia, they now feel encircled. And if we were to add Ukraine to</p>
<p>that organization, there&rsquo;d be a 1200 mile, again, border, which</p>
<p>that Russia would have with with just this one, this one</p>
<p>alliance, it would be akin to imagine if we were still in the</p>
<p>Cold War, and Canada were added to the Warsaw Pact, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we would be incredibly threatened by that. So and so</p>
<p>but but you know, you never hear it, Jake, you never hear any of</p>
<p>this on the news. All you hear is the beating of the war drums.</p>
<p>And Putin is portrayed as this mad dictator. He has no</p>
<p>legitimate concerns. Now look, Putin is an authoritarian, and</p>
<p>you could describe him as a bully and a thug. And he has</p>
<p>provoked a dictator. He has provoked this situation.</p>
<p>Certainly. Okay. But, you know, we treat him as if he has no</p>
<p>valid concerns whatsoever. And I think the simplest thing to do</p>
<p>to defuse this crisis would simply be to say, yes, we have</p>
<p>no intention of adding Ukraine to NATO. And then we will find</p>
<p>out if Putin is a liar or not.</p>
<p>Well, that would be a great move. Like it&rsquo;s a that would be</p>
<p>like, hey, let&rsquo;s take a five year pause. Okay, you know what,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll negotiate with you. We&rsquo;ll take five years, we won&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>him in NATO, give give a little bit of a concession, because</p>
<p>their country is not doing well, their GDP trails, China and the</p>
<p>United States, their GDP per, you know, each citizen is</p>
<p>incredibly low compared to the West, like, and then we could</p>
<p>just work with Germany to get on sustainables, which is what</p>
<p>their goal is. And we could economically continue to trounce</p>
<p>them. Because as you point out, every week, Chamath, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>an important economy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Obama said about Putin. Obama said, The truth is</p>
<p>actually Putin in all of our meetings is scrupulously polite,</p>
<p>very frank, our meetings are very businesslike. He never</p>
<p>keeps me waiting two hours like he does a bunch of these other</p>
<p>folks. He&rsquo;s constantly interested in being seen as our</p>
<p>peer. And as working with us, because he&rsquo;s not completely</p>
<p>stupid. He understands that Russia&rsquo;s overall position in the</p>
<p>world is significantly diminished. Yeah, he&rsquo;s not crazy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not dumb. And by the way, nationalism, as Saks points out,</p>
<p>which is a primary, you know, drum call for for Putin, is not</p>
<p>a novel sense. We we are a nationalist country. nationalism</p>
<p>is, you know, pride and wanting to make sure that your country</p>
<p>is treated with treated with respect and has sovereignty. And</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think that Putin is an irrational actor, his</p>
<p>behavior is very rational in response to what&rsquo;s gone on for</p>
<p>30 years. And his requests are that he is feeling threatened,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to avoid military conflict as much as he</p>
<p>can. And we portray him as being an aggressor that&rsquo;s demanding</p>
<p>military conflict. And at the end of the day, our behavior</p>
<p>over a long period of time as a country has driven us to the</p>
<p>brink here. And I think Saks is right, you know, the right</p>
<p>decision may very well be to kind of, you know, leave the</p>
<p>region alone and focus on issues that matter more deeply to us</p>
<p>and are a higher priority rather than drawing us into this,</p>
<p>but a better investment would be in sustainable energy. I think</p>
<p>the economic seed is planted for us to be in some sort of</p>
<p>conflict this year. So, you know, we&rsquo;re gonna end up by that</p>
<p>freeberg economic seed to be in some sort of conflict. I think</p>
<p>that, you know, generally, if you&rsquo;re not going to see</p>
<p>homegrown, you know, economic productivity gains, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>suffering trade issues, like we&rsquo;re going to suffer this year,</p>
<p>given the supply chain problems globally, we&rsquo;re going to look</p>
<p>for some place to manufacture growth. And there&rsquo;s no better</p>
<p>way to manufacture growth and through the dog through</p>
<p>conflict, the foreign policy establishment in Washington,</p>
<p>you know, the neocons, the you know, the so called Washington</p>
<p>blob, I mean, here they are being the drums for war, we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been in a war for what, six months, we just got out of</p>
<p>Afghanistan. And now they want us back in another war. And the</p>
<p>media just keeps no one ruling and fomenting this. And they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, you know, their coverage of it is, well, it&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what we talked about last week, Jake out when I pointed out that</p>
<p>your, your rhetoric, your humanitarian rhetoric, as noble</p>
<p>as the sentiments are, when it gets whipped up into a lather</p>
<p>and a frenzy by the media, it blunders us into a bunch of</p>
<p>stupid foreign intervention,</p>
<p>I would not call it rhetorical, but let&rsquo;s call it beliefs. My</p>
<p>beliefs are not rhetoric, but I get your point. Is there one</p>
<p>week later, and exactly what I said, the risk of this is has</p>
<p>now materialized. Clearly, you&rsquo;re blaming my position on</p>
<p>human rights.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that this type of rhetoric is used by the</p>
<p>military industrial complex and the washer blob and the neocons</p>
<p>to stampede us into wars that don&rsquo;t make any sense. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I predicted a week ago. That&rsquo;s or that was my concern.</p>
<p>Death that would occur later, and we&rsquo;re in exactly that</p>
<p>situation. It is our most successful export. It is our</p>
<p>most successful export.</p>
<p>Jekyll really important. There&rsquo;s a difference between</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference between belief. And how do you act on</p>
<p>that belief? And what are your actions based on belief? Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think that a big part of what&rsquo;s gone on and this harkens</p>
<p>back to a few episodes ago when we all got in trouble. There</p>
<p>was an attempt to canceling us after we spoke about this. But</p>
<p>but when those beliefs are, we got sacks pointed out harnessed</p>
<p>in a way that is ultimately co opted in a way to fuel and to</p>
<p>drive. You know, conflict, it, it obviously goes beyond belief,</p>
<p>and it starts to move into an area where there is a very wide</p>
<p>spectrum of action. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s very easy to tip yourself</p>
<p>onto the one side of the spectrum. And as a result,</p>
<p>caused a lot of harm and a lot of damage like we&rsquo;ve done in</p>
<p>Afghanistan, like we&rsquo;ve done in Iraq.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a great lens. What is the cost of going to war in the</p>
<p>Ukraine versus whatever human rights or sovereignty issues</p>
<p>they have hundreds of 1000s of troops going to war is going to</p>
<p>result in more human suffering than what&rsquo;s currently happening</p>
<p>for Ukraine. It&rsquo;s sort of exactly they&rsquo;re going to they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be in the middle of the war is going to happen on</p>
<p>their turf, the humanitarian interest is in diffusing this</p>
<p>situation. The way the way to do it in a way is to is to, you</p>
<p>know, exceed to this one demand that yes, Putin has about not</p>
<p>admitting Ukraine to NATO, which just to say something more</p>
<p>about why we shouldn&rsquo;t want that the problem in Ukraine and</p>
<p>Georgia and Moldova, first of all, these are not North</p>
<p>Atlantic countries, right? This is mission creep by NATO,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in the caucuses. And the problem they have is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sort of these breakaway, you know, Russian republics, but</p>
<p>inside of these countries, there&rsquo;s breakaway provinces, you</p>
<p>know, they&rsquo;re ethnically Russian areas within these</p>
<p>countries that want to break away from them. So you have a</p>
<p>breakaway within the breakaway. And so you&rsquo;ve got these</p>
<p>powerful forces complicated, it&rsquo;s very complicated. So for</p>
<p>example, in Georgia in 2008, when there was a war there, and</p>
<p>Russia did invade Georgia, but it was on behalf of these</p>
<p>breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. And then</p>
<p>in in Ukraine, they&rsquo;ve got the Donbass and Crimea, and it was</p>
<p>now been annexed by Russia, which are these majority</p>
<p>Russian areas. You know, and same problem in Moldova. So the</p>
<p>problem is, you&rsquo;ve got these like incredibly complicated</p>
<p>border disputes within these countries, based on ethno</p>
<p>nationalist tribalism. And, you know, familiar, right? The US</p>
<p>does not have a vital national interest in getting involved in</p>
<p>those disputes. And by admitting these countries into NATO, they</p>
<p>could pull us into those disputes, because the key</p>
<p>provision Article Five of NATO says an attack on one is an</p>
<p>attack on all we&rsquo;re obligated to go to the defense of those</p>
<p>nations. How is the security of the United States enhanced by</p>
<p>that requirement, they get a lot out of it, we don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>anything out of it.</p>
<p>This is a distinctly different than say, Taiwan is an issue.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s put that aside. And we&rsquo;ll get to that in a second.</p>
<p>If China and Russia and the United States are in this very</p>
<p>complicated chessboard, is there a way not only to diffuse</p>
<p>this situation, but is there a way and I know this sounds like</p>
<p>a crazy Hail Mary to deepen the relationship with Putin and make</p>
<p>Russia and the United States in some way allies against this</p>
<p>relationship with China, because the Russia China relationship</p>
<p>is also very complex. Is there some path to us having a better</p>
<p>relationship?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s holding a summit. The last person he saw in real life</p>
<p>was the leader of Pakistan in 2020. Before the pandemic</p>
<p>started, you know who he&rsquo;s meeting with in two weeks before</p>
<p>the Olympics start or in a week, it&rsquo;s put Yeah, in person. And</p>
<p>then the there&rsquo;s going to be a tripartite alliance conference</p>
<p>between China, Russia and Iran. Great. So I think this idea that</p>
<p>that all of a sudden, somebody is going to found some holier</p>
<p>than thou perspective on what the right thing to do is for</p>
<p>other people is going to be challenged. So those guys are</p>
<p>going to think about themselves. And they&rsquo;re creating alliances</p>
<p>to basically further advance their own objectives. And so I</p>
<p>think we have to as well. The thing here, I think what</p>
<p>deescalates all of this is economic sanctions and monetary</p>
<p>impact. Because if Nord Stream two doesn&rsquo;t get turned on, which</p>
<p>is in Germany&rsquo;s control, that has a huge economic impact to</p>
<p>Russia explain what it is. Nord Stream two is that pipeline</p>
<p>that I just talked about the nat gas pipeline that that</p>
<p>basically doubles the amount of nat gas flowing from Russia into</p>
<p>Germany and essentially into all of Europe. But hasn&rsquo;t Germany</p>
<p>said if they invade the Ukraine, they haven&rsquo;t said it, they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t said it on the record, they it is it is thought that</p>
<p>Chancellor Schultz that that it&rsquo;s theoretically on the table,</p>
<p>but it hasn&rsquo;t been officially declared. Biden today said that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talked or somebody in the White House has talked to all</p>
<p>the major banks in the US about crippling economic sanctions. So</p>
<p>I do think the way this gets deescalated is through money.</p>
<p>And if you, you know, if you severely impinge Russia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to sort of grow their economy, that foments a lot of,</p>
<p>you know, anger at home. And I don&rsquo;t think that, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll probably weaken and destabilize Putin more than, you</p>
<p>know, trying to sort of have a, I don&rsquo;t know, some kind of,</p>
<p>like, get together and hug it out session with him.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so Jason, you raise a good point with, you</p>
<p>know, can we improve our relationship with Putin, Obama</p>
<p>tried, right, we had the whole reset. And ultimately, it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t tremendously successful. But I think a lot of it has to</p>
<p>do with the way that the foreign policy established from</p>
<p>Washington sort of reacts. And Obama had some really good</p>
<p>quotes about this. I think it was in that Atlantic article</p>
<p>where, you know, first, he&rsquo;s described that, you know, that</p>
<p>Russia has a vital interest in Ukraine in a way we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s right there, it&rsquo;s on their border, they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>attacked, Russia has through the Ukraine, you know, throughout</p>
<p>history. So again, it&rsquo;s just a primary interest of theirs. And</p>
<p>so after saying that, Obama, then, you know, he basically</p>
<p>got attacked, you know, by, you know, in a, but it was some of</p>
<p>it was partisan, but, and then he responded to the attacks by</p>
<p>saying, if there&rsquo;s someone in this town, Washington, DC, that</p>
<p>would claim that we would consider going to war with</p>
<p>Russia over Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, they should speak up</p>
<p>and be very clear about it, that he challenged. And then he</p>
<p>said, so the issue, and no one did, right? No one was willing</p>
<p>to just come right out and say that we should go to war over</p>
<p>this. And that&rsquo;s how he diffused the attacks on himself.</p>
<p>And then Obama continued, he said, there&rsquo;s a playbook in</p>
<p>Washington, that presidents are supposed to follow. And the</p>
<p>playbook prescribes responses to different events. And these</p>
<p>responses tend to be militarized responses, you&rsquo;re judged</p>
<p>harshly, if you don&rsquo;t follow the playbook, even if there are good</p>
<p>reasons. So what Obama is saying is that no one would defend a</p>
<p>more militarized posture and going to war against Russia over</p>
<p>the Crimea. And yet, he was somehow portrayed as suspect,</p>
<p>you know, by not being tough enough on Russia. And so, you</p>
<p>know, if you&rsquo;re Putin, and you see constantly the foreign</p>
<p>policy establishment, you know, reacting in this way, it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>problem that even one president can just fix overnight,</p>
<p>you know, what would change this is if when we send 100,000</p>
<p>troops over there, it&rsquo;s a draft. And, you know, it&rsquo;s not an all</p>
<p>paid military, the fact that these people in Washington who</p>
<p>got their kids in Georgetown, or Harvard, or wherever they are,</p>
<p>Stanford, don&rsquo;t have to send their kids over there to fight</p>
<p>this war is one of the reasons they can write these documents</p>
<p>and have these doctrines that hey, you got to send all these</p>
<p>troops into harm way harm&rsquo;s way like if they had to send their</p>
<p>sons and daughters, it would be a much different discussion of</p>
<p>like where we&rsquo;re going to start a war, whether it&rsquo;s Afghanistan</p>
<p>or the Ukraine.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go to markets. Bill Ackman came over the top, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>buying a ton of Netflix, and Tesla just absolutely flipped</p>
<p>to becoming a money printing machine and had a ridiculous</p>
<p>quarter revenues up 53 to 53 billion up 71% year over year,</p>
<p>q4 revenue 17,000,065% year over year. And they increased</p>
<p>their deliveries by 71%. And now you&rsquo;re all of a sudden to</p>
<p>start see some, you know, income coming into the company.</p>
<p>So flipping from money losing to break even to now printing a</p>
<p>ton of money. Microsoft had an absurd quarter, their revenue</p>
<p>hit 51.7 billion up 20% in the quarter 20% year over year pays</p>
<p>for $200 billion in revenue in 2022. And their net income was</p>
<p>also up 20 plus percent at 18.8 billion. So the money printing</p>
<p>machine in these companies is just extraordinary. Chamath,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you forgot a couple of key things,</p>
<p>which is that the FOMC meeting happened this week. And Powell</p>
<p>basically said, Look, we&rsquo;re going to start tightening in</p>
<p>March. I think the way that he said it, you know, all of these</p>
<p>words tend to be so scrutinized and overanalyzed. But the</p>
<p>instead of figuring out what people thought, I think their</p>
<p>actions post the FOMC are important, which is that, you</p>
<p>know, we effectively now started to price in about five rate</p>
<p>hikes this year. So probably 525 point rate hikes,</p>
<p>effectively, that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what the that&rsquo;s what the yield</p>
<p>curve tells us. If you take a big step back, I just want to</p>
<p>remind people like, it&rsquo;s really hard to live through volatility,</p>
<p>right? And we&rsquo;re in the phase of it now. But typically, these</p>
<p>big drawdowns are like, you know, when stocks go down, it</p>
<p>actually precedes so it comes before the actual starting of a</p>
<p>rate hike cycle. And so if you go back to the, you know, from</p>
<p>1950, onwards today, every time the government has started to</p>
<p>raise rates, or the Federal Reserve has started to raise</p>
<p>rates, the stock markets have actually rallied. Now, why is</p>
<p>that? It&rsquo;s typically that they see through the end of the rate</p>
<p>hike cycle. And they start to price the business as if these</p>
<p>rate hikes are done and to rebase things. And on average, I</p>
<p>think the stock markets go up between seven and 8%. So call</p>
<p>it seven and a half, eight and a half percent. And so what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting to me is now, we&rsquo;re finally starting the process of</p>
<p>these hikes. And the real question is going to be how data</p>
<p>dependent do these guys get? And what I mean by that is, so</p>
<p>you know, we talked about this before, but, you know, China cut</p>
<p>rates, this past weekend, actually, Germany decreased</p>
<p>their GDP forecast. And so you&rsquo;re starting to see two huge</p>
<p>countries already say, Hey, wait a minute, we need to be, you</p>
<p>know, we need to be more realistic about what long term</p>
<p>growth looks like here. It&rsquo;s inconceivable, in my mind that</p>
<p>those countries are slowing down, and we won&rsquo;t. And so I</p>
<p>think what happens in these other huge GDP drivers of world</p>
<p>GDP will affect us. And so, you know, Saxon, I have said this</p>
<p>before, but the marginal risk will be that we overcorrect and</p>
<p>actually create a recession that doesn&rsquo;t need to be one. So we</p>
<p>slam on the brakes too hard. And another way of saying it is,</p>
<p>the rate hikes are the market is a leading indicator of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen post the rate hikes,</p>
<p>we had a nice relief rally going until I think some of the words</p>
<p>that Paul used was that there was plenty of room for</p>
<p>meaning that because unemployment&rsquo;s at three and a</p>
<p>half percent, that, you know, we&rsquo;re at full employment. And</p>
<p>that means that the Fed can, you know, has this dual mission</p>
<p>of keeping inflation low and, you know, keeping employment</p>
<p>high. So if employment is high, then they&rsquo;ve got more room to</p>
<p>raise rate. Anyway, it was that language around the plenty of</p>
<p>room that freaked markets out, and they triggered a huge</p>
<p>selloff. I think to Jamal&rsquo;s point, I don&rsquo;t see how you can</p>
<p>have this much wealth destroyed so quickly and have it not</p>
<p>impact the real economy. There&rsquo;s a lot of people out there who</p>
<p>feel a lot poorer, because their portfolios have gotten slashed</p>
<p>in value. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all tightening, they&rsquo;ll clench not spend as much money</p>
<p>on a vacation, not buy a TV or a car. So these waitlists for</p>
<p>cars might get, you know, become sales,</p>
<p>the luxury markets of the economy, the optional purchases</p>
<p>start to really slow down. And so I think that the risk of</p>
<p>recession now is much higher than it was even a month ago.</p>
<p>Now, you know, it&rsquo;s gonna be hard to know. So basically, I</p>
<p>think what we&rsquo;re saying is, it&rsquo;s gonna be very hard for the Fed</p>
<p>to engineer a soft landing here, where we don&rsquo;t trigger a</p>
<p>recession in the process of stopping inflation. And look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll judge Powell&rsquo;s performance. You know, at the</p>
<p>end of this, you know, we&rsquo;re not going to know, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but I but I think that he&rsquo;s turned out to be much more</p>
<p>hawkish in his statements than markets were expecting.</p>
<p>Again, and in 2018, you know, he was probably overly hawkish,</p>
<p>and he actually created effectively, a little mini</p>
<p>recession, we we didn&rsquo;t pay attention enough to it, because</p>
<p>you know, Trump made it impossible to see the signal</p>
<p>from the noise. But it did happen. And it was Powell being</p>
<p>a little too trigger happy. And so, you know, we have to</p>
<p>remember that, you know, the Fed has $9 trillion of assets on</p>
<p>their balance sheet. And so, you know, if they start to take</p>
<p>$9 trillion of cash out of the system, by selling these assets</p>
<p>into the market, right, you&rsquo;re taking the money out, right,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting money back, that&rsquo;s going to have an</p>
<p>enormous, huge impact as well. So if you think about question</p>
<p>about what happens, one second, one second, let me finish,</p>
<p>please. So, you know, so when you have these two things</p>
<p>happening at the same time, you have a potential rate hike</p>
<p>cycle, which makes the cost of a used car more expensive, the</p>
<p>cost of your credit card balance is more expensive. The</p>
<p>obligations you have to pay just become naturally more expensive,</p>
<p>you feel poorer, so you spend less. And then separately in the</p>
<p>financial markets, you actually take liquidity out of the</p>
<p>system. And so people value, you know, liquidity more, it</p>
<p>becomes, it becomes worth more, you, you value current cash</p>
<p>more. I mean, we&rsquo;re putting ourselves in a really delicate</p>
<p>position. So he&rsquo;s got a delicate balancing act here, he is</p>
<p>definitely on a tightrope. So if we pull 9 trillion out, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been talking about this deficit, if he starts selling all of</p>
<p>those assets, does that mean on the United States balance sheet</p>
<p>that will reduce our national debt? No money, we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>9 trillion of cash, right? You sell an asset, you get cash for</p>
<p>it, right. And so it pulls money out of the economy in the same</p>
<p>way. Yeah, it created liquidity when they were buying assets,</p>
<p>right? When they&rsquo;re buying this debt, it would put money, push</p>
<p>money out. If they&rsquo;re selling the debt, it pulls money back</p>
<p>in. What happens to those dollars is my point, like, what</p>
<p>is the impact of the dollar sitting around in the United</p>
<p>Bank, the dollar, the dollar stays in the US USA&rsquo;s bank</p>
<p>account, but the obligation the note exists in some financial</p>
<p>intermediary that holds it. Clearly, Powell does not want to</p>
<p>be remembered as the Fed chief that let inflation slip the</p>
<p>leash, right? I mean, he, he&rsquo;s gotten religion now around the</p>
<p>idea that this inflation is not transitory, which was his</p>
<p>position for months. I think that now bit him. And the risk</p>
<p>is potentially an overcorrection, but he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to let inflation</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll then he&rsquo;ll be the first Fed governor to have caused two</p>
<p>recessions.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like a serious risk. And by the way, these</p>
<p>market levels that we&rsquo;re at right now, I mean, look, 60%</p>
<p>correction and growth stocks. Okay. But this is with that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in a good economy in peacetime conditions. And now</p>
<p>we have a risk of recession and war. So, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still room for, you know, a lot more negative news here is kind</p>
<p>of my point. And, but look, sentiments also very negative.</p>
<p>So when sentiment is this negative, there&rsquo;s also the</p>
<p>potential for markets to quickly recover.</p>
<p>But the sentiment is there for the wrong reasons. I think I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think people are thinking recession, I think people are</p>
<p>thinking, my gosh, these rate increases, my gosh, I can&rsquo;t own</p>
<p>these high growth stocks anymore. And none of those</p>
<p>things are true. Those are just perceptions that get amplified</p>
<p>by one&rsquo;s emotions when you&rsquo;re getting punched in the face,</p>
<p>which is what happens when you wake up every day in your</p>
<p>portfolio, by the way, five or 6%.</p>
<p>It generates incredible opportunity.</p>
<p>The, you know, the idea that markets bucket, quote, unquote,</p>
<p>growth stocks together, I think, kind of obfuscates an</p>
<p>important point, which is that some of the businesses in that</p>
<p>category are real businesses that are going to succeed over</p>
<p>the long run. And some of them are speculative and are likely</p>
<p>to fail over the short run. And, you know, as you saw Netflix</p>
<p>sell off, Bill Ackman, very smart came in and bought a bunch</p>
<p>of the stock. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember this, but in</p>
<p>2011, TCV, which is traditionally a private equity</p>
<p>investor at the time, and there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of crossover and</p>
<p>public market stuff happening.</p>
<p>J-Hope?</p>
<p>They were a private investor in Netflix. Netflix stock tanked</p>
<p>from I think it was around $220 a share down to 70 bucks a share</p>
<p>in a couple of months. And TCV did a $200 million pipe into</p>
<p>Netflix. And everyone&rsquo;s like, oh my god, what are they doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible. And by the way, that was on an adjusted</p>
<p>basis. That&rsquo;s $10 a share in today&rsquo;s share price. So that</p>
<p>$200 million investment that they made went up 60x, you know,</p>
<p>at the peak of Netflix a few weeks ago. And so, you know,</p>
<p>seeing Bill Ackman come in and underwrite Netflix again, and</p>
<p>make a big investment at its current market price.</p>
<p>So J-Hope?</p>
<p>I think it really highlights that they&rsquo;re just because the</p>
<p>market price is down doesn&rsquo;t mean that a business isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fundamentally valuable and going to grow and going to</p>
<p>generate significant returns over time as a as an operating</p>
<p>business. And that distinction starts to present significant</p>
<p>opportunities in a market condition like this. And the</p>
<p>businesses we all talk about generally growth stocks are down</p>
<p>60%. But maybe most of them shouldn&rsquo;t have even been public</p>
<p>companies in the first place. Maybe they should have been</p>
<p>speculative, private investments, where more than</p>
<p>two thirds of them were likely to fail, and they shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>failing as public companies. And the few that are getting</p>
<p>damaged and hit with this market sentiment shift can be</p>
<p>picked up cheap. And there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity. And so I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t view the market condition to be necessarily</p>
<p>reflective, again, of the economy, or the condition of</p>
<p>businesses in general.</p>
<p>J-Hope was a partner at TCV. He&rsquo;s a founder of TCV that did</p>
<p>that deal. And he&rsquo;s also the one that participated and led the</p>
<p>billion dollar round into Peloton before they whiffed</p>
<p>earnings and got and got decapitated. But he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible investor. That trade is probably one of the best</p>
<p>trades of all time.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look in the good news column. wages way up, earnings</p>
<p>way up. 10 million job openings in the United States, pretty</p>
<p>close to record low unemployment, and the pandemic</p>
<p>ending ending and people having record savings in their bank</p>
<p>accounts and personal balance sheets. So how does all that</p>
<p>good news the pandemic hasn&rsquo;t ended?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ending for people. I think it&rsquo;s over for people like I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you the thing I&rsquo;m most concerned about there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>reverberation that persists in supply chains. I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>much hardware lab biotech consumer goods businesses you</p>
<p>guys are involved in. I&rsquo;m involved in a number of them.</p>
<p>Every single one of them are crippled in some way right now</p>
<p>by supply chain issues. I mean, I&rsquo;m talking about like,</p>
<p>businesses that have been operating at steady state for</p>
<p>many, many years.</p>
<p>When do those get worked out?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know. And everyone&rsquo;s getting surprised and hit</p>
<p>upside the head every week with some new supply chain shortage,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s some chemical you need for some lab equipment,</p>
<p>or, you know, the delivery of some big piece of equipment,</p>
<p>or even plastic bottles that we use to kind of fill up our</p>
<p>beverages that we ship. That&rsquo;s a pretty sizable business.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had supply chain disruption like we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>right now. I&rsquo;d like to bleep out the name of that company.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a bleep this out. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a significantly sized business that has never had supply chain</p>
<p>issues. It&rsquo;s all us based, but some of the suppliers of the</p>
<p>suppliers have had complete failure and delivery. And all</p>
<p>of a sudden, it&rsquo;s now reverberating through the supply</p>
<p>chain. You guys saw that GM didn&rsquo;t deliver a single friggin</p>
<p>electric vehicle last quarter, because they couldn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>get the chips that they needed to make cars. So the real risk</p>
<p>to the economy, in my opinion, right now, is when and how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to work our way through the supply chain issues. And it</p>
<p>is so complex. And there&rsquo;s a myriad of problems. And it is a</p>
<p>global problem, that it&rsquo;s really unclear how this is going to</p>
<p>play out over the next six months. And what will happen is</p>
<p>this quarter, next quarter, businesses that you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize and didn&rsquo;t expect are going to get hit with supply</p>
<p>chain problems are suddenly going to say, guess what, our</p>
<p>revenues off by 2030%. Because we couldn&rsquo;t sell this product</p>
<p>because and half our shelves are empty, because product didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>show up or whatever the narrative might be. All right,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a real problem.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really, I think it&rsquo;s a great point, because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t solve these supply chain issues with rate hikes. Right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nothing to do with that. Nothing to do with it. So</p>
<p>the rate hike slow the economy. I&rsquo;m way more worried about this</p>
<p>than rate hikes. Right? What does clean it up is capitalism,</p>
<p>the end of the pandemic time, unless we&rsquo;re Asian. And the</p>
<p>reason I&rsquo;m less worried is when you actually talk to the</p>
<p>companies that that are spending enormous amounts of money on</p>
<p>CapEx, they&rsquo;ve actually guided to the fact that by the end of</p>
<p>this year, in the beginning of next year, most of these things</p>
<p>will be worked out. It&rsquo;s indigestible. I think I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re, I think we&rsquo;re dealing with a, you know, six to nine</p>
<p>month issue of having turned things off. And now we&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>rapidly trying to turn things back on. And we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily get that timing, right. But I do think it&rsquo;ll work</p>
<p>itself out faster than people expect. Personally, that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I think, because the cost of Apple and Tesla specifically</p>
<p>guiding to that is too enormous, you&rsquo;re talking about, you know,</p>
<p>collectively, almost 4 trillion of market cap, so they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get something like this wrong. And they were pretty</p>
<p>clear in the last few days that that this will be done by 2023,</p>
<p>early 2022.</p>
<p>Saks or Chamath, I just listed all the good news to counter,</p>
<p>you know, the the slog and the and the bad news. How do you</p>
<p>account for record low unemployment, record number of</p>
<p>jobs, record wages going up, massive cash on people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>personal balance sheet, massive amounts of sideline cash,</p>
<p>massive amounts of venture funds being raised that have to be</p>
<p>deployed in the next five years. All that good news, where does</p>
<p>that on this balance sheet of good versus bad, you know, work</p>
<p>out for you, Saks?</p>
<p>Well, the the negatives are that yes, the unemployment rate is</p>
<p>very low, but a lot of people have dropped out of the labor</p>
<p>force. So the labor participation rate is still</p>
<p>quite low. So</p>
<p>Because of?</p>
<p>Well, because I think a lot of people dropped out because of</p>
<p>COVID, you know, everyone went remote. And I think, you know,</p>
<p>they got these STEMI checks. And I think a lot of people got used</p>
<p>to not working. You know, maybe maybe you had a household with</p>
<p>two people used to work. And now only one of them is working,</p>
<p>you know, maybe they moved to a cheaper part of the country.</p>
<p>So I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing, right? But a lot of</p>
<p>people dropped out of the labor force, and they haven&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>back. And so that&rsquo;s the negative. And then, you know,</p>
<p>the fact that wages are going up is good, but we don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>much that&rsquo;s inflation, right? So, you know, those would be the</p>
<p>negatives. But there was a report that inventory levels did</p>
<p>rise in Q4. And so the supply chain issues do seem to be</p>
<p>ameliorating.</p>
<p>anecdotally, I was looking at cars. And now a lot of the</p>
<p>people who had, you know, there&rsquo;s no way to get this car.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re like, hey, we got a couple of these cars available</p>
<p>if you want them. And then if you look at the housing</p>
<p>inventory, it does seem that maybe that&rsquo;s taking a plus two</p>
<p>and people couldn&rsquo;t find houses. And now maybe, even though</p>
<p>still a housing crisis, maybe there&rsquo;s more available, or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re staying on the market a little bit longer.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear that economic</p>
<p>activity is slowing. And again, things like rate increases,</p>
<p>they, it increases the cost of a mortgage, right? So that could</p>
<p>affect house prices.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an interesting startup story. There&rsquo;s a private</p>
<p>company that&rsquo;s doing essentially life extension that a bunch of</p>
<p>rich people put $3 billion into you want to tell us Friedberg</p>
<p>and your science segment, what is this going to make us live</p>
<p>longer or not?</p>
<p>Well, I think I mentioned this company a few episodes ago.</p>
<p>But I think they just announced their $3 billion investment.</p>
<p>And again, this goes back to the point I made on the prediction</p>
<p>show. So last week, Altos Labs announced that they&rsquo;ve landed</p>
<p>$3 billion in funding. And this has been an ongoing funding</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been going on for quite a while into this business.</p>
<p>But this business was set up to commercialize Yamanaka factor</p>
<p>based cellular reprogramming for age reversal. And there was a</p>
<p>paper published just yesterday. I&rsquo;ll put a link in the show</p>
<p>notes that if people are interested in reading a</p>
<p>scientific paper, they can take a look incredible results.</p>
<p>Scientists took mice gave those mice short bursts of these</p>
<p>Yamanaka factors, and then measured all the biomarkers all</p>
<p>of the chemical signatures in the blood of those mice to</p>
<p>determine their age, because there are known ways that we can</p>
<p>measure the age of an organism by looking in their blood at</p>
<p>measuring certain biomarkers. And with just a few short bursts</p>
<p>for about a week of these drugs, these, these Yamanaka factors,</p>
<p>the mice all of their age signals reversed to making it</p>
<p>look like they were very young again. And it did not do what</p>
<p>the challenge has been with Yamanaka factors in the past is</p>
<p>if you put too much of it in in a body in an organism, the cells</p>
<p>rejuvenate to becoming stem cells, which is kind of like</p>
<p>what a fetus might have, and starts to grow a lot of tumors,</p>
<p>they were able to avoid having tumors show up in the mice. And</p>
<p>the mice, in fact, all looked extremely young from a</p>
<p>biomarker basis. So an incredible result and incredible</p>
<p>paper, whether or not it gets repeated and shown by others.</p>
<p>But I think this speaks to the quality of the science that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>underlying the $3 billion investment that was just made in</p>
<p>Altos labs, which is probably one of the biggest seed</p>
<p>investments ever.</p>
<p>No, it clearly is the biggest seed investment ever in a</p>
<p>startup.</p>
<p>I think it speaks to what I highlighted as what I what will</p>
<p>be the new frontier in biotech, and we&rsquo;ll completely rewrite</p>
<p>like, you know, the course of humanity is if we can take drugs</p>
<p>and for a short period of time, completely reverse the age of</p>
<p>ourselves. And it sounds so crazy and so wacky. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being now proven in a single week, we&rsquo;ve now had an amazing</p>
<p>paper published. And we&rsquo;ve seen the startup announced their $3</p>
<p>billion of funding to pursue commercialization of this</p>
<p>technology. And this is going to be the year I think this will</p>
<p>be the front cover of a lot of magazines this year, as people</p>
<p>realize that this is real, and that it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>commercialized.</p>
<p>Why do you think they have to start with $3 billion? And I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you why I asked the question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whenever I see these grandiose prognostications of future</p>
<p>progress, and then see these companies raise exorbitant</p>
<p>amounts of money, I have never found a single example where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ever worked. Ever. In fact, every time I see a company</p>
<p>raise an exorbitant amount of money in a Series A, I write</p>
<p>them off in my head.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. Yeah.</p>
<p>So why? Why should I not in this case? So, or it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>actually, actually better question, why would somebody</p>
<p>listening to this pod go work there? And by the way, I, by</p>
<p>the way, the same has been done and can be said about Calico,</p>
<p>which is alphabet subsidiary, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s pursuing similar</p>
<p>research, where billions of dollars have gone into that</p>
<p>business. And there&rsquo;s a similar sort of research track underway.</p>
<p>And I think the general principle Chamath is they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what the product is, they don&rsquo;t know the way to market,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know, you know, what area they need to explore.</p>
<p>But the underlying principle is proven. The underlying</p>
<p>principle is something that people believe in. This science</p>
<p>is proven, this science is real, we don&rsquo;t know the commercial</p>
<p>path. And we have to try lots of different things and run lots</p>
<p>of different research programs in parallel to figure it out.</p>
<p>And each of those research programs is like $100 million</p>
<p>biotech startup. And so I think that the principle is, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>put a lot of shots on goal all at once in parallel and make</p>
<p>sure because if any of these shots on goal work, this is</p>
<p>going to be worth many, many billions of dollars. So I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generally the idea. It&rsquo;s almost like having a $3 billion</p>
<p>venture fund. But the venture fund is targeted at one core</p>
<p>area of interest that we believe is real. And I think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>way a lot of these things are being set up. But I&rsquo;m asking</p>
<p>this question. Have you ever seen a company try to do 30</p>
<p>different things and it works? No, no.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s not the typical capital allocation</p>
<p>milestone based funding scheme. I have a very</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a product market fit thing, right? It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>research program. And it&rsquo;s a series of research programs. But</p>
<p>I mean, look, let me reframe it for each month. Have you ever</p>
<p>seen a $3 billion venture fund that makes 100 bets with smart</p>
<p>people at the helm with smart people working at the individual</p>
<p>businesses fail, right? Like,</p>
<p>yes. And in fact, I&rsquo;ve never seen a $3 billion venture fund</p>
<p>do much more than return to X of money.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, look, let&rsquo;s see. I mean, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a big bet.</p>
<p>And obviously, there&rsquo;s some people making nice management</p>
<p>fees and nice carry on this thing. I&rsquo;m not trying to be a</p>
<p>wet blanket. I&rsquo;m just curious. You know, why do it that way?</p>
<p>Meaning, you know, every startup, let&rsquo;s get Bob Nelson on</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll talk about it. He&rsquo;ll set it up. Yeah, every startup, I</p>
<p>think, is forced in some ways by the market to make an educated</p>
<p>guess about where product market fit lies and to try to build</p>
<p>some minimum viable product that that tends to be how value is</p>
<p>created. I mean, you could have said that, you know, Google</p>
<p>could have had 90 different algorithms. But you know, Larry</p>
<p>Page started with backroom. That&rsquo;s how it started. He had to</p>
<p>make an educated guess that he had to make decisions. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what startups about. You have to make decisions and</p>
<p>your asses. Well, you have to make a bet on your on your own.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you put all your capital into one company? Oh,</p>
<p>because mostly the companies won&rsquo;t let me. But I would if I</p>
<p>could. Oh, interesting. So I think that what&rsquo;s happening here</p>
<p>to me, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. If I could, I would, but they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let me. You could buy you could put all your money back</p>
<p>into Facebook or back into forget Facebook. I know you got</p>
<p>issues. But what about Alphabet or Amazon, just put all your</p>
<p>capital in one bet and just, you know, write it up. Right. But</p>
<p>then it comes to what I think where I can generate the best</p>
<p>return. Meaning, you know, I think that I could generate much</p>
<p>higher returns than what I think Google will give me. Yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I do it. Well, here&rsquo;s what I think&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>here. There are a lot of rich people who are going to die</p>
<p>soon. And they&rsquo;re counting down like Bezos. And they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>if why not, if I&rsquo;m worth 100 billion, put 123 billion into</p>
<p>this, and have them go for it. Because I&rsquo;ve got nothing to</p>
<p>lose, because I&rsquo;m dying in 20 years. This is a fear of death</p>
<p>by billionaire bet, which is exactly what I think happened</p>
<p>with the Google guys. They were just like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say the team involved in these projects are not first</p>
<p>time founders or people that are great pitchman. It&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>that are repeated tried and true entrepreneur success stories</p>
<p>that have done this over and over in biotech. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the ones that are being drawn into working on these projects.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying, look, because we&rsquo;ve got the people</p>
<p>that have done it over and over, give them the capital. I</p>
<p>mean, no, I believe that&rsquo;s a good argument. Yeah, I believe</p>
<p>in Yamanaka factors. And I believe that there will be</p>
<p>innovation. My only question is, is the innovation going to</p>
<p>come through a small team that raises a small quantum of</p>
<p>capital with one very focused idea that gets it right? Or</p>
<p>this sort of, you know, Monte Carlo simulation approach to</p>
<p>product innovation. And all I&rsquo;m saying is just an observation</p>
<p>that historically, it&rsquo;s been very difficult for these Monte</p>
<p>Carlo simulations to ever work either to generate product</p>
<p>market fit and an innovation, and to make money. Now,</p>
<p>hopefully, these guys are the exception that proves the rule,</p>
<p>because I think we&rsquo;d all want this to work.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a great point. And I hope you&rsquo;re right. And I</p>
<p>hope to start that small project. And</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re saying the key thing, because despite the $3</p>
<p>billion, you&rsquo;re still going to go after it, which implicitly</p>
<p>is your way of saying, I&rsquo;m short that company, and I&rsquo;m long my</p>
<p>own company. And this is this is the point I was trying to get</p>
<p>to, which is when when really, really smart people see these</p>
<p>things, they tend to look at it with a grain of salt thinking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to build a startup as it is. Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s kind of like growing great wine, you need to</p>
<p>have a little pain and suffering along the way. And when you have</p>
<p>$3 billion, it&rsquo;s the opposite of pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Totally true. And I&rsquo;ll also say, let me just support your</p>
<p>point, which is the people I see get hired to big projects like</p>
<p>this. And there are a number of them that get funded, not just</p>
<p>also in, in other kind of deep tech stuff. They hire the tried</p>
<p>and true experienced executives, who generally have older kids</p>
<p>and live in a nice house and have made a bunch of money. And</p>
<p>the earnestness, the motivation, the hunger, the fuel, the</p>
<p>creativity, because they know what they know, and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>willing to accept that they don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Those folks generally are less likely to succeed than the folks</p>
<p>who are doing this maybe for the first time. For that very</p>
<p>reason, when you&rsquo;re doing something innovative, so I</p>
<p>totally support your point. And, and I really do hope you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right. But I thought Jason, when you were talking about talking</p>
<p>about startups, I thought we were gonna talk about bolt and</p>
<p>the stripe mafia fiasco this. Well, that&rsquo;s a good story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty crazy story. Where does everyone follow? What</p>
<p>side does everyone fall on that? Does anybody have any equity</p>
<p>positions at either company? Let&rsquo;s start there? No, no.</p>
<p>Stripe holders? No. Saks? No. Saks. Are you an LP in any firms</p>
<p>that have? I&rsquo;m an LP. I&rsquo;m an LP in funds that have exposure to</p>
<p>it. Absolutely. Yeah, for sure. I&rsquo;m an LP in a fund that has</p>
<p>exposure as well. But it doesn&rsquo;t but it&rsquo;s minuscule. That</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t affect minuscule doesn&rsquo;t matter. Yeah, it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for me, too. Okay, here we go. So for people who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>bolt is like one click checkout software, they compete in some</p>
<p>ways with stripes payment API. The CEO Ryan Breslau did a tweet</p>
<p>thread basically saying that YC and stripe are the mob bosses of</p>
<p>Silicon Valley, it was pretty charged. Obviously, stripe and</p>
<p>YC work together. stripe is the biggest company to come out of</p>
<p>YC ever, I guess along with Airbnb. He claims that a lot of</p>
<p>the top VCs were blocked as a strategy by stripe. And I think</p>
<p>there is some truth to this when you invest in one company, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t invest in the competitor. I don&rsquo;t know if that happened</p>
<p>here as a strategy, but it is a viable strategy that other</p>
<p>people have used where bolt claim stripe got all the top</p>
<p>investors, therefore, they couldn&rsquo;t raise money. He also</p>
<p>was saying they were voting things up and down on why</p>
<p>combinators hacker news as if that matters, yada, yada, yada,</p>
<p>it was kind of a weak argument, in my view, I&rsquo;ll give you a</p>
<p>bunch of VCs dunking on I&rsquo;ll give I&rsquo;ll give you my hot take.</p>
<p>So first of all, bolt is now a $14 billion company or</p>
<p>something. Okay, so that, you know, these guys, I think this</p>
<p>was a very brilliant PR strategy. And it worked. What do</p>
<p>I mean by this? This was a company that most people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know about until this past week, they went and they punched</p>
<p>up, which is a pretty tried and true PR strategy, always fight</p>
<p>up, you pick the big guy, who&rsquo;s an incredibly pristine,</p>
<p>extremely well run company that is sucking up most of the</p>
<p>talented, you know, people in Silicon Valley to work for is a,</p>
<p>you know, center corn could be a trillion dollar company over</p>
<p>some lifetime. So they went and they punched up. And what</p>
<p>happened, everybody fell for it. They baited all of these</p>
<p>folks. And then all of these folks had to come out on</p>
<p>Twitter and lambast them. And basically, the net result of it</p>
<p>is if one person knew about bolt before, now hundreds and</p>
<p>thousands of people know about bolt afterwards. So not only do</p>
<p>they not know them, they&rsquo;re now they&rsquo;re contemporary, just in</p>
<p>terms of the practical reality, they are now part of a</p>
<p>discussion. And in a framework of companies in this space,</p>
<p>that they were never a part of before. This is Steve jobs is</p>
<p>moved with a 1984 commercial, he said IBM, and then Microsoft,</p>
<p>our big brother, we&rsquo;re going to attack them, join the rebel</p>
<p>alliance, be part of Apple. And of course, Apple and IBM</p>
<p>responded. And that was the big mistake. And Mark Andreessen</p>
<p>Sequoia, a bunch of different venture firms responded. Saks,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your take on this? I see you&rsquo;re chomping at the bit, or</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re biting your tongue, which is</p>
<p>no, I saw I agree with Jamal that it was kind of a brilliant</p>
<p>PR move. If that&rsquo;s what it was, I do like startups punching up.</p>
<p>And he took a punch at Stripe, which is the big company in the</p>
<p>space. So and then yeah, Stripe, Stripe didn&rsquo;t respond directly</p>
<p>to call since and respond, but their surrogates did. And then</p>
<p>that looks like punching down and it draws more attention to</p>
<p>it. So I get the PR strategy, I would say that as to the merits</p>
<p>of the allegation, I do. It&rsquo;s interesting that you know, he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get into YC, because I think that he is a very</p>
<p>talented founder. And, you know, we looked at this company,</p>
<p>pretty, yeah, pretty early on, it was for like, sort of a</p>
<p>mid stage growth round. And it was like one of the toughest</p>
<p>decisions we, we face, I&rsquo;d say the toughest decisions as a VC</p>
<p>are when you actually want to invest in the company. But the</p>
<p>valuation is like 2x what you think it should be. And that was</p>
<p>kind of the situation at the time, when we looked at it is I</p>
<p>think we actually would have invested, this is the valuation</p>
<p>was too high. So it would have been a great bet for you. Yeah,</p>
<p>he grew into it. And so it would have been a great bet. So it was</p>
<p>a bad decision on your part. Yeah, yeah, clearly, we should</p>
<p>have invested. It&rsquo;s just that, you know, at the time you invest,</p>
<p>you have to have some basis for valuation. And that&rsquo;s the sense</p>
<p>in which I think, you know, maybe Ryan&rsquo;s accusations don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>totally make sense is that he&rsquo;s been able to raise a lot of</p>
<p>rounds at really high valuations. And so he, he hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>had a problem, you know, raising a lot of money at, you</p>
<p>know, great prices. And, you know, it&rsquo;s almost feels like a</p>
<p>slap in the face to his investors where, like, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the complaint? I didn&rsquo;t get any tier one investors or that it</p>
<p>was just hard to meet with investors. And that stripe</p>
<p>called the investors and told them not to invest that that was</p>
<p>the allegation. Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, I can&rsquo;t really speak</p>
<p>to that. But he was clearly able to raise great rounds. So can I</p>
<p>read to you an email exchange between me and Ryan Breslow? Oh,</p>
<p>dramatic reading from 2015. Oh, here we go. H math hopes all</p>
<p>all as well. FYI, things felt too rushed on our end. So we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>toning down our Series A discussions for a couple months.</p>
<p>And this was this was in July of 2015. I&rsquo;m reading you my</p>
<p>answer because it&rsquo;s so fabulous. Hi, Ryan. After a wholly</p>
<p>unsuccessful few weeks of attempting to win a World Series</p>
<p>of Poker bracelet, I&rsquo;m back at home licking my moons. How</p>
<p>about we talk in a week or two? So not only did I have a chance</p>
<p>to win a World Series of Poker bracelet, according to this</p>
<p>exchange, which I didn&rsquo;t win, obviously, duh, I had a chance</p>
<p>to do the Series A in a $14 billion company and screwed</p>
<p>that one up too. Big dummies. I mean, the the things we miss</p>
<p>are there&rsquo;s like 20 things you miss as an investor for</p>
<p>everything you hit. So I&rsquo;ve interacted with Ryan back in</p>
<p>the day, and I just remember him being super, super smart.</p>
<p>And I do think that, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of very smart</p>
<p>people now around the table at Bolt, including Joanne</p>
<p>Bradford. So I don&rsquo;t think that this was something that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>planned. And I just think that they executed it well. And it</p>
<p>worked. And I think a lot of people know this company that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know before. Now they still have to execute and build</p>
<p>a product and scale it and do all of these things. But</p>
<p>yeah, and I think that the response he provoked, I mean,</p>
<p>since I was a little bit critical of what he said, let</p>
<p>me to say that one of the VCs responded said that the reason</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t invest was because the numbers weren&rsquo;t good. That</p>
<p>was not my experience. When we looked at this company, they</p>
<p>had great numbers. It&rsquo;s just the valuation was ahead of those</p>
<p>numbers. But the numbers were always great.</p>
<p>I actually responded to that. And that was Sequoia partner,</p>
<p>Sean McGuire, who said that. And I responded to him like, Hey,</p>
<p>dude, VC code is you don&rsquo;t reveal the numbers on things</p>
<p>you learn confidentially, what are you doing? Like, and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, well, they said some bs about tribe. I was like, yeah,</p>
<p>it still doesn&rsquo;t change VC code that if you learn something</p>
<p>under NDA, friend, da, essentially, in a meeting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to weaponize that.</p>
<p>Unless you unless you have a $30 billion position.</p>
<p>I still think well, whatever. I still think it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>seen a VC. Honestly, it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen a VC</p>
<p>Jason, Jason, come on. I don&rsquo;t I think it&rsquo;s pretty, I think we</p>
<p>all knew where he was coming from. He&rsquo;s defending an</p>
<p>enormous position of his and Sequoia, Jason, you&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>been</p>
<p>never released inside information is my point.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say inside information, information.</p>
<p>General statement, he&rsquo;s he made a general statement met with</p>
<p>them, but he was conflicted out. So why would he meet with</p>
<p>them? Hey, guys, Nick just texted that I had I had I found</p>
<p>a way to get off my lazy ass not be playing poker and do that</p>
<p>deal. I would have generated a 222 x on my investment, which</p>
<p>would have been 15 million times 222.</p>
<p>Well, we screwed it up too. I think I think we looked at when</p>
<p>like a $400 million valuation or something like that or</p>
<p>something in that range. And so my gosh, what would the series</p>
<p>a bit? I mean, the series, they would have been at like 23</p>
<p>years, 63 million, according to pitch book. Oh, yeah, 63</p>
<p>million. You know, it was one of those meetings we came out</p>
<p>of where it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a super interesting founder. So</p>
<p>yeah, me too. And that&rsquo;s what I remember too from Ryan. Yeah,</p>
<p>super, super, super interesting founder, write the check. I said</p>
<p>it earlier in the program that like our philosophy now is just</p>
<p>to be price takers and just to pick the companies that we want</p>
<p>to be in and then the market sets the price. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>biggest mistakes I&rsquo;ve made as an investor. We should have done</p>
<p>that with bolt. This was the decision we faced was like a</p>
<p>few years ago. And so we just shouldn&rsquo;t have worried about</p>
<p>valuation. By the way, sorry, J Cal, as soon as you said it was</p>
<p>63 million, you know what my reptilian brain said, Oh, that</p>
<p>feels so expensive, even now, even now, billion. And so to</p>
<p>your point, David, it&rsquo;s a really good lesson for for investors to</p>
<p>learn is just you&rsquo;re a price taker to get behind these</p>
<p>really interesting people that are world beaters and just let</p>
<p>them do the work. All right. So there you have it. This has been</p>
<p>another amazing episode of the all in podcast. Bye bye. Bye</p>
<p>bye. Love you. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>love you as a queen of</p>
<p>besties are gone.</p>
<p>Should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just like this like sexual tension, but</p>
<p>they just need to release</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m</p>
