Burke</p><p>for inviting me on so you know we have a</p><p>phrase here at keto mojo that</p><p>measurement is the first step that leads</p><p>to control and once you can control</p><p>something you can improve upon it so</p><p>there are three types of ketones you&rsquo;ve</p><p>got acetyl acetate acetone and beta</p><p>hydroxy butyrate so the acetyl acetate</p><p>is what is spilled into the urine when</p><p>you just mentioned when you are first</p><p>starting and it&rsquo;s very kind of like</p><p>subjective you know like what shade of</p><p>pink do I have and realize that you&rsquo;re</p><p>only measuring what was spilled over a</p><p>period of time since you lost</p><p>urinated and hydration can have effects</p><p>on that so some of these dehydrated</p><p>they&rsquo;re going to look like wow I&rsquo;m</p><p>really deep from herbally it must be</p><p>great but no you might actually just be</p><p>a little bit dehydrated so acetone</p><p>represent represents about 30% of the</p><p>energy that&rsquo;s available to the body and</p><p>then he gets quick very volatile</p><p>chemical that quickly gets shunted into</p><p>beta-hydroxybutyrate</p><p>which is far more a stable compound</p><p>and that&rsquo;s what we measure in blood and</p><p>that represents about 70% of the energy</p><p>that is available to to the body and so</p><p>that&rsquo;s why in all clinical trials and</p><p>all studies they measure blood because</p><p>the blood as a quantitative analysis and</p><p>it matches to an international standard</p><p>that is laid down for it</p><p>the last method of testing is acetone</p><p>which is which is done in the breath and</p><p>we&rsquo;ve seen we&rsquo;ve seen the rise of</p><p>different breath analyzers and that the</p><p>challenge with those as much people</p><p>don&rsquo;t know that unless the sensor is</p><p>replaceable in that if you&rsquo;ve had any</p><p>sugar alcohols in the last 60 minutes or</p><p>chewing gum or alcohol itself and a</p><p>variety of other things you can actually</p><p>blow out that sensor because what you&rsquo;re</p><p>basically is coating the sensor with all</p><p>the sugar alcohols that are on your</p><p>breath not allowing the acetone to come</p><p>on in and those breast senses were</p><p>originally done for actually as</p><p>breathalyzers fault for alcohol which is</p><p>a much bigger if you will molecule and</p><p>that&rsquo;s the problem with those so you can</p><p>end up there having just an expensive</p><p>paperweight really on your desk so all</p><p>studies all doctors all clinicians blood</p><p>is definitely the way to go but with our</p><p>meter we don&rsquo;t do blood as well in the</p><p>blood we&rsquo;ve measured not only the</p><p>ketones</p><p>but the glucose as well as two strips to</p><p>do that yeah that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s one of</p><p>the things that when people get a meter</p><p>they they do I do get the blood I get</p><p>the ketone well this one actually does</p><p>both which is really cool</p><p>now you do need two different types of</p><p>strips yeah so so yeah and using two</p><p>ships you know if you&rsquo;re only measuring</p><p>one part you&rsquo;re only seeing half the</p><p>picture and you can actually you know</p><p>first of all and the basic part is like</p><p>how close am I getting to ketosis so</p><p>measuring your ketones for that you see</p><p>yourself gently rising up once you get</p><p>to the threshold of 0.5 millimoles</p><p>that&rsquo;s the threshold of nutritional</p><p>ketosis and between 0.5 and roughly 3 is</p><p>sort of like the optimal zone higher</p><p>isn&rsquo;t is not necessarily better and</p><p>don&rsquo;t go chasing ketones out there you</p><p>to work out what your bio individuality</p><p>is and and to do that it sort of let get</p><p>to learn what your baseline is so first</p><p>you get the joy of the gamification if</p><p>you will like how close am I getting to</p><p>ketosis if you&rsquo;re not getting there</p><p>what&rsquo;s going on in in your diet and what</p><p>you are doing to help you that&rsquo;s</p><p>preventing you and that&rsquo;s where glucose</p><p>can come on in and I liked it you call</p><p>it&rsquo;s looting out your trigger foods so</p><p>Glueck glucose moves really quickly in</p><p>the body you know if you have ice cream</p><p>or carbohydrates that very quickly</p><p>within 60 minutes is going to be</p><p>converted into glucose and then the body</p><p>has to have an insulin response to that</p><p>to manager otherwise you get diabetes so</p><p>you will see your glucose spiked on up</p><p>really quickly if you&rsquo;ve had a food that</p><p>contains glucose on it and then that can</p><p>tell you pain maybe I should avoid that</p><p>don&rsquo;t generally keep weak say keep the</p><p>the swings under 30 milligrams per</p><p>deciliter for Americans well that&rsquo;s</p><p>roughly 1.7 for Europeans and millimoles</p><p>and glucose you want to keep those those</p><p>Rises very kind of like small so that&rsquo;s</p><p>like number one you can do with a</p><p>glucose drip and one point about that</p><p>like the higher the higher the glucose</p><p>reading the less ketones you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>actually have because the body is going</p><p>to be running on that glucose and not</p><p>the ketones bingo it will preferentially</p><p>say hey I&rsquo;ve got to use the glucose and</p><p>manage that which means it won&rsquo;t produce</p><p>anymore ketones and then you&rsquo;ll slowly</p><p>see your ketones drift down ketones move</p><p>very very slowly you gotta think of them</p><p>like a slow-moving Tortoise and the hare</p><p>thing in that respect so the second</p><p>thing you can do is I have a perp</p><p>personally I have an issue with sugar</p><p>alcohols sorbitol respiratory towles any</p><p>of the towles what I find is I might not</p><p>get that glycemic spike what I do so I</p><p>find is that my my ketones start to</p><p>drift down and what that tells me is I</p><p>may not have been having a glycemic</p><p>response glucose going up but might I</p><p>have had an insulin response to those</p><p>sugar alcohols and this is one of the</p><p>things that really comes into play just</p><p>because it says keto on the label</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s keno for you</p><p>everybody&rsquo;s a little bit different in</p><p>that respect and that&rsquo;s why we relate to</p><p>proteins about bio individuality you</p><p>know one size does not fit all and you</p><p>kind of like need to work out what right</p><p>for you and your body some people have</p><p>an issue with dairy - this is</p><p>interesting so you have two things you</p><p>have glucose you have insulin people</p><p>have this idea that well glucose is the</p><p>only thing that will stimulate insulin</p><p>there&rsquo;s actually non glucose things that</p><p>can stimulate insulin even protein can</p><p>do it so then the low fat protein like</p><p>even whey protein so if the insulin goes</p><p>up but your glucose doesn&rsquo;t go up that&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna knock you out of ketosis as well</p><p>so this is a great tool to be able to</p><p>identify what foods Mike you can&rsquo;t eat</p><p>on your program and even with the Aquino</p><p>Fritz so-called friendly foods you have</p><p>people using multiple dextran dextrose</p><p>Tex what else Lee is to use um tapioca</p><p>starch like these yes yeah yeah all of</p><p>those those fiber fillers can that can</p><p>have an effect on some people but not on</p><p>yeah I mean if you can get away with it</p><p>like all power to you you know I mean</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tasted that a lot of the Congress</p><p>is some of these keto foods and like I&rsquo;m</p><p>like mmm that sounds that&rsquo;s so delicious</p><p>but the things like probably eating</p><p>entire plate cuz that&rsquo;s what triggers me</p><p>and so like I I personally steer clear</p><p>from those and and do but you know the</p><p>highest of desserts for me is</p><p>strawberries and cream hey that&rsquo;s great</p><p>I I can do this sugar cause I can I like</p><p>salat all I even like alamos but I don&rsquo;t</p><p>do well with Murray throat all for some</p><p>reason so it&rsquo;s just one thing that I&rsquo;ve</p><p>discovered yeah monk fruits I kind of a</p><p>go-to one for me that that works out</p><p>really really well yeah but we all have</p><p>our own way so when you are able to test</p><p>with glucose and ketones this this</p><p>sleuthing aspect is a really useful tool</p><p>especially when you&rsquo;re first starting</p><p>out</p><p>but as you said you&rsquo;ve got to get that</p><p>baseline first to learn what is your</p><p>right because you can certainly say we</p><p>people run at different levels on their</p><p>glucose and so normally what I say to</p><p>people is find your baseline and that&rsquo;s</p><p>about an hour after waking because when</p><p>you first wake up you&rsquo;ve got that dawn</p><p>phenomenon which basically gives you</p><p>that cortisol spike in the morning so</p><p>when you get a a cortisol spike that</p><p>will actually increase your glucose so</p><p>just to clarify people that don&rsquo;t know</p><p>what the dawn phenomena is you when you</p><p>check your blood sugars they should be</p><p>low if you&rsquo;re fasting but in the morning</p><p>sometimes they&rsquo;re high like you&rsquo;re going</p><p>wait a sec I didn&rsquo;t eat anything I got</p><p>high blood sugar in the morning that&rsquo;s</p><p>because the adrenal hormone can produce</p><p>cortisol and release it mobilize it and</p><p>say also you sugar goes high it&rsquo;s not</p><p>that you eat sugar precisely yeah and so</p><p>that so that&rsquo;s the challenge with that</p><p>part there and now most people saying or</p><p>I see a lot of literature that states</p><p>dawn phenomena is about an hour but on</p><p>some people we&rsquo;ve seen that role for a</p><p>lot longer and so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s sort</p><p>of like hey you&rsquo;ve got to work out what</p><p>is right for you and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p><p>what I call the curiosity testing to</p><p>find out your bio individuality so there</p><p>so you&rsquo;ve got your baseline there so</p><p>then a lot of people ask well when</p><p>should I test I went to test if I like</p><p>to do that in the morning just before</p><p>breakfast so I get my baseline and your</p><p>ketones are generally lowest in the</p><p>morning and then they rise up during the</p><p>day if you&rsquo;ve been eating nice and clean</p><p>and they get to their Zenith just before</p><p>your your evening meal so I like to do</p><p>it like a low and high just to find out</p><p>how I&rsquo;m doing the second time is when</p><p>we&rsquo;re sluicing out foods I would then do</p><p>about 60 minutes after eating and I do a</p><p>double test on that to see what&rsquo;s going</p><p>on with that particular meal now do you</p><p>have to test after every meal no who</p><p>wants to be a slave to the meter I mean</p><p>I certainly don&rsquo;t but you want to work</p><p>out what is right for you so we find a</p><p>lot of people test a lot to begin with</p><p>work out they test they adjust the diet</p><p>workout they tested</p><p>the dire until they get to the point in</p><p>the test they&rsquo;re in ketosis they test</p><p>they keep them there their glycemic</p><p>response low and if there happens</p><p>repeatedly and you&rsquo;re a creature of</p><p>habit you don&rsquo;t need to test because you</p><p>know you&rsquo;ve learnt it you know you and</p><p>your body and then from then you can</p><p>move on so I find think IDO mojo is the</p><p>training wheels in life you know you&rsquo;re</p><p>not going to stay with them all the time</p><p>and eventually you&rsquo;re going to be</p><p>shooting on and if we&rsquo;re doing great and</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna be healthy and it&rsquo;s like</p><p>hey yeah job done that&rsquo;s what we started</p><p>what we got into this forest revolution</p><p>to cut revolutionize the cause yeah I</p><p>own some use that when someone&rsquo;s having</p><p>trouble and also in they&rsquo;re like oh I&rsquo;m</p><p>stuck okay so do you are you checking</p><p>your teaches well no are you checking</p><p>your blood sugar man look I need that</p><p>data to evaluate there&rsquo;s two things that</p><p>I want to mention one is let&rsquo;s say for</p><p>example you have coffee in the morning</p><p>and you have MCT oil your how to do fat</p><p>right which turns into ketones so you</p><p>also have eating a meal let&rsquo;s say for</p><p>example you&rsquo;re eating more carbs in that</p><p>male versus really low carbs more fat</p><p>your body will turn some of that fat</p><p>into ketones and you could be in a</p><p>situation where your ketones are high</p><p>but you may you may not lose weight</p><p>because you&rsquo;re burning up your dietary</p><p>ketones your dietary fat and that&rsquo;s like</p><p>that&rsquo;s like a big thing that people get</p><p>frustrated sometimes so so if you&rsquo;re</p><p>really in the ketosis and you get your</p><p>blood sugar down okay good that&rsquo;s to the</p><p>side but you&rsquo;re still not losing weight</p><p>well maybe you need to adjust your</p><p>dietary fats absolutely and you know</p><p>there there&rsquo;s the whole sort of like</p><p>macro saying that comes into play there</p><p>when I first started here I did I did</p><p>track my macros I calculated my BMI and</p><p>all of that stuff with a macro</p><p>calculator and then every month after</p><p>that I did a recalculation as my weight</p><p>dropped because it&rsquo;s going to change</p><p>over time and also your satiety changes</p><p>as well and I kept myself in a slight</p><p>caloric deficit only by about maybe 5% 5</p><p>10 %</p><p>something like that because I knew that</p><p>then I would be metabolizing my my</p><p>bodily fat and so yeah so there is</p><p>there&rsquo;s a misconception when people say</p><p>that a ketogenic diet is a high fat diet</p><p>moderate amount of protein lots of above</p><p>ground leafy vegetables it really is an</p><p>adequate amount of fat for you and for</p><p>your journey and what you&rsquo;re looking to</p><p>do because remember that there are</p><p>people who are looking for a ketogenic</p><p>lifestyle for for weight loss then there</p><p>are those that are using it maybe for</p><p>traumatic brain injury or for epilepsy</p><p>or because they&rsquo;re using it for</p><p>psychological reasons as well I mean I</p><p>used to be on antidepressant meds for</p><p>many many years but I found that when my</p><p>key turns are between one point one and</p><p>one point seven and this is me</p><p>personally everybody is different that</p><p>when I was between one point one and one</p><p>point seven this was my sweet spot and I</p><p>was able to come off all of my anti</p><p>depression meds and and so when you look</p><p>at the use of MCTS you know which is I</p><p>like to have caproic acid see eight it&rsquo;s</p><p>really bioavailable to the liver and can</p><p>make you a nice pop of endogenous</p><p>ketones really really quickly and and so</p><p>for me if I&rsquo;m looking to get into my</p><p>optimal zone for reason I just have a</p><p>little bit of MCT oil in my my keto</p><p>coffee in the morning so I want to just</p><p>give people a really cool tip about this</p><p>without MCT oil in general there&rsquo;s</p><p>something unique about the brain the</p><p>brain does love ketones um but when</p><p>you&rsquo;re trying to get into ketosis</p><p>sometimes it takes some time especially</p><p>if you&rsquo;re like evidence of the</p><p>resistance or you&rsquo;re pre-diabetic or</p><p>diabetic and your body is just making</p><p>more sugar and you just can&rsquo;t seem to</p><p>get the sugar down one thing you can do</p><p>is take some MCT oil a little bit more</p><p>than usual to spike your ketones now</p><p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen your brain will</p><p>choose the ketones more than the glucose</p><p>it&rsquo;ll actually as a preference feel a</p><p>tap hold and ketones up the brain and</p><p>use that</p><p>and usually if you have a problem with</p><p>instant resistance you&rsquo;re gonna have</p><p>instant resistance in the blood-brain</p><p>barrier and those ketones will bypass</p><p>all that it&rsquo;ll feed the brain cells and</p><p>you&rsquo;ll start feeling better right away</p><p>cognitive and your mood because your</p><p>brain is starting to get the fuel that</p><p>it needs so it&rsquo;s a little pack that&rsquo;s</p><p>very powerful and something you can</p><p>speed things up</p><p>as you&rsquo;re trying to get any ketosis you</p><p>can actually just you could take ketones</p><p>to keep on salts if you want the only</p><p>time I recommend that is if you&rsquo;re like</p><p>an athlete or you&rsquo;re maybe have some</p><p>type of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Parkinson&rsquo;s or a</p><p>dimension that you want to just give</p><p>some straight fuel to that brain it&rsquo;ll</p><p>it&rsquo;ll suck it up in preference to</p><p>glucose so that&rsquo;s cool yeah I mean and</p><p>so the exogenous ketones you know they</p><p>can be quite expensive depending on your</p><p>pocketbook and you know I will see at</p><p>one packet might get about a million</p><p>more to a 1.5 minute mole</p><p>rise for about an hour hour and a half</p><p>whereas MCT will for for what is 32</p><p>cents retail can if you already fat</p><p>adapt it can give you over a minimal</p><p>rise and last for a lot longer you know</p><p>for five hours from that because your</p><p>livers making it and obviously but also</p><p>don&rsquo;t go crazy on MCT oil because I&rsquo;ve</p><p>seen people do that it&rsquo;s like what your</p><p>tolerance is go like if you&rsquo;re also one</p><p>thing with the acute mojo device is</p><p>really good to use if you&rsquo;re</p><p>pre-diabetic or diabetic to see your</p><p>improvements pre and post meal by</p><p>several hours so if you start looking at</p><p>the dynamic fluctuations of what happens</p><p>to your blood sugars and your ketones</p><p>before and after meals like say one hour</p><p>after 2-3 hours you can start tracking</p><p>that the trends and you&rsquo;re gonna see</p><p>like well I&rsquo;m getting better</p><p>Wow it&rsquo;s a great tool to in measure</p><p>improvement and so evaluation is about</p><p>comparing two things okay you</p><p>so highly Mohammed by the way has the</p><p>ability to actually tag a cm EC so post</p><p>pre and post basically your mule mil so</p><p>there&rsquo;s an icon that is on that so you</p><p>can do a little tag just to remind you</p><p>hey what was going on on that one there</p><p>and we all obviously have our Bluetooth</p><p>connector that now you can connect all</p><p>of that data and you know you&rsquo;re going</p><p>to you can share it put it onto your</p><p>phone and then put it on to other</p><p>platforms as well we&rsquo;ve got some</p><p>exciting news that&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>happening in on that front very soon</p><p>very nice what&rsquo;s the exciting news so</p><p>we&rsquo;ve been working for the last six</p><p>months to build a secure HIPAA compliant</p><p>encrypted health cloud and in that house</p><p>cloud you&rsquo;re going to actually be able</p><p>to track all of your data and then what</p><p>we&rsquo;re also going to be working now once</p><p>we have built this this health cloud we</p><p>better do air simple API calls as the</p><p>tech boys say it and that means we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to restart into linking to all</p><p>different electronic health records and</p><p>other systems as well so basically we</p><p>want people to have access to the data</p><p>but they also need to share it with</p><p>their caregiving team so say for</p><p>instance you&rsquo;ve had a cancer diagnosis</p><p>and you&rsquo;re using a ketogenic therapy as</p><p>an adjunct to your normal standard of</p><p>care you&rsquo;re gonna want to have your</p><p>integrative medicine doctor you might</p><p>wanna have your chiropractor you have</p><p>your oncologist your radiologist and</p><p>maybe even your your health coach have</p><p>access to all of that data at the same</p><p>time so one of the challenges of going</p><p>hero is self accountability you know</p><p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a psychological and a</p><p>physiological game that gets played here</p><p>and you have to change some of these</p><p>lifestyle habits and that takes 30 to 60</p><p>days to really ingrain that habit and</p><p>that accountability so you don&rsquo;t fall</p><p>off the wagon during the time is where</p><p>glucose and ketone measurements can come</p><p>on in because then on a daily basis you</p><p>wake up in the morning new tests and you</p><p>know in your state of ketosis great that</p><p>means what you were doing</p><p>it was right then if you&rsquo;re using the GK</p><p>I because you want to have a very low</p><p>ratio for maybe for cancer therapy</p><p>professor Thomas Seyfried fine what that</p><p>means yeah that&rsquo;s a good question</p><p>glucose ketone index is the G ki and it</p><p>is the relationship between your glucose</p><p>measurement in millimoles and your</p><p>ketone measurement so in America you</p><p>will take your glucose measurement which</p><p>is in milligrams per deciliter and you</p><p>divide that by 18 and that will give you</p><p>millimoles and then you then divide that</p><p>by your ketone measurement so</p><p>nutritional ketosis is defined anywhere</p><p>under 9 so a nutritional ketosis kind of</p><p>gki will be somewhere anywhere from</p><p>maybe 3 4 2 to 9 that top and then</p><p>therapeutic ketosis maybe you&rsquo;re using</p><p>this for epilepsy or for peacocks or</p><p>something like that that&rsquo;s gonna be</p><p>roughly 1 2 3 cancer you&rsquo;re gonna try</p><p>and get it under 1 but that is really</p><p>really really hard usually you need to</p><p>be you will definitely need to be under</p><p>doctor&rsquo;s supervision for that you&rsquo;ll</p><p>definitely be for doing caloric</p><p>restriction one meal a day you might</p><p>even be on on metformin as well and some</p><p>other stuff to really get that glucose</p><p>down low because the Warburg effects is</p><p>what comes into play here that I wanna</p><p>touch on that one point just so people</p><p>have a little reality on this this</p><p>cancer thing dr. Thomas Seyfried who was</p><p>he&rsquo;s doing research in Boston</p><p>fascinating book it&rsquo;s called cancer as a</p><p>metabolic disease but when he&rsquo;s done he</p><p>he can&rsquo;t find how he&rsquo;s doing in animal</p><p>studies but you can&rsquo;t find a type of</p><p>cancer that can survive after 15 days of</p><p>his protocol so he&rsquo;s basically the thing</p><p>about cancer cells is they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p><p>hyper glucose</p><p>consumers they consume glucose at a rate</p><p>I think if I&rsquo;m not mistaken it&rsquo;s like a</p><p>33 times more than normal cells so you</p><p>know you have to start them and then if</p><p>you start them they they go they can&rsquo;t</p><p>live so to do that you want these tools</p><p>to measure your blood sugars you want to</p><p>get a really low metformin probably</p><p>would help but you know have all the</p><p>drugs I think that one probably is if</p><p>you should take the B vitamins for b1</p><p>especially are the least amount of side</p><p>effects or else if you don&rsquo;t it could</p><p>create a big side effect as a warning</p><p>label on there for lactic acidosis but</p><p>b1 is what you would need to prevent</p><p>that problem but yeah so it&rsquo;s about</p><p>dropping the glucose so you can actually</p><p>attack this cancer and then have the the</p><p>cells the good cells live on ketones so</p><p>it&rsquo;s a great strategy there&rsquo;s videos on</p><p>this data but there&rsquo;s also a recent</p><p>paper that on the Seyfried just recently</p><p>posted up along with Dominic D&rsquo;Agostino</p><p>Miriam Callum Ian and Ally nadir all</p><p>about their their press pulse a pro</p><p>approach and protocol so I encourage</p><p>people to to read that because it goes a</p><p>little bit more into detail about how</p><p>they did low the glucose there and how</p><p>they were using hyperbaric oxygen</p><p>therapy at the same time because</p><p>different cancer ferments the glucose in</p><p>the cell and aerobic Li so they wanted</p><p>to make a very aerobic environment so</p><p>they&rsquo;re trying to make it as hard as</p><p>hard as hard as hard and hard as</p><p>possible for that cancer to survive</p><p>until eventually it&rsquo;s weakens down so</p><p>much that the body&rsquo;s wonderful immune</p><p>system can really get get into play and</p><p>get his arms around it and necrotize</p><p>that tumor and I&rsquo;m just going to say</p><p>that since you brought the topic up on</p><p>cancer there&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m</p><p>gonna be talking about at the summit</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna be at the summit you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna be testing people a lot of people</p><p>that are watching now are gonna be there</p><p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a great event but he&rsquo;s</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to be touching on some</p><p>interesting data with cancer because um</p><p>here&rsquo;s the thing with the cancer there&rsquo;s</p><p>a this conventional view point where you</p><p>have a genetic mutation and then you get</p><p>cancer but this isn&rsquo;t really pan out</p><p>there&rsquo;s too many holes in that theory</p><p>and also all the different chemotherapy</p><p>drugs have not really panned out to wipe</p><p>out cancer because there&rsquo;s too many</p><p>mutations it&rsquo;s all over the place well</p><p>just to get to your point there I mean</p><p>if you look at the rise of the cancer</p><p>cancer rate since the 1970s in direct</p><p>correlation to the rise of cheap</p><p>carbohydrates because you&rsquo;d and the</p><p>obesity rate you know has our genetic</p><p>code changed so remarkably since the</p><p>1970s no way no and it&rsquo;s not it so it&rsquo;s</p><p>not like that so it&rsquo;s really think that</p><p>that&rsquo;s a bit of a fool&rsquo;s errand of that</p><p>that some of the doctors are going down</p><p>on the fact that saying it&rsquo;s a genetic</p><p>thing yeah that can that can kind of</p><p>like tip the scales a little bit but not</p><p>to the extent that we can see that is</p><p>you have genes that are passed on from</p><p>your parents that potentially could be</p><p>cancer genes but it&rsquo;s very small</p><p>percentage the great majority of genes</p><p>are affected by our environment I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry the gene but the great majority of</p><p>cancers affecting about our environment</p><p>which means that it&rsquo;s something else and</p><p>so see free talks about this Warburg</p><p>actually started it the whole concept</p><p>but he said there&rsquo;s at first there is a</p><p>shift of metabolic in your mitochondria</p><p>that the new metabolism starts</p><p>fermenting glucose and then after that</p><p>you start getting mutations which is</p><p>fascinating in work so it&rsquo;s like what</p><p>this is a whole new concept so what I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to be talking about is exactly</p><p>what you said but the other the</p><p>nutritional deficiency is that are the</p><p>perfect storm because there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p><p>eight nutrients that are really</p><p>important in</p><p>repair and chromosome stability and</p><p>preventing breaks in the DNA and also</p><p>the cellular machinery with mitochondria</p><p>and if you&rsquo;re deficient and I&rsquo;m not</p><p>talking like fully deficient like you</p><p>would be in scurvy but if you&rsquo;re</p><p>deficient just like sub clinically um</p><p>that alone could create the same damage</p><p>as radiation therapy which is like mind</p><p>blowing you mean that the nutritional</p><p>efficiency could be just like getting</p><p>radiated I mean this is like huge so</p><p>anyway I&rsquo;m gonna talk about that at the</p><p>summit which is fascinating data and I</p><p>just wanted to mention that yeah I&rsquo;m</p><p>really looking forward to the summit</p><p>last year it was absolutely fantastic it</p><p>was super well attended the quality of</p><p>the speakers is is excellent and so</p><p>we&rsquo;re really honored to be invited back</p><p>again for that so thank you yeah I think</p><p>you also noticed that people that were</p><p>tested there was more people in ketosis</p><p>than other totally it&rsquo;s funny I was at a</p><p>convention in England England I&rsquo;m not</p><p>gonna say what it was</p><p>but it was full of doctors and nurses</p><p>and I tested them and no one was in a</p><p>state of nutritional ketosis and I asked</p><p>the group has anybody actually practice</p><p>this or lived it and they were using it</p><p>as therapies for the epileptic community</p><p>and I go oh I don&rsquo;t need to do it</p><p>because well maybe in 20 years and I&rsquo;m</p><p>thinking like oh my god the damage that</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing but this is - no this is</p><p>where they I love the work that you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing and others in the community is by</p><p>sharing the information we can put it</p><p>out there and this is what I call about</p><p>weaponizing the consumer we need to give</p><p>as much information as possible to the</p><p>consumer so they can make them well</p><p>judged choices of what they need to do</p><p>but I&rsquo;d like to come back to what you</p><p>said about radiation therapy there a</p><p>little bit my wife was diagnosed with</p><p>breast cancer</p><p>she&rsquo;s now seven years clear which is</p><p>fantastic for that but we wish we had</p><p>known then what we know</p><p>because it would have been a massive</p><p>game-changer I think in recovery time</p><p>and whether or not we would have gone</p><p>for the standard of care there would</p><p>have been something really up for a much</p><p>more heated debate than what it was</p><p>because the effects of the radiation</p><p>therapy can be pretty harsh to the to</p><p>the body and I think I think when you</p><p>talk about nutrient density and making</p><p>sure that we have all of that good which</p><p>to give our bodies what it needs is</p><p>vitally important people I don&rsquo;t talk</p><p>about in the Canadian community that&rsquo;s</p><p>nutrient density but I always want to</p><p>touch a little bit on that ketones is</p><p>not just energy it has a signaling</p><p>effect within within the body and when</p><p>we talk about cancers and rise of</p><p>cancers is it can up regulate gene</p><p>expression and down regulate are the</p><p>gene expression and just as the converse</p><p>can glucose can do that so if you were</p><p>predisposed to have a cancer and now</p><p>you&rsquo;ve got a large amount of glucose</p><p>with whether you can be up regulating</p><p>those genes that you don&rsquo;t want to be</p><p>doing that alarming for that that room</p><p>for that to come on into play I think</p><p>the work that&rsquo;s going to be done on the</p><p>signaling aspects of ketones is going to</p><p>be really exciting especially in the</p><p>neurological world coming up in the</p><p>future I love it I love it well this has</p><p>been really good is there any last</p><p>points that you wanted to mention</p><p>anything new well I think the next 60</p><p>days and key to mojo are going to be</p><p>probably the most exciting 60 day since</p><p>we first launched we have a brand new</p><p>website that is coming on out on there</p><p>and that&rsquo;s what we talked about the</p><p>weapon a team of the consumer with</p><p>recipes how to information what&rsquo;s going</p><p>on in the in the Kino community clinical</p><p>trials papers it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s something that</p><p>the team have been working on for the</p><p>last five months and we&rsquo;re super excited</p><p>with that that will be also paired with</p><p>the the new dashboard in which you can</p><p>track your health data because that</p><p>measurement will lead to control and</p><p>then there&rsquo;s something very exciting</p><p>coming for Europe can&rsquo;t give you</p><p>yet but that will be coming up in a</p><p>little while you know what but it&rsquo;ll be</p><p>pretty exciting we haven&rsquo;t forgotten</p><p>about our European friends well there&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna be a lot of people from Europe</p><p>watching this so I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll want</p><p>to I&rsquo;ll put the link down below guys for</p><p>what he&rsquo;s talking about so you can check</p><p>it out</p><p>but anyway thank you so much for taking</p><p>the time out I think we got a lot of</p><p>great data out there and I appreciate it</p><p>when watching this and stay tuned for</p><p>more updates</p><p>absolutely okay</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a
